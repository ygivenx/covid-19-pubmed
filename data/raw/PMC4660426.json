{"title": "Inferring the hosts of coronavirus using dual statistical models based on nucleotide\ncomposition", "body": "Nineteen parameters, including three mononucleotide frequencies (G, C and T) and\n16 dinucleotide biases, were computed from 777 spike gene sequences (see Supplementary Table S1). All\nparameters show significant differences across the host groups (Kruskal-Wallis\ntests, p < 2.2e\u201316); therefore, they were subsequently\nemployed as factors in statistical models for discriminant analyses.\nEmpirically, a dinucleotide relative abundance or dinucleotide bias (e.g.,\n) is significantly high if  or extremely low if 24. Among the 16 dinucleotides in this study, the CpA and TpG show\nan average abundance that is significantly higher than the expected values\n( = 1.29,\n = 1.28), whereas\nthe average bias of CpG is extremely low ( = 0.44). This result indicates that the observed\nabundances of CpA and TpG are significantly higher than their expected values,\nand the observed abundance of CpG is significantly lower than the expected\nvalue. The G+C content is minimal (31\u201347%). This finding indicates\nthat coronaviruses exhibit a low density of nucleotide sequences and may be\nsensitive to heat or alkali. The low G+C content also indicates a preference for\ncodons ending with A or T and a higher mutability.\n\nThe data matrix with 19 factors as columns and 730 samples as rows was fitted to\nSVM and MD models, all predictions in leave-one-out cross-validations were\nlisted in Supplementary Table S2 and\nsummarized in Table 1 according to host species. The\nvalidations indicate that both models achieved high accuracies on the training\ndata set: 99.86% for the SVM and 98.08% for the MD. All incorrect cases in\nunsupervised predictions are listed in Table 2. The only\nincorrect prediction by the SVM is sample NC_016996.1, which is isolated from an\navian species but was predicted to infect humans. Among all 14 incorrect\npredictions by MD, bats are the common predicted hosts. No sample was\nincorrectly predicted by both models.\n\nThe trained models were applied to 47 additional samples, and the predictions\nunveiled clues regarding potential interspecies transmission (See Table 3). Sequences 1\u201331 comprise spike genes\nof coronaviruses that were primarily isolated from palm civets from restaurants,\nanimal markets, or farms in southern China when SARS wreaked havoc in 2003. The\nsequences of these coronaviruses (civet-CoVs) are similar not only to each other\nbut also to SARS-CoV. Cross-host evolution research of SARS-CoV in palm civet\nand humans indicated that the variations in spike genes seemed to be essential\nfor the transition of coronavirus from animal-to-human transmission to\nhuman-to-human transmission25. In addition to\ncross-neutralization with SARS-CoV, these SARS-like civet-CoVs can use human\nACE2 as an entry receptor26. Bats are the reservoir hosts of a\nnumber of coronaviruses, and a recent study also suggests that bats are natural\nreservoirs of these SARS-like coronaviruses, whereas palm civets and humans are\nintermediate hosts1. All hosts predicted by the SVM are humans,\nwhich supports the previously mentioned research. The MD identified both bats\nand humans as hosts of these samples, but bats are the preferable hosts for\nsamples 1\u201326 and the second choice for samples 27\u201331.\nThis finding is also expected as bats are considered to be natural hosts of\nthese viruses.\n\nSequences 32\u201340 comprise spike genes of MERS-CoVs from dromedaries\nafter the outbreak in the Middle East in 2012. MERS-CoVs are similar to the bat\ncoronaviruses HKU5 and HKU4 in their amino acid sequences27, and\nthey can use human DPP4 as an entry receptor28. MERS-CoVs was\nassumed to originate from HKU5 in pipistrelle, which is a type of Japanese\nbat3. In our study, these MERS-CoVs isolated from camels were\npredicted to be capable of infecting humans; and bats are also likely hosts next\nto humans in predictions by MD. This result is obviously consistent with above\nspeculations, and also supports the WHO advices about avoiding close contact\nwith camels (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_07_23_mers/en/).\n\nThe 41st sample was a SARS-associated coronavirus that was transmitted from human\nto pig29, and both SVM and MD detected its threat to humans. Bat\nand avian might be potential hosts since both models suggest that they are more\nvulnerable than porcine. Samples 42\u201344 (RsSHC014, Rs3367 and\nSL-CoV-WIV1) consist of three SARS-like coronaviruses from bats30. Analyses based on the sequence similarities and cultures in the cell lines\nsuggest that Rs3367 and SL-CoV-WIV1 are capable of using a SARS-CoV receptor for\ncell entry and pose a threat to humans, whereas RsSHC014 cannot30. Our study provides a precise support to these conclusions. The MD correctly\npredicts bats as the natural hosts of the three viruses, and the SVM indicates\nthat Rs3367 and SL-CoV-WIV1 are harmful to humans.\n\nThe 45th sample was isolated from an alpaca by Jin et al. in 2007 with a\nserotype of bovine; the phylogenetic analysis suggests that it shares the same\nancestor with bovine-coronaviruses31. Our analysis supports the\nfinding that this coronavirus is capable of infecting bovine. These analyses\nimply that this strain is capable of interspecies transmission between bovines\nand alpacas. Samples 46 and 47 are enteric coronaviruses from bovines and\nhumans; they have been identified as the same strain named \u201cHuman\nenteric coronavirus 4408\u201d in the NCBI database due to the similarity\nbetween their spike protein sequences of 99.9%. Although they are similar to the\nhuman coronavirus OC43 and the bovine coronavirus, evidences from morphological,\nimmunological, and genomic studies indicate that they are closer to bovine\ncoronavirus than to human coronavirus (unpublished research, from personal\ncommunication). This finding is consistent with our analysis. In addition, avian\nand bat are worthy of attentions as potential hosts due to the small MD\nvalues.\n\nTwo groups of two-dimensional data are plotted in Fig. 1.\nThe blue points represent a \u201cloose\u201d population with a\nlarger standard deviation (SD) of N(1, 1), and the red points represent a\n\u201ctight\u201d population with a smaller SD of N(3.5,\n0.5). The red line separates the two groups classified by the MD, and the groups\npredicted by the SVM are delimited by the blue line. In this figure, two\nindividuals (the red triangles between the two lines) from the\n\u201ctight\u201d population were classified into the\n\u201cloose\u201d group by the MD, whereas the SVM accidentally\nexcluded four points (the blue reversed triangles between the two lines) from\nthe \u201cloose\u201d population. This example shows that MD and\nSVM have inverse tendencies in some cases, i.e., when a\n\u201cloose\u201d population is close to a\n\u201ctight\u201d population, MD intends to classify outliers of\nthe \u201ctight\u201d population into the former. The opposite\nsituation is valid for the SVM.\n\nNucleotide composition analysis revealed the overrepresentation of CpA and TpG\ndinucleotides and the suppression of CpG dinucleotides (see Supplementary Table S1), which indicates that\ncoronaviruses generally prefer motifs that contain CpAs and TpGs and avoid CpGs in\nsequences. These dinucleotide biases are common characteristics of RNA viruses in\nvertebrates11121516. As most vertebrates exhibit a very low\nCpG representation in genomes, RNA viruses may gradually adapt to the accumulation\nof host mutations and mimic the host gene\u2019s dinucleotide patterns for\nsurvival11. For DNA viruses, the most-accepted mechanisms for the\nsuppression of CpG dinucleotides are the methylation of CpG nucleotides and the\nsubsequent deamination of 5-methylcytosine, which renders CpG a mutational\nhotspot24. For RNA viruses, a different hypothesis is that the\nRNA viruses encounter different selection pressures when they switch to a new host,\nand viral RNA genes mimic host mRNAs to avoid immune detection11.\nSimilar to other human ssRNA viruses, coronaviruses show a strong correlation\nbetween CpG pressure and C+G content (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient,\nr = 0.5443,\np < 2.2e-16, our data). A lower C+G content\nusually indicates that the nucleotide sequence of the virus is unstable or is highly\nvariable under evolutionary selection pressure. Considering that the mutation rates\nfor RNA viruses are significantly higher than the mutation rates for DNA\nviruses32, mutational pressure may be the most important\ndeterminant of the bias in codon usage in human RNA viruses, such as\ncoronaviruses14.\n\nThe capabilities to bind with receptors and to replicate in host cells are essential\nfor any virus to infect hosts. Different genes contribute to these biological\nprocesses. Variations on these genes may enable a virus to transmit cross-species.\nOne famous example would be the polymerase 2 (PB2) of influenza A virus, in which\namino acid change from E to K at its 627th position would render the virus to\nreplicate in mammalian cells333435. In coronaviruses, the spike\nprotein is functionally associated with recognition of hosts and the RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase (RdRp) is related to proliferation of virus. However, there are two\nobstacles limiting the use of RdRp gene: (1) The similarities among nucleotide\nsequences is too high to train MD model, i.e., the variation rate of RdRp sequence\nis slower and cannot provide enough resolution to discriminate different\ncoronaviruses; (2) Even worse, available full-length CDSs in public databases are\nvery limited \u2014 only 23 or so. On the contrary, the spike gene perfectly\nsatisfied the requirements for variation rate and availability, therefore was\nadopted as markers in this study.\n\nMD and SVM show opposite tendencies in judging outliers (See Fig.\n1), which reflects the different principles of the two classification\napproaches. Unlike the Euclidian distance (ED), which measures the absolute distance\nbetween points or mass centres in space, the Mahalanobis distance considers the\nvariances within a population and the covariance between variables. In some cases,\nespecially when a population with individuals who are scattered across a wide range\nis located close to a \u201ctight\u201d population with smaller\ninternal variations, the MD may classify marginal individuals from the latter into\nthe \u201cloose\u201d population even if they are\n\u201cclose\u201d to a \u201ctight\u201d population\naccording to the ED. The MD enables \u201cloose\u201d populations to\nhave a greater number of points. The SVM has a different philosophy. SVM separates\npopulations by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the distances between\npopulations. When a \u201cloose\u201d population is close to the\nboundary of a \u201ctight\u201d population, SVM is more likely to find\nthis hyperplane within the former. This finding explains SVM\u2019s tendency\nto exclude outliers from a \u201cloose\u201d population.\n\nBats are the reservoir hosts of a number of coronaviruses that can survive in bats\nand accumulate variations in the long evolutionary process13637.\nThus, coronaviruses in bats constitute a \u201cloose\u201d population\nwith larger internal gaps. We assume that some strains of viruses in bats gain\nsufficient variation to enable them to infect other organisms; these viruses form a\nnew \u201ctight\u201d population at the edge of the original group. In\nthis case, the MD emphasizes the connection of a virus with the original source,\nwhereas the SVM may be more sensitive to the possibility of infecting new hosts.\nTherefore, the incorporation of analyses using the MD and SVM can be especially\nhelpful for revealing the profile of interspecies transmission.\n\nAccording to the predictions by MD, bats are not only the hosts in all 14 incorrect\ncases from training data set (See Table 2), but also in the\nhost list of each coronaviruses for testing (See Table 3).\nFurthermore, bats were predicted to host of 64.02% training samples isolated from\nother hosts (See Table 1). These facts convincingly support\nthe notion that these viruses originated from bats and shifted to other hosts.\n\nNext to bats, avians could be infected by 36.64% samples from other hosts. If bats\nare the only reservoir hosts and coronaviruses spread from bats to avians and other\nanimals, according to the stochastic event model, the probability of co-infectivity\nto both bat and avian can be the product of the infectivity probabilities to each of\nthem, i.e., 0.3494 (0.5164 \u00d7 0.6767, see Table 1), then 255\n(0.3494 \u00d7 730) samples are expected to be of\nco-infectivity. However, only 173 samples were predicted to be of co-infectivity to\nbats and avians. So avians might be the second independent source of coronavirus in\nparallel to bats. If this speculation is true, people will have to maintain\nvigilance to avian coronaviruses apart from avian influenza viruses. Especially, due\nto the high accuracy of the SVM in cross-validation, we should seriously consider\nits only \u201cwrong\u201d prediction: perhaps it is sensible to\ninvestigate whether the NC_016996.1 virus from avian is capable of infecting\nhumans.\n\nFor the viruses that are capable of spreading across a host species barrier, the\ncombination of the MD and the SVM is valuable for assessing their potential threat.\nThe origin and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses have been extensively\ndiscussed in the past ten years, and the coronaviruses of most mammals are believed\nto originate from their ancestors in bats13637. Our analysis with\ndual statistical models support the finding that SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs spread from\nbats to humans and other animals. In most cases, our approach provided convincing\npredictions. The dual-model approach can be expected to become a useful tool in\nfuture studies. Typically, when a novel coronavirus is isolated, the combination of\nthe MD and the SVM may provide meaningful hints regarding its origin and potential\nthreat to humans or other animals. As soon as more virus genomes are sequenced, this\napproach can be applied to investigate the interspecies transmission route of other\nthreatening viruses, including the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nAll genome sequences and complete coding sequences (CDSs) of spike genes were\ndownloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)\ndatabase (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) on July 17, 2014. Sequences of\nspike genes were extracted from the 1044 coronavirus genomes and pooled with\n1380 downloaded CDSs. Then, we removed replicate sequences and sequences that\ncontained non-standard bases or were incapable of coding complete products. The\nlength of each sequence is longer than 3,000 bases. Among all 777 valid\nnucleotide sequences that are listed in Supplementary Data S1, 730 sequences fall into six categories\naccording to different hosts: 196 for humans, 182 for porcines, 77 for bovines,\n74 for bats, 28 for murines and 173 for avians. The majority of the remaining 47\nviruses were isolated from the two epidemic diseases caused by the coronavirus\nin the past 12 years. Although we only listed the hosts from which they were\nisolated, these viruses have been verified or suspected to have the ability to\ninfect different hosts; thus, all 47 sequences were employed to explore\ninterspecies transmission of coronaviruses. Viruses from other mammals,\nincluding canines, felines, rabbits, equines, alpacas and whales, were excluded\nfrom the data set as the number of spike sequences for each host is insufficient\nfor establishing a separate group.\n\nThe mononucleotide frequencies and dinucleotide biases of the spike sequences\nwere computed using our original Python scripts. Dinucleotide bias is the ratio\nof the observed value to the expected frequency of each of the 16 dinucleotides:\n, where  is\nthe dinucleotide bias, fXY is the frequency of\ndinucleotide XY, fX and fY are\nthe frequencies of nucleotide X and nucleotide Y38,\nrespectively.\n\nIn this study, we considered 19 factors, including three mononucleotide\nfrequencies (G, C and T) and 16 dinucleotide biases. As none of the frequencies\nhas a normal distribution, the nonparametric \u201cKruskal-Wallis\nTest\u201d was employed to investigate the difference in each factor\namong six categories. As a result, significant differences across categories\nwere detected for each factor; thus, all 19 factors were employed for\nmodelling.\n\nAs a classifier, the SVM can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using\na kernel technique that is rooted in structural risk minimization. In this\nstudy, the R package e1071 (Version: 1.6\u20133)20 was\nemployed for the SVM analysis. \u201cC-classification\u201d was\nadopted as the model type and \u201cRadial\u201d was adopted as\nthe SVM kernel in our analysis. The MD is a measure of the distance from a point\nto the centre of a distribution; the principle of this discriminant is that\nindividuals belong to the closest group in the distance. The MD is defined as\n, where X denotes the population,\nx denotes the individual, \u03bc is the mean value of\nthe population, T denotes the matrix transpose, and  denotes the covariance matrix of population39. The R program\n\u201cdistinguish.distance.R\u201d40 was\nemployed in the MD analysis. Leave-one-out cross-validation was employed for\nboth SVM and MD analyses.\n\nWhen the trained models are applied to a sequence for testing, each of the six\ncategories of hosts will obtain a p value from SVM and a MD value. Based\non p values and MD values, three steps will be taken to determine\ncandidate hosts. First, the host of minimal p value or MD value is\nreasonably regarded as the preferable host. Then, two adjustable empirical\nthresholds can be used for each model to pick out other potential hosts. In this\nstudy, we adopted 0.05 and 0.01 for p value, 200 and 100 for MD value;\ni.e., likely hosts were determined if\np <= 0.05 or\nMD <= 200, and very likely hosts were defined by\np <= 0.01 or\nMD <= 100. The two steps are unsupervised\nprediction. In case that the isolate source is among the six host groups for\nmodelling, a supervised prediction can be applied as the third step, i.e., all\nhost species with p values or MD values no more than those of the\nobserved host will be listed as potential hosts, which can be practical\nreferences for researchers to evaluate a virus\u2019s threats to human or\nother animals.\n\nTwo groups of two-dimensional vectors were generated in silico as two\npopulations. The number of vectors in the first population are randomly\ngenerated from the normal distribution N(1, 1), and the number of vectors\nin the second population are randomly generated from N(3.5, 0.5). As the\nfirst population has a larger standard deviation (SD), we refer to it as the\n\u201cloose\u201d population and refer to the second population as\nthe \u201ctight\u201d population. The two groups of data are\nemployed for the leave-one-out cross-validations of MD and SVM.\n\nAll Python and R scripts employed in this study are available from the authors\nupon request. The prediction can be performed using the spike gene sequences of\nthe coronaviruses on our web server, which is available to the public at no cost\nat http://bioinfo.ihb.ac.cn/seq2hosts.\n\nHow to cite this article: Tang, Q. et al.
