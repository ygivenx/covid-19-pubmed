{"title": "Lithium chloride confers protection against viral myocarditis via suppression of coxsackievirus B3 virus replication", "body": "Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a disorder that affects the myocardiocytes following a viral infection and can progress into dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in young adults [1] . Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a member of the Enterovirus genus of Picornaviridae, is wellidentified as the dominant etiological factor causing viral myocarditis. It was reported that about 25-27% cases of dilated cardiomyopathy and VMC in young adults and children were caused by CVB3 [2, 3] . Although type-I interferon is reported to have certain therapeutic effect, the treatment or vaccine has been successful in treating CVB3 infection and myocarditis [4, 5] .\n\nLithium chloride (LiCl) is applied as a psychotropic anti-depressant agent in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders since its approval by the FDA in 1949 [6] . Cumulative evidence suggests that LiCl participates in many cellular processes, such as cell gene expression, apoptosis, proliferation, oncogenesis, glycogen synthesis and inflammation. So LiCl has been explored for treating diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and ovarian cancer, as well as antimicrobial infection [7] . Prior investigations have also revealed that LiCl exhibits antiviral effects on certain viruses, e.g., coronavirus, herpes simplex, infectious bronchitis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and feline calicivirus [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Given that there are few reports about the influence of LiCl on the enteroviruses infections and it's rarely studied to evaluate the antiviral potential of LiCl in viral infection models based on animals, it's of high significance to examine the effect of LiCl on CVB3 infections and virus-induced viral myocarditis in mice.\n\nTherefore, we studied the antiviral effects of LiCl in HeLa cells and in CVB3-infected mouse. The results indicate that LiCl acts as a potential antiviral agent to significantly inhibit CVB3 replication through decreasing virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment could markedly suppress the cardiac virus replication and alleviate the progress of myocarditis in mice, which might expand LiCl's new application in virus-induced inflammatory diseases. \n\nAbout 6-8 weeks-old male BALB/c mice (16-18g) were obtained from (Shanghai Slac Animal Inc.). All mice were handled in conformity with the institutional guidelines of Soochow University were approved by the Ethics Committee. Professor Yingzhen Yang (Key Laboratory of Viral Heart Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University) provided the CVB3-eGFP and CVB3 (Nancy strain). They were tittered by TCID 50 assay on HeLa cells. HeLa and 293T celllines were bought from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and maintained as detailed before [17] . LiCl (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in DMEM and sterilized through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter.\n\nHeLa or 293T cells were added into 96-well plate with LiCl which had been diluted with DMEM (without serum) for 48 h. Six wells were mock treated as control. At the end of the incubation period, 20 \u03bcl of CKK8 solution and 80 \u03bcl of DMEM were put into every well, followed by incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. OD 450 was calculated using a microplate reader and the relative cell viability values were calculated as (mean OD 450 LiCl)/(mean OD 450 control) \u00d7 100%.\n\nThe detailed protocol of RNA isolation, RT-PCR and primer sequences used were detailed in a previous report [16] .\n\nCell apoptosis analysis was performed by staining cells with staining Annexin V-FITC kit (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Briefly, cells were infected CVB3 (MOI = 10) and then were treated with LiCl for 24 h. They were then recovered and washed two times using cold PBS and were staining with Annexin V for 15min. 7-AAD was then added for 5 min at room temperature (RT). The number of Annexin V + apoptotic cells was analyzed with FlowJo v10.0 software (Tree Star) after processing on a Canto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience).\n\nSDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously [16, 17] . The proteins extracted from HeLa cells or heart tissues were detected with anti-VP1 (Clone 5-D8/1, DAKO, Denmark).\n\nAbout 6-8 weeks-old male BALB/c mice (16-18g) received an intraperitoneal injection of 1500 TCID 50 (1050 pfu) dose of CVB3. The body weight and survival of mice were measured at the end of the test. After 3 and 7 days following infection, heart tissues were obtained for the detection of histology analysis, virus RNA and cytokines. The details of histology tests are as described before [17] . Severity of myocarditis was evaluated from five sections per heart by using a 1 to 5 scoring system: grade 0, no inflammation; grade 1, less than 10% of the heart section is involved; grade 2, 10-30%; grade 3, 30-50%; grade 4, 50-90%; grade 3, more than 90%. To evaluate the effect of LiCl on viral myocarditis, each mouse was infected intraperitoneally with CVB3 after which they were divided into two groups (8-10 mice/group), PBS and LiCl treatments. Considering the effective dose of LiCl in cells (10-50 mM), the fraction of drug absorbance through i.p. approximately 60% and the bodyweight of the mice, LiCl (100 \u03bcL, 50 mM/per mouse) were daily applied to mice i.p. upon infection.\n\nImmunohistochemistry was performed to assess cardiac levels of cleaved caspase-3 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mouse and Rabbit Specific HRP/DAB Detection IHC Kit, ab64264, Abcam). Briefly, the paraffin sections of hearts were incubated with primary antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (1:250, Cat. No. 9664, Cell Signaling Technology) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing, sections were stained with Biotinylated Goat Anti-Polyvalent for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated with Streptavidin Peroxidase and DAB Substrate. Stained sections were imaged with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope and five images were captured under high power fields (100\u00d7 magnifications) randomly.\n\nGraphPad Prism software was utilized to analyzed data from the tests. All results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD or SEM. Experiments are repeated at least three times independently. The survival rate was analyzed using survival curves generated from the Kaplan-Meier tool with the Lonrank test. Student's t-test was applied to compare two group. P values, 0.05 \u2265 P > 0.01; **, 0.01 \u2265 P > 0.001; ***, P \u2264 0.01 were considered statistically significant.\n\nAs previously reported, 10-60 mM was applied as nontoxic concentration range of LiCl for antiviral effect in F81 cells [14] . So we firstly detected the cytotoxicity of LiCl in CVB3-replicated HeLa or 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, cell viability was > 90% in LiCl at 10-50 mM doses for 72 h. It has reported that LiCl could affect cell apoptosis in several tumor cell-lines. So we next analyzed the LiCl's effect on the apoptosis of HeLa or 293T cells by staining Annexin V and 7-AAD. The result of the flow cytometry revealed that compared with control, LiCl at concentrates of 30 mM and 50 mM could not induce cell apoptosis in HeLa or 293T (Fig. 1C) . Therefore, we chose the concentration of 50 mM as the maximum concentration of LiCl for antiviral experiments.\n\nTo explore the antiviral effect of LiCl on CVB3 infection, CVB3-eGFP (MOI = 10) was used to infect HeLa cells followed by treatment with a series of doses of LiCl (30 and 50 mM). As shown in Fig. 2A , a large number of GFP + cells, which reflect virus replication, were observed upon CVB3-eGFP infection, while LiCl treatment could significantly reduce the number of GFP + cells. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed it and revealed that LiCl treatment decreased the GFP fluorescence after CVB3 infection, implying LiCl could inhibit CVB3 replication (Fig. 2B) . Next, we measured the caspid protein level of VP-1 by Western blot and viral RNA expression by Q-PCR. These results showed that both viral RNA and VP-1 protein levels were obviously decreased by LiCl treatment (Fig. 2C and D) , suggesting LiCl could potentially restrict CVB3 replication in HeLa cells.\n\nWe firstly evaluated the influence of LiCl on CVB3 attachment to HeLa cells. LiCl of different doses (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mM) were mixed with CVB3, after which the mixture was added into cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Subsequent to changing the medium and PBS-wash, cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 24 h and were analyzed by Q-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that the viral RNA level and VP-1 expression were not altered after treatment with LiCl ( Fig. 3A and B ). Next to rule out the effect of LiCl on viral entry, HeLa cells were infected with CVB3 together with LiCl treatment followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Subsequent to changing the media, HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and then used to carry out Western blot and Q-PCR and. As shown in Fig. 3C and D, we did not observe any significant difference in levels of viral RNA and capsid protein VP-1 observed between LiCl-and mocktreated groups. All these results implied that LiCl treatment has no influence on CVB3 attachment and entry into cells.\n\nCVB3 infection could induce cell apoptosis and LiCl is reported to be involved with several tumor cell apoptosis. So we intended to explore the impact of LiCl on virus-induced cell apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4A , LiCl treatment had no effect on the apoptosis in normal HeLa cells but CVB3 infection could significantly induce cell apoptosis (21.4% Annexin V + ). Notably, LiCl treatment obviously decreased CVB3-induced cell apoptosis (8.85% Annexin V + ). The result of absolute number of Annexin V positive cells was consistent with above ( Fig. 4B) , suggesting LiCl could protect cells against virus-induced apoptosis. \n\nNext we establish CVB3-induced myocarditis in mice to evaluate antiviral effect of LiCl on the viral infections in vivo. LiCl was applied daily to the mice after infection, after which we analyzed myocarditis and cardiac viral replication. It was found that the bodyweight loss and survival rate of mice were markedly improved in mice treated with LiCl ( Fig. 5A and B) . As expected, the viral RNA level was obviously decreased in hearts of mice after LiCl treatment (Fig. 5C ). LiCl treatment also significantly decreased the activity of serum creatine kinase (CK) and echocardiographic measurements showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were markedly increased after treated with LiCl, which suggested that LiCl could obviously improve the cardiac function ( Fig. 5D and E). Consistently, HE staining analysis displayed that control mice showed severe myocarditis with necrotic lesions and inflammation, LiCl treatment significantly alleviated myocarditis with less inflammatory foci and necrosis ( Fig. 5F and G) . IHC analysis showed that LiCl treatment decreased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 within the myocardium, which further supported that LiCl inhibit virus-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis (Fig. 5H) .To further verify the role of LiCl on the inflammation within the myocardium, we analyzed the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hearts by Q-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5E , the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly decreased after LiCl injection while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was slightly increased with LiCl treatment (Fig. 5I) . Thus, these results indicated that LiCl could significantly suppress CVB3 replication and inhibit the virusinduced inflammation in vivo.\n\nThe anti-depressant drug lithium is a well-known Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for nearly 60 years. Accumulating evidence suggests that LiCl have diversity of functions on physiological and pathological processes, including cancerogenic or anti- cancerogenic properties, immune-stimulatory and immunosuppressive functions [6, 7] . There are several studies exploring the roles of LiCl on virus infection and suggesting that LiCl inhibit certain virus replication, such as transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, HIV, canine parvovirus, PRRSV and so on [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In this study, we demonstrate that LiCl can also restrict CVB3 infection in vivo and in vitro.\n\nCumulative evidence indicates that LiCl acts as an agonist to enhance Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and inhibits the glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) pathway through competition for Mg 2+ [18, 19] . GSK3\u03b2 regulates a wide range of cellular functions, including protein translation, cell cycle, development and apoptosis. GSK3\u03b2 regulates apoptosis in a variety of cell types [20, 21] . It is well-known that interferon (IFN) pathway plays a key role on virus replication and GSK3\u03b2 is also reported to regulate IFN-\u03b2 production. However, CVB3 has evolved mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response by directly cleaving MDA5 and MAVS. We also explored the effect of LiCl on IFN production upon CVB3 infection and found that the expression of IFN was not altered by CVB3 infection in HeLa cells and LiCl treatment also did not influence the IFN expression. Besides, we also checked type-I interferon responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages after CVB3 stimulation. We found that IFN-\u03b2 production was induced by CVB3 and inhibited after LiCl treatment, which cannot explain LiCl's antiviral effect on CVB3 infection. Moreover, it seems that IFN-\u03b2 inhibition induced by LiCl in immune cells also apply to other virus or stimuli. We found similar result in Sendai virus (SeV) infected peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Wang et al. also reported similar phenotype. They found that, in macrophages, LiCl attenuated IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN regulatory factor 3 activation induced by LPS-, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-, and SeV, but this is in a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2independent manner [22] .\n\nGSK3\u03b2 was reported to induce apoptosis in neuron cells and fibroblasts, but recent studies have suggested that the role of GSK3\u03b2 on apoptosis is complicated [23, 24] . It has been suggested that CVB3 can induce apoptosis in infected cells, which contributes direct cytopathic effect [24] . VMC is caused by the direct virus-infected cardiomyocyte injury via necrosis and apoptosis, and virus-induced inflammatory responses [1] . Apoptosis has been suggested to facilitate viral progeny and spread [25, 26] . In 2005, J Yuan et al. reported that CVB3 infection activated GSK3\u03b2 pathway and inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 suppressed CVB3induced CPE and apoptosis via stabilizing \u03b2-catenin [27] . Consistently, our results also demonstrated that LiCl treatment could significantly inhibit CVB3-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells.\n\nSo far, the antiviral properties of LiCl in viral infected-animal model have not been fully explored. We deeply explore the role of LiCl on viral myocarditis in mouse and revealed that LiCl treatment could markedly restrict virus replication in heart tissues and alleviate the inflammation within the myocardium. Here, we report that LiCl restricts the replication of CVB3 through inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis, thus expanding the range of LiCl targets to CVB3. Moreover, we also confirm the antiviral potential of LiCl in hearts of VMC mice and demonstrated that LiCl potently protects mice against CVB3-induced myocarditis, indicating a therapeutic target of LiCl in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe animal experiments were performed in accordance with Soochow University institutional guidelines, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Soochow University in written form. Euthanasia of mice was performed by carbon dioxide inhalation with minimum fear, anxiety and pain. "}
