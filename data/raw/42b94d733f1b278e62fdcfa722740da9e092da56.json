{"title": "Bacteriological and clinical efficacy of various antibiotics used in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis in Italy. An epidemiological study", "body": "Pharyngotonsillitis is reported to be caused by many viruses and bacteria; among them, group A bhaemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most frequent bacterial cause. About 30% of children with sore-throat have a positive culture for this organism and antibiotic treatment is recommended [1, 2] . Rhinovrius, adenovirus and coronavirus are responsible for the other 70% [3] .\n\nAcute pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A bhaemolytic streptococci is often clinically indistinguishable from a viral infection; therefore an accurate microbiological investigation is important. In untreated group A infection the organism can persist and cause serious suppurative and non-suppurative complications\n\nThe aim of antibiotic therapy should therefore be not only clinical cure but also bacteriological eradication.\n\nPenicillins are still generally considered the drugs of choice [4] , but they have been found to fail in eradicating group A streptococci in 5-30% of children with streptococcal pharingotonsilitis, even though the isolated strains were shown to be susceptible. Recently it has been demonstrated [5] that some group A strepto-coccal strains can enter respiratory epithelial cells, where they became inaccessible to those antibiotics unable to penetrate the cell membrane, such as penicillins. These findings and the increasing incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamidia pneumoniae as pathogens have favoured the spread of macrolide use [1, 6] . Erythromycin has been the principal alternative for penicillin-allergic patients [7, 8] .\n\nLess than 5% of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates are generally reported as resistant to macrolide antibiotics [9, 10] . A marked increase in the incidence of resistant strains has been reported in a limited number of countries, namely Australia [11] , Finland [12] , Sweden [13] , the UK [14] , Japan [15, 16] and Taiwan [17] .\n\nFrom the late eighties an appreciable resistance to macrolides has also been described in Italy in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and scarlet fever [18] [19] [20] [21] . A recent national survey confirmed a dramatic increase in macrolide resistance in most areas of the country [22] . In 1993, the incidence of macrolide resistance was 5.1%, rising to 25.9% in 1995 with some centres showing peaks of 30 -40%. Other Italian studies in the 1990 s showed similar results [23, 24] .\n\nThere are two recognized mechanisms of resistance to macrolide antibiotics in streptococci: target modification and an efflux system. These mechanisms give rise to three possible phenotypes: constitutive, inducible and the so called newly resistant or M phenotype. In strains exhibiting the constitutive and inducible phenotype, resistance is due to the methylation of the bacterial ribosome; M phenotype isolates are found to have an efflux system for 14 and 15 membered macrolides, apparently distinct from the efflux system described for erythromycin-resistant staphylococci [25, 26] .\n\nThe aim of this study was to follow up children with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis treated with antibiotics chosen freely by their paediatricians and to evaluate both clinical cure and microbiological efficacy of different therapies. Clinical cure and bacteriological eradication were determined and their correlation evaluated. In order to distinguish failed eradication from recolonization after treatment; all strains isolated before and at follow up were genotyped.\n\nThe study was planned as an open multicentre clinicalmicrobiological study to evaluate susceptibility of Streptococcus b-haemolytic Group A (S. pyogenes), isolated from pharyngeal swabs in children with acute pharyngotonsillitis, aged from 3 to 14 years.\n\nA total of 23 Italian microbiological centres (local microbiological centres) and 123 community paediatri-cians were involved. Patients who had received antibiotic therapy during the 2 weeks prior to the study were excluded.\n\nWe aimed to include at least 500 paediatric patients with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis who had pharyngeal cultures before and after antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe investigation was co-ordinated by the Neonatal Pathology Department of Pavia University and by the Microbiology Institute of Milan University.\n\nDuring the first visit, the patient's paediatrician would complete a case-report-form where history, signs and symptoms of the suspected infection and the prescribed antibiotic therapy would be registered. Clinical diagnosis of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis would be established taking into account the Breese score [27] . Antibiotic therapy would be chosen freely by the physician. A pharyngeal swab was taken before any therapy and, together with the case-report form, sent to the local microbiological centre for culture. The isolated strains were stored in glycerol at \u2212 80\u00b0C and sent to the Central Laboratory. If the microbiological culture was negative, the antibiotic therapy was stopped.\n\nIf culture was positive for group A streptococci, a second visit 7-10 days after the last day of antibiotic treatment was organized and the paediatrician would complete a second case-report-form with details of antibiotic therapy and clinical evaluation of the case. A second pharyngeal swab would be taken and sent to the local microbiological centre for identification.\n\nClinical judgement would be used to describe the patient as clinically cured, improved or exhibiting treatment failure. The patients were said to be clinically cured if all symptoms had disappeared at follow-up, improved if one symptom even if minor, except for fever, was still present and classified as treatment failure if fever or more than one symptom were still present.\n\nAt the local microbiology centre, streptococcal strains were isolated, identified and disc susceptibility test to various antibiotics performed. The strains, labeled with coded identification numbers and stored in plates or frozen at \u2212 20\u00b0C (in Brain-Heart-Infusion broth added with glycerol 8%), were sent every 15 days to the central laboratory, with the case-report-forms. At the central laboratory all strains were re-identified, and the MIC determined to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, rokitamycin, josamycin, spiramycin, clindamycin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, cefotaxime and tetracycline. The phenotypes of the erythromycin resistant strains were determined and genotypes of all isolates of cases positive at follow-up, in order to distinguish between non-eradication and recolonization.\n\nPharyngeal swabs were immediately cultured on Columbia CNA-based blood agar plates containing 5% sheep blood (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). Strain identification was performed with bacitracin discs (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) and by either a latex agglutination assay (Streptex, Wellcome, Dartford, UK) or a latex-agglutination grouping kit (StreptoSlide, Dioesse Diagnostica Senese Srl).\n\nThe susceptibility of S. pyogenes isolates was initially evaluated by a disc diffusion method, according to the NCCLS Performance Standard 1995 [28] . All antibiotic discs were supplied by Oxoid (Unipath, Basingstoke) except for azithromycin and rokitamycin (Becton Dickinson, Meylan, France).\n\nThe strains were reidentified at the central microbiology laboratory by the method already described.\n\nMinimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined by the microdilution method described in the NCCLS guidelines 1995 [29] . Cation adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (Difco) was used, supplemented with 2% lysed horse blood (Oxoid) and containing doubling dilutions of the antibiotic to be tested.\n\nThe streptococcal isolates were thawed, inoculated in BHI broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6-8 h to allow bacteria to reach an exponential growth phase. Cultures were then diluted to obtain a final bacterial inoculum of 10 5 CFU/ml in a total volume of 100 ml/well. S. pyogenes ATCC 10383 was used as control.\n\nThe MIC values were recorded following 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. The MIC was defined as the antibiotic concentration in the first well, i.e. the well with the lowest antibiotic concentration, that did not support visible growth. Test results were interpreted according to NC-CLS criteria [28] for those antibiotics for which breakpoints were available.\n\nThe macrolide-resistance phenotypes were determined for the erythromycin-resistant (ER) isolates by a modification of the method described by Seppala et al. [25] using two discs containing erythromycin (15 mg) and clindamycin (2 mg) discs (Oxoid). The discs were placed 7-10 mm apart on a blood agar plate (Mueller Hinton agar supplemented with 5% horse blood) inoculated with a bacterial suspension.\n\nFollowing overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the inhibition zone around the two discs was observed. Blunting of the clindamycin zone of inhibition proximal to the erythromycin disc indicated an inducible resistance (IR) phenotype. Resistance to both erythromycin and clindamycin, with no blunting of the clindamycin inhibition zone, indicated a constitutive resistance (CR) phenotype. The resistance phenotype described as the M phenotype was characterized by resistance to erythromycin and susceptibility to clindamycin with no blunting of the zone around the clindamycin disc.\n\nA bacterial culture (6 ml) of early stationary phase cells was pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, washed in 1 ml of PIV buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 8, 1 M NaCl), and resuspended in 200 ml of the same buffer. Concentrations were adjusted to an A 620 of 5 OD. This cell suspension was diluted 1:1 with 100 ml of 1.5% low-gelling-temperature agarose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in PIV buffer. Agarose discs of 20 ml were prepared and allowed to solidify for 5 min at \u2212 20\u00b0C. The cells were lysed by incubation of the discs at 37\u00b0C for 3 h in 1 ml of EC lysis buffer (6 mM TRIS, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl-ether and 0.5% sarkosyl) with 50 mg/l of RNAse A and 1 mg/ml of lysozyme (Sigma). The discs were incubated at 50\u00b0C for 17 h in ES buffer (0.5 M EDTA, pH 9) containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K; they were then washed four times with 14 ml of TE buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8), with gentle agitation for 1 h. The agarose discs were now considered to contain purified DNA and stored in TE at 4\u00b0C. Prior to electrophoresis, the agarose discs were allowed to equilibrate in 1 ml of restriction buffer (6 mM TRIS, pH 8, 20 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl 2 and 6 mM 2-mercrispectiveaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by restriction for 18 h at 25\u00b0C in 45 ml of restriction buffer containing bovine serum albumin (BSA; 100 mG/ml) and 480 U/ml SmaI (Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction was stopped with 10 ml of ES buffer and 5 ml of loading buffer.\n\nElectrophoresis gels were prepared using 1% agarose (Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5\u00d7 TBE buffer (44.5 mM TRIS-borate 1.25 mM EDTA). Discs containing the digested DNA were loaded in the gel and sealed with 0.75% low-gelling-temperature agarose. Two molecular-weight markers were used: lambda ladder (50-1000 kb) and low-range (0.1-200 kb) Pulsed Field Gel Markers (Sigma).\n\nPulse-field gel electrophoresis was performed using a Gene Navigator System apparatus (Pharmacia Biotech). The running conditions were 112 V for 40 h at 11.3\u00b0C. Pulse times were 20 s for 15 h, 35 s for 7 h, 50 s for 15 h and 90 s for the last 3 h. Gels were visualized and photographed following ethidium bromide staining under UV light.\n\nInterpretation of DNA restriction patterns generated by pulse-field gel electrophoresis used the guidelines proposed by Tenover et al. [30] . The DNA restriction pattern of isolates differing by more than three restriction fragments were considered to belong to different clonal types.\n\nPharyngeal swabs were positive for S. pyogenes in 1065 cases at first visit (baseline) and in 138 cases at second visit (follow-up).\n\nAntibiotic therapy was continued in all cases of positive pharyngeal swabs, using the paediatrician prescription for daily dosage and duration. Table 1 shows the number of strains isolated in the laboratories of the participating centres. Of the total 1065 baseline isolates, 813 (76.3%) were erythromycinsusceptible (ES) and 252 (23.7%) were erythromycin-resistant (ER). Of these, 80 (31.7%) were of CR phenotype, 67 (26.6%) of IR phenotype and 105 (41.7%) of M phenotype.\n\nAll strains, irrespective of their susceptibility to erythromycin, showed MICs to amoxycillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid and cefotaxime ranging from 5 0.0015 to 0.015 mg/l.\n\nMIC distribution for all other tested agents, expressed as cumulative percentages and subdivided according to the different susceptibility phenotypes, is reported in Table 2 . ES-strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, except to tetracycline to which 1.7% of these strains were found to be resistant. The 252 ER-strains were all susceptible to penicillins and cefotaxime, with variable tetracycline resistance. The 80 strains of CR phenotype were highly resistant to most Azithromycin and roxithromycin were non-active whilst clarithromycin was found to be active against a small percentage of strains belonging to the IR and M phenotypes.\n\nFor rokitamycin, although no breakpoints are available, susceptibility results showed MICs 5 1 mg/l for 37.8% of CR strains and MICs 50.5 mg/l for all IR and M phenotype.\n\nA higher incidence of ER-strains (Table 1 ) was registered at Pinerolo (81.8%), followed by Napoli (57.9%), Mantova (52.3%) and Catanzaro (50%); two centres (Abbiategrasso and Sondalo) did not isolate any resistant strains. Macrolide resistance over the Italian territory can thus be described as having a patchy distribution.\n\nOf the total 723 cases who presented at follow-up, 585 (80.9%) showed bacterial eradication and 138 (19.1%) were still positive. Table 3 reports clinical and bacteriological results following treatment with the major groups of antibiotics used in the treatment of these infections (713 patients). Penicillins and clarithromycin gave the best bacterial eradication results (88.4 and 85.3%, respectively) followed by amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid (83.6%) and oral cephalosporins (76.7%). Of the macrolides, eradication percentages ranged from 59.4% with rokitamycin to 85.3% with clarithromycin. The highest percentage of microbiological failures (40.6%) was registered with rokitamycin, with 8 of the 13 non-eradicated microorganisms (25%) having MICs 5 1 mg/l at baseline and after therapy. Table 4 shows bacterial eradication following macrolide treatment (for those agents with at least 30 evaluable patients) according to the susceptibility of the baseline isolate to erythromycin. Bacterial eradication of ES and ER baseline isolates was 92 and 60% following clarithromycin treatment; 83 and 37.5% following azithromycin and 56.5 and 66.7% with rokitamycin.\n\nThe phenotypes of ER isolates which were not eradicated following macrolide treatment were identical to those of baseline strains: this was for clarithromycin 7 CR, 2 IR and 3 phenotype M, for azithromycin 4 CR, 4 IR, and 2 phenotype M, for rokitamycin 1 CR, 2 IR and 1 phenotype M.\n\nInterestingly in the azithromycin treated group, four erythromycin susceptible strains at baseline (MICs= 0.12 mg/l) were not eradicated and became ER following treatment: three exhibiting phenotype M (MICs 4-8 mg/l) and one with IR phenotype (MIC\\ 128 mg/l).\n\nGenotype-identification of all strains isolated at baseline and at follow-up allowed us to distinguish noneradication from recolonization for each antibiotic treatment group; the results are reported in Table 5 . On the basis of genotyping it was found that all strains isolated at follow up belonging to the macrolides cefaclor, ceftibuten and ceftriaxone treated groups were confirmed 'true' failure of eradication. On the other hand for amoxycillin, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid, cefixime and cefuroxime axetil some cases of 'failed eradication' were shown to be due to recolonization with a different strain.\n\nConsidering the 1065 patients positive at baseline, recurrent episodes of pharyngotonsillitis had been reported in 330 cases, 145 in ear infections, four in rheumatic fever and 29 in other correlated symptoms. Presence of concomitant diseases had been reported in 98 cases. 125 patients had been treated with antibiotics in the last 30 days. 97.1% of patients were aged under 12 years while 2.9 aged over 12 years of age.\n\nA follow-up visit was performed after a mean period of 10 days from the end of antibiotic treatment.\n\nSymptoms of infection, such as fever (\\ 37\u00b0C) and sore throat were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up. Table 3 gives the major antibiotic therapies chosen by paediatricians, as well as the clinical and bacteriological results. Clinical cure was achieved in 87% of patients, improvement in 9.1% and failure in 1.1% of subjects irrespective of the antibiotic treatment that they had received; no data for clinical evaluation was available for 21 patients (2.9%). Table 5 gives details of microbiological evaluation. Clinical cure with penicillins ranged from 88.5% for amoxycillin+ clavulanic acid to 89.2% for penicillin, ampicillin and amoxycillin; with oral cephalosporins the clinical cure was achieved in 81.1% of patients and ranged from 78.3% with cefaclor to 80.6% with cefixime. For macrolides, clinical cure ranged from 84.4% with rokitamycin to 90.9% with clarithromycin.\n\nComplications of infection, such as adenitis or pharyngeal abscess, occurred in 10 cases and adverse events, usually affecting the skin and gastro-intestinal tract, in 11.\n\nThe aim of antibiotic therapy in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis should be not only clinical cure but, above all, bacteriological eradication, to avoid the rare but serious post-streptococcal sequelae.\n\nThis study has shown that erythromycin resistance rates in Italy are relatively high (23.7%) but not uniformly distributed over the national territory. The most common type of macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes was found to be due to the recently described efflux pump in streptococci [26] specific for 14 and 15 mem Clinical cure was achieved in a high percentage of cases, irrespective of the antibiotic prescribed. The best clinical efficacy was achieved following therapy with amoxycillin and clarithromycin (90.9%) with oral cephalosporins giving 81.1% clinical cure.\n\nBacterial eradication was similar for clarithromycin and penicillins (85.3 and 88.4% respectively) in spite of higher resistance rates of clarithromycin. Conversely rokitamycin which had a markedly better 'in vitro' activity with respect to the other macrolides tested showed the lowest eradication rates (59.4%).\n\nInterestingly, this study demonstrated that treatment with azithromycin was able to select resistance in strain of S. pyogenes. In four of 20 cases of failed eradication following azithromycin therapy it was found that the isolates had changed from being susceptible (MICs= 0.12 mg/l) to being resistant with phenotypes IR and M (MICs 4 ]128 mg/l) following therapy. In contrast in clarithromycin treated cases there was found to be no change in the susceptibility pattern of strains isolated before and after therapy.\n\nGenotyping of all strains isolated prior and after therapy also provided useful information concerning true bacterial eradication as it distinguished cases due to bacterial recolonization that would have otherwise been wrongly classified as microbiological failures. For example of the microbiological failures of cephalosporins such as cefixime (25.8%) and cefuroxime axetil (31.2%) recolonization after therapy was found to occur in 10 and 6%, respectively. In the case of macrolides however, microbiological failures were all confirmed to be due to failed bacterial eradication, as there were no cases of bacterial recolonization.\n\nGenerally some of the true failed bacterial eradication cases who had received therapy with b-lactam agents may be attributable to the presence of a recently described internalization gene [5] in group A streptococci.\n\nThe higher percentages of true failed eradication rates of amoxycillin+clavulanic acid with respect to those with amoxycillin therapy alone could either be due to the presence of the internalization gene in a higher proportion of isolates treated with the combination agent or to the poor compliance in view the poor taste of this formulation.We thank the Pediatricians and the local microbiologists who made possible the execution of this study: Table 5 Bacterial eradication versus recolonization on the basis of genotype identification of S. pyogenes strains isolated at baseline and follow-up "}
