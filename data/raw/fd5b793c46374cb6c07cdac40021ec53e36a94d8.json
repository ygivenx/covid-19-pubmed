{"title": "Archives of Virology Single Radial Haemolysis for the Determination of Antibody to Reoviruses Brief Report", "body": "Single radial haemolysis (SRH) was originally developed for measuring antibody to influenza (9, 10), but has been successfully applied to other haemagglutinating and non-haemagglutinating human viruses (2, 3, 5--7, 14, 15) . Quantitation of antibody to reoviruses in human and animal sera has been usually performed by H I or neutralization (11, 12) , CF being group-specific and of low sensitivity. In this paper we describe the detection of reovirus antibody by a newly developed SRIt technique, in comparison with HI and CF (13) .\n\nHuman O red blood cells (HRBC), without any coupling agent, were used. Freshly prepared \"aged\" chromium chloride-treated (1), gtutaraldehyde-stabilized (4) or \"aged\" chromium chloride-treated glutaraldehyde-stabilized HRBC (5) was no better than untreated ery~hrocytes. Sheep red blood cells, if treated with chromium chloride, could be substituted for ItRBC, but a few sera produced non-specific haemolysis, which never happened with HRBC. Reovirus type 1 (Lung), type 2 (D5 Jones) and type 3 (Abney) were grown on monotayers of monkey kidney cell lines (CV-t, LLC-MK, Vero) in serum-free Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium; the cells were disrupted by sonication. Antigen (HA titre 160) was mixed with an equal volume of 5 per cent ItRBC suspension in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes; the erythrocytes were then washed 3 times and resuspended at 5 per cent in PBS. Each empty ttyland immunoplate received a mixture of 0.3 ml antigen-coated HI~BC suspension, 0304-S608/81/0068/0309/$ 01.00 E. D'A~BI~OSlO, M. F. BATTAGLIA, and M. MIDULLA: 0.I ml normal guinea pig serum (as a source of complement), and 2.6 ml molten 1.5 per cent agates\u2022 (Indubiose A 37) in PBS (10) . Five F1 undiluted heat-inactivated serum was added to 2 m m wells a n d the plates were i n c u b a t e d overnight at 37 \u00b0 C: a clear haemolysis zone of ~>3 m m diameter was considered a positive reaction. Wells filled with PBS in re\u2022virus S R H plates, and plates prepared with H R B C incubated with s u p e r n a t a n t of sonieated uninoeulated cells served as negative controls.\n\nOf the 32 post-immunization samples from animals receiving a n y re\u2022virus type, a n t i b o d y response was detected b y CF in 24 (75.0 per cent), b y S R H in 26 (81.2 per cent) and b y H I in t00 per cent,. Table 1 shows that, the results with St{H were less specific t h a n those with H i l l e r example the sera of animals i m m u n i z e d with type 3 did not react by H I with type 1 or 2, but 3 of 5 reacted by S R H and CF. W h e n 68 r a n d o m l y selected h u m a n sera were tested (Table 1) , S R H detected, as for guinea pig sera, m a i n l y group-specific antibody, b u t was more sensitive t h a n CF. H I detected a n t i b o d y in 57 (83.8 per cent), SIgH in 36 (52.9 per cent), a n d CF in 17 (25.0 per cent.) sera. W h e n the haemolysis ring Type 1 b  5  4  3  2  5  5  0  3  3  1  0  0  Type 2 b  2  3  3  5  5  5  0  3  3  0  0  0  Type 3 b  3  3  3  4  5  5  5  3  3  0  0  0 Each group of 5 animals was inoculated intranasally (8) with live re\u2022virus type 1, type 2, or type 3. Sera were drawn after 5 and 6 weeks; results were identical except that SIgH zones were slightly larger at 6 weeks b These animals were sere-positive by HI against type 2 before inoculation diameters were plotted against CF titres (Fig. 1 ) , a good correlation was observed between the two techniques; similar results (not shown) were obtained for guinea pig sera. It, is n o t clear why the a n t i b o d y response b y SRH, using haemagglutin a t i n g antigen attached to RBC, appears different from t h a t measured b y H I --u s i n g influenza virus the results are very similar though anti-neuraminidase a n t i b o d y can be detected as well as III. Since all sera were pre-treated with kaolin, it is unlikely t h a t H I was detecting non-specific inhibitors.\n\nS R H is nevertheless a useful technique for work with reoviruses. I t is simple, uses small quantities of heat-inactivated serum, without need for dilutions, a n d is easy to read; in addition, the plates can be fixed with formaldehyde (9) or glutaraldehyde as a p e r m a n e n t record. I t might be applied to n o n haemagglutihating h u m a n viruses, such as herpesvirus instead of CF."}
