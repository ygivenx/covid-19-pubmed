{"title": "RNA Viruses: RNA Roles in Pathogenesis, Coreplication and Viral Load", "body": "Human diseases causing RNA viruses include Orthomyxoviruses, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Ebola disease, SARS, influenza, polio measles and retrovirus including adult Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). RNA viruses have RNA as genetic material, that may be a single-stranded RNA or a double stranded RNA. Viruses may exploit the presence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for replication of their genomes or, in retroviruses, with two copies of single strand RNA genomes, reverse transcriptase produces viral DNA which can be integrated into the host DNA under its integrase function. Studies showed that endogenous retroviruses are long-terminal repeat (LTR)-type retroelements that account for approximately 10% of human or murine genomic DNA. \n\nAmong human retroviruses, HIV-1 is a lentivirus with an RNA genome formed by two copies of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA. The HIV-1 RNA genome is associated to the nucleocapsid protein (NC) and to viral enzymes, thus it is \u201cprotected\u201d within the viral capsid mainly formed by the p24 protein. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome into the virus particle. The viral DNA is imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, or may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the infected cell as new virus particles that will infect other cells to begin the new replication cycle. Many aspects of the life cycle of retroviruses are intimately linked to the functions of cellular proteins and RNAs. HIV-1 and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMuLV) have been studied for the dimerization of two RNAs. \n\nLong Interspersed Nuclear Elements-1 (LINE-1) and endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) encode reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins in vertebrates. LINE-1s (L1s), the most studied, active autonomous mobile DNA in humans, accounts for about 17% of human DNA while HERVs account for about 8% and, together with the non-autonomous SINE/Alu family (about 10%) constitute a large proportion of the human genome. L1s encode two open reading frames (ORFs 1 and 2). The shorter ORF1 translation product (ORF1p) is an RNA binding protein, thought to also bind to non-retroviral transcripts, protects against nuclease degradation and specify nuclear import of the ribonuclear protein complex (RNP). ORF2 encodes a multifunctional protein (ORF2p) comprising apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) and reverse-transcriptase (RT) activities, responsible for retroelement\u2019s replication and their integration into chromosomal DNA. However, some clades of APE-type retroelements only encode a single ORF-corresponding to the multifunctional ORF2p [4]. HERVs, closely resembling infectious retroviruses, have mutated and/or truncated provirus structures and have lost their ability to replicate or retrotranspose. Nonetheless, proteins encoded by different types of HERVs are still exerting biological activities and most of the HERV-associated regulatory regions, termed \u201clong terminal repeats\u201d (LTRs), preserve their functions as a promoter\u2013enhancer region. Functional \u201cawakening\u201d of HERVs and LTRs from their epigenetic silencing can play causative roles in tumorigenesis; in particular, HERV-K (HML-2), the most recently integrated family with a nearly complete retroviral structure, is involved in neoplastic and autoimmune pathological processes [5]. Retroelements, which mobilize throughout the genomes by a copy-and-paste process involving RNA intermediates, have the potential to modify mammalian genomes not only through insertional mutagenesis yet generating many other novelties that alter genomes both structurally and functionally [6]. Not surprisingly, cells have adopted strategies aiming at restricting the mobility and deleterious consequences of uncontrolled retrotransposition [6].\n\nAlthough heavily mutagenic and responsible for deleterious gene disruptions, retroelements may have provided some beneficial genomic functions with potential evolutionary advantages. \n\nIncubation of mouse zygotes with 5\u2032-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) yields massive incorporation of this nucleoside analogue in newly synthesized DNA; surprisingly, a significant incorporation still occurs in both zygotic pronuclei in the presence of aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA replication. This aphidicolin-resistant BrdU incorporation is quantitatively abolished when embryos are simultaneously exposed to abacavir, a nucleoside RT inhibitor, thus revealing its RT-dependent nature. Moreover, quantitative PCR analysis showed that LINE-1 copies are newly synthesized at the zygote- and two-cell embryo stages and nearly doubled compared to gamete copy number. These findings support the conclusion that RT-dependent amplification of LINE-1 retrotransposons is a distinctive feature of early embryonic genomes [7].\n\nInhibition of RT activity in cancer cell lines, either by LINE-1-specific RNA interference or by RT inhibitory drugs, was found to reduce proliferation and promote differentiation and to antagonize tumor growth in animal models. Using CsCl density gradients, Alu- and LINE-1-containing DNA:RNA hybrid structures were identified in cancer yet not in normal cell lines [8]. In cancer cells the highly abundant RT activity intercepts various RNA classes and reverse transcribes them generating RNA:DNA hybrids. This may impair the formation of double-stranded RNAs required in the production of small regulatory RNAs (miRNA in particular), with a direct impact on gene expression. RT inhibition restores the 'normal' small RNA profile and the regulatory networks that depend on them. Thus, the retrotransposon-encoded RT drives a previously unrecognized mechanism crucial to the transformed state in tumor cells.\n\nRecent computational studies confirm the association between L1 expression and the generation of small RNAs. L1 expression seems to have a role in the activation of small RNA expression as emerged comparing data from L1-active and L1-silenced breast cancer cells. Cells in which L1 expression was silenced greatly increased the expression of a number of miRNAs, in particular members of the let-7 family, few piwiRNAs and several repeat-RNAs targeting LTRs, LINEs and SINE elements [9]. \n\nmiRNAs have become a prototype of several classes of small RNAs (sRNAs) [10]. These sRNAs act as single strand filaments incorporated into the RNA induced silencing complexes (RISC) acting as guides to Argonaute (Ago) enzymes degrading the target RNA complementary to these sRNAs. The processing into mature sRNAs requires protein complexes containing endoribonucleases: DROSHA in the nucleus, cleaving the dsRNA precursors into pre-miRNAs. The pre-miRNA hairpin structure is then exported into the cytoplasm via exportin-5. In the cytoplasm it assembles in RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which includes Dicer ribonucleases that cleave pre-miRNAs into mature single strand sRNAs, Ago enzymes cleaving the mRNAs with sequences complementary to the microRNAs [11], and other associated proteins, such as PW182/Argonaute-2, a 182 kDa RNAse associated to P-bodies [12], HIV transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) [13], and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP1) [14]. Mature miRNAs play important roles in the regulation of mammalian genes. It has been suggested that over 30% of all human genes are regulated by miRNAs. While recent genome-wide siRNA and shRNA screenings have shown that several hundred host cell proteins contribute to the regulation of HIV-1 infection in human cells, how miRNA-mediated regulation complements this picture is poorly understood. Other processing complexes are involved in the production of sRNA with various sizes: piwiRNA and siRNA, with size ranging from 21-nt to 25-nt, is the output of this processes. Their role is in the amplification of signals such as RNA primed RNA amplification, and the spreading of anti-viral RNA interference mechanism. \n\nRNA can both store information in its linear sequence and take on critical structural and catalytic roles in the cell, such as during the translation of messenger RNA into proteins [15]. These latter functions depend on the complex higher-order structures RNA is able to form. Homan et al. reported a method to probe the intricate conformational states in the analysis of HIV-1 NL4-3 RNA genome [15]. They chemically modified exposed segments of three complex RNA structures. They then sequenced the RNA to map the locations of the multiple modifications in each individual linear RNA molecule. This allowed the researchers to deduce interactions in three-dimensional space, and to uncover the local conformation, providing valuable information on the folding and function of RNAs [15]. Single-molecule RNA structure was tagged, i.e. multiple sites were chemically modified are identified by massively parallel sequencing of single RNA strands, and then analyzed for correlated and clustered interactions. The strategy thus identified RNA interaction groups by mutational profiling (RING-MaP) and made possible two applications. Firstly, through space interactions, 3D models were created for RNAs, spanning 80\u2013265 nucleotides, and intramolecular interactions that stabilize RNA were characterized. Secondly, distinct conformations in solution were identified and revealed previously undetected hidden states and large-scale structural reconfigurations that occur in unfolded RNAs relative to native states. RING-MaP analysis of single-molecule nucleic acid structure enabled a novel view of the global architecture and multiple conformations that govern the functions in RNAs.\n\nAdditional methodologies that have been used in testing the secondary structure of RNA genomes have been published. 2\u2019-hydroxy acylation of RNA was analysed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) [16] and used to define a new model of HIV-1 RNA genome. \n\nAdvances in RNA structure prediction from sequence are currently made by setting and testing new tools for generating hypotheses and confirming viral RNA structure-function relationships [17]. On this basis, novel methods have been tested to investigate the sequence-dependence of RNA-protein interactions [18]. RNA substrates demonstrate diverse intramolecular interactions, including mismatched base bulges, stem loops, pseudoknots, g-quartets, divalent cation interactions and noncanonical base pairs, determining three-dimensional RNA structure. The molecular evolution of MS2 from low- to high-affinity hairpins, was analysed and quantified. The results suggest that quantitative analysis of RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) provided an insight into the biophysics of RNAs and on consequences of sequence-function relationships.\n\nSeveral RNA secondary structures have been shown important for the virus functions: internal ribosomal entry structure, internal ribosomal entry site, and 5' UTRs regulate the start of translation of operons. For example, in influenza virus type C, there are seven vRNA segments with non-coding regions (NCR) at the extremities, that affects transcription and replication, by the type-C and type-A polymerase complexes [19]. To determine the molecular structure adopted by these NCR, various bioinformatics tools, including RNAfold, RNAstructure, Sfold, and Mfold, have been used. Various nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these non-coding regions may differentiate infective strains, such as major or minor read-through activity and differential expression of ORFs in operons. In Orthomyxoviridae, such as human influenza viruses or infective salmon anemia virus (ISAV), studies suggest an association between the molecular architecture of NCR regions and their role in the viral life cycle [20]. The 3' and 5'-terminal sequences of influenza A, B and C virus RNA segments are highly conserved and show partial inverted complementarity [21]. The viral RNA 3\u2019- and 5\u2019-end structure and mRNA transcription of infectious salmon anaemia virus resemble those of influenza viruses [22]. The aligned Non-Coding Region (NCR) sequences from ISAV isolates were compared with those from influenza virus, and consensus sequences were found, based on conserved regions identified in the consensus sequence [23]. This hypothetical structure, together with a comparison with influenza viruses, yielded reliable secondary structure models that lead to identification of conserved nucleotide positions at inter-genus level to determine which nucleotide positions are involved in the recognition of the vRNA/cRNA by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or mRNA by the ribosome. The NCR contain conserved sequences that vary in length among the various genera of the family Orthomyxoviridae [24]. It has been reported that the first 12 and 13 nucleotides correspond to conserved sequences in the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends, respectively, of all segments of the influenza A vRNA [25]. Structurally, these conserved sequences in influenza A have been described as partially complementary and capable of interacting in cis within each segment of RNA, forming structures called panhandles [26, 27] In Orthomyxoviruses, transcription of the genome requires the vRNA to act as template for each genomic segment, and for transcription to occur, the conformation adopted via the folding of the NCR is essential [26]. \n\nRecently importin 7 and importin \u03b1 have been shown to enhance nuclear entry of HIV-1 (but not HIV-2) correlating with its ability to bind to the viral integrase and the virus accessory protein Vpr which are components of pre-integration complex (PIC) [28, 29]. Transportin 2, identified using siRNA screens [30-32], is also able to enhance nuclear import of PIC. The most important finding was that tRNA molecules themselves can act as nuclear entry chaperones for the HIV PIC. HIV-1 transcription is regulated by the viral promoter located in the 5\u2032LTR of the provirus. The LTR contains binding sites for several transcription factors such as Sp1 and NF-\u03baB, NFAT, LEF-1, COUP-TF, Ets1, USF and AP-1 [33]. \n\nThe RNA binding protein Staufen appears to act as a chaperone to the RNA and has been detected in viral particles. Similarities between this and the known HIV TAR RNA binding protein TRBP may promote further investigations.\n\nRNA cap methylases are cellular factors that regulate post transcriptional HIV-1 RNA expression in order to produce a viral mRNA camouflaged by cellular mRNA showing a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap.\n\nPresently, viral interactions with cellular miRNAs have been identified, expanding the knowledge of miRNA functions [49].\n\nOne of the first host miRNAs shown to block retrovirus was miR-32, effectively limiting primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) replication [50]. \n\nInhibition of influenza virus replication has been described for four miRNAs: miR-323, miR-491, miR-654, and let-7c. Vesicular stomatitis virus is inhibited by miR-24 and miR-93, hepatitis B virus by miR-125a-5p, miR-199a-3p and miR-210; and HCV by miR-196, miR-296, miR-351, miR-431, and miR-448 [51]. In the case of HCV, a liver-specific miRNA, miR-122, was found to directly target HCV RNA sequence to up-regulate viral replication [52]. \n\nSubstantial advances have been made in the understanding of the interplay between HIV-1 and the cell's RNAi activity. HIV-1 infection can change the miRNA expression profiles in the circulating blood cells from infected individuals [51]. \n\nHost miRNAs can modulate HIV replication either directly by targeting HIV RNA, or targeting the mRNAs that encode host cell factors relevant to HIV replication. miR-217 was found induced by Tat and increased HIV-1 expression by targeting sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) with deacetylase activity inactivating Tat function [53]. miR-198 was shown to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and replication in monocytes, action linked to its down-regulation of cyclin T1 [54]. \n\nRecent reports studied several human miRNAs targeting HIV-1 sequences. Using target prediction software, five miRNA (miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-149, miR-324-5p, and miR-378) were found to target sequences, two of them located in the viral nef gene, of the HIV-1 genome [55]. miR-29a was shown to inhibit nef expression, and to repress HIV replication in Jurkat cells. Recently inhibition of HIV-1 infection by miR-29a and miR-29b was confirmed [56, 57], however, HIV-1 is protected by a complex RNA secondary structure surrounding the target site. A different group of five miRNAs (miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382) that target the 3'-UTR of the HIV genome was reported [58]. These \u201canti-HIV\u201d miRNAs were shown to be enriched in resting CD4+ T cells and were hypothesized to be involved in proviral latency. In another study, four of these miRNAs were found responsible for differences between monocytes and macrophages in their permissivity to HIV infection [59]. Recently the action of miR-29, miR-133b, miR-138, miR-149 and miR-326, targeting HIV-1 sequences, was shown [60]. Therefore, in divergent cells and in varying contexts different miRNAs may selectively regulate HIV-1 infection through direct targeting viral sequences. Thus, a complex set of miRNA-mediated positive and negative regulatory events is influencing viral replication [51]. In monocytes, miR-1236 was shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection by repressing translation of cellular factor Vpr binding protein, VprBP/DCAF1 [61].\n\nA significant number of host non-coding RNAs have been found in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by HCV infection, and are involved in pathogenesis of HCV and HCV-induced HCC [62].\n\nThe role of type I-IFNs in increasing host susceptibility could be explained by modulation of components of the immune response involved in controlling the growth of infective agents, such as induction of T cell apoptosis, resulting in greater IL-10 secretion by phagocytic cells, in turn dampening the innate immune response. A mechanism by which viruses survive inside cells is by inactivating the cellular antiviral machinery, or inactivating the RNA interference response, acting on the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). Infection thus can escape from the immune response by deregulation of the interferon signaling and the processes forming small RNAs acting in RNA silencing pathways.\n\nThe viral accessory protein Vpr is a component of the PIC. It is reported that Vpr is important on the nuclear import of PIC by interacting with a nuclear pore protein, importin \u03b1 [29]. Since PIC is larger than a nuclear pore, various other nuclear pore complex proteins have also been identified in PIC nuclear entry, including Nup 98, Nup 124p, Nup 358 and Nup 153. \n\nVpr belongs to the RAD23-like family of proteins, similarly to Vpx [66]. Vpr is a chaperone that guides target proteins to bind to VprVP/DCAF1, a receptor of the CULLIN E3 ubiquitin ligase (Cul4-DDB1, Cul5) [67-69]. Vpx is a small virion-associated adaptor protein encoded by viruses of the HIV-2/SIVsm lineage of primate lentiviruses, a Vpr paralogue, that enables these viruses to infect monocyte-derived cells.\n\nOne of the main activities of Vpr/Vpx is the degradation of target proteins through binding to VprBP, thus recruiting the 26S proteasomal pathway. Several studies showed the potentiality of Vpr to interact with many E2 and E3 enzymes [70]. Vpr has been shown to affect, either directly or indirectly, the modification of proteins, such as ubiquitinylation, phosphorylation and neddylation. In this way, Vpr influences and regulates the levels of many proteins [71]. \n\nVpr has been found to affect the levels of few miRNAs among which is miR-34a, as well as the genes IRBIT, SERP1, SIRT1, NEFM, Drp-1, Orai, STIM1, IP3R and CREB [72]. It was reported that Vpr inhibits short hairpin RNA function as expected upon reduction of endoribonuclease Dicer levels by binding with VprBP to block maturation of miRNAs [73]. \n\nAlso it was reported that Vpr can interact with spliceosomal protein SAP145 to mediate cellular pre-mRNA splicing inhibition. Although the mechanism is not clarified, Vpr is sufficient alone to promote HCV RNA replication [74]. Vpr is reported to be a component of the reverse transcription complex (RTC) and co-localizes with the viral nucleic acid and integrase within purified HIV-1 RTCs. \n\nVpr also can regulate several proteins and host factors, some of them can affect RNA replication. The most interesting are TERT [67], the type I interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) [75], A3G [76], TRIM proteins [77], uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2) [78] and single strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1). A premature activation of the SLX4 complex has been shown dependent on Vpr, promoting G2/M arrest and escape from innate immune sensing [79].\n\nZahoor et al. using microarray system found that Vpr protein enhanced the mRNA level of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), and causes phosphorylation of STAT1 at tyrosine 701 in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing Vpr [80]. These findings enhance the current understanding of HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis in human macrophages. Vpr, together with other HIV factors, recruits cellular adaptors to facilitate immune evasion [81]. HIV-1 Vpr differentially regulates the expression levels of chemotactic cytokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. A report showed that CXCL10 and CXCL11 are up-regulated in HIV-1-infected macrophages and play a key role in the recruitment and spread of HIV-1 to susceptible CD4+ T-cells [82]. \n\nInfective agents and bacteria when entering inside the cells activate several mechanisms to avoid immune detection [84]. Many viruses entering inside the cells are able to derail the cellular machinery, including the epigenetic control. A large set of host proteins required for HIV infection have been identified through a functional genomic screen [88]. RNAi screens have been performed for host factors required for HIV replication [30].\n\nHIV-1 integration is generally random but it has more easier access into active genes; however, independent of the site of integration in human chromosomes, two nucleosomes, named nuc-0 and nuc-1, are precisely organized in the 5\u2032LTR. In particular, the histone organized nuc-1 structure (located at position \u22122 to +140 of the LTR) normally serves to down modulate basal transcription.\n\nThe HIV-1 transcriptional activator Tat has evolved mechanisms to resolve the transcription block. Tat is associated with histone acetyl transferase (HAT) proteins whose activities remodel nucleosomes to allow transcriptional access. Tat has been shown to bind several different HATs: CBP/p300, p/CAF, GCN5, Tip60, and TAFII250. Through binding to the HAT proteins, Tat relieves chromatin repression at the HIV-1 LTR. Recently, Tat has also been found to bind a histone chaperone protein, hNAP-1, which acts with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes to facilitate transcription. \n\nCounteracting the effect of HATs, the histone deacetylase proteins (HDAC) remove the acetyl-group from HAT-acetylated histones to enforce transcriptional silencing. In the HIV-1 LTR, it is thought that the LSF protein binds at position \u221210 to +27 of the LTR to recruit the YY1 factor which further binds HDAC-1 to silence viral transcription. Tat expression down regulates HDAC-1 to remove the transcription repression. A similar recovery from repressive inhibition has been obtained through treatment with HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) such as Trichostatin A (TSA), Valproic Acid (VPA), and sodium butyrate.\n\nIn this review we highlighted the importance of cellular and viral RNAs in the cell response to RNA viruses, especially to retroviruses and endogenous L1 remnants of viral DNA integration. In addition, we reviewed several pathways involving small RNAs and short interfering RNAs deregulated in various states, from active infection to virus-associated cancers and defective immune signaling. A special role has been assigned to the deregulation of interferon response and the inhibition of protein complexes in stress granules and P-bodies, RNA binding proteins, RISC components and the RNA silencing machinery.
