{"title": "Expanding the size limit of RNA viruses: Evidence of a novel divergent nidovirus in California sea hare, with a \u223c 35.9 kb virus genome", "body": "studies are exploring and elucidating the expression profiles of a global plethora of organisms.\n\nIn tandem, a growing multifaceted RNA virosphere is emerging, uncovering the viral dark matter associated with every single living organism assessed (Greninger, 2018) . Despite the exponential growth of data generation during the last years and the parallel discovery of thousands of new emergent viruses, one crucial characteristic of RNA virus genomes, which has maintained constant in the metagenomics revolution (perhaps the only constant), is an upperlimit on genome length of <34 kb in RNA viruses (Shi et al., 2018) . Ball python nidovirus (Nidovirales; Coronaviridae) presents a 33.4 kb RNA virus genome (Stenglein et al., 2014) which still remains to be the largest reported to date and has been associated with respiratory disease in experimental infections of ball pythons (Bodewes et al., 2014; Hoon-Hanks et al, 2018) . Nidoviruses are positive-stranded RNA enveloped viruses with a monosegmented large genome. The linear nidoviruses genome is infectious, and its RNA molecule is capped and polyadenylated. The order Nidovirales is comprises four different families: Arteriviridae, Mesoniviridae, Coronaviridae and Roniviridae (Adams et al., 2017) . While genome size of nidoviruses differs significantly amid ca 12.7-33.4 kb, a general conserved genome organization, their replication strategy and sequence similarity in the replicase protein suggest that nidoviruses share a common ancestor (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . Nidoviruses are widespread in humans and numerous animal species, and have been detected in terrestrial and marine mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, insects and crustaceans (De Groot et al., 2012; Nga et al., 2011; Lauber et al., 2012) . Interestingly, despite their evident broad host range, only one nidovirus has been associated with mollusks (Phylum Mollusca), more specifically with a Turritella sea snail (Gastropoda) (Shi et al., 2016) . The California sea hare (Aplysia californica) is a sea slug marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae. This gigantic gastropod (up to 75 cm and 7 kg of weight) and valuable laboratory animal presents a \"simple\" nervous system of about 20 thousand neurons, distributed in 10 ganglia of ca. two thousand cells each.\n\nThese neurons are of massive size and present differential pigmentation, which has been useful for specific individual identification. Targeted studies with individual neurons of A. californica had led to the understanding of specific contributions of concerted neurons to simple and complex behaviors in which they are involved. Hallmarks of behavior neurochemistry have been elucidated in this gastropod such as the classic siphon-withdrawal reflex documented by Eric Kandel's fundamental early works, demonstrating for the first time that environmental cues may generate structural effects on the nervous system (Carew et al., 1972; Kandel, 1976) . Here, I present the genomic characterization of the first virus to be associated with A. californica, a tentative novel member of order Nidovirales, with the largest ever-recorded RNA virus genome.\n\nIn order to assess the potential RNA virus landscape of A. californica, every available RNA resource at NCBI was employed for virus discovery. 117 RNA NGS libraries, of diverse studies, target organ/tissue/cell, origin or developmental stage, encompassing over 164.54 gigabases were explored. The raw reads were downloaded and subjected to de novo assembly with Trinity v2.6.6 release or the CLC genomics workbench v8.0.3 assembler into library specific transcriptomes which were further subjected to bulk BLASTX searches (E-value < 1e-5) against a local database of refseq virus proteins. The obtained hits were explored by hand.\n\nInterestingly, a large 35.9 kb transcript assembled from a single-cell RNAseq library generated from the interneuron L-29 (SRA = SRR3211539) got a significant best hit (E-value = 7e-22; 24 % identity) to the orf1ab gene product (YP_005352837) \n\nFurther structural characterization and annotation of the detected transcript indicate the presence of two major ORFs (Figure 1 .A). ORF1a (67-17,521 nt coordinates) appears to be followed by a putative pseudoknot (Figure 1 .E) that could be associated to translation read-through of a UGA stop codon (opal) at position 17,519-21 nt to generate a larger ORF1ab by suppression of termination (67-25,198 nt coordinates) . After a 53 nt spacer a second large ORF2 is predicted at 25,252-34,920 nt coordinates. The encoded ORF1ab and ORF2 are flanked by a 67 nt A/U rich (61.2 %) 5'UTR and a 964 nt long 3'UTR followed by a 22 nt Poly (A) tail. This genome organization, while clearly different from the hallmark configuration of nidoviruses, is shared with the only available nido-like virus associated with a gastropod reported yet: Beihai nido-like virus 1 (BNLV-1; Shi et al., 2016) . BNLV-1 presents two large ORFs encoding two polyproteins, and the first polyprotein encoded in ORF1ab is tentatively generated by readthrough of a premature stop codon at 7708-7710 nt, instead of a characteristic -1 ribsomal frameshifting, the standard for nidoviruses (Brierley et al., 1987 TM3, similar to that of picornavirus 3C proteinases, is responsible for the processing of the most conserved part of the replicase polyprotein (ORF1b) (Anand et al., 2002) . In the ORF1b polyprotein region, HHPred searches identified at 6496-6911 aa coordinates of ORF1ab a RNAdirected RNA polymerase (RdRP, PDB structure: 1RAJ_A; Probability: 96.82; E-value = 9.6e-6; Pfam = pfam00680) and at 7,259-7596 aa coordinates a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase domain (HEL, PDB structure: 5WWP_A; Probability: 99.76; E-value = 6.4e-23). This peculiar position of the RdRP upstream the HEL domain is distinctive, exclusive of nidovirales among ssRNA(+) viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) , and has also been reported in tentative ssRNA(+) hypovirus-like mycoviruses (Marzano et al., 2016) . Additionally, between the RdRP and HEL domains, as expected, a multinuclear coronavirus zinc-binding domain (CV-ZBD) was identified (6,963-7,050 aa; score = 10.893; Prosite = PS51653). The predicted CV-ZBD domain contains 10 His/Cys typical residues at equilocal conserved positions of several nidoviruses ( Supp. Fig 2) . The ZBD domain has been indicated as a genetic marker of order Nidovirales, since it has not been identified in any other viral orders (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) .\n\nThe RdRP-ZBD-HEL predicted region of the ORF1ab protein appears to be the more similar to reported nidoviruses (Fig 1.D) . Lastly, a divergent methyltransferasa region, similar to that of nsp14 or nsp10, exoribonuclease and transferase (MT; PDB structure: 5C8T_B of Human SARS coronavirus guanine-N7 methyltransferase; Probability: 90.11; E-value = 0.12) was found at the 7,642-7,937 aa coordinates. In sum, the predicted ORF1ab protein presents an array of characteristic domains in an architecture typically associated to nidoviruses (NH2-PL-TM1-TM2-3CLpro-TM3-RdRP-ZBD-HEL-MT-COOH) this specific domain order is essential for diverse aspects of the replicative cycle of nidoviruses (Gorbalenya, 2001) . Further characterization of ORF2 encoded protein (PP2) suggests a clear divergence between this polyprotein and ordinary nidoviruses. Nevertheless, divergent but consistent signatures were identified which supports its affinity with BNLV-1. ORF2 encodes a 3,224 polyprotein with an N-terminal signal peptide with a predicted cleavage site between residues Ala 21 and Gly 22 ( Fig.1. A.i-ii). HHPred searches identified at 276-471 aa coordinates of PP2 a Trypsin (TryP; E.C.3.4.21.4) serine protease domain (PDB structure: 5KWM_A; Probability: 98.88; E-value = 4.3e-12). At an equilocal position (128-308 aa coordinates), the ORF2 product of BNLV-1 presents a related domain (Trypsin-like serine protease; Superfamily = SSF50494; E-value = 5.9e-07). While proteases involved in post-translational processing of PP1ab are a hallmark of nidoviruses, evolutionary insights of the detected domain suggest that this peptidase is significantly related to the ones found in the digestive system of many vertebrates, where they hydrolyzes diverse proteins. Future studies should explore the potential source of the detected TryP domain, which might be associated to horizontal transmission from an eventual host. In addition, the C-region of ORF2 of BNLV-1 presents an alphavirus glycoprotein like domain (Superfamily = SSF56983; 1,335-1,546 aa). The A. californica ORF2 product presents an analogous, but highly divergent region with similarity with Torovirinae spike glycoprotein (Sgp; 2,185-3,092 aa; FFAS03 = PF17072.3; 17 % id) at the C-region of the predicted PP2, which could be associated with structural functions.\n\nOverall, genetic similarity, genomic organization, functional and structural annotation suggest that the identified transcript could be sequence evidence of a new species of RNA virus with cues of Nidovirales. Thus, I propose the name Aplisya californica nido-like virus (AcNV) to the detected putative virus.\n\nUsing as query the predicted gene products of AcNV, multiple TBLASTN searches (E-value >1e-1) targeting the A. californica genome assembly AplCal3.0, NCBI accession number GCF_000002075.1 failed to return any significant hits. This result supports the proposition that the AcNV sequence does not derive from the RNA expression of an integrated DNA element sharing similarities with Nidovirales, or contamination of RNA sequencing libraries with A.\n\ncalifornica DNA harboring such element, or potential AcNV like endogenous viral elements EVEs (Katzourakis & Gifford, 2010) . Further, the complete raw DNA reads used to generate the A. californica genome were explored in detail (Bioproject PRJNA13635), to rule out that the AcNV sequence could correspond to an unassembled region of the A. californica genome. In this direction, MEGABLAST of the raw DNA reads (E-value >1e-1) with AcNV resulted in no significant hits to the virus sequence. In sum, these data are in concordance with the proposal .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint that the detected AcNV RNA sequence is, in fact, evidence of a bona fide extant virus associated to A. californica.\n\nTo entertain the hypothesis that the proposed AcNV is related to the Nidovirales order, phylogenetic insights were generated based on MAFFT multiple amino acid alignments of predicted ORF1ab proteins of accepted and proposed members of Nidovirales (Supp . Table 1) , followed by FastTree maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees (Fig 1.B Fig. 1.B ).\n\nAcNV could be traced to expression sequence tag (EST) libraries generated more than 10 years ago (Moroz et al., 2006; Fiedler et al., 2010) . Over 97 ESTs were further linked to AcNV, presenting highly supported similarity to the virus sequence (E-value \u2264 9e10-72; identity \u2265 92%). The tentatively AcNV derived ESTs were generated from libraries obtained from the central nervous system (CNS) of A. californica, most hits being linked to a specific pedal and pleural ganglia sample library (Supp. Table 2 ). The suggestive hints towards a CNS enrichment inclined me to further study the potential tropism of AcNV.\n\nIn light of the unique A. californica biology of well-established model organism, its amazing central nervous system, and the availability of vast genomic resources, I explored the genomic RNA landscape of AcNV in Californica sea hare. The distinguishing neuroanatomy of A.\n\ncalifornica and its well-studied neurons offer an exceptional technical platform for RNA dynamics (Puthanveettil et al., 2013; Moroz & Kohn, 2010 -2013 . To tentatively assess cell/tissue and organ tropism based on virus-derived RNA accumulation in A. californica, .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint available California sea hare RNAseq libraries were mapped to AcNV and normalized as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM). Virus RNA transcripts were detected in an outstanding diversity of target tissue and organs, suggesting e pervasive tissue tropism of AcNV (Fig 2; Supp. Table 3 ). At the adult organ level (Fig 2. A, B right panel) AcNV was detected in chemoreceptive areas (rhinophores & tentacles), salivary glands, gills, heart, additional muscles (body wall, buccal and penial), hermaphroditic glands, ovotestis, hepatopancreas and other digestive glands. Interestingly, AcNV appeared to be highly enriched in the CNS. The availability of CNS tissue and single-cell RNAseq data allowed the surveillance of specific tropism at the cellular level of AcNV (Fig 2.B-E) . AcNV accumulated at relatively higher levels in the left excitatory interneuron 29 (L29), the left motor neuron 7 (L7), the right serotonergic cerebral ganglion metacerebral neuron (MCC-R) and the right abdominal ganglion cholinergic neuron 2 (R2). The R2 neuron and its axonal pathway is highly conserved and thus can be consistently identified in closely related species of the genus Aplysia.\n\nR2 measures up to 1.1 mm in diameter and is the largest neuron in the animal kingdom (Moroz & Kohn, 2013) . AcNV was found at lower relative levels in the left abdominal ganglion motor neuron (LFS), the sensory neuron cluster and the left MCC.\n\nIn addition to adult organ tissues and cells, I was able to detect AcNV in libraries generated from individuals at very early developmental stages (Heyland et al., 2011) such as early cleavage (4-7 h after egg masses are laid) and third day individuals (1-4 cells; transition from trochophore to veliger body plan). AcNV virus FPKM values corresponding to each A. californica sample are available as Supp. Table 3 .\n\nThe vast collection of NGS data allowed both the generation of consensus sequences for each bioproject, based on >75 % base calls, and the identification of variable sites at each position (Fig 1.A.iiii) . The analyses of every NGS library allowed insights into the variation within-host and eventual evolutionary hints at a genome wide level. The predicted AcNV bona fide variation was noticeably spotted across the genome with specific regions, such as the 3' UTR showing greater levels of nonconsensus calls (Supp. AcNV virus positive studies is non-significant ( Fig. 1.C; Fig.1.Aiii) .\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe AcNV genomic plan, predicted gene products, canonical array of conserved domain of nidoviruses in the ORF1ab protein (NH2-PL-TM1-TM2-3CLpro-TM3-RdRP-ZBD-HEL-MT-COOH), and overall sequence similarity with reported nidoviruses, were considered to propose that the detected RNA sequence corresponded to a nido-like bona fide virus. Further, phylogenetic insights indicated that AcNV unequivocally clustered within the order Nidovirales, \n\nAcNV presents the largest RNA virus genome ever recorded (Supp . Fig 1.A-C) . At ca. 35.9 kb, AcNV is over 2.4 kb longer that the second largest: Ball phyton nidovirus 1 (BPNV-1) RNA genome (Stenglein et al., 2014) . When comparing the 84 refseq genomes of nidovirus available at NCBI and their taxonomic assignment to specific Nidovirales families or sub-families, three major groups became evident: (i) Arteriviridae members, \"small nidoviruses\"; (ii) Mesoniviridae, \"intermediate nidoviruses\", and (iii) Coronaviridae and Ronaviridae \"large nidoviruses\" (Supp. Fig 1.A-B) . Within the Coronaviridae group, particular dynamics in size may be observed such as a wider pattern of longitudes of subfamily Torovirinae members presenting a either ca. 20 kb genomes or larger ca. 32-33 kb ones, the latter being the snakehosted BPNV-1 and Morelia viridis nidovirus. On the other hand, sub-family Coronavirinae members present a more restricted pattern of genome length, which may be grouped by genus, from Deltacoronavirus to Betacoronavirus members (Supp . Fig 1.A) . It is possible that the discovery of new Ronaviridae like viruses would help complement this emergent grouping by RNA genome size. The placement of AcNV in this context is intriguing; the similar and only other mollusk nido-like virus BNLV-1 was reported to have a much shorter 20.2 kb RNA genome. Nevertheless, there are some hints that may suggest that BNLV-1 could be longer than reported: The described BNLV-1 sequence NC_032496 does not present any stop codon interrupting the ongoing ORF1a, thus the suggested translation start site and the reported 5'UTR could correspond to a truncated coding region of ORF1aPP. In this direction, while nidoviruses ORF1a is typically much longer than ORF1b, ORF1a of BNLV-1 is about the same size as\n\nORF1b. Perhaps future studies should revisit BNLV-1 genome sequence.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint Given the estimated large size of AcNV genome, and the apparent constrains in terms of longer RNA viruses, the underlying basis of this discernible bar is under ongoing assessment. Probable causes of this size limit are under discussion, and the most plausible explanation could be associated with the high rate of RNA virus mutation associated with limited mechanisms of proof reading and repair, concomitant with high rates of replication (Holland, 1982; Denison et al., 2011) . Supporting these assumptions, in parallel, there appears to be a correlation between small genome DNA viruses and high rate of mutation. In evolutionary terms, mutation rates could be associated not only to polymerase fidelity, but also to viral biology, genome architecture and to replication speed (Duffy et al., 2008; Campillo-Balderas et al., 2015) . The size limit of RNA viruses is not specifically associated to monosegmented viruses. As a matter of fact, the largest members of the Reoviridae family, encompassing 9 to 12 dsRNA segments which added together grasp a total genome of ca. 32 kb, mirror the apparent size limit of Nidovirales and RNA viruses in general (Dolja & Koonin, 2018) . From and evolutionary perspective, it was recently suggested that the nido-like clade of animal viruses emerged in early invertebrates and through horizontal virus transmission then colonized vertebrates. This proposition was based on the relative small genome size of deep-rooted arthropod nidoviruses, and the observation that the largest genomes correspond to vertebrate coronaviruses, postulating that gene incorporation and layering (and concomitant genome length growth) succeeded during the co-evolution of nidoviruses and vertebrates (Dolja & Koonin, 2018) . The discovery here of the tentative AcNV associated to a mollusk, with the largest RNA genome of nidoviruses yet, with more affinity to intermediate-long Roniviridae than to larger coronaviruses, implies that the evolutionary history of Nidovirales could be more complex than expected.\n\nOne striking difference observed in AcNV and BNLV-1 genomes denotes a fundamental contrast to the predicted genome organization associated to nidoviruses, which consistently harbor at their 5' region two large partially overlapping ORFs. Translation of ORF1a yields The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nGiven the considerable number of viral reads, a tentative assessment of AcNV variability was generated. Polymorphic sites were defined with a conservative estimated frequency of at least \u2265 0.05 and a Phred score of 20 or higher to filter raw reads. Considering that sequencing errors of the diverse platforms reach at most ~1 % (Ion Torrent data), thus a 5% frequency threshold enables the detection of probable true variants in the virus RNA genome with high confidence. Cotten et al (2013) , with a similar strategy, explored virus variants of human betacoronavirus using as threshold 1 %. A 5% frequency threshold was used by Van den Hoecke et al (2015) to assess the variation landscape of Influenza virus A. The detected variability among bioprojects appears to be non-significant or within the levels of intra-host variability. While dispersed in time, most NGS libraries were generated from lab reared animals from the same provider. Thus it is tempting to suggest (this is pure speculation) that the low intrinsic variability observed could be linked with a single virus lineage maintained inadvertently through the years at the breeder facilities.\n\nThe availability of a public collection of NGS RNA libraries of the model organism A. californica, allowed the tentative survey of the genomic RNA landscape of AcNV. Virus RNA transcripts were detected in an outstanding diversity of target tissue and organs, suggesting e pervasive tissue tropism, showing an emergent enrichment of AcNV in the CNS. Single-cell RNAseq data allowed the surveillance of AcNV at the cellular level, including not only specific types of neuron (e.g. abdominal ganglia neurons) but also the detection of AcNV in welldefined individual neurons of A. californica (e.g. R2, L29, R15). Interestingly, AcNV RNA accumulated at high levels in R2, which is the largest known neuron in the animal kingdom, offering an outstanding and unprecedented model for the study of virus dynamics at the single cell level. Besides their accessibility, ease to identify and size, each R2 neuron may yield over 1.9ug of RNA allowing to amplification-free RNA profiling at a single-neuron level (Moroz & Kohn, 2013) . The standard of single-cell RNAseq preparation in any other organism cells, which have picogram levels of nucleic acids, is a robust amplification step, which may lead to irregular coverage, noise and imprecise quantification of sequencing data (Islam et al., 2011) .\n\nThe potential to conduct expression analyses on individual neurons of A. californica without the need of amplification, in naked-eye visible neurons, provide an elegant platform for genomics and physiological analysis within well-defined cellular networks: an ideal pathosystem to address single cell virus dynamics. It is tempting to suggest that the possibility of amalgamation of the study of this novel nido-like virus and a biological model system such as A. californica with a vast research toolkit, would allow the rapid deployment of modern molecular tools, .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint which could redound in a rapid advancement in the biology of this entity. An impressive example of that is the recent integration of the house flies pathogen Entomophtora muscae into Drosophila melanogaster, which resulted in major advancements in the neurochemistry, genomics and neurobiological aspects of this fungal pathogen (Elya et al., 2017) . In retrospective, it is perhaps worth contemplating the possibility that this hidden entity, present with certainty in samples of more than decade-old studies, might have influenced the outcome of any of the uncountable works published in the last 50 years. It is in this scenario that future studies should eagerly focus on the specific potential effects of this virus and its host. This invaluable information, missing in the literature, would shed light on the evolutionary history of the interaction of this virus and A. californica.\n\nIn order to assess the potential RNA virus landscape of A. californica, every available RNA AplCal3.0 (GenBank accession number GCF_000002075.1) was explored by TBLASTN searches (E-value >1e-1) using as query the predicted protein products of AcNV, in order to .
