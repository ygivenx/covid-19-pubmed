{"title": "Therapeutic Potential of Splice-Switching Oligonucleotides", "body": "A lternative splicing is an essential biological process with important implications for human disease. Early work from this laboratory demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides could be used to correct aberrantly spliced human \u03b2-globin pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in cell-free extracts and in cultured erythroid cells from \u03b2-thalassemia patients (Dominski and Kole, 1993; Sierakowska et al., 1996; Kole, 1997; Lacerra et al., 2000) . Since then, we and others have employed splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) in numerous applications targeting many disease-relevant genes (Kole et al., 2004) . Recently, several groups have reported advances using SSOs in animal models of human disease. Importantly, clinical trials using SSOs to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy have generated positive results in patients. This review will cover recent developments in the application of SSOs to therapeutically relevant targets with an emphasis on disease models (Table 1) .\n\nAlternative splicing is a biological process that regulates gene expression in higher eukaryotes by generating multiple protein isoforms with diverse functions from single pre-mRNA transcripts (Matlin et al., 2005) . It therefore contributes signifi cantly to the diversity of the proteome. Indeed, up to 70% of human genes are predicted to undergo alternative splicing (Mironov et al., 1999; Johnson et al., 2003) . Importantly, up to 50% of human genetic diseases arise from mutations that affect splicing; this emphasizes the need for drugs that manipulate splicing Faustino and Cooper, 2003; Pagani and Baralle, 2004; Pagenstecher et al., 2006) .\n\nPre-mRNA splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, a dynamic complex of proteins and RNAs, which is assembled de novo at every splicing event. Sequence specifi city and simultaneous plasticity of alternative splicing is achieved by tissue dependent variability of spliceosome composition (Pollard et al., 2000 (Pollard et al., , 2002 and loose conservation of essential sequence elements in pre-mRNA. These elements include splice sites, branch points, polypyrimidine tracts, and auxiliary exonic and intronic sequence elements known as splicing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs, respectively) and silencers (ESSs and ISSs, respectively). Splicing is thought to be controlled by competition among splice sites and splicing elements for splicing factors and the spliceosome. Based on splice site usage, a single pre-mRNA transcript can be alternatively spliced to produce multiple mature mRNA splice variants, which are then translated into variable protein isoforms. This is accomplished by various means, including exon exclusion, intron retention, exon shuffl ing, alternative 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites, and alternative promoter and alternative polyadenylation sites ( Fig. 1) (Matlin et al., 2005) . Alternative splicing can also downregulate gene expression Local and systemic dystrophin induction in mdx mice (Mann et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2003 Lu et al., , 2005 A Clinical trial in DMD patients by intramuscular injections (van Deutekom et al., 2007 ) PMO Functional level of dystrophin induction in body-wide skeletal muscles in mdx mice after systemic delivery of PMO (Alter et al., 2006) A dose-escalating clinical trial in DMD patients by a single intramuscular injection.\n\nImperial College of London, UK (in progress) PPMO Effective dystrophin restoration in body-wide muscles including cardiac muscle of mdx mice (Jearawiriyapaisarn et al., 2008) \u03b2-Thalassemia \u03b2-globin PPMO Restoration of HbA production in erythroid cells from peripheral blood of thalassemic patients by free uptake of PMO (Suwanmanee et al., 2002a (Suwanmanee et al., , 2002b Spinal muscular atrophy ( through introduction of premature stop codons leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript (Lewis et al., 2003) . The dynamic nature and the gene and tissue dependent variability of the splicing machinery and its interaction with pre-mRNA suggest a richness of potential targets for drugs that interfere with redirect alternative splicing pathways for therapeutic purposes.\n\nSplice-switching oligonucleotides direct pre-mRNA splicing by binding sequence elements and blocking access to the transcript by the spliceosome and other splicing factors. They can be applied to (1) restore correct splicing of an aberrantly spliced transcript, (2) produce a novel splice variant that is not normally expressed, or (3) manipulate alternative splicing from one splice variant to another (Fig. 2) . Through the latter mechanism, SSOs therefore downregulate a deleterious transcript while simultaneously upregulating expression of a preferred transcript. Notably, their activity is enhanced with increased target gene expression because this enables increased production of the preferred splice variant (Mercatante et al., 2002) . This is in contrast to traditional antisense approaches and small-interfering RNA, which exhibit decreased potency with increased target gene expression.\n\nDirection of splicing by SSOs requires that the targeted pre-mRNA duplexed with these compounds is not degraded by RNase H. This requirement distinguishes the SSO mechanism from those of traditional antisense and RNAi, where degradation of mRNA and downregulation of gene expression is desirable. It is achieved primarily by altering the oligonucleotide sugar-phosphate backbones. Examples include phosphorodiamidate morpholinos (PMOs), peptide nucleic acids (PNA), locked nucleic acids (LNA), and the 2\u2032O-methyl (2\u2032OMe) and 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl (MOE) ribose modifi cations ( Fig. 3) (Kurreck, 2003) . In addition to RNase H resistance, these SSO modifi cations impart increased target affi nity and unique and exploitable functional distribution profi les in vivo (Sazani et al., 2002) . For example, LNA SSOs demonstrate potent and persistent activity confi ned almost exclusively to the liver, small intestine, and colon (Roberts et al., 2006) while PMO SSOs exhibit peptide-dependent functional biodistribution in a large number of tissues (Jearawiriyapaisarn et al., 2008) . Splice-switching oligonucleotides may also incorporate phosphorothioate (PS) linkages, which do not confer RNase H resistance, but contribute to increased serum stability and bioavailability.\n\nSSO direction of alternative splicing is not only a therapeutic approach but also provides a means to assay and improve cell culture and in vivo activity of the SSOs. Particularly useful reporter systems in which either luciferase or enhanced green fl uorescent protein (EGFP) coding sequences are interrupted by an aberrantly spliced human \u03b2-globin intron have been developed in this laboratory (Kang et al., 1998; Sazani et al., 2001; Sazani et al., 2002) . Functional luciferase or EGFP proteins are expressed only when SSO successfully enters the cell, accesses nuclear pre-mRNA and binds sequence elements in the intron, prompting correct splicing and exclusion of the intron from the mRNA transcript. The EGFP-654 transgenic mouse provides a functional, positive-readout platform for assessing SSO effi cacy in vivo (Sazani et al., 2002; Roberts et al., 2006) . These reporter systems have also been used to evaluate various enhancers of SSO delivery including cell-penetrating peptides (Jearawiriyapaisarn et al., 2008) . Other groups employed the luciferase-based cell systems to evaluate receptor ligands (Alam et al., 2008) , nanoparticle carriers (Liu and Franzen, 2008) , and SSO uptake (Resina et al., 2007a (Resina et al., , 2007b Wu et al., 2007; Lebleu et al., 2008) .\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by severe and progressive muscle wasting. It is caused by deletions and other mutations in the DMD gene, which cause premature termination of translation and result in lack of dystrophin protein. Deletions that maintain the reading frame in DMD gene produce internally deleted but partially functional dystrophin, causing the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) (Monaco et al., 1988) . It has been reported that rare, naturally occurring dystrophin-positive (revertant) fi bers are found in the muscle sections from mdx mouse, a mouse model of DMD (Hoffman et al., 1990) , and in DMD patients (Nicholson et al., 1989) . The dystrophin in these revertant fi bers is internally deleted dystrophin generated by the removal of the mutated exon and restoration of translational reading frame of DMD transcripts through alternative splicing pathway of dystrophin pre-mRNA (Klein et al., 1992; Lu et al., 2000) . A goal of DMD research has been to mimic this natural phenomenon to convert the DMD phenotype to the BMD phenotype by removing one or more exons to create shortened but inframe dystrophin transcripts generating partially functional dystrophin. This approach was validated using SSOs that blocked pre-mRNA splicing elements, thereby excluding the mutation-containing exon and restoring the reading frame in DMD transcripts in cell-free extracts, (Takeshima et al., 1995) , human lymphoblastoid cells (Pramono et al., 1996) , and primary mdx myoblast cultures (Dunckley et al., 1998; Wilton et al., 1999) .\n\nThe use of SSOs to mediate exon skipping in DMD has recently progressed from cell culture to animal models and clinical trials. The SSO chemistry fi rst used in DMD studies \n\nfor DMD treatment. This laboratory recently demonstrated for the fi rst time that systemic treatment of mdx mice with PPMO-B carrying (RXRRBR) 2 XB peptide induced in cardiac muscles high levels of exon 23-skipped mRNA and produced 20%-30% of normal dystrophin protein. This treatment resulted in reduced infl ammatory cell infi ltration in the heart (Jearawiriyapaisarn et al., 2008) . Exon 23-skipped mRNA and restored production of dystrophin protein remained detectable for at least 2-3 months after treatment, especially in diaphragm and quadriceps, where 100% exon skipping was maintained. This suggested that the PPMO-B/ PMO is very stable in muscle tissues, because the half-life of dystrophin mRNA is only ~16 hours (Tennyson et al., 1996) . The sustained dystrophin expression, not only in the heart but also in body-wide muscles (Fig. 4) , led to a decrease of serum CK to near wild-type levels, confi rming that the rescued dystrophin protein is functional. Sustained dystrophin expression induced by PPMO-B SSO would be desirable for clinical application due to the potential for infrequent readministration. Therefore, splice-switching with PPMO-B holds great potential for the treatment of DMD.\n\nPre-clinical study has been extended to test sequence specifi city and dosing regimens of SSOs in transgenic hDMD mice, which carry full-length human DMD gene (t Hoen et al., 2008) . Intramuscular injection of 2\u2032OMePS SSOs excluded targeted human exons without affecting the endogenous mouse dystrophin transcripts, suggesting that high sequence specifi city was obtained (Bremmer-Bout et al., 2004) .\n\nThe pre-clinical results described above have led to three clinical trials for oligonucleotide-induced exon-skipping in DMD patients. First, a PS oligodeoxynucleotide was evaluated in a 10-year-old DMD boy, who carries an out-offrame DMD transcripts caused by the deletion of exon 20 (Takeshima et al., 2006) . This compound, targeted to a splicing enhancer sequence in exon 19, was reported to exclude exon 19, generating shortened, in-frame transcripts. Low level of transcripts lacking exons 19-20 and positive dystrophin muscle fi bers were identifi ed in a muscle biopsy 1 week after four weekly i.v. infusions at 0.5 mg/kg. This observation was surprising since oligodeoxynucleotides induce RNase H mediated RNA degradation and are not capable of splicing modulation. Perhaps this was one of the reasons why this treatment did not improve muscle function. In a more robust, well-designed clinical trial, a 2\u2032OMePS SSO, PRO051, was targeted to an internal sequence of exon 51 to induce exon 51 skipping (van Deutekom et al., 2007) . This study demonstrated that a single local i.m. injection of 0.8 mg PRO051 specifi cally excluded exon 51 in four patients with DMD, restoring the translational reading frame. This led to production of truncated dystrophin at 3%-12% normal levels in total protein lysates extracted from muscle biopsies taken 4 weeks after injection. Functional improvement of injected muscles was not observed. Finally, a dose-escalating clinical trial of a PMO SSO, AVI-4658, designed to skip exon 51, is underway. This study is intended to establish the efficacy and safety of a single i.m. injection of AVI-4658 in nine boys with DMD. Systemic administration of AVI-4658 is also being developed in pre-clinical studies for future phase II/ III clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nSkipping of exon 51 could rescue DMD patients who suffer from exon 45-50, 47-50, 48-50, 49-50, 50, 52, 52-63 was 2\u2032OMe phosphorothioate (2\u2032OMePS), which was tested in primary myoblasts derived from DMD patients carrying different deletions and a nonsense mutation (van Deutekom et al., 2001; Aartsma-Rus et al., 2003) . In mdx mice, which carry a nonsense mutation in exon 23 of the DMD gene, dystrophin expression was restored by intramuscular (i.m.) injections of 2\u2032OMePS SSO targeted to the 5\u2032 splice site of intron 23 complexed with liposome (Mann et al., 2001) , or the nonionic block copolymer F127 (Lu et al., 2003) . In the latter case, SSO treatment led to functional improvement of the treated muscle. Since body-wide muscles are affected by DMD, it is important to induce dystrophin expression in all muscles (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles). Intravenous (i.v.) injections of 2\u2032OMePS complexed with F127 induced dystrophin expression in body-wide skeletal muscles, but not in cardiac muscle, in mdx mice with no detectable toxicity (Lu et al., 2005) .\n\nIn addition to 2\u2032OMePS, PMO has also been employed in mdx mice. The PMO annealed to a negatively charged DNA sense strand (\"leash\") and complexed with liposome effectively induced exon skipping in mdx mice by local (Gebski et al., 2003; Fletcher et al., 2006) and systemic injections (Fletcher et al., 2006) . A step forward was achieved in mdx mice i.v. injected with 2 mg uncomplexed PMO SSO at weekly intervals, which led to functional improvement of tibialis anterior muscles after three injections (Alter et al., 2006) . After seven weekly injections, levels of dystrophin expression in gastrocnemius and quadriceps of treated mdx mice reached >50% of normal levels, and the level of serum creatinine kinase (CK) was dramatically reduced, suggesting that the integrity of muscle sarcolemma was improved by the SSO-induced dystrophin production. Administration of uncomplexed PMO, which is simple, would be ideal for clinical application. The potential of PMO in dystrophin induction has also been shown in canine X-linked muscular dystrophy (CXMD), a clinically severe canine model of DMD. Systemic infusions of PMO cocktails inducing skipping of exons 6 and 8 restored dystrophin expression in skeletal muscles and ameliorated exercise ability in CXMD canines (Yokota et al., 2008) . Other chemistries such as LNA, ethylene bridged nucleic acid (ENA), PNA have been tested in cell culture and in vivo but they do not seem to be particularly useful in treatment of DMD (Aartsma-Rus et al., 2004b; Surono et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2008) .\n\nA major advance in oligomer-induced exon skipping in DMD has been application of cell-penetrating-peptideconjugated PMOs (PPMOs). These compounds have shown enhanced effi cacy in exon 23 removal in mdx mice compared to unconjugated PMO. A PPMO carrying (RXR) 4 XB peptide, (where R is arginine, X is 6-aminohexanoic acid, and B is \u03b2-alanine), induced normal levels of dystrophin expression in diaphragm and low levels in colon, gut, and skeletal muscles of mdx mice treated as neonates with four weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections at 5 mg/kg, a signifi cantly lower dose than that used for unconjugated PMO Moulton et al., 2007) . However, none of the above studies in animal models showed restoration of dystrophin expression in cardiac muscle. Intracardiac injections of PMO in mdx mice induced only very low level of dystrophin expression (Vitiello et al., 2008) . Because cardiomyopathy is one of the major causes of death in DMD patients, induction of dystrophin expression in cardiac muscle is critical 1 (IVS1-5, IVS1-6, IVS1-110) and intron 2 (IVS2-654, IVS2-705, IVS2-745). The three intron 2 mutations, IVS2-654 (C>T), IVS2-705 (T>G), and IVS2-745 (C>G), create an aberrant 5\u2032 splice sites and activate a common cryptic 3\u2032 splice site at position 579 in the intron 2. Use of these aberrant splice sites generates an mRNA transcript that includes an intronic sequence encoding a stop codon, resulting in translation of truncated, nonfunctional \u03b2-globin protein. These mutations have been most extensively studied and targeted with SSOs in cell-free extracts and model cell lines stably expressing \u03b2IVS2 mutants (Sierakowska et al., 1996; Schmajuk et al., 1999) . In erythroid progenitor cells isolated from peripheral blood of patients carrying IVS2-654 or -745 mutations, a single treatment with PMOs targeted to aberrant 5\u2032 splice sites by syringe loading resulted in correction of \u03b2-globin pre-mRNA splicing and production of HbA (Lacerra et al., 2000) . Moreover, the PMOs were freely taken up by erythroid progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow of \u03b2-thalassemic mice carrying the human \u03b2IVS2-654 mutation (Lewis et al., 1998) and from peripheral blood of patients carrying IVS2-654 mutation, leading to effective splicing correction (Suwanmanee et al., 2002b) . Signifi cant HbA upregulation was achieved in the treated human thalassemic erythroid precursors, target cells for thalassemia treatment. Free uptake of PMOs was also shown to be effective in splicing correction and HbA restoration in progenitor cells isolated from patients carrying HbE mutation, which activates a cryptic 5\u2032 splice site in exon 1 (Suwanmanee et al., 2002a) . These results suggested that PMO would be applicable in vivo, in mouse models of \u03b2-thalassemia. deletions (Fig. 5) and a recently reported inversion of exon 49-50 (Madden et al., 2008) , which affect an estimated 16% of DMD patients. The limitation of the exon skipping strategy in DMD is that skipping one exon could restore the translational reading frame only for particular deletions. Optimization of SSOs for different deletions, or personalized molecular medicine, may be necessary (Hoffman, 2007) ; however, the current regulatory hurdles required for each individual drug make this approach prohibitively expensive for commercial development. To overcome this limitation, multiple-exon skipping to increase the number of deletion cases that might benefi t from this strategy was explored (Aartsma-Rus et al., 2004a . It is predicted that multiple-exon skipping from exons 45 through 55 could be applied for up to 63% of DMD patients (Beroud et al., 2007) .\n\nStill unanswered questions, regarding SSOs bioavailability, therapeutic index, and long-term effects, are being addressed in ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies. As a result it is likely that among therapeutic applications of SSOs, exon skipping for DMD will be the fi rst to be useful in the clinic.\n\n\u03b2-Globin \u03b2-Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by a defi ciency of \u03b2-globin chains, leading to the reduction or absence of adult hemoglobin A (HbA). Most \u03b2-globin gene mutations alter pre-mRNA splicing and are found in intron SSO impaired splice site recognition and forced the splicing machinery to re-couple the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites in intron 6, leading to increased inclusion of exon 7 in cell culture (Lim and Hertel, 2001) . Targeting exon 7 by SSOs either linked to serine/arginine-rich splicing factors or including a \"tail\" that serves as a splicing factor-binding site, called exon specifi c-splicing enhancement by small chimeric effectors (ESSENCE) and targeted oligonucleotide enhancer of splicing (TOES) (Skordis et al., 2003) , respectively, have also been shown to promote exon 7 inclusion. A synthetic ESSENCE molecule containing a PNA SSO targeted to exon 7 coupled to 10 arginine-serine (RS) repeats signifi cantly induced exon 7 inclusion in a cell free-splicing system. Although the PNA SSO lacking the RS repeats was active, effi cacy was much lower than the ESSENCE molecule. The TOES was designed to have two components; the fi rst was complementary to exon 7 and second was a noncomplementary sequence that was designed to mimic an ESE to recruit trans-splicing factors. This bifunctional SSO increased SMN2 exon 7 inclusion in vitro and in SMA patient fi broblasts, which led to partial restoration of gem number, an indicator of SMN protein increase, suggesting that SSO bound to exon 7 in the transcript did not interfere with translation.\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons leading to a generalized muscle weakness. Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by homozygous mutations or deletions in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, encoding the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein which is necessary for assembly of snRNPs involved in splicing, an essential process for cell survival (Wan et al., 2005) . In humans there is a second, SMN gene copy, SMN2, which differs from SMN1 in the C-to-T transition at position 6 of SMN2 exon 7. It has been proposed that this transition disrupts an ESE sequence , creates an ESS sequence (Kashima and Manley, 2003) , or strengthens an inhibitory RNA stem loop at the 5\u2032 end of exon 7 (Singh et al., 2004) , leading to exon 7 exclusion in most of SMN2 transcripts that yields an unstable truncated SMN protein. SMN2 is a modifying gene in SMA patients, as the number of copies of SMN2 is inversely correlated to the severity of SMA (Mailman et al., 2002) . Therefore, a strategy to include exon 7 and upregulate expression of full-length, fully functional SMN protein from the intact copies of SMN2 present in SMA patients can offer a therapeutic approach for SMA. Indeed, masking the 3\u2032 splice site of SMN2 intron 7 using a 2\u2032OMePS SSO-induced \u03947TNFR2 from mouse serum was 10-fold more potent than that from mice treated with etanercept. Evidently etanercept was subject to in vivo degradation that reduced its activity, while SSO3274 continually induced additional \u03947TNFR2 protein, replenishing degraded or inactivated protein in circulation. Importantly, no SSO-induced toxicity was reported. Because SSOs induce the expression of endogenous protein, the likelihood of immune toxicity is very low. The ability of SSOs to produce therapeutic splice variants, such as \u03947TNFR2, for extended time periods and with a low likelihood of immune toxicity is a distinct advantage over biological drugs such as etanercept.\n\nIn a mouse model of infl ammatory liver disease, SSO3274 injected i.p. for 10 days at 25 mg/kg/day protected the liver from TNF-\u03b1 insult and prevented liver damage. The observed anti-infl ammatory effects were likely enhanced by the ability of SSO3274 to simultaneously downregulate TNFR2 while inducing \u03947TNFR2 in the liver. Importantly, etanercept administered at a dose comparable to the amount of \u03947TNFR2 induced by SSO3274 elicited no such protection. The 10-day dosing regimen also delayed the course of disease in a mouse model of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis. These results are notable given that 30% of rheumatoid arthritis patients do not respond to currently available drugs treatments (Pincus et al., 1999; Olsen and Stein, 2004) .\n\nMyD88 is an adapter protein that mediates proinfl ammatory cytokine signaling through IL-1 and Toll receptors. Upon receptor activation, MyD88 interacts with the receptor intracellular domain and recruits IL-1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) and IRAK-4, leading to the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. A naturally occurring splice variant of MyD88, MyD88 S , results from exon 2 exclusion. MyD88 S retains its receptor-binding function but is defective in its ability to recruit IRAK-4 and induce IRAK-1 activation. As a result, MyD88 S functions as a dominant-negative regulator of IL-1R and Toll receptor signaling (Janssens et al., 2002) . Vickers et al. screened 20-mer MOE-PS SSOs targeted to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites of exon 2 and selected ISIS 337846, an SSO that switched splicing from MyD88 to MyD88 S in mouse and human cells. ISIS 337846 induced redirection of MyD88 mRNA splicing in the liver, adipose tissue, and intestine of mice i.p. injected three times per week for 3 weeks with 50 mg/kg SSO, although no MyD88 S protein was detected. This regimen abrogated pro-infl ammatory IL-1\u03b2 signaling in the liver (Vickers et al., 2006) .\n\nDystrophia myotonica type 1 (DM1), a common muscular dystrophy among adults, is caused by amplifi ed CTG repeats in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (DMPK) gene (Brook et al., 1992) . DMPK transcripts containing amplifi ed CUG repeats (CUG amp ) cause abnormal regulation of alternative splicing, which selectively affects a specifi c group of genes that includes chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) (Mankodi et al., 2002) . Interestingly, misregulated splicing of ClC-1, causing inclusion of exon 7a, was found to be necessary for the development of myotonia in two mouse In a subsequent study, SMN2 exon 7 was saturated with overlapping MOE SSOs (Hua et al., 2007) . The cell culture experiments revealed that the most effective SSOs, which promoted exon 7 inclusion and increased full-length SMN protein in SMA patient fi broblasts, were targeted to two putative ESSs close to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 splice sites, respectively. These results imply that blocking of the ESS is suffi cient to induce exon inclusion and that ESSENCE or TOES modifi cations, although most likley helpful, are not essential.\n\nSSO targeted to a putative ISS in intron 6 identifi ed also prompted an increase in exon 7 inclusion in the context of a SMN2 minigene (Miyajima et al., 2002) . The ISS, called ISS-N1, was subsequently identifi ed immediately downstream of the 5\u2032 splice site of intron 7 (Singh et al., 2006) . An extensive SSO screen of sequences downstream of the 5\u2032 splice site in intron 7 identifi ed the same ISS (Hua et al., 2008) . Recently, MOE-PS SSO targeted to ISS-N1 was administered to human SMN2 (hSMN2) transgenic mice by biweekly i.v. injections at 25 mg/kg. Signifi cant exon 7 inclusion was observed in the liver and kidney, but not in the spinal cord of treated mice (Hua et al., 2008) . In order to achieve the therapeutic effect of this strategy in SMA, the SSO would need to cross the blood-brain barrier or be delivered directly to the central nervous system (CNS); this remains a major obstacle in gene therapy for CNS targets.\n\nThe cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) plays an important role in infl ammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and hepatitis. TNF-\u03b1 signaling is mediated by two membrane-bound receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which trimerize upon ligand binding, leading to downstream activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. Approved anti-TNF-\u03b1 macromolecular biologic drugs etanercept (a dimerized TNFR2 receptor:Fc fusion protein), and infl iximab and adalimumab (anti-TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies), bind TNF-\u03b1 in circulation and block its infl ammatory effects.\n\nResearchers in this laboratory hypothesized that exclusion of the transmembrane domain-encoding exon 7 would create a novel soluble protein, \u03947TNFR2, capable of antagonizing TNF-\u03b1 signaling (Fig. 2B) . Screen of 16-mer SSOs consisting of alternating LNA-DNA nucleotides with PS linkages in L929 mouse cells identifi ed SSO3274, which effi ciently blocked the 5\u2032 splice site of exon 7 in TNFR2 pre-mRNA, inducing exon skipping in a sequence-specifi c and dose-dependent manner. SSO3274-induced exon skipping resulted in the expression of soluble \u03947TNFR2 protein, which was detected in the culture medium and which exhibited anti-TNF activity (Graziewicz et al., 2008) .\n\nLocked nucleic acid SSOs are exceptionally potent in the liver, where TNFR2 is highly expressed (Roberts et al., 2006) . This led to an approach to utilize the liver as a \"protein factory,\" producing soluble \u03947TNFR2 for release into circulation to antagonize TNF-\u03b1. As expected, SSO3274 induced sequence-specifi c, dose-dependent, persistent splice switching in the mouse liver after 5 daily i.p. injectons at 25mg/kg/day. \u03947TNFR2 protein was detected in the serum of SSO3274-treated animals at 8,000-10,000 pg/mL, exhibited potent anti-TNF activity and was detectable in the circulation up to 35 days after the last injection. Interestingly, manner, thereby downregulating full-length HER2 while producing a novel splice variant lacking the transmembrane domain, \u039415HER2. In SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells, which highly express HER2, SSO111-induced splice switching potently inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis. This effect was less pronounced in MCF7 cells, in which HER2 expression is 100-fold lower, despite the fact that splice switching was still observed, confi rming that SSO111induced growth inhibition was HER2-dependent. This was consistent with the previously reported correlation of SSO potency with increased target gene expression (Mercatante et al., 2002) . It also indicates that tumors highly expressing HER2 would be more sensitive to SSO treatment than surrounding healthy tissue. While \u039415HER2 protein encoded by the SSO-induced \u039415HER2 mRNA could not be detected, it was demonstrated that \u039415HER2-His protein potently downregulated HER2 protein expression and inhibited HER3 activation in a dose-dependent manner when added exogenously to SK-BR-3 cells (Wan et al., 2008) .\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, immune defects and predisposition to malignancy. Ataxiatelangiectasia is caused by mutations in the A-T mutated (ATM) gene, half of which disrupt splicing (Teraoka et al., 1999) . Recently, 25-mer PMO SSOs were used to block the activation of cryptic splice sites in cell lines representing three types of A-T splicing defect: a 5\u2032 exonic cryptic splice site in TAT[C] cells, a 3\u2032 exonic cryptic splice site in IRAT9 cells, and a pseudoexon inclusion in AT203LA cells (Du et al., 2007) . In each case dose-dependent, sequence-specifi c splice correction was achieved, leading to upregulation of functional ATM protein. These fi ndings are especially promising in light of evidence that only a small amount of functional protein (5%-20% wild-type levels) is necessary to signifi cantly ameliorate the disease phenotype (Gilad et al., 1998) .\n\nApolipoprotein B (APOB) is the primary apolipoprotein in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and chylomicron lipoprotein particles. Apolipoprotein B is expressed as two protein isoforms, APOB100 and APOB48. APOB100 results from the inclusion of all 29 exons from APOB pre-mRNA and necessary for synthesis of LDL and Lp(a) particles in the liver, which contribute to atherogenesis. Thus, targeting APOB100 for downregulation is a strategy for lowering LDL and cholesterol levels in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease (Soutschek et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2006) . APOB48 is a C-terminally truncated protein that results from tissue-specifi c RNA editing in exon 26 that introduces a premature stop codon. Expressed only in the intestine, APOB48 is necessary for chylomicron assembly and intestinal fat transport.\n\nIn order to downregulate APOB100 without affecting APOB48 expression, Khoo et al. designed a 2\u2032OMe SSO aimed at skipping exon 27 to create a novel splice variant, APOB87 skip27 , that could mimic APOB48 function. models of DM1 (HSA LR and Mbnl1 \u0394E3/\u0394E3 mice) (Wheeler et al., 2007) . Inclusion of exon 7a in ClC-1 caused the introduction of a premature stop codon and translation of a nonfunctional truncated protein. Wheeler et al. screened 25-mer PMO SSOs targeting the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites of exon 7a to restore normal ClC-1 splicing. The SSOs were simultaneously injected (5 \u03bcg each) into the tibialis anterior muscle of HSA LR mice, accompanied by voltage pulses to electroporate muscle fi bers and improve uptake. A single injection of the SSOs induced sequence-specifi c exon 7a skipping that persisted for at least 3 weeks. Splice-switching oligonucleotide-induced splice switching of ClC-1 increased the level of wild-type ClC-1 protein, rescued ClC-1 channel function, and reversed myotonia in skeletal muscle. Similar results were observed in Mbnl1 \u0394E3/ \u0394E3 mice (Wheeler et al., 2007) . This SSO-based strategy is noteworthy in that it affects the proposed underlying mechanism of the disease, whereas currently available drugs for DM1 provide only partial relief of the symptoms (Trip et al., 2006) .\n\nMenkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by generalized copper defi ciency characterized by growth retardation and neurodegeneration, leading to death in early infancy (Menkes et al., 1962) . It is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ATP7A gene encoding a P-type ATPase necessary for copper absorption and homeostasis (Lutsenko et al., 2007) . Splicing defects in the zebrafi sh ortholog of ATP7A produce calamity, a zebrafi sh model of the Menkes phenotype (Mendelsohn et al., 2006) . The defect in calamity vu69 is caused by the creation of an aberrant 3\u2032 splice site in exon 9 of ATP7A. By screening 25-mer PMO SSOs targeted to the aberrant splice site, Madsen et al. identifi ed two SSOs that restore normal splicing and wild-type protein production in calamity vu69 embryos (Madsen et al., 2008) . Importantly, a single injection of PMO SSO achieved full rescue of the mutant phenotype that persisted for at least 6 days after fertilization, when 75% of untreated calamity embryos were dead or dysmorphic (Madsen et al., 2008) .\n\nHER2 belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is amplifi ed or overexpressed in many human cancers, including 25%-30% of breast cancers. Increased HER2 expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and decreased survival. Although it has no known ligand, HER2 forms constitutively active homodimers in HER2-overexpressing cells, signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. In addition, on ligand-induced activation, other EGFR family members preferentially recruit HER2 and form activated heterodimers. Herstatin, a naturally occurring splice variant of HER2, is produced by intron 8 inclusion and functions as a negative regulator of HER2 signaling (Doherty et al., 1999) .\n\nTo develop a Herstatin-like antagonist of HER2 this laboratory screened a series of 20-mer MOE-PS SSOs designed to modulate splicing of HER2 pre-mRNA. SSO111 induced exon 15 skipping in a sequence-specifi c, dose-dependent (Jearawiriyapaisarn et al., 2008) . Because up to 50% of human disease-causing mutations affect splicing, the SSO approach is emerging as a promising alternative to gene therapy.\n\nInterestingly, SSOs targeted to either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice site of exon 27, or the branch point of intron 26 were ineffective at inducing exon 27 skipping. However, SSO targeting two of these sequences simultaneously did achieve exon 27 skipping in a dose-dependent, sequence-specifi c manner, as did SSOs targeted to putative exonic splicing enhancer motifs within exon 27, albeit to a lesser degree (Khoo et al., 2007) . The authors further showed that SSO-induced skipping of exon 27 resulted in translation of the APOB87 skip27 isoform and that this protein was secreted by cells in culture (Khoo et al., 2007) .\n\nPropionic and methylmalonic acidemias, the two most frequent organic acidemias, are characterized by the lack of propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC) and methylmalo-nylCoA mutase (MCM), respectively, which are the enzymes involved in the catabolism of amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol. The PCC-\u03b1 subunit (PCCA) and PCC-\u03b2 subunit (PCCB) genes encode the two subunits of PCC enzyme, and the MUT gene encodes MCM enzyme. An IVS14-1416 (A>G) mutation in PCCA intron 14 creates novel ESE sequences favoring cryptic 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 splice sites of a pseudoexon. The IVS6-462 (A>G) mutation in PCCB intron 6 and the IVS11-891 (C>A) mutation in MUT intron 11 increase the cryptic 5\u2032 splice site score of the pseudoexon. These three mutations in the intron promote the inclusion of the pseudoexon in the mRNAs, resulting in a frameshift mutation. This generates transcripts containing a premature termination codon, which leads to the production of truncated, nonfunctional protein.\n\nBlocking either the cryptic 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 splice sites by PMO complexed with a peptide carrier (Endo-Porter; Gene Tools) restored almost 100% correct splicing in fi broblasts from patients carrying mutations in PCCA, PCCB, or MUT (Ugarte et al., 2007) . The correctly spliced MUT mRNA persisted for 15 days after treatment, confi rming that the PMO was very stable in the cells. The enzymatic activities of PCC and MCM were fully recovered after treatment. This result is notable given that only 30%-40% of normal enzymatic activity is necessary for therapeutic effect. Since there are several oligonucleotide modifi cations that are effi ciently delivered to liver, which is the target tissue for these diseases, there are multiple potential avenues for therapeutic application in vivo.\n\nThe number of clinically relevant targets of SSOs has expanded since this technology was pioneered by our laboratory (Dominski and Kole, 1993) . Among these targets, DMD, which is currently being tested in clinical trials, is the most promising. Recent results from DMD patients in work by van Deutekom et al. suggest that SSOs constitute a realistic approach for therapeutic application. The advantage of this approach is that SSOs target the pre-mRNA transcribed from native genes in their normal regulatory environment, thereby avoiding the problem of inappropriate transgene expression in conventional gene therapy. While delivery remains a major obstacle, cell-penetrating peptides have been shown to signifi cantly enhance SSO delivery without toxicity"}
