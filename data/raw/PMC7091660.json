{"title": "Prematurity, a significant predictor for worse outcome in viral bronchiolitis: a comparative study in infancy", "body": "Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in children less than 1 year of age and is usually of viral etiology [1]. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most commonly causing virus and identified in 60\u201370% of hospitalized infant with bronchiolitis [2]. Bronchiolitis by itself accounts for the greatest number of hospitalization in infancy during the fall and winter season [3].\n\nBronchiolitis is a self-limiting condition but may be life threating causing significant severe illness [4\u20136], and it is the most common cause of hospital admission for infant beyond the neonatal period with rate varying between 1 and 3%. Furthermore, approximately 10% of hospitalized infants will need intensive care admission [7\u201310].\n\nThe rate of admissions to hospital with bronchiolitis has increased over the past 10 years. The reasons for this are not fully understood and are likely to be multifactorial and include improved survival of preterm infants [11].\n\nEpidemiological evidence revealed that young age (less than 6\u201312 weeks) and premature birth (less than 37 weeks) are associated with high risk of severe bronchiolitis [7, 12, 13].\n\nThe aim of the present study was to assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in healthy preterm compared to healthy term infants in terms of the duration of hospital stay, oxygen saturation and duration of oxygen requirement, and ICU and/or MV requirement.\n\nThis prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants in the first year of life with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, according to American Academy of Pediatrics [14], and all were admitted to inpatient departments at the Cairo University Specialized Pediatric Hospital. Seventy-four of those infants were healthy preterm (less than 37 weeks) and 79 infants were healthy term. The following specific groups were excluded: neonates, recurrent wheeze, and association of underlying chronic diseases.\n\nThis study was approved by the Cairo University Clinical Research Ethics Committee, and informed verbal consents were obtained from parents of the included children. The study design conformed to the Revised Helsinki Declaration of Bioethics.\n\nComplete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined at the time of study enrollment for each patient. Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were obtained for PCR at the time of presentation and put in viral transport media (VTM).\n\nTotal nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the NP/OP swabs by the automated KingFisher Flex Magnetic Particle Processor (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) using MagMAX Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Cat No. AM 1840, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the viral targets were amplified using specific primers and probes produced by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA, and following standard protocol for quantitative reverse transcription PCR detection.\n\nDetection of influenza viruses was conducted in the Cairo University Hospital laboratory and confirmed by the Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3) laboratory. The samples were screened for the presence of influenza A and B using the CDC kit for influenza following CDC protocol [16]. Samples positive for influenza A were further subtyped according to the CDC protocol to the following types: pandemic influenza 2009 A(H1N1) and seasonal H1 and H3.\n\nTesting for adenovirus; human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (hPIV); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was done at NAMRU-3 laboratory by RT-qPCR using CDC specific primers and probes and following a CDC protocol for the detection of non-influenza viruses. Samples were considered positive to the viral target if the amplification curve crossed the threshold line before cycle 40. All clinical samples had to be positive for the human RNAse P gene (RP), with a Ct value \u2264 37, for validation. A positive control for each virus was added to each run to ensure adequate amplification of the target genes.\n\nPrecoded data was entered on the Statistical Package of Social Science Software program, version 23 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY, IBM Corp.) to be statistically analyzed. Data was presented using mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables and frequency and percentage for qualitative ones. Comparison between groups was performed using independent sample t test or Mann-Whitney for quantitative variables and chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact test for qualitative ones. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to estimate the association between different quantitative variables. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nThe study included 153 infants with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis in otherwise healthy infants. Seventy-nine of them were term and 74 were preterm infants. The detailed demographic characteristics including risk factors for bronchiolitis of both preterm and term infants are summarized in Table 1. Preterm infants were significantly younger than term infants (P value 0.001).\n\nClinical findings at the time of presentation, BSS, and outcomes of both groups are shown in Table 2. BSS (Mean \u00b1 SD) was significantly more severe for preterm compared to term infants at time of presentation (P value 0.045). Also, preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay, and mean duration of oxygen therapy compared to term group (P value 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). Preterm infants were significantly more likely to need ICU admission (P value 0.007) and MV (P value 0.033) than term infants.\n\nViral screening results are summarized in Table 3. Respiratory viruses were detected in 36 (48.6%) preterm patients and in 53 (67%) term patients with acute bronchiolitis. RSV was the most commonly detected virus in both groups, although, more significantly frequent in term infants (57%) than preterm infants (32.4%) (P value 0.003). On the other hand, adenovirus was more significantly frequent in preterm than term infants (16.2% and 5.1%; respectively, P value 0.033). Concomitantly with the viral respiratory infection, preterm patients had more frequent concomitant bacterial infections than term despite non-significance (P value 0.221).\n\nOn comparing BSS of different viral agents in preterm and term infants, the mean (\u00b1 SD) score for h-MPV, RSV, and para-influenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared to term infants (P value 0.003, 0.009, and 0.013, respectively), as shown in Table 4.\n\nOn correlating bronchiolitis severity score to screened viruses and outcome in both groups mixed viral infection did not correlate with severity scoring of bronchiolitis in preterm and term groups (P value. 0.723, 0.537, respectively). However, bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups (P value < 0.001). Also, we found significant correlation between BSS and need for admission. Also, there was significant correlation between severity and duration of hospital stay and oxygen therapy as are shown in Table 5.\n\nLimiting this study is a possible underestimation of viral etiologies of acute bronchiolitis because testing for rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and other viruses was not done, and these viruses were previously detected in such patients [32\u201335]. Also, the enrolled patients were from a single tertiary institution which is a referral center for many local hospitals, so enrolled cases may be more ill than those at other hospitals. The enrolled patients were inpatients only, while patients with mild respiratory symptoms did not undergo diagnostic testing for viral infections; they were treated in outpatient clinics and this could further direct results towards a more severe population and could influence the scores.\n\nPrematurity is one of the risk factors that significantly affect the bronchiolitis severity, and this underscores the importance of early categorization of these infants as a high-risk group on their first visit. Physicians treating preterm infants with bronchiolitis should be aware that their illness runs a more severe course than term infant, even if they have no underlying disorders."}
