The influenza virus is highly contagious and represents a common cause of respiratory infection with local and systemic symptoms. Annual influenza epidemics account for considerable morbidity and mortality 1 and influenza outbreaks have the potential to become pandemics 2 . Effective control and management of seasonal and pandemic influenza is a high priority for national governments. Routine use of antiviral agents is rare in European primary care 3 . General practitioners (GPs) in Europe usually advise patients who consult with influenza-like illness (ILI) to take paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), either as required or at regular intervals. They may also provide advice about other over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms, e.g.\n\nmaintaining fluids, bed rest and taking time off work or school. This broad approach is currently considered best usual care for the empirical management of ILI in Europe 4-6 .\n\nCurrently, the most suitable antiviral agent available for pragmatic evaluation in ALIC 4 E is oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae), a neuraminidase inhibitor (NI). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oseltamivir in 1999. Oseltamivir was classified by the WHO as an essential medicine until 2017 7 8 , and many countries have stockpiles of the drug to ensure it is readily available to treat seasonal and pandemic influenza 3 .\n\nOseltamivir phosphate is an oral pro-drug which undergoes hydrolysis by hepatic esterase to form active oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate acts by selective inhibition of influenza A and B viral neuraminidase. This enzyme normally promotes release of the virus from infected cells by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues on the surface of host cells and influenza virus envelopes, and facilitates viral movement within the respiratory tract. By blocking the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir prevents new viral particles from being released 9 10 . Oseltamivir might also modify the immune response to influenza infection by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which might, in turn, modulate symptoms of influenza 11 . Industry-sponsored trials (or studies), efficacy studies and clinical study reports of NIs, most often oseltamivir, have been the subject of many systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including individual patient meta-analyses [12] [13] [14] . In two meta-analyses differing in methodology and primary outcome measures but based on almost the same set of trials, Jefferson et al. found that oseltamivir improved the mean time to first alleviation of symptoms over the placebo by 16.8 hours 11 and Dobson et al. found oseltamivir improved the median time to alleviation of all symptoms over the placebo by 17.8 hours 13 . The reviewers also found that oseltamivir reduced the risk of self-reported, non-verified pneumonia but not for clinically diagnosed pneumonia 11 13 . Dobson et al. furthermore\n\nindicated that treatment with oseltamivir might reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infection complications and hospitalization in patients testing positive for influenza 13 .\n\nHowever, increased nausea and vomiting were found to be likely associated with oseltamivir use 11 13 . Even with a possible reduction in symptomatic period (compared to a placebo) the value of oseltamivir treatment of previously healthy individuals with non-severe seasonal influenza is questionable. Conversely, circumstances of some individuals, for example those needing to return to work and parents and other carers, may mean that a reduction in function-limiting symptoms of a day may be hugely beneficial. The UK Academy of Medical Sciences recently reviewed current evidence and advise that cost-effectiveness analyses related to the virulence and severity of symptoms of the circulating strain considering a societal perspective are needed to further inform such judgements 15 .\n\nSince 1999, oseltamivir has generated sales in excess of $18bn (\u00a311bn; \u20ac13bn). The United\n\nStates stockpiled 65 million treatments at a cost of $1.3bn. The United Kingdom spent \u00a3424m on a stockpile of 40 million doses. By 2009, 96 countries possessed enough oseltamivir for 350 million people [4] . In 2017 the WHO downgraded oseltamivir in the list of essential medicines from a \"core\" drug to one that is \"complimentary\"-a category of drugs considered less cost-effective 7 8 . However, there has never been a large-scale, international, publically funded, pragmatic RCT of its cost-effectiveness in primary care, and so the evidence base either to support or not support the routine use of this agent in primary care is inadequate and raises the question: does the effect found in previous efficacy studies translate into a meaningful benefit in every day primary care? Specifically, what are the overall costs and benefits of this possible shortened symptom duration from the perspective of the individual sufferer, the health services, and for society? Do patients considered to be at higher risk for complications of influenza (for example due to age, duration and severity of Answering these questions will reduce important clinical uncertainty for primary care clinicians about whether to prescribe antiviral agents for ILI, and whether or not to prioritise antiviral treatment for subgroups of primary care patients.\n\nThe ALIC 4 E trial will be delivered as work package (WP) 4 of the Platform for European\n\nPreparedness Against (Re-) emerging Epidemics (PREPARE: www.prepare-europe.org) consortium grant. PREPARE is a European Commission funded network for the rapid and efficient delivery of harmonised, large-scale clinical research studies on infectious diseases (ID) 16 . ALIC 4 E will be a randomised controlled trial of investigational medicinal products (CTIMP) in primary care that will determine the clinical-and cost-effectiveness of adding antiviral agents to best usual primary care for patients with specific characteristics suffering from ILI, and thus enable clinicians to better individualise prescribing decisions.\n\nThe primary objective of ALIC 4 E is therefore to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time taken to return to usual daily activity.\n\nSecondary objectives will be to determine whether antiviral treatment is cost-effective;\n\nbenefits pre-specified subgroups of participants; decreases hospital admissions; decreases complications related to ILI, especially pneumonia; improves the health-related quality of life, decreases (repeat) attendance at the GP, or other health services; decreases time to first reduction, time to alleviation, and new/worsening of ILI symptoms; reduces the use of over the counter (OTC) and prescribed medication, including antibiotics, and; affects the selfmanagement of ILI symptoms.\n\nThe protocol for ALIC 4 \n\nRecommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines. informed consent before participation. The study will be conducted (using Good Clinical practice guidelines) according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with other relevant national guidelines, regulations, and acts. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review efficacy and safety data by treatment allocation, and a Trial Steering Committee will provide oversight of the trial.\n\nNetworks and participants 21 primary care clinical research networks in 15 European countries will recruit participants ( Figure 1 ), and each network will co-ordinate the recruiting sites within their network.\n\nRecruitment will be over three consecutive flu seasons, Q4 2015 to Q1/2 2018. Each season's start and end of recruitment will be based on local influenza-like illness incidence rising above (or falling below) pre-specified thresholds, using information supplied by the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 17 , local and regional sources for each network.\n\nWe aim to recruit a minimum of 2500 participants through recruiting sites (GP Practice, primary care Out of Hours (OOH) service or Paediatric Centres within primary care).\n\nPotential participants will be identified when they present to the recruiting sites with symptoms of ILI, or when they telephone for an appointment or advice about their symptoms.\n\nParticipants must meet the inclusion criteria (including symptom onset of 72 hours or less) and have none of the exclusion criteria (Table 1) . If eligible and willing to participate, the participant will complete the rest of the initial trial procedures either within the same visit, or at a second appointment with a recruiter at the recruiting site, or at home. \u2022 Condition or treatment associated with significant impaired immunity (e.g. long-term oral steroids, chemotherapy, or immune disorder) (known=recorded in participant's clinical records)\n\n\u2022 Those who in the opinion of the responsible clinician should be prescribed immediate antiviral treatment The local implementation of the trial has built-in flexibility and local network recruitment processes vary. For example, medical students may assist with recruitment tasks in certain practices, while others will incorporate triage systems or additional trial specific clinics and/or research support staff in their recruitment processes. \n\nAfter obtaining consent, participants will be randomised at the point of care using a remote online electronic data capture (EDC) system (Research Online 2). Emergency randomisation procedures will be available should this web-based facility be temporarily unavailable.\n\nRandomisation will initially be a 1:1 ratio between the two arms, with stratification by subgroup according to ECDC definitions of those at higher risk of complications from influenza, namely their age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), any relevant comorbidity i (yes/no), and duration of symptoms since onset (\u226448hours/>48-72hours). The proportions randomised to study arms may be altered during the course of the trial following a pre-specified Bayesian, response adaptive approach 18 19 . Clinicians do not prescribe placebos, and so the credible comparator is current best practice 20 . Therefore, no un-blinding or code breaking is required in the event of a relevant emergency. However, the trial team will be blind to treatment allocation at the aggregate level. The recruiter will create equipoise for the participant about the two arms which will be carefully covered in trial specific training, and each arm of the trial will be supported as in routine practice; previous open pragmatic trials have been able to minimise placebo effects using this approach 21 22 .\n\nParticipants randomised to best usual primary care plus oseltamivir arm will be given a dose \n\nThe primary outcome is patient reported time to having both returned to usual daily activity, and 'fever', 'headache' and 'muscle-ache' symptoms all rated as \u2264minor problem. For nonverbal children, 'clinginess' will replace 'headache' and 'muscle ache', when both are unanswered.\n\nSecondary outcomes will include (collected up to day 28):\n\n\u2022 Additionally, clinical examination findings will be recorded including: temperature and the way it was measured (oral, ear or axilla); use of antipyretics in the last 4 hours; pulse rate; weight (\u226412 years of age or in cases of uncertainty); height; smoking status; gender; and whether they have had flu vaccination within six months and pneumococcal vaccination within five years.\n\nThe recruiter will provide antiviral medication according to the participant's group allocation and standardised instructions on how to take the medication. The recruiter will also take an oropharyngeal and a nasal swab (COPAN\u00ae) from those <16 years of age and a nasopharyngeal swab (COPAN\u00ae) from those \u226516 years of age. All swabs will be placed in 3mL universal transport media (UTM) and transported to a local laboratory for storage.\n\nFinally, they will instruct participants how to complete the Symptom Diary and give information about telephone follow-up assessments.\n\nThere is no requirement for participants to attend a face-to-face follow-up visit as part of their study participation, as all subsequent measurements will be ascertained by self-completed diary-based questionnaires and through telephone calls from the local trial team.\n\nParticipants (or their legal guardian or their carer) will be asked to complete a Symptom Participants and legal guardians will be telephoned on day three (+/-one day) (with day one defined as the day they were recruited into the study) to offer support with Symptom Diary completion and to check for any urgent issues. They will also be telephoned on day 14 (up to day 28) and asked on what day they returned to their usual daily activity, if and when their fever, head-and muscle-ache symptoms reduced to minor severity or less to ensure the primary end point is collected for all participants, and to ascertain any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the preceding two weeks. Participants will receive a final telephone call on or after day 28 to complete a verbal EQ-5D-5L/3Y and VAS, to answer remaining questions about symptom resolution if needed, and about their trial participation and consent process as part of a process evaluation (see below). The trial team will ask whether participants have had a recurrence of their symptoms during this time and whether they have been admitted into hospital as a result of their symptoms.\n\nParticipants who have visited the hospital with complications possibly related to ILI and who have had a chest X-ray will have their primary care clinical records examined by the trial team for confirmation of relevant diagnoses of complications, including pneumonia.\n\nOnce the swabs have been received at local laboratories, samples will be frozen and stored at -70\u00b0C (-20\u00b0C is acceptable if there is no deep-freezer). After each flu season, samples will be transported to the Laboratory of Medical Microbiology, University of Antwerp, Belgium for analysis. Each participant's swab(s) will be analysed using a Multiplex RT-PCR for detection of pathogen genes by TaqMan\u00ae technology to identify whether or not the participant is infected with influenza A or B, with other respiratory viruses ii , or with bacteria iii .\n\nAs part of the day 28 telephone call to the participants or legal guardians or carers, questions will be asked about motivation for participating in the ALIC 4 E study, what influenced that decision, and questions related to research participation during a pandemic.\n\nAll participating clinicians will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, and a sub-sample of approximately 50 will be interviewed using a semi-structured topic guide to obtain their perspectives on the trial process, their views of influenza management in primary care, and participation in pandemic research. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   Response Adaptive-Platform Trial Design   An \"adaptive platform trial\" enables multiple interventions for the same indication to be   tested simultaneously within a master protocol, and often includes the capacity to add, or drop, study arms while the study is in progress 24 25 . Platform trials provide an effective framework to study patient heterogeneity in outcomes, with the goal of determining the best treatment for various subgroups of patients. In addition, platform trial designs can incorporate response adaptive randomization in order to randomize more participants to the best performing interventions during the course of the trial. This can increase statistical power and efficiency of the trial, as well as lead to better patient outcomes over the course of the study 26 .\n\nWe chose an adaptive platform trial design because it provided flexibility to evaluate additional interventions in the trial, should interventions emerge that are suitable to pragmatic evaluation in primary care. Additionally, the design provides the ability to prospectively identify particular subgroups of interest that may receive benefit from antiviral agents, as opposed to estimating a single overall effect. This is done by incorporating a Bayesian modelling approach, combined with response adaptive randomization based on pre-specified participant characteristics. There will be multiple interim analyses during recruitment;\n\nplanned every 750 patients and between flu seasons.\n\nIn ALIC 4 E, participants will be initially randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms, with stratification by subgroup and random blocks. Each arm will maintain at least a 10% probability of randomisation within each subgroup throughout the course of the trial. Arm superiority will be assessed by subgroup and may be declared superior in some subgroups, but not within others. If, at an interim analysis, an arm meets the superiority criterion for one of the treatments, randomization probabilities may be modified for those subgroups such that a minimum of 10% of participants are allocated to the inferior arm, with the remaining allocation to the superior arm (a maximum of 90%, if two arms). In this event, stratification and blocking will no longer occur within these subgroups. This will ensure the majority of participants receive the best-known therapy, yet the trial design will still allow the assessment of seasonal variation and population changes in the study population over time. In addition, we will still be able to collect data about costs and health related behaviours (including health care seeking) associated with a poorly performing arm. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   New comparator arms may enter the trial as determined by the Trial Steering Committee.   Eligible therapies will include newly approved treatments for ILI or therapies recommended   by public health agencies during an influenza pandemic. If an arm is added to the trial, there is a pre-specified algorithm determining randomization ratios, and for activating response adaptive randomization within subgroups to the respective treatment arms. The operating characteristics of the trial will be updated via simulation; however the general structure of the trial does not change. Response adaptive randomization may be activated in subgroups without satisfying superiority criterion only if the number of interventions is greater than two.\n\nA sample size calculation for the planned design is not available using traditional formulas.\n\nInstead, simulations must be used to estimate the operating characteristics of the adaptive algorithm, including estimates of how many participants with particular characteristics are required in order to detect differences in treatments. In these simulations, the pre-specified algorithm will be applied such that the randomization of participants with particular prespecified characteristics will depend on the number of arms and the collected outcome data.\n\nIn addition, the algorithm will determine when arms are dropped for futility, when an intervention is declared superior, and will have a process for adding a new intervention to the platform trial.\n\nBetween 2500 and 4500 participants will be recruited during three consecutive winters. This range of numbers has been chosen to ensure sufficient power for comparisons in the overall population, as well as within the pre-specified subgroups. Given the nature of the study's adaptive design and the desire to ensure sufficient power for multiple hypotheses across several subgroups, the number of participants needed to be recruited is a complex multidimensional calculation. Hence, numerous simulations were conducted to calculate power under various plausible scenarios. The maximum target of 4500 participants was chosen from these simulations because it gave over 80% power for many of the subgroup analyses with a one day benefit in terms of symptoms relief from oseltamivir. 2500 participants will provide over 99% power for comparing the primary end point in the overall study population where there is at least one day benefit of oseltamivir for participants with confirmed influenza. This number will also provide >80% power for all subgroups if there is a 2-day benefit of oseltamivir in participants with confirmed influenza. We based these simulations on the \n\nThe primary analysis will be intention to treat (ITT) and will include all randomised participants in the treatment arm they were assigned regardless of treatment taken. Secondary analyses will include the subset of the ITT population with confirmed influenza. As accrual to the trial is on-going, there will be frequent interim analyses that may update the randomization probabilities depending on interim results and the number of arms in the study.\n\nThe composite primary endpoint of return to usual activities with resolution of any fever, muscle-and headache to a minor problem or less will be modelled according to a Bayesian piece-wise exponential model. This is a survival time model that allows the baseline hazard to vary across follow-up. The hazard for reaching the primary endpoint will be modelled during four time intervals -0-2 day, 3-5 days, 6-10 days, and 11 or more days. Participants not reaching the primary endpoint by 28 days (including participants that die) will be considered censored at 28 days. Participants who withdraw, are lost to follow-up, or not evaluated for the primary endpoint for any reason will be considered censored at their last contact date or 28 days, whichever is earlier.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will compare the direct medical costs and health outcomes (in terms of number of days where ILI limits usual activities and in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years gained) between the different arms. The analysis will use data from the trial (resource use, EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3Y and VAS scores), and other relevant data from the countries in which the trial is set (e.g., unit costs, and type of health care provided within each country). Potential differences in repeated measures (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3Y and VAS) between arms will be investigated on a per-participant basis using mixed effects models.\n\nValuation of quality of life (using a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status) will be done in accordance with the guidelines of the Euroqol group 27 , using the 'EQ-5D-5L Crosswalk Index Value Calculator'.\n\nUncertainty will be explored using bootstrapping to represent clouds of Incremental Costeffectiveness Ratios (ICERs) on the cost-effectiveness plane, as well as cost-effectiveness \n\nThe ALIC 4 E Trial will be the first large-scale, international, non-industry sponsored, pragmatic, randomised trial of (cost-)effectiveness of adding oseltamivir to best usual primary care for people suffering from ILI. It will be an open trial in order to approximate effects in conditions close to those of usual care in order to determine real-world estimates of (cost-) effectiveness.\n\nThe lack of cost-effectiveness analyses alongside clinical trials, and given that children, older people and people with co-morbidities are underrepresented in studies that have been done, has once again been highlighted after the WHO's decision to downgrade the status of oseltamivir 7 28 . Despite the lack of trial evidence, the 2017 WHO Model List of Essential\n\nMedicines states that the use of oseltamivir should be restricted to severe illness due to confirmed, or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill hospitalised patients 8 .\n\nAnother report quoting the WHO states: \"unless new information supporting the use in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks is provided, the next Expert Committee might consider oseltamivir for deletion\" 7 . The current UK and US guidelines recommend treatment of defined subgroups of frail patients and patients with increased risk for complications 4 29 .\n\nBecause the evidence base for these recommendations is incomplete, withholding treatment from these or other patients may possibly deny them benefit. By including a 'best usual primary care' arm, our study will determine the added benefit of antiviral agents over and above current practice for seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza. This information will be of great importance to the delivery of primary care for ILI, as well as enhance the evidence base around advocating self-care. In many EU countries, patients with ILI symptoms are advised not to consult but to self-manage, and patients with additional risk factors are seldom routinely treated with an antiviral agent. This is largely because of an absence of evidence about the cost-effectiveness overall and in sub-groups of interest.\n\nThe virulence, spread and type of circulating influenza strains varies from season to season.\n\nALIC 4 E aims to recruit over three winter/influenza seasons in 15 countries, thereby obtaining widely applicable data. Furthermore, the aim is to include a wide age-range of participants, as well as those with co-morbidities. Additionally, in the event of an influenza pandemic, or should additional intervention arms be included, a decision could be made to increase the maximum sample size.\n\nThe adaptive design offers several advantages over a traditional study design. Recruitment into a particular arm can be stopped once a pre-determined level of certainty about the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of treatment in that arm has reached a pre-defined estimated precision. Adaptive randomisation will increase the chances of participants being allocated to arms where their information will be most useful and to the intervention that is most effective for them. This can lead to better patient care and better patient outcomes as the trial progresses. Secondly, the platform design allows new intervention arms to be added to the trial, benefiting from comparisons with existing treatment arms in a head to head way.\n\nThis flexibility extends to a potential pandemic situation where additional or alternative interventions may be added according to governmental or public health recommendations. In this way, the study will remain current and relevant to clinical practice and evolving circumstances throughout.\n\nALIC 4 E will be novel in many ways. It will provide critical information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding oseltamivir to best known ILI management in conditions that approximate usual care both overall and in important, pre-specified subgroups. ALIC 4 E will directly impact current practice, either it will confirm best usual primary care, or it will lead to adaptations. \n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 \n\nALIC 4 E is a European multi-national, multi-centre, open-labelled, non-industry funded, pragmatic, adaptive-platform, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care, and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for five days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants \u22651 year old presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration \u226472 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed-up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, head-and muscle-ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), comorbidity (yes/no), and duration of symptoms (\u226448hours/>48-72 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia), use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, and use of overthe-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms. \n\n\u2022 ALIC 4 E will be the first publically funded, multi-country, pragmatic study determining whether antivirals should be routinely prescribed for influenza like illness (ILI) in primary care.\n\n\u2022 ALIC 4 E aims to go beyond determining the average treatment effect in a population to determining effects in patients with combinations of pre-specified characteristics (age, symptom duration, illness severity, and co-morbidities).\n\n\u2022 The platform design allows the study to remain relevant to evolving circumstances, with the ability to add treatments arms.\n\n\u2022 Response adaptation allows the proportion of participants with key characteristics allocated to study arms to be altered during the course of the trial according to emerging outcome data, so that participants' information will be most useful, and increasing their chances of receiving the intervention that will be most effective for them. Industry-sponsored trials (or studies), efficacy studies and clinical study reports of NIs, most often oseltamivir, have been the subject of many systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including individual patient meta-analyses [14] [15] [16] . In two recent meta-analyses that differed in their methods and the primary outcome measures used, but that included almost the same set 15 . However, increased nausea and vomiting were found to be associated with oseltamivir use 13, 15 . Even with a possible reduction in symptom duration (compared to a placebo) the value of oseltamivir treatment of previously healthy individuals with non-severe seasonal influenza is questionable.\n\nConversely, circumstances of some individuals, for example those urgently needing to return to work and parents and other carers, may mean that a reduction in function-limiting symptoms of a day may be considered very worthwhile. The UK Academy of Medical Sciences recently reviewed current evidence, and they advised that cost-effectiveness analyses that take virulence and severity of the circulating strain into account form a societal perspective are required to further inform such judgements 17 .\n\nSince 1999, oseltamivir has generated sales in excess of $18bn (\u00a311bn; \u20ac13bn). The United\n\nStates stockpiled 65 million treatments at a cost of $1.3bn. The United Kingdom spent \u00a3424m on a stockpile of 40 million doses. By 2009, 96 countries possessed enough oseltamivir for 350 million people 18 . In 2017 the WHO downgraded oseltamivir in the list of essential medicines from a \"core\" drug to one that is \"complimentary\"-a category of drugs considered less cost-effective 9,10 . However, there has never been a large-scale, international, publically funded, pragmatic RCT of its cost-effectiveness in primary care, and so the evidence base either to support or not support the routine use of this agent in primary care is inadequate and raises the question: does the effect found in previous efficacy studies translate into a meaningful benefit in every day primary care? Specifically, what are the overall costs and benefits of this possible shortened symptom duration from the perspective of the individual sufferer, the health services, and for society? Do patients considered to be at higher risk for complications of influenza (for example due to age, duration and severity of 19 . ALIC 4 E will be a randomised controlled trial of investigational medicinal products (CTIMP) in primary care that will determine the clinical-and cost-effectiveness of adding antiviral agents to best usual primary care for patients with specific characteristics suffering from ILI, and thus enable clinicians to better individualise prescribing decisions.\n\nThe primary objective of ALIC 4 E is therefore to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time taken to return to usual daily activity.\n\nSecondary objectives will be to determine whether antiviral treatment is cost-effective;\n\nbenefits pre-specified subgroups of participants; decreases hospital admissions; decreases complications related to ILI, especially pneumonia; improves the health-related quality of life, decreases (repeat) attendance at the GP, or other health services; decreases time to first reduction, time to alleviation, and new/worsening of ILI symptoms; reduces the use of over the counter (OTC) and prescribed medication, including antibiotics, and; affects the selfmanagement of ILI symptoms.\n\nThe protocol for ALIC 4 A manuscript with the results of the primary outcome will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Additional manuscripts will be report secondary outcomes, and be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe The intervention arm in ALIC 4 E is the use of an antiviral in addition to best usual primary care. The burden to participants was assessed by the TSC and considered minimal as the only antiviral currently being assessed in ALIC 4 E, oseltamivir, is a licensed medication with marketing authorisation globally. In the context of the ALIC 4 E Trial a standard dose of oseltamivir has been shown to be well tolerated. The study itself is only using the standard does of oseltamivir and is being used according to the marketing authorisation it has been granted.\n\nTrial participants will not be informed of the trial results directly. However, the results will be published on the PREPARE Consortium website (http://www.prepare-europe.eu/) and on the Nuffield Department of Primary Care website (https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/phctrials), both can be accessed freely. Recruitment will be over three consecutive flu seasons, Q4 2015 to Q1/2 2018. Each season's start and end of recruitment will be based on reports of local influenza-like illness incidence rising above (or falling below) pre-specified thresholds, using information supplied by the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 22 , and local and regional sources for each network.\n\nWe aim to recruit a minimum of 2500 participants through recruiting sites (GP Practice, primary care Out of Hours (OOH) service or Paediatric Centres within primary care).\n\nPotential participants will be identified when they present to the recruiting sites with symptoms of ILI, or when they telephone for an appointment or advice about their symptoms.\n\nParticipants must meet the inclusion criteria (including symptom onset of 72 hours or less) and have none of the exclusion criteria ( The local implementation of the trial has built-in flexibility and local network recruitment processes vary. For example, medical students may assist with recruitment tasks in certain practices, while others will incorporate triage systems or additional trial specific clinics and/or research support staff in their recruitment processes. Clinicians do not prescribe placebos in routine care, and so the credible comparator is current best practice 28 . Therefore, no un-blinding or code breaking is required in the event of a relevant emergency. However, the trial team will be blind to treatment allocation at the aggregate level. The recruiter will promote equipoise for the participant about the two arms which will be carefully covered in trial specific training, and each arm of the trial will be supported as in routine practice; previous open pragmatic trials have been able to minimise placebo effects using this approach 29,30 . Intervention Participants randomised to best usual primary care plus oseltamivir arm will be given a dose of 75 mg oseltamivir twice a day for five days by the oral route (capsules) for those \u226513 years. For those who are \u22651 year but <13 years the doses will be twice daily for 5 days in 12 . Weight will be measured in children \u226412 years of age during the recruitment visit for medication dosing. All other participants will be asked about their weight at the baseline assessment and measured in case of uncertainty. A daily Symptom Diary and subsequent day 14-28 telephone call will be used to monitor intervention compliance, and together with a telephone call after day 28, will also ascertain a minimal data set for some other outcomes.\n\nThe primary outcome is patient reported time to having both returned to usual daily activity, and 'fever', 'headache' and 'muscle-ache' symptoms all rated as '\u2264minor problem'. For nonverbal children, 'clinginess' will replace 'headache' and 'muscle ache', when both are unanswered.\n\nSecondary outcomes will include (collected up to day 28):\n\n\u2022 After obtaining written, informed consent, recruiters will complete a baseline Case Report Form (CRF). This will include the required information for randomisation: age; relevant comorbidities; duration of symptoms; clinician's rating of severity of ILI as mild, moderate or severe. In addition, the CRF will ascertain participant's/parent's severity grading for: and type of health care coverage (e.g. public, private or mixed). The symptom questions will be supplemented with child-specific questions so that the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness Flu Scale will be completed for children \u226412 years of age 31 .\n\nAdditionally, clinical examination findings will be recorded including: temperature and the way it was measured (oral, ear or axilla); use of antipyretics in the last 4 hours; pulse rate; weight (\u226412 years of age or in cases of uncertainty); height; smoking status; gender; and whether they have had flu vaccination within six months and pneumococcal vaccination within five years.\n\nThe recruiter will provide antiviral medication according to the participant's group allocation and standardised instructions on how to take the medication. The recruiter will also take an oropharyngeal and a nasal swab (COPAN\u00ae) from those <16 years of age and a nasopharyngeal swab (COPAN\u00ae) from those \u226516 years of age. All swabs will be placed in 3mL universal transport media (UTM) and transported to a local laboratory for storage.\n\nFinally, they will instruct participants how to complete the Symptom Diary and give information about telephone follow-up assessments.\n\nThere is no requirement for participants to attend a face-to-face follow-up visit as part of their study participation, as all subsequent measurements will be ascertained by self-completed diary-based questionnaires and through telephone calls from the local trial team.\n\nParticipants (or their legal guardian or their carer) will be asked to complete a Symptom Diary from day 1 (baseline) through to day 14 after randomisation. The following data points will be collected once: expectations of treatment benefit; ethnicity; employment status;\n\ncohabitation; pregnancy and stage; and current long-term medication. The following data points are collected daily in the diary: severity of selected ILI symptom; quality of life (EQ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)); return to usual daily activity; prescription medication use (including antibiotics); use of OTC medication or remedies; adherence to trial medication and potential side-effects (up to day 7). The following data points will be collected weekly:\n\nquality of life (using EQ 5D 5L index (respondents >12 years) or EQ 5D 3Y (respondents \u226412 years)); effect of the participants' symptoms on usual daily activities; health care resource use; out-of-pocket expenditure; and ILI state of people in the same household.\n\nParticipants and legal guardians will be telephoned on day three (+/-one day) (with day one defined as the day they were recruited into the study) to offer support with Symptom Diary completion and to check for any urgent issues. They will also be telephoned on day 14 (up to \n\nOnce the swabs have been received at local laboratories, samples will be frozen and stored at -70\u00b0C (-20\u00b0C is acceptable if there is no deep-freezer). After each flu season, samples will be transported to the Laboratory of Medical Microbiology, University of Antwerp, Belgium for analysis. Each participant's swab(s) will be analysed using a Multiplex RT-PCR for detection of pathogen genes by TaqMan\u00ae technology to identify whether or not the participant is infected with influenza A or B, with other respiratory viruses ii , or with bacteria iii .\n\nAs part of the day 28 telephone call to the participants or legal guardians or carers, questions will be asked about motivation for participating in the ALIC 4 E study, what influenced that decision, and questions related to research participation during a pandemic. All participating clinicians will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, and a sub-sample will be asked their perspectives on the trial process, their views of influenza management in primary care, and participation in pandemic research.\n\nOseltamivir has a well-documented safety profile and is a commonly used medication in a primary care setting. As a result, no non-serious adverse events will be recorded in this study.\n\nAll Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring during the 28 days participants are enrolled on the trial will be recorded. It will be left to the Investigator's clinical judgment to decide whether or not a symptom or side effect is of sufficient severity to require the participant's removal from treatment. If the participant is withdrawn due to an adverse event (AE), the investigator will arrange for follow-up visits or telephone calls until the adverse event has resolved or stabilised or until the end of their trial participation, whichever is later. If the participant is withdrawn due to an AE, follow up data will continue to be collected and their information will be included for the purpose of the intention to treat analysis. Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any prejudice to current and future health care.\n\nAn \"adaptive platform trial\" enables multiple interventions for the same indication to be tested simultaneously within a master protocol, and often includes the capacity to add, or drop, study arms while the study is in progress 32, 33 . Platform trials provide an effective framework to study patient heterogeneity in outcomes, with the goal of determining the best treatment for various subgroups of patients. In addition, platform trial designs can incorporate response adaptive randomization in order to randomize more participants to the best performing interventions during the course of the trial. This can increase statistical power and efficiency of the trial, as well as lead to better patient outcomes over the course of the study 34 .\n\nWe chose an adaptive platform trial design because it provided flexibility to evaluate additional interventions in the trial, should interventions emerge that are suitable to pragmatic evaluation in primary care. Additionally, the design provides the ability to prospectively identify particular subgroups of interest that may receive benefit from antiviral agents, as opposed to estimating a single overall effect. This is done by incorporating a Bayesian modelling approach, combined with response adaptive randomization based on pre-specified In ALIC 4 E, participants will be initially randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms, with stratification by subgroup and random blocks. Each arm will maintain at least a 10% probability of randomisation within each subgroup throughout the course of the trial. Arm superiority will be assessed by subgroup and may be declared superior in some subgroups, but not within others. If, at an interim analysis, an arm meets the superiority criterion for one of the treatments, randomization probabilities may be modified for those subgroups such that a minimum of 10% of participants are allocated to the inferior arm, with the remaining allocation to the superior arm (a maximum of 90%, if two arms). In this event, stratification and blocking will no longer occur within these subgroups. This will ensure the majority of participants receive the best-known therapy, yet the trial design will still allow the assessment of seasonal variation and population changes in the study population over time. In addition, we will still be able to collect data about costs and health related behaviours (including health care seeking) associated with a poorly performing arm.\n\nNew comparator arms may enter the trial as determined by the Trial Steering Committee.\n\nEligible therapies will include newly approved treatments for ILI or therapies recommended by public health agencies during an influenza pandemic. If an arm is added to the trial, there is a pre-specified algorithm determining randomization ratios, and for activating response adaptive randomization within subgroups to the respective treatment arms. The operating characteristics of the trial will be updated via simulation; however, the general structure of the trial does not change. Response adaptive randomization may be activated in subgroups without satisfying superiority criterion only if the number of interventions is greater than two.\n\nA sample size calculation for the planned design is not available using traditional formulas.\n\nInstead, simulations must be used to estimate the operating characteristics of the adaptive algorithm, including estimates of how many participants with particular characteristics are required in order to detect differences in treatments. In these simulations, the pre-specified algorithm will be applied such that the randomization of participants with particular prespecified characteristics will depend on the number of arms and the collected outcome data.\n\nIn addition, the algorithm will determine when arms are dropped for futility, when an Between 2500 and 4500 participants will be recruited during three consecutive winters. This range has been chosen to ensure sufficient power for comparisons in the overall population, as well as within the pre-specified subgroups. Given the nature of the study's adaptive design and the desire to ensure sufficient power for multiple hypotheses across several subgroups, the number of participants needed to be recruited is a complex multi-dimensional calculation.\n\nHence, numerous simulations were conducted to calculate power under various plausible scenarios. The maximum target of 4500 participants was chosen from these simulations because it gave over 80% power for many of the subgroup analyses with a one day benefit in terms of symptoms relief from oseltamivir. 2500 participants will provide over 99% power for comparing the primary end point in the overall study population where there is at least one day benefit of oseltamivir for participants with confirmed influenza. This number will also provide >80% power for all subgroups if there is a 2-day benefit of oseltamivir in participants with confirmed influenza. We based these simulations on the assumption that 50% of patients will have confirmed influenza and 50% of patients will have ILI originating from another viral infection.\n\nThe primary analysis will be intention to treat (ITT) and will include all randomised participants in the treatment arm they were assigned regardless of treatment taken. Secondary analyses will include the subset of the ITT population with confirmed influenza. There will be at least one interim analysis when accrual and data collection for each season is complete and before recruitment opens in the subsequent flu season. If accrual is rapid and large numbers of patients are enrolled, for example in the case of flu pandemic, more than one interim analysis may be conducted during a flu season, each occurring after approximately an additional 750 patients have been enrolled. The adaptive randomisation probabilities may be updated and arms assessed for superiority after each interim analysis.\n\nThe composite primary endpoint of return to usual activities with resolution of any fever, muscle-and headache to a minor problem or less will be modelled according to a Bayesian piece-wise exponential model. This is a survival time model that allows the baseline hazard to vary across follow-up. The hazard for reaching the primary endpoint will be modelled during four time intervals -0-2 day, 3-5 days, 6-10 days, and 11 or more days. Participants not reaching the primary endpoint by 28 days (including participants that die) will be considered censored at 28 days. Participants who withdraw, are lost to follow-up, or not evaluated for the primary endpoint for any reason will be considered censored at their last contact date or 28 days, whichever is earlier.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will compare the direct medical costs and health outcomes (in terms of number of days where ILI limits usual activities and in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years gained) between the different arms. The analysis will use data from the trial (resource use, EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3Y and VAS scores), and other relevant data from the countries in which the trial is set (e.g., unit costs, and type of health care provided within each country). Potential differences in repeated measures (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3Y and VAS) between arms will be investigated on a per-participant basis using mixed effects models.\n\nValuation of quality of life (using a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status) will be done in accordance with the guidelines of the Euroqol group 35 , using the 'EQ-5D-5L Crosswalk Index Value Calculator'.\n\nUncertainty will be explored using bootstrapping to represent clouds of Incremental Costeffectiveness Ratios (ICERs) on the cost-effectiveness plane, as well as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Subgroup analyses will be performed to acknowledge heterogeneity within each arm of the trial (e.g., age, severity, country). Value of perfect information analysis may also be performed to identify which sources of uncertainty should be reduced through additional research to efficiently improve decision making.\n\nThe ALIC 4 E Trial will be the first large-scale, international, non-industry sponsored, pragmatic, randomised trial of (cost-)effectiveness of adding oseltamivir to best usual primary care for people suffering from ILI. Another report quoting the WHO states: \"unless new information supporting the use in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks is provided, the next Expert Committee might consider oseltamivir for deletion\" 9 . The current UK and US guidelines recommend treatment of defined subgroups of frail patients and patients with increased risk for complications 6, 37 .\n\nBecause the evidence base for these recommendations is incomplete, withholding treatment from these or other patients may possibly deny them benefit. By including a 'best usual primary care' arm, our study will determine the added benefit of antiviral agents over and above current practice for seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza. This information will be of great importance to the delivery of primary care for ILI, as well as enhance the evidence base around advocating self-care. In many countries, patients with ILI symptoms are advised not to consult but to self-manage, and patients with additional risk factors are seldom routinely treated with an antiviral agent. This is largely because of an absence of evidence about the cost-effectiveness overall and in sub-groups of interest.\n\nThe virulence, spread and type of circulating influenza strains varies from season to season.\n\nALIC 4 E aims to recruit over three winter/influenza seasons in 15 countries, thereby obtaining widely applicable data allowing us to determine whether any benefit or otherwise of antiviral agents is influenced by season. Furthermore, the aim is to include a wide age-range of participants, as well as those with co-morbidities. Additionally, in the event of an influenza The adaptive design offers several advantages over a traditional study design. Recruitment into a particular arm can be stopped once a pre-determined level of certainty about the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of treatment in that arm has reached a pre-defined estimated precision. Adaptive randomisation will increase the chances of participants being allocated to arms where their information will be most useful and to the intervention that is most effective for them. This can lead to better patient care and better patient outcomes as the trial progresses. Secondly, the platform design allows new intervention arms to be added to the trial, benefiting from comparisons with existing treatment arms in a head to head way.\n\nThis flexibility extends to a potential pandemic situation where additional or alternative interventions may be added according to governmental or public health recommendations. In this way, the study will remain current and relevant to clinical practice and evolving circumstances throughout.\n\nALIC 4 E will be novel in many ways. It will provide critical information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding oseltamivir to best current ILI management in conditions that approximate usual care, both overall, as well as in important, pre-specified subgroups.\n\nALIC 4 E is likely therefore to enhance the evidence base supporting and important and common area of clinical practice.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nThis work was supported by the European Commission FP7 Programme grant number HEALTH-F3-2013-602525.

We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants \u22651 year old presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration \u226472 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed-up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, head-and muscle-ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating cost-effectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms at presentation (low, medium, high), comorbidity (yes/no), and duration of symptoms (\u226448hours/>48-72 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia); use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, and; use of over-the-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms. severity, and co-morbidities) influence outcomes.\n\n\u2022 The platform design allows the study to remain relevant to evolving circumstances, with the ability to add treatments arms.\n\n\u2022 Response adaptation allows the proportion of participants with key characteristics allocated to study arms to be altered during the course of the trial according to emerging outcome data, so that participants' information will be most useful, and increasing their chances of receiving the intervention that will be most effective for them.\n\n\u2022 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Answering these questions will reduce important clinical uncertainty for primary care clinicians about whether to prescribe antiviral agents for ILI, and whether or not to prioritise antiviral treatment for subgroups of primary care patients.\n\nThe ALIC 4 E trial will be delivered as work package (WP) 4 of the Platform for European\n\nPreparedness Against (Re-) emerging Epidemics (PREPARE: www.prepare-europe.eu/) consortium grant.

Emergency randomisation procedures will be available should this web-based facility be temporarily unavailable. Randomisation will initially be a 1:1 ratio between the two arms, with stratification by subgroup according to ECDC definitions of those at higher risk of complications from influenza, namely their age (<12, 12-64, >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium, high), any relevant comorbidity i (yes/no), and duration of symptoms since onset (\u226448hours/>48-72hours). The proportions randomised to study arms may be altered during the course of the trial following a pre-specified Bayesian, response adaptive approach 26 .

The following data points are collected daily in the diary: severity of selected ILI symptom; quality of life (EQ Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)); return to usual daily activity; prescription medication use (including antibiotics); use of OTC medication or remedies; adherence to trial medication and potential side-effects (up to day 7). The following data points will be collected weekly:\n\nquality of life (using EQ 5D 5L index (respondents >12 years) or EQ 5D 3Y (respondents \u226412 years)); effect of the participants' symptoms on usual daily activities; health care resource use; out-of-pocket expenditure; and ILI state of people in the same household.\n\nParticipants and legal guardians will be telephoned on day three (+/-one day) (with day one defined as the day they were recruited into the study) to offer support with Symptom Diary completion and to check for any urgent issues. They will also be telephoned on day 14 (up to \n\nOnce the swabs have been received at local laboratories, samples will be frozen and stored at -70\u00b0C (-20\u00b0C is acceptable if there is no deep-freezer). After each flu season, samples will be transported to the Laboratory of Medical Microbiology, University of Antwerp, Belgium for analysis. Each participant's swab(s) will be analysed using a Multiplex RT-PCR for detection of pathogen genes by TaqMan\u00ae technology to identify whether or not the participant is infected with influenza A or B, with other respiratory viruses ii , or with bacteria iii .\n\nAs part of the day 28 telephone call to the participants or legal guardians or carers, questions will be asked about motivation for participating in the ALIC 4 E study, what influenced that decision, and questions related to research participation during a pandemic. All participating clinicians will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, and a sub-sample will be asked their perspectives on the trial process, their views of influenza management in primary care, and participation in pandemic research.\n\nOseltamivir has a well-documented safety profile and is a commonly used medication in a primary care setting. As a result, no non-serious adverse events will be recorded in this study.\n\nAll Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring during the 28 days participants are enrolled on the trial will be recorded. It will be left to the Investigator's clinical judgment to decide whether or not a symptom or side effect is of sufficient severity to require the participant's removal from treatment. If the participant is withdrawn due to an adverse event (AE), the investigator will arrange for follow-up visits or telephone calls until the adverse event has resolved or stabilised or until the end of their trial participation, whichever is later. If the participant is withdrawn due to an AE, follow up data will continue to be collected and their information will be included for the purpose of the intention to treat analysis. Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any prejudice to current and future health care.\n\nAn \"adaptive platform trial\" enables multiple interventions for the same indication to be tested simultaneously within a master protocol, and often includes the capacity to add, or drop, study arms while the study is in progress 32, 33 . Platform trials provide an effective framework to study patient heterogeneity in outcomes, with the goal of determining the best treatment for various subgroups of patients. In addition, platform trial designs can incorporate response adaptive randomization in order to randomize more participants to the best performing interventions during the course of the trial. This can increase statistical power and efficiency of the trial, as well as lead to better patient outcomes over the course of the study 34 .\n\nWe chose an adaptive platform trial design because it provided flexibility to evaluate additional interventions in the trial, should interventions emerge that are suitable to pragmatic evaluation in primary care. Additionally, the design provides the ability to prospectively identify particular subgroups of interest that may receive benefit from antiviral agents, as opposed to estimating a single overall effect. This is done by incorporating a Bayesian modelling approach, combined with response adaptive randomization based on pre-specified 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 In ALIC 4 E, participants will be initially randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms, with stratification by subgroup and random blocks. Each arm will maintain at least a 10% probability of randomisation within each subgroup throughout the course of the trial. Arm superiority will be assessed by subgroup and may be declared superior in some subgroups, but not within others. If, at an interim analysis, an arm meets the superiority criterion for one of the treatments, randomization probabilities may be modified for those subgroups such that a minimum of 10% of participants are allocated to the inferior arm, with the remaining allocation to the superior arm (a maximum of 90%, if two arms). In this event, stratification and blocking will no longer occur within these subgroups. This will ensure the majority of participants receive the best-known therapy, yet the trial design will still allow the assessment of seasonal variation and population changes in the study population over time. In addition, we will still be able to collect data about costs and health related behaviours (including health care seeking) associated with a poorly performing arm.\n\nNew comparator arms may enter the trial as determined by the Trial Steering Committee.\n\nEligible therapies will include newly approved treatments for ILI or therapies recommended by public health agencies during an influenza pandemic. If an arm is added to the trial, there is a pre-specified algorithm determining randomization ratios, and for activating response adaptive randomization within subgroups to the respective treatment arms. The operating characteristics of the trial will be updated via simulation; however, the general structure of the trial does not change. Response adaptive randomization may be activated in subgroups without satisfying superiority criterion only if the number of interventions is greater than two.\n\nA sample size calculation for the planned design is not available using traditional formulas.\n\nInstead, simulations must be used to estimate the operating characteristics of the adaptive algorithm, including estimates of how many participants with particular characteristics are required in order to detect differences in treatments. In these simulations, the pre-specified algorithm will be applied such that the randomization of participants with particular prespecified characteristics will depend on the number of arms and the collected outcome data.\n\nIn addition, the algorithm will determine when arms are dropped for futility, when an 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y intervention is declared superior, and will have a process for adding a new intervention to the platform trial.\n\nBetween 2500 and 4500 participants will be recruited during three consecutive winters. This range has been chosen to ensure sufficient power for comparisons in the overall population, as well as within the pre-specified subgroups. Given the nature of the study's adaptive design and the desire to ensure sufficient power for multiple hypotheses across several subgroups, the number of participants needed to be recruited is a complex multi-dimensional calculation.\n\nHence, numerous simulations were conducted to calculate power under various plausible scenarios. The maximum target of 4500 participants was chosen from these simulations because it gave over 80% power for many of the subgroup analyses with a one day benefit in terms of symptoms relief from oseltamivir. 2500 participants will provide over 99% power for comparing the primary end point in the overall study population where there is at least one day benefit of oseltamivir for participants with confirmed influenza. This number will also provide >80% power for all subgroups if there is a 2-day benefit of oseltamivir in participants with confirmed influenza. We based these simulations on the assumption that 50% of patients will have confirmed influenza and 50% of patients will have ILI originating from another viral infection.\n\nThe primary analysis will be intention to treat (ITT) and will include all randomised participants in the treatment arm they were assigned regardless of treatment taken. Secondary analyses will include the subset of the ITT population with confirmed influenza. There will be at least one interim analysis when accrual and data collection for each season is complete and before recruitment opens in the subsequent flu season. If accrual is rapid and large numbers of patients are enrolled, for example in the case of flu pandemic, more than one interim analysis may be conducted during a flu season, each occurring after approximately an additional 750 patients have been enrolled. The adaptive randomisation probabilities may be updated and arms assessed for superiority after each interim analysis.\n\nThe composite primary endpoint of return to usual activities with resolution of any fever, muscle-and headache to a minor problem or less will be modelled according to a Bayesian piece-wise exponential model. This is a survival time model that allows the baseline hazard to vary across follow-up. The hazard for reaching the primary endpoint will be modelled 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y during four time intervals -0-2 day, 3-5 days, 6-10 days, and 11 or more days. Participants not reaching the primary endpoint by 28 days (including participants that die) will be considered censored at 28 days. Participants who withdraw, are lost to follow-up, or not evaluated for the primary endpoint for any reason will be considered censored at their last contact date or 28 days, whichever is earlier.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will compare the direct medical costs and health outcomes (in terms of number of days where ILI limits usual activities and in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years gained) between the different arms. The analysis will use data from the trial (resource use, EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3Y and VAS scores), and other relevant data from the countries in which the trial is set (e.g., unit costs, and type of health care provided within each country). Potential differences in repeated measures (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3Y and VAS) between arms will be investigated on a per-participant basis using mixed effects models.\n\nValuation of quality of life (using a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status) will be done in accordance with the guidelines of the Euroqol group 35 , using the 'EQ-5D-5L Crosswalk Index Value Calculator'.\n\nUncertainty will be explored using bootstrapping to represent clouds of Incremental Costeffectiveness Ratios (ICERs) on the cost-effectiveness plane, as well as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Subgroup analyses will be performed to acknowledge heterogeneity within each arm of the trial (e.g., age, severity, country). Value of perfect information analysis may also be performed to identify which sources of uncertainty should be reduced through additional research to efficiently improve decision making.\n\nThe ALIC 4 E Trial will be the first large-scale, international, non-industry sponsored, pragmatic, randomised trial of (cost-)effectiveness of adding oseltamivir to best usual primary care for people suffering from ILI. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Another report quoting the WHO states: \"unless new information supporting the use in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks is provided, the next Expert Committee might consider oseltamivir for deletion\" 9 . The current UK and US guidelines recommend treatment of defined subgroups of frail patients and patients with increased risk for complications 6, 37 .\n\nBecause the evidence base for these recommendations is incomplete, withholding treatment from these or other patients may possibly deny them benefit. By including a 'best usual primary care' arm, our study will determine the added benefit of antiviral agents over and above current practice for seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza. This information will be of great importance to the delivery of primary care for ILI, as well as enhance the evidence base around advocating self-care. In many countries, patients with ILI symptoms are advised not to consult but to self-manage, and patients with additional risk factors are seldom routinely treated with an antiviral agent. This is largely because of an absence of evidence about the cost-effectiveness overall and in sub-groups of interest.\n\nThe virulence, spread and type of circulating influenza strains varies from season to season.\n\nALIC 4 E aims to recruit over three winter/influenza seasons in 15 countries, thereby obtaining widely applicable data allowing us to determine whether any benefit or otherwise of antiviral agents is influenced by season. Furthermore, the aim is to include a wide age-range of participants from many different settings, as well as those with co-morbidities. Additionally, 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 This flexibility extends to a potential pandemic situation where additional or alternative interventions may be added according to governmental or public health recommendations. In this way, the study will remain current and relevant to clinical practice and evolving circumstances throughout.\n\nALIC 4 E will be novel in many ways. It will provide critical information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding oseltamivir to best current ILI management in conditions that approximate usual care, both overall, as well as in important, pre-specified subgroups.\n\nALIC 4 E is likely therefore to enhance the evidence base supporting and important and common area of clinical practice.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nThis work was supported by the European Commission FP7 Programme grant number HEALTH-F3-2013-602525. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Role of study sponsor and funders, if any, in study design; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the report for publication, including whether they will have ultimate authority over any of these activities ______n/a_____ 5d Composition, roles, and responsibilities of the coordinating centre, steering committee, endpoint adjudication committee, data management team, and other individuals or groups overseeing the trial, if applicable (see Item 21a for data monitoring committee) _______33____ Primary, secondary, and other outcomes, including the specific measurement variable (eg, systolic blood pressure), analysis metric (eg, change from baseline, final value, time to event), method of aggregation (eg, median, proportion), and time point for each outcome.
