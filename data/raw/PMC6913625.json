{"title": "Role for migratory domestic poultry and/or wild birds in the global spread of\navian influenza?", "body": "Recently, the Dutch bird migration atlas has been launched (https://vogeltrekatlas.nl) based on\nmore than 13 million ring recovery data obtained during the previous 100 years. As such it\nis a very valuable source on information regarding bird migration.\n\nWithin veterinary medicine bird migration is nowadays frequently associated with avian\ninfluenza (AI). However, AI virus strains have been circulating and diversifying in wild\nbird populations for at least the last 100 years (Lycett et al. 2019). AI viruses - in particular highly pathogenic avian influenza\n(HPAI) [or previously called \u2018fowl plague\u2019] viruses - form a continuous threat to the\npoultry industry, public health, and to some wild bird species (van den Brand et al. 2018). For instance, it has been estimated that up to\n11\u201339% of the wintering population of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus)\nin the Netherlands might have died due to HPAI A/H5N8 virus strains during autumn\u2013winter\n2016\u20132017 (Kleyheeg et al. 2017). Sporadic\ninfections of humans with a limited number of avian virus subtypes (H5, H6, H7, H9, H10)\nhave been known to occur directly from avian sources, but without as yet leading to\nsustained human to human transmission (Yuen et al. 1998, Koopmans et al. 2004, Fouchier et\nal. 2004, Shi et al. 2013, Parry 2013, Chen et\nal. 2014, Bui et al. 2017, Lycett et al. 2019).\nTypically, these infections are severe in humans, often causing death (Lycett et al. 2019) including the regrettable death of a\nveterinarian from pneumonia after infection with AI A/H7N7 virus. The 57-year-old\nveterinarian became ill within days of visiting a poultry farm hit by an AI outbreak\n(Sheldon 2003). It has been stated that direct\ntransmission of the virus from wild birds to humans appears to be very rare (or\nnon-existent), presumably due to the low frequency of contact between the two populations.\nHowever, transmission from domestic avian species to humans does occur, especially in live\nbird markets in Asia (Lycett et al. 2019).\n\nOf course, it is important not to confuse the threat posed by HPAI with that of a human flu\npandemic (Sheldon 2005). In 1918, a H1N1 strain\nof influenza A virus, the \u2018Spanish flu\u2019, caused a human pandemic resulting in the deaths of\n50 million people. Since then, three other human influenza A virus pandemics have occurred:\nH2N2 in 1957 (\u2018Asian flu\u2019), H3N2 in 1968 (\u2018Hong Kong flu\u2019), and H1N1 again in 2009 (\u2018swine\nflu\u2019)(Lycett et al. 2019). It has been suggested\nthat the human H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic viruses might have had an avian origin on the basis of\nantigenic cross-reactivity (Pereira et al. 1967).\nHowever, the subsequent two human pandemics (H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968) were not caused\nby completely avian-origin viruses, but were rather reassortant viruses with avian-origin\nHA, PB1 polymerase and (for the 1957 pandemic) NA segments (Kawaoka et al. 1989, Bean et al. 1992, Sch\u00e4fer et al. 1993, Joseph et\nal. 2015, Lycett et al. 2019). The 2009 H1N1 \u2018swine flu\u2019 pandemic was a result of\nreassortment between different strains of influenza A virus that had been circulating in\nswine for at least 10 years (Smith et al. 2009,\nLycett et al. 2019).\n\nSince the emergence of the HPAI A/H5N1 virus in poultry in China in 1996, H5 HPAI viruses\nthat share a common ancestral virus strain (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 [GsGd]) have continued to\ncause outbreaks in poultry (Duan et al. 2008).\nThe hemagglutinin (H) gene of the HPAI A/H5N1 virus diversified into multiple genetic\nlineages (\u201cclades\u201d). More recently, reassortment between the HPAI A/H5N1 virus and the low\npathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses resulted in HPAI viruses with neuraminidase (N)\ngenes (N1, N2, N5, N6, and N8) and other genes of LPAI virus origin (Zhao et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2013, Zhao et al. 2013, Wong et al.\n2015). From China, H5 GsGd virus has been\nintroduced to other Asian countries, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Within Europe,\nHPAI A/H5N1 GsGd virus has been detected in multiple countries in 2004 (clade 1),\n2005/2006/2007 (clades 2.2 and 2.2.1), and 2008/2009/2010 (clade 2.3.2)(Cattoli et al. 2009, Reid et al. 2011). In November and December of 2014, the HPAI A/H5N8 GsGd virus (clade\n2.3.4.4, group A, Buan-like)(Jeong et al. 2014)\nwas detected in various countries of Asia, Europe, and - for the first time - North America\n(van den Brand et al. 2018). HPAI A/H5N6 virus as\na novel reassortant of the H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 group B viruses (Beerens et al. 2018) was first detected at the Russia - Mongolia\nborder in May 2016 (Beerens et al. 2019).\nRemarkably, the first detection of HPAI A/H5N6 virus in the Netherlands as well as in Europe\n(Beerens et al. 2018) was on a commercial farm\nnotably keeping meat ducks no sooner than on December 7, 2017 (Beerens et al. 2019).\n\nHPAI is essentially a poultry disease (van den Brand et al. 2018). The intranasal inoculation with A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97\n(A/H5N1) influenza virus in chicken was lethal within 1.5-2 days post inoculation (Perkins\nand Swayne 2001). Conversely, in ducks the A/H5N1\nHong Kong isolates produced innocuous infection characterized by transient shedding and no\nclinical disease. This limited (subclinical) infection is typical of AI in this subfamily of\nwaterfowl (Easterday et al. 1997, Perkins and\nSwayne 2001). Vaccination in chicken has been\ncharacterized as a logistically demanding and costly method with inherent uncertainties\nunder field conditions regarding the level and duration of protection against infection\n(OIE/FAO/IZSVe Scientific Conference 2007).\nHowever, the apparent success of the H7N9 vaccination program in China suggests that it is\npossible to control virus circulation in domestic birds and thus vastly reduce the number of\nhuman infections and the risk of ongoing human to human spread (Lycett et al. 2019).\n\nAI was also studied in captive ducks of six different species, namely tufted duck\n(Aythya fuligula), Eurasian pochard (A. ferina), mallard\n(Anas platyrhynchos), common teal (A. crecca), Eurasian\nwigeon (A. penelope), and gadwall (A. strepera). Birds\nwere 8\u201311 months of age at time of inoculation and captive-bred. Prior to simultaneous\ntracheal and esophageal inoculation with HPAI A/H5N1 virus some animals had positive or\nsuspected positive antinucleoprotein antibody titres. Inoculation with the 2005 (A/H5N1)\nvirus caused clinical signs at 3\u20134 days following inoculation in both diving duck species,\nwhich were more severe in tufted ducks than in Eurasian pochards. Viral excretion was\nhighest in Eurasian pochards and mallards. Severely affected birds died or were euthanized\nin a moribund state at 4 days post inoculation (Keawcharoen et al. 2008). A similar study was performed in captive ducks of the species\nEurasian wigeon (Figures 1 and 2), common teal, mallard, and Eurasian pochard. The birds were\napproximately one year of age and also captive-bred. Prior to simultaneous tracheal and\nesophageal inoculation with HPAI A/H5N8 virus some animals were RT-PCR positive for the\nmatrix gene of influenza A virus. Inoculation with the 2014 (A/H5N8) virus was subclinical\nin all 4 duck species and virus excretion was highest in Eurasian wigeons (van den Brand et\nal. 2018). While the HPAI Asian A/H5N1 viruses\nare 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in\nsome duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the \u201cTrojan horses\u201d of A/H5N1 in\ntheir surreptitious spread of virus (Kim et al\n2009). The captive ducks in both inoculation\nstudies were obtained from two different breeders. The presence of some captive-bred birds\nwith either (suspected) positive antinucleoprotein antibody titres or RT-PCR positivity for\nthe matrix gene of influenza A virus might illustrate this concept.\n\nFortunately, influenza viruses - including AI - do not result in persistent viral\ninfection. For instance, HPAI A/H5N1 virus does not persist in individual domestic ducks\nafter acute infection (Wibawa et al. 2014). In\nline, it has been shown that the 2014 HPAI A/H5N8 virus has not continued to circulate\nextensively in wild bird populations since the winter 2014\u20132015 in the Netherlands and that\nindependent maintenance of the virus in these populations appears unlikely (Poen et al.\n2018). Of note, there were no significant\ndifferences between chicken and ducks in the duration of HPAI virus shedding\nvia both respiratory [2.6 (1.1\u20136.5) versus 6.9 (2.8\u201317.1) days] or cloaca\nroutes [2.5 (1.0\u20136.2) and 6.6 (2.7\u201316.3) days] (Germeraad et al. 2019).\n\nThe long-distance spread of HPAI H5 GsGd virus from Asia to other continents is thought to\noccur via migratory birds or poultry trade (van den Brand et al. 2018). Recently, a consortium advocated a role for\nmigratory wild birds in the global spread of AI A/H5N8 virus (the Global Consortium for H5N8\nand related influenza viruses 2016). The goal of\ntheir study was to analyze the available genetic, epidemiological, and ornithological data\nfor evidence of the relative contributions from poultry trade and from wild bird movements\nfor the global spread of HPAI A/H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 virus during 2014\u20132015. In order to\naddress the contribution of poultry trade, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations (FAO) for 2011 to 2013 only on export and import of live domestic\nducks and chickens of affected countries were reviewed to estimate the risk of spread of\nHPAI virus. The publication goes along with a table showing data on the import and export of\nlive poultry in those affected countries without indicating the countries of destination of\nthe exported live animals. South Korea reported the official export of about 3000 live\nchickens in 2013, whereas China exported more than 3 million live chicken in 2013 without\nany official export of live ducks over the years 2011-2013. Although the consortium\nconsidered that unreported cross-border trade cannot be excluded they concluded - based on\nthis table only - that it seems unlikely that international trade in live poultry played a\nmajor role in the long-distance spread of South Korean clade HPAI A/H5N8 virus in 2014\u20132015\nwhich seems somewhat narrow based and not fully in perspective. In contrast, it has been\nreported, for example, that chickens transported 1500 km from Lanzhou, Gansu Province,\nChina, apparently introduced H5N1 to Lhasa, Tibet, in January 2004 (FAO 2004, Melville and Shortridge 2004, Greger 2006).\nFurthermore, every day, millions of live poultry are moved around the world by ground, air\nand sea transport, which potentially could carry for instance H5N1 to fresh areas (Butler\nand Ruttiman 2006). In line, during October and\nNovember 2005, customs inspectors at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) at a port in\nCalifornia intercepted nearly 75 tonnes of poultry smuggled in from Asia (Butler and\nRuttiman 2006). Also, the first outbreak of H5N1\nin Africa - in Nigeria - was widely attributed to migratory birds. But many now see the\nimports of day-old chicks as a more plausible cause (Butler and Ruttiman 2006, Greger 2006). Last but not least, remarkably a H5N1 influenza A virus was isolated from\nduck breast meat processed for human consumption imported to Japan from Shandong Province,\nChina in 2003. Of note, this duck meat isolate was highly pathogenic to chickens upon\nintravenous or intranasal inoculation, replicated well in the lungs of mice and spread to\nthe brain, but was not as pathogenic in mice as H5N1 human isolates (Mase et al. 2005).\n\nMigratory birds like the Eurasian wigeon have a distinct flyway (Figure 3), which is by far less bizarre than flyways of poultry meat\nand meat products (including live birds) as illustrated in the paper by Ventura da Silva\n(2013). Despite wild bird migration HPAI virus\n- for the first time \u2013 managed in the end to reach North America as A/H5N8 (van den Brand et\nal. 2018). Of note, HPAI A/H5N6 virus was not\ndetected in wild birds after March 2018, but in August 2018 infected wild birds were found\nagain in the Netherlands (Beerens et al. 2019).\nThese observations seem to be in line with the statement that the geographic spread of the\ndisease does not correlate with migratory routes and seasons, but that the pattern of\noutbreaks follows major road and rail routes, not flyways (Editorial 2006). In accord, it has been stated that migratory geese are exposed\nto the virus after their arrival on wintering grounds, indicating that migratory geese might\nnot disperse low pathogenic avian influenza virus during autumn migration (Yin et al. 2017).\n\nWintering in the Netherlands is increasingly popular among wild birds (Figure 4) like the Eurasian wigeon as an average 665,200 birds over the\nyears 2013\u20132017 prefer to stay there in winter time (Hornman and van Winden 2018). Due to additional migration of other wild duck\nspecies over the years 2013\u20132017 on the average more than 1.5 million wild ducks in total\nwinter in the Netherlands (Figure 4 ducks in yellow\nbars). These birds add to the around 100 million chickens and about 0.9 million domestic\nducks also living in the Netherlands (van der Peet et al. 2018). Last but not least, the migration of live domestic ducks into\nthe Netherlands in 2013 counted 3.7 million birds whereas outward migration of live domestic\nducks counted 1.2 million birds (the Global Consortium for H5N8 and related influenza\nviruses 2016). As such the migration of domestic\nducks into the Netherlands by far outnumbers the migration of wild ducks into the\nNetherlands. It is likely that the ongoing passive wild bird surveillance programme in the\nNetherlands (Beerens et al. 2019) is by-passed by\nthese domestic ducks. Of note, an ongoing AI surveillance programme monitors farms keeping\nmeat ducks and broiler chicken once yearly via serology.\n\nIn modern industrial poultry farms without a free-range system, close contact with wild\nbirds is unlikely and strict biosecurity measures are in place to reduce most indirect\ntransmission routes. It was therefore remarkable that outbreaks of HPAI A/H5N8 in Germany,\nthe Netherlands and the United Kingdom in 2014\u20132015 occurred on modern farms with indoor\npoultry housing and that no outdoor production sites were affected (European Food Safety\nAuthority (EFSA) 2014, Velkers et al. 2017).\n\nIn the six months before the first detection on 14 November 2014 of HPAI A/H5N8 in poultry\nin the Netherlands, a total of 2,745 wild birds belonging to the orders Anseriformes and\nCharadriiformes had been sampled for HPAI H5 virus during the wild bird surveillance\nprogramme compared to 3,698 birds in the three months afterwards. Remarkably, in the six\nmonths before the first detection of HPAI A/H5N8 in poultry sampling was always negative,\nwhereas sampling for virus revealed two European wigeons (out of 1,185) positive for HPAI\nafter the first detection of HPAI H5N8 (Verhagen et al. 2015). Similarly, first detection in\nthe Netherlands of HPAI A/H5N6 was on a commercial farm with meat ducks on 7 December, 2017,\nwhereas the virus was first detected in wild birds [mute swan (Cygnus\nolor)] on 9 December 2017 (Beerens et al. 2019). The most likely conclusion based on these two studies seems that the\noutbreak in poultry preceded the outbreak in wild birds.\n\nA similar high pathogenicity was measured for H5N6 and H5N8 group B viruses in 6-week-old\ndomestic Pekin ducks. After intravenous inoculation with the H5N6 virus from 2017 all 10\nducks died on the first day, whereas regarding the H5N8 2016 virus, nine ducks died on day\n1, and one duck on day 2 (Beerens et al. 2019).\nGiven the very high pathogenicity shown for these H5N6 and H5N8 viruses it cannot be\nexcluded that the outbreak in wild birds in the previous paragraph refers to an inevitable\nside-effect of the culling process as there are no known natural reservoirs of HPAI (Swayne\nand Suarez 2000). On the other hand, such high\nlevels of pathogenicity in wild birds might severely limit their role in the movement of\nvirus (Melville and Shortridge 2004).\nFurthermore, wild birds infected with HPAI A/H5N6 virus related to the first outbreak in\npoultry were found at short distances from the farm, within a short time frame, whereas no\nwild bird viruses related to outbreaks 2 and 3 were detected in winter 2017\u20132018 (Beerens et\nal. 2019). In winter 2016\u20132017, HPAI A/H5N8 virus\namplification primarily took place within the Netherlands resulting in associated die-offs\nof at least 57 wild birds belonging to 12 species (Poen et al. 2018).\n\nExperts think human influenza started about 4,500 years ago with the domestication of\nwaterfowl like ducks, the original source of all influenza viruses. Farmers moved ducks from\nthe rivers and tributaries onto flooded rice fields to be used as an adjunct to rice\nfarming. This led to a permanent year-round gene pool of avian influenza viruses in East\nAsia in close proximity to humans (Shortridge 2003, Greger 2006) or in other words\nthis region \"represents the most incredible reassortment laboratory for influenza viruses\nthat anyone could ever imagine\" (Das 2002, Greger\n2006). The domestic duck of southern China is\nnow considered the principal host of all influenza viruses with pandemic potential\n(Shortridge 1992, Greger 2006). As mentioned before, because HPAI does not necessarily kill\nits anseriform hosts, reassortment with co-circulating LPAI viruses can occur, furthering\nevolution of the virus (Lycett et al. 2019).\nMedian\u2010joining network analysis was performed based on the genomes of HPAI A/H5N6 viruses\nisolated from three commercial poultry farms (comprising two duck and one chicken farm) in\nthe winter 2017-2018 revealing several amino acid changes (Beerens et al. 2019). However, when using this technique under field\nconditions over a period of more than 90 days it seems prudent to consider the species\ninvolved as well as the maximal life-span of about 7 weeks regarding meat ducks and broiler\nchicken as the process of viral reassortment might be more typical for ducks than\nchicken.\n\nRegarding the role for migratory domestic poultry and/or wild birds in the global spread of\navian influenza the impact of domestic poultry seems still most important. Furthermore, the\nrisk has been highlighted of the live bird trade which could be one of the possible routes\nfor the introduction and dissemination of both LPAIV and HPAIV throughout the world (Lee et\nal. 2019). Far more likely to be perpetuating the\nspread of the virus is the movement of poultry, poultry products, or infected material from\npoultry farms - e.g. animal feed and manure (Editorial 2006). Contaminated food and water, animal/insect vectors and air can play a role\nin the secondary spread of AI virus within and between poultry flocks, but movement of man\nand fomites is considered most relevant for spread between farms (Alexander 2007, Velkers et al. 2017). In line, it has been suggested that between-farm transmission\ncontributes considerably to the incidence of LPAI virus infections in poultry (Bergervoet et\nal. 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, previous editorials entitled \u2018Influenza: time to come to grips with the\navian dimension\u2019 (Melville and Shortridge 2004)\nand \u2018Avian influenza goes global, but don't blame the birds\u2019 (Editorial 2006) still hold. Hence increasing biosecurity and\nvaccination in domestic poultry are likely to be important strategies to keep outbreaks in\nthese populations to a minimum (Lycett et al. 2019). With reference to vaccination in domestic poultry domestic ducks seem to be\nof utmost importance."}
