However, it is currently unknown how many of these RNAs are functional. In a few well-studied cases, such as AIR, XIST, and HOTAIR, lncRNAs have been shown to operate at the transcriptional level by binding to proteins in histone-modifying complexes and targeting them to particular genes (Chu et al., 2011; Jeon and Lee, 2011; Nagano et al., 2008; Wang and Chang, 2011) . A role for lncRNAs in mammalian susceptibility to infection or the immune response to pathogens has not been previously described.\n\nNeST, formally known as Tmevpg1, is an lncRNA gene located adjacent to the interferon (IFN)-g-encoding gene in both mice (Ifng) and humans (IFNG) . NeST was originally identified as a candidate gene in a susceptibility locus for Theiler's virus (NeST stands for nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler's [cleanup Salmonella not Theiler's]). In both mouse and human genomes, NeST RNA is encoded on the DNA strand opposite to that coding for IFN-g, and the two genes are transcribed convergently (Figure 1A) . In the mouse, NeST RNA contains six exons spread over a 45 kb region (Vigneau et al., 2001 (Vigneau et al., , 2003 . The most abundant splice variant is 914 nt long, is expressed in CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and natural killer cells, and contains no AUG codons in translational contexts that appear functional. The orientation and location of human NEST are conserved, but the primary transcript encompasses the opposite strand of the entire IFNG gene ( Figure 1A ).\n\nTheiler's virus, a picornavirus, is a natural pathogen of mice. The ability of inbred mice to clear Theiler's infection varies greatly from strain to strain, and, because the phenotype can be conferred by bone marrow transfer (Aubagnac et al., 2002; Brahic et al., 2005; Vigneau et al., 2003) , is likely to result from different immune responses to the pathogen. A major effect is conferred by the H2 locus. Two additional loci that affect Theiler's virus clearance were mapped by crosses between H2 s -bearing SJL/J and B10.S mice. Whereas B10.S mice can clear the virus, SJL/J mice become persistently infected and develop demyelinating lesions similar to those observed in human multiple sclerosis (Aubagnac et al., 2002; Bureau et al., 1993) .\n\nOne of these loci, Tmevp3 (Theiler's murine encephalitis virus persistence 3; Figure 1B) , was mapped to a 550 kb interval on murine chromosome 10 (Levillayer et al., 2007) . Congenic mouse lines were developed by crossing SJL/J to B10.S and backcrossing to each parental line for 10 to 12 generations (Bihl et al., 1999; Bureau et al., 1993; Levillayer et al., 2007) . The B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J line is congenic with B10.S but contains the Tmevp3 locus from SJL/J and is unable to clear persistent infections. Conversely, the SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S line is congenic with SJL/J but contains the Tmevp3 locus from B10.S and successfully clears infections. Analysis of SNPs in the smallest introgressed B10.S-derived region revealed a small number of polymorphic genes, including those that encode Mdm1 (Chang et al., 2008) , the potent immune cytokines IL-22 and IFN-g, and the lncRNA ( Figure 1C ).\n\nHere, we show additional phenotypes associated with the Tmevp3 locus. In addition to the failure to clear Theiler's virus, the SJL/J-derived alleles also confer both resistance to lethal infection with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and inducible synthesis of IFN-g in CD8 + T cells. We show that NeST lncRNA is sufficient to confer these disparate phenotypes, demonstrating its crucial role in the host response to pathogens and illustrating an integral function for lncRNAs in immune regulation and susceptibility to infectious disease.\n\nTo refine the borders of the Tmevp3 locus, we utilized the JAX mouse diversity genotyping array, which employs 623,124 SNPs and 916,269 invariant genomic probes. We also sequenced complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding interleukin-22 (IL-22), IFN-g, and NeST RNA from SJL/J and B10.S mice, and added these findings to microarray results from the (A) Schematic of the NeST-encoding genes in mouse chromosome 10 and human chromosome 12. The bars represent exons, and arrows indicate the direction of transcription. NeST (previously termed Tmevpg1) is adjacent to both murine Ifng and human IFNG (Vigneau et al., 2003) . The major transcript, shown in red, encodes six exons. In both mice and humans, the NeST and IFNg-encoding transcripts are convergently synthesized; in humans, the transcribed regions overlap. (B) Diagram of the Tmevp3 locus on murine chromosome 10, as defined by the differential ability to clear persistent infection by Theiler's virus observed between SJL/J and B10.S mice. The SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S line (previously termed C2; Vigneau et al., 2003) is congenic with SJL/J except for the region shown, from microsatellite marker D10Mit74 to the interval between D10Mit180 and D10Mit233. The B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J strain is congenic with B10.S except for the region shown, between the D10Mit151/D10Mit271 interval and the D10Mit233/D10Mit73 interval. The Theiler's virus (TMEV) persistence and clearance phenotypes and Nramp1 alleles for all four strains are listed. (C) Finer mapping of the polymorphic regions of the congenic lines. The x axis indicates the nucleotide number on mouse chromosome 10 (NCBI37/mm9). The introgressed region of SJL/J in B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J is up to 1.6 3 10 7 bp (top), whereas the introgression in SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S is approximately 5.5 3 10 5 bp (middle and bottom). Each bar displays the number of SNPs in the window size indicated. The most polymorphic region maps to the Tmevp3 locus and coincides with the region of introgression in SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S ; see Table S1 for lists of all genetic differences between the two Tmepv3 alleles. The physical locations and direction of transcription of the murine NeST, Ifng, Il22, and Mdm1 genes are indicated by arrows. (D) NeST RNA expression in CD3 + T cells. The abundance of NeST RNA in CD3 + splenocytes from B10.S mice and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J was determined by preparing total cellular RNA and determining the amount of RNA per cell using qRT-PCR and standard curves of transcribed RNAs. The threshold of detection was 0.005 molecules of NeST RNA per cell. Mean values are shown with SE. Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME; Figure 1C ) and the list of known polymorphisms in the locus (Table S1 available online). Our results corroborated the presence of a unique introgressed region that contained the previously mapped Tmevp3 locus, and allowed us to refine its boundaries. The maximum sizes of the introgressed regions were 16 3 10 6 bp and 550 3 10 3 bp, respectively, for the B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J and SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S congenic lines ( Figure 1C ).\n\nThese analyses identified Il22, Ifng, and NeST as the most likely candidates for the gene or genes responsible for the Tmevp3 locus phenotypes by virtue of their polymorphic character and their known expression patterns. In Figure 1C , the top and middle bar graphs represent the number of SNPs in a series of nonoverlapping 50 kb window regions. The regions of densest polymorphism between the congenic and parental lines can be seen in more detail in the bottom part of Figure 1C . The product of Mdm1 is expressed predominantly in the retina (Chang et al., 2008) , making it an unlikely candidate. The three most polymorphic genes are Ifng, NeST, and Il22. The polymorphisms corresponding to NeST are shown in red and all polymorphisms in the locus are listed in Table S1 . We were especially interested in the lncRNA because of its potential novelty. As shown in Figure 1D , CD3 + T cells from B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice displayed significantly higher amounts of NeST RNA than did those from B10.S mice. This result differs from that reported by Vigneau et al. (2003) , possibly due to differences in the T cell preparations used or the use of saturating RT-PCR methods in the previous study. Here, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), the use of standard curves, and comparisons of RNA abundances from identical numbers of cells showed repeatedly that splenocytes from mice with an SJL/J-derived Tmevp3 allele accumulated substantially more NeST RNA than those from mice with a B10.S-derived Tmevp3 allele. Even so, the amount of NeST RNA that accumulated in total CD3 + T cells was, on average, only 0.15 molecules per cell ( Figure 1D ). It is known that many lncRNAs are present at similarly low amounts but still are sufficient to cause epigenetic changes that are then selfpropagating (reviewed in Guttman and Rinn, 2012) . It is also possible that NeST RNA is more abundant in a subset of the CD3 + T cells. Indeed, a higher abundance of NeST RNA was observed in CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3B ) than in total CD3 + T cells ( Figure 1D ).\n\nTo determine whether Tmevp3 polymorphisms affected the outcome of another infection, we monitored their effects on the pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, a pathogen that, like Theiler's virus, grows in macrophages (Monack et al., 2004; Rossi et al., 1997) and is extremely sensitive to IFN-g and CD8 + T cell control (Foster et al., 2005; Rodriguez et al., 2003) . We began by comparing SJL/J and SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S mice because the size of the introgressed region was smaller in this pair than in the B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J pair (Figure 1B) . Both SJL/J mice and SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S mice are homozygous for the functional allele of Nramp1, which encodes an ion channel that facilitates clearance of Salmonella (Frehel et al., 2002) . As expected, both strains were resistant to oral inoculation ( Figure 2A ). However, when subjected to the morepotent intraperitoneal inoculation, both groups were susceptible but the SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S mice showed significantly more mortality ( Figure 2B ).\n\nB10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice carry the Nramp1 169Asp/169Asp loss-of-function allele, which increases their susceptibility to Salmonella infection. When inoculated orally, B10.S mice displayed significantly more mortality than B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice at several infectious dosages (Figure 2C) . Intraperitoneal inoculation was rapidly lethal for both mouse strains ( Figure 2D ). The differences in phenotypes between SJL/J and SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S and also between B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice strengthen the hypothesis that the Tmevp3 polymorphisms initially discovered by analysis of Theiler's virus persistence have implications for general immune function. In subsequent experiments, we focused on B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice and Salmonella pathogenesis, given that oral infection is the natural route.\n\nTo determine whether the differences in phenotype resulted from different bacterial loads, we infected B10.S and B10.S. Tmevp3 SJL/J mice and monitored the abundance of S. Typhimurium in spleen and feces. B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice were orally inoculated with 10 6 CFU and spleens were dissected 4, 9, and 14 days after inoculation. No significant differences in bacterial loads were observed in either spleen or feces at any time point ( Figure 2E ). Interestingly, by day 14, both the B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice had nearly resolved their infections even though mice from both groups continued to die. To test for differences in Salmonella growth in cultured macrophages, we infected bone-marrow-derived primary macrophages from B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J and measured the amounts of intracellular Salmonella at various times after infection. No significant differences in bacterial growth within cells were observed ( Figure 2F ). All of these data are consistent with the hypothesis that lethality is not due to the bacterial load per se, but rather to the inflammatory response to bacterial infection (Miao and Rajan, 2011; Pereira et al., 2011; Strowig et al., 2012) . In fact, the SJL/J-derived Tmevp3 locus also conferred increased resistance to the lethal inflammatory disease caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection ( Figure S1 ).\n\nWe hypothesized that NeST RNA could play a causal role in the phenotypes conferred by the Tmevp3 locus. To address this issue, we developed B10.S transgenic mice that express either SJL/J-or B10.S-derived NeST RNA under the control of a promoter that directs constitutive expression in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3A ; Sawada et al., 1994) . We obtained two transgenic mouse lines: B10.S.NeST B10.S and B10.S. NeST SJL/J . To test whether the transgenes had inserted near the endogenous Tmevp3 locus, we performed genetic crosses between the B10.S.NeST B10.S and the B10.S.NeST SJL/J transgenic mice and mice that bore neither marker. For both transgenic lines, the NeST transgenes and the endogenous locus showed no evidence of linkage (data not shown). Both transgenic NeST RNAs were expressed in CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3B ), although at different amounts. The B10.S NeST transgene was expressed to an abundance similar to that of the endogenous NeST gene in the B10S.Tmevp3 SJL/J line, whereas the SJL/ J-derived transgene accumulated to much greater abundance ( Figure 3B ).\n\nTo test whether the transgenic RNAs conferred protection against Salmonella pathogenesis, we inoculated B10.S mice, B10.S mice congenic at the Tmevp3 locus, and B10.S mice transgenic for each NeST allele orally with Salmonella. Mice that expressed the NeST B10.S transgene completely recapitulated the Tmevp3 SJl/J survival phenotype ( Figure 3C ). Mice that expressed the SJL/J NeST transgene also showed protection. These findings demonstrate that NeST RNA can function in trans to reduce Salmonella pathogenesis.\n\nTo test the role of NeST RNA in Theiler's virus infection, the microbial susceptibility phenotype that led to its discovery, we inoculated B10.S, B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J , and B10.S.NeST B10.S transgenic mice by intracranial injection. Viral loads in the spinal cord were determined seven and 67 days after inoculation. At seven days, all strains displayed comparable viral titers (Figure 4A) , suggesting that NeST RNA plays little role during the acute phase of infection. However, 67 days after inoculation, infectious virus could only be recovered from mice that carried the NeST transgene or the B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J locus ( Figure 4B ). The amounts of viral RNA in the spinal cords of the transgenic mice and the B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice were orders of magnitude (C and D) Strains B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J were also inoculated via oral (C) and intraperitoneal (D) routes with S. enterica Typhimurium at the dosages indicated and mortality was monitored. The Nramp1 169Asp/169Asp alleles render these mice highly sensitive to Salmonella pathogenesis. In both backgrounds, the SJL/J allele of the Tmevp3 locus reduced mortality after oral inoculation. Statistical significance was determined by the log rank test. (E) B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J were orally inoculated with S. Typhimurium at 10 6 CFU/mouse. Bacteria were monitored in spleen and feces at the indicated days. (F) Intracellular bacterial growth was monitored ex vivo in bone-marrow-derived macrophages from B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice. Lines represent the mean of triplicate experiments, and statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. See also Figure S1 . higher than those found in the spinal cords of the nontransgenic B10.S parent ( Figure 4C ). Thus, the susceptibility to Theiler's virus persistence in spinal cord associated with the Tmevp3 SJL/J allele was recapitulated by the expression of the NeST RNA transgene.\n\nEffect of the Tmevp3 Locus on the Expression of IFN-g by CD8 + T Cells Several enhancer-like lncRNAs are known to activate neighboring genes, as exemplified by HOTTIP and Jpx (\u00d8rom et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2010; . The physical proximity of Il22 and Ifng to NeST inspired us to test for differences in expression of these two genes in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice. Isolated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were cultured for 1 day, stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, and monitored for both cytokine secretion (Figures 5A and 5B ) and intracellular RNA abundance ( Figure S2 ). In CD4 + T cells, ex vivo stimulation caused large but similar increases in the secretion of both cytokines in both B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice ( Figure 5A) . Similarly, the Tmevp3 allele did not significantly affect the amounts of IL-22 secreted from CD8 + T cells. However, whereas the amount of IFN-g secreted from CD8 + T cells derived from B10.S mice was barely detectible, IFN-g secretion from B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice was robust after stimulation ( Figure 5B ). The difference in IFN-g production by CD8 + T cells coincided with the amounts of IFN-g RNA and NeST RNA ( Figure S2B) . These results show a strong correlation between the abundance of NeST RNA and IFN-g RNA and the amount of IFN-g protein in activated CD8 + T cells.\n\nTo determine whether the expression of NeST RNA alone could elicit the observed changes in IFN-g expression in CD8 + T cells, we monitored the abundance of the cytokine in CD8 + T cells from B10.S, B10.S.NeST SJL/J , and B10.S.NeST B10.S mice. As before, CD8 + T cells from the parental B10.S mice accumulated very little cytokine after ex vivo stimulation ( Figure 5C ). However, the transgenic expression of either the B10.S or the SJL/J allele of NeST conferred the ability to induce IFN-g secretion. Interestingly, the SJL/J-derived NeST RNA was less effective than the B10.S-derived RNA in mediating IFN-g production, but both alleles caused statistically significant increases in IFN-g expression upon CD8 + T cell activation. Subsequent experiments were designed to investigate the mechanism of these effects. (C) B10.S, B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J , B10.S.NeST SJL/J , and B10.S.NeST B10.S mice were orally inoculated with S. Typhimurium at the dosages indicated and mortality was monitored. All experiments with the 10 7 CFU/mouse were performed at the same time; the B10.S control is shown in these panels for clarity. Statistical significance was determined by the log rank test. See also Figure S1 .\n\nWe hypothesized that, like several lncRNAs, NeST RNA affects IFN-g accumulation at the transcriptional level by interacting with chromatin modification complexes. Consistent with this idea, most of the NeST RNA in either congenic or transgenic mice was found in the nuclear fraction of CD8 + T cells, cofractionating with unspliced (but not with spliced) actin mRNA ( Figure 6A ).\n\nThe finding that two different transgenic NeST RNAs that were not genetically linked to the Ifng locus conferred the properties of the Tmevp3 SJL/J locus to B10.S mice (Figures 3, 4 , and 5) argues that this lncRNA can function in trans. To determine whether NeST RNA can indeed function in trans from its normal position of synthesis, we took advantage of the fact that NeST RNA is expressed in stimulated CD8 + T cells of B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice but not in CD8 + T cells of B10.S mice ( Figure 3B and S2B). We developed a PCR assay to distinguish between the SJL/J-and B10.S-derived IFN-g alleles ( Figure 6B ). CD8 + T cells from two heterozygous B10.S/B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J mice were stimulated, RNA was extracted, and the allele from which the RNA was transcribed was determined from the RT-PCR shown in Figure 6B . Approximately equal amounts of IFN-g mRNA from the B10.S and SJL/J alleles accumulated following stimulation ( Figure 6C ), arguing that the single functional NeST gene in the heterozygous mice could stimulate transcription from the Ifng genes on both chromosomes.\n\nNeST RNA Binds to a Subunit of the MLL/SET1 H3K4 Methylase Complex and Increases Chromatin Modification at the Ifng Locus If NeST RNA were to have a direct effect on the expression of IFN-g, via chromatin modification, it should be an activating effect. Recently, a new class of enhancer-like lncRNAs was discovered (\u00d8rom et al., 2010; . Among these, HOTTIP lncRNA was found to bind WDR5 protein to recruit complexes that facilitate transcription . WDR5 is a core subunit of MLL1-4 and SET1A/1B complexes, which catalyze the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, a mark of active gene expression. To test whether NeST RNA physically interacts with WDR5, the epitope-tagged protein was coexpressed in combination with a variety of RNAs via transient transfection of 293T cells ( Figure 7A ). Extracts were then prepared and WDR5 protein was immunoprecipitated and tested for associated RNAs by qRT-PCR. HOTTIP served as a positive control, and both HOTAIR lncRNA and U1 nuclear RNA served as negative controls. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of WDR5 specifically retrieved both NeST RNAs and HOTTIP, but not U1 or HOTAIR RNAs (Figures 7A and 7B ). The physical interaction between NeST and WDR5 raises the intriguing possibility that NeST may control H3K4 methylation at the Ifng locus.\n\nTo examine the contribution of NeST RNA to IFN-g production during immune challenge, we used a well-characterized mouse model of sepsis: intraperitoneal injection of LPS. B10.S mice as well as B10.S.NeST B10.S and B10.S.NeST SJL/J transgenic mice were injected with LPS. By 6 hr postinjection, the presence of either transgenic NeST allele increased the amount of IFN-g in splenic tissue compared with the B10.S control ( Figure 7B ). An increase in H3K4me3 occupancy at the Ifng locus preceded this increased IFN-g synthesis by 2 hr ( Figure 7B ). Transgenic mice with the SJL/J-derived allele, which accumulate much more NeST RNA than those that express the B10.S allele (Figure 3B) , showed a larger amount of IFN-g-encoding DNA with H3K4me3 modifications ( Figure 7B ). Thus, increased NeST RNA abundance can result in more extensive H3K4me3 modification. Still, NeST RNA is extremely potent even at low abundance, either because the epigenetic effects persist in its absence or because activation of only a subset of cells is necessary for the observed phenotypes.\n\nThe high occupancy of H3K4me3 at the Ifng locus in the B10.S.NeST SJL/J transgenic mice allowed us to measure chromatin modification in isolated primary CD8 + cells in the presence and absence of NeST RNA. Following activation of B10.S-and B10.S.NeST SJL/J -derived CD8 + T cells, we found that the presence of NeST SJL/J RNA caused an increase in H3K4me3 at the Ifng locus ( Figure 7C ). The NeST RNA-dependent increase in H3K4me3 activation in both total splenic cells and CD8 + T cells strongly suggests that, via binding to WDR5, NeST RNA is required to program an active chromatin state that confers inducibility to the Ifng gene.\n\nIn this work, we performed a genetic analysis of an lncRNA expressed in T cells. Mice that express NeST RNA, either in its natural chromosomal environment or by transgenic delivery, displayed increased resistance to Salmonella-induced pathogenesis but increased susceptibility to Theiler's virus persistence. These disparate effects illustrate the role of balanced polymorphisms in susceptibility to infectious disease (Dean et al., 2002; Liu et al., 1996; Williams et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2010; Cagliani et al., 2011) . Genes of the immune system are under purifying selection by challenges from a plethora of pathogens, and mutations that protect against one microbe may increase susceptibility to another. In the case of autoimmunity, the rs2076530-G allele of BTNL2, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II-linked gene, confers increased susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes but decreased susceptibility to multiple sclerosis and autoimmune thyroiditis (Orozco et al., 2005; Sirota et al., 2009; Valentonyte et al., 2005) .\n\nA potential explanation for the disparate effects of NeST RNA on Theiler's virus persistence and Salmonella pathogenesis is that it alters the magnitude or timing of inflammatory responses. CD8 + T cell populations are extremely heterogeneous (Davila et al., 2005; Joosten et al., 2007; Xystrakis et al., 2004) ; for example, the CD8 + T reg population is important in resolving inflammation and preventing autoimmunity (Frisullo et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2009; Trandem et al., 2011) . Alternatively, NeST-dependent activation of basal inflammation could serve to attenuate subsequent inflammatory events. Finally, NeST RNA may have targets in addition to the Ifng gene that contribute to its apparently anti-inflammatory effect ( Figure S2 ).\n\nThe fact that the effects of NeST can be conferred by transgenic expression from ectopic loci, and to Ifng alleles on both chromosomes when NeST is expressed heterozygously, argues that NeST function, even on the adjacent IFN-g-encoding locus, can be provided in trans. Although many lncRNAs, such as Xist and HOTTIP, exert their function on neighboring genes exclusively in cis, trans-acting lncRNA function has precedent in HOTAIR, linc-p21, and Jpx lncRNAs (reviewed in Guttman and Rinn, 2012) . Notably, Jpx is required to activate the expression of the adjacent Xist gene on the presumptive inactive X chromosome, and this activation can occur whether Jpx RNA is supplied in cis or trans (Tian et al., 2010) . Thus, there is increasing recognition in the field that lncRNA regulation of nearby genes can occur by trans-acting mechanisms. The increased demands made on these lncRNAs for target specificity are currently under investigation.\n\nIn the vicinity of the Ifng locus, many of the distal regulatory elements map to regions now known to encode NeST (Sekimata et al., 2009) . For example, acetylation of histone 4 (H4Ac), a mark of active transcription, has been observed in discrete regions surrounding Ifng in activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. One peak in particular, which correlates well with the differentiation of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (Chang and Aune, 2005; Zhou et al., 2004) , is located 59 kb downstream of Ifng and coincides with the sixth exon of NeST (Figure 1 ). Another noteworthy region that is critical for IFN-g expression in CD4 + T cells maps 66 kb downstream of murine Ifng and, in humans, 166 kb downstream of IFNG. This regulatory element is also located in the NeST gene. It contains a lineage-specific DNase I hypersensitive site found in Th1 but not Th2 CD4 + T cells (Balasubramani et al., 2010) . During lineage-specific induction of IFN-g, the proteins CTCF, T-bet, and cohesin all localize to these sequences. Indeed, a recent study (Collier et al., 2012) related the expression of NeST RNA (Tmevpg1) to the expression of IFN-g in CD4 + T cells by a mechanism that depends on the simultaneous expression of T-bet. Simultaneous binding of cohesin, T-bet, and CTCF results in a complex three-dimensional conformation that is predicted to bring the NeST and IFN-g coding regions into direct proximity (Hadjur et al., 2009; Ong and Corces, 2011; Sekimata et al., 2009) .\n\nHumans express an RNA species homologous to NeST that also appears to be noncoding and is transcribed adjacent to the IFNG locus from the opposite DNA strand. Interestingly, polymorphisms that correlate with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis have been found in the DNA sequence that encodes the first intron of the IFN-g-encoding gene (Goris et al., 2002; Latiano et al., 2011; Silverberg et al., 2009) ; this DNA region also encodes the fifth intron of the overlapping NeST RNA-encoding gene. As they do in mice, variations in NeST RNA expression in humans could contribute to differences in T cell response and disease susceptibility. Whether and how disease-associated SNPs alter human NeST expression or function will be addressed in future studies.\n\nNatural polymorphisms, both in humans and in animal models, can yield subtle quantitative allelic effects that are more difficult to study but are more relevant to human medicine than the effects of gene knockout or other loss-of-function genetic techniques. The discovery of NeST RNA was the result of classical forward genetics. Our analysis of NeST RNA was based on the conceptual framework that regions that are thought to be ''intergenic'' encode functional RNA elements. Many genome-wide association studies have also pointed to intergenic regions as heritable causes of human disease (Libioulle et al., 2007; Sotelo et al., 2010) . This study establishes that some of these intergenic regions may encode functional lncRNAs that are critical for proper gene regulation. The promise of individualized medicine relies on our understanding of as many genetic polymorphisms Figure 6 . NeST RNA Localization and IFN-g trans Activation (A) Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA from CD8 + T cells from B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J , B10.S.NeST B10.S , and B10.S.NeST SJL/J mice were fractionated by differential centrifugation (Huarte et al., 2010) . NeST RNA, unspliced actin RNA (nuclear), and spliced actin RNA (cytoplasmic) from the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were assessed by RT-PCR and gel electrophoresis. (B) Quantitation of expression ratios of IFN-g mRNA from the B10.S and the B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J alleles. A natural SNP in the IFN-g mRNA (coordinate 117882772; see Table S1 ) was amplified by RT-PCR (top and left panel). cDNAs from B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J were subjected to a B10.S allelespecific TaqI restriction digest (bottom, left) and fragments were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. (C) Splenic CD8 + T cells were isolated from two B10.S 3 B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J heterozygous mice and stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. The proportion of B10.S and B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J -derived IFN-g mRNA was determined by densitometry of the allele-specific restriction fragments. Mixtures of in vitro transcribed RNAs at 1:10 and 1:1 ratios were used as controls.\n\nas possible in the context of individual immunological and other environmental experiences.\n\nThe DA strain of Theiler's virus was produced by transfecting the PTM762 plasmid into BHK-21 cells as previously described (McAllister et al., 1989) . Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 (Subbaiah and Stocker, 1964) strain was used. See Extended Experimental Procedures for inoculation details.\n\nCongenic B10.S.Tmevp3 SJL/J and SJL/J.Tmevp3 B10.S mice were imported from the Pasteur Institute. B10.S and SJL/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). (Balb/c x 129) F1 pseudopregnant female mice were provided by Drs. Hugh McDevitt and Grete Sonderstrup (Stanford, CA). All mice were bred at the Stanford Research Animal Facility (RAF) except for the SJLJ/J mice, which were purchased at 4 weeks of age and housed in the Stanford RAF for at least 6 weeks prior to all experiments.\n\nB10.S mice that express NeST RNA transgenically were developed by pronuclear microinjections. NeST cDNA was cloned downstream of a CD4 + and CD8 + T cell-specific promoter and upstream of an SV40 polyadenylation signal (Sawada et al., 1994) . Determination of estrous cycle, recovery of singlecell embryos, microinjection procedures, and transfer to pseudopregnant females were performed as previously described (Singer et al., 1998) .\n\nMacrophage culture and infection were performed as previously described (Arpaia et al., 2011; Martinat et al., 2002) . For T cell culture ex vivo, splenocytes were prepared and CD3 + T cell, CD4 + T cell, or CD8 + T were isolated with the use of kits from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA). Nuclei were enriched as previously described (Huarte et al., 2010) . For T cell stimulation assays, cells were cultured for 10 hr prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1.5 mM ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Figure 7 . NeST RNA's Physical Association with WDR5 Protein and Effect on Histone 3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation at the Ifng Locus (A) RNA preparations from 293T cells that were cotransfected with FLAGtagged WDR5 cDNA and either B10.S-derived NeST cDNA (blue) or SJL/Jderived NeST cDNA (sea green) were analyzed after IP with either anti-FLAG antibodies or anti-immunoglobulin G (anti-igG) control antibodies. NeST RNA retrieval was determined by measuring RNA input levels normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; bottom left panel). Specific RNA retrieval was determined by subtracting NeST RNA retrieval with anti-igG antibodies from the retrieval with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by normalization to the amount of input RNA. Immunoblot analysis (bottom right panel) confirmed FLAG-WDR5 expression following transfection and the specificity of the anti-FLAG and anti-igG antibodies. (B) IFN-g production and H3K4me3 occupancy in spleen following immune challenge. B10.S, B10.S.NeST B10.S , and B10.S.NeST SJL/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg of LPS, and spleens were dissected 4 and 6 hr later. The abundance of IFN-g protein was determined by ELISA in tissue homogenates (top panel) and the occupancy of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation at the Ifng gene was determined by ChIP-qPCR analysis (bottom panel). A schematic diagram of the positions of primers used for H3K4me3 is shown. Specific DNA retrieval was measured by normalization to the amount of input DNA and ChIP signal at GAPDH loci. (C) ChIP-qPCR analysis of H3K4me3 at the Ifng locus in CD8 + T cells from B10.S and B10.S.NeST SJL/J transgenic mice. CD8 + T cells were isolated from four B10.S and four B10.S.NeST SJL/J mice, and stimulated ex vivo with PMA and ionomycin. Occupancy of H3K4me3 at the Ifng gene was assayed 24 hr after stimulation by ChIP-qPCR at four different regions. For all pooled data, means and SE are shown.\n\nWDR5 and Chromatin IP NeST B10.S , NeST SJL/J , HOTTIP, HOTAIR, and U1-encoding cDNAs were cloned into a eukaryotic gene expression plasmid and cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 that did or did not express FlagWDR5. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as previously described, with modifications . Chromatin IP (ChIP) and qPCR were carried out according to the Farnham protocol (O'Geen et al., 2011) .\n\nProtein quantitation was performed using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or Luminex (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was performed with total RNA from cells or tissues of interest and serial dilutions of known quantities of RNA. The three B10.S and 19 SJL/J polymorphisms (Table S1 ) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.\n\nMean values and significance were determined using Student's t test. Survival curves were analyzed with the log rank test. The null hypothesis (that the strains compared were not different) was rejected when p values were %0.05. Instances when the observed differences could be reported with a confidence of 95% (*), 99% (**), or 99.9% (***) are denoted.\n\nAdditional methods are described in Extended Experimental Procedures.
