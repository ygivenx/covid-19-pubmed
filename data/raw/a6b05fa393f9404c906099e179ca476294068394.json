{"title": "Kinetic Analysis of Bacteriophage Sf6 Binding to Outer Membrane Protein A Using Whole Virions", "body": "Virtually all viruses must translocate their genetic information into their respective host cells and replicate via the host cell machinery to produce progeny [1] . dsDNA bacteriophages, which infect bacteria, are the most abundant viruses in the biosphere, with a global population estimated to be greater than 10 30 [2] . The molecular mechanisms that govern bacteriophage attachment to their hosts are not completely understood. Host recognition must be well coordinated by the virus in order to ensure fitness and progeny formation, as premature genome ejection does not result in a successful infection. One common mechanism bacteriophages employ is to utilize a portion of the host cell as a receptor [3] , and this can be through interactions with surface glycans, proteins, or both.\n\nTeichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and other components of Gram-positive bacteria have been shown to be receptors for many phages [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . For instance, \u03c629 recognizes glucosylated teichoic acid in Bacillus subtilis [10] . Bacteriophage SPP1, in addition to teichoic acid, also requires recognition of membrane protein YueB to irreversibly adsorb and commit to infection [8, 9] . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or proteins localized on the outer surface of Gram-negative bacteria are also used as phage receptors [4] . For instance, bacteriophage T7 recognizes the LPS of E. coli [11] and phage S16 recognizes outer membrane protein C (OmpC) [12] . Different forms of LPS are commonly used as phage receptors and attachment is regulated by either the length of LPS or by specific O-antigen modifications, for phages such as P22 and Sf6 [13, 14] .\n\nSequence-diverse Omps are also commonly used as receptors by phages that infect Gramnegative hosts; examples include OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, LamB, FhuA, as well as others [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Sf6 infection of Shigella flexneri is a two-step process that utilizes both glycans and proteins during infection. First, Sf6 reversibly recognizes and then hydrolyzes LPS via its tailspikes [23, 24] . Second, Sf6 interacts irreversibly with a protein receptor to commit to infection [25] . Sf6 preferentially uses OmpA, but can also use OmpC when OmpA is absent [25] . Sf6 can likely utilize a third, as of yet unidentified receptor, as infection still occurs in the absence of both OmpA and OmpC [25] . Bacteriophage Sf6 has an inherent ability to utilize multiple Omps for infection [25] . Although host range studies have generated mutants of other phages that can switch to utilize alternative receptors when under selection pressure [17, 18, 26, 27] , an innate ability to recognize multiple receptor types is not a common phenomenon, making Sf6 somewhat unique.\n\nOur previous work showed that OmpA surface loops mediate Sf6 infection and confer host range [23] . Individual amino acid substitutions in OmpA loops result in a range of Sf6 infection efficiencies [23] . In an effort to better understand Sf6 interactions with OmpA, and how variations affect binding, we used biolayer interferometry (BLI) to determine the kinetics of these interactions. BLI is an optical biosensing technique used to measure the kinetic parameters of biomolecular interactions [28, 29] . It works by tethering one binding partner (the ligand, in this study, whole phage) to a fiber optic sensor tip. The ligand-loaded sensor is then dipped into a sample that contains a known concentration of the binding partner (the analyte, in this study, purified receptor proteins). White light reflects off of two optical layers in the tip, establishing an interference pattern, which is measured by a photodetector. Binding between ligand and analyte causes the distance between optical layers to increase, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern.

Examination of several different analyte concentrations allows for robust global fits.\n\nPreviously published BLI kinetic analyses have used purified host receptors and studied interactions with purified viral receptor binding proteins [30] [31] [32] , yet no such studies are published to date for bacteriophages. Here, we successfully immobilized intact Sf6 virions by amine crosslinking. To our knowledge, this also represents the first study of whole virion immobilization completed on the BLI platform. We determined the equilibrium dissociation constant of Sf6 to OmpA, and found it is 36 nM. Moreover, we showed that Sf6 bound to five variant OmpAs that demonstrated phenotypic changes [23] , yet the resulting kinetic parameters vary only slightly when compared to the native Shigella OmpA protein. These results suggest that the altered infection efficiencies observed in vivo are not solely dependent on the rate at which Sf6 interacts with OmpA.\n\nMedia and strains. Bacterial growth, plating experiments, and preparations of Sf6 phage stocks were all completed in Lysogeny broth (LB). Bacteriophage Sf6 (clear plaque mutant [33] ) was propagated on ompA -C -S. flexneri (dual ompA and ompC gene knock out), as previously described [25] . Phage used for in vitro genome ejection experiments were stored in phage buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6 and 10 mM MgCl 2 ) and phage used for BLI experiments were stored in NaOAc buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0 and 2 mM MgCl 2 ). S. flexneri strain PE577 was used for phage plating experiments [22] .

The initial concentration of purified OmpA-TM was determined using a Bradford assay. We then created 0.2 mg/mL stock solutions, ran a portion of each on a 15% SDS gel, and quantified the resulting bands by gel densitometry (BIORAD Gel Doc XR+) as previously described [23] to ensure that the final concentration of variant OmpA-TM dilutions were identical to OmpA-TM S.flex .\n\nUsing a BulldogBio kit, S. flexneri LPS was extracted from PE577 as previously described [25] .

Baseline was established in 1.8 mM Triton X-100 (diluted in water) over a period of 300 seconds. Sensors were then exposed to various OmpA-TM analytes (ranging from 1,000 nM to 7.8 nM) for 300 seconds to measure association. Dissociation was measured for 300 seconds by dipping the sensors into 1.8 mM Triton X-100. Data were reference-subtracted using the signal from crosslinked phage exposed only to 1.8 mM Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding was measured by exposing a sensor without tethered phage to the highest concentration of OmpA-TM S.flex and was found to be negligible. Data were fit using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and BiaEvaluation Software (GE Healthcare, USA). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Global fits were calculated from each set of experimental data, and overall there was relatively little binding variation between separate titrations.\n\nTemperature does not significantly change the kinetic parameters of Sf6 and OmpA binding. We purified the transmembrane domain of S. flexneri OmpA (\"OmpA-TM S.flex \" [23] ), confirmed we had functional OmpA-TMs by our previously reported assays [23, 25] ,and then measured the ability of OmpA-TMs to induce Sf6 genome ejection in vitro prior to performing BLI experiments. For all BLI experiments described herein, the ligand, Sf6, was immobilized on amine reactive (AR2G) sensors. OmpA-TMs reconstituted into detergent micelles were used as analytes. To ensure that sodium acetate, pH 4.0 buffer (a low pH buffer in which phage are not typically stored, but which was necessary for tethering to sensors) had no effect on the phage, we monitored the titer of the phage stock over time, comparing it to phage stored in phage dilution buffer, pH 7.6, and found no significant differences. Moreover, we tested the ability of OmpA-All rights reserved.

In addition, Sf6 binding to OmpA-TM S.flex was specific, as phage Sf6 did not bind to other outer membrane proteins.\n\nTo determine kinetic parameters of Sf6 and OmpA-TM S.flex binding, we measured the change in interference patterns over time to generate sensorgrams at 25, 30, and 37 o C (Figure 1 ).\n\nThe generated data were fit in GraphPad prism to a global 1:1 association -then -dissociation model ( Figure 1 ). Calculated kinetic parameters are shown in Table 1 . The analyte concentrations tested ranged from 62.5 nM to 1,000 nM. Consistent with our hypothesis and published results from other bacteriophage and host receptor biosensing work [12, [30] [31] [32] 34, 35] , OmpA-TM S.flex bound Sf6 with nM affinity that varied only slightly with changes in temperature.\n\nBased on the calculated parameters in OmpA-TM S.flex bound Sf6 with relatively fast-on and slow-off kinetics. Overall, these data suggest that temperature differences do not significantly affect Sf6 binding to OmpA. All rights reserved.

Goodness-of-fit is described by \u03c7 2 [36] ; the lower the \u03c7 2 , the better the model describes the fit of the data. In addition to \u03c7 2 , the one-state model was the only one to pass the F test, a standard statistic for ensuring validity of a kinetic model [37] . Additionally, equilibrium binding analyses of the data shown in figure 1 yielded K D s of 82.3, 99.6, and 89.9 nM (Table 1) which are all essentially indistinguishable from each other and in reasonable proximity to the constants derived from the kinetic models, i.e. the secondary component (seen with all OmpA-TM variants) is minor and probably reflective of some artifact rather than biology, e.g. ligand presentation. Another potential explanation is that detergent micelle size varies within a preparation, yet is usually smaller than the membrane-inserted portion of a single OmpA \u03b2-barrel (~19 kDa) [38] . Therefore, in some cases OmpA stoichiometry within micelles may be a 1:1, but in other cases, multiple micelles likely aggregate around a single OmpA protein, as reported in [38] . This variance likely explains at least part of the complex behavior of our data at high analyte concentrations, and why the residuals are not random at these concentrations.\n\nSf6 genome ejection efficiency is highest at physiological temperatures. We were surprised that the binding kinetics did not change greatly with temperature as phage ejection can often be affected by temperature [8, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Therefore, we tested if Sf6 genome ejection was affected in vitro using our standard assay [23, 25] and measured the efficiency of genome ejection at 25, 30, and 37 o C (Figure 2 ). Reactions were incubated for 10 minutes, which is within the timeframe of the lengths of BLI association phases. Consistent with previously reported data, at 37 o C the majority (>95%) of Sf6 virions have lost their genomes at 10 minutes post initiation of ejection [23, 25] . However, as temperature decreased, the observed genome ejection efficiency in vitro All rights reserved.

[23] and it was thought that these changes may be due to differences in binding affinities.\n\nWe purified various OmpA-TMs: one from E. coli, \"OmpA-TM E.coli \" and four that deviated by single amino acid substitutions from the native S. flexneri sequence (D66A, N67E, P111E, and N155E). These variants were chosen to represent a broad range of phenotypes [23] . Here, we measured the kinetics of Sf6 binding to these various receptor types using BLI and calculated the kinetic and affinity constants for each ( Figure 3 , and Table 2 ). Again, some complexity was evident but a simple 1:1 binding model fit the data better than two-state parallel or conformational change models. The only exception was the lowest analyte concentration for N67E ( Figure 3 , magenta line), for which global fits did not converge, and was therefore eliminated from the analysis. The calculated parameters were consistent with fast-on and slowoff kinetics. OmpA-TM E.coli and all S.flexneri OmpA-TM variants bound Sf6 with nM affinity; the K D s ranged between 6.9 and 65.4 nM. The kinetic parameters of binding for the variants differed only slightly when compared to those of OmpA-TM S.flex . Moreover, the small differences observed do not correspond to the phenotypes previously reported [23] . For example,\n\nOmpA is ten-fold lower than on cells expressing S. flexneri OmpA. OmpA-TM E.coli is unable to efficiently induce genome ejection in vitro of Sf6 [23] , yet the binding affinities of the two proteins are highly similar 25 and 36 nM. Furthermore, N155E exhibited similar characteristics to E. coli OmpA yet displayed the highest affinity (7 nM) . Given the small range of affinities observed in the BLI data collected and the lack of 1 1 correlation to our previous work, we interpret these kinetic differences as not significant, particularly given the experimental and instrumental set-up in BLI [36] . Overall these data show that there are no large kinetic differences in the rates at which Sf6 binds various forms of OmpA. OmpA-TM E.coli 8.7 x 10 4 2.2 x 10 -3 24.8 \n\nTo test our hypothesis that phenotypic differences [23] may be due to differences in binding affinities of Sf6 to OmpA, we purified six versions of OmpA-TM (S. flexneri, E. coli, and single amino acid substitutions: D66A, N67E, P111E, and N155E). To determine the kinetic parameters of Sf6 and OmpA-TMs, whole Sf6 virions were crosslinked to AR2G sensors and we measured changes in the interference of white light using BLI to generate sensorgrams.\n\nConsistent with BLI and SPR studies published with purified phage proteins and host cells [12] or purified receptor proteins [43] , we determined the binding affinity of Sf6 to OmpA-TM S.flex to be nM in affinity (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). Kinetics were fast-on and slow-off and fit a simple onestate model reasonably well. Furthermore, OmpA-TM E.coli and S. flexneri OmpA-TM variants All rights reserved.

For example, Bonaparte et al. showed that the equilibrium dissociation constant for Hendra virus attachment glycoprotein to its receptor, human ephrin-B2 is 1 nM [34] . Another SPR study showed that purified receptor binding proteins of human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and a bat coronavirus HKU4 can bind to human CD26 with K D s of 18.4 nM and 35.7 \u03bcM, respectively [35] . Recently, Marti et al. showed via SPR that the binding affinity of the long tail fiber of bacteriophage S16, the phage tail protein that mediates interaction with the host, and its host Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica is ~ 5 nM [12] .\n\nThe data presented herein suggest that the previously reported differences in Sf6 infection efficiencies seen in vivo and the differences in Sf6 genome ejection efficiencies in vitro [23] are not based solely on the kinetics of receptor binding. There are no significant kinetic differences between Sf6 binding to the various OmpA-TMs, nor are there any significant changes when temperature is varied, even though both factors have been shown to cause changes in infection efficiency. Our results are similar to those in another study in which the authors use SPR and demonstrate that amino acid substitutions in the coronavirus receptor binding protein do not greatly affect the overall kinetic parameters when binding to the human receptor CD26 [35] .\n\nTheir data support the idea that virus: host recognition is more complex and not dependent solely upon binding affinities. Our work, in combination with the coronavirus data, suggest that this All rights reserved.

Kinetics alone do not explain the changes in infection efficiencies observed when temperature is varied or when amino acid substitutions are present in the receptor protein. Therefore we hypothesize that conformational changes in the phage upon interaction with receptors are key to effective host recognition.\n\nThe current working model for Podoviridae attachment is a three step model [44] . In the first step the virion binds to LPS reversibly. In the second step there is likely an irreversible interaction with a secondary receptor. Third, the genome is translocated from the phage capsid into the cell concurrent with several conformational changes in virion structure. Hu et al. have shown that bacteriophage T7 [45] undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection, particularly in the tail machinery. In summation, we propose a model in which Sf6: Omp receptor recognition is not solely based on kinetics, but likely also involves conformational changes induced when docking to a cell surface (Figure 4 ). Sf6 interacts with LPS first via its tailspikes [25, 44, 46] likely coming into contact with the host surface at an angle, as work with a closely related phage, P22, has shown [47] . Once Sf6 has cleaved enough LPS repeats [24, 48] , and is close enough to the surface of the cell it interacts with its secondary receptor, an Omp [25] . Upon interaction with Omps by the tail machinery, a conformational change in the phage is likely triggered. Amino acid substitutions in the loops of OmpA may affect the ability of the phage to adopt the correct conformation to promote channel formation, which is necessary to translocate the DNA genome [44, [49] [50] [51] . Although more work is necessary to discern a complete understanding of Sf6 (and Podoviridae) infection, the data presented here shed light on the kinetics of Sf6 and OmpA binding, which is an important step during host recognition.

Our previous work showed that keeping LPS constant, but varying different OmpAs resulted in differences of ejection efficiencies and rates in vitro [23] . Since both components are required for infection [23, 25] , it may be possible that the LPS helps to \"prime\" the phage to interact with OmpA, by inducing a subtle, initial conformational change that could induce different interactions with OmpA loop variants. Future work includes building on our current platform and will include a much more complex binding landscape. Ultimately, we hope to expand these studies to liposomes containing LPS and OmpA and/or whole S. flexneri cells to better elucidate the mechanistic properties of the Sf6 infection process.
