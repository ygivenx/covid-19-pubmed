{"title": "A Tempo-geographic Analysis of Global COVID-19 Epidemic Outside of China", "body": "After the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, and after the epidemic turning better in China, the world outside of China started to experience an ongoing and worsening epidemic. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), by 14 th Mar., 2020 a total of 142,539 cases have been reported in 136 countries and territories, and 9,769 new cases were reported on the single day of 14 th Mar. [1] Italy, Iran, and South Korea aside China have the highest number of confirmed cases (17,660; 11,364; 8086) as of 14 th Mar., 2020. [1] In response, highly affected countries have adopted innovative curbing interventions such as whole city lockdowns, the establishment of drive-through screening centers and banning large social gatherings amongst others to locally contain the virus and prevent further new cases. [2, 3] Affected and unaffected countries following WHO guidelines are developing or have commenced implementation of country-specific prevention, early case detection as well as quarantine and treatment policies. [4] Some countries have closed borders and/or suspended flight commutation with major affected countries including South Korea and Iran regardless of the WHO cautions. [5, 6] Such drastic measures are very essential in the pandemic control, but may also negatively affect the global economy if maintained over a longer duration as countries like China and South Korea contribute largely to global industrial production and provision of goods and services. [7, 8] Although some low-middle income countries (LMICs) in Africa remained unaffected for a while, 15 African countries and territories have reported a total of 73 confirmed cases as of 14 th Mar., 2020. [1] This furthers concerns of a pandemic as under-resourced LMICs in the region lack adequate infrastructures to successfully contain a breakout and are dependent on .

[4] Therefore, further spread of the virus threatens shortage to medical supplies and further outbreaks in LMICs could lead to high COVID-19 related mortality. [9] As such prompt responses and global strategic alliances are required immediately to prevent further outbreaks and avert the threatening pandemic.\n\nAs more countries get affected and the reported number of cases outside China keeps growing with each passing day, it is important to study the global disease outbreak, with especial focus on disease transmission, development trend, and new epicenters. Obtaining and analyzing this data will not only expand current knowledge on the disease global trends but also inform strategic planning and alliance for prompt global containment of the disease and prevention of further outbreaks.\n\nThis study aims to understand the global disease pandemic geo-spatial pattern, epidemic trends and identify new and emerging epicenters requiring urgent attention for decision making.\n\nThe research studied the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak at the aspects of the global epidemic trend, geographic transmission patterns, and the changes in disease distribution from 13 th Jan.\n\nto 14 th Mar. 2020.\n\nThe disease data of China were collected from China's national health commission. The disease data outside of China were mainly collected from WHO daily COVID-19 situation reports, [1] except for the disease data before 19 th Jan. and the data about the origins of the .

The spatial data were derived from GADM version 3.6. [10] All the data were publicly available.\n\nStatistical analyses were done using Joinpoint Trend Analysis version 4\u20277\u20270\u20270 Software (National Cancer Institute, USA) and R Studio software (R Core Team, 2016). The geographic outputs were generated by ArcGIS 10\u20272 software (Esri Inc, Redlands, California).\n\nThe pandemic disease outbreak was studied and analyzed through the epidemic trend over time by joinpoint regressions, the growth of infected countries and the number of infections over time, the global transmission routes of first reported cases in countries, and the geographic distribution over time by dynamic maps.\n\nAs of 14 th Mar., SRAS-CoV-2 has affected 134 countries and territories outside of China with 61,518 cases reported.\n\nGlobally, the joinpoint regression models showed that both the number of new cases and the number of cumulative cases were in rapid growth ( Figure 1A .

Along with the increasing trend of new and cumulative cases, the number of countries and territories outside of China with reported COVID-19 cases also increased from one on 13 th .

Among these 134 affected countries and territories, 59 reported no more than 10 cases, 49 reported over 10 cases, 18 reported over 100 cases, six reported over 1000 cases, and two reported over 10,000 by 8 th Mar. Overall, the number of affected countries and territories experienced two increases. The first increase started from 23 rd Jan till 1 st Feb., where most countries reported 10 or fewer cases while several countries reported over 10 cases from 28 th Jan. The increase in number of affected countries then slowed and only five new countries reported COVID-19 cases from 1 st -23 rd Feb., leading to a total of 28 affected countries by 23 rd Feb. However, the confirmed cases continued to increase in some affected countries as number of countries with over 10 reported cases grew from 5 to 10 on 1 st Feb, and South Korea, Japan, and Italy reported over 100 cases on 24 th Feb.\n\nThe second apparent increase in the number of affected countries started from 25 th Feb. till 8 th Mar, during which 101 more countries reported confirmed COVID-19 cases. South Korea was the first country outside of China that reported over 1000 cases on 26 th Feb, but the number of its total confirmed cases was then surpassed by Italy, which became the first country with confirmed cases exceeded 10,000 on 11 th Mar. Six countries (Korea, France, Spain, Germany, United States, and Switzerland) had reported over 1,000 cases, among which four were European countries. Especially, the areas surrounding Italy has become a new big epicenter, in where the number of newly confirmed cases increases very rapid. More and more countries had reported over 10 or 100 cases during the second increasing period, although countries with less than 10 cases remained the majority. The fast increase of infected countries and confirmed cases demonstrate a widespread of COVID-19 globally and the occurrence of epidemics in regions outside of China.\n\n.

(the date when WHO first classified the transmission type for affected countries), 7 th Mar., and 14 th Mar. (Figure 3 ). The map on 28 th Feb. showed that China was the largest epidemic center and had the most cases exported to other countries and territories ( Figure 3A ); but these cases were mainly reported before 6 th Feb. (Table S1 ). Italy and Iran were the second epidemic centers for exporting COVID-19 as majority of the newly affected countries were close to and reported their first cases originated from the two countries after 21 st Feb. By 7 th Mar., more of \n\nDynamic maps of the disease distribution were produced to show the changes in new cases .

In addition, countries in Africa and Americas should try their best to avoid becoming the next epicenter.\n\nDifferent epidemiological patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic were observed between China and the world outside of China. Our findings showed that countries outside of China experienced a much longer slow-growing stage but long increasing period, and it is hard to predict when the global epidemic will reach a turning point. These results have several important implications: First, the world lost the most valuable time for COVID-19 control after the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. After China taking the comprehensive prevention and control strategies, and after the WHO issued the PHEIC, many countries did not take .

Second, the global situation is more complicated than that of China, and it is hard to take as the same level of action as China did. The global COVID-19 epidemic is under the impact of available of medical resources, religion, political, economic and other comprehensive reasons, and as these vary from country by country, a \"one-to-all\" strategy may not suit all. Thus, tailored strategies are another tsunami which will further worsen the pandemic. [12] LMIC countries should fully implement robust containment and control activities as suggested by WHO and evidenced by the Chinese experience. [13] Our study indicated that local transmission has been established in more than 50% of the countries that reported cases of COVID-19. The establishment of local transmission and the increase in the number of epidemic centers indicates a widespread and that a sustained transmission of COVID-19 has been established globally, and therefore, the war against COVID-19 may have changed from an emerging response to a long-term war.

This study has some limitations. First, the data collected were from publicly available datasets.\n\nThey lacked detailed epidemiological information as well as the detailed geographic information on patients for further assessing the potential driving forces as well as more detailed hotspots of the pandemic. Secondly, our analysis is lagged by a time gap between when a suspected case identification and case confirmation, but it does provide time-sensitive and evidence-based information to aid in further response to the epidemic. Finally, due to constraints of detection capability and technique, the underreporting of cases especially in developing countries may result in underestimation of the study.\n\n.
