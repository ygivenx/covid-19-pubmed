{"title": "Chemical synthesis, crystal structure, versatile evaluation of their biological activities and molecular simulations of novel pyrithiobac derivatives", "body": "The thioether (or sulfoether) compounds are of great interest because they are either useful intermediates for organic synthesis or meaningful agents with biological activities [1] . For example, dimethyl sulfide and phenyl sulfide are common industrial chemicals for the synthesis of pesticides, medicines and dyes. Diallyl sulfide, a naturally occurring component of garlic, exhibits anticancer activity [2] . Methionine was reported in the 1950s to have therapeutic effect against infective hepatitis [3] . Song et al. synthesized a series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole thioether derivatives (example-a) and found them to display strong antibacterial activity [4] . Yang et al. prepared some novel thioether-substituted flavonoids (example-b) and some of them showed satisfactory antiproliferative activity [5] . Chu et al. designed some nucleoside conjugates of thioether phospholipids (example-c) and favorable anti-HIV activity was observed [6] .\n\nPyrithiobac (PTB) is a particular thioether compound in that the sulfur atom is connected by a phenyl ring and a pyrimidine ring, which in fact is a powerful herbicide used in cotton fields with excellent selectivity [7] . The target of this herbicide is acetehydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, EC 2.2.1.6), a special biological enzyme that exists only in plants and microbes [8] . A recent crystallography study showed that PTB binds with plant AHAS in a similar cavity provided by two neighboring subunits [9] . Nevertheless, PTB derivatives have not been fully explored till now. As is known, compounds containing heterocycle ring such as pyrimidine or triazine often show diverse agricultural or medicinal activities. For instances, pyramat is a successful insecticide with a pyrimidine ring developed in the 1960s and anilazine is a traditional fungicide with a triazine ring that have been used for over 60 years [10, 11] . Recently, some aromatic disulfides with pyrimidine ring (exampled) were discovered to be potent inhibitors of main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV M pro ) [12] . The chemical structures of dimethyl sulfide, phenyl sulfide, diallyl sulfide, methionine, example-a, example-b, example-c, pyrithiobac, pyramat, anilazine and example-d mentioned above are shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nIn view of these backgrounds, herein we have designed and synthesized a series of 35 novel PTB derivatives and investigated their biological activities upon various bioassay platforms. To our delight, the title compounds exhibited multiple bioactivities, against agricultural weeds, insects, pathogenic plant fungi or plant virus, and medicinal infections caused by fungus or SARSassociated coronavirus. For compounds that showed remarkable activity against SARS-CoV M pro , very low cellular cytotoxicity was observed against mammalian 293 T cells. In addition, the chemical structure of 6e6 was elucidated clearly from single crystal X-ray diffraction, which evidently indicated that these PTB derivatives were chemically prepared successfully. Molecular simulations were performed and it was found that HOMO-1 might contribute to AHAS inhibition from DFT calculation and a plausible binding mode of inhibitor 6e5 with SARS-CoV M pro was generated via molecular docking.\n\nThe chemistry of intermediates 2 and 3 is illustrated in Scheme 1, and the synthetic route for the target compound 6 is presented in Scheme 2. Although 2 and 3 were commercially available, they were chemically synthesized in our laboratory. Various mercaptobenzonitriles 2 were prepared from corresponding fluorobenzonitriles 1 via a nucleophilic substitution attacked by a sulfhydryl group provided by sodium sulfide nonahydrate to give desirable outputs. 2 were further hydrolyzed under alkaline condition from mercaptobenzonitriles to mercaptobenzoic acids 3 with satisfactory yields. Some intermediates were hard to be purified and were used directly in the following reaction. According to the literature [13] , hydrolysis of 2 occurs easily under the condition of 15% sodium hydroxide at 150 C, however, this reaction was not observed until the condition was changed to 30% sodium hydroxide at 175 C with 0.9 equivalent of sodium sulfide nonahydrate added to the solution in an autoclave reactor. It should be noted that when there is a trifluoromethyl group in the ortho or para position of the hydrosulphonyl group of 2, the trifluoromethyl group itself will be hydrolyzed at the same time when the cyanogroup is hydrolyzed, however when the trifluoromethyl group is at the meta position of the hydrosulphonyl group, the hydrolysis of trifluoromethyl group does not happen, which has been confirmed by the final compounds. This is in agreement with an early report by Jones in 1947 [14] . The synthesis and characterizations of the intermediates 2 and 3 are detailed in the supplementary material.\n\nFor the target compounds, in total there are four different synthesis routes. Compound 6e1 to 6e13 were prepared from 2 and 2chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine 4 using triethylamine as a base in acetonitrile [15] . Compound 6e14 to 6e21 were synthesized from 3 and 4, but a more potent base sodium methoxide was used in methanol. Compound 6e34 and 6e35 were also started from 4, with substituted phenyl 2\u2032 as the nucleophile, potassium hydroxide as the base in tetrahydrofuran [16] . In all these three routes, the chlorine atom in the triazine ring is attacked and substituted by the hydrosulphonyl or hydroxyl group in 2, 2\u2032 and 3. For the synthesis of compound 6e22 to 6e33, intermediate 2 or 3 reacted with 4,6dimethoxy-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrimidine 5 in ethanol to give the final product, which is also a nucleophilic substitution but in this case the leaving group is a methanesulfonyl group in the pyrimidine ring and the corresponding base is sodium bicarbonate [17] . The yields for the target compounds were in the range of 10%e58%, with a majority of 20%e30%, indicating that further optimization of the reaction conditions is required.\n\nThe chemical structures of 6e1 to 6e35 were fully characterized by means of 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and HRMS. The melting points of all the target compounds were also determined. To further confirm the molecular structure and chemical bonding of the target compounds, 6e6 was successfully recrystallized from ethyl acetate/ petroleum ether to give colorless crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. 2 , the two aromatic rings are connected by a sulfur atom and the whole molecule adopts a bent shape, which is highly similar to the conformation of PTB in complex with plant AHAS [9] .\n\nAs can be seen in Table 1 , most PTB derivatives displayed preferable inhibitory activities against C. albicans AHAS at 100 mM concentration, and a few of them still showed >50% inhibition at 10 mM. In contrast, PTB itself was a very weak inhibitor of this enzyme, the inhibition of which was only 40% at 100 mM. This is close to the reported data by Garcia et al. [18] . The other control ethoxysulfuron, one of the best AHAS inhibitors to date, had 96.8%\n\ninhibition even at 10 mM concentration. Among the target compounds, 6e1, 6e3, 6e5, 6e9, 6e14, 6e17, 6e18, 6e22 and 6e27 had some antifungal activities from the YNB media cell based assay. For the anti-Candida activity, there is some difference between the results from RPMI 1640 media and that from YNB media, and from the latter the activity is higher. It is known that, YNB media does not contain the BCAAs while RPMI media contains these amino acids, therefore there will be a shift of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between the data from the two medias if AHAS inhibition is the cause of the antifungal activity. The results here indicated that the observed anti-Candida activity was due to this reason, which is also in accordance with our previous report [19] . When the observation time changed to 48 h instead of 24 h, MIC data increased to different extent (data now shown), which means that the anti-Candida activity here was an inhibitory effect, not a fungicidal effect. There exists a strong correlation between the fungal AHAS inhibition data and the antifungal activity for 6e9, 6e22 and 6e27. No antifungal activity was found for any compound with very weak AHAS inhibition. For comparison, PTB did not have any inhibitory activity in the cell based assay at all the conditions, however, ethoxysulfuron was a very potent inhibitor in the YNB media, with MIC values of 0.39 mg/L against all the three fungal isolates. These experimental results were similar to the reported potencies of the two commercial AHAS inhibitors [18, 19] .\n\nThe in vitro inhibition of Arabidopsis thiliana AHAS and herbicidal activity of the target compounds are listed in Table 2 . Generally, most compounds demonstrated excellent inhibition of plant AHAS at 100 mM concentration. Compound 6e13, 6e22, 6e23, 6e24, 6e25, 6e26 and 6e27 displayed complete inhibition of AHAS, as well as PTB. At 10 mM concentration, compound 6e21, 6e22 and 6e24 still contributed >60% AHAS inhibition. For the in vivo herbicidal activity, compound 6e22, 6e24, 6e25, 6e34 and 6e35 displayed >80% rape root growth inhibitory activity at 100 mg/L dosage, while compound 6e4, 6e5, 6e9, 6e10, 6e16, 6e18, 6e23, 6e26, 6e28 and 6e29 possessed >50% herbicidal activity. At 10 mg/L, compound 6e22, 6e24 and 6e35 still maintained >70% rape root inhibition. As can be seen, PTB was not only a very strong inhibitor of plant AHAS, but also an extremely potent herbicide. Taken together the plant AHAS inhibition data and herbicidal activity, 6e22 and 6e24 were subjected to greenhouse pot assay for further evaluation, which is illustrated in Table S1 . At 300 g/ha dosage, these two compounds displayed potent herbicidal activities, in both pre-emergence and post-emergence assays for dicot weed species Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexu. Interestingly, 6e24 also showed 72.3% inhibition against monocot Echinochloacrus-galli from the post-emergence assay. For comparison, the herbicidal activity of PTB was much stronger even at the dosage of 30 g/ha, with the only exception of the post-emergence activity against Echinochloacrus-galli.\n\nPTB is the best commercial inhibitors of plant AHAS in this family but it is a rather weak inhibitor of fungal AHAS. Meanwhile, the commercial sulfonylurea herbicide ethoxysulfuron is also a potent a strong anti-Candida agent. This implied that the two family of herbicidal AHAS inhibitors are different when subjected to fungal inhibition. Nevertheless, here the synthesized new derivatives demonstrated some interesting difference with PTB. For instance, 6e22 was more potent regarding the fungal AHAS and anti-Candida activity than PTB was, while the herbicidal activity of 6e22 was significantly weaker than that of PTB. In both fungal AHAS and plant AHAS inhibition tests, 6e22 was one of the best inhibitor. For 6e22, there is a fluorine atom at the para position of the sulfur atom, while for PTB, a chlorine atom locates at the meta position of the sulfur atom. This minor structural difference has led to significant difference in their biological activities. A compound that combines the feature of PTB and 6e22 has been designed, which has fluorine atoms or chlorine atoms at both para and meta positions of the sulfur atom in the molecule. This new compound is expected to have improved AHAS inhibition.\n\nMost of the target compounds together with PTB were also subjected to the bioactivity against six common plant pathogenic fungi, and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 3 . The commercial fungicide chlorothalonil was used as a positive control. At 50 mg/L concentration, the tested compounds showed moderate to excellent antifungal activity against the plant fungi. For Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, 6e19, 6e20, 6e25, 6e26 and 6e31 exhibited >70% inhibition. For Phytophthora capsici, the best compound was 6e28 with inhibitory activity of 66.7%. For Physalospora piricola, 6e3, 6e5, 6e6, 6e7 and 6e26 displayed >70% biological activity. For Rhizoctonia cerealis, 6e11, 6e23, 6e25, 6e26, 6e27, 6e35 and PTB had >85% inhibitory rates, while 6e24, 6e28 and 6e31 had >70% potency. For Watermelon anthracnose and Rice bakanae, none of the tested compounds showed powerful inhibition. The concentrations for 50% of the maximal effect (EC 50 ) of 6e11, 6e23, 6e25, 6e26, 6e27, 6e35 and PTB against R. cerealis were determined subsequently and the corresponding EC 50 data were 12.4 mg/L, 14.1 mg/L, 11.8 mg/L, 9.2 mg/L, 11.4 mg/L, 10.9 mg/L and 15.4 mg/L, respectively. The control chlorothalonil was active against all the selected fungi with inhibition data >75%, and EC 50 against R. cerealis was 5.3 mg/L. Compound 6e26 was the best inhibitor among all the compounds, showing >75% inhibition against three fungi and the best inhibition of 60.6% against R. bakanae, which might be considered as a potential fungicide for further study. It should be pointed out that the media for this assay contains the amino acids and we failed to try these assays under YNB media, therefore antifungal activity determined here does not necessarily have direct relationship with AHAS inhibition, or AHAS inhibition might not be the sole factor. Although 6e22 was not subjected to the plant fungi assay, there were some overlaps between the anti-Candida activity and antifungal activities against plant fungi disease, such as 6e3, 6e5 and 6e27. Obviously, C. albicans and the plant pathogenic fungi are different species. PTB did not exhibit any anti-Candida activity, but it was an inhibitor of R. cerealis. Table 4 presents the larvicidal activity of the target compounds against Mythimna separata at 600 mg/L concentration. 6e3, 6e14 and 6e20 exhibited >75% insecticidal activity, while 6e6 and 6e9 showed no activity for this test. In contrast, the commercial pesticide rynaxypyr displayed 100% insecticidal activity at a much lower concentration of 10 mg/L, much stronger than any of the tested target compounds. This is a valuable attempt despite that these compounds possess very weak insecticidal activity, and it implies that some PTB derivatives might be useful for the research of novel insecticides.\n\nMost of the title compounds were bioassayed their passivation efficacies against TMV, and the determined inhibitory values are listed in Table 5 . Ten of the tested compounds, comprising 6e4, 6e5, 6e10, 6e19, 6e20, 6e22, 6e25, 6e28, 6e34 and 6e35, were found to have anti-TMV activity at 500 mg/L concentration. Among these compounds, 6e20, 6e22 and 6e25 showed >40% antiviral activity, better than that of commercial antiviral ribaviron (37.6%) but weaker than another commercial antiviral ningnanmycin (56.4%). Therefore these compounds were subjected to further evaluation of the biological activity at 100 mg/L concentration, and the determined passivation efficacies were 6.2% for 6e20, 11.4% for 6e22 and 6.8% for 6e25, respectively. At this condition, ribavirin had 11.9% antiviral activity and ningnanmycin had 27.8% efficiency. These data suggests that the ningnanmycin is superior to the PTB derivatives, and 6e22 is comparable to ribaviron at the tested conditions.\n\nThe biological activities against SARS-CoV M pro of the target compounds were also evaluated in this study and the inhibitory results that were tested at 20 mM are listed in Table 6 . Compound 6e4, 6e5 and 6e7 exhibited 100% inhibition, while 6e1, 6e2, 6e3, 6e6, 6e14, 6e17 and 6e30 displayed >75% inhibitions. At the same condition, PTB only showed 12.2% inhibition towards SARS-CoV M pro . 6e4, 6e5 and 6e7 were additionally measured their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values for SARS-CoV M pro , together with their half cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) data for 293 T cells. The determined IC 50 for 6e4 was 3.30 mM and its CC 50 was 30.5 mM, the corresponding data for 6e5 were 4.47 mM (IC 50 ) and >200 mM (CC 50 ), and for 6e7 were 4.54 mM (IC 50 ) and 53.5 mM (CC 50 ). Therefore 6e5 has a surprising selectivity index of 44.5, showing that it is a promising hit for further investigation. The inhibition curve of 6e5 against SARS-CoV M pro is drawn in Fig. 3 .\n\nFor a comparison, 6e4 and 6e5 both showed anti-TMV activity and inhibition against SARS-CoV M pro , while other compounds are not within the overlap. There exist big difference between TMV and SARS-CoV, and it is not likely that major overlap exists between them.\n\nAlthough different compounds showed different biological activities. 6e5 displayed desirable activities from all the bioassays and it has a low cellular cytotoxicity against 293 T cells. Therefore it is an excellent starting point for further molecular design. Of course, other normal cell lines treated by 6e5 need to be accessed for better estimation of the biological safety of potent compound and this is anticipated to be done in the near future.\n\nIt is generally accepted that frontier molecular orbital contributes significantly to the inhibitor-enzyme interaction [20e23]. Among the title compounds, 6e22 showed potent inhibitions for both fungal AHAS and plant AHAS, as well as its desirable anti-Candida activity and herbicidal activity. Meanwhile, 6e8 and 6e12 were very weak inhibitors towards both AHASs, and no in vivo activities were observed. These compounds were then subjected to theoretical calculations by means of DFT/B3LYP method. From the crystal structure of PTB bound with A. thaliana AHAS, it is clear that the pyrimidine ring forms a p-p interaction with a neighboring residue Trp574 [9] , which means that the pyrimidine ring or the triazine ring in the newly synthesized compounds might be involved in this interaction. The HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO\u00fe1 of these compounds were drawn Fig. 4 or Fig. S1 . Comparisons of these maps revealed that here HOMO-1 might be an important factor in AHAS inhibition. For 6e22, HOMO-1 covers not only the pyrimidine ring, but also the phenyl ring, whereas for 6e8 and 6e12, the HOMO-1s only distribute in the heterocycle ring (Fig. 4) . This suggests that 6e22 is possible to have more interactions with the enzyme than 6e8 and 6e12 do. However for HOMO, LUMO and LUMO\u00fe1 maps (seen in Fig. S1 ), there are either no obvious differences (HOMO and LUMO\u00fe1), or the difference is in conflict with the known p-p interaction with W574 (LUMO). Based on these thoughts, it is concluded that HOMO-1 is a non-negligible element for the further molecular design of AHAS-inhibiting PTB derivatives.\n\nBecause neither PTB nor its derivative has previously been reported to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro , little is known about the binding mode. Now that we have identified that a lot of the target compounds are good inhibitors of this enzyme and 6e5 even showed very low cellular cytotoxicity, it is interesting to dock the inhibitor to the binding site to investigate the probable mode of action. FlexX is a fast, flexible docking method that uses an incremental construction algorithm to place ligands into an active site [24] , which has been used previously to successfully predict the binding modes of several families of inhibitors [12, 19, 25] . This program was utilized to divine the binding mode in this study. Fig. 5a is a two-dimensional illustration of the interactions between 6e5 and the surrounding residues of SARS-CoV M pro drawn by LIGPLOT [26] . As can be seen, multiple hydrophobic interactions were formed by 6e5 with Thr26, Leu27, Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, His163, Glu166 and His172, while four intermolecular hydrogen bonds could be seen between 6e5 and Asn142, Ser144 and Cys145. Fig. 5b shows the three-dimensional molecular surface of the cavity generated by PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, South San Francisco, CA), and 6e5 adopted a relaxed conformation to inhabit in the cavity. The predicted binding mode has provided meaningful information for design more potent SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors.\n\nPrevious studies on pyrithiobac and its derivatives mostly focused on their herbicidal use. Since thioether compounds are always associated with considerable biological activities, it is necessary to investigate different bioactivities to widen their agricultural or medicinal use. As PTB itself is a highly safe compound towards mammals, compounds with similar structures are expected to have biologically safe property. In this research, a total of 35 PTB derivatives were synthesized and characterized, and this is the first time that such derivatives have been evaluated comprehensively against different bioassays. The target compounds were found to have anti-Candida activity, herbicidal activity, antifungal activity against plant fungi, insecticidal activity, anti-TMV activity and inhibitions against SARS-CoV M pro . As a promising AHAS inhibitor, 6e22 exhibited desirable C. albicans inhibition and potent herbicidal activity. Interestingly, 6e26 displayed potent antifungal activity against plant pathogenic diseases. 6e22 also showed desirable passivation efficacies against TMV. Furthermore, some compound such as 6e5 was identified to be potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro . From a DFT calculation, HOMO-1 might have impact on AHAS inhibitory activity. A feasible binding mode was constructed to explain the interaction of 6e5 with SARS-CoV M pro . Overall, because 6e5 displayed activities from all the bioassays and its cell cytotoxicity data was very low, it is regarded as a lead compound for further molecular design.\n\nThe starting materials were procured from Bejing Ouhe, Shanghai Bide, Shanghai Energy Chemical, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical, Alfa-Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich, TCI and some local chemical suppliers. All solvents and liquid reagents were dried in advance using standard methods and distilled before use. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate was dried and stored in a drying column before use. Melting points were determined using an RT-2 melting apparatus and were uncorrected. 1 H NMR spectra and 13 C NMR were obtained using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shift values (d) for the NMR spectra were reported as parts per million (ppm), using deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3 ) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6 ) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference standard. Mass spectra were recorded on an Ionspect FT-MS 7.0 T LC/mass detector instrument. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on a Bruker Smart 1000 CCD diffractometer. The synthesis of intermediate 2 and 3 is depicted in Scheme 1 and the experimental data are detailed in the supplementary material. The synthesis for target PTB derivatives is shown in Scheme 2 and the experimental details are stated below.\n\nFor the synthesis of 6e1 to 6e13, intermediate 4 (4.5 mmol) was added to the solution of intermediate 2 (3.0 mmol) in 40 mL acetonitrile under stirring, subsequently the reaction proceeded overnight at room temperature in the presence triethylamine (4.5 mmol). The mixture was then vacuumed and the remaining solid was further extracted by using a combination of ethyl acetate and water and the organic layer was kept for further process. The final product was purified by flash column chromatography using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (80:1) and the yields were in the range of 15%e28%.\n\nFor the synthesis of 6e14 to 6e21, intermediate 4 (2.4 mmol), intermediate 3 (1.6 mmol) and sodium methoxide (4.8 mmol) were added to 40 mL methanol. The reaction proceeded for 5 h under reflux and the mixture was then vacuumed to get rid of the solvent. The crude product was further extracted three times by using sodium hydroxide solution and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was then adjusted by hydrochloric acid to a pH value of 3e4. The product was extracted by ethyl acetate and finally purified by flash column chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (80:1) and the yields were in the range of 10%e28%.\n\nFor the synthesis of 6e22 to 6e33, intermediate 5 (4.0 mmol), intermediate 2 or 3 (2.66 mmol) and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (0.3 mmol) were added to 50 mL 90% ethanol. After that the reaction continued for 15 h under reflux and every 2 h the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to >7 by adding saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The crude product was further extracted three times by using sodium hydroxide solution and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was then adjusted by hydrochloric acid to a pH value of 3e4. The product was extracted by ethyl acetate and finally purified by flash column chromatography using dichloromethane/ methanol (80:1) and the yields were in the range of 14%e35%.\n\nFor the synthesis of 6e34 and 6e35, intermediate 4 (5.0 mmol), intermediate 2' (5.0 mmol) and potassium hydroxide (5.0 mmol) was added to 40 mL tetrahydrofuran, after that the reaction proceeded overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then vacuumed and the remaining solid was further extracted by using a combination of ethyl acetate and water and the organic layer was kept. The final product was purified by recrystallization from ethanol and the yields were 47% and 58%. \n\nThe C. albican AHAS catalytic subunit and A. thaliana AHAS catalytic subunit were expressed and purified as describe previously [19, 27] . AHAS activity was measured using the colorimetric assay in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 50 mM pyruvate, 1 mM thiamine diphosphate, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM FAD. After incubation for 30 min at 37 C (for fungal AHAS at 30 C), acetolactate was estimated [28] .\n\nThe Candica albicans strains used in this study include standard strain SC5314, two clinical isolates g5 and 17# and the recipe and procedure for the measurement of antifungal activity is similar with the published method [19, 29] . Yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium and RPMI 1640 medium were both used for the determination whether AHAS is a probable cause of the antifungal data. The microdilution plates were incubated at 35 C over a period of 72 h and visual readings of the cultures were taken at 24 h. MICs were defined as the lowest concentrations of the compounds that can inhibit visible fungal growth.\n\nThe rape (Brassica campestris L.) root growth inhibition assay was detailed before [27] . Rape seeds were soaked in distilled water for 4 h before they were placed on a filter paper in a 6-cm Petri plate, to which 2 mL of inhibitor solution had been added in advance. Usually, 15 seeds were used on each plate. The plate was placed in a dark room and allowed to germinate for 48 h at 28 C. The lengths of 10 rape roots selected from each plate were measured and the means were calculated.\n\nThe pre-emergence and post-emergence greenhouse pot herbicidal activities were evaluated against monocotyledonous weeds (Echinochloacrus-galli and Digitaria adscendens) and dicotyledonous weeds (Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexus) using methods reported previously [30] .\n\nThe fungicidal activities of the target compounds were tested against S. sclerotiorum, P. capsici, P. piricola, R. cerealis, W. anthracnose and R. bakanae, the method of which was described previously [31] . The relative inhibitory ratio (%) was determined by the mycelium growth rate method at 50 mg/L concentration. Chlorothalonil and PTB were used as controls. The EC 50 values of selected compounds against R. cerealis were calculated by equation (1) [27] .\n\nProbit \u00bc m(log 10 [I]-log 10 [EC 50 ])\u00fe5\n\n(1)\n\nThe insecticidal activity of title compounds and rynaxypyr against oriental armyworm (Mythimna separata) was tested according to the leaf-dip method using the reported procedure at 600 mg/L dose [32] .\n\nTMV was inhibited by mixing with the compound solution at the same volume for 30 min. The mixture was then inoculated on the left side of the leaves of N. tabacum L., whereas the right side of the leaves was inoculated with the mixture of solvent and the virus for control. The local lesion numbers were recorded 3e4 days after inoculation, as reported previously [33] . The inactivation effect was evaluated at 500 mg/L or 100 mg/L.\n\nSARS-CoV M pro was expressed and purified previously [34] , and the inhibition assay was detailed before by us [12] . Briefly, the assays were conducted by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The settled concentrations of proteins, compounds and substrate were preheated at 37 C and oscillated. The excitation/emission light was 320/405 nm, and the test was carried out every 5 s for 200 times. IC 50 values for selected compounds were calculated by equation (2) . 50 (2) 4.3.8. Cytotoxicity assay for the determination of CC 50 MTT assay was employed to test the cytotoxic effect of selected compounds, which is similar to a published procedure [35] . 293 T Cells in logarithmic phase were collected and moved to 96microwell plates (12000 cells/well) overnight. After treatment of 48 h with various concentrations of compounds, 15 mL MTT dye was added to each well, followed by incubating for an additional 4 h.\n\nThe suspension was discarded and 100 mL DMSO was added to each well, after that OD 570 was read. CC 50 value was defined as the concentration of the compound reducing cell viabilityby 50%.\n\nSybyl 7.3 (Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO) was used to construct the chemical structures for the molecular simulations. The crystal structure of 6e6 was regarded as the starting conformation of the investigated compounds. The molecules were assigned Gasteiger-H\u00fcckel charges and minimized by the Tripos force field when convergence reached 0.001 kcal/mol/\u00c5.\n\nRepresentative compounds 6e6, 6e12 and 6e22 were chosen for DFT geometry optimization by the SCF method using the B3LYP function with a basis set of 6-31G(d, p) to describe their molecular properties. Gaussian03 was used to perform the calculations [36] . The optimized molecular structures by Sybyl were used as the initial conformations. All computations were conducted for the ground states of these molecules as singlet states. All of the convergent precisions used were the system's default values.\n\nThe crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with inhibitor (pdb code 2AMD) was retrieved from the protein databank. All water molecules were removed, and hydrogen atoms were added in the standard geometry. Any amino acid residue within 6.5 \u00c5 of the location of the original inhibitor was considered to be in the binding pocket. Cscore calculation was enabled and set to serial mode."}
