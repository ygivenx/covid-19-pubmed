Messenger RNAs (~190 nt) were derived from plasmid pEMC-PK or -SL and contained the minimal IBV pseudoknot 23 or related stem-loop structure 23 respectively. In vitro translations were carried out using nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL; Promega). The relevant mRNA transcript (300pmole) was annealed to a chimeric biotinylated DNA/2' O-allyl modified RNA oligonucleotide (5' TbTbTbCAGAUCUAUUAAGAGCGGUCGGTbTbTb 3'; 800pmol) in a 10\u00b5l reaction containing 20mM Tris pH 7.5, 4mM MgCl2 and 100mM KCl for 5 min at 68\u00b0C, 4 min at 37\u00b0C and 10 min on ice. The mRNA/oligonucleotide complex was added to 2.4ml of RRL and translation allowed to proceed for 15 min at 27\u00b0C prior to addition of cycloheximide (to 1mM). The translation reaction was diluted to 4 ml with HMCK buffer (25mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.8, 5mM MgOAc, 1mM cycloheximide, 150mM KOAc), loaded onto a cushion of sucrose (10ml 34% sucrose in HMCK), centrifuged at 440,000g for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C and the pellet resuspended gently in 900\u00b5l HMCK. A 1ml (settled bed volume) aliquot of avidin resin (SoftLink, Promega) was preadsorbed with biotin (10mM) and tRNA (100\u00b5g).\n\nSubsequently, the resin was preadsorbed with unprogrammed RRL (1ml) and BSA (1mg) before addition of the sucrose-purified ribosomes. After 30 min, the resin was washed (four times with 1 ml HMCK), removed from the column, collected by centrifugation (13,000g, 1 min) and resuspended in 250\u00b5l HMCK containing 1nmole of a DNA oligonucleotide (5'ATTCTTGTTGAATCATTCAG 3') complementary to mRNA sequences 3' of the pseudoknot/stem-loop. After incubation, mRNA/ribosome complexes were released from the SoftLink resin by addition of 30U RNaseH (Promega). The resin was pelleted (13,000g, 1 min), the supernatant retained and respun to remove all traces of resin. Ribosomes, final concentration 5 OD260/ml, were aliquoted and frozen at -70\u00b0C prior to cryo-EM.\n\nCryo-electron microscopy and image processing. Samples were blotted onto holey carboncoated copper mesh microscope grids and vitrified by plunging into liquid ethane. Images were captured using a 200 kV Phillips CM200 FEG electron microscope under low dose conditions and at a range of defocus values. The micrographs were scanned using a UMAX PowerLook 3000 scanner on an 8.322 \u00b5m raster and then interpolated to 16.64 micron, providing a pixel size at the specimen of 3.33A. Particles were excised and CTF-corrected using EMAN 31 . 80S Apo particles were subjected to ab initio structure determination using angular reconstitution in IMAGIC 24 . Once initial maps were obtained, they were refined iteratively in SPIDER 25 by projection matching. The 80S Apo was used as the alignment template for the stalled ribosome images, again by projection matching in SPIDER. Once initial reconstructions of the stalled ribosomes were generated, several rounds of iterative refinement followed. Alignments in SPIDER were initially on a 15\u00ba grid, iteratively refined to 5\u00ba. Reconstructions were improved during this process by using a cross-correlation function between each particle image and the corresponding reconstruction to select the best 50% of each set, and by three-way alignment with ranking by correlation coefficient. Next, local alignment procedures 32 were employed down to an angular spacing of 1\u00ba and maps were produced by weighting the contribution of individual particle images by the correlation coefficient calculated for them to the alignment model within a mask defined by the common presence of a P-site tRNA in both stalled reconstructions. Finally, pairwise alignment of each image of the 80S PK and 80S SL samples was carried out, each being aligned to the current-best model for that sample and to the 80S Apo reconstruction. Images of 80S PK or 80S SL complexes were judged to be fully occupied if their correlation coefficient within a mask defined either by the P-site tRNA, eEF2 and pseudoknot (for 80S PK ) or by the P-site tRNA (for 80S SL ) was greater when correlated to the current-best complex map than to the 80S Apo map; 12,161 out of 17,672 images of 80S PK and 9,805 out of 14,887 images of 80S SL were in this manner selected. Use of these selected images subsequently produced reconstructions in which tRNAs, eEF2 and pseudoknot displayed full and equal occupancy. The 80S Apo map incorporated 10,296 images. The final data were divided into halves and compared using Fourier shell correlation (FSC) to give resolutions of 14.0 \u00c5 (80S Apo ), 15.7 \u00c5 (80S SL ) and 16.2 \u00c5 (80S PK ) at the FSC 0.5 cutoff. Maps were scaled in reciprocal space to evenly-spaced scattering centres computed within the unscaled maps, as previously described (programmes"}
