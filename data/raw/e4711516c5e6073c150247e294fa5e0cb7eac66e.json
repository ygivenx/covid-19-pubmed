Physical examination often reveals effusions. Estimation of skin turgor and thickness of lip folds, conjunctiva, and tarsal webs detects localized edema or whole-body edema (i.e., anasarca). Some effusions can be difficult to recognize without diagnostic imaging (radiographic or ultrasonographic). Abdominal effusion can be missed during palpation (balloting a fluid wave has poor predictive value). Small volumes of pleural fluid usually escape physical detection. In almost all cases, analysis of the fluid causing the effusion is crucial to proper categorization and determination of cause.\n\nCollection of Fluid \u2022 The puncture site is prepared as for aseptic surgery. A 1-inch, 23-to 20-gauge needle, over-the-needle Teflon catheter, or butterfly needle-catheter is recommended. Fluid analysis usually requires 3 to 5 ml. If ultrasound guidance is used, the clinician should prevent sample contamination with ultrasound gel that induces artifacts (i.e., blue-appearing smudges on Diff-Quik or Wright's Giemsa-stained preparations).\n\nAbdominocentesis \u2022 The abdomen is palpated immediately before abdominocentesis to avoid lacerating visceral structures. The urinary bladder should be emptied before abdominocentesis, particularly when 14-gauge catheters are used. In patients with tense abdominal distention, the abdomen is punctured laterally (to avoid gravitational ventral midline seroma formation). If septic peritonitis is suspected but unproven with routine abdominocentesis, a four-quadrant tap is performed. When fluid is difficult to collect, ultrasonographic guidance is helpful. Usually a 22-to 20-gauge, 1-inch needle or Teflon catheter is attached to extension tubing. Extension tube length helps avoid visceral laceration should the patient move during the procedure.\n\nAlternatively, a butterfly catheter is used. If the effusion is difficult to sample, a 14-gauge Teflon catheter is used to puncture the abdomen, and a closed-ended polypropylene Tomcat catheter inserted through its lumen. The Teflon catheter provides a \"sterile stent\" through which the Tomcat catheter may be manipulated as the patient's position is altered.\n\nAbdominal Lavage \u2022 Sterile warmed physiologic saline (20 ml/kg) is administered intraperitoneally over 5 to 10 minutes through extension tubing and a Teflon catheter. The abdomen is massaged or the animal moved about for several minutes to mix this fluid with that trapped within omental recesses and abdominal gutters. Lavage fluid is subsequently aspirated and analyzed. Dogs normally have less than 500 white blood cells (WBCs)/\u00b5l. Mild leukocytosis occurs after recent abdominal trauma or surgery. Diagnostic guidelines for interpretation of abdominal lavage fluid are listed in Table 10 -1. Iatrogenic injury and bacterial contamination are possible consequences of lavage. Dilutional influences on the collected fluid can create diagnostic confusion.\n\nThoracocentesis \u2022 It is usually performed in the seventh or eight intercostal space at the level of the costochondral junction; however, relevant imaging studies may better guide sample collection. The needle penetrates the middle of the intercostal space, avoiding the caudal rib margin where the nerves and vessels are located. Harvesting fluid is optimal with the animal standing or in sternal recumbency. A 1-inch, 18-or 20-gauge butterfly catheter connected to a three-way stopcock and a 20-to 35-ml syringe are recommended. During initial needle placement, negative pressure is maintained on the syringe so that advancement of the needle immediately discloses effusion, thus avoiding inadvertent pulmonary puncture or laceration. Repeated centesis should be performed after a local anesthetic block is applied to the puncture site.\n\nPericardiocentesis \u2022 The catheter is usually passed through the fifth or sixth right intercostal space (i.e., the cardiac notch between lung lobes). Local anesthetic is injected to the level of the pleura. A 12-to 16-gauge, 4-to 6-inch over-the-needle Teflon catheter with two or three extra holes aseptically snipped in the lateral aspect is used. Extension tubing and a three-way stopcock are necessary in medium-and large-sized dogs. The site of thoracic penetration is surgically prepared, and a small incision is made to facilitate movement of the catheter through the dermis. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is simultaneously recorded while the catheter is advanced; touching the myocardium elicits premature ventricular beats. Entrance into the pericardium may require an acute thrust. The catheter is slipped over the needle into the pericardial sac, and the needle discarded. If bloody fluid is extracted, the clinician should immediately compare packed cell volume (PCV), number of platelets, total solid concentration, supernatant color, and activated clotting time between fluid and peripheral blood. Comparison avoids inadvertent removal of large volumes of intracardiac blood.\n\n\u2022 A 22-to 25-gauge needle is gently introduced into affected tissues. Fluid often drains spontaneously by gravity but can be assisted by gentle massage or aspiration.\n\nFluid Analysis \u2022 Collected fluids should be analyzed immediately to permit its If the fluid appears relatively acellular, a portion should be centrifuged and smears made of the sediment as soon as possible. Cytospin centrifugation provides the best cellular morphology. Cytology smears should be rapidly air-dried to preserve cell morphology. The clinician should remain alert for microorganism-contaminated stains, post-sampling degeneration of neutrophils associated with prolonged storage in EDTA or saline, or cell changes induced by exposure to urine or bile.\n\nPure transudates are associated with low oncotic pressure, increased hydrostatic pressure, and sometimes-increased vascular permeability. These are poorly cellular (i.e., < 1000 cells/\u00b5l), have total solids less than 2.5 g/dl, and a specific gravity less than 1.017. Classic examples are abdominal effusions caused by hypoalbuminemia resulting from hepatic insufficiency, protein-losing nephropathy (PLN), and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE).\n\nModified transudates are associated with a higher total solids concentration than pure transudates (generally 2.5 g/dl), a specific gravity less than 1.017, and moderate cellularity. Mesothelial cells are usually plentiful, and the other cellular components highly variable. \n\nHemorrhagic effusions appear bloody, have a measurable hematocrit, and have total solids greater than 3.0 g/dl. If chronic, the supernatant evidences hemolysis or xanthochromia, and cytologic inspection reveals erythrophagocytosis, siderocytes, and a lack of platelets. These effusions do not clot. Platelets appear only when bleeding has occurred within approximately 1 hour of sampling. Peracute or iatrogenic hemorrhage has no erythrophagocytosis or siderocytes, supernatant is clear, and platelets are expected.\n\nExudates are characterized by high total solid concentration (i.e., > 3.0 g/dl), high specific gravity (i.e., > 1.025), and increased cellularity dominated by neutrophils and macrophages (i.e., > 5000 cells/\u00b5l). These effusions may be septic or nonseptic. Inflammatory, necrotizing, infectious, or malignant disorders can be responsible. Exudative effusions should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically. One should immediately determine cytologically whether an effusion is exudative or not to prioritize the importance of culture.\n\nBilious effusions contain intracellular and extracellular bilirubin crystals (yellow, golden, or brownish material). Large numbers of neutrophils that may be highly segmented and reactive mesothelial cells are common. Bacteria may be visible. Comparing fluid bilirubin concentration to peripheral blood values (the former will be higher) is diagnostic. Jaundiced animals develop yellow-colored effusions.\n\nChylous effusions usually have total solid concentrations greater than 2.5 g/dl; specific gravity greater than 1.018; high numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or both; and a triglyceride concentration exceeding peripheral blood values. The fluid:serum triglyceride ratio is greater than 2 to 3:1 and commonly exceeds 10:1. Effusion cholesterol concentration is typically less than peripheral blood cholesterol. When centrifuged, chylous effusions have lactescent or opalescent supernatants. A buoyant, triglyceride-rich chylomicron layer accumulates at the surface upon sample refrigeration. A qualitative test for high triglyceride content involves incubation of the effusion pretreated with 1 to 2 drops of 1 N sodium hydroxide, with an equal volume of ether. Ether-soluble triglycerides rise to the top of the tube as a white band. Alternatively a wet mount of fluid may be stained with oil red O or Sudan black and subsequently evaluated for fat droplets (i.e., chylomicrons) (see Color Plate 5B).\n\nPseudochylous effusions described in the older veterinary literature are extremely rare; they have high cholesterol and low triglyceride concentrations relative to peripheral blood.\n\nMalignant effusions are usually modified transudates or exudates, often blood-tinged and xanthochromic, and are diagnosed by finding neoplastic cells. Caution: Reactive mesothelial cells are often misinterpreted as malignant (e.g., binucleated cells, signet ring-shaped cells similar to carcinoma cells, high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, large and variably sized nucleus and nucleoli). Immunohistochemical distinction of cell type has become an important diagnostic evaluation in human medicine and is just developing in veterinary medicine. So far, however, no tumor marker has a spectrum wide enough to detect all types of malignancies and cannot consistently differentiate between reactive or hyperplastic mesothelial cells and adenocarcinoma cells that can resemble one another. Hemangiosarcomas commonly cause malignant effusion in dogs. These effusions contain large numbers of foamy macrophages, mesothelial cells, and erythrophagocytes; are xanthochromic; lack platelets; and are usually accompanied by acanthocytes and schistocytes (see Chapters 2 and 3) in peripheral blood. Often they produce hemorrhagic effusions without evidence of neoplasia. Carcinomatosis (i.e., miliary tumors implanted on peritoneal or pleural surfaces) frequently causes effusions. Radiography discloses ill-defined serosal margins, and ultrasonography discerns small fluid volume. Some lesions may be large enough for aspiration biopsy. These effusions have a high specific gravity, large amounts of protein, and so many RBCs that they are occasionally classified as hemorrhagic.\n\nFluid Accumulation Disorders 251 Cytology may reveal neoplastic cells; however, it is easy to confuse reactive mesothelial cells with neoplastic cells. Particularly vexing is diagnosis of mesotheliomas, which often requires tissue sampling for definitive diagnosis.\n\nEosinophilic effusions contain greater than 10% eosinophils. Approximately 50% of these effusions are modified transudates and the remainder nonseptic exudates. These effusions cannot be predicted from circulating eosinophil counts. Canine eosinophilic pleural effusions may be associated with heartworm disease, disseminated eosinophilic granulomatosis, systemic mastocytosis, interstitial pneumonia, lymphoma, and hemangiosarcoma. Radiographically apparent infiltrates are common. Pneumothorax can precede development of eosinophilic pleural effusion.\n\nClinicians need to be familiar with diagnostic considerations in animals with suspected abdominal effusion ( Figure 10 -1). Pure transudates are typically associated with severe hypoalbuminemia (see Chapter 12; Figure 10 -2) and are usually caused by PLN, PLE, hepatic failure, protein loss from exudative cutaneous lesions, or repeated body cavity lavage. Anorexia and emaciation alone do not produce hypoalbuminemia severe enough to elicit edema or effusion. Check for pathologic proteinuria (see Chapter 7) and hepatic insufficiency (see the discussion of bile acids in Chapter 9). Remember: PLE may occur without signs of enteric disease; enteric biopsy may be needed for diagnosis. Serum cholesterol concentration (see Chapter 8) is helpful; PLE and hepatic failure usually cause hypocholesterolemia, whereas PLN usually causes hypercholesterolemia. Involvement of portal hypertension as a pathomechanism of abdominal effusion can be discerned by measuring the serum albumin-effusion albumin (SA-EA) gradient; values greater than 1.1 suggest portal hypertension. However, considerable overlapping of SA-EA gradients occurs such that values cannot distinguish the definitive underlying cause (liver disease versus no liver disease).\n\nModified transudates are usually associated with increased venous (capillary) hydrostatic pressure (see Figure 10 -2). Concurrent hepatomegaly suggests impaired blood flow at the level of the hepatic venules, vena cava craniad to the diaphragm, pericardium, right atrium, or pulmonary arterial bed. The clinician should look for jugular pulse, pulsus paradoxus, hepatojugular reflex, weak femoral pulses, muffled cardiac sounds, exercise intolerance, and physiologically inappropriate tachycardia, which might indicate pericardial tamponade. Hepatojugular reflex is elicited by applying gentle abdominal compression to liver or cranial abdomen for 10 to 15 seconds (increases venous return to the heart) and seeing jugular vein distention or pulsation (indicating reduced right heart function or filling). Hepatomegaly caused by venous congestion may be difficult to palpate because of abdominal distention or patient conformation.\n\nThoracic radiographs evaluate the shape and size of the cardiac and pericardial silhouette; the tortuosity and filling of the pulmonary arterial bed; and the shape, distention, and position of the vena cava. If cardiomegaly is present, ultrasonographic evaluation differentiates cardiac from pericardial disease. Abdominal ultrasonography (Doppler color flow enhances evaluation) may reveal distended hepatic veins and an exaggerated flow pattern because of outflow obstruction, abdominal masses (i.e., neoplasia, granuloma), or thrombi obstructing portal blood flow. Central venous pressure (CVP) values greater than 8 cm H 2 O are suggestive, and values greater than or equal to 14 cm H 2 O are diagnostic of right-sided cardiac dysfunction, filling, or impaired flow of blood into the lungs (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, thromboembolism). CVP does not detect venous hypertension caused by disease caudal to the heart and may be hazardous in patients with bleeding tendencies (e.g., hepatic insufficiency, rodenticide toxicity, vasculitis, thrombocytopenia). CVP may be normal in dogs with cor triatriatum dexter (abnormal congenital occlusive webbing within the right atrium). CVP is subject to many mechanical variables (e.g., catheter end position; kinking, folding, occlusion) necessitating CVP interpretation with other diagnostic assessments.\n\nModified transudates due to chronic hepatic disease can develop before severe hypoalbuminemia occurs if the animal has sinusoidal or venous hypertension. Pooling of albumin in the ascites of these patients promotes hypoalbuminemia. Abdominal ultrasonography usually discloses microhepatia, or irregular lobe margins or altered parenchymal 252 Small Animal Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods echogenicity, or distended abdominal portal vasculature, or splenic congestion, or tortuous portosystemic shunts, or a combination of these. Modified transudates also develop because of fibrosis in the porta hepatis, neoplasia occluding the portal vasculature, or portal venous thromboembolism. The S:E albumin gradient is greater than or equal to 1.1 in these cases. Splenic infarction, thromboembolism, or torsion may produce a modified transudate or exudate. Portions or the entire spleen may appear enlarged. Splenic abnormalities are usually discovered by ultrasonographic evaluation with color flow Doppler. Further definition requires contrast portography or exploratory laparotomy. Abdominal masses (i.e., neoplasia, granulomas) may also be responsible for modified transudates; these are usually detected by ultrasonography.\n\nEffusions generally make radiographs less useful than ultrasonography. An effusion may be evacuated and radiographs repeated after drainage to determine hepatic size, the presence of abdominal masses, or changes in visceral positions. Visceral margins remain ill defined, however, because all the fluid cannot be aspirated, and effusions often reaccumulate within hours to days. Repeated fluid removal will further compromise serum albumin concentrations.\n\nExudates mandate searching for infection. Finding phagocytized organisms in neutrophils or macrophages is definitive but may require careful, tedious inspection of a cytology smear. Plant fibers, enteric debris, or a mixed \"fecal flora\" are consistent with gut rupture. Degenerate WBCs (see Chapter 16 and Color Plate 4B) suggest infection, although some organisms do not alter neutrophil morphology (e.g., Actinomyces) (see Color Plates 4A to 4C). Degenerate changes may be the result of specimen handling. Recent abdominal trauma (e.g., exploratory laparotomy) causes mild, transient fluid neutrophilia with neutrophilic degeneration. Finding and identifying infecting organisms can be difficult, especially when bacterial numbers are low or bacteria are within a granulomatous reaction or abscess. Certain organisms are notoriously difficult to find (e.g., Nocardia and Actinomyces). Therefore all exudative effusions should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically (see Chapter 15), and samples should be immediately submitted in sterile clot tubes or transferred to appropriate transport media. If samples in transport media cannot be immediately submitted, they should be refrigerated to slow bacterial growth to avoid media substrate use and microbe death. Finding irrefutable evidence of an infectious organism is almost always an indication for emergency exploratory surgery. Animals with probable abdominal contamination caused by recent surgery, repeated drainage, or fluid sampling are exceptions; in these cases, cultures are submitted and antimicrobial therapy tailored to the identified organisms.\n\nExudates without cytologic evidence of sepsis necessitate reviewing history for trauma and possible urinary, biliary, or cyst rupture (Table 10 -3). Intraabdominal inflammation can persist for weeks after blunt abdominal trauma. Radiography of bony structures sometimes reveals injury. If trauma is unlikely, physical examination is reviewed for other sites of inflammation. In cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) must be considered. Although clinical presentations are variable, most cats with FIP are chronically ill with systemic signs, hyperglobulinemia (i.e., \u2265 .5 g/dl), and a high-protein abdominal effusion (i.e., > 4.5 g/dl). Cytology reveals variable nucleated cell counts with mixed inflammation. Inconsistencies in the signs and clinical pathologic findings in FIP (see Chapter 15) make conclusive diagnosis impossible in cats with atypical features (e.g., long-term survival, modified transudative effusions) without tissue immunohistochemistry. Serologic PCR of coronavirus is not a definitive diagnostic test. Other considerations are summarized in Figure 10 -1.\n\nNeoplasia becomes an important differential for modified transudates or exudates after eliminating other differentials. Neoplastic cells are sometimes identified cytologically; however, there are typically few or no exfoliated neoplastic cells found in small volume samples. Cytospin preparation or examination of centrifuged fluid sediment increases the chance of finding malignant cells. Sometimes neoplastic cells are only found after collection and centrifugation of large fluid volumes (e.g., > 50 ml). Remember: Reactive mesothelial cells resemble carcinoma cells. Ultrasonography can aid in aspiration of mass lesions.\n\nChylous abdominal effusions usually suggest intestinal lymphangiectasia; lymphoproliferative disease of the gut, mesenteric lymphatics, or lymph nodes; or they may suggest intraabdominal neoplasia \"strangulating\" the mesenteric root. Vitamin E-responsive steatitis and biliary cirrhosis have accompanied Fluid Accumulation Disorders feline chyloabdomen (see Figure 10 -1). Lymphocytes are the initial cell type found, but with chronicity a neutrophilic inflammation predominates. Repeated aspiration of chylous effusions depletes protein (i.e., chyle contains 1 to 6 g protein/dl), which potentiates subsequent fluid accumulation. Secondary infections are rare because of the bacteriostatic effect of chyle. Animals with chyloabdomen require thoracic radiographs to look for pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, or metastatic neoplasia. Ultrasonography may reveal mesenteric root masses or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.\n\nHemoabdomen may be associated with trauma (e.g., ruptured spleen or hepatic parenchyma; avulsed renal pedicle or mesenteric vessels), vascular neoplasia (e.g., hemangiosarcoma, other vascular tumors or tumors with necrotic centers), feline hepatic amyloidosis, or coagulopathies (see Chapter 5; Figure 10 -3). Physical examination usually reveals abrasions or pain in traumatized animals. Inspection for petechia (including fundic examination), rectal and fecal examination for melena and hematochezia, palpation for hemarthrosis (i.e., swollen, painful joints), and urinalysis looking for hematuria help identify coagulopathies. Without historic or physical findings suggesting trauma, a complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation profile become essential. PCV reveals whether the erythron mass is reduced if there has been time for fluid redistribution and RBC regeneration.\n\nSamples must be obtained before initiating fluid therapy. Schistocytes and acanthocytes (see Chapters 2 and 3) suggest microangiopathic damage because of vascular neoplasia (e.g., hemangiosarcoma) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Scanning a blood smear should detect thrombocytopenia severe enough to cause hemorrhage (see Chapter 5). Severe acute hemorrhage not caused by thrombocytopenia initially increases the platelet count. An activated coagulation time (ACT) and buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT) (see Chapter 5) detect many hemostatic defects. Thoracic radiographs may reveal pleural fluid, lymphadenopathy (e.g., sternal lymph node), or frank metastasis. Pleural fluid, if present, must be sampled. Ultrasonography may find vascular tumors, usually associated with hepatic or splenic hematomas, and occasionally reveals the site of active bleeding. Animals with persistent or vigorous abdominal hemorrhage may require blood volume replacement, hemoglobin infusion, empiric vitamin K1 treatment, (0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [SC] or intramuscularly [IM] ) and often laparotomy if hemostatic defects have been eliminated.\n\nBilious effusions caused by gallbladder or common bile duct rupture may derive from blunt abdominal trauma, necrotizing cholecystitis or choledochitis, or cholelithiasis. Biliary tree perforation may be immediate or delayed after blunt or surgical injury (see Table 10 -3). Affected animals usually have low-grade abdominal pain, lethargy, fever, jaundice, and abdominal effusion. Pale or acholic feces indicate deviation of bile from the intestines. Serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transferase (AST) activities are invariably increased. The appearance and severity of jaundice depends on the underlying cause and chronicity of biliary tree rupture. Initially there may be large volumes of fluid with few clinical signs. Exposure of cell membranes to bile acids and lysolecithin promotes the transmural migration of enteric microbes causing peritonitis. Sometimes focal bile peritonitis is contained by the omentum. If a pocket of fluid is found ultrasonographically, it can be aspirated using a spinal needle to confirm the diagnosis. A ruptured gallbladder may not be well visualized ultrasonographically. Diffuse bile peritonitis is usually cytologically obvious: high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages plus free and engulfed bile. The specimen is usually golden-brown or golden-green, and the fluid Fluid Accumulation Disorders 257 FIGURE 10-3. Diagnostic considerations in animals with hemoabdomen or hemothorax. ACT, Activated clotting time; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; CBC, complete blood count; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; FIP, feline infectious peritonitis; PIVKA, proteins induced by vitamin K absence; PT, prothrombin time. is turbid. Higher bilirubin concentration in the effusion than in serum is common, but this determination is usually unnecessary for diagnosis. Fluid samples for accurate diagnosis of bile peritonitis are collected from the immediate area of leakage. Uroabdomen occurs when urine leaks and pools in the peritoneal cavity. Affected animals sometimes have apparently normal voiding (e.g., a single ruptured ureter; a bladder avulsion when a fibrous tract permits voiding into the urethral lumen). Avulsion of a ureter at the renal pedicle causes retroperitoneal fluid accumulation. Trauma is the major cause, but cystocentesis or neoplasia may be responsible. The degree of azotemia varies; if virtually all urine produced accumulates in the abdomen, rapid onset of azotemia is expected. Most patients develop a vaguely painful abdomen, lethargy, fever, and dehydration. Markedly increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations, hyperphosphatemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis are expected. The effusion is slightly turbid, blood-tinged, and yellow. Fluid creatinine concentration is markedly higher than peripheral blood creatinine. No substantial difference is found in the fluid and serum urea nitrogen concentrations because of the very small size of the urea molecule and dispersion in body water. An intravenous (IV) urogram (followed by a retrograde urethral cystogram, if necessary) locates the damaged area. Urinary drainage and abdominal lavage rapidly corrects electrolyte and acid-base derangements.\n\nPancreatitis sometimes causes diffuse peritonitis and copious effusion. Clinical pathologic changes are discussed in Chapter 9; ultrasonography is usually diagnostic in dogs. Effusions are grossly turbid and sometimes have a lipid surface interface after refrigeration and centrifugation. Inflammation is characterized by large numbers of neutrophils and macrophages; the latter often contain many small to large clear or refractile vacuoles (probably engulfed lipid). Pancreatic enzyme activity in the effusion (i.e., lipase) can markedly exceed values measured in peripheral blood.\n\nRuptured \"cystic\" lesions in the liver, kidneys, pancreas, or prostate occasionally cause abdominal effusion (see Figure 10 -1). Fluid located within large cysts is sometimes misidentified as free abdominal effusion. Cystic fluid is evaluated for underlying malignancy or infection. Polycystic hepatic or renal disease is more common in cats (i.e., Persians, Himalayans). Hepatic and renal cysts may contain serous fluid or, more rarely, fluid contaminated with bile or urine, respectively. Perirenal pseudocysts are more common in cats, especially older males. Although rare, pancreatic cysts may be benign, represent post-pancreatitis abscessation, or be the result of malignancy (i.e., pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration is the least invasive and most cost-effective method of determining if resection or drainage is needed. Paraprostatic or prostatic cysts may become exceedingly large. Examination of cystic fluid is important to eliminate infection or neoplasia. If perirectal cysts are identified and the clinician is unsure of urinary bladder position, the urinary bladder should be decompressed with a catheter; cyst fluid should then be aspirated and analyzed for creatinine.\n\nThe general approach to differential diagnosis of pleural effusion is similar to that described for abdominal effusions (Figure 10-4) . The pleura is not as readily accessible by exploratory surgery and is less easily visualized by ultrasonography, however. Animals with pleural effusion often have rapid, shallow breathing with accentuated abdominal effort. Radiographs should include right lateral and ventrodorsal views. Radiographically, pleural fluid is characterized as either free (will move upon patient repositioning) or encapsulated (nonmovable with positional changes).\n\nPure transudates are less common in the pleural space than in the abdomen (Figure 10-5) . These effusions signal severe hypoalbuminemia and thoracic vascular hypertension. Pure transudates also occur in animals overhydrated with crystalloid solutions. Overhydration causing pleural and pulmonary fluid retention occurs most commonly with incipient cardiac disease (e.g., asymptomatic cardiomyopathy).\n\nModified transudates are the most common type of pleural effusion (see Figure 10 -5). Obstructive effusions can be serous to serosanguineous, have a specific gravity from 1.015 to 1.040, and total solid concentrations greater than or equal to 2.5 g/dl. Cellularity is usually mixed with RBCs, lymphocytes, and fewer neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and mesothelial cells. These effusions eventually become modified with a more 258 Small Animal Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods \n\nThoracocentesis (see Table 10 -2) Table 10 -4) Overhydration (see Figure 10- Figure 10-6 inflammatory appearance. Physical examination may disclose underlying disease (e.g., gallop rhythm, cardiac murmur, loss of normal compression of the anterior chest in cats with an enlarged heat or mediastinal mass). Trauma plus a vague \"emptiness\" of the abdomen and auscultation of borborygmi in the thorax suggests diaphragmatic hernia; dogs with right-sided cardiac failure usually develop ascites, and cats often form pleural effusion with cardiac failure. Benign or neoplastic pericardial effusion, constrictive or restrictive pericarditis, and right atrial hemangiosarcoma cause pleural effusion associated with pericardial tamponade in dogs. Occasionally, animals with a cranial mediastinal mass and associated pleural effusion have cranial vena cava syndrome (i.e., submandibular edema, jugular engorgement and pulses, injection of the conjunctival blood vessels indicating impaired cranial venous return, lymphatic return, or both). Thymomas, thymic cysts, lymphoma, invasive thyroid adenocarcinoma, and jugular thrombosis are the most common causes of this syndrome. Thoracic radiography should be performed before thoracocentesis to minimize the possibility of iatrogenic lung laceration, to disclose cardiomegaly (suggesting cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion), and to detect gas entrapped within visceral structures (i.e., diaphragmatic hernia) or abscess. Removing the effusion followed by radiography may permit identification of masses and consolidated lung lobes. Thoracic ultrasonography is enhanced by voluminous thoracic effusion; ultrasound-guided aspiration of masses may provide a definitive diagnosis. Most animals require sedation before needletargeted thoracic sampling of lesions deeper than the peripheral pleural space. Thoracic exudates (Figure 10-6 ; see Figure 10 -4) necessitate cytologic examination for infectious organisms. Pasteurella multocida is the most common reported aerobic isolate. Actinomyces and Nocardia are often found in dogs. Multiple bacterial species are common in feline pyothorax. Septic exudates typically are turbid, cream-colored, or seropurulent and contain degenerate WBCs with or without multiple bacterial forms. Exudates associated with pure Actinomyces infection may have minimal or no WBC degeneration; dual infections with Nocardia are common, and mixed populations of organisms may be found in thick or thin red-brown exudates containing degenerate WBCs and \"sulfur granules.\" Including colored flecks from the exudate on smears improves cytologic visualization of actinomycosis-nocardiosis. These organisms are presumptively diagnosed when beaded, branching filaments (Color Plates 4B and 4C) are found. Most Nocardia spp. stain acid fast with a modified acid-fast stain; Actinomyces spp. do not. Both organisms produce exudates containing sulfur granules, but only Actinomyces produces these within tissue. Thoracic radiography in animals with pyothorax may disclose pulmonary parenchymal involvement. Effusions persist as long as a chest tube is retained. Sequential evaluation of cytologic specimens can be used to estimate patient response to treatment and guide the propriety of tube removal.\n\nNonseptic exudates with a hemorrhagic component are associated with lung lobe torsion (suggested by radiographic evidence of malpositioned main stem bronchi, persistence of entrapped air within bronchi of twisted lobes, and prolific fluid production). Bronchoscopy may reveal a twisted-off bronchus. Ultrasonography may assist by evaluating lobe perfusion. Nonseptic exudates also are associated with idiopathic pleuritis, infectious pneumonia (e.g., mycoplasmic pneumonia), and various tumors. FIP can cause pyogranulomatous pleural effusion that is light yellow, viscous, and has a high protein concentration. A background of proteinaceous material is commonly observed on fluid cytology.\n\nThoracic neoplasia often induces pleural effusion; the most common is mediastinal lymphoma. In dogs, lymphocytes are usually the predominate cell; these may lack overt malignant characteristics. Aspiration of mediastinal masses or lymph nodes or other more accessible enlarged nodes may be diagnostic. In cats, exfoliated lymphoblasts are common. It is important to differentiate thymomas from lymphoma, because the former may have a better prognosis; this may require tissue sampling. Malignant or benign thymic cysts also may cause pleural effusion. Mesotheliomas pose a great diagnostic challenge; definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy.\n\nHemorrhage is usually caused by trauma. Radiographs often reveal rib fractures, pulmonary consolidation, lung lobe torsion, or pneumothorax. Nontraumatic hemorrhagic pleural effusions are usually the result of bleeding neoplasia; however, coagulopathy also must be considered (e.g., minor trauma can cause substantial bleeding in dogs with severe von Willebrand's disease or vitamin-K depletion from warfarin-like rodenticides; see Chapter 5). Other nontraumatic causes of hemothorax include lung lobe torsion, pulmonary abscessation, pulmonary infarction, dirofilariasis, and (rarely) Spirocerca lupiassociated aortic aneurysm. Disseminated pulmonary hemangiosarcoma causing hemorrhagic effusion is difficult to diagnose antemortem in dogs. Pulmonary aspirates or open-chest biopsy carry a high mortality rate because of tension pneumothorax and worsening hemorrhage.\n\nChylous effusions are more common in the thorax than in the abdomen. They may be idiopathic or associated with underlying disease. Associated disorders are summarized in Figure 10 -4. Some breeds (e.g., Afghan hounds) may have a congenital propensity. Thoracic ultrasonography or postdrainage radiography can assist in identifying underlying conditions. Contrast lymphangiography performed by cannulating mesenteric lymphatics or the thoracic duct sometimes elucidates the site of chyle leakage.\n\nThe list of differentials includes several diseases ( \n\nPericardial effusion is usually associated with pericardial irritation and inflammation, hemorrhage, or central venous congestion. Animals with congestive cardiomyopathy may have small-to-moderate amounts of pericardial fluid. Acutely disabled patients require emergency pericardiocentesis, but it should not be performed indiscriminately. Pure transudates are caused by severe hypoalbuminemia. Modified transudates are found with right-sided heart failure, pericardial cysts, and uremic pericarditis. Exudates are found with FIP, bacterial pericarditis, and coccidioidomycosis. Septic pericarditis is rare. Chylopericardium is rare but may develop consequent to mediastinal venous hypertension (e.g., cardiomyopathy). Trauma, neoplasia, or coagulopathy can cause hemopericardium. Most dogs with pericardial tamponade have modified transudates or exudates (e.g., benign pericardial effusion in approximately 50% of cases; neoplasia including hemangiosarcoma of the right atrium [most common], chemodectoma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma). Cytologic differentiation of benign from malignant pericardial effusion is difficult. Fluid pH (determined using a urine dipstick) may help: Effusions with a pH greater than or equal to 7.0 are usually malignant, whereas a pH less than or equal to 6.5 suggests benign effusions ( Jackson, Richter, and Launer, 1999) . However, this feature appears variable. Contrast radiographs, ultrasonography, thoracoscopy, or exploratory surgery are often needed to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Pericardial biopsy via thoracoscopic sampling is the least invasive reliable method of tissue retrieval. Most cats with pericardial disease have cardiac disease (i.e., cardiomyopathy, valve abnormalities), neoplasia (i.e., lymphoma, metastatic carcinomas), chronic renal disease (uremic pericarditis), coagulopathies or more rarely, bacterial infection. Intrapericardial cysts rarely cause serosanguineous modified transudates or exudates in dogs; diagnosis is based on echocardiography.\n\nJoint fluid should be analyzed in patients with swollen, fluctuant, or painful joints not caused by degenerative joint disease. Joint pain may be subtle; joints should be carefully palpated for mobility, swelling, and discomfort. Synovial fluid analysis distinguishes noninflammatory from inflammatory conditions; examination of joint fluid may be helpful in animals with fever of unknown origin. Many immune-mediated diseases involve joints. Very small amounts of fluid are available from most normal joints; therefore, collecting relatively large volumes suggests effusion. Acute and inflammatory conditions cause effusion, whereas chronic and noninflammatory disorders produce joint enlargement due to soft tissue swelling but yield little fluid. If arthrocentesis is performed to evaluate fever or unexplained lameness in an animal without swollen joints, at least two or three joints should be sampled (carpal and tarsal usually preferred).\n\nHigh cell counts cause turbidity. Homogeneously bloody fluid indicates hemorrhage, and fluid containing \"streaks\" of blood indicates iatrogenic bleeding. Culture, nucleated cell counts, differential cell counts, and estimation of fluid viscosity (mucin tests) are desirable (Table 10 -5, Figure 10-7) . Normal synovial fluid has a \"sticky\" viscosity forming a viscous strand when dripped from a needle. Viscosity is reduced in most types of joint effusion. If small amounts of fluid are obtained, however, smears to determine relative cellularity and the predominant cell type are the first priority. Cytology usually discloses if inflammation is present. Inflammation is indicated by finding greater Borrelia titers is difficult (see Chapter 15). Response to therapy may be the most compelling basis for diagnosing Lyme disease or rickettsial polyarthropathies.\n\nExudative joint disease without evidence of sepsis is categorized as erosive or nonerosive based on radiographs. Rheumatoid arthritis is classically erosive (see Figure 10-7) . Nonerosive arthritides are more difficult to definitively diagnose and categorize. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and arthritis associated with a variety of underlying diseases are more common. Ragocytes, lupus erythematosus (LE) cells, or both indicate immune-mediated disease (see Color Plate 5A). Submission of sera for antinuclear antibody (AN) and rheumatoid factor titers (see Chapter 12), blood for LE cell preparations, and synovial biopsies for histologic evaluation may implicate immunodestructive processes. Chronic, progressive feline polyarthritis usually occurs in males and has two forms. The periosteal-proliferative form is most prevalent, primarily affecting young adult cats and causing tenosynovitis followed by nondeforming periarticular periosteal proliferation and subchondral bone erosions. The deforming or rheumatoidlike arthritis form has an insidious onset in older cats and is associated with severe subchondral bone destruction, joint instability, and deformity. Feet, carpi, and tarsi are severely and symmetrically affected. Table 10 The most common cause of noninflammatory joint disease is degenerative arthritis because of trauma or joint instability. Other causes include hemarthrosis, neoplasia, genetic or developmental disorders, dietary or nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and miscellaneous causes (e.g., hypertrophic osteopathy).\n\nEdema signals underlying disease. Hypoproteinemia causes edema fluid with total solids less than 1 g/dl, whereas venous congestion, lymphedema, or inflammation generate fluid with total solids greater than 2.5 g/dl. In the latter case, total and differential cell counts may distinguish inflammatory (e.g., vasculitis) from noninflammatory causes.\n\nRegional edema is usually caused by inflammation or vascular or lymphatic obstruction (Figure 10-8) . Lymphadenopathy is an indication for lymph node aspirates for cytology and culture. Congenital or acquired arteriovenous fistulae are rare but may cause localized edema. These may be detected by palpable fremitus or bruit, ultrasonography, or angiography. Acquired lymphatic insufficiency after trauma, surgery, or regional infections commonly causes regional edema. Lymphangiograms are usually not indicated in acute disorders. A fine-needle aspiration of involved tissues or regional lymph nodes and aspiration of edema fluid may be helpful. Lymphatic cording is occasionally palpated in animals with lymphatic obstruction or inflammation. Congenital malformation or degenerative lymphatic disorders may cause lymphedema in young animals; lymph nodes are sometimes atrophied or absent. Limb edema and tail edema are most commonly recognized. Affected animals develop overtly swollen appendages (single or multiple) but lack significant physical disability.\n\nGeneralized edema or anasarca is usually dependent, especially occurring in distal extremities (Figure 10-9) . Overhydration, right-sided congestive heart failure, and hypoalbuminemia are the most common causes (Table 10-6). Iatrogenic overhydration does not typically induce marked generalized edema unless another underlying factor (e.g., hypoalbuminemia, anuria-oliguria) exists. Iatrogenic, generalized edema imparts an obvious change in skin turgor (e.g., jellylike consistency) that usually resolves within 48 hours of discontinuing fluids. Animals with normal serum albumin concentrations that develop edema because of overhydration may have insidious cardiac disease, high-output cardiac failure (associated with severe anemia), or anuric-oliguric renal failure.\n\nSerum albumin must be less than or equal to 1.5 g/dl to cause anasarca. This generates a pure transudate in body cavities. Patients with generalized edema from vasculitis usually have perivascular hemorrhage (i.e., petechial hemorrhages, microhematuria) or microangiopathic effects (i.e., schistocytes). Total body water retention because of inappropriate elaboration of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (see Chapter 6) coexists with other disorders that overshadow its presence. Retention of sodium because of increased renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone occurs in patients with severe renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease having hypoalbuminemia. Systemic hypertension often occurs when the renin-angiotensin axis is the primary abnormality. History, physical examination, serum albumin determination, thoracic radiographs, cardiac evaluations (i.e., ECG, echocardiography), CVP determinations, and urinalysis assist in confirming the cause of anasarca (see Figure 10 -9). Finding a jugular pulse or abnormal hepatojugular reflex suggests intrathoracic disease. If an underlying cause is not found, physical examination and laboratory data are reviewed looking for evidence of vasculitis (i.e., petechiation, fundic examination for microvascular lesions, microscopic hematuria, blood smear looking for schistocytes). Skin biopsies performed in areas of bruising or cutaneous lesions should be taken to investigate vasculitis. Collecting edema fluid and analyzing its protein content helps differentiate inflammatory causes from hypoalbuminemia.\n\nScrotal effusion usually develops when abdominal fluid enters the scrotum via the inguinal rings. Severe orchitis or testicular torsion may also be responsible and can often be discerned by ultrasonography and aspiration cytology. Because scrotal edema may be caused by vasculitis (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever), evaluation for systemic infection is important. If effusion is localized to the scrotum, castration may be diagnostic and therapeutic. Figure 10 -2 FIGURE 10-8. Diagnostic considerations in animals with regional or localized edema.
