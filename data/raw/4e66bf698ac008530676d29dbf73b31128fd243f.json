{"title": "", "body": "Grid computing is the most exciting incarnation of contemporary computing technologies including parallel, peer-to-peer, and client-server models. It has been used mostly in physical and engineering applications. Liu et al. present a model using the Data Grid for the backup and recovery of clinical image data-one of the most difficult problems facing large-scale clinical image databases today.\n\nInternet 2 is the high-speed communication backbones established by the education and research community during the past 5 years through the support of the US National Science Foundation (NSF). Internet DICOM-based medical image standard has been successfully implemented in diagnostic radiology during the past 10 years. However, despite the introduction of DICOM radiation therapy (RT) objects since 1999, the RT community has not yet to take advantage of the power and infrastructure of imaging informatics. Law presents an ePR model of DICOM-based radiation therapy information system, where seven RT DICOM objects are included, as a first attempt at such a development to utilize these concepts.\n\nIn the past, ePR has been developed as a small-scale customized electronic patient based system. Cheung et al.'s paper describes the planning and preliminary results of an enterprise level ePR with image distribution in Hong Kong. The ePR system involves 43 hospitals (93% of the Hong Kong market) with a total of 29,000 beds. The ePR system is based on the existing Clinical Management System (CMS) developed in-house at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority which currently contains 6.4 million patients' records.\n\nOne reason for developing the medical imaging infrastructure is to take advantage of tools within the infrastructure for large-scale longitudinal and horizontal clinical service and research, as well as systematic education and training. Among these tools are image processing, visualization, image matching, content-based retrieval, data mining, and computer-assisted detection and diagnosis. Four papers are included in this group: \n\nImaging informatics is a very broad field using many tools and technologies, which may or may not be developed originally for medical imaging applications. Two papers are included in this group. Although, they may not fall exactly under the realm of imaging informatics, the outcomes of using imaging and technologies to achieve their goals are very similar to that of imaging informatics. In addition, some of the tools and technologies used have great potential of being adopted for imaging informatics applications and expanding the realm of Imaging Informatics.\n\nMontgomery et al.-User interface paradigms for patient-specific surgical planning C. Huang-Designing high-quality interactive multimedia learning modules.\n\nIn surgery, the first innovations of using image-aided tools are 3D display and image-based surgical planning. The current research and development trend is in surgical simulation. Although contents in Montgomery et al.'s paper did not explicitly mention imaging informatics, readers can no doubt identify many terms and technologies in the paper that overlap with those used in imaging informatics.\n\nIn interactive multimedia learning, images, graphic, drawings, video clips are among those being used as inputs to the learning tools. C. Huang's paper describes a methodology currently being used for building learning modules. In the paper, the author also points out the similarity of technologies used in imaging informatics and in interactive multimedia learning.\n\nImaging informatics is dealing with clinical images that are acquired, stored, transmitted through public networks, and displayed. During these processes, the image integrity could have been compromised at any stage. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a mandate for medical image user compliance. However, HIPAA only tells the user to comply, but does not provide protocols to be followed. Zhou et al.'s paper 'HIPAA Compliant Auditing System for Medical Images' describes a framework for HIPAA compliance using a workflow-auditing paradigm.\n\nIn summary, the 12 papers included in this Special Issue in Medical Imaging Informatics covers five groups of papers: state-of-the-art technologies ePR with images; image-aided detection and diagnosis; surgical simulation and interactive multimedia learning; and HIPAA compliance. Together, they provide a glimpse of current research and development (R&D) trends in this field. It is hoped that this issue will stimulate further R&D in imaging informatics to benefit the steadily fast growing medical imaging community."}
