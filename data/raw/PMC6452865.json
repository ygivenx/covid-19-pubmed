{"title": "Viral RNA structure-based strategies to manipulate translation", "body": "Perhaps the most straightforward way for a viral RNA to co-opt the cellular translation machinery is to directly mimic cellular mRNA translation initiation signals. There are several ways viruses enzymatically create a cap-like structure at the 5\u0374 end of the viral RNA (reviewed in refs8,9): using the host capping machinery in the nucleus, used by many double-stranded DNA viruses; encoding viral capping enzymes that are used in the cytoplasm; and through \u2018cap-snatching\u2019, in which the viral RNA polymerase cleaves the capped 5\u0374 end of nascent cellular mRNAs and uses this to prime viral RNA synthesis. This was first discovered in influenza A virus10; novel examples were recently reported for two totiviruses11,12. Some viruses further chemically modify the cap to mask viral RNAs from detection and degradation13,14. Although capping is a common way for viruses to hijack the cellular machinery, many viruses use cap-independent modes of translation initiation.\n\nIn canonical eukaryotic translation initiation, recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex to mRNAs is followed by 5\u0374 to 3\u0374 scanning to find a start codon; this process is readily exploited by viruses using RNA-based signals. The most used start codon is an AUG within a consensus sequence known as the Kozak sequence (Fig. 2a). A \u2018strong\u2019 Kozak consensus sequence is gccRccAUGG, in which the start AUG is surrounded by highly conserved nucleotides (uppercase letters; a purine (R) three nucleotides upstream of the AUG and a G immediately downstream of the AUG) and less conserved nucleotides (lowercase letters); variations on this provide various degrees of translation efficiency, or \u2018strength\u201915. If a start codon within a \u2018weak\u2019 Kozak sequence is encountered, scanning ribosomes can sometimes continue scanning, or \u2018leak\u2019, past the AUG codon to locate another start codon (Fig. 2b). This leaky scanning allows the production of different proteins in specific quantities from a single mRNA, and by shifting the reading frame to different start codons, different proteins can be synthesized (Fig. 2c). Viruses exploit this by using RNA templates that contain multiple reading frames, each starting at an AUG within a Kozak sequence of a specific strength, thus regulating the degree to which each codon is used for initiation. Notable mammalian viruses that use this include influenza A and B viruses and orthoreoviruses. A recently described example is in Andes virus, in which leaky scanning produces both the nucleocapsid protein and the non-structural protein from a single small mRNA16.\n\nRibosome profiling has uncovered a large number of non-AUG start codons (especially CUG) that are likely used to regulate gene expression17, and viruses can combine non-AUG initiation with start codon context \u2018strength\u2019 to provide precise regulation. For example, in panicum mosaic virus (PMV) infection, up to four ORFs are translated from a single subgenomic viral RNA using a combination of leaky scanning and initiation at GUG codons18. Furthermore, some viruses manipulate scanning and start site selection by encoding RNA signals that cause a scanning ribosome to \u2018shunt\u2019 over sections of the 5\u0374 UTR that possibly contain short ORFs19. Another strategy of manipulating ribosome scanning is used by some alphaviruses when a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) is translated under conditions of translation inhibition by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Specifically, a stable RNA stem-loop element downstream of the start codon (downstream loop) pauses scanning long enough for Met-tRNAiMet to enter the initiation complex without an initiation factor20\u201322. In this case, ribosome stalling occurs when the downstream loop becomes trapped in a section of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), locking the start codon in the P site23. This latter example shows how a virus can use a fairly small RNA element to overcome part of the host antiviral response.\n\nSome viruses also have the ability to alter the translation machinery in such a way as to influence the selection of an mRNA template in their favour or directly prevent the cell from limiting translation. For example, poxvirus kinase phosphorylates small ribosomal subunit proteins, which enhances the translation of viral mRNAs with conserved adenosine repeats in their 5\u0374 UTRs24. In addition, similar to some proteins, specific viral RNAs can prevent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1; examples include the adenovirus VA25 and Epstein\u2013Barr virus EBER26, which both act by binding and inhibiting the enzyme that phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1.\n\nClass 4 IRESs have thus far been identified exclusively in the family Dicistroviridae, of which the single-stranded RNA genomes contain two ORFs separated by an intergenic region (IGR). The IGR contains an IRES that controls translation of the downstream ORF, thus they are often referred to as the \u2018IGR IRESs\u2019; they have been extensively functionally and structurally characterized since their discovery, providing insight into some basic aspects of ribosome function (reviewed in refs30,31). There are two types of IGR IRESs, but all are ~150\u2013200 nucleotides in length and are capable of initiating translation in a variety of cell types and organisms. These IRESs can even initiate translation in bacteria, although the mechanism appears to be inefficient and different than in eukaryotes32.\n\nThe molecular mechanism of these IRESs depends on its 3D structure, which allows them to initiate translation by co-opting the elongation cycle of translation. Early structural studies revealed that IGR IRESs fold into a compact structure containing three RNA pseudoknots in a two-domain architecture33\u201335. One pseudoknot domain (domain 3) partially mimics tRNA structure and the mRNA\u2013tRNA codon\u2013anticodon interaction36\u201338. To initiate translation, the folded IRES binds directly to the 40S ribosomal subunit with high affinity and assembles an 80S ribosome without using scanning, an AUG start codon, Met-tRNAiMet or any initiation factor (including eIF2)30,31. In fact, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation can increase translation initiation efficiency from these IRESs39, providing an elegant way for the virus to take advantage of this major cellular antiviral response mechanism. Within the assembled 80S ribosome, the IRES is placed between the two subunits with domain 3 in the A site of the ribosome, where it interacts with the ribosome in the same way as a codon\u2013anticodon pair36 (Fig. 3a). One round of eEF2-catalysed \u2018pseudotranslocation\u2019 (so-called because it occurs without tRNA) moves this domain to the P site, allowing charged tRNA delivery to the A site by eEF1A. A second round of eEF2-catalysed translocation moves this tRNA to the P site, enabling elongation. More recent studies have revealed details of the molecular movements occurring during this process37,40\u201342; movement of the IRES through the space between the ribosomal subunits has been described as akin to that of an inchworm43.\n\nThe best-known class 3 IRES is from hepatitis C virus (HCV) (in the family Flaviviridae) (Fig. 3b); others have been found in viruses from the families Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae28,44. Unlike class 4 IRESs, class 3 IRESs have thus far been found only at the 5\u0374 end of viral RNAs, and they assume an extended architecture containing a variety of stem-loop structures that are organized around helical junctions and a pseudoknot (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, although the various class 3 IRESs share overall secondary structures with clear common patterns, there is also substantial sequence and structure variation that may provide for additional regulation or variation in function. This observation, and the fact that they appear in multiple virus families, suggests a useful versatility. It may not be immediately obvious why these viruses have evolved to use an IRES. One simple explanation is that class 3 IRES-containing viruses simply did not evolve the ability to cap the 5\u0374 ends of their RNAs and thus were committed to developing a form of cap-independent translation. However, a more compelling cause is that at least some class 3 IRESs can operate in both eIF2-dependent and eIF2-independent modes45\u201348.\n\nExtensive biochemical, genetic and structural studies have allowed development of mechanistic models for class 3 IRESs. Early structural studies consisted of NMR and X-ray crystallography applied to several isolated HCV IRES domains, which were combined with low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions29. Most recently, high-resolution cryo-EM structures of class 3 IRES\u2013ribosome complexes have revealed the molecular details of the interactions underlying the structure-based mechanism49\u201351. Using the HCV IRES as an example, the structure of the IRES possesses several domains that have specific roles during IRES-driven translation initiation52. The IRES RNA directly binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and eIF3 using multiple contact points in domain III53,54. Binding positions the AUG start codon within the decoding groove; thus, there is no scanning. Interestingly, in the IRES\u221240S\u2013eIF3 complex, eIF3 is displaced from its normal binding position on the 40S subunit51; this displacement may be necessary for the IRES to access the 40S subunit or it may be a functionally important remodelling step46. Domain II does not increase the affinity between the IRES and the 40S subunit but makes specific contacts to the decoding groove of the ribosome, changes ribosome conformation and directs several mechanistically important events29,48,55\u201358. Domain II may change position during the initiation process50, possibly acting as an important regulatory element.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting step in class 3 IRES initiation is the delivery of Met-tRNAiMet to the IRES\u221240S\u2013eIF3 complex, as this is when the ability to operate in an eIF2-dependent or independent mode comes into play. If eIF2 is available, Met-tRNAiMet presumably is supplied by the factor. However, in the eIF2-independent mode, it has been proposed that Met-tRNAiMet could be delivered by alternative factors eIF2A or eIF2D59\u201361, or through the action of eIF5B alone47, or even through direct \u2018factorless\u2019 tRNA binding in the case of some class 3 IRESs62. In addition, eIF1A appears to be particularly important for stabilizing tRNA binding in the eIF2-independent mode46. Regardless of the pathway, once Met-tRNAiMet is bound, 60S subunit recruitment leads to 80S ribosome formation and then elongation52.\n\nAlthough a strong framework for understanding the class 3 IRESs exists, there are areas that require additional investigation. First, although we have presented the molecular mechanism of the HCV IRES translation initiation as a stepwise progression, there is uncertainty regarding the precise order of these recruitment events and how this might relate to the ability to use different tRNA binding modes. There is evidence that the HCV IRES binds pre-formed 40S subunit-containing preinitiation complexes at a specific step of ribosome recycling, then manipulates them to drive downstream steps of tRNA recruitment and 80S ribosome formation46. Second, although a limited set of canonical eIFs appear to be sufficient for translation on most class 3 IRESs tested, roles for some auxiliary factors have been proposed63. Such factors combined with variable class 3 IRES structure may fine-tune function for certain cell types, for the specific needs of different viruses or for providing additional ways to respond to changing cellular conditions and antiviral responses.\n\nClass 1 and 2 IRESs are found exclusively in picornaviruses and are similar to one another in that they are generally ~450 nucleotides long, are found in the 5\u0374 UTR of the viral RNAs, are unable to bind directly to the 40S subunit and require almost the entire set of canonical translation initiation factors (excluding eIF4E)27,64. Both classes have complex secondary structures comprising multiple domains containing many stem-loops, internal loops, bulges and junctions (Fig. 3c). Both class 1 and 2 use IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) \u2014 protein factors that are not considered part of the canonical translation machinery but are functionally important to a specific IRES63. Viruses that use class 1 or 2 IRESs gain an advantage by depressing cap-dependent initiation while promoting IRES-driven translation5,44. Specifically, enteroviruses such as poliovirus cleave eIF4G, which decouples cap and factor binding, and the IRES then uses a cleaved fragment of eIF4G for translation initiation. Cardioviruses such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) cause the relocalization of eIF4E into the nucleus, which depresses cap-dependent translation, but class 1 IRES-dependent translation can continue. Both class 1 and 2 IRESs are at least partially refractory to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation during infection65. For example, poliovirus may be able to operate in an eIF2-independent mode late during infection by using eIF5B66, suggesting that, similar to the class 3 and 4 IRESs, they have evolved strategies to bypass canonical Met-tRNAiMet delivery. Despite these similarities, class 1 and 2 IRESs are not identical in terms of secondary structure and mechanism, and there are variations within each class. To present some overarching mechanistic concepts, we use the poliovirus and EMCV IRESs as prototypes for classes 1 and 2, respectively, and direct the reader to focused reviews for further information on other IRESs27,44,64.\n\nThe general model that has emerged from biochemical and genetic experiments is that class 1 and 2 IRESs are flexible scaffolds to which ITAF binding facilitates eIF binding, leading to recruitment of the ribosome. In the case of the class II EMCV IRES, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an important ITAF that simultaneously binds to polypyrimidine tracts (Yn) near the 5\u0374 (domain II) and 3\u0374 ends of the IRES (just upstream of the translation start site), altering the overall conformation of the IRES67,68 (Fig. 3c). The class 1 poliovirus IRES also uses PTB as an ITAF69 and poly-C-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), which binds to a cytosine-rich stretch in the large central domain IV of the poliovirus IRES70 (Fig. 3c). PTB and PCBP2 are not the only ITAFs that have been identified, and there is variation across the various members of the class 1 and 2 IRESs44. In addition to ITAF binding, long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions involving GNRA tetraloops are proposed to further organize the active conformation of both class 1 and 2 IRESs71\u201373.\n\nThe ITAF-assisted conformation of the class 1 and 2 IRESs is the platform for recruiting eIFs: in the poliovirus IRES, eIF4G and eIF4A bind to domain V70, whereas in the EMCV IRES they bind to domain IV74. It is worth noting that in viral infections in which eIF4G is cleaved by viral proteases, the amino-terminal fragment of eIF4G that binds eIF4E is lost, whereas the carboxy-terminal fragment that interacts with eIF3 interacts directly with the IRES RNA. EMCV IRES domain V also binds other factors, including eIF4B75. Binding of eIFs to the class 1 and 2 IRESs then leads to the recruitment of the 43S complex. However, the class 1 and 2 IRESs differ in the use of start codons for initiation44. For the class 2 EMCV IRES, translation initiates without scanning at the second of two closely spaced AUG codons76. However, other class 2 IRESs appear to use both AUG start codons, suggesting that scanning occurs77. During translation from the class 1 poliovirus IRES, the ribosome is initially recruited to an upstream \u2018cryptic\u2019 AUG codon, and it then scans through domain VI to reach the AUG start codon78,79.\n\nDespite a good mechanistic and biochemical framework for understanding class 1 and 2 IRESs, their large and extended architectures and the complexity of the associated translation preinitiation complexes have made structural studies difficult. Isolated domains of IRESs have been investigated using NMR80,81, and small-angle X-ray scattering has been used to determine the global shape of part of EMCV IRES domain IV bound to the HEAT1 domain of eIF4G81. However, to date, the structures of assembled class 1 or 2 IRES\u2013ribosome\u2013eIF\u2013ITAF complexes are unsolved. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to fully understand how these complex assemblies are constructed, differences when compared with canonical initiation and the dynamic conformational changes that take place. We expect advances in cryo-EM coupled with other structural methods to help address these unknowns.\n\nIn addition to those described above, other IRESs have less well-understood mechanisms and structures and therefore cannot be easily classified. For example, the Halastavi \u00e1rva virus 5\u0374 UTR IRES operates with most canonical eIFs but requires retrograde scanning82, precluding easy assignment to any aforementioned class. Other IRESs are more challenging to classify. For example, the leader sequence of HIV-1 RNAs alone can stimulate translation in a cell-type-specific manner83, but different HIV-1 transcripts contain different IRES structures and splice site variations84, and the viral transcripts are capped. In HIV-1 and other retroviruses, the contributions of IRES-dependent and cap-dependent translation during infection remain the subject of debate85. Overall, the diversity of structures and mechanisms used by IRESs is greater than initially anticipated, and future characterization of these RNAs must include focused studies of many different examples to discover both idiosyncratic features of individual IRESs and common principles.\n\nPRF occurs when a specific RNA element causes an elongating ribosome to pause and the mRNA\u2013tRNA codon\u2013anticodon interactions break and then reform in a different reading frame; often the shift is one nucleotide backwards, leading to \u2018\u20131PRF\u201987,88. As viruses have limited coding capacities, many viral genomes encode overlapping ORFs and use PRF to double or triple the coding capacity of a single RNA template (Fig. 4a). The percentage of ribosomes that undergo frameshifting is generally only a small percentage, but it can reach 40% for some viral \u20131PRF signals89. These RNA signals also have evolved to achieve a specific ratio of protein products.\n\nPRF signalling structured RNA elements have been documented in bacterial, yeast, plant and mammalian systems and consist of two types. The first is a pseudoknot located six to eight nucleotides downstream of a \u2018slippery sequence\u201988. These pseudoknots often control the expression of the gag-pro or gag-pol genes of retroviruses, regulating the relative expression of structural and non-structural proteins. Interestingly, PRF in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection may involve trans RNA\u2013RNA interactions90. The second type of structure is a thermodynamically stable stem-loop. Examples are found in other members of the family Retroviridae such as HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus91\u201393 (Fig. 4a). For stem-loop-directed frameshifting, stability of the stem is of primary importance, but adjacent structures and long-range interactions with other RNA elements can further modulate frameshifting. An interesting example is the pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) recoding stimulatory element; RNA secondary structure elements upstream and downstream of the frameshift site modulate the frequency of frameshifting, which occurs just upstream of a termination codon94. Interestingly, dynamic rearrangement between a pseudoknot and a tandem stem-loop conformation in a \u20131PRF signal in West Nile virus RNA seems important for frameshifting95, highlighting the complexity of the molecular motions that govern this process.\n\nThe mechanism by which specific RNA elements stimulate frameshifting at a slippery sequence remains an area of active investigation. Thermostability of the RNA fold alone does not dictate frameshifting efficiency96, and mechanisms may differ between individual frameshifting signals. In some cases, frameshifting correlates with stability of ribosome-adjacent base pairing97 and metastable or non-canonical conformations on an elongating ribosome87,98. The resolution of paused ribosomes into either the 0 or \u22121 frame is influenced by the dynamics of the PRF structure95 and the inherent helicase activity of ribosomes99. Viral frameshifting can also be stimulated by viral and cellular protein factors that bind viral RNA adjacent to the slippery site and act in place of, or in concert with, higher-order RNA folding. For example, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus utilizes a complex of its Nsp1\u03b2 replicase subunit and PCBP that associates with a sequence downstream of the slippery site and directs either \u20132 or \u20131 frameshifting100\u2013102. Additionally, the cardioviruses EMCV and Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus contain atypically spaced stem-loops proximal to frameshifting sites that seem to cooperate with the viral 2A protein to facilitate high-efficiency frameshifting (~70\u201382% frameshifting)103\u2013105.\n\nViruses can increase coding capacity by the ribosomal readthrough of stop codons, resulting in extended protein isoforms. Signals near the stop codon may promote recognition by a suppressor tRNA rather than by a termination factor protein, dependent primarily on the RNA sequence immediately adjacent to the stop codon106\u2013109. Tobacco mosaic virus and other plant viruses use this method to make extended coat protein isoforms110. Another signal that can cause readthrough is an RNA element just 3\u0374 to the stop codon, including a stem-loop or pseudoknot (Fig. 4c). A stem-loop has been computationally predicted to exist in some alphaviruses and plant viruses within the family Virgaviridae111 and experimentally shown in Colorado tick fever virus112. Pseudoknots are also implicated in translational readthrough in murine leukaemia gammaretrovirus infection113,114. Readthrough can be promoted by a long-range cis interaction involving RNA near the stop codon (for example, in some members of the Tombusviridae and Luteoviridae families115) (Fig. 4c, bottom). The precise molecular mechanisms of readthrough in viral RNAs remain poorly defined. Recent studies of readthrough in turnip crinkle virus (TCV) infection suggest that these RNA elements can adopt multiple conformations, further illustrating the dynamic and complex nature of viral recoding elements116. Lacking detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms, it is tempting to hypothesize a mechanism in which these RNA elements slow translation termination long enough to favour the recruitment of low-abundance suppressor tRNAs117.\n\nViruses can manipulate translation by interrupting the recycling of a terminated ribosome in favour of reinitiation of an adjacent viral ORF; this differs from readthrough in that the synthesis of the first protein terminates, and then the ribosome reinitiates at a site proximal to the termination site (either upstream or downstream) to produce a second protein. A well-characterized example of reinitiation, used by feline calicivirus, is directed by a structured RNA element called the termination upstream ribosome-binding site (TURBS) that lies within the last 40\u201380 nucleotides of the upstream ORF (Fig. 4d). This type of reinitiation was originally suspected to be \u20131PRF and exists within other Caliciviridae family members (including human and bovine noroviruses) and haemorrhagic viruses such as rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus118\u2013120. The TURBS contains a sequence that forms complementary interactions with the apical loop of helix 26 of 18S rRNA. Viral RNA\u2013rRNA base pairing is sufficient to retain the 40S subunit for a time after termination121, then the 40S subunit can move to the second ORF start site a short distance away; subsequent reinitiation appears to be more streamlined than normal initiation122. Notably, the ribosomal binding site of the TURBS is remarkably similar to sequences in the class 3 IRESs that are needed for 40S subunit recruitment, suggesting either an evolutionary link between these RNA elements (and thus between IRES-driven initiation and reinitiation) or a convergent mechanistic solution to the problem of recruiting and manipulating the 40S subunit.\n\n3\u0374 cap-independent translation elements (3\u0374-CITEs) are structurally diverse RNA elements in the 3\u0374 UTRs of many RNA plant viruses that allow translation of the upstream sequences by recruiting translation components (eIFs or ribosomal subunits) to the 3\u0374 UTR, but then translation initiates at the 5\u0374 end owing to 5\u0374 to 3\u0374 communication123\u2013126. Seven 3\u0374-CITE structural classes have been identified125. Although naturally found in the 3\u0374 UTR, 3\u0374-CITEs have been shown to function when placed in the 5\u0374 UTR127, and 3\u0374-CITEs from one virus have been shown to function in other viruses, demonstrating that they are portable elements. However, unlike IRESs (which can drive translation initiation independent of the 5\u0374 end), the 5\u0374 end is needed for the function of some 3\u0374-CITEs even if the cap is not128\u2013130. 3\u0374-CITEs could provide several advantages to the virus. First, they could allow successful competition with cellular mRNAs for translation components, as the affinity of many 3\u0374-CITEs for their target eIFs is high (dissociation constants in the mid-nanomolar range)131,132. In addition, 3\u0374-CITEs could capture ribosomes terminating at the 3\u0374 end and deliver them to the 5\u0374 end. This mechanism could prevent any hindrance between the replication and translation machineries if they were operating on the same viral RNA, or it could regulate the rate of translation of different subgenomic viral RNAs with different 5\u0374 UTRs133. Several excellent recent reviews describe the diversity of 3\u0374-CITE structure and function123\u2013126; therefore, we briefly provide representative examples to illustrate key concepts.\n\nMost known 3\u0374-CITEs function by directly binding components of the cap-binding eIF4F complex; for example, the highly efficient barley yellow dwarf virus translation element (BTE) found in some members of the family Tombusviridae134\u2013137 (Fig. 5a). The BTE contains a conserved stem-loop structure that directly binds eIF4G, aided by other factors, in a way that still allows eIF4G to bind poly(A) binding protein (PABP) and eIF4E138\u2013140. Base pairing between a sequence in the 3\u0374-CITE and a complementary sequence in the 5\u0374 UTR brings the bound factor or factors to the 5\u0374 end where they can drive translation initiation128,129,137. Other 3\u0374-CITEs use specific RNA sequences and structures to directly bind eIF4E141\u2013144 (Fig. 5b) or the intact eIF4F complex126 (Fig. 5c). For example, the panicum mosaic virus-like translation enhancers (PTEs) are a class of 3\u0374-CITEs that bind directly to eIF4E using a folded RNA element coupled with long-range interactions to complementary sequences in either the 5\u0374 UTR or within an upstream coding region126,144.\n\nMost types of 3\u0374-CITEs directly bind eIFs; however, others directly bind to the ribosome itself. For example, the T-shaped structures (TSSs) found in TCV and cardamine chlorotic fleck virus RNAs directly interact with 80S ribosomes or 60S subunits145,146 (Fig. 5d), and they have been proposed to form folded structures akin to tRNAs. Unlike most 3\u0374-CITEs, TSSs lack identified sequences that base pair with the 5\u0374 end (with the exception of the kissing-loop TSS, so named because it base pairs long distance with a hairpin-loop structure); the \u2018bridge\u2019 between the two ends is thought to occur through the 40S subunit association with the 5\u0374 end147. Interestingly, some viruses use more than one type of 3\u0374-CITE cooperatively. For example, PEMV2 possesses an eIF-binding PTE that lacks the ability to pair to 5\u0374 sequences, a 60S subunit and 80S ribosome-binding TSS (used only by the sgRNA)148 and a kissing-loop TSS that binds both ribosome subunits and forms long-distance kissing-loop interactions with a hairpin in the coding region149,150. In addition, new types of 3\u0374-CITEs and combinations of 3\u0374-CITEs continue to be discovered. The most recently identified type comes from Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV)-Xinjiang. Only 55 nucleotides long, the CABYV-Xinjiang-like translation element (CXTE) functions in eIF4E-depleted lysate and is enhanced by the viral 5\u0374 UTR; however, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unknown125. Interestingly, the melon necrotic spot virus appears to have acquired a CXTE (from CABYV) in addition to an I-shaped structure (a type of 3\u0374-CITE named for its extended secondary structure)125. This example illustrates how 3\u0374-CITEs can transfer between viruses and how it is likely that additional types of 3\u0374-CITEs, and combinations of 3\u0374-CITEs, are awaiting discovery.\n\nDespite the importance, widespread distribution and diversity of 3\u0374-CITEs, to date there is limited information about their 3D structures. Structural predictions of the PTEs from PMV and PEMV2 in both the apo form and eIF4E-bound form have been constructed144, but there are no experimentally determined structures. Also, molecular models of the TSS from TCV and the kissing-loop TSS from PEMV2 have been constructed that predict structural characteristics akin to tRNAs124, and the structure of the TCV TSS has been studied by NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering151. However, to date there are no high-resolution structures of other diverse 3\u0374-CITEs in isolation or bound to their translation machinery targets. In addition, conformational changes and dynamics within these complexes are important152; recent quantitative biophysical and structural studies of the TCV TSS revealed how the TSS is disassembled through viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase binding, a requirement for replication153. However, more exploration is needed to understand the conformational dynamics underlying 3\u0374-CITE binding to their targets and their functions.\n\nThe extreme 3\u0374 terminus of Tymovirus and Tobamovirus plant viruses contains elements that recruit specific host aminoacyl tRNA synthetases to aminoacylate the 3\u0374 end of the viral RNA, an event that promotes diverse viral processes including stabilizing the viral RNA and enhancing translation from a capped 5\u0374 end by a mechanism that remains unknown154. These \u2018tRNA-like structures\u2019 (TLSs) exist in three types with distinct secondary structures and tertiary folds154, charged with either valine, histidine or tyrosine. Aminoacylated TLSs also bind eEF1A155, and the turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) TLS has a high affinity for ribosomes156. Biophysical and biochemical studies have informed the development of models of different TLS types, but only the structure of the unbound TLS RNA from TYMV has been experimentally solved to high resolution156 (Fig. 5e). This structure reveals a global tRNA-like fold but with marked differences compared with tRNAs that help explain its multifunctionality. In the case of TYMV TLS, there is evidence that the tRNA-like fold forms tertiary interactions with an adjacent upstream pseudoknot domain (UPD) and could serve as a structural switch to control events during infection157. However, the molecular details of how aminoacylation and factor binding to the TLS at the 3\u0374 end enhance translation from the 5\u0374 end is still unclear. One study concluded that the TYMV TLS can deliver a valine as the first amino acid of viral proteins158; other studies have challenged this finding159. It could be that eEF1A-bound TYMV TLS interacts with either the ribosome or other components of the translation machinery and recruits them to the viral RNA, but this has yet to be definitively shown, and there is no clear mechanism of 5\u0374 to 3\u0374 communication.\n\nIn this Review, we have presented an overview of the many types of RNA elements that manipulate the eukaryotic translation machinery at all phases of the protein synthesis process: initiation, elongation, termination and recycling. Using illustrative examples, we show how these RNA elements are abundant and structurally and mechanistically diverse and how they provide viruses with sophisticated ways to exploit the translation machinery or overcome antiviral defences. Studying these RNA elements not only provides insight into virus replication mechanisms and new targets for therapeutic intervention or agricultural control but also increases our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of translation.\n\nAs we have explored diverse types of RNAs, we have highlighted some of the major unknowns. For a given functional RNA, we may know the sequence, have a putative secondary structural model, have identified some interacting proteins and know the translation phases involved, but for most of these RNAs, there is still much to be learned. For example, for most, we do not know the 3D structures of the RNA elements, the details of how they interact with their targets and the consequences of that interaction. For example, when a viral RNA binds to an eIF or to the ribosome, where does it bind and how does this alter the structure of the target to alter function in a way that promotes viral replication? Likewise, there is a need to understand the dynamics of these interactions and processes in many ways: how do the interactions between viral RNAs and their targets change as cellular conditions change? Does cellular localization affect these processes? Moreover, translation is intimately connected to other cellular processes such as RNA decay, raising the question of how these viral mechanisms are affected by or function within a global context. We predict that some of the next important advances will be comprehensive descriptions of the detailed structures of viral RNAs in complex with their targets, an understanding of how these interactions lead to manipulation of the translational machinery, how conditions change during the course of the viral infection, how these events are coordinated with other viral processes and how this relates to pathogenesis.\n\nAnswering these questions will require contributions from many fields, including virology, structural biology, biochemistry and cell biology. Excitingly, new tools are emerging that can help address these questions. For example, advances in structural methods such as cryo-EM will allow the visualization of large complexes that include viral RNAs and the translation machinery, which is particularly useful for studies of IRESs and 3\u0374-CITEs. Likewise, super-resolution microscopy and methods such as time-resolved fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) should provide insight into the changing localization and composition of viral RNA\u2013protein complexes in cells. Methods such as ribosome profiling and in-cell chemical probing of RNA will allow the characterization of RNA structures and translational status during the course of viral infection. The next advances will not come from a single approach but from an integration of these emerging technologies with classical virology and biochemistry."}
