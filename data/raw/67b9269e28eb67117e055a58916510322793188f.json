{"title": "Autophagy in the regulation of pathogen replication and adaptive immunity NIH Public Access", "body": "pathogens for lysosomal destruction, it also contributes to the ability of cells to present pathogen-derived peptides to T cells. Autophagy is therefore an important contributor to both innate and adaptive immunity.\n\nIn this review we will discuss the mechanisms of selective macroautophagy of pathogens and its contribution to innate and adaptive immunity. We will also provide several examples of how certain bacteria and viruses are restricted by macroautophagy, while others escape autophagy and sometimes even use this pathway for their propagation. It therefore appears that pathogens not adapted to life in the cytosol are efficiently restricted by macroautophagy, while those with a cytosolic life style have evolved to avert autophagy or even subvert it for their benefit.\n\nBefore discussing selective macroautophagy of pathogens, we will introduce some aspects of the molecular machinery underlying this process. 35 genes have been identified as essential for macroautophagy in yeast [6] , which are called autophagy-related genes or atgs.\n\nDuring autophagosome formation in either yeast or mammals a membrane is marked with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P; PI3P) by a complex of the type III PI3 kinase Vps34, Vps15, ATG6/BECLIN-1 and ATG14L. At the PI3P marked site membrane elongation results in the formation of an isolation membrane (also known as a phagophore), which eventually closes around the substrate into a completely sealed autophagosome ( Figure 1 ). Autophagosome formation in all eukaryotes requires two ubiquitin-like systems that act sequentially. The first system comprises the conjugation of the ubiquitin-fold protein ATG12 to ATG5, catalyzed by the E1-and E2-like enzymes ATG7 and ATG10. ATG5-ATG12 associates with ATG16L1 into an E3-like enzyme that mediates the covalent attachment of ATG8 (LC3B being the primarily studied mammalian homologue) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the isolation membrane. Prior to this coupling event ATG8 requires C-terminally processing by the protease ATG4 and activation by the E1-and E2-like enzymes ATG7 and ATG3, respectively. Lipidated ATG8 facilitates tethering and fusion of vesicular membranes and, therefore, could promote elongation of the isolation membrane [7] [8] [9] . In addition, ATG8/LC3 is involved in anchoring substrates to the inside of the emerging autophagosome. Once the autophagsome is completed it rapidly fuses with lysosomes in a Rab7-dependent fashion (half-life of 10-25min in hepatocytes). This fusion is also facilitated by a PI3 kinase-containing ATG6/BECLIN-1 complex, possibly in conjunction with UVRAG and negatively regulated by Rubicon. The de novo formation of autophagosomes enables macroautophagy to engulf structures of variable sizes, e.g. protein aggregates, cell organelles or whole pathogens, and accordingly autophagosomes can range from 0.5-10\u03bcm in diameter.\n\nThe membrane source for autophagosome formation is still heavily debated. Isolation membranes have been visualized by electron tomography on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) [10, 11] , but membranes of autophagosomes were also found to originate from the Golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane or mitochondria [12] . For selective autophagy, particularly if involving pathogens occurring in unforeseen places, the substrate might determine the location where phagophores must form. The above-described molecular machinery may therefore deploy membranes already existing in close proximity to the pathogen to initiate the formation of the isolation membrane. This flexibility of autophagosome formation, both in size and location, is used by the immune system to engulf invading pathogens for degradation and antigen presentation, as well as by pathogens to generate membrane structures that are useful to them. In addition to the capture of pathogens by canonical autophagy, ATG proteins are also deployed, either individually or in small modules, to fight intracellular pathogens in alternative pathways that do not involve the formation of autophagosomes (discussed later in the review).\n\nBacteria enter cells either passively by phagocytosis or actively by inducing their uptake into normally non-phagocytic cells, for example through specialized secretion apparatuses that inject bacterial effector proteins directly into the host cytosol. While most phagocytosed bacteria are safely killed upon delivery into lysosomes, many intracellular pathogens have evolved the ability to manipulate vesicle maturation, allowing them to either proliferate inside the vesicular compartment or to escape into the cytosol. In an attempt to prevent infection, cells deploy macroautophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP; discussed in detail later on) to capture bacteria during their inwards journey, followed by delivery into lysosomes for destruction ( Figure 2 ). In contrast to LAP, which modifies the limiting membrane of pathogen-containing vesicles, macroautophagy engulfs pathogens with additional autophagosome-derived membranes. The principal targets of anti-bacterial autophagy are bacteria-containing vesicles, bacteria associated with remnants of damaged vesicles, and bacteria that have already escaped into the cytosol. Once caught safely inside an autophagosome, the autophagosomal double membrane restricts pathogen dispersal and provides an additional barrier against potential attempts of pathogens to manipulate cellular processes. The autophagosomal membranes furthermore separate pathogens from cytosolic resources and promote their lysosomal delivery. The ability of macroautophagy to restrict bacteria from colonizing the host cytosol has been demonstrated for Streptococcus pyogenes [13] and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [14] .\n\nBacteria-engulfing autophagosomes are created by the core autophagy machinery and have features similar to conventional autophagosomes [15] . Certain differences nevertheless exist, for example the ability to engulf very large cargo such as chains of Streptococcus pyogenes.\n\nFormation of such giant autophagosomes requires the involvement of Rab7 at early steps of autophagosome formation [16] , which contrasts its role in canonical macroautophagy where Rab7 primarily participates in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes [17] . Antibacterial autophagosomes also have the tendency to enwrap their cargo into onion-like membrane layers [16, 18, 19] , although the origin and functional importance of these structures remain uncertain.\n\nSelective autophagy of cellular cargo and invading pathogens are related processes and, unsurprisingly, follow similar principles. Selective autophagy relies on the tagging of the prospective cargo with specific 'eat-me' signals, which often comprise poly-ubiquitin chains. Similar to protein aggregates that become ubiquitylated before being engulfed by autophagosomes, bacteria that have damaged their vesicular compartments and are exposed to the cytosol, can attract a dense poly-ubiquitin coat [20] . Little is known about the nature of this ubiquitin coat. For example, it remains unknown which bacterial surface protein(s) and / or host protein(s) in the bacterial proximity are ubiquitylated. Of particular interest is the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) that creating the bacterial ubiquitin coat. These ligases likely represent novel pattern recognition or danger receptors. Their identification would enable a rigorous genetic assessment of the importance of the ubiquitin coat for the cell-autonomous antimicrobial defence. The strongest candidate so far is LRSAM1, a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase with leucine-rich repeats required for the autophagy of S. Typhimurium [21] , but whose role in generating the ubiquitin coat has not been established. Additional pattern recognition receptors with proposed or established affinity for peptidoglycan also contribute to anti-bacterial autophagy. PGRP-LE restricts the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in Drosophila, while NOD1 and NOD2 attack Gram-negative and -positive bacteria in human cells, possibly by recruiting ATG16L1 to the site of bacterial entry [22, 23] . Mutant NOD2 alleles, found in some patients with Crohn's disease, fail to antagonize the cytosolic growth of several bacteria, including adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterium associated with ileal Crohn's disease [24, 25] .\n\nAn alternative 'eat-me' signal was recently identified, when the recruitment of galectin-8 to damaged bacteria-containing vesicles was found to restrict the intracellular growth of S.\n\nTyphimurium by triggering autophagy [5] . Galectins are \u03b2-galactoside-binding lectins that accumulate in the cytosol before being secreted in a leader peptide-independent manner [26] . Although galectins bind carbohydrates of certain pathogens with high specificity [27] , S. Typhimurium does not display ligands for galectin-8 [5] . The recruitment of galectin-8 to S. Typhimurium rather depends on the rupture of Salmonella-containing vesicles (SCVs), which exposes host glycans previously hidden inside the vesicles as ligands for galectin-8. Sterile damage to endosomes or lysosomes also recruits galectin-8 to vesicle remnants, as does damage caused by Listeria monocytogenes or Shigella flexneri, two bacteria that actively invade the cytosol as part of their life cycle. Galectin-8 is therefore a danger receptor that, by surveying the integrity of the endo-lysosomal compartment, serves as a versatile sentinel for vesicle-damaging pathogens. The human genome encodes about a dozen galectins, of which galectin-1, galectin-3 and galectin-9 are also recruited to damaged vesicles [5, 28, 29] . The functional consequences of their recruitment to membrane remnants remain to be identified.\n\nThe ubiquitin-and galectin-8-dependent 'eat-me' signals for selective autophagy are detected by adaptor proteins, also known as autophagy or cargo receptors. These receptors deploy LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) to direct cargo to nascent LC3-positive phagophores. LIRs are short \u03b2-strands, often preceded by a stretch of acidic amino acids, that via a W/ FxxL/I consensus motif bind to LC3 / GABARAP family members [30] . P62 (SQSTM1), the best-studied autophagy receptor, selects a variety of ubiquitylated cargos, including protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria, midbody rings and also ubiquitin-coated bacteria for autophagy [18, 30] . In contrast, the p62 paralog NBR1 is not required to restrict the growth of S. Typhimurium [18] , but may contribute to the autophagy attack against S. flexneri [31] . NDP52 was identified in a search for the ubiquitin-binding adaptor of TBK1 [32] , a major immunoregulatory kinase that restricts the intracellular growth of S. Typhimurium and S. pyogenes [33] . NDP52 recruits TBK1 in complex with SINTBAD or NAP1 to cytosol-exposed bacteria by detecting either a galectin-8 or a poly-ubiquitin 'eatme' signal [5, 32, 34, 35] . Binding of NDP52 to ubiquitin and galectin-8 is mediated by its C-terminal zinc finger and an adjacent short peptide, respectively, which distinguishes NDP52 as the first autophagy receptor that responds to two types of 'eat-me' signals [5] . A third cargo receptor, optineurin, that also detects ubiquitin-coated S. Typhimurium, binds LC3 with high affinity only if phosphorylated by TBK1 because it lacks the negatively charged residues preceding the LIR motif in other autophagy receptors [3] .\n\nUnderstanding the non-redundant contributions of NDP52, p62 and Optineurin to antibacterial autophagy will be an interesting objective for future research. The three receptors clearly differ in their ability to detect unique 'eat-me' signals associated with S.\n\nTyphimurium, such as galectin-8 and possibly distinct linkage types in the bacterial ubiquitin coat [3] . Differential interactions with 'eat-me' signals are likely to cause the occurrence of NDP52, p62 and Optineurin in microdomains around S. Typhimurium, populated by either NDP52 or p62 [36] , NDP52 and Optineurin but not p62 [3] , or NDP52 and galectin-8 but not p62 [5] . However, care must be taken when analyzing microdomains, since these are dynamic structures as suggested by the recruitment of NDP52 to S.\n\nTyphimurium via galectin-8 and ubiquitin at early and later time points post infection, respectively [5] .\n\nAnother feature distinguishing NDP52, p62 and Optineurin from each other might be their ability to selectively recruit different effector molecules for the restriction of bacterial growth. Such evidence has already been obtained for TBK1, which is bound by optineurin and (indirectly) by NDP52 but not by p62 [32, 37] . A specific function of p62 might be the delivery of ubiquitylated cytosolic proteins to autolysosomes, where they are proteolytically converted into anti-microbial peptides [38, 39] . None of the many other p62 binding partners has an established role in anti-bacterial autophagy. However, for the selective autophagy of ubiquitylated protein aggregates p62 recruits ALFY, a 400kDa protein that binds ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complexes and PtdIns(3)P-containing membranes. ALFY may therefore be also required for anti-bacterial autophagy [40] . The potential recruitment of ATG proteins other than LC3 and its paralogs by the cargo receptors might explain how atg5 \u2212/\u2212 or atg7 \u2212/\u2212 cells form autophagosome-like structure around S. Typhimurium despite not being able to conjugate LC3 onto membranes [15, 18] . These LC3-negative structures are not restricting bacterial growth, possibly because the closure of anti-bacterial autophagosomes requires ATG8 paralog-dependent hemifusion activity [7, 41] . In contrast to cells deficient in the LC3-conjugation machinery, cells lacking ATG9 or FIP200 fail to enclose S. Typhimurium in autophagosomal membranes. However, despite the absence of such membranes, atg9 \u2212/\u2212 or fip200 \u2212/\u2212 cells still accumulate LC3 around the bacteria, probably by conjugating LC3 to the damaged SCV membrane [15] . The current model of anti-bacterial autophagy, in which NDP52, p62 and Optineurin link bacteria to LC3-positive phagophores, is therefore simplistic and further work is required to understand how distinct autophagy proteins are independently recruited to cytosol-exposed bacteria.\n\nLC3 conjugated to PE, an invariant feature of canonical macroautophagy, can also occur on single-membrane vesicles. In a process called LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), LC3 is recruited to certain phagosomes, for example those containing bacteria, where it promotes phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes to enhance the anti-microbial potential of phagocytosis [42] . LAP requires several proteins that are also involved in canonical autophagy (BECLIN-1, VPS34, ATG5, ATG7) but not others, such as for example FIP200, a component of the ULK1 kinase complex necessary for macroautophagy [42, 43] . Canonical macroautophagy and LAP are therefore distinct processes, both morphologically and mechanistically, that nevertheless result in the accumulation of LC3 on vesicles. The two pathways may even operate simultaneously and electron microscopy is therefore required to distinguish them with confidence. For example, upon treatment with rapamycin or IFN\u03b3 mycobacterial phagosomes acquire LC3 and mature into phagolysosomes, consistent with LAP [44] . However, electron microscopy revealed the simultaneous presence of additional onion-like multilamellar structures typical for canonical macroautophagy against bacterial targets.\n\nConsistent with autophagy overcoming the maturation block of mycobacterial autophagosomes and leading to enhanced bacterial killing [44] , experimental interference with the delivery of LC3 to phagosomes may prevent the killing of phagocytosed microbes, as demonstrated for yeast in atg7 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages [42] . A similar strategy is used by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacterium causing melioidosis, which suppresses LAP by secreting BopA and BpsnN into the macrophage cytosol via its type III secretion apparatuses [45] [46] [47] . How BopA and BspnN interfere with LAP remains unknown. Recruitment of LC3 to microbe-containing phagosomes requires TLR signalling from within the vesicle, rather than from the cell surface, as evidenced by the lack of LC3 conjugation to phagocytosed latex beads if cells are exposed to LPS subsequent to the phagocytic event [42] . Opsonization can replace TLR signalling and reactive oxygen species produced by NADPH oxidases appear required for the targeting of LC3 to phagosomes [48] , which could result from autophagosome fusion with phagosomes or from direct coupling of LC3 to the phagosomal membrane. The generation of diacylglycerol on Salmonella-containing vacuoles also triggers recruitment of LC3, most likely during LAP, although macroautophagy has not been formally excluded [49] .\n\nThe ability of cells to distinguish phagosomes with 'innocent' and 'infectious' content may allow the preferential handling of infectious vesicles. In striking contrast to the skill of macrophages to ignore phagocytosed latex beads, macropinosomes and also whole cells in entotic vesicles can be targeted by LC3 [43] . How the engulfment of non-infectious cargo triggers LAP requires further investigations, although cells in entotic vacuoles may expose phosphatidylserine before showing morphological signs of cell death. The phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4, which triggers LAP in response to dead cells, may therefore be involved [43] . Experimentally curtailing the degradative potential of phagosomes containing dead cells, for example by preventing LAP in atg7 \u2212/\u2212 macrophages, leads to prolonged macrophage activation and sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [43] . Therefore, in addition to its antimicrobial importance, LAP also contributes to the anti-inflammatory potential of macrophages.\n\nAnother autophagosome-independent defence pathway requiring at least one autophagy gene, atg5, occurs in Toxoplasma gondii-infected macrophages stimulated with IFN\u03b3, where upon ATG5-mediated recruitment of the immunity-related p47 GTPase IIGP1 the parasitophorus vacuole is destroyed and the parasite killed [50] .\n\nThese studies suggest that the autophagy machinery contributes to the defence against pathogens in a variety of ways, either by conventional macroautophagy or by deploying subsets of autophagy genes to accomplish the subcellular trafficking of proteins or the maturation of organelles.\n\nThe ability of cells to defend themselves against invading pathogens represents an ancient form of immunity preceding the origin of multicellularity. In mammals, in which ironically cell-autonomous immunity is best studied, several lines of defence provide synergistic protection against incoming pathogens. With respect to macroautophagy and LAP, at least three classes of receptors detect invaders and ensure their delivery to the lysosome: i) extracellular and endosomal pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), ii) danger receptors surveying the integrity of the endo-lysosomal pathway such as galectin-8, and iii) cytosolic pattern recognition receptors such as NOD-like receptors (NLRs). While non-invasive bacteria, for example environmental bacteria phagocytosed by lung macrophages will be safely destroyed, it is obvious how defects in certain defence mechanisms can favour opportunistic pathogens. Pathogens that invade the cytosol as part of their normal life cycle, however, have to slip through all the nets. Much can therefore be learnt from studying how professional cytosol-dwelling pathogens avoid and inhibit cellautonomous defence.\n\nListeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive food-born pathogen that causes meningitis in immunocompromised individuals and abortion in pregnant woman, is internalized by many cells types. Using a pore-forming toxin and two lipolytic enzymes, L. monocytogenes escapes from its vacuole into the cytosol with high efficiency. Vacuolar damage by L. monocytogenes is detected by Galectin-3, -8, and -9, which may trigger autophagy as bacteria transiently colocalize with LC3 during invasion [5, 28, 29, 51] . However, since autophagy merely delays the onset of proliferation, L. monocytogenes appears to actively escape the autophagic attack [52] . Once in the cytosol L. monocytogenes deploys ActA, a cell surface protein and functional analog of host WASP proteins, for the recruitment of the actin-nucleating complex Arp2/3. Actin-driven mobility, a feature of many cytosol-dwelling bacteria, favours the spreading of bacteria into neighbouring host cells without exposure to extracellular immune effectors. ActA prevents the coating of L. monocytogenes with ubiquitin and thereby interferes with cargo receptor-mediated selective autophagy, possibly because ActA-recruited host proteins disguise the bacterial surface [20, 53] . InlK, an internalin family member expressed mainly in vivo, similarly conceals the presence of L. monocytogenes from autophagy by coating the bacterial surface with MVP, the major component of large cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complexes called vaults [54] . In contrast to mammals, where L. monocytogenes colonizes the cytosol with the help of ActA and InlK, in Drosophila L. monocytogenes falls prey to autophagy due to the presence of PGRP-LE, a cytosolic peptidoglycan receptor [22] . How PGRP-LE triggers autophagy and whether it is a LIR motif-containing autophagy receptor remains unknown. The vertebrate PGRP orthologs, called PGLYRPs, are unlikely to be involved in autophagy since they function extracellularly as peptidoglycan amidases and antimicrobial proteins. Nevertheless, recognition of peptidoglycan fragments still contributes to autophagy induction in mammalian cells since NOD1 and NOD2, the founding members of the NLR family, recruit ATG16L1 to bacterial entry sites [55] .\n\nIn addition to its cytosolic life style associated with extensive proliferation, L. monocytogenes also occupies a vesicular compartment, termed spacious Listeria-containing phagosomes (SLAPs). Bacteria in SLAPs proliferate at a much lower pace, which may be associated with persistent infections [14] . SLAPs are single membrane vesicles positive for LC3 that are formed in a listeriolysin O-dependent manner, preferentially if toxin levels are suboptimal for bacterial escape into the cytosol. Although the contribution of autophagy to SLAP formation, possibly via the LAP pathway, is not fully understood, SLAPs clearly represent a stalemate between autophagic attack and bacterial countermeasures since bacterial hyperproliferation occurs in atg5 \u2212/\u2212 cells.\n\nShigella flexneri is a Gram-negative, entero-invasive bacterium that can cause severe colonic inflammation. Shigella enforces its uptake into non-phagocytic cells with the help of a type III secretion system, before escaping from its vacuole into the cytosol. NOD1 and ATG16L1 are recruited to the bacterial entry site [55] , while the membrane remnants of Shigella vacuoles are detected by galectins-3, -8, and -9, similar to the situation in Listeriainfected cells [5, 28, 29] . The membrane remnants furthermore co-distribute with ubiquitin-, p62-and LC3-positive structures, suggesting that they are targeted by selective autophagy [28] . Once in the cytosol, Shigella deploys the autotransporter IcsA to recruit N-WASP and Arp2/3, which provide the bacterium with actin-dependent cytosolic mobility and the ability to spread from cell to cell. However, IcsA and its biochemical activity are also targets of cell-autonomous defence mechanisms. IcsA is directly recognized by ATG5, which, unless outcompeted by IcsB, restricts bacterial growth by targeting bacteria into autophagosomes [19] . Septins, a family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal components, prevent actin-dependent mobility and cell-to-cell spread by forming cages around Shigella in an IcsA-and actin polymerization-dependent manner [56] . Septin-encaged Shigella colocalize with NDP52, p62 and LC3, suggesting they are targeted by selective autophagy. A positive feedback between septin cage formation and autophagy exists, because depletion of SEPT2 or SEPT9 prevents p62 recruitment, while depletion of p62 or core autophagy genes (atg5, atg6/ beclin-1, atg7) interferes with the entrapment of Shigella in septin cages. The ability of S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes to proliferate in the mammalian cytosol, despite facing a multipronged immune attack, suggests the existence of potent bacterial countermeasures that deserve to be elucidated.\n\nContrary to the mere avoidance of autophagy practiced by L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri, other bacteria take actively advantage of the unique opportunities autophagy offers to pathogens able to co-opt the pathway. These possibilities include the generation of vesicular compartments to sustain bacterial replication and to allow unorthodox trafficking.\n\nRather than being restricted by autophagy, a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of bacteria proliferate in double-or multilamellar LC3 + vesicles, which most likely represent canonical autophagosomes failing to acidify and mature. Examples include Staphyloccus areus [57, 58] , Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [59] , Yersinia pestis [60] and Anaplasma phagocytophilum [61] . Except for Y. pestis, which is impervious to the effects of autophagy, these species fail to grow in atg5 \u2212/\u2212 cells, while autophagy induction by rapamycin enhances their proliferation. How these bacteria co-opt autophagy and how autophagy contributes to bacterial growth remains unknown.\n\nBrucella abortus and Francisella tularensis deploy autophagy not to foster their proliferation but to travel in an unorthodox manner within and out of their host cells. B. abortus resides in the endosomal pathway for several hours post infection before acquiring ER markers including membrane-bound ribosomes. Proliferation begins once the ER-derived Brucellacontaining vacuole (BCV) is established. Bacterial spreading from cell-to-cell requires conversion of the replicative BCV into an autophagosome-like structure comprising multiple membranes but lacking LC3 [62] . Consistent with these features, formation of multilamellar BCVs is independent of atg4, atg7, atg5 and atg16l1 but requires upstream autophagy genes, namely ulk1, beclin-1 and atg14l. LC3 negative double-membrane structures, formed in an ATG5-independent fashion, also engulf Mycobacterium marinum, an actin-polymerizing and therefore professionally cytosol-dwelling species [63] . Conceivably, LC3 negative autophagosomes can be formed if bacteria selectively engage only a subset of autophagy genes and they may represent a physiological pendant to 'alternative' autophagy in atg5 \u2212/\u2212 or atg7 \u2212/\u2212 cells [64] .\n\nF. tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium that was once included in biological warfare programs, replicates in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, suggesting it avoids autophagy. Following replication, however, F. tularensis is taken up into large double-membrane vacuoles, which measure up to 15\u03bcm in diameter, are positive for LC3 and contain multiple bacteria [65] . While the replication of F. tularensis is not dependent on autophagy, exposure to the low pH of autolysosomes may trigger the expression of genes required for egress, reinfection or extracellular life. Understanding how F. tularensis switches from a state in which it avoids autophagy to a state in which it induces autophagy could give important insights into the mechanisms of antibacterial autophagy.\n\nShortly after the discovery of autophagosomes by electron microscopy [66] , autophagosome-like vesicles were noticed in poliovirus infected cells [67] . Infection with this picornavirus leads to the accumulation of small double-membrane surrounded vesicles in the perinuclear area of infected cells, on which the virus assembles its replication machinery. These vesicles contain cytosol, the lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and ATG8/LC3 [68] . While the two poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A induce this vesicle accumulation, only 2BC is required to lipidate ATG8/LC3. This extensive membrane reorganization seems to be required for virus production, because down-regulation of macroautophagy via siRNA mediated silencing of either of the two ubiquitin-like molecules of macroautophagy, ATG12 or ATG8/LC3A and B, results in diminished virus replication [69] . Thus, poliovirus seems to use at least parts of the macroautophagy machinery to assemble membrane structures for its replication.\n\nIn addition to poliovirus, many other RNA viruses have been suggested to interfere with membrane trafficking via the molecular machinery of macroautophagy [70] . However, for most of these viruses the relevance of this regulation for their replication is still unresolved and in the case of coronaviruses even controversial [71, 72] . Thus we focus in this section on one other virus, which induces significant membrane remodelling for its replication and uses macroautophagy to do so. This is the hepatitis C (HCV) flavivirus. The autophagic vesicles that accumulate in HCV-infected hepatocytes fuse with each other and do not accumulate as a multitude of small autophagosomes as observed in poliovirus infected cells [73] . Both ATG5 and ATG8/LC3 accumulate at the stabilized membrane structures, which was suggested to result from a virus-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) [74] . This hypothesis is consistent with macroautophagy induction by UPRs in yeast, which is thought to degrade expanded ER to return affected cells to the physiological equilibrium [75] . In addition, the HCV NS3 protein interacts with the immunity-associated GTPase family M (IRGM), which in turn interacts with ATG5, ATG10, ATG8/LC3 and endophilin-1 (SH3GLB1) [76] . RNA silencing of several essential atg products, namely ATG4, ATG5, ATG6/BECLIN-1, ATG7, ATG8/LC3 and ATG12, as well as IRGM, suppressed HCV replication [74, 76, 77] . Primarily, translation of HCV RNA, shortly after infection seemed to depend on functional macroautophagy machinery [77] . Therefore, HCV also prevents fusion of autophagic membranes with lysosomes to promote its own replication.\n\nIn addition to this membrane remodelling for viral replication another flavivirus, Dengue virus, generates energy for its replication via macroautophagy [78] . This catabolic activity leads to the turnover of lipid droplets and triglycerides via autophagosomes, generating free fatty acids, from which ATP can be generated to benefit viral replication. Thus, autophagy does not only generate membrane compartments for viral replication, but also in part the energy necessary to carry out virus production.\n\nIn addition to viral replication on autophagic membranes, macroautophagy is involved in the generation of vesicular structures, from which viruses are exported. This was hypothesized initially for poliovirus [69] . Indeed, release of this virus is increased if tethering of these autophagic vesicles to the cytoskeleton was inhibited [79] . In this respect we will discuss two other viruses of interest to human health, namely the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus. Both block autophagosome maturation in infected cells [80, 81] . In addition, HIV down-regulates autophagosome formation [82, 83] , while influenza boosts autophagic flux under certain circumstances [84, 85] . HIV tat and IL-10, produced by infected cells, have both been implicated in auto-and paracrine inhibition of autophagosome formation [83] , whereas HIV nef is involved in blocking autophagosome fusion with lysosomes [80] . Interestingly, it achieves this through interaction with ATG6/BECLIN-1 and IRGM [76, 80] . This stabilization of autophagic vesicles, autophagosomes themselves or multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that receive input from autophagosomes, augments virus production and release of infectious particles [76, 80] . RNA silencing of ATG6/BECLIN-1, ATG7 or IRGM inhibits HIV particle release [76, 80] . These studies suggest that HIV inhibits autophagosome degradation in order to efficiently replicate in myeloid cells.\n\nWhile influenza A virus also causes autophagosome accumulation [76, 81] , it remains unclear how this affects virus replication. While one study observed inhibition of influenza A virus replication upon RNA silencing of ATG6/BECLIN-1 and ATG8/LC3 [84] , two other studies reported no effect of silencing or deficiency of ATG5 on macroautophagy [76, 81] . However, the influenza A virus protein matrix protein 2 (M2) blocks autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and interacts with ATG6/BECLIN-1 [81] . This block of autophagosome maturation causes more cell death in infected cells, which could facilitate influenza A virus infection in vivo. Thus, HIV and influenza A virus both block autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, but one virus seems to benefit from this block for its own replication, while the other regulates host cell death via this manipulation.\n\nIrrespective of the underlying mechanism, macroautophagy plays a crucial role for viral replication and protection from viral pathogenesis in vivo for a number of RNA and DNA viruses. The RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicates better in flies in the absence of macroautophagy [86] . In addition, the RNA virus Sindbis virus replicates to similar levels in macroautophagy deficient neurons, but causes more pathology in ATG5 negative brains [87] , suggesting that macroautophagy ensures survival of infected host cells in vivo. Furthermore, the two DNA viruses of the herpesvirus family herpes simplex (HSV) and mouse herpesvirus (MHV) 68 encode inhibitors of macroautophagy, without which their infection in mice is compromised [88, 89] . Along these lines HSV carries with ICP34.5 a viral gene product that binds ATG6/Beclin-1 and prevents thereby autophagosome formation [88] . Furthermore, MHV blocks ATG3 and ATG6/Beclin-1 with its viral FLIP and Bcl-2 gene products, respectively [89, 90] . Interestingly, especially the neurovirulence of both Sindbis virus and HSV is compromised by macroautophagy. For these two viruses p62/sequestosome and possibly its recruitment via SMURF1 have been implicated in the recruitment of these pathogens to autophagosomes [4, 87] . These studies suggest that macroautophagy can target viral particles and proteins. However, as with bacterial pathogens successful viruses that cause disease have developed immune escape mechanisms from macroautophagy in their respective hosts. Since all viruses have a cytosolic stage of their replication cycle, most of them manipulate autophagosome formation or degradation. Because these escape mechanisms are host species adapted the strongest protective effects of macroautophagy can be observed in experimental hosts like for example in the case of the bird and moscito adapted Sindbis virus in mice.\n\nBesides this direct role of macroautophagy in pathogen restriction, macroautophagy was also shown to influence innate cytokine production, although so far the contribution of this regulation to resistance or susceptibility to pathogens has not been firmly established. Along these lines macroautophagy can transport viral replication intermediates into endosomes that carry TLRs [91] . TLR mediated type I interferon production of Sendai virus or VSV infected plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) depended on macroautophagy. In contrast, parts of the molecular macroautophagy machinery seem to inhibit type I interferon production following cytosolic RNA sensor stimulation [92, 93] . Increased reactive oxygen species production or the ATG5-ATG12 complex itself seemed to inhibit RIG-I activation. In addition to type I interferon, IL-1 production is also influenced by macroautophagy. Macrophages deficient in this pathway secrete much more of this proinflammatory cytokine upon stimulation [94] . In part this enhanced IL-1 production results from inflammasome activation by damaged mitochondria, which are no longer degraded by this pathway [95] , and decreased infllammasome degradation via autophagosomes [96] . These studies suggest that macroautophagy regulates at least some inflammatory cytokines, which restrict pathogens by innate immune responses and shape adaptive immune responses.\n\nBoth humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses hinge on the efficient induction of helper T cell responses, which play an essential role in antibody affinity maturation and cytotoxic T cell maintenance. Helper T cells recognize antigen fragments presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are predominantly generated by lysosomal hydrolysis. Around 20-30% of the MHC class II presented ligands are derived from cytosolic and nuclear antigens [97] , suggesting an intracellular antigen processing pathway for MHC class II loading. Among these ligands, self-protein derived peptides can be found, some of which originate from the mammalian ATG8 homologues LC3 and GABARAP [97, 98] . Further evidence that macroautophagy contributes to MHC class II loading of cytosolic and nuclear antigens was provided by the characterization of the MHC class II derived natural ligand repertoire of starved Epstein Barr virus (EBV) transformed B cells (LCLs) [97] . LCLs up-regulate macroautophagy after starvation, and under these conditions MHC class II presentation of cytosolic and nuclear antigens was upregulated by 50%, while presentation of membrane-bound protein fragments was not affected. Furthermore, autophagosomes have been found to frequently fuse with late endosomal MHC class II containing compartments (MIICs), in which antigen is loaded onto MHC class II molecules [99, 100] (Figure 3) . Moreover, targeting of antigens to autophagosomes via fusion to the N-terminus of ATG8/LC3 enhances their presentation on MHC class II molecules to CD4 + T cells [85, 99] . These studies suggest that autophagosomes deliver intracellular substrates for MHC class II loading in a wide variety of cell types, including DCs, B cells and epithelial cells.\n\nIn addition to self-proteins, this antigen processing pathway has been suggested to deliver pathogen-derived antigens for MHC class II loading. Two of these have been investigated in more detail in several studies. The first is the nuclear antigen 1 of EBV (EBNA1). This protein ensures replication of the viral genome in the nucleus prior to host cell division and anchors EBV DNA to mitotic chromosomes during mitosis to ensure viral maintenance in replicating cells. It carries a glycine-alanine repeat domain that protects it from proteasomal degradation [101, 102] , and accumulates upon lysosomal inhibition [103] . In addition, it is presented to CD4 + T cells after intracellular processing [104] . This processing is mediated by macroautophagy, because EBNA1 accumulates in autophagosomes after lysosomal inhibition, and RNA silencing of macroautophagy decreases CD4 + T cell recognition of EBV-infected B cells [103, 105] . This intracellular antigen processing of EBNA1 for MHC class II presentation via macroautophagy is enhanced, when the nuclear import of EBNA1 is compromised [105] . These studies suggest that a cytosolic pool of EBNA1, either prior to import into the nucleus or liberated after dissociation of the nuclear envelope during mitosis gains access to intracellular MHC class II antigen processing by macroautophagy. A second antigen for macroautophagic processing towards MHC class II presentation to CD4 + T cells is the bacterial transposon-derived neomycin phosphotransferase II (NeoR) [85, 106] . MHC class II presentation of this antigen by transfected cells to a specific CD4 + T cell clone is sensitive to macroautophagy inhibition [106] , and antigens fused to NeoR are more efficiently presented on MHC class II molecules [85] . In contrast to EBNA1, however, nuclear localization of NeoR after insertion of a nuclear import sequence does not compromise macroautophagy dependent antigen processing, and was even found to slightly improve MHC class II presentation [107] . Thus, it is not nuclear localization in general, but maybe subcompartimentalization in this organelle that determines accessibility of antigens to macroautophagic antigen processing for MHC class II presentation.\n\nIn addition to intracellular antigen processing, macroautophagy might also play a role in extracellular antigen processing for MHC class II presentation. This suggestion is based on a study in mice with macroautophagy deficiency after atg5 knock-out in CD11c positive cells, (mostly DCs) [108] . In addition to diminished CD4 + T cell responses after herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in these mice, addition of soluble ovalbumin (OVA) or OVA coated splenocytes resulted in decreased MHC class II, but unaffected MHC class I presentation to specific TCR transgenic T cells. Thus the authors suggested that in addition to intracellular antigen processing for MHC class II presentation after HSV or recombinant listeria virus infection, macroautophagy also contributes to extracellular antigen processing for CD4 + T cell stimulation. This correlated with diminished maturation of phagosomes, possibly resulting from slower fusion with lysosomes. This phenotype would fit with three studies showing a role for parts of the macroautophagy machinery in phagosome fusion with lysosomes (LAP), suggesting ATG8/LC3 dependent facilitation of this fusion event [42, 43, 109] . Alternatively, autophagosome cargo could render phagosomes more processive by delivering hydrolases to these vesicles through fusion. Along these lines it was recently shown that citrullination, a post-translational modification detected on some autoantigens and facilitating their immune recognition, for example during rheumatoid arthritis, depends on macroautophagy [110] . More specifically, the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) responsible for citrullination of endocytosed proteins, was only able to reach phagosomes via autophagosomes. Therefore, fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes and composition of phagosomal content could be modified by macroautophagy to result in more efficient extracellular antigen processing onto MHC class II molecules.\n\nAnother physiological setting, in which antigen processing via macroautophagy might be particularly important is T cell education in the thymus. In order to shape a useful and selftolerant T cell repertoire, developing T cells are educated to recognize self-MHC molecules in the thymic cortex in a process called positive selection. In addition, self-reactive T cell specificities are eliminated in the thymic medulla via negative selection [111] . Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) interact with the developing T cells in these two processes and express both MHC class I and II molecules for this purpose. In order to display peptides not just derived from thymic proteins during these processes, TECS also express at low levels peripheral organ specific proteins with the help of the transcription factor autoimmune regulator (AIRE) [112] . However, for processing of these proteins towards MHC class II presentation it was suggested that TECs require intracellular pathways, because they are poorly endocytic [113] . Along these lines a role for macroautophagy in both of these processes was then defined [114] . During positive selection of T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells in atg5-deficient thymii, some CD4 + T cell specificities were efficiently selected, while positive selection of others was compromised, probably due to insufficient MHC class II presentation of the positively selecting peptide ligands. In contrast, positive CD8 + T cell selection was unaffected. In contrast, negative selection of a wild-type precursor repertoire through atg5-negative thymic transplants in thymus-deficient nude mice resulted in autoreactive T cells, causing autoimmune colitis and lymphocyte infiltration in other organs, including Hardarian glands, uterus, liver and lung. In agreement with these findings, autophagosomes were found to frequently fuse with MIICs in TECs [115] . These findings suggest that intracellular proteins are presented on MHC class II molecules of TECs after macroautophagy, and that the T cell repertoire is altered in the absence of this process. Of particular interest is the fact that such an altered T cell repertoire contains specificities that mediate autoimmune colitis, reminiscent in its manifestation of Crohn's disease. Indeed mutations have been found associated with the familial form of this autoimmune disease of the digestive tract in two proteins linked to macroautophagy, namely ATG16L1 and IRGM [116] [117] [118] [119] . Furthermore, the Crohn's disease associated ATG16L1 variants were shown to compromise MHC class II restricted antigen presentation of DCs matured with NOD2 ligands [24] , and NOD2 is another risk locus for this disease [120, 121] . Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that also in humans compromised macroautophagy in the thymus might allow the development of an autoimmune T cell repertoire that could contribute to Crohn's disease.\n\nIn addition to this antigen processing function of macroautophagy that shapes lymphocyte repertoires, this pathway plays also a role during lymphocyte development and responses. Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) rely on this process for their maintenance [122, 123] . In its absence myeloproliferation develops, seemingly because both T and B cell lineage development is compromised. In contrast, plasmacytoid and conventional DC development is unaffected by loss of macroautophagy [91, 108] . Both T cell development and proliferation during an immune responses are compromised in the absence of macroautophagy [124] . Several mechanisms are responsible for these T cell defects in the absence of macroautophagy. For one, mature T cells need to decrease their mitochondria content during transition from the thymus to the periphery. Macroautophagy deficiency prevents this due to loss of mitochondria degradation. This leads to increased levels of reactive oxygen species, which compromises the survival of T cells without macroautophagy [125] . In addition, macroautophagy-deficient T cells cannot efficiently mobilize Ca 2+ upon T cell receptor stimulation, resulting in impaired activation [126] . Therefore, macroautophagy is required for T cell development and function. A less severe, but also detectable dependency of B cell development and maintenance on macroautophagy was identified. B cell precursor survival in the bone marrow is affected by loss of macroautophagy, particularly at the pro-to pre-B cell transition [127, 128] . Mature B cells, in contrast, are mostly unaffected by macroautophagy loss for their survival. Only the innate B-1a subset is compromised in its maintenance by macroautophagy deficiency [128] . Therefore, lymphocytes, but not leucocytes in general, need macroautophagy for their development and survival. Selective lymphocyte lineages are more affected than others by macroautophagy deficiency, and the role of macroautophagy in cell organelle homeostasis, primarily mitochondria and ER turnover, is required during lymphocyte development and their immune responses.\n\nAutophagy, particularly macroautophagy, has emerged as an important cellular pathway for pathogen restriction and replication as well as antigen processing. Recent studies show how pathogens that escape endosomes are imported into autophagosomes and how pathogens adapted to life in the cytosol have evolved escape mechanisms from macroautophagic degradation. In its co-evolution with pathogens, the adaptive immune system of higher eukaryotes has also learned to utilize macroautophagy. Autophagy provides peptides for presentation on MHC molecules from self-antigens and pathogens during thymic selection and during peripheral immune responses, respectively. Therefore, as with classical phagocytosis, macroautophagy has evolved from a nutrient-providing pathway to fulfil additional effector mechanisms of innate, cell-intrinsic and adaptive immunity in higher eukaryotes.\n\nThe role of the molecular macroautophagy machinery during infection and immune responses may extend even further. At least some ATG proteins are involved in phagocytosis by modulating phagosome maturation and in exocytosis of signal-peptide lacking substrates [129] [130] [131] , possibly even whole virions and exosomes [132, 133] . This alternative use of macroautophagy modules needs to be better understood in order to harness pathogen restriction by macroautophagy therapeutically without boosting pathogen replication.\n\nFurthermore, macroautophagy plays a role in MHC class II ligand generation for T cell education and intracellular antigen processing for CD4 + T cell recognition. In addition, this pathway might also influence the compartimentalization of antigen to vesicles or protein aggregates, which allow processing towards MHC class I presentation for CD8 + T cell responses [134] [135] [136] . The nature of these MHC class I antigen compartments and how macroautophagy regulates them needs to be more clearly defined in order to use them for efficient induction of immune responses after vaccination.\n\nThe importance of canonical macroautophagy in pathogen infection and immune responses is now well established. Alternative deployment of parts of the macroautophagy machinery seems to impact on an even wider spectrum of cell biological processes for the benefit or restriction of invading microbes. These later areas, in particular, constitute a fruitful field of investigation for the near future.\n\nAutophagosomes are formed with the help of two ubiquitin-like systems (ATG8/LC3 and ATG12) and their formation and degradation is guided by phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase complexes. The ATG8/LC3 ligase complex ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1 conjugates ATG8/LC3 to the isolation membrane or phagophore and is then recycled from the outer autophagosomal membrane with ATG8/LC3. Upon fusion with lysosomes the inner autophagosomal membrane and its content, including pathogens, is degraded. Viruses interfere with this process and either block autophagosome formation or degradation by interacting with ATG6/Beclin-1, which is contained in autophagosome forming PI3 kinase complexes (VPS34 as PI3 kinase, VPS15, ATG6/BECLIN-1 and ATG14L) and autophagosome degrading (VPS34, VPS15, ATG6/BECLIN-1 and UVRAG) or degradation blocking (VPS34, VPS15, ATG6/BECLIN-1, UVRAG and Rubicon) PI3 kinase complexes.\n\nSynergistic lines of defence prevent the entry of pathogens into the cytosol of host cells. A) LC3-assisted phagocytosis is triggered by TLRs and potentially other PRRs in response to microorganisms that were taken up by phagocytosis or that have actively invaded nonphagocytic cells. LC3-assisted phagocytosis requires a subset of autophagy genes for the labelling of phagosomes with ATG8/LC3, which promotes their lysosomal delivery and the efficient killing of vesicular pathogens. B) Damage to the limiting membrane of the pathogen-containing vesicle, either accidental or caused by pathogens attempting to escape from the vesicle, exposes the cytosol to glycans previously hidden inside the vesicle. C) Cytosol-accessible glycans are detected by the danger receptor galectin-8, which, by recruiting the cargo receptor NDP52, triggers autophagy. D) Pathogens having escaped galectin-8-induced autophagy are met by yet another layer of pattern recognition receptors in the cytosol. E) A yet-to-be-identified E3 ubiquitin ligase causes the ubiquitin-coating of invading bacteria. It remains to be established whether this ligase only targets membraneassociated or also free-floating bacteria, whether it is a pattern-recognition receptor, and also whether its substrate is of bacterial or host origin. F) Ubiquitin-coated bacteria are targeted for autophagy by three apparently non-redundant cargo receptors, i.e. NDP52, p62, and Optineurin.\n\nCytosolic pathogens are delivered to MHC class II containing compartments (MIICs) via macroautophagy for antigen loading. Extracellular pathogens reach this MHC class II loading compartment via endocytosis, which might be in some instances facilitated by ATG8/LC3 coupled to the phagosome."}
