{"title": "Lack of maternal\u2013fetal SARS-CoV-2 transmission", "body": "Lancet 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3 (2020)\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus produces the same clinical symptoms in pregnant women as it does other infected people, and there is currently no evidence for vertical transmission.\n\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been declared a global public-health emergency by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and the disease can lead to death; however, it is unknown whether pregnant women have specific support needs after infection and, in particular, if there is a risk of vertical transmission to unborn children.\n\nChen et al. studied nine pregnant women with lab-confirmed COVI-19 who were admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. They found that their clinical symptoms were similar to those of non-pregnant adults and that there was no indication of vertical transmission to children, although the findings need to be confirmed in a larger study."}
