{"title": "Network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections1. In the past two decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality2. For example, 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion3,4. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia2. In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2), as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated as COVID-19)5, was found in Wuhan, China. As of 24 February 2020, there have been over 79,000 cases with over 2600 deaths for the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide; furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts6. However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\n\nAlthough investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development has increased significantly over the past two decades, the annual number of new treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has remained relatively constant and limited7. A recent study estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent $2.6 billion in 2015, up from $802 million in 2003, in the development of an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug8. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials9\u201311. However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and time-consuming12. Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning9\u201311,13,14. However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often has high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes1.\n\nViruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replication during infection1. Systematic identification of virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) offers an effective way toward elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection15,16. Subsequently, targeting cellular antiviral targets, such as virus\u2013host interactome, may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viral infections1, including SARS-CoV17, MERS-CoV17, Ebola virus18, and Zika virus14,19\u201321. We recently presented an integrated antiviral drug discovery pipeline that incorporated gene-trap insertional mutagenesis, known functional drug\u2013gene network, and bioinformatics analyses14. This methodology allows to identify several candidate repurposable drugs for Ebola virus11,14. Our work over the last decade has demonstrated how network strategies can, for example, be used to identify effective repurposable drugs13,22\u201327 and drug combinations28 for multiple human diseases. For example, network-based drug\u2013disease proximity sheds light on the relationship between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies13,23,27,28.\n\nIn this study, we present an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology, which combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus\u2013host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) the proteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common PPIs and functional pathways elucidated by the human interactome (Fig. 1). We follow this analysis with bioinformatics validation of drug-induced gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics in human cell lines to inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action in a specific HCoV for which we propose repurposing (Fig. 1).\n\nTo date, seven pathogenic HCoVs (Fig. 2a, b) have been found:1,29 (i) 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are \u03b2 genera, and (ii) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are \u03b1 genera. We performed the phylogenetic analyses using the whole-genome sequence data from 15 HCoVs to inspect the evolutionary relationship of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 with other HCoVs. We found that the whole genomes of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 had ~99.99% nucleotide sequence identity across three diagnosed patients (Supplementary Table S1). The 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity (79.7%) with SARS-CoV among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs, revealing conserved evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 2a).\n\nHCoVs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viral replications29, including replicase complex (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Fig. 2b). The ORF1ab gene encodes the non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral RNA synthesis complex through proteolytic processing30. The nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. From the protein 3D structure view of SARS-CoV nsp12, it contains a larger N-terminal extension (which binds to nsp7 and nsp8) and polymerase domain (Fig. 2c). The spike is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor31,32. Figure 2d shows the 3D structure of the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6ACK). A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 is able to utilize ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells33, suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development. Furthermore, cryo-EM structure of the spike and biophysical assays reveal that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV34. In addition, the nucleocapsid is also an important subunit for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization35, and the single nucleocapsid structure is shown in Fig. 2e.\n\nProtein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was most evolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2). However, the spike protein exhibited the lowest sequence conservation (sequence identity of 77%) between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 only has 31.9% sequence identity compared to MERS-CoV.\n\nTo depict the HCoV\u2013host interactome network, we assembled the CoV-associated host proteins from four known HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), one mouse MHV, and one avian IBV (N protein) (Supplementary Table S3). In total, we obtained 119 host proteins associated with CoVs with various experimental evidence. Specifically, these host proteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucial pathways of HCoV infection. The HCoV\u2013host interactome network is shown in Fig. 3a. We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value < 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and influenza (Fig. 3b). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value < 0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology, viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virion attachment to host cell (Fig. 3c). We then mapped the known drug\u2013target network (see Materials and methods) into the HCoV\u2013host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets. We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Fig. 3a) can be targeted by at least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trials. For example, GSK3B, DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins. The high druggability of HCoV\u2013host interactome motivates us to develop a drug repurposing strategy by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with HCoVs for potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on the notions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern viral infection are localized in the corresponding subnetwork (Fig. 1a) within the comprehensive human interactome network. For a drug with multiple targets to be effective against an HCoV, its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the corresponding subnetwork in the human protein\u2013protein interactome (Fig. 1), as we demonstrated in multiple diseases13,22,23,28 using this network-based strategy. We used a state-of-the-art network proximity measure to quantify the relationship between HCoV-specific subnetwork (Fig. 3a) and drug targets in the human interactome. We constructed a drug\u2013target network by assembling target information for more than 2000 FDA-approved or experimental drugs (see Materials and methods). To improve the quality and completeness of the human protein interactome network, we integrated PPIs with five types of experimental data: (1) binary PPIs from 3D protein structures; (2) binary PPIs from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays; (3) experimentally identified kinase-substrate interactions; (4) signaling networks derived from experimental data; and (5) literature-derived PPIs with various experimental evidence (see Materials and methods). We used a Z-score (Z) measure and permutation test to reduce the study bias in network proximity analyses (including hub nodes in the human interactome network by literature-derived PPI data bias) as described in our recent studies13,28.\n\nIn total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (Z < \u22121.5 and P < 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV\u2013host interactome (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Tables S4 and 5). To validate bias of the pooled cellular proteins from six CoVs, we further calculated the network proximities of all the drugs for four CoVs with a large number of know host proteins, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, and MHV, separately. We found that the Z-scores showed consistency among the pooled 119 HCoV-associated proteins and other four individual CoVs (Fig. 4b). The Pearson correlation coefficients of the proximities of all the drugs for the pooled HCoV are 0.926 vs. SARS-CoV (P < 0.001, t distribution), 0.503 vs. MERS-CoV (P < 0.001), 0.694 vs. IBV (P < 0.001), and 0.829 vs. MHV (P < 0.001). These network proximity analyses offer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs.\n\nAn overexpression of estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication37. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been reported to play a broader role in inhibiting viral replication through the non-classical pathways associated with estrogen receptor37. SERMs interfere at the post viral entry step and affect the triggering of fusion, as the SERMs\u2019 antiviral activity still can be observed in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression18. Toremifene (Z = \u20133.23, Fig. 5a), the first generation of nonsteroidal SERM, exhibits potential effects in blocking various viral infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus in established cell lines17,38. Compared to the classical ESR1-related antiviral pathway, toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein, and eventually inhibiting viral replication39. As shown in Fig. 5b, toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with HCoV, such as RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I, EIF3F, and EIF3E40,41. Equilin (Z = \u20132.52 and GSEA score = 3), an estrogenic steroid produced by horses, also has been proven to have moderate activity in inhibiting the entry of Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein and human immunodeficiency virus (ZEBOV-GP/HIV)18. Altogether, network-predicted SERMs (such as toremifene and equilin) offer candidate repurposable drugs for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAngiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to associate with viral infection, including HCoVs42\u201344. Irbesartan (Z = \u20135.98), a typical ARB, was approved by the FDA for treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between irbesartan\u2019s targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Fig. 5c, irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus inhibiting viral entry45,46. SLC10A1 interacts with C11orf74, a potential transcriptional repressor that interacts with nsp-10 of SARS-CoV47. There are several other ARBs (such as eletriptan, frovatriptan, and zolmitriptan) in which their targets are potentially associated with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome.\n\nPrevious studies have confirmed the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as the key factor in regulating various viruses\u2019 replications, including Andes orthohantavirus and coronavirus48,49. Sirolimus (Z = \u20132.35 and GSEA score = 3), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was reported to effectively block viral protein expression and virion release effectively50. Indeed, the latest study revealed the clinical application: sirolimus reduced MERS-CoV infection by over 60%51. Moreover, sirolimus usage in managing patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure can improve those patients\u2019 prognosis significantly50. Mercaptopurine (Z = \u20132.44 and GSEA score = 1), an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property, has been used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several auto-immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn\u2019s disease52. Mercaptopurine has been reported as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease which plays key roles in viral maturation and antagonism to interferon stimulation53,54. Mechanistically, mercaptopurine potentially target several host proteins in HCoVs, such as JUN, PABPC1, NPM1, and NCL40,55 (Fig. 5d).\n\nInflammatory pathways play essential roles in viral infections56,57. As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = \u20131.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections58,59. Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on the function of multiple organs60. The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients\u2019 clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription61,62. In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients\u2019 survival time, which may provide a chance for patients\u2019 immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Fig. 5e, melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = \u20131.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cell-derived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus63.\n\nIn summary, our network proximity analyses offer multiple candidate repurposable drugs that target diverse cellular pathways for potential prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. However, further preclinical experiments64 and clinical trials are required to verify the clinical benefits of these network-predicted candidates before clinical use.\n\nSirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties, has demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure50. The mTOR signaling plays an essential role for MERS-CoV infection66. Dactinomycin, also known actinomycin D, is an approved RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various cancer types. An early study showed that dactinomycin (1 \u03bcg/ml) inhibited the growth of feline enteric CoV67. As shown in Fig. 6b, our network analysis shows that sirolimus and dactinomycin synergistically target HCoV-associated host protein subnetwork by \u201cComplementary Exposure\u201d pattern, offering potential combination regimens for treatment of HCoV. Specifically, sirolimus and dactinomycin may inhibit both mTOR signaling and RNA synthesis pathway (including DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B)) in HCoV-infected cells (Fig. 6b).\n\nToremifene is among the approved first-generation nonsteroidal SERMs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer68. SERMs (including toremifene) inhibited Ebola virus infection18 by interacting with and destabilizing the Ebola virus glycoprotein39. In vitro assays have demonstrated that toremifene inhibited growth of MERS-CoV17,69 and SARA-CoV38 (Table 1). Emodin, an anthraquinone derivative extracted from the roots of rheum tanguticum, has been reported to have various anti-virus effects. Specifically, emdoin inhibited SARS-CoV-associated 3a protein70, and blocked an interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 (ref. 71). Altogether, network analyses and published experimental data suggested that combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 6c).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5a, targets of both mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease53,54. Melatonin was reported in potential antiviral infection via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects58\u201362. Melatonin indirectly regulates ACE2 expression, a key entry receptor involved in viral infection of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 33). Specifically, melatonin was reported to inhibit calmodulin and calmodulin interacts with ACE2 by inhibiting shedding of its ectodomain, a key infectious process of SARS-CoV72,73. JUN, also known as c-Jun, is a key host protein involving in HCoV infectious bronchitis virus74. As shown in Fig. 6d, mercaptopurine and melatonin may synergistically block c-Jun signaling by targeting multiple cellular targets. In summary, combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential combination therapy for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 by synergistically targeting papain-like protease, ACE2, c-Jun signaling, and anti-inflammatory pathways (Fig. 6d). However, further experimental observations on ACE2 pathways by melatonin in 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are highly warranted.\n\nIn this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification of putative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Integration of drug\u2013target networks, HCoV\u2013host interactions, HCoV-induced transcriptome in human cell lines, and human protein\u2013protein interactome network are essential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16 candidate repurposable drugs (Fig. 5) and 3 potential drug combinations (Fig. 6) for targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. However, although the majority of predictions have been validated by various literature data (Table 1), all network-predicted repurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in various 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 experimental assays64 and randomized clinical trials before being used in patients.\n\nWe acknowledge several limitations in the current study. Although 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shared high nucleotide sequence identity with other HCoVs (Fig. 2), our predictions are not 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 specific by lack of the known host proteins on 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. We used a low binding affinity value of 10 \u03bcM as a threshold to define a physical drug\u2013target interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1 \u03bcM) may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug\u2013target network. Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large scale, experimentally reported drug\u2013target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug\u2013target interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. For example, Silvestrol, a natural product from the flavagline, was found to have antiviral activity against Ebola75 and Coronaviruses76. After adding its target, an RNA helicase enzyme EIF4A76, silvestrol was predicted to be significantly associated with HCoVs (Z = \u20131.24, P = 0.041) by network proximity analysis. To increase coverage of drug\u2013target networks, we may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further25,26. In addition, the collected virus\u2013host interactions are far from completeness and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus\u2013host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 using sequence-based and structure-based approaches77. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles78, as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists vs. agonists). The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic (antiviral) effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virus\u2013host interactions. Comprehensive identification of the virus\u2013host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays79,80, will significantly improve the accuracy of the proposed network-based methodologies further.\n\nOwing to a lack of the complete drug-target information (such as the molecular \u201cpromiscuity\u201d of drugs), the dose\u2013response and dose\u2013toxicity effects for both repurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in the current network models. For example, Mesalazine, an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a top network-predicted repurposable drug associated with HCoVs (Fig. 5a). Yet, several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) associated with mesalazine usage81,82. Integration of lung-specific gene expression23 of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 host proteins and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling83 may reduce side effects of repurposable drugs or drug combinations. Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework28. However, we expect that our methodology remain to be a useful network-based tool for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs\u2019 targets with the HCoV\u2013host subnetwork in the human interactome. Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir64) with the network-predicted repurposable drugs (Fig. 5) or drug combinations (Fig. 6) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework16.\n\nIn conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrative network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other emerging viral infections and other human complex diseases as well.\n\nIn total, we collected DNA sequences and protein sequences for 15 HCoVs, including three most recent 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 genomes, from the NCBI GenBank database (28 January 2020, Supplementary Table S1). Whole-genome alignment and protein sequence identity calculation were performed by Multiple Sequence Alignment in EMBL-EBI database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) with default parameters. The neighbor joining (NJ) tree was computed from the pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix using MEGA X84 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The protein alignment and phylogenetic tree of HCoVs were constructed by MEGA X84.\n\nWe collected HCoV\u2013host protein interactions from various literatures based on our sizeable efforts. The HCoV-associated host proteins of several HCoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, MHV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 were pooled. These proteins were either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or were involved in critical pathways of HCoV infection identified by multiple experimental sources, including high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, viral protein pull-down assay, in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and RNA knock down experiment. In total, the virus\u2013host interaction network included 6 HCoVs with 119 host proteins (Supplementary Table S3).\n\nNext, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to evaluate the biological relevance and functional pathways of the HCoV-associated proteins. All functional analyses were performed using Enrichr85.\n\nHere, we collected drug\u2013target interaction information from the DrugBank database (v4.3)86, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD)87, PharmGKB database, ChEMBL (v20)88, BindingDB89, and IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY90. The chemical structure of each drug with SMILES format was extracted from DrugBank86. Here, drug\u2013target interactions meeting the following three criteria were used: (i) binding affinities, including Ki, Kd, IC50, or EC50 each \u226410 \u03bcM; (ii) the target was marked as \u201creviewed\u201d in the UniProt database91; and (iii) the human target was represented by a unique UniProt accession number. The details for building the experimentally validated drug\u2013target network are provided in our recent studies13,23,28.\n\nTo build a comprehensive list of human PPIs, we assembled data from a total of 18 bioinformatics and systems biology databases with five types of experimental evidence: (i) binary PPIs tested by high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) systems; (ii) binary, physical PPIs from protein 3D structures; (iii) kinase-substrate interactions by literature-derived low-throughput or high-throughput experiments; (iv) signaling network by literature-derived low-throughput experiments; and (v) literature-curated PPIs identified by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS), Y2H, or by literature-derived low-throughput experiments. All inferred data, including evolutionary analysis, gene expression data, and metabolic associations, were excluded. The genes were mapped to their Entrez ID based on the NCBI database92 as well as their official gene symbols based on GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/). In total, the resulting human protein\u2013protein interactome used in this study includes 351,444 unique PPIs (edges or links) connecting 17,706 proteins (nodes), representing a 50% increase in the number of the PPIs we have used previously. Detailed descriptions for building the human protein\u2013protein interactome are provided in our previous studies13,23,28,93.\n\nWe posit that the human PPIs provide an unbiased, rational roadmap for repurposing drugs for potential treatment of HCoVs in which they were not originally approved. Given C, the set of host genes associated with a specific HCoV, and T, the set of drug targets, we computed the network proximity of C with the target set T of each drug using the \u201cclosest\u201d method:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\left\\langle d_{CT} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\vert\\vert C \\vert\\vert +\\vert\\vert T \\vert\\vert}\\left({\\sum\\limits_{c \\in C}} {\\min}_{t \\in T}\\,d\\left( {c,t} \\right) + {\\sum\\limits_{t \\in T}} {\\min}_{c \\in C}\\,d\\left(c,t\\right) \\right),$$\\end{document}dCT=1\u2223\u2223C\u2223\u2223+\u2223\u2223T\u2223\u2223\u2211c\u2208Cmint\u2208Tdc,t+\u2211t\u2208Tminc\u2208Cdc,t,where d(c, t) is the shortest distance between gene c and t in the human protein interactome. The network proximity was converted to Z-score based on permutation tests:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Z_{d_{CT}} = \\frac{{d_{CT} - \\overline {d_r} }}{{\\sigma _r}},$$\\end{document}ZdCT=dCT\u2212dr\u00af\u03c3r,where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\overline {d_r}$$\\end{document}dr\u00af and \u03c3r were the mean and standard deviation of the permutation test repeated 1000 times, each time with two randomly selected gene lists with similar degree distributions to those of C and T. The corresponding P value was calculated based on the permutation test results. Z-score < \u22121.5 and P < 0.05 were considered significantly proximal drug\u2013HCoV associations. All networks were visualized using Gephi 0.9.2 (https://gephi.org/).\n\nFor this network-based approach for drug combinations to be effective, we need to establish if the topological relationship between two drug\u2013target modules reflects biological and pharmacological relationships, while also quantifying their network-based relationship between drug targets and HCoV-associated host proteins (drug\u2013drug\u2013HCoV combinations). To identify potential drug combinations, we combined the top lists of drugs. Then, \u201cseparation\u201d measure SAB was calculated for each pair of drugs A and B using the following method:3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$S_{AB} = \\left\\langle {d_{AB}} \\right\\rangle - \\frac{{\\left\\langle {d_{AA}} \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle {d_{BB}} \\right\\rangle }}{2},$$\\end{document}SAB=dAB\u2212dAA+dBB2,where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\left\\langle {d_ \\cdot } \\right\\rangle$$\\end{document}d\u22c5 was calculated based on the \u201cclosest\u201d method. Our key methodology is that a drug combination is therapeutically effective only if it follows a specific relationship to the disease module, as captured by Complementary Exposure patterns in targets\u2019 modules of both drugs without overlapping toxic mechanisms28.\n\nWe performed the gene set enrichment analysis as an additional prioritization method. We first collected three differential gene expression data sets of hosts infected by HCoVs from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Among them, two transcriptome data sets were SARS-CoV-infected samples from patient\u2019s peripheral blood94 (GSE1739) and Calu-3 cells95 (GSE33267), respectively. One transcriptome data set was MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells96 (GSE122876). Adjusted P value less than 0.01 was defined as differentially expressed genes. These data sets were used as HCoV\u2013host signatures to evaluate the treatment effects of drugs. Differential gene expression in cells treated with various drugs were retrieved from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database36, and were used as gene profiles for the drugs. For each drug that was in both the CMAP data set and our drug\u2013target network, we calculated an enrichment score (ES) for each HCoV signature data set based on previously described methods97 as follows:4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\mathrm {ES}} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\mathrm{ES}_{\\mathrm{up}}} - {\\mathrm {ES}_{\\mathrm{down}}},{\\mathrm {sgn}}\\left( {{\\mathrm {ES}_{\\mathrm{up}}}} \\right)\\, \\ne \\,{\\mathrm {sgn}}\\left( {{\\mathrm {ES}_{\\mathrm{down}}}} \\right)} \\\\ {0,\\mathrm {else}} \\end{array}} \\right.$$\\end{document}ES=ESup\u2212ESdown,sgnESup\u2260sgnESdown0,elseESup and ESdown were calculated separately for the up- and down-regulated genes from the HCoV signature data set using the same method.

The rank of gene j is denoted by V(j), where 1 \u2264 V(j) \u2264 r, with r being the number of genes (12,849) from the drug profile. Then, ESup/down was set to aup/down if aup/down > bup/down, and was set to \u2212bup/down if bup/down > aup/down. Permutation tests repeated 100 times using randomly generated gene lists with the same number of up- and down-regulated genes as the HCoV signature data set were performed to measure the significance of the ES scores. Drugs were considered to have potential treatment effect if ES > 0 and P < 0.05, and the number of such HCoV signature data sets were used as the final GSEA score that ranges from 0 to 3."}
