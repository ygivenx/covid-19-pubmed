{"title": "Kupffer Cell-Dependent Hepatitis Occurs during Influenza Infection", "body": "Influenza infection in humans has been associated with increased serum aminotransaminase levels, but the incidence of this effect and the etiology underlying the liver damage have not been investigated. [1] [2] [3] Immune-mediated hepatitis has been studied in different mouse models; however, most of these experimental systems employ toxins, hepatotrophic pathogens, or systemic antigens to generate immune responses. Although these models of damage are useful for studying the specific immune re-sponses directed toward liver cells, they do not explain hepatic damage during influenza infection of the lung in the absence of viral pathogen in the liver.\n\nIn a model in which T-cell receptor-transgenic CD8 \u03e9 T cells were primed by injection of their specific antigenic peptide, high doses of soluble antigen caused massive CD8 \u03e9 T-cell expansion, 4,5 accompanied by intrahepatic T-cell accumulation, 4 necro-inflammatory foci, and elevated serum aminotransaminase levels. 5 It could be argued that T-cell localization to these livers is a unique side effect of such nonphysiological priming with antigenic peptide and may reflect the local presentation of peptide in the liver. However, during murine influenza infection, virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells have been detected in the liver by flow cytometry, 6 indicating that accumulation is not restricted to peptide-activated transgenic cells. Focal lesions have also been noted in these livers, 6 although their cellular composition and pathogenesis have not been addressed.\n\nInfluenza productively infects only the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract because the virus requires a unique host trypsin-like enzyme to activate the viral hemagglutinin. 7, 8 We have exploited this obligatory localization of virus to the lung as a distinctive approach to explain how an extrahepatic infection can induce bystander hepatitis. This model allows study of interactions between the liver and CD8 \u03e9 T lymphocytes that have responded to infection at a nonhepatic location.\n\nIn C57BL/6 (B6) mice, the antiviral CD8 \u03e9 response is directed mainly toward two epitopes in the nucleoprotein (NP 366 -374 ) and polymerase (PA 224 -232 ) of the virus, 9 which together account for around 30% of the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response. 10 These CD8 epitopes are shared by the serologically distinct influenza A viruses influenza A/HK/ x31 (x31) (H3N2) and influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8 [H1N1]), which induce different antibody responses. Thus, by challenging HKx31-immunized mice with PR8, we were able to study secondary CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses in the absence of a protective antibody response, a phenomenon known as hetero-subtypic immunity. 10, 11 Here, we use this model to promote the expansion of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells, which accumulated in the liver and triggered hepatocyte damage. Through a detailed quantitative and kinetic analysis of this phenomenon, we now provide evidence formally linking influenza-associated liver pathology to the accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and we show that Kupffer cells are essential in this process. Furthermore, the hepatic damage detected in the mouse model by histology and elevated transaminase levels correlated with serological data from a human influenza study. Our findings provide new insight into the etiology of liver damage during influenza infection and offer an explanation for more pronounced liver pathology in other extrahepatic infections like measles and SARS.\n\nFifteen human male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years were experimentally infected intranasally with 10 7 TCID 50 influenza A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) virus and monitored for 2 weeks for the presence of virus, oral temperature, and symptoms. Virus shedding in nasal wash indicated productive infection. All individuals were seronegative for hepatitis A, B, and C virus, and no medications were taken during the course of infection. Informed consent was obtained from all study subjects, and protocols were approved by the University of Rochester institutional review board. C57BL/6 (Thy1.2 \u03e9 ) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), whereas Thy1.1 \u03e9 OT-I, B6.PL (Thy1.1 \u03e9 ), TCR C\u2423 \u03ea/\u03ea (a gift from Dr. Deborah Fowell, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, David H. Smith Center for Vaccine Biology and Immunology/Aab Institute of Biomedical Sciences), and DO11.10 mice were bred in-house. NK-deficient mice 12 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-deficient mice (C57BL/6-Abb \u03ea/\u03ea ) were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY). All mice were maintained in pathogenfree conditions in accordance with guidelines set forth by the University of Rochester Animal Resources Committee. Animals were infected intranasally with 10 5 EID 50 of either influenza A/HKx31 (H3N2) (primary) or the serologically distinct influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (secondary). 13 In OT-I transfer experiments,  mice were intranasally infected with 10 4 plaque-forming  units  of H1N1 recombinant influenza strain A/WSN-OVA I ,  which expresses the SIINFEKL peptide (OVA 257-264 ) within the neuraminidase stalk of the virus. 15 TCR C\u2423 \u03ea/\u03ea mice received 500 pfu of the influenza WSN-OVA 323-339 strain 16 in 30 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1 day after intravenous injection with 2 \u03eb 10 7 splenocytes from DO11.10 mice (which are on a TCR C\u2423 \u03ea/\u03ea background).\n\nSpleen, lymph node, and bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) cells were prepared as described previously. 13 Livers were perfused, excised, and digested as reported. 5 The digest was diluted with 30 ml of serum-free RPMI and centrifuged twice at 30 \u03eb g to remove hepatocytes, followed by a 400 \u03eb g spin to pellet lymphocytes. This pellet was resuspended in 26% metrizamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in RPMI, layered beneath serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C, 1500 \u03eb g. The lymphocyte interface was collected and washed. Single-cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry (using Pharmingen (San Jose, CA) antibodies unless stated). F c receptors were blocked with purified \u2423-CD16/\u2423-CD32, and single-cell suspensions were stained with anti-CD8, anti-CD4 (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), anti-CD45.1, anti-Thy1.1, or anti-Thy1.2 antibody, as stated. Influenza-specific cells were detected with phycoerythrin-conjugated H-2D b MHC class I/NP 366 -374 tetramers 17 (made in collaboration with the Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY). Data were acquired using a FACScalibur cytometer, and analysis was performed using CellQuest software (both from Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Jose, CA) and FlowJo (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR). Serum collected by cardiac puncture was frozen at \u03ea20\u00b0C until analysis of aminotransaminase (aspartate aminotransaminase [AST] and alanine aminotransaminase [ALT]) levels using standard spectrophotometric activity assays (VetCheck, Rochester, NY).\n\nFormalin-fixed liver sections were embedded in paraffin, and 5-m sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Hepatitic foci on H&Estained sections (n \u03ed 3-5 mice/time point) were counted by a pathologist \"blind\" to the identity of the samples. Counts were normalized to total area of sections counted as previously described, 18 and a Fischer's least significant difference was used for analysis of variance. 19 Alternatively, deparaffinized slides were pretreated with proteinase K (20 g/ml) and then stained with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick-end labeling reagents (Roche). Slides were incubated with anti-CD3 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and anti-F4/80 antibodies (Caltag) and then secondary Al-exa 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) for CD3 and Alexa 647 goat anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes) for F4/80. Chromogenic immunohistochemistry was done with biotinylated rabbit anti-rat F4/80 antibody and then streptavidin-HRP antibody (Jackson Laboratories) and developed with AEC \u03e9 (DAKO). Hematoxylin was used as the counterstain. Some tissues were snap-frozen in OCT freezing compound and liquid nitrogen. Sections (5 m) were then fixed with 50:50 methanol:acetone, stained with PE-Thy1.1 or APC-Thy1.2 (Pharmingen) for 1 hour, and counterstained with 100 nmol/L Sytox green (Molecular Probes) for 2 minutes before imaging.\n\nRNA was isolated from 14 flash-frozen mouse lungs and livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; manufacturer's protocol). cDNA was made from 1 g of RNA template using First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche). The LightCycler PCR/detection system (Roche) was used to amplify and quantify influenza cDNA from each tissue. The LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit was used as described by the manufacturer. PCR mixtures contained 100 ng of cDNA template, 1\u03eb LightCycler reaction buffer, 2.65 mmol/L magnesium chloride, and 0.5 mol/L sense (5\u0408-GAGCTGGTTCA-GAGTTCCTC-3\u0408) and antisense (5\u0408-TCACAATGAG-GGTCTCCCA-3\u0408) primers to amplify a 110-bp fragment of influenza virus cDNA. Thermal conditions were 55 cycles of 2 seconds at 94\u00b0C, 2 seconds at 65\u00b0C, and 4 seconds at 72\u00b0C. Melting curve analysis was performed from 65 to 95\u00b0C, followed by cooling to 40\u00b0C. dsDNA product was quantified by monitoring fluorescence of DNA-binding SYBR Green I dye. Standard curve analysis was performed with each run using the 110-bp influenza product cloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) as template. Level of detection was 2.6 viral copies.\n\nSpleen and lymph node cells from Thy 1.1 \u03e9 OT-I mice were depleted 20 using rat monoclonal antibodies to CD4 (GK1.5), MHC class II (TIB120), and goat anti-mouse Ig-coated beads (Invitrogen/Dynal, Carlsbad, CA) and goat anti-rat Ig-coated beads. CD8 \u03e9 T cells (5 \u03eb 10 6 ; enriched to 96% purity) in 500 l of PBS were intravenously transferred into allotypically distinct (Thy 1.2 \u03e9 ) B6 mice on day \u03ea1. For peptide-activated T cells, animals received 25 nmol/L SIINFEKL peptide in PBS intraperitoneally on days 0, 1, and 2 and were then sacrificed on day 5 for histology and flow cytometry. Alternatively, transfer recipients were challenged with the influenza virus WSN-OVA I on day 0 and then sacrificed on day 9 at the peak of the pneumonic immune response to this virus. 15 \n\nElevation of liver transaminase levels is a frequent observation during human influenza infection. However, because clinical attention is on the acute infection in the respiratory tract, the incidence of liver involvement has not been established. To formally test the association of influenza infection with liver injury, we analyzed data from a human influenza study in which volunteers were deliberately infected with influenza A/Kawasaki/86. Four of 15 (26.6%) infected individuals experienced a significant rise in ALT values. In two of these four, peak ALT levels were more than three times the upper limit of normal range ( Figure 1A ). AST values ( Figure 1B ) were clinically elevated in 20% of the infected subjects. Notably, these increases in ALT and AST levels were not coincident with pyrexia (which had resolved by day 4), demonstrating that liver damage was not linked to the innate immune response nor to virus replication. A separate study of 54 individuals experimentally infected with influenza B/Yamagata provided similar evidence of influenza-induced liver damage, with liver enzyme abnormalities in 20.3% of these subjects (data not shown). The moderate frequency of liver pathology among human subjects was not unexpected. Most adult humans are likely to have varying levels of pre-existing influenza immunity, and the presence of cross-reactive antibodies could temper the infection and liver injury.\n\nThe association between influenza infection and elevated transaminase levels was accentuated in a murine study in which there was no prior exposure to respiratory infection. All animals undergoing primary infection with x31 had elevated ALT ( Figure 1C ) and AST levels ( Figure  1D ), peaking on day 8. The high incidence (100%) in \n\nA plausible explanation for liver damage is that it is a consequence of co-infection of the liver itself during the course of respiratory infection. During human influenza infection, the occurrence of viremia is not well documented. To evaluate the extent of intrahepatic infection with influenza virus, liver and lung samples from infected mice were subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR to detect the virus genome. The results indicated large copy numbers of influenza virus genome in day-4 lungs ( Figure  1E ), but the livers did not differ from uninfected controls. The RT-PCR-based assay shows that the occurrence and quantity of infectious virus in the livers were not consistent with the high incidence (100%) and magnitude of the hepatitis or with the reproducible incidence of significant proportions of intrahepatic influenza-specific T cells found in all infected animals (as quantified by flow cytometry; Figure 2 ). Inoculation of eggs with tissue samples from acutely infected animals also failed to show evidence of virus in the liver (data not shown). All evidence indicates that infection of the liver does not play a role in the pathology seen at that site.\n\nIn a model using transgenic CD8 \u03e9 T cells (OT-I), injection of their cognate peptide induces antigen-specific T-cell activation and proliferation. This is followed by intrahepatic trapping of these activated T cells, with evidence of hepatic inflammation and damage. 5, 21, 22 Similarly, influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are detectable in the liver after influenza infection in the lung. 6 Because the elevated liver aminotransaminase levels indicated hepatic damage in this respiratory infection model, we compared the liver pathology to the established peptide model. Na\u00efve CD8 \u03e9 T cells were stimulated in B6 mice either by injection of SIINFEKL peptide (Figure 3 , A and B) after adoptive transfer of CD8 \u03e9 OT-I T cells from transgenic donors or by respiratory infection with influenza x31 (Figure 3 , C and D). Intrahepatic focal accumulations characterized by dense aggregates of mononuclear cells were visible in both the peptide and infection models ( Figure 3 , A-D). During x31 infection, the peak lymphocyte response in the lung was accompanied by formation of discrete foci containing eosinophilic Councilman bodies (the histological manifestation of apoptotic hepatocytes; Figure 3D ) throughout the lobes of the liver but without any distinct zonal distribution ( Figure 3C ). Hepatitis resolved within 30 days of infection ( Figure 3F ). Subsequent hetero-subtypic challenge with influenza PR8 produced greater numbers of hepatitic foci ( Figure 3E ) Mean numbers of NP \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the BAL were calculated by multiplying flow cytometric percentages by cell counts for pooled BAL samples and then correcting to represent the expected value from a single mouse. C: Influenza-specific D b /NP tetramer \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the liver at the peak of the immune response primary infection (day 8). Percentage of lymphocytes that are CD8 \u03e9 NP-tetramer \u03e9 is shown next to region. D: During the peak of secondary infection, a higher proportion of influenza-specific D b /NP tetramer \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T cells localize to the liver. Percentage of lymphocytes that are CD8 \u03e9 NP-tetramer \u03e9 on day 7 is shown next to the region. 1172 Polakos et al AJP April 2006, Vol. 168, No. 4 than primary infection. Accumulations during secondary infection were otherwise indistinguishable in size and content from those in either primary-infected mice or OT-I/peptide recipients.\n\nPreliminary histology indicated significantly greater hepatitis on secondary challenge of a memory population (Figure 3, C and E) . Because the memory CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response is significantly more robust than the primary response, this suggested to us that the magnitude of damage may correlate with the size of the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response to infection, rather than with the quantity of virus. To test the hypothesis that the presence of T cells directly correlated with damage, we quantified both the hepatitis and the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response to the virus over time. A change in number or kinetics of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the system was predicted to translate into a similar change in hepatic damage.\n\nOn day 6 of a primary infection, inflammatory foci became visible in the livers (Figure 2A, circles) , and serum transaminase levels were elevated above normal (Figure 1, C and D) . The number of hepatitic foci and the level of serum enzymes both peaked on day 8 (Figures 2  and 1) , coinciding with the peak of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T-cell numbers in the lung airways ( Figure 2B , circles), as determined by flow cytometric analysis of D b /NP-tetramer \u03e9 T cells in the BAL. In addition, the decline in hepatitis paralleled the disappearance of T cells from the lung, with a slight delay in resolution of hepatic inflammation. This suggests that the magnitude of hepatitis is driven by the size of the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell immune response.\n\nWe next varied the magnitude and timing of the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response. During a secondary PR8 infection of x31-immune animals, the CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response is both greater in magnitude and occurs earlier, 10,23-25 because of the expansion of memory T cells. Quantitative analysis of livers during the re-challenge revealed that foci began to develop on day 4 (Figure 2A, squares) , after NPspecific cells were already detectable in the draining lymph node. 13 Focal damage was notably more severe, despite the more rapidly cleared secondary virus infection (not shown). There was a close correlation between virus-specific NP \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 T-cell numbers in the lung airways ( Figure 2B , squares) and maximum number of foci in the liver (Figure 2A) , both of which increased about 2.5-fold compared with the primary infection, again supporting the view that hepatitis is driven by the CD8 \u03e9 response. In fact, significant numbers of influenza-specific T cells can be isolated from the liver at the peak of the immune response to either primary or secondary infection, as determined by NP-tetramer staining. On day 8 of primary infection, around 2.6% of liver lymphocytes are NP-tetramer \u03e9 (Figure 2C ), which translates to 1.5 \u03eb 10 5 antigen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells. During the peak response to secondary PR8 infection, the proportion of intrahepatic NP-tetramer \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 cells rises to 7% ( Figure   2D ), about 4 \u03eb 10 5 influenza NP-specific cells. In comparison, at the site of infection, the proportion of these cells in the BAL (not shown) increases from 6% during primary infection to 18% during secondary infection (2 \u03eb 10 5 NP-specific T cells in the BAL during PR8 infection; Figure 2B ). Thus, liver injury correlates with kinetics and number of influenza-specific T cells generated during the immune response as well as with their presence in the liver.\n\nThe development of hepatitis during acute infection, when there are large numbers of circulating activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells, suggested that the pathology was a consequence of the characteristic ability of the liver to selectively trap activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. 26 If the influenzaspecific CD8 \u03e9 T cells are to nucleate focus formation, they should be detectable within the foci. To determine whether virus-primed cells were actually present in foci, Thy1.1 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred into na\u00efve Thy1.2 \u03e9 B6 recipients. The mice were then infected with recombinant influenza A/WSN-OVA I in which the OVA epitope SIINFEKL acts as a surrogate viral antigen, 15 causing expansion of the transferred OT-I T cells. After activation by the influenza infection, the transgenic OT-I CD8 \u03e9 T cells accumulated in the liver as seen before and made up 8% of the total liver CD8 \u03e9 T cells at the peak of the immune response ( Figure 4A ), whereas livers from uninfected transfer recipients contained 0.2% donor-derived OT-I cells. Immunohistological sections revealed that these virus-specific OT-I cells preferentially localized to the inflammatory foci ( Figure 4B ). Each focus contained a mixture of host Thy1.2 \u03e9 cells (the majority) and donor Thy1.1 \u03e9 cells. In contrast, uninfected animals that had received OT-I cells did not have intrahepatic focal lesions (although rare donor cells were scattered diffusely throughout the liver), further indicating that CD8 \u03e9 T-cell priming was necessary for focus formation.\n\nThe potential participation of other cell types in damage induction was still unclear. Some focus-associated cells stained positive for CD4 (not shown), although these may be T cells, NK T cells, or macrophages, each of which are capable of CD4 expression. Additional immunohistochemical staining of focal infiltrates revealed that significant numbers of F4/80 \u03e9 Kupffer cells were in close contact with the CD3 \u03e9 T cells ( Figure 4C ). Apoptosis within the foci was assessed by TUNEL staining, which revealed that CD3 \u03e9 T cells ( Figure 4D ) and non-T cells were undergoing apoptosis. Together, Councilman bodies and TUNEL \u03e9 CD3 \u03ea F4/80 \u03ea cells indicated bona fide hepatocyte damage. Dying TUNEL \u03e9 cells were entwined with F4/80 \u03e9 Kupffer cells (Figure 4 , E and F), suggesting that the interaction between these cells regulates focus formation and possibly subsequent T-cell and hepatocyte death.\n\nThe visualization of Kupffer cells within foci and in close association with apoptotic cells raised the question of their role in the pathology. Their presence could signify their intimate involvement in focus formation and hepatic damage, or they may merely be attracted to these pockets of damage after the fact, as a function of their scavenging capabilities. To distinguish between these two possibilities, Kupffer cells were selectively depleted during the course of a secondary PR8 infection. Forty-eight hours after being infected, mice were intravenously in-jected with clodronate-containing liposomes, 14 which are preferentially endocytosed by Kupffer cells and induce their apoptosis.\n\nAt the peak of the secondary immune response in the lung (day 5), immunohistological staining of clodronatetreated livers revealed complete ablation of Kupffer cells ( Figure 5A ), in comparison with mice that received only PBS ( Figure 5B ). Significantly, these Kupffer cell-depleted livers were dramatically protected from influenzaassociated focus formation ( Figure 5C ; mean, 2.0 foci/ cm 2 ), and Councilman bodies were absent. In contrast, infected mice with an intact Kupffer cell population (PBS control) exhibited robust hepatitis ( Figure 5D ; mean, 114.5 foci/cm 2 ) and characteristic focus-associated apoptosis ( Figure 5B ) with abundant Councilman bodies (51 per cm 2 ). The requirement for both CD8 \u03e9 T cells and Kupffer cells and the demonstration of specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells within foci indicate that hepatitis is a direct consequence of expansion and intrahepatic trapping of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells that interact with Kupffer cells to damage hepatocytes.\n\nAlthough formation of foci depended on the presence of Kupffer cells, the intrahepatic accumulation of CD8 \u03e9 T cells did not. NP-specific CD8 \u03e9 T-cell populations could be isolated from the livers of both clodronate-treated ( Figure 5E ) and control ( Figure 5F ) groups. In fact, influ- enza-specific cells in both livers and airways of treated mice accumulated in higher proportion and greater number than in PBS controls, indicating that antigen-specific activation was not impaired by clodronate treatment. It is therefore likely that CD8 \u03e9 T cells become trapped in the liver by a largely Kupffer cell-independent mechanism, possibly via ICAM-1 or VCAM-1. 27 There was a subtle increase in the number of specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in clodronate-treated livers, and this may reflect the interruption of some immune regulatory function in the absence of the macrophage population of the liver. Kupffer cell depletion during viral infection thus clearly demonstrates that liver damage and focus formation in influenza is strictly dependent on the presence of Kupffer cells and that instead of promoting expansion or accumulation of the CD8 \u03e9 T cells, they may participate in regulating CD8 \u03e9 T-cell numbers.\n\nTo understand if other liver resident cell types contributed to focus formation, NK-deficient mice were infected with influenza. On day 8 of infection, NK-deficient and wild-type B6 livers exhibited similar numbers of inflammatory foci with comparable focal patterns containing Councilman bodies ( Figure 6A ). In addition, serum transaminase levels were equivalently elevated in both groups (mean \u03ee SE: ALT in control \u03ed 26 \u03ee 4.8, in NK-deficient \u03ed 25 \u03ee 5.1; AST in control \u03ed 367 \u03ee 138, in NK deficient \u03ed 328 \u03ee 98). CD8 \u03e9 T-cell infiltration, determined by flow cytometry, was comparable in both groups (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that NK cells were not required for either CD8 \u03e9 T-cell accumulation or focus formation.\n\nInfection of MHC class II-deficient mice (class II \u03ea/\u03ea ) lacking CD4 \u03e9 T cells also resulted in hepatitis ( Figure  6B ) and elevated transaminase levels as in control mice (mean \u03ee SE: ALT in control \u03ed 31 \u03ee 1.5, in MHC class II \u03ea/\u03ea \u03ed 34 \u03ee 4.7; AST in control \u03ed 138 \u03ee 16, in MHC class II \u03ea/\u03ea \u03ed 161 \u03ee 58). This indicates that CD4 \u03e9 T cells are unlikely to be necessary for influenza-in-duced hepatitis, a conclusion that is further supported by an experiment in mice containing CD4 \u03e9 T cells but not CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Transgenic CD4 \u03e9 DO11.10 T cells, which are specific for the OVA 323-339 peptide, were transferred into C-\u2423-deficient mice (devoid of endogenous T-cell receptors) and then stimulated with influenza expressing OVA 323-339 . This adoptive transfer generated a mouse lacking CD8 \u03e9 T cells but containing antigen-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells capable of recognizing the influenza virus. In this system, no foci were detectable histologically ( Figure 6C ), despite evidence of CD4 \u03e9 T-cell activation 16 and lymphocytic infiltrate into the lung during viral clearance (data not shown).\n\nOur results extend previous findings of liver damage after systemic immune responses 5, 28 to an extrahepatic antiviral response. We provide evidence that T-cell-induced collateral liver damage occurs during influenza infections; this process may manifest during other human respiratory infections or be exacerbated when combined with environmental or pharmacological hepato-toxicants. It is possible that the accumulation of pathogen-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells resulting in liver damage is a feature of responses to many nonhepatotrophic infections and could explain the idiopathic hepatitis noted in numerous acute infections such as measles 29 -31 and SARS. [32] [33] [34] In humans infected with influenza, abnormal liver function tests have been noted 1-3 but without formal investigation or description of influenza-induced hepatitis. Although only 20% of humans infected with influenza exhibited elevated liver aminotransaminase levels in the material we examined, this can be attributed to variability in pre-existing levels of immunity from past influenza infections and to genetic differences among subjects. Thus, different magnitudes of CD8 \u03e9 T-cell immune responses among human subjects could result in the disparities we see in liver damage. There are a number of factors that dictate the severity of infection and the sub- Figure 6 . Neither NK nor CD4 \u03e9 T cells are required for the induction of CD8-dependent collateral liver damage. A: NK-deficient mice were infected with 10 5 EID 50 influenza A/HK/x31, and day-8 liver sections were H&E-stained, revealing numerous foci and Councilman bodies (\u03eb400). Mean serum transaminase levels are indicated (in parentheses, control group transaminases). B: Focus typical of H&E-stained liver sections from MHC class II-deficient mice, infected 9 days prior with 10 5 EID 50 influenza A/HK/x31 (\u03eb400). Mean serum transaminase levels are indicated (in parentheses, control group transaminases). C: TCR C\u2423 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (with no endogenous T-cell response) received 2 \u03eb 10 7 DO11.10 lymphocytes (CD4 \u03e9 T cells specific for OVA 323-339 ) intravenously and were subsequently infected with 500 pfu of influenza WSN-OVA 323-339 . Day-9 livers were harvested, and sections were H&E-stained. These mice contained influenza-activated CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the absence of CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and correspondingly, hepatitis was not visible histologically (\u03eb100).\n\nAJP April 2006, Vol. 168, No. 4 sequent immune response, including pre-existing antibodies, ability to present antigens, and variances in cytokine milieu. The data suggest that in humans, preexisting influenza immunity may modify the incidence of hepatitis and liver damage in two distinct ways. One is that high levels of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies may reduce the magnitude and incidence of successful respiratory infection and thereby reduce liver damage. Alternatively, high frequencies of cross-reactive CD8 \u03e9 T cells may produce a large CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response to the challenge infection and drive more severe liver injury. Thus, those patients who mounted the most robust CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses to the infection, either as a result of insufficient anti-influenza antibody levels to limit infection or due to the presence of cross-reactive CD8 \u03e9 T-cell memory, would be the ones to exhibit liver injury. Therefore, the next phase of investigation is to measure antibody levels and frequencies of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the blood of patients exhibiting elevated ALTs and ASTs. Unfortunately, the variable nature of immunity to influenza in humans would be difficult to replicate in our animal models.\n\nDuring infection, virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells undergo massive expansion. 10, 23, 35, 36 A hallmark of adaptive immune responses and memory is that during secondary challenge, both magnitude and speed of the antiviral response is increased dramatically. In mice, primary infection with influenza A/HK/x31 followed by secondary challenge with influenza A/PR/8 provides an ideal system for studying consequences of anti-viral CD8 \u03e9 T-cell expansion, because these two viruses share an immunodominant internal CD8 \u03e9 T-cell epitope in the NP protein but generate nonoverlapping antibody responses.\n\nThe finding that the extent of hepatitis in primary and secondary infections is mirrored by the magnitude of the cellular response rather than viral infection implicates CD8 \u03e9 T cells in collateral liver damage. The data do not support the possibility that T-cell accumulation in the liver was in response to intrahepatic viral infection. In fact, previous studies have established that MHC expression by hepatocytes is not required to trap T cells, 26, 28 although expression of MHC on bone marrow-derived cells in the liver promotes T-cell apoptosis. 37 Instead, accumulation of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells appears to be driven by the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in hepatic sinusoids and LFA-1 and VLA-4 on activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. 26, 27 It is interesting that the infiltrates are distributed through the liver parenchyma rather than in the periportal areas. This pattern is, however, consistent with the model we have proposed in which the high expression of integrin adhesion molecules, particularly VCAM-1, on the liver sinusoidal endothelium is responsible for the \"passive\" (ie, the antigen-independent) sequestration of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. 27 It is likely that the trapping of different subsets of T cells in the liver depends on different molecules; thus vascular adhesion protein-1 was recently shown to promote the recruitment of T helper-2, but not T helper-1, CD4 \u03e9 T cells to the liver during Con A-induced hepatitis. 38 However, the Con A model is difficult to interpret because Con A is a TCR ligand, but it is not clear whether this model simulates antigen-depen-dent \"active\" T-cell sequestration 27 or the antigen-independent mechanism that we envisage in the case of influenza.\n\nThe presence of virus-specific cells in the foci argues that the pathology is a direct consequence of the immune response. When antigen-specific Thy-1.1 \u03e9 OT-I T cells were responding to WSN-OVA I influenza, 15 most of the foci contained donor Thy1.1 \u03e9 cells ( Figure 5D ), although they were only a minority of the total T cells in each focus, whereas the rest were of host origin. Of note, the host Thy1.2 \u03e9 response was occurring simultaneously against both the OVA epitope and non-OVA-specific influenza antigens. Whether all CD8 \u03e9 T cells within such foci are specific for the virus is not yet clear. Nonetheless, the presence of known antigen-specific T cells in most foci, along with the requirement for activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells for hepatitis, suggests that these cells are involved in initiating focus formation.\n\nFoci also contained damaged hepatocytes and bone marrow-derived Kupffer cells, which may be required to induce the apoptosis of T cells. 39 The significance of the Kupffer cells in influenza-associated hepatitis is not fully understood. One possibility is that, despite the lack of infectious virus or viral RNA in the liver, Kupffer cells are presenting influenza antigens that reached the liver by an undefined mechanism. However, we do not think this is likely to be an important mechanism in T-cell recruitment because in secondary influenza, the infection is of shorter duration and the virus load is lower because of rapid immune control, yet the liver lesions are more florid, and the hepatocellular injury is greater. This identifies the T cells rather than antigen as the prime mover in influenzaassociated hepatitis. As for the significance of Kupffer cells, we envisage that they are recruited by already activated T cells that become sequestered by the antigen-independent mechanisms but then act as a site for the elimination of these cells, as already proposed based on experiments in an antigen-dependent model. 37 The observation that depletion of Kupffer cells leads to an increase in the number of influenza-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells in both the lung and liver is consistent with the idea that the liver regulates the supply of CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the system, perhaps by influencing their sequestration or actively promoting deletion. Kupffer cells are not casual observers of influenza-induced damage; rather, their presence in an activated state provokes the convergence of cells into foci and the generation of Councilman bodies. The mechanism promoting this activation of Kupffer cells remains in question. One possibility is that activated cytolytic CD8 \u03e9 T cells induce an activation state in Kupffer cells. Interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423), and interferon-\u2425 have been implicated in Kupffer cell activation and hepatic damage in other experimental models. 28, 40 Specifically, Kupffer cell-derived TNF-\u2423 is known to be injurious to hepatocytes in several T-celldependent acute liver damage models. 41 Kupffer cell phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies has also been shown to result in the elaboration of TNF-\u2423 and FasL, leading to hepatocyte injury. 42 One previous report using peptideinduced activation of T cells in OT-I transgenic mice showed that the absence of FasL inhibited hepatocyte damage, although those cells on which expression of FasL was important were not identified. 43 Given the critical role of Kupffer cells in the induction of collateral liver damage, we predict that Kupffer cells are the cellular source of the FasL in that model.\n\nThe lack of involvement of NK cells in collateral liver damage is noteworthy because NK cells are important in several other models of liver injury. 44, 45 Thus, depletion of NK cells ameliorates T-cell-dependent liver damage induced by the mitogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A 46 and CD8 \u03e9 T-cell-dependent injury during adenovirus infection 47 ; furthermore, it compromises recruitment of defensive CD8 \u03e9 T cells in murine CMV infection. 45 The common denominator of all of these experimental models is the presence of the T-cell stimulus (either P. aeruginosa exotoxin A or virus) in the liver. Despite the similarity of the histological lesions, the mechanism of collateral liver damage in the absence of intrahepatic antigen appears to be totally different from the recruitment of a local antiviral response, and this is illustrated by the lack of a role for NK cells.\n\nThe current data do not exclude that in the presence of CD8 and Kupffer cells, other cells may localize within the foci and participate in a damage cascade. In fact, within foci of intact animals, a few cells did stain with anti-CD4 and anti-NK1.1 antibodies (not shown). However, the evidence presented here indicates that any other cells that may become involved must do so downstream of an interaction between Kupffer cells and virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells.\n\nThe liver sinusiodal endothelial cells constitutively express adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM, which may result from chronic exposure to intestinal endotoxin entering via the portal vein 48 but are not normally highly expressed on the endothelial cells of uninflammed capillary beds elsewhere. The interaction between these \"inflammatory\" adhesion molecules and LFA-1 expressed on activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells leads to intrahepatic trapping and Kupffer cell-mediated killing of at least some of the accumulated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. This phenomenon could merely be the functional consequence of the relative stickiness of the liver for activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Alternatively, there may be an advantage to intrahepatic trapping of activated lymphocytes during immune responses. The immune system is known to respond to respiratory infections with considerable excess of activated lymphocytes above those needed for viral clearance. 13, 36 This apparent inefficiency may reflect programming of the response independent of antigenic load. 49 Although intrahepatic trapping of potential effector T cells may result in a dampened cellular response and delayed viral clearance from extrahepatic sites, it could serve to modulate the CD8 \u03e9 response and limit immunopathology in other organs. Because the liver is able to regenerate after parenchymal injury, 50 sustaining collateral damage may be a calculated sacrifice worth the production of a robust lymphocyte response.\n\nThe significance of collateral liver damage in human disease remains to be evaluated. During acute influenza infection in two small samples of healthy volunteers, the liver injury was always benign and transient. However, it is not clear that this would be the case in immunodeficient individuals or in anyone with pre-existing liver disease. Different strains of influenza may also vary in their capacity to cause collateral liver damage, and this is a concern as new strains arise by natural recombination. We also do not know whether chronic CD8 \u03e9 T-cell activation at an extrahepatic site could cause chronic collateral liver damage. The mechanism described here would be a candidate in the case of inflammatory hepatitides of unknown origin."}
