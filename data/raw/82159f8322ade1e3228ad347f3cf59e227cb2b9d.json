Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Disease", "body": "Ebola virus infection 2014 is the global concern at present[1].\n\nIts epidemic starts in Africa and already exists outside Africa. As noted by Sprinks [2] , \"EMERGENCY NURSES are accustomed to responding to any kind of presentation, and so should not be alarmed by the latest national guidance on identifying and caring for patients with the Ebola virus\". In fact, to give a good critical care for the patient infected with Ebola virus is the main key factor for success in saving life of the patients [1] . However, the big consideration is the high contagiousness of the infection.\n\nMedical personnel become the risk group during epidemic. In the present epidemic, many nurses die due to getting infection from the patients [3] . Guideline for good clinical practice might be useful, however, it should not forget to find the preventive\n\nThe problem of Ebola virus infection is the big global concern. Preparedness for ongoing Ebola virus infection is the topic that should be discussed. In fact, it is necessary to set up a biosecurity system to protect against the present Ebola outbreak. The medical personnel have to prepare for fighting the problem. The management of the present outbreak requires international collaboration and control of cross-border disease transmission is also the big challenge. The good case study is the Hajj scenario. \n\nstudy on the Hajj \"The Hajj in the time of disease outbreak\" is very interesting [5] . \n\nFor sure, every country around the world has its own system to correspond the emerging Ebola infection. The remained concern is whether the present system is enough to effectively combat and contain the Ebola outbreak [12] . New technology should be considered and \"combined disease monitoring systems and good policy\" are the important process. Using simulation technique is a new approach that is important for preparedness to the coming of Ebola [13] . The good example is the case of simulation exercise in London [14] . Dynamics and reliability of the simulation model is required and it is the important thing that can determine the success. Since the Ebola infection is still problematic, having a good simulation exercise and practice towards the Ebola infection is very important. A general idea of how the new technology plays role and a consensus on its possible limitation in applicability should be focused. A good research and study of this question could be instructive to practitioner in the simulation community and perhaps to other ones in public health."}
