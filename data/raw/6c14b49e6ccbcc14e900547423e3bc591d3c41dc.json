{"title": "Identification and genome characterization of a novel feline picornavirus proposed in the Hunnivirus genus", "body": "According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), picornaviruses in the family Picornaviridae are currently divided into 40 genera ([www.picornaviridae.com] February 2018). The genus Hunnivirus, which contains a single species, Hunnivirus A, was included within the family Picornaviridae of the order Picornavirales in 2013 (Adams et al., 2014) . To date, three genotypes of hunniviruses have been officially proposed by the ICTV, including one hunnivirus isolated from sheep cell cultures in Northern Ireland in 1965 (https:// talk.ictvonline.org/ictv/proposals/2013.008a-dV.A.v2.Hunnivirus.pdf) and bovine and ovine hunniviruses identified in Hungary during 2008 and 2009 . From 2014 to 2016, hunniviruses have also been detected in rats in America and China, revealing new hunnivirus genotypes (Du et al., 2016; Firth et al., 2014) .\n\nThis study is the first to report a novel hunnivirus identified in fecal samples collected from a cat with diarrhea in China. The genome of feline hunnivirus (FeHuV) is genetically divergent from that of other hunniviruses and is proposed as a new genotype of the species Hunnivirus A.\n\nTo understand whether hunniviruses are present in cats, we screened 47 and 44 archived fecal samples from diarrheic and healthy cats, respectively. These samples were collected from Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Southern China, from 2016 to 2018. The method of sample collection was conducted under the guidance of the South China Agricultural University Experimental Animal Welfare Ethics Committee. Samples ere collected for testing the prevalence of viruses in cats.\n\nViral nucleic acid was extracted from samples using MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Japan). The RNA obtained was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using GoScript Reverse Transcription System with a random primer (Promega, USA). Viral cDNA/DNA was assessed for the presence of known common feline enteric viral pathogens by PCR with PrimeSTAR HS (Takara, Japan). walking strategy and long-range PCR method, four sets of overlapping primer pairs targeting the near-complete genome of FeHuV were designed using Oligo 7.0 ( Fig. 1) , and DNA fragments were amplified using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB, UK). After sequencing, the near-complete genome of one feline hunnivirus strain was assembled from the raw data using SeqMan 7.1.0.\n\nBefore constructing the phylogenetic tree, amino acid substitution models were estimated using the \"find best protein model\" in MEGA 5.05. Three phylogenetic trees based on the putative amino acid sequences of the P1 (778 aa), 2C (323 aa), and 3C (208 aa) coding regions were inferred using the rtREV+G + F amino acid substitution model, as based on bootstrap values of 1000 replicates (Fig. 2) .\n\nFecal samples testing positive for FeHuV RNA were processed for virus isolation. Culture was performed using a previously described method for bovine and ovine hunniviruses, with slight modification . Six cell lines (CRFK, MDCK, A549, PK-15, DF-1, Vero) were used; cultures were incubated for 4 days and observed daily for the cytopathic effect (CPE). After five passages, total RNA was extracted from culture lysates and supernatant for detection of FeHuV by RT-PCR with UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R primers. The field feline hunnivirus strain FeHuV-1/GZ/2017 is labeled with a black circle.\n\nThe primers UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R were utilized in this screening study to assess whether hunniviruses are present in cats. These primers amplify a 216-bp fragment of the 3D RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene of both kobuviruses and hunniviruses, and previous studies have reported frequent detection of kobuvirus in stools from diarrheic cats using this primer pair (Chung et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2015a) .\n\nAmong the archived diarrheic fecal samples, PCR products of the expected size were generated using UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R with six samples from stray cats and four samples from pet cats (Supplementary Table 1 ). After sequencing and blast searches, the species Hunnivirus A was found to be a match for three PCR-positive samples, showing 86.9%-95.3% nucleotide homology with previously identified hunniviruses. This novel hunnivirus in the present study was provisionally designated feline hunnivirus (FeHuV). The three FeHuV RNA-positive samples included two from stray cats and one from a pet cat in Guangzhou; all other samples producing the expected fragment size by RT-PCR using UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R were positive for feline kobuvirus. In addition, feline parvovirus was detected in one FeHuV RNA-positive sample and feline enteric coronavirus in another FeHuV RNA-positive sample. Based on sequencing results, the feline kobuvirus, feline parvovirus, and feline enteric coronavirus in this study have high nucleotide homology, > 98%, with previously reported strains. No FeHuV or feline kobuvirus was detected in samples from healthy cats.\n\nAfter PCR and sequencing, the near-complete genome of one field strain, FeHuV-1/GZ/2017, was assembled, including a partial 5\u2032UTR of 337 nucleotides, a single polyprotein gene of 6825 nucleotides, and a partial 3\u2032UTR of 43 nucleotides. Rapid-amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was not performed to obtain the complete 5\u2032UTR and 3\u2032UTR sequences due to a limited amount of sample. FeHuV has the largest polyprotein gene and the highest genome G + C content (48.2%) among reported hunniviruses (6732-6822 nucleotides; 44.8%-47.7%).\n\nThe genome of FeHuV-1/GZ/2017 has the same genome organization as determined for other hunniviruses: 5\u2032UTR-L-P1(VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1)-P2(2A-2B-2C)-P3(3A-3B-3C-3D)-3\u2032UTR. The putative viral proteins are of 83, 81, 240, 223, 234, 21, 243, 324, 112, 27, 208 , and 456 amino acids in length. As reported for bovine and ovine hunniviruses, the putative translation initiation site of FeHuV-1/GZ/2017 contains a nearly optimal Kozak consensus sequence (A/GNNAUGG) . A polypyrimidine-rich tract (UUUUCCCUUU) is located upstream of the AUG initiation codon, with a 19-nt spacer sequence. The Yn-Xm-AUG formula is Y 10 -X 17 -AUG (n: length of the pyrimidine tract; m: length of the spacer sequence), which is identical to that of bovine hunnivirus (Y 10 -X 17 -AUG) and ovine hunnivirus (Y 11 -X 17 -AUG) .\n\nProtease-cleavage sites between the hunnivirus viral proteins were predicted, including E/G, A/D, Q/G, P/S, and E/F, as shown in Table 1 . The protease-cleavage sites between VP4 and VP2 (A/D), 2A and 2B (G/ P), 3B and 3C (Q/G), and 3C and 3D (Q/G) are conserved among all hunniviruses. The protease-cleavage site between L and VP4 is E/G for all hunniviruses, except for bovine hunnivirus (Q/G). The proteasecleavage site between VP3 and VP1 is Q/G for all hunniviruses, except for ovine hunnivirus (E/G). Conserved motifs in hunnivruses were also analyzed ( Supplementary Fig. 1) .\n\nA novel picornavirus genus is proposed if its P1, P2, and P3 coding regions have amino acid identities < 40%, 40%, and 50% with other picornaviruses, respectively. According to this principle, the novel feline picornavirus found in our study was classified into the newly established genus Hunnivirus. Homology analysis for the FeHuV polyprotein gene showed 70.8%-83.5%, 68.8%, and 68.9% nucleotide homology with rat hunnivirus, bovine hunnivirus, and ovine hunnivirus, respectively. This finding indicates that FeHuV is substantially genetically divergent from other hunniviruses. It is thus proposed as a novel Hunnivirus A genotype.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of hunnivirus and representative picornaviruses using the amino acid sequences of the P1, 2C, and 3C proteins indicated that FeHuV clusters with other hunniviruses (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, among the analyzed picornavirus genera, the P1, 2C, and 3C proteins of the Hunnivirus genus have the closest relationship with those of the Teschovirus genus.\n\nCPE was not observed after five passages. In addition, FeHuV RNA was not detected in the culture lysate or supernatant.\n\nBased on the 3D conserved viral RdRp regions of the Aichi virus, bovine kobuvirus, and porcine kobuvirus, the primer pair UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R was initially designed by G\u00e1bor Reuter et al. for screening kobuviruses (Reuter et al., 2009) . Using this primer pair, new numbers classified in the genus Kobuvirus have been determined in various animals, including sheep, goat, dog, deer, wolf, fox, and cat (Chung et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2015b; Di Martino et al., 2014; Melegari et al., 2018; Oem et al., 2014; Reuter et al., 2010) . However, these primers are more generic for picornavirus Lu, et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 71 (2019) 47-50 than for kobuvirus . One novel quail picornavirus and two novel hunniviruses, bovine hunnivirus and ovine hunnivirus, were identified in 2012 using UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R Reuter et al., 2012) . Our study further confirmed the universal applicability of UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R in determining novel picornaviruses. The family Picornaviridae contains clinically important human and animal pathogens and is associated with a series of diseases in the central nervous system, respiratory tract, heart, liver, pancreas, skin and eye (Zell, 2017) . However, the transmission routes and pathogenicity of hunniviruses have not been investigated. Both bovine and ovine hunniviruses have been detected in apparently healthy animals. In contrast, FeHuV in this study was detected in diarrheic animals. Further analyses are needed to isolate FeHuV and to clarify its transmission route and relationship with diarrhea in an animal model as well as to assess its zoonotic potential. In summary, a novel hunnivirus was identified in cats, expanding the host range of hunniviruses. Genomic sequencing and analysis indicated that this hunnivirus is a new genotype. Continued and more large-scale surveillance of this hunnivirus in cat populations is necessary to assess the pathogenicity and risk of zoonotic transmission of this novel pathogen.\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.03.011.\n\nGL and SJL conceived and designed the experiments; GL, MH, XJC, YKS, JH and RJH performed the experiments; GL, MH, XJC, YKS, JH and RJH analyzed the data; JH and RJH contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools; GL drafted the manuscript; SJL revised the manuscript; SJL supervised and approved the message for publication."}
