{"title": "To appear in: One Health", "body": "This can inform actions that can minimize the risk that the estimated mean TP reaches the threshold prevalence ThreTP (Fig. 1 , phase C) at which the related number of hospitalized people could be too high, so that the health care system could be excessively stressed (Fig. 1, phase D) . The decision -maker could also choose to use any limit of the TP\u00b4s confidence interval rather than the mean, depending on risk-appetite and room for uncertainty in the health system. Some examples of how to define threshold prevalences, as well as setting (or comparing) survey prevalence results in the public health, are in [13] [14] .\n\nDuring phases D and E, estimating the TP would allow evaluating the eventual effect of \"draconian\" measures (e.g. strict quarantine, closing borders etc.).\n\nIn Phase F, estimating the TP of infected would allow monitoring there are no relapses into phase D if restrictions are relaxed; while in phase G, the output of repeated surveys inform s when to relax measures, reassure the public and move resources to areas where urgency is higher.\n\nA general description of how the protocol could be conducted in real time, is shown in Fig. 2 . Firstly, the sample sizes (n1 and n2) are calculated, to potentially address both purposes of: estimating TP (n1) and if no cases are found, reaching aimed confidence in freedom, PFree (n2).\n\nNext, a randomized sample size of the target population Np, is selected to ensure that the obtained TP or PFree are statistically reliable and consistent across repeated random surveys.\n\nDue to the high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, repeating the survey and its interpretation on weekly or fortnightly (Fig. 2 , blue line) could be sufficient. The frequency of the surveys would depend on the resources available and on the management needs of public health authorities for improved decision making, prioritizations and anticipating response needs (i.e., hospital beds, ventilators, medical staff on location or on call etc.). Obviously, the more frequent the surveying the more updated and timely is the information it provides.\n\nThe data analysis and interpretation of results (Fig. 2) gives the \"picture\" (with related uncertainties) of the epidemiological phase of the outbreak (Fig. 1 ).\n\nThen, authorities can use the outputs to decide if more actions and resources are needed to reduce t he TP in the area, or if this could be considered as \"free\" with confidence PFree.\n\nIn the sections below and in the supplementary material, some practical examples are provided to illustrate the general principles and application of the protocol. which is one of the widely used veterinary links we are most familiar with. In that case the inputs needed are: the aimed level of precision, the confidence interval (CI) around the TP, the sensitivity (Se) and the specificity (Sp) of the test used and the true prevalence assumed (a priori) before the survey is carried out (here called PriorTP) (Fig. 3) . By adapting the mentioned inputs, the TP of antibody positive people could be assessed as well.\n\nFor the first survey, the PriorTP is derived from the opinion of experts in public health or by using apparent prevalences (AP) as reported from other infected areas to date. In the latter case, it must be considered that AP estimates could be biased, if not based on simple random sampling and if not corrected for imperfect test performance. Nevertheless, the uncertainty on the PriorPT will reduce with the number of consecutive surveys carried out. Already at the second survey, the PriorPT would be set using the TP estimated from survey one. In the third survey, the PriorPT could be set using the TP from the previous survey and so on.\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\n\nThe sample size (n2) to achieve the target confidence in freedom (PFree) can be calculated, for example using the Ausvet link [16] (Fig. 3) . Confidence in freedom is only applicable for areas where disease is expected being absent (TP around 0% and below design prevalence Pu) (Fig. 1 , Steps A or G).\n\nThe Se could be set according to information on test\u00b4s performance from literature, or according to experts knowledge. The Sp could be set to 100% if eventual false positives are ruled out by follow ups [4] [5] .\n\nThe confidence in freedom before the first survey is made (called here PriorPFree) could be set = 50% [4] [5] . Whereas in the following testing, the PFree from the previous survey could be used as PriorPFree.\n\nThe probability of introduction into the target population during the survey (or between two consecutive surveys), is here called PIntro and could be set to 50% or to 0%. In the latter case it would be assumed that during the surveying period (e.g. during a single day of sampling) the probability of disease introduction into the targeted population is negligible. If possible, it is suggested taking all the samples at the same time. Setting PIntro = 50% would be more conservative than using 0%, because it would include the potential movement of infected people into the target population.\n\nPriorPFree and PIntro values of 50% can be considered \"neutral\" or conservative, because they resemble a situation of missing/disregarding knowledge e.g. from the past (as \"tossing a coin\").\n\nThe required target confidence in freedom (PFree) could be agreed within the task force unit. In the veterinary field, values of 95 or 99% are usually considered sufficient to substantiate freedom from disease at population level [8] [9] [10] .\n\nAn example of how to use the randomization process after calculating the sample sizes (n1, n2) is shown in Fig. 3 . If available, different software (e.g. Excel, SAS, R) and techniques from other working sectors are equally applicable for this purpose; as long as the user understands the input parameters and the uncertainty they carry on the outputs. Also, when the Np is defined, it could be assumed that eventual J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof disease spread into such populations is more or less homogeneous. This assumption s eems reasonable, if considering that the virus has spread worldwide within just a few months, and considering the syndromic data reported to date from large infected areas and cities where several thousands of cases occurred within just a few weeks from first detection.\n\nAlthough the principles of the surveying protocol are derived from the animal health realm, where they have had extensive use [e.g. 4-5-6-7-8-9-10], a similar approach in surveillance of the human population could be applicable [11] , and requires public health leadership. At a first glance, t he application of the proposed principles and protocol ( Fig. 1 to 3) , could appear as unfeasible; because it could require overpassing some social, logistic and economical barriers; as never seen before. Nevertheless, we must also consider that this is a particular situation, which is challenging the health and economy as rarely seen in history. If the virus has been able to adapt across species, the human society should be able adapting quickly too, by working across countries, sectors and communities. The protocol is not a strict guideline with which everybody must comply. Rather, is a proposal for potential solutions and it is only a \"starting\" point open to improvements and adaptations across different capacities and realities. In Table 1 , are resumed some considerations on: strengths, limitations, and possible solutions for the protocol applications. Permission to sample at random in the human needs to be considered quickly. However, it is very likely that the vast majority of randomly selected people will agree to participate, because of the urgency and a good understanding among the public. Some considerations on survey\u00b4s setting and comparing their outputs for human populations can be found in [13] [14] \uf0b7 Applying the protocol on a National scale in a population of several million people could be unfeasible if the costs are perceived as too high and participation/capacity is low. Nevertheless if the protocol can be used only in part of the affected countries, then the estimated TP could be generalized to other areas/cities/regions that seem to be in a similar: environmental, demographic, logistical and epidemiological situation.\n\nThe target population Np could be considered as infinite for sample size calculations, if e.g. it is >10 000 people and is by far larger than \"n\". Otherwise calculations and adjustments for finite Np, could be applied [e.g. see reference 14]\n\n\uf0b7 The surveillance can be expensive, but the costs needs to be balanced against the cost of keeping draconian restrictions on for extra time or implementing them too late without good evidence for decision making (e.g. national borders closure). Think alternatively, the private sector may be willing to contribute.\n\nThe protocol has been proposed to set simple random surveys at individual level, but it could be applied at different surveillance unit levels by stratified random samplings. As an example, the pr otocol could be adapted stratifying by age groups or to the address household surveillance unit levels. These would resemble sample size calculations for the veterinary clustering \"herd\" unit levels [15 -16] . Within cities, the surveys could be prioritized to areas from where people are being hospitalized.\n\naddressed to estimate the TP (with 95% CI) and avoid reaching the threshold prevalence (ThreTP, X1), above which the health care system could go under pressure due to high number of sever ill persons.
