{"title": "Comparative analytical evaluation of the respiratory TaqMan Array Card with real-time PCR and commercial multi-pathogen assays \u0b1d", "body": "Molecular methods, including real-time PCR, have become the preferred approaches for the prompt testing of respiratory tract specimens for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens. Conventional techniques are frequently labor intensive, time consuming, less sensitive, and often require specialized expertise and/or facilities but remain valuable in cases where cultureindependent tests have reduced sensitivity. Examples include the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.11.020 0166-0934/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Culture methods are also useful in clinical microbiology, such as for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Rapid reporting of real-time test results gives health professionals greater flexibility in patient management and provides epidemiologists time to recognize and respond to an outbreak. In addition, test results may allow for appropriate antimicrobial treatment that helps prevent the spread of secondary infection and development of multiple drug resistant species. Real-time PCR has demonstrated enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and utility when compared to traditional methods such as culture/DFA (Mahony, 2008) , including the ability to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens (Mengelle et al., 2014; Babady, 2013; Pillet et al., 2013; Choudhary et al., 2013; Weinberg et al., 2013; Kodani et al., 2011) , quantify pathogen load, and potentially identify new pathogens. While multiplex PCR is attractive in terms of throughput and conservation of reagents and specimen, it does require extensive optimization and is not easily amenable to changes in the components without an entire re-validation of the performance of the assays (Henegariu et al., 1997; Markoulatos et al., 2002) .\n\nSeveral commercial platforms and assays exist for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory pathogens in a specimen, including the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panels (Luminex Corporation, Austin, Texas), Qiagen ResPlex v2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and TessArae RPM 3.1 Flu (TessArae LLC, Potomac Falls, Virginia), along with other systems (Biofire Diagnostics, 2015; Hologic, 2015; GenMark diagnostics, 2015; PathoFinder, 2015; Fast-Track Diagnostics, 2015; Nanosphere, 2015) . These platforms differ in a variety of features including the type and number of analyses that can be performed (viral, bacterial, mixed, influenza specific), detection technology and need for dedicated instrumentation, complexity, sensitivity and throughput, and cost per specimen. Comparative evaluations of several of these panels show that they all have good specificity and varying levels of sensitivity across pathogens (Sakthivel et al., 2012; Renaud et al., 2012; Popowitch et al., 2013; Babady et al., 2012; Gadsby et al., 2010; Rand et al., 2011; Driscoll et al., 2014) . One common theme among all the commercial platforms is that the end user does not have control over the menu of assays included in the panel or the ability to customize individual assays without incurring significant developmental costs. At the time of preparation of this manuscript the Qiagen ResPlex v2.0 panel and TessArae were no longer available.\n\nAs an alternative, the TaqMan \u00ae Array Card (TAC; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) is a low density microfluidic card arranged in an 8 specimen \u00d7 48 assay array for a total of 384 individual real-time PCR reactions. The studies presented in this manuscript were carried out using a TAC partitioned into an 8 \u00d7 24 array where each sample was unique and assays were performed in duplicate as shown (Fig. 1 ). TACs and associated positive control materials (Kodani and Winchell, 2012) have been designed for the detection of respiratory pathogens (Kodani et al., 2011; Waller et al., 2014; Steensels et al., 2015) , hepatitis genomes , enteropathogens (Liu et al., , 2013 Platts-Mills et al., 2014) , and bioterrorism agents Rachwal et al., 2012) . Assays are independent of each other, so that modification of one primer/probe set will not require revalidation of the entire TAC. Thus, in the event that an assay is updated, new TACs would only have to be manufactured that incorporate the design change. The design of the TAC also helps to minimize specimen handling and requires less input template nucleic acid than an equivalent number of individual PCR reactions.\n\nIn this study we compared the analytical sensitivity and reproducibility of TACs spotted with oligonucleotides for the detection of 21 individual respiratory pathogens against individual laboratory developed tests (LDTs) and three different multi-pathogen \n\nAll viral and bacterial reference standards used in this study, with the exception of influenza A, influenza B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were obtained from Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD; Glasgow, Scotland) . Influenza A and B were obtained from the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR; Manassas, VA). S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes were obtained from Bacteriology Laboratory, Wadsworth Center. Assay names and abbreviations for the reference standards are shown in Table 1 .\n\nLaboratory developed tests (LDTs) for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens were designed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia) or at two different state public health laboratories (PHLs). These individual real-time PCR assays served as reference standards against which TAC performance could be compared. Pathogen specific assays on the TACs were the same CDC or PHL LDTs adapted for use with TAC. Commercial assays included the xTAG \u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel Fast, ResPlex v2.0, and TessArray \u00ae RPM 3.1-Flu. Extraction protocols used in this study were validated in multiple PHLs and determined to have comparable extraction efficiencies for different pathogens in various matrices. Sensitivity was assessed using quantified reference viral and bacterial standards to determine the TAC layout for CDC respiratory assays including 16 viral and 7 bacterial targets. At maximum density the cards are arranged in an 8 specimen \u00d7 48 assay array for a maximum total of 384 individual real-time PCR reactions. TACs can also be manufactured in other formats. In this study the cards were partitioned into 8 specimen \u00d7 24 assay sub-arrays where each assay was performed in duplicate in adjacent wells (squares A and B). Each column represents a single assay (abbreviation shown in parenthesis), with the exception of the internal positive control (IPCO), manufacturing control (GAPDH), and human coronavirus assays which were spotted in single wells within a column (columns 11, 13, and 14) . Each card also includes an RNA control (RNP3). Sample port one was reserved for use as a negative control, permitting seven samples to be analyzed on each TAC.\n\nLimit of Detection (LoD) for each assay according to the published user instructions or package insert.\n\nThe quantitative performance of individual assays that are part of the Qiagen ResPlex II Panel v2.0, Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast, and TessArray RPM 3.1 Flu panel was established in two steps. First, a range finding experiment was performed to identify the endpoint at which no detection was evident. Next, the LoD was determined by testing replicate samples at several different dilutions. Reference standards were serially diluted in viral transport media and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C prior to extraction. Instrumentation and reaction conditions are summarized in Table S1 . Duplicate samples were extracted and purified nucleic acid was pooled and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. Analysis of Qiagen ResPlex and Luminex xTAG data was performed using mean fluorescence intensity unit (MFI) cutoff values listed in Table S2 . The LoD was then determined by analysis of 15 replicate samples at three different dilutions; one log above the endpoint, the endpoint, and one log below the endpoint whereby \u226590% (14 of 15) of the replicates tested positive for detection. Analysis of TessArray data was performed using C3 scores and/or Evalues listed in Table S2 . Dilutions of each reference standard were initially tested on five individual arrays and the LoD was subsequently determined by analysis of 10 replicate samples (20 arrays) at two different dilutions; the endpoint and one log below the endpoint whereby \u226580% (8 of 10) of the replicates tested positive for detection.\n\nThe quantitative performance of CDC LDTs was established in a manner similar to the commercial panels described above. A range finding experiment was first performed to bracket the detection endpoint and the LoD was subsequently determined by analysis of 20 replicate samples at three different dilutions. The LoD was calculated to indicate the dilution whereby \u226595% (19 of 20) of the replicates tested positive for detection. Instrumentation and reaction conditions are summarized in Table S1 . Primer and probe sequences, along with final oligonucleotide concentrations are given in Table S3 . All assays were performed using 5 L of diluted extracted nucleic acid in a 25 L reaction.\n\nLaboratory developed tests for the detection of individual respiratory pathogens were independently designed at NY and IA. The quantitative performance of these assays was established in the same manner as for the CDC LDTs. Instrumentation and reaction conditions are summarized in Tables S4 and S5. Primer and probe sequences, along with final oligonucleotide concentrations are given in Table S6 . All assays were performed using 5 L of diluted extracted nucleic acid.\n\nA custom configured TAC (Kodani et al., 2011; Diaz et al., 2013) was designed to detect 16 viral and 7 bacterial targets in two adjacent wells for the same sample (squares A and B in Fig. 1 ). During TAC manufacturing, target specific primer:probe solution is lyophilized in each well. Extracted nucleic acid (46 L) was combined with AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (Ther-moFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 54 L) and the reaction mixture was loaded into one of the sample ports. After all ports were loaded the reaction mixtures were distributed throughout the TAC by low speed centrifugation. This also rehydrates the lyophilized oligonucleotides. The assay for parainfluenza virus 1, PIV1 1, on the TAC was updated to PIV1 2 for better performance at the 60 \u2022 C annealing/extension temperature used in this study (see Table S3 ), therefore performance data are presented for the PIV1 2 assay only. Each TAC also included an assay for human coronavirus HKU1; however, the assay was not characterized due to the lack of an appropriate reference standard. In most cases each column represents a single assay spotted in duplicate wells as shown in Fig. 1 ; however the IPCO, GAPDH, and human coronavirus assays were spotted in single wells within a column (columns 11, 13, and 14). Duplicate testing reduces the probability of false negatives due to sampling variation near the LoD and can compensate for a single defect in the microfluidics channel on the TAC. Sample port one was reserved for use as a negative control, permitting seven samples to be analyzed on each TAC. Since the identity of each reference standard used in the studies was known a combined positive control was not included to verify individual assay performance.\n\nThe quantitative performance for individual pathogen specific viral and bacterial assays on the TAC was established in the same manner as for the CDC LDTs except that the LoD was calculated to indicate the dilution whereby \u226594.4% (17 of 18) of the replicates tested positive for detection. Samples were prepared by serial dilution into universal transport media (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C prior to extraction. Each participating state PHL used their preferred extraction method, either the Roche MagNA Pure LC System with the Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I. (HI, MA, WA, and WI) or the bioMerieux NucliSENS EasyMag (IA and NY). Iowa used an input/elution volume of 140 L/100 L, while all other sites used 100 L/100 L. Primer and probe sequences, along with final oligonucleotide concentrations are given in Table  S3 . TACs were run on the ABI ViiA 7 real-time PCR instrument configured with a TAC heating block using the following cycling parameters: 45 \u2022 C for 10 min, 94 \u2022 C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 30 s and 60 \u2022 C for 1 min.\n\nReal-time fluorescence intensity data were examined manually for each TAC to confirm positive amplification of the internal positive controls and negative amplification for all no template controls (NTC). Provenance for the reference viral and bacterial standards was not supplied by the manufacturer, therefore the absence or presence of amplification for RNase P was examined but the results were not used to qualify the analysis. Assay integrity was confirmed by examining each TAC for cross-amplification. TACs were also monitored for the presence of anomalous baseline fluorescence and to note the reproducibility of amplification in adjacent wells (Fig. 1, squares A and B) . Atypical results may be caused by defects in spotting of the oligonucleotides for different assays or in the microfluidics channels that distribute specimen throughout the TAC during centrifugation.\n\nThe LoD for CDC LDTs was evaluated at two different state laboratories and on two different real-time PCR instruments, the ABI 7500 Fast Dx and ViiA7, with a 96 well heating block. Results are presented in Table 2 as the highest dilution (lowest concentration) of extracted reference standard that met acceptance criteria for the experiment. Calculated LoD between the two instruments was identical (columns A-D) for each site, with the exception of the rhinovirus and adenovirus LDTs on the ViiA7 (column B) that did not meet the 95% acceptance criteria. The 12 CDC LDTs also demonstrated good reproducibility (\u00b11 log) on the ViiA7 across six state PHLs as shown in columns B, D, E, F, G, and H, apart from the human parainfluenza virus 2 assay which also did not meet the necessary criteria at the WI site. As compared to LDTs developed by the New York State Department of Health (column I), the CDC LDTs again demonstrated similar sensitivities except for the CDC human parainfluenza virus 1 LDT whose LoD was 2-3 logs higher. Sensitivity of the TessArray, Qiagen, and Luminex panels was generally 1-3 logs lower than for the CDC and PHL LDTs, except for the Qiagen RVPIIv2 respiratory enterovirus assay which was one log more sensitive.\n\nLoD and reproducibility were also evaluated for seven different CDC and PHL LDTs designed to detect bacterial pathogens associated with common respiratory infections. Selected assays were performed at six state PHLs and the results are presented in Table 3 . Sensitivity was similar between the CDC and IA LDTs (columns A and B), with the exception of the CDC Legionella spp. LDT that did not meet the statistical threshold for inclusion (\u226595% positive detection). Several of the NY LDTs demonstrated 10-fold better sensitivity, including Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae. Precision across the six state PHLs was within 1 log (columns A, D, E, and F).\n\nThe performance of 21 different CDC designed LDTs in the TAC format was evaluated at six participating state PHLs. LoD was determined for each assay at three different laboratories and each site Table 2 Limit of detection for CDC and PHL viral respiratory LDTs in 96 well format and commercial multi-respiratory panels. Results that did not meet the acceptance criteria (at least 19 out of 20 replicates tested positive for detection) were considered indeterminate.

NA -assay not assigned to site. ND -panel not designed to detect Rhinovirus. tested a combination of viral and bacterial assays as shown in Table 4 . As compared to the LoD data for each LDT in a 96 well format (Tables 2 and 3 ) sensitivity in the TAC format was generally one or two logs lower depending on the assay and testing site. Precision also varied depending on the assay, with the human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus NL63, human metapneumovirus A1, influenza A, influenza B, human parainfluenza virus 1, human parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus, and H. influenzae assays having the best reproducibility, while the adenovirus and Bordetella pertussis assays had a standard deviation of 1 log.\n\nIn this study Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) and CDC, in cooperation with six PHLs, conducted a multicenter evaluation of TAC technology with viral and bacterial respiratory assays. The overall goals were to evaluate the analytical performance of CDC developed reference assays on TACs in comparison with individual CDC laboratory developed tests (LDTs), LDTs from two different state PHLs, and three commercial multi-target respiratory panels. Sensitivity was generally one log lower in the TAC Table 4 Limit of detection for CDC viral and bacterial respiratory assays in TAC format. LoD is expressed as the highest dilution (lowest concentration) of extracted reference standard that met acceptance criteria for the experiment. format than for individual LDTs, consistent with previous studies (Kodani et al., 2011) . This may be due to the oligonucleotide concentrations not being fully optimized for TAC in addition to the smaller reaction volume (1-2 L per assay) as compared to typical real-time assays (20-30 L). Smaller reaction volumes conserve specimen in comparison with individual or multiplexed real-time PCR assays, leaving greater residual specimen volume to be used for further molecular or microbial characterization. Additionally, the CDC viral LDTs were optimized for an annealing temperature of 55 \u2022 C, while the bacterial LDTs were designed to use 60 \u2022 C. The bacterial LDTs did not perform as well at 55 \u2022 C (data not shown), while the viral LDTs were acceptable at the higher annealing temperature. Since both types of assays were included on the TACs, a compromise was made by running all of the assays at an annealing temperature of 60 \u2022 C. Previous studies have compared the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of TACs for the detection of viral and bacterial pathogens capable of causing respiratory infections against individual real-time PCR assays in a 96 well format (wet assays) using clinical specimens. In one study examining 192 virus positive specimens the sensitivity and specificity of TAC was 95% and 98%, respectively (Kodani et al., 2011) ; whereas in a different study testing 942 specimens these values were 83% and 99% (Weinberg et al., 2013) . Detection sensitivity as described in these previous studies varied depending on the target, with the adenovirus, human parainfluenza virus 2, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae assays demonstrating lower performance. Reproducibility of cycle threshold (Ct) values within and across TACs in these two studies was also good, with an average coefficient of variation below 2.91%. Finally, positive and negative predictive performance in both studies was also similar between TAC and traditional individual wet assays. A separate follow up TAC study found that sensitivity near the LoD could be further improved by optimizing the entire testing procedure, including evaluating different enzyme systems, adjusting oligonucleotide concentrations, and by increasing the number of replicates from two to four (Diaz et al., 2013) .\n\nIn comparison to the two studies cited above, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of TAC assays against their individual LDTs using reference standards and to measure reproducibility between multiple sites. Regardless of the specimen type assayed, TAC demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility equivalent to other multi-pathogen detection platforms. One limitation of the current study is that the LoD was not calculated in terms of infectious dose 50% (ID 50 ) or copies/mL. Future studies will evaluate TAC performance against validated laboratory developed tests using clinical specimens of known titer. Several different extraction instruments, combinations of oligonucleotide primers and probes, PCR enzyme master mixes, and real-time instruments were used by multiple laboratories in this study and the consistency of the results demonstrated the robustness of the technique when assays are carefully designed and thoroughly validated. Taken collectively, the data underscore the utility of TAC for multi-pathogen testing performed on a variety of specimen types using various extraction and amplification chemistries. Although inherent logistical limitations exist when attempting to compare technologies, the results of the current study demonstrate that the TAC is an ideal platform for testing specimens using a customized panel of targets and supports the suitability of TAC for future studies in a variety of formats and settings."}
