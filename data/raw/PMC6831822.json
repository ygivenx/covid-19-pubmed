{"title": "The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus", "body": "Pathogenic viruses have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to avoid or impair the host innate immune antiviral response (Unterholzner and Almine, 2019), particularly by evading those pathways that result in type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling (Garcia-Sastre, 2017). For example, Ebola virus (EBOV) relies on its structural protein VP35 to inhibit viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing by retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) (Cardenas et al., 2006, Leung et al., 2010, Luthra et al., 2013) and the IFN-inducible double-stranded (ds)RNA sensor protein kinase R (PKR) (Feng et al., 2007, Schumann et al., 2009), thus avoiding the triggering and amplification of the host type I IFN response. The critical role played by VP35 in productive EBOV infection was underscored by the finding that mutations introduced into VP35 that disrupted its ability to sequester viral RNA intermediates, which did not affect its function in EBOV replication, resulted in increased type I IFN induction in vitro and severely attenuated viral growth in vivo in mice (Hartman et al., 2008) and guinea pigs (Prins et al., 2010). A host-directed therapy that could overcome this potent VP35-dependent EBOV immune evasion strategy would thus be particularly useful.\n\nNitazoxanide (NTZ) is an oral US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that has been used in millions of adults and children since 2004 with minimal adverse side effects for the treatment of Giardia- and Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea, including in patients co-infected with HIV (Doumbo et al., 1997, Hussar, 2004, Rossignol et al., 1998). NTZ and its circulating metabolite tizoxanide (TIZ) have also been reported to inhibit a diverse array of viruses in tissue culture and in small animal models (Rossignol, 2014). In humans, NTZ reduces symptom duration of uncomplicated influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014), viral gastroenteritis (Rossignol and El-Gohary, 2006), and rotaviral diarrhea (Rossignol et al., 2006). Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to NTZ's activity against specific viruses (Ashiru et al., 2014, La Frazia et al., 2013, Li et al., 2017, Piacentini et al., 2018, Rossignol et al., 2009b, Sekiba et al., 2018), including studies showing enhancement or induction of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression by NTZ (Gekonge et al., 2015, Petersen et al., 2016, Trabattoni et al., 2016) and studies showing a weak association between NTZ and PKR activation (Ashiru et al., 2014, Elazar et al., 2009). However, no functional link between NTZ's antiviral activity and any specific ISG or with PKR has been demonstrated, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its broad-spectrum antiviral effects on host cells remain unknown.\n\nHere, we show that treatment of cells with NTZ results in broad amplification of the host innate immune response, including an increase in RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation in response to stimulation with cytoplasmic dsRNA, enhanced mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activities, and transcriptional induction of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. Based on these data, we hypothesized that NTZ could limit or overcome EBOV's ability to evade detection by critical innate immune sensors following viral entry. At concentrations reflective of routine oral dosing for parasitic infections, NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in A549 cells. Furthermore, using CRISPR/dead (d)Cas9-KRAB promoter targeting to ablate expression of individual host factors, we show that NTZ's inhibitory effect against EBOV relies on both RIG-I and PKR, indicating that NTZ can overcome EBOV VP35's ability to prevent viral detection by these cytoplasmic sensors. We also show that NTZ significantly inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through a distinct mechanism involving both RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with the different innate immune evasion strategies employed by VSV when compared with EBOV. Thus, NTZ establishes a broad \u201cantiviral\u201d milieu that is rapidly amplified upon viral infection and is capable of counteracting varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies, such as those employed by EBOV and VSV.\n\nWith no effective and easily deployable oral drug to treat or prevent infection, EBOV caused over 10,000 deaths in the 2014\u20132016 west African EBOV epidemic (Shiwani et al., 2017) and has claimed over 1,700 lives to date (as of July 21, 2019) in the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Claude et al., 2018, World Health Organization, 2019). Our demonstration that NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in vitro suggests that NTZ could have a potential role in the treatment of acute EBOV disease, prevention of EBOV infection in exposed healthy individuals, and eradication of EBOV reservoirs that persist in immune-privileged sites of patients who have been cured of EBOV disease (Deen et al., 2017), and it provides impetus to test NTZ in animal models of EBOV infection to demonstrate in vivo efficacy.\n\nOur data that NTZ broadly enhances antiviral sensing via the cytoplasmic RLR pathway and amplifies type I IFN-induced gene expression, including IFITM3 gene synthesis, which has previously been shown to inhibit EBOV infection (Huang et al., 2011), led us to speculate that NTZ may overcome EBOV's capacity to evade host RNA sensing and to skirt triggering of the type I IFN response (Basler et al., 2000, Basler et al., 2003, Cardenas et al., 2006, Hartman et al., 2008, Leung et al., 2010, Luthra et al., 2013), thus favoring host control of the virus. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of NTZ to inhibit infectious EBOV growth in human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells in vitro under biosafety level 4 conditions using an isolate of infectious EBOV from the original 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kikwit). Cells were pretreated with 0, 20, or 40 \u03bcM NTZ, which is not toxic to A549 cells (see Figure 3A), for 4 h, and were then infected with EBOV at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in Figure 2, in vehicle-only treated cells, EBOV growth increased by over 1.5 log units by 72 h post-infection. By contrast, over the same time frame, EBOV growth was completely inhibited in cells treated with 20 or 40 \u03bcM of NTZ (p < 0.001), dropping 2.5 log units from the initial inoculum titer in the cells treated with 40 \u03bcM NTZ (p < 0.001). We note that 20 and 40 \u03bcM are concentrations of NTZ that are either well below or equivalent to peak plasma levels (\u223c39 \u03bcM) of its active metabolite TIZ that are observed in humans who have ingested 500 mg of NTZ twice a day in a typical oral regimen for cryptosporidial diarrhea (Romark, 2017).\n\nTo begin to characterize the mechanisms involved in NTZ's antiviral activity, we next tested NTZ's effect on a second RNA virus, the rhabdovirus VSV, which, like EBOV, is a member of the order Mononegavirales, and which also allowed testing under biosafety level 2 conditions. NTZ pretreatment of A549 cells for 4 h inhibited the growth of a firefly luciferase-expressing VSV (VSV-Luc) reporter virus (Cureton et al., 2012) in A549 cells, with greater than 99% inhibition of VSV-Luc achieved at an NTZ concentration of 12 \u03bcM and >99.9% inhibition obtained at 18 \u03bcM (Figure 3A, left).\n\nGiven the importance of both RIG-I and PKR in EBOV's evasion of the host antiviral response (Cardenas et al., 2006, Feng et al., 2007, Leung et al., 2010, Luthra et al., 2013, Schumann et al., 2009), and reports that NTZ can weakly induce auto-phosphorylation of PKR (Ashiru et al., 2014, Elazar et al., 2009), we next sought to determine the role of these molecules in NTZ's antiviral activity using the VSV model system. Because traditional short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based methods of gene knockdown, including in A549 cells, are associated with both non-specific type I IFN induction by the shRNA itself, and reduced shRNA activity in response to type I IFN stimulation (Machitani et al., 2017), we chose to knockdown RIG-I or PKR expression in A549 cells by targeting dead(d)Cas9-KRAB to their genes' promoters (see Transparent Methods and Figure S1 for gRNA target sequences and Figure 3B for protein knockdown efficiency). RIG-I depletion (Figure 3C, left panel) led to significantly increased VSV-Luc growth (Figure 3C, right panel, see 0 \u03bcM NTZ data point) and to a strong reduction in VSV-Luc's sensitivity to NTZ (50% inhibition at 4.8 \u03bcM NTZ in CRISPR-Ctrl A549 cells versus 8.0 \u03bcM NTZ in CRISPR-RIG-I A549 cells) (Figure 3C, right panel). Depletion of PKR (Figure 3D, left panel) also resulted in significantly increased VSV-Luc growth (Figure 3D, right panel, 0 \u03bcM NTZ data point). However, NTZ's ability to block VSV replication was not impaired in PKR-depleted cells at any NTZ concentration tested (50% inhibition with 4.8 \u03bcM NTZ in CRISPR-Ctrl A549 cells versus 4.7 \u03bcM NTZ in CRISPR-PKR A549 cells) (Figure 3D, right panel), indicating that NTZ's suppression of VSV replication is not dependent on PKR.\n\nThe phosphatase GADD34 selectively promotes IFN-\u03b2 translation in the context of host global translational shutdown following PKR-dependent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation or stress pathway activation (Dalet et al., 2017). NTZ has previously been shown to induce low levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ashiru et al., 2014) and to promote the translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (Elazar et al., 2009), which during translational inhibition is a transcriptional activator of GADD34 gene expression (Ma and Hendershot, 2003). We thus investigated whether NTZ affected GADD34 expression. We treated A549 cells with increasing concentrations of NTZ for 4 h and measured GADD34 mRNA levels. NTZ strongly induced GADD34 mRNA synthesis in an NTZ concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3E). We note that maximal GADD34 transcription was detected between 4 and 8 h post-NTZ stimulation of A549 cells (not shown).\n\nTo investigate whether GADD34 participates in NTZ's inhibitory effect on VSV, we knocked down GADD34 in A549 cells using the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB strategy described above (see Transparent Methods and Figures S1 and 3B) and infected these GADD34-depleted A549 cells (Figure 3F, left panel) with the VSV-Luc reporter virus. GADD34 depletion resulted in a significant increase in VSV infection/growth (Figure 3F, right panel, 0 \u03bcM NTZ data point), similar to previously reported findings with VSV and GADD34\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Minami et al., 2007). Furthermore, GADD34 depletion reduced VSV sensitivity to NTZ (50% inhibition at 4.8 \u03bcM NTZ in CRISPR-Ctrl A549 cells versus at 6.9 \u03bcM NTZ in GADD34-KD A549 cells) (Figure 3F, right panel), indicating that NTZ's anti-VSV activity also depends on its ability to induce the expression of GADD34 in addition to its enhancement of RIG-I function. Taken together, although RIG-I, PKR, and GADD34, play a role in host inhibition of VSV, only RIG-I and GADD34, and not PKR, are involved in NTZ-mediated repression of this virus.\n\nWe next analyzed EBOV replication in the CRISPR/dCas9-RIG-I-KD, PKR-KD, and GADD34-KD A549 cells under biosafety level 4 conditions to determine the individual roles of these antiviral proteins in restricting EBOV growth. Both RIG-I and PKR depletion led to significantly increased EBOV Kikwit replication (Figure 4A), with an increase of greater than a log unit by 72 h post-infection when compared with control cells (Figure 4A, right). This experiment demonstrates the importance of both factors in host control of EBOV infection. By contrast, although GADD34 depletion resulted in higher EBOV titers at 48 h, it did not impact EBOV growth by 72 h post-infection (Figure 4A, right). Thus, unlike what we found with VSV, GADD34 plays a limited role in restricting EBOV growth in A549 cells.\n\nTo determine if RIG-I, PKR, or GADD34 were targets of NTZ and required for its inhibitory effects upon EBOV, we next pretreated the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB nonspecific control cells and the CRISPR/dCas9-RIG-I-KD, PKR-KD, or GADD34-KD A549 cell lines with 0 or 20 \u03bcM NTZ for 4 h and then infected with EBOV Kikwit at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in Figure 4B (left), there was a 10.5-fold reduction (>1 log change) in NTZ's anti-EBOV activity in CRISPR/PKR-KD A549 cells by 72 h post-infection when compared with the CRISPR/Control A549 cells, indicating that PKR activity plays a critical role in NTZ's efficacy against EBOV. RIG-I depletion also resulted in an appreciable, although lesser, reduction in EBOV sensitivity to NTZ (2.7-fold) by 72 h post-infection (Figure 4B). By contrast, GADD34 depletion had little effect on NTZ's ability to inhibit EBOV growth (Figure 4B).\n\nAlthough NTZ is FDA approved for the treatment of cryptosporidial diarrhea and is a well-tolerated medication, a limitation of the data presented here regarding NTZ's inhibition of EBOV is that it is based on in vitro studies and we have not yet established NTZ's efficacy against EBOV in an in vivo animal model. Furthermore, the detailed investigation of NTZ's upstream target in the regulation of the immune responses described here is outside the scope of this article and will be the subject of future studies, as will in vivo testing of NTZ against EBOV.\n\nAll methods can be found in the accompanying Transparent Methods supplemental file."}
