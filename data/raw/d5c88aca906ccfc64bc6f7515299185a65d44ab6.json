{"title": "SHORT COMMUNICATION A Murine and a Porcine Coronavirus Are Released from Opposite Surfaces of the Same Epithelial Cells", "body": "Epithelial cells are important target cells for coronavirus infection. Earlier we have shown that transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) are released from different sides of porcine and murine epithelial cells, respectively. To study the release of these viruses from the same cells, we constructed a porcine LLC-PK1 cell line stably expressing the recombinant MHV receptor cDNA (LMR cells). The MHV and TGEV receptor glycoproteins were shown by immunofluorescence to appear at the surface of the cells and to be functional so that the cells were susceptible to both MHV and TGEV infection. Both coronaviruses entered polarized LMR cells only through the apical surface. Remarkably, while the cells remained susceptible to TGEV for long periods, infectability by MHV decreased with time after plating of the cells onto filters. This was not due to a lack of expression of the MHV receptor, since this glycoprotein was still abundant on the apical surface of these cells. TGEV and MHV appeared to exit LMR cells from opposite sides. Whereas TGEV was released preferentially at the apical membrane, MHV was released preferentially at the basolateral surface. These results show that vesicles containing the two coronaviruses are targeted differently in LMR cells. We propose that the viruses are sorted at the Golgi complex into different transport vesicles that carry information directing them to one of the two surface domains. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV might be factors contributing to the difference in virus spread found between TGEV and MHV in their respective natural hosts, the former causing mainly a localized enteric infection, the latter spreading through the body to other organs. \u1b67 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\n\nCoronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA vi-vesicular stomatitis virus are released from the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, in both Fischer ruses that infect humans and animals. Each virus has a narrow host range. The course of infection ranges from rat thyroid (FRT) and Caco-2 cells, two togaviruses, Sindbis and Semliki Forest virus, bud from the apical subclinical to lethal, and the symptomatology from respiratory and enteric disease (most commonly) to hepatitis, membrane of FRT cells, but from the basolateral membrane of Caco-2 cells (3) . In all these cases budding peritonitis, encephalomyelitis, and other syndromes. Primary replication is often limited to epithelial cells of the appeared to take place at the plasma membrane domain where the respective viral membrane proteins were respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts (1) .\n\nThe plasma membrane of epithelial cells is divided found to accumulate. Unlike the viruses mentioned above which mature by into an apical domain, directed to the external milieu, and a basolateral domain, facing the internal milieu. Many budding from plasma membranes, coronaviruses mature by budding from intracytoplasmic membranes in a pre-viruses enter these cells from a specific side and also virus release is often vectorial (for a review, see Ref.\n\n2).\n\nGolgi compartment called the budding or intermediate compartment (4) (5) (6) . From there the viral particles are The polarity of virus release may differ in epithelial cells depending on their origin. Whereas influenza virus and transported in vesicles through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, where they are released by exocytosis (7) . Recently, we have shown that the mouse To prepare an LLC-PK1 cell line stably expressing the MHV receptor glycoprotein, we constructed the expression plasmid pMHVR2 as described before (11) . pMHVR2 was transfected into LLC-PK1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (12) . G418-resistant cells were cloned by three rounds of limiting dilution. Cells from a selected clone (named LMR cells) and LLC-PK1 cells were grown on coverslips and infected with MHV or TGEV or mock infected. At 6 hr p.i. cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-TGEV spike (a-TGEV) monoclonal antibody or an anti-MHV (a-MHV) serum as described previously (10) . polarized porcine LLC-PK1 cells (8) (9) (10) . To establish three rounds of limiting dilution. One of these cloned cell lines was selected for further experimentation and was whether these differences were due to the use of different cells or caused by differential sorting of the two vi-named LMR. The immunofluorescence observations of Fig. 1 show that the LMR cells supported MHV infection ruses, we investigated the release of the two viruses from the same cells. To accomplish this aim we prepared while remaining susceptible also to TGEV infection. From this experiment, and others where the m.o.i. was varied, a derivative of the porcine cell line. LLC-PK1 cells, which are not susceptible to MHV-infection ( Fig. 1) , were trans-it appeared that up to 95% of the LMR cells could be infected by MHV. Since the monolayer started to lose its fected with plasmid pMHVR2 containing the MHV recepintegrity from around 8 1 2 hr postinfection (p.i.), all experitor (MHVR) cDNA and the neomycin resistance cDNA (11) . After selection of the cells with the neomycin-derivaments were performed between 4 and 8 hr p.i.\n\nUsing an immunofluorescence assay we observed tive Geneticin (G418), resistant cells were cloned by evident when cells were infected at 13 hr p.s., the earliest time point in this experiment. For TGEV these results are in agreement with our earlier observations in the parental cell line, LLC-PK1 (8) . The amount of MHV proteins synthesized in the LMR cells decreased when monolayers of increasing age were used. Thus, monolayers infected at 85 hr p.s. hardly produced any MHV proteins. This observation was not due to the cells becoming generally less metabolically active: no such time-dependent decrease in virus-specific protein synthesis was seen after TGEV infection (Fig. 2) . The apical entry of the viruses was confirmed in an immunofluorescence experiment in which filter-grown LMR cells were again infected with MHV or TGEV from the apical or basolateral side at different times p.s. and fixed for staining 6 hr later. Figure 3 shows that the entry of MHV into the cells was not yet polarized when cells were infected at 4 hr p.s. From 8 hr p.s. on, virus entry became restricted to the apical membrane domain. The same results were found for the entry of TGEV (results not shown). From about 48 hr p.s. entry of both viruses was due to their inability to pass the filters and reach the cells at later time points postseeding, cells grown for 73 hr on filters were treated with that, depending on the experimental conditions, up to 50% of the cells could be doubly infected by both TGEV 30 mM EGTA for 30 min at 37\u040a. This disrupts the tight junctions and allows virus to pass between the cells. and MHV (data not shown). Furthermore, the two viruses appeared to interfere significantly with each other's repli-EGTA treatment immediately before inoculation allowed the cells to become infected with TGEV and MHV from cation. The amounts of MHV and TGEV proteins synthesized in doubly infected cells were much lower than the basolateral side (data not shown). Notably, however, this treatment did not change the percentage of cells those in singly infected cells. A reflection of this effect was observed when the culture media were analyzed.\n\nthat could be infected with MHV from the apical side. The distribution of the MHVR glycoprotein on the Using immunoisolation, a clear reduction was found in the amounts of each of the two viruses after double inoc-surface of LMR cells was determined for two reasons.

Second, we wanted to know whether the observed tem-In view of the strong interference between the two viruses, the polarity of their release in this double-infection poral decrease in susceptibility was caused by the gradual loss of the receptor glycoprotein with time. system was not further pursued.\n\nTo study the entry of TGEV and MHV into LMR cells, Using confocal laser scanning microscopy it was found that at 14 hr p.s., the MHVR glycoprotein was detected monolayers of the cells were grown on filters as described before (8, 10) . This allowed inoculation either both on the apical side (TRITC channel; Fig. 4 ) and on the basolateral side (FITC channel). In the reverse from the apical or from the basolateral side. Cells were infected at different times postseeding (p.s.) from either experiment, in which the FITC-and TRITC-conjugated second antibodies were used apically and basolater-side and labeled with 35 S labeling mix. Lysates were prepared and viral proteins were immunoprecipitated ally, respectively, similar results were found (data not shown). However, it was noticed that FITC gave a two with an antiserum against TGEV or MHV. As seen from the induction of virus-specific protein synthesis (Fig. 2) , to four times stronger signal than TRITC with the settings used for the data processor. Considering this, both TGEV and MHV entered LMR cells preferentially from the apical side. This polarity of entry was already we can conclude that at 14 hr p.s. the receptor glyco- FIG. 3 . Entry of MHV and TGEV into LMR cells as shown by immunofluorescence. LMR cells cultured on filter supports were infected with MHV or TGEV from the apical or basolateral side at different hours p.s. (h). Cells were fixed at 6 hr p.i. and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-TGEV S monoclonal antibody for TGEV-infected cells and an anti-MHV serum for MHV-infected cells as described before (10) . protein density at the apical plasma membrane was basolateral side at a time point at which MHV entry had already become restricted largely to the apical some two to four times higher than at the basolateral plasma membrane. The presence of the MHVR at the side was surprising. One may assume, however, that observed predominantly in the apical medium. In contrast, MHV viral structural proteins were released from the basolateral side of the cells similar to their release from murine epithelial cells (10) . Similar results were found when viral particles were affinity purified from the media by adding monoclonal antibodies against the spike proteins of TGEV and MHV in the absence of detergent (data not shown). The ratio between MHV viruses released into the basolateral and apical medium decreased in older monolayers. Possible reasons for this observation are discussed elsewhere (10) . The apparent preferential release of MHV into the basolateral medium of LMR cells was confirmed by analyzing the infectivity accumulating on opposite sides of the whereas 95% appeared in the basolateral medium. This and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described previously may even be an underestimate because viral particles (8) . Shown are XY sections through the cells, i.e., parallel to the filter, and XZ sections through the cells, i.e., perpendicular to the XY sections.\n\nThe apical region of the cells is above. Note that the XY and XZ images tween the cells and the filter (10). In contrast, more than of each time point are taken from the same cells.\n\n99% of infective TGEV particles were released into the apical medium of LMR cells similar to their release from LLC-PK1 cells (8) . a critical threshold surface density of the receptor is required for coronavirus entry; at the basolateral sur-\n\nIn conclusion, our studies show that, similar to our earlier observations in mTAL (10) and LLC-PK1 (8) face this density may have become too low to initiate infection. This explanation has also been suggested cells, MHV and TGEV are released from opposite membrane domains, i.e., from basolateral and apical sur-for the selective apical entry of measles virus into cells that expressed the viral receptor at the basolateral faces, respectively. Hence, the vesicles containing the two coronaviruses are sorted differently in cells from membrane domain as well (14) . At 85 hr p.s. the receptor glycoprotein was still abundantly present. It was the same line. Somehow the cellular sorting machinery can obviously distinguish between vesicles containing found almost exclusively on the apical side, though a small amount of receptor protein could be detected on MHV and those containing TGEV. Sorting most likely occurs when the viruses exit from the Golgi complex. the basolateral side of the cells as well (Fig. 4) . Hence, the low level of infection by MHV from the apical side How this sorting occurs and what determinants are important to effect the selection is unknown. For vi-at 85 hr p.s. cannot be due to a lack of receptor glycoprotein.

One obvious candidate is the spike protein, the most prominently exposed moiety at the virion surface, the direction of release of TGEV and MHV from cells of the same line. Therefore, parallel cultures of LMR which is also involved in receptor binding and cell fusion (for references, see Ref. 17) .

In the experiment shown accordingly, the MHV spike may contain domains that direct virions to the basolateral pathway. in Fig. 5A infected cells were radiolabeled for 3 hr after which viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from the Another candidate to explain the difference in sorting is the M protein which is N-glycosylated in TGEV but media. In agreement with the results obtained with LLC-PK1 cells (8), TGEV viral structural proteins were exclusively O-glycosylated in MHV (for references, see Filtergrown LMR cells were infected with MHV or TGEV from the apical side at 13 hr postseeding as described previously (8, 10) . Viral infectivity in the culture media was determined at 8 hr p.i. by limiting dilution assays as described before (8, 10) . Ref. 18) .
