{"title": "Quantitative Delineation of Herpesviruses in Bats for use in Ecological Studies", "body": "Public health concerns associated with recent and ongoing outbreaks of viruses (e.g., Ebola virus and Zika virus) have motivated researchers to investigate viral diversity in wildlife hosts from previously unexplored perspectives. Ecology has a long history of quantifying the abundance and distribution of organisms and has been increasingly integrated into viral studies (Anthony et al. 2015 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . Traditionally, such efforts have focused on isolated cases of single host-single pathogen relationships (Telfer et al. 2010) . However, infected host individuals generally have multiple pathogens, and infection with one pathogen can affect infection, virulence, or disease emergence of the others (Pedersen and Fenton 2006 , Jolles et al. 2008 , Telfer et al. 2010 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . This suggests that perspectives and approaches from community ecology can complement current methods in virology.\n\nThree major challenges exist when integrating community ecology and virology. First, most viruses are rare (i.e. exist at low prevalence; Tang et al. 2006 , Winker et al. 2008 , Wacharapluesadee et al. 2010 , Anthony et al. 2015 , so the probability of infection in a host individual is low. Consequently, large datasets of comprehensively sampled host populations are needed to address high levels of uncertainty associated with low viral prevalence. Few such datasets exist. Second, most wildlife viruses are unknown to science (Anthony et al. 2013 , Anthony et al. 2017 , Carlson et al. 2019 , and the process of defining viral species is timeconsuming (King et al 2012) . This means that waiting for official designations of viral species for use in community-level analyses does not address the urgency of current health challenges posed by wildlife viruses. Alternatives to official designation of viral species include delineating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using monophyletic groups (Anthony et al 2015) or percent identity histograms (Maes et al. 2009 , Anthony et al. 2017 ). However, both such methods rely on subjectively chosen cutoff points to differentiate OTUs. Finally, many viral infections last only hours to days, making detection difficult (Klenk et al. 2004, Lee et al. 2009, Henaux and Samuel Herpesviruses are large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect all vertebrate classes and mollusks (King et al. 2012 , Azab et al. 2018 . In contrast to many viruses, herpesviruses generally occur at high prevalence (Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Cortez et al. 2008 , Imbronito et al. 2008 , Tenorio de Franca et al. 2012 , Phalen et al. 2017 , Tazikeh et al. 2019 , and they establish latent, long-term (often for the entirety of the host's life)\n\ninfections (King et al. 2012) . Using herpesviruses as the subject of ecological analyses can therefore minimize two challenges that stymie advancements in viral ecology.\n\nHerpesviruses were first detected in bats in 1996 (Tandler 1996) . Subsequent work shows that bats likely played a critical role in the evolution and diversification of herpesviruses (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016) . Bats generally have a negative reputation as carriers of deadly viruses that cause human diseases such as rabies, Nipah, and SARS (Wibbelt et al. 2010) , and consequently, most research on bat viruses has focused on these pathogens of concern for public health. Although a number of studies have also detected herpesviruses in bats (Wibbelt et al. 2007 , Razafindratsimandresy et al. 2009 , Zhang et al. 2012 , Sasaki et al. 2014 , Pozo et al. 2016 , Zheng et al. 2016 , Holz et al. 2018 , Wada et al. 2018 , little is known about viral shedding, host specificity, or the diversity of herpesviruses in bats (Zheng et al. 2016) .\n\nHerpesviruses are generally considered to be host-specific (King et al. 2012 ). However, inter-host transmission has been documented when close contact occurs between individuals of different species, especially when host species are closely related (e.g. within primates : Weigler 1992; within turtles: Greenblatt et al. 2005; within ungulates: Russell et al. 2009 ). Multiple bat species come into close proximity within caves where they roost, presenting an opportunity for cross-species viral dispersal. Indeed, cross-species transmission and host switching are common, and have likely been the norm throughout the evolutionary history of the herpesvirus lineage, especially in bat hosts (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016 , Zheng et al. 2016 , Azab et al. 2018 , Wada et al. 2018 ).\n\nThe first goal of this research was to intensively sample bat communities in two Puerto Rican caves, with the intent of saturating viral discovery of herpesviruses for use in ecological analyses. The second goal was to determine a quantitative technique to differentiate operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of herpesviruses as a fast, objective alternative to defining viral species.\n\nFinally, we aimed to describe patterns of host preference for herpesviruses. Given recent advancements in the understanding of host sharing throughout the history of the herpesvirus lineage, we hypothesized that particular OTUs would occur in multiple bat species but would have significantly higher prevalence in one of the species (i.e. viruses will have a core host species; Bush and Holmes 1986); in all satellite (i.e. \"secondary\") hosts combined, viruses will have lower prevalence. sampled from Larva Cave on seven instances between June and August 2017, using two different techniques. After sunset, mist nets were placed along a trail outside of the cave entrance to catch exiting bats and were checked at least every ten minutes. Hand nets were also used to capture bats roosting inside the cave.\n\nRegardless of sampling method, each captured bat was placed into a porous cotton holding bag. Individuals were identified to species following Gannon et al. (2005) , and a clean cotton-tipped swab was used to collect saliva from the bat's mouth. Swabs were placed in individual cryovials containing viral transport medium and sent to Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, in a dry shipper, and stored at -80\u00b0C. All methods were approved by the University of Connecticut Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol A15-032).\n\nViral Screening: Total nucleic acids were extracted from each swab using the EasyMag platform (bioMerieux, Inc.), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Invitrogen). Nested consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) was performed twice on each sample, targeting a region of the highly conserved catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase gene (Van deVanter et al. 1996) . cPCR is a broadly reactive method that allows detection of novel viruses by using nonspecific primers targeted at viral families or genera (Anthony et al. 2013 (Anthony et al. , 2015 . A constructed synthetic plasmid was used as a positive control to confirm effective implementation of the assay and to detect possible contamination.\n\nPCR gel products (1% agarose) of expected size were cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector, and twelve colonies were sequenced to confirm identity and detection of co-occurring viruses. Each clone was cross-referenced using the GenBank nucleotide database to confirm that sequences were indeed herpesviruses. Sequence data will be available at github.com/ARSjodin upon publication.\n\nOTU Delineation: A nucleotide alignment of 3,131 herpesvirus clones was conducted using the ClustalW alignment in Geneious version 11.0.5, and a pairwise percent identity (PID) matrix was calculated based on percent similarity of nucleotides in each sequence pair. A PID histogram was then generated (Maes et al. 2009 ). To evaluate the robustness of cutoffs to errors in alignment, the R package Biostrings (Pages et al. 2017 ) was used to conduct pairwise alignments of clones. A second PID histogram was generated, and frequency clusters were compared between the two PIDs. The number of OTUs was estimated using the cutoff extremes for each level of classification, based on total alignment and pairwise alignment (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs, see Results and Figure 1 ).\n\nTo statistically support which OTU cutoff to use in subsequent analyses, the R package apcluster (Bodenhofer et al. 2011 ) was used to perform affinity propagation on the PID matrix of the total clone alignment. Affinity propagation is an algorithm that examines all data points in a similarity matrix to identify exemplars (Frey and Dueck 2007). The algorithm then clusters remaining data around an optimum number of exemplars by iteratively exchanging two types of \"messages\" between data points. In the context of viral sequences, the first type of message accumulates evidence for sequence k as an exemplar for sequence i, based on genetic distance between k and i (Frey and Dueck 2007). The second type of message reflects how many sequences besides i support k as the best choice of exemplar (Frey and Dueck 2007).\n\nWhen inputting the PID matrix of all clones, the number of clusters identified through affinity propagation can be interpreted as an optimal number of viral OTUs. Although this method has been used to define clusters of a single viral species (Fischer et al. 2017) , this is the first instance in which it has been used to delineate viral \"species\" for the purpose of communitylevel analyses. To conduct affinity propagation analyses, the apcluster() command was run using the R package apcluster (Bodenhofer et al. 2011) , with default values of input parameters (input data = NA, input preference = NA, q = 0.5, convits = 100, maxits = 1000, lam = 0.9).\n\nFinally, OTUs were refined manually based on PID and affinity (see Results).\n\nFinally, sequences representing the polymerase gene of formally described beta-and gammaherpesvirus species, as defined by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of .

It Matrices comparing PID of defined viral species were calculated for comparison to empirical values. For ease of exposition, \"species\" will be used moving forward to reference host taxa or formally described viral taxa, whereas \"OTU\" will be used to reference empirical viral taxa.\n\nTo determine how well the collected samples represent the metacommunity of herpesviruses infecting bats at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve, viral discovery curves were created using the iNEXT package in R (Hsieh et al. 2016) . By defining the metacommunity as all of the herpesviruses infecting all of the host species at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve, an assumption is made that herpesviruses are shared between caves and among host species (i.e. no host specificity). Because this may not be a valid assumption, separate curves were generated for each bat species, as well as for each cave. Additionally, Chao2 estimates (Chao 1987) were calculated for the viral metacommunities of all bats at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve, as well as for each cave and for each bat species separately.\n\nHost Preference: For each OTU that infected more than one host species, the host specificity index S TD * was calculated (Poulin and Mouillot 2005) as\n\nwhere i and j represent index values of host species, p represents OTU prevalence within host populations, and w ij is the phylogenetic distinctiveness of hosts. To measure phylogenetic distinctness, hosts of the same genus are assigned a value of one, hosts of the same family but different genera are assigned a value of two, and hosts of different families have a value of three (Poulin and Mouillot 2005). S TD * thus weighs host preference by the relatedness of hosts (incorporating evolution) and the prevalence of the pathogen in each of its hosts (incorporating ecology). The extent of viral sharing among hosts species was further examined by determining whether particular OTUs had a core host species. A core host species was defined as a single host species for which the OTU had significantly higher prevalence than in all other host species .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint combined. To do this, the prevalence of each OTU in its core host and its combined prevalence in all other hosts were compared using Fisher's exact test (Wassertheil-Smoller and Smoller 2015) . For each OTU that infected more than one host individual, viral preference for host sex was examined by comparing OTU prevalence between male and females of the core host species, using Fisher's exact test. All analyses were done using R version 3.4.3, and code used for all methods can be found at github.com/ARSjodin. OTU Delineation: Both alignment techniques resulted in two similar, clearly differentiated potential cutoff ranges, as demonstrated by consistent peaks in the histograms (Figure 1 ). The lower level of taxonomic grouping of OTUs was defined as those with a cutoff between 90 -92%. This means that two sequences with less than 90% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The higher level of taxonomic grouping was defined as those with a cutoff between 74 and 80%. As such, two sequences with less than 74% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The number of OTUs resulting from the cutoff extremes for both levels of classification, when total alignment and pairwise alignment were considered (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs; Figure 1 ), were 29, 31, 42, and 47 OTUs, respectively.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint Affinity propagation resulted in 45 OTUs. Although OTU richness did not equal any values generated using the PID histograms, 45 OTUs is within the range of OTUs generated using the lower-level taxonomic cutoff (i.e. 42 -47 OTUs at 90 -93% PID cutoff), suggesting this cutoff is more strongly supported by affinity propagation than is the higher-level cutoff.\n\nAdditionally, no two described herpesvirus species were greater than 90% similar. However, Ateline herpesvirus 3 and Saimirine herpesvirus 2, two gammaherpesvirus species, and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 5 and Macacine herpesvirus 3, two betaherpesvirus species, differed by 83.6% and 78.5%, respectively. Additionally, two strains of Human herpesvirus 6, a betaherpesvirus, and Human herpesvirus 4, a gammaherpesvirus, differed by 96.2 and 99.1%, respectively. These PIDs of established viral species further support the use of the lower-level taxonomic cutoff.\n\nTo refine the exact number of OTUs, two neighbor-joining trees were generated from the exemplar sequences, as determined using affinity propagation, one for the gammaherpesviruses and one for the betaherpesviruses. (Figure 2 ). When exemplar sequences were greater than 90% similar (the most conservative cutoff within the lower taxonomic range), clusters were merged to represent a single OTU. Additionally, each OTU represented by a single occurrence (i.e. a single clone sequence) was examined individually. If the singleton sequence was greater than 74% similar to the exemplar of another OTU, the least conservative cutoff point demonstrated by PID histograms, it was clustered with that OTU. Singleton sequences less than or equal to 74% similar to each of the other exemplars were considered to be unique OTUs. After refinement, 41 OTUs remained. Preliminary data collected The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nNo OTU existed at a prevalence greater than 6.2% in the entire host community (i.e. across all host species). When viral metacommunities were examined at the level of host population (i.e. in a single species), however, OTU prevalence reached a peak of 26.3% (OTU 17 in A. jamaicensis; Table 2 ). At the population-level, four OTUs reached a prevalence greater than 20%, and 29 OTUs existed at prevalence values between 1% and 10%. Five OTUs existed at a prevalence less than 1% in all of their host populations. OTU richness per host population ranged from three to 15. In comparison, humans are the only host species for which comprehensive data are available on total herpesvirus richness, and only eight known herpesvirus species infect humans, despite their cosmopolitan distribution.\n\nThe Chao2 estimate of herpesvirus richness in the bats of both caves was 51.1 OTUs (Table 1 ). As such, the detected OTUs (N = 41) represent about 80% of those in the entire herpesvirus metacommunity (Figure 3 ). Viral discovery curves were more saturated in Culebrones (85%) than in Larva (61%) Cave, and host species-level saturation ranged from 55% (P. quadridens) to 93% (B. cavernarum) (Table 1; Figure 3) . A viral discovery curve was not generated for the herpesvirus metacommunity infecting P. portoricensis, as only three OTUs were detected.\n\nHost Preference: Thirteen OTUs were detected in one or more host species (Table 3) . S TD * for each of these OTUs ranged from one (infecting two hosts from the same genus) to three (infecting three hosts of two families). Nine OTUs had significantly higher prevalence in a core host species than in all other host species combined (Table 4 ). Only two OTUs showed significantly higher prevalence in one host sex than in the other (Table 5) . OTU 1 infected a significantly higher percentage of male than female P. quadridens (p = 0.021), and OTU 21 infected a significantly higher percentage of female than male Mon. redmani (p = 0.023).\n\nOur extensive quantification of viral infection in bats represents the first comprehensive study of the virome of a wildlife host community and suggests that Puerto Rican bats offer a .

Even in the absence of full genome sequences, viral OTUs can be robustly differentiated and used to understand the natural history and host specificity of viruses.\n\nThe application of tools and perspectives from community ecology to better understand viral infection dynamics necessitates an objective, quantitatively-supported delineation of viral \"species\". Officially designating novel viral species requires substantial data, oftentimes full genome sequences, and approval by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses ), but has never been used to identify viral OTUs for analyses in the context of community ecology. Here, we show that affinity propagation can be used as a quantitative complement, in congruence with currently defined herpesvirus species, to objectively support current methods of viral OTU delineation.\n\nA limit to working with viruses in an ecological context is the short viral lifespan or activation cycle (e.g. lytic stage), as compared to that in free-living or macroparasitic organisms.\n\nShort lifespans affect temporal turnover of detected OTUs and could influence interpretation of results. Although it is common for some viral infections to last only hours or days, the lytic cycle of herpesvirus infections is typically longer than that of most other viruses (King et al. 2012 ).\n\nThis represents an advantage in the use of herpesviruses for preliminary exploration of viral ecology, as the duration during which OTUs can be detected will be greater than that of other .

Indeed, all OTUs detected during preliminary sampling in 2016 (i.e. OTUs 12, 17, and 25) were detected again in 2017, in the same core host species (Table 2) .\n\nAnother advantage to studying herpesviruses from an ecological context is that this viral family often exists at high prevalence levels (Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Cortez et al. 2008 , Imbronito et al. 2008 , Tenorio de Franca et al. 2012 , Phalen et al. 2017 , Tazikeh et al. 2019 . While some surveys (e.g. Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Phalen et al. 2017 show Generally, herpesviruses are highly host specific, but when host-virus relationships are examined at an evolutionary timescale, host switching has been the norm (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016 , Azab et al. 2018 . As such, we expected herpesviruses that infected multiple host species to have core hosts. Overall, we found evidence of host sharing among bat species at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve, regardless of cave. The existence of host sharing is further supported by viral prevalence and viral discovery curves. A higher prevalence at the populationlevel (i.e. a single species) than the community-level, as seen here (Table 2) , is consistent with host-specificity. Also, at the largest scale (i.e. the entire nature reserve), sampling completeness reached 80%. This is in contrast to accumulation curves for viral metacommunities infecting particular host populations, which were as low as 55% (P. quadridens). This suggests that undiscovered OTUs at the scale of host population have already been discovered at the scale of nature reserve (i.e. have already been discovered in another host species). This supports the hypothesis that certain OTUs that are common in a core host are rare in all other host species.\n\nIndeed, nine of the 13 multi-host OTUs had significantly higher prevalence in a single host than in all other hosts in which it occurred combined ( Table 3 ). Those that did not have significantly different prevalence were rare OTUs in all infected hosts (OTU 7, OTU 15, OTU 26), or were .

Future studies with goals of monitoring public health should increase the number of sampled individuals for each host species to enhance the likelihood of uncovering patterns of host preference and reservoir status. Studies aimed at viral ecology will likely require focus on more prevalent viral taxa, such as herpesviruses, instead of rare viral taxa of more zoonotic concern, such as coronaviruses or filoviruses. Further ecological research should prioritize sampling host individuals from multiple field locations, addressing viral infection and transmission at multiple spatial scales, while decoupling the spatial and ecological mechanisms that shape viral community assembly.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Armando Rodriguez-Duran for invaluable logistical help in the field, as well as the intrepid field team, including Sarah Stankavich, Jose Rivera, Melanie Figure 1 : Percent Identity (PID) histograms of herpesviruses using the alignment of all clones (a) and pairwise alignment of clones (b).

OTUs are named to reflect manual refinement of OTUs after affinity propagation. For example, affinity propagation separated OTU 28, a gammaherpesvirus, into four separate clusters. However, the similarity of the exemplars suggested that these clusters should all be grouped into a single OTU. These trees provide biological support for the manual refinement of OTUs. OTUs 39-41, all betaherpesviruses, were not included in the tree. These OTUs were represented by three highly divergent sequences (< 50% genetic similarity), and their inclusion in the tree impaired visualization of all other relationships.\n\nFigure 3: Viral discovery curves comparing number of detected herpesvirus (OTU richness) with number of sampled host bats for all bats at Mata de Pl\u00e1tano Nature Reserve (top panel) and for each host species (bottom six panels).
