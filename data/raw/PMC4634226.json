{"title": "Epidemiological study of influenza virus infections in young adult outpatients from Buenos Aires, Argentina", "body": "Adult outpatients with ILI attending the emergency room of a University Hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Centro de Educaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica e Investigacion Cl\u00ednica, CEMIC) during two consecutive winters (May\u2013September 2004 and June\u2013September 2005), were included. These periods corresponded to the 18\u201339 and 24\u201334 epidemiological weeks, respectively. Influenza\u2010like illness was defined as fever (>38\u00b0C) at least once during the last 72 hours of symptoms and at least one upper respiratory sign/symptom (cough, nasal discharge, throat sore) and at least one of the following systemic sign/symptom: headache, myalgias, malaise, chills, prostration. The patients who gathered the inclusion criteria were invited to read and sign the informed consent and those who accepted were included in the study.\n\nThroat and nasal swabs were collected at the emergency room and sent in viral transport media to the Virology Laboratory. Clinical data including age, symptoms, Flu vaccination, presence of immunosupression and clinical management at the end of the visit were recorded in a form specially designed for this study. The attending physician at the emergency room decided whether the patient required symptomatic and/or antiviral or antibiotic treatment. This study was approved by the local IRB.\n\nSamples were processed by IIF with monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) for Flu A, Flu B, parainfluenza, adenovirus and RSV. All samples (n = 151) were tested by IIF and RT\u2010PCR for hMPV detection. In addition, specimens from year 2004 were retrospectively cultured for Flu and adenovirus detection by inoculation in MDCK and HEp\u20102 cell lines.\n\nPatients with a positive viral result by IIF were telephoned within 24 hours by the principal investigator to evaluate any complications, evaluate the utility of viral treatment, and suggest infection control measures. When a complication was suspected, the patient was reexamined.\n\nFlu positive samples were sent to the National Center of Influenza (INES\u2010ANLIS Carlos G. Malbr\u00e1n) for characterization of the strains by hemoagglutination\u2010inhibition test.\n\nStudent\u2019s t\u2010test was used to analyze continuous variables and chi\u2010square test for categorical ones. Relationship between variables was evaluated using Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Statistical significance was assumed for P values of less than 0\u00b705.\n\nLogistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and its respective confidence intervals.\n\nOf the 152 specimens received at the laboratory, 151 (99%) were adequate in cells for diagnosis by IIF. For year 2004, 11 samples were Flu A positive and 3 were Flu B positive by IIF. Cell culture allowed to detect three more Flu A cases; three more Flu B cases and one adenovirus case (Table 1). The sensitivity of IIF compared to cell culture for Flu was 70%.\n\nDuring both years, circulation of Flu A was detected up to week 30, while few cases of Flu B were observed during the whole studied period. RSV was only detected in 2005.\n\nAll Flu A strains were subtyped as H3. For 2004, four Flu A isolates were similar to the 2004 vaccine strain A/Fujian/411/02 (H3N2) and four were antigenically different from vaccine virus, but closely related to A/Wellington/1/2004 (H3N2). The rest could not be characterized. For 2005, characterization was achieved in 13 samples only, 11 Flu A and 2 Flu B. All Flu A strains were characterized as A/California/7/04 (H3N2) and were closely related to 2005 vaccine strain A/Wellington/1/2004 (H3N2). For Flu B, one strain was similar to B/Hong Kong/330/01 (Victoria lineage) vaccine strain for 2004, and the other corresponded to B/Shangai/361/02 (Yamagata lineage), vaccine strain for the Southern hemisphere for 2005.\n\nThe mean age of the patients was 36\u00b76 years (SD 13\u00b76), predominantly female (60%). There were no statistical differences between the positive and negative groups regarding sex or age (Table 2).\n\nOf 151 patients, only 12 (10%) had received the annual Flu vaccine. One of them was an immunocompromised HIV\u2010infected patient who was Flu A positive.\n\nNone of the signs and symptoms were significantly associated with positive or negative results (Table 2). No complications were reported and none of the patients required hospitalization.\n\nOnly one Flu A positive patient received empirical oseltamivir at the emergency room because she had a renal transplant and was under immunosuppressive treatment. The rest of the patients consulted in an average of 43 hours after the symptoms started. In addition, viral diagnosis by IFI was not always available in the same day. As oseltamivir is effective within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, we could not implement treatment in our patients.\n\nInadequate use of antibiotics was not observed in this study. Only two Flu negative patients were given empirical antibiotics, as they developed bacterial pneumonia and had to be hospitalized.\n\nIn this study, 38% of the young adult outpatients with ILI had a viral etiology, 33% corresponded to Flu virus followed by RSV (3%). Other studies have shown similar or even lower viral detection in young adults.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n In this study we have only investigated the common respiratory viruses, which are routinely detected by conventional immunofluorescence assays with monoclonal antibodies or by cell culture. Therefore, if molecular methods would have been used, viral detection would have possibly been higher.\n13\n This concept is especially true for viruses such as RSV for which IIF is not recommended for diagnosis in adults.\n14\n Nevertheless, in all studies a significant proportion of patients with ILI remain without etiological diagnosis. This leads us to the inevitable question: what other agents cause the majority of the ILI in our adult population? Other viruses such as rhinovirus, enteroviruses, the new coronavirus and bocavirus could be implicated, but it would not be surprising if new viruses causing ILI were discovered in the near future.\n\nMoreover, the application of molecular methods had revealed the existence of coinfections with two or more respiratory viruses. The clinical significance of these findings has yet to be determined.\n\nNo correlation was observed between specific signs and symptoms and etiology. This reinforces the need for a rapid viral diagnosis in order to define etiology, prevent indiscriminate use of antibiotics, reduce unnecessary interventions and implement infection\u2010control measures including isolation of infected individuals. Lina and Valette. also observed that viral etiology in patients with ILI disease cannot be predicted on the basis of their clinical picture only.\n15\n\n\n\nFlu virus only responds to the use of antivirals if the treatment is started within the first 2 days of the onset of fever. In our study, most of the patients consulted after 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. In addition, viral diagnosis by IFI was not available in the same day. Therefore, our results were not useful in a timely manner for antiviral treatment. Rapid antigen devices for Flu which can give a result within the hour are useful in these cases. On the other side, viral etiology permitted infection control measures, like patient isolation. This is particularly important in the high\u2010risk population such as immunocompromised patients and their close contacts. In addition, viral etiology contributed to epidemiological data and permitted identification of circulating strains.\n\nMost of Flu strains from our patients were similar to the corresponding vaccine strains for the Southern hemisphere for the correspondent year. Diagnosis and specific characterization of Flu strains is important in order to provide early warning on a potential Flu pandemic or epidemic.\n\nIn conclusion, viral diagnosis was achieved in almost 40% of the patients with ILI. The most frequent virus was Flu A followed by Flu B and RSV. Human metapneumovirus was detected in only 1\u00b73% of the cases, similar to what was described previously.\n16\n\n\n\nThis study represents the first one evaluating viral etiology in young adult outpatients with ILI in Argentina."}
