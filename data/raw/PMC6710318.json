{"title": "A Competency Framework for Developing Global Laboratory Leaders", "body": "The CF was developed through a consensus process involving subject matter experts from the aforementioned GLLP partners. In October 2017, the partners established the GLLP Competency Framework Development Workgroup comprised of laboratorians as well as learning experts from each organization. The following nine competencies were selected through extensive discussion and debate considering the relevant literature [(20, 21) and World Health Organization, unpublished report of the WHO laboratory leadership and management training programme meeting. Lyon, France 12-13 May 2011], each partner's expertise, experience and lessons learned in the field, as well as a consideration of the past, present and future role of health laboratories across the globe:\nLaboratory systemLeadershipManagementCommunicationQuality management systemBiosafety and biosecurityDisease surveillance and outbreak investigationEmergency preparedness, response and recoveryResearch\n\nFrom November 2017 to March 2018, the Workgroup designed the structure of the framework, developed descriptions of each competency and defined competency domains, subdomains, and areas of activity. The action verbs that describe the levels of proficiency for each area of activity were developed based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) (22) and Bloom's (23) taxonomies. Some modifications of the verbs were incorporated to represent learning outcomes specifically related to leadership. Performance activities are associated with levels of proficiency and are presented at three levels\u2014developing, skilled, and expert.\n\nMultisectoral laboratory workforce development is essential and the use of common competencies across disciplines and organizations can facilitate communication and cooperation and allow for career development and growth. The CF specifically integrates competencies applicable to laboratory experts and current leaders and managers from different sectors addressing and aligning disparate terminology. This CF can therefore be used by national authorities from all sectors and disciplines: policy makers, regulatory agencies, educational institutions, and other stakeholders including donors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector (24).\n\nThe CF was designed to outline the nine essential competencies needed for laboratory leaders to build sustainable national health laboratory systems that improve disease and chemical/residue detection, control and prevention efforts. Table 1 provides an overview of the CF design. Competency areas may be applied in all sectors of the national health laboratory system, at the system level and/or the facility level and duplication of areas across competencies is intentional to facilitate flexible use of the framework. Descriptions of each competency follow:\n\nA laboratory system and the network of laboratories that make up the system (within a respective jurisdiction, e.g., at the country level) are key to the provision of laboratory services in support of a health system. This competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to develop, maintain and strengthen a complete and functional health laboratory system capable of producing high quality results with efficient and effective procedures, administration and policies throughout all levels of the health system.\n\nLeadership is essential for success in the fast-paced, changing environment of health laboratory systems. This competency comprises the knowledge, skills and abilities essential for a leader to motivate and inspire a group of people to act toward achieving a common goal. This includes strategic approaches with vision and plans for sustainable and improved success of the laboratories or laboratory systems through the process of positively influencing the actions to attain desired outcomes.\n\nStrategic management of materials and personnel is necessary for success particularly in an environment where resources may be limited. Without sound management, leadership vision cannot be attained. This competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to effectively and efficiently achieve quality laboratory results using available resources. Management of the laboratory may include operational management as well as long-term strategic planning, to achieve the leadership vision.\n\nAppropriate communication in all forms is vital for successful leadership and management. This competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to communicate laboratory findings and laboratory system related information across sectors and disciplines in a clear and concise manner adjusted to the level and type of audience.\n\nThe cornerstone of a successful laboratory system is quality results that are reliable, repeatable and timely, and thus allow effective decision-making related to patient care, public health or health policy. The knowledge, skills and abilities to implement and sustain a national quality management system and a culture of quality in laboratory operations are included in this competency.\n\nStrong leadership is needed to ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect laboratory personnel and the population from biosafety or biosecurity breaches. This competency contains the knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure the laboratory system is operating in a way that optimally minimizes and manages the risks related to biohazards.\n\nLaboratory data is essential for accurate disease surveillance, detection and investigation. This competency comprises the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the on-going, routine management of a health surveillance system including outbreak detection and response, both at the laboratory system level as well as in an individual laboratory.\n\nEmergencies, both man-made and natural, provide unique challenges to a laboratory system and require sufficient planning and preparation across involved sectors for an adequate and coordinated response. The knowledge, skills and abilities needed to prepare for, respond to and recover from an emergency or other natural or human-caused adverse health event are contained in this competency.\n\nAlthough often neglected, laboratory research is a critical part of effective and innovative laboratory management and contributes to the strength of laboratory development and sustainability. This competency comprises the knowledge, skills and abilities needed to plan, conduct and analyze hypothesis-driven investigations that include innovative approaches and methods, testing and evaluation designed to advance health by correlating basic science with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory practice across sectors and disciplines.\n\nA sample of the CF is shown in Table 2. The complete CF can be found here: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311445/9789241515108-eng.pdf\n\nThe CF serves as a foundation for the GLLP, a comprehensive program encompassing the nine laboratory leadership competencies. The six GLLP partners are currently developing the GLLP Learning Package based on the CF. The GLLP will allow countries to adapt programs to meet their exact needs and the GLLP Learning Package will include core course materials and guidance for program development, planning, implementation and evaluation in any country or educational institution in the world. The GLLP takes into account adult learning principles and is designed to be complementary to mid-career level individuals.\n\nIdeally, when developing learning and training programs using the CF, the nine competencies will be taken in their entirety with activity areas in each competency reinforcing other competencies and providing a holistic approach to leadership development. Graduates of a laboratory leadership program designed around the CF should be required to complete and/or demonstrate proficiency in all competencies. However, each competency is designed to allow complementary learning opportunities for individual and specific competency development as needed. Competency-based program development allows separation of course materials into discrete units to address individual or group needs.\n\nThe CF and upcoming implementation of the GLLP provide an innovative One Health approach to the development of laboratory leaders with the knowledge, skills and abilities to build bridges, enhance communication, foster collaboration and develop an understanding of existing synergies between the human, animal, environmental and other relevant health sectors. The CF represents the first global consensus on laboratory leadership competencies and provides structure for the development of leaders of the laboratory system by addressing gaps in current laboratory leadership learning programs. Fostering and mentoring laboratory leaders who understand the need for collaboration between all sectors of health laboratories will allow national health laboratory systems to grow and flourish through communication and coordination of activities. In a world where health events are becoming increasingly complex and can rarely be managed by a single sector alone, this CF was developed to enable leaders to set up multidisciplinary teams to respond to such health events as well as to promote a multidisciplinary vision for the management of laboratories and laboratory systems.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
