{"title": "Control of Virus-Induced Cell Fusion by Host Cell Lipid Composition", "body": "Cell fusion in virus-infected tissues has, been described for over 100 years, and numerous viruses are capable of inducing polykaryocytosis under experimental conditions (reviewed by Roizman, 1962; Spear, 1987) . In particular, most enveloped viruses are capable of inducing membrane fusion as a consequence of their infectious strategy: successful delivery of the viral genome into the host cell requires fusion either with the surface membrane of the cell (Dales, 1973) or with internal vesicles following endocytosis (White et a/., 1983) . Later in infection, the appearance of viral fusion proteins on the surface membranes of infected cells may cause the fusion of adjacent cells with each other, but for reasons not yet entirely understood, the extent of such fusion can vary considerably among different cell types infected with the same virus (Holmes and Choppin, 1966; Wang et al., 1982) .\n\nWe have previously studied chemically induced cell fusion in cultured mouse fibroblasts treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) . A series of cell lines with reduced susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion was selected by repeated cycles of PEG treatment (Roos and Davidson, 1980) . The most highly PEG-resistant mutants exhibit ~20% fusion under conditions where virtually 100% of the parental cells fuse (Roos et a/., 1983) . These cells lines are altered with respect to other membrane-associated phenomena as well, including the frequency of spontaneous hybridization (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) , nonspecific adsorptive endocytosis and fluid-phase pinocytosis (Li et a/., 1986; Ryser et al., 1988) , and tumorigenicity and metastatic spread in viva (Roos and Choppin, 1984) .\n\nSeveral biochemical alterations have been noted in the PEG-resistant mutants, including much more highly saturated fatty acyl chains than found in the parental cells from which they were derived, and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid (Roos and Choppin, 1985a) . Through the manipulation of cellular lipid content, we have directly demonstrated a link between fusion response and lipid composition in the PEG-fusion system: alteration of acyl chain saturation in these cells allows complete control over susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion (Roos and Choppin, 198513) .\n\nIn the experiments described here, virus-induced fusion has been examined in these cells resistant to PEGinduced fusion. Surprisingly, increasingly PEG-resistant cells are increasingly sensitive to fusion induced by a wide range of viruses. Nevertheless, virus-induced fusion in this system can also be controlled by the manipulation of cellular acyl-chain saturation. These findings have interesting implications for host and tissue specificity of viral pathogenesis.\n\nThe cell lines used in this study have previously been described and characterized (Roos and Davidson, 1980; Roos eta/., 1983) . The parental cell line was originally isolated as a 5-BrdU-resistant mouse L-cell clone (Kit et al., 1963) and is referred to as Clone 1 D. PEGresistant derivatives of Clone 1 D were isolated by repeated cycles of treatment with fusogenic concentrations of PEG followed by outgrowth of the remaining unfused cells. Cells isolated in this manner are designated F,, F2, . . ., where the subscripted number refers to the number of cycles of selection used to produce that cell line. Previous studies have demonstrated that each of these lines is homogeneous in its response to PEG and that its fusion phenotype is stable for several hundred generations in continuous culture (Roos and Davidson, 1980) . All cell culture was performed in plastic tissue culture ware (Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA) using Dulbecco's reinforced Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 1 Oq/o heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Flow Laboratories, Inc., McLean, VA). Cells were maintained at 37\" in a humid environment containing 7% CO,.\n\nThe \"Z\" strain of Sendai virus was grown in the allantoic sac of lo-day-old embryonated eggs by inoculation with a 1 O-4 dilution of stockvirus (-1 06.5 50% egginfective dose) in 100 ~1 Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Virus (\"1024 HAU/mI) was harvested 48 hr after infection and concentrated as previously described (Hsu et al., 1979) . Inactivated virus was prepared by irradiating a 2-mm pool of virus for 15 min at a distance of 15 cm from a short-wave ultraviolet lamp (Model UVSL-58; Ultraviolet Products, San Gabriel, CA).\n\nAll other viruses were grown in tissue culture. Cell monolayers (grown as described for Clone 1 D cells, above) were rinsed with PBS without divalent cations (rinse omitted for murine hepatitis virus (MHV)), inoculated with virus, and incubated for l-2 hr at 37\" with occasional rocking, after which the monolayers were again aspirated and rinsed with PBS, and fresh growth medium was added. The W2 strain of simian virus 5 (SV5; Holmes and Choppin, 1966) was grown in CV-1 African green monkey kidney cells inoculated with a 1 OOO-fold dilution of seed stock (-20 PFU/cell) in Dulbecco's reinforced Eagle's medium containing 1% BSA. Hemagglutination titers of the supernatant medium were measured periodically, and virus was harvested 24-36 hr postinfection. Further concentration and inactivation of SV5 was performed as for Sendai virus. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana serotype) was grown in BHK-21 cells by inoculation at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cell and harvested 20 hr postinfection. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV, strain A59) was grown in 17-Clone 1 cells inoculated with 1 PFU/cell in Dulbecco's reinforced Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and harvested 16-24 hr postinfection as previously described (Holmes et a/., 1981) .\n\nHemagglutination assays were performed using serial twofold dilutions of virus stock in PBS (without divalent cations). To a final volume of 100 ~1 of these dilutions was added an additional 100 ~1 of a 0.5% solution of chicken red blood cells in PBS. Plates were incubated at 4\" for l-2 hr and the titer was read as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of virus yielding definite agglutination of erythrocytes.\n\nPlaque assays were performed in 35-mm petri dishes using confluent monolayers of BHK-21 cells (for Sendai, SV5, and VSV) or 17-Clone 1 cells (for MHV). Cells were inoculated with serial 1 O-fold dilutions of virus in 0.5 ml and incubated for l-2 hr with occasional shaking. After infection, residual medium was aspirated and replaced with 3 ml of a 1 :l mixture of 1.9% bactoagar and 2X Eagle's medium containing 8% calf serum and 4% tryptose phosphate broth (omitted for MHV). Plates were incubated at 37\" until cytopathic effects were observed, stained by the addition of 1 ml agar solution containing 0.01% neutral red dye, and plaques were scored the next day.\n\nPetri dishes (35 mm) containing 25 mm round No. 1 glass coverslips were inoculated with 1.5 X 10\" Clone 1 D cells, 1.3 X 1 O6 F,, cells, or 1.1 X 1 O6 F40 cells in 3 ml medium and incubated -24 hr prior to fusion. These procedures produce confluent monolayers of cells for treatment with virus or PEG. (The different cell lines are initially plated at differing densities to compensate for inherent differences in growth rate; Roos, 1984.) In experiments where lipid supplements were added, fatty acids were prepared as 1 O-' M stock solu-tions in 3 X lo-\" n/r NaOH, and 300 ~1 of this solution was added to the culture medium -12 hr after plating (final concentration 1 Om4 molar lipid). Cells were incubated with lipid for 18 hr prior to fusion (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) .\n\nTwo procedures were followed for viral fusion assays. Viruses which are incapable of productive growth in these cells (Sendai and SV5) were concentrated and inactivated as described above, and 500 ~1 of high-titer virus (>5000 HAL-J/ml, > 1000 PFU/cell) was allowed to attach to cells at 4\". Cultures were then rapidly warmed to 37\", allowing fusion to proceed. Under these conditions, maximal fusion was seen within 4 hrof virus addition. For MHV and VSV, cells were inoculated with stock virus (l-5 PFU/cell) and infection was allowed to proceed for 16-20 hr before fixation.\n\nFusion with polyethylene glycol was accomplished as previously described (Robinson et a/., 1979) . PEG-1000 (J. T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, NJ) was prepared as a 509/o solution in Dulbecco's reinforced Eagle's medium without serum. Cells grown on coverslips were removed to a fresh dish where they were treated with 2 ml PEG solution at 37\" for 60 set, followed by a series of rapid rinses through several containers of warm medium without serum. Finally, the coverslips were transferred to a fresh dish and incubated in fresh medium for 2-3 hr in order to allow fusion to proceed. Cells were prepared for microscopic evaluation by rinsing in PBS, fixation in methanol, and staining with Giemsa (Fisher Scientific Co., Fair Lawn, NJ). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Gurr's aqueous mountant (Bio/medical Specialties, Santa Monica, CA) and observed under a Zeiss Photomicroscope III. For quantitative analysis, confluent fields were selected randomly at low magnification where cellular morphology could not be distinguished. The objective was switched to high magnification (400X) and all nuclei within a 200~pm square were scored as present in mononucleate or fused cells without further selection of field. At least 10 fields were counted per sample, and the results were corrected for spontaneously occurring fusion, determined from parallel plates of uninfected cells (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) .\n\nFatty acid analysis and preparation of lipid supplements Cellular fatty acid composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography as previously described (Roos and Choppin, 1985a) , using cultures prepared in parallel with those used for fusion.\n\nProcedures for the preparation of fatty acid supplements have previously been described (Roos and Choppin, 198513) . Fatty acids, pure by thin-layer chromatography, were obtained from Nu-chek prep (Elysian, MN) either as sodium salts or as free acids which were converted to salts by dissolution in a threefold molarexcess of NaOH. In some experiments, fatty acid salts were conjugated to bovine serum albumin according to Spector et al. (1979) using \"essentially fatty acid-free\" BSA obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Supplements were added directly to the growth medium from 1 O-* Mstocks (5 X 1 Oe3 M stocks for BSA conjugates). Lipid stocks were stored in the dark at -20\" under N, in acid-washed glass tubes sealed with Teflon-lined caps, and periodic analysis by gas-liquid chromatography revealed no detectable breakdown over the course of this study. lmmunostaining Cells grown on coverslips were infected with MHV, fixed at various times in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.29/o Nonidet-P40 for 4 min, and washed overnight in PBS at 4'. Fixed cells were prepared for staining by incubation for 3 min in 0.3% H202 in methanol, followed by 20 min in 1% BSA (in PBS), and blocking of nonspecific binding with normal goat serum. MHV antigens were labeled using a 1: 100 dilution of ascites fluid from mice infected with the JHM strain of MHV (prepared by Dr. S. G. Robbins, Uniformed Services Univ., Bethesda, MD). This antiserum recognizes all structural proteins of strain A59. Staining was accomplished using the Vecta-stain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nWe have previously described the process of PEGmediated cell fusion (Robinson et al., 1979; Roos et a/., 1983) and the genetic analysis of the PEG-resistant cell lines used in this study (Roos and Davidson, 1980) . Because of the striking differences in susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion between Clone 1 D (the parental mouse L-cell line) and the various mutants derived from it (such as our most highly PEG-resistant line, designated F40), it was of interest to examine the behavior of these cells in response to fusogenic viruses. The morphology of Clone 1 D cells and the F,, mutants treated with various enveloped viruses is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Quantitative data on cell fusion are presented in Fig. 2 . Less than 5% fusion was seen when Clone 1 D cells were incubated with high titers of uv-inactivated Sendai virus ( Fig. 1 A) , but significantly more fusion was observed in F,, ceils under these conditions ( Fig. 1 B) . Mouse L cells do not support productive Sendai virus infection, and hence these experiments were performed using high concentrations of exogenously added virus, (termed \"fusion from without\"; Bratt and Gallaher, 1969) . VSV will replicate in L cells, and the morphology of VSV-infected Clone 1 D and FJO cells is illustrated in Figs. 1 C and 1 D. Infected cells detach from the culture surface and eventually die when infected with VSV, but it is clear that more cell fusion was induced in F,, than in Clone 1 D. (Quantitation of fusion in Fig. 2 was carried out before the cytolytic effects of VSV were as evident as shown in Fig. 1 .)\n\nThe most effective virus in causing fusion of these ceils was MHV, which induced 60% fusion in FdO cells, but only 19% fusion in Clone 1 D (average of five experiments). Representative micrographs of MHV-infected cells are shown in Figs. 1 E and 1 F. Similar results have also been obtained for SV5 (Fig. 2) and several other enveloped viruses, including visna virus (a sheep lentivirus; Harter and Choppin, 1967) and influenza virus (an orthomyxovirus; fusion performed at pH 5 according to the procedures of although fusion induced by these viruses was less extensive than with MHV (data not shown). In all cases Clone 1 D cells were less susceptible to fusion than the FaO mutants. This finding is precisely the opposite of the responses observed for chemical fusogens: Clone 1 D cells are highly fusible with PEG (93% fusion), while F,, cells were isolated by virtue of their resistance to PEGinduced fusion (19%). Thus, susceptibility to chemical-and virus-induced fusion is inversely correlated in these cells.\n\nDifferences in the nature of fused syncytia (giant cells) formed following infection of Clone 1 D or FdO cells with MHV versus treatment with PEG can be seen in Table 1 . While PEG treatment caused nearly all Clone 1 D cells to fuse, most of the fusion products formed were of moderate size (median size of giant cells = 8 nuclei). PEG-resistant cell lines F,6 and F,, formed only small multinucleates.\n\nBy contrast, most virus-induced syncytia were very large, even for Clone 1 D, where the a The standard deviation presented Indicates the range of fusion product sizes obtained, not variation between experiments. The average srze of fusron products, range of srzes, and overall extent of fusron was highly reproducible (cf. error bars In Frg. 2). overall level of fusion was not very extensive (129/o fusion; median size of fusion products = 45 nuclei). Figure 3 presents a more detailed analysis of the size of syncytia formed during PEG-or MHV-induced fusion. We have previously reported on the spectrum of sizes of fused cells formed following PEG treatment (Roos and Davidson, 1980) . In general, PEG-induced fusion can be viewed as a stochastic process, with the probability of fusion between any two adjacent cells being determined by the cell lines involved and the conditions of treatment (Rohme, 1981; Rijhme and Thorburn, 1981) . Such conditions produce a smooth distribution in the sizes of syncytia formed, as illustrated by the lines without symbols in the background of Fig. 3 representing the PEG-fusion response of Clone 1 D and several PEG-resistant cell lines. For example, PEG treatment of FZ4 cells (uppermost background line) left 77% of all cells as unfused mononucleates, 88% as mono-or dinucleates, 99% as syncytia containing five or fewer nuclei, and no fused cells containing more than 20 nuclei. Extensive fusion, as found in PEGtreated Clone 1 D cells, produced a broad spectrum of fusion products of all sizes (standard deviation > 100%; Table 1 ). This picture is very different from the spectrum of syncytia observed in virus-infected cells, as shown by the lines with symbols in Fig. 3 . Slightly less than 50% of all cells in MHV-infected F4,, cultures remained as unfused (mononucleate) cells, similar to the effects of PEG on F,6 cells. But while only 7% of the PEG-treated F,6 cells formed giant cells containing more than 20 nuclei, the great majority of fused cells in virus-infected FaO cultures were found in large syncytia-84% of all those FJO cells which fused at all fused into giant cells with 220 nuclei. The average size of fusion products in PEG-treated F16 cultures contained only 3 nuclei: average size in MHV-infected F4,, was 29 nuclei (Table 1) . Fusion was rare in MHV-infected Clone 1 D cells (12% in the experiments from which this figure was compiled), but virtually all of those fusions which did occur produced very large multinucleates (as seen in Fig. 1 E) . Overall, while PEG fusion produces a wide spectrum of fused cells of many sizes, most fusion observed in MHV-infected cells tends to be in the form of large syncytia.\n\nFusion response of lipid supplemented cells FJO cells and other fusion-altered cell lines are characterized by several peculiarities in their lipid content (Roos and Choppin, 1985a) . In particular, the ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains in Clone 1 D is -1 :l , while this ratio is -3.5:l in FaO. FdO cells also contain unusually high concentrations of neutral ether-linked lipid, which may serve to deliver saturated fatty acids to the cell membrane (Roes, 1988) . The acyl-chain composition of these cells has proved susceptible to manipulation in culture, demonstrating a direct link between lipid saturation and susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) . We have used the same procedures of lipid alteration which were effective in controlling PEG-induced fusion to determine the effects of fatty acyl-chain saturation on coronavirus-induced fusion. Figure 4 shows cultures of MHV-infected Clone 1D or Fe0 cells grown in normal medium or in medium supplemented with 1 Oe4 AA linolenic (1 8:35) or nonadecanoic (19:O) acids. As already seen, MHV infection of control cells produces little fusion in cultures of Clone 1 D and extensive fusion of F4,, cells (cf. Figs. 4A and 48) . However, when the acyl chains of F40 cells were induced to become more like Clone 1 D by preincubation in the presence of 1 Oe4 n/r polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) for 18 hr prior to virus infection, these lipid-altered F4,., cells became highly resistant to MHV-induced fusion (Fig. 4D) . Conversely, Clone 1 D cells which were preincubated in saturated fatty acid (19:O) were extensively fused by MHV (Fig. 4E) , as normally seen only in F,, cells.\n\nTo more directly explore the relationship between fatty acid supplements and virus-induced fusion, parallel dishes of cells were supplemented with 1 OA4 M fatty acid and either infected with MHV or extracted for lipid analysis. Quantitative data on the lipid composition and fusion-response of lipid-supplemented cultures and unmodified controls are presented in Table 2 . Acylchain composition of both Clone 1 D and F40 cells grown with added 18:3 became highly unsaturated, and the MHV-fusion response changed accordingly, to levels even lower than normally seen in untreated Clone 1 D cells. The addition of 19:O to Clone 1 D cells increased both chain saturation and cell fusion to levels observed in untreated cultures of F4,., More detailed study has indicated that fatty acid supplements are incorporated into both neutral and phospholipids throughout the cell, including the plasma membrane, and that there is little metabolic alteration of the incorporated acyl chains over the course of these experiments (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) . We have achieved similar results using other saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (including palmitic [16:0], stearic [18: 01, and linoleic [18:2] acids; data not shown). In every case, manipulation of the ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated acyl chains produced a parallel change in susceptibility to virus-induced fusion; i.e., increased saturation stimulated virus-induced fusion, while decreased saturation inhibited the fusion response.\n\nThe procedure employed for the selection of PEGresistant cells produced a series of cell lines of which F,, is the most highly altered. The intervening cell lines (F,, F8, etc.) are stable, homogeneous lines whose fusion responses are intermediate between Clone 1 D and F4,,, each slightly more resistant to PEG than the previous ones. These cell lines are also intermediate between Clone 1 D and F4,, in their response to fusogenie viruses, as seen in Fig. 2 . Figure 5 demonstrates that parallel cultures of Fls cells can be supplemented with lipids so as to control their fusion response at will. Unsupplemented cultures of F,6 exhibit moderate fusion following treatment with either PEG or MHV (Figs. 5A and 58, respectively) . By the addition of appropriate lipid supplements to the medium, parallel cultures of F,6 can be made either to resemble the PEG-susceptible/virus-resistant phenotype of Clone 1 D (Figs. 5C and 5D; treated with PEG or virus after growth in linolenit acid [18:3]), or to resemble F40 in their resistance to PEG and susceptibility to MHV-induced fusion (Figs. 5E and 5F; grown in nonadecanoic acid [19:0] ). This figure also illustrates the characteristic morphological differences between PEG-and MHV-induced fusion. PEG-treated cells migrate and fuse extensively, but most of this rearrangement occurs within the plane of the culture plate. Virus-infected cells round up (eventually falling off the plate), and viral fusion products form large balls of cells extending far out of the plane of focus.\n\nIt was of interest to determine the relationship between the ability of these various viruses to induce fusion and their ability to infect cells. While all of the viruses studied produced more extensive fusion in FQO cells than in Clone 1 D, the ability to develop productive infection did not always parallel the fusion response. Neither Clone 1 D nor F40 cells produced infectious Sendai virus or SV5 (although both cell lines bound radiolabeled Sendai virus equally well; data not shown). Both cell lines were susceptible to infection with VSV and MHV, however, and each virus exhibited similar plaquing efficiencies on both Clone 1 D and F4,,. Titers of virus harvested from the supernatant medium of infected cultures are shown in Table 3 .\n\nIn cultures without added lipid supplement, F4,, cells produced VSV titers of 6.9 X lo* PFU/ml (average of five experiments). Clone 1 D cells were also susceptible to VSV infection, producing a somewhat lower yield of virus (7 X 10' PFU/ml). Lipid supplementation experiments analogous to those described above for MHV also allow some control of VSV-induced fusion (although the degree of control allowed in these experiments is difficult to assess because overall fusion induced by VSV is so low), but these supplements had little effect on virus titer. -IV (6 As is nints-I PEG a 1 Om4 molar lipid supplement; \"c\" indicates cis configuration; \"t\", trans.\n\nMurine hepatitis virus grew well in Fe0 cells, producing -2 X 1 O7 PFU/ml, but Clone 1 D cells reproducibly produced at least 1 OOO-fold less virus. Supplementation of Clone 1 D cells with saturated fatty acids produced a low, but detectable, titer of infectious virus. Under these conditions, MHV induced considerable fusion (cf. Fig. 4E ). Although the modification of F4,, cells with unsaturated fatty acids dramatically suppressed MHV-induced fusion (Fig. 4D) , lipid supplements did not appear to affect virus production in these cultures.\n\nThe extent of virus infection was also monitored by indirect immunolabeling of MHV-treated cells. Infected cultures of FaO cells confirmed that most cells (including many of those which remained unfused) were producing viral protein. In contrast, infected cultures of Clone 1 D showed viral antigen only in fused cells (Fig.  6) . The pattern of labeling in Clone 1D suggests that infection is spread only by fusion with adjacent cells, sometimes over long distances through attachment processes from giant multinucleates.\n\nWe have used a series of mutant cell lines, resistant to chemical fusogens (such as PEG) by virtue of their altered lipid content, to probe the relationship between host cell lipid composition and virus-induced cell fusion. For a wide variety of fusogenic enveloped viruses, virus-induced fusion is inversely correlated with PEGinduced fusion; i.e., PEG-sensitive cells are virus resistant, and vice versa. The inverse relationship between virus and PEG fusion extends to other cell lines as well: the BHK-21 cell line, for example, frequently studied because of its high susceptibility to virus-induced fusion (Holmes and Choppin, 1966; Helenius et al., 1980) , is highly resistant to PEG (Wang et a/., 1982) .\n\nIt is interesting that PEG-resistant cells are unusually susceptible to virus-induced fusion. Presumably, this finding reflects fundamental differences in the mechanisms by which different fusogens destabilize mem-branes. Inherent differences between PEG-and virusinduced fusion are further indicated by the different spectrum of polykaryocytosis in cells fused by murine hepatitis virus, as seen in Table 1 and Fig. 3 . It is notable, however, that the selection of cells which are resistant to the fusogenic effects of PEG has produced mutants which are also altered in their response to other membrane-active agents, such as fusogenic viruses. Other membrane-associated phenomena are also altered in these cells, including spontaneously occurring fusion (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) , nonspecific adsorptive endocytosis and fluid-phase pinocytosis (Li er al., 1986) (but not receptor-mediated endocytosis; Ryser et al., 1988) , and tumorigenicity and capacity for metastatic spread in viva (Roos and Choppin, 1984) . Like virus-induced fusion, spontaneous hybridization is inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG in these cells (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) .\n\nComparisons between the fusion-altered cell lines under study and the parental Clone 1D cells from which they were derived have previously revealed unusual differences in the lipid composition of the mutants (Roos and Choppin, 1985a) . Two aspects of their lipid composition are particularly well correlated with the PEG-resistant phenotype: increased acyl-chain saturation and the presence of high concentrations of ether-linked neutral lipid. Although these two phenomena may be metabolically linked, a variety of experiments indicate that acyl-chain saturation is the key factor in regulating the fusion response of these cells (Roos, 1988) . Through the use of lipid supplements added to the growth medium of cells in culture, it has been possible to exert virtually complete control over the response of cells to chemical fusogens such as PEG (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) . As reported above, we have now found that the alteration of acyl-chain saturation can be successfully exploited to control virusinduced fusion as well. Thus F,, cells, which are intermediate in their response to both PEG and MHV, can be pushed in either direction: toward the MHV-fusible/ PEG-resistant phenotype of F,, cells or the MHV-resistant/PEG-fusible phenotype characteristic of Clone 1 D, solely by manipulation of the fatty acid content of the medium (Fig. 5) . These findings apply equally to a variety of other cell lines (Roos et a/., 1987) . BHK cells are often studied because of their extreme sensitivity to virus-induced fusion (as noted above), but these cells can be rendered virus-fusion-resistant (and PEG-fusible) by growth in polyunsaturated lipids (unpublished observations). The ability to control both viral and chemical fusion in parallel (although in opposite directions) may reflect similarities in the site (albeit not the mechanism) of action at the cell membrane. This new- FIG. 6 . lmmunostaining of viral proteins in infected cells. Clone 1 D cells infected wrth murine hepatitis vrrus were fixed and processed for microscopy as described under Materials and Methods, using a polyclonal mouse antiserum directed against MHV structural proteins. Viral antigen was found only in multinucleated giant cells, one of which is shown here. Thin extensions can be seen connecting the central syncytium with those outlying cells which stained positively for viral antigen. Neither fusion nor viral protein productron was observed in uninfected cultures (not shown) found control over cell fusion in vitro may also prove useful in technological applications (Roos, 1989) . Mizzen et a/. (1983) studied MHV-induced fusion in an LM TK-mouse cell line closely related to our Clone 1 D cells. These investigators also found LM TK-cells to be resistant to virus-induced fusion (by comparison with the MHV-sensitive cell line L2; Rothfels et a/., 1959) due to some \"inherent property of the LM TKcell membrane.\" Our finding that acyl-chain composition serves to regulate MHV-induced fusion provides a possible biochemical basis for these authors' obsetvations.\n\nMembranes, viral pathogenicity, and host range Several investigators have studied correlations between acyl-chain composition and various aspects of virus virulence. Increased content of unsaturated fatty acids appears to be associated with a decreased hemolysis in Newcastle disease virus (Blenkharn and Apostolov, 1980) and Sendai virus (MacDonald et al., 1984) . Both reports attribute this phenomenon to decreased ability to fuse with the target membrane, consistent with our observations for Clone 1 D cells, which are naturally unsaturated relative to F,, Increased fatty acid saturation is associated with increased virulence (Blenkharn and Apostolov, 198 1; Nozawa and Apostolov, 1982) as seen in our highly saturated mutant cell line F,,, which is highly susceptible to virus-induced fusion.\n\nThe susceptibility of Clone 1 D and F,, cells to virus infection did not always parallel susceptibility to virusinduced fusion. VSV fused F,,, cultures considerably better than Clone 1 D cells, but formed plaques with equal efficiency and grew to high titers in both cell lines. In MHV-infected cultures, however, F,,, produced > 1 OOO-fold more virus than did Clone 1 D. Of particular interest is the observation that control cultures of Clone 1 D cells supplemented with saturated fatty acids (a treatment which strongly stimulates fusion; cf. Fig.  4E ) exhibited a distinct increase in the production of infectious virus ( Table 2 ). The ability of lipid alteration to stimulate the production of infectious virus from a nonpermissive cell line demonstrates that lipid composition can play a functional role in the control of viral host range.\n\nMany viruses are characterized by species and tissue tropisms, and coronaviruses typically exhibit a very limited host range (Lucas et al., 1977; Wege et al,, 1982) . Host permissiveness for MHV varies considerably in different mouse strains and different tissues or cell lines (Bang and Warwick, 1960; Sturman and Takemoto, 1972; Dubois-Dalcq et a/., 1982; Tardieu et al., 1986) . Genetic resistance can result from absence of the MHV receptor from target tissues (Boyle et a/., 1987) , or from defects in later steps in the viral replicative cycle such as penetration, RNA synthesis, or virus assembly and release. MHV-mediated fusion is secondary to binding of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 to the 1 1 0-kDa receptor in the membranes of susceptible cells (Holmes et al., 1984, and unpublished observations) and requires cleavage of the E2 molecule into two 90-kDa fragments Frana et al., 1985; Van Dinter and Flintoff, 1987; Kooi et a/., 1988) .\n\nWe have not yet determined at what stage in the replicative cycle MHV is inhibited in Clone 1 D cells, but the block appears to be early, before the synthesis of viral antigens. The patterns of fusion, antigen distribution, and virus yield observed in MHV-infected Clone 1 D cultures suggest that once inside, the virions readily replicate in these cells, but that release of infectious virus may be inhibited so that the spread of infection is limited to fusion with adjacent cells (Fig. 6 ). This pattern of infection is characteristic of cases where the maturation of virus particles is blocked at the cell membrane, by external experimental manipulations (Graves eta/., 1978; Merz eta/., 1981) , because of a viral defect (Hall and Choppin, 1981) , or through a viral genetic lesion introduced through recombinant techniques (Mc-Cune et al., 1988) . Particularly for enveloped viruses, assembly of new virions appears to be a difficult step, requiring complex membrane interactions (Dubois-Dalcq et a/., 1984) . In attempting to determine the basis for the inhibition of virus production in Clone 1 D cells it may be instructive to examine not only viruspermissive mutants (such as Fa,, cells) but also precursors in the isolation of the LM TK-cell line (Kit et al., 1963) , as mouse fibroblast cell lines are generally susceptible to MHV infection (Mizzen eta/., 1983; Frana et a/., 1985; Kooi et al., 1988) .\n\nThe observation that at least one aspect of viral pathogenesis-cell fusion-can be regulated in this system by cellular acyl-chain saturation suggests that differences in host and tissue lipid composition may also affect viral host range and tissue specificity in nature. The system described above, where a series of well-characterized, closely related cell lines vary dramatically in their response to virus, should prove useful in determining the functions of lipids in the course of virus infection."}
