A systematic review of community-based interventions for emerging zoonotic infectious diseases in Southeast Asia Figure 1: Framework for evaluating the impact of context and behavioural mechanisms on intervention outcomes Review objective/questions", "body": "The 2004 WHO/FAO/OIE joint consultation on emerging zoonotic diseases defined such diseases as, \"a zoonosis that is newly recognized or newly evolved, or that has occurred previously but shows an increase in incidence or expansion in geographical, host or vector range\". 1 Avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus, monkeypox, Hendra virus, and the lentiviruses that cause Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are a few examples of the growing number of diseases that humans can contract from animals.\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region has, unfortunately, been at the epicentre of such epidemics. Over 30 new infectious agents have been detected in the last three decades, 75% of which were zoonotic. 2 A number of factors contribute to these circumstances. The absence of effective surveillance and control programs, prevailing socio-cultural practices and weak public health and veterinary services infrastructure exacerbates the vulnerability of these settings. Other factors including climate change, environmental degradation, encroachment of humans on areas where wildlife exists, cohabitation of humans and food animals within households, and the mixing of species in live animal markets play a role in increased disease transmission.\n\nInfluenza remains a global priority with the potential to cause large, global epidemics. Approximately 10% to 15% of people worldwide contract influenza annually, with attack rates as high as 50% during major epidemics. 3 In 2003 the SARS epidemic affected around 8000 people and killed 780. In 2006 a new avian H5N1, and in 2009, a new H1N1 'swine' influenza pandemic threat, caused widespread anxiety. 4 In addition to mortality and morbidity, zoonotic diseases have and are predicted to cause huge economic losses. The economic cost of the major outbreaks of new epidemic zoonotic diseases over the past decade, including SARS and H5N1 influenza, has been estimated to be $200 billion. 4 To prevent and control zoonotic infections in Southeast Asia (SE Asia), a multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach, involving many levels of the health and non-health sector, is needed, which pre-and post-intervention for seroconversion to assess vaccination coverage. Otherwise, vaccination coverage was estimated by the number of animals vaccinated directly and the number of dogs that accepted bait and subsequently punctured the container. Measurement of the success of the vaccination campaign in the study by Robinson was assessed using dog collars, paint marks or both. 67 Vaccination coverage is summarised as an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. It is worth noting that 18% of dogs included in this estimate as vaccinated did not have a vaccination marker but were self-reported by their owners as vaccinated during the campaign. Robinson et al. also provide data on the likelihood of vaccination following receipt of campaign information as an odds ratio but fail to provide confidence intervals for their estimate.\n\nThe study by Kamoltham et al. 54 reports on a five-year rabies control program in the Phetchabun province of Thailand between 1997 and 2001. The authors use the number of human deaths during the program to measure success of the vaccination program, but this is confounded by the increased uptake of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as a result of expansion of the existing treatment regimen. They also mention increasing awareness of rabies through advocacy in provincial schools, television programs, and newspapers, but do not assess these educational initiatives with knowledge surveys before and after the educational campaign.\n\nThe data published in Soon et al. 68 are from a retrospective case series and presents the number of confirmed cases of rabies in animals in Malaysia from 1946 Malaysia from to 1987 , and information about a rabies control program initiated in 1952. Data on evaluation of the vaccination campaign is not presented, other than to report on the decline in the number of cases of rabies in animals, although the denominator of this main outcome data and how it was sampled is not mentioned.\n\nFinally, the study by Windiyaningsih et al. 81 also describes rabies control measures in response to an outbreak on Flores Island in Indonesia. Control measures implemented included mass culling and canine vaccination, and post-exposure prophylaxis for exposed cases who had suffered an animal bite. It was difficult to calculate the vaccination coverage as the number of dogs vaccinated for each region was not always provided. It was also difficult to assess the success of the campaign as it was confounded by post-exposure prophylaxis administered to exposed cases.\n\nFrom the included papers, data were available for surveillance activities in only two studies 54, 68 Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 10 and\n\n89 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination from the original list of 534 ( Figure   2 ) of which seven studies were critically appraised for methodological quality and subsequently included in the review (Table 13) . Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and include papers which were: review articles which did not present any data on interventions, prevalence surveys, risk factor studies, and clinical and outbreak reports.\n\nTwo studies were outbreak reports of the Malaysian outbreak epidemic 29, 30 and present an epidemic curve of the number of human cases by the date of onset of their illness. Four studies also discussed the National Swine Surveillance Program and subsequent control measures initiated by the Malaysian Government in response to the outbreak. 26, 36, 37, 40 In the final study, 25 authors discuss an active surveillance initiative for the detection of Nipah virus infected swine in Indonesia.\n\nThe quality of the data in the outbreak reports 29, 30 was poor and based primarily on a case series with historical controls. Neither study outlined when the control measures were initiated in relation to the progression of the outbreak. Bunning 29 presented the number of human and swine cases of Nipah virus infection (an epidemic curve) over the period that the interventions were initiated but do not provide a denominator for this data.\n\nThe studies by Ozawa et al., Muniandy et al., Mohd Nor et al. and Arshad et al. 26, 36, 37, 40 describe the National Sero-surveillance program initiated post-outbreak to detect any remaining infected pig farms and abattoirs not already depopulated. The number of abattoirs and farms tested and proportion positive for Nipah virus is presented. All studies discuss the sampling strategy of the program, the results of the laboratory testing and subsequent control measures taken.\n\nAll published evidence included in this systematic review on surveillance and control interventions is based on the outbreak response in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999. Subsequent to 1999, Nipah virus was identified as causing clusters of disease in humans in India and Bangladesh, 83 countries which are outside the scope of this review.\n\nDetails of the surveillance interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 14 and Table 15 . From the included studies, no ongoing routine veterinary or human surveillance appears to have been in place in this region prior to the commencement of the outbreak. Human and swine surveillance was instigated in Malaysia as a measure of active case finding to guide outbreak control measures (the National Swine Surveillance Program). 26, 36, 37, 40 Swine surveillance was also carried out in Indonesia 25 in response to restrictions on the export of Indonesian pork by other Asian countries.\n\nThe National Swine Surveillance Program in Malaysia on farms was carried out till the end of December 2000 to detect and cull additional infected herds, and abattoir surveillance was continued in 2001 and 2002 of all pigs entering abattoirs. 37 While there is evidence that the swine surveillance and subsequent control measures were effective, as Malaysia achieved a Nipah virus -free status by the end of December 2001, no evaluation was carried out and no comment has been made on the feasibility and on-going sustainability of this program.\n\nDespite descriptive reports of on-going surveillance activities such as animal tracking systems (coding of farms, ear tagging and tattooing) to aid trace back, 36, 40 educational programs for farmers and health promotion campaigns, 36 there are no studies that report quantitative data on the functioning of these systems and there has been no evaluation of these systems. Strategies of herd health monitoring and improved farm management practices were also briefly discussed by Mohd Nor. 36 \n\nA number of control measures were discussed in the seven included studies, which included mass culling, quarantining, movement restrictions, education about contact with pigs and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 14 and Table 15 . All interventions were government driven, with involvement from volunteers from non-governmental organisations, farmers and members of the public. 37 Evidence is indicative that infected pigs were required to sustain transmission, based on the decline in the outbreak following movement restrictions on the farmed pig population, culling of infected herds and in the case of the Singaporean outbreak, bans on the importation of pigs from Malaysia by the Singaporean government. However, the evidence included in this review is low quality and based predominantly on the analysis of a case series using historical controls.\n\nWhile there is mention of the total estimated loss to the swine industry in terms of cost, 37 there is no information on the cost of the interventions. The sustainability and feasibility of using these interventions outside of an outbreak situation has not been discussed. The study by Muniandy outlines some future challenges to the swine industry in Malaysia, and makes recommendations for long term reform.\n\nDetails of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table 16 . Several of the studies discussed the enormous impact this outbreak had on the pig industry in Malaysia. 26, 29, 36, 37, 40 The eradication of 1.1 million swine represented about 40% of the swine population in Malaysia in 1999 29 and the number of farms were reduced from 1885 to 829 farms. 36 Many pig farmers lost their livelihoods with the culling of their entire pig farm.\n\nThe outbreak caused dramatic changes in the pig industry, with pig farming only allowed in pig farming areas designated by the government. Restrictions on pork products and live pig exportation of Indonesian pigs by governments of Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines prompted the Indonesian government to initiate swine surveillance in Indonesia to restore faith in the Indonesian swine industry.\n\nThe transmission of Nipah virus was thought to be related to the movement of fruit bat populations in farming areas with the risk of greater exposure of pig farms to foraging fruit bats, although this has not been confirmed. 37 The authors have suggested that intensification of traditional farming systems, particularly of pigs and poultry, has contributed to environments that enhance transmission of diseases from wildlife reservoirs. Furthermore, while intensification and expansion have been ongoing, biosecurity measures, the lack of environmental impact assessments, inadequate pollution and waste management practices have left much to be desired.\n\nMuniandy et al. also recommends changes locally. 37 They refer to a traditional practice amongst pig farmers in Malaysia of sharing boars and moving sows from farm to farm and recommend that this JBI Database of Systematic Reviews & Implementation Reports JBL000603 2013; 11(2) practice be discontinued. In fact, it was the fire sale of sick pigs from one farm in Perak that was thought to be responsible for the initial spread of the outbreak. 30 Ozawa et al. also discussed difficulties encountered by the trace back system in abattoir surveillance, pointing to irregularities with the tattooing system. 40 Farm codes were tattooed on the back of the animals stamped by the butchers themselves. Ear notching was later introduced to circumvent fraud.\n\nIn summary, there was no evidence of a surveillance system in place to provide early warning of the outbreak. The only surveillance activities described were initiated in response to the outbreak to guide control measures in Malaysia, and as an active case finding exercise in Indonesia. All evidence on control interventions is based on the outbreak response in Malaysia, which included mass culling, quarantining, and movement restrictions. There is no information on the cost of the interventions. The sustainability and feasibility of using these interventions outside of an outbreak situation is likely to be low, and there is no evidence for more sustainable ongoing activities such as animal tracking systems or health promotion campaigns. Despite many reports of ongoing surveillance activities there has been no evaluation of these systems.\n\nThe original searches retrieved 1302 potentially relevant articles. This included 15 systematic reviews which were identified during this stage and the reference lists for these were examined for additional references. From this list, 118 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination. 87 articles were rejected after perusal of the abstract and full text. Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and include papers based on: cross-sectional surveys or reports of surveillance activity with no intervention, narrative reviews with no original data and model-based studies. Thirty-five papers were critically appraised for methodological quality and based on these, 31 papers were included in the review ( Figure 2 ). The studies were categorised by country, urban/rural setting and type of intervention to facilitate analysis. Characteristics of the included studies are detailed in Appendix IV (Table 17 to Table 20) .\n\nSix studies evaluated the effectiveness of community-based surveillance programs for dengue. These studies came from different countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Malaysia). 28, 31, 32, 38, 39, 41 Two studies evaluated established national level systems, 28, 32 whilst the remaining four were evaluations of novel or improved systems undertaken at a more local/regional level. 31, 38, 39, 41 Twenty-six studies report on 28 evaluations of dengue prevention and control activities. Much of the evidence for community based dengue interventions comes from studies undertaken in Thailand 47, 49, 58, 64-66, 71, 72, 74, 76, 79 (n=11) and Viet Nam 38, 52, 53, [55] [56] [57] 61, 62 (n=8) . Within these countries, studies have been undertaken in a wide range of regions so evidence is available from northern, central and southern provinces. The remaining studies were undertaken in Singapore 44 (n=1), Malaysia 48 (n=1), Myanmar 76 (n=1), Cambodia 69 (n=1), the Philippines 59, 76 (n=2) and Indonesia 45, 70, 77 (n=3) .\n\nThree studies evaluated community dengue health education and disease awareness campaigns. 45, 64, 74 A further thirteen studies 44, 47, 49, 55-57, 61, 62, 66, 69-72 used educational components in conjunction with a combination of environmental, biological and occasionally chemical vector control. Five studies 48, 52, 70, 71, 77 evaluated environmental control strategies (including use of screens, covering of water containers, and community clean up to reduce larval breeding sites), the majority included an educational component. A further eleven studies 44, 49, 55-59, 61, 62, 66, 72 included environmental control activities alongside chemical or biological control interventions. Seven studies 55-58, 61, 62, 65 looked at biological vector control strategies (including introduction of either copepods or other biological control agents to water containers); in all studies this was in combination with dengue education and environmental control activities. Eleven studies 38, 44, 47, 49, 53, 59, 66, 69, 72, 76, 79 looked at chemical vector control strategies (including larvicide/insecticide distribution and fogging), either in isolation or occasionally combined with either dengue education or environmental control activities.\n\nTo summarise the general level of evidence for each type of intervention:\n\n\uf0b7 Surveillance -medium quality (generally appropriate study design (cross sectional studies) and analysis but do not control for confounding factors such as epidemic pattern of disease, changes in population structure , changes in patterns of urbanisation and concurrent disease control initiatives)\n\n\uf0b7 Environmental control -medium quality (small sample size, insufficient follow up periods, inappropriate or no control groups, do not control for confounding factors such as seasonality and epidemic pattern of disease, focus on vector rather than disease outcomes)\n\n\uf0b7 Biological control -high quality (adequate sample size, control for seasonality, appropriate control groups, full description of intervention , full description of baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups, report vector and disease outcomes)\n\n\uf0b7 Chemical control-medium quality for national studies (sample size and follow up periods adequate, do not control for confounding factors such as seasonality), low quality for local level studies (small sample size, no or inappropriate control groups, report vector and disease outcomes)\n\n\uf0b7 Educational interventionslow quality (small sample size, insufficient follow up periods, inappropriate or no control groups, do not control for confounding factors including seasonality and concurrent disease surveillance and control activities, focus on process outcomes)\n\nA major limitation of the body of evidence evaluating prevention and control activities is the reliance on entomological indices to evaluate program effectiveness, as the correlation of these indicators with clinical indicators is relatively weak. 84 Of these studies, eighteen 47, 49, 52, 56-59, 61, 62, 64-66, 70-72, 74, 76, 77 use larval indices as a main outcome measure, and ten 47, 48, 53, 55, 57, 58, 61, 62, 65, 77 report adult mosquito indices as a primary outcome. Fourteen studies 38, 44, 49, 55-57, 61, 64, 66, 69, 71, 72 used numbers of dengue cases or dengue incidence as an outcome. Two studies 53, 58 reported that clinical indicators of dengue could not be used as no cases of dengue were reported from either the intervention or control site but were able to report outcomes in terms of number of positive dengue serology results. Five studies 45, 56, 57, 61, 74 reported data on knowledge, attitude and practice indicators, five 53, 56, 71, 76, 79 presented data on the uptake or acceptability of the intervention and four 57, 69, 76, 79 presented measures of cost or sustainability of the program.\n\nSeven studies had a follow up of 6 months or less, 44, 49, 59, 64, 70, 76, 77 four of less than one year, 38, 48, 53, 65 and eight had a follow up of less than two years 45, 47, 52, 58, 71, 72, 74, 79 . These studies are unable to\n\nSix studies looked at different aspects of the functioning of dengue surveillance activities. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 18 and Table 19 . One study evaluated a passive surveillance system in terms of its ongoing functioning for monitoring endemic dengue, 31 three studies looked at active surveillance of suspected dengue cases, 38, 39, 41 whilst the other two evaluated the ability of surveillance data to predict or provide early warning of outbreaks or epidemics of dengue which occur periodically in endemic areas. 28, 32 Outcomes used in these studies include the number of dengue cases and/or incidence rates, predictive ability of the system (generally in terms of outbreak or epidemic warning), and sensitivity and specificity of the system. One study 41 reported data on the cost of the surveillance system.\n\nThe evaluation by Chairulfatah et al. was of the local surveillance system in Bandung, Indonesia. 31 The authors reported significant underreporting of hospital cases to the local Municipal Health office (only 31% reported). Poor record keeping impacted on assessment of the system's timeliness. No other qualities of the system were evaluated (representativeness, positive predictive value). The studies on active surveillance systems evaluated systems based on community reporting 38, 39 and a sentinel GP surveillance pilot to detect suspected dengue cases. 41 The study by Osaka et al. 38 was inconclusive, as it seemed to be set up to look at the impact of concurrent interventions (done in conjunction with active surveillance) rather than improved surveillance, as both the intervention and control group received the active surveillance component. No information was provided on the increased cost of active surveillance. Oum et al. 39 used syndromic surveillance definitions to conduct community-based surveillance on a number of diseases, including \u2017haemorrhagic fever' (HF). Their evaluation showed value in their approach, as only 33% of cases of HF had contacted a health facility, with 67% of them being treated at home, although they do not estimate a predictive value positive (PPV) for their definition of HF. The majority of deaths (80%) also occurred at home. The surveillance system also detected two clusters of HF reported in one commune. Other system attributes were not evaluated. The sentinel GP pilot 41 compared a sensitive versus more specific case definition of suspected dengue cases presenting to two clinics. The more specific case definition uses diagnostic criteria for DHF outlined by the WHO, so it is not surprising that a higher proportion of patients were positive by serology (33% vs 7%) and virus isolation (50% vs 15%) using the latter case definition. Barbazan et al. used retrospective surveillance data to show that the spatial analysis would allow focusing control activities on 5% of the months to control 37% of cases, and early warning of epidemics could have been done in advance. 28 Chan et al. used web search query data to build a model that estimated \u2017true dengue activity'. 32 They showed good correlation of their predictive model with retrospective data using datasets from Indonesia and Singapore.\n\n26 studies report on 28 evaluations of dengue control activities. Interventions evaluated were based on a variety of methods including environmental, biological and chemical vector control, as well as dengue disease awareness campaigns and health education activities. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 18 and Table 19 .\n\nThree studies evaluated purely dengue education programs which did not include any other control activities. 45, 64, 74 Two of these studies, undertaken with textile factory workers in Indonesia 45 and a rural community in Thailand, 64 focused on evaluating measures of community engagement with the program as opposed to changes in vector indices or disease outcomes. Both showed an increase in knowledge amongst participants about dengue symptoms and transmission, and awareness about how to reduce vector breeding habitats. Therawiwat et al. 74 (also undertaken in a rural Thai community) measured both knowledge and larval indicators. They showed significant increases in knowledge and self efficacy in control of dengue, along with a 90% reduction in larval indices by the end of the study. No data are presented by any of the studies on whether effects translated into any impact on the number of cases of dengue.\n\nFour studies evaluated environmental control strategies. One study looked at the provision of new water tanks with solid covers; 52 this study showed a reduction in larval indices (average number of larvae per container) in the new tanks, but no impact on larval indices in old existing containers at the study site. Overall there was not a significant reduction in larval indices. The new tanks showed high levels of acceptability amongst the community. The other three studies looked at the effectiveness of environmental cleanup campaigns in combination with dengue education and awareness activities. 48, 70, 71 Crabtree et al. used a strategy based in schools and the general community with use of mass media and targeted activities to promote community awareness. 48 They found a 60% reduction in the number of households in the intervention area positive for Aedes aegypti, however, the vector was not present in the control area at baseline, which effectively meant that there was no control group. The number of households positive for Aedes aegypti increased toward the end of the study period. Suroso et al. used a predominantly school based strategy to promote clean up amongst the wider community. 70 They found a 50% reduction in larval indices in households, but only a 35% reduction in households with school children and school buildings. They concluded the program had been less successful amongst school children. Suwanbamrung et al. conducted their study in three semi-urban communities and used targeted community education activities to promote clean up campaigns. 71 They showed a 50% reduction in household index and an 80% reduction in container index in the village with high levels of community engagement and dengue control capacity. In the two villages where capacity and engagement were lower they demonstrated only a 15% reduction in these larval indices. None of these studies reported data on the cost of the intervention or provided follow up beyond one year to look at sustainability.\n\nSeven studies evaluated a dengue control program that included use of biological control agents. One study 65 is a pilot study of the use of Larvitab \u00a9 (larvicidal bacteria) in a rural location in Thailand and includes no educational or environmental activities. The study reported a 70-85% reduction in larval indices and a 75% reduction in adult mosquito indices (as compared to only a 10% and 35% reduction respectively in the control group). The other six studies evaluated the use the copepod Mesocyclops as a biological control agent in water containers and also included health education and disease awareness, and environmental cleanup activities as part of the control program. One of these was a study undertaken in urban Thailand 58 that found that the percent of containers positive for larvae went from around 38% to close to 0%, mosquito landing numbers went from around 1 to close to 0, and the percentage of children screened who were dengue sero positive went from 13.5% to 0%.\n\nIn contrast the percentage of positive containers and children increased in the control area.\n\nThe other five studies evaluating copepods came from Viet Nam and were conducted by the same research group over a period of 15 years in a variety of rural and urban settings across North and Central Viet Nam. This group includes four original trials conducted in different communes 55, 56, 61, 62 and a follow up study looking at the cost and sustainability of the interventions up to nine years postintervention. 57 The intervention was very comprehensive including use of copepods, environmental cleanup campaigns, the use of microcredit schemes to encourage development of recycling business, and broad community education activities and awareness campaigns. In all four original studies the intervention achieved a reduction in vector indices, reducing larval populations by over 97% 12 months post introduction of copepods and achieving 99% reduction or elimination with the addition of community education and environmental cleanup activities. The studies also reported a reduction in dengue incidence and this was also maintained with no project communes reporting local cases of \n\nEleven studies evaluated some form of chemical control (including insecticides, larvicides, fogging or spraying programs, or use of impregnated nets or curtains). Five of the studies which evaluated chemical methods of control also had an environmental cleanup component to the intervention to reduce vector breeding habitats. 47, 49, 59, 66, 76 There was no systematic difference in effectiveness between these studies and those not including this component. Three studies looked at the use of impregnated nets or curtains. 53, 59, 79 The two studies evaluating nets showed a significant reduction in adult vector indices 53 and larval vector indices 59 but were not able to show a reduction in dengue infections as measured by dengue serology. 53 Tun-Lin et al. 76 looked at the use of vector control programs targeted at the most productive container types versus untargeted control programs in urban settings in Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines (note that data from Viet Nam was excluded from the review as there was no follow up at this site). In the Philippines, two forms of environmental control were compared. Tyre splitting, water drum cleaning and waste management was compared to a general community clean up and awareness campaign. In Myanmar, introduction of biological agents (dragon-fly nymphs and fish) to the most productive water containers was compared to a blanket approach where all containers were targeted and chemical control (Temephos \u00a9 ) was used intermittently. In Thailand introduction of a biological larvicide (Bti) to the most productive containers was compared to use of chemical control (Temephos \u00a9 ) in productive containers, plus regular emptying of all other containers and occasional insecticide spraying. In all three countries both the targeted approach and the non-targeted approach were equally effective at reducing entomological indices (Breteau index) by 80% in Myanmar and the Philippines and 50% in Thailand. Implementation costs were reported for Myanmar and the Philippines. In Myanmar, the targeted vector control program had lower implementation costs ($4.47 per year per household covered) than the non-targeted campaign to which it was compared ($6.45 per year per household). In the Philippines, the targeted intervention had higher implementation costs compared to the non-targeted campaign ($9.32 v. $2.19 per year per household). In the Philippines high levels of acceptance of the interventions were reported. Coverage of 70% and 73.5% was achieved in the Philippines and Myanmar respectively.\n\nGiven the larger number of studies identified that evaluated dengue surveillance or control activities, contextual information extracted from each study were grouped under the following headings for discussion: contextual factors, behavioural mechanisms, and program design. Within each of these broad headings, subcategories have been used to draw conclusions across studies. Details of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table 20 .\n\nThere were geographical differences in the types of prevention and control interventions evaluated and the location of study sites. Sixteen of the 26 studies included study sites in rural locations. These studies came from Viet Nam 52, 53, [55] [56] [57] 61, 62 , Thailand 47, 49, 58, [64] [65] [66] 74 Four interventions were evaluated in both urban and rural settings; these were impregnated bed nets (a chemical intervention), larviciding (a chemical intervention) introduction of Mesocyclops to water containers (a biological intervention) and community cleanup campaigns (an environmental intervention). Similar levels of effectiveness for all of these interventions were achieved in both settings except larviciding which appeared to be more effective in rural area at reducing both vector indices and dengue rates. Phantumacinda undertook their study in both urban and rural areas of The six studies 55-58, 61, 62 which included the use of copepods in their intervention commented that use of this method of control is applicable where the major breeding habitats for the vector are large water storage containers (which cannot be easily emptied and cleaned), that are used as stores from which smaller containers are refilled (thereby transferring copepods).\n\nNone of the included studies refer to specific models of behavioural change being used to design the intervention programs, however all of the studies make reference to the fact that the programs were designed to result in changes in practices to prevent dengue infection and transmission.\n\nBeckett et al. evaluated an education program and showed that improvement in knowledge scores was strongly correlated with educational level. 45 Therawiwat et al. found that education level and being male were predictive of high knowledge scores. 74 Kay et al. 57 showed a direct link between the frequency of household visits by dengue program volunteers, household knowledge of dengue prevention and the practice of dengue control activities. They also found that use of copepods as a biological method of dengue control was less successful when not combined with health education and awareness building activities. Kittayapong \n\nThe three studies authored by report that health volunteers in their interventions were paid a stipend of $US 2-4 per month (approximately 4 days of work) plus given a uniform. In the follow up study 57 they report that these stipends were not motivation for the volunteers. This in fact stemmed from the prestige of the position which derived from the value assigned to these roles by the community based on the severity of dengue as a public health problem. In contrast, the village health volunteers in the surveillance system evaluated by Oum et al. were reported to be motivated because they were financially rewarded. 39 Chairulfatah et al. states that the doctors in their surveillance system often wished to postpone reporting until a diagnosis of dengue was confirmed and health municipality officials were often asked to report only patients with obvious dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue septic shock. 31\n\nBoth Butraporn et al. 47 and Vanlerberghe et al. 79 reported a link between perceived effectiveness of the intervention amongst community members and continued engagement in program activities, with a decline in the use of Temephos \u00a9 plus waste management and the use of impregnated curtains over the study period as participants failed to see reductions in mosquito and dengue rates.\n\nIn many studies, key community members were identified as leaders or champions for the program and these individuals were involved in developing the intervention and mobilising activities in the wider community. Kay et al. 57 compared vector indices and dengue rates in project communes to those in communes which received a rollout of the intervention but which didn't offer communities the opportunity for local input and modification to the program prior to implementation. They report JBI Database of Systematic Reviews & Implementation Reports JBL000603 2013; 11(2) continued absence of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and reduced rates of dengue in the original project communes whilst the non-project communes had higher rates of both outcomes.\n\nIn the chemical control programs, community involvement in the intervention was generally passive,\n\ni.e. they received the program. The interventions were designed, coordinated and run by centralised agencies or teams. Community members' involvement was usually restricted to uptake of household strategies such as use of impregnated nets or larvicides, or allowing access to the household for spraying activities. In contrast, community involvement was active in the education, environmental and biological control programs. Community members were involved in the design and planning of environmental cleanup strategies, involved in development and delivery of the health education and disease awareness components of the program and trained and used for the distribution of biological agents and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the programs.\n\nHigh levels of community ownership and involvement are consistently reported as an important factor in the success of these control programs; Crabtree et al. state that the grass roots community action promoted success of their environmental cleanup program 48 and Suwanbamrung et al. 71 reported that their community education and environmental cleanup campaign resulted in a significant reduction in vector indices in all three villages. However, the village with the highest community capacity for dengue control amongst leaders and the general community recorded the lowest entomological and epidemiological indicators. Nam et al.\n\n, Nam et al. 61 , and Kay et al. 55 , all report that community leaders mobilised the whole community to take high levels of ownership of the program, which enabled a multi-level community approach to control. Nam 61 report that continuous community input is required into their intervention based around use of copepods and environmental clean up to prevent reinfestation with the dengue vector. Vanlerberghe found that active engagement of the community in promoting continued use of impregnated curtains was more important in increasing uptake than continued educational messages about dengue. 79 Crabtree et al. report spin-off benefits to the community from participating in their intervention. 48 These were increased civic pride, well-being, and more effective networking and self-advocacy with government agencies as a result of their environmental and education based program. which included the use of copepods in their intervention stated that all control tools were locally produced including the copepods which can be farmed locally for minimal cost.\n\nThe cost to participants of the intervention may facilitate or inhibit success of the program. Hien et al. studied the use of new containers with solid lids that were provided free to the community. 52 Whilst larval indices in these containers were low, the community continued to use many old containers and there was no overall reduction in larval indices. report their interventions included microcredit schemes for small businesses that were based around recycling and waste removal. These acted as catalysts for sustained environmental cleanup and some of the profits from these activities are reinvested into other dengue control activities.\n\nNone of the studies evaluating educational, environmental or biological control programs reported issues with acceptability of the program in community participants. Several studies specifically reported high levels of acceptability by the community. 48, 55, 71 The use of copepods in water containers was also well accepted and reported as requiring minimal time and effort to sustain. 57 \n\nWe included a number of outcome measures including household index, container index, Breteau index, the larval population number, larval density index, the mosquito biting rate and the number of cases of dengue infection. Definitions for each of these outcome measures are given in the methods section and further description of the meta analysis can be found in Appendix VII. The first five outcome measures measure Aedes aegypti larval populations in a number of settings (for example, in houses, in containers, as a total population number), the sixth measures the presence of adult mosquitoes, and the final is a measure of clinical infection with dengue virus. The studies varied in size from 61 to 6341 households and 1163 to 2.9 million people (represented by the size of the square in the forest plot), and covered a range of interventions, including environmental, educational, biological and chemical interventions, as well as a combination of more than one intervention.\n\nTen studies measured household index as an outcome measure. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the household index giving a summary mean odds ratio of 0.21 (95% credible interval 0.05, 0.68) ( \n\nSix studies measured container index as an outcome measure. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the container index, giving a summary mean odds ratio of 0.38 (95% credible interval 0.15, 0.94) ( Table 22 ). The forest plot shows heterogeneity between the individual study findings, with Madarieta et al. reporting the intervention had no impact on container index (odds ratio=1) ( Figure 3 ). However, the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. \n\nTwelve studies measured Breteau index as an outcome measure. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the Breteau index giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.40 (95% credible interval 0.26, 0.61) ( Table 23 ). The forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 3 ), and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. \n\nOnly two studies measured the larval population number. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the larval population numbers giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.21 (95% credible interval 0, 156.9) ( Table 24 ). The small number of studies is the reason for the wide credible interval. The forest plot shows homogeneity between the individual study findings ( Figure 6 ). As there were only two studies, a leave one out sensitivity analysis was not performed. \n\nThree studies measured the larval density index. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the larval density index giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.09 (95% credible interval 0, 11.51) ( Table 25 ). The small number of studies is the reason for the wide credible interval. The forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 7) , and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. \n\nTwo studies measured the presence of adult mosquitoes by recording the mosquito bite rate. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the mosquito bite rate giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.68 (95% credible interval 0, 634.83) ( Table 26 ). The small number of studies may be the reason for the wide credible interval, as the forest plot shows homogeneity between studies ( Figure 8 ). As there were only two studies a leave one out sensitivity analysis was not performed. \n\nSeven studies measured the rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the infection rate giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.22 (95% credible interval 0.02, 1.32) ( Table 27 ). The forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 9 ), and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each study. \n\nThe results of the meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant impact on larval indices; including approximately an 80% reduction in the proportion of positive households, approximately a 60% reduction in the proportion of containers positive for Aedes aegypti larvae and approximately a 60% reduction in the Breteau index, when results are pooled across type of intervention. Although we anticipated being able to draw indirect comparisons of effectiveness between intervention types, the small number of studies for any one intervention type precluded formal sub-analyses to look at relative effectiveness. However, a narrative interpretation of the forest plots shows no trend in levels of effectiveness by type of intervention, country, urban versus rural context or study size.\n\nTwo studies 48, 59 showed inconsistent results (an increase in larval indices as opposed to a decrease), but this difference does not appear related to the type of intervention. The study by Crabtree et al. 48 trialled an environmental cleanup intervention; it is a low quality study that is weakened by its inappropriate choice of control area (the mosquito vector was not present in the control area at baseline). The study by Madarieta et al. 59 was a small, short, low quality trial of insecticide impregnated bednets. A feature common to both studies that may partially explain their contradictory findings is that each reported problems with the sustainability of the intervention. After 6 months, 52%\n\nof nets were no longer in use and 60% of nets in use had been washed (reducing their insecticidal properties). At the end of the environmental cleanup study, the authors report ongoing waste management issues, and a failure to alter ingrained attitudes that the government should address these issues, rather than seeing them as a community responsibility.\n\nPooling of results across intervention types estimates that vector control results in approximately an 80% reduction in the rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever, however this result does not achieve statistical significance. Effectiveness does not appear to vary by country or urban/rural context. There is the suggestion of a slight trend to greater levels of effectiveness for interventions incorporating biological vector control methods 56, 58, 61 versus chemical vector control methods 38, 66, 69, 72 , but this is not statistically significant. Only three studies 56, 66, 72 included in the meta-analysis reported data on both larval and dengue outcomes. All showed consistency in the direction of the effect across outcomes, however all showed a bigger reduction in larval indices than number of dengue infections. This provides support for use of larval indicators as an intermediate outcome in evaluations of dengue control interventions, but suggests that they cannot be used to directly estimate the impact of the intervention on disease outcomes.\n\nA substantial body of evidence is available evaluating the effectiveness of dengue control interventions and surveillance activities. The available evidence comes from countries across SE Asia providing confirmation these programs work in a diverse range of geographical and social contexts. A wide range of vector control interventions have been evaluated, including chemical, biological and environmental methods of control. These have been evaluated both in isolation and in conjunction with health education and disease awareness campaigns. The majority of this evidence relies on entomological indices to evaluate programs (as opposed to disease outcomes). Duration of follow-up varied from one month 49 to five years.\n\nA review of included studies evaluating surveillance interventions show that well-functioning surveillance systems can be successfully used to spatially and temporally predict dengue epidemics in Thailand. This result has not been replicated in other countries. Community based surveillance methods appear to offer improvements over hospital/clinical surveillance in terms of sensitivity of the system, particularly in settings where there are significant financial barriers to accessing healthcare that results in under-reporting of dengue case numbers.\n\nThe dengue vector is amenable to many forms of chemical, biological and environmental control. The meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant 80% reduction in the proportion of positive households and a 60% reduction in the proportion of containers positive for Aedes aegypti larvae, regardless of the type of intervention.\n\nThere was also a non-significant 80% reduction in the rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever.\n\nInterventions based on health education, environmental and biological vector control appear to be effective, low cost, well accepted, and sustainable in both urban and rural settings. Interventions based on chemical control in urban settings appear to be well accepted and there is evidence for effectiveness but they are expensive and there is limited evidence on their sustainability. A single study comparing environmental clean-up with repeat fogging found that environmental cleanup was more effective at reducing mosquito numbers than the chemical control program. A study reporting on evaluations in a range of countries showed that targeted environmental and larviciding interventions are as effective at reducing vector indices as blanket interventions and have lower implementation costs. Sub-group meta-analyses by intervention type or rural and urban settings were not possible because of the small number of eligible studies.\n\nhigh levels of community ownership of the program, and sufficient investment and resourcing for both start up and maintenance. There have been few evaluations comparing types of control and the costeffectiveness of these programs has not been evaluated.\n\nThe search strategy identified 854 potentially relevant titles, of which 110 were shortlisted (Figure 2 ), based on details in the title and abstract. 96 original references were excluded (reasons are given) in Appendix V and papers which were outbreak reports with no data included on interventions, narrative reviews with no original data, cross-sectional KAP surveys and model-based studies. Nine systematic reviews that were identified were also excluded, as these focused on either a geographical region outside of the scope of this review(either China, Hong Kong and/or North America) , the use of pharmaceutical or clinical interventions (vaccines and lab assays for clinical diagnosis), or the prevention of nosocomial (as opposed to community) transmission. Full text of twenty studies was retrieved, of which five studies were critically appraised and subsequently included in the review (Table ) . Four of the five were from Singapore 34, 51, 63, 73 with the remaining study originating from Viet Nam 75 .\n\nAll five studies were of low quality and did not control for confounding in their assessment of the effectiveness of the interventions studied. The study evaluating workplace-based surveillance for febrile disease was conducted over too short a timeframe to capture seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of this illness and no data is given on the sensitivity and time-sensitivity of the system. 34 The results from the study are also unlikely to be generalisable to a wide range of workplaces as the study was conducted in a tertiary hospital setting where there were well-established reporting hierarchies and electronic documentation of staff sick leave.\n\nThe evidence for prevention and control interventions is derived from descriptive studies based on outbreak data from the 2003 global outbreak. 51, 63, 73, 75 Given the high profile of this outbreak and the laboratory resources available in Singapore and Viet Nam, the datasets used are likely to be comprehensive and capture all symptomatic infections, giving an accurate picture of the epidemic and any impact of prevention and control interventions. However, this type of data also presents major limitations. Firstly, it reduces the ability to determine the impact of these individual interventions from amongst the range of community-based and government strategies that were implemented at that time. Secondly, it is unclear whether any impact is generalisable to future outbreaks, as the studies are unable to control for features unique to the 2003 outbreak. These include epidemiological features of SARS (such as the fact individuals were symptomatic whilst infectious and the relatively low risk of transmission compared to an infectious organism such as measles). Thirdly, they are based on retrospective data and are unable to obtain data on confounders or contextual factors if these were not collected at the time.\n\nPage 41\n\nOf the papers included in this review, only a single study was identified that reported on ongoing surveillance systems for SARS. 34 Details of the intervention and the main findings from the study are presented in Table & Table . The study evaluates the practicality of post-SARS surveillance recommendations in Singapore. The study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness. Although the study is conducted in medical staff at a large general hospital, it is included here as it is being used as an early detection system for outbreaks rather than solely to prevent nosocomial transmission. The study finds that as documented fever is rare in sick leave amongst staff, passive surveillance in healthcare workers would be efficient in identifying outbreaks of febrile illness. Effective markers were found to be clustering of illness, prolonged or repeated absence from work, or the incidence of abnormally high fevers. The authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be chosen, but that currently the system is not specific. This may lead to many false alarms and ultimately to outbreak -fatigue\u2016 whereby people fail to respond to early warning signals. The authors also note that surveillance is time-consuming and resource intensive.\n\nTan et al. 73 provides descriptive information only about the use of temperature screening amongst school children during the epidemic. The study reports that none of the children diagnosed with SARS were detected through this system despite the extensive effort and resources this system required. They describe the benefit of this type of surveillance as psychological, with the purpose being to reassure parents and the public that schools were safe during the outbreak.\n\nFour studies reported on community-based interventions to prevent and control SARS. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table and   Table . Three of the studies are from Singapore 51, 63, 73 and evaluated the effectiveness of home isolation and quarantine protocols and its contact tracing policy. All of the studies were based on retrospective analyses of the same outbreak dataset. The three studies reach the conclusion that the system was effective as it was able to reduce the time from onset of SARS symptoms to isolation from nearly one week to just over a day. They showed that a wide-net approach (i.e. pre-emptive isolation of exposed individuals using a broad definition of exposure) to surveillance and isolation of suspected cases was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases as the outbreak progressed. They also saw a reduction in the number of secondary infections per case. Only 0.3% of those quarantined broke quarantine. One quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis. Only 0.5% of those isolated went on to develop SARS. It is noteworthy that these interventions were evaluated within an outbreak setting and that a range of other communityfocused strategies were also put into place.\n\nA single study from Viet Nam 75 is a risk factor analysis for SARS transmission in contacts of SARS cases in Viet Nam. The study looked at the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission of SARS from index cases to known contacts (in particular household members and carers). Unfortunately this was a small observational study based on retrospective data and 95% of SARS contacts reported never wearing a mask, so no conclusions could be drawn about their effectiveness.\n\nPage 42\n\nDetails of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table31. Escudero et al.'s study of a work-based surveillance system acknowledges that electronic documentation of staff medical certificates were important in enabling the system to function in a timely manner and at low cost. 34 The authors also highlight that the study coincided with admission of an isolated case of SARS contracted due to a laboratory accident, which may have both increased awareness of febrile illness amongst staff and improved participation and acceptance rates amongst staff members.\n\nAll four studies of prevention and control activities highlighted that there were particular epidemiological features of SARS that made it more amenable to controlnamely that patients were only infectious whilst symptomatic. 51, 63, 73, 75 This makes it easier to identify when and where interventions need to be put in place for infected individuals to prevent transmission. It may also increase uptake of interventions amongst non-infected individuals as people are better able to judge their risk of infection.\n\nThe three studies evaluating isolation and quarantine policies in Singapore all stated that strong government/political leadership and high levels of community support were important factors in successful implementation of quarantine measures. 51, 63, 73 Other factors identified by these studies as contributing to success in both implementing isolation and quarantine measures, and in halting the epidemic, were good and timely communication both between agencies and outward to the general public and substantial investment to develop information technology systems and laboratory systems capable of providing accurate and timely information over the course of the outbreak. Ooi et al. also highlights that Singapore has particular features (small population, high GDP, urban setting) that facilitate the ability to implement large-scale quarantine and states that -imposition of large-scale quarantine should be implemented only under specific situations in which it is legally and logistically feasible\u2016. 63 Ooi et al. gives useful information about the public and individual response to the isolation and quarantine policy, stating that stigmatisation of quarantined individuals was reported. 63 Those quarantined were generally agreeable to being confined at home whilst the response was less positive to potential confinement in an institution such as a health centre. Finally, the study indicates that substantial resources were directed toward quarantined individuals, including repeat visits by nurses to deliver health education, the installation of electronic surveillance systems in each household to monitor compliance to quarantine orders, and the use of financial incentives to compensate individuals for lost income. All of these factors are likely to have contributed to the low rate of non-compliance reported in the study.\n\nThe study by Tuan et al. 75 did not provide any contextual information about why people did not wear masks.\n\nFive studies were included in the review, one looking at a work-based surveillance system in a Singapore hospital, three evaluating the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine in Singapore as a response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, and one study from Viet Nam reporting on the effectiveness of masks in reducing risk of SARS in people exposed to SARS patients. Overall the evidence is low quality and based predominantly on analysis of case series data from the 2003 outbreak. All three studies that evaluated the impact of isolation and quarantine found this intervention to be effective,\n\nPage 43 however, the major limitation in these studies is that they are all based on analysis of the same routine dataset, and none can control for the impact of the multiple other interventions that were put in place in Singapore at the time of the outbreak. The study reporting on use of masks was an observational study and was unable to comment on whether the intervention was effective as 95% of participants reported never wearing a mask. Important factors contributing to the success of isolation and quarantine policies were good organisation, adequate resources, good communication and public support.\n\nUnlike Nipah virus infection, where, to date, the outbreak in 1999 has been an isolated event in SE Asian countries, several outbreaks of avian influenza have been recorded in a number of SE Asian countries from 2004 to 2008. In line with our inclusion criteria, outbreak control measures for each country-specific outbreak were included as long as they had a significant component of community involvement and engagement, even if in concert with -top-down\u2016 government-driven initiatives.\n\nThe search identified 737 potentially relevant titles, of which 107 papers were short-listed for comprehensive examination ( Figure 2 ). Of these, eleven studies were critically appraised and nine studies were subsequently included in the review (Table32). Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V, and include papers based on: outbreak reports with no data on interventions, narrative reviews with no original data, risk factor analyses, model-based studies and cross-sectional KAP and prevalence surveys.\n\nOf the nine included studies, five evaluated an existing or newly established surveillance system, 27, 33, 35, 42, 43 four studies evaluated prevention and control interventions in the form of education, 46, 60, 78, 80 which was combined, in one study, with behaviour modelling. 80 The surveillance program conducted in Indonesia also incorporated a prevention and control component.\n\nWith the exception of the evaluation carried out by Perry et al. 42 all studies were of poor quality, with the most common limitation in most studies being inadequate evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the intervention, or if the assessment was carried out, the authors failed to present the results of the evaluation. In the study by Bhandari et al., 100 farmers participated in an educational intervention about proper biosecurity measures for the prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). 46 However, no information is provided about the knowledge of the participants on this subject matter prior to the intervention, and it is difficult to attribute the results to the intervention.\n\nThe study by Desvaux et al. conducted poultry market monitoring, surveillance of broilers and hens and surveillance of sentinel villages for the presence of HPAI. 33 The authors admit several constraints identified during the implementation of the program impacted on the quality of the study: insufficient training of field staff (collecting the wrong swabs), biased selection of market places and small sample sizes resulting in the study not being representative. Evaluation of the performance of the system was also needed.\n\nThe study by Manabe et al. looked at how educational interventions in an intervention and control village influenced awareness relating to H5N1 and the accessibility of healthcare. 60 There were some differences in the intervention and control groups (the control group reported a higher proportion of farmers) and also differences in participants pre-and post-intervention in the intervention commune (greater proportion of participants reported a higher economic level post-intervention). The educational intervention was evaluated by a qualitative survey using face-to-face interviews with a relatively small sample of only 16 participants from the intervention commune.\n\nIn an educational intervention in Cambodia, the study by Van Kerkhove et al. looked at training programs for village animal health workers following domestic poultry outbreaks in the area. 78 The study evaluated changes in poultry handling behaviours before and after educational campaigns. The study had some limitations. There were differences in sampling methods in the 2006 survey (preintervention) compared to the 2007 survey (post-intervention). There were also some demographic differences between the two study populations, and poultry handling behaviours were self-reported, not observed independently.\n\nEducational initiatives were also run in three countries in the Mekong region (Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR). 80 KAP surveys were conducted pre-and post-intervention. Unfortunately, other than one pre-and post-intervention score on the effectiveness of the intervention in Viet Nam, no other assessment was carried out (or presented) for the Cambodian and Laotian studies, so there is no data presented on disease outcomes.\n\nThe study by Samaan et al. evaluated a rumour surveillance system based on information from internet news and public health mailing lists and chat rooms. 43 The study covered all countries covered by the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO), which includes several countries outside the scope of this review; however, the findings were heterogeneous across country settings. 42 The study is limited by changes in the form of data collection used during the period of evaluation, but aside from this the evaluation is wide-ranging and includes an assessment of the role of all stakeholders involved in the surveillance and prevention components of the program, the quality, clarity and adequacy of the program design, the quality of the data, program outputs and sustainability of the program. (16, 973) apparently free of infection. The authors comment that the surveillance system enhanced existing passive surveillance systems and addressed a gap in surveillance.\n\nThe study by Desvaux et al. focused on targeted surveillance of markets, semi-commercial poultry farms located in former outbreak areas, sentinel village monitoring to strengthen surveillance at village level, and serological surveillance of domestic duck farms. 33 The study did not detect HPAI in the market (0/712) or farm (0/51) samples. Market monitoring: samples were collected in seven provinces. Interviews were conducted in 52 villages and on 23 farms, which were subsequently classified according to their risk of having faced an HPAI outbreak. 14/70 (20%) premises were not suspected, 3/70 (4%) were classified as low probability, 18/70 (26%) were classified moderate probability, 35/70 (50%) high probability. The authors identified several constraints during the implementation of program that impacted on the success of the studylack of motivation of provincial staff, limited capacity of the central team to compile and analyse the data generated, weak diagnostic capabilities and the reluctance of farmers to have animals sampled. They also state that selection of animals in market places was biased and that sample sizes were below defined levels and hence not representative, which may explain the zero detection rate of HPAI in markets and on commercial farms.\n\nThe study by Samaan et al. used rumour surveillance to analyse rumours generated primarily by the media and email and evaluate if the rumours could offer timely assistance to potentially affected nations, prompt countries to undertake preparedness measures, and inform public and international community about relevant events. 43 Rumours were followed up by email or telephone request to the relevant WHO country office to investigate their veracity. A total of 40 rumours were identified from 20 countries and one Special Administrative Region. 23% of the rumours were confirmed to be true. The authors conclude that this type of surveillance was successful in informing public health action, and was relatively inexpensive to conduct.\n\nFive studies evaluated education based avian influenza prevention and control interventions. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table33 and Table34. Four studies were identified where education and training were the main component of the prevention and control interventions, all of them were conducted in the Mekong region, which comprises Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR. The programs were aimed at communities in rural settings, focusing on increasing awareness of HPAI, 46, 60 motivating people to access healthcare earlier 60 and encouraging a change in hygiene and poultry handling behavior. 78, 80\n\nThe study by Bhandari et al. conducted training to 100 farmers who then served as demonstrators for a model of proper biosecurity measures for the prevention and control of HPAI. 46 The authors report that no outbreaks have been reported in the communities in the project areas since the intervention.\n\nThe program was evaluated in more depth using the funder's own model, the Participatory Self-Review and Planning Toolkit, but the authors do not give details of the tool kit or the evaluation process.\n\nThe studies by Manabe et al. 60 and Van Kerkhove et al. 78 are both before and after intervention studies in comparable cohorts, the former in two agricultural communities in Viet Nam, the latter in two southern provinces in Cambodia. Baseline and post-intervention KAP scores were calculated by Manabe; they also reported differences in the frequency of health and hygiene behaviours between the intervention and control groups. 60 The authors state a greater proportion of participants reported receiving information from a health care worker or a friend after the intervention, and more people were likely to seek early access to healthcare after the intervention. Habits such as touching and eating dead or sick poultry were reported both pre-and post-intervention. Van Kerkhove et al. also describes increased reporting to village chiefs, but not to the animal health officer. 78 Awareness of HPAI was high, but understanding of transmission was still low. While there were some improvements to basic hygiene practices and reduction in risky poultry handling behaviours, some risky behaviours still persisted (allowing children to play with poultry, proper treatment of poultry in the household environment).\n\nThe study by Waisbord et al. was a large undertaking, with training delivered to 3840 district and commune women's union officers in Viet Nam, 810 village promoters in Cambodia and 93 reporters and editors in Lao PDR. 80 The authors provide the number of people, districts, farmers, trained, as process measures. Only in the Viet Namese study do they report pre-and post-intervention KAP scores, reporting an increase from 54% to 92%. Nine percent of farmer households in Cambodia set up model farms after participating in the study, and in Lao PDR, AI coverage on TV and radio improved in both quality and quantity.\n\nThe HPAI program in Indonesia began as separate PDS and PDR (participatory disease response)\n\nteams, but was later rolled into combined surveillance and response officers. The surveillance component of the program was successful in detecting HPAI, and the PDSR education component also achieved good coverage (29,476 education meetings held with community leaders, 10,093, 6,804, 103,832 and 9,971 meetings held with groups of community members, other organizations, individual households and persons from commercial enterprises, respectively). 27, 35, 42\n\nDetails of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table35 Nevertheless, they also reported other benefits and strengths of the programs, such as better collaborative networks both at a local level as well as between agencies, sometimes enhancing existing national systems already in place. 42 The PDSR program in Indonesia had very positive impacts on revitalising veterinary services in Indonesia, and in particular in strengthening the local animal health services (Dinas), as well as empowering communities' access to public services. Manabe et al. acknowledged the importance of the involvement of local healthcare workers and administrators in H5N1 education and outreach, and that the main impact of the educational intervention was to increase people's trust in local health care providers. 60 Waisbord et al. commented that training brought commune council people together and provided the opportunity to network and cooperate more closely in the future. 80 However, it became apparent that the PDSR response alone was insufficient and unlikely to contain and eliminate the disease for a number of reasons: inability to offer compensation to encourage culling, inability by the officers to enforce movement control, inability of the farmers to buy cages and feed to restrain poultry. The program evaluators advocated the need for transition into more sustainable and responsive animal health services.\n\nEvidence for surveillance interventions of HPAI was identified in programs in Indonesia and Cambodia. The PDSR program in Indonesia has been very successful in training surveillance officers and detecting HPAI in backyard poultry. It has also added value to existing veterinary health services in Indonesia. Conversely, results from the surveillance interventions in Cambodia were equivocal because of several constraints that impacted on the success of the study. Prevention and control initiatives were identified in Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Indonesia. Several programs were not evaluated in terms of final outcomes (only process outcomes were used), or if evaluated, the results have not been published. Several studies identified risky poultry behaviour despite the educational intervention and efforts by disease control staff to contain and eliminate disease for a number of reasons. The need to transition to more sustainable, long -term animal health services was also discussed. Despite this, a benefit of these programs has been to strengthen local collaborative networks and bring people together.\n\nNone of the five studies included in this section of the review present any ongoing community-based human or animal surveillance interventions for rabies, and we did not find other evidence for community-based surveillance interventions. Both of the studies with successful rabies control programs required coordination and cooperation among government and provincial services. Kamoltham comments that rabies is reportable in Thailand, and this is also true of other countries in SE Asia. 86 It is possible that surveillance of rabies is not suited at a community level. With the advent of cheaper and safer human vaccines and the development of more economical regimes for human post-exposure treatment (PET), most Southeast Asian countries are able to administer PET through rabies treatment centres, hospitals and clinics similar to those discussed in the paper by Kamoltham, 54 and surveillance of human cases of rabies through these health provision settings would be a reasonable and feasible approach.\n\nIn recent years, the WHO has taken the initiative to develop a regional strategy for the elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs and advocate for rabies control programs in SEA. Rabies control activities in a number of SE Asian countries are now government-driven with the involvement of government officials, health workers and community members.\n\nThe majority of human rabies is transmitted by dogs through human-animal bite injuries. Models for rabies control programs summarised in this review were based on use of a number of control interventions, including vaccination of animals, restriction of movement of animals, removal of unrestricted animals (culling) and health education. However, the results of the studies included in this review would suggest that mass canine vaccination is the mainstay of successful canine rabies control programs. This has been shown to be the case in a number of other countries throughout the world 87 . Estrada showed oral baits to be an acceptable 82 and successful 50 method of vaccine delivery to vaccinate dogs that was easier to administer than injection. Studies conducted in other countries support this evidence, particularly in the stray and ownerless (common) dog population. 88\n\nThese interventions require high level support and coordination for their implementation. 54, 68, 81 Inability to implement these strategies properly contributed to failure to control the outbreak on Flores\n\nIsland. 81 Legislation to enforce these interventions is also an essential component of rabies control strategies but in recent years, the WHO has also developed and standardised innovative control tools and techniques that may help support future control programs. 89 The reduction in the number of deaths from rabies in the study by Kamoltham is noteworthy, and is likely a result of a combined effect of expansion of the PET regimen in humans as well as the dog vaccination campaign. 54 This reduction in the number of human deaths due to the increased uptake of the PET for rabies has also been documented in other Asian countries. 90 However, the number of rabies exposures are increasing in many countries, which may be explained by the finding that the use of effective dog control programs for dog rabies elimination has become rarer in developing countries. 91 \n\nNone of the studies evaluated the cost benefits and cost-effectiveness of rabies control interventions, particularly in comparison to the cost of patient expanded treatment (PET) regimen used in these countries. Canine vaccination has been shown to be a comparatively inexpensive and ethical way to control the disease in animals and prevent human exposure and illness in model-based studies, especially in resource-limited countries, 92 more so than the use of tissue-culture vaccines used in post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nA number of studies showed the importance of education and good information dissemination, as well as the form of campaign information, on the likelihood of owners to vaccinate their pets. This has been backed by other studies, 92, 93 who have shown that 70-75% of dogs are accessible to control measures, particularly vaccination, if the approach is adapted to the dog-man relationship and the community is fully involved in the rabies elimination program.\n\nHigher level support and the involvement of the authorities was also essential in the success (or failure) of both outbreak control measures and routine canine vaccination, because some form of law enforcement was required, particularly where no one claimed ownership such as the stray dog and common dog population. Lack of coordination between local authorities made it difficult to contain the infected dog population and prolonged the outbreak.\n\nThe Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia was initially thought to have been illness due to Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne illness, and early control efforts focussed on mosquito source reduction and administration of a JE vaccine. 29 An epidemiological trace-back study conducted by scientists from the CDC and the AAHL with the collaboration of local veterinarians later identified Nipah virus as the causative agent. The lack of an established early warning system that incorporated some form of ongoing monitoring of herd health hampered the prompt identification and control of the outbreak, and would certainly have impacted on the magnitude of the outbreak.\n\nSwine surveillance implemented during the outbreak and after the outbreak ceased was shown to be effective in detecting infected herds. None of the studies discussed the cost of the surveillance system, or the feasibility of an ongoing system. A sustainable, ongoing and structured monitoring system for Nipah virus as well as other animal diseases would reduce the impact of any further outbreaks of zoonotic disease. We found no evaluations of surveillance initiatives post the 1999 outbreak; nor any assessment of costs or other attributes such as the functionality of these systems.\n\nThe study by Ozawa et al. presented trace back systems in several Asian countries. 40 The study comments that trace back systems are not well developed and marking of animals for trace back is practised only in a limited number of countries in specific areas or zones and for specific purposes only. A comprehensive herd monitoring system would need to incorporate some form of identification system to be able to trace back and isolate an infected animal from a particular farm.\n\nAll control measures discussed in the studies were emergency measures used in response to the Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak. They included culling, movement restrictions, quarantine, PPE for farmers and all persons coming into contact with infected pigs (the military, healthcare staff), health education and practices of farm-gate biosecurity (disinfection, isolation). The sustainability and feasibility of using these interventions outside of an outbreak situation has not been discussed and it is unlikely that some of the more extreme interventions are appropriate for routine use.\n\nOur review found some evidence of proposed long-term sustainable prevention and control measures. New guidelines proposed by the Department of Veterinary Services, Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture, to restructure the industry in line with designated pig farming areas and -good animal husbandry concepts\u2016 were to be implemented in each State. 37 Muniandy et al. and Aziz et al. also\n\noutline recommendations for future reform in their paper, which were subsequently discussed at a regional seminar on Nipah virus infection held in Kuala Lumpur in 2001 and jointly organised by the OIE and the Department of Veterinary Services in Malaysia. 26 These include policies and protocols for sound farm management practices, which would incorporate farm-gate biosecurity (i.e. quarantine of new animals brought onto the farm, exclusion testing to establish disease status) and would require the engagement of the pig farming industry. Other preventative measures include outbreak preparedness plans for the management of future disease outbreaks and laboratory diagnostic capability. It is unclear how much progress there has been in this area as our review did not find any evidence to show the implementation of any of these measures.\n\nThe outbreak came at enormous political and social cost to Malaysia. The importance of Nipah virus as a newly emerging viral disease in the SE Asian region cannot be understated. While the disease was eradicated from pigs in Malaysia, its natural history suggests there is an on-going need for preparedness for the potential of further outbreaks of Nipah virus in the region. The challenge for\n\nMalaysia and other countries in the Asian and Oceanic regions will be to implement a herd monitoring system and control strategies that are acceptable and sustainable, and the need to develop their own preparedness plans.\n\nSome evidence was available evaluating surveillance activities for dengue, although we would agree with the recommendations from an earlier systematic review 94 that more prospective studies are required to determine the most appropriate dengue surveillance system capable of providing early warning of epidemics. Six studies looked at dengue surveillance at a number of levels, ranging from community level to reporting to the provincial health services. From the results presented in Oum et al., it appears that a considerable proportion of people with symptoms consistent with dengue haemorrhagic fever do not access healthcare and are treated at home. 39 Furthermore Chairulfatah et al. found significant underreporting to the local public health office of cases that do seek healthcare. 31\n\nThese results have implications for the estimation of the burden of disease of dengue fever as well as actioning of control activities in response to hyper endemic activity.\n\nThe study by Pang et al. shows the usefulness in incorporating GP sentinel surveillance utilising \u2017point of care' testing to assess suspected cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever in a timely fashion for those cases that do access healthcare. 41 However, this study was trialled with two GP clinics in an urban setting within the Kuala Lumpur area of Malaysia. It is unlikely that this approach will be applicable in a rural setting where people are less likely to go to a doctor, and confirmatory testing is costly and logistically challenging.\n\nThe two studies utilising surveillance data were useful in predicting outbreak activity and spatial clustering of outbreaks. 28, 32 However, the spatial analysis has not taken into account other factors accounting for spatial clustering of outbreaks. Such approaches are also only as good as the underlying data they use. In countries such as Singapore, with well-established surveillance in place and good government support for health services, surveillance information is likely to be robust. Other developing countries in need of surveillance improvements could not use this approach.\n\nThe majority of studies reported outcomes in terms of larval or mosquito indices rather than disease outcomes. There has not been much attempt to look at the correlation between dengue vector and disease indicators. Long term absence (or low rates) of the vector does appear to translate into reduced disease incidence, however, in the short-term vector and disease outcomes do not appear to be well correlated. 84 As such reliance on larval or vector indices as the primary outcome measures poses a limitation in terms of evaluating the impact of these strategies on dengue control and the burden of dengue illness in this region given that the majority of studies had follow up periods of less than two years. Short duration of follow-up also means results can be confounded by seasonal and epidemic trends in vector populations and dengue incidence.\n\nTwo studies reported the use of serology to measure rates of dengue of infection and showed that rates of dengue seropositivity were higher than rates of clinical dengue infection. This provides interesting evidence for a high incidence of subclinical infection and supports the idea that there is a silent reservoir of disease. This has large implications for the evaluation of both dengue surveillance and control activities, as evaluations based on clinical reporting will underestimate rates of dengue.\n\nThe dengue vector, Aedes aegypti responds to control via a variety of methods, and successful programs are fairly homogenous in the extent to which they are able to reduce larval indices over short time periods (less than two years). This finding concurs with the results of three earlier systematic reviews that have looked at the effectiveness of dengue vector control interventions on reducing entomological indicators. 15, 95, 96 Choice between methods of vector control for a given setting may rest on factors such as feasibility, cost and sustainability, as well as contextual factors such as cultural and community acceptance (see next section), factors which have been poorly explored in the included studies.\n\nChemical options for vector control appear to be better suited to epidemic or outbreak situations. The higher cost of chemical control relative to environmental and biological vector control, plus the need for repeat dosing makes them a less sustainable option for ongoing vector control, particularly in rural areas. However evidence from Cambodia showed that a program based on twice yearly larviciding and dengue awareness activities prevented an increase in dengue incidence over five years, indicating that their use may be more relevant in urban areas where water and waste removal infrastructure is better developed. Larviciding (targeting breeding sites) has been studied more than insecticiding (where adult mosquitoes are targeted), the latter has mainly been used in outbreak scenarios indicating it is unlikely to be an option for long-term control. Trials of insecticide treated curtains indicate that this intervention is unlikely to be sustainable for a number of reasons, including poor use and maintenance of the curtains.\n\nHigh quality studies conducted in Viet Nam showed that control interventions based around biological, environmental and education components can maintain their effectiveness in reducing entomological indices to the point of local elimination of the vector and in reducing cases of dengue infection over sustained periods of time (10 years). 57 Copepods (natural predators of mosquito larvae) were introduced into water containers to reduce larvae numbers. They can be locally produced, are low cost and have a higher level of acceptability as compared to Temephos \u00a9 . They have been shown to be effective in both rural and urban areas. However, their use seems best suited to contexts where water is sourced predominantly from large communal water containers, and these containers represent the major breeding habitat for the mosquito. Use of copepods has always been evaluated in conjunction with environmental and waste management activities. These activities have been a core component of most dengue control interventions that have been evaluated and are highly successful if high levels of community involvement can be achieved. They are appropriate for use in both urban and rural settings, and clean-up targeted at the most productive vector breeding sites is as effective as a blanket approach at lower cost.\n\nUnfortunately there are few direct comparisons of dengue control programs. A narrative interpretation of the forest plots generated in the meta-analysis suggests that there is relative homogeneity of effectiveness across types of vector control intervention, country, and urban v. rural context. Based on a single study 77 that compared environmental cleanup to a fogging intervention, the environmental cleanup intervention was more effective during the dry season at reducing larval and vector numbers, however the interventions were comparable during the wet season. This supports the suggestion that chemical interventions may be most suited to outbreak/epidemic situations 44, 49 . For ongoing control, targeted interventions (where specific containers, buildings or areas are identified to receive the intervention, rather than trying to achieve blanket coverage) appear to offer comparable levels of effectiveness but at a lower cost. 38, 76 Targeted strategies obviously rely on having good epidemiological data to ensure that the right sites are identified.\n\nThere are few studies that have tried to replicate findings from successful programs in other contexts, and few evaluations of interventions that have been rolled out as regional or national programs. This inhibits the ability to comment on the feasibility and sustainability or even likely effectiveness of interventions outside a pilot study or research context. An earlier systematic review of the functioning of vector control operations found a number of limitations to current programs including a lack of personnel, expertise and budgets, difficulties engaging communities and almost no monitoring and evaluation. 96 There is an urgent need for evidence on how findings for successful interventions can be better translated into effective practice.\n\nThe studies included in the review reported a range of contextual factors, behavioural mechanisms or intervention features that either improved or inhibited the effectiveness of the program. High levels of community engagement are necessary for dengue control interventions to be effective. Barriers to community engagement that are reported in the studies include the perception that dengue is not an important public health issue or that the proposed intervention is not effective. This highlights the\n\nPage 53\n\nimportance of education and communication about both dengue and the intervention prior to roll-out in the community. It was also shown that knowledge alone did not automatically translate into improved dengue control behaviours and centrally coordinated environmental cleanup or temephos distribution activities were required to reinforce use of control methods. A barrier specific to community involvement in environmental cleanup activities is a belief that these activities are a government responsibility. Conversely, establishment of these tasks as economic activities, through use of microcredit schemes for small recycling businesses, promoted engagement with this activity.\n\nRecycling is not a new concept in Viet Nam; it is not clear whether this strategy would be successful settings where rates of recycling are currently low.\n\nFactors that promote high levels of community engagement include the use of multiple methods of communication and education, repetition of education and awareness activities (rather than one-off sessions), use of existing community groups to promote and deliver intervention activities (in particular schools), and engagement of community members at all stages of the interventions;\n\nplanning, delivery and evaluation. High levels of community ownership and responsibility for ongoing control activities (in particular environmental management) also have spin off benefits for the community not related to dengue control, including greater advocacy skills and an increase in civic pride. Unfortunately none of the studies provided clear descriptions or rationale for how they selected key community groups or leaders and none provided information on the content of their education and awareness activities or any models of behaviour change on which these had been based. This limits the ability to generalise findings to other social and cultural contexts or adapt successful programs for trial in other locations. It should also be noted that the highest quality evidence was undertaken in Viet Nam which has a fairly hierarchical culture that may have facilitated dissemination of information and increased social compulsion to engage with project activities.\n\nThere was only limited evidence for the sustainability of interventions. However, in studies with more than two year follow up periods, factors that promoted sustainability included broad community involvement across different levels (rather than isolated groups), and a sense of community ownership of and pride in the control program. Where activities were embedded into the economic activity of the community (e.g. support for recycling businesses) this also improved sustainability. However, it was also noted that community based programs still need support from authorities and cannot be solely based on the efforts of volunteer individuals and community groups. We would also add that it is unclear the extent to which being part of a research project with access to a highly skilled, motivated and engaged research team contributes to levels of effectiveness.\n\nKay et al. 57 reported a lower level of effectiveness for their intervention when it was rolled out as part of a regional program. This has implications for the use of any of these methods of dengue control as part of a larger program. It is well recognised that adequate resourcing for both start up and maintenance of interventions is important to ensure that the program functions well and communities maintain engagement as without this effectiveness is compromised. 94 Although some interventions are low cost per person covered, the total cost may still be large. It would be worth exploring mechanisms to offset these costs as was done in the Viet Namese studies where some of the profits from recycling businesses were put back into community dengue awareness activities.\n\nWe found little evidence of evaluations of ongoing laboratory, animal or human surveillance systems set up in many countries in response to the SARS outbreak in 2003, nor any assessments of regional surveillance networks or linkages between countries in the Southeast Asian region, given the geographical restrictions placed on the scope of this review.\n\nThe single study by Escudero et al. of work-place surveillance within a hospital in Singapore was tested within a very structured work context, within which there was access to electronic staff leave records. 34 It is unclear whether this system would work in a more loosely structured work environment.\n\nThe absence of electronic systems would also increase the labour resources required for such a system. The lack of specificity and the possibility of -false outbreaks\u2016 which could eventually lead to fatigue amongst the staff and agencies involved in responding to potential outbreak situations limit its applicability as an ongoing surveillance system in its current form.\n\nThe study reporting on use of temperature screening amongst school children during the epidemic describe the benefits of this type of surveillance as psychological. 73 A similar argument has been made for the use of temperature screening at airports 97 which was also costly and had a very low yield in terms of detecting SARS cases. Whilst it is important to avoid negative reactions and panic amongst the community during outbreaks, these screening systems are an expensive (and ongoing) investment and it is unclear if they could be implemented in more resource constrained settings.\n\nThree of the four studies 51, 63, 73 included in this section of the review focused on contact tracing and quarantine protocols. While the fourth study 75 looked at the effectiveness of personal protective equipment to prevent infection, the quality of the study was poor and the results of the study were of limited value. We did not find other studies reviewing other prevention and control measures (for example, handwashing, temperature screening, closure of workplaces and schools, education campaigns).\n\nThe three studies from Singapore all used the same outbreak dataset, and reach similar conclusions that the system was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases as the outbreak progressed. They also saw a reduction in the number of secondary infections over time.\n\nAs SARS cases are only infectious whilst symptomatic, and they become more infectious over time, it is logical that this strategy would have been successful in helping to contain the outbreak in Singapore. Indeed the outbreak was brought under control. However, a range of other communityfocused strategies were also put in place, including entry and exit screening at airports, market closures, temperature screening in school children and a variety of media health education campaigns, alongside the host of strategies put in place within healthcare facilities. Because of this, the studies are unable to estimate the independent effect of this particular intervention in stopping the outbreak, and no attempt has been made to analyse the size of the effect of confounding and interaction on the authors' results. Furthermore, although the system was sensitive (a quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis) it was not specific (only 0.5% of those isolated went on to develop SARS) making it highly resource intensive per SARS case detected.\n\nResults from the study by Tuan are of limited value. As 95% of the contacts reported never using a mask, the study is underpowered to detect any beneficial impact from using this intervention. As such\n\nPage 55 no conclusions about the effectiveness of this intervention can be drawn. Earlier systematic reviews of the use of masks and other personal protective equipment to prevent transmission of infectious agents have also been unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this approach to control.\n\nWe are limited in the ability to generalise the findings about these interventions to detect and/or prevent spread of SARS because four of the five studies that were included were from Singapore, considered an -economically advanced country\u2016 with high GDP and level of education, and other particular features such as an urban setting and a small population. It has strong government and political leadership and good levels of community support. A significant proportion of its public are proficient with information technology. The challenges with implementing surveillance of SARS (and other respiratory diseases) in other Southeast Asian countries with less capable national agencies and healthcare institutions will be to engage with community-level healthcare workers and clinics to implement some form of symptomatic or sentinel non-confirmatory surveillance system.\n\nThe success of quarantine and home isolation measures in Singapore was in part due to the capability of the Singaporean government to commit significant financial resources to enforce this policy with random phone checking, electronic camera surveillance, nurse visits and financial incentives. It is unlikely these strategies would work in a resource-challenged country, either due to a lack of financial commitment from the government, the lack of technology (telephones, cameras), or a less well developed infrastructure. This is likely to be particularly true for rural and remote areas.\n\nThere are also particular social and cultural features of Singaporean society that may have contributed to the high levels of acceptability and compliance with quarantine and isolation measures. Finally, tolerance for this approach outside a high profile outbreak scenario is likely to be low.\n\nThe PDSR program in Indonesia has been very successful in detecting HPAI in backyard poultry and allowed a clear and accurate picture of the disease status of HPAI in this sector. 42 It has also added value to existing veterinary health services in Indonesia and proved to be a good investment, not just for AI, but also for other animal diseases. would be able to roll out a similarly extensive program. Surveillance programs would have to be setting-specific and tailored to the needs and funds available of the host country. A further challenge for surveillance of HPAI is to transition the achievements gained in the program into a sustainable national system that continues to be accepted. Other than the studies presented in Cambodia and Indonesia, no evidence was found for animal or human surveillance at a community level in the other countries included in this review.\n\nThe study by Samaan et al. indicated that rumour surveillance based on internet sources is timely and low cost but although it's sensitivity has been demonstrated it is not clear whether the system is specific enough to be of use. 43 Detection of too many -false\u2016 outbreaks will limit the credibility of the system. Nevertheless, pilot studies of low cost systems such as this are an important avenue of research to try and extend surveillance coverage to areas with lower levels of information technology, laboratory and healthcare infrastructure.\n\nEvidence for prevention and control interventions were reported in programs in Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Indonesia. Awareness of HPAI and education regarding risky poultry handling behaviours were common themes in the educational interventions. While the training and education seems to have been well-received, it did not always translate into behaviour modification or change.\n\nAs some programs were not evaluated, it is difficult to say which components of the intervention have failed and why. An internet rumour based surveillance system represents a potential low cost and timely form of surveillance to inform immediate public health action, but may be limited in its applicability, across the region as it depends highly on the level of engagement of local public health professionals with the chat forums and mailing lists searched, and journalists awareness of AI and quality of reporting. It needs to be demonstrated whether it is capable of detecting outbreaks in resource limited areas where citizens may not have access to the technology on which the system relies.\n\nThe prevention and control interventions in the PDSR program in Indonesia had limited success in controlling and eliminating HPAI, for a variety of reasons. Veterinary officers have no legal mandate to enforce culling or movement restrictions of dead or infected poultry. Furthermore, in the absence of financial compensation for loss of livelihood, farmers are under no obligation to report mortality or sickness in animals and will not comply with the requests of disease control officers, and therefore interventions need to be setting-specific. This comes back to the theme of -participatory epidemiology\u2016engagement of the farmer in decision-making through education and training, but the corollary, that is, recognition of the needs of the community are also essential.\n\nThe studies stressed the importance of engaging local people and civil societies, who can provide rich institutional resources to support difficult changes in health and animal husbandry practices. It was also recognised that local people have rich and detailed knowledge about the animals they keep and the diseases that affect them (termed -existing veterinary knowledge\u2016), whilst researchers often do not know or understand the local context. In SE Asian countries, the poultry industry involves an enormous and diverse set of small entrepreneurs, linked in a number of business relationships and with a wide range of players. Effective HPAI control will require engagement at all levels of the industry. Issues such as financial compensation (or the lack of) for control activities will have to be JBI Database of Systematic Reviews & Implementation Reports JBL000603 2013;11 (2) \n\nSeveral common themes emerged when reviewing the literature for the five diseases examined in this systematic review. On the whole, the quality of the studies was low to medium, with evidence on evaluations of surveillance and prevention and control programs not always identified. Evidence on the costs, cost benefits, feasibility and sustainability of these programs was also scarce. Interventions tended to have been evaluated as research or pilot projects rather than as ongoing activities. Most interventions had only been trialled in a single context and durations of follow up were short, limiting the evidence for generalisability and sustainability of findings. Given the limited quantity and quality of information on surveillance and control programs for emerging infectious disease in this region, the findings and conclusions drawn from this review should be interpreted with caution. Absence of evidence for an intervention should not be interpreted as it being ineffective or less effective in specific contexts, rather there is no available published evidence. Similarly, absence of evidence for contextual factors should not be taken to reflect their influence, or otherwise, over the functioning of programs, but rather a lack of reporting.\n\nAppraisal of effective programs showed that sensitivity to local context, attitudes and mores is essential. Many studies were identified where the intervention was not successful or partly successful because of local cultural or social factors. The need for adequate resourcing was also a common theme. Finally, investment in national veterinary and local animal health services appears to have been either absent, insufficient or not given enough priority. Linkages between this sector and human health need to be strengthened. The framework of \u2017One Health', proposed by the FAO, WHO and the OIE, to expand interdisciplinary collaborations to address the animal-human-ecosystem interface, needs further investment for these diseases in this region.\n\nEvidence evaluating both veterinary and public health surveillance systems for rabies was not identified; this lack of evidence may in fact reflect the fact that there are no or poorly functioning systems in place. Canine vaccination appears to be the most promising strategy for control, but investment in education is essential for a successful vaccination campaign. Rabies control was more likely to be successful when canine vaccination was used in conjunction with other control strategies.\n\nHowever, canine control activities (including vaccination, sterilisation and culling) are not always popular with the public, and country-specific cultural attitudes can be important. Treatment programs for exposed cases continue to be expanded which has helped to reduce mortality rates, but not rates of exposure to rabies.\n\nWhile the concepts of farm-gate biosecurity and herd health monitoring were discussed at the OIE/DVS meeting, there has not been any further progress on recommendations set out at the meeting or any recent publications discussing progress in this area. All evidence on control activities has been in response to the outbreak. Data from targeted and ongoing surveillance as well as the cost and feasibility of the interventions will be essential to guide future prevention and control efforts outside of an outbreak setting, both of which have been absent from the literature. Local traditional farming practices will have to be considered when drafting policies and protocols for sound farm management practices.\n\nThe dengue vector is amenable to short term control via a variety of vector control methods. Currently there are not enough studies of the same intervention type, nor many direct comparisons of interventions to be able to assess whether one form of intervention is more successful than another at reducing larval indices.\n\nWhere vector control is sustained, this appears to result in a reduction in dengue cases. However, many of the existing studies evaluating dengue control interventions do not have a long enough follow-up period to enable an assessment of the sustainability. Environmental management to reduce larval habitats is an effective way at reducing vector numbers and can be used in both urban and rural areas. It is often supplemented with the use of either biological (such as copepods) or chemical (such as Temephos \u00a9 ) larvicidal agents. The latter is reported as being less acceptable due to problems with smell and taste. The former has good evidence for sustainability and is low cost, but the suitability of this control method in settings where water is not obtained from large centralised tanks has not been evaluated. Disease education is important but in the absence of other coordinated activities does not result in improved control practices.\n\nThere is limited evidence for the use of interventions outside research projects. Studies that have evaluated roll out of interventions to regional programs indicate that effectiveness may be reduced, possibly due a lower level of access to technical expertise and lack of involvement of communities in the program planning stages. Sustainability requires communities to take ownership of ongoing control activities. High levels of community engagement require multiple methods of communication and activities.\n\nLittle evidence was available on evaluations of ongoing laboratory, animal or human surveillance systems implemented after the outbreak in 2003, nor any assessments of regional surveillance networks or linkages between countries in the SE Asian region. The single study of hospital recordsbased surveillance was conducted within a very specific setting and not generalisable. No communitybased surveillance interventions were identified.\n\nThe majority of studies examining control interventions were based on the analysis of outbreak data to review contact tracing and quarantine protocols. While control measures were shown to be effective, they did not control for confounding from other community-focused control strategies. No other studies reviewing other prevention and control measures were identified. Most included studies were from Singapore, an advanced country that is very urbanized, and with a small population. Control measures were costly and cannot be applied in resource-challenged settings. The geographical scope of the review posed a limitation on the evaluation of control interventions for SARS as it excluded studies from China, Taiwan and Canada, countries that were most impacted by the outbreak of SARS in 2003.\n\nThere appear to be large investments in several countries in SE Asia on training, educational and surveillance initiatives, but evidence on the evaluation of these programs was not always identified.\n\nSurveillance in the backyard poultry sector has been successful in identifying HPAI in backyard poultry flocks, but needs to be broadened to include other sectors of the commercial poultry industry.\n\nSurveillance interventions have had added spin-off benefits of strengthening the local animal health\n\nPage 60 services. Prevention and control efforts have proved more challenging for a number of reasons.\n\nSuccessful educational campaigns have not always translated into behavior modification and change. Involvement of and recognition of the needs of the community are essential in addressing these barriers to change. Community programs have been largely reliant on external funding, and the challenge will be to incorporate them into the national process where the programs can become institutionalised in a sustainable way.\n\nA major limitation of this review was that our literature search was limited to studies published in the English language, which will have excluded studies conducted in local languages and published in local non-English journals. The geographical scope of this review (the ten member countries of the ASEAN) also poses a limitation that had a great impact on the analysis of interventions for SARS as it excluded studies from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Canada; countries that were most impacted by the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Transmission of SARS in countries within the geographical scope of this review was mainly within the hospital setting, 99 thus much of the available evidence concentrates on the prevention of nosocomial transmission and protection of healthcare workers, rather than evaluation of community-based strategies, and was excluded from the review.\n\nA further limitation is that the review only included studies with empirical data and therefore, at least for some of the diseases, this resulted in a small number of included studies. Practical implications may also need to consider data from mathematical modelling studies, which were excluded from this review. Although these studies are essentially hypothetical, inferences from these studies may provide useful insights into the epidemiology and transmission of disease and can be used to predict the likely coverage, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different possible interventions under a range of scenarios.\n\nAnother limitation is that cross-sectional surveys of knowledge, attitude and practice regarding disease and prevention and control activities were excluded as outside the scope of this review and are listed in Appendix V. Although they do not test the effectiveness of an intervention they may provide information useful to plan the successful implementation of interventions. Similarly, our exclusion of purely qualitative studies limits our analysis of behavioural contextual factors that may affect the effectiveness of interventions. Our review has shown that these factors strongly influence a person's decision to act contrary to the clear health messages being delivered, or to engage with a program's messages and activities. The reasons that govern such behaviour and the decision-making process may be better elicited through an appraisal of qualitative research.\n\nSome of the studies excluded from the review were done so on the basis that they were only available in abstract form and a full copy of the study could not be obtained for review. As such we are aware that there is potentially more evaluations that have been conducted than have been fully reported. If there is a systematic bias in which studies are published, this will bias review results.\n\nFinally, countries such as Thailand (a developing country) and Singapore (considered an \u2017advanced country'), have well established national health agencies and healthcare institutions. We excluded from the review studies that evaluated purely government-driven national health institutions or systems, however, some -top-down\u2016 government-driven initiatives may include local level community involvement and engagement in concert with the centrally coordinated response, especially in outbreak situations. As many studies do not or cannot provide a detailed description of every element of the intervention it is possible that we did not identify some activities with community-based elements. Exclusion of these studies also meant we were unable to undertake a broader analysis of a country's health systems which is relevant in the context of community-based health interventions transitioning into a national approach.\n\nSeveral implications for practice can be derived from the findings of this review. There are a number of general recommendations that relate to all five emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases included in the review, as well as recommendations specific to each disease. Each recommendation is assigned a level of evidence according to JBI criteria for evaluation of effectiveness studies (see Appendix VI). Where information on interventions was not available we are unable to comment on whether they are likely to be effective or what contextual factors may influence this. This should not be taken as evidence that these strategies are ineffective but rather represents a gap in our current knowledge.\n\nThe studies included in the review provide no detailed evidence for risk assessment in development of the interventions trialled (or indeed any program planning tools/frameworks utilised). This limits the ability to draw conclusions about which interventional approach may be most appropriate for a given setting where no situational analysis has or can be conducted.\n\nLinkage of animal and human health systems for detection and control of disease is essential for zoonotic infectious diseases as animals represent the main reservoir of infection. We found only limited evidence for programs based on the framework of \u2017One Health'. Some contextual information is available showing linkages need to be multi-level and be compatible with economic activity to be successful. The evidence for this is discussed under each disease. However, no information was provided in the studies on how linkage of these systems is best achieved. \uf0b7 Community participation in programs is higher where people perceive the disease as an important public health problem and are well informed about the control program and perceive it as likely to be effective (Level 3).\n\n\uf0b7 Interventions that conflict with the economic activity of communities are poorly tolerated, whilst those that are compatible, or offer new economic opportunities, are well received (Level 2). \uf0b7 Improved treatment protocols have been effective in reducing the number of rabies deaths in humans potentially exposed to rabies through animal bites. (Level 3)\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations benefit from human rabies being notifiable, even where monitored via a passive surveillance system based in PET distribution clinics and hospital cases. (Level 3). \uf0b7 Animal tracking systems used in swine surveillance required permanent forms of animal marking (such as ear notching) to reduce attempts to defraud the system. (Level 3).\n\n\uf0b7 A cross-regional plan of trace back systems between Asian countries makes sense as much as local and national systems to track the movement of pigs. (Level 4) . o Separation of animal farms from orchards and fruit and vegetable growing areas where fresh food is grown for human consumption. (Level 4).\n\n\uf0b7 The dengue vector is amenable to short term control via a variety of vector control methods.\n\nWhere control is sustained this results in a reduction in dengue cases. (Level 2).\n\n\uf0b7 Interventions using copepods, environmental clean-up and education activities are effective at reducing larval indices, mosquito indices and incidence of dengue to the point of local elimination. The strategy is low cost and sustainable. It is effective in urban and rural settings but is most suitable in settings where water is obtained from large central tanks. (Level 2).\n\n\uf0b7 A combination of environmental vector control and education without biological agents is also effective at reducing larval and mosquito indices. (Level 3).\n\n\uf0b7 Environmental vector control and larviciding of breeding habitats is effective at reducing larval indices, incidence of dengue and dengue morbidity in both urban and rural areas. (Level 3).\n\nTargeted control where the most productive habitats are targeted for environmental clean-up or introduction of copepods is equally effective but less costly than a blanket program which includes all containers. (Level 2). The use of chemical larvicides in water supplies is less well tolerated by communities than biological control agents. (Level 3).\n\n\uf0b7 Chemical vector control based on fogging is equally effective but more costly than environmental vector control and there is no evidence for its sustainability. \uf0b7 Environmental and waste management are important to the success of interventions. To ensure the intervention is sustainable communities need to take ownership and responsibility for these activities. Providing opportunities for economic activity in this area can support this process. (Level 2).\n\n\uf0b7 Passive surveillance in healthcare workers can be used to detect outbreaks of febrile illness. The cost and timeliness of the system will depend on the extent to which staff medical records are electronic. (Level 3)\n\n\uf0b7 Contact tracing and large scale isolation and quarantine is effective in reducing the time to isolation of suspected cases and reducing the number of potential contacts in urban areas, however its use is best suited to outbreak situations and should be restricted to situations \n\n\uf0b7 Communities have veterinary knowledge that can be successfully tapped to identify high risk areas or potential outbreaks amongst poultry. (Level 3). Village (backyard or farm) based surveillance is successful at identifying high risk areas and potential outbreaks. (Level 3).\n\n\uf0b7 A multi-country rumour surveillance system based on web sources was successful at identifying outbreaks in a low cost and timely manner. \uf0b7 Culling of sick poultry is effective at preventing spread of HPAI but is not well received by community members in the absence of financial compensation. (Level 3).\n\nThe review identified many important gaps in the available evidence. Suggestions for future areas of research which would benefit from methodically sound quantitative studies are discussed below.\n\nGeneral comments applicable to all five emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases have been listed as well as suggestions specific to each disease.\n\n\uf0b7 Better evidence is needed on the structure, functioning and outcomes of current local and national surveillance systems for emerging infectious diseases. Ideally these should be longterm studies capable of assessing sustainability rather than short pilots. Further evaluations of promising novel methods of surveillance utilising technology such as mobile phones or the internet should also be undertaken.\n\n\uf0b7 Minimum datasets should be designed for use in outbreaks, to ensure more comprehensive data collection that will allow for more rigorous evaluation of the impact of outbreak control measures.\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations of prevention and control programs need to be longitudinal rather than crosssectional and report on the impact on disease outcomes, health knowledge and practices, as well as information on the acceptability, cost and sustainability of programs.\n\n\uf0b7 Education and awareness programs should be designed and evaluated against models of behaviour change to facilitate extrapolation of findings to other contexts.\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations of successful prevention and control interventions require replicating in other countries to test the generalisability of findings across different social, cultural and geographic contexts.\n\n\uf0b7 More evidence is needed from a wider range of countries, in particular resource-constrained settings with less well developed infrastructure.\n\n\uf0b7 To improve generalisability, more comprehensive descriptions of the community engagement strategies and activities used, and information on the acceptability and uptake of the program by different sectors of the community would be useful.\n\n\uf0b7 There is a need for translational research to look at how findings from successful interventions can be translated into effective practice.\n\n\uf0b7 Long term evaluations of established rabies surveillance systems are needed that report both process and outcome measures. Researchers should investigate novel methods for passive surveillance for this disease and investigate linking data from veterinary and public health sources.\n\n\uf0b7 There is a need for more evaluation of alternative prevention and control activities, such as canine sterilisation. Outcomes should include measures of human and canine disease, cost and sustainability as well as process indicators such as uptake.\n\n\uf0b7 The use of education and awareness programs should be evaluated to investigate whether they are able to improve uptake of canine intervention strategies.\n\n\uf0b7 Research should try to identify a suitable animal sentinel for Nipah virus that could be placed under surveillance, as well as identifying animal reservoirs and factors that increase the likelihood of host-animal transmission that could be targeted by control programs.\n\n\uf0b7 There is a need for evaluations of educational programs for farming communities. Studies should report data on process outcomes such as farm management practices and human disease outcomes, as well as rates of disease in pigs.\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations that compare different methods of dengue prevention and control are required. This will allow identification of the independent contribution of specific components of the program to overall effectiveness and identify the most effective strategies. Evaluations should also include measures of cost and sustainability to allow identification of the most efficient long term interventions to reduce the incidence of dengue.\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations need longer follow-up periods to control for seasonality and the epidemic pattern of disease. They should also provide data on the cost and sustainability of programs.\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations should report data on dengue incidence and dengue mortality rather than relying on vector indices or process measures for the intervention such as KAP scores or percentage uptake. Further investigation of the correlation (if any) between vector indices (particularly larval indices) and dengue incidence would be useful.\n\n\uf0b7 Researchers should provide more comprehensive descriptions of the community engagement strategies and activities used, and information on the acceptability and uptake of the program by different sectors of the community.\n\n\uf0b7 A description of the role of the research team in projects under evaluation would also be useful to understand how this might impact the success of interventions offered via routine dengue programs rather than in a research environment.\n\n\uf0b7 A wider range of interventions aiming to prevent or control spread of viral respiratory illness needs to be studied, including the effectiveness of masks and other personal protective equipment, hygiene promotion and disease awareness campaigns, in both close patient contacts and the wider community.\n\n\uf0b7 Evaluations of veterinary surveillance systems for avian influenza should look for any evidence of correlation with incidence of influenza in human populations. resulting from reliance on any of the information or views contained in this publication Feedback on methods and preliminary findings for the review were obtained from attendees of the following conferences where the review was presented:\n\n\uf0b7 Campbell Collaboration Colloquium 2012, Copenhagen, in the session -Systematic Reviews in International Development\u2016 \uf0b7 15th International Congress of Infectious Diseases, Bangkok, in the session -Emerging Infectious Diseases\u2016.\n\nNo financial conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nDr. Lydia Leonardo was involved in the first national parasitic disease survey in the Philippines and the implementation and monitoring of control interventions for Schistosomiasis japonicum.

The following databases were searched: PubMed and CINAHL (via EBSCoHost), ProQuest, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Only studies that met the inclusion criteria of randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after trials or interrupted time series were evaluated 22 .\n\nA two step search strategy was utilised in these databases, as specified below.\n\n\uf0b7 Primary search strategy: Country of interest + Disease of interest + the terms: -surveillance\u2016, -prevention and control\u2016, and -outbreaks\u2016.\n\n\uf0b7 Secondary search strategy: Disease of interest + Search terms: -surveillance\u2016 OR -prevention and control\u2016 OR -outbreaks\u2016 + Search terms: -community\u2016 OR -intervention\u2016 or -effectiveness\u2016 OR -education\u2016.

Quantitative assessment: entomological indices using larval survey form to assess success of source reduction activities Swaddiwudhipong, 1992 72 Chemical vector control (temephos larvicide and insecticide spraying) Environmental vector control (clean up and source reduction) Education Vector control using insecticide treated curtains. Uptake at start of intervention to determine acceptability, follow-up surveys post curtain distribution to determine short term and continued use Acceptance of intervention (measured by % uptake at distribution) and its determinants, Use of IT curtains (short term use at 5 months, continued use at 18 months) and its determinants Author says: \"Increase in indices in intervention group in 4 th and 6 th month because some households had changed and washed curtains. By the sixth month, >60% of households had washed curtains once and 52% of households were not using their curtains anymore\". Difficult to say how successful the curtains were. Nam, 1998 62 Number of cement tanks with copepods went from 87% to 95% and ceramic jars went from 56% to 83%. No information on KAP survey completed by participants; program assessed control of dengue vectors, but did not have effect on DHF rates, which are influenced by other factors (seasonal pattern, interaction from existing program) ; also mentions incidence DHF in the region small; failure to complete 2d course by some family leaders, substitution by other members; also mention family leaders had problems with filling in larval survey form, so means this information was self-reported rather than filled by trained staff Phan-Urai, 1995 65 Indices quoted below: pre-intervention, thereafter % reduction after treatment ( 85, 56.5, 62.4, 48.2, 69.4, 84.7, 84.7, 83.5, 69.4, 69.8* (*p<0.05) CI: 51.8, 71.0, 76.8, 73.0, 82.6, 92.3, 94.2, 96.1, 86.5, 84.1 BI: 76.0, 77.9, 69.3, 81.8, 82.8, 94.0, 95.1, 87.9, 84.4 Landing rate: 8.1, 43.2, 48.2, 88.9, 80.2, 66.7, Indices quoted below: pre-intervention, thereafter % reduction after treatment ( 5, 2.9, 20.2, 22.5, 11.2 CI: 44.8, 10.7, 28.6, 37.5, 44.2, 35.6 BI: 344.5, 16.1, 30.0, 44.8, 51.5, 43.1 Landing rate: 8.2, 35.4, 24.4, 51.2, 54.9, 30.2 Biting rate: 5.8, 36.2, 22.4, 48.3, 65.5, 41.5 Bti formulation effective and practical for control of Aedes aegypti larvae Pilot study of Bti in small number of households.

Limitations: 1. Number of cases of dengue, morbidity indicators and costs are all calculated based on ratio of dengue cases in intervention area relative to elsewhere in Cambodia, however, rates of dengue were very different in the two areas at baseline. 2. Epidemiologic data were not available below province level, meaning that 27.6% of the population who received the intervention were classed in the control group for outcome data. 3. data sources for dengue incidence came from hospital surveillance systems so would have missed many less severe cases. 4. in some control areas educational campaigns and distribution of temephos was undertaken by an NGO. Suroso, 1990 70 ( Swaddiwudhipong, 1992 72 Number of larval containers at schools reduced during study (11.3 to 0.7 in kindergartens, 7.9 to 0.7 Reduction in Apr +Jun89, then increase in Aug89 coinciding with rains.\n\nNo control group 1. HE efforts made more sig reductions of mosquito population in epidemic year (1990) than in inter-epidemic yrs (1988, 1989 Pre-intervention regression analysis showed community status best predictor of larval survey behaviour practices (beta=0.469, eta=0.468), followed by educational level (b=0.179) and male sex (b=0.089) Program successful. Knowledge, perception, self-efficacy, larval survey practices in intervention group higher than before test and compared to control group. CI, HI, BI decreased sharply and confirmed effectiveness of study program.\n\nScoring system not explained. Program was targeted at key community stakeholders, so not surprising educational level and sex predictors of high scores at the start, as they are likely to be both more educated and male. Would have been useful to report on DHF incidence in the year post intervention. (1.2-4.1) and low SES (odds ratio 5.3 (2.8-10 .0); 3. At 18 months, use determined solely by perceived effectiveness (odds ratio 4.9 (3.1-7.8) .\n\nrequired. Active engagement of community in promotion of continued use may be an avenue. 3. Assoc between continued use and perceived effect needs investigating, and this could have been done with qualitative component to study. 4. Drastic decline of curtain use at 18mths limits introduction of IT curtains into dengue control programs.\n\n\"perceived effectiveness\"\n\nPage 128 In one province, the program receives VND 10 million from local authorities in recognition of wider community benefits of dengue control Water supply based around large tanks suitable for mesocyclops control -unlikely to be as effective in cities with reticulated water and greater waste management issues but could be used in focused areas such as tyre piles.\n\nCopepods are a natural resource existing in most communes and can be produced at low cost Kittayapong, 2008 58 All vector control tools were locally produced. Water jars main mosquito breeding sites. Education was needed to make sure people used jar covers.\n\nCombination of governmental top-down and community-based bottom-up approaches. Madarieta, 1999 59 Both barangays highly endemic for dengue fever. Barangays were similar in demographic and socioeconomic variables, also similar number of dengue fever cases Knowledge of preferred containers as breeding places aids health worker in conducting the information, education and communication campaign.\n\nIncrease in indices in intervention group in fourth month and in sixth month because some households had changed and washed curtains. By the sixth month, >60% of households had washed curtains once and 52% of households were not using their curtains anymore.\n\nLarval collection by entomological teams accompanied by barangay officials and health workers. Nam, 1998 62 Mosquito coils, spray cans of insecticide also in household use; recycling is an important economic activity Mueang district had the highest incidence of DHF. Efforts to control Aedes mosquitoes have been redirected from local health services at provincial level to community-based control using village health volunteers.\n\nInteraction between the key stakeholders and between stakeholders and researcher enhanced reflection and dialogue of the stakeholders.\n\nStakeholders included village health volunteers, village headman, community schoolteachers, subdistrict health officers, and Tambon (sub-district) Administration Organisation (TAO) members. Tan, 2006 73 Average duration between onset of symptoms to isolation decreased from 6.8d in week 2 to 1.3d in week 9. Percentage of probable SARS cases previously identified as suspect increased from 0% in week 2 to 88% in week 9.\n\nPercentage of probable SARS cases previously under quarantine or surveillance increased from 0% in week 2 to 100% in week 9. In total, 58 of 206 probable SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis. Outbreak was halted. No children diagnosed with SARS were detected through temperature screening\n\nThe wide net approach to surveillance and isolation of suspected cases was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases as the outbreak progressed. The challenge is to reduce the numbers that need to be quarantined without decreasing the effectiveness of the measure. Government support committed necessary resources to overcome legal and operational obstacles.\n\nThose quarantined were agreeable to being confined at home. Stigmatisation of quarantined individuals by neighbours was reported.\n\nProper systems within an organisational framework to allow resources to be deployed effectively. Other disease investigation routines and health promotion activities were able to be put on hold. Health education by visiting nurses, electronic surveillance and financial incentives contributed to the low rate of noncompliance. Tan, 2006 73 Surveillance, isolation and quarantine policy worked particularly well due to epidemiological features of SARS, namely patients are symptomatic when infectious and risk of transmission increases with duration of illness -in other words there is little asymptomatic SARS infection or transmission, and SARS is transmitted predominantly through close contact and droplet spread.\n\nNecessity of being able to adapt rapidly to changing information and circumstances. Importance of rapid and accurate information collation and transmission to guide decisionmaking\n\nTimely and transparent provision of information and local updates was important. Government played crucial role in explaining quarantine strategies to public, successfully engaging the public and mobilising governmental and community bodies to assist in the fight against SARS. Better and integrated IT systems developed during the outbreak greatly facilitated the containment strategy. Training, public education, networking, promoting model farms.\n\nOne village health worker in each community participated during project implementation. Formal and informal training provided to all project partners and project recipients. Jost, 2007 35 Establish an active surveillance system, education Veterinary participatory disease surveillance officers trained to conduct surveillance on village-wide basis to detect HPAI events and enhance the national surveillance system face-to-face interview of only 16 participants from Yen Son commune. Some differences in intervention and control group (control group reported a higher proportion of farmers) and also differences in participants pre-and post-intervention in intervention commune (greater proportion of participants reported a higher economic level post-intervention) Perry Samaan, 2005 43 Total of 40 rumours identified from 20 Jan -26 Feb 2004 from 12 countries and 1 SAR 48% from media, 18% from WHO network, 5% from embassy staff, 2% from Pro-Med 23% of rumours confirmed to be true events Average period of verification of true events was 2.7 days (1 -5 days), 9.3 days for false events (1 -26 days) None\n\nRumour surveillance informed immediate public health action and prevented unnecessary and costly responses Includes media and email-based public health discussion. Persons without resources or access to information technology will not be captured by this form of surveillance Van Kerkhove, 2009 78 Reporting to village chief increased and animal health officer decreased (possibly village chief known, health worker perceived to be government and may cull poultry) Awareness of AI high, understanding of transmission low Improvements in basic hygiene practices, reduction in risky poultry handling behaviours Some risky behaviours still persist (allowing children to play with poultry, proper treatment of poultry in household environment) and this needs to be addressed in future public health campaigns Study indicated importance of involvement of local healthcare workers and administrators in H5N1 education and outreach.\n\nChanging behaviours and customs is difficult, especially for residents in rural areas with a one-time educational intervention.\n\nWork supported by the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Diseases from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.
