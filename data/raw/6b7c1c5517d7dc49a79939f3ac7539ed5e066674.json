It is a member of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which facilitates fast signal transmission at synapses. The uniqueness lies in its structure as its heteropentamers are composed of homologous subunits. Conservitivity patterns of these proteins are very significant; till date, the structure of CHRNA7 is not deposited in PDB database.\n\nSince protein structure is related with functionality of protein, hence protein modeling is done to extract protein function from its structure. The proposed structure for each subunit is a conserved N-terminal extracellular domain followed by 3 conserved transmembrane domains, a variable cytoplasmic loop, a fourth conserved transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal extracellular region.\n\nThe protein encoded by this gene forms a homooligomeric channel, displays marked permeability to calcium ions, and is a major component of brain nicotinic receptors that are blocked by, and highly sensitive to, alpha-bungarotoxin. Once this receptor binds acetylcholine, it undergoes an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane [1] . This gene is located in a region identified as a major susceptibility locus for juvenile cyclonic epilepsy and a chromosomal location involved in the genetic transmission of schizophrenia. An evolutionarily recent partial duplication event in this region results in a hybrid containing sequence from this gene and a novel FAM7A gene. After binding to acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and leads to the opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane. The channel is blocked by alphabungarotoxin. Gene expression studies shows that CHRNA7 gene is primarily expressed in the posterior amygdalar nucleus and the field CA3 of Ammon's horn in the mouse, and in the mammillary body in humans [2] . Three-dimensional (3D) structure is the most competent requirement for any advance proteomic analysis or drug designing. In extension to this, the current paper deals with detailed structure modeling along with active site predivction of this potential protein that can act as cumulative target for different neurological anomalies.\n\nHomology modeling is computational method that predicts 3D structure of protein using known protein structure called as template. Template is most cru-cial part of homology modeling since protein sequence is modelled on the basis of structure of template protein. Homology modeling is most accurate computational method for protein structure determination and verification of modelled structure is done by Ramachandran plot and statistical analysis [3] .\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger is a scientific leader in computational chemistry, providing software solutions and services for life sciences and materials research. Prime is a powerful and complete tool for generating accurate receptor models for structure-based drug design. It includes comprehensive protein modeling including both rapid and advanced methods for protein homology modeling, chimeric and multimeric models, protein structure quality analysis [4, 5] .\n\nSearch Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/ Proteins (STRING) is a biological database and web resource of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. STRING imports protein association knowledge from databases of physical interaction and databases of curated biological pathway knowledge.\n\nNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7, CHRNA7 of Homo sapiens (Human) protein sequence is retrieved from Uni-Prot database UniProt id P36544.\n\nProtein structure is modeled by homology modeling method using prime program of Schr\u00f6dinger software suite. Blast search is performed to identify template protein structure [6] . CHRNA7 protein is modeled using 1bg9_a protein as template sequence. Loops are refined and verification is done by protein refinement program of Schr\u00f6dinger software [7] [8] [9] .\n\nModeled protein structure is used to identify effective binding sites on the basis of structural and physical properties using sitemap program of Schr\u00f6dinger software. Five binding sites are predicted that can be used for docking and interaction analysis [10, 11] .\n\nProtein-Protein Interaction Analysis CHRNA7 protein interacting partners are identified using string databse. And functional characterization of chran7 protein is done on the basis of functionality of interacting protein.\n\nHomology modeling of chrna7 using template 2BG9_A. Figure 1 shows the alignment of chrna7 protein sequence with template sequence. Figure 2 shows the structural alignment of chrna7 protein and template structure colored region represent structurally aligned region. Figure 3 shows the modeled structure.\n\nRamachandran plot is used for protein verification. This shows that 80% of residues lie in favorable region ( Fig. 4 ) .\n\nBinding sites prediction is done using sitemap program. Five binding sites were identified and best binding site is identified with a Dscore of 1.228. Figures 5-8 , shows binding sites on modeled chrna7 protein. Table 1 shows 5 binding sites and scores. \n\nCHRNA7 protein interacting partners is identified using string tool using sequence search tool. Figure 9 shows protein interaction map of chrna7 protein.\n\nCHRAN7 protein have interaction with CHRNA protein family along with JAK2, AKT1, PICK1 protein that are involved in neurological disease. Table 2 summarizes interacting protein function and involvement 177 of these protein with neurological diseases. This signifies that chrna7 is a protein that is regulated in neurological disease during neuronal development phase of cell.\n\nChrna7 neurogenesis protein involved in neuronal development and differentiation. Dysfunction of this protein leads to neurological disease such as Alzheimer's, neuroblastoma schizophrenia, and neuroblastoma [12] . Protein interaction analysis shows that CHRNA7 protein also interacts with AKT1 protein, which regulate neuronal differentiation and development, that signifies the role of CHRNA7 protein in neurological diseases [13, 14] . Binding sites shows potent binding regions of protein that can be used for docking studies and drug development. Current analysis are apt to conclude the high level of significance in relation to this protein. This designed or predicted 3D structure of high potential protein can be further used for different neurological problems. Our findings may contribute to it as a cumulative target against them which can be fruitful in obtaining better lead molecules through further advance docking studies and can lighten a path in the area of drug designing at preven-tive or therapeutic aspects. Protein interaction map may give rise a better understanding of this protein with other referential neurologically expressing protein and thus can give a good understanding at system biology level. "}
