{"title": "Electroporated recombinant proteins as tools for in vivo functional", "body": "can reach very high concentrations, we observed linear uptake characteristics over a broad 140 range of input protein concentrations in the EP slurry ( Figure S1A-B) , indicating that EP 141 allows for semi-quantitative delivery of recombinant proteins. In turn, this allows for the 142 generation of cell populations harboring defined amounts of exogenously delivered proteins 143 ( Figure S1C-D) . Importantly, EP is efficient across multiple cell lines and treated cells show 144 little or no sign of damage or toxicity ( Figure S1A and D-F). 145\n\nPreviously, we generated various recombinant versions of stable sub-complexes of the 146 human kinetochore, and demonstrated that they could be used to reconstitute large parts of 147 the kinetochore and of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in vitro (1, 28, 31, 32) . This 148 library of high-quality recombinant samples ( Figure S2 ) already extensively characterized in 149 vitro represented an excellent resource to address the general suitability of EP for in vivo 150 delivery and functional analysis. 151\n\nWe initially tested this approach on BUBR1 (BUB1-related), a multi-domain protein that 152 operates in the SAC. Recombinant BUBR1 1-571 (encompassing residues 1-571 of the 1050-153 residue BubR1 protein, which are sufficient for checkpoint function) (1) fused to a cyan 154 fluorescent protein (CFP) was introduced into HeLa cells at an EP slurry concentration of 155 10 \uf06d\uf04d. In mitotically arrested cells (by addition of the spindle poison nocodazole, a 156 condition that activates the SAC), CFP-BUBR1 1-571 distinctly localized to kinetochores, as 157 revealed by the typical punctuate staining and by co-localization with CREST, an established 158 kinetochore marker ( Figure 1C) . We have shown previously that BUBR1 kinetochore 159 recruitment in human cells requires dimerization with kinetochore-bound BUB1, a BUBR1 160 paralog, through segments that encompass a predicted helical domain in the two proteins 161 (33). In agreement with these previous observations, recombinant CFP-BUBR1 1-571-\u2206Helix , a 162 deletion mutant of BUBR1 lacking the BUB1 binding helix (deletion of residues 432-484) 163 was unable to localize to kinetochores (Figure 1D-F) . Collectively, these results demonstrate 164 that, following EP, recombinant CFP-BUBR1 1-571 binds to its endogenous kinetochore 165 receptor BUB1 in target cells. The efficiency of CFP-BUBR1 1-571 delivery was high and most 166 cells displayed uniform levels of the recombinant protein ( Figure S3) . Thus, electroporation 167 can deliver very similar amounts of recombinant protein into each cell. In the course of this 168 study, this became to be recognized as a general feature of this approach, largely 169 independently of the protein used. 170\n\nWe used the Sortase method (34) to fuse a fluorescent peptide modified with the dye tetra-171 methyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) to the C-terminus of MAD2, another SAC protein. The 172 resulting MAD2 TAMRA was delivered by EP in HeLa cells at an EP-slurry concentration of 5 173 \uf06d\uf04d. Like CFP-BUBR1 1-571 , MAD2 TAMRA was found to localize effectively at kinetochores of 174 nocodazole-treated cells, as shown by co-localization with CREST ( Figure 1G) . 175\n\nFurthermore, we performed co-delivery of CFP-BUBR1 1-571 with MAD2 TAMRA , and found 176 both proteins at unattached KTs in nocodazole-arrested cells ( Figure 1H) . Thus, individual 177 or multiple fluorophore-tagged components of the human KT are faithfully targeted to their 178 respective binding sites after EP. 179\n\nIn addition to localization studies, we tested if EP can be used in combination with in-cell 180 spectroscopic applications, such as FLIM-FRET microscopy (35), to study the 181 spatiotemporal dynamics of recombinant proteins in vivo. KRAS/p21 is a small, globular 182\n\nGTPase with important regulatory functions in many signaling pathways (36). We studied 183 found that EGFP-TF3-KRAS, but not EGFP, predominantly localize to the plasma 191 membrane (Figure S4B) , with a pattern indistinguishable from endogenous, over-expressed, 192 or microinjected . Following addition of EGF, we observed the predicted 193 increase in the donor lifetime of EGFP-TF3-KRAS (Figure S4C-D) . Importantly, our based results were qualitatively and quantitatively identical to the ones that were observed in 195 EGFP-TF3-KRAS microinjection experiments (37), demonstrating the suitability of EP for 196\n\nFRET-based assays in living cells as a valid alternative to protein delivery by microinjection.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/631358 doi: bioRxiv preprint depletion of the endogenous complex\n\nThe experiments discussed in the previous section described delivery of single polypeptides. 201\n\nNext, we tested the suitability of EP for delivery of multi-subunit protein complexes. To this 202 end, we started with the Mis12 complex (MIS12C, where 'C' stands for 'complex'), an 203 extremely stable four-subunit kinetochore assembly of the DSN1, NSL1, MIS12, and PMF1 204 subunits with molecular mass of 120 kDa. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the 205 stability of the MIS12C requires co-expression of all four constituent subunits and reported 206 the development of various co-expression vectors for its heterologous reconstitution in 207 insect cells (39-41). Here we generated a fluorescence version of MIS12C by fusing the 208 coding sequence of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) to that of the PMF1 subunit. We then 209 co-expressed the subunits in insect cells and purified the resulting complex (CFP-MIS12C) 210\n\nto homogeneity ( Figure S2) . 211\n\nWe electroporated CFP-MIS12C into cycling HeLa cells and monitored CFP-MIS12C levels 212 by fluorescent microscopy. At an EP slurry concentration of 8 \uf06d\uf04d\uf02c CFP-MIS12C was 213 clearly visible at kinetochores in the large majority of electroporated cells and with 214 remarkably similar kinetochore levels within the same cell and between different cells 215 ( Figure 2B and Figure S3C ). The ability of the electroporated CFP-MIS12C to reach 216 kinetochores after introduction in the cellular environment indicates that the complex retains 217 its integrity through the electroporation process. 218\n\nIn a more stringent test, we also asked if CFP-MIS12C retained its expected kinetochore 219 function after electroporation. MIS12C is as an assembly hub for the kinetochore, being 220 responsible for the recruitment of a subset of the microtubule-binding NDC80 complexes as 221 well as of KNL1, a signaling platform for the SAC (41, 42) ( Figure 1A) . These functions 222 make MIS12C necessary for timely chromosome congression and faithful cell division. To 223 test the functionality of the recombinant CFP-MIS12 complex, we performed a 224 complementation assay in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous MIS12 complex by the RNA 225 interference (RNAi) methods using silencing RNAs (siRNAs) against multiple subunits, as 226 previously described (43). Effective depletion of MIS12C subunits and uptake of fluorescent 227 proteins was demonstrated by Western blotting (Figure 2A) . This is noteworthy, as it 228 exposes a fundamental advantage of EP over another protein targeting technique such as 229 .

In agreement with previous reports, depletion of MIS12C 231 compromised chromosome congression ( Figure 2B-C) , a consequence of reduced 232 kinetochore levels of NDC80 and KNL1 (43). As shown by live-cell microscopy, EP 233 delivery of CFP-MIS12C into depleted cells, but not of a CFP control, rescued chromosome 234 congression essentially to the levels observed in control cells, indicating that the recombinant 235 complex is functionally active (Figure 2B- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We were curious to 262 assess if extreme elongation of NDC80C affected EP efficiency. As for the MIS12C, also the 263 ~180 kDa NDC80C achieves stability through co-expression of its four subunits (NUF2, 264 SPC24, SPC25, and NDC80) in insect cells ((40, 45) ; Figure 1A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A previously described 293 NDC80 mutant (9A) carrying nine alanine mutations at the phosphorylation sites in the 294 protein's N-terminus establishes hyper-stable KT-MT attachments that cannot be corrected, 295 resulting in frequent chromosome congression errors (47) (48) (49) . We asked if a NDC80C 9A -296 GFP mutant electroporated in HeLa cells had dominant-negative effects in an established 297 biorientation and error correction assay (50). HeLa cells were allowed to enter mitosis in 298 presence of STLC, an inhibitor of the Eg5 kinesin (51) whose activity is crucially required for 299 centrosome separation and spindle bipolarization, resulting in the accumulation of 300 monopolar spindles in which sister kinetochores frequently attach to the same microtubule 301 organizing center (MTOC, the centrosome in this case) in a condition known as synthelic 302 attachment. Upon washout of STLC, Eg5 reactivation, and spindle bipolarization, a 303 functional error correction pathway is required to resolve the synthelic attachments and 304 achieve correct metaphase alignment (50). In this setup, control cells electroporated with 305 GFP or NDC80C WT -GFP corrected erroneous attachments and aligned their chromosomes 306\n\nproperly at the metaphase plate ( Figure 3E ). In contrast, cells electroporated with the 307 NDC80C 9A -GFP mutant were impaired in their correction pathway, and accumulated 308 Spindly is an adaptor protein that promotes the interaction of the minus-end-directed motor 315\n\nDynein with its processivity factor Dynactin (52, 53). Spindly also interacts directly with the 316 ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex, the main constituent of the so-called kinetochore 317 corona, a crescent-shaped structure that assembles on kinetochores in early prometaphase to 318 promote microtubule capture (54) (Figure 1A) . Kinetochore localization of Spindly critically 319 depends on its ability to interact with the RZZ complex (55, 56). The latter, in turn, requires 320 the irreversible post-translational isoprenylation of Spindly with a farnesyl moiety on cysteine 321 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/631358 doi: bioRxiv preprint (57), we reasoned that we could exploit this reaction to promote kinetochore localization of 328 recombinant Spindly in cells experiencing a long-term blockade of FT activity. Two versions 329 of HsSpindly that were N-terminally fused to GFP or mCherry (molecular mass ~95 kDa) 330\n\nwere expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity ( Figure S2 ). Our previous mass 331 spectrometry analysis demonstrated that only trace farnesylation of Spindly takes place in 332 insect cells (57). When we EP-delivered fluorescent recombinant mCherry-Spindly into 333\n\nHeLa cells, we detected a fluorescent signal at the periphery of kinetochores that was 334 comparable to the localization described for endogenous Spindly (Figure 4A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/631358 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe modification of biological macromolecules through the introduction of new 356 functionalities has progressed at a tremendous pace in recent years, enriching the palette of 357 tools for biological investigation with a wide spectrum of functionalities. For instance, 358 genetic code expansion, an approach that allows to introduce old and new chemical 359 functionalities into proteins, from synthetic, photostable fluorescent dyes with high quantum 360 yields to highly reactive activatable groups (e.g. UV-activated cross-linkers and click 361 chemistry tools), is undergoing an explosive development (3, 59). With rapid growth of 362 chemical and synthetic biology, the demand for robust methods to deliver modified 363 synthetic or semi-synthetic macromolecules into cells is growing (60). 364\n\nWhile electroporation has been long recognized for its potential as a delivery approach, 365 questions have been raised regarding the degree of its invasiveness and damage inferred on 366 cellular structures, most notably membranes (61). Here, we have assessed the suitability of 367 batch EP for delivering recombinant proteins into living mammalian cells for various 368 applications in cell biology. In comparison to previous studies that focused on cytosolic 369 proteins devoid of specific localization, our focus was on kinetochores, which are small, 370 discrete subcellular structures. This was crucial, because it enabled a detailed assessment of 371 the effective degree of functional complementation of the electroporated samples. Our 372 results identify EP as a rapid, efficient, and semi-quantitative technique that enables the 373 delivery into various cultured mammalian cell lines of proteins of variable mass and 374 hydrodynamic radius, including the highly elongated NDC80C. Importantly, we provide 375 clear evidence that the delivered proteins remain structurally and functionally intact after 376 delivery, as witnessed by their correct kinetochore localization and, where applicable, ability 377 to complement RNAi-based depletion, dominant negative effects, and immunoprecipitation 378 with endogenous interacting partners. Thus, in addition to its ease of application, EP is very 379 attractive because it allows delivery in sufficiently large cohorts of cells, and is therefore 380 compatible with cell biochemistry, as clearly shown here. 381 .

Here, we have demonstrated how the introduction of a farnesyl chain in 387 vitro rescued the kinetochore localization of Spindly in cells treated with a farnesyl 388 transferase inhibitor. In the future, this approach may be extended to other lipid 389 modifications, and may allow monitoring the behavior of only one or a few modified 390 proteins at the time. Another obvious advantage of in vitro manipulations of macromolecules 391 is that it allows precision labeling with small fluorescent dyes, potentially bypassing limits 392 associated with tagging target proteins with bulky genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. 393\n\nIn this context, EP would expand the toolbox of reagents suitable for live-cell spectroscopic 394 applications such as FLIM-FRET microscopy or FRAP analysis. In summary, we envision 395 that EP has the potential to become a method of choice for delivery of synthetic or semi-396 synthetic proteins into the cellular environment.

Following EP, the slurry was added to 50 ml of pre-412 warmed PBS, sedimented by a 0.5xg centrifugation and trypsinised for 5 to 7 minutes to 413 remove non-internalized extracellular protein. Following one further wash in PBS and 414 centrifugation, the cell pellet was re-suspended in complete imaging medium (without 415 antibiotics) and transferred to a cell-imaging plate (Ibidi). Cells were returned to the 416 incubator and allowed to recover for a minimum of 5 hrs. After recovery, cells were either 417 analyzed by fluorescence microscopy imaging or processed to generate protein extracts to be 418 used for either immunoprecipitation analysis or western blotting. 419 EP with the Amaxa system was performed according to the reported protocol (21). EP 420 conditions described above gave satisfactory results for all the cell types and proteins tested. 421\n\nOnly a small fraction of the tested recombinant proteins proved unsuitable for EP delivery. 422\n\nThis was due to formation of major intracellular aggregates or because the protein samples 423 failed to localize correctly within the cell. We advise to initially vary EP parameters, most 424 notably pulse strength and duration, for optimal performance. Moreover, cell-specific and 425\n\nprotein-specific optimization of such parameter should be always carried out in order to 426 achieve the best trade-off between cell viability and efficient protein delivery. The following 427 are some of the important factor to consider during optimization of protein delivery: 1) In 428 our work, we invariably used protein samples of great purity and homogeneity (high 429 monodispersity and solubility). Although we did not systematically analyze the relationship 430 between protein homogeneity and efficiency of EP, we suspect that protein sample quality is 431 an important factor. 2) Centrifugation of protein sample prior to EP is strongly 432 Actin IgM (Merck Millipore, JLA20, 1:5,000 dilution).
