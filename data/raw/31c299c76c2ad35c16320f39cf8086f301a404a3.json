{"title": "Broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, toxicologic assessment, and materials compatibility of a new generation of accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based environmental surface disinfectant", "body": "Broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, toxicologic assessment, and materials compatibility of a new generation of accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based environmental surface disinfectant Chemical disinfectants are widely used in infection control. 1 Our reliance on them is increasing further in preventive strategies because of rampant antibiotic resistance and mounting threats from emerging and reemerging pathogens. This, in turn, is forcing a closer look at label claims of such products as well as human health and environmental safety of the chemicals in them. 2 Therefore, safer and better substitutes are urgently needed. This report describes our findings on one such formulation.\n\nThis study tested ACCEL TB, a new generation of a patented (US. patent No. 6,346,279), 0.5% accelerated H 2 O 2 (AHP)-based, ready-to-use formulation (pH 3.0) designed for the disinfection of hard environmental surfaces. It contains very low levels of certain foodgrade anionic and nonionic surfactants, which act in synergy with hydrogen peroxide to produce the desired microbicidal activity. The formulation is in the process of registration as an intermediate-level disinfectant in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternationally accepted methods were used to assess the microbicidal activity of the formulation against 21 different types of organism representing vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. The details on these organisms are given in Table 1 .\n\nThe use-dilution method (UDM) of AOAC International 3 and the first tier of the quantitative carrier test (QCT-1) of ASTM International 4 were used to test activity against vegetative bacteria. Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis were tested using UDM, and Staphylococcus aureus was tested using both UDM and QCT-1 methods. In UDM, stainless steel penicylinders were the carriers, and the performance criterion was no more than 1 culture-positive tube out of 60. In QCT-1, flat-bottomed glass vials were the carriers 4 ; the test organism (10 mL) was placed in each vial, dried, and covered with 1 mL of the test substance for the specified contact time at 20\u00b0C 6 1\u00b0C. At the end of the contact time, 9 mL neutralizer (Letheen broth with 0.1% sodium thiosulfate) was added to each vial and the test inoculum resuspended with the help of a magnetic stir bar.\n\nThe contents of the vial were then filtered through a membrane filter (Millipore Corp: 47 mm diameter; 0.2 pm pore size). The vial was rinsed several times with a total of no less than 100 mL saline, the rinses also passed through the same filter, and the filters were then placed on the agar surface of an appropriate recovery medium. The plates were held at the required temperature and for the desired length of time for the organism to grow. The colonies on the plates were counted and log 10 reductions in the viability titer of the test organism calculated. When the number of colony forming units (CFU) was expected to be high, the eluate was first subjected to 10-fold dilutions, and each sample was passed through a separate membrane filter, and the filters were placed on recovery media. The product performance criterion for QCT-1 was .6 log 10 in the viability as compared with the control carriers.\n\nIn UDM, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis were tested using 3 lots of the test solution; one of the lots was 60 days old. For the rest of the bacteria, only 2 lots were tested, and, in QCT-1, 1 lot was tested for Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe quantitative suspension test (QST) of Ascenzi et al 5 was used to test activity against Mycobacterium bovis-BCG, and QCT-1 was used with Mycobacterium terrae as the challenge organism. Two and 3 lots of the test solution were tested for QST and QCT-1, respectively.\n\nIn the AOAC fungicidal activity test, 3 a suspension method, each tube with 5 mL test substance (equilibrated to 20\u00b0C 6 1\u00b0C in a water bath), received 0.5 mL Trichophyton mentagrophytes conidial suspension. The tube was agitated gently after adding the suspension and replaced into the water bath. At the end of the required contact time, a loopful was transferred to an appropriately labeled subculture tube containing 10 mL recovery broth. Secondary subcultures were performed .30 minutes after initial subculture by transferring one loopful from each subculture tube into a similarly labeled secondary subculture tube to rule out fungistatic action. The inoculated and control tubes were incubated for 44 to 76 hours at 25\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C. Subculture tubes were incubated for 10 days at 25\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C. The tubes were visually examined for growth. The acceptance criterion for fungicidal activity was no growth in all subculture tubes.\n\nThe QCT-1 method for fungicidal tests was similar to that described above for bactericidal and mycobactericidal tests, and the performance criterion was also a .5 log 10 reduction. Two and 3 lots of the test solution were tested using the AOAC and the QCT-1, respectively.\n\nASTM standard number E-1053 6 was used to test for virucidal activity. Films of test virus were prepared by spreading 0.2 mL suspension uniformly over the inside bottom surface of 3 separate 100 3 15 mm glass Petri dishes. The plates were held at 20\u00b0C 6 1\u00b0C (relative humidity 5 42%) until visibly dry (approximately 20 minutes). Each dried virus film was exposed to 2 mL test substance (control plates received an equivalent volume of a buffer) at 20\u00b0C for the desired contact time. The inoculated surface of the plates was scraped with a cell scraper to resuspend the contents of the inoculum, and the virus-disinfectant mixture was immediately passed through a Sephadex gel column following \n\nDIS/TSS-10 test method 8 was used with glass squares (2.5 3 2.5 cm) in Petri plates. Each carrier received 20 mL 48-hour-old bacterial culture using a calibrated pipette. The inoculum was spread to within 0.13 inches (0.3 cm) of the edges of the carrier. All plates were then placed at 35\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C for 20 to 40 minutes in a chamber with 40% 6 2% relative humidity (RH). The carriers with the dried inoculum were placed at room temperature, and each plate with 5 carriers received 5 mL test substance for a contact time of 30 seconds. At the end of the contact time, 20 mL of an appropriate neutralizer solution was used to arrest the activity of the test substance. One-milliliter volumes of the eluates were assayed for viable organisms by incubating the inoculated tubes for 48 hours at 35\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. The product performance criterion was a .3 log 10 (.99.9%) reduction in numbers of viable organism as compared with the carrier quantitation control. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested using 3 lots of the test solution, including a 60-day-old sample, and the rest of the bacteria were tested using 2 lots.\n\nIn the AOAC tests, fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Burlington, ON) at a final concentration of 5% was used as a soil load. In QCT-1, a tripartite soil load prepared in phosphate buffer 4, 8, 9 was used instead. Five hundred microliters test inoculum was prepared by adding to each 340 mL of the microbial suspension 25 mL, 100 mL, and 35 mL of stock solutions of 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.4% bovine mucin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 5% tryptone (Ditco, Detroit, MI), respectively; the total protein content of this soil load is roughly equal to that in 5% bovine serum.\n\nLetheen broth (Difco) with 1.0% (wt/vol) sodium thiosulfate was used as the neutralizer in the QCT-1 testing. Letheen broth with 0.07% lecithin and 0.5% Tween 80 was used as the secondary neutralizing subculture medium.\n\nSuitable controls were incorporated to check for sterility of media, reagents and carriers, effectiveness of the microbicide neutralization procedure, and carrier population counts.\n\nAll toxicity tests were performed at Stillmeadow Laboratory (Sugar Land, TX) using the methods of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). One lot of the test solution was used for all toxicity tests.\n\nASTM standards G-1 10 and G-31 11 were used to test the compatibility of the formulation with plastics and metals. The plastics tested were high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), polypropylene (PP), acrylobutadiene styrene (ABS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polysulfone. The metals tested were brass, cold rolled steel, aluminum, and stainless steel.\n\nAs shown in Table 2 , 7 different species of vegetative bacteria were tested using the UDM, and all lots of the product proved to be bactericidal in 1 minute, at 20\u00b0C, in the presence of 5% serum. The number of viable organisms on the carriers was also determined and ranged between 1.0 3 10 5 and 5.0 3 10 6 CFU/carrier. Activity of the test formulation was also assessed against S aureus using the QCT-1. Here again, the contact time was 1 minute at 20\u00b0C. With a baseline titer of 8.95 3 10 6 CFU/control carriers, no viable organisms were detected on any of the 6 test carriers, giving a reduction of nearly 7 log 10 . \n\nTwo lots (3646 and 3647) of the test formulation were tested against M bovis using QST. The level of challenge was approximately 1.3 3 10 8 CFU/mL. The formulation was able to reduce the viability titer of the test organisms to undetectable levels (.6.8 log 10 reduction) after a contact time of only 5 minutes at 20\u00b0C in the presence of 5% serum.\n\nThe mycobactericidal activity of the test formulation was further confirmed with 3 lots of the formulation using QCT-1 and M terrae as the challenge. The level of challenge here was 2.4 3 10 6 CFU/control carrier. It was able to reduce the viability titer of the test organisms to undetectable levels after a contact time of only 5 minutes at 20\u00b0C. This represented a reduction of approximately 6.38 log 10 . Therefore, the test formulation was able to meet the performance criteria for both methods used to assess mycobactericidal activity.\n\nTwo lots of the test formulation were tested for their fungicidal activity using the AOAC suspension test. The level of challenge was 8.3 3 10 7 CFU, and both lots were able to reduce the viability titer of the organism to undetectable levels in 5 minutes at 20\u00b0C in the presence of 5% serum.\n\nAs shown in Table 3 , 3 additional lots of the formulation were tested for their fungicidal activity using QCT-1. The level of challenge was 8.83 3 10 5 CFU/carrier, and all lots of the product were able to reduce the viability titer of the fungal conidia by at least 5.47 log 10 in 5 minutes at 20\u00b0C in the presence of the tripartite soil load.\n\nAs shown in Table 4 , both lots of the product tested proved to be virucidal in 1 minute at 20\u00b0C in the presence of 5% serum.\n\nAs shown in Table 5 , all lots of the product were able to work as a sanitizer in 30 seconds at 20\u00b0C in the presence of 5% serum, against specified bacteria.\n\nThe findings of toxicity testing (Table 6) showed the tested formulation to fall into EPA toxicity category IV, making it exempt from any precautionary statements on the label. \n\nNone of the 12 types of plastics tested were affected by the test formulation after being exposed to the test solution for 2900 cycles of disinfection contact time. Among the metals, only brass showed minor to moderate damage, after 7200 cycles of disinfection contact time, whereas all others remained unaffected.\n\nChemical disinfectants constitute the backbone of infection control. Fourteen types of chemicals singly or in various combinations are in over 90% of the products currently used for this purpose, 2 and several of them either have a rate of microbial kill too slow for field use and/or a poor safety profile. 2 Hydrogen peroxide is among the oldest microbicides known, and it is generated naturally in many settings. However, it is relatively unstable by its very nature and somewhat slow acting when used on its own. 12 Both of these weaknesses have been addressed in that it is now possible to produce highly stabilized forms of H 2 O 2 in solution and also speed up its microbicidal action. Furthermore, its corrosivity has been tamed, thus widening its materials compatibility. The AHP technology has combined these developments to enhance the potential of H 2 O 2 as a microbicide, resulting in formulations for a variety of applications. 13, 14 The stabilizers, surfactants, and other excipients in these formulations have a high safety and biodegradability profile and are free from aquatic toxicants such as nonyl phenol ethoxylates (NPEs) or alkyl phenyl ethoxylates (APEs). 15, 16 The findings summarized here further substantiate the desirable attributes of the AHP-based formulation evaluated.\n\nThe formulation's microbicidal activity was assessed using relevant AOAC and ASTM protocols, and, in the case of fungicidal and mycobactericidal activities, the findings with the suspension test were reconfirmed with the more stringent QCT-1. As shown in Table 1 , the vegetative bacteria tested represented a wide array of nosocomial pathogens. The viruses tested also included important nosocomial pathogens or their accepted surrogates. 17 Although certain of the enveloped viruses tested are not known to spread through contaminated environmental surfaces, they were included to ensure that ACCEL TB, based on a relatively new technology, is successful in dealing with both nonenveloped and enveloped varieties. ASTM protocol No. E-1053 was used for this purpose because it is currently the only protocol accepted by the US Environmental Protection Agency for submission of data for virucidal activity.\n\nAll evaluations for microbicidal activity were performed with an added soil load in microbial suspensions. The soil load was either 5% serum at its final concentration or the tripartite mixture of proteins. 4, 9, 17 Such soil loads not only simulate the presence of body fluids but also add to the level of stringency of the methods for added confidence in the test data. 14 The initial fungicidal tests were based on AOAC's suspension protocol. 3 Because this was considered a weaker challenge to the test formulation, further testing was carried out using QCT-1 to ascertain properly that ACCEL TB has good fungicidal activity.\n\nQCT-1 used in some of the tests reported here offers several advantages over the existing AOAC methods. 14 It has been designed to (1) permit the determination of the exact number of CFU remaining after the drying of the inoculum; (2) avoid wash off of any of the test organism; (3) allow complete recovery of the inoculum from the carrier surface; (4) arrest the test substance's activity by dilution immediately at the end of the contact time; (5) in the case of bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and fungicidal tests, capture all the cells of the test organisms on a membrane filter before and after exposure to the test product; (6) remove any residual microbicidal activity by a thorough rinsing of the membrane filter; (7) incorporate glass inserts to eliminate any false-positive results because of the generation of microaerosols in the carriers; and (8) give a precise determination of log 10 reduction in CFU of the test organism after exposure to the product under test. It therefore, eliminates the deficiencies associated with the AOAC methods. Because the QCT-1 meets the requirements for microbicide testing as in the Canadian General Standards Board, 18 data based on it are acceptable for product registration in Canada.\n\nIn summary, the AHP-based environmental surface disinfectant tested in this study proved to be a broadspectrum and fast-acting microbicide with high safety and materials compatibility profiles.
