{"title": "Cell Reports Supplemental Information Quantitative Proteomics Identifies Serum Response Factor Binding Protein 1 as a Host Factor for Hepatitis C Virus Entry", "body": "(A) Huh-7.5 cells were silenced for SRFBP1 or CD81 as described in Fig. 4B and surface expression levels of CD81 determined by antibody staining and flow cytometry. Unstained: FITC-conjugated isotype control antibody.\n\nThe histogram is representative of four independent experiments and shows the counts of 10,000 cells per experimental condition. (A) Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated with HCV genotype 2a full length genomes (HCV) or left untreated and fixed 48 h later. Cells were stained for SRFBP1, the ER marker calnexin, the lipid droplet dye oil red O, the stress granule marker ataxin 2 and the p body marker DDX6 as described in Figure 4A . Insert: 2.2-fold magnification, scale bar: 10 \u00b5m.\n\n(B) Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were plated on collagenated cover slips, 6 h later incubated with purified eE2 or PBS (mock) for 15 min, fixed and then stained for SRFBP1 and CD81 as described in Figure 4A . Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m.\n\n(C) Pearson's colocalization coefficient for SRFBP1 and calnexin, oil red O, DDX6, ataxin 2 or DAPI in resting Huh-7.5 cells or cells 48 h post electroporation with HCV genotype 2a full length genomes (48 hpe).\n\nPearson's coefficients were calculated by intensity correlation analysis.\n\nEach dot represents one image frame. Mean and s.e.m. for at least four image frames are shown.\n\n(D) Pearson's colocalization coefficient for SRFBP1 and CD81 in PHH with and without eE2 incubation for 15 min calculated by intensity correlation analysis. Each dot represents one image frame. Mean and s.e.m. for at least four image frames and p value are shown.\n\n(E) Huh-7.5 cells were left untreated or incubated with HCV clone 2 (MOI 10) for 15 min, fixed and stained for SRFBP1 and CD81 as in Figure 4A . (E) Huh-7.5 cells were infected with HCV clone 2 (MOI 1) or left uninfected. 72 hpi cells were fixed and stained for SRFBP1 and NS5A as described in Figure 4A . Scare bar 10 \u00b5m. \n\nHuh-7, Huh-7.5 and 293T cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids. In vitro transcripts of HCV full length and subgenomic genomes were prepared and transfected as described previously (Haid et al., 2010) . HCV stocks were generated by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA into Huh-7.5 cells.\n\nHCVcc particles were harvested in DMEM containing 1.5% FCS (J6/JFH clone2, FACSCalibur or Accuri instrument (BD Bioscience). Human coronavirus 229E, in which ORF 4 is replaced by Renilla luciferase, (HCoV229E-luc) was kindly provided by Volker Thiel (Pfefferle et al., 2011) . Infectivity was measured 24 hpi by quantification of luciferase activity in lysates. All virus titers (50% tissue culture infective dose/ml) were calculated after serial dilution based on the 50% endpoint method of Reed and Muench (Ozanne, 1984) . \n\nPrimary human hepatocytes were isolated from liver specimens obtained after partial hepatectomy and plated on collagen at a density of 1.3x10 6 cells in P6 dishes as described in (Kleine et al., 2014) . Cells were kept in hepatocyte culture \n\nOne-step immunoprecipitations of membrane proteins were performed by adapting the protocol of (Schneider et al., 1982) \n\nProteins were denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin as described in (Butter et al., 2012; Meissner et al., 2013 Peptides were separated by HPLC over a 150 min gradient from 2% to 60% acetonitrile and analyzed in an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Full-scan MS was acquired with 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap analyzer, and up to the ten-most intense ions from each full scan were fragmented with collision-induced dissociation and analyzed in the linear ion trap.\n\nMass spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.2.6.1.\n\nCarbamidomethylcysteine was set as a fixed modification, N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation as variable modifications. The spectra were searched by the Andromeda search engine against the human International Protein Index protein sequence database (IPI version 3.68) combined with 248 common contaminants and concatenated with the reversed versions of all sequences.\n\nProtein identification required at least one unique or razor peptide per protein group. The required false positive rate was set to 1% at the peptide and 1% at the protein level, and the minimum required peptide length was set to 6 amino acids. Contaminants, reverse identification and proteins only identified by site were excluded from further data analysis, which was performed in Perseus (Cox and Mann, 2012) .\n\nWe performed functional annotation clustering and enrichment scoring of all 26 SILAC hits using PANTHER (Thomas et al., 2003) (Fig. 1D and 1E ) or DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) version 6.7, with ''high'' classification stringency settings (Huang da et al., 2009) (Fig. 1F ). DAVID analysis yielded 12 highly enriched clusters (EASE score above 1) and 17 clusters in total. We next generated a combined network view based on STRING database interactions and DAVID functional annotation clustering using a Matlab script described in (Mercer et al., 2012) and Cytoscape for visualization. Briefly, we used STRING 9.1 (http://www.string-db.org) to generate interaction networks of significant SILAC hits with a 2.1-fold or stronger dynamic CD81 interaction (Franceschini et al., 2013) . Then, each protein was assigned to the cluster with the highest enrichment, in which the protein was present in the highest fraction of individual annotations. Selected unclustered proteins were placed back in the visualization as inverted arrowheads. All STRING interactions (solid lines) with a confidence score of 0.9 or higher, and all interactions of 0.35 or higher between genes within the same functional annotation cluster were added. Finally, we manually placed functional annotation clusters in their approximate cellular locations. Selected proteins with two cellular locations were placed into both respective places (see Figure 1F ).\n\nHuh-7.5 cells stably expressing Firefly luciferase (Huh-7.5 FLuc) were seeded at a density of 3x10 4 cells per well in a 96 well plate 5 h prior to transfection (Gentzsch et al., 2011) . RNA interference against the 28 dynamic CD81\n\ninteraction partners was achieved with a pool of three independent targeting siRNAs (Ambion Silencer Select). When available validated siRNA were selected. Two scrambled siRNAs served as negative and a pool of three CD81 targeting siRNAs as positive control. To avoid plate effects, four scrambled controls were randomly positioned on the plate and edges were left untreated.\n\nWe transfected 0.5 pmoles of each siRNA per 96 well using lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were infected with the Renilla luciferase reporter virus JcR2A 48 h post transfection (MOI 0.1) and the inoculum replaced with medium 4 h later. Infectivity was assayed 48 hpi by quantification of Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. Residual plate effects were computationally accounted for by normalization to the scrambled control reads. We observed no effect on cell proliferation or viability with the 28 targeting siRNA pools. The CD81 siRNA pool reduced cell proliferation in accordance with the described proliferative role of CD81 (Oren et al., 1990) . In order to eliminate proliferation dependent effects, the specific HCV infectivity was calculated by normalization of Renilla luciferase activity (infectivity readout) to Firefly luciferase activity (viability readout).\n\nHuh-7.5 FLuc cells were electroporated with HCV JcR2A RNA and plated in a 24 well dish (Gentzsch et al., 2011) . We transfected a pool of three siRNAs ( exclude that impaired replication would influence assembly and release readouts.\n\nHuh-7.5 cells were transduced with lentiviral pseudoparticles encoding Firefly luciferase 48 h post siRNA silencing. Luciferase activity was determined and HCVpp specific infectivity calculated by normalization to VSV pseudotypes and a scambled siRNA control.\n\nTo assay for endosomal acidification independent HCV uptake, we adapted a previously described membrane fusion assay (Bitzegeio et al., 2010; Tscherne et al., 2006) . Briefly, Huh-7.5 cells were plated at a density of 5x10 \n\nThe pIRF bicistronic reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Annie Cahour, Jean\n\nDubuisson and Yves Rouille and in vitro transcribed and capped as described in (Laporte et al., 2000) . Full length (pFK_i389F-Luc-EI-Core-5B/JFH1_dg) and subgenomic (pFK_i389LucNS2-3'_JFH_dg) HCV constructs and their polymerase deficient \u0394GDD mutants were transcribed as described previously (Haid et al., 2010) . Huh-7.5 cells were lipofected with 1 ug RNA per 96-well and translational activity measured after 8 h by assessing luciferase activity in cell lysates. Quantification of SILAC hit transcripts after silencing was achieved by SYBRgreen PCR using primers selected from the Harvard PrimerBank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank) and GAPDH as standard for normalization.\n\nFor immunofluorescence analysis Huh-7.5 cells were plated on poly-lysine coated cover slips and where indicated washed with PBS, incubated with 2ug/ml eE2, 7.5 ug/ml E2 antibody (AP33) (Owsianka et al., 2001) DAPI counterstained cells were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade mountant (Molecular Probes, W32466) and analyzed by confocal microscopy using an inversed confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview 1000), using a 60x or 100x magnification lens. The three channels (blue, green, and red) were read in a sequential acquisition mode, with an average of 3 frames for each picture (Kalman n = 3). Data analysis was performed using FluoView (Olympus) and Image J. Intensity correlation analysis was performed using the Image J colocalization analysis plugin. Pearson's colocalization coefficients were calculated for at least four individual frames with 20-40 cells.\n\nFor flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized, quenched and surface stained with primary antibodies (CLDN1, R&D MAB4618; SR-BI, NB400-104; CD81, sc-23962) in PBS containing 1% FCS for 30 min on ice. After a brief wash, secondary PE-or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed three times and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo.\n\nTo assess membrane association of SRFBP1 we performed membrane flotation assays according to (Ghibaudo et al., 2004) . Briefly, 2.8x10 6 Huh-7.5 cells were plated in 10 cm dishes and transduced with SRFBP1-mycDDK encoding pseudoparticles 5 h later. 60 h post transduction cells were washed once with PBS, scraped into 10 ml ice cold PBS, pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 ml ice cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl 2 ) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). After 30 min incubation on ice, cells were dounce homogenized with 12 strokes and cellular debris pelleted at 1000xg for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Membranes were disrupted in 200 ul lysate with 1% TX-100 for 10 min on ice. TX100 treated and untreated samples were diluted with 75%\n\nNycodenz to a final concentration of 37,5%. 0.4 ml of this suspension was overlayed with 0.8 ml 35% Nycodenz and 0.1 ml 5% Nycodenz in PBS.\n\nEquilibrium ultracentrifugation was carried out for 22 h at 4\u00b0C in a Beckmann TLA-55 rotor at 47,000 rpm, 160 \u00b5l fractions collected and analyzed by SDS PAGE and immunoblot for SRFBP1, GAPDH and CLDN1."}
