Abou t fift y percen t o f today' s pharmaceutica l drug s ar e derive d from natura l origi n [1] . Th e growin g interes t i n natura l product s a s a source o f ne w drug s ca n b e attribute d t o man y factor s includin g urgen t therapeutic needs , th e wid e rang e o f bot h chemica l structure s an d biological activitie s o f natura l secondar y metabolites , th e adequac y o f bioactive natura l product s a s biochemica l an d molecula r probes , th e development o f recen t technique s t o accuratel y detect , isolat e an d structurally.characterize th e bioactiv e natura l product s an d advance s i n solving th e deman d fo r suppl y o f comple x natura l product s [1] . Historically, th e majorit y o f th e natura l product-base d drug s includin g cyclosporine, paclitaxel and camptothecin derivatives were first discovered by traditiona l cell-base d in vitro assay s befor e thei r rea l molecula r biological targets were identified [2] . These cellular biological responses of natural products are likely to be associated wit h the inherent properties of secondary metabolites for the defense of their producing organisms [2] , Infectious vira l disease s remai n a worldwid e problem . Viruse s hav e been resistant to therapy or prophylaxis longer than any other form o f lif e due to their nature because they totally depend on the cells they infect fo r their multiplication an d survival. This peculiar characteristic has rendered the developmen t o f effectiv e antivira l chemotherapeuti c agent s ver y difficult. Currently , there are only few drugs available for the cure of viral diseases includin g acyclovi r (1) , the know n antiherpeti c dru g whic h i s modeled o n a natura l produc t parent . I n orde r t o comba t viruse s whic h have devastatin g effect s o n humans , animals , insects , cro p plants , fung i and bacteria, many research efforts hav e been devoted for the discovery of new antiviral natural products. Although the search for naturally occurrin g products whic h ca n interfer e wit h vira l infection s bega n wit h th e successful isolation of antibiotics from microorganism s but it has not been as intensive a s that of synthetic antiviral agent s [3] . This is mainly du e to the tendenc y o f most virologists wh o adop t a rational desig n o f antivira l agents rathe r tha n towar d empiricis m especiall y wit h th e progres s i n knowledge o f vira l replicatio n [3] . Moreover, ther e ar e som e problem s arising from the screening of crude extracts, as well as with the purificatio n and identificatio n o f the antivira l component s fro m thes e crud e extracts . These problems became less intense with the recent advances in differen t chromatographic an d spectroscopi c technologies . Man y natura l an d synthetic compound s wer e foun d t o sho w in vitro antivira l activit y bu t were much les s effective whe n tested in vivo. Thi s could be attributed t o difficulty i n dru g transportatio n t o th e cell s o f th e infecte d tissu e especially i f thes e tissue s becom e inflamme d du e t o infection .

However, natura l product s remai n th e bes t resourc e fo r chemicall y diversed ne w lea d entitie s tha t coul d serv e fo r futur e developmen t a s potent and safe antiviral agents. Recent analysis of the number and sources of antivira l agent s reporte d mainl y i n th e annua l report s o f medicina l chemistry fro m 198 4 t o 199 5 indicate d tha t seve n ou t ofte n syntheti c agents approve d b y FD A betwee n 1983-1994 , ar e modele d o n a natura l product paren t [4] . Thes e drug s are : famciclovi r (2) , ganciclovi r (3) , sorivudine (6) , zidovudin e (7) , didanosin e (8) , zalcitabin e (9 ) an d stavudine (10) [4] .\n\nThe aim of this review is to provide an overview on the central role of natural products in the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs.\n\nThe original Latin meaning of \"virus\" is \"poison\", \"venom\" or \"slime\" [5] . The word \"virus \" was also used figuratively i n the sense of \"virulen t or bitter feeling\", \"stench\" or \"offensive odor \" [3] . In the late 1800s, the term \"virus\" was bestowed on a newly discovered class of pathogens, smaller than bacteria being studied by Louis Pasteur and others of that era [6] . As late as 1907 , \"virus\" was defined a s \"the poison of an infectious diseas e especially foun d i n th e secretio n o r tissue s o f a n individua l o r anima l suffering fro m infectious diseases [5] . In the early decades of the twentieth century, viruses were identified a s infectious agent s that were filterabl e and invisibl e i n the ligh t microscop e whic h superficiall y distinguishe d them from most familiar microorganisms [5] . Today, viruses are defined as noncellular infectiou s agent s that vary in size, morphology, complexity , host range and how they affect thei r hosts [7] . However, they share three main characteristics in common: a) A virus consists of a genome, either RNA o r DN A cor e (it s geneti c material ) whic h i s surrounde d b y a protective protei n shell . Frequentl y thi s shel l i s enclose d insid e a n envelope (capsid) that contains both proteins and lipids, b) A virus can be replicated (multiplied ) onl y afte r it s genetic materia l enter s a host cell . Viruses are absolutely dependen t o n the host cells' energy-yieldin g an d protein-synthesizing machinerie s an d henc e the y ar e parasite s a t th e genetic level, c) A virus's multiplication cycle includes the separation of its genomes from its protective shells as an initial step [7] . When a virus is outside the host cell, it is considered no more alive than a chromosome [6] .\n\nThe interval between successive mitosis of the individual cell is divided into three periods [7] : 1-Th e Gl perio d precedes DNA replication. Its average duration is 12 hours. 2-Th e S period during which DNA replicates. Its average duration is 8 hours. 3-Th e G2 period i n which the cell prepares for th e next mitosis. Its average duration is 4 hours.\n\nRNA an d protei n ar e no t synthesize d whil e mitosi s proceeds , i.e. , during th e metaphas e whic h i s betwee n 0 2 an d G l period s bu t ar e otherwise synthesize d throughou t th e multiplicatio n cycl e [7] . Nongrowing cell s are usually arreste d i n the Gl period ; the resting stat e i s referred t o a s GO. Under norma l grov^h conditions , cells o f a growing culture multiply in an unsynchronized manner, hence cells at all stages of the cycle are present. The aging of cells starts after abou t 50 passages by D slowing their growth rate. The amount of time they spend in GO after eac h mitosis gradually increases . The chromosomal complemen t change s fro m normal diploi d t o aneuploid pattern , supernumerar y chromosome s an d i t finally fragmente d an d th e cel l dies . Malignan t tissue s giv e ris e t o aneuploid cel l line s tha t hav e infinit e lif e span s an d ar e know n a s continuous cell lines.\n\nThe main feature of normal animal cell is its compartmentalization [7] . The DNA o f the animal cel l i s restricted to the nucleus at all cell cycle stage s except durin g metaphas e whe n no nucleus exists . The synthesi s o f RN A occurs i n the nucleu s an d mos t o f i t remains there , but messenge r RN A and transfe r RN A migrat e t o th e cytoplasm . Ribosoma l RN A i s synthesized i n th e nucleolus ; th e tw o ribosoma l subunit s ar e partl y assembled in the nucleolus and nucleus then migrate to the cytoplasm. All protein synthesi s procee d i n th e cytoplasm . Th e mitochondria , whic h i s located onl y i n th e cytoplasm , contain s DNA-s , RNA -an d proteinsynthesizing system s of their own [7] .\n\nViruses replicate in different ways . In all cases, the viral DNA or RNA i s copied repeatedly. Viral proteins are synthesized inside a suitable host cell where man y ne w vira l particle s ar e assemble d [6] . Generall y viruse s replicate through the following stage s [3, 6, 7] , whic h ar e incorporate d int o th e host' s plasm a  membrane.  4-Thes e viral nucleic acids, enzymes and capsid proteins are assembled into ne w vira l particle s (genomes ) togethe r wit h thei r associate d RNA or DNA polymerase. 5-Th e newly formed viral particles are released from the infected cell.\n\nViruses usually replicat e by lytic or temperate pathways. In the lytic pathway, stages 1-4 from above proceeds quickly and the virus is released as the host cells undergo lysis, ruptures and dies after los s of its contents.\n\nIn temperat e pathways , th e viru s doe s no t kil l th e hos t cel l bu t th e infection enter s a period of latency, in which viral genes remain inactive inside th e hos t cell . I n som e case s o f latenc y th e vira l gene s becom e integrated into the host's DNA, replicated along with it and passed along to all daughter cells. In time, damage to the DNA or some other event may activate transcription of the viral genes therefore new viral particles can be produced an d infected cell s are destroyed [6] . Proposed targets of some specific antivira l chemotherap y ar e illustrate d i n Figur e 1 and ca n b e summarized as [3] :\n\n1-Attachmen t (adsorption) of the viral particle to the host cell. 2-Penetratio n of the host cell by infectious viral particles. 3-Particle s uncoating, release and transport o f viral nucleic acid and core proteins. 4-Nuclei c acid polymerase release and/or activation. 5-Translatio n of m-RNA to polypeptides which are early proteins. 6-Transcriptio n of m-RNA. 7-Replicatio n of nucleic acids. 8-Protei n synthesis (late proteins). 9-Vira l polypeptides cleavage into useful polypeptides for maturation. 10-Morphogenesi s and assemblage of viral capsids and precursors. 11-Encapsidatio n of nucleic acid. 12-Envelopment. 13-Release.\n\nProteins represen t th e mai n vira l component . Protein s ar e th e sol e constituent o f capsids, the major componen t of envelopes and also they are associated with the nucleic acids of many viruses as core proteins [7] . Viral proteins have a wide range of molecular weight ranging from 10,000-150,000 daltons. Viral proteins also vary in number, some viruses posses as few as three species while others contains up to 50 protein species. All members o f th e sam e viru s famil y displa y almos t th e sam e highl y characteristic electrophoretic protein patterns [7] .\n\nGlycoproteins: Vira l envelope s usuall y contai n glycopotein s i n th e form o f oligomeric spike s or projections. Th e carbohydrate moietie s of glycoproteins are formed o f oligosaccharide (10-15 monosaccharide units) which are linked to the polypeptide backbone through N-and O-glycosidi c bonds involvin g asparagin e an d serin e o r threonine , respectively . Thei r main component s are : galactos e an d galactosamine , glucos e an d glucoseamine, fucose , mannos e an d siali c aci d whic h alway s occupie s a terminal position [7] .\n\nExample of some viral proteins with specialized functions are : Hemagglutinins: Man y anima l viruse s (e.g. , ortho -an d paramyxoviruses) agglutinate the red blood cells of certain animal species. This mean s tha t thes e re d cell s contai n receptor s fo r certai n surfac e components of viral particles that act as cell attachment proteins which are glycoproteins and known as hemagglutinins. Viral hemagglutinins could be used in their quantitative measurement [7] .\n\nEnzymes: Anima l vira l particle s ofte n contai n enzyme s (Tabl e 1) . These enzymes are virus-specific. I n addition to the enzymes summarize d in Tabl e 1 , viruse s ofte n contai n othe r enzymes . Amon g the m ar e th e enzymes tha t modif y bot h end s o f m-RN A molecule s synthesize d b y their cappin g enzyme s an d poly(A ) polymerases . Protei n kinases , deoxyribonucleases, DNA-dependen t phosphohydrolase s an d topoisomerases are also often present in viruses [7] .\n\nHomeostasis of cell numbers in multicellular organisms is maintained by a balance betwee n cel l proliferatio n an d physiologi c (programmed ) cel l death. Apoptosis is a process by which cells undergo physiologic death in response t o a stimulu s an d i t i s a predictabl e serie s o f morphologicall y defined events . It is divided int o two stages namely, the breakdown of the nucleus an d alteratio n o f th e cel l shap e an d th e plasm a membran e permeability. Th e consequence s o f apoptosi s ar e th e fragmentatio n o f nuclear DNA , the zeiosi s (boiling ) o f the cytoplas m associate d wit h th e blebbing and increased granularity of the plasma membrane and fracturin g of the cel l int o subcellula r DNA-containin g apoptoti c bodies . Apoptosi s process i s different fro m necroti c cell death by involvement o f lysosoma l enzyme leakage into the cytoplasm, the swelling of the cell and the actual rupture of the plasma membrane. Necrosis is often induce d by agents that affect membran e integrity , generalize d protei n synthesis , o r energ y metabolism [9] . Apoptosis ca n b e induced*b y a variet y o f stimuli , e.g. , steroids, cytokines, DNA-damaging agents , growth factor withdrawa l an d in case o f T or B cells, antigen-receptor engagement . Apoptosi s i s also a mechanism b y whic h cytotoxi c lymphocyte s kil l thei r targets . Man y viruses ca n induc e apoptosi s i n infecte d cell s whil e man y othe r viruse s especially transformin g viruses , ca n inhibi t apoptosi s an d allo w fo r cel l transformation. Th e nuclea r change s durin g apoptosi s induc e chromati n [6] .\n\nViruses caus e severa l hundre d infectiou s disease s t o man y plant s afte r successfully penetratin g their cell walls, reducing the yield of a variety o f crops includin g tobacco , potatoes , tomatoes , a s wel l a s man y othe r vegetables, inducin g seriou s economi c damages . Som e insect s tha t fee d plants assis t i n vira l infection . Vira l particle s ma y b e clingin g t o thes e insects' piercing or sucking devices and when these devices penetrate plant cells, infectio n occurs . \n\nMany anima l viruse s infec t human s an d animal s causin g severa l seriou s diseases. Tabl e 2 present s a summar y o f som e anima l viruse s an d th e diseases they induce.\n\nViroids ar e plant pathogen s whic h consis t o f naked strand s o r circle s o f RNA with no protein coat. Viroids are mere snippets of genes smaller than the smalles t know n vira l DN A o r RN A molecul e an d the y ca n hav e damaging effect s o n citrus , avocados , potatoe s an d othe r cro p plants .\n\nApparently, enzyme s alread y presen t i n a hos t cel l synthesiz e viroi d RNA then use this new viroid RNA as a template for building new viroids. Some unidentified infectiou s agents cause some rare fatal diseases of the nervous system including Scrapie in sheep and Kuru and Crutzfeldt-Jaco b (mad cow ) diseas e i n humans . Probabl y thes e disease s ar e cause d b y infectious protei n particles , tentativel y name d prions . Prion s migh t b e synthesized accordin g t o informatio n i n mutate d genes . Researcher s studying scrapie , hav e isolate d th e gen e codin g fo r altere d form s o f a protein in infected cells [6] .\n\nViruses are either measured as infectious units, i.e., in terms of their ability to infect, multipl y an d produce progeny or as viral particles, regardless of their function a s infectious agents [7] .\n\nTitration mean s th e measuremen t o f the amoun t o f viru s i n terms o f th e number of infectious unites per unit volume.\n\nPlaque Formation [7 ] Monolayers of susceptible cells are inoculated with small aliquots of serial dilutions o f th e viru s suspensio n t o be titrated. Wheneve r vira l particle s infect cells, progeny virus particles are produced, released and immediately infect adjoinin g cells . This process i s repeated until after 2-1 2 incubatio n days o r more . Area s o f infecte d cell s develo p plaque s tha t ca n b e see n with a naked eye. Agar is frequently incorporate d i n the medium to ensure that th e liberate d progen y viru s particle s i n th e mediu m d o no t diffus e away an d initiat e separat e o r secondar y plaques . The infecte d cell s mus t differ i n some recognizable manner from non infected ones , i.e., they must be completely destroyed, become detached from the surface o n which they grow o r possess stainin g properties differen t fro m thos e o f normal cells . The mos t commo n metho d t o visualize plaques i s to apply neutra l re d o r crystal violet to the infected cel l monolayers and then counting the number of no n staine d area s [7] . Titer s ar e expresse d i n term s o f numbe r o f plaque-forming unit s (PFU ) pe r milliliter . Ther e i s a linea r relationshi p (linear dose-response curve ) between the amount of virus and the numbe r of plaque s produce d whic h indicate s tha t eac h plaqu e i s produced b y a single vira l particle . Th e viru s progeny i n eac h plaqu e ar e clones . Viru s stocks derived fro m singl e plaques are named \"plaqu e purified \" whic h i s important i n isolatin g pur e viru s strains . Plaqu e formatio n i s th e mos t desirable metho d o f viral titration becaus e i t is economic an d technicall y simple. However, not all viruses can be measured thi s way due to lack of host cells that can develop the desired cytopathic effects (CPE) . \n\nMany anima l viruse s ge t adsorbe d b y red bloo d cell s (RBCs ) o f variou s animal species. Each viral particle is a multivalent, i.e., it can adsorb more than on e cel l a t a time . I n practice , th e maximu m numbe r o f cell s wit h which any particular virus can combine is two since RBCs are bigger than viral particles. In a virus-cell mixture in which the number of cells exceeds the number of viral particles, the small number o f cell dimer that may b e formed i s generally undetectable . If the number o f viral particles exceed s the number of cells, a lattice of agglutinated cells is formed tha t settles out D in a characteristic readily distinguishable manner from th e settling pattern exhibited b y unagglutinate d cell s [7] . Hemagglutinatio n assa y i s th e determination o f the virus that will exactly agglutinate a standard numbe r of RBCs. Because the number of viral particles required fo r this is readily calculated (slightly higher than the number of cells), hemagglutination is a highly accurate and rapid assay.\n\nIn Vitro Antiviral Screening Assays [11, 12] The vira l infectivit y i n culture d cell s i s determine d durin g viru s multiplication i n the presenc e o f a singl e teste d compoun d o r extrac t o r after extracellular incubation. Current Antiviral Chemotherapy [13, 14] Research i n antiviral chemotherapy starte d around early 1950' s when the search fo r anticance r drug s revealed severa l new compounds tha t inhibi t viral DN A synthesis , e.g. , th e pyrimidine analo g idoxuridin e whic h wa s later approve d a s a topica l treatmen t fo r herpe s keratitis . Sinc e then , research effort s wer e focused o n both purine and pyrimidine nucleosid e analogs [13] . With the emergence of AIDS epidemic, research on antiviral generally an d specificall y anti-HI V becam e highes t priority . Man y o f these retrovirus proteins have been purified and characterized for the sake of designing drugs that would selectively inhibit some critical enzymes of HIV such as reverse transcriptase and protease which are required for the final packaging of this virus particle. 1-Zidovudin e (7 ) (previousl y azidothymidine , AZT ) i s a deoxythymidine analo g tha t als o requires anaboli c phosphorylatio n for activation . I t competitivel y inhibit s deoxythymidin e triphosphate fo r th e RT . I t als o act s a s a chai n terminato r i n th e synthesis of pro viral DNA. It is active against HIV-1, HIV-2 and the\n\nhuman T cell lymphotropi c viruses . Resistance to 7 occurs due to mutation in RT gene. Didanosine (8 ) i s a syntheti c analo g o f deoxyadenosine . I t i s anabolically activated to 2,3-dideoxyadenosine-5-triphosphate which inhibits viral replication as 7. Resistance is typically associated with mutation at codon 74.\n\nZalcitabine (9) is a pyrimidine nucleoside that inhibits replication of HIV-1 in a similar mechanism to 7. Mutation at codon 65 induces resistance which is associated with the decrease in susceptibility to 8 and 9. 4-Stavudin e (10) is a thymidine analog that also requires a metabolic activation as that of 7. It is active against HIV-1. 5-Lamivudin e (11) is a nucleoside analog which in vitro inhibits HIV-1 and HBV . It inhibits HIV-RT and shows synergistic effec t wit h 7 against HIV-1 . It requires metabolic phosphorylation a s that of 7.\n\nHigh level of resistance is developed by mutation at codon 184.\n\n1-Indinavi r is a specific inhibitor of HIV-1 protease which is essential for th e production o f mature and infectious virions . It i s currently clinically approved for treatment of HIV-1 infections. 2-Ritonavi r is an inhibitor of HIV protease with high bioavailability. It is metabolized by the hepatic P450 cytochrome oxidase system and hence suffers from several drug interactions. 3-Saquinavi r is a synthetic peptide-like analog that inhibits the activity of HIV-1 protease and prevents the cleavage of viral polyproteins. 3-Ribaviri n [13 ] i s a guanosin e analo g tha t i s intracellularl y phosphorylated b y the host cell's enzymes . Despite its mechanism is not yet fully elucidated , it apparently interferes with the synthesis of guanosin e triphosphat e t o inhibi t cappin g o f vira l mRN A an d some viral RNA-dependent polymerases. Its triphosphate derivative inhibits the replication o f a wide range o f RNA and DNA viruses including influenz a A and B , parainfluenza, respirator y syncytia l virus (RSV), paramyxovirus, HCV and HIV-1.\n\nFour basi c approache s ar e conducte d fo r plan t selectio n fo r antivira l screening assays : 1 -Rando m collectio n o f plant s followe d b y mas s screening. 2-Ethnomedical approach. 3-Literature-based follow up of the existing leads. 4-Chemotaxonomic approac h [12] . The second and third approaches ar e th e mos t favore d one s becaus e o f thei r cost-effectiv e applicability. The selection based on folkloric use proved five times higher percentage o f active leads than other approaches. The random approach usually affords mor e novel compounds with antiviral activity. Combining ethnomedical, phytochemical an d taxonomical approache s is considered the best compromise.\n\nDifferent cel l culture-base d assay s ar e currentl y availabl e an d ca n b e successfully applie d fo r plan t extract s an d pur e compounds . Antivira l agents tha t interfer e wit h on e o r mor e vira l biosyntheti c dynami c processes are good candidates as clinically useful drugs . Virucidal agents that extracellularl y inactivat e viru s infectivit y ar e rathe r candidate s a s antiseptics. Th e ke y factor s tha t determin e th e selectio n o f th e assa y system are : simplicity , accuracy , reproducibility , selectivit y an d specificity [12] . After evaluatio n o f th e antivira l potenc y o f a teste d compound along with its cytotoxicity, the therapeutic index in a given viral system i s calculated. Th e therapeutic inde x i s defined a s a ratio o f the maximum drug concentration at which 50% of the normal cells grovrth is inhibited to the minimum drug concentration at which 50% (sometimes 90 or 99%) of the virus is inhibited. The relative potency of a new antiviral agent should be compared with an existing approved drug.\n\nIn vivo testing of any new in vitro active antiviral agen t i s considered th e key ste p befor e an y huma n clinica l trials . Thi s mode l shoul d predic with an animal's metabolic processes. 4-Provin g tha t the compoun d wil l resist an d will no t adversel y affec t the immune system [12] .\n\nTwo usefu l anima l model s ar e usuall y employed : heterologu s o r homologus. In heterologus systems, a disease is induced by a virus from a n animal origi n i n an experimenta l anima l tha t mimic s th e huma n disease . Several review s hav e bee n publishe d dealin g wit h natura l productsderived antivira l compound s [11, 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Presently, there ar e only tw o plant-derived compounds under clinical development [2] . (-f)-Calanolide A (12) i s a C2 2 coumari n isolate d fro m th e Malaysia n rainfores t tree , Calophyllum langigerum b y th e U.S . National Cance r Institut e [2] .

It als o show s synergisti c anti -HIV activity i n combination with nucleoside RT inhibitors: 7, 8 and 9 [2] . To overcom e th e difficult y o f suppl y o f 12 , its tota l chemica l synthesi s was accomplishe d [2] . I n Jun e 1997 , clinica l developmen t o f 1 2 wa s started as a potential drug for treatment of AIDS.

It is isolated from th e late x o f a Latin America n plan t Croton lechleri [2] , It show s potent in vitro activity against HSV and other varieties of DNA and RNA viruses. Virend, whic h i s the topical formulatio n o f 13 , is evaluated i n phase II clinical trials for the treatment of genital herpes in combination with acyclovir. These trials were later suspended as they proved virend to have no additional benefit over using oral acyclovir alone. Provir, the oral formulation o f SF-SOB, is proved to be safe and well tolerated in phase I trials but ineffective i n phase II for the treatment of RSV since there was no adequate absorption by patients. However, provir was proved effectiv e in symptomati c treatmen t o f traveler' s diarrhe a throug h restoratio n o f normal bowel function and prevention of recurrences [2] . \n\nAlkaloids are heterogeneous group of compounds linked by the common possession o f a basi c nature , containin g on e o r mor e nitroge n atom s usually in combinations part of heterocyclic system [11] , Their precursors are usually amino acids and they exert certain biological activities. Many alkaloids are also foun d i n animals and humans where they coul d exer t a profound pharmacologica l activit y [11] . Tabl e 1 illustrate s variou s alkaloids with activity against many animal viruses. \n\nLycorine (16), Pretazettine (17) ApQrphing;\n\nOliverine (18),\n\nPgnzQphgnanthriding:\n\nChelidonine (21) \n\nSchumannificine (29 ) FlavQiioid: \n\nOpium;\n\nMorphine (34) , Codeine (35), Papaverine (36 ) Phenantl iroquinozolizidine:\n\nCryptopleurine (37 ) Pipgriding;\n\n1-Deoxynojirimycin (38) , l -Deoxymannojirimycin (39) , a-Homonojirimycin (40 ) Protoberberine:\n\nBerberine (41) , Columbamin e 1 (42) , Palmatine (43) Pvrrolizidine:\n\n1 Austra l ine (44 ) Ouinoline/Isoquinoline: Table 4 summarizes the antiviral activity of plant and some non-plant carbohydrates. \n\nChromones, furanocoumarins an d flavonoids ar e common constituent s i n many plan t families . Coumarin s ar e specifically abundan t i n the familie s Rutaceae an d Umbellifera e [11] . The yield coul d sometime s reac h u p t o 1% o f the dr y plant weight . Tabl e 5 illustrates various antivira l activitie s of chromones, coumarins and flavonoids. \n\nLignans ar e widesprea d secondar y metabolite s i n plant kingdom . The y occur in many parts of plants especially wood, resin and bark trees [11] . They are also found i n many roots, leaves, flowers, fruits an d seeds [61] .\n\nThere is an evidence that lignans play a major rol e in plant-plant, plantinsect an d plant-fungu s interaction s [11] . The chemica l structure s o f T e r m i l i g n a n ( 1 0 4 ) , T h a n n i l i g n a n ( 1 0 5 ) , Anolignan (106 ) Justicidin A (107) [89] lignans ar e divers e an d comple x despit e the y ar e essentiall y dimer s o f phenylpropanoid unit s (C6-C3 ) linked by the central carbons of their sid e chains [11] . Presently, there are six lignan subgroups : butane derivatives , lignanolicles (butanolides) , monoepoxylignan s (tetrahydrofura n derivatives), bisepoxylignans (3,7-dioxabicyclo(3.3.0)-octane derivatives) , cyclolignans (tetrahydronaphthalenes ) an d cyclolignan s base d o n naphthalene [11] . Phenolics, benzoquinones , naphthoquinones , anthraquinones and phenylpropanoids ar e abundant secondary metabolite s in plants. Table 6 illustrates the reported antivira l activitie s of these plan t secondary metabolites. \n\nTannins ar e phenoli c compound s tha t ar e abundan t i n plan t kingdom . Basically, ther e ar e tw o type s o f tannins . Hydrolysabl e typ e whic h usually consists of simple phenolic acids, e.g., gallic acid, which is linked to sugar .
