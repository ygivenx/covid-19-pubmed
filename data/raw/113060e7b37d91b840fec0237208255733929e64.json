{"title": "Traditional Use, Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Quality Control of Species in Genus Bupleurum L", "body": "The plants of genus Bupleurum L., including approximately 200 species in the world, are mainly located in Northern Hemisphere, Eurasia, and North Africa (Su et al, 1998) . Among them, 26 species and six varieties could be the botanical resources of Bupleuri Radix in China (Pan, 2006) , though only B. chinense DC. and B. scorzonerifolium Willd. were authenticated species in Pharmacopoeia of People's Republic of China (Pharmacopoeia Committee of P. R. China, 2010) .\n\nBupleuri Radix, a traditional Chinese herb used as febrifuge, is a common ingredient in the prescriptions of Chinese materia medica (CMM) for the treatment of fever, flu, distending pain in the chest, and menstrual disorder (Ikegami et al, 2006) . For example, Xiaochaihu Decoction, Dachaihu Decoction, Xiaoyao Pill, Chaihushugan Powder, Chaihuguizhi Decocton, and Buzhongyiqi Decoction are all famous prescriptions with certain therapeutic effects (Pan, 2006) . Recent studies have indicated that Bupleuri Radix has the bioactivities of antivirus, anti-ulcer, antitumor, immunoregulation, proliferation, antidepressive, and hepatoprotective effects (Cheng et al, 2006; Matsumoto et al, 2002; Su et al, 2002; Wang et al, 2009; Cho et al, 2010; Zhao et al, 2010; Guo et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2006) . In addition, the extract of Bupleuri Radix has a significant bioactivity of anti-influenza A H1N1 in vitro (Su et al, 2011) . However, there are also some potent toxicities in it, as a result, a great attention has been paid for the quality control in the good practice in traditional Chinese medicine (GP-TCM) research (Uzuner et al, 2012) . In this paper, the species of Bupleurum L. in phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological studies, and the quality control studies are reviewed.\n\nThe species in Bupleurum L., first recorded in Shen Nong's Herbal Classic 2000 years ago, are widely used in the ancient folk medicine. Traditional medicinal formulae containing Bupleuri Radix displayed the excellent therapeutic effects on some common diseases, so they were largely propagated for pharmaceutical demand. According to a survey on the frequency and pattern of CMM prescriptions for chronic hepatitis in Taiwan, Longdan Xiegan Decoction, a famous prescription containing Bupleuri Radix, was demonstrated to be the most popular prescription among the 91 080 subjects treated by CMM for chronic hepatitis .\n\nMany prescriptions including Bupleuri Radix are very effective, and some of them have been widely used with some new applications so far. Indeed, there are about 60 formulae including Bupleuri Radix in Pharmacopoeia of People's Republic of China 2010. Accordingly, it is a good source of CMM for the treatment of fever, flu, inflammatory reaction, infectious diseases, amenorrhea, deafness, dizziness, vomiting, dry throat, diabetes mellitus, etc.\n\nPrincipal saikosaponins and their bioactivities Saikosaponins are the major secondary metabolites in the species of Bupleurum L., amounting to approximately 1% to 2% of the total dry weight of roots, and in some species they reached 7% (Lin et al, 2004) . More than 120 glycosylated oleanane-type and ursanetype saponins have already been isolated from the species in Bupleurum L. (Ashour and Wink, 2011) , of which saikosaponin-A, -C, and -D are the most active saikosaponins. They are demonstrated to have exact pharmacological activities.\n\nDue to the high content and potent pharmacological activities, saikosaponin-A was considered as a marker for the quantity control of Bupleuri Radix (Zhu et al, 2006; Liau et al, 2007) . It is demonstrated that saikosaponin-A possessed numerous pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammation, antiallergy, anti-oxidation, anticonvulsion, accelerated apoptosis, etc.\n\nSaikosaponin-A potently suppressed concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 production in T cells of mice. It significantly inhibited the proliferation and activation of T cells activated by Con A in a concentration-dependent manner. It also caused G 0 /G 1 arrest of the activated T cells through down-regulating the protein levels of CDK6 and cyclin D3 and up-regulating the protein level of p27 kip (Sun et al, 2009) . Saikosaponin-A also inhibited the passive allergic skin reactions in rats and suppressed the asthmatic bronchoconstriction in sensitized guinea pigs (Park et al, 2002) . These results have confirmed that saikosaponin-A had the immunosuppressive activity.\n\nSaikosaponin-A had a significant antitumor effect. It could sensitize the cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis through ROS accumulation, which may be attributed to the combination of saikosaponins and cisplatin. It was found to be an effective therapeutic strategy (Wang et al, 2010a) . Chen et al (2003) have reported the apoptotic mechanism was induced by saikosaponin-A in human breast MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells. According to Chen et al (2003) , saikosaponin-A could cause an obvious increase in the sub-G1 population of cell cycles.\n\nSaikosaponin-A was also a potential anti-oxidant in biological body. It was investigated that the supplementation with saikosaponin-A significantly decreased the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma of rats with CCl 4 -induced liver injury (Wu et al, 2008) . As a result, the supplementation with saikosaponin-A could impair hepatic lipids and lipid peroxidation; it also could enhance the anti-oxidant defense to protect the liver injury induced by CCl 4 , but more clinical trials are needed in order to develop saikosaponin-A into an anti-oxidant.\n\nSaikosaponin-D is similar to saikosaponin-A in chemical structure, so is in pharmacological activities. It was reported that saikosaponin-D potently suppressed the expression of T cells in mice and inhibited the propylene glycol monomethyl acetate and ionomycin-stimulated IL-2 production in T cells of mice (Leung et al, 2005) . The saikosaponin-D could inhibit the activation of T cell similar to saikosaponin-A, however, they were different in the inhibitory mechanisms. Hsu, Kuo, and Liu (2004) reported that the proapoptotic effect of saikosaponin-D had been discovered in two liver cancer cell lines, Hep G2 and 3B. It has been proved that saikosaponin-D could prevent the progression of the cell cycle at G 1 phase, and inhibit the cell survival signaling. Therefore saikosaponin-D decreased the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. It could also inhibit the cell growth of human lung cancer cell line A549 by inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle progression in G 1 phase (Hsu et al, 2004) . These results may verify the antitumor activity of saikosaponin-D.\n\nAn in vitro test showed that saikosaponin-D acted as a weak phytoestrogen. It has a proliferationstimulating effect on MCF-7 cells, and the effect is associated with a marked increase in the number of MCF-7 cells in S phase. Besides, it could activate the estrogen responsive elements luciferase activity, and the estrogenic effect was mediated through the estrogen receptors (Wang et al, 2010b) .\n\nSaikosaponin-D was also a potent macrophage activator. It significantly activated the peritoneal macrophages in terms of the enhancement of the phagocytosis, increased the level of acid phosphatase, induced the activity of suppressing the cell growth, and promoted the expression of immune-associated antigen on the cell surface. The activities of saikosaponin-D were found to be much stronger than those of typical saponins ginsenoside Rg 1 and glycyrrhizin (Kumazawa et al, 1989) . Saikosaponin-D was also provided with a potent cytotoxicity, and it seemed that the activity might be beneficial to cure some diseases (Chiang et al, 2003) . Furthermore, saikosaponin-D possessed a significant hepatoprotective effect, and this might be associated with its anti-lipid peroxidation activity.\n\nSaikosaponin-C contains a glycon different to other saikosaponins, which is a trisaccharide of glucoseglucose-rhamnose and may lead to some different pharmacological activities. Researchers have compared the inhibitory effects of saikosaponin-A, -C, and -D on the nephrotoxic serum nephritis of mice, and the results indicated that saikosaponin-C almost completely controlled the development of nephritis, while others had lower activity . The superior efficacy endues saikosaponin-C with great developing value. Saikosaponin-C also has been shown to possess cytotoxicity, which might play a role in inhibiting HBV-DNA replication (Chiang et al, 2003) . Moreover, saikosaponin-C possessed an ability of stimulating cell proliferation, and it has been proved that saikosaponin-C could induce the growth and migration of endothelial cells, as well as the formation of capillary tube (Shyu et al, 2004) .\n\nThere are also some other saikosaponins that have been isolated and found to have inhibitory effect on Na + , K + -ATPase, especially for saikosaponin-B1, B2, and B4 (Zhou et al, 1996) . In addition, there are also some saponins which are not exclusive to the species of Bupleurum L., such as buddleja saponin IV and malonyl buddleja saponin IV, two saponins isolated from the species of Bupleurum L., were proved to possess hepatoprotective effects too (Guinea et al, 1994) . Total saponin is suggested to be an important source of drugs, because individual saponin may have diverse bioactivities. As a result, saponins from the species of Bupleurum L. may be developed to treat some diseases effectively.\n\nPrincipal polysaccharose and their bioactivities Numerous polysaccharides isolated from plants have been proven to possess a wide range of biological functions with weak side effects, and some of them have already been applied in clinic. There have been many kinds of polysaccharides with the diverse bioactivities obtained from the species of Bupleurum L.\n\nCrude polysaccharides extracted from Bupleuri Radix could enhance phagocytic activities and inhibit the productions of proinflammatory mediators induced by lipopolysaccharide (Cheng et al, 2010) . Wang et al (2009) has certified the immunoregulation effects of crude polysaccharides of Bupleuri Radix, it enhanced the phagocytic functions of macrophages, and inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced productions of NO and proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, crude polysaccharides was benefit to the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus which was induced by CJ-S131 in BALB/c mice (Wang et al, 2009 ); these pharmacological activities might be associated with the curative effect of Bupleurum polysaccharides (BP) on autoimmune disease.\n\nD3-S1, a kind of polysaccharide isolated from hot water extract of the roots of B. smithii, with an average molecular weight of 2000, has been proven to have an anti-complement activity and a strong inhibitory effect on laking (Xu et al, 2007) . D3-S1 with more potent bioactivities than heparin, provided an initial approach by using natural products to develop the drugs that directly targeted to the complement components (Xu et al, 2007) .\n\nBCPS-1, a pure polysaccharide fraction isolated from B. chinense, with an average molecular weight of about 29 000, has a significant anti-oxidative activity (Sun et al, 2010) . According to studies, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of BCPS-1 reached 76.5% at 8 mg/mL (Sun et al, 2010) , suggesting that BCPS-1 could be potentially used as a natural anti-oxidant.\n\nBP III is mainly composed of arabinose and galactose with an average molecular weight of 8100 (Xiao et al, 2005) ; it had a radio protective effect on rats (Luo et al, 1995) . It was reported that BP III increased the survival rate of mice under 8.5 Gyirradiated by 45%, and it also had a good defending effect on some indexes such as spleen weight, DNA contents of bone marrow, hematopoietic cell colony, and so on (Luo et al, 1995) .\n\nThere are abundant pectic polysaccharides isolated from Bupleuri Radix, some of which have remarkable biological activities. Bupleuran 2IIb, with a molecular weight of 23 000 containing 75.5% uronic acid, has a potent in complement-activating activity and an immune complex clearance-enhancing activity, and the activities are attributed to its neutral carbohydrate chains (Yamada et al, 1989; Matsumoto et al, 1993) . Bupleuran 2IIc, with a molecular weight of 63 000, containing 93.6% galacturonic acid, was an anti-ulcer pectin, which could stimulate lymphocytes and deplete adherent cells or T cells. In addition, it showed a potent mitogenic activity and B-cell proliferation activity (Yamada et al, 1989; Yamada, 1994; Sakurai et al, 1999) .\n\nResearchers (Yang et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 1989 ) have reported that the crude polysaccharide from Bupleuri Radix had a radio protective effect on rats under 8.2 Gy-irradiated, especially for the protective effect on hematopoietic function. Moreover, it could improve immunity in rat and recover the immunosuppression. Recently, the structure-activity relationships of polysaccharides have also been studied. For instance, the anti-oxidation of SPB 0 , a crude polysaccharide extracted by ultrasound-assisted method, is stronger than that of the crude polysaccharide extracted by hot water. SPB 0 may attribute to ultrasonic degradation which diminished the linear scale of the polysaccharide molecular and the polysaccharides of smaller molecular have a stronger free radical scavenging activity (Li et al, 2009a) . Another study (Li et al, 2009b) has demonstrated the aggregations of an acidic polysaccharide from the species of Bupleurum L. in different conditions, indicating that we could control the conformation of polysaccharides by adjusting their extraction conditions, in order to regulate their bioactivities.\n\nAs a group of the dominant constituents from the species of Bupleurum L., the volatile oil is found to be a source of febrifuges and antiphlogistics. Moreover, it has also been developed into cosmetic uses (Pelletier et al, 2012) . So far, more than 200 constituents have been identified in more than 20 species (Pan, 2006) . In view of their efficient pharmacological activities, volatile oils have been the main ingredient in the injection and dripping pills with the species of Bupleuri L., which are commonly used in modern medicine. To make a better use of volatile oils, the extraction method for volatile oils has been optimized (Li et al, 2004) , and the fingerprint profile of volatile oil has been established Ni et al, 2009) .\n\nAnti-inflammatory activity of the volatile oils extracted from the species of Bupleurum L. have been determined in many experiments. \u03b1-Pinene and \u03b2pinene are considered to be the major components which could inhibit the inflammation caused by cotton wool (Lorente et al, 1989) . \u03b1-Pinene and \u03b2-caryophyllene are recognized as the key anti-inflammatory components, which are effective to the carrageenin-induced hind paw edema in adrenal ectomized rats; and \u0394-3-carene was proved to have a similar function (Martin et al, 1993; Ocete et al, 1989; Gil et al, 1989) ; assessed for the inhibition of both prostaglandin E(2) production and lipoxygenase, researchers have found that the volatile oils also showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity. According to the assessing study, the IC 50 value was 63.64 \u03bcg/mL for lipoxygenase, and the inhibitory rate of prostaglandin E(2) at the dose of 25 \u03bcg/mL was 26.04% (Ashour et al, 2009 ). The results above revealed that there were many compounds in the volatile oils which could act as available antiinflammatory agent.\n\nThe volatile oils exhibited a moderate antimicrobial activity, which showed a significant in vitro antimicrobial activity against the two kinds of Gram positive pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.125 to 4.000 mg/mL; it also had an effect on four bacterial species, and the inhibitory zones and MIC for the bacterial strains were in the range of 7.0-18.0 mm and 250-500 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Ashour et al, 2009; Shi et al, 2010) . Its antimicrobial activity was limited, and could be an effective way for broadening its antibiogram if combinating with other drugs. The fungicidal activity of the volatile oils was also studied. The volatile oil at the concentration of 5.0 mL/L could inhibit the sporulation of Plasmopara halstedii, a parasite fungus species in sunflower seedlings. It seemed that the volatile oils could activate the defense response of sunflower seedlings against the pathogen invasion. Besides, the volatile oils showed a variability of inhibition among 14 fungal species (Fern\u00e1ndez-Oca\u00f1a et al, 2004; Maxia et al, 2011) .\n\nThe volatile oils also showed an anti-oxidative activity, as evidenced by the low IC 50 value of 566.2 \u03bcg/mL for DPPH radical and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (induced by FeSO 4 , H 2 O 2 , and CCl 4 ) with IC 50 values of 275.2, 296.9, and 118.7 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Previous studies (Shi et al, 2010; Ashour et al, 2009) showed that the IC 50 values for DPPH and deoxyribose were 3.66 mg/mL and 17.4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The sedation effect of the volatile oils was verified, as it exhibited an antispasmodic activity in rat uterine contractions which was caused by oxytocin (Ocete et al, 1989; Lorente et al, 1989) .\n\nThe essential oils possessed a strong cytotoxicity against many cancer cells. The MTT assay showed that the IC 50 value of 46.01 \u03bcg/mL indicated the highest activity in the CCRF-CEM cell line after 24 h treatment (Ashour et al, 2009 ). Furthermore, the fatty acid compositions of some species have the relatively high contents of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic, linoleic, and \u03b1-linolenic acids, thus the oils from the species of Bupleurum L. could be considered as a good source of unsaturated fatty acids in food and oil industry (Saracoglu et al, 2012) .\n\nThe statistic data showed that more than 20 flavonoids have been isolated from some species of Bupleurum L., most of which were glycoside, including three categories by their aglycones (quercetin series, kaempferol series, and isorhamnetin series) (Zhang et al, 2007; Pan et al, 2002) . Pharmacological studies (Feng et al, 2002) demonstrated that the flavonoids in the species of Bupleurum L. had the inhibitory effects on influenza virus. The total flavonoids from the aerial part of B. chinense (TFB) could significantly relieve the lung pathological processes of the infected mice. In addition, eugenin and saikochromone potently inhibited the CD28-costimulated activation of human peripheral blood T cells . Moreover, flavonoids in oral S/B remedy (containing Scutellaria baicalensis and B. scorzonerifolfium) were recognized to be therapeutically useful in the treatment of central nervous system neurodegenerative diseases (Lin et al, 2011) .\n\nThe species of Bupleurum L. have the plenty of phenols with a free radical scavenging activity and an anti-oxidative capacity. Song et al (2010) reported that there was a high positive correlation between antioxidative capacities and total phenolic components. Many other components have also been isolated from the species of Bupleurum L., such as lignins and coumarins, some of which were reported to possess the varieties of bioactivities. The presence of these components has greatly enriched the chemical composition diversity of the species in Bupleurum L. On the other hand, there will be more requirements to develop the natural source, especially for its quality control.\n\nThere are many beneficial contents in the species of Bupleurum L., but their toxicities are inevitable. For example, Xiaochaihu Decoction, a herbal formulae containing Bupleuri Radix, has been demonstrated to have subacute toxicity (Shin et al, 2012) . The single oral dose toxicity of aqueous extracts from Bupleuri Radix has also been demonstrated in healthy mice (Kim et al, 2012) . Saikosaponins and the volatile oil, the main effective components, are recognized to have both acute toxicity and chronic toxicity; some poisonous contents are also isolated from only a few species.\n\nSaikosaponins are demonstrated to be the major chemical components responsible for hepatoprotective effect, according to the clinical applications and modern studies. Their intensive hepatotoxicities were mainly related to the multi-channel oxidative injury. As reported, saikosaponins could induce the chronic toxicity in rats, and the mainly target organ was liver (Huang, Zhao, and Sun, 2011) . Rats could be decreased in weight after saikosaponins treatment in which abnormal liver function and hepatic damage occurred. These lesions gradually aggravated with dose increasing (Liu et al, 2012; Huang, Liu, and Sun, 2011) . It was also reported that the administration of saikosaponins for a long time or at a high dose may cause serious liver injury or even death in rats, and there are certain timeand dose-toxicity relationships in cumulative toxicity of saiko saponins to rats. Further-more, total saponins extract in the species of Bupleurum L. exhibited a potent acute toxicity on rats with a LD 50 value of 2255.6 mg/(kg\u00b7d). Saikosaponins could lead to some acute toxicity symptoms, such as negligent action, abdominal lying sleeping, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and so on (Huang and Sun, 2010) . It has been widely recognized that the hemolytic activity of saikosaponin-D is caused by its complex with cholesterol on erythrocyte membrane, leading to membrane disruption and cell lysis, which could be decreased by liposomes (Ding et al, 2005) .\n\nA recent study (Sun and Yang, 2011a) showed that the volatile oils from B. chinense could induce the chronic hepatotoxicity and hepatotoxical injury in rats along with some abnormal changes in the activity of serum ALT, AST, and some other hepatic indexes. The dosage-time-toxicity relationship has been clarified. The volatile oils from B. chinense also possessed an acute toxicity to rats and mice, inducing restlessness, accelerated heart rate, abnormal walking, breathlessness, and consecutive convulsion, and the LD 50 values of the volatile oils were 2.081 and 3.118 mL/kg, respectively . The mechanism of the volatile oil for hepatotoxic injury was revealed that the volatile oils could suppress the respiratory control rate, phosphorus/ oxygen rate, respiratory oxygen uptake, contents of ATP, and activities of ATPases, while increase the activity of iNOS and the contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and NO both in serum and liver could increase. As a result, they caused the hepatotoxicity in rats by inhibiting function of hepatic mitochondrion and influence the energy metabolism of the liver (Sun and Yang, 2011b; Yang and Sun, 2011) .\n\nPolyacetylenes are the poisonous components of some species in Bupleurum L., such as B. longiradiatum Turcz., B. angustissimum (Franch.) Kitagawa, B. smithii var. parvifolium, and B. bicaule Helm. Recently, many polyacetylenes have been isolated, and an HPLC-DAD-MS method has been developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of polyacetylenes in the species of Bupleurum L. It was revealed that polyacetylenes were only accumulated in the species above, so they were considered to be poisonous species (Huang et al, 2009; . The bioassay tests showed that (2Z,8E,10E)-14S-hydroxy-heptadecatriene-4,6-diyn-1-yl acetate and mTPA esters of bupleurotoxin were cytotoxic compounds with IC 50 values of 9.4 and 4.9 \u00b5mol/L, respectively, and they also possessed a cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines (Huang et al, 2009 ). Acetylbupleurotoxin and upleurotoxin are found to completely inhibit the tube-like formation of human umbilical venous endothelial cells, but they do not exhibit the antitumor activity on BDF1 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma cells (You et al, 2002) .\n\nRecently, an aryltetraline lactone lignan has found to exhibit the cytotoxic activity with IC 50 values of 12.14 and 16.90 mmol/L after 24 h treatment for HepG2 and HeLa cells, respectively (Ashour et al, 2012) .\n\nBecause of the complex constituents in Bupleuri Radix, it is necessary to study the quality control and quantitative analysis of the active components in it.\n\nRecently, its quality evaluating technologies and strategies have been widely studied, and we have made a summary on them as follows.\n\nDue to its various pharmacological properties, saikosaponins have been regarded as the important quality indexes, and based on their content property, the quality profiles have been established by different methods. HPLC was a commonly used analysis technique, by which Li et al (2005) analyzed 17 samples of different species of Bupleuri Radix from various habitats. With an optimized condition, saikosaponin-A and -D are converted into saikosaponin-B1 and -B2 completely and quantitatively before being analyzed by HPLC. This method could be used as a routine analytical one for the quantitative analysis of saikosaponin-A and -D in Bupleuri Radix, which are the detecting indexes in Pharmacopoeia of People's Republic of China 2010. High performance capillary zone electrophoresis (HPCE) is also a powerful technique to study the compounds in the complex extracts, and a fast HPCE method has been developed for the determination and separation of saikosaponin-A, -C, and -D in the extracts of B. chinense from different areas (Lin et al, 2005) . A rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with evaporative light scattering detection method (RRLC-ELSD), demonstrated to be highly effective for the quality evaluation of the species in Bupleurum L., has been developed for the simultaneous determination of six major saikosaponins (Huang et al, 2009 ). LC-MS allows a comprehensive analysis of the saikosaponins in the species of Bupleurum L. and will be helpful for the quality control of the crude materials and their related formulations (Huang et al, 2008) . Combined with accelerated solvent extraction, a rapid-resolution LC-MS method for the efficient extraction, rapid separation, online identification, and accurate determination of the saikosaponins has been developed because it was rapid, efficient, accurate, and suitable for the quality control of Bupleuri Radix . Saikosaponins were also regarded as the target markers of some traditional medicinal formulations containing Bupleuri Radix, the analysis of saikosaponin-A and -C could be obtained readily by the use of LC/ESI/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (Liau et al, 2007) . Immunoassay has been used in the semiquantitative analysis of saikosaponins. The Eastern blotting technique for the analysis of saikosaponins has been reported to be a simple method for the quality control of Bupleuri Radix and some formulas with it (Zhu et al, 2007) .\n\nFlavonoids have been regarded as the referential indexes to evaluate the quality of Bupleuri Radix due to numerous biological activities, characteristic category and contents. With HPLC-UV for the simultaneous determination of flavonoids, Zhang et al (2010) have established a quantitative method to investigate the contents and the distribution of flavonoids in the different species of Bupleurum L., which was useful for the reliable identification of 12 compounds. The establishments of HPLC and RP-HPLC fingerprints have provided a scientific basis for the development of the comprehensive utilization and the quality control of Bupleuri Radix (Li et al, 2009; Yue et al, 2010) .\n\nThe volatile oil is another group of characteristic component in the species of Bupleurum L. The GC-MS analysis showed that n-hexadecanoic acid could be detected in all samples, indicating that it might be the feature chemical component of the volatile oils from the species of Bupleurum L. The volatile oil showed the various inhibitory bioactivities against the fungi tested (Xie et al, 2008; Maxia et al, 2011) .\n\nMulti-component analysis methods together with the fingerprints are considered to be useful tools for the quality control of herbs. An efficient method has been established to evaluate the efficacy of Bupleuri Radix by integrating the principal component analysis with the canonical correlation analysis based on UV spectral fingerprint, and HPLC-ELSD and HPTLC analyses could be considered the complementary measure of the quality control (Ni et al, 2009; Tian et al, 2009) .\n\nThe present studies have mainly concentrated on the phytochemical and pharmacological aspects of the species in Bupleurum L. Accordingly, the species in Bupleurum L. are rich in triterpenoid-saponins (the so-called saikosaponins), flavonoids, volatile oils, and polysaccharides. In addition, there are some bioactive constituents of lower contents isolated from the species of Bupleurum L., such as lignins and coumarins, and they contribute to phytochemical diversity of the species in Bupleurum L.\n\nThe diverse pharmacological activities should attribute to the abundant chemical constituents in the species of Bupleurum L.\n\nAccording to the studies, it is clear that the further development for the species of Bupleurum L. has a broad prospect. Bupleuri Radix is a famous febrifuge in traditional use, also known for the good curative effect on pain and inflammation associated with flu and common cold. Recently, it has been proven to be effective to depression, influenza A H1N1, and it also has the hepatoprotective and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it is a potential immunomodulator, antineoplastic, anti-oxidant, and so on.\n\nAt the same time, some active constituents (e.g. saikosaponins and the volatile oils) are demonstrated to have some side effects; many components in Bupleuri Radix have both acute and chronic toxicities. Therefore, to control the use dosage and time in a proper extent is vital for ensuring the safety medication of Bupleuri Radix.\n\nQuality control is thought to be vital for ensuring the safety and efficacy medication of Bupleuri Radix. And a comprehensive quality evaluation system is necessary, which should contain the safety assessment and efficiency evaluation. Specifically, the first step is to regularize the germplasm, thus to eliminate the toxic and the inferior species; then is to detect the contents and toxicity of the toxic components, such as pesticide residues and toxic secondary metabolites (e.g. polyacetylenes), which could be determined by chemical analysis and bioassay approach; finally, multicomponent analysis methods are regarded to be reliable for the assessment of the effective components, and combined with the advanced analytical techniques, such as HPLC-MS, GC-MS, and FT-IR, which will play a potent role in the efficiency evaluation of Bupleuri Radix.\n\nAll in all, the species in Bupleurum L. are potential natural medicine resources with a variety of bioactive constituents and abundant pharmacological activities. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive quality evaluation system to ensure the safety and efficiency. It is strongly believed that the application of the species of Bupleurum L. has a broad prospect. "}
