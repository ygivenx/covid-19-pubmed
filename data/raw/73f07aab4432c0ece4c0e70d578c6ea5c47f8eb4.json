{"title": "Commentary Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China", "body": "A novel coronavirus (CoV) named ''2019 novel coronavirus'' or ''2019-nCoV'' by the World Health Organization (WHO) is responsible for the recent pneumonia outbreak that started in early December, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . This outbreak is associated with a large seafood and animal market, and investigations are ongoing to determine the origins of the infection. To date, thousands of human infections have been confirmed in China along with many exported cases across the globe (China CDC, 2020) .\n\nCoronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are genetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Li, 2016) . The former two genera primarily infect mammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds (Tang et al., 2015) . Six kinds of human CoVs have been previously identified. These include HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, which belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which belong to the Beta-coronavirus genus (Tang et al., 2015) . Coronaviruses did not attract worldwide attention until the 2003 SARS pandemic, followed by the 2012 MERS and, most recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreaks (China CDC, 2020; Song et al., 2019) . SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are considered highly pathogenic (Cui et al., 2019) , and it is very likely that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from bats to palm civets (Guan et al., 2003) or dromedary camels (Drosten et al., 2014) , and finally to humans (Cui et al., 2019) .\n\nThe genome of coronaviruses, whose size ranges between approximately 26,000 and 32,000 bases, includes a variable number (from 6 to 11) of open reading frames (ORFs) . The first ORF representing approximately 67% of the entire genome encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), while the remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins and structural proteins (Cui et al., 2019) . The four major structural proteins are the spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). The spike surface glycoprotein plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell and determines host tropism (Li, 2016; Zhu et al., 2018) . The spike proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV bind to different host receptors via different receptor-binding domains (RBDs). SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as one of the main receptors (Ge et al., 2013) with CD209L as an alternative receptor (Jeffers et al., 2004) , whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the primary receptor. Initial analysis suggested that 2019-nCoV has a close evolutionary association with the SARSlike bat coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020) . Here, based on the first three determined genomes of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), namely Wuhan/ IVDC-HB-01/2019 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402119) (HB01), Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2019 (EPI_ISL_402120) (HB04), and Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019 (EPI_ ISL_402121) (HB05), an in-depth genome annotation of this virus was performed with a comparison to related coronaviruses, including 1,008 human SARS-CoV, 338 bat SARS-like CoV, and 3,131 human MERS-CoV, whose genomes were published before January 12, 2020 (release date: September 12, 2019) from Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (http://www.viprbrc. org/) and NCBI.\n\nComparison of genomes of these three strains showed that they are almost Cell Host & Microbe 27, March 11, 2020 \u00aa 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. 1 identical, with only five nucleotide differences in the genome of~29.8 kb nucleotides ( Figure S1 ). The 2019-nCoV genome was annotated to possess 14 ORFs encoding 27 proteins ( Figure 1A and Tables S1A and S1B). The orf1ab and orf1a genes located at the 5 0 -terminus of the genome respectively encode the pp1ab and pp1a proteins, respectively. They together comprise 15 nsps including nsp1 to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16 ( Figure 1A and Table S1B ). The 3 0 -terminus of the genome contains four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) and eight accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and orf14). At the amino acid level, the 2019-nCoV is quite similar to that of SARS-CoV, but there are some notable differences. For example, the 8a protein is present in SARS-CoV and absent in 2019-nCoV; the 8b protein is 84 amino acids in SARS-CoV, but longer in 2019-nCoV, with 121 amino acids; the 3b protein is 154 amino acids in SARS-CoV, but shorter in 2019-nCoV, with only 22 amino acids (Table S1A ). Further studies are needed to characterize how these differences affect the functionality and pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV.\n\nAs shown in a phylogenetic tree based on whole genomes ( Figures 1B and S2 \n\nCommentary of 2019-nCoV has the highest similarity with that of a SARS-like bat CoV (MG772933). In comparison, 2019-nCoV is distant from and less related to the MERS-CoVs. In terms of the encoded proteins of pp1ab, pp1a, envelope, ma-trix, accessory protein 7a, and nucleocapsid genes, phylogenetic analyses showed that the 2019-nCoV is closest to the SARS-like bat CoVs ( Figure 1C and Table S1D ). Regarding the spike gene, the 2019-nCoV is closest to the bat CoVs, while the 3a and 8b accessory genes are both closest to the SARS-CoVs. Although phylogenetic analyses for the whole genome and individual genes clearly show that the 2019-nCoV is most closely related to SARS-like bat T   V   211  224  259  267  272  280  283  293  294  316  324  337  350  354  368  374  386  390  417  442  449  456  531  535  539  553  559  594  595  601  605  608  635  645  649  652  655   661  666  685  687  696  701  710  711  712  722  724  726  727  728  745  748  753  764  776  798  806  807  808 I   827  838  849  880  888  893  902  945  965  975  1027  1042  1057  1064  1081  1104  1124  1178  1218  1271  1274   1295  1296  1298  1339  1345  1355  1394  1399  1420  1444  1512  1522  1525  1537  1553  1619  1623  1662  1677  1679  1682  1692  1706  1718  1734  1736  1742  1744  1758  1779  1791  1795  1813  1817  1822  1825  1837  1856  1863  1889  2105  2137  2142  2156 50  112  271  348  354  417  438  430  519  560  570  572  575  619  646  689  693  719  726  872  875  879  882  884  1070  1133 Table S1E ). An amino acid substitution was defined as an absolutely conserved site in the group of SARS and SARS-like CoVs but different from that of 2019-nCoV. In total, 380 amino acid substitutions have been identified between the amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV (HB01) and the corresponding consensus sequences of SARS and SARS-like CoVs."}
