Therefore, induction of SG requires 204 actively replicating virus and is not a response by the cell to the presence of the virus particle.\n\nAs IBV replication did not induce SG in every infected cell, it was hypothesised that IBV may 208 be able to inhibit formation of canonical SG. To test this, cells were infected with IBV for 24 209 hours and prior to fixation, cells were treated with sodium arsenite for 1 hour or hydrogen The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Viral genomic RNA was found to be located in foci within 297 the cytoplasm. In addition, G3BP1 puncta were detected in a percentage of infected cells, as 298 seen before. However, no co-localization was observed between viral genomic RNA and 299 G3BP1 containing SG. Therefore, IBV genomic RNA is not targeted to SG.
