{"title": "Cattle engineered to produce human antibodies against coronavirus", "body": "Passive immunotherapy \u2014 for example, using specific antibodies \u2014 may represent a good possible treatment strategy against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, producing large-enough quantities of such antibodies is economically and logistically challenging. In a new study, Luke et al. use transchromosomic (Tc) bovines to produce human anti-MERS-CoV antibodies that show efficacy in vitro and in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection.\n\nThe authors used cattle that lack bovine immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and instead carry a human artificial chromosome bearing the genes encoding human Ig heavy chain and \u03ba-light chain proteins, with a bias for producing IgG1 subclass antibodies. Following vaccination, these animals can each produce 150\u2013600 g of human polyclonal IgG antibodies per month.\n\nNext, the authors created two different MERS-CoV vaccines: a whole-killed Jordan strain virion vaccine (WKVV) and an Al-Hasa strain spike protein nanoparticle vaccine (SPNV). Tc bovines were vaccinated every 21\u201328 days on five occasions (V1\u2013V5) with WKVV or SPNV. Two human polyclonal IgG products \u2014 named SAB-300 or SAB-301, respectively \u2014 were purified from the hyperimmune plasma collected from the animals after V2, V3, V4 and V5. In vitro, pre-treatment of Jordan strain MERS-CoV with SAB-300 or SAB-301 before culturing with Vero E6 kidney epithelial cells markedly reduced virus-induced cytopathy, implying that these antibodies neutralize MERS-CoV.\n\nAntibody-dependent enhancement of infection \u2014 whereby antibodies facilitate the entry of viruses into cells that do not carry the usual entry receptor for the virus \u2014 has been suggested to occur following the use of some anti-CoV vaccines. Here, the authors treated Jordan strain MERS-CoV with SAB-300 or SAB-301 before incubating the virus with Raji cells \u2014 human B cells that lack dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; the MERS-CoV entry receptor) and that therefore are not permissive to MERS-CoV. Levels of MERS-CoV-specific RNA transcripts in the Raji cells 48 hours later were not increased by pre-treatment with either SAB-300 or SAB-301, implying that these treatments do not facilitate virus entry into these cells.\n\nviral titers in the lung of SAB-301-treated mice, but not of controls, were below the limit of detection\n\nAlthough mice do not typically express DPP4 and so are resistant to MERS-CoV infection, transduction of mice with a human DPP4-expressing adenovirus (Ad-hDPP4 mice) confers susceptibility. The authors intraperitoneally injected Ad-hDPP4 mice with SAB-301 or a control human IgG and, 12 hours later, intranasally infected them with MERS-CoV. By day 5 post-infection, viral titers in the lung of SAB-301-treated mice, but not of controls, were below the limit of detection. SAB-301 treatment of Ad-hDPP4 mice 24 hours after MERS-CoV exposure also reduced lung viral titers 5 days later to below the limit of detection. Thus, a single treatment of SAB-301 can be effective either prophylactically or after exposure to MERS-CoV.\n\nThis study demonstrates how large quantities of human MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies can be rapidly produced in Tc bovines, thus providing a possible strategy for the development of passive immunotherapies against coronaviruses or other new and emerging infectious diseases."}
