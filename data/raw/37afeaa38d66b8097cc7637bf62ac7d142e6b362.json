{"title": "Evolutionary origins of epidemic potential among human RNA viruses", "body": "The relative frequencies of L1-L2, L1-L3/4 and L2-L3/4 transitions varied across genera, 101 families and genome types (Figures 3b-d, Table S2 ). The odds of L1-L3/4 relative to L1-L2 (Table   112 S3, Figure S4 ). There was no indication that L2 viruses tended to arise earlier in lineages than 113 L3/4 viruses. Nor was there a consistent trend towards evolutionary recent (as measured by 114 relative node depth) increases in the number of viruses entering human populations. We also 115 estimated the instantaneous transition rates between IT level (see Supplementary Materials). 116 The rates of L2-L3/4 transitions were not higher than the rates of L1-L3/4 transitions ( Figure   117 3g, Table S4 ). This implies that the distributions of values of parameters a and c in our (Table S4) .\n\nIn contrast to IT levels, host categories are not mutually exclusive traits of a virus 123 species/subtype, and for some genera (e.g. Ebolavirus) it is likely that we are missing sequences 124 from the reservoir host(s). Therefore, we did not attempt a discrete traits analysis for host range 125 but compared the known non-human hosts for L2 and L3/4 viruses at the species/subtype and 126 genus levels (see Supplementary Materials). At the species/subtype level human viruses also 127 found in non-human primates were most likely to be L3/4 rather than L2; those also found in 128 birds were least likely (Figure 4) . At the genus level the pattern was similar (Spearman's rank 129 correlation of coefficient estimates by host category = +0.89, P<0.01) but the confidence In keeping with earlier work 15 , we used RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein-based 136 phylogenies in our main analysis. However, we tested the possibility that alternative 137 phylogenies would generate different numbers and distributions of transitions between traits 138 by constructing alternatives trees based on surface protein sequences ( Figure S8 ). We obtained 139 results that differed minimally from our main analysis, most importantly that an estimated 71% 140 of L3/4 lineages have L1 ancestors (see Data File 9) .\n\nWe recognise that there will be significant gaps in our knowledge of mammal/bird non-RT 143 RNA virus diversity: new species are routinely being identified 8 and virus genome sequences 144 are accumulating rapidly ( Figure S1 ). Our selection procedure resulted in a data set with only 145 28% of virus sequences from human hosts, but it is still likely that the phylogenetic diversity 146 of viruses from non-human hosts is greatly underestimated relative to that from humans 3,14 , 147 noting that for many mammal/bird taxa no RNA viruses at all have yet been reported. There 148 will also be gaps in our knowledge of IT level: some viruses originally classified as L1 have 149 been subsequently found to human infective; and some viruses originally classified as L2 have 150 been subsequently found to be human transmissible as epidemiological data accumulates 6 . As 151 new virus sequences are added and IT levels are assigned or (occasionally) re-assigned it is 152 entirely possible that the estimated ancestors of some L3/4 viruses will change. However, we 153 anticipate that the impact of such changes across the whole data set will be to strengthen our 154 main conclusions. This is because we anticipate that far more L1 viruses will be added than 155 L2, and more L2 than L3/4, continuing the current trend ( Figure S1 ). For this reason, we 156 consider our estimate that 74% of L3/4 viruses arose from L1 lineages to be conservative.\n\nWe did not include two important taxa in our main analysis. The Influenza A virus genus was 159 excluded a posteriori because of a very weak phylogenetic signal for IT level ( Figure S9 ). On 160 inspection of the HA gene phylogeny it is apparent that although human infectivity and 161 transmissibility have evolved in only a few lineages (HA types) there is considerable variability 162 in IT level within those lineages, which would generate inflated counts of IT level change 163 ( Figure S10 ). Nonetheless, the phylogeny is broadly consistent with the pattern that most L3/4 164 lineages evolve from L1 lineages. We excluded Retroviridae from our main analysis a priori 165 because they cause chronic infections that allow far more time for within-host evolution prior 166 to transmission 9 . Consistent with this, we find that transmissible human lentiviruses (lineages 167 author/funder. All rights reserved.

We also estimate that diversification within L3/4 lineages has 177 contributed significantly to human RNA virus diversity, accounting for 30% of species ( Figure   178 1). However, a larger fraction, at least 51%, has been generated directly from L1 lineages. Table S3 ). We have previously suggested an alternative model where the L2 trait is easily 186 evolved and easily lost 3 , but this model is not supported by the analysis reported here.\n\nImportantly, these findings do not preclude extant pools of L2 and L3/4 viruses that have yet 188 to be recognised and may not yet have had the opportunity to enter human populations 16 , but 189 they do imply that the drivers for the emergence of novel human viruses, with or without 190 epidemic potential, would be ecological rather than evolutionary.

In addition, we found that L1 (-)ssRNA virus lineages are relatively 202 more likely to generate L2 than L3/4 viruses (Table 1 ) and, once this was accounted for, there 203 was no additional effect of a virus having an envelope, as has been suggested previously 5 . 204 Nonetheless, this is a large group and (-)ssRNA virus lineages are an important source of L3/4 205 viruses ( Figure 3d ).\n\nThe absence of a clear association between human infectivity and human transmissibility may 208 reflect the key role that cell receptors play in determining a virus's capacity to infect and be 209 transmitted by humans 16, 18 . Cell receptor usage varies between virus genera and sometimes Our study supports a recent proposal for a large-scale survey of viral diversity in non-human 217 reservoirs, the Global Virome Project (GVP) 11 . Though this idea is controversial and would be 218 costly to implement 19 , its relevance is underlined by our finding that most species of human-219 transmissible viruses (L3/4) evolve from mammal/bird RNA virus lineages not known to be 220 infective to humans (L1), coupled with the expectation that the great majority of mammal and 221 bird viruses are still unrecognised 12 . We note recent progress in using machine learning to 222 predict host range from sequence data 20 and the potential of this kind of approach to help 223 identify human-infective and human-transmissible viruses even in the absence of human cases.\n\nFinally, our study also provides empirical support for, and underlines the public health 226 importance of, \"Disease X\", the scenario that a future serious international epidemic might be 227 caused by a pathogen taxon not currently known to affect humans 21 . We find that the ability of 228 RNA viruses to transmit between humans most frequently evolves in a manner consistent with 229 the \"Disease X\" model of emerging infections. author/funder.

Conceptual model of non-RT RNA virus emergence into human populations. Viruses circulating in the non-human reservoir may not be infective to humans (L1) or have the potential to infect or infect and transmit between humans (L2 and L3/4 respectively). Virus lineages in the reservoir may acquire (thick grey arrows showing rates a, b and c) or lose (thin grey arrows) the capacities to infect and/or transmit in humans through genetic drift -these traits are not under direct selection in the non-human reservoir. L2 and L3/4 viruses in non-human hosts may cross the species barrier and enter human populations. L3/4 (but not L2) viruses may then spread and evolve independently in the human population (multiple grey arrows). Phylogenetic analyses identify past transitions between L1 and L3/4, L1 and L2 and L2 and L3/4 viruses and can be used to estimate the relative values of parameters a, b and c. author/funder.

However, we carried out a separate analysis for the one genus -Lentivirus -with 52 sufficient pol protein sequences available. Phylogenetic analysis 64 We performed parallel phylogenetic analyses using the BEAST software package 4 (V1.8.2). 65 We were primarily interested in tree topology; branch lengths scale to numbers of amino acid We tested the associations between IT levels and polymerase trees per genus using Phylogeny-74 trait association test (BaTS) 8 , inspecting both the Association index (AI) and Parsimony score 75 (PS) between genera. We observed that the Influenza A virus genus showed evidence of a 76 uniquely weak phylogenetic signal (Fig. S9a ) so this genus was subsequently considered 77 separately from the main analysis.

We obtained excellent agreement between mean 124 estimates of numbers of forward transitions using parsimony analysis and counts estimated 125 from our discrete traits analysis (Table S1, Fig. S12b) , noting that the parsimony approach does We calculated the depth of the node of each transition on the genus-level phylogenetic tree 151 relative to the ancestral node ( Fig. S4 and Data Files 2 and 3) .
