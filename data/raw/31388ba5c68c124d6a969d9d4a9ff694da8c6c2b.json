{"title": "Haemorrhagic-fever-like changes and normal chest radiograph in a doctor with SARS", "body": "reported to have SARS after exposure to an index case. One infected staff member had no exposure to any admitted patient with SARS and was classified as a communityacquired infection. All index patients and infected staff in the study, except for one, showed a four-fold rise in the number of antibodies to corona-like virus.\n\n356 completed questionnaires were returned, covering 85% of the staff on roster. Non-responders were mostly those on leave or night shift, which is rotated among the staff. We excluded 102 staff who had no contact with index patients. Most of the infected staff were from the medical wards (table 1) , and omitted at least one of the four measures queried. Two who were using a mask reported only paper masks.\n\nStaff who used masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them, but the association for gloves was not significant (table 2) . None of the 69 staff reporting use of all four measures became infected. By contrast, all 13 infected staff had omitted at least one of the measures (p=0\u00b70224). However logistic regression of the four measures with forward stepwise selection showed that only use of masks was significant in the final model (table 2) .\n\nThe staff who wore surgical masks and N95 masks were significantly associated with non-infection (table 2), but this was not seen for paper masks.\n\nThat use of masks and hand-washing was associated with non-infection, and that no staff became infected when they used all four measures, suggest that precautions against droplets and contact are adequate for prevention of nosocomial SARS, where no aerosolisations are expected. The surgical and N95 masks were both effective in significantly reducing the risk of infection, which together with the finding that 30% of non-infected staff did not use masks (table 2) supports that transmission is not airborne. The finding that paper masks did not significantly reduce the risk is not unexpected. Such masks, being easily wet with saliva, are never recommended as a precaution against droplets. 3 In any survey, recall bias is a concern. However, it probably had little effect since the associations shown are clear and the information requested was about simple concrete behaviour and events that took place recently. Masks seem to be essential for protection, since only this measure was significant in stepwise logistic regression. Thus, in hospital, the other three measures add no significant protection to the mask. This finding fits well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level making the mask crucial for protection. Haemorrhagic-fever-like changes and normal chest radiograph in a doctor with SARS\n\nA 33-year-old doctor contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome presenting with features of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy without changes in the chest radiograph initially. A CT scan of his chest showed marked lung changes. His condition improved with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily and ribavirin 1\u00b72 g orally thrice daily. The case illustrates the importance of a break in fever between the viraemic and lung inflammatory phases of the illness that\n\nL Yam, W C Yu, S T Lai, and K Tsang.\n\nNone declared.\n\nNon-infected p* Odds ratio Staff (n=13) staff ( NC=not calculatable. *Two-tailed. \u2020Odds ratio of staff with specific protection not getting infected. \u2021\"Yes\" and \"most of the time\" were grouped together. \u00a7Total cases 254 by forward stepwise (Waldesian) logistic regression using 0\u00b705 as entry probability and 0\u00b710 as removal probability.

He was examined by JJYS. His fever had gone by March 12, and his chest radiograph was normal. His platelet count was 94\u03eb10 9 /L and white-cell count was 3\u00b74\u03eb10 9 /L (monocytes 0\u00b74\u03eb10 9 /L). A nasopharyngeal swab grew no pathogens.\n\nHe was admitted to the SARS triage ward on March 13, and was started on oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day and levofloxacin 500 mg daily. Further blood tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (platelets 61\u03eb10 9 /L, D-dimer 630 ng/mL, prothrombin time 11\u00b71s, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 43\u00b73s). His white-cell count was 1\u00b78\u03eb10 9 /L (neutrophils 1\u00b71\u03eb10 9 /L, lymphocytes 0\u00b75\u03eb10 9 /L, and monocytes 0\u00b72\u03eb10 9 /L. His chest radiograph showed a prominent right hilum. CT of his thorax showed an ill-defined opacity with an air bronchogram in the apical posterior segment of the right lower lobe and diffusely in the right middle lobe. He was started on oral ribavirin 1\u00b72 g thrice daily and intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily. His fever settled the next morning and his coagulopathy improved (APTT 40\u00b77 s, platelet count 105\u03eb10 9 /L, and D-dimer of 564 ng/mL). On March 19, 2003, oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg was started.\n\nOn the evening of March 20, he had a fever of 38\u00b79\u00b0C. His white blood cell count rose to 15\u00b77\u03eb10 9 /L (predominantly due to an increase in neutrophils). A secondary bacterial chest infection was suspected, and cefipime 2 g was given intravenously. Over the next 2 days he became increasingly breathless and his coagulopathy became worse (D-dimer 716 ng/mL, prothrombin time 11\u00b79 s, platelets 199\u03eb10 9 /L). The patient was given a single dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously and 4 L/min of oxygen. After this, he began to get better. Coagulation parameters returned to normal, he was weaned off of oxygen, and was discharged from hospital on March 31, 2003, on 0\u00b73 mg/kg prednisolone and ribavirin 600 mg orally three times a day. On April 7, his chest radiograph showed worsening consolidation of the consolidation of the right middle zone and the prednisolone was increased to 0\u00b75 mg/kg. This illness shows several characteristic features of SARS. There is often a break in the fever between the viraemic stage (days 1-3) and the lung inflammation phase of the illness. Patients who become apyrexial for several days still need up to 10 days of quarantine and follow-up. Haemorrhagic-fever-like illness with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy does occur but is usually mild. Although 78\u00b73% of SARS patients in our centre had an abnormal chest radiographs when feverish, 3 some can have relatively normal radiographs. As shown in this case, a chest CT can show hidden pneumonic changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis."}
