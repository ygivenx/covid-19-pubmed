{"title": "Protection of Mice against Infection with Mouse Hepatitis Virus Type 3 by Injection of Silica", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) is a coronavirus naturally occurring in mice that, upon systemic administration, causes lethal hepatitis within a few days (see references 14,21 and 22 for reviews). The strong tropism of this virus for macrophages is well established (2) . Thus, high virus titers after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection are observed in the peritoneal wash-out fluid, presumably derived from viral replication in macrophages. We have, in addition, shown that MHV3 replicated to high titers in cultures of pure macrophages which are grown from mouse bone marrow using conditioned media (SCHINDLER, L. and KIRCHNER, H., manuscript in preparation).\n\nHowever, in addition to serving as a target cell of viral replication, macrophages may have a role in antiviral defense by a variety of mechan isms, some of which are yet ill-defined (IS). One of these may be the production of interferon (9) . One way of blocking macrophage function in vivo is the injection of silica (1) and with certain viruses it has been shown that the injection of silica brakes antiviral resistance (24) . We have recently observed that injection of C. parvum caused a protection of mice against MHV3 infection (18) . Since C. parvum is known to activate macrophages (19) , we have speculated that macrophage activation may be related to antiviral protection. Therefore, we have attempted to brake the antiviral effect of C. parvum by injection of silica. These experiments were not successful, but, unexpectedly, we observed that silica had a protective effect against MHV3 infection by itself.\n\nOur starting virus material has been described (18) . This virus was replicated in macrophage cultures derived from peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of C57BLl6 mice resulting in a virus pool the titer of whieh was 10 6 MID (macrophage infecting doses; see below). One pool of virus was used in almost all experiments. In a single series of experiments (Table 2 ) an additional preparation was used which was kindly provided by Dr. H. Wege (Wiirzburg, FRG). It was grown in Sac (-) cells, (a Moloney sarcoma virus transformed cell line) and contained 4.7 x 10) TCID so (tissue culture infective doses) per ml.\n\nIn vitro cultures of BM macrophages were set up according to a protocol described previously (11) . In brief, BM cells were obtained by flushing femurs and tibias with Balanced Salt Solution (BSS). A single suspension was prepared by passage through a 25-gauge needle. The cells were plated at densities of 200.000/ml in 24-well plates (Cole 76-003-05, Linbro. Flow Labs, Bonn. FRG) and cultured in Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium (D-MEM. Seromed, Miinchen, FRG) supplemented with 15 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (PBS). 5 % heat inactivated horse serum (Seromed, Miinehen, FRG), 1 %, essential and non-essential amino acids 200 mM L-glutamine, 50 Ill/ml gentamycin (Gibco, N. Y .\u2022 USA) and 20 % L-cell conditioned medium (the conditioned L-cell medium was prepa.red in our own laboratory). BM cells were refed daily starting on day 5 and were cultured for a total of 8 to 10 days.\n\nBM macrophages can be grown easily in large numbers and their yield is considerably higher than the yield of peritoneal macrophages from the same number of mice. In BM cultures grown in L cell-conditioned medium, the number of morphologically defined macrophages increased linearly until days 8 to 10 and then remained constant. From day 10 on 100 % of the cells were macro phages, according to the criteria of phagocytOsis, adherence to plastic surfaces and to non-specific esterase staining. These data (that are not extensively documented here) arc in full accordance with the data of KUMETlEK and REMOLD (11) .\n\nFor titration of the virus, BM cells were grown in 24-well plates for 8 to 10 days. After this time, the cells were infected with MHV3 and incubated for an additional 3 days. MHV3 causes the formation of giant cells in these cultures, subsequently referred to as CPE. Virus titers are expressed as the reciprocal value of the virus dilution that still caused this effect (also designated MID = macrophage infecting dose).\n\nMale mice of several inbred strains were obtained from Bomholtgard (Ry, Denmark) at the age of 8 weeks and used in the experiments within the subsequent 4 weeks.\n\nSilica (DQ 12 < 5 ~m) was obtained from Dr. M. Reisner (Steinkohlebergbauverein, Postfach 13 01 40, 4300 Essen 13, FRG). It was suspended in sterile Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution.\n\nC. parvum (strain CN 6134, Burroughs Wellcome, Beckenham, England) was a killed suspension of bacteria containing 7 mg of protein per ml and thiomersal. In the experiments described here, 700 Ilg of C. parvum were injected 2 hrs before virus infection.\n\nMice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with MHV3 (in most experiments, with a dose equivalent to 10 LDso for the given mouse strain). The tested compounds were injected i.p. at various times before or after virus infections. Dead mice were recorded twice daily of several days. Since all mortality occurred between days 3 and 5, the experiments were terminated after 7 days.\n\nIn order to identify the percentage of macrophages in the peritoneal wash-out population, the method of esterase staining was used as described by KOSKI et a1. (10) . Peritoneal macrophages show a dark-red cytoplasma when stained by this method, whereas other cell types (lymphocytes) either remain unstained or show a slight green colour after counterstain with methyl green.\n\ninfection C57BLl6 mice that are highly susceptible to infection with MHV3 were infected i.p. with 10 LO so \u2022 As previously reported (18) , injection of 700!,g of C. parvum simultaneously with the virus caused a protection of 90 % of the mice (Table 1 ). This protection was not affected when 1 mg silica was injected 2 hrs before C. parvum (plus MHV3). Unexpectedly, however, the dosage of silica in the control group caused a protection against MHV3. The experiments described in the following paragraphs were undertaken to analyze this protective effect of silica against the lethal outcome of the i.p. infection with MHV3.\n\nA range of doses of silica were injected i.p. 2 hrs before i.p. infection with MHV3, and tested for their protective effect. As can be seen in Figure 1 , protection was optimal when a dose of I mg was injected. This dose subsequently was used in all experiments. Figure 2 shows that equal protection was observed when I mg of silica was injected at different times before virus infection or simultaneously with the virus. However, injecting silica more than 72 hrs before virus infection had only marginal protective effects, if any. In still additional experiments, we injected 1 mg of silica 2 hrs before virus infection and varied the dose of MHV3 ( Table 2) . As above, a marked effect was observed when 10 LD\" were injected. Protection could also be observed against 1 00 LDso, but there was no protection against higher virus doses. In this set of experiments, we have also tested another isolate of MHV3 and have obtained the same results as with the isolate which we used routinely.\n\ntive against i.p. infection with MHV3, indicating that protection is not due to systemic effects but rather represents a local phenomenon (data not documented).\n\nIn C57BLl6 mice after i.p. infection with 10 LD\" MHV3, high virus titers are observed in the peritoneal wash-out fluid, in the spleen, and in the liver (Table 3) . However, no virus could be detected at these sites in mice injected with 1 mg silica 2 hrs before infection.\n\nC57BLl6 mice were injected with 1 mg of silica and the number of macrophages in the washed-out PEC was determined by esterase staining (Table 4 ). It can be seen that there was a drastic drop in esterase-positive cells already at 4 hrs after injection of silica. The number of positive cells that represented about 50 % in untreated control mice dropped to about 8 %. Even these, by morphology, were not typical large macrophages but rather small atypical cells, perhaps macrophage precursors and showed only a weak staining pattern (latter data not shown).\n\nAll experiments reported thus far have been performed with C57BLl6 mice which are highly susceptible to infection with MHV3. In additional experiments, mice of other strains or Fl hybrids were tested ( Table 5 ). As can be seen, all mice could be protected against lethal doses of the virus by injection of 1 mg of silica 2 hrs before virus infection.\n\nIn mouse models of viral infection, and probably in virus infections of man, macrophages may have a pivotal role. In certain systems, it has been shown that they are involved in antiviral defense, for example, in a mouse model of infection with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) -(8). These findings have been reiterated by our recent data, that endogenously produced interferon may playa role in resistance (6) , and that macrophages are the producer cells of this interferon (9).\n\nOn the other hand, macrophages are important target cells of a number of different viruses, including HSV (13), Lactatdehydrogenase Virus (LDV) (5) and also MHV3 (2). Thus, viral replication in macrophages represents a key element in viral pathogenesis. This is certainly true for MHV3 for which it was shown that the genetic control of viral resistance is expressed on the level of the macrophage (2). It is, however, not firmly established if macrophages playa role in antiviral resistance in the MHV3 system .\n\nIn recent studies, we (10) and others (7, 17, 20) have tested \u00bbimmuno stimulatory\u00ab bacteria for their effects in experimental viral infections. In our studies, we have found C, parvum to be active against HSV infection when given several days before the virus. In contrast, protection against MHV3 was observed when C. parvum was injected on the day of virus infection (18) . The reasons for protection in the latter system were not understood, but one of the most prominent effects of C. parvum is the activation of macrophages (19) . Thus, we have made an attempt to reverse the protective effect of C, parvum by injection of silica, an agent known to be toxic for macrophages (1) . This approach unexpectedly has yielded the result that silica itself had a protective effect against MHV3. Again, the time relationship was such that silica protected when given close to the time point of virus infection.\n\nAnother virus that replicates in mouse macrophages is LDV, and DuBuy under the assumption that silica, by killing the macrophages, will deplete the peritoneal cavity of macrophages and thus, be protective. However, in the LDV system, there was no protection by silica. In addition, it was shown that, although silica was toxic for macrophages, it additionally caused the rapid influx of new macrophage precursors into the peritoneal cavity. BUTZKO et aI., however, found that infection of silica was capable of protecting mice against infection with Junin Virus (3). However, the reasons for this protection were not elaborated on.\n\nYet, it has to be added thadnthe system of HSV infection of mice, also where virus replication occurs in peritoneal macrophages, resistance is broken by injection of silica (24) . These data were reproduced in our laboratory using C57BLl6 mice and the same batch of silica used as in the present study (unpublished data). Thus, as far as the in vivo effects of silica are concerned, a complex picture emerges from the data in three different virus systems.\n\nThe protective effect of silica is not caused by a direct effect on MHV3 since incubation of MHV3 with silica in vitro, followed by low-speed centrifugation, did not impair infectivity of the virus which remained in the supernatant (unpublished data). Also, the protective effect does not appear to involve host genetics, since\u00b7 highly susceptible C57BLl6 mice were equally protected as resistant AI] mice that, in order to evoke lethality, had to be injected with much higher virus doses. Finally, protection appears to represent a local phenomenon and not a systemic effect of silica since intravenous injection of silica was not protective against i.p. virus infection.\n\nInvestigating the number of esterase-positive cells in the peritoneal wash out fluid, we found that there was a marked decrease (8 % as compared to 45 % positive cells in control mice). Perhaps this decrease was even more pronounced since the remaining positive cells by morphology were not typical macrophages and were only slightly stained. Our data may be -in contrast to the data of DuBuy (3) -still compatible with the conclusion that the protective effect of silica is caused by killing of the target cells for replication of MHV3. Depletion of esterase-positive cells after injection of silica was only short lived and after 24--48 hrs, high numbers of positively staining cells were found again. This result may explain why only little protection is observed when silica is injected 48-72 hrs before infection.\n\nHowever, the protective effect of silica in its time relationship was similar to the one of C. parvum (18) and glucan (23) . These two compounds certainly do not kill the macrophages in the peritoneal cavity (unpublished data), but both compounds cause, among other effects, enhanced mac rophage phagocytosis. It will have to be determined whether there is a common mechanism underlying the protective effect of these two com pounds and of silica on MHV3 infection."}
