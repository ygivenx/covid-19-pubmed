{"title": "Journal of Infection Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses", "body": "As reported in this Journal 1 and elsewhere 2 , an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is on-going in China and has spread to the world. As of Feb 16, 2020 (24:00, GMT+8), there have been 70548 confirmed patients and more than 1700 deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, and 58182 confirmed patients and 1696 deaths in the most affected province, Hubei Province. Much research progress has been made in dissecting the evolution and origin of SARS-CoV-2 and characterizing its clinical features [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .\n\nWhile the outbreak is on-going, people raise grave concerns about the future trajectory of the outbreak, especially given that the working and schooling time has been already dramatically postponed after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday was over (scheduled on Jan 31). In particular, a precise estimation of the potential total number of infected cases and/or confirmed cases is highly demanding. Earlier studies based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation and susceptible-infected-recovered-dead models revealed the number of potentially infected cases and the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 3, 8, 9 . These traditional epidemiological models apparently require much detailed data for analysis 3, 8 .\n\nHere we explored a simple data-driven, Boltzmann function-based approach for estimation only based on the daily cumulative number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 (Note: the rational for Boltzmann function-based regression analysis is presented in supporting information (SI) file). We decided to collect data (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in several typical regions of China, including the center of the outbreak (i.e. Wuhan City and Hubei Province), other four most affected provinces (i.e., Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan) and top-4 major cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen). During data analysis on Feb 13, 2020, the number of new confirmed cases on Feb 12 in Hubei Province and Wuhan City suddenly increased by 14840 and 13436, respectively, of which 13332 and 12364 are those confirmed by clinical features (note: all the number of confirmed cases released by Feb 12 were counted according to the result of viral nucleic acid detection rather than by referring to clinical features). We thus arbitrarily distributed these suddenly added cases to the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1), assuming that they were linearly accumulative in those days. It is the same forth with the data for Wuhan City.\n\nRegression analyses indicate that all sets of data were well fitted with the Boltzmann function (all R 2 values being close to 0.999; Figs. 1A, 1B, S1, and Table 1 ). The potential total number of confirmed cases for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces were estimated as 72800\u00b1600, 59300\u00b1600, 42100\u00b1700 and 12800\u00b1100; respectively; those for provinces Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and Hunan were 1300\u00b110, 1170\u00b110, 1260\u00b110, 1050\u00b110, 1020\u00b110 and 940\u00b110, respectively ( Table 1) ; those for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen were 394\u00b14, 328\u00b13, 337\u00b13 and 397\u00b14, respectively. In addition, we estimated the key date, on which the number of daily new confirmed cases is lower than 0.1% of the potential total number as defined by us subjectively (refer to Table 1 ).\n\nThe above analyses were performed assuming that the released data on the confirmed cases are precise. However, there is a tendency to miss-report some positive cases such that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. One typical example indicating this uncertainty is the sudden increase of more than 14 000 new confirmed cases in Hubei Province on Feb 12 after clinical features were officially accepted as a standard for infection confirmation. Another uncertainty might result from insufficient kits for viral nucleic acid detection at the early stage of the outbreak. We thus examined the effects of such uncertainty using a Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the Methods section in SI file). For simplicity, we assumed that the relative uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%.\n\nUnder the above conditions, the potential total numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for different regions were estimated (Figs. 1C, 1D, S2 and S3) and summarized in Table 1 . The potential total numbers for China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were 79589 (95% CI 71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively, indicating that overall the outbreak may not be so bad as previously estimated 9 . Such uncertainty analysis also allowed us to estimate the key dates at 95% CI. As summarized in Table 1 , the key dates for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces would fall in (2/28, 3/10), (2/27, 3/10), (2/28, 3/10) and (2/27, 3/13), respectively.\n\nFinally, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has undoubtedly caused us the memories of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003. We thus collected the data from the WHO officiate website for analysis, and found that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV both in China and worldwide were fitted well with the Boltzmann function, with R 2 being 0.999 and 0.998, respectively (Figs. 1E and 1F) .\n\nIn summary, we found that all data sets, including both the on-going outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China and the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic in China and worldwide, were well fitted to the Boltzmann function ( Fig. 1 and S1) . These results strongly suggest that the Boltzmann function is suitable for analyzing the epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOne advantage of this model is that it only needs the cumulative number of confirmed cases, somehow as simple as the recently proposed model 10 . In addition, the estimated potential total numbers of confirmed cases and key dates may provide valuable guidance for Chinese central and local governments to deal with this emerging threat at current critical stage.
