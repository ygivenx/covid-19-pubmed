{"title": "DNA segment of African Swine Fever Virus 1 first detected in hard ticks from sheep and bovine", "body": "In this study, we aimed to detect viruses in hard ticks using the small RNA sequencing based method. 24 A 235-bp DNA segment was detected in Dermacentor nuttalli (hard ticks) and D. silvarum (hard ticks) from 25 sheep and bovine, respectively. The detected 235-bp segment had an identity of 99% to a 235-bp DNA 26 segment of African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) and contained three single nucleotide mutations (C38T, 27 C76T and A108C). C38T, resulting in an single amino acid mutation G66D, suggests the existence of a new 28 ASFV strain, which is different from all reported ASFV strains in NCBI GenBank database. These results 29 also suggest that ASFV could have a wide range of hosts or vectors, beyond the well known Suidae family 30 and soft ticks. Our findings pave the way toward further studies of ASFV transmission and development of 31 Amblyomma ticks produce ten times eggs than Ornithodoros ticks. The viruses transmitted by D. nuttalli, D. \n\nAfter data cleaning and quality control, 13,496,191, 25,194,632, 37,888,277, 12,302,335 and 84 author/funder. All rights reserved.

VirusDetect 86 reported the existence of ASFV in all four D. nuttalli samples, but not in A. testudinarium adults. Aligning 87 the cleaned reads to the ASFV reference genome (GenBank: AY261365.1), the mapping rates of four D. 88 nuttalli samples reached 0.06% (15,585/25,194,632) , 0.06% (23,330/37,888,277) , 0.08% 89 (10,241/12,302,335) and 0.08% (12,807/15,077,054), which were significantly higher than the mapping rate 90 0.01% (905/13,496,191) Sanger sequencing of it failed due to low DNA concentration.

The gel 106 electrophoresis results showed the 235-bp bands appeared in 33 and 12, out of 80 D. silvarum samples and 107 100 sheep blood samples, respectively ( Figure 1A) . Two 235-bp DNA sequences were obtained using 108\n\nSanger sequencing from D. silvarum and sheep, respectively to confirm that these 235-bp bands are the 235-109 bp ASFV segment ( Figure 1B) . In addition, the gel electrophoresis results showed 560-bp bands in 41 out 110 of 100 bovine samples. Then, we obtained two 560-bp sequences using Sanger sequencing. Using blast tools, 111\n\nthe results showed that these 560-bp bands could be segments from the bovine genome. 112\n\nFurther analysis of two 235-bp sequences from D. silvarum and sheep showed an identity of 100% 113 between them (Figure 1B) . Using the ASFV reference genome (GenBank: AY261365.1), three single 114 nucleotide mutations were detected at the positions of 38, 76 and 108 (C38T, C76T and A108C) on these 115 two 235-bp sequences. As the 235-bp ASFV segment encodes 78 amino acids, C38T results in a single 116 amino acid mutation at the position 66 (G66D). C38T suggested the existence of a new ASFV strain, which 117 was different from all reported ASFV strains in NCBI GenBank database (version 197). As the D. silvarum 118 ticks and the sheep blood were collected from two different places, this new strain could infected sheep and 119 be transmitted by D. silvarum ticks. Using blast tools, the results showed that the new 235-bp segment in the 120 new ASFV strain did not contain high similar regions with sequences from other viruses, bacteria or animal 121 genomes. As this segment was highly specific to represent ASFV, our study still proved the existence of 122 ASFV in D. nuttalli, D. silvarum and sheep. 123 124\n\nConclusion and discussion 125 In this study, we detected a new 235-bp ASFV segment in hard ticks from sheep and bovine. Although 126 this segment was highly specific to represent ASFV based on knowledge from the current public databases, 127\n\nit still can not rule out the possibilities of this segment from unknown species. The further work is to obtain 128 the complete genome sequence of ASFV from hard ticks or sheep. The cleaning and quality control of sRNA-seq data were performed using the pipeline Fastq_clean [12] 139 that was optimized to clean the raw reads from Illumina platforms. used for all the data analysis in this study. 143\n\nThe RNA extraction of D. nuttalli and cDNA synthesis were performed using the protocol published in 144 our previous study [14] .
