{"title": "", "body": "Immune-Mediated Disorders I mmune-mediated dermatoses are well recognized\" but uncommon skin diseases in dogs and cats. These dermatoses have been reported to account for 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, of all canine and feline dermatoses examined by the dermatology service at a university small animal practice.P\" They have been subdivided into primary or autoimmune, and secondary or immune-mediated, the latter believed to be primarily diseases wherein tissue destruction results from an immunologic event that is not directed against normal self-antigens. 25 , 65 In autoimmune disease, antibodies or activated lymphocytes develop against normal body constituents and induce the lesions of the disease by passive transfer. is, 59 This may result from failure to eliminate high-affinity self-reactive lymphocytes in primary lymphoid organs or failure to regulate the activity of low-affinity self-reactive lymphocytes.\" A major level of control of the autoreactive clones of lymphocytes is suppression by suppressor T cells that are specific for those clones. 25 , 65 The development of autoimmune diseases is a reflection of a lack of control or a bypass of the normal control mechanisms. Over the years, a variety of possible defects have been described, but the exact abnormal mechanism and what induces these diseases still remain unknown. Some of the possibilities include (1) suppressor T cell bypass, (2) suppressor T cell dysfunction, (3) abnormal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II expression or interaction, (4) cytokine and receptor ligand abnormalities, (5) autoantigen modification, (6) cross-reacting antigens, (7) inappropriate interleukin (IL)-2 production, (8) idiotype/anti-idiotype imbalance, (9) mutations in receptor affinity, and (10) failure of clonal deletion of low-affinity autoreactive thymocytes. t In addition, there is sexual dimorphism in the immune response, with female sex hormones tending to accelerate immune responses and male sex hormones tending to suppress responses.\"\n\nIn secondary immune-mediated diseases, the antigen is foreign to the body. Most commonly, the inciting antigens are drugs, bacteria, and viruses that stimulate an immunologic reaction that results in host tissue damage,\" 25, 47, 65 Superantigens are gene products that are recognized by a large fraction of T cells and have the potential to interfere with the recognition and elimination of conventional antigens. 28 These gene products may play a role in the genesis of immune-mediated diseases. So-called \"epitope spreading\" may also be important in autoimmune diseases. us In this situation, patients' bodies make antibodies against one protein early in their disease. Then, as the disease evolves, patients' bodies make additional antibodies against molecules that are similar in structure or even unlike in structure but physically closely associated within the tissue .\n\nThe diagnosis of the these dermatoses requires demonstration of characteristic dermatopathologic changes and, optimally, the autoantibodies, immune complexes, or mediators 'See references 21, 22, 24, 25, 29, 30, 32, 34, 38, 47, 55-57, 59, 66, 67. tSee references 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 25, 26, 27, 35, 37, 39, 41-43, 48, 58, 59, 61, 65, 68, 70 667 (e.g., cytotoxic T cells) of the immunologic injury. Establishing the presence of characteristic dermatopathology requires cutaneous biopsy (see Chap. 2) . In general, the following guidelines should be observed-\":\n\n1. Multiple biopsies should always be taken. 2. Samples should be selected from the most representative lesions of the suspected immune-mediated diseases. 3. Punch biopsy samples should be taken as gently as possible; wedge biopsy by scalpel excision may be necessary. 4. Whenever possible, biopsy specimens should be taken when the animal is not under the effects of any glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive therapy.20, 47, 56 5. Dermatopathologic examination should be performed by a veterinary pathologist who has a special interest in dermatopathology or by a veterinary dermatologist trained in dermatopathology.\n\nEstablishing the mediator of the immunologic damage may require biopsy and/or analysis of the patient's serum for auto or abnormal antibodies. The biopsies for immunopathologic examination often must be processed in special ways that may require fresh tissue, frozen tissue, or specially fixed samples, depending on the test to be performed. The veterinary immunopathology laboratory will be able to tell you what is required. Tests used to detect the presence of autoantibodies or various immunoreactants (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement components, microbial antigens) in skin lesions include immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical (immunoperoxidase) testing ( Fig. 9-1) . 7, 45, 73 In general, the following guidelines are used for collecting these biopsy specimens:\n\n1. Biopsy specimens for direct antibody testing should be selected from areas not secondarily infected and generally representing the earliest lesion typical for that disease; a possible exception is discoid lupus erythematosus, wherein older lesions may be preferred, Vasculitis lesions less than 24 hours old are best. For bullous diseases, the blister itself is not sampled; instead, the adjacent normal skin or erythematous skin is used. 2. Sites wherein immunoglobulins are often present in normal tissue (e.g., nasal planum of dogs and cats, footpads of dogs) should not be sampled or should be interpreted appropriately (see Chap. 1).33,47 3. Samples for direct immunofluorescence testing need to be fixed and mailed in Michel's fixative. Samples for direct immunoperoxidase testing may be formalinfixed. The results of studies of tissues processed by quick-freezing and of those kept in Michel's fixative for up to 2 weeks are comparable. 10, 47 Studies in dogs and cats suggest that specimens may reliably be preserved in Michel's fixative for at least 7 to 14 days. In some instances, specimens have successfully been preserved for 4 to 8 years.P-47 The pH of Michel's fixative must be carefully maintained at 7.0 to 7.2 to ensure accurate results. 55, 56 4. Samples for direct antibody detection should be sent to a veterinary immunopathology laboratory.\n\nTesting for abnormal antibody or immune complex deposition is considered highly valuable in human medicine for many of the immune-mediated dermatoses. For the similar canine and feline diseases, however, their value has been considerably less. Reports from veterinary immunopathology research laboratories show that techniques and results appear to be improving. 51, 59, 140 However, these tests are fraught with numerous procedural and interpretational pitfalls, including method of specimen handling, choice of substrates used, method of substrate handling, specificity of conjugates, fluorescein-protein-antibody concentrations, and unitage of conjugates. An in-depth discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this chapter; the reader is referred to Beutner and colleagues for details.\"\n\nThe incidence of positive results in the canine disorders typically varies from about 25% to 90% for direct immunofluorescence testing,l9, 47, 55, 56 Positive results are much more commonly achieved with the immunoperoxidase technique. With this technique, however, the incidence of false-positive results is also much higher. 23 . 44 In fact, the intercellular and basement membrane zone deposition of immunoglobulins or complement can be detected from time to time in a wide variety of inflammatory dermatoses. 44, 47, 55, 56, 73 In order to appropriately interpret these tests, one needs a good biopsy specimen for histopathologic examination, However, if one has an appropriate specimen for histopathologic examination, further testing and expense is usually not necessary, Thus, we, as well as others.t\" do not think that these tests need to be routinely done in the work-up of a suspected case of immune-mediated skin disease in a dog or cat.\n\nAutoimmune dermatoses are classified on the basis of the specific autoallergens being targeted, 59, 117, 155. 191 This cannot be determined on the basis of routine immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing, Specific identification requires techniques such as immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. This is rarely done in routine veterinary diagnostic laboratories and is limited to certain veterinary immunologic research laboratories. As a result, we may still be lumping together different diseases or variants that share clinical, histopathologic, and routine immunopathologic features.\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence testing (testing serum for the presence of circulating autoantibody) in the past rarely yielded positive results in dogs and cats, and results were conflicting. Therefore, it was not recommended as a cost-effective test. 19 , 47, 55, 56 More recently, results have been positive in a variety of diseases, including pemphigus foliaceus.P\" 139 pemphigus vulgaris, 59, 167, 168 paraneoplastic pemphigus.l'\" bullous pemphigoid,180, 185 epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.l'\" and alopecia areata. 380, 382 The only disease in which more than a few cases have been studied is canine pemphigus foliaceus, wherein the most recent study reported 63% of the cases to yield positive results.P\" 140 Now that the technology is available, we should consider obtaining tissue and serum samples for researchers who are performing these tests correctly and frequently. Only then will we be able to determine whether the variants described in humans also exist in dogs and cats and whether their differentiation leads to prognostic or therapeutic value. Results of immunopathologic testing can never be appropriately interpreted in the absence of histopathologic findings. 46, 47 On the other hand, histopathologic findings are sufficiently characteristic to be diagnostic in the majority of cases. 22, 47, 71 The clinician's time and the owner's money are better spent in the careful selection and procuring of representative skin specimens and their forwarding to a knowledgeable dermatopathologist. As techniques that are more sensitive become readily available, this type of testing will undoubtedly become more common. For now, we recommend collecting serum from dogs and cats with active suspected autoimmune disease and saving it in the freezer. After other test results are reviewed, and with the recommendation of the pathologist, the indirect immunofluorescence test may still be performed by an appropriate laboratory or the serum may be submitted to appropriate research centers to support future progress. This sample may also be used at a later date as a pretreatment sample for some serum biochemical parameters.\n\nAs a group, all of these immune-mediated dermatoses are characterized by an inappropriate immune response that, to be adequately controlled, may require the use of potent immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs. 16, 76 In the past, this primarily meant high levels of glucocorticoids and, occasionally, cyclophosphamide or azathioprine. These initial attempts at treatment, although often successful, led to many side effects (see Chap. 3 ). In recent years, however, a variety of different treatment approaches have been evaluated, and now more therapeutic options are available to the clinician for the management of some of these diseases. The diseases are not all optimally treated in the same way, however, nor do they carry the same prognosis. Therefore, it is important that the clinician make as specific a diagnosis as possible, Although much work on new approaches to the management of these diseases is underway in human medicine, very little of this information is being applied in veterinary medicine,\n\nThe drugs used to treat immune-mediated skin diseases are generally called immunosuppressive agents. However, the exact mechanism of some of these drugs is unknown. They may act in methods different from those of the more classic immunosuppressive agents. They are considered together because, whatever their mechanism of action, they share the feature of being beneficial in managing the immune-mediated skin diseases.\n\nGlucocorticoids are the most common class of drugs used as immunosuppressive agents. They are discussed in Chapter 3. However, many other drugs are used in practice, and some are effective only in specific diseases (Table 9 -1). A special use of glucocorticoids for the initial treatment of some severe immune-mediated dermatoses is pulse therapy. Glucocorticoid pulse therapy (11 mglkg methylprednisolone sodium succinate given intravenously over 1 hour for 3 consecutive days) was used to induce remissions in cases of canine pemphigus that had not responded to oral glucocorticoids. 79 This therapy is expensive and not without complications (see Chap. 3 ).\n\nCyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Bristol-Meyers Squibb) is metabolized to alkylating agents that inhibit mitosis by interfering with DNA replication and ribonucleic acid (RNA)\n\n\u2022 74 -76 It is used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various neoplasms, as well as for its immunosuppressive activity in nonmalignant diseases and organ transplantation.t\"- 82 Able to kill cells in all phases of the cell cycle, this type of cytotoxic drug is more effective in slow-growing tumors than phase-specific drugs that act during only a specific time of the cell cycle. It is most effective against rapidly dividing cells. Lymphocytes are especially sensitive to cyclophosphamide. The drug is immunosuppressive to both the humoral and cell-mediated immune systems, but it is more effective against B cells than against T cells. Cyclophosphamide suppresses antibody production. Maximal effect occurs if the drug is given shortly after the antigenic stimulus, when it suppresses primary and secondary humoral responses.\n\nMajor toxic sequelae include sterile hemorrhagic cystitis, bladder fibrosis, teratogenesis, infertility, alopecia and poor hair growth, nausea, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, increased susceptibility to infections, and depression of the bone marrow and hematopoietic systems. Cats may lose their whiskers. Hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in up to 30% of dogs on chronic therapy of more than 2 months' duratiori.\" Its effects should be monitored with periodic hemograms and urinalyses.\n\nClinical indications include lymphoreticular neoplasms, for which the drug is best combined with glucocorticoids or vincristine. It can be given with high doses of glucocor-drug very well should have their dose of azathioprine increased.\" Long-term therapy is associated with the development of demodicosis, recurrent bacterial pyoderma, or dermatophytosis in at least 10% of cases.\" Pancreatitis may occur, though this has been reported in dogs that were also receiving glucocorticoids. 86 We have also noted pancreatitis in a few dogs and, in some cases, azathioprine could be continued when the glucocorticoid was discontinued without further episodes of pancreatitis.\n\nPatients should be monitored initially every 2 weeks with complete blood counts and platelet counts.F: 85 After the patient's condition is stable, monitoring can be tapered to once every 4 months. If other symptoms occur, or at least yearly, a chemistry panel should also be run. Hepatitis and pancreatitis are the major conditions to monitor with chemistry panels.\n\nIn small animals, azathioprine may be beneficial for pemphigus complex, bullous pemphigoid, and both types of lupus erythematosus, as well as other autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders.\" It is most commonly used in cases of canine pemphigus foliaceus that do not respond to glucocorticoids. Azathioprine is usually not used alone but is combined with systemic glucocorticoids. There is often a lag phase, with clinical improvement occurring in 3 to 6 weeks.\n\nAfter remission is achieved, the dosages of both drugs are tapered, but initially, unless side effects are a problem, the glucocorticoid dosage is tapered to levels approaching 1 mglkg q48h. The oral dosage of azathioprine for dogs is 2.5 mglkg q24h until clinical response is achieved, and then it is continued every other day for a month or longer. Slow tapering down to as little as 1 mglkg q72h may be achieved. Slow tapering to the lowest dose possible decreases side effects and the expense of therapy. Glucocorticoids can be given on the alternate days when azathioprine is not given. A switch to chrysotherapy has been recommended if high-dose prednisone in combination with azathioprine at 1 mglkg q24h for 3 months, then at 2 mglkg q24h for 3 months, is ineffective.\" Another option is to continue to increase the azathioprine dose if the complete blood counts are relatively normal, especially if the patient is not lymphopenic.\"\n\nCats are susceptible to azathioprine toxicity (including fatal leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), and this drug should be used very cautiously, if at all, in this species. 83 , 84 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Novartis) is effective in preventing human organ transplantation rejection (see Chap. 3). 76, 88, 91 In animal models, it has been used with similar excellent results.P\" It has also been evaluated for the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases, and its systemic use is discussed in Chapter 3. Initial studies in dogs and cats with immunologic dermatoses such as pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus erythematosus, and discoid lupus erythematosus have shown cyclosporine by itself to be rarely effective.\"? 90 It is usually used concurrently with glucocorticoids.\n\nTopical cyclosporine, available as a veterinary product in a 0.2% ointment (Optimmune, Schering-Plough), has been used to treat keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Some of the benefit may reflect the vehicle used. 92 A study treating canine nictitans plasmacytic conjunctivitis showed a Significant response in clinical symptoms as well as a reduction in post-treatment plasma cell mfiltrates.\" No controlled studies with topical cyclosporine for immune-mediated skin diseases have been published. However, we and others have seen cases of localized disease in lupus erythematosus and pemphigus erythematosus that improved when topical cyclosporine was added to the treatment regimen.\n\nLeflunomide is active in a wide range of immune disorders in murine and human models.\" It has antiprohferative effects on T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antibody synthesis, inhibits pyrimidine synthesis, and antagonizes the action of IL-3, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. When used with prednisone and cyclosporine, leflu-nomide virtually eliminates allograft rejection responses. One of the metabolites of leflunomide is highly gastroenterotoxic for dogs; thus the dose and dosage regimen must be closely followed. The dosage for dogs is about 2 to 6 mglkglday orally until a serum trough level of 30 J,Lglml is achieved.\n\nChrysotherapy is the use of gold as a therapeutic agent. Gold compounds are capable of modulating many phases of immune and inflammatory responses, but the exact mechanisms of this effect are unknown.?\" 96. 97 Gold is available in two dosage forms, which have dissimilar pharmacokinetics: The oral compound auranofin (Ridaura, SmithKline Beecham) contains 29% gold, and the parenteral compound aurothioglucose (Solganal, Schering) contains 50% gold. Neither form is approved for use in dogs and cats, but their distribution, metabolism, and actions have been established in humans and laboratory animals. Studies in humans show that the oral forms are 25% absorbed and attain blood levels with a 21-day half-life, but only small amounts can be detected in tissues and skin.l?\" In a few clinical trials in dogs with immune-mediated dermatoses, the results with oral gold were equivocal, but no adverse side effects were observed.l'\" The parenteral form is 100% absorbed but has only a 6-day half-life in blood. It is 95% protein-bound and is well distributed to cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, liver, spleen, bone marrow, kidneys, and adrenal glands. Much lower levels are detected in skin.\n\nIn humans, gold may act at several levels of the inflammatory and immune response. Auranofin appears to have an additional immunomodulating action, whereas gold sodium thiomalate inhibits IL-5-mediated eosinophil survival, but both oral and parenteral golds inhibit bacteria, the first component of complement, and the epidermal enzymes that may be responsible for blister formation in pemphigus.96. 99 Gold inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages.\" Gold also reduces the release of inflammatory mediators, such as lysosomal enzymes, histamine, and prostaglandin; inactivates complement components; interferes with immunoglobulin-synthesizing cells; inhibits antigen-and mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation; and suppresses IL-2 and IL-2 receptor synthesis.76. [96] [97] [98] Toxic effects are worrisome in humans, because 33% of patients have some adverse reaction, although 80% of these reactions are minor. Most common are skin eruptions, oral reactions, proteinuria, and bone marrow depression. During the induction phase, a hemogram and urinalysis should be checked weekly and monthly thereafter.P-97 In over 100 dogs treated with injectable gold salts, the most common side effect was pain at the injection site. 36 In addition, two dogs experienced reversible thrombocytopenia, and four dogs experienced fatal toxic epidermal necrolysis when switched immediately from azathioprine to aurothioglucose therapy for pemphigus foliaceus. 36. 94 This may be enhanced by previous or concurrent administration of azathioprine.77. 96 We have seen aurothioglucose-related erythema multiforme in both dogs and cats and, in one dog and one cat, it manifested primarily as oral ulceration and erythema, Parenteral gold (aurothioglucose) has been reported to be effective for the treatment of cases of canine and feline pemphigus that were unresponsive to glucocorticoids or azathioprine and prednisone combination therapy.P\" 78. 97. 101 It has been useful for the treatment of canine bullous pemphigoid and feline plasma cell pododermatitis.t\" 95. 96 Although most adverse reactions develop late in therapy, it is suggested that a small test dose of 1 mg be given intramuscularly to patients with less than 10 kg of body weight and that 5 mg be given to larger patients in the first week. Dosage is increased to 1 mglkg intramuscularly weekly until remission occurs. If no response occurs after 12 weeks of therapy, the dosage can be increased to 1.5 to 2 mglkg,77 After remission, one dose is given every 2 weeks and then once monthly for several months.\n\nIt is advisable to halt medication administration eventually for observation because some patients go into complete remission, whereas other animals can be maintained on a reduced dosage. Two points of caution: (1) The treatment takes 6 to 12 weeks for full effect to occur, so that other medication-typically glucocorticoids-should be maintained, if needed, at full dosage until this lag period is passed; and (2) gold compounds should not be administered simultaneously with other cytotoxic drugs (such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) because toxicity is thereby enhanced.\n\nThe oral form of gold (auranofin) has been used in only a few dogs with pemphigus (at 3 to 6 mglday) with little success. It has been recommended at 0.12 to 0.2 mglkg q12h but is only available as a nonbreakable 3-mg capsule.'?' In addition, this oral form is expensive.\n\nGold is seldom the first-choice drug for pemphigus. Patients are usually started on a glucocorticoid regimen, with azathioprine added to reduce the steroid dosage. In cases with excessive side effects, or when azathioprine and prednisone are ineffective, gold is a logical choice. It may be especially useful in cats. 77 \u2022 95 Gold injections should be delayed for 4 weeks after the discontinuation of azathioprine.\"\n\nDapsone (Dapsone tablets, Jacobus) is an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial chemical (4,4'diaminodiphenyl sulfone). It inhibits the action of lysosomal enzymes; neutrophil chemotaxis; degranulation of mast cells; synthesis of IgG, IgA, and prostaglandin; activation of the alternative complement pathway; and T cell responses.l'\" It is an antioxidant scavenger and also inhibits proteases. It inhibits the incorporation of choline into cell membranes, resulting in disrupted phospholipid synthesis.105 It has been suggested that dapsone interferes with myeloperoxidase-halide-mediated toxicity, inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis, inhibits IL-I -stimulated adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, inhibits adherence of neutrophils to antibodies deposited in the skin, and inhibits integrin-mediated neutrophil adherence.F: 107 Dapsone is useful in various diseases characterized by accumulations of neutrophils and, in some cases, eosinophils.P\" 105 In humans, it is most efficacious for dermatitis herpetiformis and erythema elevatum diutinum. It is erratically effective for a wide variety of other human skin diseases, including leukocytoclastic vasculitis, bullous lupus erythematosus, bullous pemphigoid, discoid lupus erythematosus, sub corneal pustular dermatosis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and relapsing polychondritis.J'\" In these cases, the human dosage regimen starts low and rapidly builds to 150 mglday. This dosage is held until response occurs and then is gradually decreased and stopped after 4 to 10 months. In many cases, there is no relapse. Treatment with dapsone is also effective in human leprosy and some cases of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn dogs, dapsone has been used with benefit in cases of subcorneal pustular dermatosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, linear IgA pustular dermatosis, and pemphigus foliaceus and erythematosus. 103, 108 Dapsone is most useful in the first two diseases, although not all cases were controlled. In the last three diseases, only about half the cases showed benefit. However, in some cases of pemphigus that were successfully treated with immunosuppressive combinations (such as azathioprine with corticosteroids), the addition of dapsone permitted lowering the dose of the corticosteroid.\n\nDapsone is not approved for use in dogs and cats in the United States, but reports suggest a dosage of 1 mglkg q8h (dogs only!) orally for 2 to 4 weeks until lesions clear, and then a reduction of the frequency of administration to q12h or q24h. Others have used the drug once daily or every 48 hours in combination with prednisone. The less frequent administration may be warranted because a study in normal dogs showed a halflife of 13 hours after intravenous administration.P' In one dog given approximately 5 mgl kg, bioavailability was 99.5% and half-life was 11.5 hours.'!\" The maintenance dosage should be further reduced to q48h, then once or twice weekly, or even stopped, because toxicity is somewhat dose-related.\n\nPotential toxicity can be serious. During induction, mild anemia, leukopenia, and moderate elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase levels may be expected, but this does not necessitate stopping treatment if the animal remains clinically normal. Blood dyscrasias, thrombocytopenias, skin reactions, and hepatic toxicity can be serious but appear to be rare. 106, 108 Patients should be monitored every 2 weeks during induction therapy with hemograms and platelet counts, blood urea nitrogen determination, urinalysis, and serum alanine aminotransferase determination. Cats are especially susceptible to dapsone toxicity, with hemolytic anemia and various neurotoxicities reported. A dosage of 1 mglkg q24h orally is recommended.\n\nSulfasalazine (Azulfidine, Pharmacia) is converted in the colon to sulfapyridine 5-aminosalicylate, which has anti-inflammatory action. lOB The dosage is 10 to 20 mglkg q8h orally.f\": lOB The dosage may be reduced or even changed to every other day while maintaining clinical remission. A serious side effect with long-term administration is the production of keratitis sicca. Thus, tear production should be checked regularly. In one report, two cases with subcomeal pustular dermatosis were managed satisfactorily with sulfasalazine after becoming refractory to dapsone.l'\" Sulfasalazine has also been used successfully in the management of neutrophilic vasculitis.P'-108\n\nThe combination of tetracycline and niacinamide has been recommended for the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus and pemphigus erythematosus in dogs. Reported results are variable, but 25% to 65% of cases have an excellent response. It has also been effective in some cases of pemphigus foliaceus when added to azathioprine and prednisone regimens. Some cases of vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus (Tdiopathic ulcerative dermatosis\") in collies and Shetland sheepdogs respond well to tetracycline and niacinamide.\n\nThis combination has also been used with success in some dogs with lupoid onychodystrophy, German shepherd dog metatarsal fistulae, sterile panniculitis, sterile granulomatous/pyogranulomatous dermatitis, vasculitis, and cutaneous histiocytosis (see Chap. 3 ). The precise mechanism of action is unknown. However, tetracyclines possess various antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, including suppression of in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic transformation and antibody production, suppression of in vivo leukocyte chemotactic responses, inhibition of the activation of complement component 3, inhibition of lipases and collagenases, and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.'!\" Niacinamide has been shown to block antigen-IgE-induced histamine release in vivo and in vitro, prevent degranulation of mast cells, inhibit phosphodiesterases, and decrease protease releases.U\"\n\nThe initial dosage for dogs weighing more than 10 kg is 500 mg of tetracycline and 500 mg of niacinamide given q8h. If response is favorable, the dosage may be decreased to q12h and then to q24h. Although no studies have been reported, one of us (C.E.G.) noted that this combination may have shown benefit when used concurrently with vitamin E or glucocorticoids. It was also reported that tetracycline alone may be beneficial in treating discoid lupus erythematosus.'!' Side effects are uncommon, although vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and diarrhea have been reported and are primarily due to the niacinamide.s\" lll, 112 One of us (C.E.G.) also saw two cases of anorexia with increased liver enzyme activity that resolved with discontinuation of therapy. In one case, tetracycline administration was continued, suggesting that the niacinamide was responsible for the adverse reactions.\n\nSeveral antimalarials have been useful for the treatment of humans with discoid lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, polymorphous light eruption, solar urticaria, and scleroderma.l'\" There are also anecdotal reports of response with cutaneous leishmaniasis, cutaneous cryptococcosis, epidermolysis bullosa, and lymphocytic skin infiltrations.U'' Antimalarials may have future use in problem cases involving animals with such diseases.\n\nTheir specific mode of action is unknown, but the drugs stabilize lysosomal membranes and thus are anti-inflammatory. They inhibit protein synthesis, viral replication, and cell-mediated immunity. They do not affect the development of primary or secondary antibody response but do inhibit complement. Consequently, they may inhibit the formation of immune complexes, which explains their effectiveness in systemic lupus erythematosus and related autoimmune disorders. The drugs are seldom used alone for first-line therapy and, in humans, are usually given with salicylates or small doses of corticosteroids. Side effects are numerous, the most serious affecting the eyes.\n\nThe drugs most commonly used in humans are quinacrine hydrochloride (Atabrine hydrochloride, Winthrop), chloroquine (Aralen, Winthrop), and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil sulfate, Winthrop). Their place in veterinary dermatology has yet to be determined, although anecdotal reports suggest that the antimalarials may be beneficial in canine lupus erythematosus.P' No case reports or studies supporting their efficacy have been reported.\n\nColchicine has been useful for the treatment of humans with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, and relapsing polychondritis.l'\" It may have future use in problem cases involving animals with such diseases.\n\nColchicine is an alkaloid that suppresses neutrophil chemotactic and phagocytic functions via disruption of microtubule assembly and elongation, increasing cellular cyclic AMP levels and inhibiting lysosomal degranulation. It also inhibits immunoglobulin secretion, IL-l production, histamine release, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression. The main side effects are gastrointestinal.\n\nEarly clinical reports in dogs involved the use of a colchicine analog in cases of \"eczema.T'\" These reports are not interpretable.\n\nThe pemphigus complex is a group of uncommon autoimmune diseases described in dogs and cats that is comparable to the human disease. Although there are similarities, many Significant differences exist. These disorders are vesiculobullous to pustular disorders of the skin or mucous membranes characterized by acantholysis (loss of cohesion between keratinocytes). In humans, there are at least eight varieties of pemphigus, whereas dogs and cats have at least five varieties.P: 155. 169 \n\nIn humans, the pemphigus complex is characterized histologically by intraepithelial acantholysis leading to vesicle formation and lmrnunologically by the presence of autoantibodies to components of the keratinocyte desmosome, both bound in the skin and circulating in the serum.l'\" 118. 155 The clinical lesions, both in severity and in body location, appear to relate to which components of the desmosome the autoantibodies are targeting. ll7 \u00b7 146. 155. 165 For instance, humans with mucosal dominant pemphigus vulgaris have antibodies against desmoglein III, those with pemphigus foliaceus produce antibodies against desmoglein I, and patients with mucocutaneous pemphigus vulgaris produce both.'!\" Using a neonatal mouse model, the injection of antidesmoglein III IgG alone is not efficient at inducing gross skin lesions, whereas combining both antidesmoglein III and antidesmoglein I does produce lesions.P? As pemphigus vulgaris progresses to cutaneous involvement, antidesmoglein I antibodies are produced, possibly because of epitope spreading.\n\nIn dogs and cats, only pemphigus vulgariS causes an intraepidermal vesicle or bulla. The other forms of pemphigus are typically associated with intraepidermal pustules, a major distinction between the human and the canine and feline diseases.v- 127, 130 In the past, pemphigus antibody was not readily demonstrated in the skin or serum of many dogs and cats.P\" In humans, negative immunologic findings raise serious doubts about the diagnosis for some variants of pemphigus. However, as the techniques to find serum autoantibodies improve, the frequency of detection increases. 137. 138, 140 These two differences raise questions about the pathologic similarities and the accuracy of the diagnosis based on just clinical and histopathologic findings between the human and animal diseases. Part of the discrepancy also relates to sensitivity and technique because we appear to be finding more cases with detectable serum autoantibodies, and these autoantibodies do target similar or identical structures as in the human diseases. 59. 125, 138, 167, 168 Further studies comparing cases with and without appropriate immunologic findings are needed to determine whether we have multiple similar diseases or the identification primarily relates to the sensitivity of the techniques being used.\n\nPemphigus antigens are heterogeneous (85 to 260 kd) and present in all mammalian and avian skin, and those identified specifically are associated with desmosomal components.P\" 125, 126, 155 In humans, regional variation exists in the expression of both pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris antigens, which also differ from each other.P\" This regional difference and the specific profile of the patient's autoantibodies correlate with, and help to explain, the distribution of lesions in clinical disease. 117, 146 Canine skin has been shown to have similar antigens.I\" 167, 168 The pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus antibodies from human patients reproduce their respective clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic syndromes when injected into neonatal mice. Antibodies to some of these antigens are not associated with pathology, however.\n\nThe pathomechanism of blister formation in pemphigus is unknown, though it has been proposed to be as follows: (1) the binding of pemphigus antibody on the antigen, (2) internalization of the pemphigus antibody and fusion of the antibody with intracellular lysosomes, and (3) resultant activation and release of a keratinocyte proteolytic enzyme (plasminogen activator or another factor), which diffuses into the extracellular space and converts plasminogen into plasmin, which hydrolyzes the adhesion molecules. 18, 124, 167, 168 The resultant loss of intercellular cohesion leads to acantholysis and blister formation within the epidermis. The pemphigus antibody-induced acantholysis is not dependent on complement or inflammatory cells. Experimentally, however, complement potentiates the acantholysis. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors were shown to have increased expression in the skin lesions of humans with pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus.'?' Other studies have shown that plasminogen activator activity does not correlate with lesion development, and studies conducted in genetically engineered mouse models also have suggested that direct interference with the antibody targets creates similar lesions.\"\n\nIn desmoglein IIlnull mice, treatment with human pemphigus vulgaris serum induces extensive acantholysis and blistering, suggesting that autoantibodies against cell-surface molecules other than desmoglein I and desmoglein III can induce pemphigus vulgaris.!\" Patients with pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus have IgG antibodies that precipitate cholinergic receptors.v\" Because cholinergic receptors control keratinocyte adhesion and motility, their inactivation by autoantibodies may elicit cell signals that cause desmosomal disassembly. Although keratinocyte desmosomal cadherins (desmoglein I and III) hold the cells together, desmoglein Illnull mice do not experience spontaneous acantholysis and blisters. In addition, activation of cholinergic receptors can prevent, stop, and reverse the acantholysis elicited by pemphigus antibodies in vitro. Thus, the acantholysis in pemphigus may be mediated by at least two complementary pathogenic pathways: (1) anticholinergic receptor autoantibodies that weaken intercellular adhesion between keratinocytes via inactivation of the cholinergic receptor-mediated physiologic control of cadherin (desmoglein) expression and/or function, which causes dyshesion, cell detachment, and rounding up (acantholysis), and (2) autoantibodies to other adherence molecules (e.g., desmoglein) that prevent the formation of new desmosomes.\n\nUltraviolet light irradiation exacerbates the acantholysis induced by anti-desmoglein I and anti-desmoglein III autoantibodies in patients with pemphigus erythematosus, pemphigus foliaceus, and pemphigus vulgaris. 139 , 153. What initiates the autoantibody formation is still unknown, though a virus spread by an insect vector is suspected in an endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus (fogo selvagem) in South America. 18. 145 It has been suggested that the black fly may play the role of vector. This hypothesis has been supported by an epidemiologic study correlating exposure to black flies as a risk factor for endemic pemphigus foliaceus.r\" Genetic factors in humans and dogs also appear to be important. In humans, both pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris have HLA associations, and some populations may be susceptible to pemphigus vulgaris due to differences in their immune response genes. 18 Although this has not been demonstrated in dogs, breed predispositions and familial cases have been shown. 47 , 150 Other factors thought to be involved in the (pathogenesis of some cases of pemphigus are drug provocation (especially penicillamine and phenylbutazone), ultraviolet light, and emotional upset.\" 18. 47. 139. 157, 163, 164 Drugs and chronic skin disease both seem to be important in the pathogenesis of some cases of canine and feline pemphigus. 130, 131 Interestingly, drug-induced disease in humans is less commonly associated with classic immunopathologic findings. 172 Possibly, the human druginduced form is more similar to animal pemphigus. The most commonly incriminated drugs are those with highly reactive sulfhydryl moieties (e.g., penicillamine) and those with an amide component (e.g., captopril, penicillins, cephalosporins).\n\nDiet has been implicated as a cause of pemphigus in humans.P\" 170 The molecular structure of many food ingredients is similar to that of known pemphigus-inducing drugs. For instance: thiols contained in garlic, onion, leek, and chive; isothiocyanates in mustard, horseradish, turnip, radish, cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts; phenols in mango, cashews, and many food additives; and tannins in tea, coffee, ginseng, certain berries, banana, pear, apple, and avocado. Interestingly, most humans with fogo selvagem live close to rivers, many of which contain high levels of tannins because of decomposing leaves and other vegetable matter.F\" Heat and humidity cause tannin decomposition. Perhaps consumption of such substances is more important than black flies! Owing to the thinness, or other characteristics, of canine and feline epidermis, intraepidermal vesicles, bullae, and pustules are fragile and transient. Thus, clinical lesions usually include erosions and ulcers bordered by epidermal collarettes.\n\nThe pemphigus complex is uncommon in dogs and cats, accounting for about 0.6% to 1% of all canine and feline skin disorders seen at university small animal clinics.56, 59 In general, the various forms of pemphigus have relatively distinct clinical differences. Certain diagnostic features, however, can be applied to the whole group. The most important diagnostic aspects are the history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings. Detection of pemphigus antibody by direct immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing may also be helpful but, owing to costs, technical problems, and relatively poor diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at routine laboratories, these tests are not routinely recommended. If they are performed, however, all the pemphigus variants should show an intercellular deposition of IgG or complement components (see Fig. 9 -IA). 47, 163. 164 In three of seven dogs with pemphigus foliaceus, the IgG was of the IgG2 or IgG4 subtypes.P Occasionally, immunoglobulins of other classes are found. Indirect immunofluorescence testing infrequently yields positive results unless a research laboratory is used; even then, results are still not routinely positive.P' Pemphigus erythematosus may show deposition of immunoreactants along the basement membrane zone in addition to the intercellular findings (see Fig. 9 -IB). Microscopic examination of direct smears from intact vesicles or pustules or from recent erosions often reveals numerous nondegenerate neutrophils, occasionally numerous eosinophils, and numerous acantholytic keratinocytes. 55 , 164 One or two acantholytic keratinocytes may be visible in an occasional high-power microscopic field during microscopic examination in any suppurative condition, but when these cells are present in clusters or large numbers in several microscopic fields, they are strongly suggestive of pemphigus.\n\nSkin biopsy may be diagnostic or strongly supportive in pemphigus. 22, 47, 55. 164 Intact vesicles, bullae, or pustules are essential. Because these lesions are so fragile and transient, it may be necessary to hospitalize the animal so that it can be carefully scrutinized for 2 to 4 hours for the presence of primary lesions. When a bullous lesion is observed, biopsy must be performed immediately. Multiple biopsies and serial sections greatly increase the chances of demonstrating diagnostic histologic changes.\n\nElectron-microscopic examination of pemphigus lesions has suggested that dissolution of the intercellular cement substance is the initial pathologic change, followed by the retraction of tonofilaments, disappearance of desmosomes, and acantholysis. 163, 164 Results of routine laboratory determinations (hemogram, serum chemistries, urinalysis, serum protein electrophoresis) are nondiagnostic, often revealing mild to moderate leukocytosis and neutrophilia, mild nonregenerative anemia, mild hypoalbuminemia, and mild to moderate elevations of (X2, (3, and ' Y globulins. 163, 164\n\nThe prognosis for canine pemphigus appears to vary with the form and severity of the disease. 55. 16,3. 164 The natural course of untreated cases is unclear. Veterinarians have long recognized refractory mucocutaneous erosive or ulcerative disorders and severe exfoliative dermatoses that have resulted in the death or euthanasia of affected dogs and cats. Retrospectively, many of those dogs and cats may have had pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceus. On the basis of the small numbers of cases documented in the veterinary literature, (1) pemphigus vulgaris appears to be a severe disease that is often fatal and, even with treatment, many animals fail to respond and are euthanized, (2) pemphigus foliaceus is less severe but, without therapy, may be fatal, and (3) pemphigus erythematosus and panepidermal pustular or pemphigus vegetans are usually benign disorders that rarely produce systemic signs and readily respond to treatment.P\" 47. 59 Because the prognosis and treatment for the different forms varies, it is important to make a specific diagnosis. Suspect drug-induced cases of pemphigus may not require prolonged therapy and seem more likely to allow treatment to be permanently discontinued after remission has been maintained for 6 months. Too few cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus have been described to allow comment, though this condition carries a very poor prognosis in humans.\n\nTherapy of canine and feline pemphigus is often difficult, requiring large doses of systemic glucocorticoids with or without other potent immunomodulating drugs. 47, 55, 163, 164 Side effects of these drugs are common, varying from mild to severe, and close physical and hematologic monitoring of the patient is critical. Additionally, therapy must usually be maintained for prolonged periods, if not for life. Thus, the therapeutic regimen must be individualized for each patient, and owner education is essential.\n\nLarge doses of glucocorticoids (2 to 6 mglkg prednisone orally q24h in dogs; 4 to 8 mglkg prednisone q24h in cats) induce remission in most patients. However, severe glucocorticoid side effects and the inability to achieve safe alternate-day maintenance regimens render these drugs unacceptable in at least 50% of cases. In our referral dermatology practices, only 30% to 40% of cases are adequately controlled with glucocorticoids alone.\n\nWhen glucocorticoids are ineffective or undesirable, other immunomodulating drugs can be used in an attempt to reduce the dosage or eliminate the need for glucocorticoids. Azathioprine is often the drug of choice in this situation in dogs. Azathioprine should be used either not at all or very cautiously in cats, because even small doses (1 mglkg orally q48h) may produce fatal leukopenia or thrombocytopenta.P' Chlorambucil is effective in dogs and cats and is the preferred treatment in the cat. 154 Chrysotherapy (use of gold salts) is also useful, especially in cats and cases that cannot be controlled with azathioprine and prednisone. Pv 36. 47.132, 156 In animals in which significant nasal depigmentation has occurred and photodermatitis has become an aggravating factor, photoprotection is an important therapeutic adjunct,55, 153a, 163, 164 Avoidance of sunlight between 8 AM and 5 PM is helpful. The use of sunscreens containing para-aminobenzoic acid with high sun-protective factor values (SPF 15 or greater) is mandatory. Sunscreens should be applied 1 to 2 hours before sun exposure is anticipated and reapplied every 3 to 4 hours.\n\nOther drugs that may be useful in individual cases include dapsone (with great caution in cats at 1 mglkg q24h), vitamin E, tetracycline/niacinamide, and products containing omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids (see Chap. 3). The use of pentoxifylline for inhibiting autoimmune diabetes mellitus in mice suggests its concurrent use may be warranted in unresponsive cases of pemphlgus.v\" Given the recent interest in diet-induced pemphigus in humans.\"? perhaps veterinarians should consider a restricted diet trial (paying particular attention to thiols, isothiocyanates, phenols, and tannins) in dogs and cats with refractory cases of pemphigus. One of us (D.W.S.) has received anecdotal reports of success with diet modification in dogs.\n\nPemphigus vulgariS has been reported in dogs and cats and appears to be the second rarest form of pemphigus.P: 147. 164. 166 In a general and specialty dermatology practice, it accounted for less than 0.1% of cases. 122 In humans and dogs, the major pemphigus vulgaris antigen is desmoglein III, a 130-kd glycoprotein from the cadherin group of adhesion molecules.l\" 11B, 126, 141, 142, 16B In more severe cases that also have cutaneous involvement, antibodies to desmoglein I are also present in humans and are pathogenic.I'\" 125.\n\nThe exact antigen in the feline has not been specifically identtfled.P No age, breed, or sex predilections have been reported. Pemphigus vulgaris is a vesiculobullous, erosive to ulcerative disorder that may affect the oral cavity, mucocutaneous junctions (lips, nostrils, eyelids, prepuce, vulva, anus), skin, or any combination thereof ( Fig. 9-2A to D). About 75% to 90% of affected animals have oral cavity lesions at the time of diagnosis, and oral cavity involvement is the initial sign in about 50%.47, 122 Such animals often present for halitosis or excessive salivation. Cutaneous lesions occur most commonly in the axillae and groin. The Nikolsky sign may be present. The clawbed may be involved, resulting in ulcerative paronychia and onychomadesis. This may be the only presenting sign. 122, 162 Pemphigus vulgaris limited to the skin is rare. 151, 162 Pruritus and pain are variable, and secondary bacterial pyoderma and lymphadenopathy may be present. Severely affected animals may be anorectic, depressed, or febrile.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris includes bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction, candidiasis, idiopathic ulcerative dermatitis (vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus) of collies and Shetland sheepdogs, epitheliotropic lymphoma, and the numerous causes of canine and feline ulcerative stomatitis.\n\nThe definitive diagnOSiS of pemphigus vulgaris is based on history, physical examination, direct smears, biopsy, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing, and demonstration of the antigen being targeted (desmoglein III). Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized histologically by suprabasilar acantholysis with resultant cleft and vesicle formation (Fig. 9_3) .22, 71, 163 Basal epidermal cells remain attached to the basement membrane zone like a row of tombstones ( Fig. 9-4) . The dermal inflammatory reaction may be scant and perivascular (cell-poor) or prominent and interstitial to lichenoid (cellrich).\n\nPemphigus vulgaris appears to carry the poorest prognosis of this group. In a report of eight canine cases, only two patients were kept in remission over 1.5 years; three died or were euthanized, and three were lost to follow-up.P' It has been suggested, and we agree, that these cases should initially be treated aggressively with high-dose prednisone and azathioprine.\" Without treatment, this disorder may be fatal,163, 164 and it tends to be the most difficult form to put into and keep in remission. Systemic glucocorticoids alone or in combination with azathioprine are the initial treatments of choice in dogs, whereas systemic glucocorticoids alone or in combination with chlorambucil are preferred in cats. Combination therapy is usually required. Heparin (100 IU/kg q12h subcutaneously) was shown to have at least a temporary beneficial effect in one medically resistant case of pemphigus vulgaris.151\n\nPemphigus vegetans has been reported in the dog but is considered to be extremely rare. 160. 164 In 1998, it was suggested that these cases represent the newly proposed variant, panepidermal pustular pemphigus, though some clinical features were different.s? No age, breed, or sex predilections are apparent. Pemphigus vegetans is a vesiculopustular disorder that evolves into verrucous vegetations and papillomatous proliferations, which ooze and are studded with pustules (see Fig. 9 -2E and F). The Nikolsky sign may be present. Pruritus and pain are variable, and the dogs are usually otherwise healthy. Pemphigus vegetans is thought to represent a more benign or abortive form of pemphigus vulgaris in an animal that has more resistance to the disease.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans includes bacterial and fungal granulomas, benign familial chronic pemphigus, and cutaneous neoplasia (especially lyrnphoreticular neoplasia and mast cell tumor).\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans is based on history, physical examination, direct smears, biopsy, and immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing.\n\nPemphigus vegetans is characterized histopathologically by papillated epidermal hyperplasia, papillomatosis, and intraepidermal microabscesses that predominantly contain eosinophils and acantholytic keratinocytes (Figs. 9-5 and 9-6).71, 160. 163 \n\nToo few cases of pemphigus vegetans have been described for specific recommendations to be made, but initially, systemic glucocorticoids would be indicated. In one report, three cases were mentioned and all responded readily to tapering dosages of glucocorticoids. 36 If glucocorticoids are not effective, azathioprine would be added.\n\nIn a 1991 report, 16 cases of putative pemphigus vegetans were described.v\" To us, however, many of the dogs in these cases appeared to have \"deep\" pemphigus erythematosus or pemphigus foliaceus. The diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans was based on histopathology because of the presence of pustules in the epidermis and follicular infundibula. Dunstanv? has referred to this group as having pemphigus vegetans/erythematosus and considers this entity more similar to human pemphigus vegetans, Hallopeau type. He and others'?\" have proposed the name panepidermal pustular pemphigus. One case evaluated immunopathologically had autoantibodies against desmoglein I, similar to pemphigus foliaceus.l'\" Based on the clinical findings and limited immunopathologic studies, this entity cannot be distinctly characterized. We still believe that these dogs simply have pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus erythematosus.\n\nPemphigus foliaceus is the most common form of pemphigus and is perhaps the most common immune-mediated dermatosis in dogs and cats. 55 . 120. 121. 129. 133. 13.5. 147. 1.56 It has been reported to account for as high as 1% to 1.5% of all cases at a dermatology referral practice or as low as 0.04% of the hospital canine population.\" The major pemphigus foliaceus antigen is desmoglein I, a 150-kd glycoprotein from the cadherin group of adhesion molecules. 59 . 141 The same antigen is the target of the autoantibodies in the dog. 138. 168 No age or sex predilections have been reported. In dogs, Akitas, Chow Chows, Dachshunds, Bearded collies, Newfoundlands, Doberman pinschers, the Finnish spitz, and Schipperkes may be predisposed.P 135 The mean age of onset is about 4 years, with 65% of the affected dogs experiencing disease at 5 years or less. 135 Pemphigus foliaceus is characterized by pustular dermatitis (see Fig. 9 -2G). This is an important differentiation from human pemphigus foliaceus, which starts with erythema and vesicles and may progress to pustules. Canine and feline pemphigus foliaceus does not have a vesicular phase-it is a pustular, crusting disease.\n\nThree forms of pemphigus foliaceus appear to exist in the canine. 131 The first is spontaneous canine pemphigus foliaceus. Akitas and Chow Chows may be prone to this form. The disease develops in dogs with no previous history of skin disease or drug exposure. The second form, drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus, may be more common in Labrador retrievers and Doberman pinschers. Drug-induced pemphigus is becoming more frequently recognized, with several cases associated with the administration of trimethoprtm/sulfonamides.\" The third form occurs in dogs with a history of chronic skin disease. These dogs often have had one or more years of usually pruritic or allergic skin disease. They suddenly experience \"more severe disease with new features\" that ends up being diagnosed as pemphigus foliaceus. These dogs with chronic, disease-associated pemphigus foliaceus often have been exposed to multiple drugs, so their-disease may occasionally be drug-induced, though a cause-and-effect relationship is not obvious, nor does the eruption go away when the drugs are stopped. No seasonality or environmental risk factors were found in a study of pemphigus foliaceus in dogs and cats. 152 Pemphigus foliaceus usually begins on the face and ears ( Fig. 9 -7B); it commonly involves the feet, clawbeds, footpads (villous hyperkeratosis or \"hard pad\") (see Fig. 9 -7C to E), and groin and becomes multifocal or generalized (see Fig. 9 -7A) within 6 months in many animals. Very early lesions consist of erythematous macules that rapidly progress through a pustular phase (see Fig. 9 -2G) and end up as dry, yellow or honey-colored to brown crusts (see Fig. 9 -2H). There are usually scales, alopecia, and erosions bordered by epidermal collarettes. The Nikolsky sign may be present. Mucocutaneous orientation is uncommon, and oral cavity involvement is very rare. Some dogs and cats with pemphigus foliaceus present with only footpad lesions and may be lame.U\" 134 Paronychia and involvement of the nipples are common in cats. 132 Various claw abnormalities (onychodystrophy, onychorrhexis, onychogryposis) occasionally occur in dogs. Nasal depigmentation is common and may result in photodermatitis (see the following discussion of pemphigus erythematosus). Pruritus and pain are variable, and secondary bacterial pyoderma and peripheral lymphadenopathy may be present. Severely affected animals may be anorectic, depressed, or febrile. The disease commonly has a waxing/waning course. There may be hours to days when numerous new pustules form, followed by days to weeks of crusting during which few new lesions are found.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus includes bacterial folliculitis, dermatophytosis, demodicosis, dermatophilosis, seborrheic skin disease, benign familial chronic pemphigus, pemphigus erythematosus, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and cutaneous adverse drug reaction. Dermatophytosis can mimic the histopathology as well as the clinical findings (see Chap. 5) . 153 In addition, pemphigus foliaceus could be confused with subcorneal pustular dermatosis, sterile eosinophilic pustulosis, linear IgA pustular dermatosis, necrolytic migratory erythema, leishmaniasis, and zincresponsive dermatitis.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus is based on history, physical examination, direct smears, skin biopsy, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing, and demonstration of the antigen being targeted (desmoglein I). Pemphigus foliaceus is characterized histologically by intragranular or sub corneal acantholysis with resultant cleft and vesicle or pustule formation (Figs. 9-8 and 9_9).22. 71, 164 Within the vesicle or pustule, cells from the stratum granulosum may be attached to the overlying stratum corneum (granular cell \"cling-ens\") ( Fig. 9-lOA and B) . Either neutrophils or eosinophils may predominate within the vesicle or pustule. Other helpful histopathologic findings in canine and feline pemphigus foliaceus are (1) eosinophilic exocytosis and microabscess formation within the epidermis or follicular outer root sheath or both, (2) frequent involvement of the follicular outer root sheath in the acantholytic and pustular process, and (3) acantholytic, dyskeratotic granular epidermal cells (\"grains\") at the surface of erosions ( Fig. 9-11 ).\n\nThe initial treatment of choice for pemphigus foliaceus depends on the clinical presentation. Milder localized cases may be treated with topical steroids, whereas more extensive disease is usually treated with oral prednisone. 156, 164 The induction dose should be maintained until the disease is inactive, though alopecia and residual crusts may be present. After induction, the dosage is tapered to an alternate-day regimen. In cats, patients failing to respond to prednisone may respond to dexamethasone (0.2 to 0.4 mglkg q24h) or triamcinolone (0.4 to 0.8 mglkg q24h) and can be safely maintained by administration of either product every second or third day. It has been suggested that oral triamcinolone may be superior to prednisone and prednisolone; however, this needs to be evaluated.P! Oral glucocorticoids are ineffective or unsatisfactory in at least 50% of cases. In the dog, the next most common treatment is the addition of azathioprine for combination immunosuppressive therapy. In the cat, chlorambucil or chrysotherapy is used. If dogs do not respond to azathioprine and glucocorticoids, gold salt injections may be warranted, but only after waiting for 4 weeks after discontinuing the azathioprine.\" It has been stated that about 10% of patients with canine and feline pemphigus foliaceus fail to respond to any treatment and are euthanized.P\"\n\nPemphigus erythematosus is thought to represent a more benign form of pemphigus foliaceus.!\" 128. 164 Some workers have also suggested it may represent a crossover syndrome between pemphigus and lupus erythematosus because of histopathologic and immunopathologic findings. It has also been suggested to be a mild form of pemphigus foliaceus. The antigen target has not been definitely identified in humans or dogs though, in humans, it is believed to be similar to pemphigus foliaceus.!\" 59 Pemphigus erythematosus has been reported in dogs and cats. 5 ,5, 161, 164 No age or sex predilections are known. In dogs, collies and German shepherds may be predisposed. 55 This disease has been considered to be photoaggravated in some cases, similar to canine discoid lupus erythematosus. This was confirmed in a study demonstrating in vivo and in vitro sensitivity to UVB. 139 Pemphigus erythematosus is characterized by erythematous, pustular dermatitis of the face and ears (see Fig. 9 -7F). Because the primary lesions are transient, dogs and cats typically present with oozing crusts, scales, alopecia, and erosions bordered by epidermal collarettes. The Nikolsky sign is infrequently present. Pruritus and pain are variable. The disease involves, and is often limited to, the facial/nasal region. The nose frequently becomes depigmented, whereupon photodermatitis becomes an aggravating factor (see If the nasal region is primarily involved, the condition is often worse in sunny weather and the dog may be misdiagnosed as having nasal solar dermatitis (\"collie nose\"). Often the depigmentation is an early sign in pemphigus erythematosus. This is in contrast with pemphigus foliaceus, wherein the depigmentation comes later. In addition, the crusting is often milder than what occurs in pemphigus foliaceus. Oral cavity involvement has not been reported, and affected animals are usually otherwise healthy. Occasional animals have isolated skin lesions distant from the face and ears, such as on the paws or genitalia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus includes bacterial folliculitis, dermatophytosis, demodicosis, benign familial chronic pemphigus, facial pemphigus foliaceus, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, drug reaction, leishmaniasis, and zinc-responsive dermatitis.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus is based on history, physical examination, direct smears, skin biopsy, and immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing. Pemphigus erythematosus is histologically identical to pemphigus foliaceus, except that it often has a lichenoid cellular infiltrate of mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and neutrophils or eosinophils or both ( Fig. 9-12 ). Immunopathologically these cases may have a low positive antinuclear antibody titer and basement membrane immunoglobulin deposition. 55 The initial therapeutic options for pemphigus erythematosus are different than for most immune-mediated diseases. This is an important reason to try to establish a definitive diagnosis rather than just a diagnosis of \"pemphigus.\"\n\nPemphigus erythematosus may initially be treated with sun avoidance and topical glucocorticoids. In dogs, the combination of tetracycline and niacinamide is effective in up to 25% of cases. If this combination is not effective, vitamin E, then a short course of systemic glucocorticoids, may be added to the regimen. Once in remission, the initial therapeutic protocols may be effective in keeping the disease in remission. Topical cyclosporine has also been helpful in some cases.\n\nThis form of pemphigus was first characterized in humans in 1990 and recently described in dogs. 123. 125. 143. 171 The diagnostic criteria established in humans include severe oral ulceration with polymorphous skin eruptions; histology that includes intraepithelial acantholysis, keratinocyte apoptosis, and vacuolar interface changes; direct immunofluorescence testing findings that include the intercellular deposition of IgG within the epithelium and C3 in a granular pattern along the basement membrane zone; and indirect immunofluorescence findings that include IgG deposition in the intercellular spaces on monkey esophagus and rodent urinary bladder.F\" The immunofluorescence findings on rodent urinary bladder have a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 75%; thus, false-positive and false-negative results OCCUr. 15. 5 Immunoprecipitation studies are needed to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the characteristic antigen complex: desmoplakins I (250 kd) and II (210 kd), bullous pemphigoid antigen I (230 kd), envoplakin (210 kd), periplakin (190 kd) , desmoglein III (130 kd), and an unidentified (170 kd) transmembrane antigen. 155 Antibodies from human patients reproduce the cutaneous lesions when injected into newborn mice.P?\n\nThe pathogenesis of paraneoplastic pemphigus is unknown. It has been hypothesized that antitumor immune responses cross-react with normal epithelial proteins, perhaps associated with anomalous expression of desmosomes and/or desmoplakins by the neoplasms and/or dysregulated cytokine production (e.g., IL-6) by neoplastic cells. 155 Autoantibodies against desmoglein III and the 170-kd protein probably initiate acantholysis and cell membrane damage, resulting in autoantibody formation against desmoplakins. The antidesmoplakin antibodies then enter keratinocytes and bind target autoantigens by an epitope-spreading phenomenon.\n\nA canine case was shown to have three serum autoantibodies important in human paraneoplastic pemphigus: antibodies that recognize the 21O-kd, 190-kd, and 170-kd proteins. 125 The best documented canine case had a concurrent lymphoma.r'\" Two cases of pemphigus foliaceus were suspected to be paraneoplastic pemphigus. One was associated with a Sertoli cell tumor,'?' the other was associated with a mammary carcinoma.V' In humans, paraneoplastic pemphigus is usually associated with malignancies, especially lymphomas (Table 9 -2).1 55 Unless the associated neoplasm can be cured, immunosuppressive therapy is not very effective. 155 \n\nThe classification of autoimmune blistering diseases is based on the antigen(s) targeted by pathogenic autoantibodies. The autoimmune subepidermal bullous diseases represent different nosologic entities. 18, 51, 185, 191 Studies conducted by Olivry and colleagues have demonstrated that canine subepidermal bullous diseases include bullous pemphigoid (autoantibodies against bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 [Type XVII collagen]), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (autoantibodies against Type VII collagen), bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (IgG autoantibodies against the noncollagenous aminoterminus of Type VII collagen), linear IgA bullous dermatosis (IgA and IgG autoantibodies against the extracellular portion of bullous pemphigoid antigen 2, from which the intracellular, transmembrane, and NCI6A domains have been removed by proteolysis), and mucous membrane pemphigold (autoantibodies against a 97-kd antigen-possibly the C-terminus of bullous pemphi-gOid antigen 2-in the lower lamina lucida). 51, 183, 191 These entities are similar clinically, histopathologically, and on routine immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing. However, they are different diseases, and studies of larger numbers of cases may reveal important prognostic and therapeutic differences.\n\nThe use of salt-split skin as a substrate for indirect immunofluorescence testing is a practical contribution to the study of autoimmune subepidermal bullous diseases. 175, 191 A l-molar solution of NaCl splits skin through the lamina lucida, allowing the recognition of autoantibodies that bind to the roof (epidermal), floor (dermal), or combined both sides of the split.\n\nBullous pemphigoid is a very rare autoimmune, vesiculobullous, ulcerative disorder of skin or oral mucosa or both that has been reported in dogs, cats, and humans.I\" 47, 180, 184, 185 It has been reported to account for 0.01% to 0.1% of all canine dermatology cases. 56, 59 However, it should be noted that the majority of reported cases were diagnosed on the basis of clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings, not on the basis of the specific antigen being targeted. It is likely that some of these cases were not true bullous pemphigoid as determined by the presence of autoantibodies to specific bullous pemphigoid antigens. Olivry has studied the immunopathology and antigen targeting of 20 dogs with subepidermal blistering diseases: Only 15% had true bullous pemphigoid, suggesting that this disease is even rarer than previously thought. 183\n\nBullous pemphigoid is characterized histologically by subepidermal vesicle formation and immunologlcally by the presence of one or two autoantibodies against antigens at the basal cell hemidesmosomes of skin and mucosa.v 18 The bullous pemphigoid antigens are present in all mammalian and avian skin and are associated with hemidesmosomes and the lamina lucida of the basement membrane.P-179\n\nThe first antigen is bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAg 1, BP230), which is a 230-kd intracellular antigen that is a homolog to desmoplakin J.l8, 188 Serum antibodies to this antigen have not yet been described in animals. The second bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAg 2, BPI80), also called collagen XVII, is a I80-kd hemidesmosomal transmembranous molecule.l'\" In humans, circulating IgE and IgG4 autoantibodies are the major immunoglobulins preferentially targeting two distinct epitopes on BPI80, and the levels of these autoantibodies parallel disease activity.178a Canine and feline cases of bullous pemphigoid exhibit antibodies to this latter molecule.P\" 177, 184, 185 The cause of antibody production is still unknown, but genetic factors have been determined in humans and dogs.\n\nThe proposed pathomechanism of blister formation in bullous pemphigoid is as follows: (1) the binding of complement-fixing pemphigoid antibody to the antigen of the hemidesmosomes, (2) complement fixation and activation, (3) activation of mast cells and release of chemotactic cytokines, (4) chemoattraction of neutrophils and eosinophils, and (5) release of proteolytic enzymes from the infiltrating leukocytes, which disrupt derma-epidermal cohesion, resulting in derma-epidermal separation and vesicle formation.f 18. 47. 176 In humans, elevated concentrations of eosinophil cationic protein, major basic protein, and neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase and elastase were detected in blister fluid and serum of patients with bullous pemphigoid, suggesting that the release of these substances from activated granulocytes may be important in the pathogenesis of blister formation.F\" An eosinophil-derived enzyme, gelatinase, may be involved in cleaving the Type XVII collagen. 177. 187 Human pemphigoid antibodies, when injected into rabbit cornea or guinea pig skin, locally produce the clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features of bullous pemphigoid.\" 18 Other factors thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of some cases of bullous pemphigoid are drug provocation (especially sulfonamides, penicillins, and furosemide) and ultraviolet light. 5. 18. 157. 186 Bullous pemphigoid-like drug eruptions have been reported in dogs, though the exact antigenic target was not determined and these cases may not have been true bullous pemphigoid. 268. 269. 282 Clinical variants occur in humans, and their differentiation is proceeding based on the more advanced methods of detecting target antigens. The past confusion and overlap between some of these \"variants\" -such as cicatricial pemphigoid and herpes gestationis, which do share, at least partially, the target antigens noted in bullous pemphigoid-are beginning to be worked out. 181. 188. 190 This also is the case in the canine, wherein Olivry's group has recognized mucous membrane pemphigoid. This disease has been known as cicatricial pemphigoid in humans and is still the name preferred by some investigators.P? Mucous membrane pemphigoid is one of the most common forms of autoimmune basement membrane zone disease in dogs. 183 It is phenotypically distinct, yet immunologically heterogeneous, as in humans. Six cases of mucous membrane pemphigoid have been recognized in dogs: four of them exhibited antibodies against the NC16A domain of BP180 and one of them had antibodies against the C-terminus of BP180. 183\n\nBullous pemphigoid is very rare in the dog, accounting for about 0.1% of all canine skin disorders at one university small animal clinic'\" and 0.01% of all canine dermatology cases at another.59 Canine bullous pemphigoid has no reported age or sex predilections, although collies and, perhaps, Doberman pinschers appear to be predisposed to it, 47. 182. 186 The disease in collies and shelties must be separated from so-called ulcerative dermatosis of collies and Shetland sheepdogs (probably vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosusl.P\" Bullous pemphigoid is a vesiculobullous, ulcerative disorder that may affect the oral cavity, mucocutaneous junctions, skin, or any combination thereof ( Fig. 9-13A and B). About 80% of affected dogs have oral cavity lesions at the time of diagnosis. In Olivry's confirmed cases of canine bullous pemphigoid, only one third exhibited oral involvement, which is in contrast with cases of canine mucous membrane pemphigoid that exhibit consistent mucosal involvement with no or minimal skin lesions.l'\" Oral cavity involvement has been recognized either after or at the same time as the cutaneous signs and rarely as the initial event. Cutaneous lesions occur most commonly in the axillae and groin, also the common sites for vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus of collies and Shetland sheepdogs. Ulcerative paronychia, onychomadesis, or footpad ulceration may occur.\n\nAn insidious, chronic, clinically benign form of cutaneous bullous pemphigoid has been recognized in dogs, with lesions confined to the axillae, groin, or isolated mucocutaneous areas such as the anus and prepuce.f\" 186 Cases of bullous pemphigoid may be severe and clinically indistinguishable from pemphigus vulgaris and other subepidermal blistering diseases. In true bullous pemphigoid, the vesicles and bullae are less fragile and transient than those occurring in vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus of collies and sheepdogs.l'\" In contrast with the flaccid blisters of pemphigus vulgaris, the blisters of bullous pemphigoid are tense. 183 The presence of intact vesicles or bullae is more suggestive of subepidermal bullous diseases and, with further study, we will hopefully be able to better clinically differentiate these diseases. When vesicles and bullae have ruptured, the clinician sees ulcers bordered by epithelial collarettes. The pseudo-Nikolsky sign may be present.\n\nPruritus and pain are variable, and secondary bacterial pyoderma is common. Severely affected dogs may be anorectic, depressed, or febrile and may die because of fluid, electrolyte, and protein imbalances and septicemia.\n\nResults of routine laboratory determinations (hemogram, serum chemistries, urinalysis, serum protein electrophoresis) are nonspecific, often revealing mild to moderate leukocytosis and neutrophilia, mild nonregenerative anemia, mild hypoalbuminemia, and mild to moderate elevations of a 2 , f3, and 'Y globulins.55. 186 Peripheral eosinophilia is rare. 55. 186\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes pemphigus vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, idiopathic ulcerative dermatosis (vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus) of collies and Shetland sheepdogs, drug reaction, epitheliotropic lymphoma, candidiasis, and the numerous causes of canine ulcerative stomatitis. Definitive diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is based on history, physical examination, skin (or mucosal) biopsy, demonstration of basement membrane fixed autoantibodies, and circulating antibodies that target the bullous pemphigoid antigens. Microscopic examination of direct smears from intact vesicles, bullae, or recent ulcers does not reveal acantholytic keratinocytes.\n\nBullous pemphigoid is characterized histologically by subepidermal cleft and vesicle formation (Figs. 9-14 and 9_15).18.22.47, 186 Acantholysis does not occur. Inflammatory infiltrates vary from mild and perivascular to marked and lichenoid ( Fig. 9-16 ). Tissue eosinophilia is common in canine bullous pemphigoid. In contrast, cases of mucous membrane pemphigoid have noninflammatory blisters, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita cases have neutrophil-rich vesicles.P\" 191 Feline bullous pemphigoid has only a few eosinophils. 184 Subepidermal vacuolar alteration (subepidermal \"bubblies\") has been suggested as the earliest prevesicle histopathologic finding.\" Olivry thinks that the first lesion of canine bullous pemphigoid might be eosinophil degranulation at the basement membrane zone ( Fig. 9 -17 ) .1 83\n\nElectron-microscopic examination of pemphigoid lesions has revealed the following features: smudging, thickening, and interruption of the basement membrane zone; fragmentation and disappearance of anchoring fibrils, anchoring filaments, and hemidesmosomes; basal cell degeneration; and separation occurring within the lamina lucida.f\" 186 Direct immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing reveals a linear deposition of immunoglobulin, and usually complement, at the basement membrane zone of skin or mucosa in 50% to 90% of patients (see Fig. 9-1C) . 5, 18, 55, 186 However, this is not specific for bullous pemphigoid. Complement component C3 is the most commonly demonstrated immunoreactant. The presence of IgG is expected.P\" 184. 185 It would appear to be important to test with all classes of immunoglobulins, because in some dogs, results are positive for only IgM or IgA (though in light of the more recent studies, these cases may not have truly been bullous pemphigoid). It is also important to sample intact vesicles and bullae as well as perilesional tissue. Indirect immunofluorescence testing frequently yielded negative results in the past, though a definitive diagnosis should include the demonstration of circulating IgG autoantibodies to the bullous pemphigoid antigen(s).180,185 In one study, the IgG subtypes were predominantly IgG2 or IgG4,13 \n\nThe natural course of untreated cases is unclear. Veterinarians have long recognized refractory mucocutaneous ulcerative disorders that resulted in the death or euthanasia of affected dogs. Retrospectively, some of these dogs may have had bullous pemphigoid. On the basis of the small number of cases documented in the veterinary literature, canine bullous pemphigoid is usually a severe disease. The prognosis for true bullous pemphigoid is not yet established, but it appears to be a more localized and more benign disease than epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.P\" Extensive cases may be fatal unless treated. Therapy of canine bullous pemphigoid may be difficult, requiring large doses of systemic glucocorticoids with or without other potent immunomodulating drugs. In one study of nine dogs with subepidermal blistering disease believed to be bullous pemphigoid.l'\" the following observations were made: 1 mglkg prednisolone, given orally q12h, was ineffective for controlling the disease, and 3 mglkg prednisolone, given orally q 12h, was effective for controlling the disease. Two of the nine dogs requiring the larger dose were euthanized, however, because of unacceptable side effects, and another two died after 7 to 10 days of therapy (from acute pancreatitis). Thus, systemic glucocorticoids were unsatisfactory for treatment in four of nine dogs (44%). Suspected bullous pemphigoid cases have, in our experience, usually required combinations of immunosuppressive agents. One case (seen by GE.G.) even required glucocorticoids, azathioprine, and chlorambucil to be kept in remission. Therapy usually must be maintained for prolonged periods if not for life. Thus, the therapeutic regimen must be individualized for each patient, and owner education is essential. Mild cases of canine bullous pemphigoid may be successfully managed with topical glucocorticoids or relatively low doses of systemic glucocorticoids (2.2 mg/kg/day of prednisolone or prednisone orally for induction), and therapy may occasionally even be terminated. 55, 186 Tetracycline and erythromycin have been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of bullous pemphigoid in humans.l\" 189 It is thought that the benefit derived from these drugs is related to their ability to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis and random migration and to increase dermo-epidermal cohesion and inhibit proteases that might be involved in blister formation.\n\nBecause (1) cutaneous lesions of bullous pemphigoid in humans can be induced by exposure to ultraviolet light and (2) canine bullous pemphigoid may worsen with exposure to ultraviolet light, it may be prudent to avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 8 AM and 5 PM. 18 , 47, 186 The limited number of identified cases of true canine bullous pemphigoid have not been photosensittve.l'\" Until a definitive diagnosis is made, sun avoidance still should be recommended.\n\nEpidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a subepidermal blistering disease. It is thought to be one of the most common causes of autoimmune subepidermal blistering in dogs (25% of the cases).183 In humans, it is an acquired autoimmune disease that was clinically similar to the childhood form of epidermolysis bullosa-hence the name-even though it is not hereditary or a disease typically found in children.l'\" It is characterized by the chronic development of subepidermal blisters that may be induced by trauma and by fragile skin. In humans, the epidermal separation was similar to that of bullous pemphigoid, and even direct immunofluorescence test findings were similar.l'\" Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the antibody deposits to be located at the anchoring fibrils, separating this disease from bullous pemphigoid. Subsequent studies have shown that the autoantibodies target type VII collagen within the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane zone.l'\"\n\nA case of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita was described in a L-year-old, intact male Great Dane that experienced an acute onset and rapid progression of skin lesions.l'\" There was generalized urticaria, vesiculation, and cutaneous sloughing, resulting in ulcers. Ulcerations were most pronounced in the oral cavity ( Fig. 9-18 ) and on the footpads. The dog was also febrile and lethargic. Treatment with prednisone (5 mglkglday), antibiotics, and dapsone was not satisfactory, so euthanasia was performed at the owner's request. Histopathology and collagen IV staining revealed that the subepidermal vesicles were occurring in the sublamina densa ( Fig. 9-19) . A mild, bandlike infiltrate of neutrophils and lymphocytes was visible at the base of subepidermal vesicles. In more severe lesions, neutrophil microabscesses were visible in the superficial dermis. Direct immunofluorescence testing revealed IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3 at the basement membrane zone. Indirect immunofluorescence testing (IgG and IgA at the basement membrane zone of dog lip and tongue, but not with monkey esophagus), indirect protein A immunogold electron microscopy, Western immunoblotting, and recombinant collagen VII-NCI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were all used to confirm that the autoantibodies targeted collagen VII in the anchoring fibrils. 191 \u2022 192a Olivry has recognized four more cases, and four of the five dogs exhibited a generalized phenotype that did not respond to treatment.l'\" One dog had a localized variant (predominantly head region) that responded completely to prednisone (2 mglkglday), thus resembling the Brunsting-Perry epidermolysis bullosa acquisita in humans.P\"\n\nA 3-year-old, spayed female mongrel dog was presented for vesicles, erosions, ulcers, and crusts on the lips, pinnae, axillae, sternum, groin, extremities, footpads, and tongue.51 Histologic examination revealed mixed inflammatory, hemorrhagic, subepidermal vesicles. Circulating IgA and IgG autoantibodies targeted the 120-kd linear IgA bullous dermatosis antigen (LAD-I) in the upper lamina lucida.\n\nA l-year-old, intact male Australian shepherd was presented for vesicles, erosions, and crusts on the periorbital, perinasal, and pinnal skin as well as the oral mucosa.\" Histologic examination revealed large subepidermal vesicles and focal neutrophilic subepidermal microabscesses. Circulating IgG autoantibodies targeted a 97-kd antigen in the lower lamina lucida.\n\nLupus erythematosus is a term that encompasses a group of diseases that have different clinical syndromes that share a similar underlying autoimmune process.s!\" The appropriate terminology and classification of the syndromes and cases with these disorders have led to, regulate cell proliferation and downregulate bcl-2) and a marked decrease in bcl-2 (a protein that promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis). It was hypothesized that basal keratinocytes, damaged by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, become hyperproliferative (thus expressing Ki-67), which induces the expression of p53 which, in tum, downregulates bcl-2 and activates an apoptotic pathway in the epidermis.\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is the most severe form of the lupus diseases because it involves more than cutaneous lesions and may present with a wide array of clinical symptoms that reflect multiple organ or tissue damage.\n\nThe etiology of systemic lupus erythematosus appears to be multifactorial, with genetic predilection, immunologic disorder (T cell deficiency, B cell hyperactivity, deficiencies of complement components), viral infection, and hormonal and ultraviolet light modulation all playing a role. 5, IB, 47, 193, 195, 199 , 20B B lymphocyte hyperactivity results in a plethora of autoantibodies formed against numerous body constituents. The most well-studied are the ANA, which are found in up to 100% of the cases reported. The study of these antibodies utilizing newer techniques, such as immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, has revealed that a number of nuclear components are targeted, including double-stranded DNA, histones, and extractable nuclear antigens. 195, 209, 220, 226 These latter may be more important in the dog and include a group of ribonuclear proteins (RNPs), the small nuclear RNP complexes (snRNPs), and heterogeneous nuclear RNPs (hnRNPs) .195,226 Studies in dogs with systemic lupus have showed that, in the active phase of disease, there is a marked lymphopenia that, though it affects both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, more severely involves CD8+ cells.P' This results in an altered (increased) CD4ICD8 ratio (mean of 6 with disease; mean of 2.3 in normals). The decrease in CD8+ T lymphocytes is directly related to disease severity, and an increase in these cells is associated with a good response to therapy. Additionally, the percentage of active phase T cells increases with successful treatment.P' This T cell imbalance persisted in cases of spontaneous inactivity or treated dogs that responded poorly but normalized in dogs that responded well to treatment.P'\n\nIn humans, a number of drugs (especially procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid, penicillamine, several anticonvulsants, and contraceptives) are known to precipitate or exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus.v IB Vaccination with a modified live virus product containing distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, and parvovirus antigens was suspected to have precipitated systemic lupus erythematosus in a dog. 47 Tissue damage in systemic lupus erythematosus appears to be due to a Type III hypersensitivity reaction. The New Zealand black mouse, the Fl hybrid of the New Zealand black mouse, and the New . Zealand white mouse experience a lupus-like disease that has many similarities to systemic lupus erythematosus in humans.v IB, 47, 216 In the dog, the serologic abnormalities associated with spontaneous canine systemic lupus erythematosus can be transmitted both to normal dogs and to mice by means of cell-free extracts, thus suggesting an infective agent. 25 , 47 As yet, however, none of these dogs has developed overt systemic lupus erythematosus, indicating that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis of the clinical entity. It has been reported that dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus have lower levels of circulating thymic factors than do normal dogs, analogous to the situation in humans. is, 47, 195 In a colony of dogs obtained by the mating of a male and female, each having systemic lupus erythematosus, the Fl generation had no clinical signs; with subsequent breeding, a few dogs in the F2 generation were affected; and clinical signs were common and marked in the F3 generation. 202 Affected dogs had depressed suppressor T cell activity, decreased levels of serum thymulin, and a decreased percentage of circulating T cells. 202\n\nIn the colony of dogs at Lyon, France, greater than 50% of the dogs are ANA carriers, and 25% to 30% of the dogs experience disease.P\" In the same colony, there is a strong association between dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) phenotypes and the occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus (DLA-A7 positively associated, DLA-Al and DLA-B5 negatively associatedl.P\" 222 A high incidence (47.6%) of ANA positivity was also found in an English Cocker spaniel breeding colony.l'\"\n\nThe clinical signs associated with systemic lupus erythematosus are varied and changeable. Because of this phenomenal clinical variability and ability to mimic numerous diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus has been called the \"great imitator.\"\n\n\u2022 Dog. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an uncommon disease in dogs. 25 , 47, 56, 217 The incidence has been estimated at 0.03% of the canine population. 195, 217 There is no age predilection (average, 5 years) and, at least in some studies, males have been overrepresented at a ratio of 7:3. 195 Breed predilections have also been described for collies, Shetland sheepdogs, Poodles, and German shepherd dogs. 47 , 195. 217 The most common manifestations are fever (constant or irregularly cyclic), polyarthritis (nonerosive, nondeforming), proteinuria (>0.5 gIL), and skin disease, being present in greater than 50% of cases.v- 195, 217 Consequent muscle wasting can make the dogs look much older than they are. Other relatively common manifestations include anemia, leukopenia, peripheral lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and oral ulcers.f\"- 195, 217 Other syndromes reported in association with canine systemic lupus erythematosus are pericarditis, thrombocytopenia, polymyositis, myocarditis, pneumonitis, pleuritis, neurologic disorders (seizures, meningitis, myelitis, psychoses, polyneuropathy), and lymphedema.\n\nThe cutaneous manifestations of canine systemic lupus erythematosus are extremely diverse. They include seborrheic skin disease, alopecia, diffuse or regional erythema, cutaneous or mucocutaneous vesiculobullous or ulcerative disorders, footpad ulcers and hyperkeratosis, discoid lupus erythematosus, refractory secondary bacterial pyodermas, panniculitis (lupus profundus), and nasal dermatitis (see Fig. 9 -13C, F to H). 47, 195, 217 Skin lesions may be multifocal or generalized and commonly involve areas of skin poorly protected by hair: face (especially nose, lips, pinnae if erect), limbs (especially cranial aspect of thoracic limbs), axillae, groin, and ventral abdomen. They may be exacerbated or induced by exposure to sunlight. Pruritus is variable, and scarring is common. Occasionally, dogs experience acute facial or hemifacial edema.\n\nA 4-year-old, castrated male Bichon Frise with systemic lupus erythematosus had erosions and ulcers of lips, external auditory meati, lateral thorax, axillae, prepuce, metatarsi, and footpads.s! 213 Histopathologic findings were early noninflammatory subepidermal blisters and late subepidermal vesicles with subjacent neutrophils. IgG autoantibodies against the noncollagenous aminoterminus of type VII collagen (bullous systemic lupus erythematosus antigen) were detected. It was suggested that this was analogous to socalled type I -bullous systemic lupus erythematosus in humans.\n\n\u2022 Cat. Systemic lupus erythematosus is rarely reported in cats. 56 , 214, 225 The incidence has been estimated to be 0.06% of all feline hospital visits. 214 There is no apparent sex predilection, and affected cats range from 1 to 12 years old. Siamese, Persian, and Himalayan cats may be predisposed. Syndromes reported include hematologic abnormalities, neurologic or behavioral abnormalities, fever, lymphadenopathy, polyarthritis, myopathy, oral ulceration, conjunctivitis, renal failure, and subclinical pulmonary disease.\n\nAbout 20% of affected cats have cutaneous lesions.56, 214, 225 Dermatologic abnormalities include seborrheic skin disease, exfoliative erythroderma, and erythematous, scaling, crusting, alopecic, scarring dermatitis most commonly involving the face (see Fig. 9-13D) , pinnae, and paws (see Fig. 9-13E ).\n\nThe differential diagnosis of cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus is lengthy, owing to the varied and changeable cutaneous manifestations of the disorder. Typical alternative diagnoses are seborrheic skin disease, dermatophytosis, bacterial folliculitis, demodicosis, food hypersensitivity, scabies, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, discoid lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme, necrolytic migratory erythema, leishmaniasis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, candidiasis, and epitheliotropic lymphoma.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is often one of the most challenging tasks in medicine. The disease is so variable in its clinicopathologic presentations that any dogmatic diagnostic categorization is impossible. The clinicopathologic abnormalities that are demonstrated depend on the organ systems involved and may include anemia (nonregenerative or hemolytic) with or without a positive direct Coombs' test result, thrombocytopenia with or without a positive platelet factor-3 test result or antiplatelet antibody, leukopenia or leukocytosis, proteinuria, hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal), and sterile synovial exudate obtained by arthrocentesis.f\": 205 A positive lupus-type anticoagulant test result was reported in a dog with hemolysis, pulmonary thromboembolism, nephrotic syndrome, polyarthropathy, and thrombocytopenia.P' The lupus erythematosus (LE) cell test may yield a positive result in up to 60% of patients, but it is variable from day to day, is steroid-labile, and lacks sensitivity and specificity. The assay has been discontinued in many of the leading laboratories in human medicine.f?\n\nThe ANA test is currently considered the most sensitive serologic test for systemic lupus erythematosus.Fv'\" 19,5,207 It yields a positive result in up to 100% of cases of active systemic lupus erythematosus. It is not the most specific of tests.f\" 207 yielding positive results in up to 20% of dogs with infectious diseases (particularly leishmaniasis) and up to 16% of control dogs. 195 In general, results from different laboratories cannot be compared. It is important to record the titer (and compare it with normals for the same laboratory; some normal dogs may have high titers) and the pattern of nuclear fluorescence. The homogeneous, then reticulonodular patterns are the most common in canine systemic lupus erythematosus, but titers and patterns appear to have little or no specificity in dogs and cats.f\" -195 Other authors indicate that the speckled and homogeneous ANA patterns are the most common in dogs with autoimmune connective tissue diseases.P\"\n\nThere is no clear, constant correlation between clinical disease activity and positive ANA titer, though there is usually a progressive decrease in titer with successful therapy. 47, 195, 204, 207, 223 Any decrease in ANA titer always occurs after clinical remission. It must be remembered that ANA can be detected from time to time with probably any disease as well as in healthy animals.f\" 195, 214 Thus, a positive ANA titer must always be interpreted in light of other critical historical, physical, and laboratory data.\n\nPreparations of the protozoan Crithidia luciliae have become commercially available for assaying patient sera for antibodies against native DNA. Large surveys employing this substrate in dogs and cats have not been reported, although preliminary reports indicate that the assay is rarely positive in dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus and in those with positive ANA titers.f? suggesting that dogs rarely form antibodies against native DNA. Positive results with this test occurred in a 6-year-old female Beauceron with systemic lupus erythematosus as well as in two of her female puppies. 198 The standard Farr test (radioimmunoassay) for the measurement of antinative DNA antibodies in humans is unsatisfactory in dogs, resulting in numerous false-positive results.?? Newer techniques employing specific reagents in an ELISA format did not reveal anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies but did detect IgG antibodies to the individual histones HI> H 2A, H 3, and H 209\n\nAbout 10% of human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are ANA-negative.l\" 47 These patients have unique anticytoplasmic antibodies (anti-Ro), which are not detected when traditional ANA test substrates (mouse or rat liver) are employed; as a result, special substrates (calf thymus, normal human lymphocytes, human epithelial tissue culture line) are needed for such patients. The importance of this autoantibody system in dogs and cats is unknown. It could, however, explain the negative ANA results occasionally obtained in dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus.vv'\"\n\nIn one study, sera from 131 dogs were evaluated for ANA and extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs), including the Ro ribonuclear protein antigen. 227 The ENA was only positive in 46% of the dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus, and none were Ropositive. ENAs were not specific for systemic lupus erythematosus, however, because results were positive in 5% of healthy dogs and 11% of dogs with other diseases. However, the newer techniques have shown that, in the dog, antihistone antibodies are positive in 65% and anti-ENA antibodies are detected in greater than 40% of cases . 195, 209, 227 In humans, antihistone autoantibodies have an association with drug-induced systemic lupus erythematcsus.F'? Two anti-ENA antibodies are highly specific for canine systemic lupus erythematosus: The anti-Sm antibodies are found in 16% of cases and anti-hnRNP G is found in 20% of cases (this autoantibody is not usually tested for in commercially available anti-ENA tests in human medicine).l95, 209 Another novel canine autoantibody, anti-hnRNP I, was found in a Schnauzer with polyarthritis.F? These studies demonstrate that dogs may manifest different autoantibodies than humans and that testing techniques may have to be adapted for the canine (and, presumably, the cat).\n\nInvestigators have attempted to better understand lupus erythematosus in humans by studying subsets of patients on the basis of one clinical characteristic (or set of them), histopathologic or immunopathologic findings, or serologic studies.S 18 The use of this subset approach may allow the clinician to gain insight into prognosis, improved therapy, or presumed pathogenesis. Currently, three subsets of cutaneous lupus erythematosus are recognized in humans: chronic cutaneous (discoid) lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Their recognition is important because the different probability of systemic disease does correlate with which autoantibodies are detected.v?\n\nThe suggestion that the disease previously described as idiopathic ulcerative dermato- of such subsets to the canine and feline diseases awaits further study. The dermatohistopathologic changes in systemic lupus erythematosus vary with the type of gross morphologic lesions and may be nondiagnosttc.l\" 22, 72, 217 The most characteristic finding is interface dermatitis (hydropic, lichenoid, or both), which may involve hair follicle outer root sheaths (Figs. 9-20 to 9-22). Apoptosis of basal and suprabasal cells may occur, and occasionally these apoptotic cells are associated with lymphocytic satellitosis/\" Other common findings are subepidermal vacuolar alteration (subepidermal bubblies), focal thickening of the basement membrane zone (Fig. 9-23) , and dermal mucinosis. Uncommon findings are intrabasal to subepidermal vesicles, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and lupus erythematosus panniculitis (see Chap. 18). In humans, these changes are often not present until the skin lesions are at least 6 weeks old.\n\nDirect immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing reveals the deposition of immunoglobulin, complement, or both at the basement membrane zone, often known as a positive lupus band, in 50% to 90% of patients.P-18. 47, 55, 217 The variability in positive results reflects differences in laboratory techniques, lesion selection (age and activity of lesion), previous or current glucocorticoid therapy, and possibly other factors. In addition, immunoreactants may be found at the basement membrane zone of skin in many other conditions, including sun-damaged skin.\n\nWe saw a case of canine solar dermatitis that was positive for basement membrane fluorescence. Though there is some controversy, positive lupus band tests from lesional skin are not considered very diagnostic. However, in humans, positive results from nonlesional sun-protected sites correlate well with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. 219 In dogs, C3 is the most commonly detected immunoreactant, with IgA and IgM being the most commonly detected immunoglobulins.56. 217 In humans, it is often possible to distinguish between systemic lupus erythematosus and discoid lupus erythematosus on the basis of direct immunofluorescence testing of lesional and sun-exposed normal skin. In human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, sun-exposed normal skin may have positive lupus bands in up to 60% of cases, whereas this rarely occurs in discoid lupus erythematosus.f 18 This criterion is of no value in the hairy dog and cat, wherein normal skin is usually negative. 56 . 217 In humans, it is recommended that (1) biopsies not be taken from edematous lesions (only about 47% of such lesions are positive), (2) biopsies be taken from lesions over 1 month old (only about 30% are positive if less than 1 month old), (3) skin with telangiectases not be sampled (17% of such lesions are positive, regardless of their etiology), and (4) all glucocorticoid and immunomodulating therapy be terminated, if possible, 3 weeks prior to biopsy.f 18.47 Because no single laboratory test is diagnostic for systemic lupus erythematosus, a number of groups have produced sets of classification criteria for making the diagnosis. 25 , 47 Although such criteria have acknowledged validity in humans, there is no such validation of criteria for dogs and cats. The veterinarian must rely on the recognition of multisystemic disease (especially joint, skin, kidney, oral mucosa, and hematopoietic system), positive ANA results, and confirmatory histopathologic and immunopathologic findings in involved skin and oral mucosa or both. 56 \u2022 217 Indirect immunofluorescence testing is negative in lupus erythematosus.\n\nThe American Rheumatism Association developed criteria for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in humans, and these were modified in 1982. These have also been applied to dogs with minor modifications, primarily those reflecting the humoral immunologic responses of the canine (Table 9_4 ).196 Dogs that experience four or more of the modified criteria during any given observation period have systemic lupus erythematosus. It has also been suggested that a probable diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is appropriate if three criteria are present or polyarthritis with ANA is present. Though these criteria are helpful guidelines, they must be used cautiously. In humans, numerous situations that may lead to a false diagnosis based on the American Rheumatism \u2022 The prognosis in systemic lupus erythematosus is generally unpredictable and depends on the organs involved.f\" 55, 196, 200, 217 In general, the earlier the diagnosis is made, the better the prognosis. In the dog, it appears that patients with joint, skin, or muscle disease respond more reliably to medication and are maintained in relatively long periods of clinical remission. On the other hand, dogs with severe hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or both often do not respond satisfactorily to systemic glucocorticoids and require other immunomodulating drugs, splenectomy, or both. Animals with glomerulonephritis regularly experience progressive renal failure in spite of therapy, and this finding indicates a poor prognosis, Therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus must be individualized. The initial agent of choice is probably large doses of systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., 2 to 6 mg/kg prednisone q24h). 47, 55, 196, 217 When systemic glucocorticoids are unsatisfactory, other immunomodulating drugs may be useful: azathioprine (Imuran) given orally at 2.2 mg/kg q24h, then q48h (dog only), or chlorambucil (Leukeran) given orally at 0.2 mg/kg q24h, then q48h. 47 . 55, 217 Splenectomy may be needed for patients with severe hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or both. Cyclophosphamide, 2 mg/kg q24h orally, 4 days a week, may be given for acute episodes of hemolytic anemia.P\" Vincristine, 0.01 to 0.025 mg/kg intravenously, once weekly, may be useful when thrombocytopenia is severe.!\" Levamisole (Levasole), given orally at 2.5 mglkg q48h, has occasionally been beneficial in dogs and humans with systemic lupus erythematosus.f The combination of levamisole, 2 to 5 mg/kg (maximum dose, 150 mg) q48h, with prednisone, has been reported to give good results in 75% of canine cases, with remissions lasting for months to years . 196, 200 The prednisone is initially dosed at 0.5 to 1.0 mglkg twice daily, then tapered off over 1 to 2 months with long-term therapy consisting of just levamisole. Only 2 of 33 dogs treated experienced unacceptable side effects (neutropenia, excited behavior, and aggressiveness) from levamisole.P\" 200\n\nChrysotherapy (injectable aurothioglucose, oral auranofin) has occasionally been used to reduce glucocorticoid requirements in dogs but would be contraindicated in patients with renal disease.!\" 34, 47 Aspirin has occasionally been effective in the management of cases in dogs and humans. IS, 47 Other drugs used in human patients-dapsone, antiandrogens, antimalarials, colchicine, and omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids-are of undetermined benefit in dogs and cats, IS, 47 Plasmapheresis has been used to enhance initial response to chemotherapy in dogs and humans with severe systemic lupus erythematosus. IS, 40 This technique, currently used as a research tool, is hazardous and expensive.\n\nIn murine lupus erythematosus, functional elimination of the helper T cell subset (CD4+) suppresses autoantibody formation and prevents or retards disease.F\" In humans, treatment with an anti-CD4 antibody induced a long-lasting decrease in disease activity in patients with severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus.v\"\n\nPatients with systemic lupus erythematosus are prone to infections.P\" 217 Thus, infections must be identified quickly and treated aggreSSively.\n\nThe following statements can be made about prognosis. Over 40% of the dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus are dead within 1 year after the diagnosis is made, either as a result of natural (renal disease, septicemia) or drug-induced causes or owing to euthanasia. 47, 217 Dogs that respond well to therapy often do so with glucocorticoids alone and often experience long-term remission on alternate-day therapy.f\"-217 Some dogs, in whom disease was controlled well with therapy for several months, remain in prolonged drugfree rernission.f\" : 196,217 Several reports have indicated that people in close contact with dogs having systemic lupus erythematosus or high-titer ANA do not have greater clinical or serologic evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus compared with nonexposed human beings. 25,47\n\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus (cutaneous lupus erythematosus) is the second most common immune-mediated dermatitis of the dog, although it remains uncommon. It has been described in the cat but appears to be very rare.\n\nCanine discoid lupus erythematosus is a relatively benign cutaneous disease with no systemic lnvolvement.P: 233, 234 A relationship or progression to canine systemic lupus erythematosus has not been reported, nor has the disease been shown to be a good model for the human disorder. Sun exposure aggravates the disease in about 50% of cases, suggesting that photosensitivity plays a role in the pathogenesis. In humans, it has been demonstrated that the lymphocytes infiltrating skin lesions of discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus are predominantly T cells and that helper T cells predominate in discoid lupus, whereas suppressor T cells predominate in the systemic variety,\" 18 In the dog, plasma cells are prominent, a feature not shared with humans, suggesting that B lymphocytes may be important and that a different pathogenesis may be occurring.\n\nA 9-year-old Shetland sheepdog with discoid lupus erythematosus had, on indirect immunofluorescence testing, antibody deposition at the basement membrane zone. Western immunoblotting revealed that the 120-kd and the 85-kd proteins targeted by the autoantibody did not correspond with the known basement membrane zone components.F\" A current hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of lesion formation is presented in the discussion of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n\u2022 Dog. There is probably no strong sex predilection, because both females-\" and males-\" have been reported to be predisposed. No age predilection has been reported.\n\nCollies, German shepherds, Shetland sheepdogs, Siberian huskies, Brittany spaniels, and German shorthaired pointers demonstrate predilection.55. 231, 234 Discoid lupus erythematosus has been reported to account for 0.3% of the canine dermatoses examined at one university small animal practice.P\" Clinical signs of canine discoid lupus erythematosus initially include depigmentation, erythema, and scaling of the nose (Fig. 9-24A ). Early depigmentation manifests as a slate blue or gray color change (see Fig. 9 -24B). A helpful early change is the conversion of the normally rough, cobblestone-like architecture of the nasal planum into a smooth surface (see Fig. 9-24C and D) . Later lesions commonly include erosion, ulceration, and crusting. Initially, lesions tend to occur dorsally at the junction between the nasal planum and haired skin or along the ventral or medial aspects of the alar folds. Typically, with time, nasal involvement becomes more extensive and the lesions may spread up the bridge of the nose. Less commonly, lesions may be visible periocularly, on the pinnae (see Fig.  9 -24F), on the distal limbs, and on the genitals. The lips may also be involved (see Fig.  9-24E) , and small punctate ulcers may be detected in the oral cavity (see Fig. 9-24G) , most commonly involving the tongue or palate (see Fig. 9-24E) . Occasional dogs present only with lesions of both pinnae or with nasodigital hyperkeratosis.P\" 234, 235 Pruritus and pain are variable. Scarring and variable degrees of permanent leukoderma are common. Rarely, deeply ulcerated nasal lesions damage arterioles, resulting in episodic, pulsatile hemorrhage. Affected dogs are otherwise healthy.\n\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus in dogs is commonly exacerbated or precipitated by exposure to ultraviolet light. Thus, the disease often is more severe in the summer and in parts of the world with sunny climates. It is very likely that many dogs previously referred to as having nasal solar dermatitis, or \"collie nose,\" actually had discoid lupus erythematosus, pemphigus foliaceus, and pemphigus erythematosus. Squamous cell carcinomas are reported to rarely develop in chronic discoid lupus erythematosus skin lesions (see Fig.  20-19B) . 236 The cause of the rare development of squamous cell carcinoma is likely multifactorial.F\" In the reported cases, the discoid lupus had been active for years and no photoprotection had been used on the chronically inflamed, depigmented skin. 236 We have also seen squamous cell carcinoma occur in the nasal lesions of chronic dermatomyositis. Thus, the depigmentation, ultraviolet light exposure, and chronic irritation may be more important than the disease affecting the nasal region .\n\n\u2022 Cat. Discoid lupus erythematosus appears to be very rare in cats. 229. 239 No age, breed, or sex predilections are reported. Lesions are most common on the pinnae and face. They are erythema, scaling, crusting, and alopecia. Pruritus is variable. Nasal dermatitis and depigmentation are less common (Fig. 9-25 ). Lesions may be more severe when exposure to sunlight is increased. Affected cats are otherwise healthy.\n\nThe most common differential diagnosis includes nasal solar dermatitis, nasal depigmentation, vitiligo-like disease, pemphigus erythematosus or pemphigus foliaceus, trauma, dermatomyositis, epitheliotropic lymphoma, drug reaction, uveodermatologic syndrome, contact dermatitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus is based on history, physical examination, and skin biopsy. Immunopathology may be an aid to diagnosis but, in the dog, it is not thought to be required for a definitive diagnosis because both false-positive and false-negative results occur.20.233 Results of routine laboratory determinations (hemogram, serum chemistries, urinalysis, serum protein electrophoresis) are usually unremarkable. The ANA and LE cell tests almost always yield negative results; if positive, the ANA titer is low. One report indicated that 9% and 4% of the dogs with discoid lupus erythematosus were positive for anti-ENA and anti-Ro, respectively.P\" Histopathology Skin biopsy reveals interface dermatitis (hydropic, lichenoid, or both) (Figs. 9-26 and 9-27).22.71,234 Focal hydropic degeneration of basal epidermal cells, pigmentary incontinence, focal thickening of the basement membrane zone, apoptotic keratinocytes, and marked accumulations of mononuclear cells and plasma cells around dermal vessels and appendages are important histopathologic features of discoid lupus erythematosus. Dermal mucinosis of variable degrees is also a common feature of discoid lupus erythematosus.\n\nImmunopathologic testing reveals deposition of immunoglobulin, complement, or both at the basement membrane zone. 56 , 231, 234 It would appear to be important to test for individual immunoglobulin classes because IgG, IgM, or IgA may be the only demonstrable immunoglobulin. In humans, it is recommended that (1) edematous lesions not be biopsied (only about 47% of such lesions are positive), (2) telangiectatic areas not be biopsied (about 17% of the telangiectatic skin lesions of any dermatosis are positive), and (3) lesions less than 1 month old not be biopsied (only about 30% of such lesions are positive). In addition, topical or systemic glucocorticoid therapy may lead to false-negative immunopathologic findings. 20 , 47. 56 We do not think that immunopathologic testing is required for the diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus in most instances. Immunopathologic tests are also considered to be inferior to, and only supportive of, a diagnosis based on histopathologic criteria. 238 , 240 Indirect immunofluorescence testing has generally been negative in discoid lupus erythematosus, though one dog having autoantibodies to the basement membrane zone has been reported.F?\n\nThe prognosis for discoid lupus erythematosus is usually good.56, 231, 234 Therapy will probably need to be continued for life, and marked depigmentation predisposes to sunburn.\n\nTherapy of discoid lupus erythematosus must be appropriate to the individual.f\"56, 231, 233, 234 Mild cases may be controlled by, and all cases benefit from, avoidance of exposure to intense sunlight (from 8 AM to 5 PM), the use of topical sunscreens, and the use of topical glucocorticoids (see Chap. 3). Initially, topical glucocorticoid therapy is most successful when potent agents, such as betamethasone or fluocinolone in DMSO (Synotic), are applied every 12 hours. After the dermatosis is in remission, topical glucocorticoids are applied as needed (once daily, q48h, and so forth), and less potent agents (e.g., 1% to 2% hydrocortisone) may be sufficient for maintenance. Anecdotal reports indicate that the topical application of 1% cyclosporine is effective. 232a In some cases, a I-month course of systemic prednisone (2.2 mglkg orally q24h until remission is achieved, then q48h) is helpful. The topical agents may then be sufficient to maintain the remission. Though not frequently effective as the sole therapy, systemic vitamin E (400 to 800 IV daily) is recommended because it may have a beneficial effect. 234 Vitamin E appears to have a 1-to 2-month lag phase before its benefit is recognized clinically, and systemic glucocorticoids may be used concurrently during this period. Vitamin E should be administered 2 hours before or after feeding. Two of us (D.W.S., W.H.M.) have had good success in some cases with the oral administration of products containing omega-Szomega-f fatty acids (DVM Derm Caps) and now use these products instead of vitamin E. Various combinations of fatty acids, vitamin E, and other treatments have been used successfully. In some cases, more potent drugs may be given initially, then remission maintained with fatty acids and vitamin E.\n\nIf these benign treatments are not effective in dogs, tetracycline and niacinamide in combination may be effective in up to 70% of the cases (see Chap. 3) . 233 In dogs under 10 kg, the dosage is 250 mg of each drug q8h, and in dogs over 10 kg, the dosage is 500 mg of each q8h. The tetracycline-niacinamide combination produces its effects within 8 weeks.\n\nIn refractory cases in dogs and cats in which the owners think that better control is absolutely required, systemic glucocorticoids (2.2 to 4.4 mglkg prednisolone or prednisone, given orally q24h) are often effective. For more severe or refractory cases, other systemic drugs may be added to the treatment regimen: azathioprine (2.2 mglkg orally q24h, then q48h in dogs only) or chlorambucil (0.2 mglkg orally q24h, then q48h). Owners should understand that discoid lupus erythematosus is rarely a life-threatening disease but that some of the potent immunomodulating drugs could cause severe side effects.\n\nIn humans, discoid lupus erythematosus is often responsive to antimalarial drugschloroquine (Aralen), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), and quinacrine (Atabrme).\" These drugs may be useful in the dog as well, but dosage, efficacy, and toxicity need to be carefully evaluated. Other drugs occasionally found to be beneficial in humans are retinoids, dapsone, and gold (oral or injectable).\" The usefulness of these latter compounds in dogs is currently unknown. Bilateral rotation flaps have been successfully used for the treatment of chronic, medically refractory cases of canine nasal dermatitis,2,37\n\nResults of a clinicopathologic study of five Shetland sheepdogs and two collies with socalled \"idiopathic ulcerative dermatosis\" led the investigators to conclude that the syndrome should be renamed vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus (see Chap. 12).203\n\nResults of recent pathologic and immunopathologic studies of German shorthaired pointers with so-called \"hereditary lupoid dermatosis\" led the investigators to conclude that the syndrome should be renamed exfoliative cutaneous lupus erythematosus (see Chap. 12).212\n\nCryoglobulins and cryofibrinogens are proteins that precipitate from serum and plasma, respectively, by cooling and redissolve on rewarming.I\" 47, 242, 245 Cryoglobulins have been classified into three types according to their characteristics. Type I cryoglobulins are composed solely of monoclonal immunoglobulins or free light chains (Bence Jones proteins) and are most commonly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, Type II cryoglobulins are composed of monoclonal and polyclonal immunoglobulins and are most commonly associated with autoimmune and connective tissue disease. Type III cryoglobulins are composed of polyclonal immunoglobulins and occur with infections, autoimmune disorders, and connective tissue diseases. Essential forms also may occur where no underlying cause is identifiable. Cutaneous signs associated with cryoglobulins and cryofibrinogens are due to vascular insufficiency (obstruction, stasis, spasm, thrombosis) that occur from microthrombi and vasculitis.\n\nCryoglobulinemia and cryofibrinogenemia have been rarely reported to cause skin disease in dogs and cats.f\" [243] [244] [245] [246] When associated with autoantibodies directed against erythrocytes (cold agglutinin disease, cold hemagglutinin disease, cryopathic hemolytic anemia), it is an autoimmune disorder associated with cold-reacting (usually IgM) erythrocyte autoantibodies, The cryopathic autoantibody is most active at colder temperatures (0\u00b0to 4\u00b0C) but has a wide range of thermal activity (0\u00b0to 37\u00b0C). Two forms are recognized in dogs. 25 The first is associated with cold agglutinins that are IgM antibodies. The second form is a non agglutinating type, usually associated with IgG. The latter form is rarer and is not known to cause skin disease. A dog with combined cryoglobulinemia (lgG, IgM) and cryofibrinogenemia has been reported.r\" Cold agglutinin disease represents a Type II hypersensitivity reaction and has been associated with idiopathy and lead poisoning in dogs and with upper respiratory infection, lead poisoning, and idiopathy in cats.\n\nClinical signs of cryoglobulinemia and cryofibrinogenemia are variable and relate to anemia, intracapillary cold hemagglutination, or both. Skin lesions include pain, erythema, purpura, acrocyanosis, necrosis, and ulceration. Skin lesions generally involve the extremities (paws, pinnae, nose, tip of tail) (see Figs. 9-24H and 9-28A) and are precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold. Hemoglobinemia may also be present.\n\nTail-tip necrosis was reported in two litters of Birman kittens from the same queen.>\" Based on blood group testing of the queen and one of the toms, a presumptive diagnosis of neonatal isoerythrolysis involving cold agglutinins was made. The tip of the tail became necrotic within the first week of life. It was thought that the pinnae, paws, and nose of the neonates were protected from cold by close contact with the queen. The kittens survived pending the severity of any intravascular hemolysis, \n\nThe differential diagnosis includes vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and frostbite.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease is made by history, physical examination, and demonstration of significant titers of cold agglutinins. In vitro autohemagglutination of blood at room temperature can be diagnostic for cold-reacting autoantibodies. Blood in heparin or ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) is allowed to coolon a slide, thus permitting the autoagglutination to be readily visible macroscopically. The reaction can be accentuated by cooling the blood to O\u00b0C or reversed by warming the blood to 37\u00b0C. Doubtful cases can be confirmed via Coombs' test if the complete test is performed at 4\u00b0C and the Coombs reagent has activity against IgM. Caution in interpretation of the cold Coombs' test is warranted, because normal dogs and cats may have titers up to 1: 100.47.247 Cryoprecipitate levels may be crudely determined by allowing venous blood collected in a warm syringe to clot at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes, then the serum and citrated plasma are cooled to 4\u00b0C and a gel-like precipitate is formed that will redissolve upon rewarming to 37\u00b0C. 245 The precipitate is removed, and the serum and plasma globulin and fibrinogen levels with and without the precipitate may be compared to give a level of cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen. In 10 normal dogs, the mean levels were 0.106 gL-I for cryoglobulin and 0.16 gL -1 for cryofibrinogen, whereas an affected dog had levels of 0.669 gL-1 and 0.3 gL-1, respectively.P\"\n\nSkin biopsy usually reveals necrosis, ulceration, and often secondary suppurative changes. Fortuitously sampled sections may show vasculitis, thrombotic to necrotic blood vessels, or blood vessels containing an amorphous eosinophilic substance consisting largely of precipitated cryoglobulin.!\" 242, 245 Diffuse edema, extravasation of erythrocytes, and homogenization of dermal collagen also occur (see Fig. 9-28B ).\n\nThe prognosis for cryoglobulinemia and cryofibrinogenemia varies with the underlying cause. Therapy includes (1) correction of the underlying cause, if possible, (2) avoidance of cold, and (3) immunosuppressive drug regimens (e.g., glucocorticoids, azathioprine) (see Chap. 3).\n\nGraft-versus-host disease is a well-recognized result of bone marrow transplantation in dogs and humans.v lB, 47, 249, 251 The disease occurs whenever lymphoid cells from an immunocompetent donor are introduced into a histoincompatible recipient that is incapable of rejecting them. The disease results from donor T cell responses to recipient transplantation antigens.\n\nIn dogs and humans, a bone marrow graft from a donor genetically identical for major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens is followed by significant graft-versus-host disease in about 50% of recipients, despite post-graft immunosuppressive therapy. Hence, minor histocompatibility antigens are important in the development of disease. The principal target organs are the skin, liver, and intestinal tract. In dogs, acute graft-versus-host disease develops about 2 weeks after grafting and is characterized by erythroderma, jaundice, diarrhea, and gram-negative infections. Chronic graft-versus-host disease develops about 3 to 4 months after grafting and is characterized by exfoliative erythroderma, ulcerative dermatitis, ascites, and gram-positive infections.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and skin biopsy. Histopathologic findings in acute graft-versus-host disease include varying degrees of dermal lymphoid infiltrates, interface dermatitis (hydropic or lichenoid) with apoptosis and satellitosis. The lymphocytic exocytosis and apoptosis also target the follicular epithelium.I\" 47, 24B, 250 These changes have been compared to and are similar to those occurring in erythema multiforme.\" In chronic graft-versus-host disease, one finds variable sclerodermoid or poikilodermatous changes.\n\nThe immunohistochemistry of acute canine graft-versus-host disease has been studied in six dogs and is similar to that described in humans.v 249 Epidermal and follicular keratinocytes of affected skin upregulate ICAM-l, CD44, and MHC II, similar to what is found in erythema multiforme.f However, the overall lymphocytic infiltrate in these two diseases is different. Although both diseases have CD3+, CD8a,8+ and TCR-a,8+ T cells, graft-versus-host disease had fewer dermal CD4+ T cells, CDI + and CDn + dendritic cells, and no CD21 + B cells (which occurred in erythema multiforme). These findings suggested that the mechanism of disease is similar in the two diseases, though erythema multiforme has additional pathologic pathways.\" Whether this relates to the stage of disease is unknown because the dogs with erythema multiforme may have had more chronic disease than the dogs with experimentally induced graft-versus-host disease.\n\nEpidermal and follicular ICAM-l expression may playa key role in tethering CD8+ T cells, enabling subsequent interactions between T cells and keratinocytes.v 249 Activated T cells produce a storm of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-a, and TNF-a. These mediators recruit and activate effector cells, including additional lympho-cytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells that attack both host and donor tissue through contact-dependent mechanisms (such as perform) or soluble mediators (such as TNF-a).\n\nTherapy of graft-versus-host disease with various combinations of systemic glucocorticoids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and antithymocyte serum have been only partially and unpredictably effective. 249. 251 A combination of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine demonstrated synergism, but beneficial effects were still Iimited.P' Leflunomide, when combined with prednisone and cyclosporine, has been reported to virtually eliminate allograft rejection responses.\"\n\nCutaneous adverse drug reactions (drug eruption, drug allergy, dermatitis medicamentosa) in dogs and cats are uncommon, variably pruritic, and pleomorphic cutaneous or mucocutaneous reactions to a drug. 253, 257, 269, 270, 286, 287 \n\nAdverse reactions to drugs are common and, in humans, cutaneous reactions are one of the most common.!\" Drugs responsible for skin eruptions may be administered orally, topically, or by injection or inhalation. The incidence of cutaneous adverse drug reactions in dogs and cats was reported to be 2% and 1.6%, respectively, of all the canine and feline dermatology cases examined at one university practice, 286, 287 In humans, the incidence is reported to be 2,2% of all hospitalized patients and 3 per 1000 courses of drug therapy.\" Even these numbers are suspect because few mechanisms can accurately record the incidence of drug reactions.P?\n\nAdverse drug reactions may be divided into two major groups: (1) predictable, which are usually dose-dependent and are related to the pharmacologic actions of the drugs, and (2) unpredictable or idiosyncratic, which are often dose-independent and are related to the individual's immunologic response or to genetic differences in the susceptibility of patients (idiosyncracy or intolerance), which are often related to metabolic or enzymatic deficiencies. Drug metabolites are generated by cytochrome P-450-mixed function oxidases (phase I enzymes) but also by other oxidative metabolizing enzymes, some of which are present in skin,295 Reactive drug metabolites then need to be detoxified by phase II enzymes, such as epoxide hydrolase or glutathione-S-transferase, to prevent toxicity, Thus, two places allow for inappropriate generation and/or accumulation of toxic reactants more toxic than the parent compounds, In humans, slow acetylation contributes to sulfonamide drug reactions and familial anticonvulsant drug reactions are linked to inherited detoxification defects,295 A hypothesis for the drug reactions associated with sulfonamides and anticonvulsants includes (1) oxidation by cytochrome P-450 into chemically reactive metabolites (either in liver by hepatic cytochrome P-450 with secondary transfer to skin or in keratinocytes by epidermal cytochrome P-450), and (2) decreased detoxification of these reactive metabolites, which bind to proteins and induce an immunologic response, Many cutaneous effects of certain drugs are predictable, For instance, many of the anticancer or immunosuppressive drugs can cause alopecia, purpura, poor wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infection through their effects on cellular biology. 18, 47, 254, 256, 277 Doxorubicin typically causes alopecia that begins on the head and extends to the ventral neck, thorax, and abdomen.P\" 274. 276 Hyperpigmentation and pruritus may also occur, Immunologic reactions involved in cutaneous drug reactions include Types I, II, III, and IV hypersensitivity reactions. Newer techniques may help to determine the underlying immune response in some types of drug reactions.F\" Additionally, other immunologic reactions may occur as evidenced by the drug-induced development of erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and superficial suppurative necrolytic dermatitis of miniature Schnauzers. Though the mechanism for these reactions is unknown, it is thought that immunologic mechanisms may play a role. Human patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and atopy are thought to be predisposed to cutaneous drug reactions.!\" but no such observations have been made for the dog and cat.\n\nAny drug may cause an eruption (Tables 9-5 and 9-6), though certain drugs are more frequently associated with cutaneous adverse drug reactions. The most common drugs recognized to produce idiosyncratic cutaneous adverse drug reactions in dogs are topical agents, sulfonamides (especially those that are trimethoprim-potentiated, such as Tribrissen), penicillins, cephalosporins, levamisole, and diethylcarbamazine.F\" In cats, the most common causes are topical agents, penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides.P\"\n\nCutaneous adverse drug reactions can mimic virtually any dermatosis (see Tables 9-5 and 9-6; Fig. 9-29A to H) .\" In humans, the most common morphologic patterns are exanthematous, urticaria or angioedema, and fixed drug eruption.P? In dogs, the most common reactions were contact dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus with self-induced lesions, maculopapular eruptions, and erythema multiforme.F\" In cats, the most common reactions were contact dermatitis and pruritus with self-induced lesions.F\" No age or sex predilections have been reported for canine and feline cutaneous drug reactions.P\"-287 In general, no breed predilections are evident, though Poodles, Bichon Frises, Yorkshire terriers, silky terriers, Pekingese, and Maltese terriers (\"fuzzy\" hair coats) are predisposed to local injection reactions (especially with rabies vacciner.F\" 287 Doberman pinschers to sulfonamide reactions,26o.287 and miniature Schnauzers to sulfonamide, gold, and shampoo (superficial suppurative necrolytic dermatitis) reactions.F\": 294 In one study of cutaneous adverse drug reactions in dogs,287 the following breeds were found to be at increased risk: Shetland sheepdog, Dalmatian, Yorkshire terrier, miniature Poodle, miniature Schnauzer, Australian shepherd, Old English sheepdog, Scottish terrier, wirehaired Fox terrier, and Greyhound. Although humans with HIV infections are at increased risk for drug reactions, cats with cutaneous adverse drug reactions were not FlY-positive or FeLV-positive. 286 Although no specific type of reaction is related to only one drug, certain reactions are more common with certain drugs. The syndrome of superficial suppurative necrolytic dermatitis of miniature Schnauzers has been associated only with shampoos (see Fig. 9 -29H).287, 294 Adult miniature Schnauzers of either sex show cutaneous and systemic signs within 48 to 72 hours after shampooing (usually insecticidal). Lesions, which may be widespread or primarily ventral, include erythematous papules and plaques that develop pustulosis, becoming painful, necrotic, and ulcerative. Lesions regress spontaneously within 1 to 2 weeks with symptomatic therapy. Systemic signs include pyrexia, depression, and neutrophilia. Drug eruptions associated with systemic signs and a fatal outcome were reported in two dogs after carprofen (Rimadyl) therapy.P\" Skin lesions included small pustules, erythematous macules, crusts, and erosions that histologically had dermal neutrophilic infiltrates. Both dogs died in spite of immunosuppressive therapy. Both had neutrophilic infiltrates of the respiratory tract. It was proposed that these two cases had a carprofeninduced condition similar to Sweet's syndrome in humans.\n\nErythema multiforme and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been most common with administration of sulfonamides, cephalosporins, and levamisole (see Fig. 9 -29E to C).t Three dogs, two treated with trimethoprim/sulfonamide, experienced superficial pemphigus that had features of erythema multiforme, including keratinocyte apoptosis and neutrophilic satellitosis.'! A drug eruption in a dog with coccidioidomycosis treated with itraconazole had clinical and histologic changes compatible with erythema multiforme.F\" Diethylcarbamazine and 5-fluorocytosine have been associated with fixed drug eruptions, especially on the scrotum of male dogs (Fig. 9-30A) . 47 only partially responsive to glucocorticoid treatment and mimic food hypersensitivity.P\" Drugs have also been reported to produce reactions that clinically, pathologically, and immunologically resemble pemphigus (see Figs. 9-29C and 9-30B) and pemphi-gOid. 252. 268. 272, 273. 275 Drug reactions (associated with ketoconazole in one case, multiple drugs in others) have occurred in dogs that were clinically and histologically indistinguishable from epitheliotropic lymphoma, as has been reported with various drugs in humans. 261. 280, 287 Lesions resolved spontaneously when the drugs were stopped. Chronic eosinophilic urticaria was associated with diethylcarbamazine.P\" Unusual reactions to local injections are also well recognized ( Fig. 9-31 ). One such reaction is the focal vasculitis and alopecia that follows the subcutaneous administration of rabies vaccine, especially in Poodles and Yorkshire and silky terriers (see discussion of vasculitisl.t?? Another local reaction is the panniculitis associated with the subcutaneous administration of rabies vaccine in cats and dogs,264 combined rhinotracheitis-calicivirus vaccine in cats,289 and other products (see discussion of panniculitis in Chap. 18). 286, 287 Plaquelike lesions with a distinctive interstitial granulomatous dermatitis histopathologic appearance have been associated with drug therapy in humans.P\" One of us (D.W.S.) has seen one such reaction in a dog being treated with amoxicillin clavulanate (Fig. 9-32 ).\n\nGranulomatous mural folliculitis is a rare cutaneous reaction pattern apparently associated with drug administration (amitraz, cefadroxyl, topicals, L-thyroxine).288 Lesions consist of large areas of well-circumscribed, coalescent alopecia; scaling; and hyperkeratosis ( Fig.  9-33A and B) . Foci of papules, plaques, erosions, and crusts may occur. Chronic lesions often have a smooth, shiny, cicatricial appearance.\n\nBecause drug reaction can mimic so many different dermatoses, an accurate knowledge of the medications given to any patient with an obscure form of dermatosis is imperative. Drug eruption may occur after a drug has been given for days or years or a few days after drug therapy is stopped. Eruptions most commonly occur within 1 to 3 weeks after initiating therapy. 286. 287 Some reactions (vasculitis, atrophic dermatosis, nodules, rabies vaccine reactions) may occur weeks to months after the drug is administered. 269. 270 At present, the only reliable test for the diagnosis of drug eruption is to withdraw the drug and watch for disappearance of the eruption (usually in 1 to 2 weeks). Occasionally, however, drug eruptions persist for weeks to months after the offending drug is stopped (e.g., reactions to vaccines and other injectables; lichenoid reactionsl.P\" ' 270, 286. 287 Purposeful readministration of the offending drug to determine whether the eruption will be reproduced is undesirable and may be dangerous.\n\nThe differential diagnosis is complex because cutaneous adverse drug reaction may mimic virtually any dermatosis. In general, no specific or characteristic laboratory findings indicate drug eruption. Results of in vivo and in vitro immunologic tests have usually been disappointing. The basophil degranulation test has been reported to be a valuable test for detecting some hypersensitivity-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions'? but is technically demanding and generally unavailable.\n\nHelpful criteria for determining whether a drug eruption is likely are as follows286.287:\n\n1. Hypersensitivity or reactions occur in a minority of patients receiving the drug. 2. Observed manifestations do not resemble known pharmacologic actions for the drugs. 3. Previous experience that the suspected drug is known for causing this type of cutaneous reaction. 4. Lack of alternative causes that could explain the cutaneous reaction that occurred with the suspect drug. 5. Appropriate timing-generally, cutaneous adverse drug reactions occur within the first 1 to 3 weeks of the initiation of therapy with the offending drug and while the drug is still being taken or is still present in the body. Prior exposure to the drug may have been tolerated without adverse effects and, if the reaction is a hypersensitivity reaction, prior exposure should have occurred so that sensitization could occur. If an animal has been previously sensitized, cutaneous reactions may be seen within hours to days of drug readministration. 6. Dechallenge. Resolution begins to occur within 1 to 2 weeks after the drug is discontinued. For some reactions-such as fixed drug, lichenoid, and local injection reaction -resolution may require several weeks. 7. Rechallenge. Reaction is reproduced by administration of small doses of the drugs or of cross-reacting drugs. Though this is the most definitive way to document the drug reaction, it is generally not recommended because more serious reactions may occur. In one study, 29% of cases of cutaneous adverse drug reaction in dogs were confirmed, often accidentally, by rechallenge. 287 Identifying the specific cause of a cutaneous drug eruption can be difficult because many patients are receiving several drugs at the same time.I\" 252, 286, 287 In some cases, the reactions only occur with drug combinations and one drug will be tolerated.\n\nRecently, possible causal drug exposure has been assessed by adaptation of drug implication criteria adopted by the French committee for pharmacologic surveillance in humans (Table 9_7) . 278, .308 Just as the clinical morphology of drug reactions varies greatly, so do the histologic findings. Histologic patterns recognized with cutaneous adverse drug reactions include \u2022 Tahl(\u00b7 9-7 PROPOSED CRITERIA FOR THE IMPLICATION OF DRUGS AS CAUSES OF CUTANEOUS ERUPTIONS261,291\n\nDrug attributed a score of: a, + 1 (suggestive) if lesions began over 7 days after the first administration of the drug or less than 1 day after reexposure to a culprit medication. b. 0 (inconclusive) if a specific assessment could not be made. c. -1 (not suggestive) where criteria for \"suggestive\" (+ 1) not met.\n\nDmg attributed a score of: A positive total drug score (e.g\" + 1, +2, +3) is considered suggestive of drug causation.\n\nA zero score is considered inconclusive. A negative score (e.g., -1, -2, -3) is considered doubtful.\n\nDrugs are given a numerical score of -3 to + 3 based on the added values obtained from the three criteria. perivascular dermatitis (pure, spongiotic, hyperplastic), interface dermatitis (hydropic, lichenoid), vasculitis/vasculopathy ( Fig. 9-34 ), intraepidermal vesiculopustular dermatitis ( Fig.  9-35) , subepidermal vesicular dermatitis, interstitial dermatitis, and panniculitis. Eosinophils may be absent or numerous.P\" 270 In humans, eosinophils may be more prominent with drug-induced than with non-drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus.P? Some syndromes-such as erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and superficial suppurative necrolytic dermatitis-have their own characteristic histopathology. Superficial suppurative necrolytic dermatitis of miniature Schnauzers is characterized by parakeratosis, superficial epidermal suppuration and necrosis, epidermal edema, and suppurative perivascular and perifollicular dermatitis (Fig. 9_36 ).294 Similar changes may occur in the follicular epithelium. Granulomatous mural folliculitis is characterized by infiltration and eventual replacement of follicular epithelium, and occasionally sebaceous glands, by granulomatous inflammation (Fig. 9_37) . 288 Direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical testing in drug reactions may reveal immunoreactants deposited in a variety of nondiagnostic patterns, especially in the walls of blood vessels and at the basement membrane zone. 269 . 270, 286, 287\n\nThe prognosis for drug reaction is usually good unless other organ systems are involved or there is extensive epidermal necrosis. Therapy of drug reaction consists of (1) discontinuing the offending drug, (2) treating symptoms with topical and systemic medications as indicated, and (3) avoiding chemically related drugs. 286 , 287 Drug reactions may be poorly responsive to glucocorticoids, though some immunologically mediated reactions respond to glucocorticoids, pentoxifylline, or immunosuppressive regimens (see Chap. 3).252,270\n\nErythema multiforme is an uncommon, acute, usually self-limited eruption of the skin, mucous membranes, or both characterized by distinctive gross lesions and a diagnostic sequence of pathologic changes.\n\nDespite recognition of multiple etiologic and triggering causes, the pathogenesis of erythema multiforme is not fully understood. It is currently thought to represent a hostspecific cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction directed toward various antigens, including infections, drugs, foods, neoplasia, and connective tissue diseases.\" 18. 56. 291. 323 Recent studies indicated that the immunohistochemical findings in skin lesions from dogs with erythema multiforme and acute graft-versus-host disease were similar.\" Epidermal and follicular keratinocytes markedly expressed ICAM-l, MHC II and, to a lesser extent, CDla. The expression of these molecules is likely to tether leukocytes and keep them in the epithelium. The simultaneous expression of MHC II and CDla provides altered keratinocytes with the capability of antigen presentation. Keratinocytes in adjacent, noninflamed epidermis also expressed ICAM-l and MHC II, suggesting that the upregulation of both adhesion molecules may represent an early phase in the development of erythema multiforme. CD44 was markedly upregulated in keratinocytes and infiltrating cells, and it is involved in T lymphocyte activation and site-specific extravasation of lymphocytes into tissues. Intraepithelial infiltrating cells were mainly CD3+, CD8-al3+, TCR-al3+ T lymphocytes, with smaller numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes. CDI +, CDllc+ Langerhans' cells were increased in number. The majority of dermal infiltrating cells were also CD3+, CD8-al3+, TCR-al3+ T lymphocytes. CDI +, CDllc+ dermal dendrocytes were increased in number.\n\nThe phenotypic changes in keratinocytes in canine erythema multiforme indicate that alteration of the keratinocyte (e.g., by drugs, infectious agents) might be a primary factor in disease pathogenesis.s The up regulation of ICAM-l and MHC II, perhaps through the production of IFN-a and TNF-13 by CD8+ (cytotoxic) and CD4+ (helper) T lympho-cytes, allows the tethering and keeping of lymphocytes in epithelium. Keratinocyte apoptosis is probably produced by signals from intraepithelial CD8+ T lymphocytes.\n\nStudies in humans with erythema multiforme have shown that various basement membrane zone molecules-integrins a6 and {34, laminins I and 5, collagens IV and VII-are disrupted and fragrnented.P'\" A subset of humans with erythema multiforme have autoantibodies against desmoplakin I and II as well as suprabasilar acantholysis in skin biopsy specimens.s?'\n\nThe confusion with the pathogenesis and classification of erythema multiforme has been frustrating for human and veterinary medicine for years. 298. 306-308 In humans, erythema multiforme is usually divided into two subsets.P'': 306 An important distinction, in humans, is that the more common, mild, relapsing cutaneous disease of erythema multiforme (erythema multiforme \"minor\") is most often associated with viral infections, whereas the more severe forms involving mucosa and having more widespread cutaneous disease (erythema multiforme \"major\") are most often associated with drug eruptions.P\"\n\nIn addition, much confusion has existed over the relationship of erythema multiforme to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (also called erythema multiforme major by some authors), toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome), and \"overlaps\" of the latter two entities. Relying on some etiologic, clinical, and histopathologic similarities, it had been suggested that these conditions simply represent different aspects of a single spectrum of diseases.P\" 306. 315, 319, 320 However, this unitary concept has been disputed on clinical and histologic grounds. 297, 306, 315. 319, 320 Using standard histopathologic and immunohistochemical techniques, it was shown that the inflammatory infiltrates in the skin of humans with erythema multiforme and toxic epidermal necrolysis differed both in density and nature. 315. 321 In erythema multiforme, the cellular infiltrate was of high density (cell-rich) and rich in T lymphocytes, whereas in toxic epidermal necrolysis, the infiltrate was of low density (cell-poor) and dominated by macrophages and dermal dendrocytes.P\" Support for a different pathomechanism has been shown in dogs as well.50, 308 In a study of apoptosis in canine skin disease, investigators found that keratinocyte apoptosis was a feature of erythema multiforme but not of toxic epidermal necrolysis/\" This at least suggests that these two diseases are not the same. However, before conclusions can be reached, more cases and some that share the histopathology of both disorders need to be studied.\n\nMuch of the confusion in classification has stemmed from the terminology that is applied to the various syndromes in humans and the lack of agreement on a clinical definition ,47, 306. 308 Hence, various authors consider the Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme major to be different or the same, and they divide erythema multiforme into \"minor\" and \"major\" variants or not. 297, 298 For this reason, some authors have proposed that the term erythema multiforme be used to describe all forms of the entity and that the Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis be called Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis, eliminating the terms major and minor.306, 319 In veterinary medicine, this confusion has been compounded by the common acceptance of a diagnosis based primarily on histopathologic findings. 22, 72, 308 The clinical separation of these different diseases is becoming more realistic in human medicine. The first point of separation is on presentation because most cases of erythema multiforme are relatively mild; have an acute onset of lesions, including classic target lesions; have no fever or prodromal symptoms; and, if there is mucosal involvement, it is usually mild and limited to the oral cavity.306 These cases are self-limited, and lesions clear within I to 3 weeks.\n\nThe confusion has occurred in cases that are more widespread and may involve fever or prodromal symptoms. Recently, after the publication of a study in human patients requiring hospitalization for severe disease with lesions compatible with erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis, a clinical classification was proposed and reviewed and a consensus on a clinical separation was reached.F\" However, these authors wrote of their classification that its \"validity is unproven.\" Four types of lesions were found in these cases: typical target lesions, raised atypical target lesions, flat atypical target lesions, and macules with or without blisters. Two main features were used to separate these cases: the presence of typical target lesions and extent or body surface area of epidermal detachment.s\" Cases were classified into one of five categories, and the salient differentiating feature between what is erythema multiforme and the rest of Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis cases was the presence of the typical target lesion in all cases of erythema multiforme. Additionally, all erythema multiforme cases involved less than 10% body surface area epidermal detachment.\n\nWhen this classification scheme was used, a significant correlation between clinical findings, cause, and histology was found between erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis. Erythema multiforme was primarily associated with infections, particularly herpesvirus, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis was primarily associated with drug administration.297, 298 Erythema multiforme lesions may also occur with lupus erythematosus in Rowell's syndrome.'?\" Histopathologic findings in the erythema multiforme cases revealed a predominantly inflammatory mononuclear lichenoid infiltrate, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis revealed predominantly epidermal necrosis with minimal inflammation. 297, 301, 321 The human international consensus clinical classification has been adapted for use in dogs by a multicenter group (Canada, Europe, United States) (Table 9_8 ).308 Possible causal drug exposure was addressed by adopting the drug implication criteria used in humans (see Table 9_7 ).278 In this scheme, erythema multiforme cases have flat or raised target or polycyclic lesions, less than 50% of the body surface affected with an erythematous or purpuric macular or patchy eruption, and less than 10% of the body surface showing epidermal detachment. The erythema multiforme cases were subclassified into \"minor\" if one or no mucosal surface was involved and \"major\" if more than one mucosal surface was affected. All three forms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis had greater than 50% of the body surface affected with macular or purpuric eruption, greater than one mucosal surface involved, and no target or polycyclic lesions.\n\nWith this classification scheme, it was shown that only 19% of erythema multiforme was associated with drug exposure, whereas 92% of Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis cases were associated with drug exposure. Histopathologic findings showed an overlap between the groups, suggesting that, at least in this canine classification system, biopsy and histopathologic examination was not able to separate the two entities, though the erythema multiforme cases did have less epidermal necrosis and greater dermal inflammation than the Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis cases. Further studies are indicated to document the validity and usefulness of this classification system in dogs. We and others 273 think that the histopathologic findings of erythema multiforme and toxic epidermal necrolysis in dogs, as in humans, are quite different.\n\nA major distinction still to address is the typical target lesion. This appears to be a major feature for the diagnosis of erythema multiforme in humans but has not been addressed in the dog. The typical target lesion is defined as a highly regular, well-defined, round, wheal-like erythematous papule or plaque of less than 3 cm in diameter that has at \u2022 least three different zones, which are composed of two concentric rings around a central disk ( Fig. 9-38A ). The central disk varies from erythematous to violaceous, dusky, purpuric, or necrotic and may vesiculate. The inner ring is edematous and pale, the outer ring (\"halo\") is erythematous.298.307 This \"typical target lesion\" has been detected in 15.9% of dogs with erythema multiforme.P\" This aspect needs to be more carefully reevaluated in veterinary medicine. Erythema multiforme is uncommon in dogs and cats, accounting for only 0.4% and 0.11%, respectively, of all the canine and feline dermatology cases examined at a university practice.P\" Erythema multiforme has been recognized in dogs in association with infections, drug therapy (especially trimethoprim-potentiated sulfonamides, penicillins, and cephalosporins), and idiopathy (Table 9_9) . 47.56.269.291,302.308,318,322,323 Two cases of druginduced erythema multiforme have been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. 311, 318 Erythema multiforme has also been reported to be a manifestation of adverse reactions to dietary substances.P\" In one study, 22.8% of the cases of canine erythema multiforme were idiopathic. 323 A subgroup of idiopathic erythema multiforme has been described in old dogs, occasionally associated with an underlying disease, suggesting immune dysfunction.P In cats, erythema multiforme has been reported in association with drug therapy (cephalexin, penicillin, aurothioglucose, trimethoprim-sulfonamide, amoxicillin, griseofulvin, propylthiouracil) and herpesvirus infection wherein lesions may accompany upper respiratory signs and resolve when the respiratory disease resolves.v 323, 385\n\nProdromal or concurrent clinical signs may reflect the underlying cause. As the term multiforme implies, the skin lesions are variable, but they are usually characterized by an acute, rather symmetric onset of (1) erythematous macules (see Fig. 9 -38B) or slightly \u2022 elevated papules that spread peripherally and clear centrally, producing annular (target) or arciform patterns (see Fig. 9 -38A), (2) urticarial plaques, (3) vesicles and bullae, or (4) some combination thereof. The classic target (\"iris,\" \"doughnut\") lesion is a papular to plaque-like lesion wherein the periphery remains indurated while the center clears anclJor becomes cyanotic to purpuric (see Fig. 9_38A ).323 These lesions may then become centrally vesicular or bullous, eventuating in epidermal necrosis with resultant slough and oozing erosions and ulcers. Mucosal lesions are similar in onset and symmetry but are usually vesicular, bullous, and ulcerative. The oral ulcers are often hemorrhagic and coated by grayish-white pseudomembranes of necrotic epithelium and fibrin. The maculopapular form of erythema multiforme initially is characterized by lack of surface pathology (lack of scale, crust, oozing, hair loss). The urticarial form of erythema multiforme is characterized by a normal overlying skin and haircoat and the persistence of urticarial lesions, as opposed to the evanescent nature of the wheals in true urticaria. Patients with maculopapular eruptions are usually asymptomatic. Other animals become systemically ill (fever, depression, anorexia) and have rather extensive vesiculobullous and ulcerative lesions. The most commonly affected body sites in dogs include the In cats, lesions are predominantly vesiculobullous and/or ulcerative ( Fig. 9-42) , and the trunk and mucocutaneous junctions are most commonly affected.F\"\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes bacterial folliculitis, dermatophytosis, demodicosis, urticaria, and other vesicular and pustular disorders. Definitive diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, ruling out of alteruatives with laboratory testing, and skin biopsy. Skin biopsy findings vary with the gross morphology of the lesions and do not reliably distinguish between clinically mild and severe forms of the disorder.P- 47. 71, 308, 323 Neither are there any apparent histopathologic differences between cases with suspected triggers at all levels of epidermis, and lymphocytic exocytosis. Also note mild epidermal hyperplasia and normal stratum corneum. and those without (i.e., idiopathic).323 Maculopapular lesions are characterized histologically by hydropic interface dermatitis with prominent single-cell apoptosis of keratinocytes at all levels of the epidermis and satellitosis of lymphocytes and macrophages (Figs. 9-43 and 9-44). The infundibular region of hair follicle outer root sheath epithelium is often similarly affected. In the absence of necrosis, ulceration, and bacterial infection, the stratum corneum is orthokeratotic and normal, and the epidermis shows mild to moderate, regular hyperplasia. A superficial interstitial or, rarely, a dense lichenoid inflammatory infiltrate is visible.\n\nUrticarial lesions are characterized by hydropic interface dermatitis and striking dermal edema ( Fig. 9-45 ). Dermal collagen fibers become vertically oriented and attenuated, presenting a weblike appearance (\"gossamer\" collagen). Vesiculobullous lesions are characterized by segmental full-thickness coagulation necrosis of epithelium ( Fig. 9-46) . A superficial perivascular to interstitial accumulation of predominantly lymphohistiocytic cells is typical, and subepidermal cleft and vesicle formation may occur owing to separation of the necrotic epithelium from the underlying connective tissue at the basement membrane zone. Pigmentary incontinence is common. Direct immunofluorescence testing usually yields negative results but may demonstrate IgG, IgM, or C3 between epidermal keratinocytes, around globoid bodies in the superficial dermis, or in association with dermal blood vessel walls.F: 273. 323 \n\nErythema multiforme may run a mild course, spontaneously regressing within a few weeks. An underlying cause should be sought and corrected, whenever possible, a procedure that also results in spontaneous resolution of the erythema multiforme.P-47, 323 FIGURE 9-46. Canine erythema multiforme major, The upper half of the epidermis has undergone coagulation necrosis and has separated from the viable epidermis below, Severe vesiculobullous cases of erythema multiforme require supportive care and an exhaustive search for underlying causes. When trigger factors can be identified and eliminated, the erythema multiforme usually resolves within 3 weeks. 323 In human medicine, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, especially glucocorticoids, in the treatment of erythema multiforme continues to be controversial.s?\" 323 Given the presumed immune-mediated pathogenesis of erythema multiforme, treatment with immunomodulating drugs would seem to make sense in cases in which elimination of potential trigger factors has been achieved yet the disease persists. 323 In fact, dogs with severe idiopathic erythema multiforme have been successfully treated with large doses of glucocorticoids and/or azathioprine.F\" Anecdotal reports suggest that cyclosporine's\" or etretinate''!\" may be useful in idiopathic erythema multiforme in dogs. We have used pentoxifylline successfully in a few cases, and this drug may warrant a trial prior to immunosuppressive drugs. All idiopathic cases should receive a novel antigen (\"hypoallergenic\") diet to rule out diet-related disease. 323 Even \"idiopathic\" cases have been known to spontaneously resolve after 4 to 12 months, suggesting that undocumented antigenic triggers had been eliminated.s'\"\n\nToxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare, variably painful, extensive vesiculobullous and ulcerative disorder of skin and oral mucosa in dogs, cats, and human beings. Less extensive cutaneous with mucosal involvement is often called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, though confusion in the veterinary and human literature has equated this with more severe erythema multiforme.P\"\n\nIn humans, toxic epidermal necrolysis has been temporally associated with drugs in 80% to 95% of cases.P'\" Fifty percent of the cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome are also drugrelated.P\" A variety of drugs and causes have been associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis in dogs (see Table 9_9 ). 56, 282, 291, 317, 324 Flea dips were implicated in both a dog and cat that experienced toxic epidermal necrolysis.P\" Some cases are idiopathic.\n\nAlthough the pathomechanism of toxic epidermal necrolysis is unknown, immunopathologic mechanisms have been suggested. 18 It has also been suggested that druginduced erythema multiforme major and toxic epidermal necrolysis may relate to defective epidermal detoxification of drug byproducts.P\" Fadok proposed that apoptosis may be induced and that it is massive and sudden in toxic epidermal necrolysis, but localized and more gradual in erythema multiforme.P\" In humans, apoptosis seems to be the key mechanism leading to keratinocyte death, and TNF-(\u00a5 is a major cytokine involved in apoptosis.P\" 313, 314, 325 Perforin (a cytoplasmic peptide contained in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells) has been suggested to playa role in keratinocyte apoptosis.P? In addition, the role of calcium in the regulation of apoptosis is crucial, and the expression of calprotectin (a calcium-binding protein) is increased in the epidermis of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis.s!' This information has led to the hypothesis that toxic drug metabolites stimulate keratinocytes to produce TNF-(\u00a5 and perturb calcium homeostasis, which leads to keratinocyte apoptosis in the absence of inflammatory cells. Other studies have suggested that the upregulation of keratinocyte Fas (\"cell-surface death receptor,\" CD95) is the critical trigger of keratinocyte destruction.F\" In dogs, one study could not demonstrate apoptosis in any of seven cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis, and it was thought that the epidermis in these cases was undergoing necrosis by a pathologic mechanism different from apoptosis.P\n\nThere are no apparent age, breed, or sex predilections. Clinically, toxic epidermal necrolysis is usually characterized by an acute onset of constitutional signs (pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy, depression) and a multifocal or generalized vesiculobullous disease (see Fig. 9 -38C and D). This may be a major differentiating feature from erythema multiforme because, in humans, all cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis are preceded by pyrexia. 30 1 Vesicles and bullae, necrosis, and resultant ulcers with epidermal collarettes may be found anywhere in the skin and often involve the oral mucosa, mucocutaneous junctions, and footpads. Nikolsky's sign is usually present. Cutaneous pain is usually moderate to marked.\n\nThe differential diagnosis is relatively limited in severe cases with constitutional signs and acute history, and it includes bums, systemic lupus erythematosus, severe erythema multiforme, superficial suppurative necrolytic dermatitis, and epitheliotropic lymphoma.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and skin biopsy. A hemogram usually reveals neutropenia or neutrophilia.56 In humans, persistent neutropenia portends a fatal outcome.l\"\n\nHistopathologic findings in toxic epidermal necrolysis are identical, regardless of underlying cause. They consist of hydropic degeneration of basal epidermal cells, full-thickness coagulation necrosis of the epidermis, and minimal dermal inflammation (silent dermis or cell-poor inflammation) (Fig. 9_47) . 22,47.71 Dermo-epidermal separation results in subepidermal vesicles ( Fig. 9-48 ). This is in contrast with the cell-rich inflammation that occurs in erythema multiforme.P\" 323 The periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive basement membrane zone, when present, is usually located at the floor of the vesicles. The infundibular region of hair follicle outer root sheath epithelium may be similarly affected. In humans, the atrichous sweat gland duct is often affected, but this has not been studied in animals. 296 It must be emphasized that toxic epidermal necrolysis is not usually the definitive diagnosis. It is imperative to remember that toxic epidermal necrolysis is only a cutaneous reaction pattern, and every attempt must be made to find the underlying cause. Results of direct and indirect immunofluorescence testing are usually negative. 18, 56, 269 In humans, immunohistochemical studies have shown that the cell-poor infiltrate in toxic epidermal necrolysis contains predominantly macrophages and dermal dendrocytes, unlike the cell-rich infiltrate rich in T lymphocytes found in erythema multtforme.v\"\n\nThe prognosis for toxic epidermal necrolysis is guarded to poor, pending identification of the underlying cause, with a mortality rate as high as 50% in humans.\"? The mortality is greatest in idiopathic cases, wherein a precipitating factor cannot be recognized and specifically corrected. The sequelae and prognosis are similar to those of a massive second-degree bum, owing to fluid, electrolyte, and colloid losses and to secondary infections and sepsis that compound the loss of epidermal barrier function. Mortality rates are lower when therapy in humans is conducted in specialty treatment centers for bum patients. 30l , 303 Treatment consists of (1) correction of the underlying cause and (2) symptomatic and supportive measures (e.g., fluids, antibiotics, topicals). The use of systemic glucocorticoids is controversial, some investigators thinking that these drugs are at best not helpful and, at worst, detrimental.\" The incidence of sepsis resulting in a higher fatality rate is the greatest concern, so the severity and extent of involvement may relate to the decision as to whether to use glucocorticoids. The administration of systemic glucocorticoids may be indicated, however, in drug-induced cases.IS Plasmapheresis has been beneficial in humans. 303 Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has been reported to be effective in humans, presumably via Fas (CD95) blockade.i''\" Recovery (depending on the identification and correction of the underlying cause) usually occurs in 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nCutaneous vasculitis is an uncommon disorder in dogs that is characterized by purpura (often palpable), wheals, edema, papules, plaques, nodules, alopecia, scarring, necrosis, and ulceration, often involving the extremities. In some cases, the lesions are slightly purpuric, appearing erythematous but not blanching with diascopy. Cutaneous vasculitis is rare in cats.\n\nVasculitides are classified histologically into neutrophilic, eosinophilic, lymphocytic, granulomatous, mixed forms, and cell-poor forms.f\"- 72 The neutrophilic forms may be leukocytoclastic (neutrophil nuclei undergo karyorrhexis, resulting in \"nuclear dust\") or nonleukocytoclastic.l- 18 In dogs, the nonleukocytoclastic form is more common, and two other forms of neutrophilic vasculitis occur.P In one there are associated skin lesions such as intraepidermal pustules, folliculitis, or neutrophilic spongiosis, and this pattern may be associated with bacterial skin infections or drug reactions. In the third neutrophilic form, the major lesion is thrombosis and resultant tissue ischemia. This pattern is more often associated with gram-negative septicemia and infections that target the endothelial cells.P Eosinophilic vasculitis is associated with arthropod reactions, food hypersensitivity, eosinophilic granuloma, and mast cell tumors.P-72, 342 However, the \"vasculitic\" nature of these eosinophil-associated lesions has been challenged.v\" Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with vasculitis associated with cyclosporine administration was observed in a dog with periocular edema and alopecia and a swelling at the base of one ear. 349 In humans, vasculitis is also categorized by the size of the affected vessel (large or small), though this has been considered of little value in the dog and cat. 72 , 339 In most cases, cutaneous vasculitis involves small dermal blood vessels (postcapillary venules). Vasculitis can occur via immune and nonimmune mechanisms.P: 330, 341 As a cause of cutaneous disease, vasculitis most commonly is thought to be immunologically mediated and the result of a drug reaction or infection.F: 347 The pathomechanism of most cutaneous vasculitides is assumed to involve Type III hypersensitivity reactions.14, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] 69 Type I hypersensitivity reactions may be important in the initiation of immune complex deposition in blood vessel walls. However, it appears to be more complex, and multiple mechanisms likely playa role. It has been postulated that differences in membrane receptors (probably adhesion molecules and cytokines) for immunoglobulin and complement on leukocytes may account for the different histologic appearances of neutrophilic and lymphocytic vasculitides.\" Additionally, initial neutrophilinduced damage to endothelial cells could result in the expression of \"not self' antigens, whereupon dendritic cells and T cells could initiate a secondary cell-mediated immune response, thus perpetuating the vascular disease and producing a lymphocyte-dominated infiltrate.P? In cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, endothelial cells show increased expression of ICAM-l and E-selectin. 347 E-selectin is an adhesion molecule for neutrophils. In some cases and forms of vasculitis there has been an association with the presence of autoantibodies that react with neutrophil cytoplasmic structures (e.g., proteinase-3, myeloperoxidase) or endothelial cells. 337 , 347 Cutaneous vasculitis may be associated with coexisting disease (infections, food hypersensitivity, insect bites, malignancies, connective tissue disorders [such as lupus erythematosus]), precipitating factors (infections, drugs, vaccines), or it may be idiopathic (about 50% of all cases).\" Infections may induce immune complex or septic vasculitis. 22, 72, 282 About 7.5% of the dogs treated with itraconazole at 10 mglkglday experience cutaneous vasculitis (lymphedema and/or necrotizing lesions on one or more limbs), whereas dogs treated with 5 mglkglday do not experience this reaction.P\" Focal cutaneous vasculitis reactions at the site of rabies vaccination have been described in dogs, and rabies viral antigen was detected in blood vessel walls.F' In a retrospective study of cutaneous vasculitis in 18 dogs and 1 cat, food hypersensitivity was diagnosed in 2 dogs, adverse drug reaction in 2 dogs, rabies vaccine reaction in 4 dogs, and the condition was idiopathic in 10 dogs. The 1 cat had vaccine-related vasculitis. 342 Certain breeds may be predisposed, such as Jack Russell terriers, Scottish terriers, German shepherd dogs, Greyhounds, Dachshunds, and Hottweilers.P\" 328. 343. 344. 350 Vaccine reactions are more commonly recognized in Poodles, silky terriers, Yorkshire terriers, Pekingese, and Maltese, which may reflect breed predilection, small body size, or the long period of anagen hair growth and \"fuzzy\" haircoat phenotype in these breeds.F\" In one survey, two of four cases were the Bichon breed, one Maltese and one Poodle. 342 The breed associations may suggest some genetic component to the etiology of some forms of vasculitis, as has been suggested in humans because of HLA associations.P'\"\n\nSkin is often the only organ system involved. However, other organ systems may be affected, wherein the skin lesions may represent the initial sign of a systemic disease. Skin lesions typically occur in dependent areas of the body, in skin over areas of pressure and normal \"wear and tear,\" and in skin covering extremities (pinnae, tip of tail, and so forth) that are more susceptible to cold environmental influences. Cutaneous signs of vasculitis usually include palpable purpura, plaques, hemorrhagic bullae, papules or pustules, necrosis, punched-out (crateriform) ulcers, and occasionally acrocyanosis, especially involving the extremities (paws, pinnae, lips, tail, scrotum, and oral mucosa), and they may clearly be associated with vascular pathways (see Fig. 9 -38E to G; Figs. 9-49 to 9-54). Pinnal lesions are often more prevalent on the apex and concave surface (see Fig. 9 -51). Hemorrhages may occur within the claw (see Fig. 9 -52). Pads may develop central punched-out ulcers (see Fig. 9 -38E) or depressed scarred or crusted plaques (see Fig. 9 -53) . Generalized urticaria may occur and, in our experience as well as in the results of one study, this is more common with food hypersensitivity as the underlying etiology (see Fig. 9 -50).342 Edematous plaques and lymphedema may be present on the extremities or in the groin (see Figs. 9-38H and 9-54). The lesions mayor may not be painful. In some animals, widespread erythema that may be purplish or cyanotic occurs. The erythematous skin does not blanch with diascopy, confirming its purpuric nature ( Fig. 9-55 ).330 Rarely, subcutaneous nodules are noted, which represent panniculitis caused by septal vasculitis.P\" 345 Constitutional signs may be present, including anorexia, depression, and pyrexia. Although extracutaneous signs are uncommon, polyarthropathy, myopathy, neuropathy, hepatopathy, thrombocytopenia, and anemia have been reported in some dogs and cats. 330 \u2022 338, 341 Any age, breed, or sex may be affected.\n\nA proliferative thromhovascular necrosis of the pinnae has been recognized in dogs. 333 , 334 The etiology is unknown, and there are no apparent age, breed, or sex predilections, Lesions begin on the apical margins of the pinnae and spread along the concave surface. An elongated necrotic ulcer is at the center of the lesions. There is often a thickened, scaly, hyperpigmented zone surrounding the ulcers (Fig. 9-56A and B), The lesions are wedge-shaped, with the wide base at the pinnal apex. As the ulcer enlarges, the older areas undergo complete necrosis, resulting in a deformed pinnal margin. A focal cutaneous vasculitis and alopecia at the sites of rabies vaccination has been described in dogs. 22, 253, 270, 327, 351 Poodles and Yorkshire and silky terriers appeared to be predisposed, Reactions were characterized by roughly annular areas of variable alopecia, hyperpigmentation, and, less commonly, scaling or erythema overlying a variably indurated dermis and subcutis. The caudal or lateral thigh, or the withers, are typically affected ( Fig.  9-57 ). The lesions generally appear 3 to 6 months after the subcutaneous administration of vaccine and persist for months to years.\n\nA cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (\"Alabama rot,\" \"Greenetrack disease\") has been described in kenneled and racing, related and unrelated, Greyhounds (see Chap. 12). 328, 329 No age (6 months to 6 years) or sex predilections exist. Palpable purpura, with lesions pinpoint to 10 em in diameter, is characterized by reddened areas that rapidly become dark red to purple to black and then slough. Lesions are multiple and most commonly occur on the limbs and, less commonly, the groin and trunk (Figs. 9-58 and 9-59). Within 1 to 2 days, the lesions ulcerate and discharge a serosanguineous fluid. The ulcers are well-demarcated and usually extend into the subcutis. Healing is slow, resulting in scar formation within 1 to 2 months. Many dogs experience pitting edema, especially distal to the stifle or elbow, on limbs that have ulcers. In most dogs, new lesions do not develop after the initial lesions resolve. Some dogs experience pyrexia, lethargy, polydipsia, polyuria, vomiting, dark or tarry stools, and acute renal failure. This syndrome is thought to be produced by verotoxin (shiga-like toxin) elaborated by E. coli in contaminated raw beef products (similar to the herrwlytic-uremic syndrome in people).329 A genetic predisposition may help explain the susceptibility of Creyhounds.P'\" Familial (autosomal recessive trait) cutaneous vasculopathy of German shepherd dogs has been reported in young puppies.\"? These dogs experience pyrexia and lethargy, most commonly associated with swollen, depigmented foot pads. Alopecia, crusts, and ulceration may also occur, involving the pinnae, tail, and nasal planum. Footpad biopsies demonstrate varying degrees and combinations of nodular dermatitis, collagenolysis, vascular degeneration, vasculitis, and cell-poor interface dermatitis with basal cell apoptosis. The changes may partly reflect the stage of disease at the time of biopsy. The cause is not determined, though a variety of immunologic test results have been normal.\n\nIschemic dermatopathy is a syndrome that results from loss of blood supply from either vasculitis or vasculopathy. In some cases, a relationship between vasculitis and vasculopathy is present because both histopathologic lesions may occur in the same case and may reflect stage of lesion development at time of sampling\" This syndrome is exemplified by what has been called the prototypical form of ischemic dermatopathy, postrabies vaccination alopecia.P\" In addition, lesions of canine dermatomyositis are thought to represent ischemic dermatopathy. 72. 332. 348 This has also been proposed for the vascular diseases that are considered cell-poor, such as familial German shepherd vasculopathy, some \"lupoid\" dermatoses, and the disease in Creyhounds.P To date, the reports primarily have been associated with vaccine reactions, with lesions occurring in a wider distribution than just at the site of vaccination.P'< 348 A typical postvaccinal lesion is visible at the site of injection about 2 to 8 months after vaccination, and multiple multifocal lesions develop within 1 to 5 months after the appearance of the injection site lesion. The lesions are various combinations of plaques, nodules, alopecia, scale, erosions, ulcers, crusts, hyperpigmentation, and scarring (see Fig. 9 -57). Lesions may occur at the site of vaccination, pinnae (usually the apex and often the concave surface, especially at the pinnal margins), face, paw pads, tip of the tail, periocular region, and over bony prominences. Erosions and ulcers may be seen on the tongue. An associated ischemic, atrophic myopathy may be present.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes coagulopathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, cold agglutinin disease, frostbite, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and lymphoreticular neoplasia. When urticarial lesions predominate, hypersensitivity disorders not associated with vasculitis are also differential diagnoses. Definitive diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and skin biopsy. Histopathology reveals varying degrees of neutrophilic, eosinophilic, or lymphocytic vasculitis ( Fig. 9-60) , possibly reflecting the age of the lesions and the types of immunoreactants.w 71 Fibrinoid necrosis is not usually present. 4 7 , 348 Involvement of deep dermal vessels may suggest systemic disease. When the deep vasculature is affected, necrosis of appendages and subcutaneous fat may occur. The lesions most likely to show diagnostic changes are those from 8 to 24 hours old. In some biopsies, the diagnosis of vasculitis or vasculopathy is suspected on the basis of a cell-poor hydropic interface dermatitis, mural folliculitis, and the loss of definition and staining intensity and ultimate atrophy or necrosis of hair follicles (\"fading follicles\") ( Fig. 9-61 ). Sebaceous and sweat glands may be similarly, but less frequently, affected. Hyalinization of dermal collagen and hypovascularity as demonstrated by decreased factor VIII staining of blood vessels may be present.P\" Once the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis has been established, it is imperative that underlying etiologic factors be sought and eliminated (Table 9 -10).\n\nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in dogs with bacteremia, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, leishmaniasis, sarcocystosis, parvovirus and coronavirus infections, drug reactions, vaccine reactions, staphylococcal hypersensitivity, and as an idiopathic occurrence.s\"- 56. 330. 335, 341 In addition, lymphocytic or eosinophilic vasculitis has been recognized in dogs with drug reaction, severe scabies and flea bite hypersensitivity, food hypersensitivity, and arthropod bites/stings.f\" 72. 342 In cats, cutaneous vasculitis has been associated with drug administration, vaccination (rabies, herpes virus-calictvirus-panleukopenia), infections (FeLV, FIV, FIP), and idiopathy.F': 338,341 Proliferative thrombovascular necrosis of the pinnae is characterized by arteriolar proliferation, sclerosis, hyaline degeneration, and eventually thrombosis.P\" No inflammatory vasculitis is present. Focal vasculitis and alopecia subsequent to rabies vaccination is characterized by vasculitis affecting the arterioles of the deep dermis and subcutis, septal panniculitis, fat necrosis, focal lymphoid nodules, and marked atrophy or necrosis of the overlying adnexa (see Fig. 9 -61; Figs. 9-62 and 9_63)., 341 Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy is characterized by mild to severe changes in the arterioles and arteries of the deep dermis and subcutis.F\" These changes range from increased eosinophilia of the tunica media to pyknosis and karyorrhexis and, occasionally, fibrinoid necrosis. Vascular thrombosis and ischemia result in purpura and cutaneous infarcts. Many affected Greyhounds, especially those with azotemia, have thrombocytopenia, normocytic normochromic anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased serum creatine kinase activity.:J29\n\nDirect immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing may demonstrate immunoglobulin, complement, or both in vessel walls and occasionally at the basement membrane zone in both the neutrophilic and lymphocytic forms of cutaneous vasculitis (see Fig. 9-1D) . 5. 18.56 In humans, the most common immunoreactants are C3, IgM, and fibrin in a granular pattern within the vessel walI.:J41 These tests are usually not needed, however, and are not particularly useful for diagnosis. If they are performed, they are best done within the first 4 hours after lesion formation and no later than 24 hours.f\" 341 Studies in humans have shown that the intradermal injection of 0.02 ml of a histamine phosphate solution into the skin of patients with active cutaneous vasculitis was a reliable method for demonstrating the deposition of immunoreactants, with direct immunofluorescence testing of the injection site performed 4 hours after injection.\"\n\nDogs with active vasculitis may have increased levels of circulating immune complexes, decreased levels of serum complement, and hypergammaglobulinemiaY\n\nIt is difficult to predict the course of the disease in any individual case. A single episode lasting a few weeks may occur, or the disorder may be chronic or recurrent. The outcome depends on the extent of internal organ involvement (especially renal and neurologic) and the underlying or precipitating factor(s).\n\nTreatment of vasculitis consists of correction of the underling cause and immunomodulatory drug treatment. 18. 56 In less severe cases, initial therapy with pentoxifYlline is indicated because of its relative lack of side effects and some reports of success (see Chap. 3).342. 348 Pentoxifylline was apparently effective in four of seven rabies vaccineassociated vasculitides (which required 2 to .5 months of therapy) but was of no benefit in leukocytoclastic vasculitides.P'< :348 In more severe cases of vasculitis, especially neutrophilic types, systemic prednisone or prednisolone (2 to 4 mglkg orally q24h) is initially used, with or without pentoxifylline.f\" 330, 338 For cases that are refractory to glucocorticoids, sulfones such as dapsone (1 mg/kg orally q8h in dogs; 1 mg/kg orally q24h with caution in cats) or sulfasalazine (20 to 40 mg/kg orally q8h in dogs) may be effective.f\" :340, .341, :343 The combination of glucocorticoid and dapsone may be synergistic,343 Large doses of vitamin E may be a useful adjunctive therapy.341, 343 Cyclophosphamide has been useful in some patients.t? and colchicine is often beneficial in humans.l\" Azathioprine has been effective in some dogs, as has the combination of tetracycline and niacinamide.P\" In some cases, therapy can be stopped after 4 to 6 months of treatment. Other patients require longterm maintenance therapy with lower drug doses and reduced frequency of administration (see Chap, 3). The vasculitis occurring with itraconazole therapy can often be eliminated by reducing the dose from 10 mg/kg/day to 5 mglkg/day (see Chap. 5),\n\n\u2022 Proliferative thrombooascular necrosis of the pinnae is slowly progressive and usually unresponsive to all medical therapies that have been tried. 333 Anecdotal reports suggest that pentoxifylline or the combination of tetracycline and niacinamide are occasionally effective.341 In our experience, pentoxifylline has been helpful to totally successful in thrombotic pinnal diseases, possibly through its effect of increasing peripheral perfusion and/or its anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nIf pentoxifylline is ineffective, the treatment of choice is partial surgical removal of the pinna. Relapses have occurred only when attempts were made to save as much tissue as possible. Focal cutaneous vasculitis and alopecia subsequent to injections may also respond (up to 75% reduction in lesion size) to pentoxifylline or may be treated by complete surgical excision, or it occasionally spontaneously resolves.V\": 348 It would be logical to not repeat the incriminated vaccine, unless required by law.327, 341 One could avoid the local vaccine reaction by giving the product intramuscularly, but generalized reactions would still be possible.P?\n\nLinear IgA pustular dermatosis is a very rare idiopathic, sterile superficial pustular dermatosis of Dachshunds, characterized histologically by subcorneal pustules and immunologically by the deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone of affected skin. 56. 352 It is not analogous to a similarly named dermatosis of humans.f 18 Clinically, linear IgA pustular dermatosis is characterized by multifocal to generalized pustular dermatitis. The trunk is typically involved. Secondary skin lesions include annular areas of alopecia, erosion, epidermal collarettes, hyperpigmentation, scaling, and crusting (see Fig. 9-56C ). Pruritus is minimal to absent, and the dogs are otherwise healthy. All cases to date have been recognized in adult Dachshunds of either sex.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes bacterial folliculitis, dermatophytosis, demodicosis, pemphigus foliaceus, and subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Cytologic examination of pus reveals nondegenerate neutrophils, no microorganisms, and an occasional or no acantholytic keratinocytes. Diagnosis is based on culture (negative) and skin biopsy (intraepidermal pustular dermatitis, with numerous non degenerate neutrophils and minimal acantholysis) (Fig. 9-64 ), and direct immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing (IgA deposited at the basement membrane zone).\n\nTherapy consists of large doses of prednisolone or prednisone (2.2 to 4.4 mglkg orally q24h, then an alternate-day regimen) or dapsone (1 mgikg orally q8h, then as needed) (see Chap. 3). Interestingly, glucocorticoids may work in one case and not another. The same is true of dapsone.\n\nThe uveodermatologic syndrome (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome) is a rare, idiopathic syndrome of concurrent granulomatous uveitis and depigmenting dermatitis in dogs.361.364 \n\nThe cause of this syndrome is unknown. The syndrome has similarities to the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in humans, which is currently thought to represent an autoimmune disorder.!\" 353, 356, 358, 359, 364 In humans, cell-mediated hypersensitivity to melanin and melanocytes has been demonstrated, as have antibodies against melanin, gangliosides, and photoreceptors.s'\" Antiretinal antibodies were demonstrated in a dog. 360\n\nIn humans, the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome has three phases: (1) a meningoencephalitic phase with prodromata of fever, malaise, headache, tinnitus, nausea, and vomiting, (2) an ophthalmic phase with photophobia, uveitis, decreased visual acuity, and potential blindness, and (3) a dermatologic phase with poliosis (90% of cases), alopecia (73%), and vitiligo (63%),18,364 The dermatologic signs are usually symmetric, especially involving the head, neck, and eyelids, and they usually mark the convalescent stage when the uveitis begins to abate, The pigmentary changes tend to be permanent,\n\nIn dogs, there are no apparent age (6 months to 13 years) or sex predilections, but Akitas, Chows, Samoyeds, and Siberian huskies appear to be predlsposed. Pe 356, 358, 359, 361, 364 The syndrome is usually characterized by the acute onset of uveitis and concurrent or subsequent depigmentation of the nose, lips, eyelids, and occasionally the footpads, scrotum, prepuce, anus, and hard palate (see Fig, 9 -56D to F), The cutaneous lesions usually appear within 10 days of the recognition of the ocular lesions, but they occasionally occur several months later. 364\n\nIn one dog, a concurrent onychomadesis was present.362 Oral ulcerations rarely occur,358, 363 In most cases, skin lesions are mild, consisting of well-demarcated depigmentation with or without mild erythema and scale. Some cases, however, progress or even rapidly develop more marked dermatitis, with depigmented areas developing varying degrees of erosion, ulceration, and crusting. Perhaps some of the dermatitis may be associated with exposure to sunlight (photodermatitisj.'? Patchy leukotrichia may be present in the areas surrounding the cutaneous depigmentation. Rarely, leukoderma and leukotrichia are widespread.P': 355, 361 Clinicopathologic evidence of a meningoencephalitic phase is rare in dogs, though one case with second cranial nerve deficits was reported. 357, 364 Clinical signs referable to the uveitis (anterior and posterior) may include photophobia, blepharospasm, lacrimation, conjunctival congestion, corneal edema, retinal detachment, glaucoma, cataract, and blindness.v'\"\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and skin biopsy. Histopathologic findings in specimens taken from early skin lesions are characterized by lichenoid interface dermatitis, wherein large histiocytes are a major cellular component (Figs. 9-65 and 9_66).22,56.71,364 Pigmentary incontinence is pronounced, but hydropic degeneration of epidermal basal cells is rare. Cytology of aqueous humor in one case revealed an infiltrate of predominantly macrophages.\"\" Histopathologic findings in the eye include granulomatous panuveitis and retinitis, and degenerative changes of the optic nerve and tract may occur.P'\" Results of direct and indirect immunofluorescence testing are usually negative.\"\n\nPatients with poorly controlled uveitis often experience posterior synechiae with secondary glaucoma, cataracts, and vision loss. Thus, aggressive early treatment is essential. Topical or subconjunctival glucocorticoids and topical cycloplegics (e.g., atropine) are beneficial in patients with anterior uveitis. Systemic glucocorticoids and azathioprine are needed to combat posterior uveitis and dermatologic signs. 359, 363 Topical cyclosporine was useful in one dog. 361 If the disease is treated early, variable degrees of cutaneous repigmentation (sometimes complete) usually occur. 355. 361 Occasionally, these cases may respond to systemic glucocorticoids alone, but because blindness may result from delaying an effective therapy and because more aggressive therapy is often required, we recommend combination immunosuppressive therapy.361 Dogs usually require long-term alternate-morning oral glucocorticoid therapy (e.g., 0.25 to 1.1 mglkg prednisone or prednisolone) to prevent recurrence.P\" We have seen some very good responses with the combination of tetracycline and niacinamide (see Chap. 3). This drug combination has allowed marked reduction in or discontinuation of systemic glucocorticoid therapy. The response of the skin lesions should not be used to assess response to therapy because uveitis may be active while the skin is improving.P\" Ophthalmic examinations should be periodically performed even when the cutaneous changes are in remission.\n\nAuricular chondritis (\"relapsing polychondritis\") is a rare disease of cats and dogs characterized by inflammation and destruction of auricular cartilage. 18. 53. 368. 369 In humans, a somewhat similar condition is called relapsing polychondritis. 18 However, in cats, only the auricular cartilage is affected, and the condition has not been reported to have a relapsing nature. Hence, in cats, the term relapsing polychondritis is presently inappropriate.v\"\n\nRelapsing polychondritis is often classified among the immune-mediated diseases because of similarities to rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus as well as its favorable response to immunomodulatory therapy. In humans, antibodies against Type II collagen may be demonstrated in some cases.\" In one dog, a definitive cause was not determined, though chronic otitis preceded the development of the auricular chondritis.P\"\n\nAffected cats and the one dog presented with a history of swollen, erythematous, painful ears. 54 \u2022 366-368 When examined, the pinnae are swollen and meaty, erythematous to violaceous, and curled and deformed (see Fig. 9-56G and H; Fig. 9-67) . Typically, both pinnae are affected, although one may be more severely affected than the other, or the condition may be initially unilateral, then bilateral.P\" Cats may be otherwise healthy or may show signs of pyrexia, lethargy, and anorexia. In cats, no age (1 to 14 years), sex, or breed predilections are evident.P'\" The dog had a history of nonerosive polyarthritis and laxity of digital and carpal joints as well as otitis prior to the development of auricular chondritis. \n\nBiopsies reveal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, loss of cartilage basophilia, and cartilage necrosis (Fig. 9_68 ).47.365 Hematologic examinations may demonstrate variable degrees of neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, and hyperglobulinemia.?\" One cat was positive for ANA but also had concurrent FIV infection.P\" Direct immunofluorescence testing was negative in two cats.F!\n\nCats that are in no pain and show no systemic signs may do fine without therapy. Systemic glucocorticoids were ineffective in eight cats. 371, 375 Dapsone (1 mglkg q24h) induced a remission in four cats, and no relapse occurred when therapy was stopped. 365,368 Permanent deformity of the pinnae is to be expected, whether or not the cat is treated. Surgical excision was effective in eliminating the discomfort and gross lesions in the one dog. 365\n\nImmunoproliferative enteropathy of Basenjis is characterized by chronic intractable diarrhea, progressive emaciation, and gastropathy.47. 370 An autosomal recessive inheritance of the condition has been hypothesized. A similar disease exists in humans.\n\nBasenjis of either sex and a wide age range are affected. Skin lesions are variable and may consist of alopecia, hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis, and marginal necrosis and ulceration of the pinnae or a symmetric alopecia of the ventrum. The haircoat is often dry and dull.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Most affected dogs have hypergammaglobulinemia. Some dogs are hypothyroid. Intestinal biopsy reveals lymphoplasmacytic enteritis.\n\nDermatohistopathologic findings are nondiagnostic. Alopecic skin is characterized by endocrinopathic changes, probably reflecting hypothyroidism, Dermatitic pinnae are characterized by ulcerative perivascular dermatitis, necrosis, and changes consistent with secondary bacterial infection. Although the clinical appearance of the pinnae is suggestive of a vasculopathy, histologic evidence of vessel disease has not been reported. Therapy is provided according to symptoms and is often disappointing. Genetic counseling, avoidance of stress, and high-quality commercial diets are indicated. Systemic glucocorticoids may be beneficial.\n\nAlopecia areata is an uncommon disorder of dogs and cats characterized by patches of nonscarring hair loss that grossly is noninflammatory.\n\nAlopecia areata is of complex pathogenesis with immunologic targeting of anagen hair follicles and the relatively consistent finding of antifollicular autoantibodies (IgG class) as well as CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the affected follicles in humans.F\" T lymphocytes and antifollicular antibodies have also been documented in the dog. 374 In dogs, autoantibodies are directed against trichohyalin, inner root sheath, and hair matrix antigens. 373. 375. 376 This is different from the findings in humans and mice, wherein the outer root sheath and hair matrix are most often targeted.F\" CD4+ and CD8+ perifollicular lymphocytes and af3, CD8+ intrabulbar T cells have been described in dogs. 373. 374 In addition, many CD1 + dendritic antigen-presenting cells are present in the perifollicular dermis.F\" Other observations in humans supporting the immunologic basis are (1) accumulations of lymphoid cells (helper T cells) around hair bulbs during the active phase of the disease, (2) occasional association of alopecia areata with other immune-mediated diseases, (3) increased incidence of various autoantibodies in alopecia areata, (4) decreased numbers of circulating T cells, (5) abnormal presence of Langerhans' cells in the follicular bulb, (6) increased expression of class I and II MHC antigens (7) the deposition of C3 or IgG and IgM or both at the basement membrane zone of the hair follicles in lesional and normal scalp as revealed by direct immunofluorescence testing, and (8) the therapeutic benefit of inducing delayed-type hypersensitivity and immunosuppressive therapies. In addition, genetic, endocrine, and psychological factors have been thought to play a role in humans with alopecia areata.l\" 373 Morphologic abnormalities of melanocytes in follicular bulbs have been described in humans with alopecia areata. Cytokines IL-1a, IL-1f3, and TNF-a are potent inhibitors of hair follicle growth and in vitro produce changes in hair follicle morphology similar to those in alopecia areata. 372a\n\nIn dogs and cats, alopecia areata is characterized by focal or multifocal patches of asymptomatic, noninflammatory alopecia.P: 47. 373 There are no apparent age or sex predilections. Though few cases have been reported, the Dachshund may be over-represented.\"? The alopecic areas are well circumscribed, and the exposed skin appears normal ( Fig. 9-69 ). Chronically alopecic areas may become variably hyperpigmented.\n\nLesions may occur anywhere, especially the head, neck, and trunk. Lesions may be solitary or numerous and may be asymmetric or symmetric. Rarely, alopecia progresses to involve the majority of the body (Fig. 9-70 ). Hair growth may occur spontaneously, with the initially regrown hair being white, only to later be replaced by pigmented hair (Fig.  9_71 ).373 Microscopic examination of hairs plucked from the margin of enlarging lesions reveals a mixture of normal telogen, dysplastic, and \"exclamation point\" hairs-short, stubby hairs with frayed, fractured, pigmented distal ends whose shafts undulate or taper toward the proximal end ( Fig. 9-72) . Occasionally, alopecia areata may be confined to the dark-haired areas of multicolored haircoats ( Fig. 9-73 ). Claw changes compatible with trachyonychia (roughening, ridging, vertical striations) were seen in one dog and were compared to those occasionally occurring in humans with alopecia areata.?\"\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes traction alopecia, injection reactions, acquired pattern alopecia, topical steroid reaction, follicular dysplasia, dermatophytosis, demodicosis, staphy- lococcal folliculitis, pseudopelade, psychogenic alopecia, and endocrinopathies. Definitive diagnosis is based on the insidious onset of asymptomatic, well-circumscribed areas of noninflammatory alopecia and on skin biopsy.\n\nThe characteristic early histopathologic findings include a peribulbar accumulation of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. 22 \u2022 71 This has been described as looking like a \"swarm of bees\" (Fig. 9-74 ). This early change may be difficult to demonstrate, and specimens may only show a few inflammatory cells with apoptosis of bulbar keratinocytes. Finding helpful diagnostic lesions is aided by performing multiple biopsies from the advancing edges of early lesions. Later, the histopathologic findings consist of a predominance of catagen and telogen hair follicles as well as follicular atrophy. Hair follicles may be distorted in contour, with follicular and hair shaft dysplasia and peribulbar pigmentary incontinence. Chronic lesions may show complete absence of hair follicles and a fibrous tract associated with orphaned epitrichial sweat and sebaceous glands and arrector pili muscles. As in humans.F? eosinophils may be found in the peribulbar infiltrate and within the fibrous tracts of dogs with alopecia areata.\n\nThe prognosis for alopecia areata in humans is usually good; most patients recover completely within 3 to 5 years with or without therapy. Although topical, intralesional, or systemic glucocorticoids are often recommended for the treatment of alopecia areata in humans, dogs, and cats, there is only anecdotal evidence that they are beneficial.l\" 47, 373 The biological behavior of alopecia areata in dogs and cats is unclear. Most dogs and cats with one or a few lesions spontaneously recover after a course of 6 months to 2 years.\" Initial hair regrowth is often a color lighter than normal (leukotrichia).\n\nA variety of immunomodulatory therapies have been used in humans and mice, including corticosteroids, contact sensitizers, cyclosporine, minoxidil, and UV exposure with or without concurrent psoralen therapy.l\" 372a, 373 Dachshund. Alopecia of pinnae and around eyes. The black hairs were lost, but the tan hairs on the muzzle and eyebrows were retained.\n\nPseudopelade is a rare disorder of dogs and cats characterized by alopecia that grossly is noninflammatory.\n\nPseudopelade appears to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. Immunologic studies conducted on skin biopsies from two dogs 377 and one cat 378 have shown a predominance of af3, CD8+ lymphocytes within the epithelium of the hair follicle isthmus. The perifollicular dermis was rich in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes as well as CDI + dendritic antigen-presenting cells. Circulating autoantibodies (IgG class) against multiple lower hair follicle proteins (including hair keratins) and trichohyalin were demonstrated in four dogs, but not in the cat.\n\nPseudopelade has been described in 1-to 11-year-old dogs with no apparent breed or sex predilections.P\" Lesions have been characterized by well-circumscribed, noninflammatory areas of alopecia, which varied from 2 to 8 em in diameter in one or more body areas to a diffuse alopecia sparing only the head and neck. Some lesions were scaly and/or hyperpigmented. Pruritus and constitutional signs were absent.\n\nCats present with more-or-less symmetric, noninflammatory alopecia that may begin on the face (Fig. 9-75) , then spread to the ventrum, legs, and paws (Fig. 9_76) . 378, 379 Onychomadesis has been a constant finding (see Fig. 9 -76).\n\nThe differential diagnosis is as described for alopecia areata. Definitive diagnosis is based on skin biopsy. Histopathologically, the differential diagnosis includes those entities characterized by lymphocytic mural folliculitis (see Chap. 11). \n\nThe characteristic early histopathologic findings include a variably severe accumulation of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and fewer plasma cells that is most intense at the follicular isthmus (Fig. 9_77) . 377, 378 In cats, small numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils may also be present, In early lesions, inflammation is marked, atrophic changes are mild to absent, and sebaceous glands are present. In late lesions, atrophic changes are severe, inflammation is mild, and sebaceous glands are often absent,\n\nThis condition has failed to respond to topical and systemic glucocorticoids as well as chlorambucil.F\" 379 In cats, anecdotal reports indicate that cyclosporine may be effective. 379 Spontaneous remission has not been reported,\n\nAmyloidosis is a generic term that signifies the abnormal extracellular deposition of one of a family of unrelated proteins that share certain characteristic staining properties and ultrastructural features.P 18, 381, 389 Amyloidosis is not a single disease entity, and amyloid may accumulate as a result of a variety of different pathogenetic mechanisms. In the dog and cat, most cases of amyloidosis are related to deposition of immunoglobulin light chains, 22, 25, 386 \n\nDifferent amino acid compositions of amyloid may occur. 385 , 389 Amyloid deposits contain a nonfibrillar protein called amyloid-P, which is identical to a normal circulating plasma globulin known as serum amyloid-P (an elastase inhibitor that may help protect amyloid deposits from degradation and phagocytosis), Primary and myeloma-associated systemic amyloidosis have immunoglobulin light chains (mostly the lambda type) as precursors to the amyloid fibril protein, which is called amyloid-L. In secondary systemic amyloidosis (associated with chronic inflammation), a serum precursor protein, serum amyloid-A (a high-density lipoprotein and acute-phase reactant), forms the fibrils in the amyloid deposits. Serum amyloid-A is thought to be cleaved proteolytically by macrophages to amyloid-A and excreted extracellularly.\n\nAlthough the pathogenesis of amyloidosis is unclear, it is morphologically related to cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, plasma cells, and keratinocytes. Functional studies suggest that such cells play at least a partial role in the genesis of amyloidosis.\n\nUltimately, amyloid deposits lead to changes in tissue architecture and function. In dogs and cats, amyloidosis is usually associated with chronic inflammatory disease, neoplasia, and accumulations of plasma cells. 22, 25, 381, 386 It has also been associated with a vasculitic syndrome.P\" It has also been suggested that vaccination reactions caused polyarthritis in 12 Akitas, 33% of which progressed to renal amyloidosis.i'\" A familial tendency has been detected in Chinese Shar pei and beagle dogs and in Abyssinian and Siamese cats. 381. 382. 385, 387 \n\nMost commonly, amyloidosis is an internal disease, usually affecting the kidneys, spleen, and liver, with death often resulting from the renal involvement. 25, 381 Cutaneous lesions are described in dogs with systemic amyloidosis and primary cutaneous disease.P Cutane- ous lesions with systemic amyloidosis associated with a monoclonal gammopathy was reported in an adult female Cocker spaniel,388 Cutaneous hemorrhage could be induced by flicking the abdominal skin briskly with a finger or by removing hair (Fig. 9-78 ). If the skin was traumatized severely, blood oozed through the skin within seconds and clotted immediately. Skin biopsy revealed an amorphous, homogeneous, eosinophilic superficial dermis. The walls of the blood vessels in the involved area were thickened by deposition of the homogeneous eosinophilic material (Fig. 9-79 ). The material was Congo redpositive (congophilia), and a green birefringence of the material was visible in Congo redstained sections examined with polarized light (dichroism). A monoclonal serum IgG paraprotein was found. No treatment was given, and the dog remained unchanged for 14 months.\n\nMucocutaneous amyloidosis unassociated with monoclonal gammopathy was reported in a 3-year-old Brittany spaniel.\"? The dog had multiple, whitish to ulcerated papular and plaquelike lesions on the tongue and gingiva as well as oozing ulcers on the footpads, ventral surface of the interdigital spaces, and multiple pressure points (elbows, stifles). A case of generalized amyloidosis was described in a lO-week-old German shepherd puppy.384 It presented with swollen erythematous pads and reluctance to walk. Though amyloidosis was found at necropsy, the pads only showed chronic exudative inflammation.\n\nPrimary nodular cutaneous amyloidosis has been described as the most common type of cutaneous amyloidosis in dogs and cats. 22 Solitary or grouped dermal or subcutaneous nodules may occur anywhere but more commonly involve the ear. Some nodules may ulcerate secondary to necrosis. In humans, nodular amyloidosis is considered to be a plasmacytoma that locally produces immunoglobulin light chains as precursors to amyloid fibrils. 386, 389 This may be the case in dogs as well. The differential diagnosis for these lesions would be neoplasia, cysts, and infectious or sterile nodular granulomas. Diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination, which shows multiple dermal accumulations of amorphous eosinophilic material. Small numbers of plasma cells are found, as well as macrophages and small numbers of lymphocytes.\n\nThe diagnosis of amyloidosis is confirmed by biopsy.22 Light-microscopic examination reveals the deposition of an eosinophilic amorphous substance that is congophilic and birefringent when polarized (Fig. 9_80 ).389 Secondary-but not primary and myelomaassociated-amyloid loses its congophilia after pretreatment with potassium permanganate. Electron-microscopic examination reveals the characteristic presence of 7.5-to 10nm-wide linear, nonbranching tubular fibrils, each fibril being composed of several filaments arranged in a ,B-pleated sheet configuration.P?\n\nSolitary nodules un associated with systemic disease can be successfully excised. Successful treatment of multiple lesions is not reported. In humans, skin lesions of both primary and myeloma-associated amyloidosis have responded to DMSO, which may inhibit amyloid synthesis or act to promote amyloid degradation.P\" FIGURE 9-80.
