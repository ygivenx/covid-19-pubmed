{"title": "The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers under the Outbreak of COVID-19 Brief title: Sleep Disturbances of medical workers in COVID-19", "body": "Findings A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p\uff1c 0.0001), AIS (p\uff1c0.0001), anxiety (p\uff1c0.0001) and depression (p=0.0010), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (p\uff1c0.0001) and AIS > 6 points (p\uff1c0.0001).

More than 75000 cases were confirmed with COVID-19 in China, including 3000 doctors and nurses at least, 5 who have become the high-risk susceptible population to the disease. In addition to the risk of being infected with COVID-19, frontline medical workers (fMW) may have sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression when facing with a magnitude outburst public health incident.\n\nSleep disturbances are defined as the mental or/and physical status that trigger a series of adverse symptoms owing to abnormal amount of sleep or/and poor sleep quality, and remain to be one of the global health concerns. Sleep disturbances have a prevalence ranging from 8.3% to 45%. 6, 7 By comparison to the general population, it was reported that medical workers may have higher prevalence of insomnia. 8 Medical .

The outbreak of COVID-19 in China remains to be a serious challenge for fMW. There is no doubt that they are not only under high risk of being infected with the disease but also high mental stress, which may lead to acute sleep disturbances or mental disorders. However, as far as we know, few studies have concentrated on the sleep disturbances of fMW under the emergent events of public health, especially in the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nTherefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of fMW in the battle against COVID-19, and made a comparison with non-fMW.\n\nThis cross-sectional study included medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China. The Institutional Review Board of Chinese PLA General Hospital approved this study. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was waived due to the cross-sectional nature of this study. All of subjects included in the study were anonymous and volunteered to participate.

It contains eight items with each item rated from 0 to 3 points. The sum of eight items' scores is regarded as total score. A subject with total score > 6 points is diagnosed as insomnia. In general, the higher the AIS, the severer the insomnia. 11 A 10-items VAS measure was used to investigate emotional status of subjects, including work pressure, attention, anxiety, energy, confidence, irritability, stress, impatience, fear, and depression. The VAS was conducted online as a horizontal graphic slider, which was divided into ten segments from one (weakest) to ten (strongest). The VAS scores could represent the degree of their feelings. Higher scores indicate stronger feeling of each emotional state. We used scores of VAS to compare anxiety and depression between fMW and non-fMW.\n\nCategorical variables were described as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were described as the mean \u00b1 SDs. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 for Windows (IBM, Somers, NY). The demographic characteristics were compared by non-parametric test for continuous variables and by Pearson's chi-square test for categorical variables between two groups. The scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety, and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA. The variables with significant differences between two groups in demographic characteristics were described as covariates and joined in the process of ANOVA. In the subgroup analysis of fMW, the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety, and depression VAS were compared by ANOVA between male and female fMW. Partial correlation analysis was conducted to .

In addition, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.3%, and medical workers accounted for 3.8% in COVID-19 patients, as reported by the latest epidemiological study. 13 Previous studies have indicated that in ordinary times, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances, which may be higher than the general population. 7 China demonstrated that civil servants had the shortest sleep duration (Mean 7.85 hours) and the worst sleep quality, who may experience with more work pressure. 14 Meanwhile, 64.1% of police officers had PSQI > 5 points, and were regarded as sleep disturbances as reported. Their sleep disturbances were related to posttraumatic stress and general psychopathology. 17 A survey from Japan indicated that high occupational stress was significantly associated with insomnia, especially the presence of high efforts but low reward. 18 And exposure to long working hours and irregular work shifts may attribute to stress, fatigue, and chronic diseases, 19 which may influence the quantity and quality of sleep. Schiller et al. 16 compared sleep quality and sleep duration between full worktime subjects and 75% reduced worktime subjects, and found the latter presented with improved sleep quality and sleep duration. The reduction of worktime may be useful for alleviating sleep disturbances.\n\nAccompanied with long working hours, frequent day-night shifts, excessive workload, and high stress, medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances or sleep deprivation all over the world. 20 Pikovsky et al. 21 found that 63% and 49% of medical residents presented with low professional performance and judgement levels after the night shifts, respectively. The long working hours could potentially increase the fatigue of medical workers and be linked to the occurrence of medical errors. 22 Meanwhile, sleep deprivation could influence the medical workers in making quick and appropriate decisions for patients, which was fatal to patient care. 23 Deng et al. 24 reported that job difficulty, doctor-patient relationship, psychosomatic state, .

There were 538 (67.2%) and 414 (51.7%) of 801 fMW with PSQI > 7 points and AIS > 6 points, respectively, which were regarded as having sleep\n\ndisturbances. Our study also demonstrated that the fWM group had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than that of non-fWM. In addition, the fWM We further found anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with PSQI and AIS in fMV, which indicated that anxious and depressive symptoms may influence sleep quality of fMW. The result was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that anxiety and depression played a key role in the development of sleep disturbances. 28 This would provide evidence for further targeted interventions to .

However, with the import of supportive fMW from other regions of China, the work duration of fMW may be decreased. By comparison, the non-fMW worked in a relatively mild environment and had less possibility of being infected, thus having less sleep disturbances. Our study also found that scores of PSQI among female fMW were significantly higher than that of male fMW although other scores showed no significant difference, which indicated that female fMW had worse sleep quality than male fMW in emergent events of public health. In a meta-analysis, Zhang et al. 29 calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females had inferior symptom bearing and more bodily vigilance, and the social culture encouraged females to express the indisposition more, 30 which potentially exaggerated the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances. In addition, females tended to report more sleep problems even if having a similar degree of morning awakening compared to males. 29 Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a cross-sectional study. All subjects were volunteered to participate in the survey, so there may be subject selection bias. Second, other occupations who directly expose to COVID-19 patients may experience sleep disturbances potentially, such as police and social workers, but our study merely included the medical workers. Third, our questionnaires did not contain sufficient items, such as the potential risk factors for sleep disturbances of fMW, which can provide more information and be used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Forth, our study lacked of interventions and .
