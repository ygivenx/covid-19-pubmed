{"title": "Preparation of Recombinant Viral Glycoproteins for Novel and Therapeutic Antibody Discovery", "body": "For the vast majority of viral pathogens there is a paucity of drug-based therapies. Rather, it has been the development of vaccines that has been the mainstay of prevention and intervention strategies for combating human and animal viral diseases. There are presently 15 viral vaccines approved for human use, excluding various subtypes, and the majority of these are live-attenuated formulations (reviewed in (1)). In general terms, these liveattenuated viral vaccines are highly effective because they elicit a balanced immune response in the recipient host; stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. However, for many viruses especially those that have associated highly pathogenic characteristics as with Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) restricted agents or retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the use of live attenuated vaccines are not feasible.\n\nA number of studies have demonstrated the importance of neutralizing antibodies in the protection or recovery from viral infections (2, 3) . Indeed, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics. Neutralizing polyclonal antibodies have a long history of being effective against some viruses and more recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is currently the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in neonates and immune-compromised individuals and is more cost-effective and efficacious than the original polyclonal product (4) . Most recently, the anti-RSV palivizumab has been improved, and motavizumab has been shown to potently inhibit viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in a cotton rat model (5) . Virus-neutralizing antibodies can also be administered passively to acutely infected individuals and be highly efficacious. The mechanism of passively administered antibody therapy can be viewed as that of an antiviral drug; suppressing infection and permitting the host to mount an effective immune response (6) . Today, passively administered antibody is routinely used as an effective antiviral therapy or prophylactic for hepatitis B, varicella-zoster, rabies virus, measles virus, and others (reviewed in (2)). In most cases their use is a first-line therapy as a post-exposure measure or in circumstances where vaccination is not possible. However, serum polyclonal antibody preparations have associated problems related to toxicity and potential allergic reactions, as well as lot to lot variation and uncertain dosing regimes (7) .\n\nThe major advances in furthering the development of specific mAbs, has been through the use of bacterial phage display platforms with combinatorial antibody libraries (8, 9) . Further, these phage libraries can be prepared to encode human antibodies as Fabs which contain the light chain and the first two domains of the heavy chain or single-chain variable domain fragments (scFvs) containing the variable domains of the light and heavy chains, and this technology has been complemented by innovative affinity maturation strategies to improve antibody binding (reviewed in (10) ). These techniques in human phage-display antibody platforms have facilitated the rapid identification and isolation of specific human mAbs, eliminating the immunization, hybridoma development, and humanization processes. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective pre-and post-exposure therapeutic modalities. Such antibodies may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process and its underlying mechanisms, the viral neutralization mechanisms and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines and research tools. There have been many recent examples of the development and isolation of hmAbs using phage-display methodologies reactive against important human viral pathogens including HIV-1 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , the paramyxoviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) (17) , and the human SARS coronavirus (18) .\n\nMany of these viral pathogens are also enveloped viruses, and it is almost without exception that all neutralizing antibodies to enveloped viruses are directed against the virus' envelope glycoproteins and traditionally the antibody response has been the immunologic measure of vaccine efficacy (19) . All known viral envelope glycoproteins are homo-or heterooligomers in their mature and functional forms (20) and multimeric proteins, like these, generally interact over large areas which often translate into important structural differences between monomeric subunits and the mature oligomer. This feature can also impart significant differences in antigenic structure which has been shown for a number of proteins such as the trimeric influenza HA glycoprotein (21) and HIV-1 gp120/gp41 (22) . In addition, some viruses pose significant additional challenges such as antigenic variation of their structural proteins that are important neutralization determinants. Perhaps the best characterized example of this particular problem is with primary HIV-1 isolates that exist across the many varied HIV-1 subtypes (23) . In efforts to circumvent this issue, further improvements and enhancements in the techniques of phage-displayed antibody library panning have been developed in order to better select for broadly reactive mAbs or for mAbs reactive to particular subunits of a multi-subunit viral glycoprotein such as sequential antigen panning (SAP) and competitive (CAP) antigen panning methodologies (14, 15) .\n\nIt is often critical that the antigens used for the panning and isolation of hmAbs from phage libraries be produced and/or purified using methods whereby they retain a near native structure and conformation, such as an oligomeric configuration. A useful approach to develop viral membrane glycoproteins suitable for panning phage libraries or as antigens for eliciting antibody responses that recognize their native form is to engineer soluble and secreted versions of the molecules. Often, this approach yields a quaternary structure similar to their native counterparts and for animal viruses, eukaryotic expression systems are typically employed such as recombinant bacculovirus or vaccinia virus, or transient or stable expression in cell culture (22, (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) . This chapter will detail several methods that have been successfully employed to produce, purify and characterize soluble and secreted versions of several viral envelope glycoproteins which have been successfully used as antigens to capture and isolate human phage-displayed monoclonal antibodies. \n\nProtein buffer: PBS, pH 7.0.\n\n1.

Fraction recovery system (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).\n\nThe methods described below outline the steps for recombinant viral glycoprotein production using vaccinia virus for HIV-1 gp140 and HeV and NiV soluble G glycoprotein (sG) and affinity purification of the glycoproteins. In addition, recombinant viral glycoprotein production and affinity purification from stable HeV and NiV soluble F glycoprotein (sF) secreting 293T cell lines will be detailed. Additional purification methods are also detailed, including size exclusion gel filtration and analysis and separation of oligomeric species of the purified viral glycoproteins; sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analysis; and Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis.\n\nThe design and construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding HIV-1 gp140 and HeV and NiV sG as well as the characterization of the recombinant, soluble and secreted viral glycoproteins have been detailed elsewhere (24, 40) . In this section for the purposes of additional illustration there will be an emphasis on the production and purification of soluble and secreted forms of the HeV and NiV F glycoprotein, including the analysis of oligomeric characteristics as well as the generation of stable cell lines secreting recombinant soluble F (sF). \n\nTransfer the cells to a large 250 mL conical bottom tube and centrifuge the cells at 500g for 10 minutes to pellet the cells.\n\nResuspend the cell pellet in EMEM-10 to a volume of 5 times the number of T-150 flasks that were harvested (e.g. cells from 2 T-150 flasks should be resuspended in 10 mL of EMEM-10) (see Note 4).\n\nAdd 200 mL of EMEM-10 and add 5 mL of the cell/media suspension to each roller bottle.\n\nFlow 10% CO 2 , 90% air into each roller bottle with for 30 sec at approximately 150 kPa and tighten the caps of the roller bottles (see Note 5).\n\nIncubate the roller bottles in 37\u00b0C at 0.5 rpm for 5 days or until the cells are completely confluent to form a compact monolayer.\n\na. Thaw and vortex the purified recombinant vaccinia virus to be used for protein expression.\n\nb. The virus inoculum is prepared in 5 mL of OptiMEM for each roller bottle to be infected at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell. A confluent roller bottle is estimated to have approximately 150 \u00d7 10 6 BSC-1 cells or 100 \u00d7 10 6 HeLa-USU cells (7.5 \u00d7 10 8 pfu for BSC-1 cells or 5 \u00d7 10 8 pfu for HeLa-USU cells per roller bottle).\n\nAspirate EMEM-10 and wash each roller bottle with 30 mL of pre-warmed sterile PBS three times. Avoid keeping the cells in PBS and without media for extended time.\n\n3. Add 5 mL of virus inoculum (MOI=5) to each bottle and gently roll to spread the inoculum over the cell monolayer.\n\nImmediately add an additional 15 mL of OptiMEM to each roller bottle and gently roll to spread the inoculum over the cell monolayer.\n\nReturn the roller bottles to the 37\u00b0C incubator and allow the infection to proceed for 3 hours at 0.5 rpm.\n\nFollowing the 3 hour incubation, add an additional 120 mL of OptiMEM and flow each roller bottle with CO 2 as described in 3.1.1.1, step 7.\n\nIncubate the cells in 37\u00b0C incubator at 0.5 rpm for 40 to 50 hours before harvesting the supernatant.\n\n1. Empty the media from each roller bottle into 250 mL conical bottom centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 2000g for 20 min.\n\nCollect the supernatant and add protease inhibitor according to manufacturer's recommendation and Triton\u00ae X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%\n\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.22 \u03bcm PES (low protein-binding) filter unit (see Note 6).\n\nThe supernatant can be stored at 4\u00b0C and ready for affinity purification. We recommend to process the supernatant soonest possible.\n\nis the first step of purification. Depending on the protein's nature or the tag engineered to the protein, different approaches can be carried out for affinity purification. Here, we describe the use of (1) Lentil lectin purification of the highly glycosylated HIV-1 gp140 and (2) S-protein agarose purification for the N-terminally S-peptide tagged HeV/ NiV sG. 6 Pre-wet the filter unit membrane with PBS, 0.1% Triton\u00ae X-100 or the appropriate washing buffer before filtering the supernatant. This can be done by filtering 50 to 100 mL of wash buffer prior to sample filtering. We find that this procedure will decrease protein lost during filtration. This step is essential for purification of sF. \n\nWash the column with 300 mL of wash buffer I follow by 100 mL of wash buffer II to remove triton.\n\nTo elute the protein, apply elution buffer to the column, stop the flow after the first 10 mL of flow through and incubate for 15 min. Collect 25 mL of the elution in a sterile 50 mL tube, stop the flow and incubate for 15 min. Repeat elution and incubation for 3-5 times to collect several 25 mL elutions.\n\nCombine the eluate and concentrate it to less than 2 mL follow by buffer exchange into protein buffer (PBS) using Centriprep\u00ae molecular weight cut off centrifugal filter units.\n\nFilter the purified protein through a 0.2 \u03bcm low protein binding syringe filter membrane and store at 4\u00b0C. Pre-wet the membrane with protein buffer before filtering.\n\nTo regenerate the column, apply 50 mL of high pH buffer follow by 50 mL of low pH buffer through the column. Repeat this step 2 times.\n\nAfter the last low pH wash, apply 200 mL regeneration buffer through the column follow by 200 mL PBS.\n\nFinally, apply 200 mL 20% EtOH through the column and store the beads in 20% EtOH at 4 \u00b0C. The beads can be reused for up to 5 times.\n\n1. Load 15 mL bed volume of S-protein Agarose into a XK 26 column. Always maintain at least 2-3 cm of buffer above the surface of the agarose.\n\nAllow the column inlet adaptor to be 3-5 cm above the buffer level allowing input buffer to enter the column drop wise. Use a peristaltic pump to apply buffer through the inlet tubing. Solution passing through the column outlet depends on gravity.\n\nWash the column with 6 x bed volumes of PBS follow by 6 x bed volumes of wash buffer II (refer to section 2.5.2 for buffers).\n\nApply the prepared supernatant from 3.1.1.3 to the column. Maintain a flow rate of 3 to 4 mL per minute by adjusting the peristaltic pump and a stopcock connected at the outlet tubing of the column.\n\nWash the column with 3X bed volumes of wash buffer I follow by 6x bed volumes of wash buffer II and subsequently 6x bed volumes of PBS.\n\nTo elute the bound protein, stop the pump and allow the PBS to drain until it reaches the surface of the beads. Add 15 mL of elution buffer. Incubate the elution buffer with the beads for 10 min after collecting the first 8 mL of flow through (this should still be the PBS).\n\nCollect 15 mL of the elution into a 50 mL sterile conical centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of neutralization buffer. Check the pH with pH strips and add more neutralization buffer if needed to obtain neutral pH.\n\nRepeat the elution and incubation for 2 to 3 times.\n\nWash the column with 6X bed volume of PBS follow by 6X bed volume of 20% ethanol. Store the beads in ethanol. The beads can be reused for up to 5 times.\n\nCombine all neutralized elution with the first 8 mL flow through from step 5.\n\nConcentrate the elution to less than 2 mL and buffer exchange the elution into protein buffer (PBS) using Centriprep\u00ae molecular weight cut off centrifugal filter units.\n\nFilter the purified protein through a 0.2 \u03bcm low protein binding filter membrane and store at 4\u00b0C. Pre-wet the membrane with the same protein buffer before filtering.\n\nwhile constructing the expression plasmid e.g. Kozak translation initiation sequence and an ATG start codon for proper initiation of translation, promoter/enhancer and termination sequences, the expression plasmid employed, the type of antibiotic selection, the cell line employed, codon optimization of the viral RNA sequence, mutation and modifications on the amino acid sequence to enhance expression and secretion, the tag required in facilitating protein purification, etc. The sF construct described here has been optimized based on all the above concerns. Figure 1 diagrams the construct of our sF GCN.\n\nThe vector employed was a promoter modified pcDNA 3.1 Hygro (+). The enhanced CMV promoter was imported from phCMV 1 vector that allows high expression level of the human and mouse codon optimized sF. The Hygromycin selection marker allows the selection of transfected 293T cell which is resistant to the commonly used Geneticin antibiotic. Replacing the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domain of F is the trimeric GCN4 motif (41, 42) that allows stabilization of the protein trimeric structure (26, 43) and hence enhances the expression and secretion of the protein. This is followed by the 15 amino acid S-peptide that facilitates purification and immuno-detection of the sF by S-protein agarose and anti S-peptide antibody. A factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) is also engineered upstream to the S-peptide tag allowing removal of the tag by enzymatic digestion. Standard cloning procedures were employed to construct the plasmid.\n\nBefore generating a stable cell line, several optimizations may be required to obtain the best expression level. This can be investigated in transient expression using various cell lines to obtain the best result. We describe here the transient transfection of the sF construct in 293T cells using lipid-based transfection procedure. The expression level can be analyzed using immuno or affinity precipitations from the cell lysate and supernatant follow by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to access the secretion level. Figure 2 shows a representative result of transient transfection of various sF construct to assess the secretion level by western blotting. The addition of GCN tail and codon optimization by Geneart, Inc. greatly enhanced expression and secretion of the sF.\n\nA day prior to transfection, Seed 0.4 \u00d7 10 6 / well in 3 mL DMEM-10 of 293T cell onto a 6-well tissue culture plate pre-coated with 0.1% Gelatin (see Note 7) . Allow the cells to adhere and grow in 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 overnight.\n\nCells should be 70-90% confluent the next day. Prepare transfection mixture as follow: Add 6\u03bcl of Fugene transfection reagent to 0.5 mL of serum-free DMEM.\n\nGently mix the solution. Add 2 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA to the mixture and vortex briefly. Incubate the transfection mixture at room temperature for 30 min.\n\nTransfect one well with the vector DNA without the gene of interest as negative control.\n\nAspirate the medium from the 6-well plate and replace with 0.5 mL of fresh DMEM-10/well. Add the transfection mixture to the cell at the side of the well without disturbing the monolayer. Gently rock the plate to mix.\n\nIncubate the cells at 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 for overnight or at least 3 hours before adding an additional 0.5 mL of DMEM-10.\n\nContinue to incubate the cells at 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 for 36 to 48 hrs to allow protein expression and secretion to take place.\n\nfor immuno or affinity precipitations to assess the secretion level.\n\n1. Collect the supernatant from the 6-well plate into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 18,000g for 1 min to pellet cells.\n\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and add 30 \u03bcL of 50% slurry S-agarose. Rotate at room temperature for 1 hr.\n\n3. Add 1 tablet of complete mini protease inhibitor to 10 mL of lysis buffer. Add 0.7 mL of this lysis buffer / well to the cells remaining on the plate. Allow lysis on ice for 5-10 min.\n\nTransfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and rotate at 4\u00b0C for 5-10 min to allow complete lysis.\n\nCentrifuge the lysate at 18,000g for at least 5 min to pellet cell debris.\n\nTransfer the cleared lysate to a fresh tube and add 30 \u03bcL of 50% slurry S-agarose beads. Rotate at room temperature for 1 hr.\n\nAfter the affinity binding, centrifuge the samples at 3,000g for 1 min to pellet the agarose beads. Aspirate the unbound lysate or supernatant without disturbing the agarose beads.\n\nWash the agarose beads by adding 1 mL of lysis buffer and mix by inverting the tube several times.\n\nRepeat steps 7 and 8 for at least twice.\n\nAfter aspirating the lysis buffer at the last washing step, add 50 \u03bcL of 2x SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer with 50 \u03bcL of 2-Mercaptoethanol per 1 mL of sample buffer to the agarose.\n\nVortex and boil the samples for 5 min. Centrifuge the samples at 3,000g for 1 min. Use 25 \u03bcL for standard SDS-PAGE follow by Western blotting procedures.\n\nFor immuno-detection, use 1/20,000 dilution of HRP conjugated Rabbit anti-S-tag antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour. We use the Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate as the HRP substrate. See Figure 2 for Western blot result.\n\nwith the best cell line, a stable cell line can be generated. In order to select a stable cell clone expressing the soluble glycoprotein, the minimum concentration of the appropriate selection antibiotic required to kill the non transfected host cell line needs to be determined. Because natural resistance varies among cell lines, we recommend testing a range of antibiotic concentrations on 25% confluent cells. Choose the concentration that prevents growth within 2-3 days and kills all cells within 5-7 days. The procedures described here have been optimized for 293T cells. \n\nTo the cells remaining on the plate for cell line generation, add 2 mL of PBS to wash the cells without disturbing the monolayer.\n\nRemove the PBS and add 0.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA, allow trypsinization for 3-5 sec before aspirating the trypsin.\n\nUse 1 mL fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 25 cm 2 tissue culture flask.\n\n6. Add 4 mL of DMEM-10 to the flask and allow cells to adhere at 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 for several hours or overnight.\n\nOnce cells have adhered, replace the medium with fresh DMEM-10 supplemented with 150 \u03bcg/mL Hygromycin B.\n\nPrepare another flask with the same selection medium for non transfected cells to monitor the action of the antibiotic.\n\nChange and replace the selection medium when necessary by observing the color change of the medium. Changing the medium will also remove dead cells.\n\nNon expressing cells should die within several days and expressing colonies will start to form. For 293T cells, this may take 7 to 10 days depending on the transfection efficiency. When all dead cells have been removed and colonies are growing well, the cells should be transferred into a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask to form monolayer.\n\nAspirate medium from the 25 cm 2 flask and add 2 mL of PBS. Gently rock the flask before aspirating the PBS.\n\nThen, add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA and leave for 5 sec. Aspirate the trypsin and use 2 mL of fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask.\n\n13. Add 18 mL of DMEM-10 supplemented with 150 \u03bcg/mL Hygromycin B to the flask. Allow the cells to grow and form monolayer in 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 .\n\n14. Once cells have reached confluence, split them at 1 in 5 dilution in selection medium. Repeat this for another 2 passages. Keep 1 mL of supernatant for affinity precipitation to monitor the secretion level.\n\nWhen cells reach confluence at the third passage, proceed to section 3.3.3.2.\n\n1. Aspirate the medium from the 75 cm 2 flask and add 8 mL PBS. Gently rock the flask before aspirating the PBS.\n\nThen, add 4 mL of trypsin-EDTA and leave for 5 sec. Aspirate the trypsin and use 10 mL of fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\n\nPellet the cells at 800g for 10 min and resuspend the pellet in 20 mL DMEM-10.\n\nCount the cells using trypan blue to exclude dead cells. Dilute 30 \u03bcL of the cell suspension to 8 cells/mL in 20 mL DMEM-10 medium. Freeze the remaining cells in liquid Nitrogen.\n\nPrepare two 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. Fill 200 \u03bcL/ well of PBS to the outer 36 wells and 100 \u03bcL/ well of DMEM-10 supplemented with 300 \u03bcg/mL Hygromycin B to the inner 60 wells.\n\nAdd 100 \u03bcL / well of the diluted cells from step 4 to the 100 \u03bcL selection medium in the inner 60 wells of the prepared 96-well plates from step 5. Each well now should have less than one cell.\n\nAllow colonies to form in 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 for 10 to 14 days. Observe each well under microscope to identify single colony wells after 10 days.\n\nWhen the color of the medium starts to change, transfer all single colonies individually by pipetting up and down into 24-well plates with 1 mL selection medium added to the each well.\n\nAllow monolayer to form in 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 for 4 to 6 days. When cells reach 70-90% confluence, take 0.9 mL of supernatant from each well for immunoprecipitation and western blotting (section 3.2.2.2) to assess for the strongest secreting clone. Replace the selection medium in the 24-well plate. Once the best clone has been determined, it can then be expanded into larger tissue culture flask.\n\nAspirate the medium from the well of the selected clone, add 1 mL PBS. Add 0.3 mL trypsin-EDTA after removing the PBS and allow trypsinization for 3 sec. Remove trypsin and resuspend cells in 1 mL DMEM-10.\n\nTransfer the resuspended cells into a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask added with 19 mL of selection medium. Allow the cells to grow to confluence in 37\u00b0C, 5-8% CO 2 this may take up to one week.\n\nRepeat the cloning (steps 1 to 11) at least once to ensure stable expression and to obtain the best possible secreting clone.\n\nOnce a desirable clone has been obtained, expand the cell to larger flasks for freezing to keep as stock. Proceed to section 3.2.4 for protein expression.\n\nCell culture for expression-Once a stable cell line has been established, it can then be grown into roller bottles for larger scale protein production. The following protocol describes the large scale production of secreted sF from 293T cells in roller bottles. For protein expression, addition of selection antibiotic is not necessary. Because of the weak adherent nature of 293 derivative cells, gelatin treatment of the roller bottle surface is necessary to avoid the formation of cell clumps which will decrease the protein secretion level.\n\nAdd 50 mL of 0.1% sterile gelatin solution into each 1700 cm 2 roller bottle. Rotate at 1 rpm at 37\u00b0C for overnight or at least 1 hour.\n\nRemove gelatin solution and wash once with 50 mL sterile PBS and once with DMEM medium.\n\nPrepare 150 cm 2 flasks of sF 293T cell. One confluent flask of cells should be transferred into one 1700 cm 2 roller bottle.\n\nProceed to steps 2 to 8 in section 3.1.1.1.\n\nWhen the cells have reached near confluence in the roller bottles, collect the DMEM-10 medium. Depending on the expression level, protein can be harvested from the serum medium (see Note 8).\n\nWash the cells with 50 mL PBS gently without disturbing the monolayer and remove the PBS.\n\nAdd 120 mL of OptiMEM and pump with CO 2 to each roller bottle as described in 3.1.1.1, step 7.\n\nAllow protein secretion for 4-5 days or until the cell starts to detach. Harvest the supernatant as described in section 3.1.1.3.\n\nreplacing all buffers to the list in section 2.5.3 and omitting the PBS wash in step 5. The protein concentration and yield can then be estimated. We use the Bradford method (44) to estimate the protein concentration at 595 nm OD. At this point, a small portion of the purified protein can be analyzed on SDS-PAGE follow by coomassie staining (Figure 3 ). Proceed to section 3.3 for molecular weight purification. 8 Harvest the DMEM medium and follow procedures in section 3.1.1.3. Use this medium for S-column purification as described in section 3.2.5. There will still be contaminating serum protein at this stage. Apply the neutralized elution to another round of S-column purification in smaller scale. Scale down all buffers for 2 mL bed volume of S-Agarose. Use 10 mL Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc). The flow rate is entirely depending on gravity. Depending on the expected protein yield, several columns may be required. It is estimated that 1 mL bed volume of S-Agarose is able to capture at least 1 mg sF. We use 3 columns for sF GCN and more than 6 mg can be recovered from supernatant of 10 roller bottles.\n\nFollowing S-affinity purification, the concentrated purified protein can be analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining to assess the purity and yield. In most cases, there will be presence of small amount of contaminating proteins especially when purification was done from serum medium. Hence, further purification is needed.\n\nGel filtration chromatography separates molecules on the basis of size. It is often reserved for the final step of purification to achieved higher purity. This method can also be used to estimate the molecular masses of globular proteins in their native condition base on their migration through a chromatographic matrix packed in a column. Pre-packed columns with various matrix of different fractionation range are available commercially from GE healthcare.\n\nThe approximate molecular mass of a certain protein can be estimated from a calibrated curve obtained from a series of standards protein with known molecular masses. Standard calibration protein kits can be obtained commercially from e.g. GE healthcare, Sigma, etc with well described calibrating protocols. Once the molecular weight of the different oligomeric species has been determined, a preparative chromatography can be carried out to isolate the desired oligomeric species.\n\nHere, we describe the use of a calibrated Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column to estimate the approximate molecular mass of the different oligomeric species of the soluble viral glycoprotein using example of HeV and NiV sF GCN. We also describe the use of HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column XK 16 to separate the different oligomeric species of affinity purified sF.\n\nChromatography-Before analyzing the soluble viral glycoprotein, calibrate the column with a series of protein standards. The Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column employed here has been calibrated with the Molecular weights (29 KDa -669 KDa) calibration kit. As depicted in Figure 4 , the calibration curve generated was used to estimate the approximate size of the HeV sF GCN. Well described calibrating protocols are included in commercially available gel filtration molecular weights calibration kit. Below is a simple procedure used to determine the approximate size of the sF.\n\nThe inlet tubing of the column should be connected to the appropriate buffer through the P-500 pump. Set the back pressure limit to 1.5 MPa.\n\nConnect the column outlet tubing to the optical unit through a flow cell of the UV detector.\n\nWash the column with at least 3x column volume (3x 24 mL) with sterile deionized water with a flow rate of 24 mL/ hour.\n\nEquilibrate the column with the appropriate protein buffer from section 2.5 with at least 3x of the column volume with the same flow rate.\n\nSet the sensitivity to 1.0 ABS for 3-5 mg of sF, sG, and gp140 and 0.2 ABS for 70 \u03bcL of the recommended concentration of the protein standards. Do not exceed 5 mg of protein and 500 \u03bcL of sample volume. Apply each protein standards as a separate run.\n\nSet the base line for the UV detector and set the chart speed to 30 cm/hour. Proceed to next step for sample application once a stable base line is observed.\n\nStop the pump and disconnect the column's inlet tubing from the pump. Apply affinity purified protein or protein standard to the column by using a 1mL syringe and reconnect the input tubing to the pump. Use the same sample volume for all protein standards and the unknown sample.\n\nStart the flow and set the chart speed to 30 cm/hour. Use a flow rate of 24 mL/ hour.\n\nStart fraction collector after the first 3 mL has been eluted. Collect fractions at 60 sec intervals for at least 40 fractions.\n\nStop collection when the last peak has been observed.\n\nWash the column with at least 2x column volume of sterile deionized water followed by 3x column volume of 20% Ethanol. Store column in 20% ethanol.\n\nObtain the elution volume (V e ) by measuring the volume of the eluent from the point of sample application to the center of the elution peak. Determine the void volume (V o ), which is the V e of blue dextran (2 mg/mL).\n\nCalculate the K av values for each protein by using the formula K av = (V e -V o )/ (V c -V o ), where V c is the total column volume.\n\n14. Generate a calibration curve by plotting the calculated K av for each protein standard against the log of the known molecular weight.\n\nCalculate the estimated molecular weight of the soluble viral glycoprotein from the calibrated curve.\n\n16. Take 2 to10 \u03bcl from each fraction of all peaks from the soluble glycoprotein for native gel analysis (section 3.5) to observe the oligomeric species. Figure 5 shows a representative result of the elution profile HeV sF GCN and the coomassie blue and western blot of a native gel analysis of the fractions.\n\nRepeat steps 1 to 11 of section 3.3.1 using the of HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column. The back pressure limit should be set to 0.3 MPa. The column flow rate should be 60 mL/ hour. Set the sensitivity to1.0 ABS for 8-10 mg of sF, sG, and gp140. Use 3 mL syringe for larger sample volume. The column volume is approximately 120 mL. The chart speed can be set to 15 cm/hour.\n\nProceed to step 16 of section 3.3.1. Figure 6 shows a representative result of the elution profile HeV sF GCN and the coomassie blue of a native gel analysis of selected peaks.\n\nPool the selected peak fractions and concentrate it to 1 mL using Centriprep\u00ae molecular weight cut off centrifugal filter units.\n\nObserve 2 to 10 \u03bcg the purified protein again on a native gel. Figure 6C shows the purified HeV sF GCN trimer on a native gel.\n\nNative oligomeric forms of the purified soluble glycoprotein can also be analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Figure 6 , two species (large aggregate and trimer) of HeV sF GCN were observed in the sucrose gradient. This is consistent with the gel filtration profile as shown in Figure 4 .\n\n1. Underlie 6 mL of 5% sucrose with 6 mL of 20% sucrose in polyallomer 14-by 95mm tubes 2. Generate a linear sucrose gradient with a gradient master at an angle of 81.5\u00b0 for 1 min 55 seconds at a speed of 15 rpm.\n\nOverlay 200 \u03bcg of soluble viral glycoprotein on top of the gradients.\n\nCentrifuge at 40,000 rpm (approximately 284,000 g) for 20 h at 4\u00b0C using an SW40 rotor.\n\nFractions of approximately 800 \u03bcL from the bottom of the gradient using a Beckman fraction recovery system and automated fraction collector.\n\n6. Take 15 \u03bcL from each fraction for native gel analysis to observe the oligomeric species. Figure 7 shows the western blot of a native gel analysis of the fractions from 200 \u03bcg HeV sF GCN.\n\nNative gel analysis allows the visualization of the soluble glycoprotein on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in its native form. This allows the estimation of the size of the native oligomeric species. It is most helpful in analyzing the fractions separated from gel filtration and sucrose gradient.\n\nThe Blue native (BN) gel system is based on the originally described system by Schagger and von Jagow (45) . Many modifications have been made based on the original method for example in observing the native forms of HIV-1 Env (30, 46, 47) . We find that the commercially available BN-PAGE system from Invitrogen Corp. is most suitable for our soluble glycoprotein analysis. It requires little or no optimization and is included with well described step by step protocol. In this BN-PAGE system, the Coomassie \u00ae G-250 binds to proteins and confers a negative charge while maintaining the proteins in their Native state.\n\nBelow are the procedures we use to analyze our soluble glycoproteins using the BN-PAGE system followed by western blotting. \n\nFor 20 \u03bcL, add 5 \u03bcL of 4X NativePAGE\u2122 Sample Buffer and 0.5 \u03bcL of NativePAGE\u2122 5% G-250 to 14.5 \u03bcL of protein sample.\n\nSet up the electrophoresis system using the NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae 3-12% Bis-Tris Gels 1.0 mm, 15 well and the XCell SureLock\u2122 Mini-Cell as described by the manufacturer.\n\nRinse the wells with 1X running buffer and load the samples before adding the Cathode buffer.\n\nLoad 5 \u03bcL of NativeMark\u2122 Unstained Protein Standard for coomassie stain and 7 \u03bcL added with 1 \u03bcL of 5% G-250 for western blotting.\n\nPerform the electrophoresis at 150 V for 2 hrs at room temperature. Transient expression of various sF constructs. 293 T cells were transfected with various sF constructs in the promoter modified pcDNA 3.1 Hygro (+) vector. Cell lysate and supernatant were precipitated with S-protein agarose. Western blot detection was performed using HRP conjugated rabbit anti S-peptide antibody. WT: wild type sequence; CO: codon optimized sequence; Lys: lysate; Sup: supernatant. Size exclusion chromatography analysis of HeV sF GCN. A panel of high-molecular-weight standards was separated on a Superdex 200 size 10/300 GL exclusion column, and a calibration curve was generated. Samples of S-affinity purified HeV sF GCN were separated on the calibrated Superdex 200 column and fractionated. The Kav values of the major peaks were calculated, and the apparent molecular weight estimates were determined using the calibration curve. Sucrose gradient analysis of oligomeric forms of HeV sF GCN. 200 \u03bcg of S-affinity purified protein was layered onto continuous (5-to-20%) sucrose gradients and fractioned. 15 \u03bcL of each fraction was analyzed on BN-PAGE followed by western blotting. The bands were detected using rabbit anti S peptide HRP conjugated antibody. The bottom and top of the gradient fractions are indicated."}
