{"title": "Double-Quencher Probes Improved the Detection Sensitivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by One-Step RT-PCR", "body": "In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province [1] . The novel human-infecting coronavirus was tentatively named 2019 novel coronavirus These data showed how SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred worldwide in genetic variations.\n\nHuman transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health concern. The molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is highly prioritized to establish the prevention of the viral outbreak and treatment of infected patients. Therefore, demands in detecting the virus in suspected patients in hospitals and clinical laboratories are growing. The Japanese government announced the approval of real-time PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 for health insurance on March 6, 2020. Here, we compared the detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets designed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of America. These probes were designed as single-quencher probes. We originally designed the double-quencher probes consisting of the same nucleotide sequencing imposed by the NIID. The results showed that double-quenching probes reduced the background signal and improved the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe CDC has designed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and published a protocol for the detection of the 2019- (Table 1) .\n\nThe NIID has designed RT-PCR assays and published the data [14] . The primer and probe sets were sent from the NIID (hereafter called NIID assay). The CDC assay includes three sets of primers and 5' FAM dye and 3' TAMRA probes as shown in Table 1 .\n\nWe also originally designed double-quencher probes (IDT) containing the same sequence in accordance with the NIID protocol (hereafter called YCH assay). This probe has 5' FAM dye, internal ZEN Quencher, and 3' Iowa Black\u00ae Fluorescent Quencher (IBFQ) ( Table 1) . Internal ZEN Quencher is incorporated between the ninth and tenth bases from the 5' end of probe. This design decreased the distance between the dye and quencher and expected to reduce the background signal and achieve a higher dynamic signal. All primer/probe sets of CDC, NIID, and YCH assays amplified the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1 ). CDC assay targets three sites of N gene, while both NIID and YCH target the two sites ( Figure 1 ).\n\nFor the DNA positive control, we purchased 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (IDT, catalog #10006625), which is composed of plasmids containing the complete N gene (1,260 base pairs) of SARS-CoV-2. We prepared a serial dilution DNA control using nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific .

We also purchased Hs_RPP30 Positive Control (IDT, catalog #10006626), which contains a portion of the ribonuclease P 30 subunit (RPP30) gene of the human genome. RPP30 genes were analyzed for internal positive control.\n\nTo detect SARS-CoV-2, we performed RT-PCR with the use of probes and primers. In CDC and YCH assays, the reaction mixture was made up of 5 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7 TaqMan \n\nDesign of primer and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 has a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome with 29,903 base pairs in length (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2). All CDC, NIID, and YCH assays amplified the N gene of the SARS-CoV-2, as shown in Figure 1 . CDC assays target three sites (N1, N2, and N3), and NIID and YCH .

Previous study showed the mismatch of reverse primer in the N1 of the NIID assay with the sequence in the current database because it was constructed based on another reported sequence (GenBank: MN908947.1) [14] . In addition, this mismatch in the reverse primers had no influence on the detection sensitivity compared to the perfectmatched reverse primer stated in the previous report [14] . CDC and NIID assays contain single-quencher probes in each assay; however, we originally generated the double-quencher technology in YCH assays to reduce background signal.\n\nExpected amplicon sizes of CDC assays are 72 bp, 67 bp, and 72 bp in length by the N1, N2, and N3, respectively. Expected amplicon sizes of NIID and YCH assays are 128 bp and 158 bp in length by N1 and N2, respectively.\n\nTo assess the detection sensitivity of each assay, we conducted RT-PCR analysis using a serial-diluted DNA control. We input the DNA positive control at concentrations of 10,000 copies, 1,000 copies, 100 copies, 10 copies, and 1 copy.\n\nWe set the threshold value to 0.2 in all assays to determine the threshold cycle (Ct). Fluorescence amplification signals were detected using 10,000 copies, 1000 copies, and 100 copies of DNA positive control by all CDC, NIID, and YCH assays ( Figure 2 ). With the use of 10 copies of DNA positive control, amplification signals by CDC-N2, YCH-N1, YCH-N2, and NIID-N2 were detected ( Figure 2 ). All of these assays could not detect using 1 copy of DNA positive control ( Figure 2 ).\n\nOverall, the Ct value is found to be lower in the YCH assay using the serial-diluted DNA positive control.\n\nAs observed, the Ct values in both the N1 and N2 sites of the NIID assay were relatively higher compared to those of the YCH assay (Figure 2 ), although the primer and probe sequence was the same between NIID and YCH assays.\n\nWe concluded that the double-quencher probe (ZEN/IBFQ) reduced the background signal and lowered the Ct value compared to the single-quencher probe (TAMRA). To this end, we analyzed the fluorescent signals during the cycles of RT-PCR at three independent experiments. As expected, the doublequencher probes decreased the background FAM fluorescent signals at the baseline ( Figure 3 ). The baseline fluorescent signal of the N1 site of NIID ranged from 150\u00d710 4 to 200\u00d710 4 . However that of YCH was around or less than 50\u00d710 4 .

Similarly, the signal in the N2 site of NIID was around 125\u00d710 4 to 200\u00d710 4 , and that of YCH was 75\u00d710 4 to 100\u00d710 4 . Results suggested that double-quencher probes improved the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 using one-step real-time RT-PCR owing to the reduction of background signal. They showed that ORF1ab is best according to China. In the N gene, CDC-N2 (USA), CDC-N3 (USA), and NIID-N2 (Japan) sets should be selected for sensitive and reliable laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. We have also observed that the CDC-N2 (USA) and NIID-N2 (Japan) assay could detect low number of DNA positive control.\n\nWe confirmed that the N1 site of NIID assay was not detected when using less than 10 copies of DNA positive control. In addition, as observed, Ct value was also high by the N1 site of the NIID assay. Similar to these observations, Shirato et al. also demonstrated less sensitivity of the N1 site of NIID assay using RNA positive control. The assessment of N1 site was originally reported by the groups in Germany. To improve the detection sensitivity, we recommended the use of a double-quencher probe for detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the N1 site.\n\nThe background fluorescent signal was mainly determined by two factors.\n\nFirst, high background fluorescence is due to longer probe sequence in length.\n\nThis means the shorter the distance between the fluorescence dye and the quencher, the better the quenching performance due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Second, the background signal is prone to be low if the probe forms three-dimensional structure owing to self-quenching. To detect the low number of virus in human sample, the reduction of background signal is important. To this end, we utilized a double-quencher system for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by a one-step real-time RT-PCR. As expected, a double-quencher probe decreased the background signal at the baseline which led to a higher dynamic range. Our data suggested that double-quencher probe enables us to detect low number of SARS-CoV-2 in routine clinical practice. .
