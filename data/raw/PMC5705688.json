{"title": "Human parainfluenza virus infection in severe acute respiratory infection cases in Beijing, 2014\u20102016: A molecular epidemiological study", "body": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are enveloped, single\u2010stranded negative sense RNA viruses that belong to the family Paramyxoviridae. Based on genetic and antigenic variation, HPIVs have been divided into four types: HPIV\u20101 to HPIV\u20104.1 As one of the most common pathogens associated with respiratory tract infections, most children encounter HPIV\u20103 within the first 2 years after birth and encounter HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20102 under the age of 5 years old, presenting as upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) or lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI).2 For adults, recent studies showed that HPIVs were associated with respiratory tract illness, refractory airway disease, and virus\u2010induced asthma.3, 4 These findings point the disease bundle of HPIVs and highlight the need for continuous surveillance of the whole population.\n\nHowever, our knowledge on HPIVs mainly focused on their infection in children with acute respiratory infections (ARI).5, 6 Compared with ARIs, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases present a wider distribution and more diverse clinical presentations. Unfortunately, the study on HPIV infection in these cases is very limited. Moreover, virological characteristics of HPIVs in recent years are not fully understood. In our previous study, a SARI surveillance system was built to find influenza infection in these cases. While in this study, a larger number of 1229 SARI cases were enrolled from this surveillance system, screened for HPIVs, and investigated the epidemiological characteristics of infection. Phylogenetic analysis was further performed using the hemagglutinin\u2010neuraminidase (HN) sequence published previously to reveal the evolution of HPIVs in Beijing area.\n\nEthical approval for retrospective study was obtained from the institutional review board and human research ethics committee of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Informed consents were obtained from each participant.\n\nThis study was conducted in 11 inpatient departments in local hospitals located in urban and suburban districts of Beijing area from September 2014 to August 2016. The enrollment criteria for SARI cases included: (i) inpatients with a temperature >38\u00b0C and cough; (ii) onset of clinical symptoms within 10 days.7 Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, or sputum was collected from the enrolled cases. Specimens were stored in 3 mL of virus transport medium at 4\u00b0C and tested within 24 hours. Meanwhile, information questionnaires, including the demographic information and vaccine inoculation, were completed by participating physicians at the same time.\n\nViral RNA was extracted from all specimens using QIAmp Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instruction. Then, multiplex real\u2010time PCR kit (Uninovo, Zhenjiang, China) was used to identify HPIVs and other common respiratory viruses (influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, etc.).\n\nEighteen HPIV\u20103\u2010positive specimens were randomly selected and sequenced. Reverse transcription and amplification of HN gene were carried out using the One\u2010Step RT\u2010PCR Kit (Qiagen) with primers described previously.8 PCR products were selected and purified using EZNA Gel Extraction Kit (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA) and then sequenced by ABI Prism 3130xl automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) (Supporting information 3).\n\nIn total, 114 representative HN sequences were downloaded from GenBank and used as global background in this study. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the HN genes were assembled and aligned using mega software (ver. 6.0.4).9 Neighbor\u2010joining (NJ) phylogeny tree and maximum\u2010likelihood tree were inferred using mega with Kimura 2\u2010parameters substitution model and 1000 bootstraps. The nucleotide sequences of the viruses included in this study have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers: KY355144\u2010KY355161, Supporting information 3).\n\nData were analyzed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using spss 20.0 (IBM, New York, NY, USA). Difference between groups was evaluated using Pearson's chi\u2010square or Fisher's exact test, and P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nA total of 10 595 SARI cases were reported by 11 sentinel hospitals from September 2014 to August 2016. Among all the reported cases, 1229 (11.60%) SARI cases were randomly surveyed, sampled, and tested. Eighty\u2010one HPIV RNA\u2010positive cases were identified in this study, including 10 HPIV\u20101, 9 HPIV\u20102, 55 HPIV\u20103, and 7 HPIV\u20104 cases, with a yield rate of 0.81%, 0.73%, 4.48%, and 0.57%, respectively. No regional or temporal clustering of HPIV infection was found. Among all 81 HPIV RNA\u2010positive cases, 18 cases were found to be coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Coinfection with HPIV\u20103 and rhinovirus was the most common pattern (Supporting information 1).\n\nAll types of HPIVs were detected every year, except for HPIV\u20102 in September to December 2014. Detailed analysis showed that the yield rate of HPIV varied during the year, from the lowest of 0% in February 2016 to the highest of 21.43% in August 2015. As the most common type of HPIVs, HPIV\u20103, most of the infection occurred in June to September (66.07%, Figure 1). Moreover, age\u2010specific infection was proved. Children under 5 years old showed the highest yield rate of HPIV infection (9.07%), and followed by the patients over 60 years old (6.02%). No significant difference was found between HPIV\u2010positive SARI cases and all SARI cases by gender and hospital stays (P = .728 and P = .774, respectively). However, HPIV\u2010positive SARI cases have a better outcome when compared with other SARI cases (0.24% vs. 4.56% for ICU treatment and 0 vs. 1.55% for death, Table 1).\n\nA total of 18 full sequences of HN gene (1719 nt)\u2010derived HPIV\u20103 virus in SARI cases were analyzed in this study, including 3 sequences in 2014, 10 sequences in 2015, and 5 sequences in 2016. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid homologies among these viruses were between 98.84%\u2010100% and 99.65%\u2010100%, respectively, which suggested high genetic conservation of HPIV\u20103 in Beijing area. No significant difference between viruses derived from patients with different age or seasonality was observed. Compared to the prototype strain Wash/47885/57, 15 amino acid substitutions (M21T, I40T, I53T, H62R, I76V, M82V, M118I, L138P, K168R, V191I, I391V, V348A, I522R, R524K, and S527P) were found in the tested HPIV\u20103 viruses. Among them, K168R and V191I were first identified in Asia.\n\nWe further analyzed the sequences of HN gene of tested viruses and circulating strains worldwide and then evaluated the phylogenetic relationship among them. All the viruses belonged to Cluster C3a, which was the major circulating cluster in Asia. However, the viruses can be further distinguished into two C3a\u2010related group, BJ/05114/2015\u2010like viruses and BJ/02073/2015\u2010like viruses, with at least 0.004 nucleotide divergence between them. Moreover, these two group viruses co\u2010circulated in Beijing area before the middle of 2015. Then a genetic shift occurred, leading to a dominate role of BJ/02073/2015\u2010like viruses. No BJ/05114/2015\u2010like viruses were identified in 2016 (Figure 2, Supporting information 2).\n\nIn the present study, 1229 SARI patients were enrolled, and the HPIVs in these cases were first investigated. Previous studies were usually performed in ARI cases, especially in outpatients.10, 11 Noteworthily, compared with the definition of ARI (presence of constitutional signs or symptom of respiratory tract infection, ie, cough and fast breathing), the criteria of SARI puts more focus on the hospitalized severe cases. As expected, infants and young child <5 years old showed the highest infection rate of HPIVs in all SARI cases, which concur with the studies carried out in ARIs. However, the high yield rate of HPIVs in elder population was observed: 6.02% (25/415) of SARI cases over 60 years old were HPIV\u2010positive, which was higher than that in mild ARI cases.11 Although the HPIV infection usually presents as mild and self\u2010limiting illness, and no ICU\u2010treated cases and death were reported in this study, elder patients still bear a high risk in HPIV infection, due to their complex underlying diseases and relatively low immune response. Moreover, we found that most HIPV infection occurred in June to September (58.54%), which showed a relatively delayed epidemiological peak compared with the study in early years in the same area (March\u2010August).8\n\n\nAn important finding of this study was the genetic characteristic of current circulating HPIV\u20103 viruses. Two major surface glycoproteins, the HN and the fusion (F) proteins, are essential for virus assembly.1 In particular, HN glycoprotein regulates the interaction between virus and host cells and possesses the largest antigenicity in host immunity against HPIV infection(12). Several antigenic epitopes of the HN glycoprotein have been previously characterized.12, 13 Three amino acid substitutions in antigenic epitopes were found in this study, including K168R (16.67%), H295Y (100%), and I391V (100%). In particular, the K168R mutation locates very close to amino acids of significant importance to the integrity of distinct HN epitopes (residues 171),14 and it has not been identified in Asia before. Although these variants become non\u2010dominant since the middle of 2015, the potential antigenic drift due to the substitutions should be further evaluated.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis showed that HPIV\u20103 Cluster C remained as the most dynamic and widespread group worldwide, which concur with previous studies.6, 15 However, the viruses tested in this study were composed by two subgroups, BJ/05114/2015\u2010like viruses and BJ/02073/2015\u2010like viruses. The former possesses some genetic characteristic derived from European strains, such as K168R, while the latter was much more like the strains circulated in China and Japan. These results suggested the complex evolution of HPIV\u20103 both related temporally and geographically.\n\nIn conclusion, the common infection of HPIVs in SARI cases is reported in this study. The HPIVs in young children, as well as the elders older than 60 years, should be paid more attention. The phylogenetic information of the most common HPIVs, HPIV\u20103, was also shown here. The continual evolution and genetic diversity of HPIV\u20103 highlight the needs for more long\u2010term investigation both in China and around the world in the future."}
