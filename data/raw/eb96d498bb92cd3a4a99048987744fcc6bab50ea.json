{"title": "Virus persistence and recurring demyelination produced by a temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV-4", "body": "However, experiments to explore the role of virus and host factors in the production of chronic or recurrent demyelinating disease have been limited because MHV -4 usually produces demyelination in conditions that frequently induce a fatal necrotizing encephalomyelitis 1 -9\n\n, To circumvent this problem, we had made and selected mutant viruses that caused both a high incidence of demyelination and a low incidence of encephalitis-induced mortality'. One such mutant, designated ts8, consistently caused acute demyelinating disease in over 90% of intracerebrally or intranasally (natural route of infection) inoculated, 4-5 weekold mice from several susceptible strains within 6-10 days 9 \n\nBALB/c mice, 4-5 weeks old, were inoculated intracerebrally with 10 4 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ts8. Tissue homogenates from one group of mice were prepared for virus titration as 10% w /v suspensions 12 \u2022 An identically treated group was killed at various time points by intracardiac perfusion with a paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixative 11 \u2022 CNS tissue was embedded in Epon, and sections were stained with uranyl acetate and viewed with a Zeiss EMl0 electron microscope 11 \u2022 Figure 1 shows the amounts of virus found in brains of animals (five each) at 2, 4, 7, 10, 28, 60 and 365 days after inoculation. Although virus titres had declined by the seventh day after inoculation, brains from three of five mice studied at 365 days after inoculation still yielded infectious virus. Corresponding results were recorded for spinal cord tissues. All animals (25 mice) examined histopathologically 7 days after infectiop and later, had some degree of demyelination. Virus isolated from animals killed 1 yr after inoculation retained the temperaturesensitive growth characteristics of the initial inoculum. For example, assay of one such sample yielded 1 x 10 4 PFU per g brain at 34 \u00b0C, 6 x 10 3 PFU per g at 3 7 \u00b0C and < 10 PFU per g brain at 39.5 \u00b0C. This sample is representative of all three isolates.\n\nThe maximal degree of acute demyelination usually corresponded directly to the amounts of infectious virus carried and was associated with infiltrating inflammatory cells. Remyelination, characterized by thin myelin sheaths around large axonal profiles, was evident at 28 days post-infection (Fig. 2a ) . Thereafter, recurrent demyelination in areas that had undergone remyelination was found at 57 days (Fig. 2b) and later. The chronic demyelinating lesion was not usually associated with perivascular cellular infiltrates, although acute demyelination was associated with infiltrating inflammatory cells. Recurrent demyelination, usually occurring in small foci, was evident at 365 days (Fig. 2c, d) . Virions could be demonstrated ultrastructurally in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes located near sites of demyelination 1 yr after inoculation ( Fig. 2e ; this photomicrograph is characteristic of coronavirus virions found in the cytoplasm of several different oligodendrocytes).\n\nThus, this MHV-4 mutant establishes a reproducible persistent infection in mice and induces a progression from acute demyelinating disease, to a chronic recurring form. The reproducibility of this model now allows a detailed study of virus, host and genetic factors affecting virus persistence and replication in oligodendrocytes, remyelination and recurrent demyelination. The aetiology and pathogenic mechanism(s) of injury in multiple sclerosis, the most common demyelinating disease of man, is unknown. A large body of epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that this disorder is due to an autoimmune and/or viral disorder 13 \u2022 The availability of the ts8 model should help to further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism and genetic control of virus-induced acute and recurrent demyelination.\n\nWe thank Linda A.
