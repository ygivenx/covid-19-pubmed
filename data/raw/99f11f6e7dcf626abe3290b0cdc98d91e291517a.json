{"title": "Function-based mutation-resistant synthetic signaling device activated by HIV-1 proteolysis Supporting Information", "body": "The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pABM2 (pGAL4-M2-Luc), with five GAL4-binding sites 36 base pairs upstream of the adenovirus major late TATA box and with a downstream region taken from the retinoic acid receptor \uf062 2 promoter [3] [4] , was a gift from Dr. Mark S. Ptashne. The plasmid constitutively expressing the Renilla luciferase pHRL-TK (GenBank Acc. No. AF362549.1) from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) was used to normalize the level of the transfection in the experiments that used the firefly luciferase as a reporter gene.\n\nThe effector gene construct pABM2(IFN-\uf0621), which contained five GAL4-binding sites and gene for human IFN-\uf0621, was prepared from the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pABM2; we replaced the gene for the "}
