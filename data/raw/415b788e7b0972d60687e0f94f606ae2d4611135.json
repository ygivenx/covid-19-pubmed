{"title": "", "body": "(Accepted 11 September 1990) 99 A recombinant baculovirus system has been used to express the amino terminal half of the murine coronavirus (JHMV) peplomer glycoprotein in insect cells. The expressed polypeptide is glycosylated and is recognized by a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for JHMV S protein. Three of these mAbs have a very high neutralizing activity for JHMV but not for other MHV strains. These results indicate that JHMV-specific, major neutralizing epitopes reside in the ammo terminal Sl subunit of the peplomer glycoprotein.\n\nThe peplomer or S protein of murine coronaviruses forms the projecting spikes on the surface of the virus particle. This protein is associated with attachment of the virus to the cell surface, the fusion of viral and cell membranes, and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (Collins et al., 1982; Wege et al., 1984; Vennema et al., 1990; Siddell et al., 1990) . The S protein is also thought to be important for determining the pathogenic potential of the virus (Dalziel et al., 1986; Fleming et al., 1986; Wege et al., 1988) .\n\nCorrespondence to: F. Taguchi, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, 4-l-l Ogawahigashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 187, Japan.\n\nThe murine hepatitis virus (MHV) S protein is a heterodimer consisting of two non-covalently bound subunits, the amino terminal Sl and the carboxy terminal S2, which are derived by proteolytic processing of an approximately 180,000 kDa precursor . Cleavage is a host cell dependent event and is believed to be one of the processing steps necessary to activate the fusogenic capacity of the S protein (Frana et al., 1985) .\n\nIn our attempts to understand the pathogenesis of MHV-JHMV (JHMV) infections, we consider it important to locate domains on the S protein which are immunodominant and responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies.\n\nOne approach, which is appropriate in the JHMV system, is to determine the binding sites of murine mAbs which are able to neutralize virus infectivity.\n\nIn the experiments reported here we have prepared a series of mAbs specific for the JHMV S protein, selected those which are able to neutralize virus infectivity and determined their binding activities to the surface protein expressed by recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells.\n\nA complete S gene cDNA was derived from mRNA isolated from DBT cells infected with the MHV/Wbl isolate of JHMV. Within the S protein coding region this cDNA differs from the S gene sequence published by Schmidt et al. (1987) at positions 793, G + C; 794, C --$ G; 1090, T + C; and 1825, A --* G (Siddell, unpublished data). The S gene was cut at a position located 18 bases downstream of the putative S protein cleavage site (Schmidt et al., 1987 , Luytjes et al., 1987 and a universal translation terminator (ds [5'd (GCTTAATTAATTAAGC) 3'1, Pharmacia) was ligated to the 3' end of the 1.9 kb 5' proximal S gene fragment, designated as SA. BgZII-linkers were added to the SA DNA and the fragment was inserted into the BumHI site of the baculovirus transfer vector, pAcYM1 (Matsuura et al., 1987) as shown in Fig. 1A .\n\nThe sequence of this construct, pAcS*, was determined in the areas flanking the coronavirus cDNA and is shown in Fig. 1B . This sequence predicts that the initiation of the JHMV SA polypeptide should occur at the authentic S protein initiation codon and termination at a position within the universal terminator. This would add 5 amino acids (Gly-Ile-Trp-Leu-Asn) to the carboxyterminus of the SA polypeptide, which is 12 amino acids longer than the putative Sl subunit of the peplomer glycoprotein.\n\nThe predicted length of the SA polypeptide was therefore 639 amino acids (71,800 kDa) and contained 10 putative N glycosylation sites. Using this construct recombinant baculoviruses were obtained using methods which have been described previously (Yoden et al., 1989) .\n\nIn order to verify the expression of the SA polypeptide by the recombinant baculovirus in infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cells, we performed pulse-labeling/ immunoprecipitation experiments. Briefly, Sf cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and pulse-labeled with 3H leucine for 1 h at 24 h post-infection.\n\nCytoplasmic lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-JHMV sera and the labeled immune complex polypeptides were analysed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Yoden et al., 1989 , Taguchi et al., 1985 . This analysis, shown in Fig. 2 \n\nTM-). The complete JHMV S protein was also expressed using a recombinant baculovirus as has been described previously (Yoden et al., 1989) . As is evident in Fig. 2 (lane, AcS, TM-), the S protein is not cleaved in insect cells. Additionally, we have confirmed the expression of an immunoreactive S protein and SA polypeptide in insect cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3) and shown that the polypeptides are located on the cell surface (data not shown; Yoden et al., 1989) . The molecular weight of the SA polypeptide synthesized in infected Sf cells suggests that carbohydrate side chains had been attached to the majority of the potential N-glycosylation sites. To confirm this conclusion the pulse-labeling experiments were repeated in the presence of tunicamycin at a concentration of 10 pg/ml. As shown in Fig. 2 (lane AcSA, TM+) th e apparent mol. wt. of the SA polypeptide expressed in the presence of tunicamycin was reduced to approximately 70,000. This result is in agreement with the size predicted for the non-glycosylated SA polypeptide from the cDNA sequence and also indicates that the polyclonal anti-JHMV serum contains components which recognized the non-glycosylated S polypeptide.\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies selected for this study are part of a set which have been prepared by immunization of BALB/c mice with the JHMV-cl-2 isolate (Taguchi et al., 1985) . All of the these mAbs react in immunofluorescence and immuprecipitation with the S protein of JHMV-cl-2 and JHMV-sp4 (Taguchi and Fleming, 1989) and will be described in detail elsewhere (Taguchi et al., in preparation) . As is shown in Table 1 , all of mAbs except 32-4 and 141-3 have been shown to be JHMV specific, since they did not react with the other MHV strains so far examined. Three of four mAbs tested, 110-3, 75-4 and 8-1, had very high neutralizing activity (1: > 200,000) and one mAb, 32-4, had low neutralizing activity (1 : 100) as judged by the 50% plaque reduction method (Taguchi et al., 1980) . Three of the mAbs, 141-3, 104-2, and 29-6 were not able to neutralize virus infectivity. With the exception of mAb 29-6, all of the mAbs tested were shown by immunofluorescence to bind to the SA polypeptide expressed in recombinant baculovirus infected Sf cells (Table 1 and Fig. 3) . These results clearly show that there are epitopes in the Sl polypeptide of the JHMV surface protein which are able to elicit the high neutralizing antibodies (major neutralizing epitopes) as well as epitopes for low-and non-neutralizing antibodies. At the present time we are not able to say why the mAb 29-6 failed to bind to the S protein synthesized in the baculovirus system. This might result, for example, from differences in the glycosylation of the S polypeptide in insect and mammalian cells.\n\nThe conclusions presented in this paper are in good agreement with a recent report by Buchmeier and colleagues who were able to locate neutralizing epitopes in the ammo terminal half of the MHV4 S protein (Parker et al., 1989) . We believe that these combined results suggest that these epitopes are immunodominant. To date, the binding site of all the neutralizing mAbs which we have mapped are located in the Sl polypeptide.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that both the Sl and S2 subunits of the MHV-A59 S protein contain epitopes which bind neutralizing mAbs (Weismiller et al., 1990) . This conclusion was based upon the binding specificities for a large set of S protein specific mAbs derived from immunizations with JHMV DL strain (Fleming et al., 1983) and MHV-A59 (Collins et al., 1982) . However, it was conspicuous in this study that the strongly neutralizing, JHMV (DL) specific mAbs (5.1.2, 5.2.2, 5.7.2) did not react with MHV-A59, which could be due to the big antigenic difference between JHMV and A59 (Taguchi et al., 1982) and that the strongly neutralizing, MHV-A59 specific mAb (4B11.6) could not be assigned unequivocally to either the Sl or S2 subunit. Thus the binding specificities of the strongly neutralizing mAbs have not yet been determined. There is no doubt that neutralizing epitopes exist in both Sl and S2 subunits (Luytjes et al., 1989 , Weismiller et al., 1990 ; however, we believe that our data are the first to show that MHV S protein epitopes which elicit strongly neutralizing antibodies are located in the Sl subunit. This conclusion is in agreement with similar studies on the avian infectious bronchitis virus (Cavanagh et al., 1986) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Delmas et al., 1990) .\n\nFinally, Makino et al (1987) have previously used the mAbs J.2.2 and 5.7.2 to isolate recombinant viruses which escape neutralization. Originally, it was proposed, on the basis of Tl fingerprint analysis, that the crossover site of recombination in these isolates was located in the S2 subunit locus. However, recent sequence data (Banner et al., 1990) indicate that, in fact, recombination occurred in the Sl subunit locus. It therefore remains unclear whether the epitopes which bind 5.2.2 and 5.7.2 are located in the Sl or S2 subunits. It has recently been shown (Taguchi and Fleming, 1989 ) that these two mAbs do not react with the JHMV variants, sp-4 and JHM-X, which have been shown to contain genomic deletions in the Sl subunit region (Schmidt et al., 1987 , Banner et al., 1990 . It seems very likely, but not yet proven, that the epitopes for these mAbs reside in the region of the Sl subunit encompassed by these deletions."}
