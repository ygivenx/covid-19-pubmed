{"title": "Adaptive dispersal effect on the spread of a disease in a patchy environment", "body": "Because communicable diseases, such as influenza and sexual diseases, can be transmitted easily from one region to another, population dispersal plays a critical role in the spread of such diseases. Hethcote [1] is one of the pioneers who proposed epidemic models with population dispersal between two patches. Subsequently, numerous studies have contributed to investigations on the effect of population migration on the spread of disease, and to determining whether migration can increase disease persistence. When formulating such disease models with migration, the adoption of a constant or adaptive dispersal is considered.\n\nMost studies on the effect of population immigration on the spread of disease have focused on random mobility; in other words, individuals were assumed to travel among patches at constant rates. We examined SIS models with a constant dispersal rate in [ 2 , 3,4 ] . The main results include (1) establishing a threshold below which the disease becomes extinction and above which the disease persists and tends toward a certain level; and (2) identifying the effect of the dispersal rate on this critical value. From the designed examples, they revealed that, depending on other parameters in the system, changing the dispersal rate in a certain patch may either benefit or damage the capacity for disease control. However, the random behavior of each individual can be affected by change of the environment or social consideration. Accordingly, the authors in [4] proposed a compelling but unsolved problem in studying an epidemic model with a variable dispersal rate. In epidemiology, [5] is one of the few studies that examined adaptive dispersal among patches by applying mathematical models. Managing wildlife through culling, vaccination, and habitat management is efficient for disease control [6] . Therefore, the authors in [5] developed a mathematical model to describe the effect of increased movement caused by culling individuals. However, from a mathematical perspective, this model involves additional nonlinearity, and leaves the global dynamics of the endemic case unsolved.\n\nDisease information that includes the routes of transmission, the areas of outbreak, and the number of infected and killed populations are currently widely broadcast through strong media coverage. Recent studies [7, 8] have taken media coverage within a habitat into consideration to study epidemic problems. The present paper proposes an endemic model with density-dependent dispersal among patches by considering two facts: First, information on disease spread and the characteristics of pathogens is revealed through international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, and quickly communicated through media coverage, such as through television news, newspapers, Internet news, and mobile instant messaging. Education on the latent periods of disease typically results in individuals taking precautions against crowding and adopting social distancing. Second, animals have a natural reaction against disease, which possibly leads to blind escaping from crowding. In addition, the carrying capacity for a species within an area does not change according to the population number, and offspring must establish their own habitat [9] .\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a multipatch epidemic model with densitydependent migrations. We discuss how the dispersal rates of individuals depend on the population number in the habitat and the destination, and propose a class of functional responses to formulate the adaptive dispersal rates. Section 3 presents a calculation of the basic reproduction number of the connected patches, and a discussion on how media intensity influences this threshold value. To present a dynamic investigation in one model consistently, we treated a particular case and obtained global dynamics according to different levels of disease spread. In addition to the theoretical results regarding dynamical characteristics, we present examples to discuss changes in the population number concerning the strategy of adaption in Section 4 . This paper concludes by presenting a brief comparison of our results with those of other studies as well as a discussion on prediction concerns.\n\nAn endemic model is considered with multiple patches, which are connected by a population movement. The population of each patch is divided into two groups: for i \u2208 P := { 1 , 2 , . . . , p} , S i ( t ) and I i ( t ) respectively denote the number of susceptible and infectious individuals in i th patch at time t . We examine a standard proportional incidence of disease transmission [8, 10] in each patch, and assume diseases with no immune period; that is, the infectious individuals become susceptible as soon as they recover from the disease. Thus, each isolated patch is equipped with a classic SIS epidemic model.\n\nNext, we introduce an adaptive dispersal in the endemic model with a patchy environment. In the absence of media effect, population disperse randomly; that is, individuals travel among patches with constant dispersal rates. When media coverage is taken into account, the density of population will affect the strategy of migration among patches. Naturally the adaptive dispersal rate is not only related to the alertness to the disease of individuals, but also closely related to the number of total population due to obscure symptoms in the initial infection. Therefore, we comprehend the population behaviors of escaping from crowds by two factors: the dispersal rate has positive (respectively, negative) functional response to the number of total population in the habitat (respectively, destination). Therefore, we consider an adaptive dispersal rate of susceptible (respectively, infectious) individuals from patch-j to patch-i , evaluated by f ij ( N i \n\nThe assumption\n\nindicates that the population of the destination (habitat) reduces (enhances) the dispersal rate to avoid infection. The assumption (H2) means that both the death rate and the birth rate of the individual are neglected during the dispersal process, because of either the fast traffic system or the dispersal between neighboring patches. A considerable example is\n\nindicate the factors of adaption for inner-elusion in Holling\n\nType II and inter-elusion , respectively; b ij , \u02dc b i j , c ij and \u02dc c i j measure the intensity of media coverage or the level of panic. To explore a positive response in biological mechanisms, saturation or nonsaturation of the response is a trait merits consideration. It is therefore necessary to experiment with both cases. In addition, there may be examples without inter-elusion, i.e., c i j = 0 for i, j \u2208 P , due to inaccessibility of outer-information in wildlife. Accordingly, we propose two further examples for different types of mental response to media alert:\n\nThe functions in type (N ) indicate a nonlinear and saturated response to population number while those in type (L ) represent linear response and unlimited adaption. A biological reason that the p patches cannot be separated into two groups such that there is no migration of individuals between different groups suggests that the p \u00d7 p matrices ( f ij ( N i , N j )) and ( g ij ( N i , N j )) are irreducible whenever N i , N j \u2265 0 (see, for example, [11, Appendix A] ).\n\n1. The special case of (N )\n\nindicates the absence of media coverage and individuals traveling at constant rates. Epidemic models with this migration strategy have been studied in several literature, for example, see [3, 4, 12] . 2. Author in [13] studied a discrete-generation model of a single species with density-dependent migration among a chain of habitat fragments, and proposed a model with migration rates depending increasingly on the number of local population. Assumption ( H 1) for f ij and g ij agrees with this theory of adaptive dispersal rates.\n\n3. If b i j , \u02dc b i j > 0 , and both are small enough with respective to a ij and \u02dc a i j , the dispersal rates f ij and g ij are closed to a ij and \u02dc a i j , respectively, and it represents weak media effect. As b i j , \u02dc b i j are large, media coverage is comprehensive and the public will be more aware of crowds. Hence, an increase of total population in a habitat will result in higher adaption in dispersal rate. 4. When a media coverage arises in patch-j , consideration of spatial heterogeneity allows for different b i 1 j and b i 2 j for i 1 = i 2 because they relate to different destinations. The common rule is that stronger media coverage or more severe levels of panic in patch-j assumes larger b i 1 j and b i 2 j .\n\nAn SIS model with adaptive dispersal is thus described by the following system dS i dt\n\nwith non-negative initial conditions\n\nwhere A i > 0 is the recruitment rate, d i > 0 is the natural death rate, \u03b3 i > 0 is the recovery rate, \u03bd i \u2265 0 is the diseaseinduced death rate and \u03b2 i > 0 indicates the transmission coefficient.\n\nWe first introduce some notations that will be used throughout this paper. Let R p + = { x \u2208 R p | x i \u2265 0 for i \u2208 P } be the positive orthant in R p and Int R p \n\nThe following theorem shows that model (2.1) is biologically and mathematically well posed. Proof. The vector field defined by (2.1) and (2.2) is Lipschitzian in each compact set in R 2 p + , so the initial value problem has a unique solution for all t \u2265 0 as long as the boundedness of solutions holds [14] .\n\nSuppose there exist proper subsets P 1 , P 2 of P and t 0 \u2265 0 such that I i (t 0 ) = 0 for i \u2208 P 1 and I i ( t 0 ) = 0 for i \u2208 P 2 . From (2.1) and irreducibility of ( g ij ), we have\n\nfor some i \u2208 P 1 , which implies that I i is an increasing function of t at t 0 . Note that the state without any infectious individual will not change in any one I i . Thus, I i remains nonnegative for each i \u2208 P . Suppose there is one of the first S i 0 (t 1 ) = 0 for\n\n, non-negativity of each I i and irreducibility of the matrix ( f ij ), Denoting the total population of the system by\n\nBy a comparison theorem, the total population\n\nThen the positive invariance and global attractivity of G are proved by the method in [3] .\n\nIn order to verify that the model (2.1) is equipped with disease-free equilibrium (DFE), we consider\n\nwith initial value S i (0) > 0 for i \u2208 P . In [3] , the disease-free subsystem of an epidemic model was studied by using the strongly sub-linearity property. In fact, the disease-free subsystem (3.1) obey this property due to the adaption on dispersal rates. Hence, we study (3.1) by using the theory of monotone dynamical systems [15] . Indeed, the following result reveals that model (2.1) always admits a unique DFE, labeled by E 0 = (S 0\n\n0. Note that system (3.1) is cooperative, and each solution orbit has compact closure\n\nNext, we claim that the system (3.1) has unique positive equilibrium. Assume, by contrary, that \u02dc\n\nis also a positive equilibrium of (3.1) . Since the system (3.1) is cooperative and irreducible, the generated semiflow t is strongly monotone [ \n\nfor i \u2208 P , and then the assumption ( H 2) implies\n\nThis contradicts to the assumption S 0 \u02dc S 0 . Thus, S 0 is the unique positive equilibrium of (3.1) . To see that S 0 attracts all non-negative orbits of (3.1) , we first note that there exists 0 > 0 small enough such that We choose positive r 2 large enough such that\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nPrevious result is also true for the system (2.1) with other birth rate function, for example, [3, 4] . But, with the birth rate function [3, 4] , it fails to show the unique DFE for the system (2.1) by previous manner. In fact, an SIS model incorporated with such a birth rate as well as constant dispersal rates may involve multiple stability [4] .\n\nThe basic reproduction number defined in [17, 18] is an essential concept in studying infectious diseases via mathematical description. Following their recipe, we linearize the system (2.1) at the disease-free equilibrium E 0 , and obtain the next (3.2) and \u03b4 ij denotes the Kronecker delta (i.e. 1 when i = j and 0 otherwise). By the next generation method [18] , the basic reproduction number, denoted by R 0 , of the system (2.1) is given as the spectral radius of FV \u22121 ; that is,\n\nBy van den Driessche and Watmough [18, Theorem 2] , the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1 and is unstable if R 0 > 1 .\n\nIn [3] , it was shown that the basic reproduction number, which depends on the natural dispersal rate of infectious individuals, is a threshold value for the uniform persistence and extinction of the disease in a model with constant dispersal rates as well as general birth rate functions. Note that, in the model (2.1) , R 0 depends not only on the natural dispersal rates \u02dc a i j but also on the intensity of inner-and inter-elusion, \u02dc b i j and \u02dc c i j . Therefore, the media coverage certainly affects the control of disease spreading.\n\nTo better understand how the basic reproduction number relates to the media coverage, we address an example of (2.1) with a two-patch environment and the simple functional response (N ) . Fix all parameters except those related to adaptive dispersal, by setting Fig. 1 illustrates the basic reproduction number, R 0 , of the system (2.1) related to different media intensities b 21 and b 12 . Obviously, the disease spread cannot be controlled under this level of natural dispersal, and higher media intensity from endemic patch-1 helps annihilating disease in the connected system, while media coverage from disease free patch-2 damages the disease control.\n\nThere are several literature demonstrating the global stability of the DFE in different epidemic models when the basic reproduction number is under a threshold, for example, see [8, 19, 20] . However, neither the standard comparison principle used by Sun et al. [8] nor the reduction-like property quoted in [19, 20] can be applied to model (2.1) due to its adaptive dispersal. Hereafter, we assume that there is no disease-induced death (i.e., \u03bd i = 0 for i \u2208 P ), and susceptible and infectious individuals travel at the identical rates (i.e., f i j = g i j for i, j \u2208 P ). The system (2.1) becomes\n\nTo study the global dynamics of (3.4) , we add the two equations in system (3.4) , and obtain the equivalent one\n\nThe local stability of the disease-free equilibrium E 0 in system (3.4) is fully determined by R 0 . With a help of Lemma 1 , we follow the method in [3] to show the global stability of the DFE when R 0 < 1 , as in the following theorem.\n\nThe disease-free equilibrium E 0 of (3.4) is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 < 1 and unstable when R 0 > 1 .\n\nProof. From Lemma 1 , subsystem (3.5) has a unique equilibrium, denoted by N 0 = (N 0\n\nSince (H1), (H2) hold and the spectral radius of a matrix is continuous in each elementary, the spectral radius of FV \u22121 \u03b6 is continuous in \u03b6 . Thus, we can choose a positive constant \u03b6 small enough such that \u03c1(FV \u22121 \u03b6 ) < 1 . For t \u2265 t 2 , from (3.6) and\n\n( H 1), it leads to dI i dt\n\nThis suggests the following comparison linear system for (3.6) dw i dt\n\nSince V is a non-singular M-matrix [18] , we further choose \u03b6 > 0 small enough such that V \u03b6 remains as a non-singular M-matrix. Also note that F is non-negative. \n\nTherefore, the disease-free equilibrium E 0 of (3.4) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 < 1 , and hence completes the proof.\n\nThe result in Theorem 2 means that R 0 measures a sufficient condition for disease extinction. To determine whether it is pandemic in all considered regions, it is necessary to study a criterion for disease persistence. In the case of minor infection, the S -equation in (3.4) can be regarded as a perturbed system of (3.1) . Substituting the convergent result of such a perturbed system into the I -equation in (3.4) facilitates investigating whether the disease persists or not. To this end, we further extend the result in Lemma 1 to the perturbed system\n\nwhere \u02dc A i > 0 , \u02dc d i > 0 and \u03b8 are all constants, and | \u03b8 | is sufficiently small. Cooperativity is the main property to be used in proving global dynamics of (3.1) . However, (3.8) may not be cooperative due to the perturbed term \u03b8 j \u2208 P, j = i S j , and then a perturbation theory [23] is necessary to demonstrating a globally stable equilibrium. We denote the perturbed parameters by\n\n. From Lemma 1 , the Eq. (3.8) has a globally asymptotically\n\ni . The perturbed equation 3.8 has a positive equilibrium S 0 ( \u03bb) that is globally asymp-\n\nProof. We shall prove the first case, and the second one can be shown in the same manner and a simpler calculation. Set\n\nAgain, from Lemma 1 , the Eq. (3.8) has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium S 0 ( \u03bb 0 ), where \u03bb 0 = (A, d, 0) and A = (A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A p ) , d = (d 1 , d 2 , . . . , d p ) . Next, we show that U is positively invariant under the solution flow of (3.8) whenever \u2212c < \u03b8 < 0 . Suppose there is one of the first S i * (t 3 ) = 0 for t 3 \u2265 0. From (3.8) and\n\nnon-negativity of each S i , f ij , we obtain\n\nwhich is a contradiction. Hence, each solution of (3.8) starting from the region U will never leave it from the boundary with at least one zero component. In addition, such a solution satisfies\n\nhas a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium \u02dc S 0 ( \u02dc \u03bb 0 ) . By the comparison theory in [15, Theorem 5.\n\nis an equilibrium, each solution of (3.8) starting from the region U will stay therein forever. Therefore, all solutions to the family of perturbed systems (3.8) are eventually uniformly bounded. By Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 in [23] , we prove the existence of a unique equilibrium that varies continuously in the perturbed parameters, and its global stability under the solution flow of (3.8) .\n\nWith a help of Lemma 2 and the persistence theory in [24] [25] [26] , we establish the uniform persistence of disease and the existence of endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1 . Define the following sets Proof. It suffices to show that \u2202X 0 repels uniformly the solutions to the system (3.4) in X 0 . Note that both X and X 0 are positively invariant with respect to the solution flow of (3.4) , and \u2202X 0 is relatively closed in X . From Theorem 1 , system ( N i , N j ) ) is irreducible and the I equation of (3.4) is a non-autonomous cooperative system, each solution satisfies that I i ( t ) > 0 for i \u2208 P and t > 0. Thus, x \u2208 M \u2202 , and then M \u2202 \u2282 {( S , 0)| S \u2265 0}. Therefore,\n\nNote that the disease-free equilibrium E 0 is the unique equilibrium in M \u2202 . Denote the stable manifold of E 0 by W s ( E 0 ).\n\nNext, we show that W s (E 0 ) \u2229 X 0 = \u2205 when R 0 > 1 . Since R 0 > 1 , we can choose positive constants \u03be , \u03b7 small enough such that \u03c1(\n\nWe claim that, for any solution of (3.4) , lim sup\n\nIf not, there exists a t 4 > 0 such that I i ( t ) \u2264 \u03be and S i (t) N i (t) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03be , for all i \u2208 P and t \u2265 t 4 . Then for t \u2265 t 4 , we have dS i dt\n\nSimilarly, there exists a t 5 > 0 such that for t \u2265 t 5 dS i dt\n\nConsider the upper and lower systems respectively\n\nFrom Lemma 2 , we can choose small \u03be such that (3.10) (respectively, (3.11) ) admits a globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium \u02c6 S 0 (\u03be ) (respectively, \u0160 0 (\u03be ) ) in R p + (respectively, U ). By [15, Theorem 5.1.1] and the comparison of (3.10), (3.11) with the original S equation, it holds that\u0160 0 (\u03be ) \u2264\u02c6 S 0 (\u03be ) . Since \u02c6 S 0 (\u03be ) and \u0160 0 (\u03be ) are continuous in \u03be , for given \u03b7 > 0, we can choose small \u03be such that S 0 \u2212 \u03b7 < \u0160 0 (\u03be ) < \u02c6 S 0 (\u03be ) < S 0 + \u03b7. Again, by the comparison theorem [15, Theorem 5.1.1] , there is a t 6 \u2265 max { t 4 , t 5 } such that S 0 \u2212 \u03b7 < S(t ) < S 0 + \u03b7 for t \u2265 t 6 . Hence, for t \u2265 t 6 , dI i dt\n\nSince F \u03be is non-negative, V \u03be ,\u03b7 is a non-singular M-matrix for small enough \u03be and \u03b7 and \u03c1(F \u03be V \u22121 \u03be ,\u03b7 ) > 1 , the matrix M := F \u03be \u2212 V \u03be ,\u03b7 has a positive eigenvalue s ( M ) associated with a positive eigenvector [18] , it follows that lim t\u2192\u221e I i (t) = \u221e , for i \u2208 P , which is a contradiction. Hence, the inequality (3.9) holds.\n\nConsider system (3.4) , E 0 is globally asymptotically stable in M \u2202 , and then { E 0 } is an isolated invariant set and acyclic in M \u2202 . Therefore, by Thieme [24, Theorem 4.6] , it follows that system (3.4) is uniformly persistent with respect to ( X 0 , \u2202X 0 ). Moreover, from [25, Theorem 2.4] , system (3.4) has an endemic equilibrium ( S , \u012a ) \u2208 X 0 .\n\nObviously, by using the same manner, we can also show uniform persistence in the general model (2.1) without the restriction in Theorem 3 .\n\nGlobal dynamics of the endemic models with constant dispersal rates has been shown in [4, 8, 19] when the disease is pandemic. With a help of Lemma 1 , we shall investigate this issue in system (3.4) , which is equipped with adaptive dispersal, by combining convergence property of strongly sub-linear systems with the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems [21, 27] . R 0 > 1 , then (3.4) admits a unique endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable related to X 1 .\n\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 2 , we first consider N equation (3.5) of the equivalent system which has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium N 0 in the positive orthant. Since N i (t) \u2192 N 0 i as t \u2192 \u221e for i \u2208 P , the system (3.5) and (3.6) has the limiting subsystem 12) for i \u2208 P . Denote the right hand side of system (3.12) by the function : R p + \u2192 R p , and let I t be the corresponding solution flow. For given \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and I \u2208 Int R p + , it holds that ( \u03b1I ) > \u03b1 ( I ); that is, is strongly sub-linear on R p + [27] . In addition, since R 0 > 1 , the Jacobian matrix of (3.12) , D (0) = F \u2212 V, satisfies s ( D (0)) > 0. Therefore, there is a globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium I * with respect to R p\n\nLet t ( N (0) , I (0)) denote the solution flow generated by (3.5) and (3.6) . By Theorem 1 , the orbit { t ( N (0) , I (0))| t > 0} is precompact, and the forward limit set of ( N, I ) exists, denoted by \u03c9 ( N, I ) . Let \u03c9 I (N, I) be the projection of \u03c9 ( N,\n\nSince I * is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of (3.12) in R p + \\ { 0 } , it follows that \u03c9 I (N, I) contains I * . By the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems [21, Theorem 2.3] , we conclude that the equilibrium E * = (N 0 , I * ) is a globally attractor in X 1 .\n\nNext, we show that the endemic equilibrium E * is locally asymptotically stable. It is equivalent to examine the stability of the Jacobian matrix of the system (3.4) at E * , i.e.,\n\nwhere J 11 , J 21 , J 22 are p \u00d7 p matrices defined as\n\nIt is sufficient to show the stability of both J 11 and J 22 . From ( H 1), ( H 2) and d i > 0, J 11 is an irreducible and quasi-positive matrix with negative column sum, and then we have s ( J 11 ) < 0 from the Perron-Frobenius Theorem; see, for example, [15, Corollary 4.3.2] . From (3.5) , \u02dc\n\nand then s ( \u02dc J 22 ) = 0 . In addition, a direct calculation gives\n\nFrom [15, Corollary 4.3.2] , we have s ( J 22 ) < 0. Therefore, the endemic equilibrium E * is locally asymptotically stable, and it completes the proof of the theorem.\n\nWhen the threshold R 0 > 1 in (3.4 ) , the following result shows that the existence and the globally asymptotical stability of the unique endemic equilibrium still hold in (2.1) when the disease has mild effect on the dispersal of infectious individuals, i.e. g ij ( \u00b7, \u00b7) \u2248 f ij ( \u00b7, \u00b7) in (2.1) , and the disease rarely induces death, i.e. \u03bd i \u2248 0 in (2.1) . To study this case, we regard the variable dispersal rate of infectious individuals as the perturbation of the variable dispersal rate of susceptible individuals. By using a perturbation result for a globally stable equilibrium in [23] , we present a proof analogous to those in [4, 28] . First, we set further notations to discuss this issue in (2.1) . Equip the space of continuous functions R p g \u2208 B (f , \u03b5 ) with g ij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P, the system (2.1) admits a unique endemic equilibrium E * (g ) = (S * (g ) , I * (g )) , which is globally asymptotically stable with respect to X 1 .\n\nProof. Note that the disease-free equilibrium ( S 0 , 0) is independent in functions g . By (H1) and (H2), R 0 is continuous in the function g . From the assumption, there exists an \u03b5 0 > 0 such that R 0 > 1 for g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 0 ). Let ( g , t ) denotes the solution flow generated by (2.1) . By Theorem 1 , the bounded and closed set G satisfies that for any ( S, I ) \u2208 X 1 and g ij with g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 0 ), there exists t 7 = t 7 ((S, I) , g ) > 0 such that ( g , t )( S, I ) \u2208 G for all t \u2265 t 7 .\n\nThere are two criteria in [23] to determine the perturbation result for a globally stable equilibrium: (i) existence of a global attractor A g of ( g , t ): X 1 \u2192 X 1 for each g near the function f , (ii) for all t > 0, ( g , t ) A g are uniformly bounded by a pre-compact set in X 1 . First, by Remark 4 , for each g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 0 ), ( g , t ) is uniformly persistent with respect to ( X 1 , \u2202X 0 ), and then by Hale and Waltman [29, Theorem 3.2] , there is a global attractor A g of ( g , t ):\n\nFrom the proof in Theorem 1 , ( g , t ) X \u2192 X is compact for all g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 0 ) and t > 0. Then for any fixed t > 0, ( \u00b7, t )( x ): B ( f , \u03b5 0 ) \u2192 X is continuous uniformly for x in any bounded Y \u2282 X . By using the method in the proof of [30, Theorem 3.1] and regarding the parameter space as a functional space equipped with the previously defined norm, it shows\n\nis compact in X . From Lemma 1 , the case g ij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P and R 0 > 1 implies a unique equilibrium ( S 0 , 0) in \u2202X 0 and \u222a x \u2208 \u2202X 0 \u03c9 g (x ) = { (S 0 , 0) } . Clearly, {( S 0 , 0)} is an acyclic covering of itself. In addition, from Theorem 3 and Remark 4 , there exists \u03be = \u03be (\u03b5 0 ) > 0 such that for any g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 0 ), we have lim sup t\u2192 + \u221e (g , t )(x ) \u2212 (S 0 , 0) \u2265 \u03be , for all x \u2208 X 1 . Then, by the theorem on the uniform persistence uniform in parameters [30, Theorem 4.3 and Remark 4.2] , there exist \u03b5 1 \u2208 (0, \u03b5 0 ] and \u03c4 > 0, such that lim inf t\u2192 + \u221e d( (g , t )(x ) , \u2202X 0 ) \u2265 \u03c4 for all x \u2208 X 1 and g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 1 ) with g ij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P . Thus, there is a compact and positive invariant subset G 0 of X 1 such that A g \u2282 G 0 for all g \u2208 B ( f , \u03b5 1 ). Therefore, for all t > 0,\n\nand then \u222a g \u2208 B (f ,\u03b5 1 ) (g , t ) A g is compact in X 1 .\n\nBy Theorem 4 , system (2.1) admits an endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable in X 1 . From previous results and the perturbation theory in [23, Theorem 2.2] , there exists an \u03b5 \u2208 (0 , \u03b5 1 ] such that for any g \u2208 B (f , \u03b5 ) with g ij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P , the system (2.1) admits an endemic equilibrium E * (g ) = (S * (g ) , I * (g )) which is globally asymptotically stable in X 1 .\n\nThe uniform boundedness in Theorem 1 refers to the general mode (2.1) . Therefore, we can consider the model with disease-induced death by regarding the death rate as a perturbed parameter and by using the same theory to show that an endemic equilibrium, if exists, is globally asymptotically stable in the system (2.1) .\n\nTheoretical results in previous section inform us the global dynamics of (2.1) , i.e., all solutions either approach to the disease-free equilibrium or converge to the unique endemic equilibrium, according to the level of the basic reproduction number. In addition, this threshold was numerically shown to depend on the strategy of adaptive dispersal. From the biological viewpoint, there are further questions to be addressed. For examples, (i) How does the media coverage affect the distribution of survival population among connected regions when the disease goes extinction? (ii) If the disease is pandemic, the same question arises for all population, especially for the infectious individuals. (iii) How does the media coverage influence the speed of disease to goes extinction? To investigate these problems, we carry out three examples for (2.1) with two patch.\n\nTo explore the problem (ii), we address the first example with adaption in a single patch. Consider the model ( Fig. 2 depicts the values of I * 1 and I * 2 depending on the inner-elusion rate, b 21 , in the patch-1. First, taking inner-elusion in patch-1 helps inner control of disease spread, but damages the disease control in patch-2. Hence, adopting adaptive dispersal in a patchy disease model represents competition of disease control between different patches. Second, for fixed positive b 21 , the population of infectious individuals I * 1 in patch-1 under linearly adaptive dispersal rate, is smaller than that under the case of nonlinear adaption. Therefore, it is more efficient to control disease by adopting linearly adaptive dispersal rather than nonlinearly adaptive dispersal. On the other hand, the linear case also induces more disservice on disease control than the nonlinear one in the other patch-2.\n\nWe further simulate the model (2.1) with adaption in both patches to see the competition between patches. In the following, we also choose previous parameters except b 21 = kb 12 for positive constant k , and the nonlinearly adaptive dispersal (N ) . Taking different values of k means different levels of dispersal adaption in two patches. In Fig. 3 , when k = 1 , the same level of adaption are adopted in both patches, and then the intensity of adaption, values of b 12 = b 21 , does not improve the disease control in both patches. For larger k = 2 or 5, patch-1 adopts stronger adaption related to that in patch-2, and then higher level of adaption obviously improves the disease control in patch-1.\n\nTo explore the problems (i) and (iii), that is for the case R 0 < 1 , we investigate in Fig. 4 the effect of media coverage on the time that it takes for a pre-existing epidemic to go extinct and on the distribution of final healthy population. Herein, we simulate the evolution of each solution to system (2.1) with the functional response (N ) by setting Fig. 4 a shows that the natural dispersal can eliminate the disease as the theoretical results in previously mentioned literature. Comparing Fig. 4 b or c with a, it reveals that taking the strategy of media coverage would lead to a large reduction in time to extinction of the disease in the local patch. On the other hand, it also greatly reduce the total population of the patch that executes the policy. Finally, Fig. 4 d reveals an interesting result that, by taking the same intensity of media coverage, the amounts of both compartments in different patches synchronize in time.\n\nThe model (2.1) is a prototype to describe possible adaptive dispersal between different regions due to the threat of an infectious disease. It assumes a constant intensity, c ij , of media report in each patch. In fact, there may exists complicated process leading to the outbreak of a disease, and the intensity of media varies to reflect different levels of disease spread. Here, we review the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 to see how the media report affected the strategy of dispersal between Mainland China and Taiwan, two patches which are connected mainly by airplanes, during the period of epidemic. We refer to the monthly data of the ratio of immigration among the total population reported by Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan [31] . Fig. 5 a depicts the effect of SARS on the number of immigration from Mainland China (patch-2) into Taiwan (patch-1). The dash curve represents the ratio of immigration for each month in 2002 by natural dispersal from Mainland China into Taiwan ( a 12 ), and the solid curve is the ratio of each month in 2003 effected by the impact of SARS. In Fig. 5 b, we calculate the intensity of adaption according to the data in Fig. 5 a and the mode of adaption (N ) with b 12 = 0 , for focusing on the role of c 12 . According to the report of World Health Organization, the first onset of SARS in Taiwan happened at 2003 March 13, and the broad spread begun around mid-April and ended at mid-June [32] . The intensity of adaption in Fig. 5 b, which reveals larger values from April to July, agrees with the period of outbreak of SARS. Therefore, the intensity of media influence varies to reflect different levels of disease spread and the dispersal rate of population between Mainland China and Taiwan does change and depend on the intensity of media report.\n\nWe used the proposed model to investigate the influence of media coverage among spatially distinct patches of habitat by adapting dispersal rates. Our results showed that the basic reproduction number R 0 was a threshold parameter of disease spread. Specifically, the epidemic model either has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when R 0 < 1 , or a globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1 , if the disease mildly influences the dispersal of infectious individuals, and if the disease rarely induces death.\n\nIn [7, 8] , media coverage was assumed to affect only the interactions of the local population through the incidence rate, and did not play a role in R 0 because the basic reproduction number was evaluated in the absence of disease. By contrast, from (3.2) and (3.3) , the assumption in our model on media-induced adaption effects on dispersal affects this threshold value for predicting disease outbreak. In addition to theoretically determining the convergence dynamics under certain cri- study. In addition to the SIS model with contagious transmission, adaptive dispersal can be considered in other epidemic models, including noncontagious diseases such as vector-host models."}
