{"title": "COVID-19 clinical characteristics, and sex-specific risk of mortality: Systematic Review 3 and Meta-analysis 4 5", "body": "presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality 127 compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01). 128\n\nConclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with 129 more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory 130 findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China 131\n\nwith Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females. 132 133\n\nWhat is already known in this topic: 135\n\n\u2022 COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. 136 \u2022 Many observational studies have separately dealt with different clinical and epidemiologic 137 features of this new and rapidly evolving disease. 138\n\n\u2022 Very few systematic reviews about COVID-19 have been done and there was still a need 139 for a systematic review and meta-analysis related to the clinical findings and the mortality 140 of the disease in order to have a better understanding of COVID-19. 141\n\n\u2022 Previous reports have indicated that older age and presence of multiple comorbidities are 142 associated with increased mortality. 143\n\nWhat this study adds: 144 .

Since then, it has infected hundreds of 175 thousands of people around the world and resulted in more than 13000 deaths up to this date (4) . 176\n\nDespite governmental travel restrictions in many countries, the confirmed number of new cases 177 has been rising globally.

In SARS, younger males were at twice the risk of death compared to females and 183 the difference in mortality reduced with older age (6) . The case fatality rate observed in males was 184 twice that of females in MERS (7) . The effect of sex on COVID-19 mortality was unknown. We 185 evaluated this risk for COVID-19 patients as well. 186\n\nThe novelty of COVID19 has raised many questions about the epidemiology of the disease, 188 clinical and laboratory methods of diagnosis as well as therapeutic measures. Thus far, many 189 observational studies have been dealing with these features separately, however, there is still a 190 necessity for more systematic reviews specially to understand role of the sex in mortality of 191 (8) . The study did not require any ethics committee approval. 204\n\nThis research was done without patient involvement. Patients were not invited to comment on the 205 study design and were not consulted to develop patient relevant outcomes or interpret the results. 206\n\nPatients were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or 207 accuracy. 208\n\nThe records found through database searching were merged and the duplicates were removed 210 using EndNote X7 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY, USA). Two reviewers (YF and PJ) 211 independently screened the records by title and abstract to exclude those not related to the current 212 study. The full texts of potentially eligible records were retrieved and evaluated by a third reviewer 213 (AT). Included studies met the following inclusion criteria: (i) patients were confirmed and 214 diagnosed with RT-PCR as suggested by WHO; (ii) The raw data for clinical, radiological and 215 laboratory findings were included; and (iii) the outcomes were addressed. Studies with insufficient 216 information about patients' characteristics and outcomes were excluded. Case reports, reviews, 217 and animal studies were also excluded. Only studies written in English were selected. 218\n\nData extraction and quality assessment 219 .

These reviewers extracted 220 the data from all eligible studies and differences were resolved by consensus. The following data 221 were extracted: first author name; year of publication; type of study, country/ies where the study 222 was conducted; distribution of age and sex in the population, number of patients investigated, 223 data for clinical, radiological and laboratory findings, and outcomes. 224\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College 226\n\nStation, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using 227 random effect model. The between-study heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q and the 228 I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed statistically by using Begg's and Egger's tests (p<0.05 229 was considered indicative of statistically significant publication bias). 230\n\nThe checklist provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) was used to perform quality 232 assessment (9) . 233 234\n\nThe search yielded 1102 publications, of which 259 potentially eligible studies were identified for 236\n\nfull-text review, resulting in 32 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria ( Figure 1) Table 2) . 244\n\nThe most common comorbidities were respectively hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7-24.4), 246 cardiovascular diseases (14.9 %, CI 6.0-23.8), diabetes (10.8 %, CI 8.3-13.3), chronic liver 247 disease (8.1, CI 4.6-11.6) and smoking (8.0%, CI 2.3-13.6) ( Table 3) . 248\n\nThe most frequent abnormal laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 were respectively, 250 (Table 4) . 253\n\nAmong the confirmed COVID19 subjects, 14.0% (CI, 6.7-29.0) had viremia. Impaired hepatic 254 function with ALT levels greater than 47.25 U/L was seen in 13.3% (CI 3.2-41.0) of COVID19 255 subjects. Acute cardiac injury with troponin levels greater than 28 pg/ml was seen in 12.4% of 256 .

Acute kidney injury was found in 5.5% (CI 1.3-20.8). Shock was reported in 4.0% (CI 257 1.6-12.0) shock. 13.0% (CI 4.8-30.0) met the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome 258 (ARDS). 259\n\nChest X-Ray (CXR) and chest CT-scan were the common imaging modalities used for the (Table 5) . 267\n\nHospitalization was required in 94.6% of patients with severe COVID-19. The pooled mortality 269 rate of these patients was about 6.6% (CI 2.8-15.0) ( Table 6, Table 8 , men had significantly higher mortality in the hospital compared to women (OR 3.4; 274 95% CI 1.2-9.1, P = 0.01).

The pooled sensitivity of CT-288 san for COVID19 was 79.3%. We found 20.7% of the patients with confirmed RT-PCR who had 289 normal chest CT-Scan suggesting that a normal chest CT-scan cannot rule out the disease in 290 patients who are highly suspicious for COVID-19. Several complications were seen due to 291 COVID-19. Among these, acute hepatitis was the most common one occurring in 13.3% of cases, 292 followed by cardiac injury with troponin levels greater than 28 pg/ml seen in 12.4%. The pooled 293 mortality rate of these patients was 6.6%. We detected several factors contributing to a worse 294 outcome including old age, male sex, presence of underlying diseases and some abnormal 295 laboratory finding such as high level of D-Dimer.

In a study done by Zhang et al in Wuhan, fever was identified as 301 the most common clinical finding present in 91.7% of the patients followed by cough in 75% of 302 patients. Their study showed a higher gastrointestinal (GI) manifestation at presentation of the 303 disease, representing 39.6% of the patients (10) . Our study showed a lower prevalence of GI 304 symptoms including diarrhea, which was present in 5.7% of patients and nausea/vomiting in 5%. 305\n\nThe most prevalent comorbidities in our study were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7-24.4) followed 307 by cardiovascular diseases (14.9 %, CI 6.0-23.8) and diabetes (10.8 %, CI 8.3-13.3). According 308 to a systematic review for comorbidities by Yang et al, hypertension (17 \u00b1 7%, CI 14-22%) and 309 diabetes (8 \u00b1 6%, CI 6-11%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (5 \u00b1 4%, CI 4-7%) were the 310 most common comorbid findings (11) . The high prevalence of hypertension and other 311 cardiovascular comorbidities have raised speculation regarding the role of angiotensin-converting 312 enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has 313 been identified as the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells and previous studies 314 have shown that the usage of ACEI results in the upregulation of ACE2 (12) (13) . Theoretically, 315 this increase in ACE2 levels could result in a greater risk of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 316 .
