Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes.

This global public health emergency is attracting most concern throughout the world.\n\nHost immune response is essential for the clearance of coronavirus infection, and the balance between coronavirus and host immunity is key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine infection outcome 1 . Coronaviruses encode numerous viral gene products to evade and suppress host immune response, such as SARS-associated coronavirus nonstructural protein 1, which is able to inhibit host interferon-dependent antiviral signaling 2 , as well as another SARS coronavirus protein named open reading frame-9b, which can suppress mitochondria of immune cells 3 . Coronavirus suppressing host immunity has been demonstrated, however, the alterations of immune system in patients with COVID-2019 are not yet well understood.\n\nIn this study, we aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels. We hope to reveal that immuno-depletion carries a higher risk of death for COVID-2019 patients.\n\nThis is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 31, 2020 to February 6, 2020.

The mean age of these patients are 74.3 \u00b1 8.1 years. Patient 1 had a medical history of prostatic hyperplasia and Patient 3 had chronic bronchitis, while Patient 2 reported no underlying historic medical conditions. From the collection of clinical features, we found that all patients reported fever and dyspnea (Table 1) . Moreover, Patient 1 also had diarrhea, and Patient 3 had cough and myalgia/fatigue additionally. Laboratory findings show that C-reactive protein (CRP) were obviously increased in all patients, and decreased lymphocyte counts and increased procalcitonin were observed in Patient 2 and 3 (Table 1) . Additionally, Patient 2 also had elevated hypersensitive troponin I, creatine, and urea in serum, indicating myocardial injury and renal function damage. Patient 3 had increases in aspartate aminotransferase (ASL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ( Table 1) , which indicate liver injury. During the hospitalization, all patients received empirical antiviral and antibiotic treatment (Table 1) . Patient 1 also experienced intravenous immunoglobulin therapy from day 11 of hospitalization (Table 1) . Notably, three patients died on day 24, 13, 12 of hospitalization, respectively.\n\nTo determine the dynamic changes of different immune cells in all patients, we analyzed\n\nNK cells in the peripheral blood of three patients at different time points during the hospitalization. As shown in Figure 1A , Patient 1 had sustained decrease in all types of immune cells during the course. Specifically, CD3+, CD4, CD8+ T cells counts were always below normal range, and CD19+ B cells count dropped below normal range from day 12 and CD16+56+ NK cells count dropped below normal range from day 16.\n\nSimultaneously, Patient 1 received oxygen support through oxygen mask (5 L/min) and even high flow oxygen ( Figure 1A ) due to hypoxemia.

On day 15, invasive mechanical ventilation was used on him due to sudden respiratory failure, while it didn't work and the patient died at day 24. Patient 2 had sustained decrease in all types of immune cells at the first six days below normal range ( Figure 1B) and hypoxemia. Oxygen mask and high flow oxygen were used to correct the hypoxemia, but the SaO2 was almost decreased along the way from day 6 ( Figure 1B) . Eventually, Patient 2 died at day 13.\n\nIn Patient 3, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells were obviously decreased below normal range and CD3+, CD4+ T cells presented a sustained decline from day 4 ( Figure 1C ).\n\nAdditionally, during the oxygen support (oxygen mask, > 5 L/min), the SaO2 of this patient was oddly declined. From day 8, noninvasive mechanical ventilation was used but didn't work ( Figure 1C) . The patient presented a progressive and refractory hypoxemia, and died on day 12. From these results, we found that all patients had immunodepletion and refractory hypoxemia. Interestingly, the phenomenon of immunodepletion appeared earlier than refractory hypoxemia in patients during the progression of COVID-2019 pneumonia.\n\nThrough the NTS test, we analyzed the gut microbiota at the level of phylum and genus the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030650 doi: medRxiv preprint because of the increase of Ruthenibacterium (35.12%) at the genus level, which is significantly higher than that of health cohort (P<0.0001). At the same time, the Aspergillus (59.41%) dominates the intestinal fungal flora of this patient. Overall, all data are significantly different from healthy human gut microbiota (P <0.001).\n\nIn this study, we revealed the clinical characteristics of 3 critical patients with COVID-2019, and found that (1) hypoxemia severity was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells, which indicated that immuno-depletion may well be a key risk factor in the development of COVID-2019, and (2) the imbalance of gut microbiota was also found in these critical patients, which may lead to microbial translocation and a second infection.\n\nThe balance between virus and host immunity is closely associated with the outcome of an infection. Clinical studies have shown that coronavirus infection severity was linked to patient health status and an immunocompromised state carried an increased risk of death 6, 7 . It was also demonstrated that the immunosuppressed rhesus macaques had markedly increased MERS-Coronavirus replication in the lung, suggesting the inability in virus clearance 8 Multiple studies have demonstrated the interaction between immune system and gut All rights reserved.

It was shown that a variety of immune factors was capable of altering gut microbiota homeostasis balance, such as IL-10, IL-23, NLRP6, NOD-like receptor protein 3, and IgA 13 . And the imbalance or dysbiosis in gut microbiota would contribute to an enhanced mucosal permeability and thus leading to microbial translocation and a second infection. Moreover, gut microbiota was able to modulate the immune response and played an important role in immune-mediated diseases, suggesting a vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance 14 . All these findings indicated that the balance of gut microbiota can be disrupted in case of coronavirus infection due to the immune disorder. In this study, we further identified the changes in gut microbiota during the novel coronavirus infection and found that (1) the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and (2) the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. In addition, we also found that the fungi in the gut microbiota of the two patients are not common fungi in healthy cohort (eg. Candida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), some rare fungi dominate the fungal of gut microbiota, such as Aspergillus, Kluyveromyces.\n\nInsight into which species of the microbiota are altered by immune-depletion associated with novel coronavirus infection can help us have a better understanding of the characteristics of COVID-2019.\n\nBased on our findings, we suggested that the early interventions of host immune system and gut microbiota are necessary for COVID-2019 patients with refractory hypoxia. For these critical patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy also should be supported early to ameliorate the symptom of refractory hypoxia.\n\nIn conclusion, we discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia."}
