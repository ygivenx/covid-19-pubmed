{"title": "PLANT-Dx: A Molecular Diagnostic for Point of Use Detection of Plant Pathogens", "body": "PLANT-Dx Reactions: PLANT-Dx consists of two reaction steps. First, Small Transcription Activating RNA (STAR) encoding DNA templates are produced from viral genomic material within an RPA reaction. This reaction product is then added into a cell-free gene expression reaction for signal processing and visual output.\n\nPlant virus nucleic acid sources: Cell lysates were prepared by quickly (3s) grinding using a fingernail (or coin) 20mg of N. tabacum leaf in lysis buffer (150mM KCl, 25mM Tris pH 7.5, 5mM EDTA, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 1\u00d7 HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.5mM DTT, 100 U/ml RNase OUT (ThermoFisher Scientific)) in an extraction bag (Bioreba), and rapidly snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, before storing at -80\u2022C. Cucumber mosaic virus infected material was similarly obtained from symptomatic N. tabacum leaf taken from plants inoculated, two weeks prior, with Bn57-CMV. PVY transcripts were generated from T7-tagged PCR products covering two regions of the PVY-O (Acc. No. AJ890349) genome (21-936nts and 6903-7899nts). CMV transcripts were generated from PCR product covering the entire Bn57-CMV's (Acc. No , and 55\u03bcl H2O. Product was ethanol precipitated and run through a 20% Acrylamide gel with the correct band being excised with UV shadowing. This product was then eluted overnight in TE buffer and ethanol precipitated.\n\nRecombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) reactions were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Twist-DX TwistAMP\u00ae Liquid Basic RT). RPA reactions were prepared with 2.4\u03bcl of 10\u03bcM forward and reverse primer specific to the viral sample input (Supplementary Table 1 ), 29.5\u03bcl buffer, 11.2\u03bcl water, 2U Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche), and 1\u03bcl of analyte (IVT product RNA at a concentration of 1nM, infected lysate, uninfected lysate, or water control) for a 50\u03bcl total volume. Reactions were run at 41\u1d52C in a thermocycler without a heated lid for 8 minutes. Reactions were then gently mixed and microfuged followed by an additional 41\u1d52C incubation for 32 minutes. 2.4\u03bcl of this product was utilized within each corresponding cell free reaction.\n\nCell free extract and buffer were prepared as previously described with the buffer being supplemented with 80mM K-glutamate and 2mM Mg-Glutamate 1 , and the cell lysis step performed with sonication. Sonication was performed with a sonicator (QSonica) using 6 pulses for 10 seconds with 10 second pauses inbetween, at an amplitude of 50% 2 . Industry) and then preincubated on a thermocycler at 29\u1d52 C for 10 minutes. Following incubation, 7 nM of linearized target reporter plasmid was added along with 2.4 \u03bcl of the RPA reaction product. These target reporter plasmids were linearized with PCR and purified with PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). 10\u03bcl of the final reaction mix was placed into 3 separate wells on a 384 well microplate (Nunc Cat# 3712), sealed with an optically clear plate seal (Thermo Sci Cat#232701), and loaded into a SynergyH1 microplate reader (Biotek). The reader was programmed to observe absorbance at 385nm, sampling at 3 min intervals, while holding at 31\u1d52C.\n\nTo test PLANT-Dx using body heat, an RPA reaction from CMV-infected or uninfected Arabidopsis plant lysate was setup as above. Reaction vessels were then taped under the axilla and pressed against the body and arm for 40 min of incubation. Following the incubation, 2.4 \u03bcl of the RPA reaction product was added into a cell free reaction containing CMV reporter constructs (Supplementary Table 1 ) prepared in the same manner as above, and tapped onto the lower forearm for 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nIn vitro transcription was used to produce a representative 4nM stock of CMV's 3 rd RNA. This stock was serially diluted in 1/10 by adding 5\u03bcl to 45\u03bcl of water down to 44fM. One \u03bcl from each dilution was then used in the PLANT-Dx procedure described above, and analyzed on the SynergyH1 microplate reader (Biotek). Significance was determined by computing the Student's t-test between the 4.4pM condition and a (-) template control which did not contain the IVT product.\n\nPhotography: All images were taken using an iPhone 8 (Apple) with the default photography application. The background of images was cropped using the masking tool within Adobe Illustrator. \n\nA strand displacing polymerase is then able to elongate from the forward primer. 5: This leads to the development of a cDNA template. 6: Recombinase facilitates the strand invasion and binding of both the forward and reverse primers. Single stranded DNA binding proteins help stabilize the formation of a D loop enabling this primer invasion. 7: Strand displacing polymerase can then extend the oligo. 8: This produce a novel dsDNA construct that can then serve as a template for the next round resulting in exponential amplification in an isothermal reaction. Overhanging sequences can be designed into the primers, which are incorporated into the final dsDNA product. In this work overhang sequences are used to add a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a fragment of a STAR sequence ( Figure 1A) for downstream detection of an RNA produced from the RPA product. Figure 2 : Small Transcription Activating RNA (STAR) mechanism 5 . Target DNA plasmid consists of a reporter gene transcriptionally gated by the presence of a 5' terminating hairpin (Target). In the absence of a STAR, the terminating hairpin folds, preventing downstream transcription of the reporter gene (OFF). When present, the STAR RNA binds to the linear region and 5' stem of the terminator, destabilizing the structure and allowing for downstream transcription of the desired reporter gene (ON). Figure 3 : Correlation between absorbance value on a SynergyH1 microplate reader (Biotek) with visual perception of color change in a catechol expression experiment. Reactions were allowed to proceed until a yellow pigment was clearly visible and then serially diluted with water. These dilutions were first photographed and then their absorbance was measured on the plate reader. In some instances, depending on the lighting and individual, we report that it is possible to discern down to 0.5 Abs(385nm). Based upon this data, we have identified an absorbance of 0.8 to be our limit of detection (LOD). Figure 4 : Catechol to hydroxymuconic semialdehyde reaction. The enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (CDO) rapidly cleaves catechol into hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. This product can be detected by a measure of the absorbance at 385nm (SI Figure 3 ). "}
