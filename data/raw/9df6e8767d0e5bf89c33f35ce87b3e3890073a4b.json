{"title": "", "body": "The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV, officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) belongs to the genus \u03b2, with envelope, round or elliptic and often pleomorphic form, and 60-140 nm in diameter. The virus genetically differs considerably from those of SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV. Current studies show that the homology between 2019-nCoV and bat-SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45) is over 85%. When cultured in vitro, 2019-nCoV can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells after about 96 hours, while it takes about 6 days to isolate and culture Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.\n\nKnowledge on the physical and chemical characteristics of coronaviruses is mainly derived from the study of SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV. Coronaviruses are sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat, and can be effectively inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and lipid solvents such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform except chlorhexidine.\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted by droplets and contact. Aerosol transmission is possible when people have prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in relatively closed spaces.\n\nHumans of all ages are generally susceptible.\n\nBased on current epidemiological investigations, the incubation period of COVID-19 is ranged between 1 and 14 days, and generally within 3 to 7 days.\n\nFever, fatigue and dry coughing are considered the main clinical manifestations, but symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose, pharyngalgia, myalgia and diarrhea are relatively less common. In severe cases, dyspnea and/or hypoxemia usually occurs after one week of disease onset, and the worse can rapidly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis hard to correct, and hemorrhage and coagulation dysfunction, multiple organ failure, etc. It's worth noting that patients with severe or critical illness may have a moderate to low fever, or no fever at all.\n\nMild cases only present with light fever, mild fatigue and so on without manifestation of pneumonia.\n\nFrom the cases treated currently, most of the patients have a favorable prognosis. The elderly and people with chronic underlying diseases usually have poor prognosis while cases with relatively mild symptoms are common in children.\n\nIn the early stage of COVID-19, a normal or decreased total white blood cell count and a decreased lymphocyte count can be found in patients. In addition, increased value of liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), muscle enzymes and myoglobin can occur in some patients; and raised level of troponin can be seen in some critically ill patients. In most cases, the laboratory tests show a raised C-reactive protein value and erythrocyte sedimentation rate but a normal procalcitonin value. Among severe patients, D-dimer value is increased and peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased persistently. In addition, elevated values of inflammatory factors are accompanied with in severe and critical patients.\n\nThe nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV can be detected in biological specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces.\n\nTo improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection, it is recommended to collect and retain sputum in general patients besides those performed with tracheal intubation (lower respiratory tract secretions should be collected); and all the specimens should be sent and tested as fast as possible.\n\nIn the early stage of COVID-19, the images show that there are multiple small patched shadows and interstitial changes, especially in the lung periphery. As the disease progresses, the images of these patients further develop into multiple ground glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs. In severe cases, lung consolidation may occur. It is seldom to find pleural effusion in patients with COVID-19.\n\nThe suspected cases should be diagnosed through considering both the epidemiological histories and clinical manifestations: (c) In the early stage, a normal or decreased total white blood cell count and a decreased lymphocyte count can be found.\n\nPatients who meet any one of the epidemiological exposure histories as well as any two of the clinical manifestations can be diagnosed as suspected cases. Patients with no definite epidemiological history can be diagnosed only if all the three clinical manifestations are met.\n\nThe suspected cases with one of the following etiological evidences can be diagnosed as confirmed cases \n\nThe clinical symptoms are mild and no pneumonia manifestation can be found in imaging.\n\nPatients have symptoms like fever and respiratory tract symptoms, etc. and pneumonia manifestation can be seen in imaging.\n\nMeeting any of the following: 5.3.1. Respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min; 5.3.2. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) \u2264 93% on room air at rest state; 5.3.3. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) \u2264300 mmHg.\n\nAt higher altitudes (above 1 km), PaO 2 /FiO 2 values should be adjusted based on equation of PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u00d7 [Atmospheric Pressure (mmHg)/760].\n\nPatients with >50% lesions progression within 24 to 48 h in pulmonary imaging should be treated as severe cases.\n\nMeeting any of the following: 5.4.1. Respiratory failure occurs and mechanical ventilation is required; 5.4.2. Shock occurs; 5.4.3. Complicated with other organ failure that requires monitoring and treatment in ICU.\n\n6. Differential diagnosis 6.1. The mild manifestations caused by COVID-19 should be distinguished from respiratory infections caused by other viruses. 6.2. COVID-19 should be distinguished from viral pneumonia caused by influenza virus, adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, and mycoplasma pneumonia. Especially for suspected cases, rapid antigen detection, multiple PCR nucleic acid test and other methods should be adopted to examine common respiratory pathogens. 6.3. In addition, differentiation from non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia should also be performed.\n\nMedical staff at all levels and types of medical institutions should immediately isolate and treat every suspected case that meet the definition of the disease in a single room. After in-hospital experts' consultation or attending physicians' consultation, people still be considered as suspected cases need to be reported online within 2 hours. Specimens should be collected and tested for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Suspected patients should be transferred to the designated hospitals as soon as possible. People intimately contacted with COVID-19 patients or those even with positive results in common respiratory pathogens test, are also recommended to conduct the pathogenic detection 2019-nCoV in time.\n\n8.1. Determine the treatment place according to the severity of the disease 8.1.1. Suspected and confirmed cases should be isolated and treated in designated hospitals with effective isolation and protective conditions. Suspected cases should be treated in single rooms, while confirmed cases can be admitted to the same ward. 8.1.2. Critical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible.\n\n8.2.1. Rest patients in bed, strengthen supportive treatment, and ensure adequate nutrition. Keep the balance of water and electrolyte to maintain the stability of the internal environment. Closely monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, etc. 8.2.2. Monitor blood routine, urine routine, C-reactive protein, biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, myocardial enzyme, renal function, etc.), coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis, chest imaging, etc. according to the patient's condition. If possible, cytokine testing should be conducted. 8.2.3. Give effective oxygen therapy measures in time, including nasal cannula, mask oxygen, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. 8.2.4. Antiviral treatment: Alpha-interferon nebulization (5 million units or equivalent with 2 ml of sterile water for injection per time for adult, twice per day); lopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/100 mg/capsule, two capsules each time, twice per day for adults, the course of treatment should be <10 days); ribavirin (for adults, 500 mg ribavirin injection combined with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir per time is recommended, two or three times per day, the course of treatment should be <10 days); chloroquine phosphate (for adult, 500 mg each time, twice per day, the course of treatment should be <10 days); arbidol (for adults, 200 mg each time, three times per day, the course of treatment should be <10 days). Keep alert on side effects related to lopinavir/ritonavir, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and liver damage, as well as harmful interaction with other drugs. Effects of current trial drugs should be further evaluated during clinical usage. Simultaneously use of three or more types of antiviral drugs is not recommended and relevant drug treatment should stop if unacceptable side effects or toxicity occur. 8.2.5. Antibacterial drug treatment: unselective or inappropriate use of antibiotics should be avoided, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics. \n\nAccording to the severity of respiratory distress and the progress of chest imaging, glucocorticoids can be used within a short period of time (3-5 days) as appropriate. Dose does not exceed the equivalent of 1-2pmg/(kg\u2022day) of methylprednisolone is recommended. It should be noted that higher doses of glucocorticoids would delay coronavirus clearance due to immunosuppressive effects; Xuebijing Injection (a traditional Chinese medicine) can be given intravenously 100 ml/day, twice a day for treatment; microecological preparation can be used to keep the equilibrium for intestinal microecology and prevent secondary bacterial infection; plasma exchange, adsorption, perfusion, hemofiltration/plasma filtration and other extracorporeal blood purification technologies should be considered if possible for critical cases with severe inflammatory reactions.\n\nAnxiety and fear usually occur in many patients, therefore psychological counseling should be strengthened.\n\nCOVID-19 can also be treated with traditional Chinese medicine, which considers it caused by epidemic pathogenic factors located in the lungs. Different regions can refer to the following schemes for dialectical treatment according to the disease condition, local climate characteristics, and different physical conditions. Use drugs under the guidance of doctors if the dose of drug exceeds the pharmacopoeia.
