The 34 pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV) (1-3), which was initially termed comprises of S1 and S2 subunits and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation. The S1 52 subunit, which contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) capable of functional folding 53 independently, is responsible for virus binding to the cell surface receptor.

The receptor-binding deem to trigger large conformational changes in the 57 S complex, which destabilize the prefusion trimer resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and 58 activate the fusogenic activity of the S2 subunit (9-11). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the sequence 59 structure of S2 contains an N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad 60 repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane region (TM), and cytoplasmic tail (CT). During the fusion 61 process, the FP is exposed and inserts into the target cell membrane, leading S2 in a 62 prehairpin intermediate that bridges the viral and cell membranes; then, three HR1 segments 63 self-assemble a trimeric coiled-coil and three HR2 segments fold into the grooves on the 64 surface of the HR1 inner core, thereby resulting a six-helical bundle (6-HB) structure that 65 drives the two membranes in close apposition for fusion. SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that different from that of SARS-CoV, the S protein of 80 SARS-CoV-2 has a high cell fusion activity; then, we designed and characterized several 86 In the earlier time point, we would like to experimentally verify whether SARS-CoV-2 uses 87 human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry, thus we generated its S protein pseudotyped 88 lentiviral particles. The SARS-CoV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) pseudoviruses 89 were also prepared for comparison. As shown in Fig. 2A , all of three pseudoviruses 90 efficiently infected 293T cells that stably overexpress ACE2 (293T/ACE2); however, the 91 infectivity SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV dramatically decreased in 239T cells which express 92 a low level of endogenous ACE2. As a virus control, VSV-G pesudovirus entered 239T cells 93 even more efficiently relative its infectivity in 293T/ACE2 cells. 94 We further compared the fusion activity of viral S protein in 293T and 293T/ACE2 cells 95 by applying a DSP-based cell-cell fusion assay. As shown in Fig. 2B , both the S proteins of 96 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV displayed a weak fusion activity in 293T cells, but they 97 showed significantly increased capacities to mediate cell fusion with 293T/ACE2 cells.

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a HR1 sequence with nine amino acid substitutions, and of 113 them eight are located within the HR1 core site; whereas, two viruses share a fully identical 114 HR2 sequence (Fig. 3A) . In order to explore the mechanism underlying the highly active 115 fusion activity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we synthesized two peptides corresponding to 116 the HR1 sequence and their secondary structures were determined by circular dichroism (CD) 117 spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3B , the HR1 peptide derived from SARS-CoV-2, designated 118 SARS2NP, showed a typical \u03b1-helical conformation with the helix contents of 66%, whereas 119 the HR1 peptide from SARS-CoV, designated SARS1NP, had \u03b1-helical contents of 41%.

As shown in Fig. 3C , SARS2NP 121 and SARS1NP exhibited their melting temperature (T m ) values of 48 and 40 o C, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, we synthesized a peptide containing the HR2 sequence, termed IPB01, and its 123 interactions with the two HR1 peptides were analyzed by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig.   124 3D and E, both the SARS2NP and SARS1NP interacted with IPB01 to form complexes with 125 typical \u03b1-helical structures, having the T m values of 75 and 68 o C, respectively. In comparison, 126 the complex formed by SARS2NP and IPB01 was much more stable than the complex 127 between the SARS1NP and IPB01 peptides. Taken together, these results suggested that 128 SARS-CoV-2 might evolve an increased interaction between the HR1 and HR2 domains in 129 the S2 fusion protein thus critically determining its high fusogenic activity. properties of the inhibitors in the absence or presence of a target mimic HR1 peptide. As 140 shown in Fig. 4A and 4B, the unconjugated IPB01 alone was largely in a random structure 141 and its T m value could not be defined. By contrast, the lipopeptide IPB02 displayed markedly 142 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Next, we assessed the helical binding stability of 143 the inhibitors with the two target mimic peptides, SARS2NP and SARS1NP. As shown in Fig 158 We next sought to determine the antiviral functions of the IPB01 and IPB02 peptides. Firstly, 159 their inhibitory activities on S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion were examined by the 160 DSP-based cell fusion assay as described above. As shown in Fig. 6A and Table 1 (Table 1) . As expected, IPB01 and IPB02 had no inhibitory activity against a 168 control virus (VSV-G), indicating their antiviral specificities. Therefore, we conclude that 169 IPB02 is a highly potent fusion inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Differently, IPB08 was a C-terminally truncated inhibitor with IPB02 as a template, but its 183 antiviral function was markedly impaired, underscoring the roles of C-terminal residues in 184 IPB02. On the basis of the results above, it was expected that IPB09 with two terminal 185 truncations was antivirally inactive. Indeed, the CD data suggested that both the N-and 186 author/funder.
