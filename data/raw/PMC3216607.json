{"title": "A novel synthesis and detection method for cap-associated adenosine modifications in mouse mRNA", "body": "We have previously used TLC assays to detect and quantify N6-methyladenosine (m6A)25, a modification found internally in the mRNA of many eukaryotes26272829. This method was modified to label and detect only the first nucleotide after the cap. In order to use this approach to compare the relative proportions of m6Am and Am in cap structures from different sources, it was first necessary to establish the mobility of m6Am in the TLC assay and to demonstrate that T4 polynucleotide kinase does not preferentially label either of these nucleotides. As neither m6Am triphosphate or m6Am phosphoramidite are commercially available, a novel method for its synthesis and incorporation into RNA oligonucleotides was developed.\n\nIn order to get quick access to the required m6Am phosphoramidite building block for solid-phase oligoribonucleotide synthesis, we performed a selective one-step methylation of the commercially available 2'-OMe-Bz-A-CE phosphoramidite. Due to its high reactivity and sensitivity towards acids and bases, Aritomo's relatively mild phase transfer catalysis (PTC) method was used30. Under these conditions (iodomethane, sodium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium bromide) the N6-methylated product was obtained as the major product in 56% yield, with the N1-methylated isomer being formed as a byproduct in 25% yield. Due to their different Rf values, the N6- and N1-methylated products were easily separated via column chromatography, and the purified m6Am phosphoramidite was used directly for RNA synthesis.\n\nAll oligoribonucleotides were synthesized using the standard protocol for solid-phase RNA synthesis with a 15 min coupling time per nucleotide. The last coupling step was followed by a standard DMTr-off procedure, the oligoribonucleotides were removed from the solid support, deprotected, precipitated and desalted. MALDI mass spectrometry was used to confirm the mass of all RNA oligonucleotides produced\n\nRadioactively 5' end labelled oligonucleotides SK-526 (m6AmGGGCUGCU) and SK-524 (AmGGGCUGCU) were digested to release pm6Am and pAm then mixed with a combination of 5' radioactive labelled pm6A and unmodified nucleotide monophosphates for which relative mobilities are well characterised. This mixture was separated by 2D TLC using the solvent systems previously described25 to establish the position of pm6Am (Fig. 2).\n\nTo show that T4 polynucleotide kinase does not preferentially label m6Am or Am, the RNA oligonucleotides SK-524 and SK-526 were mixed in different ratios, end labelled, digested with P1 nuclease and separated by TLC. The spots corresponding to pm6Am and pAm were then quantified using phosphorimaging. The results demonstrated that both nucleotides are labelled with equal efficiency by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fig. 3)\n\nTo label the first nucleotide following the m7G, poly(A) RNA was prepared from various mouse organs then digested with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the m7G cap. The exposed 5' ends were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase and after phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the mRNA transcripts were radiolabelled at their 5' end using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of >20 fold excess of [\u03b3-32P] ATP. The labelled RNA was digested to monophospho-nucleotides by P1 nuclease prior to TLC separation. Using this method, new spots corresponding to the 2'-O methylated nucleotides are apparent in the labelled samples after cap removal (Fig 4A). A spot corresponding to pm6Am is readily detectable in all mRNA samples tested, and with pm6Am:pAm ratios of between 15:1 (brain) and 2:1 (liver) it appears that m6Am is more prevalent at the cap1 than is Am (Fig. 4A). Under these labelling conditions, where both ATP and polynucleotide kinase are in excess, the intensity of the spots corresponding to the unmodified nucleotides, as well as the other 2' methylated nucleotides, is indicative of their actual relative abundance in the de-capped mRNA sample (Supplementary Figure S1 online).\n\nIn order to assay modifications on the first transcribed nucleotide for messages from individual genes, mRNA from liver and testis was de-capped and end-labelled as described above then fragmented to \u223c120 nt. This was then hybridised to single stranded DNA targets corresponding to the 5' region of selected messages. These DNA targets were first cross-linked to 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane. After hybridization and washing, the membrane was subjected to phosphorimaging (Fig. 4B). The individual teeth containing the labelled mRNA gene-specific fragments were then removed and digested to nucleotide 5' monophosphates using P1 nuclease. These samples were individually spotted onto TLC plates and developed as described (Fig. 4B). Four mRNAs were chosen for analysis, apolipoprotein A-I (Apoa1, BC012253), albumin (Alb, BC024643), protamine 2 (Prm2, BC049612) and poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1, BC046233). Alb and Apoa1 are predominantly liver expressed messages, whereas Prm2 shows testis specific expression and Pabpc1 is expressed highly in both organs. Pabpc1 may be subjected to translational regulation, but unlike Pabpc2, it is present in actively translating polyribosomes of mouse testicular cells31. For both Alb and Apoa1, the labelled nucleotide in the cap adjacent position included A, G, U and C, as well as m6Am and Am. This is consistent with multiple alternative transcription start sites at and around the Inr32. In both cases, Am and m6Am appeared as the major nucleotide modifications; unlike the mixed mRNA starting material, 2'-O-methylcytosine was not present (compare Fig. 4A, B). The m6Am:Am ratios were 1.65:1 and 1.4:1 for Apoa1 and Alb respectively, which is only slightly lower compared to that seen for the liver mRNA population as a whole. The Prm2 mRNAs from testis tissues almost exclusively had m6Am at the cap adjacent position (Fig. 4B). With an m6Am:Am ratio of 40:1, this was four times larger than the m6Am:Am ratio for the testis mRNA population as a whole. In contrast the cap adjacent nucleotides of Pabpc1 transcripts were predominantly unmodified, although a pronounced 2'-O-methyluridine was apparent in the sample from testis (Fig. 4B).\n\nCore promoters of Pol II transcribed genes may be focused, directing transcription initiation at a single site or cluster of adjacent sites, or they may be dispersed and have multiple start sites over a region of 50\u2013100 nucleotides6. In case of focused promoters the transcription start sites are contained within and around the Inr (YYANWYY), where the A is the principal start site and surrounding nucleotides are utilised to varying degrees6. Recent high-throughput sequencing from full length mRNAs, suggests that purine instead of A may be a better representation of the Inr consensus. However, most core promoters have several closely arrayed transcription start sites with different initiation rates rather than initiating at a single nucleotide32. Thus, most genes will give rise to a population of mRNAs that differ in their starting nucleotides. For example the Prm2 message initiates predominantly at the central A of the Inr as well as a second A 3 nucleotides upstream, whereas, Apoa1 strongly initiates at the A of the Inr but also uses surrounding U, G, C and sites at a significant level (Supplementary Figure S2 online) and (Fig. 4B).\n\nConversion of an adenosine following the m7G cap to Am (cap1) can be followed by further conversion to m6Am (Fig. 1a, and 1c). It is not known if this Am to m6Am conversion preferentially targets certain messages, or if the Am:m6Am ratio for messages from any one gene is merely a reflection of the general m6Am methylase activity of a particular cell type. The enzyme responsible for the formation of m6Am has been partially characterised5. It appears to be a cytosolic enzyme and is distinct from METTL3/MT-A70, the nuclear enzyme responsible for the formation of m6A at internal positions within mRNA33.\n\nWhilst there is evidence that cap1 methylation may increase translation efficiency1819, the consequences of converting a cap1 Am to m6Am are largely unknown. Some crystallographic observations suggest that the first nucleotide after the m7G may influence interaction with eIF4E or other cap binding proteins. Crystallographic analysis of eIF4E in a complex with the dinucleotide m7GpppG, show the G in a disordered arrangement34. However, with m7GpppA as substrate, the A interacts with a C-terminal loop of the protein35. A key interaction of this C-loop is a hydrogen bond between Thr205 and the amino group in the N6 position of the adenosine. It is this amino group that is targeted for methylation by the m6Am methylase. Thus, N6 methylation of a cap1 adenosine might influence the flexibility and orientation of the eIF4E C-terminal loop region. The ability to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides that containe m6Am in well-defined positions should facilitate future structure-function analysis. Therefore a direct synthetic method for the preparation of the desired m6Am phosphoramidite reagent, in a single step from commercially available starting material via direct N6-methylation, dramatically improves access to these materials for biological evaluation.\n\n5\u2032-(4,4\u2032-Dimethoxytrityl)-6-N-benzoyl-6-N-methyl-adenosine,2\u2032-O-methyl-3\u2032-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite (2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite) was prepared as follows: tetrabutylammonium bromide (260 mg, 807 \u03bcmol) and aq. NaOH (1M, 7 ml) were added to a stirring solution of 2'-OMe-Bz-A-CE phosphoramidite (Link Technologies, 708 mg, 797 \u03bcmol) and iodomethane (200 \u03bcl, 3.21 mmol) in dichloromethane (7 ml). After vigorous stirring for 30 min, ether and water were added and the resulting layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ether, the combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. 2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite was readily purified by column chromatography (1:1 petrol/ether\u21929:1 ether/methanol) affording 2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite (403 mg, 56%, white foam, 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers) and 2'-OMe-Bz-m1A-CE phosphoramidite (182 mg, 25%, white foam, 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers). Data for 2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite and for 2'-OMe-Bz-m1A-CE phosphoramidite are presented in Supplementary Table S1. online.\n\nOligoribonucleotides SK-524(AmGGGCUGCU) and SK-526(m6AmGGGCUGCU) were synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ultraflex III mass spectrometer via MALDI-TOF. Columns (SynBaseTM CPG 1000\u00c5, RNA: 0.2 \u00b5mol), apart from the 2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite, standard RNA-phosphoramidites and reagents for the synthesizer were purchased from Link Technologies Ltd., MeNH2 solution (33 wt.% in ethanol) was obtained from Fluka, NEt3\u00b73HF, N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (HPA) and DowexTM 50WX8-200 were purchased from Aldrich, illustra Nap\u2122-10 columns were obtained from GE Healthcare Europe GmbH. Dichloromethane and acetonitrile were freshly distilled from CaH2 before use on the synthesizer.\n\nThe RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using a standard 0.2 \u00b5M scale protocol, but with a 15 min coupling time for each nucleotide addition step. The polymer-bound oligoribonucleotide was transferred from the synthesis column to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and suspended in MeNH2 solution (1 ml). The mixture was heated to 65 \u00b0C for 10 min, cooled to room temperature (water/icebath) and centrifuged for 1 min (10,000 g). The supernatant was separated from the CPG beads, the beads were washed with RNase free water (2 \u00d7 0.25 ml), all supernatants were combined and dried (2 h under nitrogen stream, then freeze dried). The oligoribonucleotide was resuspended in anhydrous NEt3\u00b73HF/NEt3/NMP solution (250 \u00b5l of a solution of 1.5 ml NMP, 750 \u03bclNEt3 and 1.0 ml NEt3\u00b73HF), heated to 65 \u00b0C for 1.5 h, cooled to room temperature and quenched with 3M NaOAc solution (25 \u00b5l). n-BuOH (1 ml) was added to the mixture, which was then thoroughly mixed, cooled to \u221270 \u00b0C for 1 \u2013 2 h to encourage further precipitation and centrifuged for 30 min (4 \u00b0C, 13 000 g). The supernatant was removed, the pellet washed with 70% EtOH (2 \u00d7 500 \u00b5l) and then dried in vacuo (30 min). The dry precipitate was dissolved in RNase free water (1 ml) and desalted using a Nap\u2122-10 column following the standard protocol. The resulting solution was freeze dried over night leaving the oligoribonucleotide as a white foam/powder. Samples for MALDI-mass spectrometry were prepared as follows36: Dowex\u2122 ion-exchange beads were rigorously cleaned with dilute HCl, washed with water, then treated with dilute NH3 and finally washed with water again to generate Dowex-NH4+. Diammonium citrate (DAC) (100 mg) was dissolved in water (1 ml) and HPA (34.8 mg) was dissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile/water (1 ml). The HPA solution was filtered through Dowex-NH4+ and the DAC solution (100 \u00b5l) was added to prepare the matrix stock. Prior to MALDI-MS acquisition, matrix stock (20 \u00b5l) was mixed with Dowex-NH4+ (5 \u00b5l) and each oligoribonucleotide sample (1 \u00b5l) was mixed with Dowex-NH4+ (19 \u00b5l). After 30 min the matrix, and after drying, the sample solution (0.5\u00b5l) were spotted onto the sample well and allowed to dry prior to confirmatory analysis by MALDI-MS.\n\nTotal RNA was prepared from mouse (C57BL/6) tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The poly(A) RNA was purified twice using oligo(dT) cellulose (Fluka) followed by oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen). All samples were quantified and assayed for poly(A) purity using an Agilent Bioanalyser.\n\nRegions corresponding to the first 300 to 500 nucleotides of the target messages were PCR amplified from cDNAs using the following oligonucleotides:\n\nApoa1forward GCTCCGGGGAGGTCACCCACACCT and\n\nApoa1reverse CAATGGGCCCAGCCGTTCCTGCAGC;\n\nAlbforward CCCCACTAGCCTCTGGCAAAATGAAGTG and\n\nAlbreverse GGCTGGGGTTGTCATCTTTGTGTTGCAG;\n\nPrm2forward GCTGGGTGTGCGCGAGTCAGGGGCTC and\n\nPrm2reverse CTTGTGGATCCTATGTAGCCTCTTACG;\n\nPabpc1forward CGGCGGTTAGTGCTGAGAGTGCGGAG and Pabpc1reverse GAAGTTCACGTACGCGTAGCCCAAGG. Prior to amplification, the forward oligonucleotides were 5' phosphorylated, the amplification products were subsequently digested with lambda nuclease (New England BioLabs) to leave the single stranded antisense DNA strand. 100 ng of this ssDNA (2 \u00b5l) was spotted onto 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane ( Amersham) (Fig. 2B,C), and UV cross-linked (Stratalinker). Membranes were prehybridised at 42 \u00b0C in 40 % formamide with 5 \u00d7 Denhardt's, 3 % SDS, 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.1 mg ml\u22121 sonicated salmon sperm DNA.\n\n600 ng of poly(A) RNA was digested with 20 units of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (Epicentre) for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. The 5' phosphate of the exposed cap adjacent nucleotide was removed by the addition of 10 units of Alkaline Phosphatase (Fermentas) and incubation for a further 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA samples were resuspended in 20 \u00b5l of sterile distilled water and 5' ends were labelled using 30 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, Fermentas) and 7.4 MBq [\u03b3-32P] ATP at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. The PNK was heat inactivated (70 \u00b0C for 15 min) and the reaction made up to 60 \u00b5l with sterile distilled water then passed through a P-30 spin column (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated isotope. A 1 \u00b5l aliquot was taken, added to 9 \u03bcl of nuclease P1 buffer and digested with P1 (Sigma) for one hour at 37 \u00b0C. 1.5 \u03bcl of the released 5' monophosphates from this digest was then analysed by 2D TLC as described previously25. The remaining end labelled RNA was fragmented to lengths of approximately 120 nt by the addition of Na2CO3 to a final concentration of 60 mM and NaHCO3 to a final concentration of 40 mM followed by incubation for one hour at 60 \u00b0C.12 \u00b5l 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 was then added and the RNA precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 200 \u00b5l of pre-hybridisation buffer then added to the membranes (final volume 2 ml) and hybridised overnight at 42 \u00b0C. Membrane washings were carried out with 2 \u00d7, 1 \u00d7 and 0.2 \u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS. Two final washes were carried out at 60 \u00b0C, with 0.2 \u00d7 SSC but with the SDS omitted. Hybridised membranes were exposed to storage phosphor screens (K-screen; KODAK) and imaged using Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX in combination with Quantity One 4.6.3 software (Bio-Rad). Individual teeth containing the target mRNAs end labelled at the cap adjacent position were cut off and digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) in a final volume of 3 \u00b5l. All of this digestion mix was applied to a cellulose coated TLC plate (20 \u00d7 20 cm, MERCK) and developed as described previously25.\n\nSK and CH developed and carried out the novel chemical synthesis of phosphoramidites.
