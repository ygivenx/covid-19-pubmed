{"title": "Epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia in Beijing, China", "body": "Before 2002, 4 kinds of coronaviruses (CoVs, namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) were known to infect humans, causing 10%-30% mild upper respiratory infection in adults, occasionally severe pneumonia in elders, infants, and immunodeficient persons. 1 Epidemiologic data indicated clear evidence of person-to-person transmission, and the transmission led to nosocomial infection. [5] [6] [7] The case number increased quickly in Wuhan and posed a large casualty. Up to February 24, 2020, a total of 46607 confirmed cases had been identified in Wuhan, with an estimated case fatality of 4.26% (1987 deaths). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other parts of Hubei province, other parts of China, and 29 countries, resulting in 17680 cases and 508 deaths (estimated fatality: 2.87%), 12975 cases and 100 deaths (0.77%), and 2105 cases and 24 deaths (1.14%), respectively (up to February 24, 2020). The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is higher and the fatality is lower compared to SARS-CoV, although the two CoVs share the receptor-human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). [8] [9] [10] The etiological, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan have been investigated since the disease outbreak. 3, [5] [6] [7] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The occurrences of COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan were reported.

As COVID-19 is being rapidly exported to a growing number of countries, its epidemiological and clinical features outside the outbreak zone are important for the development of prophylactic options.\n\nCurrently, COVID-19 cases reported are all patients with pneumonia, rather than those without pneumonia. Furthermore, the disease course of COVID-19, the duration of viral existence, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers remain unknown. Here, we report a series of COVID-19 cases admitted into an infectious disease hospital that is responsible for quarantine and treatment of COVID-19 assigned by the government in Beijing, China. .

Extremely severe type met one of the following criteria: respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation, shock, and combined organ failure that need to be treated in intensive care unit.\n\nPatients were discharged from hospital if they met the criteria: temperature normalized for at least 3 days, apparent improvement in respiratory symptoms, absorption of lung inflammation, and negative SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA tested for twice at 1 day interval. The final date of follow-up was February 18, 2020.\n\nCategorical variables were compared using the \u03c7 2 test or the Fisher exact test.\n\nContinuous variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range .

Stepwise backward multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine factors independently predicting the progression of COVID-19. Differences in the daily medians of laboratory parameters between patients with and without pneumonia in the 20 consecutive days were evaluated using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Above statistical analyses were two-sided and performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 21.0 software. The dynamic diagrams and the trend of each laboratory parameter fitted by local polynomial regression (LOESS) were generated by R software (version 3.6.2). A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\nA total of 55 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Of those, 31 (56.4%) ever traveled to Wuhan or came from Wuhan within 14 days before the onset (direct exposure) and 19 (34.5%) had an indirect exposure history within 14 days before illness onset. Of the 19 cases, 14 ever hosted their sick relatives from Wuhan, 2 ate with late-diagnosed friends from Wuhan, 2 shared a railway carriage with a COVID-19 patient, and 1 attended a meeting with a late-diagnosed colleague. Confirmed case had been increasing since January 10, reached the peak on January 22, 2020, and then declined gradually. Ten days after the Wuhan quarantine on January 23, 2020, the curve touched the bottom (Figure 1 ).\n\nIncubation period was calculated using the data of 31 cases with clear cutting time points of exposure and illness onset. The mean incubation period of COVID-19 was .

The mean incubation was 9.06 (95% CI, 6.11-12.00) days for patients without pneumonia and 7.54 (95% CI, 5.29-9.79) days for patients with pneumonia.\n\nOf the 55 patients, 32 had regular SARS-CoV-2 examination data. Of the 32 patients, one co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and three cases whose samples were intermittently positive were excluded.\n\nThe mean (95% CI) SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from the first SARS-CoV-2-positive test to RT-PCR conversion in the remaining 28 cases was 9.71 (8.21-11.22) days. This duration was 9.24 (7.10-11.37) days for COVID-19 patients without pneumonia (n=17) and 10.45 (8.10-12.81) days for those with pneumonia (n=11).\n\nOf the 5 remaining cases without an approved exposure history, 2 had unusual exposure. Patient A, who was long-term bed-ridden, was infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nShe contacted only 4 healthy family members within 2 weeks before illness onset.\n\nThe members did not have direct or indirect exposure history. She was shortly carried into the Emergency Department of a nearby hospital to replace her gastric tube and highly suspected to be infected there. Patient B, she and her family members did not have any exposure history within past a month. Her sister and sister's husband from Wuhan visited her family and lived in the same building in a remote suburb of Beijing.\n\nSix days later, she became ill and was finally diagnosed as COVID-19. During the entire course, her sister' family members were not ill or even discomfort, indicating that asymptomatic carriers transmit SARS-CoV-2.\n\nClinical and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia at the admission .

Common, severe, and extremely severe types were combined as COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, having a fever, and cough (Table 1) . Compared with COVID-19 patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia had higher levels of interleukin-6, B lymphocyte proportion, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and very low count (<190/\u00b5L) of CD8 + T cells (Table 2) .\n\nOf the 55 patients, 52 received antiviral treatment, mostly with lopinavir/ritonavir and or arbidol. The mean duration from onset to admission was 5 (Table 3) .\n\nWe then evaluated the dynamics of clinical and laboratory parameters during hospital stay between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without pneumonia and re-categorized the patient with progressive disease. Of the parameters evaluated, 6\n\nshowed different trends between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia (P<0.001 for each, GEE). The daily medians of neutrophil proportions and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were higher in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients, which were quite in contrast to lymphocyte proportion, T lymphocyte count, CD4 + T lymphocyte count, and CD8 + T lymphocyte count. At the 20 th day after illness onset, the dynamic curves of neutrophil proportion, NLR, lymphocyte proportion, and CD4 + T lymphocyte count tended to meet (P>0.05), except those of CD8 + T lymphocytes and T lymphocyte counts (P<0.05) (Figure 2 ).\n\nThe epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in Beijing might represent the features of COVID-19 outside the outbreak zone. Most patients had clear exposure .

A previous study carried out in Wuhan indicated that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days. 5 Early patients identified in the outbreak zone were mostly with severe pneumonia and might be exposed to higher viral concentration in closed spaces like the affected hospitals. Furthermore, it is hard to identify the exact time of exposure in the outbreak zone. Thus, the incubation from this study should be important in quarantining close contactors outside the outbreak zone.\n\nThe durations of COVID-19 course and SARS-CoV-2-positive course are not reported previously. We determined that the mean duration from onset to discharge was 18.57 days. According to the discharge criteria, COVID-19 course is approximately 2 weeks, which is quite in consistent with SARS. 21 The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration .

SARS-CoV-2 might be present in patients for around 18 days by adding the mean incubation of 8.42 days.\n\nThis duration seems to be shorter than SARS. 22 To our knowledge, this was the first study to characterize the differences in the clinical features and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia. Unlike those without pneumonia, one-third of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia had very low account (<190/\u00b5L) of CD8 + T cells. In addition, serum level of IL-6 was higher in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (Table 2 ). These data suggest that CD8 + T cell exhaustion and IL-6-based inflammation might play an important role in the development of COVID-19.\n\nIt is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to have poor outcomes so that prevention and treatment efforts can be focused. 24 Here, we reported that serum IL-6 and lactate at the admission independently predicted poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients, after the adjustment with other significant factors in the univariate Cox analysis (Table 3) . IL-6 is capable of inhibiting the T cell-mediated immunity, and high level of IL-6 in the acute stage is associated with lung lesions in SARS patients. 25 Lactate is a natural by-product of aerobic glycolysis. Efferocytosis can promote glucose uptake and lactate release. 26 Lactate promotes the switch of CD4 + T cells to an IL-17 + subset and impairs the cytolytic capacity of CD8 + T cells. 27 Thus, IL-6 might bridge SARS-CoV-2 infection and alveolar cell injury via inducing .

The inflammation increases efferocytosis-mediated aerobic glycolysis, facilitating the release of lactate. Increased lactate in turn impairs the CD8 + T cell-mediated antiviral immunity.\n\nFor the first time, the dynamic changes of laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia were evaluated during hospital stay. Neutrophil proportion and NLRs were higher in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients, indicating systemic inflammation is apparent. Lymphocyte proportion and CD4 + T lymphocyte counts were lower in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free, and the two curves met at the 20th day, indicating B cells might recover rapidly.\n\nSurprisingly, the lower levels of CD8 + cells in pneumonia patients did not increase at the 20th day (Figure 2) , indicating that recovery of CD8 + T cell-mediated immunity needs a longer time. Thus, the discharged patients might be susceptible to infections and other diseases. The recovery of T cell count should be monitored.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, the effect of antiviral treatment was not evaluated due to lack of controls. Second, the family members of patient B's sister were not examined for SARS-CoV-2, because they left when we performed this study.\n\nThird, half patients are still hospitalized. The disease course of severe patients might be prolonged by therapeutic regimens including corticosteroids. 28 Finally, we characterized the epidemiological features including the incubation period, time to RT-PCR conversion of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 course, and the transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers. Old age, hypertension, interleukin-6, and CD8 + T cell exhaustion were significantly associated with the development of pneumonia. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression. CD8 + T cell exhaustion might be important in .
