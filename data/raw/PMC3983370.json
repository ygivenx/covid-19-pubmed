{"title": "Structural Basis for the Identification\nof the N-Terminal\nDomain of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein as an Antiviral Target", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs)\nare a large group of RNA viruses with single-stranded\nRNA genomes that cause various upper and lower respiratory tract infections\nin both humans and animals.1,2 The human coronavirus\nstrains OC43 and 229E (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E) were identified in\nthe 1960s.3 Between 2003 and 2004, the\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a\nworldwide epidemic and had a significant economic impact in the countries\naffected by the outbreak.4 In 2004, another\nalphacoronavirus (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old child\nin the Netherlands suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis.5 In 2005, Woo et al. discovered the novel betacoronavirus\nHKU1 in patients with respiratory tract infections.6 Recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV) was found in patients with severe acute respiratory tract\ninfections in the Middle East. As is true for all coronavirus infections,\nthere is no currently available efficacious therapy.\n\nThe CoVs\nhave several conserved structural proteins: the matrix\n(M), the small envelope (E) proteins, the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins,\nand the nucleocapsid (N) proteins.7 Some\nvariants have a third glycoprotein, HE (hemagglutinin esterase), which\nis present in most betacoronaviruses.8,9 The N protein\nis a major structural CoV protein that serves multiple purposes, such\nas packaging the RNA genome into helical ribonucleoproteins, modulating\nhost cell metabolism, and regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication\nand transcription.10,11 The N protein binds to the viral\nRNA genome, forming a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein\n(RNP) complex.12 In situ cross-linking\nand immunological experiments revealed that the RNP formation is critical\nfor maintaining an ordered RNA conformation suitable for replicating\nand transcribing the viral genome.10,13 Other studies\nimplicate the N protein in the regulation of cellular processes, including\nactin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis.14\u221216 The N protein is capable of inducing protective immune responses\nagainst CoV and is a key antigen for developing a sensitive diagnostic\nassay.17\n\nCoronavirus N proteins contain\nthree domains: an N-terminal RNA-binding\ndomain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and a poorly\nstructured central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies have\nrevealed that the N- and C-terminal domains of the CoV N proteins\nare responsible for RNA binding and oligomerization, respectively.18\u221220 The central region of the N protein has also been shown to contain\nan RNA-binding region and primary phosphorylation sites.21,22 The crystal structures of several CoV N-NTDs, including those encoded\nby SARS,23 infectious bronchitis virus\n(IBV),24,25 HCoV-OC43,20 and\nmouse hepatitis virus (MHV)26 have been\nsolved. Additionally, several critical residues have been identified\nfor RNA binding and virus infectivity in the N-terminal domain of\ncoronaviral N proteins.23,26\u221228 However, the structural and mechanistic basis for RNA binding and\nRNP formation remains largely unknown. Understanding these aspects\nshould facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block\nthe formation of RNP during CoV genome replication. We report the\ncrystal structures of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with ribonucleoside\n5\u2032-monophosphates as a model for understanding the molecular\ninteractions that govern CoV N-NTD binding to RNA. We also describe\nthe structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with a new N protein inhibitor, N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)(N,N-dimethylamino)acetamide hydrochloride (PJ34),\nand demonstrate the ability of PJ34 to interfere with both the RNA-binding\nactivity of the N protein and virus replication. Our findings will\naid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N proteins\nand viral replication in HCoVs.\n\nWe were unable to find any\nprevious reports describing the atomic\nstructure of CoV N protein\u2013RNA complexes. To begin to elucidate\nhow RNA and the N protein interact, we determined the crystal structure\nof HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with AMP. The complete statistics for\nthe data collection and refinement of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with\nAMP are summarized in Table 1. The complex\ncontained one ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate-binding site\nalongside two \u03b2 strands (\u03b22 and \u03b23) (Figure 1A). As with apo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\ncomplexes all contain a core located within amino acids 105\u2013120\nthat comprises five \u03b2 strands, one \u03b1 helix, and a disordered\nloop that extends away from the core. The flexible loop region lies\nbetween \u03b22 and \u03b23 (residues 115\u2013117) and exhibits\na low electron density in the initial 2Fo\u2013Fc map. The AMP base was inserted\ninto a hole in the N-NTD that was almost perpendicular to the phosphate\nmoiety (Figure 1B,C). The phosphate group was\nbound to a basic and conserved 5\u2032-phosphate-binding site that\ncontained the largest positively charged region on the N-NTD surface.\nThe HCoV-OC43 N-NTD has the same folding pattern as is found in the\nSARS-CoV, IBV, and MHV N-NTD;20 however,\nthe positions of the secondary structural elements and loops vary\nbetween the species.\n\nAMP binding to the N-NTD is clearly\nunambiguously defined in the\nresulting electron density maps provided in Figure 2A. AMP shows a temperature factor of about 20 \u00c52, compared with an average overall temperature factor of around 35\n\u00c52. Figure 2B reveals the detailed\ninteractions between the AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD. The amino acid composition\nof this binding site includes Ser 64, Gly 68, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr\n126, and Arg 164. The positively charged group in the Arg 122 side\nchain provides an ionic interaction with the AMP monophosphate with\na distance of 3.8 \u00c5, whereas the Gly 68 backbone forms hydrogen\nbonds with the monophosphate group in the AMP with a distance of 2.4\n\u00c5. Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of the\nSer 64 backbone form hydrogen bonds with the ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl\nsubstituents and N7 of the base with distances of 3.0 and 2.7 \u00c5,\nrespectively. Tyr 124 is located on the surface of the N protein in\nthe HCoV-OC43 N-NTD and is directly involved in the interactions with\nthe AMP base through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking. The phenolic\nhydroxyl group substituent on Tyr 126 forms hydrogen bonds with the\nsixth amino groups present in the AMP adenine ring with a distance\nof 3.1 \u00c5. Hydrogen bonds also form between the 2\u2032-hydroxyl\ngroup of the AMP ribose and the Arg 164 side chain. The Arg 122, Tyr\n124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 side chains generate a distinct ribonucleotide-binding\npocket and interact with the ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate\nvia hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking\nforces (Figure 2C). These amino acids are sequentially\nand structurally conserved in other HCoV N proteins (Figure S2, Supporting Information); therefore, they are\nlikely essential for RNA recognition and interaction in all coronavirus\nN proteins. In addition, the structure of the N-NTD in the AMP co-complex\nis essentially identical to the previously published structure of\napo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value\nof 0.19 \u00c5 (123 equivalent C\u03b1 atoms) (Figure 2D). Only the phenyl group of F57 is displaced backward by\n1 \u00c5 to prevent steric hindrance at the AMP entrance. We solved\nthe structures of three additional HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes (cytosine\nmonophosphate (CMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and uridine monophosphate\n(UMP)), all featured protein\u2013RNA interactions similar to the\ninteraction of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013AMP complex. See Figure\nS3 in the Supporting Information. A comparison\nof the amino acid composition of ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate-binding\nsites in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes (Figure S3D) shows that amino\nacid residues Ser 64, Phe 66, Gly 68, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and\nArg 164 are interactive in more than two HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complex structures,\nindicating their importance in RNA binding. Compared to AMP, the higher B-factors of CMP, GMP, and UMP indicate the ligand for CMP,\nGMP, and UMP is quite flexible in the ribonucleotide-binding pocket\nof HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Table 1; Table S1, Supporting Information). On the basis of the\nelectron density maps of similar resolution data, it appeared that\nthe structure of the AMP complex showed better defined electron density\nfor all components of the nucleotide (Figure 2A). These results suggest that this pocket is probably specific for\nAMP. More studies are needed to prove this in the future.\n\nWe replaced amino acid residues Arg 122, Tyr 124,\nTyr 126, and Arg 164 with alanine and used surface plasmon resonance\n(SPR) analysis to determine their interactions in the binding between\nthe full-length HCoV-OC43 NPs and RNA. Depending on the virus strain,\nthere are two to four UCUAA pentanucleotide repeats, with the last\nrepeat being UCUAAAC and termed the intergenic (IG) sequence at the\n3\u2032 end of the leader.29,30 Previous studies showed\nthat HCoV N protein has high affinity for the intergenic sequence.11,31 Therefore, the repeated intergenic sequence of HCoV-OC43, 5\u2032-bio(UCUAAAC)4-3\u2032, was used as a probe in our SPR experiments. The\nassociation constants, Kd (kd/ka), for the various HCoV-OC43\nN protein and RNA complexes were obtained from kinetic analyses of\nSPR experiments (Table 2). The dissociation\nconstants for RNA binding to R122A, Y124A, Y126A, and R164A range\nfrom 3.83 \u00d7 10\u20138 to 8.13 \u00d7 10\u20138 M and are much larger than those for the wild type (WT). Thus, we\nidentified several amino acids in the HCoV-OC43 N protein that are\nimportant for RNA binding, especially R122, Y124, and R164. Previously,\nKeane et al. reported that R127 and Y127 in MHV, which correspond\nto R122 and Y124 in HCoV-OC43, play key roles in RNA binding.23,26,27 In addition, the alanine substitution\nof Y94 in the NTD of the IBV N protein, which corresponds to Y126\nin HCoV-OC43, led to a significant decrease in its RNA-binding affinity.\nThese results are consistent with our observations.\n\nSince R122A,\nY124A, and R164A mutants have significant effects\non the RNA-binding activity of the N protein, we monitored levels\nof viral RNA encoding the M protein to determine the effects of R122A,\nY124A, and R164A mutants on the viral replication. Because all OC43\ngenes are transcribed concordantly throughout HCoV-OC43 infection,\nlevels of the M protein gene should reflect virus replication. Therefore,\n293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant N protein\nand its WT counterpart followed by infection with HCoV-OC43. As shown\nin Figure S4 (Supporting Information),\nin cells transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant N protein and\ninfected with virus, levels of M RNA were significantly decreased\ncompared to those detected in cells transfected with plasmids encoding\nthe WT N protein. These results support the notion that these amino\nacids of HCoV-OC43 are important for RNA-binding affinity.\n\nNext, a virtual screening was performed,\ntargeting the AMP-binding site of N-NTD. Potential hits with high\ndocking scores (87 compounds) (Table S2, Supporting\nInformation) were further analyzed on the basis of these docking\nresults. We found that nine of the potential hits showed interaction\ncharacteristics reminiscent of those between AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\n(Table S3, Supporting Information). First,\nthey all contain an aromatic core able to stack onto Y124 of the N-NTD.\nSecond, the aromatic core contains hydrogen-bond-forming moieties\nto mediate the specific interactions with the N-NTD. Third, the aromatic\ncore contains an attached branching moiety (or moieties) to fit into\nthe ribonucleotide-binding pocket. More importantly, among the 87\npotential hits, these 9 compounds were readily available commercially.\nWe further studied the effects of the nine compounds on the RNA-binding\ncapacity of N protein by SPR experiments. Two compounds, O3 and PJ34,\ndecreased the RNA-binding capacity of N protein by more than 10% (Table\nS3). Because PJ34 and O3 were predicted to bind to the N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding\npocket, we next studied PJ34 and O3 in virus replication assays. To\nenhance virus replication, we transfected N cDNA into cells prior\nto infection because previous results showed that increased N protein\nexpression enhanced replication.20 In general,\na 10 \u03bcM concentration of each candidate compound was used in\nsubsequent assays. If the candidate compound at this concentration\nwas effective, we considered the compound worthy of continued development.\nWe monitored M mRNA levels in infected 293T cells in the presence\nof PJ34 and O3 at 10 \u03bcM both with and without exogenous N protein\nexpression. Because the M gene is transcribed throughout the HCoV-OC43\ninfection, M mRNA levels should reflect viral replication. As predicted\nfrom previous studies, M mRNA levels were increased 7-fold in infected\ncells transfected with plasmid that encodes the WT N protein compared\nto those that did not receive transfected N cDNA (2.41 and 0.32 in\nthe presence and absence of N protein expression, respectively) (Figure 3A,B). In the PJ34-treated cells, M mRNA levels were\n0.65 and 0.11 in the presence and absence of N protein expression,\nrespectively, while in the O3-treated cells, corresponding M mRNA\nlevels were 2.46 and 0.22. Thus, M mRNA levels were reduced both in\nthe presence and in the absence of N protein expression after treatment\nwith PJ34 at 10 \u03bcM (Figure 3A,B), whereas\nO3 treatment was not effective. PJ34 has been shown to have therapeutic\nefficacy in several noninfectious conditions. In one instance, PJ34\ntreatment reduced central nervous system inflammation and maintained\nneurovascular integrity in mice during the onset of experimental allergic\nencephalomyelitis.32 This compound also\nexhibited neuroprotective effects in both in vivo and in vitro stroke\nmodels.33 To determine whether PJ34 hindered\nthe HCoV-OC43 replication by interfering with the binding of the N\nprotein to RNA, we used SPR to determine the effect of compound PJ34\non the RNA-binding affinity toward HCoV-OC43 N protein. In the presence\nof PJ34 under saturation conditions, RNA affinity for HCoV-OC43 NP\ndecreased with decreasing resonance unit (RU) values for PJ34 (Figure 3C). The HCoV-OC43 N protein exhibited weaker RNA\nbinding in the presence of PJ34 with a 5-fold increase in the dissociation\nconstant (Figure 3D). Therefore, PJ34 antagonizes\nthe binding activity between HCoV-OC43 N protein and RNA. Consequently,\nthe data indicate that PJ34 interacts with the HCoV-OC43 N protein,\ndecreasing RNA binding and subsequently decreasing viral replication.\n\nTo determine the mechanism of PJ34 (Figure 4A) binding to the HCoV-OC43 N protein, N-NTD crystals were soaked\nin PJ34 under the conditions described in the Experimental\nSection. We used molecular replacement to resolve the HCoV-OC43\nN-NTD\u2013PJ34 complex structure at a 2.65 \u00c5 resolution and\nrefined this model to an Rwork:Rfree ratio of 18%:22% (Table 1). The complex revealed additional unbiased density around\nthe ribonucleotide-binding pocket of the N-NTD, suggesting that the\naffinity of N-NTD for PJ34 was sufficiently high to inhibit the RNA-binding\naffinity of N protein (Figure 4B). As with\nthe HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013AMP complex, one PJ34-binding site was\nnoted near the \u03b22 and \u03b23 strands (Figure 4C). The complex adopted a U-shaped \u03b2 platform that contained\nfive \u03b2 strands across the structure and resembled the N protein\nNTDs in other CoVs.23\u221226 On the basis of the surface charge distribution, the polycyclic\nring of PJ34 intercalates into the N-NTD hole parallel to the long\naxis of the protein structure (Figure 4D).\n\nParts A and B of Figure 5 reveal the detailed\ninteractions with PJ34. The amino acid composition of this binding\nsite includes Ser 64, Phe 66, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and His 104. The NH\nfunctionalities from the backbone amide groups on Ser 64 are 3.3 \u00c5\nfrom the carbonyl group on the PJ34 6-phenanthridinone ring, indicating\nthat a hydrogen bond may form between Ser 64 and PJ34. Hydrogen bonds\nalso form between the 6-phenanthridinone ring and the backbone carbonyl\ngroup of Phe 66 via water molecules. The nitrogen atom in the PJ34\n6-phenanthridinone ring also forms a single hydrogen bond with the\nTyr 126 side chain of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with a distance of 2.9 \u00c5.\nThe aromatic ring on the PJ34 6-phenanthridinone participates in stacking\ninteractions with the His 104 and Tyr 124 side chains. A comparison\nbetween the N-NTD in both its native and PJ34-complexed forms generated\na low RMSD of 0.20 \u00c5, indicating that binding with PJ34 requires\nno significant conformational change in the N-NTD (Figure 5C). The key PJ34-interactive residues of the native\nand complexed forms superimpose well; however, the phenyl group on\nthe Phe 57 side chain in the N-NTD\u2013PJ34 complex rotates over\n90\u00b0, and the imidazole side group of His 104 moves back 0.8 \u00c5\nto avoid steric hindrances and to accommodate PJ34.\n\nComparison of the PJ34- and AMP-bound HCoV-OC43\nN-NTD crystal structures demonstrates that PJ34 and AMP target the\nsame pocket within HCoV-OC43 N-NTD. Although the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013PJ34\nand HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013AMP crystal structures superimpose with\na low RMSD of 0.21 \u00c5, the PJ34-binding orientation differs from\nthat of AMP. PJ34 binds more closely to the N-terminus loop of the\nHCoV-OC43 N-NTD than does AMP, with the Phe 57 side chain rotating\n90\u00b0 counterclockwise upon PJ34 binding, compared to that of the\nAMP-bound HCoV-OC43 N-NTD. The branch moiety of PJ34 inserts into\nan interior core of N-NTD that is opposite the ribose moiety of AMP\ncoming from the inside out. PJ34 also lacks a phosphate group and\nfails to match AMP\u2019s interactions with the positively charged\nArg 122 (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Nevertheless, several of the examined interactions between the\nN-NTD and PJ34 were similar to those between N-NTD and AMP, particularly\nthose with Ser 64, Tyr 124, and Tyr 126 (Figures 2C and 5B).\n\nThe\nN protein is the most abundant viral polypeptide in CoV-infected\ncells and is responsible for recognizing RNA and forming a filamentous\nnucleocapsid.18 Because CoVs are significant\nthreats to both humans and domestic animals, understanding the molecular\nmechanisms governing RNP formation may facilitate better management\nof CoV infections. Previous X-ray analysis revealed that the folding\nof the N protein\u2019s N-terminal domain is essentially conserved\nacross various CoV strains20,24,26,34 with a right-handed fist-shaped\nstructure in which the palm and finger are rich in basic residues,\nwhile the flexible loops remain ordered around the \u03b2-sheet core\nof the NTD, possibly providing a scaffold for RNA binding. X-ray diffraction\nanalyses of RNA-binding proteins complexed with ribonucleoside monophosphate\nhave been used in several studies to identify the unique ribonucleotide-binding\nsite in the RNA-binding domain.35,36 Here, we report an\nN-NTD\u2013ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate complex crystal\nstructure that comprises a pocket for accommodation of ribonucleotide\nbinding. On the basis of the structures of the N-NTD\u2013ribonucleotide\ncomplex, two tyrosine residues on HCoV-OC43 NTD (Tyr 124 and Tyr 126)\nwere found to interact with RNA bases via stacking and hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions, respectively. Similar interactions were observed in\ncomplexes between vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein and RNA.37 In addition, two arginine residues of HCoV-OC43\nNTD, Arg 122 and Arg 164, interact with the phosphate group and ribose\nthough ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, respectively. These\nfour residues were conserved in other HCoVs as well, and the results\nsuggest that the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of the HCoV N-NTD exists\namong different CoVs (Figure S6, Supporting Information). No structural data are available regarding CoV N protein binding\nto single-stranded RNA. To understand the structural interactions\nresponsible for the RNA recognition by HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, we modeled\nthe structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD in an RNA-bound state using the crystal\nstructure of the N-NTD\u2013AMP complex as a template (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Previous studies indicated\nthat the positively charged amino acid, Arg 106, located at the cleft\nin the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD structure, is conserved in all CoV N proteins\nand interacts nonspecifically with the RNA phosphate backbone.20 This model indicates that the RNA-binding region\nof the N-NTD contains Arg 106, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg\n164 and expands from the \u03b2-sheet core to the exterior loop region.\nA previous study showed that other conserved positively charged residues\nin the positively charged loop of HCoV-OC43 N protein, including R107,\nK110, and R117, were also involved in RNA binding.20\n\nCurrent antiviral drugs developed to treat CoV infections\nprimarily\ntarget the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases.38 However, antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically\nact on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity\nand severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are\nneeded to combat acute respiratory infections caused by CoV. The CoV\nnucleocapsid protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that\nis necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication. Recent studies\nsuggest that N proteins in infections caused by coronaviruses and\nother viruses will be useful antiviral drug targets because they serve\nmany critical functions during the viral life cycle. Two strategies\nto inhibit oligomeric N protein function have been reported.39 The first strategy is to impair normal N protein\nfunction by interfering with monomer\u2013oligomer equilibrium through\neither enhancement or inhibition of its oligomerization. The second\none is to target the RNA-binding site, which contains a number of\nconserved residues. In one study, nuclozin analogues were shown to\ninhibit influenza A virus replication by preventing RNP formation\nduring viral particle production.40 Lo\net al. identified an antiviral peptide that interferes with the CTD\noligomerization of the HCoV N protein and inhibits HCoV.19 The results presented herein provide a detailed,\nhigh-resolution picture of the ribonucleotide monophosphate bound\nto the CoV N-NTD and identify a unique ribonucleotide-binding pocket\nin the center of the CoV N-NTD. Mutation of RNA-binding residues in\nthe NTD of the coronaviral N protein led to a significant decrease\nin its RNA-binding affinity and subsequent decrease in viral replication.\nTherefore, the N-terminal RNA-binding domain of coronaviral N protein\nwould be a validated target for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs through\ninterference with the RNA-binding activity of the N protein. Compounds\nbinding to this site that act as competitive N protein inhibitors\nmay be employed to combat highly pathogenic CoVs. PJ34 has been reported\nto protect mice against brain ischemia, splanchnic ischemia, reperfusion,\nand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity, in addition to various models\nof local inflammation.41 We also found\nthat the cell viability was not affected by treatment with PJ34 alone\nup to 20 \u03bcM for 24 h in cell lines. Therefore, the efficacy\nof PJ34 is relatively diverse while its safety is high, making PJ34\nan ideal new candidate for antiviral therapy. We found that PJ34 at\n10 \u03bcM inhibits coronavirus replication and potently interferes\nwith the RNA-binding activity of HCoV OC43 N protein by targeting\nthe N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding pocket. On the other hand, O3 did\nnot abolish HCoV-OC43 viral replication, likely because O3 is closer\nto the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD disordered loop than is AMP, which hinders\nany orientation suitable for the formation of a hydrogen bond network\nwith the \u03b21 strand, based on the docking results. Moreover,\nsince O3 is as a potent inhibitor of CDC25 protein phosphatases,42,43 most likely some O3 molecules will bind CDC25 and consequently lose\nthe ability to inhibit HCoV-OC43 N-NTD interactions. On the basis\nof the mechanisms of action of compounds such as AMP and PJ34 and\nthe chemical features common to these two distinct compound classes,\nwe formulated three general guidelines for developing CoV N-NTD-targeting\nagents: First, a polycyclic aromatic core is required to enable \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\nstacking with the tyrosine residues in the N-NTD. Second, introducing\nhydrogen-bond-forming moieties to the aromatic core mediates specific\ninteractions with the N-NTD. Third, attaching a branching moiety (or\nmoieties) that fits the ribonucleotide-binding pocket can enhance\nthe drug affinity and specificity (Figure 6).\n\nIn summary, we reported\nthe crystal structures of the CoV N-NTD\nin complex with five ligands, AMP, CMP, GMP, UMP, and PJ34. These\nstructures not only advance our understanding of the RNA-binding mechanisms\nof CoV N-NTD and illustrate the conformational landscapes of drug-binding\npockets, but will also guide the design of novel antiviral agents\nuseful for treating pathogenic HCoV infections.\n\nThe drugs and reagents supplied in \u226595.0%\npurity as determined by HPLC were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.\n(St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification.\n\nThe HCoV-OC43\nN-NTD gene expression and protein purification were performed according\nto previously described methods.44 The\npET28a/N-NTD construct was transferred into nonauxotrophic Escherichia coli cells capable of BL21 (DE3) protein\nexpression. Protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to 1 mM,\nfollowed by incubation at 10 \u00b0C for 24 h. After the bacteria\nwere harvested via centrifugation (3500g, 30 min,\n4 \u00b0C), the bacterial pellets were treated with lysis buffer (50\nmM Tris-buffered saline [pH 7.3], 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole).\nThe soluble proteins were obtained from the supernatant after centrifugation\n(15 000 rpm, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C). The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD proteins\ncarrying a His6-tag at their N-termini were purified using\na Ni\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column (Novagen) with an elution\ngradient ranging from 15 to 300 mM imidazole. Pure fractions were\ncollected and dialyzed against a low-salt buffer. The purified protein\nwas finally concentrated using a 3 kDa cutoff membrane in Amicon ultra-15\ncentrifugal filter units (Millipore, MA) and stored at \u221280\n\u00b0C. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford\nmethod with Bio-Rad protein assay reagents.\n\nHCoV-OC43 N-NTD\ncrystals were grown as previously described:44 The crystallization solution (2 \u03bcL) was mixed with 1.5 \u03bcL\nof purified protein solution (8 mg mL\u20131) and 0.5\n\u03bcL of 40% hexanediol at room temperature (\u223c298 K) and\nequilibrated against a 400 \u03bcL solution in the well of a Cryschem\nplate at 293 K. The crystallization conditions required a 0.5 M succinic\nacid\u2013phosphate\u2013glycine (SPG) buffer at pH 6.0 with 50%\nPEG 1500. The crystalline HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013AMP, HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013CMP,\nHCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013GMP, and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013UMP complexes\nwere obtained via cocrystallization with an HCoV-OC43 N-NTD solution\n(8 mg/mL) preincubated for 30 min with 2 mM AMP, 5 mM CMP, 2 mM GMP,\nand 5 mM UMP, respectively. Crystals of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013PJ34\ncomplex were obtained by soaking a native HCoV-OC43 N-NTD crystal\nfor 1.5 h at 4 \u00b0C in a solution containing 5 mM PJ34 in 0.25\nM SPG buffer at pH 6.0 and 25% PEG 1500. The crystals were flash-cooled\nunder flowing nitrogen gas at 100 K. The X-ray diffraction data for\nthe HCoV-OC43 N-NTD were collected at the National Synchrotron Radiation\nResearch Centre (NSRRC; Hsinchu, Taiwan), BL13B1. All diffraction\nimages were recorded using an ADSD Q315 charge-coupled device (CCD)\ndetector, and the data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000\nsoftware package.45 The data collection\nstatistics of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexed with ligand are summarized\nin Table 1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information.\n\nThe structures\nof the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes with ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphates\nor PJ34 were determined using the previously resolved structure of\nthe native HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (3J3K)20 because\nthe new crystals were isomorphic. For each structure, iterative cycles\nof model building were performed using Mifit and computational refinement\nvia CNS and PHENIX;46,47 5% reflections were set aside\nfor the Rfree calculations (Table 1 and Table S1 in the Supporting\nInformation).48 The stereochemical\nquality of the structures was assessed using the PROCHECK program.49 The molecular figures\nwere produced using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, http://www.pymol.org).\n\nFor drug\nscreening, the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013AMP complex crystal structure\nwas used as a template, and a large-scale molecular-docking-based\nlibrary screen was conducted to identify compounds that might bind\nto the AMP-binding site on the N proteins. Several commercial drug\ndatabanks, including Acros Organics, Sigma Aldrich Inc., and Bachem\nInc. from the ZINC databases, were screened to obtain compounds that\nact on the N protein by using the LIBDOCK molecular docking software.\nThe N protein\u2019s binding pocket was represented using a set\nof spheres, and each compound in the database was docked in the important\npocket of the N protein; this pocket included Tyr 124, Tyr 126, Arg\n122, and Arg 164 because they are involved in optimal RNA binding.\nWe identified 87 potential compounds with high docking scores. Nine\nof the potential hits were identified among the 87 hits that include\nthree interaction characters with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, which are similar\nto the interactions between AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD.\n\nThe single mutants were constructed\nusing a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with a plasmid containing an open\nreading frame that encodes the full-length HCoV-OC43 N protein as\nthe template for mutagenesis. The PCR reaction used Pfu DNA polymerase,\nand each cycle involved heating the sample at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s,\n55 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 68 \u00b0C for 2 min/kb of plasmid length;\nthis sequence was repeated for a total of 16 cycles. The templates\nwere digested with DpnI and transformed into E. coli XL-1 cells. All mutations were confirmed\nby automated sequencing in both directions.\n\nSPR experiments were performed\nas previously described.50 The affinity,\nassociation, and dissociation between the HCoV-OC43 N proteins and\nRNA were measured using a BIAcore 3000A SPR instrument (Pharmacia,\nUppsala, Sweden) equipped with a SensorChip SA5 from Pharmacia; the\nrefractive index change of the sensor chip surface was monitored.\nThese changes are proportional to the quantity of analyte bound. The\nchange in SPR angle is reported in resonance units. First, the surface\nwas washed three times by injecting 10 \u03bcL of a 100 mM NaCl solution\nwith 50 mM NaOH. To control the quantity of RNA (or DNA) bound to\nthe SA chip surface, the biotinylated oligomer was manually immobilized\nonto the surface of a streptavidin chip. The chip surface was subsequently\nwashed with 10 \u03bcL of 10 mM HCl to eliminate nonspecific binding.\nThe N proteins (WT and mutants) were dissolved in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.3)\nwith 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS prior to passing over the chip surface\nfor 140 s at 30 \u03bcL/min to achieve equilibrium. Next, a blank\nbuffer solution was passed over the chip to initiate the dissociation\nreaction; this step was continued for an additional 600 s, allowing\nthe reaction to reach completion. After 600 s, the surface was recovered\nby washing with 10 \u03bcL of 0.1% SDS for each single-stranded RNA.\nThe sensorgrams revealing interactions between the RNA and protein\nwere analyzed using BIA evaluation software (version 3) to determine\nthe dissociation constants (kd/ka). To analyze the effect of PJ34 on the interactions\nbetween the N proteins and RNA, the N proteins were used with PJ34\nin 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS injected onto\nthe sensor chip.\n\nAn RT-PCR was performed as previously\ndescribed.51 First, the 293T cells were\ncultured in DMEM culture medium\ncontaining 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals), 1% nonessential\namino acid (NEAA; Invitrogen), and 10 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol\n(\u03b2-ME). Then 3 \u00d7 105 293T cells were seeded into each well\nof a 12-well plate one day prior to transfection. During the viral\nreplication assay, the cells were transfected or not with pcDNA3.1/NP\n(WT and mutants) containing FuGENE 6 (Roche). Four days postinfection,\nthe media were removed, the cells were lysed in 1 mL of Trisol (Invitrogen),\nthe RNA was extracted following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\nand 2 \u03bcg of the RNA was used as a template for the cDNA synthesis.\nThe cDNA (2 \u03bcL) was added to 23 \u03bcL of a PCR cocktail containing\n2 \u00d7 SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI, Foster City, CA) and a 0.2 \u03bcM\nconcentration of both the sense and antisense primers (IDT DNA, Coralville,\nIA). The amplification was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 thermocycler\n(ABI). The specificity of the amplification was confirmed via dissociation\ncurve analysis. The data were collected and recorded using the ABI\nPrism 7700 software and expressed as a function of the threshold cycle\n(Ct); the threshold cycle describes the fluorescence intensity in\na given reaction tube as it rises above the background level (calculated\nas 10 times the mean standard deviation of the fluorescence in all\nwells over the baseline cycles). The specific primers used to assay\nthe expression of OC43 M and the housekeeping gene GAPDH were Fwd-ATGTTAGGCCGATAATTGAGGACTAT,\nRev-AATGTAAAGATGGCCGCGTAT and Fwd-CCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA,\nRev-ACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCA, respectively.\n\nWe used\nthe crystal structure of the N-NTD\u2013AMP complex as a template\nto construct a plausible N-NTD\u2013ssRNA complex using the molecular\nmodeling programs Discovery Studio 2.5 and CNS.46 On the basis of the N-NTD\u2013AMP complex crystal structure,\nwe extended three and one nucleotide(s) from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032\nends of the AMP, respectively, using the biopolymer module of Discovery\nStudio 2.5. The complex structure was further refined using CNS. The\nRNA force field parameters of Parkinson et al. were utilized.52 The quality of the model geometry was evaluated\nusing the RMS derivation of the bond length and bond angle."}
