{"title": "Virus strain of a mild COVID-19 patient in Hangzhou represents a new trend in SARS-CoV-2 evolution related to Furin cleavage site", "body": "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its infected Disease in Wuhan since the end of 2019 and quickly spreading over the whole country, has put severe threat on public health and economic retardation to China 1, 2 .\n\nThrough quick response and drastic measures even including quarantining Wuhan city on Jan 23, 2020, the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 was effectively controlled.\n\nNevertheless, its ensuing global sporadic appearance 3, 4 and quick dissemination in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy raised world alert of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics 5, 6, 7 .\n\nTherefore, it is urgent to continuingly illustrate the clinical and virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 during its dissemination.\n\nAn important and common feature of virus is that its increased transmissibility usually accompanies with decreased virulence, which also holds true for SARS-CoV-2 and is reflected in the disease trajectory. On one hand, COVID-19 was more severe in Wuhan at its early stage, reaching approximately 32% of severe/critical types and 11% of fatality 8, 9 . In contrast, data out of Wuhan showed more mild type of COVID-19, as presented in Zhejiang province 10 and nationwide 11 .\n\nOn the other hand, its transmissibility was increased from varied basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2 12 and 2.68 6 based on Wuhan data to that of 3.77 13 in national level. Furthermore, the observation of similar viral load between COVID-19 patients with and without symptoms revealed its capacity of occult transmission 14 .\n\nIt is well acknowledged that change in the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 roots from virological change of SARS-CoV-2, in which its spike (S) surface envelope protein plays an important role 15 . Generally, its surface unit (S1) is responsible for host entry by binding to cell receptor while its transmembrane unit (S2) takes charge of the fusion of viral and cellular membranes 16 . Therefore, it is of great value to focus on the sequence mutation and conformation change in S protein for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a finely established model, aiming to explain the related change of COVID-19.\n\nIn this study, we identified 9.9% severe/critical type in 788 confirmed COVID-19 patients of Zhejiang province and median 11 days of positive nuclear acid in 104 patients from our hospital, showing the tendency of COVID-19 progression towards mild but more infective direction. Based on these clinical findings, we performed in-depth bioinformatics analysis by comparing the virological features of previously reported 52 strains of SARS-CoV-2, including Bat coronavirus, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and ZJ01 (SARS-CoV-2 we firstly reported in one patient with mild COVID-19 in Zhejiang province). We demonstarated that the specific mutation of ZJ01 may represent a de novo evolution trend of SARS-CoV-2, which might be related with Furin. Besides, the establishment of a novel SARS-CoV-2 categorization system may facilitate our understanding of virus evolution and its influence on disease severity and progression.\n\nA retrospective study investigating the epidemiological, clinical and virological features of COVID-19 in designated hospitals of Zhejiang province between Jan 17 and Feb 7, 2020 was performed, followed by calculating the period of positive nuclear acid of COVID-19 in our hospital. All patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance 17 . and the preliminary data were reported to the authority of Zhejiang province. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (NO. IIT20200005C). Written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital, as this study was carried out for emerging infectious disease and to be part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation under national authorization. The subtypes of COVID-19 were categorized into mild, severe and critical, as recently reported 11 . The period of positive nuclear acid is defined as the date of confirmed nuclear acid positivity minus the date of confirmed nuclear acid negativity.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 was confirmed from samples of throat-swab and sputum in our hospital and local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) of Zhejiang province, by real-time RT-PCR 8 . All patients received chest x-rays or CT scan on admission, with excluding other respiratory viruses such as influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The epidemiological, anthropometrical, clinical and laboratory data were collected on admission, with specific attention paid to the period between symptom onset and outpatient visiting/PCR confirmation/hospital admission. One strain of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from the sputum of COVID-19 patient with mild type in our hospital, followed by whole genome sequencing with previously reported method 18 .\n\nCurrent available coronavirus sequences (n=85) were collectively achieved from NCBI viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, n=65), Genome Warehouse (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/, n=12), CNGBdb (https://db.cngb.org/, n=3) and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/#/coronavirus, n=6). Sequence of ZJ01 (BataCov/Zheji ang/ZJ01/2019) was provided according to our sequencing result. The 52 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from China (n = 30), Japan (n = 5), Nepal (n = 1), South Korea (n = 1), Australia (n =1), Finland (n=1) and United States of America (n = 13). The collection period was between December 26, 2019 and February 5, 2020. The Furin protein sequence was downloaded from NCBI. Multiple sequence alignment of all coronavirus genomes was performed by using MEGA v7.0.26.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was performed on a total of 80 coronavirus strains, covering 6 species (human, bat, mink, camel, rat and pig). The source of SARS- \n\nTarget protein was downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ protein/1791269092) and corresponding homology models were predicted by SWWISS-MODEL(https://swwassmodel.expasy.org/).

Normalized gene expression levels were presented in the UMAP and violin plots by R package ggplot2 26 .\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , 51.65% of the 788 enrolled patients were male, with low rate of smoking (6.85%). The top three co-existing conditions were hypertension (15.99%), diabetes (7.23%) and chronic liver disease (3.93%). The median period from illness onset to outpatient visiting, PCR confirmation and hospital admission were 2, 4 and 3 days, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (80.71%) and cough (64.21%) while the highest rate of CT/X-ray manifestation was bilateral pneumonia (37.56%). The rates of mild, sever and critical types of COVID-19 were 90.1%, 7.74% and 2.16%, respectively. The ZJ01 patient is male, 30y, and had neither smoking history nor any co-existing condition. He visited outpatient clinics 1 day after symptom onset and was admitted in hospital confirming with COVID-19 in the same day by PCR test. He had no exposure history to Wuhan and none of his family members was reported to be virus positive till now. Consistent with other COVID-19 patients, he had the symptoms of fever, cough and sputum production, with CT image showing bilateral pneumonia. This .

Sequence alignment analysis suggested that ZJ01 had 38 mutation sites compared with other SARS-CoV-2 family members (Fig 2A) , in which 35 mutations were unique to ZJ01, including 7 deletions, 4 insertions and 24 substitutions. For the rest 3 .

Among ZJ01 unique mutations, 10 (NO. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] were located on the S protein, including 3 samesense mutation, 2 deletion mutation and 5 missense mutation, which led to amino acid changes of Ser596, Gln613, Glu702, Ala771, Ala1015, Pro1053 and Thr1066. Further similarity analysis indicated that the main difference among various coronaviruses located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of S1. Intriguingly, the differences between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2 mainly resided in in the S1/S2 and S2 (Fig 2B) . We proposed a novel categorization system for SARS-CoV-2, and defined type C for 8824C, type T for 8824T and type TT for ZJ01 as a special case, respectively. According to this system, we further categorized 54 strains of SARS-CoV-2-related virus (Fig 3C) . We found 83.3% and 95.7% T type in China (n=30) and Wuhan (n=23); 60% and 100% C type in Japan (n=5) and Tokyo (n=3); 53.8% C type in the USA (n=13), 83.3% T type in California (n=6) and 100% C type in Washington D.C (n=3). Intriguingly, of two cases from Illinois, one was T type and the other was named as Y type for Y in both nucleotide positions 8824 and 28247 , indicating the possibility of co-infection with both T and C types. Furthermore, TT type was only reported in Hangzhou. Whether this is an occasional single mutated strain or a novel potential subtype of SARS-CoV-2 warrant more in-depth virological analysis in the future.\n\n.

(B), BaTG13 and MP789, the possible ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, was belong to type C.\n\nTherefore, the C/T pattern may appear in the intermediate host or early human transmission stage.\n\n(C), From the angle of global C/T categorization, China, especially Wuhan, presented with T type while Japan and the USA presented with C type. The difference in the rate of C/T type may help tracing the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThere were 3 potential furin cleavage site (FCS) on S protein, where F1, F2 and F3 separately located in S1/S2, S2 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 ( Fig   4A) . Further comparative alignment analysis on GZ02 (SARS viral strain), Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest sequenced SARS-CoV-2), RaTG13, HKU9-1 (the potential ancestor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-1 and OC43) showed that FCS exhibited a clear sequence and rule in coronavirus evolution ( Fig 4B) . In detail, there was no FCS in HKU9-1, but one potential FCS in F2 locus of GZ02 (Furin score 0.366) showed effective furin binding capacity 28 .\n\nFor RaTG13, F2 locus was slightly changed (Furin score 0.333) and a novel FCS was formed in F1 locus (Furin score 0.279). Though the changes in these two sites were inherited in SARS-CoV-2, there still existed huge differences in F1 site between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2.\n\nStrikingly, we found an additional PRRA sequence in the F1 site of SARS-CoV-2 when compared with RaTG13, forming a strong and reliable FCS (Furin score 0.62). Though the source of insertion was unknown, the PRRA sequence was common in Avian Influenza virus 29 . We deduced that its source might inherit from HKU1 and OC43, which had effective FCS in F1 site (Furin score 0.878 and 0.744) and respective amino acid of SSRRKRR and TKRRSRR, with high similarity of NSPRRAR in SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 and CO43 could cause human upper respiratory tract infection but the symptom was milder than SARS and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reckoned that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 may exchange gene with HKU1 or OC43 to obtain FCS in F1 site during evolution to human transmission (Fig 4C) . ZJ01 had Glu702 to Lys702 substitution at the site 18 th amino acid behind F1 site, and deletion (Ala771 to -) at the site 37 th amino acid ahead of F2 site. These mutations may influence the tertiary and quaternary structure of S protein and finally change the Furin binding capacity. F1-3 sites were conservative in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS (Fig 4D) , indicating the importance of mutation in these sites.\n\nHomology modeling clearly revealed the position of F1-3 sites in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig 5A) . Briefly, F1-3 all located on the surface of S protein and protruded outward, exhibiting high potential as substrate binding sites. F1 located on the transition area of S1 and S2 (S1/S2) with obvious outward protrusion, F2 located on the mid-lower position of S2, while F3 located on the top of S1-NTD.\n\nFurther homology modeling of the S protein of GZ02, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 showed big differences in protein structure conformation of F1 locus. From SARS, RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2, the F1 site showed the tendency of outward .

Though Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 shared same amino acid sequence in F1 site, the mutation (Glu702 to Lys702) nearby F1 site of ZJ01 may still change its protein structure conformation and result in further outward extension by 11.6 \u00c5. Furthermore, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 owned high degree of consistency in F2 site. The F2 site of GZ02 was deeply buried in the inner place of S protein, that was the biggest difference of SARS-CoV-2 whose F2 site was on the surface of S protein. Finally, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 showed high similarity in F3 site that was missing in GZ02.\n\nAdaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS)analysis revealed that furin was a protease with negative charge. Its substrate binding site (191-192, 253-258, 292-295) was covered with a large number of negative charges (Fig 6) . The \n\nThe protein and RNA expression level of ACE2 and Furin in human major tissues were explored in The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). We found that ACE2 was predominantly expressed in small intestine, duodenum, colon, kidney and testis, while was relatively lowly expressed in lung (Fig. 7A) . Furin was expressed in most tissues and organs of the human body, and exhibited highest expression levels of RNA in salivary gland, placenta, liver, pancreas and bone marrow (Fig. 7B) . Of note, Furin had extremely low protein expression level in lung compared with other tissues. and RaTG13 reveals the existence of great difference in electrostatic potential, which may be caused by protein structure change in F1-3 and nearby locus. The mutation in F1-2 sites of ZJ01 may cause its differed binding capacity with Furin, when compared with Wuhan-Hu-1.\n\nTo further explore the correlation between ACE2 and FURIN expression, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in lung, liver, colon as .

Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression were reported recently 30 , we also examined TMPRSS2 expression levels in these tissues.\n\nIn the scRNA-seq datasets, ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2 showed higher expression levels in liver or colon than in lung (Fig. 7E) . Consistently with previously report 31 , ACE2 was mainly expressed in alveolar type 2 cells in lung ( Fig. 7D-E) . ACE2 was highly expressed in liver cholangiocytes, liver hepatocytes, colon colonocytes and colon CT colonocytes compared with other liver or colon cell types respectively. This expression pattern was the same as TMPRSS2, but TMPRSS2 had a higher expression level in each cell type. In contrast, FURIN was expressed in all cells types of three tissues, but had little co-expression with ACE2.\n\n.

With nationwide dissemination, its epidemiological and clinical features have changed. Accumulating evidences indicate the appearance of several unique characteristics distinct from Wuhan 8, 9, 32 , including higher rate of mild type, lower rate of severe/critical type and mortality and longer period of nuclear acid positivity 10, 11, 27, 33 . Moreover, the increased transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has been gradually unmasked, from previous recognition of respiratory transmission to through feces 34 and even tears and conjunctival secretions 35 All these data indicate the possibility of virus evolution during its spreading, towards the direction of decreased severity but increased transmissibility.\n\nHowever, according to recently published virus sequencing results 18 Through analysis on 788 COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province, we found that there existed mild and severe types of SARS-CoV-2. Though we didn't currently have evidence to prove whether patients with mild COVID-19 are directly caused by virus mutation or other factors, we indeed found the significant difference between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2. ZJ01 had relative high number of 37 mutations and its RSCU was closer to humans than most members of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, ZJ01 was the only TT type of total 54 strains in our C/T categorization system. Though the sequence of ZJ01 was still close to Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest identified SARS-CoV-2) and its mutations were not sufficient to reach the threshold of forming an independent subtype, our evidence indicated ZJ01 may represent a specific evolution direction of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn this study, we first developed the C/T categorization system of SARS-CoV-2, which revealed the occurrence of possibly inheritable mutation at the very early stage of its evolution and the potential of continuing C/T subtype formation. The TT type of ZJ01 was unique in our system. Though a similar categorization system has been recently proposed 36 , they did not report such TT type in their 120 strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the C/T pattern could also be used to trace the route of virus infection and evolution. For instance, we found 8 strains of T type with RaTG13 and MP789 both had 8824C/28247T/29198T, we could speculate that these 8 strains of 29198T appeared earlier than strains of 29198C. Using this method, we reckoned that the earliest strains of SARS-CoV-2 was one patient admitted in Shenzhen hospital on 2020-1-10, whose entire type was 8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606C/11125G/15667T/29808G. Besides, the earliest strain in the USA was from Phoenix, Arizona on 2020-1-26, whose entire type was 8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606T/11125G/15667C/ 29808G. Patients with these two earliest strains both had exposure history to Wuhan. Therefore, we surmised that the origin of SARS-CoV-9 was still in Wuhan, but the earliest virus was still vague due to lack of enough samples (Supplementary Figure 1) .\n\nFurin is well recognized as an important serine protease, which has a minimum enzyme restriction site of Arg(R)-X-X-Arg (R) and plays an essential role in influenza infection. The binding capacity change of Furin in Avian Influenza may influence its pathogenicity 37 . Though Furin is not the most common protease in coronavirus, previous studies indicated its pivotal roles in SARS and MERS 28, 38 .\n\nRaTG13 was the strain closest to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% sequence similarity 39 .\n\nHowever, SRAS-CoV-2 had PRRA insertion in 690 amino acid site of S protein, with high conservation 40 . This insertion may become critical point for the host of RaTG13 turning from animal to human. Through sequence alignment, we found this inserted sequence may arise from the translocation between human coronavirus HKU1 and OC43 (Figure 4 ).\n\n.

However, whether F3 site really exists and what is the function need further investigation. Furthermore, the target cell binding site of HKU1 and OC43 was on their S A segment of S protein while its corresponding site in SARS-CoV-2 was NTD. Therefore, except for the potential interaction in F1 site, there also exists the possibility of interaction in NTD segment between SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1/OC43. Viruses frequently undergo mutation and adjust its RSCU under evolutionary selection pressure to adapt to the host, facilitating better replication and dissemination 41 . The choice of Furin cleavage site might be an outstanding marker for coronavirus evolution. Meanwhile, we found that the mutation in ZJ01 may cause binding force change of FCS. All these data indicate that Furin might play a pivotal role in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The evolution trends of increasing FCS in SARS-CoV-2 we found in this study are more prone to influenza-like clinical manifestations such as human HKU1 and OC43 42 .\n\nSingle cell sequencing analysis showed that Furin had higher expression level and wider organ distribution than ACE2, especially in salivary gland, lachrymal gland, colon, liver and kidney. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might evolve to utilize this specific feature by increasing FCS to become more infectious on multi-organ levels. Our hypothesis was in consistent with changed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from published data and our observation, including detection of virus in feces 34 and conjunctival secretions 35 , decreased severity/fatality, increased liver/kidney damage and symptoms of gastrointestinal tract, increased transmissibility and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity. Since ACE2 expression was quite low in the whole body including lung, we speculated that, on one hand, it might be the inflammatory reaction whereas not the viral road itself triggering severe respiratory damage; on the other hand, the utilization of Furin may help scatter virus attack from lung to other organs, contributing to the phenomenon of decreased severity but increased liver/kidney dysfunction. Nevertheless, all these speculations warrant further investigations.\n\nTo sum up, ZJ01 isolated form mild COVID-19 patient of Zhejiang province represents a potential branch in virus evolution. SARS-CoV-2 may adopt a similar mechanism by depending on Furin for invasion as HJU1 and OC43. Such potential evolution direction may promote the appearance of mild subtype of COVID-19."}
