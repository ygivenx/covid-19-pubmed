The virus is reported to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route and is stable in the feces for long periods of time (Appel, M.J.G., 1979) .\n\nAlthough dogs of all ages are susceptible to canine parvovirus infection, the mortality rate is highest in puppies (Appel, M.~J.G., et ai., 1979) . Besides possible cardiomegaly, myocarditis, pulmonary congestion, and interstitial pneumonia, an abrogation of the immune system was proposed to occur (Carpenter, J.L., et al, 1980; Krakowka, S., et al, 1982) . The purpose of this research was to investigate peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) function by mitogen stimulation in dogs shedding canine parvovirus. Experiments with CPV infection in conventionalized germ-free dogs did not produce a debilitating enteritis as observed clinically in pet dogs (McAdaraugh et al., 1982, and Pollock, R.V., et al, 1982) . Therefore, studies were done on the PBL function of randomly selected mongrel dogs from an humane facility which had naturally acquired CPV.\n\n0165-2427/84/$03.00\n\nOutbred dogs of various ages were obtained from the Franklin COunty H~mane Facility in Columbus, Ohio. The animals were classified as CPV-positive or -negative dogs based on the presence of CPV in the feces assayed for by the hemagglutination test (HA) described by Carmichael et al. (19g0) .\n\nThe procedure for the canine LBT was a modification of a method described by Krakowka et al. (1975) . \n\nThe data are given as the mean + SD.\n\nsignificance.\n\nStudent's t test was used to determine\n\nInitially, mitogen titration studies were done on peripheral blood lymphocytes from 5 CPV-negative mongrel dogs to determine optimum ConA and PHA-P mitogen doses. Maximum ConA stimulation of l x l05 lymphocytes was obtained with O /ag per well (Fig. 1) . The PHA-P stock diluted to 1:10 5 per well provided maximum stimulation (Fig. 2) .\n\nIn these phytomitogen studies with both ConA (Fig. 3 ) and PHA-P (Fig. 4) \n\nPha-P LBT responses in CPV-positive and -negative mongrel dogs.\n\nCanine parvovirus infection in outbred animals causes a debilitating enteritis along with a marked depletion and necrosis of lymphoid tissues (Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus) suggesting immune dysfunction (McAdaraugh, 3.P., et al., 1992) .\n\nRecent evidence suggests that CPV infection predisposes dogs to canine distemper virus disease (Krakowka et al.~ 1992. Since CPV challenge in conventionalized germ-free dogs does not produce the clinical findings of canine parvovirus infection (Pollock, R.V.3.~ 1992) , we decided to study the immune status of outbred animals shedding CPV.\n\nTo evaluate the lymphocyte function in these animals, LBT assays with phytomitogens were performed. The group of CPV-positive dogs showed a depressed lymphocyte function. Since these animals were randomly selected from a humane facility, information on variables such as age of animal~ time and phase of infection and amount of inoculum was not available. Despite the fact that these conditions were not consistent from animal to animal, a statistically significant state of immunosuppression exists in the animals shedding virus. Although these animals were not "}
