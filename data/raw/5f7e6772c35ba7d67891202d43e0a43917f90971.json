{"title": "EARLY ESTIMATION OF REPRODUCTION NUMBER OF COVID-19 IN VIETNAM", "body": "Reproduction number is an epidemiologic indicator that reflects the contagiousness and transmissibility of infectious agents. Understanding the reproduction number is crucial for predicting the transmission of an infectious diseases and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures.\n\nThere are several ways to estimate the reproduction number, including mathematical modeling of compartment models or through the serial interval of the infection chain [1, 2] . The estimation of reproduction number by compartment models is heavily based on several assumptions, such as a homogeneous mixing of the fixed population [3] . The parameters, including incubation period, and infectious period are often not available with novel infectious disease line COVID-19.\n\nAlternatively, estimation of reproduction number by the mean and standard deviation of serial interval, which is the range between primary and secondary symptom onset dates is an uncomplicated approach and may provide\n\nWe collected data on confirmed Covid-19 cases in Vietnam from multiple sources. The master list of Covid-19 cases was compiled from the official new releases of Ministry of Health (available on the website http://ncov.moh.ncov.vn). The first two Covid-19 cases were described by Lan et .

[4] . Latterly, 11 confirmed cases from one northern Vietnam province were published [5] .\n\nEpidemiologic history from data was combined with the master list.\n\nWe construct a network and make plausible cases of infectors and infectees, and there by estimate the discrete distribution of serial interval from the chain of infections. We assumed that the serial interval follows the discrete gamma distribution. The reproduction number was estimate by the growth rate of the epidemiological curve and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the gamma distribution. We used R 3.6.4 software [5] for data analysis and modeling. Package incidence [6] was used to create incidence object. The serial interval distribution and R0 was fitted and early reproduction number was estimated by package earlyR [7] .\n\nFrom 20 Jan 2020 to 24 March 2020, there was 123 cases confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Vietnam. The epidemiologic trend of Covid-19 relatively divided into two periods (Table 1) . We estimated the mean of discrete gamma distribution of serial interval was 6.34 and SD was 3.66. The mean R0 of first period was 1.14, median 1.18 (95%CI 0.7 -1.89). .

[9] , which was also used by Zhang et al. to estimate the reproduction number on the Diamond Princess cruise ship [10] .\n\nNevertheless, the analysis may shed lights on the reproduction number of COVID-19 outbreaks in Vietnam. The same methods can be applied with more detailed data on the chains of infection, and get better results and help policy makers montior and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any agency of the government.\n\n.
