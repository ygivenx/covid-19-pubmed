{"title": "Dynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey from 1985 to 2016", "body": "In 2013, the Ministry also published that, at least 6000 individuals were infected with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, 1767 were newly infected in 2014, and about 9379 people were living with HIV/AIDS by the end of the year. This registered about 38% increase in the number of patients in Turkey (Sayan et al. 2016) .\n\nConclusively over the last decade, infection with STDs has risen due to the rise of 'mobile prostitution' with illegal workers from abroad, especially from Eastern Europe. In addition, an increasing number of workers from African countries, which is also one of the most infected continents in the globally (Altan 2007) , enter Turkey illegally.\n\nNew infections start with someone who is already infected. This new infection occurs because the infected persons do not take necessary precaution measures or because of poor protective services. This can be possible if patients are not being well educated on their responsibility to prevent the spread of the disease and/or are not being included in protective service studies (Morin et al. 2004) . In general, HIV diagnosis is a traumatic experience that changes HIV? person's life. This is why patients don't reveal their diagnosis at all or only reveal it to a limited number of people. It is among the strategic goal of HIV prevention to understand how and why patients hide their diagnosis and to determine possible solution to it (Miller and Rubin 2007; Anderson et al. 2009; Wolf et al. 2004) . Previous studies indicated that the most common reason patients hide their diagnosis is fear of stigma and exclusion (Anderson and Walker 2010) . It has also been indicated that having a family member diagnosed with HIV can affect family members in different ways (Vithayachockitikhun 2006) .\n\nAnother study performed in Turkey shows that in addition to problems faced by HIV? people with regard to employment, health and education, the biggest problem is stigma. Many more studies carried out in different countries and in different cultures and religions have reported the same threat faced by the patients and their families as those in Turkey (Ramchandani et al. 2007 ). Due to these problems HIV/AIDS positive people normally do not register themselves in the various registration centers. However, there is need for government and other relevant authorities to know the exact cases of HIV in the country in order to know the exact threat posed by the disease and consequently adopt possible measures in combating it.\n\nMathematical models can be used in studying the dynamics of HIV/AIDS (Korenromp et al. 2002; White et al. 2004) . Primary purpose of any mathematical model of HIV transmission lies in using individual level inputs to project population level outcomes. Some of the important outcomes that can be examined with a model are; the incidence of infection, the prevalence of infection, or the doubling time of the epidemic. More important than these however, is simply the likelihood of an epidemic to occur that is whether there is sufficient transmission potential for a chain of infection to be sustained. This outcome is termed by a simple summary statistic: the reproduction number of the infectious process, R 0 . In a susceptible population, R 0 represents the expected number of secondary infections generated by the first infected individual. If R 0 is equal or greater than 1 an epidemic is expected. If R 0 is less than 1, the infection is expected to die out.\n\nThe magnitude of R 0 is used to measure the risk of an epidemic or pandemic in any emerging infectious disease. It was used for understanding the outbreak and danger of SARS (Choi and Pak 2003) . R 0 was also used to characterize bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE), foot and mouth disease (FMD), strains of influenza, and West Nile Virus (Woolhouse and Anderson 1997; Ferguson et al. 2001; Mills et al. 2004; Wonham et al. 2004 ). The incidence and spread of dengue, Ebola, and scrapie have also been assessed by R 0 (Luz et al. 2003; Hagmann et al. 2003; Chowell et al. 2004) . Tropical issues such as the risks of indoor airborne infection, bioterrorism, and computer viruses also depend on this important parameter (Gravenor et al. 2004; Rudnick and Milton 2003; Kaplan et al. 2002) .\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the actual threats posed by HIV/AIDS using mathematical modeling, and to indicate the possible flaws in the existing registration exercise in Turkey. We intend to achieve this by comparing the magnitude of this important threshold quantity (basic reproduction ratio) for the official data obtained from Federal Ministry of Health Turkey and the results obtained from the simulation of our model.\n\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, the model is presented and the basic reproduction number is obtained. In Sect. 3, stability of the equilibria is investigated. In Sect. 4, results are obtained and compared using the official data and by numerically simulating our model. Finally Sect. 5 is the discussion and conclusion of the research.\n\nThe model is a system of differential equations as follows; where the meaning of parameters/variables is given by Table 1 .\n\n(i) S(0) is considered to be the whole population in a specific year (ii) We considered homogeneous mixing in the population It follows from (1) that,\n\nThen \n\nThus the feasible region for (1) is\n\nEquating the equations in (1) to zero and solving simultaneously we find two equilibrium points. Disease free and endemic equilibrium points.\n\nIn Sect. 2.3, we will come to realize the meaning of Ka l l\u00fev \u00f0 \u00de .\n\nThis is the number of secondary infections caused by a single infective individual in a completely susceptible population. It is denoted by R 0 . Using the next generation of matrix (NGM) method we have, The spectral radius, which is the dominant eigenvalue, is aS 0 v\u00fel Hence the basic reproduction ration is;\n\nDynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey from 1985 to 2016 S715\n\n3 Global stability analysis of the equilibria\n\nIn this section stability analysis of the two equilibrium points is obtained by the use of Lyapunov function. The conditions for the global stability of the equilibria in each case depends on the magnitude of the basic reproduction ratio R 0 . Hence we have the following theorems and their proofs.\n\nTheorem 1 The disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 B 1.\n\nProof We construct the following Lyapunov function Theorem 2 The endemic equilibrium E 1 is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 [ 1.\n\nProof We construct the following Lyapunov function \n\nIn this section, results are calculated by simulating the model using the formal data obtained in Turkey. Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the comparison of the official data obtained from Federal Ministry of Health Turkey with the predicted value from the model. It shows the years, number of HIV cases, number of AIDS cases and the total number of HIV and AIDS from 1985 to 2016. We computed the basic reproduction ration (R 0 ) in each year to show number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in the population for that year. In epidemiology if this threshold quantity is equal or greater than one there is going to be epidemics, as such it's magnitude is used to measure the threat posed by certain disease in a given population. Table 3 and Fig. 2 give the comparison between these basic reproduction ratios as calculated using the official data and the corresponding predicted values as calculated using the model.\n\nTo show the significance of the data obtained by the model in predicting HIV epidemics in Turkey over the official data obtained from the Ministry of Health Turkey, we obtained HIV drug data from intercontinental marketing service (IMS). The IMS data composed of IMS Health Turkey Pharmaceutical Index Data view and Turkey Hospital Index Data view. Table 4 and Fig. 3 shows the relationships of these three sets of data (exact, predicted, and IMS) from 2000 to 2016. This is because the only available IMS data for Turkey started from the year 2000.\n\nIn this paper, we constructed a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of HIV/ AIDS in Turkey from 1985 to 2015. We found two equilibrium points, disease free and endemic equilibrium point. Global stability analysis of the equilibria was carried out by the use of Lyapunov function. Conditions of stability of both the equilibrium points were shown to depend on a threshold quantity, the basic reproduction ratio (R 0 ). It was shown that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than one, the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease dies out. Also, if the basic reproduction ratio is greater than one, the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable, and epidemics occur.\n\nWe used official data collected from the Ministry of Health in Turkey from 1985 to 2016 to study and predict the dynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey. Basic reproduction ratios were found over the years, and their magnitudes were compared. We also predicted the basic reproduction ratios over the years using our model. From Table 2 and Fig. 1 , it can be observed that the predicted cases of both HIV and AIDS are below or almost equal to the exact values from 1985 to 1993. Starting from 1994 the predicted cases continue to increase rapidly and are far greater than the exact cases. This can be attributed to poor registration exercise in the country. From Table 3 , it can be seen that from 1985 to 1995 the exact values for the basic reproduction ratios are less than one, hence no epidemics. It is also less than one in 1999. Starting from 1996, with the exception of 1999, all the basic reproduction ratios are greater than one, implying epidemics.\n\nFrom the predicted values R 0 values are less than one from 1985 to 1993, which almost agrees with the exact values. After 1993 the epidemics start to occur with the value of R 0 greater than one in each year. In the exact values of R 0 , we noticed a fluctuation from 1985 up to 2005 and then a steady increase from 2006 to 2016. This can also be attributed to poor registration system to cover the exact HIV/AIDS cases in Turkey. However, there is stable increase in the predicted values of R 0 over the years. Hence our model shows the To show the significance of the data obtained by the model in predicting HIV epidemics in Turkey over the official data obtained from the Ministry of Health Turkey, we obtained HIV drug data from intercontinental marketing service (IMS). Comparing these three sets of data, which can be seen from Fig. 3 , shows the flaws in the official data. The result of the analysis in this paper shows the urgent need of intervention by the relevant authorities in controlling the spread of the disease. Since in recent years, the education sector has come to play an increasingly important role in preventing HIV. Our proposal here is the use of interventions through the education sector to curtail the spread of the disease in Turkey. This is particularly because many studies in literature show that the school-based HIV/AIDS education programs provide significant changes in knowledge and attitudes that affect sexual behavior of young people. This leads to significant progress in the use of condoms and decrease in most of the sexual health problems. (Thomson et al. 1999; Kinsler 2004; Fawole et al. 1999; Kirby et al. 2007; James-Traore et al. 2004) . Two element are covered by effective school-based education: training of teachers and curriculum development. A review by Kirki et al. evaluates multiple studies of such interventions and found that successful curriculum-based programs have 17 characteristics (Thomson et al. 1999) . Some of these characteristics were about development of the curriculum; Some were about the curriculum itself; and the remaining were about the implementation of the curriculum (Thomson et al. 1999) . After developing a curriculum, there is need for teachers to be well trained to enable them to improve students' knowledge about HIV prevention and transmission, attitudes toward HIV prevention, and behaviours relating to HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn conclusion, the basic reproduction ratio is increasing in Turkey over the years. This shows the need of intervention from the relevant authorities in controlling the spread of this disease. Also there is need for the government to enhance the registration system of HIV/ AIDS, so as to know the exact threat posed by the disease and consequently adopt possible measures in combating it.\n\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nEthical approval All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
