{"title": "A Toolkit for Rapid Modular Construction of Biological Circuits in Mammalian Cells", "body": "Molecular cloning is the cornerstone of modern biological research. It is required to generate DNA vectors that can encode a myriad of genetic circuits with applications in the fields of cell biology, therapeutics, virology, synthetic biology and biotechnology, among others. These circuits can encompass the expression of endogenous proteins, small RNAs, reporters of gene expression or cellular activity, and other innumerable reagents whose applications extend from basic discovery to medical applications. To move molecular cloning forward into an engineering discipline, with minimal trial and error and reproducible results, the parts that constitute engineered circuits need to be modular, vetted for their function and easy to share. To maximize the range of applications, circuits made from these parts need to be rapidly assembled, amenable to fast prototyping, and not bottlenecked by the delivery method to their target genomic integration sites.\n\nConventional approaches to produce DNA vectors involve the PCR amplification of DNA fragments from different sources, which are later ligated following digestion with restriction enzymes. This procedure is time consuming, laborious, prone to errors and requires many control steps when subcloning (e.g. sequencing). Due to the shrinking cost of commercial DNA synthesis, ordering gene fragments or entire genes provides a potential avenue to reliably build libraries of DNA vectors. While this technology increases the diversity of parts that can be cloned and removes a DNA source requirement, current pricing, size limitation, and turnaround time remain a significant bottleneck.\n\nIn light of these limitations, several strategies have been developed to streamline the assembly of different parts in the construction of DNA vectors for mammalian biology [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Notable among those is the Gibson modular assembly platform (GMAP) 7 , a framework for DNA vector\n\nThe basis for the MTK is a library of parts that are \"domesticated\" from source DNA using a Golden Gate (GG) reaction 12 into a standard vector. The resulting plasmid is then sequenced once to ensure fidelity to the source sequence, and then can later be reused as a modular part in a variety of genetic constructs. Similar to previously published work 6 , 3 , 10 , 12 , we utilize the type-IIS restriction enzymes BsaI and BsmbI due to their \"reach over\" endonuclease activity that leaves arbitrary four base overhangs adjacent to the recognition site. The defining feature for a part vector is a unique four base overhang that categorizes it to similar parts, and ensures the sequential 5' to 3' ligation of parts into a transcriptional unit (TU) of multiple parts.\n\nDue to the hierarchical nature of the MTK, with the library of part vectors sequenced-verified, only diagnostic restriction digests are necessary to verify correct assembly in subsequent GG reactions. We employ BsmBI and BsaI GG reactions in an alternating manner, to assemble a library of part vectors into libraries of TU plasmids, and ultimately into multi-transcriptional unit (multi-TU) plasmids. The 4 day time from source DNA to final plasmid is comparable to alternative cloning methods when including time to sequence verify (Fig. 1a) . However, the significant time reduction comes in the reusability of the confirmed part plasmids where completely redesigned new configurations of final plasmids (e.g. new TUs) can then be assembled from existing parts in only 2 days.\n\nThe MTK encompasses part vector categories 1-8 that are sufficient to build and deliver a vast combinatorial library of genetic constructs to cells (Fig. 1b) . Parts 2, 3 and 4 form the core of the TU, specifying the 5' UTR, coding, and 3' UTR sequences, respectively. Part 2 corresponds to promoter sequences that can be specified to drive variable constitutive or .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint inducible expression or recruit diverse host polymerases, such as polymerase III for non-coding RNA transcription. Part 3 vectors are canonical coding sequences that are typically proteins of interest. Part 4 refers to 3' UTR sequences that encode polyadenylation (pA) sequences that terminate transcription, or spacer sequences that couple transcription to the downstream TU.\n\nFinally, parts 1 and 5 correspond to connector sequences that enable the sequential ordering of TUs into a multi-TU plasmid, with many versions provided in the MTK. For example, if the design objective is to minimize polymerase read-through and maximize independent expression from each TU, then Part 1 implements connectors with insulator sequences 13 . Conversely, if the goal is to enable strongly correlated expression across adjacent TUs, alternative Part 1 vectors consisting of connectors with orthogonal P2A elements are provided. These are cis-acting hydrolase elements that allow the promoter of one TU to drive expression of up to five downstream TUs 14 .\n\nWithin these defined parts, further specialization is easily achieved. For example, Part 3 and Part 4 vectors can be replaced with constituent a and b vectors where Part 3 can be replaced with Part 3a and 3b, and still connect to a Part 4. This allows combinations that can implement tethering of localization tags, protein domains or any desired coding sequence both N-and C-terminally with an innocuous linker sequence in between (Fig. 1b) . Additionally, we have developed coupled Part 234 vectors to accommodate rapid cloning of small guide RNA (sgRNA) expression by oligo annealing for CRISPR/Cas9-related genetic constructs. Parts 6, 7 and 8 generally flank a typical TU and can encode the method of delivery to cells. For example, it can encode the homology arms for a locus of integration, or bacterial origin of replication and selection markers.\n\nLastly, the MTK contains Part 0 destination vectors that allow delivery via viral transduction, transposase transfection and homologous recombination from the same collection of TUs (Fig. 1c) . Unlike other assembly methods, where the genetic constructs must be repeatedly redesigned to accommodate a particular delivery method, within the MTK, one needs only to change the Part 0 vector in the final GG reaction to facilitate different delivery into cells.\n\nSeveral considerations may determine which destination delivery is appropriate, but this system allows one to recycle TUs and maintain a library of useful units that may be context-specific.\n\nThis mammalian cloning toolkit combines intuitive, hierarchical organization, with an expansive library to enable rapid, facile iteration between a variety of genetic constructs that can be integrated into cells without redesign or re-sequencing, irrespective of the delivery method. A comprehensive list of parts can be found in Supp. Table 1 .\n\nIn designing genetic constructs, an important consideration is the relative doses of expression strengths between respective genes. Within the MTK, we have seventeen characterized constitutive promoters that span a spectrum of transcriptional expression strengths. We include promoters from a mix of human, mouse and viral origin for a range of expression, alternatives to swap in the event of silencing effects, and a balance of native and transgene promoters for conventional cell lines.\n\nTo characterize the relative strengths of these promoters, we assembled a panel of 14\n\nTUs with varied promoter parts driving mAzamiGreen expression, flanked by the bovine growth hormone (Bgh) pA 3' UTR. In an adjacent TU, a CAG promoter expresses mScarlet with the rabbit beta-globin (Rgl) pA 3' UTR ( Fig. 2a) . We transiently transfected each multi-TU plasmid into HEK293T cells and normalized the mAzamiGreen expression by mScarlet to control for plasmid copy number. This suite of promoters span a range of 2 orders of magnitude over background, with the strongest promoter, CMV, more than 300-fold greater than a promoter-less mAzamiGreen. The ranked expression strength of the promoters revealed a smooth continuum of expression between 10-fold and 300-fold (Fig. 2a) . Thus this suite of promoters can be used to tailor TU expression levels and leverage overlapping promoter strengths to avoid repeated elements in multi-TU plasmids. The ranked expression of the promoters across human and mouse demonstrates that their relative strengths are largely maintained (Fig. Supplementary   Fig. 1a, b) , suggesting that these promoters are portable across different systems. Additionally, the rank of promoter effect on gene expression is consistent between transient and stably integrated expression, leaving this suite of promoters as a reliable metric for TU design (Fig.   Supplementary Fig. 1c, d) .\n\nAdditionally, the MTK allows for further fine-tuning of a TU in a given range using a collection of five different 3' UTR sequences. Similar to the promoter comparison, we generated a circuit with the same constitutive promoter (EF1a) and varied the 3' UTR sequence to compare normalized mAzamiGreen expression (Fig. 2b) . We observed a range of 4-fold change in expression of mAzamiGreen among the three conventional 3' UTR sequences. While the Bgh pA and Rgl pA signals are redundant, the simian virus 40 (SV40) pA signal has a nearly 1.5-fold greater effect on expression than the other pA sequences (Fig. 2c) . This supports the notion that by rationally varying promoter-pA combinations, one can fine-tune incremental changes in expression to complement the log-scale changes accompanied by solely changing promoters.\n\nMoreover, replacing a canonical 3' UTR sequence with either of the spacer sequences diminishes expression of its upstream coding sequence, but the spacers still enable appreciable expression over background. The two spacers differ in their use: including a stop codon allows for efficient reverse-transcription in lentiviral preparation while omitting the stop codon enables read-through in multicistronic plasmids. Finally, the MTK contains two inducible promoters whose use is illustrated in Fig. 6 . This characterized suite of constitutive promoters and 3' UTR's coupled with the facile assembly can generate libraries of fine-tuned expression of a protein of interest. We only explored here a few combinations related to one promoter (EF1a), but other combinations can be easily assembled using the parts already provided in the MTK and assayed by the interested user.\n\nOne hurdle to construct genetic circuits for viral delivery is that viral vectors have a limited cargo capacity. While this issue can be bypassed by using other delivery methods, if viral delivery is the only option, smaller sized constructs that maintain function are needed. To address this need, we developed Left Connector parts (MTK Part 1) that encode ribosome skipping P2A elements to allow for the expression of 2-12 genes of interest in a multicistronic vector. To test the toolkit's ability to produce skipped proteins from one RNA, we built a multicistronic vector with one CAG promoter driving membrane-tethered iRFP713, cytoplasmic mAzamiGreen, mCerulean-tagged p38 KTR 15 , and histone H2B fused to mScarlet separated by P2A sites (Fig. 3a) . Compared to the control version of this construct, which expresses the same proteins in a multi-TU format from repeated, independent promoters, the multicistronic construct conferred a 35% reduction in vector size. Transiently transfected HEK293T cells with the multicistronic vector showed the correct localization of each of the proteins (Fig. 3b) , with no distinguishable difference from the independent multi-TU control. These data demonstrate the feasibility to deploy P2A elements to generate single multicistronic constructs that circumvent the size limitations of conventional viral delivery vectors.\n\nWhen delivering synthetic genetic circuits, it can be essential to have site-specific, single copy integration. In addition, it is important that this integration is efficient and reliable. In order to accomplish this functionality, we included in the MTK a BxBI-dependent landing pad system for integrating synthetic circuits in a locus of choice. The landing pad system is divided into two parts: first, a landing pad cell line; and second, a landing pad transfer vector. As a proof of concept we built a HEK293T cell line with a BxBI landing site in the hAAVS1 locus (hAAVS1 LP), identified by mRuby2 expression and Hygromycin resistance, and tested its ability for site specific recombination.\n\nThe landing pad cell line was generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated integration of a vector with homology to the hAAVS1 locus. This vector encoded a multicistronic cassette with Hygromycin resistance and nuclear-localized mRuby2 surrounded by a LoxP site and two FRT sites. The BxBI attP site is located between the promoter and the first gene of this cassette (Fig.   4a ). We chose to integrate the landing pad in the hAAVS1 locus due to its low impact on gene expression 16 . We verified the correct integration of the landing pad cassette by PCR in 8 clones ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and continued its characterization in clone #8 due to the monoallelic presence of the landing pad. We further confirmed the presence of the landing pad in the cell line by mRuby2 expression (Fig. 4b) .\n\nThe second part of the landing pad system is a transfer vector that encodes the synthetic gene circuit. In order to verify that the transfer vector is correctly integrated at the hAAVS1 landing pad (hAAVS1 LP), we positioned a promoter-less multicistronic cassette encoding Blasticidin resistance and nuclear localized tagBFP downstream of the BxBI attB site. When site specific integration is accomplished, the cell line switches color (from mRuby2 to tagBFP) and resistance (Hygromycin to Blasticidin).

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo test the landing pad, we integrated a transcriptional unit that contains H2B fused to mAzamiGreen, driven by the CAG promoter (Fig. 4a) . Upon integration of the transfer vector into the hAAVS1 LP, we noted the decrease in mRuby2 expression together with expression of mAzamiGreen and tagBFP in most cells (Fig. 4b) , with a small fraction of cells showing no or incorrect integration of the transfer vector. Gratifyingly, clone #2, in which both wild type alleles of hAAVS1 locus were replaced by the landing pad construct, showed two populations as measured by fluorescence upon integration of the transfer vector. This suggested that these two populations had one or two copies that integrated into the genome, further demonstrating the efficiency of integrating into the landing pad ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ).\n\nWhile our results have shown the functionality of the landing pad in one genomic locus, this system is by design generalizable to additional loci of interest or additional species by simply replacing the homology arms in the CRISPR-Cas9 vector. It is also straightforward to replace resistance and fluorescent protein markers in both the landing pad and transfer vectors, as these vectors are generated by GG assemblies of parts already existing in the MTK library.\n\nWhen designing experiments that require analysis of a large number of protein or circuit variants, such as protein expression or activity optimization and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, it is vital to ensure that the cloning protocol does not present any bottlenecks in terms of throughput, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nIn order to showcase the ability of MTK to generate libraries of transcriptional unit variants, we performed two combinatorial reactions: First, a library of fluorescent proteins that vary in their localization, and which can be integrated as a single-copy into the BxBI landing pad site; second, a library of viral-delivered sgRNAs that target Cas9 to two fluorescent proteins leading to their disruption.\n\nIn the first library, we combined one of three localization tags (NLS (nucleus), NES (cytoplasm) and Lyn (plasma membrane)) with four fluorescent proteins (tagBFP, mAzamiGreen, mScarlet and iRFP713) (Fig. 5a) . Performed in parallel, this reaction generated The final library was delivered to the hAAVS1-LP HEK293T cell line described before (Fig. 4 ) to ensure single-copy integration in every cell. We visualized the expression and localization of the fluorescent proteins after selection with Blasticidin and observed the successful random delivery of no more than 3 fluorescently-tagged subcellular compartments (Fig. 5b) , as predicted from the cloning strategy.\n\nNext, we sought to explore whether the MTK facilitates the construction of combinatorial CRISPR knockout libraries. To do that, we generated a library of sgRNAs that target two fluorescent proteins. We first assembled TUs that contain sgRNAs that target tagBFP, mScarlet, or that are non-targeting 17 . We combined those in a multi-TU unit so that a final Lentiviral delivery plasmid contains 2 guide RNAs, ensuring that we had any one of four possible outcomes (tagBFP knockout, mScarlet knockout, tagBFP and mScarlet knockout, or non-targeting control) in the final library (Fig. 5c) . Additionally, each lentiviral vector encodes .

After 14 days of selection, we measured . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Importantly, the fraction of each outcome was in accordance with the predictions of the classifier. Taken together, these data argue that the MTK is able to rapidly generate libraries of vectors that express proteins variants or multiple sgRNAs. Additionally, these libraries can be inserted into the genome by transduction or recombination and the diversity of variants, as well as the correct ratio of each variant in the library, is maintained through all cloning steps.\n\nThe ability to prototype gene circuits in synthetic biology is contingent on rapidly assessing part efficacy, optimizing and implementing changes for the next iteration. The vast combinatorics present in the MTK library present a fruitful opportunity to prototype, test, and iterate on circuit designs in parallel. To explore this idea, we constitutively expressed The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint As expected, in each of the circuit iterations, expression of mAzamiGreen relative to the iRFP713 control is below basal with the repressor domain, or above basal with the activator domain (Fig. 6b) . However, the degree of activation and repression varies considerably across each circuit. More specifically, dSpCas9 achieves approximately 3-fold reduction in fluorescence through the KRAB effector and 30-fold induction in both the UAS and TRE promoters. In contrast, the dSaCas9 fused to VPR is an effective activator increasing expression 30-fold, but when fused to a KRAB domain, dSaCas9-mediated repression is comparable to background FP expression levels. The data also suggests that the TRE promoter exhibits higher basal activity due to its overall greater repression, and lower activation when compared to the UAS promoter. This information, in light of other considerations such as protein size or protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence versatility, expedites the rational design and optimization of Cas9-controlled gene expression circuits through the parallelization of prototyping. As a result, this strategy can serve as a useful reference for further customized circuits, and a demonstration that this prototyping can be scaled to easily screen various combinations of genetic circuits.\n\nViruses represent a class of naturally occurring genetic circuits that are particularly amenable to construction using the MTK due to their modular genome organization. In particular, the MTK can be relevant to speed the investigation of emerging viral agents by rapidly \"booting up\" their genes in a mammalian host. A key example corresponds to the filoviruses, a family of highly pathogenic genetically related viruses that includes the Ebola and Marburg viruses 24 . Infection with these agents can cause rapid onset of severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. First identified in 1976, they remain a .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint significant human pathogen due to their high fatality rate and periodic outbreaks. While global efforts to contain these outbreaks have resulted in fast-tracking of several experimental treatments, there is currently no approved preventive or therapeutic treatment for EBOV infections.\n\nEBOV is encoded by ~19 kbp negative sense single stranded RNA genome that contains 3' non-coding regulatory leader (ldr) and 5' non-coding regulatory trailer (trl) sequences. These sequences flank a large central region that encodes seven distinct proteins (nucleoprotein, NP; 35 kDa phosphoprotein/polymerase co-factor, VP35; 40 kDa matrix protein, VP40; surface glycoprotein, GP; 30 kDa phosphoprotein/polymerase co-factor, VP35; 24 kDa regulatory protein, VP24; and a large RNA dependent RNA polymerase protein, Lpol) (Fig. 7a ).\n\nIn the late 1990's a 6-plasmid BSL2 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) minigenome replicon system was developed for EBOV to accelerate research on the transcription and genome replication sub-lifecycle of the virus, and aid antiviral discovery efforts 25, 26 . This system requires expression of four viral proteins (NP, VP35, VP30, and Lpol), along with aT7 polymerase, and a T7-driven minigenome reporter construct 25 (Fig. 7a) . Transfection of these 6 plasmids into mammalian cells results in expression of NP, VP35, VP30, Lpol viral proteins, and the T7 polymerase. The viral proteins recognize and associate with the T7-transcribed minigenome reporter RNA template (vRNA (-)) then catalyze transcription (mRNA) and replication (aRNA (+)), resulting in measurable reporter gene expression (Fig. 7a) . While the 6-plasmid system has been a valuable tool for initial discoveries into EBOV replication and transcription, it is not readily amenable to systematic studies due to its transient nature, inefficiency (all 6 plasmids must be present in the same cell), and variability that limits scaling. More recently, a stable cell line version of this system has been developed via sequential integration of RNP viral proteins 27 .\n\nWhile these cells displayed a highly stable minigenome RNA-protein complex and more robust .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint minigenome activity than the previously reported 6-plasmid systems, generation of this cell line entailed a time-intensive, multi-step approach that is not amenable for every emerging virus or variants of the same virus.\n\nGiven the urgent need that outbreaks of emerging viral agents pose to human health, we sought to test if the MTK could be harnessed to streamline and accelerate the generation of BSL2 reagents like the stable EBOV RNP cell lines. We synthesized the EBOV RNP genes and used the MTK multicistronic workflow with Left connector parts that encode P2A ribosomal skipping site elements to rapidly assemble a 4-cistronic construct of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV-4cis) (Fig. 7a ) directly and simultaneously into five different Part 0 destination vectors ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). These vectors provide distinct types and numbers of genome integration events ( via transposase (PiggyBac) or integrases (PhiC31, BxBI)) . Digestion followed by gel electrophoresis confirmed high cloning efficiency and correct assembly of ZEBOV-4cis in all 5 destination vectors ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). In transient transfections, all ZEBOV-4cis constructs showed no impact on cell viability and displayed levels of minigenome activity similar to the 6-plasmid system and ~40-60-fold higher activity than the cells lacking Lpol (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Fig. 5b ).\n\nWe next employed the PiggyBac transposon system to achieve high copy integration of the ZEBOV-4cis construct for a robust functional minigenome reporter readout. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with PiggyBac transposon and the PiggyBac donor construct (MTK043-ZEBOV-4cis) that contains a hygromycin marker cassette, followed by selection with hygromycin for 7 days (Fig. 7c) . This resulted in 2 independent stable populations of HEK293T cells expressing ZEBOV RNP proteins, as determined by eGFP minigenome reporter signal ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Clonal cell lines were isolated and expanded from these 2 stable .

This workflow simplified and speeded the generation of stable EBOV RNP cell lines compared to the previously reported system 27 .\n\nWe characterized the resulting EBOV RNP stable cell lines via quantitative minigenome reporter assays, protein expression and localization studies, and analysis of susceptibility to previously described small molecule inhibitors of ZEBOV RNP minigenome activity. ZEBOV-4cis stable populations and clonal cells yielded comparable nLuc minigenome reporter activity (Fig.   7d ). ZEBOV viral proteins in both the stable and clonal cell populations were readily detectable with NP and VP35 specific antibodies, and showed expression levels similar to transiently transfected ZEBOV-4cis (Fig. 7e) . Additionally, based on the presence of 2A peptide tag that remains at the C-terminus of each of these proteins following \"self-cleavage\" due to ribosome skipping, NP, VP35, and VP30 were each detectable with an antibody raised against the 2A peptide (Fig. 7e) . Larger multi-ORF fusion protein products were not readily detected with the 2A peptide antibodies, indicating efficient cleavage occurred at each of the P2A sites encoded within the ZEBOV-4cis construct. This demonstrates the added benefit that the P2A parts in the MTK provide a potential \"universal\" method to detect protein expression from multicistronic constructs. This is especially useful for analysis of novel emerging viruses or other proteins where specific antibodies are not available.\n\nImmunofluorescence analysis with VP35 and 2A antibodies show characteristic cytoplasmic punctate structures (Fig. 7f) representing inclusion bodies that are sites of virus replication [28] [29] [30] , indicating correct localization of the P2A-tagged viral proteins in these stable cell lines. Due to the lack of available specific antibodies for the Lpol and the lack of a P2A tag in the construct, the Lpol expression cannot be assayed by Western blot or immunofluorescence analysis. However, the fact that these cells support minigenome activity ( Fig. 7b and 7d) confirms that Lpol is expressed.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo further characterize the ZEBOV-4cis stable RNP cell line system, we also tested their susceptibility to previously identified EBOV small molecule inhibitors: Gedunin, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90, and 6-Azauridine, a nucleoside analog 31, 32 . ZEBOV-4cis stable cells were transfected with the ZEBOV nLuc minigenome reporter and treated with DMSO (1%, control), Gedunin (5 \u00b5M), or 6-Azauridine (5 \u00b5M) for 2 days. Luciferase assays revealed that both compounds inhibited minigenome activity by >50%, with minimal impact on cell viability (Fig.   7g ). These data indicate that the ZEBOV-4cis stable cell lines generated here are similarly susceptible to known inhibitors identified in transient RNP minigenome systems or recombinant virus systems 31, 32 . Therefore, our approach implemented through the MTK introduces a robust workflow for generating BSL2 systems for filoviruses and other viral agents as they emerge, providing a critical opportunity to implement rapid chemical compound susceptibility screens using these reagents.\n\nA key element of cellular engineering for basic science or therapeutic purposes is the ability to quickly build, test, and iterate on designs. This is currently infeasible in mammalian cells using conventional methods in molecular cloning. In this work, we presented the MTK, a platform that takes an important step to remove bottlenecks in mammalian cellular engineering.\n\nA major asset of the MTK is a large, characterized suite of modular parts to build versatile TUs.

In addition, while the MTK allows flexibility in the assembly of a wide variety of TUs, the sequence of TUs in a final multi-TU plasmid is prescribed at the TU assembly step (e.g. a TU assembled with an LS part 1 will always be the most upstream TU). Therefore, it is prudent to follow general design principles in order to maximize their repurposing 33 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint ZEBOV-4cis cell lines also exhibit susceptibility to previously identified chemical inhibitors. Thus, the MTK provides a potentially powerful tool for virologists to scale functional experimental studies apace with the recent explosive growth in viral genome sequences 34, 35 .\n\nFinally, while not explored in this work, the MTK constitutes a launching platform for additional exciting capabilities. For example, the MTK already expedites the production of sgRNA expression vectors, and with the prevalence of sgRNA screening approaches, we envision incorporating barcoding capabilities that can be read by bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies [36] [37] [38] . Furthermore, within the current MTK framework all TUs are read in the same direction. However, it is conceivable to design connector parts (1 and 5) that reverse the orientation of a TU to enable more autonomy in genetic circuit design and optimize transcriptional efficiency 33 . Lastly, the emergence of robotics and high-throughput liquid handling promises an exciting future avenue leveraging automation to streamline assembly. Overall, the MTK represents a significant advancement in cloning infrastructure to further expedite the growth, applications and scope of biological research and biotechnology.

An Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS was used to detect the images and pixel size was 325nm. \n\nGedunin (CAS 2753-30-2) (Fisher Scientific # 33871) and 6-Azauridine (Sigma # A1882-1G) were resuspended in DMSO to generate a 1mM stock solution. Stock solutions were serially diluted in DMSO and media to treat cells with a final concentration of 5\u00b5M in 1% DMSO.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/506188 doi: bioRxiv preprint transfected cells were seeded into 8 wells of 96-well plates for 2 days in duplicates. Nano luciferase assays for minigenome function and cell titer glo assays for cell viability were performed as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For minigenome assays in ZEBOV-4cis stable cells, 500 ng each of p2.0-T7-3E5E-nLuc or p2.0-T7-3E5E-eGFP and 500ng of T7-expression plasmid were co-transfected. Nano luciferase levels were assayed as above and eGFP signal was captured via microscopy (Leica, 4X magnification).
