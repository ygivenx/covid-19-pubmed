{"title": "Prevention of Cytotoxic T Cell Escape Using a Heteroclitic Subdominant Viral T Cell Determinant", "body": "Despite the antigenic complexity of microbes, primary pathogen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are commonly directed to just one or a few determinants. Furthermore, even when multiple epitopes are targeted, distinct patterns of epitope hierarchy often emerge. Such immunodominant epitopes commonly elicit high-magnitude CTL responses characterized by potent cytolytic function, whereas subdominant determinants generate responses that are relatively lower in magnitude and often less efficacious. In general, potent anti-viral CTL strongly correlate with control of infection and less clinical disease. Viral progeny selected on the basis of CTL surveillance can evolve to evade T cell responses. This selective pressure results in mutations in immunodominant CTL determinants that abrogate recognition. CTL escape virus is commonly observed in humans and nonhuman primates infected with HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its selection often correlates with disease progression [1]\u2013[4]. Escape mutations may diminish binding to the restricting MHC class I molecule, interfere with T cell receptor (TcR) recognition or interfere with antigen processing [5]\u2013[7]. Escape mutations are usually detected in epitopes targeted by CTL that exhibit high functional avidity because the corresponding potent CTL response exerts high selective pressure on the virus [2]. In some HIV-infected patients, CTL escape occurs without an associated enhancement of virus replication, suggesting that the mutations compromised virus fitness or, alternatively, the variant determinant elicited a de novo CTL response [8],[9]. Virus fitness is sometimes restored, with concomitant increased virus replication, when a second, compensatory mutation is selected [10],[11]. Collectively these results suggest that given the importance of virus diversification (CTL escape) in disease progression, suppression of selection or outgrowth of CTL escape variants should improve outcomes in persistently infected animals and humans.\n\nModulating the immunogenicity of subdominant CTL determinants could potentially lead to the development of more efficacious vaccines that are more broadly protective and prevent or minimize the appearance of variant viruses that have mutated in dominant epitopes targeted by high-avidity CTL responses. Enhancement strategies, which result in augmented responses to the native, subdominant epitope, have been described for both MHC class I and class II-restricted determinants, whereby the most common approaches involve generating a series of conserved and non-conserved mutations at MHC anchor residues, followed by an empiric determination of whether each individual substitution augments T cell effector function [12]. Furthermore, evaluating the effect of epitope enhancement in vivo has generally been achieved via heterologous infection systems [13]\u2013[15]. Thus, while these results demonstrate proof of principle, direct evidence for enhanced protection against autologous microbial infection in vivo is lacking. The design of heteroclitic determinants in which non-MHC anchor residues are targeted for substitution are also usually determined empirically. Studies of heteroclitic tumor epitopes have demonstrated the clinical utility of such determinants [16],[17]. Notably, however, there are no well defined examples of viral epitopes which demonstrate enhanced immunity and the molecular basis for the enhanced immunogenicity is not well understood.\n\nPotential interventions to directly manipulate host-pathogen interactions and thereby diminish CTL escape variant selection are often difficult to evaluate since most examples of CTL escape occur in infected humans or non-human primates. By contrast, mice persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM (JHMV) serve as a useful system for investigating anti-viral CTL responses and CTL escape [18]\u2013[20]. Two JHMV-derived CTL epitopes are recognized in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The immunodominant H-2Db-restricted CTL epitope (S510, CSLWNGPHL, spanning residues 510\u2013518 of the Spike (S) glycoprotein) elicits a high-magnitude, high-avidity CTL response that drives virus diversification during persistent infection [18]\u2013[22]. A second subdominant CTL epitope, S598 (H-2Kb-restricted, RCQIFANI, spanning residues 598\u2013605 of the S glycoprotein) also elicits an appreciable CTL response [21]; however, S598-specific CTL exhibit \u223c100-fold lower functional avidity and do not protect from CTL escape in S510. The presence of a readily mutable dominant and a subdominant epitope with high and low functional avidity, respectively, in JHMV-infected mice is useful for investigating both epitope enhancement and approaches to diminishing CTL escape. Consistent with this notion, we have previously shown that the introduction of a second dominant CD8 T cell epitope into the JHMV genome (GP33 from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)) protected mice from the development of CTL escape in S510 and enhanced virus clearance [22].\n\nHere we determined whether the CD8 T cell response to S598 could be enhanced so that it now elicited a more potent T cell response that protected mice against the development of CTL escape at S510 and subsequent clinical disease. We modified epitope S598 (S598Q600Y) such that it elicited a high-avidity CTL response and using the crystal structures of the H-2Kb/S598 and H-2Kb/S598Q600Y complexes, determined the basis of this enhanced immune response. We then introduced this more immunogenic S598 epitope into a recombinant version of JHMV and showed that these high-avidity S598-specific CTLs protected against escape variants in the immunodominant S510 epitope. Immunization with the modified peptide resulted in an improved response to the native S598 epitope, demonstrating a true heteroclitic effect and suggesting that this strategy may have clinical applications for reducing viral titer and preventing CTL escape during chronic infections.\n\nAs we have previously observed with other MHC/Cys-containing peptide complexes [19],[23], complexes did not readily form unless the cysteine of the S598 peptide (RCQIFANI) was modified with L-\u03b1-aminobutyric acid (Aba, an isostereomer of cysteine). The Aba-modified peptides maintained immunogenicity since a higher frequency of splenic CD8+ T cells from JHMV-immune mice reacted to Aba-modified S598 peptide, relative to unmodified S598 peptide (\nFigure S1A\n).\n\nNext, we used the consensus H-2Kb binding motif [24] to engineer a novel, high-avidity S598 CTL epitope. Importantly, Gln-3 diverges from the consensus H-2Kb-restricted ligand binding motif, in which a tyrosine is often present at position 3 [24],[25]. Therefore, we substituted a glutamine residue for tyrosine (Q600Y, CAA to TAT, RCYIFANI) at position 3 of the determinant with the aim of creating a peptide that bound more tightly to H-2Kb. Stability of the H-2Kb/S598 and H-2Kb/S598Q600Y complexes was assessed by circular dichroism (CD). As shown in \nFigure 1\n, H-2Kb/S598Q600Y was considerably more thermostable than the native complex (Tm 54\u00b0C vs 64\u00b0C). To probe the biological properties of the Q600Y substitution, we used reverse genetics to engineer a recombinant version of JHMV expressing the S598Q600Y epitope (\nFigure 2A\n). Recombinant viruses encoding this substitution replicated as efficiently as wild type JHMV (rJ) in vitro during one-step growth kinetics analyses and in vivo virus competition assays (\nFigure 2B, C\n). The immunogenicity of S598Q600Y was assessed by intracellular expression of IFN-\u03b3 by central nervous system (CNS)-derived lymphocytes. Since Cys-containing peptides are often diminished in ability to elicit a CTL response, we included a reducing agent (TCEP, Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine) in the cultures. TCEP enhanced the stimulatory capacity of the S598 peptides (\nFigure S1B\n), indicating that a proportion of the unmodified S598 peptide stock had undergone oxidation. Thus, we stimulated CNS- and spleen-derived CTL ex vivo in the presence of 500 \u00b5M TCEP, a concentration consistent with other work with Cys containing peptides [23],[26].\n\nThe S598Q600Y epitope elicited a CTL response in the CNS of rJ.SQ600Y infected mice, with nearly 30% of all CD8 T cells recognizing the determinant (\nFigure 2D\n). In addition, CTL primed by S598Q600Y cross-reacted with the native S598 determinant. The converse was not true, however, as cells primed by the native epitope failed to produce IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated with S598Q600Y peptide (\nFigure 2D\n). Of note, the CTL response to the dominant Db-restricted S510 epitope in rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice was diminished relative to responses in mice infected with wildtype rJ virus (\nFigure 2D, E\n).\n\nNext, we assessed the relative functional avidity of CTL populations primed by native S598 and S598Q600Y determinants, as a surrogate measure of the potency of the anti-virus CTL response in vivo. CNS-derived mononuclear cells were harvested from mice infected with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y and examined for IFN-\u03b3 expression after stimulation ex vivo in the presence of 10-fold dilutions of the appropriate peptide. Cells primed to the native S598 epitope (cells harvested from rJ-infected mice) required approximately 100-fold more peptide than did S598Q600Y-primed cells to elicit a half maximal response (100 nM vs. 1 nM, \nFigure 3A,B\n).\n\nBecause we observed that a subpopulation of S598Q600Y-primed cells cross-reacted with the native determinant, we next determined whether this subpopulation also exhibited high functional avidity. For this purpose, we isolated cells from the CNS of rJ- and rJ.SQ600Y-infected adult B6 mice and stimulated them with 10-fold dilutions of native S598 peptide. S598Q600Y-primed cross-reacting cells exhibited 7-fold higher functional avidity, relative to those primed by the native determinant (\nFigure 3C, D\n) and are therefore distinct from CTL primed by the native S598 determinant. Consistent with the presence of a distinct population of cells, there were modest differences in V\u03b2 chain utilization when total populations from rJ and rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice and when total and cross-reacting cell populations from rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice (\nFigure S2\n) were compared. In all instances, V\u03b25.1/5.2 expression was relatively over-represented, but some V\u03b2 elements were preferentially utilized by specific responding populations (V\u03b211, V\u03b213 and V\u03b214). Also consistent with this observation, alanine scanning mutagenesis of the two determinants revealed that the CTL response to each cognate peptide following infection was also subtly different reflecting the altered repertoire. The CTL response to each cognate peptide was very sensitive to mutation at every position except 2 and 9 although mutations in the S598Q600Y determinant were tolerated slightly better than changes in the S598 epitope (\nFigure S2C\u2013E\n).\n\nIf CTL recognizing S598Q600Y exhibit high functional avidity in vivo, they should protect from CTL escape in S510 and might select for S598Q600Y CTL escape variants. Diversification at S510 is observed in pups infected with neurovirulent JHMV at 10 days of age and nursed by JHMV-immune dams [27]. These mice are largely protected from developing acute lethal encephalitis, but a variable percentage (30\u201390%) later develop a demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Infectious virus isolated from these mice with late onset clinical disease is mutated in S510, resulting in enhanced virus replication [20], with demyelination occurring during the process of virus clearance [28]. Thus, we next infected maternal antibody-protected suckling mice with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y viruses and monitored persistently infected mice for the development of clinical signs for 60 days post infection (p.i.). The presence of the highly immunogenic S598Q600Y epitope did not protect mice from acute encephalitis (\nFigure 3E\n), perhaps because the presence of the improved S598 epitope was accompanied by a diminished response to S510 (\nFigure 2D\n). However, we found that among survivors (defined as survival past day 14 p.i.) there was a significant reduction in the incidence of clinical disease as well as in the development of CTL escape in S510 (\nTable 1\n). Additionally, S598Q600Y did not undergo CTL escape in mice persistently infected with rJ.SQ600Y, even though single nucleotide changes in the region of the S glycoprotein gene encoding the S598 determinant could potentially result in fifty-one CTL escape mutations. Thus, as expected, the \u201cimproved\u201d S598Q600Y epitope was protective in vivo in infected mice, likely because S598Q600Y-specific CTL are present in higher numbers and exhibit higher functional avidity than the native S598-specific response.\n\nSince this lack of mutation at S598Q600Y might reflect enhanced suppression of virus replication mediated by co-dominant CTL responses directed against S510 and S598Q600Y, we developed a recombinant virus encoding S598Q600Y in the context of a common S510 CTL escape mutation, S510W513R (rJ.SW513R+Q600Y, \n\nFigure 2A\n). The CTL response is predicted to be largely directed at S598Q600Y in mice infected with this virus. The W513R mutation (position 4 substitution in S510 epitope, CSLRNGPHL) occurs in 13% of all CTL escape variants [19],[20],[22],[29],[30], and completely abrogates native S510 CTL recognition [31]. We verified that virus-specific CTL responses were focused on S598Q600Y in adult B6 mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y (\nFigure 3F\n). To examine the phenotype of the S598Q600Y/S510W513R double mutant, we infected antibody-protected suckling B6 mice with this virus and appropriate controls and monitored mice for survival (\nFigure 3G\n). As expected, 93.3% of mice infected with rJ survived the acute infection (day 0\u201314 p.i.). All mice infected with rJ.SW513R developed fatal encephalitis but, in marked contrast, 66.6% of mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y survived. We also found that survival correlated with virus clearance (\nFigure 3H\n). Relative to rJ-infected mice, replication was suppressed in mice infected with virus encoding the S598Q600Y epitope and greatly elevated in mice infected with rJ.SW513R. In mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y, virus titers were intermediate between rJ and rJ.SW513R. Thus, the presence of the heteroclitic S598Q600Y determinant contributed to suppression of virus replication and to increased survival, even when the high-magnitude, high-avidity CTL response to S510 was largely abrogated.\n\nSurprisingly, S598Q600Y still did not undergo sequence diversification in mice that survived the rJ.SW513R+Q600Y infection (\nTable 2\n). This result was unexpected, as the majority of CTL in the rJ.SW513R+Q600Y-infected CNS specifically target the S598Q600Y determinant and exhibit high functional avidity (\nFigure 3A\u2013C\n). One possible explanation for this result is that S598 is not as plastic as S510, even though both determinants are derived from a region of the spike gene that is hypervariable and even deleted in some strains of MHV [32].\n\nTo determine whether cells primed to S598Q600Y that cross-react with the native S598 determinant were more protective in vivo than S598-primed cells, we vaccinated mice with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) alone, or BMDC pulsed with peptides corresponding to S598 or S598Q600Y (\nFigure 4\n). Seven days later, mice were challenged via intranasal inoculation of 4\u00d7104 PFU of wild type, non-recombinant JHMV. Similar to results observed following rJ.SQ600Y infection (\nFigure 3\n), CTL primed via DC-S598Q600Y vaccination exhibited higher functional avidity when reacted against the native S598 determinant when compared to those arising after DC-S598 vaccination (\n\nFigure 4A\n\n). In other experiments, we examined the survival of mice vaccinated with each determinant, but we observed no significant differences between groups (data not shown), probably because mortality is largely CD4 T cell-mediated in adult mice with acute encephalitis [33],[34]. In terms of virus titers, vaccination with either the native or enhanced S598 determinants resulted in \u223c70\u201380% reduction in virus burden compared to mice that received un-pulsed BMDC (\nFigure 4B\n). When we examined the frequency and numbers of virus-specific CTL in the CNS of these same mice, we detected markedly fewer S598-specific CTL in the CNS of mice that received BMDC pulsed with S598Q600Y peptides (\nFigure 4C\n). Calculation of the product of virus titers and CTL numbers within individual mice, as an approximate measure of CTL potency, indicated that the S598-specific CTL in S598Q600Y-coated BMDC vaccinees were \u223c6-7-fold more efficacious on a per cell basis (\nFigure 4D\n). Thus, S598-specific CTL induced by the S598Q600Y determinant show similar enhancement in function compared to S598-primed cells, whether measured in vitro (\nFigure 3C,D\n) or in vivo (\nFigure 4D\n).\n\nWhile these studies clearly demonstrated that S598Q600Y is heteroclitic, they did not provide a mechanism for the immune enhancement. To address this, we determined the crystal structures of the H-2Kb/S598 (PDBid 2ZSV, Protein Data Bank Japan (http://www.pdbj.org/)) and H-2Kb/S598Q600Y (PDBid 2ZSW) complexes to 1.8 \u00c5 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolution respectively. The structure of H-2Kb/S598 consists of two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (r.m.s.d. of 0.18 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms), with the S598 peptide clearly bound in the antigen binding cleft of the heavy chains (HC, \nFigure S3A\n). The two peptide copies display a virtually identical configuration with root mean square deviation (rmsd) values of only 0.09 \u00c5 for all peptide atoms (0.05 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms). The mode of S598 and S598Q600Y binding within the Ag-binding cleft is unambiguous, with the exception of Arg-1, whose side chain is partially disordered (\nFigure 5A,D\n\n\n; Figure S3C\n). The S598 peptide adopts an extended conformation, with the side chains of Arg-1, Ile-4 and Asn-7 extending prominently out of the cleft (\nFigure 5C\n). Ala-6 is also largely solvent exposed with its side chain pointing towards the \u03b12 helix, while the side chains of Cys (Aba)-2, Gln-3, Phe-5 and Ile-8 are buried within the cleft. While the cysteine analogue's side chain is not involved in any hydrophilic interactions, there are a number of suitably positioned hydrogen bonding partners (Glu-24, Tyr-45 and Asn-70), with which the original thiol side chain could potentially interact (Figure S3B; Table S2).\n\nIn addition to main chain interactions across the length of the peptide, S598 is anchored to the MHC via the side chains of Gln-3, Phe-5 and Ile-8. Gln-3 forms hydrogen bonds with the Ser-99 and Gln-114 of the HC (\n\nFigure 5B\n\n), while Phe-5 and Ile-8 are buried within hydrophobic pockets. In addition, the side chains of Phe-5 and Gln-3 pack against each other and between the aromatic rings of HC residues Tyr-159 and Phe-74, constraining the peptide's backbone conformation at those positions.\n\nThe structure of H-2Kb/S598Q600Y consists of four heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (rmsd of 0.09 \u00c5 for heavy chain (HC) C\u03b1's), the four copies of the peptide adopting virtually identical conformations (rmsd of 0.12 \u00c5 for all peptide atoms and 0.05 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms). S598Q600Y displays the same conformation as the S598 determinant (the average rmsd for peptide C\u03b1 atoms between the two structures is 0.24 \u00c5) and forms equivalent interactions with the MHC. The only prominent structural difference is observed at the mutated position (Q3\u2192Y3) (\nFigure 5B,E\n\n, \n\n6A,B\n). In contrast to Gln-3, the Tyr-3 side chain is oriented towards the \u03b1-2 helix rather than the floor of the cleft. Consequently, the interactions with Ser-99 and Gln-114 of the HC are lost and instead the tyrosine's hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu-152 (\nFigure 5E\n). The side chain of Tyr-3 also forms a number of close contacts with the residues in its immediate environment, specifically HC residues Gln-114, Arg-155, Leu-156 and Tyr-159, as well as intramolecular interactions with Phe-5 (\nTable S2\n). In addition to Tyr-3, deviations of potential significance (>0.5 \u00c5) in the peptide structures that are attributable to the Q660Y mutation are observed at Ile-4 and Phe-5.\n\nOverall the S598 determinant displays greater complementarity for the antigen binding cleft of H-2Kb in its N-terminal region, with few stabilizing interactions observed between the HC and positions 6 and 7. (Figure S3B, D; Table S2). Nevertheless, a pocket is observed between the \u03b1-2 helix and the peptide near position 3 in the index structure that is filled by the steric bulk of Tyr-3 in the Q600Y structure (\n\nFigure 5C,F\n\n). This increase in surface complementarity and the greater number of observed interactions resulting from the Q3\u2192Y3 mutation would account for the enhanced thermostability (\u223c10\u00b0C) measured for the H-2Kb/S598Q600Y\u2013Aba complex by circular dichroism (\nFigure 1\n). This increase in complementarity of the MHC for S598Q600Y and the greater stability of the resulting complex were predicted from comparisons of the WT determinant complex with existing structures of H-2Kb bound with peptides similar to S598 and possessing the consensus tyrosine anchor residue at position 3, as well as another aromatic residue at position 5.\n\nWith respect to the HC, the \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-2 domains of the two structures superimpose well with an rmsd of 0.37 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms (residues 1\u2013176). Nevertheless, significant deviations (>0.5 \u00c5) are observed between the two structures at a number of positions in the region of the antigen binding cleft. In particular, changes in the conformation of Ser-99, Gln-114, and Gly-151-Glu-154 are associated with the bound peptides. Changes in the side chain conformations of Ser-99 and Gln-114 in the Q600Y complex structure are consistent with the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions with position 3. In the wild type peptide structure, Glu-152 forms a salt bridge with Arg-155, the guanadinium group of which also forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl group of the peptide's Ile-4. While these interactions are maintained in the Q600Y complex, the side chain of Glu-152 displays a conformational shift consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond with the peptide's Tyr-3 (\nFigure 6\n). Interestingly the region of the \u03b1-2 helix around Glu-152 (Gly-151 - Glu-154) also displays significant main chain and side chain deviations between the two structures (rmsd of 0.77 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms; \nFigure 6\n). Thus, consistent with the functional analyses, the structure of the heteroclitic variant of the S598 epitope displays relatively small changes in conformation yet the combination of these subtle changes in the TcR accessible residues and the structural landscape of the MHCp in addition to the enhanced stability of the complex lead to more efficacious CTL responses.\n\nWe describe the identification of a heteroclitic determinant that enhances recognition by virus-specific CD8 T cells, and use the crystal structure of the new determinant (S598Q600Y) to provide a basis why it elicits an enhanced CTL response. Comparison of S598 to the consensus binding motif suggested a suboptimal interaction with the H-2Kb molecule at the secondary anchor position (Gln-3) and, consequently, an approach to enhance the immunogenicity of the determinant. Replacement of the Gln-3 with Tyr-3 (Q600Y) did, indeed, result in an determinant with increased thermostability without diminishing the CD8 T cell response. Most strikingly, the Q600Y change resulted in subtle changes in the conformation of the \u03b1-2 helix locally in the vicinity of Glu-152. These subtle changes are likely critical for the enhanced TcR recognition that we detected.\n\nS598Q600Y elicited a response with higher functional avidity to both the cognate and native determinants than S598, and this was not reflected in differential V\u03b2 usage. The T cell response to S598 in rJ-infected mice is very diverse [35]. As assessed by V\u03b2 usage, the response to S598 and S598Q600Y in rJ.S598Q600Y was similarly diverse with only modest differences noted when cells from mice primed by S598 and S598Q600Y were compared. While we cannot exclude the possibility that cross-reacting S598-specific cells primed by S598Q600Y are biased for V\u03b2 chains not analyzed in this study, it is more likely that the fine specificity of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) determines their greater affinity for H-2Kb/S598. Although an increase in stability of the MHC class I/peptide complex is not generally expected to enhance TcR affinity for the complex, similar results have been observed in mice immunized with analogues to a common tumor antigen [36].\n\nOne unexpected result was that S598 exhibited both low MHC class I and low TcR avidity. Previous studies showed that this determinant exhibited low functional avidity [21], but it was not known whether this reflected low binding to the MHC class I or to the TcR. Assuming that low affinity for MHC class I results in a low effective concentration of H-2Kb/S598 complex on the cell surface, the responding T cells should be high avidity, based, primarily, on in vitro studies [37]. While the relationship between level of surface peptide and avidity of the responding T cells generated in vivo is not as clearcut [38], there is no obvious explanation for how a peptide with low MHC class I binding also elicits a low avidity T cell response. This selection of only a subset of CD8 T cells capable of responding to S598 may partly explain why S598-primed cells do not recognize the Q600Y determinant.\n\nThe biological significance of the heteroclitic Q600Y determinant was shown by its ability to protect JHMV-infected mice from CTL escape at S510 and to diminish clinical disease. This was important to demonstrate because other studies, using tumor models, have shown that immunogenicity and tumor recognition are not necessarily concordant [39]. Mutations resulting in CTL escape occur most commonly in determinants that are exposed to high selective pressure [40]\u2013[42] and outgrowth of CTL escape variants is efficiently suppressed by effective and rapid virus clearance [43]\u2013[46], as occurs in mice infected with rJ.SQ600Y. Thus, even though CTL escape is not detected in normal mice infected with LCMV or influenza, escape does occur when mice transgenic for a single LCMV-specific TcR are infected with high amounts of virus [44],[47]. Under these conditions, the immune response is highly focused on a single CD8 T cell determinant and virus replication continues for extended periods of time, facilitating mutation at the targeted determinant.\n\nIn mice infected with wild type JHMV, the CTL response is functionally focused on S510 [21]; the Q600Y substitution effectively prevents CTL escape at either S510 or S598Q600Y by the induction of a second high avidity CTL response. Mutations in S598Q600Y were not detected even when the CTL response was directed primarily at this determinant (e.g. mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y). Consistent with this inability to readily tolerate mutations, we were unable to generate recombinant virus mutated in position Ile-4 (I601D,E,K,R,T) and recombinant virus mutated at Phe-5 (F602A) was highly attenuated (data not shown). The combination of induction of high avidity CTL and inability to tolerate mutation without adversely affecting virus fitness make S598Q600Y an ideal target for the anti-JHMV CTL response. Further, the ala scanning results suggest that S598Q600Y-specific CTLs may more readily tolerate changes in the H-2Kb/peptide complex, and this plasticity would also minimize the likelihood of CTL escape. In contrast, we have previously shown that introduction of the LCMV-specific GP33 determinant, which also elicits CTL with high functional avidity, into JHMV greatly diminished clinical disease but did not prevent CTL escape [22]. The GP33 determinant was introduced at a site in the genome that tolerated mutation and deletion and intact determinant was no longer present in virus by day 20 p.i. Collectively these results suggest that a response to a second determinant that elicits CTL exhibiting high functional avidity at early times p.i. results in enhanced suppression of virus replication, but its presence throughout the infection is required to protect against CTL escape.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that crystal structures are useful in gaining an understanding of the basis of heteroclitic epitopes and can also prove valuable in guiding the rational design of \u201cbetter\u201d CTL epitopes. In our mouse system, immunization with the heteroclitic determinant resulted in the generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to an otherwise modestly immunogenic viral epitope. The generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to weakly immunogenic epitopes will be useful for the treatment and prevention of human infectious diseases. Our proposed structure-guided approach has direct application to HIV, HCV and other chronic infections in which virus persistence and CTL escape occurs. By modulating T cell immunity through prophylactic or therapeutic peptide-based vaccination, virus titers may be reduced and CTL escape and other consequences of viral persistence circumvented.\n\nSpecific pathogen-free B6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). To obtain infected mice in which CTL escape at S510 was detected, suckling B6 mice were infected intranasally with 2\u20134\u00d7104 PFU of recombinant JHMV at 10 days of age and nursed by dams that were immunized with JHMV, as described previously [27]. For experiments comparing multiple JHMV variants, each litter served as an internal control: equal numbers of pups were infected with rJ and one to three recombinant variant viruses, depending on litter size. All animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nMononuclear cells were harvested from the brains of acutely ill mice 7 days p.i. and analyzed for expression of IFN-\u03b3 by an intracellular cytokine staining protocol as previously described [28]. Unless otherwise noted, peptides corresponding to epitopes were used at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M and cells were stimulated in the presence of 500 \u00b5M TCEP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Data sets were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc, Ashland, OR). All antibodies and reagents were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA).\n\nRecombinant wild-type and S510 and S598 variants of JHMV were generated as previously described [48],[49]. Briefly, overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate the S598Q600Y and S510W513R variants. Primers that overlapped the glutamine at residue 600 of the spike glycoprotein were (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) Q600Y fwd, ATGATCGCTGCTATATTTTTGCTAACATATTG; Q600Y rev, AATATGTTAGCAAAAATATAGCAGCGATCAT. Primers that overlapped the tryptophan at residue 513 were (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) W513R fwd, GTGAGTGTTCTCTTCGGAATGGGCCCCATTTGCGCTCGGC; W513R rev, AGCGCAAATGGGGCCCATTCCGAAGAGAACACTCAC. The outer primers for each targeted change were fwd, TGTTGATTGCGCCAGCAGCTACATTAG; and rev, ACCTACGGATTGAACGCTATCATTGAC. Underlined nucleotides correspond to the nucleotides encoding the Gln to Tyr and Trp to Arg substitutions within S598 and S510, respectively. Recombinant viruses encoding the variant epitope(s) were selected, propagated and titered as previously described [49]. At least two independent isolates of each recombinant virus were analyzed.\n\nVirus was inoculated onto confluent 17Cl-1 monolayers in a 12-well plate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. Groups of cells were harvested at the indicated time points and total virus (cell-associated and cell-free) was titered as previously described [27].\n\nEqual PFU (2\u20134\u00d7104) of rJ and rJ.SQ600Y were combined and inoculated intranasally into 5-week-old B6 and BALB/c mice. Total RNA was harvested from the brains of mice 7 days p.i. and the relative representation of WT (wild type) versus variant template was determined by RT-PCR and sequencing. This assay can specifically detect a given species of template when that species comprises at least 20% of a heterogeneous pool [50]. Primers used were (5\u2032-3\u2032): forward, AACCCCTCGTCTTGGAATAGGAGGTATGG; and reverse, CCTACGGATTGAACGCTATCATTGACTAAC. PCR products were sequenced directly by the University of Iowa DNA Core.\n\nFor alanine scanning, cells were stimulated ex vivo with the indicated concentration of native or variant peptide and stained for CD8 and IFN-\u03b3 as described above. Data were normalized to the frequency of cells that reacted to the unmodified S598 or S598Q600Y peptides. For functional avidity determination, mononuclear cells were harvested from the brains of rJ or rJ.S598Q600Y-infected mice 7 days p.i. and stimulated ex vivo in the presence of EL-4 cells pulsed with tenfold dilutions of peptide corresponding to native S598 or S598Q600Y epitopes. After 5.5 hours, cells were stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 as described above. For each epitope-specific population, data were normalized to the frequency of antigen-specific CTL detected using the highest titration of peptide (1 \u00b5M).\n\nCD spectra were measured on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter using a thermostatically controlled cuvette at temperatures between 30 and 90\u00b0C. Far-UV spectra were collected and analyzed as described [23].\n\nCells were harvested from the CNS of mice 7 days p.i. and stimulated ex vivo with S598 or S598Q600Y peptides. Cell aliquots were subsequently stained for CD8 (PE-Cy7-anti-CD8\u03b1) and V\u03b2 (FITC-anti-V\u03b22, 3, 4, 5.1/5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10b, 11, 12, 13 or 14, BD-Pharmingen) followed by intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3 (PE-anti-IFN-\u03b3). Data were collected using a Becton Dickinson LSR II instrument at the University of Iowa Flow Cytometry Facility. Data are expressed as the proportion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells that express each V\u03b2 chain.\n\nTotal RNA was purified with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from the CNS of mice. The 1055 base pair region of the spike glycoprotein encompassing both S510 and S598 was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced directly as previously described [19].\n\nBone marrow-derived DC were prepared, pulsed with peptides and injected into mice as previously described [51]. Briefly, 5\u00d7105 LPS-matured DC were left uncoated, coated with S598 or S598Q600Y peptides and injected via tail vein into groups of 4-week-old mice. Seven days following DC-vaccination, mice were infected intranasally with 4\u00d7104 PFU of JHMV. Seven days following virus infection, brains were harvested from mice and the frequencies of epitope-specific CD8 T cells were determined by ex vivo stimulation and intracellular cytokine staining as described above. In independent studies, DC-S598 and DC-S598Q600Y priming was verified by harvesting spleens from several mice seven days following DC-vaccination.\n\nCrystals of H-2KbS598-Aba were grown at 21\u00b0C in 0.1 M cacodylate pH 6.6, 16% PEG (polyethylene glycol) 8,000, 0.2 M Ca(OAc)2, using a protein concentration of 9 mg/ml. Crystals were cryoprotected by stepwise equilibration against mother liquor containing 5, 10 and 15% glycerol and flash frozen by placing in a nitrogen stream. A 1.8 \u00c5 resolution dataset was collected on an in-house X-ray source. Crystals of H-2KbS598Q600Y-Aba were grown at 21\u00b0C in 0.1 M cacodylate pH 6.5, 13% PEG 8,000, 0.2 M Ca(OAc)2, using a protein concentration of 6 mg/ml. Crystals were cryoprotected by gradual equilibration against mother liquor containing 20% PEG 8,000 and 5% glycerol before flash freezing. A 2.8 \u00c5 resolution dataset was collected on an in-house source. The WT data were integrated in MOSFLM\n[52] and scaled/merged using SCALA\n[53]. The Q600Y variant data were processed using HKL2000. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement in PHASER\n[54], against previously solved H-2Kb complexes (PDBid's: 1G7Q and 1RJY, respectively). The resultant models underwent iterative cycles of refinement in PHENIX\n[55] and, REFMAC5\n[56] (restrained and TLS refinement) followed by model building/correction in COOT\n[57]. The solvent structures were built using ARP/wARP\n[58] and COOT. A summary of the processing and refinement statistics is presented in Table S1.\n\nStatistical significance was determined by nonpaired, two-sided Student's t test or chi-squared test, where indicated."}
