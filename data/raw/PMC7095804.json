{"title": "Transmission catalog proposed to help combat zoonotic diseases", "body": "Approximately three-quarters of emerging infectious diseases in humans arise by cross-species transfer2. One of the most famous examples of such a zoonotic pathogen is HIV, which is thought to have spread to humans after hunters and butchers in Africa came into contact with the meat of primates infected with SIV, a closely related simian virus. However, monkeys and apes are only one potential reservoir for new human diseases. Just last month, for example, scientists pinpointed camels as the direct source of the virus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome3,4, a new disease that has claimed more than 300 lives since it was discovered in 2012. Bats, rodents and various other mammals host a large number of emerging diseases, too.\n\nLast year, a team led by disease ecologist Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance, a conservation organization headquartered in New York, reported in mBio the results of an exhaustive survey of all the viruses hosted by a single fruit bat species, the Indian flying fox, which is known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens. The researchers\u2014including Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, and Jonna Mazet, executive director of the One Health Institute at the University of California\u2013Davis\u2014extrapolated those results and came up with a minimum estimate of 320,000 mammalian viruses that await discovery, any of which could conceivably be responsible for the next human pandemic5. They called for a targeted surveillance program \u201cto identify agents that pose zoonotic risks before they emerge in people.\u201d\n\nGoldberg applauds the strategy put forward in the mBio paper, noting that the authors' estimated price tag of chronicling all mammalian viruses\u2014$6.3 billion\u2014is still far less than the economic impact of containing even a single pandemic like SARS, which researchers estimate cost the global economy close to $40 billion in 2003 alone6. But Goldberg emphasizes the need to focus on how the diseases spread: \u201cI'm deeply excited by pathogen discovery\u2014I love it and I do it in my lab\u2014but I think it needs a complementary approach from the ecological and social sciences,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cWe should strive to ramp up pathway discovery now that we are in this golden age of pathogen discovery. Together, the two approaches will give us the information we really need.\u201d\n\nJonna Mazet says that she \u201ctotally agree[s]\u201d with Goldberg's suggested focus on pathway discovery. \u201cI think it's provocative and hopefully evocative to get things moving.\u201d But, she argues, \u201cwe've been doing it for five years.\u201d\n\nMazet is the principal investigator of PREDICT, a $75 million, five-year project established in 2009 by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) that focuses on, among other things, characterizing the human and ecological drivers of disease spillover from animals to people. USAID is now planning a $100 million follow-up effort, PREDICT-2; applications to lead the project were due last month.\n\nBut whereas PREDICT and other epidemiological efforts have concentrated on characterizing the risks of known zoonotic pathogens and emerging new ones, \u201cmy idea is different,\u201d Goldberg stresses, because of his unique focus on identifying all transmission pathways that could be potentially used in the future, not just those observed today. \u201cJust as we are being proactive about finding new pathogens before they emerge, so, too, should we be proactive about finding new pathways before they are traversed,\u201d Goldberg says.\n\nAccording to James Holland Jones, a biological anthropologist at Stanford University in California, this will require a heightened focus on the social, cultural and environmental determinants of disease transmission, such as changes in land use that encroach on wildlife habitat or that bring animals into closer proximity with people. \u201cSpillover events are ultimately driven by human behavior,\u201d he says, \u201cand we far too often ignore what engineers would call the 'human factors'.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a return to first principles,\u201d notes Paul Gibbs, a veterinarian and virologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Gibbs cites the 160-year-old demonstration by John Snow that contaminated water was the cause of a deadly cholera outbreak in London in 1854, a time before the 'germ theory of disease' had even been developed. \u201c[Snow] didn't even know what the agent was, but he looked at pathways and he looked at how society were moving in London, where they got their water from and, somewhat apocryphally now, he was reported to have taken the pump handle off,\u201d Gibbs says. \u201cThat is pathway discovery.\u201d"}
