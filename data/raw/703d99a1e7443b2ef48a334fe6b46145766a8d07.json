A fusion protein, human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin (hCTLA4Ig) was strongly induced by sugar starvation using rice alpha-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter in transgenic rice cell suspension cultures. Nevertheless, there are some considerations which this inducible promoter system caused cell death because of sugar depletion during production phase. Delay of the production due to existence of the residual sugar was an indispensable problem during the induction period by medium exchange in bioreactor. In addition, loss of productivity associated with scale-up in flasks or bioreactors was related with hydrodynamic stress. In this study, the effects of inoculation methods and flask size on production of hCTLA4Ig were confirmed. Different flask sizes (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 L) and inoculation methods (suspension and filtered cells) were applied to investigate their effects during production phase in Erlenmeyer flasks. It was found that the volume ratio of spent medium containing residual sugar and settled cells, and flask size specifically influenced hCTLA4Ig expression pattern, cell viability and protease activity. In conclusion, it was essential to minimize the residual sugar in suspensions and hydrodynamic stress by scale-up for the enhancement of the production with RAmy3D promoter system. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is coronavirus and a causative agent for diarrhea in pigs, particularly in neonates. The propagation of the PEDV in cell culture was developed in 1988. PED disease vaccine is produced from Vero cells by using lively attenuated virus strain (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . Industrially important viruses such as viral vaccines have been typically produced using anchorage-dependent cell lines in host cell culture systems (Lee et al., 1995) . The accumulation of ammonium ion in culture media is inevitable because ammonium ion is excreted as a byproduct of glutamine metabolism which is essential to mammalian cells. The inhibitory effect of ammonium ion is common to most animal cells. Ammonium ion inhibits not only cell growth but also product formation such as interferon and vaccine. Therefore, high cell density and high vaccine productivity could be achieved if ammonium ions were removed from the media as soon as they formed. In this study, the PEDV vaccine was produced by immobilized Vero cell in spinner flask coupled with in situ removal of ammonium ion. A synthetic zeolite of membrane type was used as an ammonia adsorbents (Park et al., 1998) .\n\nThe optimum operation variables such as multiplicity of infection (MOI), infection time, and harvest time was investigated before the in situ removal system was applied. The optimum operation variables for PEDV vaccine production in a spinner culture were MOI of 0.01 cell \u22121 , infection time of 72 h and harvest time of 48 h. The optimum time for zeolite addition to 100 ml spinner flask in terms of volumetric virus productivity and specific virus productivity were 72 h and 48 h, respectively. The volumetric virus productivity with zeolite treatment system was 2.6 times higher than that without zeolite treatment system in the media supplemented with 2.5 mM glutamine. The results showed that the integrated cell culture system coupled with immobilized cell culture and in situ removal of ammonium ion was very effective for the production of PEDV vaccine."}
