{"title": "\nDC-SIGN (CD209) Promoter \u2212336 A/G Polymorphism Is Associated with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Correlated to DC-SIGN Expression and Immune Augmentation", "body": "Dengue viruses (DEN) are arthropod-borne flaviviruses that cause dengue fever (DF) with significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. There are four serotypes of dengue viruses (DEN types 1\u20134). Classic DF is a self-limited illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. Since the 1950s, a more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), has been recognized worldwide [1]. Patients who develop DHF typically have initial symptoms similar to those in DF patients, but develop cytokine-storm-like plasma leakage manifested by hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, ascites, and pleural effusion near the defeverence stage [2]. DHF pathogenesis has been attributed to viral virulence versus immune enhancement; however, that has been the subject of debate for many years [2], [3].\n\nThe innate immune system is the first line of host defense against pathogens and is involved in early recognition and uptake of microbes by the host's professional phagocytes such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, through germline-encoded receptors, known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [4]. These PRRs recognize microbial antigens and initiate innate immune responses followed by adaptive immunity [5]. PRRs are involved in phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and they trigger intracellular signaling and cytokine secretion [5]. PRR polymorphisms may therefore affect virus entry, replication, and immunity.\n\nAmong the PRRs, the CD209 molecule, also known as DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin), plays an important role in the early interaction of a pathogen with a dendritic cell [6]\u2013[8] and has a key role in DC-T cell interaction [9], DC migration [10], [11], and pathogen uptake [12]. DC-SIGN is organized into three domains, the N-terminal domain is located in the cytoplasm, the transmembrane domain anchors to the cytoplasmic membrane, and the extracellular domain consists of a neck region formed by seven highly conserved 23 amino acid repeats and a carbohydrate domain for pathogen binding [13].\n\nThe CD209 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.2\u20133 and is highly polymorphic. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported [14]\u2013[18]. One of these SNPs represents a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at position \u2212336 within the CD209 gene promoter (rs4804803). This variant has been associated with an increased risk for parenteral acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [15], severity of dengue infection [16], and confered high susceptibility to tuberculosis in a South African cohort [17]. Nevertheless, Vannberg et al. found that G variant allele of rs4804803 was associated with protection against tuberculosis in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa [18]. This variant affects CD209 promoter activity with multiple transcription factor binding sites for the Sp1/GATA1/CACCC- and CAC-binding transcription factors in a transfection study [16]. As an in vitro study of promoter activity might not reflect an actual functional association, we aimed to test whether the rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 was associated with the susceptibility to DF and/or DHF in Taiwanese, and whether monocyte-derived DCs from humans with various genotypes of rs4804803 would reveal differences in DC-SIGN membrane expression and implicate the viral replication and immune reactions after DEN infection.\n\nThis study was approved by the Institution Review Board (IRB) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, Taiwan. The dengue patients were recruited as described previously in the 2002\u20132003 DEN-2 outbreak in Taiwan [19]\u2013[23]. A larger retrospective cohort was designed and re-approved by an additional IRB review (Document No.: 97-2111B). To validate cell surface expression and immune functions of rs4804803 SNP, we obtained informed consent to collect blood leukocytes from normal volunteers with AA or AG genotypes of rs4804803.\n\nDEN infection was confirmed by clinical dengue symptoms and signs along with detection of DEN-2 RNA by quantitative RT-PCR in blood, detection of IgM to DEN or at least a 4-fold increase in dengue-specific hemagglutination inhibition titers in convalescent serum compared with that in acute-phase serum [20], [21]. In those with DEN-2 infection, blood was drawn at least once a day subsequent to admission into the hospital to measure the platelet counts and hematocrit levels. A Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasonography were performed routinely in individuals without evidence of hemoconcentration or hypoalbuminemia to refine the differential diagnosis of DHF vs. DF based on pleural effusion or ascites. A clinical diagnosis of DHF was assigned according to the DHF criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO); including a reduced platelet count (<100,000/mm3), petechiae, hemorrhagic manifestation, and plasma leakage showing hemoconcentration (peak hematocrit \u226520% above the mean for the population, or an increase in hematocrit of 20% or more), pleural effusion, ascites, or hypoalbuminemia [24]. Patients with DF were defined by detectable DEN-2 RNA by RT-PCR or DEN-specific IgM, but without evidence of DHF. Primary or secondary DEN infections were identified using previously established serologic criteria for IgM/IgG ELISAs [19].\n\nPatients with other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) were defined by febrile illness with no detectable DEN-specific IgM, no detectable DEN RNA, and no obvious or reported bacterial etiology for their illness during the same study period. Population controls were healthy, unrelated volunteers from the same community, with neither signs nor previous history of dengue infection, with a DEN IgG sero-positive rate of 1.37% (1/73).\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from heparin-anticoagulated blood samples using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction followed by 70% alcohol precipitation. Genotyping for the CD209 variant (\u2212336 A/G; rs4804803) was carried out using Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primer sequences were 5\u2032-GGACAGTGCTTCCAGGAACT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGTGTTACACCCCCTCCACTAG-3\u2032 (reverse). The TaqMan minor groove binder probe sequences were 5\u2032-TACCTGCCTACCCTT G-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-CTGCCCACC CTTG-3\u2032. The probes were labeled with the TaqMan fluorescent dyes VIC and FAM, respectively. The PCR was conducted in total volume of 15 \u00b5L using the following amplification protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for one minute. After the PCR, the genotype of each sample was determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System, using SDS 1.1 software for allele discrimination (both Applied Biosystems). To validate the genotyping by real-time PCR analysis, 100 PCR products were subject to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with MscI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and showed 100% identical result between these two genotyping systems.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from peripheral blood of 20 healthy, DEN-specific IgM or IgG seronegative volunteers with AA or AG genotype. CD14+ monocytes were isolated by positive selection according to the manufacturer's specifications using CD14 microbeads and a magnetic cell separator (MACS) (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Enriched CD14+ cells (purity>95%) were cultured for 6 days in six-well plates in complete RPMI medium in the presence of 10 ng/mL rhGM-CSF and 5 ng/mL rhIL-4 at 37\u00b0C, and 5% CO2. On day 3, half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with rhGM-CSF and rhIL-4. Expression of markers was measured by flow cytometer using specific antibodies and their corresponding isotype controls.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) were infected with DEN-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice to remove cell-free virus, and cultured in complete RPMI medium (without cytokines) at a density of 2\u00d7105 cells/ml in 48-well plates. Cells and supernatants were removed and analyzed at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. For the neutralization experiments, cells were incubated in the medium alone or in the medium with the addition of anti-human CXCL10/IP-10 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 10 \u00b5g/mL for 30 min. Cells and supernatants were harvested and analyzed 24 h post-infection.\n\nTotal RNA extracted from MDDCs was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR to assess levels of mRNA corresponding to CD209 and \u00df2\u2013microglobulin (B2MG) using the ABI PRISM 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems). The forward primer, reverse primer sequence for detecting CD209 and B2MG were 5\u2032-AACAGCTGAGAGGCCTTGGA-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GGGACCATGGCCAAGACA-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-AATTGAAAAAGTGGAGCATTCAGA-3\u2032, 5\u2032-GGCTGTGACAAAGTCACATGGTT-3\u2032, respectively. The PCR cycling parameters were 40 cycles of PCR reactions at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, and 60\u00b0C for one minute. The results were detected in real-time and recorded on a plot showing fluorescence vs. time. RT-PCR products were also visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose (Pierce Co., Rockford, IL, USA) gel with a 100- bp ladder (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) as a reference.\n\nTo measure the CD209 cell surface expression, MDDCs were stained with FITC-conjugated mAbs specific for DC-SIGN (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). An isotype-matched FITC-labeled control, mouse IgG2b (clone MOPC195, Immunotech, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) was included in each experiment.\n\nTotal RNA extracted from MDDCs was subjected to assess DEN-2 RNA viral copies. Fluorescent RT-PCR was performed in an ABI 7500 quantitative PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles using TaqMan technology as previously described [21].\n\nCytokine/chemokine production and viral replication were determined at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. Cell-free culture supernatants TNF\u03b1 and macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) concentrations were measured using ELISA kits from eBioscience Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA); IL-12p40 and IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) concentrations were measured using ELISA kits from R&D Systems as per manufacturer's instructions.\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM values. Alleles and genotypes distribution of rs4804803 are presented as numbers (percentages). Conformance of the allele frequencies to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions was tested to compare the observed and expected frequencies of heterozygotes and homozygotes. Differences among patients with DEN, DF, DHF, OFI, and population controls were determined using two-sided Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test. Odds ratio (OR) values were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparisons between continuous variables. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical comparison of the neutralization experiments. All analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nDuring a large DEN-2 outbreak in southern Taiwan between June 2002 and January 2003, a hospital-based case-control study was used to identify the risk immune parameters [19]\u2013[23]. Employing the decoded DNA samples from that same cohort of the population that study has been extended to investigate the association of rs4804803 SNP with DF, DHF, viral replication, and immune response. Based on the previous case-control study design, we have included DNA samples from 135 DHF, 176 DF, and 143 OFI patients in this expanded study. The main characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant differences in sex or total leukocyte counts between patients with DF and those with DHF. However, age (41.7\u00b11.6 years vs. 45.7\u00b11.3 years, p<0.001), serum GOT levels (70.1\u00b18.1 U/mL vs. 313.8\u00b174.6 U/mL, p = 0.002) and GPT levels (67.1\u00b111.3 U/mL vs. 142.7\u00b121.9 U/mL, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the DHF group (Table 1). A patient manifested with abdominal pain had ascites as evidenced by abdominal ultrasonography was classified as DF because the patient revealed no thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm3), petechia or hemorrhagic manifestation during the admission period.\n\nWe investigated the association of rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 with protection from dengue infection and the susceptibility of DHF. Genomic DNA obtained from DEN patients (n = 311), OFI patients (n = 143), and population controls (n = 120) was genotyped for rs4804803 SNP. We found that GG/AG genotypes in 16.0% of the DEN patients were significantly higher than OFI patients (5.6%, OR = 3.23, p = 0.002) and population controls (7.5%, OR = 2.36, p = 0.020; Table 2). Moreover, the GG/AG genotypes were significantly higher in DHF patients (23.0%) than OFI patients and population controls (OR = 5.03 and 3.68, p = 3\u00d710\u22125 and 0.001), and also significantly higher than DF patients (10.8%, OR = 2.46; p = 0.004; Table 2).\n\nAnalysis of the allele distribution between DEN and OFI patients or population controls showed that the G allele frequency was higher in DEN patients (8.4%), compared with OFI patients (2.8%, OR = 3.17, p = 0.002) or population controls (3.8%, OR = 2.34, p = 0.018; Table 3). Moreover, the frequency of G allele of rs4804803 was significantly higher in DHF patients (12.2%) than OFI patients or population controls (OR = 4.84 and 3.57, p = 2\u00d710\u22125 and 0.001), and higher than DF patients (5.4%, OR = 2.44, p = 0.002; Table 3). Few DHF patients (n = 6) had dengue shock syndrome in this cohort; one of them carrying AG genotype.\n\nTo investigate whether the rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 associated with the primary and secondary DEN infection, we used serological methods to detect DEN antibodies for differentiation into primary and secondary dengue infection. Of the 293 DEN patients, 141 (48%) had secondary DEN infections, based on detectable DEN-2 virus RNA and DEN IgG. As shown in Table 1, secondary DEN-2 infection was more frequently found in patients with DHF than in those with DF (65% vs. 36%, p<0.001). We found the rs4804803 GG/AG genotypes were found in 12.5% of patients with primary DEN infection and 16.3% of patients with secondary DEN infection, which did not reach significantly different (OR = 1.36; p = 0.352). As shown in Table 4, there was no association between rs4804803 SNP and primary or secondary dengue infection in DF patients (OR = 0.64; p = 0.409), or in DHF patients (OR = 1.80; p = 0.251). In addition, there was no association between allele distribution and primary or secondary dengue infection in DF and DHF patients (data not shown).\n\nDue to the low frequency of GG genotype in our population (2 cases, 0.6%), we could not recall the patients because the data file had been decoded for identification. We examined DC-SIGN (CD209) expression in both mRNA level of MDDCs and protein level on their cell surface from healthy subjects with AA or AG genotype by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. A significant increase in CD209 mRNA expression was detected in the MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype than those from individuals with AA genotype (p = 0.032, Fig 1B). Similarly, individuals with AG genotype had a significantly higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression (p = 0.029; Fig 1D). However, the surface DC-SIGN expression declined rapidly along with DEN-2 infection on MDDCs from both genotypes' subjects, which showed no difference at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (Fig. 2A).\n\nTo investigate whether the rs4804803 SNP was correlated to viral replication, we measured DEN-2 RNA copies in MDDCs with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. DEN-2 replication was significantly higher in MDDCs from individuals with AA genotype than those with AG genotype at 48 h post-infection (1.07\u00b10.45\u00d7106 copies/105 cells vs. 3.90\u00b10.67\u00d7106 copies/105 cells, p = 0.006) and 72 h post-infection (4.83\u00b10.70\u00d7105 copies/105 cells vs. 2.32\u00b10.68\u00d7106 copies/105 cells, p = 0.003; Fig. 2B). Viral replication, as measured at 72 h post-infection, increased more remarkably in MDDCs at MOI of 5 and 10 (p<0.001 and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2C).\n\nTo investigate whether higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression was correlated with immune response, we investigated kinetic cytokine/chemokine production by MDDCs from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803. Results showed that MDDCs with AG genotype had significantly higher TNF\u03b1 production than those with AA genotype at 24 and 48 hr post-infection (303.51\u00b166.75 pg/mL vs. 143.97\u00b168.80 pg/mL and 202.35\u00b119.35 pg/mL vs. 73.00\u00b19.55 pg/mL; p = 0.021 and 0.002, respectively; Fig 3A). IL-12p40 production significantly increased by MDDCs with AG genotype than those with AA genotype at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (p<0.001, 0.007 and 0.001, respectively; Fig 3B). We also measured the concentration of two chemokines, MCP-1 and IP-10, which had been implicated in the recruitment and stimulation of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and T lymphocytes [25]. It was found that IP-10, but not MCP-1, production was significantly higher by MDDCs with AG genotype than those with AA genotype at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (620.60\u00b1175.56 pg/mL vs. 243.02\u00b141.64 pg/mL, 889.92\u00b191.46 pg/ml vs. 168.02\u00b124.02 pg/mL, and 614.44\u00b149.16 pg/mL vs. 322.32\u00b169.62 pg/mL; p = 0.034, 0.009 and 0.010, respectively; Fig 3C). The MCP-1 levels peaked at 48 hr in subjects with both genotypes', but there was no significant difference between AA genotype and AG genotype (550.72\u00b160.73 pg/mL vs. 463.92\u00b166.80 pg/mL, p = 0.157; Fig. 3D).\n\nIP-10, produced by non-infected bystander DCs in response to DEN infection, is a potent chemoattractant for activated T and NK cells [26], and the modulation of adaptive immune response [27]. IP-10 has also been known to inhibit the binding ability of DEN in immortalized cells [28]. In our MDDC model, cells from individuals with AG genotype exhibited an augmented innate immune reaction, showing higher IP-10 production, post-infection (Figure 3C). Based on these results, we hypothesized that DEN-infected MDDCs with AG genotype produced higher levels of IP-10, which might block viral entry or viral replication in MDDCs. We used an anti-IP-10 neutralizing mAb to block endogenous IP-10 production by MDDCs. With both genotypes, the viral replication 24 h post DEN infection increased significantly more in the presence of neutralizing antibody than in the absence of neutralizing antibody (p = 0.034 and 0.040, respectively; Fig. 4A). IP-10 production by MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype significantly decreased (795.3\u00b1368.1 pg/mL vs. 273.8\u00b187.8 pg/mL; p = 0.037), but it did not decrease in MDDCs from individuals with AA genotype (329.8\u00b1114.2 pg/mL vs. 201.8\u00b187.0 pg/mL; p = 0.091; Fig. 4B). These results suggest that IP-10 produced by MDDCs is involved in the viral replication of DEN infection.\n\nDC-SIGN has been shown to be an important receptor for DEN and a number of viruses, including HIV, Helicobacter pylori, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [29]. Some studies have demonstrated that genetic variations of CD209 (rs4804803) were associated with the susceptibility to HIV [14], Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[17], HCV [30], and dengue [16]. Few studies have demonstrated how the rs4804803 SNP is involved in viral replication or immune response. We are the first in the field to demonstrate the relationship among functional cell surface expression, viral replication, and immune responses in DEN-infected MDDCs from subjects with rs4804803 SNP. Here we found that rs4804803 SNP was strongly associated with the risk of DHF vs. DF and controls. Functional studies have determined that MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype have a significantly higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression than from those with AA genotype. MDDCs with AG genotype produced higher TNF\u03b1, IL-12p40, and IP-10 levels but lower viral replication in response to dengue infection.\n\nBecause the physiopathology of various manifestations of DHF is not fully understood, several studies have supported the supposition that secondary dengue infection [31], age [32], a number of preexisting chronic diseases such as diabetes and bronchial asthma [33], and host genetic factor [16], [22] increase the risk of progression to DHF. This indicates that multiple factors are involved in the development of DHF. Our findings regarding rs4804806 SNP associated with DHF vs. OFI control (p = 3\u00d710\u22125; Table 2) in a case-control association study suggests that rs4804806 SNP contributes in part to the development of DHF.\n\nOur study shows that the GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 were associated with susceptibility to DHF, compared with DF, which is consistent with the observation of Sakuntabhai et al.\n[16]. In our study, the AA genotype was associated with protection against DHF, compared with OFI and population controls, while G allele was associated with protection against DF in Sakuntabhai's observation. The inconsistency between these studies regarding the protection for DHF or DF may result from two possibilities. First, the frequency of G allele in Chinese population is 3.8%; while in Thailand, it is 9.5\u201310.4% [16], [34]. Second, definition of DF and DHF might be also different. We defined DF and DHF according to WHO criteria, while in the study by Sakuntabhai et al., DF was defined by criteria of severe dengue fever syndrome with hemorrhage but no plasma leakage, excluding patients with flu-like symptoms or those having only fever. Moreover, the rs4804803 SNP was demonstrated to be in linkage disequilibrium with three other intronic polymorphisms in a Thai population, and these might also have contributed to the susceptibility of DHF [16].\n\nOur results suggest that humans carrying the rs4804803 AG genotype have a higher DC-SIGN expression and lower DEN-2 replication in MDDCs. These results differ from a previous study by Loach et al. who demonstrated that the DC-SIGN expression levels on Raji cells after transfection of various DC-SIGN cDNA constructs were significantly correlated to the infection rate of DEN-1 [35]. DC-SIGN is an endocytic receptor shown to induce endocytosis of several pathogens, including dengue [36]\u2013[38]. The difference between these two studies might be due to different cell types and ex vivo culture systems. In our study, it was found that MDDCs from subjects with rs4804803 AG genotype had higher surface DC-SIGN expression with higher production of chemokines such as IP-10, which could limit DEN-2 replication (Fig. 4A); however, the higher surface DC-SIGN expression in subjects with AG genotype decreased remarkably 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2A). In the study by Loach et al., ectopic expression levels of DC-SIGN on Raji cells enhanced DEN-1 replication, which might be related to a higher quantity of receptors or lower production of IP-10 favoring DEN replication. Results from these studies suggest that the correlation of viral replication to higher or lower DC-SIGN expression depends on genetic factors in the host, cell type, and dynamic changes in the receptor following DEN infection.\n\nIn functional studies of rs4804803 SNP, we determined that MDDCs with AG genotype had a higher DC-SIGN expression correlated to augmented immune responses with higher TNF\u03b1, IL-12p40, and IP-10, than those with AA genotype, but not MCP-1 production. DEN replication was significantly lower in individuals with AG genotype. The addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody blocked the production of endogenous IP-10 and significantly enhanced the replication of DEN-2 (Fig. 4A). This suggests that rs4804803 SNP was involved in the DC-SIGN expression associated with augmented immune response, such as the increase in the production of IP-10 that repressed the replication of DEN. This is supported by the fact that altered immune response, but not viral load, was observed in DHF patients [21], [39]. CLEC5A-mediated DEN infection in animals that was susceptible to DEN hemorrhagic infection also revealed augmented immune response [40].\n\nIn contrast, it is interesting to note that the viral replication in MDDCs from individuals with rs4804803 AA genotype was significantly higher than in individuals with AG genotype following DEN-2 infection. The mechanism by which rs4804803 SNP influences DEN replication in MDDCs is currently unknown. Chan et al. showed that certain polymorphisms of L-SIGN, a DC-SIGN homologue, mediated more efficient viral degradation of SARS-CoV [41]. The clinical implications of screening genotypes to prevent DEN infection might be supported if different viral loads could be demonstrated among humans with various genotypes of rs4804803 in future outbreaks of DEN.\n\nThe outcome of DEN infection is determined by a myriad of interactions among viral, immunological, and human genetic factors, as well as kinetic interactions between innate and adaptive immunity. This study provides new evidence that CD209 rs4804803 SNP, correlated to cell surface expression on dendritic cells, mediates augmented immune responses against DEN-2 infection and is implicated in the susceptibility of DHF. Further studies are warranted, particularly with regard to the genetic variants of CD209 on the DC polarization of adaptive immunity, and how they may promote or protect the development of DHF."}
