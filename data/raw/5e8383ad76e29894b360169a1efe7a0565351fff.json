{"title": "A System of Protein Target Sequences for Anti-RNA-viral Chemotherapy by a Vitamin B 6 -Derived Zinc-Chelating Trioxa-adamantane-triol", "body": "Oligo-oxa-adamantanes are rarely found in nature as structurally striking biochemicals. The neurotoxic sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), one of the most toxic non-proteinaceous poisons along with aconitine, veratridine, saxitoxin (STX), batrachotoxin (BTX) and palytoxin (PTX), is widely spread in nature, especially in marine ecosystems. TTX, traditionally esteemed famous for its occurrence in the inner organs (especially liver and ovaries) of the Japanese culinaric delicacy tora fugu, the globe (tiger puffer) fish Spheroides rubripes (Tetraodontidae), is to be depicted as substituted 2,8-dioxa-adamantane 1 (Fig. 1) . 1\u00c03 Daigremontianin was isolated from the tropical flower Kalanchoe daigremontiana Hamet et Perr. (Crassulaceae) and was shown to be a steroid (bufadienolide) 2,8,9trioxa-adamantane (Fig. 1) . 4, 5 Synthetic adamantanes, or tricyclo[3.3.1.1 3, 7 ]decanes, are used as antiviral chemotherapeutics [amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) and rimantadine systemically against influenza A virus, tromantadine topically against herpes simplex virus type 1 infections] and antiparkinsonian (muscle relaxant) drugs [amantadine as central dopaminergic, memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane) as neuroprotective N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-subtype glutamate receptor antagonist] (Fig. 1 ).\n\nIn addition to the Schiff base 6 formation of pyridoxal (mainly existing as racemic cyclic hemiacetal, especially as hydrochloride) and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (coenzyme vitamin B 6 ) with primary amino groups of biomolecules which is of central importance in coenzyme vitamin B 6 -catalyzed biochemical metabolism (transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, ligation, lysis) of amino acid, neurotransmitter, phospholipid, sphingolipid, heme, polyamine and tumor marker 7 synthesis, pyridoxal and pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate are capable of undergoing various chemical reactions. Especially Knoevenagel condensations lead to interesting compounds with antiretroviral, oncolytic, immunosuppressant, antioxidative, free radical-scavenging, nitric oxide synthase inhibition and other biological activities. 8\u00c012 Recently, a new conception for inducing selective apoptosis in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected cells was proposed. 12 Therefore, my attention focused on the analysis of unique reactions of vitamin B 6 which was shown to be suitable for various chemical transactions. 8\u00c012\n\nInfrared absorption spectroscopy of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol An infrared absorption (IR) spectrum of the reaction product was recorded in a solid potassium bromide (KBr) pellet (Fig. 2) . No a,b-unsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption at wavenumbers between 1700 and 1600 cm \u00c01 could be seen. Instead a very broad OH band between 3650 and 1800 cm \u00c01 dominates the IR spectrum. It represents a valence bond vibration of hydrogen-bonded O-H, and, respectively, intra/intermolecular polymeric associated chelate O-H. At 2900 cm \u00c01 a methyl group C-H and at 2825 cm \u00c01 a methylene group C-H valence bond vibration can be identified. At 1590 and 1520 cm \u00c01 C-C aromatic valence bond vibrations of a pyridine heterocycle can be detected. At wavenumbers of 1430 cm \u00c01 a methylene C-H deformation vibration and 1395 cm \u00c01 a methyl group C-H deformation vibration can be analyzed. Very characteristic is the aromatic C-O phenolic valence bond vibration at 1210 cm \u00c01 . The two bands at 1065 cm \u00c01 (Ar-CH 2 -OH) and 1110 cm \u00c01 are aliphatic C-O valence bond vibrations. The absorption band at 820 cm \u00c01 is fitting to a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted aromate with one isolated CH. Taken together, already the IR data unequivocally proof the unusual 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methyl -4 -pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol structure because the 6-hydroxy -4 -(hydroxymethyl) -1-methyl -8H- [1] benzopyrano [2,3c] pyridin-8-one alternative would have a strong a,bunsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption between wavenumbers of 1775 and 1650 cm \u00c01 (preferably 1650-1700 cm \u00c01 , p-benzoquinone 1669 cm \u00c01 ). The predominant, very broad OH band from 3650 to 1800 cm \u00c01 peaking at 3350 cm \u00c01 pointed to strongly associated intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the solid state of the brown substance KBr pellet. A similar effect was observed in the IR spectrum (in KBr) of the polyhydroxyl, solvent-retaining compound tetrodotoxin. 3 UV spectrophotometry of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol An UV electronic absorption spectrum of the substance was recorded in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution (Fig. 3) . The solubility of the material in water, ethanol, or dilute acid [dilute hydrochloric (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 )] is too low to work in these solvents. The product is soluble in sodium hydroxide solution and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to give yellow to brown solutions. The UV spectrum showed two maxima at 220.0 nm (e=22,443 L mol \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ) and 285.8 nm (e=11,591 L mol \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ), the molar mass for the cal- Figure 1 . The natural products tetrodotoxin and daigremontianin with oligo-oxa-adamantane structure and the synthetic adamantanes, or tricyclo[3.3.1.1 3, 7 ]decanes, amantadine, rimantadine, tromantadine, and memantine. culation of the molar extinction coefficient \" was choosed as M=327.29 g/mol, the theoretic molar mass of 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (Fig. 3 ). This result can be reasonably interpreted in the way that a typical sodium phenolate [sodium phenolate in water: l 1,max =235 nm (e=9400), l 2,max =287 nm (e=2600)] is the chromophor of the compound. The structure 6hydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1-methyl-8H- [1] benzopyrano [2,3-c] pyridin-8-one would show an electronic absorption maximum at a wavelength of approximately 450 nm similar to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl condensate B6PR. 11 Therefore, the UV spectrophotometry supplies us with strong evidence for 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaada-mantane-3,5,7-triol to represent the UV chromophor of the unknown product. Already now the spectral-analytic structure determination provides growing proof for being 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxatricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7 ]decane -3,5,7 -triol the suspected structural composition of the material in question.\n\nProton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectroscopy of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol\n\nThe final structural proof could be made by examination of the 1 H NMR spectrum of the substance in deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3 ) (Fig. 4) . At the chemical shift d 2.50 a singlet of three protons of the heteroaromatic methyl group peaked. At d 3.32 six protons of the methylene groupings of the trioxa-adamantane-triol could be unequivocally identified. At d 4.85 (m, 2H, pyridine CH 2 OH) and d 5.90 (m, 1H, CH 2 OH) the intermolecular-associated hydroxymethyl group gave broadened multiplets emerging possibly from interaromatic charge-transfer complexation and hydrogen-bonding. At d 8.11 one heteroaromatic proton proofed to complete that no other structural composition was possible than 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methyl -4 -pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxatricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7 ]decane-3,5,7-triol. Ethanol, water, and the educt pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol were detectable as trace impurities from synthesis.\n\nSince the organic chemical structure of the material resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol could be defined by the analytical results, an experimentally based scheme for the chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of 1-[3hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9trioxatricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7 ]decane-3,5,7-triol is depicted (Fig. 5 ). The hypothesis that bananin is an highly intermolecular-associated material, leading to a nearly black colour through interaromatic charge-transfer complexation between the pyridine heterocycles and hydro-gen-bonding between the trioxa-adamantane-triol heterotricycles is supported by combination of the IR, UV, and 1 H NMR data (Fig. 6 ). An instruction protocol for the isolation of amorphous bananin picrate was developed. Amorphous bananin picrate is soluble in water with intense yellow colour and liberates brownblack amorphous bananin by treatment with strong bases (NaOH solution). The intermolecular network leading to the black colour of bananin is interrupted in the yellow bananin picrate (Fig. 6 ) by complexing the pyridine heterocycle with picric acid. Furthermore, a sodium hydroxide-containing solution of bananin monosodium salt in water both forms a blue copper complex with Cu(OH) 2 and a white zinc complex with Zn(OH) 2 . It is proposed that bananin behaves as bidentate chelate donor to build the tetragonal-planar coordination complex (SP-4-1)-bis (Fig. 7) . In addition, it should be mentioned that bananin has lost most of its vitamin B 6 character. The pyridine nitrogen is less basic than in pyridoxal and the UV parameters of pyridoxine/pyridoxal are left. Instead a typical phenolic behaviour is found and the tendency of (NaOH) . Finally, the brown-black bananin is isolated by help of its relative insolubility in water. Figure 6 . Left, excerpt of the intermolecular association of black bananin leading to supramolecular chains including charge-transfer complexes between the aromatic rings and strong hydrogen-bonding between OH groups (red arrows) and the trioxa-adamantane-triol cages (magenta-green). Right, chemical structure of the yellow bananin picrate.\n\nvitamin B 6 to exist mostly in a well-defined zwitterionic state at physiologic pH 7.4 is abandoned in bananin.\n\nTo move a step toward the direction of possible biological activities of BN it is suggested that human pyridoxal kinase 13 accepts BN as a substrate for ATP-and Zn 2+ -dependent phosphorylation to bananin 5 0 -phos-phate (BNP) (Fig. 8) . Pyridoxal kinase can phosphorylate an array of vitamin B 6 -derivatives with modulated substituents in position 4 of the pyridine heterocycle, additionally to its natural substrates pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. 14, 15 This was theoretically proofed by the crystal structure determination of sheep brain pyridoxal kinase 16 which shows a tight binding of the 3 -hydroxy -5 -(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methylpyridine vitamin B 6 core structure of pyridoxal in the substratebinding pocket, but structural fill space at the 4-position of the vitamin B 6 core element. 16 Conclusively, it is reasonable to speculate that BN is converted into BNP by the human tissue-ubiquitous pyridoxal kinase, 13 and such is 'metabolically trapped' inside the cell after cellular uptake by vitamin B 6 carrier systems. Through usage of vitamin B 6 metabolic systems high intracellular concentrations of BNP could be achieved since the phosphate group-induced zwitterionic, hydrophilic appearance of BNP prevents reverse cell membrane passage.\n\nBiological significance of zinc complexation by BN for zinc ejection from HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7\n\nThe HIV-1 gag gene polycistronic mRNA product encodes the myristoylated matrix protein p17, the . Postulated zinc ejection from HIV-1 (isolate HXB2) RNAbinding NCp7 holoprotein zinc finger sequence motifs I and II (yellow: l-cysteine, black: conserved hydrophobic l-amino acids, magenta: coordinatively Zn 2+ -bound l-histidine moieties) by four BN to yield defunctional NCp7 apoprotein, devoid of two Zn 2+ cations, and two bisBNzinc. phosphorylated p24 core protein, the small core peptide p2, the zinc-containing nucleocapsid protein NCp7, the small core peptide p1, and the virion-incorporated core link protein p6. NCp7 contains two highly conserved nonclassical Cys-Xaa 2 -Cys-Xaa 4 -His-Xaa 4 -Cys (CCHC) zinc finger motifs. 17\u00c035 This retroviral zinc finger motif is conserved in all onco-and lentiretroviruses except spumaretroviruses. 23 NCp7 binds to the duplex of HIV-1 retrogenomic mRNA encapsidated in the mature virion core at the highly secondary-structured HIV-1 RNA sequence elements known as c-packaging signal near the 5 0 -LTR, next to the tRNA Lys primer binding (PB) site. The two zinc fingers are sensitive to organic-chemical zinc chelating compounds. 3-Nitrosobenzamide (NOBA) 17\u00c019 and other small molecule compounds 25\u00c028,31\u00c033,35 eject zinc from NCp7 holoprotein leaving a functionally deprived apoprotein. Therefore, zinc chelators are able to inhibit HIV-1 replication and infectivity in vitro 17\u00c019,21,23 and in vivo. 34 BN is an excellent zinc chelator and is postulated to be chemically suitable for zinc ejection from HIV-1 NCp7 (Fig. 9) .\n\nProposed active ester formation of BNP at selected RNA-viral protein RX(D/E) target sequences\n\nIn analogy to the postulated antiviral mechanism of the retinoid vitamin A-vitamin B 6 conjugate analogue B6RA at RGD and RLE viral protein target sequences, 12 a covalent 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl active ester formation of BNP with RGD aspartic acid residues in RNA-viral protein target sequences is proposed (Fig. 10) . BNP should have a similar salt-bridge amphoteric affinity to RX(D/E) protein sequence motifs like B6RA. Therefore, it could covalently bind to viral RX(D/E) sequences and, analogously to B6RA, chemically modify important viral proteins, thus making them functionally obsolete. Together with the putative antilentiviral retinoid vitamin A-vitamin B 6 conjugate analogue B6RA, BNP is proposed to serve as effector in a system of protein target sequences RX(D/E) of RNA virus components. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) trans-activating transcriptional regulatory protein Tat sequences PRGDP and PRLEP were suggested as possible targets of B6RA. 12 I propose a binding of B6RA/BNP to Tat PRGDP tat exon 2-encoded C-terminal sequence which serves also for cross-talk with cellular tumor suppressor protein p53. 12 BNP could form an active ester at the tat exon 2-encoded Cterminal PRGDP sequence (Fig. 10) by addition of the aspartate (d) residue to the trioxa-adamantane-triol 4substituent-activated pyridine heterocycle in BNP (Fig. 10 ). This 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl active ester species would be principally able to cross-link Tat d-amidelike to amino groups of DNA nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine) in HIV-1 proviral integrated U3/R sequences of HIV-1 5 0 -long terminal repeat or, more generally, in host cellular DNA. In this way, nonrepairable Tat protein-DNA complexes would serve as trigger for DNA damage-induced apoptosis selectively in cells in which Tat is present. As a result the host organism would be specifically extricated from integrated HIV-1 proviruses. 12 Table 1 ) by addition of the aspartate group to the pyridine ring of RGD-ionic contact (IC)-bound BNP resulting in an activated 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl ester.\n\nanti-RNA-viral virustatic ribavirin 38 because ribavirin is mostly active against RNA viruses by inhibiting inosine 5 0 -monophosphate dehydrogenase as ribavirin 5 0monophosphate, and mRNA precursor 5 0 -capping as ribavirin 5 0 -triphosphate. 38 The actual therapeutic value of the B6RA/BNP system for chemotherapeutic treatment of RNA-viral human disease conditions remains elusive until comprehensive experimental verification is gained.\n\nA mass of 20.81 g pyridoxal hydrochloride (M=203.63 g/mol) (n=102.1952 mmol) was dissolved in 63 mL water by heating on a water bath. 12.89 g phloroglucinol (M=126.11 g/mol) (n=102.2123 mmol) were dissolved in 79 mL of ethanol 90% by heating on a water bath. The two solutions were mixed and refluxed for 10 min. Then 8.59 g sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) (M=84.01 g/mol) (n=102.2497 mmol) were added to the hot yellow solution. A bright yellow precipitate formed after approximately 10 min on reflux. The suspension was additionally heated for 5 min on a water bath, cooled slowly to room temperature, and freezed to \u00c018 C for 4 h. Then the precipitate was vacuum filtered and transferred and washed with 65 mL water. It was dried over anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) in a vacuum desiccator. Yield: 28.1 g yellow powder (100%) pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol C 14 H 13 NO 5 (M=275.26 g/mol).\n\nSynthesis of 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (bananin) from pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol 28.1 g pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol (M=275.26 g/mol) (n=102.0853 mmol) were suspended in 100 mL of 5 M hydrochloric acid (500 mmol HCl). The dark yellow solution was refluxed for 15 min on a water bath. A caramel-yellow coloured precipitate of 1 0 ,4 0 -dihydrobananin formed. Then it was heated to 170-180 C on an air bath and the orange-yellow (4 0 RS)-4 0 -chloro-1 0 ,4 0 -dihydrobananin formed in the heat. When the reaction proceeds the heat is reduced to 120 C and then the mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature. Then it was freezed to \u00c018 C for 12 h. The nearly solid orange-yellow suspension was filtered through a paper filter. The yellow-orange residue was suspended in 300 mL saturated (room temperature y=20 C) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) solution in water. The orangeyellow (4 0 RS)-4 0 -chloro-1 0 ,4 0 -dihydrobananin eliminated HCl to form bananin. Then solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pearls were added in small portions to the suspension until all material had dissolved to form a coffeeblack solution (V=400 mL) of bananin sodium salt. It was titrated in small portions with 10 M hydrochloric acid until brown bananin precipitated. The chocolate brown suspension was left standing at room temperature for 3 days. After that time the suspension was fil-tered through a paper filter and the chocolate brown residue in the filter was washed with 400 mL water. It was dried for 2 weeks over anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) in a vacuum desiccator. Yield: 33.2 g brownblack powder (99%) 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (bananin) C 14 A saturated solution (50 mL at 80 C) of 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methyl -4 -pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (bananin) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was mixed with 50 mL of a saturated (room temperature y=20 C) solution of picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol) in 50% ethanol. Then 200 mL 90% ethanol and 500 mL water were added in the heat. A voluminous yellow precipitate formed. The temperature of the suspension was kept at \u00c018 C for 12 h. The precipitate was vacuum filtered and dried over anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) in a vacuum desiccator. Yield: yellow powder of crude (bananin-containing) 1-[3hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol picrate (bananin picrate). Purification: the crude product was dissolved in 200 mL 5 M hydrochloric acid (1 mol HCl) by heating on a water bath and the mixture was hot filtrated. In the filter residual brown-black bananin remained. The filtrate was slowly neutralized with a solution of 40.0 g sodium hydroxide (1 mol NaOH) in 200 mL water. Yellow bananin picrate precipitated. The precipitate was vacuum filtered and dried over anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) in a vacuum desiccator. Yield: yellow amorphous powder 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol picrate (bananin picrate). "}
