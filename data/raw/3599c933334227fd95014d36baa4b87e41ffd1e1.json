Due to a concern of under-reporting before January 20, 2020, data in this period were imputed and double-checked manually based on a range of sources, including local government reports, officially published literature and local hospital reports 9 .\n\nThe definitions of confirmed and suspected cases for COVID-19 have been described elsewhere in detail 8 . We only used data from confirmed cases in the modelling and included all provinces in mainland China except for Tibet and Xinjiang where only a few confirmed cases were reported.\n\nPopulation movement data As the capital city of Hubei Province, Wuhan has more than 11 million residents and is connected to other major cities in China via frequent buses, high-speed trains, and commercial flights. It is the busiest traffic hub of central China. The daily population movement from and to Wuhan increased dramatically before the Lunar New Year (starting around January 10, 2020), which accelerated the spread of COVID-19 10, 11 . The daily population movement data into and out of Wuhan by types of transportation (i.e., long-distance bus, train and air) for the period January 10\u221223, 2020 were retrieved from an app-derived real-time location database provided by Baidu Huiyan Company, from which we constructed a travel volume matrix among different provinces.\n\nWe established a continuous-time but piecewise Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We considered transmission dynamics separately for each province. We modelled Wuhan city separately because of its heavy disease burden; other cities of Hubei province were modelled together. We divided the epidemic of COVID-19 into three developmental stages and the first two .

Stage 1 commenced on December 1, 2019 when the first COVID-19 case was detected, and ended on January 8, 2020, prior to the mass Lunar New Year population movement. During this period, the disease mainly spread within Wuhan, and inter-provincial movement of infected people was ignored. The transmission dynamics are described by the following differential equations:\n\nwhere \u0730 denotes the population size of Wuhan, \u0735 , \u202b\u0727\u202c , \u202b\u072b\u202c and \u0734 \u0749 denotes the number of susceptible, exposed (incubation), symptomatic and removed individuals, respectively. Although \u202b\u072b\"\u202c \" represents infectious individuals in traditional SEIR models, we assumed all exposed individuals were also infectious and used \u202b\u072b\u202c to represent the symptomatic phase. As it is not clear how prevalent is asymptomatic infection, we assumed for model simplicity that all exposed individuals move to the symptomatic phase. The infectiousness levels of exposed and symptomatic individuals are represented by the infection forces were detected outside Wuhan during this period, and therefore we still focused on .

Therefore, we assumed that the transmission dynamics in each province evolved independently. Here, Hubei province (excluding Wuhan) was regarded as a whole region. Considering that the tightened control policies reduced the contact frequencies of residents within each province, we added an attenuation\n\nto the infection risk from exposed individuals in their incubation period, where \u07d9 is the attenuation coefficient specific to the i-th province. The model in this stage is described by:\n\nwhere the subscript i indicates the i-th province, with \u0745 \u0d4c 0 designated for Wuhan and \u0745 \u0d4c 1\n\nfor the remaining cities of Hubei as a whole.

Recovery rate and mortality rate also differ by province, which is reasonable due to the heterogeneity in medical resources. The only parameter shared by all provinces is \u07ea , the rate of disease development which depends more on the pathogen than on the population. Considering the fact that medical resources in Wuhan were exhausted first but improved later on with aid from other parts of the country, we add an enhancement term\n\nto the case recovery rate:\n\nThe key parameters in the above models were estimated using MATLAB R2018b through the least square technique. The 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the parameter was estimated by independently adding random terms to the initial parameter value during the fitting process. The models for different provinces were calibrated separately. To assess the goodness-of-fit of the models, we calculated correlation coefficients between simulated and observed data, i.e., between model-predicted cumulative number of infections and the reported cumulative \n\nFor Stage 2 in Wuhan, we modify the above calculation considering the population movement:\n\nFor Stage 3, since some effects dependent on time evolution are taken into account not only in equation (10) for all provinces but also in equation (13) for Wuhan, we .

In this model, we used parameters estimated in Stage 2 for Wuhan and the numbers of exposed individuals in the other provinces at the beginning of Stage 3 to infer the number of exposed individuals on January 10 in Wuhan, i.e. back-estimating in time.\n\nThe numbers of exposed individuals in the other provinces at the beginning of Stage 3\n\nwere calculated from the epidemiological data.\n\n.

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nThe stage-specific and overall correlations between model predicted and observed cumulative case numbers were >0.9 for all the provinces with the exception of Wuhan in Stage 1 (Table 1 and in Supplementary Table 1) , which was 0.785. The less satisfactory correlation for the first stage in Wuhan city is likely caused by under-reporting during the early epidemic phase. Estimates of the key parameters in each epidemic stage are shown in Table 2 for\n\nWuhan and the rest of Hubei province. The results demonstrate that the estimated \u0734 dropped drastically in Stage 2 for Wuhan and the estimated median controlled reproduction number (\u0734 ) was significantly higher in Wuhan in Stage 3 compared to th rest of Hubei. In Stage 3, the infectivity of exposed individuals (\u07da \u0b36 ) was .

We mapped the spatial distribution of province-specific To address the concern of under-reporting in Wuhan in Stage 1, we proposed a source tracing strategy implemented through transportation in Stage 2. With the estimated initial exposed individuals on January 23, 2020, the model is able to attain the epidemic situation in Stage 3 (Supplementary Table 3 ). The estimated number of exposed individuals on January 10, 2020 in Wuhan is a function of the correction factor \u0747 and the number of infected individuals on January 10, 2020,\n\n. As is shown in Table 3 , the number of initial exposed individuals decreases significantly as \u0747 increases, and decreases slightly at a linear trend as \u202b\u072b\u202c increases. The estimated number of exposed individuals is much greater than the reported infectious individuals on January 17, 2020 (7 days or an incubation period after January 10, 2020) in Wuhan. \n\nThe respectively) were about equal. However, in stage 3 the infectivity of exposed individuals was significantly greater than that of the infectious individuals, which was the case for most of the other provinces. When symptomatic individuals were isolated .

Since the estimated values are mostly between 2 and 3 for SARS 15 The number of cases in Wuhan in epidemic stages 1 and 2 might be substantially underreported due to various reasons. To address this problem, we designed a method to estimate the epidemic scale in the first two stages. Our numerical results demonstrate a large degree of underreporting with a similar conclusion to a previous study 6 and these exposed individuals likely became a major source of intra-or inter-provincial infection. Underreporting of exposed individuals could lead to an underestimation of infectious individuals in stages 1 and 2. Considering the rapidly increasing number of infectious individuals in Wuhan after January 23, 2020, our .

Firstly, individuals with no or only mild symptoms might not seek treatment, and therefore, not be included in the dataset, especially for epidemic stages 1 and 2. This reporting bias could result in underestimation for the number of cases as well as \u0734 . Secondly, we did not include epidemic data from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and foreign countries. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity would have been larger if these data were included. Finally, we used data from laboratory diagnosed cases, and therefore, the number of predicted cases after February 12 would be lower than the officially reported number of both clinically and laboratory diagnosed cases, when the revised reporting rule was implemented; unfortunately, it is not possible to differentiate the numbers of clinically-and laboratory-diagnosed cases. .
