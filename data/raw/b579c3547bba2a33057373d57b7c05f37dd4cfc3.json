{"title": "Evaluation of Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Colloidal Gold- Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for Detection of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia (COVID-19)", "body": "greatly relieved.\n\nIn December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China novel coronavirus is a highly infectious disease, and the ongoing outbreak has been declared by WHO as a global public health emergency.\n\nA novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV is a distinct clade from the beta coronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1) . International Committee on\n\nTaxonomy of Viruses(ICTV)is announced that 2019-nCoV is officially classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(4,5 Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The nucleic acid-based assay has been used to confirm the diagnosis of new pneumonia, but many patients will miss the diagnosis.

The following are reported as follows:\n\nThis case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 28, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was obtained from patients. Jinyintan Hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of COVID-19, is first designated hospital for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan.

After collection, the throat swabs were placed into a sterile test tube with 1 ml sterile saline, the sputum samples were added equal volume of acetylcysteine (10g/L) and shaken at room temperature for 30 min to be fully liquefied, and total RNA was extracted using the nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit). In brief, 40\u03bcL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds.

The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff. Confirmed diagnosis is playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. A fast-performing serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and outbreak.\n\nIn this study, we tested serum samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients with two assay kits and achieved a high positive rate. The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%), and the healthy controls were negative. The case group was COVID-19 patients diagnosed by qRT-PCR. Since many patients are undergoing treatment, they are gradually recovering, the nucleic acid test result has become negative, so the positive rate of patients tested was only 51.9%.\n\nIt is worth noting that the new type of coronavirus antibody of the kit is against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus, not only against SARS-CoV-2, but the IgG originally infected with SARS may also be positive. But our research found, the healthy controls are all negative and the specificity is very good.\n\nELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they can offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected All rights reserved.

They use plasma or serum as test samples, and blood samples can be collected easily, which can greatly reduce the risk of infection for medical staff. The complicated processing procedure of the sample during the laboratory test is removed, the test result can be obtained quickly, the operation is simple, the safety of medical staff can be protected, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.\n\nAlthough ELISA and GICA are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference. Cases confirmation still depended on qRT-PCR, and analyze epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and other laboratory data. There is a need to further increase the number of samples tested to prove their t of sample testing to confirm their significance.\n\nIn conclusion, ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies is conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe for diagnosis COVID-19. The results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028787 doi: medRxiv preprint Table 3 Compare the sensitivity of the three methods All rights reserved.
