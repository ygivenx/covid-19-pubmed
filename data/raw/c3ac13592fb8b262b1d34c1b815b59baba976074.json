{"title": "", "body": "Bacteria Fungi Viruses \n\nBacterial infection of the esophagus is uncommon; it is usually seen in neutropenic patients or as infection extending from the lung. Most cases occur after epithelial injury by severe acid reflux or previous viral infection. Neutropenia secondary to hematologic malignancy, intensive chemotherapy, or bone marrow transplantation predisposes to bacterial esophagitis. 1, 2 Approximately 15% of infectious esophagitis is seen in immunocompromised patients, but it is less common in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in the oncology setting because of the relative sparing of granulocyte counts in AIDS. 3 Notably, immunomodulators, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, have been reported with esophageal bacterial infection. 3a Clinical symptoms include odynophagia, dysphagia, and retrosternal pain. Fever is reported in a minority of cases. 2, 4 Endoscopic findings are nonspecific and include mucosal friability, pseudomembranes, plaques, and ulcerations. Significant complications include perforation, fistula formation, and sepsis. 5 The most common bacterial agents belong to the normal flora of the mouth and upper respiratory tract, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, and Bacillus spp. Polymicrobial infection is common.\n\nBacterial infection evokes a marked neutrophilic exudate, cellular necrosis, and degeneration ( Fig. 10.1 ). In severely neutropenic patients, ulcers and pseudomembranes without substantial acute inflammation can be seen. Most bacteria can be identified in tissue sections by light microscopy with tissue Gram stain and oil immersion optics. The diagnosis of bacterial esophagitis is based on the presence of confluent bacteria invading subepithelial tissues (see Fig. 10 .1B). 2 Bacterial cultures of endoscopic biopsy samples are usually of little value due to bacterial contamination by the endoscope.\n\nEsophageal tuberculosis is usually caused by extension of infection from contiguous organs, particularly mediastinal lymph nodes, or from miliary spread. 6, 7 Autopsy studies show esophageal involvement in 0.15% of patients dying with tuberculosis. Primary esophageal tuberculosis is extremely rare. [8] [9] [10] The most common symptoms of esophageal tuberculosis are dysphagia, weight loss, and retrosternal pain. 11 Imaging modalities may show extrinsic compression by involved lymph nodes in the mediastinum, traction diverticula, stricture, kinking of the esophagus, sinus or fistulous tract, and pseudotumoral masses. 12 Chest computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography reveal extrinsic nodular masses, consistent with mediastinal lymphadenopathy showing central hypodensity, rim enhancement, and calcification. 8, 13 Endoscopic examination shows shallow ulcers with smooth border, a gray purulent base, and irregularly infiltrated edges. 14, 15 Synchronous endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) commonly shows matted, heterogeneous lymph nodes with hypoechoic centers. 7 The differential diagnosis includes carcinoma, fungal infection, syphilis, and Crohn disease. 16 In some cases, no preoperative diagnosis is established before esophagectomy 17, 18 ; however, even if a developed stricture has formed, antimycobacterial treatment can successfully save the patient from a complex surgical intervention. 19 The characteristic histologic features of esophageal tuberculosis include necrotizing, often confluent granulomas, which can be present at any level of the esophagus (Fig. 10.2) . A rim of lymphocytes may be present at the periphery. In some cases, granulomas are sparse, or hyalinized and calcified. Acid-fast stains may demonstrate the organisms, but culture confirmation is often required. 20 In a series of 32 cases, histology of the ulcers and fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes yielded a diagnosis in 84% of the cases. 7 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. tuberculosis can be a rewarding diagnostic approach. [21] [22] [23] [24] Other granulomatous conditions, including mycobacterial infection due to Mycobacterium kansasii or Mycobacterium bovis, fungal infection, and Crohn disease, should be excluded. Features favoring Crohn disease include the presence of transmural lymphoid aggregates with deep fistulas and fissures.\n\nCandidal infections yield small, yellow-white, raised plaques with surrounding erythema in mild disease-and confluent linear and nodular plaques or membranes covering a friable, erythematous, ulcerated mucosa in extensive disease-particularly in the middle and distal esophagus. 28 Erosion, ulcers, and strictures can develop. Fungi are densely adherent to the inflamed mucosa. In advanced disease the esophagus may become stenotic and show mucosal irregularities. In chronic cases, umbilicated, wartlike lesions may develop. The gross features are easily confused with pseudodiverticulosis, varices, or carcinoma. Rarely, fungal esophagitis leads to a botryoid appearance resembling clusters of grapes projecting from the mucosa, and mucosal bridges may form. In severe candidiasis, necrosis of the entire esophageal mucosa may be seen. 30 Candida spp. are characterized by a mixture of blastoconidial spores, 3 to 4 \u00b5m in diameter, and nonbranching pseudohyphae that may become quite large, up to 2 \u00b5m in diameter. True septate hyphae can also be seen. These structures are best seen with Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, and the presence of all of these structures is diagnostic of Candida infection ( Fig. 10 .3). Isolated budding yeasts without pseudohyphae or evidence of tissue invasion are often seen in inflammatory exudates at the ulcer bed; however, pseudohyphae or true hyphae are required for accurate diagnosis. Superficial colonization, particularly of nonviable tissue, does not necessarily indicate clinically significant disease. Although cytologic brushings from the plaques are more sensitive for fungal detection, biopsies are required to ascertain whether the fungus has invaded tissue. For this reason, it is important to indicate in the pathology report the types of fungal forms that are present (yeast, pseudohyphae, or both) and whether they are seen only in exudates or actually invading tissue.\n\nCandida infections also mimic other fungal infections, such as aspergillosis and histoplasmosis. Candida spp. can be differentiated from Aspergillus based on the width of hyphae, the presence of acute-angle dichotomous branching by Aspergillus spp., and the presence of blastoconidia in Candida infection. The presence of pseudohyphae in Candida generally differentiates it from Histoplasma capsulatum, but if only yeast forms are identified, the differentiation of Candida from Histoplasma may be difficult. However, tissue Gram stain almost always decorates the grampositive yeast forms of Candida.\n\nAspergillus, which is a ubiquitous fungus, rarely causes esophagitis. [31] [32] [33] [34] Several species can infect the esophagus, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. Aspergillus commonly colonizes immunocompromised patients [35] [36] [37] but can invade tissues and disseminate via the bloodstream, posing a life-threatening condition. Isolated gastrointestinal aspergillosis is relatively rare but has been reported. 38 Patients with esophageal aspergillosis present with painful or difficult swallowing and weight loss. Concurrent mucosal candidiasis may be present.\n\nEsophageal aspergillosis typically involves the mucosa and extends into the muscularis propria. When vascular invasion occurs, thrombosis and subsequent infarction may lead to perforation. Aspergillus is characterized cytologically by the presence of acute-angle branching septate hyphae with smooth, parallel walls, ranging in size from 2 to 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Characteristic conidiophores are rarely seen in this setting. Aspergillus can be differentiated from Mucor by its uniform thickness, mode of branching, and presence of frequent septation.\n\nsuperimposed on other infections, and efforts at identifying all possible pathogens are mandatory to design optimal treatment. Debilitated and immunocompromised individuals are susceptible to fungal infections, and irradiation, chemotherapy (including new targeted therapies), and chronic motility disorders are predisposing factors. Esophageal candidiasis is the most common cause of esophagitis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. 25, 26 Candidiasis Candida albicans is a constituent of normal flora. Although it primarily affects patients with predisposing conditions, Candida esophagitis can occur in apparently normal hosts. A variety of Candida spp. are pathogenic, including Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida stellatoidea, and Candida krusei. Of those, C. tropicalis tends to be more virulent, showing a propensity to invade submucosal blood vessels. 27 Patients with intact immunity usually develop inflammation at the infected site that limits penetration by the microorganisms.\n\nAcute candidal esophagitis is the most common manifestation. Presenting symptoms are nonspecific and include odynophagia, dysphagia, and retrosternal chest pain. Esophageal bleeding, perforation, stricture, sinus formation (with secondary pulmonary abscess), extensive necrosis, and systemic invasion are rare. 28 Subacute candidal esophagitis is an uncommon disease that usually affects asymptomatic and immunocompetent patients, but it can cause esophageal strictures and pseudodiverticula. It typically follows an indolent course. Chronic candidal esophagitis is also rare and is usually seen as a feature of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis that consists of several clinical syndromes, in cluding autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. These patients usually have other gastrointestinal manifestations, including malabsorption and loss of parietal cell function. 29 Candidal infections can result in significant morbidity and death, especially in high-risk patients. Patients who receive radiation therapy to the thorax for lung or esophageal cancer or inhaled corticosteroid for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are predisposed to candidal esophagitis. ulcers may coalesce to produce inflammatory exudates that grossly resemble Candida esophagitis. [45] [46] [47] [48] Typical histologic findings include focal ulceration, neutrophils in the lamina propria, and an inflammatory exudate with sloughed necrotic squamous cells. Aggregates of macrophages near the ulcer are characteristic of the inflammatory response. 49 Diagnostic cytopathic changes include nuclear molding, multinucleated giant cells, ballooning degeneration, and eosinophilic type A intranuclear inclusions showing margination of chromatin ( Fig. 10 .5). Cowdry\n\nBlastomyces, Histoplasma, Mucor, and Cryptococcus spp. rarely involve the esophagus 39 and usually only in patients with disseminated disease, but esophageal infection can arise from infections in contiguous structures, such as the lungs or mediastinum. 32 Patients with histoplasmosis can present with dysphagia resulting from esophageal compression by infected mediastinal lymph nodes or as a complication of mediastinal granuloma or sclerosing mediastinitis. Mediastinal granulomas can cause traction esophageal diverticuli. 39\n\nHerpes infection may be seen throughout the gastrointestinal tract but is usually limited to squamous epithelium-lined structures (e.g., esophagus, anorectum). Herpes esophagitis has been reported with both herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2, 40, 41 and it affects 0.5% to 6% of patients, primarily those who are immunocompromised due to AIDS, transplantation, or chemotherapy. However, immunocompetent adults and neonates also develop herpetic esophagitis. 42 Primary infections are common in neonates with disseminated HSV. 43 In adults the disease typically manifests as a reactivation of latent disease. Usually, a previously healthy, immunocompetent patient with a history of recurrent \"cold sores\" (i.e., nasolabial herpetic lesions) who presents with concurrent esophageal symptoms most likely has HSV esophagitis. In this setting, infections are self-limited. However, immunocompromised individuals may experience severe prolonged infections, and they are at risk for serious complications, including mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, strictures, tracheobronchial fistula, and disseminated infection. 44 The endoscopic appearance of HSV esophagitis varies with the time of infection. Early lesions consist of rounded, 1-to 3-mm, clear vesicles seen predominantly in the middle to distal esophagus. Subsequently the epithelial roof is eroded to leave small, 1-to 3-mm ulcers. After most of the HSV-infected squamous cells have sloughed off, characteristic sharply demarcated ulcers with raised margins and a yellow-gray base are seen ( Fig. 10.4) . The uninvolved mucosa usually appears normal. If infection progresses, the A B manifests as multiple, discrete, small, superficial ulcers in the middle or distal esophagus, but it may yield one or more large, flat, and elongated ulcers. Because HSV esophageal ulcers are rarely several centimeters in diameter, the presence of giant ulcers is suggestive of CMV esophagitis in patients with AIDS ( Fig.  10 .6A), although HIV-associated idiopathic ulcers may also become large. 56 Penetrating giant ulcers causing fistulas and pseudotumoral lesions may be seen in AIDS patients. 5 CMV esophagitis may coexist with both HSV and Candida infection in transplant recipients and AIDS patients. 1, 57 CMV cytopathic effects typically develop in endothelial cells and fibroblasts rather than in epithelial cells (see Fig. 10 .6). Therefore superficial biopsy specimens that contain only squamous epithelium or brushings for cytology are usually insufficient for the evaluation of CMV infection, and it is recommended that biopsies include the granulation tissue of the ulcer bed. Classic cytopathic effects of CMV include intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions surrounded by a halo with margination of the chromatin to the nuclear membrane. In contrast to HSV and VZV, multiple small cytoplasmic inclusions may be seen with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and to advantage with PAS and GMS. CMV can superinfect the ulcerations caused by HSV, and mixed infections are common in severely immunocompromised individuals ( Fig. 10.7) . Immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies or genetic probing for virus may be necessary to establish the diagnosis, especially if the patient has received antiviral agents prophylactically, because such agents can inhibit nuclear cytopathic changes.\n\nPrimary VZV infection (chickenpox) in immunocompromised children is often associated with severe visceral dissemination and has a mortality rate of 7% to 30%. 58,59 VZV esophagitis is rare and occurs in severely ill patients but not in AIDS patients. 3 VZV cytopathic changes are seen in epithelium, endothelium, and stroma cells and are indistinguishable from those of HSV. 60 Cytoplasmic rarefaction and vacuolization of the infected cells, as well as dissociation of the basal layer from the lamina propria, may be observed. To differentiate VZV infection from HSV type B inclusions are more frequently seen than type A inclusions. The edge of the ulcer and the sloughed squamous cells are the best places to sample for identification of the characteristic cytopathic changes. Viral culture is more sensitive than microscopic examination for diagnosis of HSV infection, and the combination of directed brushings and biopsy specimens submitted for culture and histology improves the sensitivity of endoscopic diagnosis compared with biopsy alone. 50, 51 Accurate diagnosis can be confirmed in situ by immunostaining with commercially available specific monoclonal antibodies.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of HSV esophagitis includes other viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. Their histologic features overlap, so immunostains and in situ hybridization are required to accurately distinguish them. It is important to distinguish HSV from other infections because specific antimicrobial agents are required for effective treatment.\n\nMultinucleated \"reparative\" squamous epithelial giant cells that are located predominantly in the proliferative basal and suprabasal zones of the preserved squamous epithelium have also been reported in the setting of reflux esophagitis, radiation therapy, and drug esophagitis. The epithelial giant cells may be confused with herpetic infection; however, the former typically lacks ground-glass nuclear inclusions and peripheral condensation of chromatin at the nuclear membrane. The multinucleated cells in herpes esophagitis are generally more prominent in the superficial aspects of the epithelium and in luminal inflammatory debris. An immunostain for herpes virus antigen can help to exclude HSV infection. 52\n\nEsophagitis is the second most common gastrointestinal manifestation of CMV infection after colitis. 53 CMV esophagitis is reported in the setting of HIV infection, renal dialysis, or organ transplant. The onset of symptoms is more gradual than that of HSV esophagitis and includes fever, odynophagia, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss, as opposed to the painful difficulties in swallowing and retrosternal pain commonly seen in HSV infection. 1, 54, 55 Endoscopically, CMV infection A B C infection, immunohistochemical staining with specific monoclonal antibodies is required. Esophageal infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) may manifest as erythematous macules, white plaques, nodules, exuberant frondlike lesions, or even ulcerations. [61] [62] [63] [64] Large lesions can be mistaken for malignancy on endoscopic examination, and small lesions may be confused with glycogen acanthosis. 65 Koilocytotic changes in squamous epithelium are characteristic. As in the cervix and anus, HPV infection is associated with well-defined papillomas (condylomas) and with mucosal hyperplasia.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) esophagitis is infrequently reported but can be seen in otherwise healthy patients with infectious mononucleosis. These patients present with odynophagia and hematemesis and develop denuded ulcers with erythema. 66, 67 Histologically, EBV-infected esophageal mucosa is comparable to oral hairy leukoplakia seen in AIDS patients; it is characterized by epithelial hyperplasia, parakeratosis, and koilocytosis. 68, 69 Deep biopsies show dense monocytic CD3-positive T cells. 66 EBV infections confirmed by in situ hybridization are also seen in AIDS. 69\n\nEsophageal ulceration is an important cause of morbidity in patients with HIV/AIDS and may result from a variety of factors. A prospective study reported that 50% of esophageal ulcers in HIV-infected patients were caused by CMV infection, and approximately 40% were classified as idiopathic ulcers. Other causes included HSV infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Candida infection, noted in 24% of the cases in an African study. 70 In 10% of patients, more than one etiology was discovered during long-term follow-up. 71 Acute seroconversion to HIV can produce multiple small esophageal ulcers with an intense inflammatory infiltrate. Based on the ultrastructural detection of viral-like particles in biopsy samples, it was hypothesized that HIV was responsible for the ulcerations in these individuals. 72, 73 Large idiopathic esophageal ulcerations, after thorough evaluation for other infectious agents, have been documented in 4% to 12% of HIV-infected patients with esophageal symptoms, especially those in late stages of AIDS. 57, 74, 75 Some have suggested that HIV is causative, based on demonstration of HIV by in situ hybridization 76 and positive immunohistochemistry and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV p24 core protein in macrophages lining the ulcerations. 77, 78 However, HIV PCR was also positive in the majority of the examined patients with CMV esophagitis, and HIV can be cultured in approximately 50% of esophageal specimens from otherwise asymptomatic HIVinfected patients, 79 raising doubt as to whether HIV is the cause of giant ulcerations. These patients may respond to systemic corticosteroid therapy, 76, 78, 80, 81 but treatment also predisposes patients to infectious complications (Table 10 .2).\n\nGiven the protective mechanism of low gastric pH, only a limited number of infectious agents have been demonstrated to thrive in the stomach, usually as a result of a high infectious burden or specific evolved protective mechanisms. Not surprisingly, immunodeficient patients are at greater risk for infectious gastritis. Although Helicobacter pylori is the most common cause of infectious gastritis, other agents also cause disease (Table 10 .3).\n\nAlthough CMV infection may occur in immunocompetent patients, 82, 83 gastrointestinal CMV usually occurs in immunocompromised individuals due to malignant disease, iatrogenic immunosuppression, or AIDS. 84 In these latter settings, CMV infection can be life-threatening, whereas CMV gastritis is generally asymptomatic in many patients with mononucleosis or like syndromes in immunocompetent patients. 83 Clinical symptoms include epigastric pain, fever, and atypical lymphocytosis. Endoscopically the gastric mucosa is congested and edematous, with multiple erosions and ulcerations. 85 A pattern of hypertrophic gastritis resembling M\u00e9n\u00e9trier disease and associated with protein-losing gastropathy has been described (commonly in immunocompetent pediatric patients). 86 Gastric involvement with HSV or VZV is rare, particularly in immunocompetent children, but may be associated with severe abdominal pain. 89 Reactivation of infection acquired at an early age is often the result of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or malignancies in immunocompromised patients. 90 In the latter the infection is particularly dangerous, with a 50% to 60% fatality rate despite the use of antiviral therapy. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and fatigue. Gastroscopic examination shows erosions and multiple small ulcers, at times yielding a\n\nThe biopsy specimens demonstrate mixed inflammatory infiltrates with characteristically enlarged endothelial, stromal, or epithelial cells showing diagnostic owl's-eye intranuclear inclusions. However, cytopathic changes can be difficult to identify, and multiple granular basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions may be seen instead. 87 It has been noted that inclusions are usually observed in the endothelial cells if the mucosa is not ulcerated, whereas they are commonly seen in endothelial and stromal cells when the mucosa is ulcerated. 88 Although Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is common in AIDS patients, the stomach is rarely involved. Gastric MAC may be associated with refractory chronic ulcers. Presenting symptoms include fever, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scans may show mesenteric lymphadenopathy. 101 Microscopic examination shows a lamina propria expanded by numerous foamy histiocytes. These aggregate in ill-formed, nonnecrotizing granulomas. AFB, often numerous, can be highlighted by Ziehl-Neelsen or Fite stain.\n\nPrimary gastric actinomycosis is a rare, chronic, suppurative disease. Symptoms include fever, epigastric pain, and bleeding. The stomach reveals a large, ill-defined ulcerative mass that mimics malignancy. Histologically, collections of neutrophils and sinuses are seen. A pattern of xanthogranulomatous gastritis also has been reported. 102 Actinomyces, a gram-positive, filamentous, anaerobic bacterium, is best observed with a silver stain. The finding of sulfur granules containing long, filamentous, gram-positive bacilli is diagnostic. 103\n\nSyphilitic infection of the stomach is rare but on the rise. Given the protean manifestations of this disease, gastric involvement in secondary or tertiary syphilis remains a diagnostic challenge. Endoscopic examination may show numerous shallow ulcerations with surrounding erythema, or a nodular mucosa with enlarged, thickened folds, suggestive of adenocarcinoma or lymphoma. Microscopic examination reveals severe gastritis with dense plasma cell infiltrates and varying numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Gland destruction, vasculitis with endothelialitis, and illformed granulomas are seen. Warthin-Starry silver stain or modified Steiner stain may reveal numerous spirochetes. However, in many cases, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence studies, and PCR are required to establish a definitive diagnosis (Figs. 10.8 and 10.9). 104\n\nFungal colonization of the stomach may be seen in patients with underlying malignancy or in immunocompromised patients cobblestone appearance, with ulcerated plaques or linear superficial ulcers. Microscopic examination reveals epithelial cells with ground-glass nuclei and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo. 91, 92 Acute gastritis due to EBV has been reported but is rarely biopsied because it may arise in the setting of infectious mononucleosis. The pathology is characterized by dense and diffuse lymphoid infiltrate with atypical lymphocytes that can mimic diffuse lymphoma. 93 Rare cases of acute measles gastric infection with giant cells of Warthin-Finkeldey type have been described. 94\n\nAcute suppurative gastritis is a rare disorder caused by bacterial infection of the submucosa and muscularis propria. In severe cases, necrotizing gastritis may result. 95 It is associated with ethanol abuse, upper respiratory tract infection, AIDS and other immunocompromised states, and infected peritoneal-jugular venous shunts; it rarely occurs as a complication of surgical biopsy. 96, 97 Patients are acutely ill with acute upper abdominal pain, peritonitis, purulent ascitic fluid, fever, and hypotension. The outcome is frequently fatal. Ultrasonography and CT may establish the diagnosis. 98 Gastroscopic examination reveals a thick and edematous gastric wall. The mucosa may be granular with a dark green exudate. The diagnosis is commonly delayed, and the mortality rate is high. Gastric resection combined with broad antibiotic therapy directed against the most common organisms is the treatment of choice.\n\nMicroscopic examination reveals an acute suppurative inflammation and edema of the submucosa and necrosis of muscularis propria with numerous gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Offending organisms include Streptococci, as well as S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and other gram-negative bacilli. 99 Intravascular thrombosis is common, and extensive mucosal and mural necrosis can be seen.\n\nEmphysematous gastritis is a rare variant resulting from infection by gas-forming organisms, most commonly Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Streptococcus, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Predisposing factors include gastroduodenal surgery, ingestion of corrosive material, gastroenteritis, and gastrointestinal infarction. In most cases, radiographic studies show gas bubbles conforming to the contours of the stomach.\n\nSince the introduction of pasteurization, gastric infection due to M. tuberculosis has been rare; it usually represents a secondary spread from pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient commonly presents with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, and weight loss.\n\nEndoscopic examination may demonstrate multiple bleeding ulcers or erosions; a narrowed, deformed antrum; and possibly gastric outlet obstruction due to a thickened wall. Microscopic examination may show an ulcerated mucosa, but the presence of necrotizing granulomas is diagnostic. The presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) can be confirmed on acid-fast staining, 100 but PCR for M. tuberculosis can also be contributory. However, the mere demonstration of granuloma is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis, since gastroduodenal Crohn disease and sarcoidosis should be entered into the differential diagnosis.\n\nreported in the United States. Patients typically present with epigastric pain as the parasite migrates into the gastric wall. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is not universal. Small hemorrhagic erosions are detected endoscopically, and microscopic examination shows either a phlegmonous reaction or an eosinophilic abscess with granulomatous features. The offending nematode larvae of Anisakis can be identified based on the presence of characteristic Y-shaped lateral cords and a Y-shaped intestinal lumen at midsection ( Fig. 10 .10). 113 The lateral cords of Pseudoterranova are characteristically butterfly shaped. Both lack the lateral alae of Ascaris larvae.\n\nRare examples of gastric infection by Ascaris lumbricoides have been reported in association with outlet obstruction caused by adult worms. 114\n\nH. pylori is a gram-negative rod that has a propensity to infect the gastric mucosa. H. pylori are 3.5 \u00b5m long and generally commashaped or slightly spiral in form. 115 The infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes chronic gastritis if the organisms are not eradicated. The majority of infected patients carry and transmit H. pylori without any symptoms. The prevalence of the infection varies worldwide, ranging from less than 15% in some cohorts to almost 100% in underdeveloped countries. 116, 117 Currently, despite a decrease of infection worldwide, at least 50% of the world's population is actively infected. The infection is transmitted by close personal contact.\n\nH. pylori produces active and chronic gastritis. The lamina propria is expanded by a mononuclear cellular infiltrate, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, and lymphoid aggregates and follicles can also be seen (Figs. 10.11 and 10.12). If lymphoid inflammation is prominent, the term follicular gastritis has been adopted. 118 Normally, lymphocytes rarely enter the epithelium. Various degrees of neutrophilic infiltrate, reported as evidence of activity, may be seen. There are significant variations among infected individuals, based on host factors and the strain of infection and its associated virulence factors. 119, 120 Among the latter, the presence of cytokeratin-associated gene (cagA) is associated with increased inflammation and risk of developing intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori swim freely within the gastric mucus layer that treated with antibiotics or corticosteroids. Candida infection also occurs in alcoholic patients and in those who have ingested corrosive chemicals. The organisms can be found on H&E-stained sections but are more readily seen with PAS with diastase or silver stains. The mucosa shows multiple, aphthous, and linear ulcerations, or single or multiple larger ulcers. Microscopically the superficially necrotic, fibrinopurulent mucosa is infiltrated by yeast and pseudohyphae.\n\nFungal contamination of peptic gastric ulcer with Candida spp. is not uncommon and is likely of limited clinical significance, although it remains a matter of debate. These ulcers tend to be larger and are more often suspected of being malignant. 105 Gastric histoplasmosis is a rare condition that may manifest with hypertrophic gastric folds, masses mimicking adenocarcinoma, or small ulcerations. 106 Biopsy shows intense infiltration by macrophages containing H. capsulatum. Fatal hemorrhage from gastric ulcer has been reported. 107 Gastric phycomycosis is rare and highly lethal. It is classified as either invasive or noninvasive. The former type is characterized by deep invasion of the gastric wall and blood vessels. Ulceration and hemorrhagic necrosis of the mucosa and wall, with infiltrating pigmented nonseptate hyphae, are seen. 108, 109 Parasites Gastric parasitic infections are rare and are reported in specific clinical settings. For example, cryptosporidiosis has been reported in AIDS patients. 110, 111 The stomach is rarely affected by Strongyloides stercoralis, although colonization of peptic ulcers has been reported, and diffuse mucosal involvement may be seen in immunosuppressed patients. On biopsy, the parasite is easily identified infiltrating the mucosa. 112 Gastric invasive anisakiasis is commonly acquired after ingestion of raw shellfish containing the nematode larvae of Anisakis, although cases caused by Pseudoterranova spp. have also been overlays the apical side of the gastric surface cells, as well as in the foveolae. [120] [121] [122] In patients taking proton pump inhibitors, the organism translocates deep into the gastric glands ( Fig. 10.13 ). Although H. pylori-induced damage is related to humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms, the morphologic activity varies significantly, from mild, with rare neutrophils seen, to severe, with glandular microabscesses.\n\nH. pylori-associated chronic gastritis includes a heterogeneous group of clinical and pathologic changes. The most common phenotype observed at our institution is a mild antral gastritis or pangastritis with limited disruption of gastric acid secretion and usually no symptoms. A second syndrome, the duodenal ulcer phenotype, shows a marked antral gastritis with high gastric secretion and preserved fundic mucosa. The patients commonly experience symptoms of duodenal ulceration.\n\nAlthough approximately 90% of infected patients experience spontaneous regression, 123-125 some gastritis progresses with time.\n\nOverall the lifetime risk of ulcer disease is 5% to 10%, and these patients have a 3 to 6 times increased risk of developing gastric cancer. 126 When chronic gastritis develops, the mucosa undergoes changes that include glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia of the body fundus mucosa, accompanied by hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria. These changes increase the risk of gastric dysplasia and carcinoma. It has been calculated that once chronic atrophic gastritis develops, the patients have up to a 16-fold increased risk of developing gastric cancer. They are also at risk for development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma).\n\nIn most cases, H. pylori can be identified in H&E-stained sections, although special stains (e.g., Giemsa, silver stains) and specific immunohistochemistry can aid in the detection of bacteria ( Fig. 10.14) .\n\nHelicobacter heilmannii is a rare cause of diffuse, antralpredominant gastritis. The organism, in the past reported as Gastrospirillum hominis, is larger than H. pylori and shows corkscrew-like spirals. The infection by the gram-negative rod may be acquired from contact with domestic pets (dogs, cats) and cattle. The patients present with epigastric pain or dyspepsia, and the endoscopy commonly shows patchy antral erythema, but in some cases pangastritis can be observed. Histologically a mild chronic, active gastritis is confined to the antrum with a 5-to 9-\u00b5m long, tightly coiled organism with corkscrew appearance present on the epithelial surface. 127 H. heilmannii infection has been associated with the development of MALT lymphoma but \n\nnot with gastric cancer. Special stains used for H. pylori also highlight this organism ( Fig. 10.15 ). [128] [129] [130] [131] Infections of the Small Bowel\n\nAlthough most E. coli strains are harmless, some can cause serious food poisoning. The harmless strains belong to the normal intestinal flora and benefit the host by producing vitamin K2 132 or by preventing the establishment of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine. 133 135 ; they avidly adhere to the epithelial brush border via specific receptors, and the histology of the intestine in infected individuals is often normal. Of the invasive forms, EPEC preferentially colonize the small intestine before causing diarrhea. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. EPEC is a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, and some types of EPEC are also an important cause of traveler's diarrhea. The mucosal biopsy reveals moderate-to-severe damage with irregular atrophy of surface epithelium and subnuclear vacuolization of crypt epithelium. Ultrastructural study reveals bacteria adherent to enterocytes with flattening of microvilli, loss of the cellular terminal web, and cupping of the plasma membrane around individual bacteria-characteristic attachment-effacement lesions. 136 cellular debris, surrounded by small lymphocytes. The centers of these monocytic-rich foci consist of amorphous eosinophilic debris and degenerating cells.\n\nThe interfollicular and diffuse areas are replaced by phagocytic monocytes showing round to irregularly shaped nuclei and intermingled with small, mature lymphocytes. Neutrophils are rare, even in the areas of mucosal ulceration. The inflammatory process breaches the muscularis propria and may extend into the serosa. Small mucosal erosions in uninvolved portions of the ileum reveal a predominantly lymphoid infiltrate with germinal center formation and clusters of monocyte-macrophages, most likely representing early lesions. 139 The regional lymph nodes show a necrotizing lymphadenitis and marked sinusoidal and paracortical expansion due to a proliferation of monocyte-macrophages identical to those seen in the intestine. Subcapsular sinuses are distended by monocytes but may be compressed or obliterated. Macrophages may be actively phagocytic with many containing intracellular apoptotic bodies and cell fragments. The necrotic foci tend to be well circumscribed with a rim of foamy macrophages that blend smoothly with the reminder of the node. 139 The closest mimic of S. typhi enterocolitis is Yersinia infection. [140] [141] [142] In both lesions the terminal ileal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes are distorted by lymphoid and histiocytic hyperplasia; however, deep, penetrating ulcers and abundant epithelioid granulomas are characteristic features of Yersinia infections and not of S. typhi enterocolitis. Also in the differential diagnosis, especially of the nodal involvement, are histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease) and sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-Dorfman disease). However, these entities rarely involve the intestine as the primary site. 139\n\nSalmonella typhi usually causes a mild, self-limited illness, but older adults, infants, and immunocompromised patients may develop a serious course with sepsis and death. A worrisome feature is that there is growing evidence showing that multidrug resistant S. typhi strains are increasing worldwide. 137 Nontyphoid species (Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella muenchen, Salmonella anatum, and Salmonella give) infections result in milder, self-limited gastroenteritis.\n\nBased on a study that examined intestinal function and jejunal biopsy specimens obtained soon after the recovery phase from acute disease in 29 patients with Salmonella infection, normal or near-normal small-intestinal histology was seen in more than 90% of cases, despite defective absorption, which was transiently observed in 50%. The remaining patients developed partial villous blunting with increased inflammation in the lamina propria and surface epithelium associated with reactive epithelium. 138 If the disease manifests with severe gastrointestinal bleeding that requires surgical intervention, Salmonella spp. commonly involve the ileum and cecum. In these cases the bowel wall is thickened, and the mucosa displays erosions and ulcers that can be aphthous, linear, discoid, or full thickness in nature ( Fig. 10.16A ). Perforation with or without fistula formation may be seen. 139 Microscopically there is ileal and cecal mucosal thickening resulting from a predominantly monocytic infiltrate. Low-power examination shows nodular and diffuse areas of infiltration, with the latter present predominantly at the center of the lesion (see Fig. 10 .16B). The nodules are of two types. The first is a germinal center rimmed by a ragged and compressed mantle zone. The second and predominant type of nodule consists of uniform sheets of monocyte-macrophages with numerous apoptotic bodies and \n\nDarmbrand (burnt bowels) in northern Germany after World War II, where starved children and adults developed it after ingestion of large meals of meats and vegetables. It was prevalent between 1944 and 1948 but then disappeared in Europe as the nutritional status of its population improved. In 1963 a similar disease was reported from the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, where predominantly male children and young adults presented with severe abdominal pain after ceremonial feasting on large amounts of sweet potatoes and inadequately cooked pork contaminated with pig intestine. It was termed \"pigbel,\" a pidgin English term for abdominal pain following a pig feast. Nowadays, enteritis necroticans is rarely seen in developed countries, and the majority of affected subjects are diabetics. 150, 151 An impaired ability to degrade exogenous toxins due to decreased secretion of pancreatic protease in diabetics and individuals on low-protein diets, or the presence of natural protease inhibitors in sweet potato or soybean flour, together with delayed transit through the small intestine, may contribute to this unique form of clostridial infection. 150 Histopathologically the lesion starts abruptly in the proximal jejunum and usually extends distally to the ileum and cecum. Affected bowel segments are dilated, edematous, markedly congested, and thickened. Unaffected skip segments may be seen. Sloughing of the necrotic mucosa leaves severely ulcerated lesions, and transmural inflammation may be seen in severe cases.\n\nThe pathology varies depending on the severity and duration of disease, but common findings include mucosal necrosis with or without pseudomembrane formation, marked submucosal edema and hemorrhage, and fibrinous or fibrous serosal exudate ( Fig. 10.17 ). Severe cases are accompanied by transmural necrosis and perforation. Pneumatosis may be observed. The necrosis tends\n\nEleven Vibrio spp. are recognized to cause human infection. [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] Infection with Vibrio cholerae results in cholera, an important cause of watery diarrhea and dysentery that may lead to significant dehydration and death. Although the disease is widespread, the role of intestinal biopsy is limited because V. cholerae is a noninvasive, toxin-producing organism that causes minimal or no histologic changes. The intestinal mucosa appears to be intact, with mucin-depleted, dilated crypts in a background of edematous lamina propria with vascular dilatation and no significant inflammation. Ultrastructural examination reveals widening of the intercellular spaces and alteration of apical junctional complexes prominently in the villus epithelium, whereas blebbing of the microvillus border and mitochondrial changes occur in the crypt epithelium. The extent of the changes correlates with clinical severity. 149\n\nOf several forms of Clostridial infections, enteritis nectoticans is unique because it primarily involves the small intestine, whereas the others are typically seen in the colon.\n\nEnteritis necroticans is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the commensal organism C. perfringens (welchii), type C, a \u03b2 toxin-producing strain. It is characterized by segmental necrosis of the proximal jejunum and a high mortality rate if not diagnosed early and appropriately treated. It can be related to food poisoning but is not associated with hospitalization or antibiotic therapy. In addition to antibiotics, advanced cases require surgical resection of necrotic bowel. The disease was first reported as \n\nIn accordance with the distribution of lymphoid tissue, the ileocecal region is affected in 90% of patients with M. tuberculosis infection involving the gastrointestinal tract. Grossly, intestinal tuberculosis displays an ulcerative, hypertrophic, or mixed pattern. The ulcerative form, characterized by multiple superficial ulcers, is most common and has been associated with a virulent clinical course and high mortality. The hypertrophic form is least common and mimics Crohn disease because of its scarring, fibrosis, and heaped-up mass lesions. 166 In the ulcerohypertrophic form, the intestinal wall becomes thickened and ulcerated by an inflammatory mass that consists of mesenteric fat, fibrotic tissue, and inflamed lymph nodes. It is centered on and frequently obscures the ileocecal valve. 167 Tubercles begin in the Peyer patches or lymphoid follicles, giving the mucosa a cobblestone appearance. As disease progresses, they involve the entire intestinal wall with multiple nodules that may also produce serosal and mesenteric \"studs.\" The ulcerative form of the disease begins as ragged ulcers that vary in number and size. In contrast to Crohn disease, tuberculous ulcers are circumferential, with a long axis perpendicular to the lumen; fissure formation that extends into the muscularis propria may be seen. 166 The ulcers may contain AFB, even in the absence of granulomas. The mucosa appears edematous and hemorrhagic.\n\nHypertrophic lesions are caused by pronounced mural thickening with ulceration and obstruction. Fibrosis, strictures, and stenosis that developed in the healing process of ulcers may be broad, at times several centimeters in length. Epithelioid granulomas with obvious caseation (Fig. 10.19 ) occur more frequently in ulcerative than in hypertrophic lesions and are distributed throughout the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. Regional mesenteric lymph nodes become enlarged and also contain areas of caseous necrosis.\n\nIsolated organisms can be detected in the granulomas and lymph nodes with the use of special stains and are recoverable in tissue culture. However, tissue samples are positive for AFB in to be more prominent at the crown of plicae circulares, whereas the mucosa may appear normal at the vale of plicae circulares. 151 The necrotic mucosa is often covered by large numbers of clubshaped, gram-positive rods, ranging in length from 0.5 to 1.2 \u00b5m. Immunohistochemistry or PCR for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 toxins of C. perfringens, type C (designated cpa and cpb, respectively) confirms the diagnosis. 150, 151 \n\nThe genus of Yersinia includes three species that are pathogenic for humans and rodents: Yersinia pestis (the causative agent of plague), Yersinia enterocolitica, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. These gram-negative coccobacilli most often cause self-limited enterocolitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis in humans. 152 An acute abdomen presentation due to acute gastroenteritis, colitis, or pseudoappendicitis resulting from acute terminal ileitis is the most characteristic manifestation of the disease. Patents with iron overload, 153-155 those receiving desferrioxamine, [156] [157] [158] those with liver disease, 154 and those who are immunocompromised or debilitated 159 are at an increased risk of severe disease. Yersinia can occasionally cause extraintestinal manifestations, such as arthritis and erythema nodosum, [156] [157] [158] as well as fulminate septicemia and peritonitis. [153] [154] [155] 160 Enteropathogenic Yersinia strains have a tropism for lymphoid tissue. 161 Bacteria bind to and invade M cells within the epithelium overlying the lymphoid follicles of Peyer patches. 162, 163 Following their entry into the Peyer patches, the bacteria induce a host immune response characterized by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. 164 Because of its lymphoid tropism, Yersinia infections preferentially involve the ileocecal and appendiceal regions, although any segment of the small or large intestine can be affected. 165 The intestinal wall is congested and edematous. Diffuse or focal aphthous mucosal ulcers can develop. The serosa appears dull and hyperemic. Enlarged lymph nodes contain yellowish microabscesses that may become matted.\n\nMicroscopically, severe active enteritis with cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and ulceration can be seen in both Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis infections. Crypt hyperplasia occurs throughout the small intestine, with villous atrophy. 141 Sharply demarcated areas of lymphoid hyperplasia contain prominent germinal centers. The follicular ileitis may persist for months. Notably, the mucosa overlying the follicles develops small, punctate, aphthoid ulcers resembling the early mucosal lesions of Crohn disease. 141 The ulcers are covered by fibrinopurulent exudates and large numbers of gram-positive coccobacilli. Epithelioid granulomas with central necrosis and prominent lymphoid cuffing are usually present in the mucosa, submucosa, and lymph nodes but can also be seen on the serosa and lymph nodes (Fig. 10.18) . The muscularis propria and serosa may exhibit mixed inflammatory infiltrates including eosinophils. Acute vasculitis and intussusception have been reported to cause segmental bowel ischemia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of Yersinia infections includes Crohn disease, and this can be difficult to distinguish on histologic grounds alone. Cultures requiring special media, 165 serologic titers, and PCR assays must be considered in the evaluation of a patient for inflammatory bowel disease, in particular Crohn disease, or a patient with suspected Crohn disease for whom steroid therapy has failed, before more aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is considered. 165 Features favoring a diagnosis of Crohn disease include crypt distortion, muscularis mucosae thickening, and prominent neural hyperplasia; these features are evidence of chronicity. only approximately one-third of cases. 168 In this setting the detection of mycobacterial DNA in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue by duplex PCR can confirm the diagnosis. Other mycobacteria (e.g., M. kansasii, M. bovis) can produce similar pathologic features.\n\nAlthough granulomas are characteristic of tuberculosis, they can be seen in other causes, including fungal infections and Crohn disease. The latter may be difficult to distinguish from tuberculosis; transmural lymphoid aggregates, deep fistulas, and fissures favor Crohn disease (Box 10.1).\n\nMAC is an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. Disseminated MAC infection is usually seen in patients with advanced HIV infection, generally those with CD4-positive T-lymphocyte counts lower than 50 cells/\u00b5L, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 169, 170 Since the induction of antimicrobial prophylaxis and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of disseminated MAC infection has dramatically declined, leading to improved survival. 171 Disseminated MAC infection results from a primary infection, and its common portal of entry in AIDS patients appears to be infiltrate of plump macrophages exhibiting granular foamy cytoplasm (Fig. 10.20) . However, the overall architecture of the intestine is usually preserved. Other inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, are sparse, if present. Regional lymph nodes display comparable infiltrates. Epithelioid granulomas are rarely seen 173 ; if present they are poorly formed and rarely contain multinucleated giant cells. Small areas of necrosis are present in up to 30% of cases. 175 If necrosis is marked, the infiltrates are easily recognized on H&E stain even on lowpower magnification, but detection of focal involvement may require special stains. In addition to Ziehl-Neelsen and Fite stains, the PAS stain highlights mycobacteria. In contrast to M. tuberculosis infection, mycobacteria are usually present within macrophages and not in giant cells or areas of caseous necrosis.\n\nWhipple disease is a multisystem disease that results from infection with a gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium, T. whipplei. It is a rare disorder, and only approximately 1000 cases have been reported to date. Although it occurs in people of all ages, it typically affects middle-aged white men. 176 T. whipplei appears to be present in the general environment, although neither its source nor its mode of transmission is well established. Because an association between Whipple disease and Giardia lamblia infection has been reported, it is plausible that both microorganisms occupy the same ecologic niche. 177 Considering that many people may be exposed to T. whipplei but the disease develops in only a fraction of them, it is likely that undefined predisposing immune factors exist. 178 Several studies have demonstrated defective function of macrophages, with inability to degrade bacterial antigens efficiently, the gastrointestinal tract. 172 The mycobacteria penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa by yet undetermined mechanisms. This occurs rapidly, and solitary organisms can be seen in the lamina propria without apparent mucosal abnormality. Mycobacteria within the lamina propria are phagocytosed by macrophages, but intracellular killing does not occur. Instead, the macrophages become stuffed with organisms as they multiply intracellularly. With continued bacterial replication, the host cell ruptures, leading to the presence of sheets of AFB-laden macrophages. Unimpaired replication of mycobacteria results in massive thickening of the intestinal wall, 173 and infection spreads via mural lymphatics to involve lymph nodes. Mycobacteria replicate in the lymph nodes as well, and eventually the normal histology of the lymph nodes is effaced. Hematogenous dissemination occurs concurrently. Reticuloendothelial organs, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, are the most frequent distant sites. 172 The common presenting symptoms include diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Gastric ulcer, enterocolitis, enteric fistulas, intraabdominal abscesses, and hemorrhage can also be seen as gastrointestinal manifestations. 174 Intussusception secondary to hyperplasia of Peyer patches can occur, and clinical and radiologic pictures may resemble ileal Crohn disease. The duodenum is most frequently involved, followed by the rectum, ileum, colon, esophagus, jejunum, and stomach, for unknown reasons. On endoscopic examination, multiple raised, yellowwhite nodules are seen in the duodenum, but the mucosa may appear normal. Other endoscopic findings include, in descending order, ulceration, erythema, edema, friability, confluent nodules, and strictures. 174 Histologically the nodular lesions show atrophic mucosa with villous blunting, as well as widening of lamina propria by an A B most likely due to inadequate production of interleukin-12 (IL-12), 179 which may lead to diminished production of interferon-\u03b3 by T cells and defective macrophage activation. A decrease in IL-12 production may prevent the development of an effective type 1 helper T-cell immune response and favor a shift toward a type 2 helper T-cell response. Replication of T. whipplei in macrophages is associated with apoptosis of the host cell that correlates with the expression and release of IL-16. 180 Whipple disease is characterized by two stages: a prodromal stage and steady-state stage. The prodromal stage is marked by protean symptoms, along with chronic nonspecific findings, mainly arthralgia and arthritis. The steady-state stage is characterized by weight loss, diarrhea, or both, and occasionally by other manifestations secondary to other organ involvement. 181 The average time between the prodromal and the steady-state stage is 6 years. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy, such as corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor antagonists, may experience more rapid clinical progression. 182, 183 Whipple disease involves the small intestine, and jejunum and ileum more frequently than the duodenum. 184 On endoscopic examination, pale yellow, shaggy mucosal changes, attributed to lipid deposits, alternating with eroded, erythematous, or mildly friable mucosal patches, are often seen in the distal aspect of the duodenum and jejunum. 185, 186 The histologic hallmark of Whipple disease is the presence of macrophages with cytoplasmic PAS-positive, diastase-resistant granules or sickle-form particles; these are known as sickleform particle-containing cells, or SPC cells. Bacilli may also be seen within and between epithelial cells, especially before the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. 186 Intestinal villi are blunted and distorted by the collections of macrophages. Subtotal or total villous atrophy can be seen in severe cases, whereas the villous architecture is relatively normal in about one-fifth of the cases. 186 The majority of macrophages accumulate in the lamina propria of the villi, just beneath the luminal epithelial basement membrane ( Fig. 10.21) . A small number of macrophages may also be seen in the pericryptal lamina propria or submucosa or both. 186 Lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells can be seen amidst the macrophage collections. Although rare, nonnecrotizing granulomas composed of epithelioid cells, which are PAS-negative in 40%, may be present in the mucosa, lymph nodes, and other organs, resembling sarcoidosis. 185, 187, 188 Lymphatic obstruction can cause dilatation of lacteals leading to lipid deposits in the mucosa.\n\nAntimicrobial treatment may affect the histology of the disease. With a decrease in the number of PAS-positive macrophages, a change occurs in the pattern of mucosal involvement. It may go from diffuse to patchy; the distribution of macrophages may shift from the villous interstitium to the pericryptal interstitium; and the intensity of PAS-positive staining may diminish. 185 PAS-positive macrophage collections in the intestinal lamina propria can be seen in other entities. These include M. aviumintracellulare infection, histoplasmosis, chronic granulomatous disease, xanthomas, storage disease, and common variable immunodeficiency. Although the macrophages may appear similar in these conditions, lipid deposits are seen only in Whipple disease. Whipple disease can be differentiated from MAC infection with negative acid-fast staining. Importantly, given that 10% of the patients do not show characteristic histologic features, 185 PCR assay is required to confirm the diagnosis in clinically suspicious cases with nondiagnostic histology (Table 10 .4).\n\nTropical sprue is an intestinal malabsorption syndrome that affects residents and visitors to the tropics, including Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, northern South America, West Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. 189 Although its etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear, an infectious cause is strongly suspected because of the occurrence of tropical sprue particularly in rural areas with poor hygiene, susceptibility of visitors from developed countries in endemic regions, 190 and a favorable response to antibiotic therapy. 191 Patients also have been shown to have aerobic bacterial contamination of the small bowel, although no specific microorganisms are common to all patients. 192 In addition, preexisting prolonged orocecal transit time may contribute to the disease process in some patients. 192 Diagnostic evaluation of tropical sprue requires its differentiation from infectious etiologies, especially parasitic diarrheal diseases and Whipple disease, and from other malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease. Jejunal biopsies are necessary to establish the presence of characteristic histology and to exclude other diseases.\n\nHistologic features of tropical sprue consist of incomplete villous blunting of the duodenum, chronic inflammatory cell infiltration (plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and particularly eosinophils), and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. 193 Nuclear-cytoplasmic maturational dissociation (i.e., nuclear enlargement and decreased mitotic figures) may be observed in the enterocytes. 194, 195 The histologic findings, although similar to those of celiac disease, are not identical, and total villous atrophy is rare (<10%) in tropical sprue. [196] [197] [198] Of note, the ileum displays more marked inflammation and villous blunting than the proximal small bowel. 193 The disease first involves the proximal small intestine, then spreads distally to the ileum. In the early stage the mucosa may appear normal or may show only increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In well-established disease the pathologic changes become at least equally prominent in the ileum. 198 Conversely, celiac disease commonly shows prominent mucosal changes in the proximal small intestine. This difference in disease distribution explains the more common association of tropical and involvement of the small intestine is seen in 27% 200 ; however, in contrast to other forms of disseminated histoplasmosis, fever and pulmonary involvement are unusual in gastrointestinal histoplasmosis. 201 Terminal ileal involvement is commonly seen. Deep ulcerative lesions with undercut margins are characteristic of H. capsulatum involvement, 201 but masses mimicking carcinoma, pseudopolyps, and lesions resembling xanthomas may also be seen. 202 Histologically, yeast forms ranging from 2 to 4 \u00b5m in size lie within well-formed granulomas or macrophages scattered in the lamina propria in a pattern resembling Whipple disease or early enteritis caused by M. avium-intracellulare ( Fig. 10.22 ).\n\nSmall intestinal candidal infections are rare in immunocompetent individuals with intact mucosal integrity, but they can be seen in sprue with megaloblastic anemia caused by deficiencies of vitamin B 12 and folate.\n\nCandida and Aspergillus spp. account for the majority of fungal infections of the small bowel. In comparison to Candida, Aspergillus hyphae are often seen in submucosal vessels spreading within the bowel wall in a radiating pattern. 199 Other fungi that can involve the small bowel include Histoplasma, Mucor, Paracoccidioides, and Penicillium marneffei. Of these, H. capsulatum is the most common endemic systemic mycosis in the United States; it occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in the central regions of the country. Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in 40% of patients with disseminated disease, \n\nApproximately 20 million Americans develop acute gastroenteritis related to norovirus every year. Most affected patients do not seek care, but 1.6 million do. Approximately 14% of those seeking urgent care need hospitalization, and up to 0.2% of them may die of associated complications. 210 In a large study of 1099 cases, it is shown that the overall incidence of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis (among those who sought medical attention) was 5.6 per 1000 person-years. However, the rate was higher among children younger than 5 years (25.6 per 1000 person-years), followed by that of adults 85 years and older (7.8 per 1000 person-years). 209 Acute infection with norovirus leads to reversible histopathologic changes in the jejunum, with apparent sparing of stomach and rectum. [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] They are rather nonspecific, characterized by villous blunting with mononuclear and polymorpholeukocytic infiltrations in the lamina propria. These changes are generally clear within 2 weeks after the onset of illness, but some changes may last as late as 6 weeks after the onset.\n\nCMV infection of the small intestine accounts for only 4% of all CMV infections, and CMV infection of the duodenum accounts for 22% of all CMV infections of the gastrointestinal tract. 216 Immunosuppressed patients, including not only those with HIV infection but also those who undergo small bowel transplantation for short bowel syndrome, are prone to CMV infection. The latter group of patients show a high incidence of recurrence due to the heavy immunosuppression required to manage the graft. 217, 218 In this setting, PCR analysis of small-intestinal biopsy specimens may be a sensitive method for early detection of CMV and can be useful for preemptive therapy. 219 The clinical manifestations of CMV infection include a wide spectrum of symptoms, such as malaise, anorexia, fever, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, ileus, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation. Severe complications, such as hemorrhage and perforation, are often preceded by up to 20% of patients with disseminated infection in autopsy. 203 All Candida spp. can infect immunocompromised patients, but there is a higher frequency of disseminated C. tropicalis. 27 The gross appearance is variable; it includes mucosal flecks, sloughed membranes, ulcers of varying configuration, and nodular masses. Most invasive Candida infections are superficial 199 and must be carefully differentiated from benign colonization. In colonization, Candida spp. may be identified embedded in the fibrinopurulent exudate that covers blind loops or in devitalized tissues without invasion of viable tissue. In immunocompromised or chronically debilitated patients, Candida can also invade deep into the intestinal wall and gain entry to the microvasculature, leading to ischemia and sepsis.\n\nThe genus Emmonsia contains three species that are associated with human disease: Emmonsia crescens and Emmonsia parva that cause adiarpiromycosis and Emmonsia pasteuriana. Infection caused by a new Emmonsia spp. (that is most closely related to E. pasteuriana) is a newly described HIV-associated dimorphic fungal infection. A report of the New England Journal of Medicine 204 presented a series of 13 cases, all in HIV patients and identified in Cape Town, South Africa. Most patients present with fever, loss of weight, anemia, and skin lesions. The extent of the gastrointestinal involvement has not been well described, but we have seen a case with gastric involvement (courtesy Dr. Tomas Slavik).\n\nNumerous viruses, including rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, Norwalk virus (norovirus), coronavirus, echovirus, enterovirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus, [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] can cause gastroenteritis. Diagnosis is made based on viral culture, electron microscopy, ELISA of stool specimens, or genetic probes. Pathologists rarely obtain biopsies from patients with viral enteritis, but if they do, the bowel displays nonspecific findings, such as reactive and degenerative changes of the epithelium and a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the \n\nand macrophages). Furthermore, combination antiretroviral therapy has led to improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms in these individuals. 224 Two competing hypotheses have been advanced to explain the diarrheal disease of mucosal HIV infection. It has been suggested that HIV enteropathy is a pathophysiologic consequence of exposure to gp120, which arises from mononuclear cells of the lamina propria, and therefore is independent of epithelial HIV infection. [225] [226] [227] Others have argued that the diarrhea is driven by cytokines (tumor necrosis factor and related moieties) released from infected lymphoid cells that can inhibit mucosal ion flux, 228, 229 resulting in malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss. [230] [231] [232] Vacuolated enterocytes may show conversion from columnar to cuboidal morphology, with cellular apoptosis, seen in a background of either villus and crypt atrophy or hyperplasia (Fig.  10.24) . These epithelial changes are associated with mild mucosal inflammation, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and dilated lacteals. The histologic changes are often mild and disproportionate to the symptoms. 233, 234 vague symptoms for up to 2 weeks. 220, 221 The mortality associated with CMV enteritis is related to older age (>65 years) and delay in instituting therapy but not to the anatomic site of the infection. 222 CMV enteritis tends to involve only a single region, rather than causing a panenteric infection. 223 The pathologic changes range from few stromal or endothelial cells exhibiting CMV viral inclusions with no tissue reaction to frank ulceration and perforation. Almost any cell type may be infected, although CMV most frequently involves vascular endothelial or stromal cells (Fig.  10.23) . The infected and swollen endothelial cells lead to luminal compromise, with fibrin thrombi formation that results in ischemic mucosal injury and, subsequently, ulceration. 220\n\nHIV enteropathy is a poorly defined clinical entity that represents pathogen-negative diarrhea in an HIV-infected individual. The possibility that it is related directly to local HIV infection is supported by the detection of HIV proteins and nuclear acids in various cell types of the intestine (i.e., epithelial cells, lymphocytes,\n\n\u2022 Figure 10 .23 CMV infection superimposed on chronic ischemia of small intestine. The resection specimen of small intestine from a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection who presented with small-bowel obstruction reveals chronic enteritis with ulceration and mural fibrosis (A). Proliferating capillaries in the submucosa contain endothelial cells exhibiting atypical CMV cytopathic changes, that is, cytomegaly with multiple small eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm (arrowhead) (B) that react with CMV immunostain (C).\n\nC They exhibit two identical nuclei and a ventral concave sucking disk with four pairs of flagella, two axonemes, and two median bodies. 235 Disruption and distortion of the intestinal microvilli occurs at the site where the ventral disk interfaces with the microvillus membrane. 238 The duodenal and/or jejunal biopsies from infected patients with normal absorption demonstrate preserved villous architecture with or without signs of epithelial damage, and intraepithelial lymphocytes are not increased (Fig. 10.25) . Conversely, infected patients with proven intestinal malabsorption are likely to show mild to marked villous blunting, inflammatory expansion of the lamina propria, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. [239] [240] [241] [242] However, a flattened mucosa is rarely seen. Even without apparent histologic abnormalities, trophozoites are usually found if at least two biopsy specimens are obtained from the duodenum. 239 The organisms can be detected in gastric or ileal biopsies and rarely in the colonic biopsies as well. 240 Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the small intestine may also be seen. 239 Patients whose biopsies lack lamina propria plasma cells usually have coexisting hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\nIf normal or relatively preserved villous architecture is present, the differential diagnosis includes celiac sprue (Marsh I classification), other infectious agents (e.g., postviral enteritis, cryptosporidia, bacterial overgrowth), nongluten food sensitivity (especially in children), use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory\n\nGiardia intestinalis (G. lamblia) is the most prevalent human protozoan pathogen and the leading cause of water-borne diarrheal outbreaks in North America. G. intestinalis infection is associated with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Serious diarrhea illness with intestinal malabsorption and marked weight loss can be seen in young children and in previously unexposed adults, particularly travelers from low-to high-prevalence parts of the world. Infants and young children may suffer impairment of growth and development. However, in the vast majority of individuals worldwide, the parasite is apparently carried without significant morbidity. 235 The life cycle of Giardia includes two stages: cyst and trophozoite. The former is the infectious form; it is both relatively inert and environmentally resistant. After ingestion, excystation occurs in the duodenum as a result of exposure to gastric juice and pancreatic enzymes, yielding two trophozoites from each cyst. 236, 237 These trophozoites replicate in duodenal crypts and in the upper jejunum, reproducing asexually by binary fission. 235 The cysts may be round or oval and measure 11 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m 2 . They each have four nuclei, axonemes, and two median bodies. The trophozoites are 10 to 20 \u00b5m in length and 5 to 15 \u00b5m in width and have the shape of a teardrop when viewed from the dorsal or ventral aspect. drugs, autoimmune disorders, immunodeficiency, and inflammatory bowel disease. If villous blunting is present, the most important differential diagnosis is celiac sprue (Marsh III), given that both conditions are often associated with intestinal malabsorption. Other diseases to consider would include tropical sprue, autoimmune enteropathy, immunodeficiency, nongluten food sensitivity, and infectious enteritis or protracted infection of the small intestine. However, with careful review of the smallintestinal biopsies, the offending trophozoites can usually be identified.\n\nCryptosporidium, Microsporidium, Isospora, and Cyclospora have all been identified in the small intestine of AIDS patients but are also important pathogens in otherwise healthy persons, including infants and children in developing countries (Table 10 .5). 243, 244 Of these, microsporidia are single-celled, obligate intracellular parasites that have been reclassified from protozoa to fungi but will nevertheless be discussed in this section. 245 Transmission is via the fecal-oral route, either by direct contact or through contaminated water or food. 244 In immunocompetent individuals, infection is usually selflimited and typically lasts for a few days but may persist for up to 4 weeks. Symptoms often consist of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malaise. Nausea, vomiting, and fever may be reported. Conversely, immunocompromised patients are at risk for severe and chronic diarrhea that may be life threatening. Weight loss and cramping abdominal pain are proportional to the severity of the diarrhea.\n\nOther enteric opportunistic pathogens may infect profoundly immunocompromised patients. 244 Patients with isosporiasis are likely to have peripheral eosinophilia. Endoscopic examination often shows normal intestinal mucosa or mild erythema, mucosal granularity, atrophy, and superficial erosions. Although all four coccidians primarily involve the mucosa of the small intestine, especially in the distal segment, the colonic mucosa and biliary tract can also be involved in the setting of heavy infection. 244 Diagnosis is usually based on the examination of stool specimens. Less frequently, examination of duodenal/jejunal aspirates \n\nCoccidians Morphology with special stains can establish the diagnosis. Evaluation of small bowel biopsy specimens by electron microscopy may be more sensitive than stool examination for the diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis (Figs. 10.26 and 10.27) . 246, 247 With the development of sensitive diagnostic tests (e.g., ELISA), immunohistochemistry, and PCR, 63 it is likely that low-intensity infections will be more frequently identified, with some probably of little clinical significance. 244\n\nPinworms are one of the most common human parasites and tend to infest young children. They have a worldwide distribution, but they are more commonly seen in cold or temperate climates and in developed countries. The worms live and reproduce in the ileum, cecum, proximal colon, and appendix; however, pathologists are most likely to encounter them in colonic specimens, usually as an incidental finding in the appendix.\n\nThe distribution of ascariasis is worldwide, with the greatest frequency being in moist tropical climates. The mode of infection is fecal contamination of toys, soil, and fingers; contaminated raw vegetables; and drinking water. Usually children are more vulnerable than adults to Ascaris infection. Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may complain of vague abdominal pain. However, massive infection with obstruction, perforation with peritonitis, appendicitis, and pancreatobiliary obstruction does occur. [250] [251] [252] Tissue damage may be seen primarily at the sites of attachment, but adult A. lumbricoides in the small intestine usually produces no diagnostic lesions. [250] [251] [252] This nematode (roundworm) is characterized by its large size, even in its larval form. The female worms reach lengths of greater than 30 cm; males are somewhat smaller. The helminth displays an annulate, multilayered cuticle with prominent hypodermis and conspicuous lateral cords. The female pseudocoelem includes paired genital tubes that contain innumerable ova which, when mature, exhibit prominent mamillations ( Fig. 10.28) . Even if the organism is no longer viable, it can be readily identified by virtue of its size.\n\nThe distribution of hookworm (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale) is worldwide, with particular prevalence in rural areas of the moist tropics where there is inadequate sanitation and people walk barefoot. The filariform larvae penetrate the skin of the feet or hands, enter venules, and are carried to the capillaries of the lung, where they break through the capillaries into alveolar sacs. They subsequently migrate through proximal airways to the gastrointestinal tract. Adult hookworms are creamy white, cylindrical nematodes with a large buccal capsule that includes teeth or cutting plates. 251, 253, 254 The patients are usually asymptomatic, but dyspepsia, nausea, and epigastric discomfort may occur. In addition, because the worms attach to the intestinal mucosa and withdraw blood from villous capillaries, the patient develops anemia if the infestation is left untreated.\n\nMucosal damage is usually minor, but dense eosinophilic infiltrate extending into the submucosa or villous blunting may be seen. Biopsy specimens may occasionally reveal intestinal mucosa in the buccal cavity of the worm. 251, 253, 254 \n\nThe distribution of S. stercoralis is worldwide, with the greatest prevalence in warm and wet regions. Adults, especially old, hospitalized, institutionalized, or immunocompromised individuals, are more prone than others to be infected by Strongyloides.\n\nFilariform larvae penetrate the skin, enter the venous system, travel to the lung, and migrate up the proximal airways and down into the esophagus, eventually reaching the small intestine. Adult female worms parasitizing human small intestine lay eggs in the intestinal mucosa that hatch into rhabditiform larvae, which are In all coccidial infections, the small-intestinal mucosa shows nonspecific findings, including normal intestinal mucosa in lowdensity infections or intraepithelial lymphocytosis, various degrees of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and mixed inflammation in the lamina propria if the organism burden is high. 248, 249 The diagnosis is based on organism morphology by light microscopy and/or ultrastructural examination of biopsy specimens. Microsporidia are difficult to detect in H&E-stained sections, but special stains, such as GMS, PAS, modified acid-fast, modified trichrome, auramine, Warthin-Starry, and Brown-Brenn stains, can aid greatly in the diagnosis (see Table 10 .5).\n\nThe conventional method used to diagnose gastrointestinal helminth infections is examination of stool for ova and parasites, but pathologists may at times encounter these organisms in endoscopic biopsies or in resection specimens. Thus helminths that can affect the small intestine are briefly described in this section. The female worms range in size from 2.5 to 4.3 mm, and the male worms are slightly smaller. C. philippinensis eggs, 36 to 45 \u00b5m long, are barrel shaped with flattened bipolar plugs. C. philippinensis resembles Trichuris and Trichinella spp. but is distinguished from them by its characteristic ova. The symptoms of infection are nonspecific and include dull gastric pain or generalized abdominal pain, as well as watery and voluminous diarrhea with an increased amount of fat. Intractable diarrhea can lead to ascites and weight loss, followed by cachexia and death. The natural course of the disease is relatively rapid, and the period between onset of symptoms and death is as short as 2 to 3 months. 251, 253, 263, 264 Grossly the small intestine is thickened, congested, and distended with fluid. An extremely large number of adult worms, larvae, and ova may be seen within the jejunum, the proximal portion of the ileum, and occasionally the duodenum. Worms are most commonly found in the crypts of the small intestine, but they may also invade the lamina propria. The intestinal villi tend to exhibit secondary changes, such as villous atrophy and epithelial sloughing ( Fig. 10.30) . 251, 253, 263, 264 Trematodes Schistosomiasis is the most common disease caused by trematodes worldwide. All Schistosoma spp. cause disease, and any level of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. However, pathologists are most likely to encounter the organisms in colonic specimens.\n\nF. buski infection is prevalent in countries of eastern Asia and the southwest Pacific, and the highest incidence is reported in eastern China. Transmission of the fluke to humans is via ingestion of aquatic plants, such as water chestnuts, containing infective metacercariae. These encyst in the duodenum, attach to the mucosa, and mature into adult worms in approximately 3 months. 250, [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] The adult is a flat, fleshy, ovate trematode that is 2 to 7.5 cm in length (Fig. 10.31 ). Eggs measure 130 to 140 \u00b5m in length and are ellipsoid, with a small operculum at one end. 250, [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] The majority of infections remain asymptomatic; however, in cases of heavy infection, patients may develop diarrhea, often alternating shed in the stool. In an unfavorable environment, rhabditiform larvae transform into filariform larvae (parasitic phase). In the autoinfection cycle, rhabditiform larvae change into infective filiform larvae in the intestine or on the perianal skin and directly invade the host. This autoinfective capability leads to prolonged illness. Disseminated infection (i.e., migration of larvae to organs beyond the range of the autoinfective cycle) can occur in immunocompromised hosts and results in severe, life-threatening illness. 250, 251, [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] Systemic parasitic infection predisposes to gram-negative sepsis.\n\nAdult female worms are 2 to 3 mm in length, with 1-to 2-\u00b5m thick cuticles and fine transverse striations. Eggs are 50 to 60 \u00b5m, oval, thin shelled, and embryonated when they exit the female. Rhabditiform larvae are 200 to 300 \u00b5m, and filariform larvae are 300 to 600 \u00b5m. 250, 251, [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] Many patients are asymptomatic carriers, but abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding, in any order or combination, have been reported. Ileus, small-bowel obstruction, and malnutrition also occur. CT scans occasionally reveal intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Gastrointestinal manifestations can be accompanied by pruritus, rash, eosinophilia, and pulmonary symptoms. 250, 251, [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] Mucosal lesions may lead to esophagitis and gastritis, in addition to duodenitis, jejunitis, ileitis, and colitis with pseudomembranous colitis. Mucosal ulceration is most commonly seen in the small intestine, but it can occur at any level of the gastrointestinal tract. Histologically the crypts are often distended by numerous larvae and adult worms (Fig. 10.29 ), but the organisms may be difficult to detect due to their patchy distribution. Other histologic features include villous blunting, ulcers and necrosis, edema, and a dense eosinophilic infiltrate of the lamina propria. Granulomas may also be seen. 250, 251, [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] \n\nAlthough endemic in the Philippines and Thailand, cases of C. philippinensis have been reported in nonendemic areas. Transmission to humans is through ingestion of freshwater fish infected by larvae. The worms inhabit both the small and large intestine. At autopsy, as many as 200,000 worms can be recovered from a liter of intestinal contents. Autoinfection is attributed to the huge numbers of the organisms. 251 with constipation, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, and hemorrhage, secondary to intestinal obstruction and mucosal injury. In addition, the absorption of parasitic metabolites can cause generalized edema, which is most striking in the face. The duodenum and jejunum are most severely affected, with the large adult worms attaching to the mucosa and inducing an intense inflammation with possible ulceration and abscess formation. Leukocytosis and peripheral eosinophilia are also frequently associated with fasciolopsiasis. 250, [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] \n\nAdult Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), and Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm) are among the largest parasites that infect humans, and they occasionally cause gastrointestinal disease. Approximately 40% of patients with Hymenolepis nana (dwarf tapeworm) infection have low vitamin B 12 levels because the tapeworm competes with the host for the vitamin. 250, 270, 271 \n\nAlthough there is worldwide variation in the most common intestinal infectious agents, diseases that were once considered tropical are no longer diagnosed only in distant exotic places but may be encountered anywhere, as a result of international travel and migratory populations. In the West, breakdown in sanitary handling of food and contamination of poultry flocks, as well as the use of raw or partially cooked foods, have led to epidemics of infectious colitis. 272 Infectious colitis manifests as an acute diarrheal disease frequently associated with hematochezia or microscopic evidence of blood loss. In North America the diarrheas, commonly of bacterial etiology, are usually self-limited and are commonly referred to as acute self-limited colitis. However, in immunodeficient patients, presentations may be severe and a benign clinical outcome less certain.\n\nIn response to infection the colonic mucosa shows remarkable histologic variability. In practice, the dilemma is to distinguish between infectious colitis and the early manifestations of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Early in the course of infectious colitis, edema of the lamina propria with clusters of neutrophils and ectatic capillaries are the dominant findings. Established crypt abscesses are rare. The changes are commonly patchy, and the overall mucosal architecture is preserved. Minimal degenerative changes, limited to the upper half of the mucosa, can be seen. These include mucin depletion and epithelial damage with flattened cytoplasm associated with cryptic dilatation. Concurrently, the inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria is mixed, characteristically with more neutrophils than lymphocytes and plasma cells. Microthrombi can plug dilated capillaries and can account for the focal hemorrhage of the lamina propria.\n\nLater in the course of the infection, biopsies may show scattered neutrophils, inflammation with slightly decreased goblet cells, mucin depletion, and cellular degeneration, sometimes with vacuolization. A mild increase in plasma cells is commonly noted in the lamina propria, sometimes in association with lymphoid aggregates. However, a well-established dense basal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate is uncommon. These changes habitually resolve in 2 to 3 weeks or certainly within a trimester. [273] [274] [275] \n\nEscherichia coli. E. coli is the most prevalent aerobic bacterium of the gut. Five variants are responsible for most common diarrheal illnesses (ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, EHEC, and EAEC species). 276 The ETEC species include O157:H7, which produces a verotoxin and results in a hemorrhagic colitis with features similar to those of ischemic colitis. The diarrheogenic E. coli (ETEC, EAggEC, and EIEC E. coli) account for more than 50% of traveler's diarrhea. 277 In North America, E. coli O157:H7 is the strain most commonly associated with the hemolytic and uremic syndrome. Its pathogenicity is attributable to two Shiga-like toxins (I and II). These toxins interact with a mucosal receptor in the Peyer patches. The absorbed toxins eventually cause epithelial and endothelial damage of not only the colon but also the kidneys. [278] [279] [280] Incubation takes approximately 4 days, and the illness lasts approximately 1 week. In many cases the disease is self-limited, with minimal or even no diarrhea.\n\nThose who develop a colitis may show various endoscopic appearances, ranging from normal mucosa to edema, erosion, and pseudomembranes. The histologic findings include overlapping features of both ischemic colitis and infectious colitis. Submucosal edema, hemorrhage, pseudomembranes, and withering crypts are seen, along with marked inflammatory infiltrate and cryptitis ( Fig. 10.32) . 281, 282 Aeromonas. Members of the bacterial genus Aeromonas produce a wide area of virulence factors and have been associated with cases of gastroenteritis, particularly in young children. Chronic symptoms also have been reported. 283 Campylobacter. Campylobacter bacteria rank among the most common causes of infectious diarrhea. Most infections are selflimited cases of simple diarrhea, occasionally associated with systemic symptoms, but severe infections can occur. Domestic animals, particularly poultry, are reservoirs of infection, and the (particularly ulcerative colitis) who are receiving maintenance immunomodulation therapy, and it is associated with exacerbation of the disease. It appears to play a minor role in sporadic diarrhea. It is well established that C. difficile infection follows exposures to antibiotics targeting gut anaerobes, and transmission occurs nosocomially from one host to another.\n\nSome researchers have created a risk score to identify patients at risk for C. difficile infection after hospitalization. A model based on age, past hospitalizations, and use of third/fourth-generation cephalosporin, clindamycin, or fluoroquinolone antibiotics resulted in a predictive risk score with patients within the low-risk group developing C. difficile colitis with 28 days or more of hospitalization at a much lower rate than those within the highrisk group (0.3% vs 1.6%). 288 Toxigenic C. difficile is responsible for more than 90% of cases of pseudomembranous colitis and 30% to 40% of cases of antibiotic-associated colitis. The diarrhea usually begins within a few days after antibiotics are started. Some patients develop pseudomembranous colitis, whereas others suffer only mild diarrhea.\n\nPseudomembranous colitis due to C. difficile shows a spectrum of histologic changes, beginning with mild lesions that exhibit a luminal spray of mucus and neutrophils above a background mucosa with minimal inflammation. More advanced disease shows marked inflammatory erosion of the lamina propria covered by a fibrinopurulent cap and cystification of crypts. Finally, mucosal inflammation and erosion extends to form confluent pseudomembranes. In some patients, toxic megacolon ensues. 289 A signet ring cell-like morphology can be see due to mucosal degeneration, but in this setting the finding of signet ring cells should not be mistaken as indicating a carcinoma (Figs. 10.34 to 10.36). 290 The standard for diagnosis of C. difficile is a toxin test that is positive in more than 90% of patients with classic histologic changes of pseudomembranous colitis. organism is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Infections peak in summer and early fall and generally result from ingestion of contaminated food or water.\n\nCampylobacter jejuni, the most important species, produces typical infectious colitis that lasts from 1 to 7 days. The symptoms usually begin with a prodrome of fever, headache, and myalgias 12 to 24 hours before the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. Colitis is reported in up to 80% of infections. Colonoscopic findings are nonspecific and range from segmental ulceration to diffuse colitis. 284 Organisms may be seen in the lamina propria by ultrastructural analysis, and granulomatous changes with giant cells may also occur. On biopsy, a focal active colitis is observed. 285 Rare cases produce changes mimicking ulcerative colitis. 284 Complications include toxic megacolon and the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 286, 287 Shigella. The enteroinvasive Shigella bacteria cause mucosal changes resembling those of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nSalmonella. Salmonella spp. are associated with a common form of infectious diarrhea. Classic typhoid fever due to S. typhi is primarily an ileal disease (see earlier discussion). However, nontyphoid salmonellosis may involve the colon as well.\n\nAt endoscopy, a wide range of nonspecific changes are seen. These include mild edema with petechial hemorrhage and, in severe cases, friability and ulceration. The histologic changes are indistinguishable from other types of bacterial diarrhea and some inflammatory bowel diseases, especially if the specimens were obtained early in the course of inflammatory bowel disease. Complications include the occasional development of toxic megacolon ( Fig. 10.33) .\n\nClostridium difficile. C. difficile is a gram-positive bacillus that produces two principal toxins that play a role in pathogenesis of disease. Toxin A is an enterotoxin responsible for food accumulation in the gut and for damage to the enterocolonic mucosa; toxin B is a labile motility-altering cytotoxin that leads to food accumulation.\n\nThe spectrum of C. difficile colitis ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant colitis. The presence of C. difficile infection has been steadily increasing in recent years, particularly among institutionalized patients, and it currently represents a major cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. C. difficile infection is also prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis of the colon, which is increasing in prevalence due to global travel, is essentially limited to the ileocecal region. Most patients have concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis. The tubercle bacillus can reach the gastrointestinal tract by several routes, including swallowed sputum, infected food, adjacent tissues, lymphatic spread, and via the bloodstream. Colonoscopy can be challenging, given the presence of ulceration and hypertrophic polypoid masses. Ulcerative, hyperplastic, and sclerotic variants may be seen. The differential diagnosis includes ileocecal Crohn disease and carcinoma. 291 Biopsies reveal mucosal ulceration, granulation tissue, and microabscesses. Characteristic necrotizing granulomas are usually seen in the ulcer bed. The granulomas in tuberculosis are much larger than those seen in Crohn disease. They are confluent, and caseation is a common feature. AFB are demonstrated in 35% to 60% of cases. If M. tuberculosis is suspected, acid-fast staining of tissues and cultures is required to establish the diagnosis, and the development of PCR technology can increase the diagnostic yield.\n\nIntestinal Spirochetosis. The prevalence of intestinal spirochetosis in rectal biopsies is between 2% and 7% in the West but between 11% and 34% in developing countries. Homosexual men and HIV-infected patients are reported to have the highest prevalence (up to 54%).\n\nWhether the organism is of clinical significance or is a commensal bacterium has been debated. Colonoscopy reveals mucosal erosions and hyperemia. Histologically the irregular luminal aspect of the surface epithelium seen on H&E-stained sections is emphasized by PAS or Warthin-Starry stains. Ultrastructural analysis also identifies the spirochetes. The disorder is most frequently seen in the right colon. 292 The spirochetes or brachyspira, Brachyspira aalborgi and Brachyspira pilosicoli, are found between and parallel to the microvilli and do not penetrate the cytoplasm Yersinia. Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are gramnegative aerobic coccobacilli. The latter species causes colitis that usually involves the terminal ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes (see earlier discussion). In Y. enterocolitica-associated acute colitis, the mucosa is erythematous and friable, with tiny superficial ulcerations. Granulomas are absent, but aggregates of histiocytes are frequently seen. or without colitis. The diagnosis of CMV infection depends on the identification of characteristic intranuclear inclusions. Infected cells typically show endothelial, stromal, or epithelial nuclear and cytoplasmic enlargement with a single, dark red, amphophilic nuclear \"bull's-eye\" inclusion. However, in the gastrointestinal tract, it is not uncommon for infected cells to show indistinct, smudged, hematophilic nuclei. The cytoplasm of the infected cells can show either granular inclusion or a foamy appearance. The diagnosis can be rendered difficult by granulation tissue arising secondary to the ulceration and the reactive stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry allows a diagnosis to be made in atypical cases, especially in inflammatory bowel disease patients. CMV cytopathic changes are often atypical and are seen in a small number of stromal cells; thus conducting immunohistochemistry with a low threshold is advised. 297 HSV is a common cause of proctitis in male homosexual patients, in AIDS patients, and in other immunosuppressed individuals. The ulcerations commonly demonstrate peripheral giant cells. Nonspecific cases of severe acute colitis with widespread ulceration have been reported. 298 Adenovirus is believed to be a common cause of diarrhea in children and patients with HIV infection. Infected vacuolated epithelial cells are found close to the mucosal surface, with amphophilic nuclei that can be either enlarged or crescent shaped, and the presence of virus can be confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Small intranuclear inclusions are also visible.\n\nThe diagnostic identification of protozoa is best done by examination of fresh stool. There is no characteristic histologic pattern on biopsy, and the organisms are usually overlooked on sections unless a careful inspection is made.\n\nEntamoeba histolytica is found in all climates. Infection is acquired via fecal contamination and ingestion of cysts. In the West a history of foreign travel to areas of poor sanitation is common, although sexually transmitted cases have been recognized. Infected individuals may present with various symptoms, including toxic megacolon. The range of symptoms is explained in part by the existence of 22 different zymodemes.\n\nEarly in infection, edema and nonspecific inflammation with clusters of neutrophils are seen in the lamina propria and surface epithelium. The amebas may be present on the surface, usually in the overlying inflammatory exudate. With time, a large, flaskshaped ulceration may develop. The epithelium shows goblet cell depletion and microulceration with organisms in the exudate overlying the denuded lamina propria (see Fig. 10 .38). Although there are numerous neutrophils in the lamina propria, crypt abscesses are not conspicuous, and tissue eosinophilia is not a feature.\n\nDeep necrosis with ulceration extending to the submucosa can be seen in severe cases. The mucosa is replaced by a thick, amorphous inflammatory fibrinoid material with abundant organisms and scattered inflammatory cells. The infective trophozoites are at times substantially larger (10 to 60 \u00b5m) than macrophages, display foamy amphophilic cytoplasm with ingested erythrocytes, and sport a punctate central karyosome (Fig. 10.39) . The PAS stain aids in recognition of the amebas but obscures the presence of the diagnostic karyosome and ingested erythrocytes, and a trichrome stain aids in detection of erythrocytes in the cytoplasm. in most cases (Fig. 10.37 ). Mild inflammation may be seen in colonic biopsies. Improvement of symptoms and decrease in immunoglobulin E plasma cells within the lamina propria has been observed after treatment with metronidazole. Cases of severe colitis are rare but have been reported. 293, 294 Viruses Many viruses, including rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, CMV, herpesvirus, and adenovirus, can produce colitis. CMV, HSV, and adenovirus are considered here because they are the only ones likely to be identified on endoscopic biopsies. A wide array of changes, from normal or edematous mucosa to ulcerative colitis, may be seen (Fig. 10.38) .\n\nAlthough CMV infection is usually subclinical, symptoms are common in immunologically suppressed patients, such as patients with AIDS, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, transplant recipients, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 295, 296 CMV colitis can be recognized by the presence of ulceration with in the major mesenteric veins, and the disease is caused primarily by an inflammatory reaction to the eggs. The rectal mucosa and submucosa are a good location for identification of S. mansoni eggs, whereas those of S. japonicum are generally seen in the right colon. The presence of miracidial nuclei indicates that organisms are viable. The ova of S. mansoni are characterized by subterminal spines, whereas the eggs of S. japonicum have ill-defined subterminal knobs. The eggs are usually surrounded by inflammatory infiltrate in which eosinophils predominate. A granulomatous reaction may develop. In some cases the eggs are surrounded by an eosinophilic zone of fibrin material, representing an antigenantibody complex. With time, fibrosis develops around the calcified ova. The lateral spine of S. mansoni and the cortical shell stain variably with modified AFB stain; unlike paragonimiasis, the ova are nonrefractile. In countries with endemic infection the entire colon may become fibrotic, studded with polyps and ulcers. There is an increased incidence of adenocarcinoma in these patients (Figs. 10.41 and 10.42). 301, 302 Strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, and oxyuriasis are common nematode infestations of the lower gastrointestinal tract. Although S. stercoralis is usually restricted to the small intestine, migratory larvae can implant in the colonic mucosa, leading to autoinfection, particularly in the setting of massive infestation. The parasites are found in crypts and superficial mucosae, usually surrounded by transmural eosinophilic inflammation. 303 Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) preferentially infests the cecum. The body structure of the worm is unique. The anterior threefifths of the worm is threadlike and embeds into the mucosa, whereas the remainder of the organism floats within the lumen. The esophagus shows a characteristic stichosome, and the anterior wall shows characteristic bacillary bands. The posterior part of the worm exhibits the reproductive organs ( Fig. 10.43) . Trichuris causes chronic dysentery. On biopsy, the worm is usually surrounded by an intense focal eosinophilic infiltrate.\n\nOxyuriasis, or Enterobius vermicularis, is the most prevalent parasitic helminth recognized in the West. The adult pinworm attaches to the cecal mucosa, and the worm is commonly observed in the lumen of the appendix. Symptoms result from the nocturnal migration of the adult female; she lays eggs on the perianal skin, causing intense pruritus. Diagnosis is classically established by Of note, antidiarrheal preparations can destroy the protozoa and should be avoided before biopsy. Current diagnostic tools include antigen detection in stool and PCR (see Figs. 10.38 and 10.39). 299\n\nCoccidia is a collective name for the suborder that includes other human pathogens, such as Isospora, Sarcocystis, and Toxoplasma. The diagnosis of these intracellular pathogens is difficult to evaluate on colorectal biopsy. Cryptosporidium parvum can be seen in immunocompromised and normal subjects, but with a markedly different clinical presentation. The former may present with severe diarrhea, sometimes with toxic megacolon. In the setting of AIDS, several other microorganisms are frequently associated. In immunocompetent individuals, C. parvum infection usually manifests as a self-limited, flulike gastroenteritis; it has also been noted as a cause of traveler's diarrhea.\n\nOn biopsy, a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate and rare ulceration are seen. Cryptosporidia are observed as clusters of tiny hematoxylin dots on the epithelial surface or within the crypt. PAS, silver, or Giemsa stain is also helpful in highlighting the organisms (Fig. 10.40 ).\n\nGiardiasis is more commonly recognized in the small bowel, but rare cases of colonic infection have been documented.\n\nBalantidium coli is a ciliated protozoan. Patients are infected through contact with pigs or rats under conditions of poor personal hygiene. After ingestion of cysts, the trophozoite resides predominantly in the colon. The mucosal lesions are similar to those of amebiasis. Symptoms may include acute diarrhea, fulminant colitis, and perforation. Asymptomatic carriers are recognized. 300\n\nThree classes of helminths can lead to human infection: trematodes (flukes), nematodes (roundworms), and cestodes (tapeworms). Only schistosomiasis leads to colorectal infestation.\n\nSchistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum are the two common trematode worms affecting the colon. The adults reside seen in association with disrupted crypts. A common differential diagnosis is ulcerative colitis, and the diagnosis is confirmed by immunofluorescent methods. The inflammatory infiltrate may be transmural or may give a pattern of follicular proctitis. Strictures and adenocarcinoma have been reported in chronic infection.\n\nadhering the deposited ova to cellophane tape and examining them under the microscope. Refractile ova are characteristically flattened on one side. The helminth is small, shows a muscular wall, and exhibits prominent lateral alae projecting from the cuticle throughout its length. The central oviducts contain the characteristic flattened eggs. The surrounding mucosa is generally inflamed, and tissue eosinophilia may be present (Fig. 10.44 ). Inflammatory reaction may produce a presenting polyp or even a mass, sometimes mistaken for a carcinoma. 304 Aberrant migration can lead to similar lesions in the vagina and bladder.\n\nFungal infections of the large bowel are rare. They are commonly opportunistic infections of immunocompromised hosts, although in some regions, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis are endemic. Histoplasma is the organism most likely to involve the gut, and the diagnosis depends on identification of the fungus on biopsy. This is best achieved with silver stains. The dimorphic fungus is most often represented in its yeast form, but mycelial growth may be present. The mass mimics carcinoma, from which it must be distinguished.\n\nProctitis is common in homosexual men and is frequently related to infection by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, chlamydia, or HSV. 305 The symptoms of gonorrhea, caused by the gram-negative diplococcus N. gonorrhoeae, vary from pruritus to severe proctitis and diarrhea. Biopsies frequently are not diagnostic and show either normal mucosa or nonspecific inflammatory change. Fewer than 5% of patients show infectious proctitis. 306 Secondary syphilis can manifest as proctitis. The changes include marked inflammation, in which small granulomas with giant cells are usually prominent. 305 Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that ranks among the most common causes of sexually transmitted clinical proctitis. 305\n\nIn acute cases of lymphogranuloma venereum, the mucosa shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Giant cell granuloma can be "}
