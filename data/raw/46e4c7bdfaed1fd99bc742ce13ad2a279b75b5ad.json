{"title": "Increased susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) infection induced by a hypercholesterolaemic diet with increased adsorption of MHV3 to primary hepatocyte cultures", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3), a member of the Coronavirus group, is azl interesting model for studying the pathogenesis of virus-induced hepatitis in mice. Susceptibility to MHV3 infection is genetically determined (Le Pr~vost et aL, 1975a, b; Virelizier, 1980) . Accordingly, BALB/c mice, a susceptible strain, develop acute hepatitis and die after 3-4 days of infection, whereas A/J mice, a resistant strain, develop mild disease with the appearance of a small number of necrotic foci in the liver which disappear 8 to 12 days later. The degree of virus replication in different tissues varies from one strain of mouse to another (Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Arnheiter et al., 1982; Pereira et al., 1984a) .\n\nSubmitted April 20, 1990, accepted January II, 1991.\n\nData from our laboratory have already shown that administration of a hypercholesteroiaemic diet (HC) increases the mortality produced by MHV3 in A/J mice and that, under these conditions, the Kupffer cells lose their ability to be activated in vitro by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Pereira et al., , 1987 . It seemed interesting, firstly, to study whether the return to a normal diet ended the susceptibility and re-established resistance, and secondly, if there was a change in the in vitro behaviour of hepatic cells from HC animals towards the virus.\n\nIn order to do this, hepatocytes from HC mice were isolated and cultured and their susceptibility to MHV3 studied. This paper shows that resistance to MHV3 infection may be dietmodified and that this modification is also reflected in hepatocyte cultures.\n\nTen-week-old mice of the inbred A/J Orl strain (Centre d'61evage des Animaux de Laboratoire, CNRS, Orl6ans, France) were used in all experiments. Control mice were fed laboratory chow (NR) and experimental mice were fed an HC diet for 3 weeks. rhe comoosition of the HC diet was as follows: 52 We sucrose, 18.5 070 casein, 18 070 lard, 1 070 cholesterol, 0.5 070 cholic acid and vitamin supplements (Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle, Paris, France). After 3 weeks of the HC diet, a group of mice were refed laboratory chow for 2 weeks (HCNR).\n\nMouse hepatocytes were obtained using methods based on those of Berry and Friend (1969) and Seglen (1976) but modified for mice. Mice were injected intravenously with heparin (500U/100~d) and anaesthetized intraperitoneally with sodium pentobarbital (6 rag/100 ~l). The livers were perfused in situ via the portal vein with 0.5 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis ([3-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'tetraacetic acid) in Ca + +-and Mg + +-free Hank's balanced salt solution (pH 7.45) at 37\u00b0C. After 5 rain at a flow rate of 13 ml/min, the perfusion solution was replaced by 0.05 070 collagenase (specific activity 0.21 U/rag, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) in Williams medium E (pH 7.45~ (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) for 7 to 9 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. All solutions were oxygenated and kept at 40\u00b0C to maintain the perfusion at 37\u00b0C. After perfusion, the livers from which the gallbladders had been removed were, placed in a plastic Petri dish containing a small amount of collagenase solution. They were then gently combed with forceps to obtain isolated hepatocytes.\n\nThis cellular suspension was filtered through a nylon mesh to remove debris and the cells were allowed to deposit at 4\u00b0C for 20 rain in Williams medium supplemented with 20 070 heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS). The supernatant was then discarded and the cell pellet resuspended in Williams medium supplemented with 20 % heat-inactivated FCS and centrifuged at 50 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C.\n\nHepatocytes were counted in a haematocytometer and a Trypan blue exclusion test determined their viability as being about 80 070. Cells were diluted in medium containing 10 070 heat-inactivated FCS and insulin (4 ~tg/ml). Cells (l x 10 6) were seeded on 35-ram Petri dishes (Primaria-Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, N J, USA) in a 1.5-ml volume and placed in a 5 070 CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. The medium was changed 3 h after seeding. When cells were maintained in culture, the medium was rene,ved every day.\n\nMHV3 was a clonal isolate produced on L2-cell cultures. Viral suspensions were titrated at 33\u00b0C on L2 cells cultured in 96-well microtitre plates (Lamontagne and Dupuy, 1984) . \n\nLivers were weighed, homogenized (B. Braun-Melsungen, Western Germany) and the number of viral particles /g liver was determined by plaque assays on L2 cell.~.\n\nAfter thawing, the hepatocyte cultures were s,.raped from the Petri dishes, centrifuged at low s~eed for 15 s and the viral titre in the supernatant raeasured by plaque assays on L2 cells.\n\n,w~,.. aec,~u,,~ ua .w, were cut in a cr~ostat aad fixed with acetone for 10 min at -20\u00b0C. Hepatocyte cultures were fixed in a methanol/acetone mixture (1/1) for 15 min at -20\u00b0C. After rehydration with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the samples were then covered with anti-MHV3 serum dilated 1/200 for 30 min at room temperature. After three 5-rain washes with PBS, samples were covered for 30 min with sheep anti-mouse-IgG fluoresceinisothiocyanate-conjugated serum (Institut Pasteur, Paris, Franc.c) diluted 1/100. They were again washed 3 times (5 min each) with PBS and examined under a \"Zeiss\" microscope (Axiophot).\n\nControls consisted of uninfected livers or cells, MHV3-infected hepatocytes or livers from infected animals labelled with normal serum.\n\nMeasurements of the number and areas of the necrotic foci observed in liver sections were performed according to photographs made with a \"Kontron semi-automatic MOP Videoplan\" analyser (Carl Zeiss, Asni6res, France).\n\nThe activity of serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase was determined using a kit based or~ a colorimetric method (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, Texas, USA).\n\nFor the determination of viral RNA synthesis, hepatocyie cultures were incubated with 2 itg/ml actinomycin D for l h, then labelled with 25 ttCi/ml 5-3H-uridine (specific activity 27 Ci/mmol, CEA, Saclay, France) for 2 h. The radioactive medium was removed and after 2 washings with PBS, cell monolayers were treated with 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the insoluble radioactivity measured.\n\nFor the determination of viral protein synthesis, cultures were deprived of methionine for 30 rain and pulse-labelled with 15 IzCi/ml 35S-methionine (specific activity > 800 Ci/mmol, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) diluted in methionine-free medium for 1 h. After washing twice with PBS, cultures were treated with l ml lysis buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), 500 units Aprotinin, 1% NP40, 0.2 mg/ml pi~enylmethylsulphonylfluoride) for 20 rain at 4\u00b0C (Wege et al., 1984) .\n\nCells were then scraped off and the suspension centrifuged to separate the nuclei from the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic fraction was subjected to a 100,000-g centrifugation for 90 rnin at 4\u00b0C. Viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C with MHV3-antibody diluted 1/100, followed by incubation at room temperature with gentle agitation in the presence of 50 gl of protein A/Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) for 20 min.\n\nThe immune complexes were sedimented by centrifugation and washed 5 times with 1 ml of A buffer. The pellet was solubilized in 30 ttl of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2 % SDS, 2 % ~-mercaptoethanol, 15 % glycerol and 0.004 % bromophenol blue and then heated at 100\u00b0C for 3 rain.\n\nAfter centrifugation, the supernatant was analysed on 12.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) . Electrophoresis was carried out for about 15 h at a constant current (10 mA). Gels were stained for 30 rain at 37\u00b0C with 0.25 % Coomassie blue dissolved in methanol/water/acetic acid (5/5/0.7 v/v/v) and then de-stained in acetic acid~methanol~water (3/2/35 v/v/v). Gels were then prepared for fluorography (Bonnet and Laskey, 1974)= dried and ex-posed to \"Kodak X AR-5\" film at -80\u00b0C for the appropriate exposure time. Molecular weights were determined by comparison with the migration of marker proteins 04C-methylated protein, MW 14,300-200,000, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England).\n\nPrimary hepatocyte cultures (24-h old) from NR and HC mice were infected at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cel! wRh MHV3 at 4\u00b0C to avoid the penetration stage. At different times after infection, the inoculum was removed, the cell monolayer was washed several times with PBS to eliminate all viral particles which were not adsorbed. Adsorption was analysed in the following 2 ways.\n\nCells were scraped into PBS and frozen at -80\u00b0C until titration. Once thawed, the cellular suspension was centrifuged and the adsorbed viral particles in the supernatant were titrated on L2 cells.\n\nMonolayers were covered for 3 h at 4\u00b0C with an anti-MHV3 serum produced in A/J strain mice (Martin et ai., 1988) diluted 1/200, then washed several times with PBS and covered for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.3 ~Ci/mi of an anti-mouse-Ig 35S-labelled antibod? (specific activity > 200 Ci/mmol, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England). After several washes with PBS, cells were scraped into PBS and the trichloroacetic-acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined. This provided a measure of the amount of viral particulate material adsorbed to the cell.\n\nData given in the figures represent the mean values of 3 derterminations in duplicate _+ SD. Comparisens between greulrs were carried out using the Mann and Whitney U test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThree different series of experiments involving 40 NR, 40 HC and 27 HCNR animals were performed to study the effect of cholesterol on MHV3-induced mortality in mice. Animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with 2 x 10 3 PFU of MHV3 and the mortality recorded.\n\nNR animals began to die 3 days p.i. with a percentage of mortality of 2.4 + 0.16 070 which increased to 9.7 + 0.3 \u00b070 (cumulative) by the fifth day, and remained stable till the end of the experiments.\n\nThe mortality of HC mice occurred earlier and the rate was higher. Some animals died as early as the second day p.i. (2.5 +0.16 070), and by the third day the percentage of mortality was 42.5 _+_ 0.49 07o. On the seventh day p.i., the percentage of mortality was 82.5 +0.38 070.\n\nWhen the HC diet was replaced by a control diet for 2 weeks, the mice regained resistance to MHV3-4 and 5 days p.i., the mortality rates were 7.4+0.26 \u00b070 and 18.7 +0.39 070, respectively, and remained stable.\n\nFrom those data, it was concluded that the administration of an HC diet increases the susceptibility of the mice to MHV3 and that this phenomenon is reversible.\n\nVirus titration was carried out on liver homogenateq from the 3 orann~ ai r mi,\" e [fla 1) In the livers of HC mice, MHV3 particles were found as early as the first day p.i. and the viral titre increased constantly until death of the animals. In the livers of NR and HCNR mice, viral particles were detected at only 2 and 3 days p.i., and after 3 days the virus titre decreased dramatically.\n\nImmunofluorescence studies and morphometric measurements performed on liver sections of NR and HC mice corroborate these data. At three days p.i., the sizes of necrotic foci and their distribution were not identical in NR and HC animals. In the livers of HC mice, their mean surface area was ten times higher (8.02 mm 2) than in NR animals (0.81 lnlTl2), The repartition of fluorescent foci was relatively homogenous in the livers of NR animals, with average sizes ranging from 0.33 to 0.92 mm 2, whereas in HC livers, there was great ,.iversity in the sizes of the necrotic loci, their surface areas varying from 0.79 to 20.5 mm 2.\n\nThe kinetics of the serum transaminase levels were determined together with the virus content of the livers in an experiment involving three mice daily. In the serum of NR animals, 2 days after the inoculation of MHV3, the transaminase level was 569 +_ 75 U/l and decreased with time along with the viral titre in the livers. In HC animals, the transaminase level was double (1,200 _+ 92 U/l) and constant at 2, 3 and 4 days p.i., as was the viral titre.\n\nPrimary hepatocyte cultures (24-h old) were established from NR, HC and HCNR mice and Each result represents the mean + SD of 3 separate experiments (using a total of 7 animals) for NR and HC groups, and I experiment with 2 animals for HCNR mice. Significant difference from NR mice, P < 0.05.\n\ninfected with MHV3 at a multiplicity of 0.05 PFU/celI. The replication kinetics of the virus in these cultures are shown in figure 2. In hepatocytes obtained from HC mice, infectious progeny virus was detected in supernatant fluids as early as 6 h after infection with peak level production at 24 h p.i. In NR hepatocytes, the viral growth curve was slower and delayed; it was only at !2 h p.i. that viral particles were detected, and at 24 h p.i., the viral titre was about one hlmdred times less than that produced in HC hepatocyte culture\u00b0 In hepatocyte cultures of HCNR mice, the multiplication of MHV3 was similar to that observed for NR hepatocyte cultures.\n\nThese data correlated with observations made for cultures treated for fluorescence studies: in the HC hepatocyte cultures, the fluorescent syncytia were very large and their number was 6-7 times higher than that in the NR hepatocyte cultures.\n\nViral RNA synthesis was shown to increase more rapidly in HC cells than in NR hepatocyte cultures for up to 4 h p.i., then remain constant for up to 12 h and decrease thereafter. Virusspecific proteins in MHV3-infected hepatocyte cultures from coptro! and HC m~ce were studied by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE ( fig. 3 ). In HC hepatocyte cultures, viral protein synthesis began earlier: 7-9 h after infection, proteins were already detectable and increased up to 25 h p.i. before decreasing, while in control cultures, they appeared later, at 20 h p.i.\n\nAnalysis by SDS-PAGE enabled the viral polypeptides to be specified. Moreover, the presence of two bands corresponding to the spike glycoprotein S, previously named E2 (180 kDa) and the nudeocapsid protein N (60 kDa) was observed in the two types of culture. However, in HC hepatocyte cultures, the intensity of the bands corresponding to the S and N proteins was stronger between 15 and 25 h p.i.\n\nThese data show higher rates of transcription and translation in cells from HC mice, which explaines the augmentation of viral polypeptides in these cells. In order to know why transcription was increased and if it correlated with the number of the viral infectious particles capable of penetrating the cells, we studied the first step of infection, adsorption, more closely.\n\nThis study was performeo using two methods, titration and radioimmunoassay (see Materials and Methods). Comparison of the adsorption ki- At various times p.i., samples were taken for titration. Each assay was carried out in duplicate in 3 separate experiments and each result represents the mean_+ SD.\n\nSignificant difference from NR hepatocyte cultures, P <0.05. netics measured by titration of the 2 groups of hepatocyte cultures shows that the rate of adsorption was already 5 times higher in HC hepatocytes, as early as 15 rain after infection ( fig. 4A ). These data were confirmed by the use of an anti-mouse-Ig 35S-labelled antibody. Indeed, with this method, which shows cellassociated labelling, we noticed a 2-fold greater labelling in HC hepatocyte cultures than in NR hepatocyte cultures ( fig. 4B ).\n\nNR and HC hepatocyte cultures (24-h old) were treated with 1,000 IU of standard preparation of ~-[3 mouse interferon (Lee Biomolecular, San Diego, California, USA) for 24 h, and then infected with 0.05 PFU/cell of MHV3. The yields of viral particles were titrated 24 h later. It was observed that exogenous interferon induced an antiviral state which was more pronounced in hepatocytes from NR mice than in those from HC animals: the inhibition of viral multiplication was 94.5+_4.8 \u00b070 and 67.7 +_ 5.1 \u00b070, respectively, indicating that HC hepatocytes showed decreased susceptibility to exogenous interferon.\n\nThe data presented in this work clearly indicate that A/J mice, which are naturally resistant to MHV3 infection, become susceptible to infection when fed an HC diet for 3 weeks. This pattern of p~thogcnesis was similar to that found in the genetically susceptible BALB/c strain; indeed, the HC animals developed acute hepatitis with a very high viral titre in the liver associated with many necrotic foci. Immunofluorescence enabled numerous syncytia to be observed whose areas were ten times larger and whose distribution was very much more h.:terogenous than for normal mice, as shown by analysis morphometry. Hepatocyte necrosis was also demonstrated by determining the transaminase activit~ which was found to be twice as high in the sera of HC animals. This increased susceptibility to viral infection induced by an HC diet was also observed in mice fed a diet rich in cholesterol and infected with coxsackievirus B5 (Loria et al., 1976; Campbell et al., 1982) .\n\nWhen the animals were refed a normal diet for a fortnight after the 3-week HC died, they regained resistance to MHV3 infection: 5 days after infection the mortality rate was 18.7 \u00b070 while in HC mice it was 70 070. These results show that the loss of resistance to MHV3 induced by a cholesterol-enriched diet is a reversib.~e phenomenon and would suggest that the decrease in resistance is consequently not due to genetic modification.\n\nThe animals' resistance to viral infection is determined either by their genome (Le Pr6vost et al., 1975a, b ; Virelizier, 1980) or by virus attenuation by mutation in the S gene (Martin et al., 1990) , but in both cases, the essential role of liver sinusoidal cells has been clearly demonstrated (Kirn et al., 1982; Steffan et al., 1986) .\n\nThese cells form a barrier which protects the liver parenchyma from MHV3 infection (Pereira et al., 1984b) and from other viruses, such as vaccinia virus (Steffan and Kirn, 1979) . In Kupffer cells from resistant animals cultured in vitro, virus multiplication is delayed compared with its multiplication in cells of susceptible animals (Pereira et al., 1984a) . On the other hand, the selective destruction of Kupffer and endothelial cells renders resistant mice susceptible to MHV3 (Pereira et aL, 1984b) . Moreover, Kupffer cells from HC mice lose their ability to be activated by LPS and to inhibit intrinsic MHV3 growth in vitro (Pereira et al., , 1987 . Under these conditions, it can be suggested that the loss of host resistance induced by an HC diet may be the result of an impair,~ent in the Kupffer cell function.\n\nIt was necessary to investigate whether this modification in pathogenesis corresponded to a change in the susceptibility of hepatic cel!s in vitro, and in particular, hepatocytes, towards MHV3 infection. With this in mind, it was essential to isolate hepatocytes from mice. Since MHV3 is a virus specific to the mouse, and Fig. 3 . Comparison of intracellular virus-specific proteins in MHV3-infected hepatocyte cultures isolated from NR and HC mice. Samples were prepared as described in \"Materials and Methods\" and the same amounts of NR and HC hepatocytes were loaded on 12.5 % polyacrylamide gel. Analyses of samples were made at 7 (1), 9 (2), 15 (3), 20 (4), 25 (5), 30 (6) and 48 h (7) p.i. Slot 8 represents the analysis of mockinfected hepatocytes.\n\nOn the left is the analysis of viral intracellular proteins in MHV3-infected L2 cells by immunoprecipitation in l0 o70 SDS-FAGE. RN = NR in text.\n\nwith very few authors having previously prepared mouse hepatocyte cultures (Renton et al., 1978; Arnheiter, 1980; Klaunig et al., 1981; Maslansky and Williams, 1982) , we had to adapt At different times p.i., at 4\u00b0C, samples were studied by titration (A) and radioimmunoassay (B) techniques. Each assay was carried out in duplicate in 2 separate experiments and each result represents the mean _+ SD. Significant difference from NR hepatocyte cultures, P < 0.05. the techniques which are normally described for rat hepatocyte isolation (Deschenes c; Guguen-Guillouzo and Guillouzo, 1986 ).\n\nHere, we followed the methods of Berry and Friend (1969) and Seglen (1976) but modified the use of perfusion buffer and the rate and time of collagenase perfusion. This enabled us to isolate and culture hepatocytes fronl normal and HC mice and to compare the replication of MHV3 in the two types of culture. On hepatocyte culture from HC mice, there was stimulation of viral multiplication and numerous large-sized syncytia formed, whilst viral RNA and polypeptides appeared earlier and in larger quantities than in control cultures.\n\nThese results, showing higher rates of transcription and translation in cells from HC mice, explained the increase in the amount of viral polypeptides in these cells and incited us to study the adsorption stage using two different methods, radioimmunoassay and titration, to determine the amount of physical and infectious particles, respectively. We obtained similar results with both assays: the virus adsorbed more rapidly and in greater amounts to the hepatocyte cultures from HC mice than those of the control cultures.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to understand why the adsorption difference between the two cultures was smaller using the radioimmunoassay technique, since the latter took into account the physical particles. It is possible that in the viral suspension there are aggregates of particles (as are commonly observed by scanning electron microscopy), and that only the outer virus of the aggregates can capture a molecule of antibody, while in the titration method a plaque is formed by each viral particle.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of these differences, it is important to note that with both methods the adsorption stage was more efficient in hepatocyte cultures from HC animals than in the control cultures. This may imply that the viral receptors were more available or their number per cell was greater in cultures from HC mice than in the control cultures.\n\nIn the case of hepatocyte cultures prepared from HC NR mice, the curve of viral growth could be superimposed on that observed with hepatocyte cultures from control mice. This observation confirms that the modification brought about by the diet was not genetic since the cells obtained from mice refed a normal diet after a 3-week HC diet responded in the same manner as hepatocytes of normal mice; this also corroborates in vivo observations, in which MHV3 replication was identical to that found in the livers of control mice.\n\nThe study of the effect of interferon preparation on MHV3 multiplication demonstrates that the hepatocytes from HC mice are less susceptible to interferon, probably on account of alterations in the membrane receptors for interferon; in Kupffer cells the same effect has been observed (Pereira et al., 1987) . Consequently, the resistance to viral infection may be modified by an alimentary diet and this modification may also be found in primary hepatocyte cultures.\n\nThe administration of an HC diet to mice led to an increase in the total lipid and cholesterol content of the liver (Campbell et al., 1982; Pereira et al., 1986) ; it may therefore be postulated that modifications in the lipid and cholesterol content of the hepatocyte membrane occurred. An increase in cholesterol, which alters the membrane cho!estero!-to-phospho!ipid molar ratio, interacts with the phospholipid membrane to form complexes and decreases the fluidity of the bilayers (Demel and de Kruyff, 1976; Shinitzky and Inbar, 1976) . This increase in membrane microviscosity changes the membrane properties and reorganizes the functional proteins, making them more readily available at the surface membrane (Borochov and Shinitzky, 1976; Borochov et aL, 1979) as membrane receptors, enzymes and transport proteins.\n\nUnder these conditions, it is possible that viral receptors become more accessible to the virus, in particular to viral constituents such as the S glycoprotein which play an essential role in cell fusion (Collins et aL, 1982; Sturman and Holmes, 1983 ). Since our data show disparities in the size and number of syncytia in MHV3-infected liver and hepatocyte cultures from NR as compared to HC mice, differences in the cellular processing of the S glycoprotein may be a possibility. Sturman et al. (1985) and Frana et al. (1985) have demonstrated that cleavage of 180-kDa S to 90-kDa species by host cell enzymes is required for stimulating the cellfusing activity of S glycoprotein, and thus determines the extent of MHV-A59-induced fusion of various cell lines. If this cleavage is more important or effective in HC cells than in control hepatocytes, the difference in the size of the syncytia observed can thereby be explained. The outcome of MHV3 infection may also be affected by the intracellular transportation of the S glycoprotein to the cell membrane which may be more rapid and effective in HC cells. The modification in membrane composition produced by the HC diet would thus render the cell membrane more sensitive to the fusing effects of S glycoprotein; a similar observation has been made by Daya et al. (1988) who noticed a dramatic increase in cell fusion after MHV infection (strain A59) of L2 and LM-K cells in which the membrane cholesterol content was increased.\n\nThese results show that fusion participates in MHV3 dissemination in vivo and in vitro: cellcell fusion between infected and uninfected cells favours the spread of infection. If the membrane composition is modified by cholesterol enrichment, the fusion mechanism would seem to be accentuated and the spread of infection enhanced, but this supposition needs to be confirmed by further investigation, such as cholesterol enrichment of hepatocyte cultures from control mice to see whether MHV3 growth and the formation of syncytia are actually increased.\n\nRelation entre une sensibilit6 accrue de la souris au virus de i'h6patite routine type 3 (MHV3) par administration d'un r~gime hypercholestErol~mique et une augmentation de ia permissivit6 an virus des h6patocytes en culture L'administration d'un r6gime hypercholest6rol6mique (HC) entraine une perte de r6sistance au virus de l'h6patite murine type 3 (MHV3) chez des souris g6n6tiquement r6sistantes ~ ce virus.
