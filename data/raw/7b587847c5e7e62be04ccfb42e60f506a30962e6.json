{"title": "Inhibition of DD-Peptidases by a Specific Trifluoroketone: Crystal Structure of a Complex with the Actinomadura R39 DD- Peptidase \u2020 NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "The rapid evolution of \u03b2-lactamases in response to new \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and also to \u03b2lactam-based \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (6) (7) (8) , emphasizes the need for and stimulates the search for DD-peptidase inhibitors that are not \u03b2-lactam-based (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . One obvious approach is through transition-state analogues, since such molecules should, in principle, inhibit any enzyme (16) (17) (18) . Since the reactions catalyzed by DD-peptidases in vivo are acyl-transfer reactions with a covalent acyl(serine)-enzyme intermediate (Scheme 1), substrate-based tetrahedral anions, covalently bound to the active site serine should be good analogues of the transition states of both acylation and deacylation steps. In principle, therefore the molecule 1, where \"peptidoglycan\" is a specific peptidoglycan, or peptidoglycan-mimetic fragment and X is a reactive moiety that generates a tetrahedral anion on reaction with the active site serine, would be the inhibitor of choice.\n\nApproaches to 1 require the optimization of both \"peptidoglycan\" and X. One might expect that the former goal would be informed by studies of the substrate specificity of these enzymes, where a minimal, consensual, and thus broad spectrum peptidoglycan fragment would emerge. This goal has, however, not yet been achieved. It is true, of course, that peptidoglycan structure varies in detail between bacterial species, but even given this point, no consensual structure/class of privileged structures has emerged from consideration of DD-peptidase substrate specificity (19, 20) . DD-Peptidases have been classified structurally into two groups, the low molecular mass (LMM) 1 and high molecular mass (HMM) enzymes (21) . The latter group is essential for bacterial growth and contains the killing targets of \u03b2-lactams. The former group are also inhibited by \u03b2-lactams but are not essential for bacterial survival, in the short term at least. Both groups of enzymes are believed to catalyze acyl-transfer reactions of peptidoglycan, viz. transpeptidase (HMM), carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase (LMM) reactions. Certain members of the LMM group, subclasses B and C, have been shown to have strong specificity for a free amine N-terminus in peptidoglycan substrates (19, (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) , but no strong specificity for any particular element of peptidoglycan has been demonstrated for the HMM enzymes (13, 19, 24, 28, 29) . Design of transition state analogue inhibitors for the latter enzymes is thus difficult.\n\nWith respect to element X of 1, some advances have been made. In particular, boronic acids (Scheme 2) have been shown to be effective. Peptidoglycan-mimetic boronates have been found to be potent inhibitors of LMMC enzymes (13, 20) . The crystal structure of a complex of one such inhibitor, 2, with the LMMC Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase demonstrated the reason for its specificity (13) . \u03b2-Lactam-mimetic boronic acids (bearing the amido side chains of classical \u03b2-lactam antibiotics rather than peptidoglycan) have also recently been found to be quite effective although studies of them are yet limited (11, 12, 31) .\n\nBeyond boronates, other sources of X, employed with a variety of serine hydrolases have been alcohols, phosphonates, aldehydes and trifluoroketones, yielding, in principle, the tetrahedral anions 3-6, respectively (32) . Some assessment of the potential of these warheads with DD-peptidases has been made previously (14, 33) , although no indications of great potency have yet been observed. To date, the combination of the motifs 3-6, with a specific peptidoglycan fragment (as in 1) has not been investigated. In this paper, we present the synthesis and assessment of the inhibitory activity of 7-12 against representative LMMC DD-peptidases. We have discovered that the trifluoroketone 12 is a quite effective inhibitor of the Actinomadura R39 enzyme and present a crystal structure of its complex with this enzyme.\n\nCommercially available reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Acros Organics, and used without purification, unless otherwise noted. D-Glutamic acid and N-(Z)-D-alanine were purchased from ChemImpex. Trifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate was purchased as a 75% solution in water from AlfaAesar. Compounds 24 (AlfaAesar), 25 and 27 were commercial products. The trifluoroketone 26 was synthesized in this laboratory by Dr. Abbas Shilabin. (Phenylacetyl)glycyl-D-thiolactate (14) and the boronic acid 2 were synthesized as previously described (30) . The Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase and B. subtilis PBP4a were expressed and purified as described (34, 35) .\n\nVarian Mercury 300 MHz and 400 MHz NMR spectrometers were used to collect 1 H, 31 P and 19 F NMR spectra. Absorption spectra and spectrophotometric reaction rates were measured with Hewlett-Packard 8452A and 8453 spectrophotometers. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained from the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, School of Chemical Sciences, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL. Routine ESI mass spectra were collected from a Thermo LCQ Advantage instrument. HPLC purification was achieved by a Varian ProStar unit equipped with a Varian ProStar model 340 UV/Vis detector and a Nucleosil\u00ae C-18 reverse phase column (Macherey-Nagel). Flash column chromatography was performed on Silicycle 60 \u00c5, 32-63 \u03bcm silica gel. \n\nTo a stirred solution of 15 (3 g, 6 mmol, 1 equiv) in 30 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether under a nitrogen atmosphere was added DIBAL (1 M in hexane, 6.5 mL, 1.1 equiv) slowly at \u221278 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min, and then water (0.3 mL) added. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 30 min after which it was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the volatiles evaporated, leaving a colorless gum, 16 (2.2 g), which was employed in the next step without purification. 1 \n\nTo a stirred solution of 16 (2.0 g, 5 mmol, 1 equiv) in dry THF (20 mL) was added (t-butoxycarbonylmethylene)triphenylphosphorane 17 (Aldrich) (2.6 g, 6.8 mmol, 1.2 equiv) at room temperature. The reaction was stirred for 1.5 h after which solvent was removed by evaporation. The crude product was purified by chromatography on silica gel (hexane:ethyl acetate, 3:1), yielding the product 18 as a colorless oil (1.5 g, 60% yield). 1 The ester 18 (0.5 g, 1 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL). To this solution, stirred in an ice bath, trifluoroacetic acid (6 mL) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature after which solvent was evaporated. After the residue was dried under vacuum, the product 19, was obtained as a gum (0.4 g, 90% yield). 1 \n\nTo a mixture of D-1-[6-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-6-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-trans-hex-2-enoic acid 19 (488 mg, 1.1 mmol, 1 eq.) and 3amino-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-butanol hydrochloride 21, dissolved in 10 ml of DMF, triethylamine (767 \u03bcL, 2.75 mmol, 2.5 eq.) was added followed by HBTU (1046 mg, 2.75 mmol, 2.5 eq.) at 0 -5 \u00b0C. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate. The organic solution was washed with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane) to give the product 22 in 80% yield as a colorless oil. 1 \n\nTo a stirred solution of 22 (380 mg, 0.67 mmol, 1 eq.) in dichloromethane (25 mL) at room temperature, Dess-Martin periodinane (850 mg, 2 mmol, 3 eq.) was added, followed by trifluoroacetic acid (150 \u03bcL, 2 mmol, 3 eq.) at room temperature. The reaction mixturewas stirred for three hours, after which it was quenched with sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. After the drying and evaporation of the solvent, the crude product was purified on a silica gel column (ethyl acetate/hexane,1/1), and the product 23 was isolated in 90% yield as a colorless oil. 1 \n\nThe required final product was prepared from 23 by catalytic hydrogenation overnight at 40 psi in 10 ml of MeOH with 10% Pd on carbon. After reaction, the solution was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to give a colorless solid. The crude product was dissolved in water and washed with ethyl acetate three times. The aqueous solution was separated and freeze-dried to give a colorless solid. This was purified by two passages through a Sephadex G10 size-exclusion chromatography column (water eluent). The product 12 was isolated in 35% yield as a colorless solid. 1 (25). Measurements of initial velocity vs concentrations of 7-11 were fitted to Scheme 5 and eq. 1 to obtain the K i value. Total progress curves of inhibition of R39 DDpeptidase by compound 12 were fitted to Scheme 8 (see below) by the Dynafit program (39) to obtain the K i value directly. Data for the R39-12 crystals were measured on Beamline PROXIMA at SOLEIL (Paris, France) and processed using XDS. Molecular replacement processed with the native structure produced an interpretable density map, which clearly shows 12 in the four monomers of the asymmetric unit. Refinement was carried out with Refmac (40), Coot (41) and TLS (42) with final R and Rfree values of 19.3% and 23.7% Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nSynthesis of the new compounds 7-12 was achieved in a straight-forward fashion [Schemes 3,4, S1-S5 (Supporting Information)] via the versatile intermediate 19. They were all characterized by NMR and MS methods. All, along with the carboxylate 13 and the simple functional group analogues 24-27 were treated as rapid equilibrium competitive inhibitors of two LMMC DD-peptidases, the Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase and Bacillus subtilis PBP4a. No indications of slow binding were observed in any case. Values of the inhibition constant, K i , obtained for 7 -13, along with those for the boronate 2, previously determined (30) , are as reported in Table 1 .\n\nThe alcohols 7 and 8 had very little inhibitory activity against either enzyme. Even the trifluoromethyl substituent of 8, which should reduce the alcohol pK a into a range where its anion would be accessible to the active site oxyanion hole, only produced a weak inhibitor of PBP4a. The configuration 3 of alcohols at the active site is therefore unfavorable. It should be noted in passing that the alcohol 8 was obtained as a mixture of four diastereoisomers in roughly equal amounts (see 19 F NMR data in Supporting Information), only one of which would be expected to be an inhibitor (2R3S). Serine hydrolases, in general, are not efficiently inhibited by alcohols, even when specific (e.g. 43,44). The phosphonates 9 and 10 were also ineffective against the DD-peptidases. Presumably, the configuration 28 is not favorable either. A series of arylamidophosphonic acids was also found to lack significant inhibitory activity against the R39 DD-peptidase (12) . Specific aryl phosphonate esters are known to be time-dependent covalent inhibitors of \u03b2-lactamases (45) and (weakly) of a LMMB DD-peptidase (46) . No time-dependent inhibition of the present LMMC DD-peptidases by 9, however, was observed.\n\nThe carboxylate 13 is also a weak inhibitor of the R39 enzyme ( Table 1 ). The trigonal carboxylate apparently does not sit well in the oxyanion hole. This is, in fact, seen in the crystal structure of a complex of the carba analogue of 13 with the R39 DD-peptidase (26) , where the carboxylate is oriented away from the oxyanion hole. It is certainly reasonable that 13, the product of a DD-carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase reaction would be a poor inhibitor.\n\nBoth of the specific carbonyl compounds 11 and 12 are inhibitors of both LMMC enzymes. The trifluoroketone 12 is particularly effective [it is assumed that only one of the two diasteromers of 12, present in approximately equal amounts, has significant activity; this isomer, seen in the crystal structure described below, has D-stereochemistry at the ketone terminus]. It is likely (also see below) that these carbonyl compounds form the tetrahedral adducts, 4 and 5, respectively, at the active site. The greater effectiveness of the trifluoroketone is likely to be due in part to the higher alcohol acidity of the adduct (47), allowing thermodynamically more favorable formation of 6 than 5 at pH 7.5 [pK a values of trifluoroethanol and ethanol are 12.4 and 16 (48) , respectively, favoring anion formation by the former by a factor of 10 3.6 ]. This factor is essentially sufficient to rationalize the higher inhibitory potency of 12 than 11.\n\nIf it is assumed that the reacting species of 11 and 12 are the free carbonyls (47), then the observed or apparent K i values of Table 1 should be corrected for the competing hydration in aqueous solution (Scheme 7) via eq 2, where K i obs is the observed value. From 1 H NMR spectra (not shown), K H for 11 is 30 and, therefore, from eq 2, the \"real\" K i values for the carbonyl form of 11 are 2.5 \u03bcM and 16.1 \u03bcM, respectively, for the R39 DD-peptidase and PBP4a. The effect of hydration is even more dramatic with 12. Although estimates of K H for trifluoroacetone in the literature are curiously wide-ranging (47, 49, 50) , the lower limit estimate is 35 (49) . If the additional effect of the amido substituent is included as a factor of 30 [estimated from the K H values of acetaldehyde (49) and 11], then a lower limit estimate of K H for 12 would be 1000. Certainly, we are unaware of any report in the literature of NMR observation of the carbonyl form of a \u03b1-trifluoro-\u03b1\u2032-amidoketone in aqueous solution (e.g. 51,52). Thus K i values for 12, corrected for hydration, can be estimated as 0.37 nM and 13.5 nM for the R39 DD-peptidase and PBP4a, respectively. These estimates represent upper limits and may be an order of magnitude larger than the real values. These carbonyl compounds are certainly powerful inhibitors of the LMMC DD-peptidases and, on reaction with the enzymes, may well generate structures resembling tetrahedral high-energy intermediates/transition states (see below). (2) The lack of specificity of the trifluoromethyl moiety itself and the importance of the specific N-terminus is confirmed by the data of Table 2 where the effectiveness of the generic inhibitors 24 25, 26 and 27, bearing the \"warheads\" of 2, 7, 11, and 12, respectively, is displayed. Only 26 shows weak inhibition of the R39 DD-peptidase as do 24 and 26 of PBP4a.\n\nIt was striking that the weaker \"inhibitors\", of the R39 DD-peptidase, 7, 8, and 9, actually produced an increase in the initial rate of substrate turnover, as shown for 7 in Figure 1 , for example. The likely explanation for this, with established precedent (25) , is that, because of their free D-amino acid termini, these compounds may also act as acyl-acceptors and, in cases where enzyme deacylation is rate determining, as is presumably true for the thiolester 14, accelerates the observed reaction. Data such as in Figure 1 was fitted to Scheme 6 to obtain values for k 4 (Table 1) . Obviously, the k 4 values for 7 and 8 are much higher than for the anionic 9 and 10 and are comparable to that (1.4 \u00d7 10 4 s \u22121 M \u22121 ) of the best acceptor yet discovered for this enzyme, the good substrate 29 (25) . It is, however, striking that the anionic terminal carboxylate 13 is so much a better acceptor than the equally anionic phosphonates 9 and 10. The ability of enzymes to bind carboxylates and phosph(on)ates differently has been noticed previously (53) , although the functional significance of the distinction here is not evident.\n\nThe acyl-acceptor ability of these inhibitors probably also led to the initially unexpected observation of an apparent decrease in the effectiveness of 12 as an inhibitor of the R39 DDpeptidase as a function of time in experiments with the substrate 14 ( Figure 2 ). This phenomenon can be interpreted in terms of Scheme 8, which was fitted to data such as shown in Figure 2 (fit shown). The product of reaction of 12 with the substrate 14, Q, which presumably is 30, must be a weak inhibitor of the R39 enzyme. Acylation of 12 by 14 would lead to a gradual depletion of the inhibitor in solution and thus to decreasing inhibition with time ( Figure 2 ). The K i value for 12 reported in Table 1 derives from the fits of these data. This phenomenon was not observed in the experiments with 12 and PBP4a or with 11 and both enzymes probably because of the higher concentrations of inhibitors required for the experiments, leading to smaller fractional depletions of the inhibitors in these cases.\n\nBecause of the complication created by the ability of 7 and 8 to act as strong acyl group acceptors, their activity as inhibitors, although weaker than that of 2 and 12, could not be readily determined from experiments where turnover of substrate was monitored. Therefore, the binding strengths of 7 and 8 were determined from the inhibition of their irreversible inactivation of the R39 enzyme with cefotaxime, monitored fluorimetrically (54) . These measurements showed that 7 and 8 did in fact bind very weakly [(at millimolar concentrations (Table 1) ]. The fluorescence inhibition method was checked with 2 and 12, with acceptable results (Table 1) .\n\nIt is also striking that 11 and 12 are more effective inhibitors of the R39 enzyme than of PBP4a. This may relate to the same order of reactivity of specific substrates with these enzymes (20) . On the other hand, the analogous boronate 2 is a stronger inhibitor of PBP4a than of the R39 enzyme. The latter difference, however, may relate to the interesting observation that the binding of 2 to PBP4a is a slow (minutes; two step?) process (20) , whereas its binding to the R39 enzyme is fast (with respect to manual mixing times). No time dependence in the inhibition of either of these enzymes by 11 and 12 was observed.\n\nAn X-ray diffraction study of the title complex was performed. Initial electron density maps resulting from the molecular replacement were excellent for the four protein monomers present in the asymmetric unit, allowing a precise localization of 12 in the active site of each monomer (Figure 3 ). The inhibitor 12 is covalently bonded to the active serine Ser49, the carbonyl carbon is now tetrahedral, and the ketone oxygen occupies the oxyanion hole, defined by the backbone NH groups of Ser49 and Thr413. The D-methyl group is directed into a hydrophobic pocket comprised residues Gly148, Leu 349 and Met414. As previously observed in the structures of the R39 enzyme with the boronic acid 2 (30), a cephalosporin or a peptide (26) , each bearing an aminopimelic side chain, the aminopimelyl side chain runs along a hydrophobic groove and is fixed by a series of hydrogen bonds between the amido group and Asn300N\u03b42 and Thr413O atoms, and between the terminal D-\u03b1-amino acid moiety and the Arg351 guanidinium, the Asp142 carboxylate and the Ser415 hydroxyl.\n\nThe most novel element of the structure is the position of the trifluoromethyl group and its interaction with the enzyme active site. Branching from the tetrahedral carbon bonded to Ser49O\u03b3, the CF 3 group occupies the likely position of a leaving group in the tetrahedral intermediate of a peptidase substrate [and thus of one of the boronate hydroxyl groups in the analogous complex with 2 (30) ]. An overlap of the active site elements of the boronate 2 complex and that of the trifluoroketone 12, both bearing a free D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl Nterminus, for which this enzyme is specific (20, 24) , is shown in Figure 4 . The inhibitors are essentially identically placed in the active site, as would be expected of transition state analogs with such similar structure, with the CF 3 group of 12 overlapping directly with the \"leaving group\" boronate hydroxyl. With respect to the position of the CF 3 group, one O-C-C-F dihedral angle is 57\u00b0, indicating an essentially precise staggering of the fluorine atoms with respect to the oxyanion O \u2212 . This conformation would be expected, of course, on steric and electrostatic grounds and has been observed in serine protease/trifluoroketone complexes (for example, in reference 55). One fluorine atom is directed out of the active site into solvent where it might well interact with water molecules in the manner observed in a variety of crystal structures (55) (56) (57) (58) . Such interactions are probably more dipolar in nature than involving classical hydrogen bonding and are probably of ca 1 kcal/mol strength (59, 60) . The other two fluorine atoms appear to interact in a bifurcated fashion at a distance of 3.0 \u00c5 each with the hydroxyl of Ser298. This kind of arrangement has been previously observed, for example in a trifluoroketone adduct with chymotrypsin (55), where two fluorines interact with a water molecule, and in a thrombin complex where a similar interaction with a water molecule has been observed (57) . It is interesting that the Lys52 terminal nitrogen has not moved closer than 4.0 \u00c5 distance to a fluorine atom. There are many examples of close NH---F interactions of < 3.0 \u00c5 in complexes of enzymes with fluorinated inhibitors (55) (56) (57) (58) 61) . In the present case, the Lys52 amine would certainly be protonated, in a negatively charged transition state analog structure as it is and where it is strongly interacting with Ser49O\u03b3 (2.9 \u00c5) and Asn300O \u03b4 (2.8 \u00c5).\n\nA combination of the inhibition kinetics and the crystal structure, both discussed above, suggest that the trifluoromethyl moiety alone does not interact specifically and tightly with the DD-peptidase active site, but acts only as part of an electrophilic ketone that does react with the active site serine in a cooperative fashion with the specifically binding D-\u03b1aminopimelyl N-terminus (26, 27, 30, 62) .\n\nCompound 12 represents the first micromolar trifluoroketone inhibitor of a DD-peptidase. It owes its potency to the trifluoroketone moiety, elevating it over the less electrophilic aldehyde 11 and other tetrahedral species derived from 7-10, which occupy the active site less favorably. As shown by the very limited effectiveness of the generic analogues 24-27, it is clear that 12 is able to achieve its effectiveness only in combination with the strong specificity produced by the D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl terminus, whose affinity for certain LMMC DD-peptidases has been established. This combination of the trifluoroketone, which forms a tetrahedral adduct with the active site serine, and the D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl terminus into a complete inhibitor of the R39 DD-peptidase is seen very clearly in the crystal structure of the complex between the enzyme and 12. The trifluoroketone moiety and other activated carbonyls, therefore, should be considered along with boronic acids and phosphonates, as warheads that can be incorporated into new and effective DD-peptidase inhibitors and therefore, perhaps, antibiotics.
