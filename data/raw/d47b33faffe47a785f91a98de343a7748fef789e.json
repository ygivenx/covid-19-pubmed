{"title": "Inhibition of alphavirus infection in cell culture and in mice with antisense morpholino oligomers", "body": "The genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae consists of 28 viruses, most of which cycle between mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts. Several alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), O'nyong-nyong virus and Chikungunya virus, can cause severe disease in humans, that typically includes fever and neurological sequelae (Griffin, 2007) . Of these, VEEV is the most important human pathogen, with several recent outbreaks consisting of hundreds of thousands of cases occurring mostly in Latin America (Weaver et al., 2004) . Furthermore, EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are considered bioterrorist threats because they cause severe disease in humans, can be produced in large quantity and/or are potentially transmitted by aerosol (Hawley and Eitzen, 2001; Sidwell and Smee, 2003) . Veterinary vaccines of varying quality against EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are commercially available, but only IND preparations are approved for human use and their availability is limited to military and laboratory personnel. No therapeutic for alphavirus-induced disease exists, although supportive treatment and anti-inflammatory drugs may be beneficial. Recently short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to be effective against the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus (Caplen et al., 2002) and VEEV (O'Brien, 2006) , in cell cultures, and against O'nyong-nyong virus replication in its natural mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae (Keene et al., 2004) .\n\nAlphaviruses have a single positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 kb that codes for two polyproteins that are processed to four nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins, respectively. The open reading frames are flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of approximately (\u223c) 60 and \u223c300 nucleotides, respectively. The nonstructural proteins are translated from the full-length genomic RNA and are utilized to produce a fulllength negative-strand antigenomic RNA. The negative-strand intermediate is used as template to produce both full-length positivestrand, and, using a 24 nucleotide internal promoter, a \u223c 4 kb subgenomic RNA is produced, which is identical in sequence to the 3\u2032 terminal third of the genomic RNA. The structural proteins are translated from the subgenomic RNA. Both genomic and subgenomic RNA are 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated. Sindbis virus (SINV) has been extensively used as a model alphavirus because of its low Virology 376 (2008) [357] [358] [359] [360] [361] [362] [363] [364] [365] [366] [367] [368] [369] [370] pathogenicity to humans, easy propagation in a variety of cell lines, and molecular biology that is considered representative of the genus .\n\nAntisense oligomers of various structural types have been used to interfere with gene expression of several human viral pathogens (Schubert and Kurreck, 2006) , and a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide designed to target mRNA of cytomegalovirus (CMV) that is intended to treat CMV-induced retinitis is an approved drug (De Clercq, 2004) . However, antisense therapeutic technology continues to be hampered by limitations in both oligomer stability and delivery to RNA targets within relevant cells (Kurreck, 2003) . Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are a class of oligonucleotide-like antisense agents that possess the same four bases as DNA, but contain a different backbone. The deoxyribose ring and phosphodiester linkage of DNA are replaced by a morpholine ring and phosphorodiamidate linkage in PMO . PMO are nonionic, are stable in cellular extracts and human serum (Nelson et al., 2005; Youngblood et al., 2007) and typically are synthesized to a length of 20-25 subunits. The PMO mechanism of antisense action is via steric-blocking of complementary RNA sequence (Stein et al., 1997) , and thus differs from that of antisense agents based on DNA chemistry, which induce RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA strand of a RNA-DNA duplex, or RNAi/ siRNA involving double-stranded agents that recognize target mRNA and induce its degradation by cellular proteins (Masiero et al., 2007) . PMO covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) can be delivered efficiently into cells (Deas et al., 2005; Moulton et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006) . CPP-PMO are water-soluble and have been shown to generate potent inhibition of several RNA viruses, including dengue virus (Holden et al., 2006; Kinney et al., 2005) , West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2005) , SARS Coronavirus (Neuman et al., 2005) , Equine Arterivirus (van den Born et al., 2005) and influenza virus (Ge et al., 2006) in cell culture, and Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006) , Ebola virus (Enterlein et al., 2006) , murine Coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007) and West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2007) both in cell culture and in mouse models. Two different CPP-conjugated PMO (PPMO), one containing oligoarginine (P3) and one containing 6-aminohexanoic acid (P7), have been utilized (Moulton et al., 2004; Abes et al., 2006) . A recent report documented that P7-conjugated PPMO are highly stable in human serum for at least 2 hours (h), and moderately stable for 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007) .\n\nIn the present study, we first evaluated six SINV-specific PPMO designed to base pair with sequences in the four terminal regions of the full-length genome or antigenome, the AUG translation start site region of the polyprotein coding sequence for the nonstructural proteins, and the subgenomic promoter region of the negative-strand antigenome. We found that two PPMO, one targeting the 5\u2032-terminal sequence and the other targeting the first functional AUG translation start site regions of the genome, were effective in blocking viral production. Subsequently, PPMO were designed to target the two corresponding regions in VEEV. As for the SINV PPMO, VEEV-specific PPMO were found to inhibit the replication of several VEEV strains in cell cultures and were efficacious in a murine model of VEE.\n\nConsiderations in PPMO sequence design for this study included our current understanding of the function of various alphavirus genetic regions, and PPMO mechanism of action. As with other positive-strand viruses that utilize cap-dependent translation, access of trans-acting proteins to the 5\u2032 terminal region of the genome is critical to alphavirus capping reactions and the process of translation pre-initiation (Vasiljeva et al., 2000) . It has also been shown by mutational studies that certain sequence and secondary structure requirements in the 5\u2032 terminal region of the alphavirus genome must be present for efficient viral replication to occur (Frolov et al., 2001; Gorchakov et al., 2004; Niesters and Strauss, 1990; Tsiang et al., 1988) . The 3\u2032 terminal region of the antigenome has likewise been shown to play an integral role in positive-strand synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001) , perhaps through the presence of a stem-loop structure corresponding to the inverse of that present in the 5\u2032 end of the genome. Specific sequence requirements in the 19 nucleotide 3\u2032 conserved sequence element (3\u2032CSE) immediately preceding the polyA tail are necessary for efficient minus-strand synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001) . Another study reported high antiviral activity from PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminal region of the Equine Arterivirus genome, and moderate activity with PPMO targeting either the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome or 3\u2032 terminus of the antigenome (van den Born et al., 2005) , although the 5\u2032 end of the antigenome was not included as a target. Other groups have also reported high efficacy by PPMO targeting the genomic 5\u2032 terminal region of other positivestrand viruses, including dengue (Kinney et al., 2005) , West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2005) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Zhang et al., 2006) and murine Coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007) . The above reports documenting the importance of sequence and structures in terminal regions of the alphavirus genome, along with the Table 1. success of termini-targeted PPMO, led us to design PPMO against each of the four termini of SINV genomic RNA (Fig. 1 ). Alphavirus subgenomic (sg) RNA encoding the structural proteins is synthesized by internal initiation on the genome-length negative-strand RNA. The minimal sequence essential for promoter activity extends from nucleotide \u221219 to +5 (in relation to the start codon of the sg positive-strand) and corresponds to the genomic positive-strand sequence from nucleotides 7579 to 7602 in SINV (Levis et al., 1990) . We therefore targeted this corepromoter region in the antigenome, in an effort to interfere with the synthesis of plus-strand sg RNA. The genomic 5\u2032-most AUG codon is required for translation initiation of the nonstructural proteins of alphaviruses (Lemm et al.,1994) . The region flanking the translation start site has been a favored target site for PMO mediated silencing of viral (Enterlein et al., 2006; Neuman et al., 2005; van den Born et al., 2005) and cellular (Heasman, 2002; Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000) mRNAs, and was an obvious PPMO target selection. Three of the six sites we initially chose to target with PPMO are regions of highly conserved sequence either between alphavirus species, or between strains within a species: (i) the CSE at the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome (ii) the sg core-promoter region and (iii) the 5\u2032 terminal region (Lemm et al., 1994) . Table 1 ), or as a negative control, the P3-conjugated Scr PPMO (a random nucleotide sequence), for 24 h. Reduction of cell viability, measured by MTT assay (described in Materials and methods), is expressed relative to mock-treated cells. B) VEEV PPMO. Vero cells were incubated with the P7-or P7-AMCA-conjugated VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO (see Table 1 ), or as a negative control, the P7-or P7-AMCA-conjugated Scr PPMO (a random nucleotide sequence) with a range of PPMO concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 \u03bcm) and for different time points (0, 4, 10, 20, 24, 36, 48 h) . The average of quadruplicate treatments, measured by CellTiter-Blue\u00ae assay (described in Materials and methods), is shown. Two-way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) with Bonferroni post-test for pairwise comparison of PPMO-treated vs. untreated (\"No PPMO\") controls by respective time point and concentration was performed.\n\nThe impact of P3-PPMO on cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay on BHK cells following 24 h incubation with the P3-conjugated PPMO -SINV 5\u2032+, SINV AUG, SINV sgP, and Scrin the range of 0.1-20 \u03bcM ( Fig. 2A) . Cell viability readings for all PPMO at all concentrations tested, relative to vehicle-treated cells, were \u223c 80% or greater. Similar cytotoxicity evaluation was carried out for the P7-and the P7-AMCAconjugated PPMO (VEEV 5\u2032+ and Scr) (Fig. 2B ). Viability assay was performed in quadruplicate at multiple time points (0, 4, 10, 20, 24, 36 and 48 h) and concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 \u03bcM) using a fluorescence-based assay. For the majority of time points, there were minimal differences (\u00b1 2%) in cell viability in comparison to the untreated (no PPMO) control at the matching time point; for either the P7-or P7-AMCA-conjugated VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO at a given treatment/time point, this reduction in viability did not exceed 10%. For the majority of the PPMO incubations, no statistically significant decrease in viability was detected in two way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) with Bonferroni pairwise comparison to the untreated control (\"No PPMO\") at the matching concentration and time point, with the exception of the VEEV 5\u2032+ (P7), and the Scr (P7-AMCA) at the 1 \u03bcM concentration/24h time point (9% reduction in viability for both).\n\nTo assess if these PPMO could successfully inhibit alphavirus replication, as well as to confirm the utility of the recombinant fulllength Sindbis virus which expresses the luciferase (luc) reporter protein (SinLuc) as a tool for monitoring anti-SINV compounds, we evaluated SINV-targeting PPMO (Table 1) in this system. SinLuc virus was harvested following electroporation of BHK cells with in vitro transcribed SinLuc RNA. Prior to infection with SinLuc virus BHK cells were treated with SINV P3-PPMO in the concentration range that was demonstrated to be non-cytotoxic in the cell viability experiment (shown in Fig. 2A ). For quantitative comparison, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the luc levels for all groups (PPMO or untreated control at all concentrations via two way ANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.05) as well as pairwise comparison of luc levels for SINV PPMO treatments or untreated (\"No PPMO\") at each concentration to the corresponding Scr treatment (Bonferroni's post-test, \u03b1 = 0.05). Dose-responsive inhibition of SINV replication, as represented by luc readings, was observed for both the SINV 5\u2032+ PPMO (Fig. 3A , right panel) and SINV AUG PPMO (3A, left panel). For the SINV AUG PPMO, at 5, 7.5 and 10 \u03bcM this reduction was in the range of 70-90% relative to Scr and was statistically significant (p-values b 0.01). For the SINV 5\u2032+, a reduction of 85-100% with the dose tested in the range of 0.5-10 \u03bcM was significant (pvalues b 0.001). In contrast, the level of inhibition produced by the SINV 5\u2032-, 3\u2032+ and 3\u2032-PPMO was similar at all concentrations, and these levels were significantly different from Scr PPMO (p-values b 0.01); however, this reduction (%) did not appear to be dose dependent. For the SgP, no significant differences were detected at the majority of the concentrations tested, with the exception of 0.1 and 7.5 \u03bcM. However, at 0.1 \u03bcM, for all groups (PPMO or untreated controls), the luc values were generally higher relative to Scr, but were not statistically different from Scr (p-values N 0.05). Thus, significant dose-responsive inhibition was observed for the SINV 5\u2032+ and SINV AUG PPMO.\n\nTo assess the ability of PPMO to inhibit production of infectious alphavirus in cell culture, BHK cell infection with wild type SINV (Fig. 3B , panels i) was performed under conditions similar to those used for the SinLuc virus experiments (shown in Fig. 3A ). SINV-infected BHK cells were incubated with SINV 5\u2032+, SINV AUG, SINV sgP, or SINV 3\u2032+ PPMO and virus production level was determined by plaque assay of supernatants obtained at 24 hpi ( Fig. 3A) . A statistically significant reduction in titer resulted from SINV 5\u2032+ and SINV AUG PPMO treatment (Dunnett's test of PPMO vs. mock treatment, p b 0.01 for each); at 1 \u03bcM, a reduction of 86% and 88% was measured for SINV 5\u2032+ and SINV AUG, respectively; at 5 \u03bcM, the level of inhibition was higher (p b 0.01): 99% and 89%, respectively. In contrast, SINV sgP and SINV 3\u2032+ PPMO did not affect the SINV levels significantly (p N 0.05).\n\nTo further assess the virus specific effects of the two SINV-specific PPPMO that inhibited viral production in these prior experiments, Vero cells were infected at an moi of 0.1 with the control viruses, VSV and VEEV (TC-83), and then incubated with the SINV AUG and SINV 5\u2032+ PPMO at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM, or as a control, Vero cell were infected, but left untreated (\"no PPMO\", Fig. 3B , panel ii). For VSV, titers were most variable at the earlier time point of 8 h, with a maximum difference in titer from the untreated control of 1.4 log 10 PFU/ml (SINV AUG); at the later time point of 24 h, VSV titers were similar for all the PPMO, with a maximum difference of 0.71 log 10 PFU/ml. For TC83, titers were more consistent at 8 h, with maximum difference of \u223c1 log 10 PFU/ ml; at 24 h, the maximum difference was \u223c2 log 10 PFU/ml. No obvious trend in non-specific inhibition by any of these PPMO was evident.\n\nThe effect of PPMO on viral translation was assessed following SINV 5\u2032+, SINV AUG, SINV sgP or SINV 3\u2032+ PPMO treatment of SINVinfected cell cultures. Quantification of the level of viral capsid (C) and envelope (E1) proteins in 35 S-labeled BHK cell lysates obtained at 24 hpi and resolved by SDS-PAGE indicates that the SINV 5\u2032+ and the SINV AUG PPMO strongly inhibited viral translation, with capsid protein expression at 1.2% and 16% of the infected, untreated cells (Fig. 3C ). In contrast, incubation with the SINV sgP and SINV 3\u2032+ PPMO produced little inhibition of viral translation, with capsid expression at 92% and 86%, respectively, relative to the infected, mock-treated cells. These results are consistent with the SINV 5\u2032+ or SINV AUG PPMO-mediated inhibition of recombinant (SinLuc, Fig. 3A ) and wild type SINV (Fig. 3B ).\n\nIn vitro transcribed SINV RNA was used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 3D) in the presence of different ratios of molar excess of SINV (Fig. 3D , panel i) and human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14)-specific PPMO (Fig. 3D, panel ii) . None of the HRV14 specific PPMO inhibited SINV-driven translation. These results were identical to that observed for two other HRV-targeting PPMO (R. Rijnbrand, manuscript in preparation). In contrast, the SINV 3\u2032+ and SINV sgP PPMO did not inhibit viral translation. SINV 5\u2032+ and AUG showed strong inhibition of viral translation with SINV AUG, even inhibiting at a 1:1 molar ratio. SINV 5\u2032+ inhibited translation, but less efficiently than the other PPMO tested, with some detectable protein expression still evident in the presence of 10-fold molar excess.\n\nBased on the observed anti-SINV effectiveness of the SINV 5\u2032+ and SINV AUG PPMO against SINV in the above experiments, PPMO designed to target the corresponding regions of VEEV were then synthesized (Fig. 1) . While the SINV PPMO had been synthesized with P3 as the peptide component of the PPMO, the two VEEV-specific antisense and the Scr control sequences were prepared as P7-PPMO. The more-recently developed P7 was selected as the conjugation peptide for the VEEV experiments, as it has been reported to transport PPMO into cells with equal or greater ability than that provided by P3 peptide (Abes et al., 2006 ), yet is more stable (Youngblood et al., 2007) , less affected by serum (Deas et al., 2005) and less cytotoxic than P3 (Abes et al., 2006) .\n\nVero cells were infected with various strains of VEEV or, as a control, with VSV, prior to the addition of VEEV 5+, VEEV AUG or Scr PPMO (Fig. 4A ) at 5 \u03bcM. At 8 (left panel) or 24 hpi (right panel), the supernatant was harvested for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. At both time points, viral titers of the VEEV 5+ or VEEV AUG-treated cultures were below the limit of detection (0.6 log 10 PFU/ml) for all VEEV strains. In contrast, for the VSV control, viral production was relatively unaffected by PPMO treatment; VSV levels were in the range of 2-3 log 10 /ml and 5-8 log 10 PFU/ml at 8 and 24 hpi, respectively. The relative virus production for the different VEEV strains was similar at both time points, however, the titers at 24 h were \u223c5 log 10 higher. These experiments indicate that the VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO was effective at reducing the virus production at 8 and 24 hpi for multiple strains of VEEV, despite a moderate level of non-specific activity. Dose-response experiments with TC83 were subsequently performed at the same moi and incubation time, but including additional sampling time points and concentrations using the VEEV 5\u2032+ P7-PPMO conjugated to the fluorescent label, AMCA (Fig. 4B) , or as control, the P7-AMCAconjugated Scr. At the lower doses of 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM, no significant reduction in viral titer was detected for the 5\u2032+ PPMO-treated cells in comparison to Scr. However, the 5\u2032+ PPMO treatment resulted in a modest reduction at a dose of 2.5 \u03bcM, and marked reduction at doses of 5, 7.5 and 10 \u03bcM. No reduction in the virus production pattern was observed for Scr-treated cells compared to untreated VEEV-infected cells at any of the concentrations or time points tested.\n\nTo assess the robust nature of the observed qualitative differences in inhibition by the VEEV PPMO, additional analysis of the effects on VEEV (TC-83) was performed (Fig. 4C) . Vero cells were infected with VEEV or, as a control, with VSV, for 1 h (+1 h) prior to the addition of VEEV 5+, VEEV AUG or Scr PPMO at 5 \u03bcM. Supernatants were collected at 8 and 24 h for determination of the level of virus production via plaque assay, which was performed in eight replicates. A statistically significant difference in titer level was detected between VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO and VEEV AUG in pairwise comparison to either the Scr or untreated (\"No PPMO\") control (Bonferroni, p b 0.001); for VEEV 5\u2032+, a reduction of 65-68% and 43-45% was detected at 8 and 24 h, respectively, whereas a more modest reduction of 23-29% and 21-24% was detected for VEEV AUG at these time points (Fig. 4C, panel ii) . At 8 h, a small (but statistically significant) titer increase was detected for Scr treatment in comparison to untreated (\"No PPMO\"), however, there was no significant difference at 24 h (p b 0.05).\n\nTreatment of combined VEEV 5\u2032+ and VEEV AUG was evaluated at two concentrations, 7.5 mM and 10 \u03bcM (each PPMO), as shown in Fig. 4D . Vero cells were infected with VEEV (TC-83) or, as a control, with VSV, for one h (+1 h) prior to the addition of the combined VEEV.\n\nSupernatants were collected at 8 and 24 h (and for VSV, at 48 h) for determination of the level of virus production. For the treatments with combined VEEV PPMO, the percent inhibition relative to VEEVinfected, untreated Vero cells (\"No PPMO\"), as shown in the table (Fig. 4D, bottom) , was similar at both time points and concentrations; 48-51% for 5 \u03bcM of each PPMO and 46-48 for 7.5 \u03bcM of each. In contrast, for VSV, overall lower percent inhibition resulted from treatment with combined PPMO; 4 and 13% inhibition at 8 and 24 h, respectively, for 5 \u03bcM (each PPMO), and 6 and 4% inhibition, respectively, at 8 and 24 h for 10 \u03bcM (each PPMO); no substantial difference were seen at 48 h (no inhibition and 6% inhibition for 5 and 10 \u03bcM).\n\nThe animal model of VEEV using infection of NIH Swiss mice by the highly virulent ZPC738 strain is well-described (Paessler et al., 2003 . Mice develop encephalitis/paralysis and typically succumb to disease between 6 and 10 days post-infection. Our prior experience with intranasal delivery of vaccines against VEEV in mice Ni et al., 2007) suggested to us that a novel administration route of PPMO using a combination of intranasal and subcutaneous delivery would potentially be effective against neuroinvasive viruses such as VEEV. Other studies have reported that the use of 200 \u03bcg/dose (10 mg/kg) delivered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) against WNV (Deas et al., 2007) or via intravenous (i.v.) route against coxsackievirus B3 virus (Yuan et al., 2006) was nontoxic and provided antiviral effects.\n\nWe evaluated the antiviral efficacy of combined VEEV 5\u2032+ and VEEV AUG PPMO treatment by measurement of survival and viral titers in the brain and peripheral organs (Fig. 5) of mice receiving treatment with PPMO prior to (+pre) or following (+post) infection with 10 3 PFU of virulent VEEV. No deaths occurred in the group of uninfected mice receiving VEEV-specific PPMO before and after infection (8/8, 100% survival), indicating that this dosing regimen was well-tolerated. In the VEEV-infected groups, there were no survivors in the group receiving both pre-and post-infection treatment with Scr PPMO (0%, 0/10). In contrast, 100% (8/8) of the group receiving both pre-and post-infection treatment with VEEV 5+ and VEEV AUG PPMO survived while 63% (5/8) of the group receiving only post-infection treatment with the VEEV-specific PPMO survived. There was a statistically significant difference among all survival curves (logrank, p b 0.0001). Statistical comparison of survival between the group receiving PPMO treatment both before and after infection and the untreated VEEVinfected control showed a statistically significant difference (\u03b1 = 0.05; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.0002), as did the group receiving PPMO treatment only after infection, in comparison with the untreated VEEV-infected control group (\u03b1 = 0.05; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.0256).\n\nWe evaluated the VEEV titers at three early post-infection time points (2, 3 and 4 dpi) in the brain and peripheral organs of four randomly selected mice that were treated with i) PPMO diluent (mock treatment), ii) VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO before and after infection, and iii) VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO after infection (Fig. 5B) . At all time points tested, VEEV was undetectable in the blood, brain, and peripheral tissues (liver, lung and spleen) of mice that received the VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO pre-and postinfection (+pre/+post) treatments. In mice that received only postinfection (\u2212pre/+post) 5\u2032+ PPMO treatment, reduction in VEEV titer varied, depending upon the tissue examined. In the blood, VEEV titers for the VEEV 5\u2032+ treated groups were similar to those of the mocktreated mice at days 2 and 3 pi, but over 2 logs lower than mock- treated on day 4 (Fig. 5B, panel i) . In the brain, the VEEV 5\u2032+ group treated following infection (\u2212pre/+post) showed higher titer at day 2, but lower titer at days 3 and 4 compared to the mock-treated group (Fig. 5B, panel ii) ; notably, on 4 dpi, VEEV titers for the \u2212pre/+post VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO was reduced to 80 PFU/g tissue, a level near the limit of detection in this assay of 60 PFU/g. Compared to mock-treated mice, the average liver titers in the mice receiving \u2212pre/+post VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO following infection was about 1 log 10 higher at 2 dpi, and about 2 log 10 less at 3 and 4 dpi, (Fig. 5B, panel iii) . Spleen titers in the group receiving VEEV 5\u2032+ treatment following infection were similar to Luciferase (Luc) levels were measured in triplicate, as described in Materials and methods. The average and standard deviation are shown. Statistical analysis of luciferase levels of SINV PPMO vs. Scr treatment (two-way ANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.05; pairwise comparison via Bonferroni post-test) was performed and results are described in the text. B) Dose-response inhibition of wild type SINV. Panel i-ii) Effect of SINV PPMO on SINV production. BHK cells were infected with SINV at an moi of \u223c 0.03 and treated at 1 hpi with the indicated PPMO (1 or 5 \u03bcM, panels i and ii, respectively). At 24 hpi, the virus levels in supernatant samples were determined by plaque assay. Supernatants were analyzed in quadruplicate (1 \u03bcM) or triplicate (5 \u03bcM). The results of one representative experiment out of two performed is shown. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test in pairwise comparison of each PPMO-treated group relative to the mock control. Statistically significant differences in Dunnett's test are indicated by an asterisk (\u204ep-value b 0.01) and the percent reduction is shown. Panel iii) Effect of SINV PPMO on two control viruses, VSV and TC83. Vero cells were infected with VSV or VEEV (TC83) at an moi of 0.1 and treated at 1 hpi with the indicated PPMO at 5 \u03bcM. At 8 and 24 h, the virus production levels were determined by plaque assay. Viral titration of untreated, infected Vero cells (\"No PPMO\") was also performed. The result of a single experiment is shown. C) Inhibition of viral protein expression by SINV-specific PPMO. BHK cells were treated with the indicated PPMO starting at 1 h after infection with SINV (moi of 0.03). At 24 hpi the cells were incubated with 35 S-methionine for 1 h, and cell lysates then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight marker is shown. Viral capsid (C) and envelope protein (E1) and apparent molecular mass are indicated by the arrows. The percentage of C expression, relative to the mock-treated control, as determined by densitometry, is shown numerically under the lanes. D) Inhibition of viral translation by SINV-specific PPMO. In vitro transcribed SINV RNA was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of a molar excess of the indicated PPMO as described in Materials and methods. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphor imager. mock-treated mice at 2 dpi, somewhat lower than mock at 3 dpi, and considerably lower (undetectable) than mock at 4 dpi (Fig. 5B , panel iv). Lung titers were similarly low for mice treated \u2212pre/+post VEEV with 5\u2032+ and mock-treated mice at 2 and 3 dpi, while at 4 dpi, mocktreated mice had an average titer of \u223c4 log 10 while both PPMO treatment groups had undetectable titers (Fig. 5B, panel v) .\n\nVEEV is a highly lethal alphavirus that is of considerable human and veterinary health importance. No effective human vaccine or therapeutic against VEEV is presently available. Alphaviruses exhibit robust replication in both cell culture and in animals, and, as such, provide an excellent system to investigate the antiviral efficacy and specificity of PPMO. Here we have demonstrated the potent inhibition of both SINV and a variety of VEEV strains in cell culture with PPMO targeted to the 5\u2032 region of the genomic RNA. Importantly, we were able to prevent VEEV-induced lethal encephalitis in a mouse model.\n\nIn this study, we used an alphavirus of low pathogenicity to humans, Sindbis virus, to guide our design of PPMO against the highly pathogenic VEEV. The strategy was successful, as PPMO designed to target the corresponding sequence-regions in VEEV were highly effective in vitro and in vivo against VEEV. Furthermore, results with a luciferase-expressing SINV showed that the SINV-specific PPMO were strong inhibitors of viral replication (Fig. 3A) . The obtained results were consistent with results using wild type SINV (Fig. 3B) , validating the utility of SinLuc as a drug screening reagent.\n\nOf the six PPMO designed against SINV, only the two targeting the 5\u2032 region of genomic RNA were effective at inhibiting viral replication. The antiviral efficacy of PPMO targeted to various locations in the 5\u2032 end of the genome of positive-strand RNA viruses has been observed for Nidoviruses (Neuman et al., 2005; van den Born et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) , Flaviviruses (Deas et al., 2005; Kinney et al., 2005) , and Picornaviruses (Vagnozzi et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2006) . It remains undetermined why four of the six SINV PPMO in this study were relatively ineffective. Future studies may evaluate other regions of alphavirus sequence as prospective PPMO targets, including the 5\u2032 terminal-and AUG-regions of the subgenomic RNA. Results from cell culture (Fig. 3C ) and in cell-free translation assays (Fig. 3D) indicate that both active PPMO identified in this study can directly interfere with viral translation. The lack of activity by several PPMO incidentally provides confirmation of the specificity of the inhibitory action of the effective PPMO. In addition, these experiments did not reveal any non-specific toxicity associated with PPMO chemistry, which would be reflected in overall lowered luciferase (Fig. 3A) , plaque (Fig. 3B) , or viral protein production (Fig. 3C ) in comparison with untreated or Scr controls. Further evidence of the lack of toxicity of this compound is provided by cell viability assays for all PPMO used (Fig. 2) , the relatively low inhibitory activity of VEEV-specific PPMO against VSV (Fig. 4A) , the control (Scr) PPMO employed throughout this study, and the uncompromised health of PPMO-treated (uninfected) mice (Fig. 5A ).\n\nBoth the VEEV 5\u2032+ and AUG PPMO were highly effective against multiple strains of VEEV in cell culture (Fig. 4A) . This is not surprising, considering the high to perfect sequence conservation of the PPMO target sites among the VEEV strains tested. Similar sequence conservation is present in all the VEEV strains available from GenBank (data not shown), and indicates that these two PPMO may represent a useful antiviral treatment for enzootic as well as epidemic strains of VEEV. Studies designed to target the corresponding conserved sequences in two other major groups of encephalitic alphaviruses, EEEV and WEEV, are currently in progress.\n\nComplete protection was provided against otherwise lethal VEEVinduced disease in the murine model when antisense PPMO were administered both before and after infection. However, post-infection PPMO treatment conferred partial protection, indicating that PPMO may be useful even in a strictly therapeutic setting. Tissue titer data (Fig. 5B ) reflected the survival profiles (Fig. 5A) in the mouse efficacy experiment, and clearly implicates reduction in virus production as the mechanism of efficacy of the antisense PPMO. The novel PPMO administration scheme employed in this study (subcutaneous combined with intranasal) is deserving further exploration, as it may be that modification of the relative proportions and doses of PPMO delivered by these two inoculation routes could be fine-tuned to further enhance efficacy. Notably, the two modes of administration employed here are preferable to intravenous injection for prospective human treatment. It will also be of interest to explore PPMO efficacy against VEEV strains other than ZPC738 in this same mouse model, or against VEEV in other animal models.\n\nAll PMO were synthesized at AVI BioPharma Inc. (Corvallis, OR) by methods previously described . SINVspecific PMO were covalently conjugated, at the 5\u2032 end, to the arginine-rich peptide NH 2 -R 9 F 2 C-CONH 2 (abbreviated 'P3'), and VEEVspecific PMO to NH 2 -(RXR) 4 XB-CONH 2 (X = 6-aminohexanoic acid, B = Beta alanine) (abbreviated 'P7'). The conjugation, purification and analysis of PPMO were performed by procedures previously described (Abes et al., 2006; Moulton et al., 2004) . Additionally, P7-PPMO versions of the VEEV 5+ and Scr were prepared with the fluor AMCA (7-amino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl acetic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) conjugated to the 3\u2032 end by methods similar to those described previously for carboxyfluorescein conjugation to PMO (Moulton et al., 2003) .\n\nPPMO of 21-22 bases in length were designed to target, by complementary base pairing, regions in SINV or VEEV that have been identified as important in the viral RNA synthesis or translation. The PPMO sequences and name designations are specified in Table 1 and a schematic representation of their target locations is provided in Fig. 1 . Additionally, a 20-mer PMO of random sequence having 50% G/C content (named 'Scr') was conjugated to either P3 or P7 peptide for use as a control for non-sequence-specific activity of the two respective PPMO chemistries. To preclude unintentional hybridization events, antisense and negative control PPMO sequences were screened via BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) against primate and murine mRNA sequences. In addition, the negative control was screened against all published alphavirus sequences. PPMO targeted to human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14) were used as additional controls for SINV in vitro translation experiments. Prior to use, lyophilized PPMO were suspended with filter-sterilized distilled water to a concentration of 1-2 mM, and stored at 4\u00b0C. \n\nThe following VEEV strains were used: ZPC738 (Roehrig and Bolin, 1997; Wang et al., 1999) , TC-83 (Berge et al., 1961; Kinney et al., 1989) , SH3 (Rico-Hesse et al., 1995) , and 68U201 (Oberste et al., 1996; Scherer et al., 1970) . Alphavirus stocks were generated by growth in cell culture and the viral titer of the stock was obtained via plaque assay, as described previously (Paessler et al., 2003) . Sindbis virus (SINV, TE12) was obtained by electroporation of BHK cells with RNA derived from pTOTO1101 (Rice et al., 1987) . A clone containing an infectious copy of SinLuc was a gift from Ilya Frolov (UTMB). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was obtained from Scott Weaver.\n\nThe baby hamster kidney cell line, BHK21 (BHK), (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and Vero cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Hyclone, Logan, UT) with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.\n\nFor the P3-conjugated SINV-specific PPMO, spectrophotometric measurement of the reduction of MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to formazan was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) (Mosmann, 1983) . BHK cells at 80% confluency were incubated with the indicated PPMO in the range of 0.1-20 \u03bcM for 24 h. The production of formazan relative to mock-treated cells was used to assess PPMO toxicity. For the P7-and P7-AMCA-conjugated VEEV-specific (VEEV 5\u2032+ or VEEV AUG) and the control (Scr) PPMO, viability assay measuring the conversion of resazurin to resorufin was performed using CellTiter-Blue\u00ae Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, Vero cells were incubated with PPMO concentrations in the range of 0-7.5 \u03bcM for 1 h, after which the incubation media was removed and cells incubated for various time periods (0, 4, 10, 20, 24, 36 and 48 h). Each treatment was performed in quadruplicate wells. At the designated time point, 20 \u03bcl of CellTiter-Blue was added to each well. Plates were then incubated in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, and read on a Bio-Tek FLx800 fluorescent plate reader (560 Ex /590 Em nm).\n\nIn vitro transcription of pSinLuc and electroporation of RNA into BHK cells was performed to generate viral stocks for infection, as described previously (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991) . BHK cells were infected with SINV or SinLuc at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of \u223c 0.03 and treated at 1 h post-infection (hpi) with the indicated PPMO. The cells were then incubated for 24 h and virus production was determined via plaque assay of virus production or via quantitative luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro translation reactions were performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), as described by the supplier. Lysates were programmed with 125 ng RNA/10 \u03bcl lysate and were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphor imager. Statistical analysis of the average luciferase levels obtained from triplicate measurement was performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.05) with pairwise comparison of each SINV PPMO with Scr using Bonferroni's post-test using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA). Statistical analysis of the level of virus production (log 10 transformed) obtained from quadruplicate (1 \u03bcM) or triplicate (5 \u03bcM) values was performed using one-way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test for pairwise comparison of each PPMO-treated group to the mock-treated control (GraphPad Prism 4.0). To further evaluate potential non-specific effects of the SINV PPMO, experiments were performed using Vero cells infected with VSV or VEEV (TC-83) at an moi of 0.1 and then treated with the SINV 5\u2032+, SINV AUG or Scr PPMO at 1 h post-infection (+1 h). Cell supernatants were harvested at 8 and 24 hpi for determination of viral titer via plaque assay. In parallel, supernatants were also collected from untreated, infected Vero cells (\"No PPMO\") for viral titration.\n\nBHK cells were infected with SINV at an moi of 0.03 and treated with PPMO at 1 hpi. 35 S-methionine was added to cells at 24 hpi and cells harvested 1 h later. Cell lysates were prepared by detergent lysis and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by densitometry (Storm 840 gel imaging system). Viral proteins were identified (E1, \u223c 52kDa; C, \u223c32kDa) using a 14 C labeled molecular weight marker (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL), as published previously (Paessler et al., 2003) .\n\nVero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with the indicated strain of VEEV (TC-83, SH3, ZPC738, or 68U201), or, as a negative control, with VSV and incubated for 1-2 h (+1 or +2 h, as indicated in the figure legends) prior to the addition of the indicated VEEV PPMO (AUG, VEEV 5\u2032+, or Scr). Virus containing media was removed and the indicated PPMO was added at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM. Supernatant was harvested at 8 or 24 hpi for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay (Paessler et al., 2003) . Statistical analysis of virus titers (log 10 transformed) obtained from eight replicate values (where indicated in figure legend) was performed using one-way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) with Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test for pairwise comparison of each group. Combined PPMO treatment was performed as described above. Briefly, Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with the indicated strain of VEEV (TC-83), or as a control, with VSV, and incubated for +1 h prior to the addition of 7.5 or 10 \u03bcM (each PPMO) of combined VEEV AUG and VEEV 5\u2032+. As a control, untreated Vero cells were incubated in parallel. Plaque assay of supernatants obtained at 8, 24, and 48 h (the latter for VSV only) was performed.\n\nNine-week-old NIH Swiss mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) , and allowed to acclimatize for at least 1 week. All studies were approved by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and work with VEEV was performed at the Biosafety Level-3 in accordance with UTMB Health and Safety approval and guidelines. Mice were allowed food and water ad libitum throughout the studies.\n\nMice were treated with VEEV-specific PPMO (combined AUG and 5\u2032+ in equal amounts) or the random control PPMO (Scr) in serumfree DMEM at a dose per mouse of 40 \u03bcg via i.n. route and 160 \u03bcg via s.c. route at time points pre-(2 doses: \u2212 24 h and \u2212 4 h, indicated as \"+pre\") and/or post-infection (5 doses: daily on day +1 through +5, indicated as \"+post\"). On day 0, the indicated groups were infected with 10 3 PFU of virulent VEEV (ZPC738) via i.n. route. Control groups consisted of the following: 1) VEEV-specific PPMOtreated, VEEV-infected mice, and 2) VEEV-infected, but untreated mice. Mice (N = 8-10 per group) were monitored daily for death over a 28-day period following infection. At 2, 3 and 4 days postinfection (dpi), four animals per group were euthanized for harvest of blood, brain and peripheral organs (liver, spleen and lung). Infectious virus levels in the tissues were determined via plaque assay, as described previously (Paessler et al., 2003) . Statistical analysis of survival for all groups over the indicated period was performed using logrank test at a significant level of \u03b1 b 0.05 in GraphPad\u00ae Prism (San Diego, CA). For pairwise comparison of the survival of treated and untreated (or mock-treated) groups Fisher's Exact Test was performed at a significance level of \u03b1 b 0.05 in GraphPad\u00ae Prism."}
