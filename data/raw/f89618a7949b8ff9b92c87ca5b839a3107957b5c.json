{"title": "A novel defective recombinant porcine enterovirus G virus carrying a 2 porcine torovirus papain-like cysteine protease gene and a putative anti- 3 apoptosis gene in place of viral structural protein genes 4 5 6 Ryo Imai", "body": "Enterovirus G (EV-G) is an enveloped RNA virus, belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. 54 More than 20 types of EV-G, known as EV-G1 to EV-G20, have been identified [1, 2] . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/510131 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3 60\n\nBy using a metagenomics approach, we have detected the genomes of EV-G1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 61 and a new type of EV-Gs in feces of pigs with or without diarrhea in Japan [3] . Among them, 16 62 isolates of EV-G1 and one isolate of EV-G2 show an insertion of a papain-like cysteine protease 63 (PLCP) gene from porcine torovirus at the 2C-3A junction sites [4] (Fig. 1A) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/510131 doi: bioRxiv preprint downstream flanking sequences (Fig. 1B) .\n\nTo confirm the genome sequence of the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G obtained by 114 metagenomics analysis, we performed long RT-PCR to amplify the viral genome approximately 115 every 1 kb with overlapping regions and subjected the PCR products for direct sequencing (Fig. 1B) .\n\nThese analyses revealed that the new type 2 recombinant EV-G genome was approximately 6.7 kb- "}
