{"title": "A new oxygen modification cyclooctaoxygen binds to nucleic acids as sodium crown complex HHS Public Access Author manuscript", "body": "The chemical element oxygen exists in eight well-characterized allotropic modifications, dioxygen (O 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), and the solid \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, \u03b4-, \u03b5and \u03b6-oxygen phases (reviewed in [1] ). The \u03b3-, \u03b2and \u03b1-phases exist at ambient pressure (p = 101.325 kPa) and low temperature (\u03b3 at T < 54.4 K; \u03b2 at T < 43.8 K; \u03b1 at T < 23.8 K) [1, 2] . At ambient temperature (T = 295 K) under pressure of 5.4 GPa oxygen solidifies into the \u03b2-phase, then at 9.6 GPa into the orthorhombic 'orange' \u03b4-phase, and, successively, at 10 GPa into the monoclinic 'dark red' \u03b5-phase. Above 96 GPa \u03b5-oxygen is transformed into the metallic \u03b6-phase which exhibits superconductivity (T c = 0.6 K) [1, 2] . The 'red' \u03b5-phase revealed the structure of two combined tetroxetane (cyclo-O 4 ) rings, giving rise to rhombohedral O 8 clusters [2] . In 1990 a ninth allotropic modification of oxygen was theoretically predicted [3] , the cyclooctaoxygen (cyclo-O 8 , octoxocane) (Fig. 1A) [1, 3] , assumed to exist in analogy to the common modification of elemental sulfur, cyclooctasulfur (cyclo-S 8 , octathiocane) [3] . We now wish to report the (biomimetic) synthesis, isolation, chemical characterization, biochemical and epigenetic significance of cyclo-O 8 in form of its sodium crown complex, (octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium(1+) or cyclo-O 8 -Na + (Fig. 1B) , which can be liganded to give aqua(chloro)(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 \n\nThe FT-IR spectroscopy experiments were recorded in solid potassium bromide pellets on a Digilab Excalibur FTS 4000 spectrophotometer (Digilab, Inc., Holliston, MA), or neat by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) on a Nicolet iS5 FT-IR Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). The FT-Raman spectroscopy experiments were recorded neat on a Bruker FT-Raman spectrometer RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). The Raman excitation source was a Nd:YAG-laser (\u03bb = 1,064 nm). Given FT-IR absorbance and FT-Raman emission bands, both expressed in wavenumbers \u03bd\u0303 (cm \u22121 ), are characterized in intensity as strong (str), middle (m), weak (w), and broad (br (4,200 \u03bcl, 43 .1340 mmol). Then acetone (1,000 ml) was added. Afterwards, the crystallizing solution was cooled at +0-2 \u00b0C for 3 h. The suspension was frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C for 2.5 h. The evolved first yield (9.927 g) of the crystalline, white product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. Acetone (600 ml) was added to the filtrate, and it was frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C for 18 h. The evolved second yield (266 mg) of the product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. The filtrate was frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C for 28 h. The evolved third yield (217 mg) of the product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. All yields were combined (10.410 g, 91%). 1 9. 3716 mmol) were dissolved in water (20 ml) supplied with 90% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (60 ml). The solution was refluxed for 90 min. Afterwards, the yellow solution was cooled at RT (\u03d1 = 16.4 \u00b0C) for 10 min, then at +0-2 \u00b0C for 50 min. Acetone (50 ml) was added, and the turbid solution was frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C for 1 h. Afterwards, sodium hydroxide (380 mg, 9.5000 mmol) dissolved in water (3 ml) was added under stirring. An ultrashort color change to orange was visible. The resulting turbid yellowish solution was filtered through one layer of filter paper. Residues were transferred with acetone (200 ml) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 100 ml). The filtrate was frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C for 2 h. EtOAc 24.48) . The NMR resonances were assigned according to literature data [6, 7] . The exact cation mass was calculated according to literature data [8] . 9. 3716 mmol) were dissolved in water (20 ml) supplied with 90% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (60 ml). The solution was refluxed for 90 min. Afterwards, the yellow solution was cooled at RT (\u03d1 = 13.9 \u00b0C) for 10 min, then at +0-2 \u00b0C for 50 min. Acetone (50 ml) was added, and the turbid solution was frozen at \u221225 \u00b0C for 1 h. Afterwards, sodium hydroxide (380 mg, 9.5000 mmol) dissolved in water (3 ml) was added under stirring. An ultrashort color change to orange was visible. The resulting turbid yellowish solution was filtered through one layer of filter paper. Residues were transferred with acetone (200 ml) and Kesel \n\nAssays were performed at RT (\u03d1 \u03d5 = 18.03 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b0C). The detection of oxygen evolution was substantiated by visual inspection [11] \n\nThe average volume of human lymphocytes was taken as 206 fl (206 \u03bcm 3 ) [12] . The average volume of bovine lymphocytes was taken as 214 fl (femtoliter) after introducing a technical correction factor of f = 0.834 [13] . The reference genome size of Bos taurus (Hereford breed) was taken as 2,670,139,648 bp (RefSeq assembly accession number GCF_000003055.6) [14] . This genome showed 41.89% GC content [14] . The theoretical \n\nThe phosphorus (P) content of murine cryptal enterocytic mitotic (late anaphase/early telophase) chromatin was taken as 298.5 \u00b1 17.3 mmol (P)/kg [21] . The reference values for the phosphorus content were calculated as 3,162.47 mmol (P)/kg (free DNA) and 2,859.31 mmol (P)/kg (sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + -complexed DNA), respectively, according to the formula w (P) = (n P \u00d7 1,000 g) \u00d7 M \u22121 (n P , number of P atoms pro formula unit; M, molecular weight of formula unit). The reference value for the P content of phospholipid was calculated as 1,362.32 mmol (P)/kg for (dipalmitoyl)phosphatidylcholine (M = 734.04 g/mol), the main constituent (60.8 \u00b1 1.3%) of the phospholipid fraction in rat liver chromatin [22] . The fractions of DNA (32.0 \u00b1 4.1%), RNA (5.1 \u00b1 1.6%), protein (62.6 \u00b1 3.8%), and phospholipid (0.3 \u00b1 0.1%) in mitotic chromatin of rodent liver cells were taken as published [22] , and applied on the primary murine cryptal enterocytic mitotic chromatin nucleic acids (DNA + RNA). The published [21] value was corrected for the chromatinbound cation (Na + , K + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ ) [21] , protein and phospholipid [22] \n\nThe cytotoxicity and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain LAI replication assays were performed in freshly explanted primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM cells) according to published procedures [23] . The assays were conducted at least in triplicate and treated statistically (if possible).\n\nThe cytotoxicity and human hepatitis B virus (HBV) subtype ayw replication assays were performed in HepAD38 cells (HepG2 hepatoblastoma cell-derived, stably transfected cell line, producing HBV subtype ayw under control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter) according to published procedures [24] . The assays were conducted in triplicate and treated statistically.\n\nThe cytotoxicity and influenza A/California/07/2009 (pandemic swine-origin H1N1, resistant to amantadine due to a S31N mutation in M2 protein [25] ) and influenza A/duck/ Minnesota/1525/81 (low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, amantadine-susceptible, kindly provided by Dr. Robert G. Webster, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) antiviral assays were performed utilizing the neutral red assay, and the virus yield reduction assay, in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells according to published procedures [26] . The assays were conducted in triplicate and treated statistically.\n\nThe cytotoxicity and chikungunya virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus, SFV complex) strain S-27 [ATCC\u00ae VR-64 \u2122 , obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA] antiviral assays were performed utilizing the neutral red assay, and the virus yield reduction assay, in Vero 76 cells. The cells were maintained in MEM (MEM/EBSS, Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NC was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mM, and then further diluted in the test medium half log dilutions to a final DMSO concentration of \u2264 5% DMSO with 1,000, 320, 100, 32, 10, 3.2, 1.0, and 0.32 \u03bcM of the compound for antiviral testing. The utilized positive control was interferon alfacon-1 (INFERGEN \u2122 ), a consensus interferon-\u03b1 1. The assays were conducted in triplicate and treated statistically.\n\nThe [27] . The assays were conducted in triplicate and treated statistically.\n\nNC was evaluated for cytotoxicity and inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) using the neutral red lysosomal uptake cell viability assay [28] essentially as described previously [29, 30] . Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates for the in vitro assays and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 before testing so that cells were 80-100% confluent upon infection. Each dilution of test or control compound was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate, and three wells of each dilution were then infected with the test virus. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was \u2264 0.007 cell culture infective dose 50% (CCID 50 )/cell for each virus. Two wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. Six wells per plate were set aside as uninfected, untreated cell controls, and six wells per plate were infected with no treatment as virus controls. A known active compound was assayed in parallel as a control. The test medium was MEM with 2% FBS for chikungunya virus and MERS coronavirus, and MEM with 1 IU/ml trypsin and 10 \u03bcg/ml of EDTA for influenza A viruses. Assay plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . After 3 days, when CPE was observed microscopically, each well was filled with 0.011% (m/v) neutral red, a vital stain, and the plate was incubated for \u2248 2 h at 20-25 \u00b0C. The unincorporated neutral red solution was removed from the wells and the incorporated dye was then eluted by adding S\u00f8rensen citrate-buffered ethanol. The plates were then read on a spectrophotometer at \u03bb = 540 nm wavelength to quantify the neutral red taken up by the healthy cells. The optical density of test wells was converted to percent of cell control and normalized to the virus controls. The concentration of test compound required to inhibit CPE by 50% (EC 50 ) was calculated by regression analysis. The concentration of compound that would cause 50% CPE in the absence of virus (CC 50 ) was also calculated by regression analysis using the uninfected wells treated with test compounds compared with untreated cell controls. The selectivity index 50% (SI 50 ) is the CC 50 divided by EC 50 . Assays were conducted in triplicate, and the arithmetic mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated.\n\nThe virus yield reduction assay determines actual virus yield in the presence and absence of the test compound; this is the confirmatory assay for antiviral activity and was performed on influenza A and chikungunya viruses. After 3 days' incubation when maximum CPE was observed in the neutral red assay plates, an aliquot of supernatant fluid was removed from each test well. Replicate wells of each compound concentration or control were pooled and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Samples were thawed and diluted by 10-fold serial dilutions. A 100 \u03bcl aliquot of each dilution was then plated onto 4 replicate wells of 96-well plates seeded with the applicable cells for each virus strain. Plates were incubated as noted above until viral CPE reached its endpoint, then each well was scored microscopically for the presence of viral CPE. The virus titer was determined based on the endpoint using the Reed-Muench method [31] . Test wells were compared with virus control wells, and the concentration of compound required to reduce virus yield by 90% or 1 log 10 (EC 90 ) was calculated by regression analysis. Assays were conducted in (at least) triplicate, and the arithmetic mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.) were calculated.\n\nIn an endeavor to gain new antiviral substances, the reported reaction [32] of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) nucleoside cytidine with ninhydrin on reflux was re-examined. Instead of cytidine, cytidine hydrochloride (cytidine \u00d7 HCl) was utilized ( Fig. 2A) . The reported reaction [32] did not proceed, instead a crystalline material NC could be isolated which gave not the elemental analysis of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. This striking difference of NC from cytidine \u00d7 HCl was examined further by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1 ), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2) , FT-Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S3) , and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) ( Fig. S4A and Fig. S5 ). It could be substantiated that NC contained an inert material not being salt (NaCl), since the FT-IR spectrum of NC differed from that of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. According to elemental analysis this inert material could account for one O 2 and a quarter of NaCl pro one cytidine \u00d7 HCl. In consequence, the formula was multiplied fourfold and this resulted in an oxygen 8-ring, cyclo-O 8 (Fig. 1A) , coordinated to one Na + (Fig. 1B) . The interpretation of the ESI-MS spectrum of NC actually proved the inclusion of cyclo-O 8 -Na + in NC, revealing was the detection of the aqua(octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium(1+) cation (Fig.  S5) . Since in the 1 H-NMR spectrum of NC, in comparison to the 1 H-NMR reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl, the differentially affected resonances were the 4-NH 2 , the 3-NH + , and the H-5 protons of the protonated cytidine (Fig. S1) , it is assumed that the points of coordination between cyclo-O 8 -Na + and cytidine \u00d7 HCl are the two 4-NH 2 hydrogens and one non-Na + -coordinated (free) oxygen of cyclo-O 8 -Na + . Consequently, a formula for NC can be elaborated: cytidine hydrochloride -aqua(chloro)(octoxocane\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium (4:1) (Fig. 2A) . The FT-Raman spectrum of NC (Fig. S3B ) was nearly identical to the reference spectrum of cytidine \u00d7 HCl (Fig. S3A) . This, contrary to expectation, pointed to Raman-inactivity of cyclo-O 8 -Na + .\n\nThe new ninhydrin reaction was in turn applied on 2\u2032-deoxycytidine hydrochloride (2\u2032deoxycytidine \u00d7 HCl) (Fig. 2B) . A crystalline material dNC could be isolated which gave not the elemental analysis of 2\u2032-deoxycytidine \u00d7 HCl. The FT-IR spectrum of dNC differed from that of 2\u2032-deoxycytidine \u00d7 HCl (Fig. S6) . The interpretation of the ESI-MS spectrum ( Fig. S4B and Fig. S7 ) of dNC proved the inclusion of cyclo-O 8 -Na + in dNC. The detection of the {octoxocane + (2\u2032-deoxycytidine) m + 4-amino-1-[(2R)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2yl]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one + H} + (m = 0, 1, 2) cations proved the existence of cyclooctaoxygen for the first time. In analogy to NC, supported by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy of dNC (Fig.  S8A) , a formula for dNC can be constructed: 2\u2032-deoxycytidine hydrochloride -aqua(chloro) (octoxocane-\u03ba 4 O 1 ,O 3 ,O 5 ,O 7 )sodium (2:1) (Fig. 2B ).\n\nNext it was questioned if cyclo-O 8 -Na + could be produced in biomimetic reactions, and it was considered that in the two ninhydrin reactions ( Fig. 2A, B) [33] . The selected RNA was Candida utilis anamorph yeast low-molecular weight RNA. This RNA consists of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the C. utilis 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [34, 35] . As a result it was discovered that NC catalyzed oxygen formation from H 2 O 2 (catalase effect) [11] weakly in presence of NaHCO 3 , and strongly in presence of both C. utilis RNA and NaHCO 3 (Fig. S9) . Interestingly, NC could be fully substituted by cytidine \u00d7 HCl. Multiple controls assured that oxygen neither was produced spontaneously, nor from any other relevant combination of the utilized reagents. Taken together, the nucleoside cytidine, not cyclo-O 8 -Na + , was responsible for the catalase activity expressed in presence of H 2 O 2 and C. utilis RNA under biomimetic conditions.\n\nIt was decided to exactly scale-up (21-fold) the catalase assay protocol starting with cytidine \u00d7 HCl and C. utilis RNA to detect any cyclo-O 8 -Na + formation under biomimetic conditions (Fig. 2C) . From this preparation a cyclo-O 8 -Na + -containing crystalline material RC could be isolated which gave not the elemental analysis of cytidine \u00d7 HCl. If the C. utilis RNA was omitted, no product RC could be isolated, only cytidine \u00d7 HCl. Based on 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S8B) and FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. S10 ) of RC, a formula for RC can be constructed: cytidine hydrochloride -\u03bc-chloro(\u03bc-hydroxy)bis(octoxocane- (Fig. 2C ). We suggest a mechanism for the generation of cyclo-O 8 from atmospheric O 2 under ninhydrin catalysis (Fig. 2D) . Ninhydrin can dissociate to the ninhydrinate anion which in the heat could absorb four O 2 molecules to form an anion of a nonaoxidane. The 10-ring intermediate spiro[indene-2,10\u2032-nonoxecane]-1,3-dione could be formed from the nonaoxidanide under acid catalysis, followed by extrusion of cyclo-O 8 .\n\nFinal structure proof for the existence of cyclo-O 8 was obtained from the ESI-MS of RC ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S11 ). Cluster cations of heptoxazocan-8-ium -octoxocane -Na 35 Cl (1:2:m) (m = 0-6) were observed, together with characteristic +2 isotope peaks resulting from substitution of one 37 Cl for 35 Cl (m = 1-6), and together with \u22122 peaks of heptoxazocan-8iumyl -octoxocane (1:2) cluster radical cations (m = 0-6) (Fig. 3) . Clusters of [(cytidine) 2 + Na + (NaCl) n ] + (n = 0-5) were also observed (Fig. 3) . Structure proving was the missing of a +2 peak for m = 0 (Fig. 3, inset) , indicating that any NaCl is absent in this radical cation m/z 383.9907. The nitrogen insertion into cyclo-O 8 to give heptoxazocane (HNO 7 ) results from mass spectrometric generation of ammonia NH 3 from cytidine (O 8 + NH 3 \u2192 HNO 7 + H 2 O). The increased mass error is due to the small intensity (< 1%) of the cluster cation peaks [36] . An analogous loss of accuracy (mass error \u2265 \u00b1 50 ppm for peak intensity \u2264 1.43%) was reported for DNA oligonucleotide analysis by ESI-MS [36] .\n\nIn view of the biomimetic generation of the cyclo-O 8 -Na + -containing coordination complex RC, the question arose if cyclo-O 8 -Na + could bind to nucleic acids, because of the mere electrostatic attraction of the cyclo-O 8 -Na + cation towards the negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA and DNA. For this purpose thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays [37] were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC.\n\nFirstly, the affinity of the cyclo-O 8 -Na + towards C. utilis low-molecular weight RNA was investigated (Fig. S12) . It was found that the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC retained the chromatographic shift of C. utilis 5S rRNA, but not the chromatographic shift of C. utilis tRNAs. Interestingly, since work conditions were not human skin ribonuclease (RNase)free, the RNase A digestion products of C. utilis 5S rRNA were separated chromatographically (Fig. S12) . These dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates (products of RNase A digestion) [38] result from human skin RNase 7 [39] -mediated digestion of C. utilis 5S rRNA. The structures of these dinucleotides can be deduced [34, 35] , since RNase 7 belongs to the RNase A superfamily [39] . The cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC bound strongly to these dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates, since their chromatographic shifts were significantly retarded. Controls were included to differentiate the sole binding of cytidine \u00d7 HCl to the RNA targets by Watson-Crick base pairing [40] from the indicative cyclo-O 8 -Na + plus cytidine \u00d7 HCl binding to the RNA targets.\n\nAccordingly, the affinity of the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC towards salmon testes singlestranded deoxyribonucleic acid [ssDNA, generated by sonication of salmon genomic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)] was investigated (Fig. S13) . It was found that the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC retained the chromatographic shift of cytidine \u00d7 HCl complexed to ssDNA. As control served cytidine \u00d7 HCl complexed to ssDNA. In vivo DNA-rich preparations are known since 1677 [41] to be found in close association with spermine phosphate when Antoni van Leeuwenhoek discovered the characteristic crystals of spermine phosphate (spermine \u00d7 2 H 3 PO 4 \u00d7 6 H 2 O) [42] in human semen. Therefore, the affinity of the cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC towards salmon testes ssDNA in absence and presence of spermine \u00d7 1 \u2153 (sodium dihydrogen phosphate) \u00d7 9 H 2 O was investigated (Fig. S14) . It was found that the spermine \u00d7 1 \u2153 (sodium dihydrogen phosphate) \u00d7 9 H 2 O changed the chromatographic shift of the cytidine \u00d7 HCl in NC-complexed ssDNA. As controls served cytidine \u00d7 HCl complexed to ssDNA in absence and presence of cyclo-O 8 -Na + , and cytidine \u00d7 HCl complexed to ssDNA in presence of spermine \u00d7 1 \u2153 (sodium dihydrogen phosphate) \u00d7 9 H 2 O. Taken together, cyclo-O 8 -Na + contained in NC has the ability to bind to RNA dinucleotide 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates, eukaryotic 5S rRNA, eukaryotic ssDNA, and to construct a ternary complex with spermine phosphate and eukaryotic ssDNA.\n\nThe in vitro biological effects of NC and dNC on the growth of cultured cells, freshly explanted human primary (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBM cells), immortalized T-lymphoblastic (CCRF-CEM) and monkey kidney normal epithelial (Vero), were investigated (Table S1 ). NC and dNC were non-toxic to PBM cells, but stimulated the growth of CCRF-CEM cells. This pointed to a catalase effect exerted by NC and dNC, since CCRF-CEM cells are extremely sensitive to H 2 O 2 [43] , and scavenging of H 2 O 2 by 'catalase factors' is CCRF-CEM cell growth rate-limiting [43, 44] . Since NC was more active as a growth stimulant for CCRF-CEM cells than dNC, the responsible 'catalase factors' should be the nucleoside hydrochlorides, not the equimolar cyclo-O 8 -Na + -content in NC and dNC. NC and dNC exhibited no significant in vitro antiviral activities against the retro-transcribing human immunodeficiency type 1 and hepatitis B viruses (HIV-1 and HBV) (Table S1 ). NC showed no significant in vitro inhibiting activity versus the replication of influenza A, chikungunya and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses (Table S2 ). In summary, cyclo-O 8 -Na + is, contrary to expectation, essentially non-toxic to human cells, and cytidine in conjunction with RNA acts as a catalyst in producing cyclo-O 8 -Na + from ubiquitous [45] H 2 O 2 through a catalase reaction in cultured human cells.\n\nOur findings have important consequences for the epigenetics [46] of eukaryotic in vivo DNA. We suggest a model for a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4) , based on the observed complexation of cyclo-O 8 -Na + and spermine phosphate to ssDNA. One reason why this protecting shield of in vivo DNA was overlooked until now may be its destruction during DNA purification by the classical phenol extraction method of Schuster, Schramm & Zillig [47] . In our model (Fig. 4A ) the phosphate backbone of ssDNA binds one cyclo-O 8 -Na + pro three nucleotides, and this binary complex binds one spermine monophosphate to form a ternary epigenetic core of DNA. The monohydrogen phosphate bridges the cyclo-O 8 -Na + with the sperminium cation, and the cyclo-O 8 -Na + has an inverted alternating orientation (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the sperminium tetracation cannot bind alone to DNA in this model, since the distances [d (N 1 ,N 4 ) = 490 pm; d (N 1 ,N 12 ) = 1,600 pm] between the four ammonium nitrogens do not fit the average repeating distance (d \u00d8 = 650 \u00b1 30 pm) of the phosphate anion charges of DNA. Therefore, it is quite remarkable that in our model for the first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A ) a repeating unit is formed from cyclo-O 8 -Na + and spermine phosphate that perfectly fits both the triplet nature of the genetic code [48] and the repeating distance of the phosphate anion backbone of DNA.\n\nEvidence for the correctness of this model results from the published investigation of spermine distribution in bovine lymphocytes [15] . The theoretical intracellular concentration of the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex required to cover all triplets of the dsDNA genome in a blood lymphocyte of Bos taurus was calculated as 13.8130 mM (see Section 2.9.). The actual concentration of spermine was measured as 1.57 \u00b1 0.12 (mM \u00b1 s.d.) [15] . Therefore, the coverage of B. taurus genome can be calculated as 2.62 \u00b1 0.50 (% \u00b1 s.d.) (see Section 2.9). A correlation was obtained when this value was compared to the proportion of protein-coding exons in B. taurus genome which was calculated as 2.64% or 2.68% by two independent methods (see Section 2.9.). This points to complete coverage of actively transcribed gene regions in B. taurus interphase genome by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex. Since spermine binds more strongly to GC-rich dsDNA (pBR322 plasmid) [15] , it can be assumed that the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex binds preferentially to epigenetic, non-methylated CpG island hotspots [49] and is involved in epigenetic gene regulation [49] .\n\nAdditional evidence for the correctness of the model results from the published concentration of spermine in the metaphase chromatin of eukaryotic HeLa S3 cells [20] . The content of spermine in HeLa S3 cell metaphase chromatin was calculated as 135.9 \u00b1 16.1 pmol spermine/82.84 zmol dsDNA (see Section 2.10.). This corresponds to 1.64 \u00d7 10 9 molecules spermine (and, hence, of sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + ) pro one HeLa S3 cell diploid genome, corresponding to a haploid genomic coverage of 12.6%. This is a reasonable result, since spermine synthesis is highest in the metaphase of mitosis in the cell cycle, coincident with an extraordinary high condensation grade of metaphase chromatin [50] . Control for this in vitro result is the published elemental phosphorus content (mmol/kg dry weight) in mitotic chromatin of primary cryptal enterocytes of murine duodenum [21] . The obtained in vivo value corresponds to a haploid genomic coverage of 12.4%, and a nuclear RNA coverage of 77.3%, by the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex in mitotic chromatin (see Section 2.11.). This points to a function of sperminium phosphate/ cyclo-O 8 -Na + occupation for nuclear RNA.\n\nWe also wish to elaborate a model for selenium (hydrogen selenite, HSeO 3 -) protection of DNA. Selenium is essential to mammalian physiology at nutritional levels, but supraphysiological intake of selenium is known to be toxic for mammals [51] [52] [53] . Selenium has the ability to protect DNA from noxious influences (oxidative stress, radiation, cytotoxic agents) [51] , and is essential to genomic stability [52] , but the exact molecular biological basis for these phenomena is unknown. If in our model of a first epigenetic shell of in vivo DNA (Fig. 4A ) the monohydrogen phosphate is replaced by hydrogen selenite (Fig. 4B) , an epigenetic explanation for the interaction of selenium with eukaryotic in vivo DNA could be given. This model may account for, at least some of, the well-known bimodal, protective and toxic, in vivo effects exerted by selenium onto mammalian physiology [51] [52] [53] . A moderate substitution pattern of hydrogen selenite for monohydrogen phosphate would be essential, but if the displacement ratio HSeO 3 -/HPO 4 2exceeds a certain tolerance level, the epigenetic equilibrium could collapse.\n\nWe allow us the profound conclusions that sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + coverage of nucleic acids is essential for eukaryotic gene regulation, and, in conjunction with selenite, protects and stabilizes gene-rich 'open chromatin' euchromatic DNA [54] and various nuclear RNAs. These postulations would account for a long-sought molecular explanation of the essential, but 'mysterious' function of the polyamine spermine in eukaryotes [55] . Spermine is found only in eukaryotes, with some exceptions, and prokaryotes rely mostly on putrescine and spermidine [55, 56] . The essentiality of spermine for humans is exemplified by the Snyder-Robinson X-linked mental retardation syndrome [57] caused by missense mutations in the human spermine synthase gene, leading to mental retardation, generalised seizures, absent speech, inability to stand, and other severe defects [57] . One can speculate that at the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life the sperminium phosphate/cyclo-O 8 -Na + complex resulted as a consequence from the combined accumulation of atmospheric oxygen and prokaryotic RNA, since the evolution of spermine synthases from prokaryotic spermidine synthase was proposed [56] as co-occurring with the onset of proto-eukaryotic life.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
