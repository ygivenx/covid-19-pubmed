{"title": "Abdominal Distension Organomegaly", "body": "Defensive response when threatened (may freeze, retreat, climb, or hide but aggression eventually becomes an option) Play/predatory/attention-seeking response Aggression as a response to frustration (also known as redirected aggression) Aggression that arises as a result of disease processes (see Pathophysiologic Causes of Feline Aggression earlier) Interspecies aggression (either fear induced or territorial/ resource guarding) \n\n\u2022 Hypervigilance, scanning \u2022 Increased motor activity (restlessness, pacing, circling) \u2022 Vocalization/whining \u2022 Displacement behaviors: out-of-context grooming and scratching, yawning, lip licking, whining and barking, destructive, digging \u2022 Changes in social soliciting behavior: increase or decrease in attention seeking \u2022 Hiding, escape attempts \u2022 Physiologic signs (trembling, dilated pupils, ptyalism, piloerection, \" respiratory rate, \" heart rate, urination, defecation, vomiting, anal sac expression) \u2022 Decreased appetite.\n\nSee Abdominal Effusions and Ascites.\n\nTypically, mild ataxia and other neurologic signs predominate.\n\nGeneralized disease: generalized ataxia \n\nLentigines-darkly pigmented macules that develop on the ventral abdomen of healthy adult dogs and on the lips, nose, gingiva, and eyelids of orange cats. No adverse health effects.\n\nCanine acanthosis nigricans-bilateral hyperpigmentation and lichenification of axillary skin. Primary, hereditary form seen in Dachshunds beginning before age 1. When seen in older Dachshunds or other breeds, it is likely a postinflammatory form seen with friction, intertrigo, allergies, or endocrine disease. Acromelanism-dark areas on the points of Siamese, Himalayan-Persian, Balinese, and Burmese cats. Result of a temperature-dependent enzyme controlling melanin production in hair bulbs.\n\nPostinflammatory-Mediators of inflammation (e.g., leukotrienes, thromboxanes) stimulate melanocytes to increase melanin production, which down-regulates inflammation by scavenging free radicles. Examples of inflammatory conditions that lead to increased melanin production include allergies, Malassezia dermatitis, bacterial pyoderma, dermatophytosis, demodecosis, scabies, and actinic and intertrigo dermatitis. Inflammation affecting hair follicles may lead to melanotrichia (e.g., sebaceous adenitis, panniculitis, vaccine reactions). Endocrine-hyperadrenocorticism, hypoadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, hyperestrogenism, and other sex hormone imbalances may result in diffuse hyperpigmentation. Papillomavirus associated-Pugs may be at risk for development of papillomavirus-associated, slightly raised, scaly, hyperpigmented macules and plaques in their groin region, abdomen, ventral thorax, and neck. Similar lesions are described in Miniature Schnauzers, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Pomeranians. May transform to squamous cell carcinoma. Pigmented tumors-apocrine cysts are bluish, cutaneous hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas appear red, dark purple, or bluish-black Melanomas, melanocytomas, and basal cell tumors are frequently black. Squamous cell carcinomas, trichoblastomas, and fibromas also may be dark brown to black.\n\nExogenous pyrogens (infectious agents and their products, inflammation or necrosis of tissue, immune complexes, pharmacologic agents, bile acids) Endogenous pyrogens (fever-producing cytokines) Ch ediak-Higashi syndrome-rare autosomal-recessive disease of blue smoke Persian cats. Partial oculocutaneous albinism with abnormal function of granulocytes and platelets resulting in hemorrhage, recurrent infections, and death at a young age. Graying-age-associated reduction of melanocyte replication Vitiligo-macular leukoderma and leukotrichia of nose, ears, buccal mucosa, and facial skin. Antimelanocyte antibodies found in serum of some affected dogs. Seen most commonly in Siamese cats, Belgian Tervuren, German Shepherd, Collie, Rottweiler, Doberman Pinscher, Giant Schnauzer. Nasal hypopigmentation-season-associated lightening of nasal planum during winter months most common in Siberian Husky, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and Bernese Mountain Dog. Seen also in many other breeds. Mucocutaneous hypopigmentation-leukoderma of the nasal planum, lips, eyelids, tongue, and oral cavity. Many breeds of dogs, but more common in Australian Shepherds, Siberian Huskies, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers. Congenital condition in Rottweilers and Doberman Pinschers. Tyrosinase deficiency-rare condition in Chow Chows. Puppies show dramatic color change, bluish-black tongue turns pink, hair shafts turn white. Melanin reappears spontaneously in 2-4 months.\n\nPostinflammatory-DLE is the most common cause of postinflammatory nasal depigmentation. Also pemphigus complex, SLE, uveodermatologic syndrome, bullous pemphigoid, mucocutaneous pyoderma, drug eruption, and contact dermatitis. Infectious causes include leishmaniasis, blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, and bacterial folliculitis. Drug related-ketoconazole, procainamide, and vitamin E may cause diffuse coat lightening. Nutritional/metabolic-deficiencies of zinc, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, and lysine are associated with graying of hair. Dark hairs may become reddish in color with copper deficiency, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, hyperestrogenism, hyperprogesteronism, chlorine exposure, and chronic exposure to ultraviolet light. Neoplasia associated-nasal depigmentation, leukoderma, and leukotrichia sometimes seen with epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma, basal cell tumors, mammary adenocarcinoma, and gastric carcinomas. Idiopathic-leukotrichia and patchy hypopigmentation reported as idiopathic in Labrador Retrievers and black Newfoundlands. Siamese cats may be affected with periocular leukotrichia, which may be associated with upper respiratory tract infections, pregnancy, dietary deficiencies, or systemic illness. \n\nVasogenic (brain masses that lead to breakdown of blood-brain barrier) Cytotoxic (hypoxia, neuroglycopenia) Interstitial (hydrocephalus) \n\nSee Cachexia and Muscle Wasting."}
