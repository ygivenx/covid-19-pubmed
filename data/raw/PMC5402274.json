To this end, immature mo-DCs were cultured in the presence or absence of Pam3CSK4 or LPS and FhTE, and the production of different cytokines were evaluated in the culture medium. Although FhTE alone did not induce the expression of cytokines by mo-DCs, when cultured together with a maturation stimulus, it enhanced the production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs (Fig. 1A and B). Interestingly, this enhanced production of IL-10 was abrogated when FhTE glycans were oxidized with meta-periodate (FhmPox), a common method used to evaluate the biological activity of glycans (Fig. 1C)32. These results indicate that F. hepatica glycoconjugates mediate the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28 by mo-DCs.\n\nNext, we investigated whether parasite components are taken up by mo-DCs. To this end we studied the intracellular routing of FhTE components by imaging flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, the localization of labeled-FhTE molecules was intracellular and they co-localized at 15 minute-incubation period with early endosomal antigen (EEA-1) and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Uptake of labeled-FhTE to moDCs was also confirmed by flow cytometry and inhibited upon incubation with EGTA (Fig. 2B), suggesting the participation of a CLR in this process. Furthermore, FhTE-uptake to mo-DCs was inhibited with MR- and DC-SIGN-specific antibodies, while it was not modified when using anti-DCIR and anti-MGL antibodies (Fig. 2B). Finally, we evaluated the capacity of MR and DC-SIGN to recognize coated-FhTE using MR- and DC-SIGN-Fc constructions, confirming their participation in the recognition of glycans present in FhTE, which was inhibited with the chelating agent EGTA (Fig. 2C).\n\nGiven the capacity of MR and DC-SIGN to recognize and internalize FhTE we investigated whether these receptors mediated the enhanced production of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL27-p28 by mo-DCs stimulated with FhTE. Mo-DCs were incubated with FhTE and LPS in presence of MR-, DC-SIGN-, DCIR- and MGL-specific blocking antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, only the anti-DC-SIGN antibody was capable of restoring IL-10 levels produced by LPS-stimulated mo-DCs. In addition, the DC-SIGN blocking antibody also restored the levels of IL-27p28 (Fig. 3B) suggesting that DC-SIGN and not MR mediates the modulation triggered by FhTE together with a TLR ligand.\n\nSince DC-SIGN showed to participate both in the recognition of F. hepatica glycans and in the regulation of TLR-induced IL-10 and IL-27p28 production by DCs, we analyzed in detail the interaction between DC-SIGN and FhTE by imaging flow cytometry. Results on Fig. 4 demonstrate that labeled-FhTE interacted with DC-SIGN on the cell surface (Fig. 4A, time 0) and co-localized with DC-SIGN also at an early time-point (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly, after 15 minutes of incubation, co-localization of FhTE with both DC-SIGN and EEA1 was observed (shown by white arrows in Fig. 4A), but not with LAMP-1. These data suggest that DC-SIGN-mediated FhTE-uptake by mo-DCs could lead to the delivery of parasite glycoconjugates into early endosomes.\n\nIn order to characterize the nature of the carbohydrates recognized by DC-SIGN, we carried out two different approaches: binding inhibition with carbohydrates and treatment with exoglycosidases. The interaction between DC-SIGN-Fc and coated-FhTE was inhibited with incubation with EGTA, mannan and the DC-SIGN-specific blocking antibody, while no inhibition was detected with GalNAc or the isotype antibody control (Fig. 4D). Considering that DC-SIGN can recognize both mannosylated and fucosylated glycans, we further evaluated its binding to FhTE when treated with mannosidase, fucosidase, or both enzymes. Treatment of FhTE with any of these glycosidases inhibited DC-SIGN binding (40% inhibition), while treatment of FhTE with both fucosidase and mannosidase resulted in a 70% inhibition rate (Fig. 4D), indicating that DC-SIGN interacts with both fucosylated and mannosylated parasite glycans. GalNAc-ase treatment of FhTE was used as control, revealing no changes in DC-SIGN binding to FhTE as expected due to the lack of MGL binding observed in Fig. 2D.\n\nCharacterization of the N-glycan binding specificity of DC-SIGN has revealed that DC-SIGN may recognize complex-type N-linked glycans expressing Fuc\u03b11-3GlcNAc moieties and in lesser extent oligomannose-type N-glycans35. To determine the mannosylated and fucosylated N-glycan moietes present in FhTE that may act as DC-SIGN ligands, we characterized and quantified the parasite N-glycans by glycan nanoprofiling3637. Our analyses showed that the N-glycans present in FhTE contained mainly high mannose structures, with only few hybrid and complex glycans with terminal GlcNAc (Supplementary Fig. S1). These mannosylated structures constitute potential ligands for DC-SIGN. Alpha-1,6-fucosylated paucimannose glycans were also detected. However, since fucosylation was only identified in the common core structure unit (Supplementary Fig. S1), these structures would not represent potential ligands of DC-SIGN because it recognizes glycans that are terminally fucosylated such as LDNF, Lex and pseudo-Ley 3538.\n\nTo further investigate whether the immune modulation induced by FhTE on LPS-matured mo-DCs affected their T-cell stimulatory function we incubated FhTE-treated mo-DCs in presence or absence of LPS with allogeneic CD4+ T cells. Both T cell proliferation and the production of IFN\u03b3 were significantly reduced when LPS-stimulated mo-DCs were incubated in presence of FhTE (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the production of IFN\u03b3 was partially restored when using the anti-DC-SIGN blocking antibody, suggesting that FhTE regulates the stimulatory capacity of mo-DCs in a process mediated, at least in part, by DC-SIGN (Fig. 5B) and F. hepatica mannose-rich glycans.\n\nNext, we investigated the effect of FhTE exposure to DCs on T cell proliferation in a secondary MLR. CD4+ T cells exposed to DCs pulsed with FhTE showed decreased capacity to proliferate in response to a second stimulation with fully activated DCs (Fig. 6C). This was interpreted as the induction of anergic T cells or T reg cells during the primary MLR. Interestingly, the induction of anergic or regulatory T cells by FhTE-stimulated mo-DCs was mediated by DC-SIGN, since the incubation with the DC-SIGN-specific blocking antibody restored the T cell proliferation (Fig. 6D). These findings illustrate that mannose glycans on FhTE that interact to DC-SIGN on DCs can induce tolerance under inflammatory conditions through the induction of IL-10 and T cells with suppressor capacity.\n\nThis study provides evidence that F. hepatica glycans modulate human DCs through DC-SIGN, favoring the induction of Tregs or cell anergy. In particular, we show that oligomannose glycans present on FhTE preparation enhance the TLR-induced production of IL-10 and IL-27p28. Although F. hepatica glycoconjugates were both recognized and internalized by MR and DC-SIGN on DCs, the observed immunomodulation of TLR-matured DCs was mediated only by DC-SIGN and not by MR, DCIR or MGL, suggesting a main role of this receptor in the DC-immunoregulatory properties induced by this helminth. DC-SIGN interacts with a wide range of pathogens of major impact on public health, including viruses456, bacteria830 and parasites11121314 via both fucose (for instance in Lewis and sulfo-Lewis structures) and high-mannose glycans in a Ca-dependent manner39. However, until now, DC-SIGN interaction with helminths was reported only via fucosylated glycans and not high-mannose structures1440. Oligomannose and paucimannose N-glycans present in FhTE could constitute ligands for DC-SIGN through mannose. Our results demonstrate the capacity of DC-SIGN to recognize mannosylated glycoconjugates on F. hepatica components, since the binding of DC-SIGN to FhTE was partially abolished after mannosidase treatment. In addition, we also confirm that DCs interact with helminth fucosylated-glycans via DC-SIGN. Considering that we did not identify potential fucosylated N-glycans that could serve as ligands for DC-SIGN, and together with the fact that defucosylation of FhTE reduces DC-SIGN recognition for parasite components, we propose that DC-SIGN fucosylated ligands are present in O-glycans or glycolipids. Of note, since FhTE is a total parasite lysate, it contains both external and internal glycoconjugates. Thus, to establish the role of DC-SIGN during F. hepatica infection, in vivo studies are necessary.\n\nF. hepatica evades host immunity by different mechanisms, including immunomodulation of DC maturation and function273032, resulting in. altered Th2 polarization and inducing tolerogenic/regulatory properties28. We have previously reported the expression of IL-10 by semi-matured DCs from F. hepatica infected animals32, indicating that the parasite is able to immune-regulate DCs during infection. We now demonstrate that F. hepatica glycans can immunomodulate TLR-induced maturation of human DCs in a DC-SIGN-dependent process. Thus, DC-SIGN interacts with F. hepatica glycans and mediates the increased production of IL-10 and IL-27p28 by TLR-matured DCs. IL-10 is a key immune-regulatory cytokine that can impair the proliferation, cytokine production and migratory capacities of effector T cells41 or induce T cell anergy42. On the other hand, IL-27 can both exert immuno-stimulatory or suppressive effects. Interestingly, IL-27 can induce IL-10 production and induce the differentiation of the IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells43. In agreement with our results, fucose-induced triggering of DC-SIGN resulted in the induction of IL-27p28 expression and secretion by DCs, driving subsequent follicullar T helper polarization7. Furthermore, this type of phenotype on DCs is induced by other helminths, such as S. mansoni1444, suggesting that fucosylated glycans present on FhTE would trigger DC-SIGN-signaling. In addition, our results indicate that DC-SIGN recognizes next to fucosylated glycans also mannosylated glycans, which can both be present in parasites, that may have a different functional consequence increasing IL-10 and T regs. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether both glycan moieties in F. hepatica glycans trigger different DC-SIGN signaling pathways.\n\nCLR-triggering has been correlated with regulatory T cell differentiation in different pathological contexts44. In particular, DC-SIGN can favor Th1/Th17, Th2, follicular T helper or regulatory T cell polarization44. To further understand whether F. hepatica-triggering of DC-SIGN on DCs can alter T cell activation, we evaluated whether TLR-matured DC conditioned with parasite components were able to limit T cell proliferation. Our results indicate that human DC-SIGN promotes a tolerogenic/regulatory state on DCs since F. hepatica-conditioned DCs induced regulatory mo-DCs via DC-SIGN that decrease allogeneic T cell proliferation by the induction of induction of T-cell tolerance. On the other hand, the interaction of myelin oligodendrocyte glycprotein (MOG) with DC-SIGN in the context of simultaneous TLR4 activation resulted in enhanced IL-10 secretion and decreased T cell proliferation21. Furthermore, H. pylori glycans that interact with DC-SIGN induced tolerogenic DCs that failed to induce T cell effector functions but induced regulatory T cells45. In the context of F. hepatica immunoregulatory properties, other CLRs can also participate in the induction of T cell anergy as has been recently proposed for the MR on bone marrow-derived DCs induced anergic-like T cells via DCs, although only a small reduction of T cell anergy was found when using DCs from knock-out mice, suggesting that other CLRs can participate in this process33. Furthermore, this process did not seem to be mediated by recognition of parasite glycoconjugates by the MR on BMDCs but the MR interacting with CD4+ T cells33. Thus, our work provides an additional mechanism of induction of T cell anergy induced by F. hepatica-conditioned DCs.\n\nIn conclusion, our work demonstrates that F. hepatica fucosylated and mannosylated glycoconjugates are recognized by DC-SIGN, which in turn triggers a tolerogenic program on TLR-matured DCs in presence of parasite glycosylated molecules characterized by the increased production of IL-10 and IL-27 and confer DCs with the capacity to induce regulatory/anergic T cells (Fig. 6). These results highlight the biological role of glycans in the immune evasion mechanisms triggered by helminths.\n\nHuman monocytes were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors in accordance with guidelines and regulations of the Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Informed consent was given by all donors for the use of their blood samples. Adult worms were collected during the routine work of a local abattoir (Frigor\u00edfico Carrasco) in Montevideo (Uruguay). Protocols were approved by the Uruguayan Committee on Animal Research (Comisi\u00f3n Honoraria de Experimentaci\u00f3n Animal, Uruguay) or by the Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, Netherlands).\n\nLive adult worms of F. hepatica were obtained from the bile ducts of bovine livers, washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, then mechanically disrupted and sonicated. After centrifugation at 40,000 \u00d7 g for 60 min supernatants were collected and dialyzed against PBS. The obtained total lysate (FhTE) was quantified and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Carbohydrate glycol groups present in FhTE were oxidized with sodium periodate (10 mM). The oxidation was performed at room temperature for 45 min in the dark, followed by the reduction with sodium borohydride (50 mM) of the reactive aldehyde groups. The resulting oxidized lysate is referred as FhmPox. In order to perform control experiments, the following control extracts were prepared: FhCB, consisted of FhTE subjected to the whole treatment excepting for the incubation with sodium periodate; and CmPox, consisting of PBS subjected to the entire treatment. Lysates were dialyzed against PBS and their protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The endotoxin levels were determined by using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate kit Pyrochrome (Associates of Cape Cod). Protein preparations showed very low levels of endotoxins and were not able to induce DC-maturation (as IL-12 read out) on their own. mo-DCs incubated with the control CmPox produced the same levels of cytokines in the culture supernatant as mo-DCs cultured in medium alone.\n\nMonocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from buffy coats of healthy donors (Sanquin, The Netherlands) by a lymphoprep gradient (Axis-Shield, San Diego, CA) and subsequent percoll gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare Life Science, Netherlands). Informed consent was obtained from all blood donors for the use of their blook samples. DCs were generated by culturing purified monocytes in complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Netherlands) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 1000 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza, Netherlands), and 2 mM glutamine (Lonza, Netherlands) in combination with IL-4 (262.5 U/ml; Biosource, Belgium) and GM-CSF (112.5 U/ml; Biosource, Belgium) for 4\u20137 days.\n\nFor DC-maturation assays, moDCs (2 \u00d7 105/well) were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in 96-well plates with plate-bound FhTE, FhmPox or FhCB (125 \u03bcg/ml) in the presence or absence of Pam2CysK4 (TLR2, 10 \u03bcg/ml). When appropriate, DCs were pre-incubated for 2 hrs at 37 \u00b0C with the blocking anti-DC-SIGN (AZD-N1), -DCIR (111F8.04,), MR (19.2), -MGL (1G6.6), antibodies. IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were determined by specific ELISAs (eBiosciences, CA or BioSource, Belgium) after overnight incubation. Alternatively, IL-10, IL-27p28, IL-29EBI3 and IL-35 were determined by quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after a stimulation of 6 hrs.\n\nFhTE/LPS-stimulated mo-DCs were washed and incubated for 6 days with allogeneic naive CD4+CD45+ T cells that were previously purified by negative selection (Invitrogen). Primed T cells were recovered, washed, and allowed to rest for 3 d in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15 (ImmunoTools). After 9 d of the primary stimulation, primed T cells were washed and restimulated by co-culturing them with LPS-activated moDC from the original donor at different ratios. After 6 d, plates were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 \u03bcCi/well; GE Healthcare) for an additional 18 h and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured on a Betaplate 1205 liquid scintillation counter (Wallac-LKB).\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from DC cultures, by use of Tri-reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Real-time PCR were set up using the SYBR Green method in an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system as previously described46. Supplementary Table 1 shows a list with the primers used.\n\nNUNC maxisorb plates (Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with FhTE (125 \u03bcg/ml) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA in TSM (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM MgCl2), and 1 \u03bcg/ml of different hCLR-Fc in TSM were added for 2 h at room temperature. Specific binding was blocked through the pre-incubation of hCLR-Fc with the Ca2+-chelator EGTA (10 mM). For hMGL-Fc, the specific binding was blocked with free GalNAc (100 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) or blocking anti-hMGL antibody (1G6.6, 10 \u03bcg/ml), by pre-incubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Binding was detected using a peroxidase-labeled, anti-human IgG-Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA). Binding was visualized with 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate (Sigma Aldrich) and optical density was measured by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. When indicated, FhTE was pretreated with the following exoglycosidases: \u03b1-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase from chicken liver, \u03b1(1-2,3,4,6)-Fucosidase from bovine kidney or \u03b1(1-2,3,6)-Manosidase from jack bean (all Prozyme, CA), as indicated in manufacturer\u2019s instructions. When the treatment was done with both Fucosidase and Mannosidase at the same time, a buffer sodium acetate 50 mM pH 5 was used.\n\nThe internalization and binding of FhTE to mo-DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, mo-DCs (1 \u00d7 105/well) were incubated with Alexa 647-labeled FhTE for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in complete medium (to assess uptake), or at 4 \u00b0C in complete medium (to assess binding). Cells were then washed twice and the binding or internalization by CD11c+ cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nMo-DCs were incubated with Alexa647-labeled FhTE for up to 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in complete medium, fixed and permeabilized. Then, they were stained with a DC-SIGN- (clone DCN46), LAMP-1- (clone H4A3) and EEA1- (clone 14/EEA1)-specific antibodies (from BD Biosciences) and analyzed by imaging FACS. Mo-DCs were acquired on the ImageStreamX (Amnis Corp.) as previously described. A minimum of 15,000 cells was acquired per sample at a flow rate ranging between 50 and 100 cells/s.\n\nThe identification of N-glycans present in FhTE was performed as previously described3637. Briefly, 0,5 mg of FhTE was freeze dried, dissolved in 100 \u03bcL of buffer 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.5, containing 7 M urea, 2 M tiourea, 2% SDS, 1 M \u03bc-mercaptoetanol and sonicated during one hour. Then 100 \u03bcL of buffer 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.5 containing 15% of Igepal CA-630 was added to neutralize the inhibitory effect of SDS on PNGase-F activity and was sonicated for another 15 min. Finally, 800 \u03bcL of 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.5 and 10 U of PNGase F were added and the mixture was incubated for at least 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. The purification of glycan structures was performed using PGC SPE columns of porous activated charcoal and the remaining detergent was removed by incubation with detergent out beads. Purified N-glycans were derivatized with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) via reductive amination in the reducing end. Briefly the oligosaccharides were mixed with 2 mg of AMC and 2 mg of reducing agent picoline borane, after thoroughly vortexing the mixture was incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 2 hours. Separation, quantification and characterization of glycans were performed using a 2D-LC-MS system with an intercalated nano-Fluorescence detector. As first dimension a capillary WAX trap column is used to trap the charged oligosaccharides species. Unbound neutral oligosaccharides were trapped onto a C18 trap column (300 \u03bcM \u00d7 10 mm, Dionex The Netherlands) and analyzed on a long reverse phase nano-LC column (5 \u03bc, 75 \u03bcM \u00d7 3000 mm, prepared in-house). Glycan species were quantified based on fluorescence and structures were identified base on the information obtained from the MS/MS fragmentation pattern. Subsequently WAX bound charged species were eluted with 500 mM ammonium formate and trapped onto the C18 trap column and analyzed as mentioned above.\n\nResults were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (non-parametric Friedman test and Dunn\u2019s post-test) or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferrroni Multiple Comparison test using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results were considered to be significantly different when p < 0.05.\n\nHow to cite this article: Rodr\u00edguez, E. et al.
