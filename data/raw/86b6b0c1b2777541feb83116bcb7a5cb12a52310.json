{"title": "Comparative analysis of primer-probe sets for the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2", "body": "Firstly informed to World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID- 19) involves 78,811 confirmed cases over 28 countries as of 23 February 2020 [1] . The majority of COVID-19 patients had pneumonia and showed symptoms include fever and cough [2, 3] . The genome sequence of causative novel coronavirus was shared through Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform from 12 January 2020. The sequences of novel coronavirus (CoV) showed close similarity to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and the virus uses ACE2 as the entry receptor like SARS-CoV [4] [5] [6] . The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated the virus as SARS-CoV-2 [7] .\n\nMolecular diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently carried out by one-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) targetting SARS-CoV-2 by which primers and probes being suggested by institutes of China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and USA were posted through WHO [8] [9] [10] . Clinical diagnosis methods including CT scan are also utilized to identify COVID-19 cases in Hubei province, China, from 13 February 2020 [11] . Although qRT-PCR assay served as a gold-standard method to detect respiratory infectious viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [12] [13] [14] [15] , current qRT-PCR assays targetting SARS-CoV-2 have some caveats. First, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV, primer-probe sets would cross-react. Second, the sensitivity of the assays may not enough to confirm suspicious patients in early time points after admission. Indeed, cases of positive CT scan results and negative RT-PCR results at initial presentation were reported [16] . The performance of molecular diagnosis might be dependent on primers, probes, and reagents. There have been no comparative results of the current qRT-PCR analysis for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn this present study, the qRT-PCR analysis was performed with previously reported primer-probe sets targeting RdRp/Orf1 and N region of SARS-CoV-2. This is the first comparative analysis of various primer-probe sets for the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Seven of the ten sets were derived from the N gene, and the other three sets were derived from Orf1 gene (RdRp, ORF 1b-Nsp14, and ORF 1-Nsp10). All DNA oligonucleotides were resuspended in nuclease-free water before use.\n\nThe infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory. African green monkey kidney Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were infected with a clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020 provided from Korea CDC). After 72 h, the culture medium containing mature infectious virions (virus medium) was collected and viral RNA was isolated from the culture medium using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein, which cloned in pET21a plasmid was PCR amplified with T7 promoter primer (5' -AATACGACTCACTATAG -3', Macrogen Inc., South Korea) and T7 terminator primer (5' -GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG -3', Macrogen) with AccuPower\u00ae PCR PreMix (-dye) kit (Bioneer Inc., South Korea). PCR product was then used as in vitro transcription template using MEGAscript\u2122 T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen Inc., CA, USA). The copy number of in vitro transcribed RNA was calculated from .

Standardized amounts of in vitro produced RNA were used E primer and qRT-PCR to produce a standard curve.\n\nExtracted nucleic acid samples were tested for comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The Orf1 and N region of SARS-CoV-2 were used as the target sequences for SARS-CoV-2 specific gene. Briefly, 10 \u03bcL of purified viral RNA was amplified in a 20 \u03bcL reaction solution containing 1X 1 step RT-PCR mix (WELLS BIO INC., South Korea), and 300 nM of primers and probes for the target detection. The qRT-PCR was performed with a CFX 96 touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The qRT-PCR conditions applied in this study were programmed as follows: UNG incubation, RT incubation, and enzyme activation were serially performed at 25 \u00b0C for 2 minutes, at 55 \u00b0C for 10 minutes, at 94 \u00b0C for 3 minutes respectively. Thermal cycling was then performed at 94 \u00b0C for 15 seconds (denaturation), and at 60 \u00b0C for 30 seconds (annealing and amplification) for forty-five cycles.\n\n.

The standard curve from E gene primer-probe set also showed the reaction was done accordingly. The R 2 value of the standard curve was 0.999 and the calculated amplification efficiency was 101.6%. These indicated that the qRT-PCR reaction was done in optimal condition. The viral concentration of supernatant and cell lysate was determined by E gene-based assay ( Table 2) .\n\nThe Ct value of RdRp_SARSr (Germany), HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) from low concentration (15 copies/reaction) were 43.00, 38.97, and 36.85, respectively ( Table 2) \n\nVarious primer-probe sets were previously reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 by the qRT-PCR assay. The sensitivity of the assay may not enough to confirm suspicious patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nNevertheless, there have been no comparative results of the current qRT-PCR analysis for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, the first comparative analysis of various primer-probe sets targeting RdRp/Orf1 and N region of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by qRT-PCR for the laboratory confirmation. In the case of targeting RdRp/Orf1 region, ORF1ab (China) set might be the most sensitive than other sets. 2019-nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets may be recommended for the sensitive qRT-PCR assay of N region. Therefore, the appropriate combination from ORF1ab (China), 2019-nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets should be selected for the sensitive and reliable laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nWe appreciated to National Culture Collection for Pathogen of Korea CDC for providing clinical SARS- "}
