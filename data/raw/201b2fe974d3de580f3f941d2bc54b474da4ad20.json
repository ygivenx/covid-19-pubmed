{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Do children need a longer time to shed SARS-CoV-2 in stool than adults?", "body": "According to recent guidelines published in China [1] , most of the infected individuals were discharged after showing significant improvements in respiratory symptoms, a stable body temperature for more than 3 days, and two negative nucleic acid quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) nasal and throat swabs.\n\nHowever, in Jinan, we found that 8 of 27 (29.6%) patients, all of whom were diagnosed with mild to moderate infection and discharged 1-2 weeks ago, showed positive PCR results in their stool but negative results in their respiratory specimens. Interestingly, six (75%) of these eight patients were children. In addition, the families of these children \n\nSix children (cases 1-6) and two adults (cases 7-8) showed positive results in their stool after discharge (Table 1 ). Table 1 with over 85% identity [2] . Moreover, the epidemiological and biological characteristics of these viruses are relatively similar. When SARS broke out in China, researchers found that the virus could survive in feces for over 96 hours [3] . Similarly, studies on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that live viral strains could be isolated from feces, thus indicating the potential infectiousness of this body waste [4] . Further research found that different specimens express different results at different stages of the disease. For example, a report indicated that specimens obtained from the respiratory tract are more likely to yield viral RNA in the early stages of illness than other specimens. However, this likelihood gradually decreased after the first week of onset. The same report further found that stool specimens are 100% positive on the third week after onset and 30% positive 29 days later [5] . Recent data from China revealed that sputum shows the highest positive RT-PCR rates. Viral nucleic acids could be positively detected in 10% of the patients' blood samples at the acute period and in 50% of the patients' feces [4] . These studies infer that live viruses and viral nucleic acids could be detected in stool. Moreover, compared with respiratory specimens, stool specimens may remain positive longer, similar to the findings of the present study.\n\nNext, we sought to determine why the shedding time of the virus in feces is longer in children than in adults.\n\nOne reason that can explain why the shedding time of the virus in feces is longer in children than in adults is that the former often have poorer hand hygiene practices than the latter. Poor hygiene can cause contamination of the gastrointestinal tract by repeated touching with hands containing the virus or its fragments. For example, we described earlier the case of a boy who showed no symptoms after close contact with his father and had repeated negative results for all of his airway specimens. However, the stool results of this same boy were positive 3 weeks after contact.\n\nSecond, when SARS broke out in 2003, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was confirmed to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Interestingly, subsequent findings indicated that 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 as an entry receptor [6] . Previous studies demonstrated that ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lungs and small intestine [7] and, especially, in proximal and distal enterocytes.\n\nAnimal studies have also shown that ACE2 has different distributions in the lung in different genders and ages and that ACE2 expression in rat lung decreases with age [8] . Therefore, we believe that the expression of ACE2 in the intestine of children may differ from that of adults; this difference may explain why children have a longer viral shedding period than adults.\n\nThird, children often cough weakly but they are prone to silent aspiration. Thus, virus in the sputum or saliva may enter the gastrointestinal tract through swallowing, which could explain why children shed virus in their stool.\n\nAlthough a positive PCR result cannot confirm the presence of live viruses, because of the novel nature of this new virus and disease and the fact that studies have confirmed that SARS can be transmitted through aerosols [9] , treating nucleic acid-positive PCR results in stool as evidence of continued infection would be prudent. Because children show less susceptibility to SARS-CoV [10] and have milder symptom than adults, No financial support relevant to this article was provided.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest:\n\nAll authors report no conflicts of interest relevant to this article."}
