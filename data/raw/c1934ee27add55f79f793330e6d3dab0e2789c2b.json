The disease is caused by trypanosomes belonging to the subgenus Trypanozoon namely Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. T. b. rhodesiense causes disease in eastern, central and southern parts of Africa, while T. b. gambiense occurs in west and central Africa, extending from Angola to southern Sudan and Senegal. Other parasites of the sub-genus Trypanozoon are Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma evansi which cause diseases in livestock. However, a human case of T. evansi infection was recently reported in India (WHO, 2005; Truc et al., 2006) , highlighting the need to develop definitive diagnostic tests for trypanosomes in humans.\n\nControl of sleeping sickness relies on detection of the parasite and effective treatment of the patient. Routine diagnosis of the disease is based on direct visualisation of the parasite in blood, lymph node aspirates and CSF using a microscope (Van Meirvenne, 1999) . This method has limited sensitivity due to fluctuating parasitaemia. In efforts to improve detection of trypanosomes, a number of diagnostic methods have been developed, including the mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAECT; Lumsden et al., 1979) , PCR (Welburn et al., 2001; Gibson et al., 2002; Radwanska et al., 2002; Jamonneau et al., 2003) and recently, a dipstick test (Deborggraeve et al., 2006) has been evaluated. Despite these advances, diagnosis of HAT remains unsatisfactory. The PCR-based tests have good sensitivity. However, the need for precision instruments and elaborate visualisation methods are obstacles to their wide application in clinical settings in Africa. Consequently, diagnosis of HAT involves a combination of parameters, such as origin of the patient, symptoms, demonstration of parasites by microscopy, or detection of specific antibodies using the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT; Magnus et al., 1978) . The paucity of definitive tests means that some patients go undetected and therefore become potential sources of infection to other people.\n\nEarly diagnosis of HAT is important in interrupting the transmission cycle of the parasite and progress of the disease to the late stage. Treatment of patients with late-stage disease, when parasites have invaded the CNS, is difficult due to the cost and long treatment schedules, which normally require hospital admission. Melarsoprol, the only drug that is effective for the late-stage T. b. rhodesiense form of disease, causes a post-treatment reactive encephalopathy in an estimated 10% of patients, half of which are fatal (P\u00e9pin and Milord, 1994; Kennedy, 2004) . Modification of treatment regimes has not reduced mortality (Schmid et al., 2004) and treatment failure has been reported in the field (Legros et al., 1999; Matovu et al., 2001) . Treatment of early stage HAT is much easier and safer, although some side effects have been reported when pentamidine or suramin are used . Definitive diagnostic tests are therefore crucial for the early detection of cases. This would minimise false positives, and exposure of patients to drugs that are potentially danger-ous (Inojosa et al., 2006) , and whose efficacy may not be guaranteed.\n\nRecently a rapid, simple and sensitive technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA was developed by Notomi et al. (2000) . LAMP is a novel strategy for gene amplification which relies on the autocycling strand displacement synthesis of DNA by Bst DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions (60-65\u00b0C). The technique uses a set of six primers recognising eight sections of the target DNA (Nagamine et al., 2002) . This increases amplification specificity, efficiency and rapidity. Moreover, the technique amplifies target DNA three-fold every half cycle, producing large amounts of product within 30-60 min (Notomi et al., 2000) . The large amount of DNA formed allows visual detection of amplification through the addition of fluorescent dyes such as SYBR Green I (Poon et al., 2006) or Calcein (Boehme et al., 2007) and measurement of turbidity (Mori et al., 2001) . LAMP has been used successfully in detection of human infectious agents for severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Hong et al., 2004) , periodontis (Yoshida et al., 2005) , malaria (Poon et al., 2006) , peptic ulcers (Minami et al., 2006) and tuberculosis (Boehme et al., 2007) . Further, Kuboki et al. (2003) demonstrated the potential of LAMP based on a single copy target (PFRA gene) for the detection of several T. brucei sp. More recently Thekisoe et al. (2007) have reported LAMP tests for T. evansi, Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma congolense and T. b. gambiense. The LAMP test is attractive for diagnosis of HAT in sub-Saharan Africa where facilities are minimal, due to its speed, independence of specialised heating systems and results that can be visually inspected.\n\nThe availability of the sequenced genomes of several species of trypanosomes has provided information about genes that could be targeted as diagnostic markers. One of the targets is a non-autonomous retro-element, the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME; Hasan et al., 1984) . The RIME gene is ubiquitous, specific to the subgenus Trypanozoon (Wuyts et al., 1994; Tilley et al., 2003) and constitutes the most common mobile element in the T. brucei genome with approximately 500 copies per haploid genome (Bhattacharya et al., 2002) . In the present study, we have used the conserved region in the RIME gene to develop a sensitive and specific LAMP test for the subgenus Trypanozoon. The test was evaluated and compared with PCR using Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples.\n\nInstitutional Ethical Clearance for the collection of human samples was obtained from the Livestock Health Research Institute (LIRI) Tororo, Uganda, and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST), Kampala. The use of mice was approved by Murdoch University.\n\nA total of 59 T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense isolates were used in this study (Table 1) . They were isolated from humans, hyenas, tsetse flies, pigs and a dog between 1968 and 2005 in west, east, central and southern parts of Africa. Ten T. b. brucei and five T. evansi isolates were included in the analysis. Trypanosomes were amplified in laboratory mice and DNA prepared using either the published method (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) or the standard extraction commercial kits (Table 1) . Stored infected mouse blood containing T. b. rhodesiense isolate ATCC 30027 was adjusted to achieve 1.0 \u00b7 10 6 trypanosomes/ml, then 10-fold dilutions were prepared. One portion was used for DNA extraction and the other boiled for supernatant.\n\nTwenty archived human blood, CSF and serum samples collected between 1991 and 2007 from HAT patients in Uganda were used. Upon isolation, each sample was divided into two portions. The first portion was inoculated into mice and the second was processed for DNA either using a Sigma Genomic DNA extraction kit (St. Louis, MO USA) (JE samples) or using Gentra DNA purification Kit (Minneapolis, MN USA) (OM samples) ( Table 2 ). In Tanzania, the blood was divided into two portions. The first portion was centrifuged and buffy coat collected. In the second portion, 15 ll of blood was mixed with 40 ll of ultra pure water (PCR grade) (Fisher Biotec), boiled for 3 min, centrifuged at 20,800g for 10 min and 10-15 ll of supernatant collected. CSF samples were boiled and centrifuged prior to addition into the reaction mixture while serum was added directly. Ten blood, CSF and serum samples from non-infected humans were used to check LAMP specificity. Two to 4 ll of supernatant was used in each LAMP reaction.\n\nPrimers RIME 1, 5 0 GTTCCCACCCCGTTGGCG and RIME 2, 5 0 CGTGGGCGCCCAGCCGTG were designed from the genetic databank sequence (Genbank Accession No. K01801) and used to amplify RIME monomer from members of the sub-genus Trypanozoon. After electrophoresis, a single band of $500 bp was excised and purified with a DNA purification kit (MO BIO Lab, Solana, USA). The products were cloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Australia) and transformed in Escherichia coli cells. Plasmid purification was performed using a miniprep column kit (Qiagen, Australia) and the target product sequenced using both M13 forward and reverse primers in an ABI automatic DNA 3730 analyser (Applied Biosystems). The resulting sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. EF567424 for T. b. brucei; EF567425 for T. evansi and EF567226 for T. b. rhodesiense) were used to design six LAMP primers targeting eight conserved regions within the RIME sequence. The outer forward primer (F3), outer backward primer (B3), forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP) (Notomi et al., 2000) were designed using PrimerExplorer v3 software (http:/primerexplorer.jp/lamp) while the loop forward (LF) and backward (LB) (Nagamine et al., 2002) primers were manually designed ( Table 3 ). The forward and backward primers were designed such that the restriction enzyme NdeI cuts in between primer F1c and B1 (Yamada et al., 2006) .\n\nLAMP reactions of 25 ll were standardised for optimal reagent concentrations, temperature and time using T. b. rhodesiense isolate LVH 56 and T. b. gambiense isolate B014, following the Taguchi design (Cobb and Clarkson, 1994) . Briefly, the FIP and BIP were varied from 0.8 to 2.4 lM, deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) from 100 to 400 lM, betaine from 0.2 to 0.8 M and MgSO 4 from 0 to 4 mM. The reactions were optimised at 2.0 lM for each FIP and BIP primer, 0.8 lM for each loop primer (LF and LB), 0.2 lM for each of the F3 and B3 outer primers, 200 lM for each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.8 M betaine (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo, USA), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.8), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1% Triton X-100 and 8 U of BstDNA polymerase large fragment (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). For real-time reactions 3.34 lM SYTO-9 fluorescence dye (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) was added. The template was 1 ll [$10 pg] for trypanosome DNA and 2-4 ll of processed supernatant, CSF and native serum. The LAMP test was carried out for 1 h at 58, 60, 62 and 64\u00b0C using the Rotor-Gene 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) or in a water bath, and terminated by increasing the temperature to 80\u00b0C for 4 min.\n\nAmplification of DNA in the LAMP reaction was monitored through electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide, direct visual inspection after addition of 1 ll of 1/10 dilution of SYBR Green I (Invitrogen, Australia), and by monitoring SYTO-9 dye fluorescence in the Rotor-Gene 3000. Real-time fluorescence data was obtained on the FAM channel (excitation at 470 nm and detection at 510 nm) as described by Monis et al. (2005) . To confirm that the LAMP amplified the correct target: (i) the product was digested with specific restriction enzyme NdeI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) which cuts between primers F1c and B1, (ii) melt curves were obtained and analysed as described by Monis et al. (2005) , and (iii) a single LAMP band was cloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Australia), transformed into E. coliand sequenced. The resulting sequence was compared with target sequences using the DNAman software version 5.0 (Lynnon Biosoft, Canada). \n\nTo determine the analytical sensitivity of the LAMP test, 10-fold dilutions were made from $100 ng of DNA purified from T. b. rhodesiense isolate LVH 56 and T. b. gambiense isolate B014. The assay was carried out using both cold and pre-heated templates ( Table 4 ). The LAMP test was compared with PCR tests specific for the Trypanozoon sub-genus (Masiga et al., 1992; Wuyts et al., 1994; Tilley et al., 2003) . Specificity of the test was determined with approximately 1 ng of DNA from human, tsetse fly, bovine, camel, Plasmodium falciparum and trypanosomes belonging to subgenus Nannomonas(T. congolense savannah, T. congolense kilifi, T. congolense forest, Trypanosoma simiae, T. simiae tsavo, Trypanosoma godfreyi), T. vivax and Trypanosoma lewisi.\n\nOptimum results were obtained when the reaction temperature was maintained at 62\u00b0C. All positive LAMP reactions produced a characteristic ladder of multiple bands on an agarose gel, indicating that stem-loop DNA with inverted repeats was formed (Notomi et al., 2000) . The developed LAMP test was reproducible in laboratories in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and no false positives were observed. Upon addition of SYBR Green I to the reaction products, all positive reactions turned green while the negative ones remained orange (Fig. 1) . No colour change was recorded with non-infected human samples (blood, CSF or serum). Digestion of LAMP product with NdeI restriction enzyme gave the predicted sizes of 89 and 134 bp. The melting curves for RIME LAMP amplification of T. b. rhodesiense human samples JE8, TMRS10S and T. b. gambiense samples OM64, OM51 (Table 2 ) produced a single peak at 84.5\u00b0C, suggesting amplicons of the same sequence (Fig. 2) . The analysis of five clones obtained showed 100% identity with the target sequence, and revealed that the length varied with sequence repeats of primers F1c, F2, LFc, F1, B1c, LB, B2c, B1 and the sequence between F1c and B1 (Yamada et al., 2006) .\n\nTen-fold serial dilutions of genomic DNA from T. b. rhodesiense, T. b. gambiense and supernatant prepared from infected mouse blood containing 1.0 \u00b7 10 6 trypanosomes/ml of isolate ATCC 30027 were used to determine the lower detection limit for the LAMP assay at 62\u00b0C. The RIME primer set without loop primers had a detection limit of 10 \u00c04 dilution ($100 trypanosomes/ml). In contrast, the RIME reaction with loop primers had a detection limit of 10 \u00c09 dilution ($0.001 trypanosomes/ml) for T. b. rhodesiense, T. b. gambiense and ATCC 30027 (Table 4) . Amplification was detectable within 20-30 min for the test with loop primers, however the optimal time was set at 35 min to allow for very low DNA concentrations. A 10fold increase in sensitivity was obtained when pre-heated templates (DNA and supernatant) were used. We observed inhibition of the LAMP reaction with DNA concentrations of P200 ng. The RIME LAMP results were identical when either a Rotorgene 3000 thermocycler or a water bath was The JE samples were processed using a Sigma Genomic DNA extraction kit, USA. TMRS samples were processed using a Qiagen DNA extraction kit, Australia. a Ten picograms were used for each sample and the reactions were performed in triplicate and repeated after 2 weeks. b Wendy Gibson, University of Bristol, UK.

The DNA was prepared using Qiagen DNA extraction kit, Australia. used to heat the reaction mixture. In all cases RIME LAMP showed a lower detection limit than PCR ( Table  4 ). The RIME LAMP assay was specific and no reactivity was recorded with non-target DNA from other trypanosomes, hosts, vectors or P. faciparum.\n\nRIME LAMP detected all 75 Trypanozoon isolates analysed (Table 5 ). The TBR primers detected 52/59 (88.1%) of T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense isolates while the SRA gene-specific PCR test (Gibson et al., 2002) detected 21/46 T. b. rhodesiense isolates. The TgsGP PCR (Radwanska et al., 2002) failed to detect two T. b. gambiense isolates (Table 5) .\n\nThe results of the analysis of 20 archived human samples are shown in Table 2 . The RIME LAMP assay detected all T. b. rhodesiense in blood, CSF supernatant and unprocessed serum, while it failed to detect two samples of T. b. gambiense DNA. There was 100% agreement in LAMP test replicates. The TBR PCR only detected 5/18 samples while specific PCR tests gave negative results. The RIME LAMP assay was specific and no amplification was recorded with DNA or supernatant prepared from CSF and blood of non-infected humans.\n\nHuman African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) often presents non-specific clinical symptoms. Diagnosis is even more complicated as the disease progresses, since the clinical symptoms can mimic those of other diseases that are common in the endemic areas (Atouguia and Kennedy, 2000) . Patients normally consult a health professional when the disease is advanced and irreversible brain damage has probably occurred (Robays et al., 2004) . Development of a sensitive and reliable test for HAT is therefore a priority for early treatment and implementation of appropriate control measures. Furthermore, a test that is rapid and can give results at the point of care, would be ideal in the expansive and remote endemic areas of Africa. In the present study, we have demonstrated the use of LAMP technology in diagnosis of HAT using laboratory propagated isolates, as well as clinical samples. The RIME LAMP test that we have developed is rapid, and results are obtained within 35 min using a normal water bath to maintain the temperature at 62\u00b0C. The analytical sensitivity was the equivalent of 0.001 trypanosomes/ml, indicating that it would be possible to detect very low parasitaemias in patients.\n\nLAMP has inherent characteristics that make it advantageous as a diagnostic test for the rural endemic regions in Africa: (i) the Bst enzyme is active at relatively high temperatures (60-65\u00b0C), reducing the prospect for non-specific priming, (ii) using six primers that recognise eight targets increases sensitivity and specificity (Nagamine et al., 2002) , and (iii) the ability to read results visually eliminates the need for gel electrophoresis. In our hands, the RIME LAMP test could amplify DNA from clinical samples within 20-30 min. However, we optimised the tests for 35 min to ensure detection of DNA at very low concentrations. Purified DNA at P200 ng ($2.0 \u00b7 10 6 trypanosomes/ml) had an inhibitory effect on LAMP reaction as monitored in real time, and showed very weak bands on the agarose gel. It is, however, unlikely that such a high concentration of DNA would be found in a human host. The DNA concentrations in the 10 \u00c07 to 10 \u00c05 dilutions ($0.1 to 10 trypanosomes/ml) gave the best results (efficient reaction in real time). Using the same dilutions, we observed an optimum concentration of P10 pg ($100 trypanosomes/ml) for LAMP tests based on maxicircle COX-1 and 18S genes, with detection limits below 10 \u00c07 (results not shown), a factor that is probably associated with the number of copies of each gene. In their studies to detect Trypanozoon sub-genus, Kuboki et al. (2003) used a lowcopy gene (PFRA) and four primers. Their detection limit was 1 pg (10 trypanosomes/ml), observations that were also confirmed in this study (Table 4 ). In the RIME LAMP test, we have used a target that is a multicopy gene and six primers, which may explain the higher sensitivity.\n\nThe robustness of RIME LAMP was further demonstrated when various templates were used. Heat-treated blood, serum and CSF supernatants were sufficient for amplification. Further, LAMP amplified DNA using 1-4 ll of largely native sera and buffy coat with no inhibitory effects in a 25 ll reaction. The ability to use heat-treated Table 3 Nucleotide sequences for the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) primers\n\nType Sequence (5 0 -3 0 ) Length Amplicon size a Target   RIME-F3  F3  CTGTCCGGTGATGTGGAAC  19  179  RIME  RIME-B3 B3 CGTGCCTTCGTGAGAGTTTC 20 RIME-FIP FIP (F1c + F2) GGAATACAGCAGATGGGGCGAGGCCAATTGGCATCTTTGGGA 42 RIME-BIP BIP (B1c + B2) AAGGGAGACTCTGCCACAGTCGTCAGCCATCACCGTAGAGC 41 RIME-LF LF GCCTCCCACCCTGGACTC 18 RIME-LB LB AGACCGATAGCATCTCAG 18 a F3 and B3 primers are only used for the initial strand displacement and are not involved in subsequent LAMP reaction (Notomi et al., 2000) . Therefore the length between F2 and B2 is 179 bp. However, after amplification, the uppermost amplified amplicon size is 223 bp as the FIP and BIP primers consist of F1c = 22 bp and B1c = 22 bp sequences, respectively. samples without compromising sensitivity eliminates the need for DNA extraction, and further shortens the LAMP reaction. Other studies have shown superior tolerance of LAMP for biological substances (Enomoto et al., 2005; Kaneko et al., 2007; Yamada et al., 2006) , and heat-treated blood has been used successfully in the detection of malaria (Poon et al., 2006) . During LAMP reactions, DNA separation is achieved through destabilisation of the DNA helix by betaine (Notomi et al., 2000) . The increase in sensitivity associated with pre-heating of the template could therefore be due to faster DNA strand separation, translating into a more efficient LAMP test. Since HAT LAMP tests appear to be amiable to several templates, further work is needed in selecting and streamlining the best protocols for template preparation.\n\nComparisons of methods for detection of amplicons, including the addition of SYBR Green I, gel electrophoresis (ladder-like appearance) and real time monitoring, gave the same results, confirming the specificity of the three methods. The combination of SYBR Green I with the double-stranded DNA (amplicon) initiates a colour change from orange to green (Iwamoto et al., 2003) . This colour change is rapid and eliminates the need to use ethidium bromide, which is potentially mutagenic, to visualise the products. In three laboratories (each in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania), it was possible to process a template, perform the LAMP test and read results for 10 samples in 1 h, while the procedures for PCR took up to 4 h, excluding the time required for DNA isolation. The efficiency of amplification in a LAMP reaction is higher than that of PCR because there is no loss of time in the thermal change, since the reactions occur at a constant temperature. The test was reproducible in the field and no false positives were observed. Further, the usefulness of this assay was confirmed by its ability to detect both T. b. rhodesiense and Table 4 Analytical sensitivity of the repetitive insertion mobile element loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RIME LAMP) assay compared with other Trypanozoon ($1.0 \u00b7 10 5 tryps/ml), 10 \u00c02 ($1.0 \u00b7 10 4 tryps/ml) and 10 \u00c09 dilution ($0.001 tryp/ml).\n\nb Detection limit for ATCC 30027 DNA and cold templates. T. b. gambiense directly from archived human blood and CSF samples ( Table 2 ). The superior sensitivity demonstrated by detection of infections below the limits of other molecular techniques reported to date and negative results for P. falciparum, a co-endemic parasite in sub-saharan Africa, favours adaptation of the assay.\n\nThere is no current consensus on the diagnostic criteria for CNS involvement in HAT (Kennedy, 2007) . Demonstration of trypanosomes in the CSF is the clearest indicator that CNS invasion has occurred. However this is always difficult to determine as the number of parasites in CSF is persistently low, leading to use of indirect and inconsistent markers such as white blood cell counts (WHO, 1998) . Demonstration of CNS involvement is critical as it forms the grounds for the therapeutic choice, either early-or late-stage drugs. Some novel molecular tests such as proteomic signature analysis (Papadopoulos et al., 2004 ) and a PCR test (Jamonneau et al., 2003) have shown sensitivity and specificity of P96%, however their adaptability in the endemic region is still a challenge. The high sensitivity and specificity of the RIME LAMP test recorded in this study and its ability to detect parasite DNA in the CSF samples (Table 2 ) could prove useful in confirming the presence or absence of parasites after treatment.\n\nAn equivocal confirmation that the LAMP test amplifies the target sequence is essential when the test is being developed. This is because LAMP yields a range of product sizes that appear as a ladder on agarose gels, unlike in PCR (Masiga et al., 1992) . b T. b. rhodesiense PCR (Gibson et al., 2002) . c T. b. gambiense PCR (Radwanska et al., 2002) . d T. b. brucei Maxicircle COX-1 PCR (Njiru et al., 2006 ). e T. evansi PCR (Masiga and Gibson, 1990) . f The resulting amplicon was detected using SYTO-9 fluorescence dye in a real-time thermocycler; visual observation after the addition of SYBR Green I and by gel electrophoresis. g Trypanosoma congolense clade, Trypanosoma simiae clade, Trypanosoma godfreyi, Trypanosoma lewisi and Trypanosoma vivax. h Human, bovine, camel and tsetse fly.\n\nwhere a characteristic single band size is observed. Furthermore, the test kit should be developed with a focus on reading colour change, to limit post-reaction DNA manipulations. In the present study, amplification of the target sequence was confirmed with specific restriction enzyme digestion using NdeI, melting curves (Fig. 2) , and unequivocally through sequence analysis. Since the technique uses six primers, higher specificity and sensitivity were achieved. Real time analysis forms an important component in diagnostic test development, since it allows the monitoring of the test instantaneously. It was possible to monitor the LAMP amplification, obtain the melt curves and cut-off point through monitoring fluorescence of the double-stranded DNA intercalating dye -SYTO-9. To our knowledge this is the first time that SYTO-9 has been used in LAMP studies. The data obtained was reproducible, robust and consistent. The SYTO-9 dye has an advantage over other intercalating dyes in that it has a less inhibitory effect, shows a broader working range of dye concentration and does not selectively bind to amplicons (Monis et al., 2005) . This wider working flexibility makes SYTO-9 an effective option in LAMP studies.\n\nIn summary, this study shows that the RIME LAMP test is robust and has great potential as a test that can be deployed easily in endemic countries. The emerging information suggests: (i) that pre-heating of the template prior to its addition into the reaction mixture increases the test sensitivity by 10-fold, (ii) that amplification can easily be achieved using unprocessed template (buffy coat, supernatant and native serum) without inhibition or compromising RIME LAMP sensitivity and (iii) that a normal water bath is sufficient to reproduce results in endemic countries. This study provides direct evidence that addition of loop primers to the RIME LAMP test increased the test sensitivity and efficiency to a new level. It is apparent that a RIME LAMP test is promising as a diagnostic test and may be used as a back up to other tests in active or passive screening for HAT in endemic areas where diagnostic equipment are minimal. Determination and optimisation of protocols for processing the template to make the assay more userfriendly is a crucial next step. The data presented in this study will not only form an excellent comparator for further LAMP studies but will be useful towards development of a HAT test kit."}
