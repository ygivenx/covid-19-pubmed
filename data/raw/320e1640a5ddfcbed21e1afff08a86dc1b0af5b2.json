{"title": "Cardiovascular Considerations for Patients, Health Care Workers, and Health Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic", "body": "First appearing in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus disease of 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) (1, 2) . Given the rapid spread of this virus with consequences on an international scale, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health\n\nOrganization on March 11 th 2020 (2) . It is imperative that health care workers and researchers across all disciplines be aware of the potential impact that this disease can have on their respective fields and the medical community at large (3) .\n\nBased on currently observed disease patterns, cardiovascular (CV) specialists will be actively engaged in the care of patients with COVID-19. The infection may directly impact cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) may predispose to COVID-19 infection. Those with CVD who are infected by the virus have an elevated risk of adverse outcomes; and infection, itself, is associated with cardiovascular complications (4) (5) (6) . Moreover, COVID-19 infection may also have numerous indirect effects relevant to CV health. The large numbers of infected people requiring care may impact optimal treatment delivery to patients with acute CV conditions. Therapeutics for COVID-19 have the potential for adverse CV effects and clinicians delivering CV care are at risk of developing the illness or become vectors for the infection. The objective of this review is to characterize the CV impact of COVID-19, its potential consequences in patients with established CVD, as well as considerations for individual patients (with and without COVID- 19) , health care workers, and health systems, as understanding and addressing these issues will be crucial to optimize outcomes during the current critical period and beyond.\n\nGiven the time-sensitive nature of the challenges associated with this outbreak, we reviewed the published literature (including multiple search strategies in MEDLINE with PubMed interface) and\n\ncritically assessed early reports on medRxiv, a pre-print server (https://www.medrxiv.org/) (date of last search: March 16, 2020) . Since the initial epicenter for this outbreak was from China, the majority of data on patients with COVID-19 are from this region. Although a systematic attempt was made to include reports and viewpoints from other heavily affected countries, data related to CV risk factors or presentation were limited. This is important, since the testing strategies, care seeking behavior, and hospitalization thresholds vary in different settings and can bias numerators and denominators, influencing estimates of the impact of the virus. This selection bias in testing, care and reporting can lead to differences in prevalence estimates of pre-existing risk factors and patient presentation across the reports from various countries. Further, the majority of the existing analyses, including those related to CV complications of COVID-19 are based on retrospective and often single-center series. Accordingly, data elements were usually reported via chart review, without external prospective ascertainment. No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials were present in this literature search. These issues have important implications for research priority setting, and for interpretations of the results reported herein. There is an urgent need for high quality research in this area, but at this point it is useful to review the available data.\n\nSARS-CoV2, like other members of the Coronaviridae family, is an enveloped virus with nonsegmented, single stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (1, 7) . A number of SARS-related coronaviruses have been discovered in bats, and a working theory is that bats may have been the initial zoonotic host for SARS-CoV2 given that its genome is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus (8) . Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 as well as other coronaviruses can use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for cell entry. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein which serves many important physiologic functions. It is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells, providing the main entry site for the virus into human hosts (8, 9) . After ligand binding, SARS-CoV2 enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis in a manner akin to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (10) . ACE2 also serves a role in lung protection and therefore viral binding to this receptor deregulates a lung protective pathway, contributing to viral pathogenicity (11) . Figure 1 depicts the potential mechanisms for ACE2 with regard to viral pathogenicity and lung protection, as well as the potential effects on this from renin-angiotensinaldosterone inhibition as noted in the section on Drug Therapy and COVID-19 below.\n\nSince initial identification, the disease has spread to over 100 countries across the world (1). As of March 16, 2020 at 11:53AM, there have been a total of 174,961 COVID-19 cases reported globally (3, 813 in the United States) associated with 6,705 deaths thus far (69 in the United States), resulting in a crude case-fatality rate of 3.8% (12, 13) . Johns Hopkins University is making current data available:\n\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 (12) . The infectivity of COVID-19 is greater than that of influenza, with an estimated R 0 value (the basic reproduction number, representing viral infectivity) of 2.28 (14) . Notably, the death rate associated with COVID-19 is also considerably higher compared with the most recent WHO estimate of seasonal influenza mortality rate of less than 0.1%, and may reach much higher rates in elderly patients, those with comorbidities, and absent efficient intensive care support (13) . While other zoonotic coronaviruses, including the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), had higher associated case fatality rates of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively (15), COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined, an issue that is in part related to the greater infectivity and higher attack rate of this virus, leading to a larger number of infected patients (15, 16) . Uncertain and inconsistent disease ascertainment have resulted in variability in reported case fatality rates for several reasons, including: 1) the disease may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a large proportion of patients (15) , 2) inadequate testing capabilities in most geographies, leading to frequent underdiagnosis, especially in patients with less serious illness, and 3) complications and death often ensue much later than contagion (typically between 2 and 3 weeks after infection). Notably, the appraisal of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be further complicated by asymptomatic infection in a sizable portion of individuals (as many as 20%), which may significantly contribute to further spread of infection (17) The (18), although knowledge of the clinical feature of the disease is evolving daily (1, 19) . In severe cases, COVID-19 may present as pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with or without both distributive and cardiogenic shock, to which elderly populations with preexisting medical comorbidities are the most vulnerable (1, 6, 19, 20) . Notably while rates of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacterial superinfections in preliminary data appear low (15) , patients with the most severe clinical presentations are likely still at risk for co-infections, and unsurprisingly, worse outcomes have been noted in such cases (20, 21) . Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear to be less susceptible to severe disease, possibly due to stronger innate immunity, fewer comorbidities, differences in maturation of viral receptors, and/or prior exposure to other coronavirus species (22) . However, moderate-to-severe illness has been described in children as well (23) . Moreover, it is not clear how often children were being tested.\n\nSince an extremely large and increasing number of patients have been diagnosed with COVID-19, identification of prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality are crucial. To date, no approved preventative vaccines or approved therapies are available for COVID-19, although several are being actively studied (24) .\n\nThe lack of widespread testing, national surveillance and standardized data collection, as well as the potential sampling bias in sicker, hospitalized patients with more comorbidities such as CVD has complicated efforts to accurately estimate the prevalence of CVD in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, there is marked variation in testing by country. A number of studies in the available literature suggest an association between preexisting CVD and severe COVID-19, which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . A meta-analysis of six studies inclusive of 1,527 patients with COVID-19 examined the prevalence of CVD and reported the prevalence of hypertension, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes to be 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively (4). Patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission were more likely to have these comorbidities compared to non-ICU patients. Increased case-fatality rates in the previously referenced analysis of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China were noted in patients with CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), hypertension (6.0%), all notably higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% (15) . Several smaller cohort studies have yielded similar results suggesting higher risk for adverse events in patients with CVD who contract COVID-19, although biases related to testing and standardized data apply here as well (1, 19, (25) (26) (27) (28) . Notably, while reports outside of China are limited, data from Italy suggest similar mortality rates and an elevated risk for death in patients with comorbidities (29) . As emerging international data become available, analysis from multinational cohorts can help inform risk stratification for severe disease especially for patients with prior CVD.\n\nMechanisms that lead to CVD are increasingly recognized to overlap with pathways that regulate immune function. For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) . Additional study is needed to understand the potential mechanistic relationships between CVD and COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nIn addition to the mechanisms by which COVID-19 can affect patients with CVD risk factors, it is also important to consider COVID-19 in the context of an especially vulnerable group of patients, such as individuals awaiting or post heart transplantation. There are now case reports of COVID-19 infection among heart transplant patients (38, 39) .Two heart transplant patients in China, one with mild and one with severe disease, presented with symptoms typical of COVID-19 disease. Both were managed by withholding baseline immunosuppressive regimens and treating aggressively with high dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antibiotics, and both survived without evidence of allograft rejection.\n\nPrevious viral outbreaks have noted particularly severe infection in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients (40) . Formal treatment guidelines in these patients do not exist at this time. Heart allocation teams need to consider the optimal screening strategies in order to prevent severe infection in recipients including whether all donor hearts should be screened, given the existence of asymptomatic COVID-19, versus limiting screening to patients with a history of symptoms or exposure of COVID-19.\n\nDuring the H1N1 influenza pandemic, potential donors were screened if symptomatic or if they had significant exposure history in order to prevent infection in the recipient or as an impetus to initiate prophylaxis if the donor was positive (41) . Similarly, screening recipients for a history of symptoms or exposure of COVID-19 to avoid a post-transplant flare will be reasonable to be considered. Utmost precautions in infection control must be employed when interacting with these vulnerable immunosuppressed patients. \n\nMyocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, can occur due to myocardial ischemia or non-ischemic myocardial processes including myocarditis (6, 42, 43) . With severe respiratory infection and hypoxia, especially in the setting of severe infection and ARDS due to COVID-19, it is likely that a number of patients will develop such injury. Elevated serum troponin levels have been described in many patients infected with COVID-19, with significant differences noted between patients who died and those who survived to discharge (21, 44) . In a meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of 341 patients, standardized mean difference of cardiac troponin I levels were significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19 related illness compared to those with non-severe disease (25.6, 95% CI 6.8-44.5) (45) . Reports have also suggested that acute cardiac injury -which includes not only elevation of cardiac biomarkers to > 99 th percentile of the upper reference limit, but also electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities -is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with more severe disease and worse prognosis. Cohort studies from hospitalized patients in China estimate that such injury occurs in 7-17% of hospitalized patients with the disease (1, 6, 19) and is significantly more common in patients admitted to the ICU (22.2% vs. 2.0%, p<0.001) and among those who died (59% vs.\n\n1%, p<0.0001) (6, 8) . However, troponin levels can be exacerbated in patients with renal insufficiency due to delayed excretion, which is common in patients with advanced disease. Given limited high-quality data, and the heterogeneity of definitions across the studies, standardized data collection methods are recommended using the most recent Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) (43) .\n\nPrior studies in other coronavirus species (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated evidence of acute myocarditis using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (46) , and myocardial inflammation and damage have been reported with COVID-19 infection. Among 68 deaths in a case series of 150 patients with COVID-19, 7% were attributed to myocarditis with circulatory failure and in 33% of cases which myocarditis may have played a contributing role to the patient's demise (21) . Other reports have described fulminant myocarditis in the setting of high viral load with autopsy findings of inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate in myocardial tissue (26, 47, 48) . Pericardial involvement has not yet been reported but further study is needed. In addition, the extent to which supply and demand mismatch (Type 2 MI) in patients with underlying CVD have contributed to the CV manifestations of the syndrome is uncertain.\n\nCase reports of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (Type 1 MI) in the setting of COVID-19 have yet to be published. Nonetheless, the profound inflammatory response and hemodynamic changes associated with severe disease may confer risk for atherosclerotic plaque rupture in susceptible patients (6) . In this regard, analysis by Kwong (44, 52) .\n\nCardiomyopathy and heart failure. Zhou and colleagues reported that heart failure was observed in 23.0% of patients with COVID-19 presentations (6) . Notably, heart failure was more commonly observed than acute kidney injury in this cohort and was more common in patients who did not survive the hospitalization compared to those who did survive (51.9% vs. 11.7%). Whether heart failure is most commonly due to exacerbation of pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction versus new cardiomyopathy (either due to myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy) remains unclear (53) . Right heart failure and associated pulmonary hypertension should be also considered, in particular in the context of severe parenchymal lung disease and ARDS.\n\nCardiogenic and mixed shock. The predominant clinical presentation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory illness, which may lead to ARDS manifested as ground-glass opacities on chest imaging (54) and hypoxemia. However, similar features may be seen in the case of de novo or coexisting cardiogenic pulmonary edema. As such, it is important consider cardiogenic or mixed cardiac plus primary pulmonary causes of respiratory manifestations in COVID-19. Historically, right heart catherization was used to determine pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in order to aid in this distinction, although this has been removed from the Berlin criteria used for the diagnosis of ARDS. Rather, the Berlin criteria utilize timing of symptom onset, imaging with bilateral pulmonary opacities, and lack of volume overload to identify patients with ARDS (55) . In many cases, serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiography can help clarify the diagnosis (56, 57) . However, if these tests are unclear and there remains concern for mixed presentation, pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered in select cases to assess filling considered. The optimal thromboprophylactic regimen for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 related illness is not known. As such, contemporary guideline endorsed strategies should be observed (61) . Given the drug-drug interactions between some antiviral treatments and direct oral anticoagulants, low molecular weight heparins, or unfractionated heparin with or without mechanical prophylaxis are likely to be preferred in acutely ill hospitalized patients.\n\nData regarding antiviral therapies and other treatment strategies, as well as their potential interaction with CV medications and CV toxicities are summarized in Tables 3-5 Methylprednisolone is another drug under investigation that is currently being used to treat severe cases of COVID-19 that are complicated by ARDS (48) . This steroid is known to cause fluid retention, electrolyte derangement, and hypertension as direct CV effects, and also may interact with warfarin via an undescribed mechanism. Clinicians are advised to observe for these drug interactions.\n\nFinally, patient debilitation from severe COVID-19 may pose challenges in administering routine CV medications, ranging from antiplatelet therapy to beta-blockers, thus putting patients with or at risk of ischemic heart disease or heart failure at risk of further deterioration of their clinical condition.\n\nAs the ACE2 receptor is the mechanism of entry for SARS-CoV2, some data suggest that ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may upregulate ACE2, thereby increasing susceptibility to the virus ( Figure 1 ) (5) . In contrast other studies show that ACEi/ARB may potentiate the lung protective function of ACE2, which is an angiotensin II inhibitor (80) (81) (82) . Thus, the therapeutic implications for ACEi/ARB therapy during COVID-19 infection is unclear. Overall, there is insufficient data to suggest any mechanistic connections between ACEi/ARB therapy with contracting COVID-19 or with severity illness once infected.\n\nProtective equipment for CV health care workers. The Central Illustration demonstrates key considerations for treating patients in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early reports from the outbreak have suggested that transmission occurs most commonly via respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land on exposed mucous membranes or be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity and the virus may remain active on surfaces for several days (83) . While the CDC had previously recommended airborne precautions for the care of patients with COVID-19, this recommendation was recently changed such that only patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures require airborne isolation. Recommendations made by the WHO and CDC for personal protective equipment (PPE) are in agreement that standard, contact precautions with face mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves are necessary (51) .\n\nIn addition, when performing certain procedures that are aerosol-generating, such as healthcare workers (15) . This fact emphasizes the need for self-protection with PPE before caring for potentially exposed COVID-19 patients, and provides further rationale for delaying elective procedures.\n\nIn teaching hospitals, it is imperative to minimize exposure among trainees and non-essential staff (e.g.\n\nmedical students) not only for their own safety and that of their patients, but also for conservation of PPE, and for avoiding the unnecessary increase in the number of asymptomatic vectors. Finally, provider-toprovider transmission is also a major concern, especially in the setting of emergency or suboptimal logistics, or when devices for PPE have become scarce.\n\nThere are numerous considerations specific to the care of CV patients that should be taken into account in order to minimize risk for COVID-19 transmission to patients and healthcare workers, which are outlined in Table 7 . One important mechanism to help prevent transmission is the use of telemedicine. This technology, already utilized by numerous large health care systems around the world, is ideal in public health crises as it allows for patients to be triaged while minimizing exposure of patients and health care workers to potential infection. Additionally, telemedicine provides an opportunity for specialists that might not otherwise be available to evaluate patients. While there are currently barriers to the widespread implementation of telemedicine such as coordination of testing in patients triaged as high risk, this is a technology that will likely prove important to promote viral containment (86) . Other essential principles are to minimize non-essential/non-urgent in-person provider-patient interactions as much as possible (i.e. social distancing), and limiting elective cardiac catheterization, operating room and echocardiographic procedures. If such procedures are necessary, the number of required personal should be kept to a minimum. (38, 89) . These societies as well as a number of others agree that further data would be vital to inform decisions on adjusting regimens of these agents in the setting of this outbreak (38, (89) (90) (91) (92) . Moving forward, these important CV societies among other large physician groups and health systems will be critical allies to advance the knowledge generation and CV care in patients infected with this virus.\n\npackage of measures is required for hospital systems to fully prepare for COVID-19 (Table 5) Additionally, repurposing cardiac ICUs as medical ICUs for the care of patients with COVID-19 will likely become necessary, but may limit the quality of specialty care for CV patients. Given the need for ICU beds after cardiac surgery, medical management or percutaneous interventional approaches may need to be preferentially considered for urgent scenarios that cannot wait (e.g. percutaneous coronary intervention rather than coronary artery bypass graft surgery or transcatheter valve solutions rather than surgery) to minimize ICU bed utilization. Furthermore, as aforementioned, appropriate use and careful selection of ECMO-appropriate patients as well as having established ECMO protocols for COVID-19\n\npatients are important strategies to consider (58) .\n\nNeed for education. Information on the most up to date evidence surrounding management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 should be widely disseminated and freely available, and should be provided in illustrative formats (e.g. infographics) that improve public knowledge and understanding. The free flow of communication between healthcare workers and hospitals is paramount to effectively combat the pandemic. The care of patients with COVID-19 will require the expertise of many specialty services including pulmonology/critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, surgery, pharmacy, and hospital administration among others. Optimal infection control and treatment strategies for COVID-19 should be shared with the entire healthcare community. Accordingly, every effort must be made to provide clear and unambiguous information to patients and decision-makers, countering myths and false news which may generate panic or false optimism. As the evidence base surrounding COVID-19 and its management is evolving on a daily basis, the dissemination of accurate information must occur real-time.\n\nEthical challenges. The unprecedented challenge represented by COVID-19 has brought novel and dramatic ethical dilemmas, ranging from policy issues (e.g. focusing on containment and mitigation vs. herd immunity), as well as clinical dilemmas (e.g. considering all patients alike vs triaging patients according to age, comorbidities and expected prognosis, similar to other catastrophic circumstances).\n\nClose interaction between patient advocates, government officials and regulators, as well as physician groups, hospital administrators and other societal leaders will be essential to navigate these ethical challenges.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of patients and poses a major health threat on an international scale. The CV community will play a key role in the management and treatment of patients affected by this disease, and in addition in providing continuity of care to non-infected patients with underlying CVD. In the coming months, efforts towards evaluating new therapies will be crucial to the treatment of this virus, and as this process develops, further appreciation of the intricate interplay between COVID-19, CVD, and the various stakeholders involved including patients, health care workers, and health care systems will be crucial to improving outcomes in at-risk and infected patients. Prospective randomized clinical trials and cohort studies are ongoing and will be important to helping treat patients affected by this virus. ACE2 inhibits production of angiotensin II, which is a potent pro-inflammatory agent in the lung and leads to lung injury. RAAS blockers both directly inhibit production of angiotensin II and may also increase levels of ACE2, thereby indirectly inhibiting angiotensin II (bottom panel). Only a few studies, with single center experience have presented data to date, which limits the generalizability of the findings, and the confidence in the point estimates.\n\nThis study used multivariable modeling for outcome of death for each CV risk factor for CVD Table 5 summarizes specific recommendations in the setting of medication interactions.
