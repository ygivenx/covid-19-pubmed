{"title": "The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus VSV EBOV and Inhibits Ebola and VSV The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus", "body": "Pathogenic viruses have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to avoid or impair the host innate immune antiviral response (Unterholzner and Almine, 2019) , particularly by evading those pathways that result in type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling (Garcia-Sastre, 2017) . For example, Ebola virus (EBOV) relies on its structural protein VP35 to inhibit viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing by retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) (Cardenas et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2010; Luthra et al., 2013) and the IFN-inducible double-stranded (ds)RNA sensor protein kinase R (PKR) (Feng et al., 2007; Schumann et al., 2009) , thus avoiding the triggering and amplification of the host type I IFN response. The critical role played by VP35 in productive EBOV infection was underscored by the finding that mutations introduced into VP35 that disrupted its ability to sequester viral RNA intermediates, which did not affect its function in EBOV replication, resulted in increased type I IFN induction in vitro and severely attenuated viral growth in vivo in mice (Hartman et al., 2008) and guinea pigs . A host-directed therapy that could overcome this potent VP35-dependent EBOV immune evasion strategy would thus be particularly useful.\n\nNitazoxanide (NTZ) is an oral US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that has been used in millions of adults and children since 2004 with minimal adverse side effects for the treatment of Giardiaand Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea, including in patients co-infected with HIV (Doumbo et al., 1997; Hussar, 2004; Rossignol et al., 1998) . NTZ and its circulating metabolite tizoxanide (TIZ) have also been reported to inhibit a diverse array of viruses in tissue culture and in small animal models (Rossignol, 2014) . In humans, NTZ reduces symptom duration of uncomplicated influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014) , viral gastroenteritis (Rossignol and El-Gohary, 2006) , and rotaviral diarrhea . Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to NTZ's activity against specific viruses (Ashiru et al., 2014; La Frazia et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Piacentini et al., 2018; Rossignol et al., 2009b; Sekiba et al., 2018) , including studies showing enhancement or induction of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression by NTZ (Gekonge et al., 2015; Petersen et al., 2016; Trabattoni et al., 2016) and studies showing a weak association between NTZ and PKR activation (Ashiru et al., 2014; Elazar et al., 2009 ). However, no functional link between NTZ's antiviral activity and any specific ISG or with PKR has been demonstrated, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its broad-spectrum antiviral effects on host cells remain unknown.\n\nHere, we show that treatment of cells with NTZ results in broad amplification of the host innate immune response, including an increase in RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation in response to stimulation with cytoplasmic dsRNA, enhanced mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activities, and transcriptional induction of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. Based on these data, we hypothesized that NTZ could limit or overcome EBOV's ability to evade detection by critical innate immune sensors following viral entry. At concentrations reflective of routine oral dosing for parasitic infections, NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in A549 cells. Furthermore, using CRISPR/dead (d) Cas9-KRAB promoter targeting to ablate expression of individual host factors, we show that NTZ's inhibitory effect against EBOV relies on both RIG-I and PKR, indicating that NTZ can overcome EBOV VP35's ability to prevent viral detection by these cytoplasmic sensors. We also show that NTZ significantly inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through a distinct mechanism involving both RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with the different innate immune evasion strategies employed by VSV when compared with EBOV. Thus, NTZ establishes a broad ''antiviral'' milieu that is rapidly amplified upon viral infection and is capable of counteracting varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies, such as those employed by EBOV and VSV.\n\nWith no effective and easily deployable oral drug to treat or prevent infection, EBOV caused over 10,000 deaths in the 2014-2016 west African EBOV epidemic (Shiwani et al., 2017) and has claimed over 1,700 lives to date (as of July 21, 2019) in the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Claude et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2019) . Our demonstration that NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in vitro suggests that NTZ could have a potential role in the treatment of acute EBOV disease, prevention of EBOV infection in exposed healthy individuals, and eradication of EBOV reservoirs that persist in immune-privileged sites of patients who have been cured of EBOV disease (Deen et al., 2017) , and it provides impetus to test NTZ in animal models of EBOV infection to demonstrate in vivo efficacy.\n\nTo test whether NTZ enhances sensing by the RLR pathway, we overexpressed full-length RIG-I or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), the two major RLR proteins, in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that were co-transfected with an IFN-b promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid (IFN-b LUC). We then examined whether NTZ augmented IFN-b promoter activity in the presence or absence of a viral nucleic acid analog, the synthetic dsRNA poly I:C. NTZ pretreatment enhanced poly I:C-stimulated IFN-b promoter activity in RIG-I-( Figure 1A , left) and in MDA5-( Figure 1A , right) overexpressing cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1A ). In the case of MDA5 overexpression, NTZ's effect on IFN-b reporter gene activity was evident even in the absence of poly I:C treatment ( Figure 1A , right).\n\nRIG-I and MDA5 differentially recognize distinct viral RNA signatures (Kato et al., 2006) . RIG-I preferentially recognizes 5 0 triphosphosphorylated short dsRNA structures typically generated by negative-strand RNA viruses, whereas MDA5 recognizes longer dsRNA structures (Kato et al., 2008; Schlee et al., 2009) . To more precisely distinguish NTZ's effects on these RNA sensors, we next tested the effect of NTZ on a more specific RIG-I stimulus by using a short (42 bp) 5 0 phosphorylated synthetic dsRNA (1AB) (Peisley et al., 2013) . We found that IFN-b reporter activity was also significantly enhanced by NTZ in the RIG-I-overexpressing cells that were stimulated with 1AB ( Figure 1B, left panel) . Furthermore, endogenous IFN-b mRNA synthesis was significantly enhanced by NTZ pretreatment before 1AB stimulation of 293T cells ( Figure 1B , right panel).\n\nWe next tested the ability of NTZ pretreatment to activate IFN-b reporter gene activity in HEK293T cells cotransfected with a plasmid overexpressing MAVS, the adaptor protein through which RIG-I and MDA5 signal (Kawai et al., 2005; Meylan et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005) . IFN-b LUC activity was strongly enhanced by NTZ in MAVS-overexpressing cells even in the absence of any other cellular stimulation, reaching a >4-fold increase at a concentration of 10 mM NTZ ( Figure 1C ).\n\nIt has been reported that in addition to preventing IRF3 phosphorylation and activation by blocking RIG-I viral RNA sensing, EBOV VP35 also prevents IRF3 phosphorylation by directly blocking the access of the kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK-1 to unphosphorylated IRF3 (Prins et al., 2009) . To determine if NTZ can directly augment IRF3's activity, we next transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding phosphomimetic IRF3, which is able to drive IFN-b mRNA expression in the absence of proximal components of the RLR signaling pathway (Lin et al., 1998) . As shown in Figure 1D , NTZ enhanced IRF3-induced IFN-b reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we also found that NTZ enhanced type I IFN-induced transcription of the ISGs Mx1, IFI27, and IFITM3 ( Figure 1E ). Thus, NTZ broadly enhances signaling downstream of the RLR and IFN-b signaling pathways in addition to acting as an agonist for viral RNA sensors acting at the proximal part of the pathway in the cytoplasm.\n\nOur data that NTZ broadly enhances antiviral sensing via the cytoplasmic RLR pathway and amplifies type I IFN-induced gene expression, including IFITM3 gene synthesis, which has previously been shown to inhibit EBOV infection (Huang et al., 2011) , led us to speculate that NTZ may overcome EBOV's capacity to evade host RNA sensing and to skirt triggering of the type I IFN response (Basler et al., 2000 (Basler et al., , 2003 Cardenas et al., 2006; Hartman et al., 2008; Leung et al., 2010; Luthra et al., 2013) , thus favoring host control of the virus. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of NTZ to inhibit infectious EBOV growth in human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells in vitro under biosafety level 4 conditions using an isolate of infectious EBOV from the original 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kikwit). Cells were pretreated with 0, 20, or 40 mM NTZ, which is not toxic to A549 cells (see Figure 3A ), for 4 h, and were then infected with EBOV at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in Figure 2 , in vehicle-only treated cells, EBOV growth increased by over 1.5 log units by 72 h post-infection. By contrast, over the same time frame, EBOV growth was completely inhibited in cells treated with 20 or 40 mM of NTZ (p < 0.001), dropping 2.5 log units from the initial inoculum titer in the cells treated with 40 mM NTZ (p < 0.001). We note that 20 and 40 mM are concentrations of NTZ that are either well below or equivalent to peak plasma levels ($39 mM) of its active metabolite TIZ that are observed in humans who have ingested 500 mg of NTZ twice a day in a typical oral regimen for cryptosporidial diarrhea (Romark, 2017) .\n\nTo begin to characterize the mechanisms involved in NTZ's antiviral activity, we next tested NTZ's effect on a second RNA virus, the rhabdovirus VSV, which, like EBOV, is a member of the order Mononegavirales, and which also allowed testing under biosafety level 2 conditions. NTZ pretreatment of A549 cells for 4 h inhibited the growth of a firefly luciferase-expressing VSV (VSV-Luc) reporter virus (Cureton et al., 2012) in A549 cells, with greater than 99% inhibition of VSV-Luc achieved at an NTZ concentration of 12 mM and >99.9% inhibition obtained at 18 mM ( Figure 3A , left).\n\nGiven the importance of both RIG-I and PKR in EBOV's evasion of the host antiviral response (Cardenas et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2010; Luthra et al., 2013; Schumann et al., 2009) , and reports that NTZ can weakly induce auto-phosphorylation of PKR (Ashiru et al., 2014; Elazar et al., 2009) , we next sought to determine the role of these molecules in NTZ's antiviral activity using the VSV model system. Because traditional short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based methods of gene knockdown, including in A549 cells, are associated with both non-specific type I IFN induction by the shRNA itself, and reduced shRNA activity in response to type I IFN stimulation (Machitani et al., 2017) , we chose to knockdown RIG-I or PKR expression in A549 cells by targeting dead(d)Cas9-KRAB to their genes' promoters (see Transparent Methods and Figure S1 for gRNA target sequences and Figure 3B for protein knockdown efficiency). RIG-I depletion ( at any NTZ concentration tested (50% inhibition with 4.8 mM NTZ in CRISPR-Ctrl A549 cells versus 4.7 mM NTZ in CRISPR-PKR A549 cells) ( Figure 3D , right panel), indicating that NTZ's suppression of VSV replication is not dependent on PKR.\n\nThe phosphatase GADD34 selectively promotes IFN-b translation in the context of host global translational shutdown following PKR-dependent eIF2a phosphorylation or stress pathway activation (Dalet et al., 2017). NTZ has previously been shown to induce low levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ashiru et al., 2014) and to promote the translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (Elazar et al., 2009), which during translational inhibition is a transcriptional activator of GADD34 gene expression (Ma and Hendershot, 2003) . We thus investigated whether NTZ affected GADD34 expression. We treated A549 cells with increasing concentrations of NTZ for 4 h and measured GADD34 mRNA levels. NTZ strongly induced GADD34 mRNA synthesis in an NTZ concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3E ). We note that maximal GADD34 transcription was detected between 4 and 8 h post-NTZ stimulation of A549 cells (not shown).\n\nTo investigate whether GADD34 participates in NTZ's inhibitory effect on VSV, we knocked down GADD34 in A549 cells using the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB strategy described above (see Transparent Methods and Figures S1 and 3B) and infected these GADD34-depleted A549 cells ( Figure 3F , left panel) with the VSV-Luc reporter virus. GADD34 depletion resulted in a significant increase in VSV infection/growth ( Figure 3F , right panel, 0 mM NTZ data point), similar to previously reported findings with VSV and GADD34 \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Minami et al., 2007) . Furthermore, GADD34 depletion reduced VSV sensitivity to NTZ (50% inhibition at 4.8 mM NTZ in CRISPR-Ctrl A549 cells versus at 6.9 mM NTZ in GADD34-KD A549 cells) Figure 3 . NTZ Strongly Inhibits VSV Infection/Replication in A549 Cells: Depletion of RIG-I and GADD34, but Not PKR, Impairs Anti-VSV Activity of NTZ (A) Left panel: A549 cells were treated with NTZ at the indicated concentrations for 4 h and were then infected with a VSV firefly luciferase reporter (Cureton et al., 2012) . After 16 h, cells were harvested and firefly luciferase activity was measured by luminescence assay. Means and standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. Right panel: A549 cells were treated with vehicle or NTZ at the indicated concentrations for 18 h. Cells were harvested, exposed to 1 mM propidium iodide for 5 min, and subjected to flow cytometry. ( Figure 3F , right panel), indicating that NTZ's anti-VSV activity also depends on its ability to induce the expression of GADD34 in addition to its enhancement of RIG-I function. Taken together, although RIG-I, PKR, and GADD34, play a role in host inhibition of VSV, only RIG-I and GADD34, and not PKR, are involved in NTZ-mediated repression of this virus.\n\nWe next analyzed EBOV replication in the CRISPR/dCas9-RIG-I-KD, PKR-KD, and GADD34-KD A549 cells under biosafety level 4 conditions to determine the individual roles of these antiviral proteins in restricting EBOV growth. Both RIG-I and PKR depletion led to significantly increased EBOV Kikwit replication (Figure 4A) , with an increase of greater than a log unit by 72 h post-infection when compared with control cells ( Figure 4A , right). This experiment demonstrates the importance of both factors in host control of EBOV infection. By contrast, although GADD34 depletion resulted in higher EBOV titers at 48 h, it did not impact EBOV growth by 72 h post-infection ( Figure 4A, right) . Thus, unlike what we found with VSV, GADD34 plays a limited role in restricting EBOV growth in A549 cells.\n\nTo determine if RIG-I, PKR, or GADD34 were targets of NTZ and required for its inhibitory effects upon EBOV, we next pretreated the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB nonspecific control cells and the CRISPR/dCas9-RIG-I-KD, PKR-KD, or GADD34-KD A549 cell lines with 0 or 20 mM NTZ for 4 h and then infected with EBOV Kikwit at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in Figure 4B (left), there was a 10.5-fold reduction (>1 log change) A B Figure 4 . NTZ Requires PKR and RIG-I, but Not GADD34, for Full Inhibition of EBOV Replication in A549 Cells (A) Knockdown of RIG-I and PKR in A549 cells augments EBOV replication, whereas knockdown of GADD34 has a more modest effect on EBOV growth. Cells were mock-treated or treated with 20 mM NTZ for 4 h and infected with EBOV at MOI of 0.01 in the presence of pretreatment NTZ supernatants. Supernatants were harvested at 1, 48, or 72 h, clarified, and EBOV plaque-forming unit (PFU) was calculated by plaque assay. Titers are displayed on linear (left) and log (right) scales for clarity. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (B) Compared with control A549 cells, NTZ inhibition of EBOV replication is impaired in RIG-I-KD and PKR-KD A549 cells but is not affected by GADD34 knockdown. Cells were mock-treated or treated with 20 mM NTZ for 4 h and infected with EBOV at MOI of 0.01 in the presence of pretreatment NTZ supernatants. Supernatants were harvested at 1, 48, or 72 h, clarified, and EBOV PFU was calculated by plaque assay. Titers are displayed on linear (left) and log (right) scales for clarity.\n\nin NTZ's anti-EBOV activity in CRISPR/PKR-KD A549 cells by 72 h post-infection when compared with the CRISPR/Control A549 cells, indicating that PKR activity plays a critical role in NTZ's efficacy against EBOV. RIG-I depletion also resulted in an appreciable, although lesser, reduction in EBOV sensitivity to NTZ (2.7-fold) by 72 h post-infection ( Figure 4B ). By contrast, GADD34 depletion had little effect on NTZ's ability to inhibit EBOV growth ( Figure 4B ).\n\nHere, we have shown that the FDA-approved small molecule drug NTZ broadly amplifies cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways and strongly inhibits replication of EBOV and VSV. Our data indicate that NTZ's amplification of RIG-I and PKR activities overcomes EBOV VP35's ability to prevent the triggering of these critical host antiviral factors. By contrast, in the case of VSV, NTZ-mediated amplification of RIG-I signaling and induction of GADD34 expression, both contribute to the drug's anti-VSV activity. Thus, the wide array of innate immune activities that NTZ amplifies provides cells with the capacity to resist productive infection by diverse viruses like EBOV and VSV that engage distinct host evasion mechanisms.\n\nVP35 blocks RIG-I-driven type I IFN production and PKR activation by both sequestering dsRNA intermediates and binding to the PKR/RIG-I activator PACT (Bale et al., 2013; Cardenas et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2010; Luthra et al., 2013; Schumann et al., 2009) . Furthermore, mutations in the dsRNA-binding pocket of EBOV VP35 were found to increase type I IFN induction in vitro and severely attenuate viral growth in vivo (Hartman et al., 2008; Prins et al., 2010) . However, the relative importance of individual dsRNA-triggered cytoplasmic sensors for control of EBOV replication has not been clearly delineated. Our data here show that dCas9-KRAB-mediated knockdown of either RIG-I or PKR in A549 cells leads to a significant increase in EBOV replication ($1 log) after 72 h, directly demonstrating that both these host molecules contribute to control of EBOV growth. The fact that a wild-type clinical EBOV isolate with an intact VP35 as part of its genome is still susceptible to the effects of RIG-I and PKR underscores the critical roles played by both these factors in host control of EBOV. Furthermore, our data showing that NTZ's efficacy against EBOV is reduced when host cell expression of either PKR or RIG-I is ablated, indicates that the ability of NTZ to increase the activity of PKR and RIG-I at an early stage of EBOV infection, can tip the balance in favor of the host by blunting VP35's ability to suppress the innate immune response.\n\nNTZ also suppressed VSV replication, and its antiviral efficacy was markedly reduced upon depletion of RIG-I in A549 cells. However, unlike what we observed for EBOV, knockdown of PKR had no effect on NTZ inhibition of VSV. Furthermore, in the absence of NTZ, we found that knockdown of PKR resulted in a significant but milder increase in VSV growth relative to the robust increase in EBOV replication we observed when PKR expression was ablated. We note that the VSV matrix protein blocks host cell type I IFN responses independently of PKR by inhibiting global mRNA synthesis and nuclear export, as well as by inhibiting global host protein synthesis (Ahmed et al., 2003; Black and Lyles, 1992; Connor and Lyles, 2005; Ferran and Lucas-Lenard, 1997; von Kobbe et al., 2000) . The VSV matrix protein shuts down host cell translation primarily by inducing dephosphorylation of the eIF4F initiation complex component eIF4E Lyles, 2002, 2005) . However, eIF2a also becomes phosphorylated at later stages of VSV infection, leading to additional negative effects on host protein synthesis, including on type I IFN production, as well as on viral protein synthesis (Connor and Lyles, 2005) . Here, we have shown that NTZ induces transcription and translation of GADD34, which is a phosphatase that reverses eIF2a phosphorylation (Novoa et al., 2001) , and has been shown to be critical for restoring translation of IFN-b and other selected cytokines in virus-infected cells (Clavarino et al., 2012a (Clavarino et al., , 2012b Dalet et al., 2017) . Given that GADD34 depletion reduces NTZ activity against VSV, our data suggest that NTZ induction of GADD34 further amplifies NTZ-augmented RIG-I signaling, providing cells with the capacity to mount an innate immune response that is sufficient to overcome VSV matrix protein inhibitory effects upon protein synthesis.\n\nOur data also show that the activities of factors downstream of the RLRs are amplified by NTZ. Both overexpressed MAVS and constitutively phosphorylated IRF3 activities were amplified in response to NTZ stimulation, resulting in increased type I IFN promoter activity. NTZ also enhanced type I IFN-induced mRNA synthesis of ISGs Mx1, IFI27, and IFITM3. IFITM3 is a critical restriction factor for both EBOV (Huang et al., 2011) and VSV (Huang et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010) , and Mx1 has been shown to inhibit VSV infection (Staeheli and Pavlovic, 1991) . Thus, NTZ's ability to amplify both proximal and distal aspects of the viral RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways allows for a broad and effective antiviral response to develop in cells that are immediate viral targets and in neighboring cells yet to be infected.\n\nAlthough three previous reports have suggested that ISGs induced by NTZ or its metabolite TIZ play an antiviral role, a direct functional impact of NTZ or TIZ upon any of these genes with respect to inhibition of viral growth, has not been shown. For example, one report described increased average expression of a panel of 26 ISGs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with a very low concentration (0.1 mM) of NTZ for an unspecified time, with no functional demonstration of how any of these individual ISGs affected replication of a virus in NTZ-treated cells (Petersen et al., 2016) . Another article reported that treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) with NTZ for 48 h induced the expression of the ISGs tetherin and APOBEC3A/G, and although the authors associated this with NTZ inhibition of HIV in MDMs, no functional demonstration was provided showing that these molecules played any role in NTZ's anti-HIV activity (Gekonge et al., 2015) . A third study reported that TIZ treatment of human PBMCs for 7 days induced a set of 14 IFNs and ISGs approximately 2-fold when compared with untreated PBMCs, with a slightly greater increase, on average, observed in the context of HIV infection (including Mx1, 1.8to 2.9-fold respectively); however, again, no functional links between the ISGs identified and NTZ inhibition of HIV replication were made, and no mechanism for this response was investigated (Trabattoni et al., 2016) . In contrast to the above studies, through both biochemical and gene knockdown approaches we have demonstrated that NTZ treatment results in broad amplification of RLR pathway components that are primary drivers of type I IFN production and ISG induction and amplifies type I IFN signaling. Furthermore, we have functionally linked RIG-I and PKR to NTZ's antiviral activity against EBOV, and functionally linked RIG-I and GADD34 to NTZ's activity against VSV using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB-mediated knockdown of these molecules in host cells.\n\nIt has also been previously reported that NTZ induces phosphorylation of PKR in different cell lines. However, weak NTZ-induced PKR phosphorylation was only observed in one study after 72 h of 0.5 or 5 mM NTZ exposure in human hepatoma cells harboring an hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon (Elazar et al., 2009) , and after 24 h in a bovine kidney cell line with 25 mM, but not 10 mM, NTZ in another study (Ashiru et al., 2014) . Furthermore, in both reports, no direct functional link between putative PKR phosphorylation by NTZ and its antiviral activity was demonstrated, thus leaving unverified the functional importance of PKR, or its phosphorylation status, for NTZ's ability to suppress replication of PKR-sensitive viruses. By contrast, our demonstration that the effect of NTZ on EBOV growth is markedly impaired in cells where PKR expression has been ablated directly links NTZ pretreatment for 4 h before EBOV infection to PKR restriction of EBOV growth.\n\nSynthetic RLR agonists for the treatment of viruses have generated much interest (Yong and Luo, 2018) . However, because RLRs are expressed in most human tissues and the inflammatory response to their induction is highly variable person to person, there is concern that therapeutic approaches employing RNA agonists will be associated with unacceptable inflammatory side effects (Elion and Cook, 2018). Intriguingly, NTZ has been used extensively with an excellent safety profile in adults and children for treatment of parasitic infections (Doumbo et al., 1997; Hussar, 2004; Rossignol et al., 1998) , and for viral diseases such as HCV (Rossignol et al., 2008 (Rossignol et al., , 2009a and influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014) . Notably, our findings indicate that NTZ modulate the innate immune response after a pathogen has entered a susceptible target cell, when amplification of natural immune control of viral infection is needed. In the case of viruses like EBOV that employ immune evasion mechanisms to avoid triggering the innate immune response, such a therapeutic profile is attractive. Although identification of NTZ's upstream target is outside the scope of this article, we anticipate that these studies, which are underway, will be of great value in unraveling host pathways that lead to cell-intrinsic control of Ebola.\n\nFinally, the studies presented here suggest that after validation in an in vivo animal model, NTZ could be potentially useful in EBOV disease as monotherapy or as an adjuvant therapy with agents that specifically target EBOV components. Furthermore, NTZ may also prove valuable in strategies to prevent EBOV infection or to eradicate EBOV reservoirs that persist in patients who have survived EBOV disease.\n\nAlthough NTZ is FDA approved for the treatment of cryptosporidial diarrhea and is a well-tolerated medication, a limitation of the data presented here regarding NTZ's inhibition of EBOV is that it is based on in vitro studies and we have not yet established NTZ's efficacy against EBOV in an in vivo animal model. Furthermore, the detailed investigation of NTZ's upstream target in the regulation of the immune responses described here is outside the scope of this article and will be the subject of future studies, as will in vivo testing of NTZ against EBOV.\n\nAll methods can be found in the accompanying Transparent Methods supplemental file.\n\nSupplemental Information can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.07.003.\n\nWe are indebted to Wallis Annenberg and John Moores for their critical support making this study possible.

We also thank James LeDuc and James Hodge for their advice, Martin Dorf for the gift of the VSV luciferase reporter virus, Renate Hellmiss for the artwork, and James Falvo for critical reading of the manuscript. \n\nFor RNA-mediated stimulation of the RLR pathway, HEK 293Ts were maintained in 48-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Cellgro)\n\nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FBS). The next day, cells were transfected with 10 ng of pFLAG-CMV4 plasmid encoding RIG-I, MDA5, or an empty vector control (Ahmad et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2014) , together with 100 ng of IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Lipofectamine2000, Life Technologies). The medium was changed 4 hours post-transfection with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ. All experiments involving NTZ were performed in this manner in order to reduce the impact of serum proteins on NTZ's function in tissue culture, as NTZ is highly protein-bound (Stockis et al., 1996) . Four hours after addition of NTZ (Sigma), \n\nTo stably co-express dCas9-KRAB and a guide RNA specific to the promoters of the genes encoding i) PKR, ii) RIG-I, or iii) GADD34, a lentiviral vector was constructed that encoded an EFS promoter-driven dCas9-KRAB-2A-E2Crimson-2A-puroR cassette and a U6 promoter for gRNA transcription (see Supp. Fig. 1 ) based on similar approaches our laboratory has used previously (Chow et al., 2014) . Individual gRNA sequences were obtained from the CRISPR design program at crispr.mit.edu and are shown in Supplemental Figure 1 , along with the sites in the individual gene promoters that they target. As a control, a lentiviral vector encoding a U6 promoter-driven scrambled gRNA that does not match any genomic sequence was also constructed (designated CRISPRcontrol).\n\nTo generate A549 cells with stable knock down of specific genes, cells were transduced with the control or gene-specific lentiviruses, and positively transduced cells were selected with 2 \u00b5g/ml puromycin for 3 weeks as described previously (Chow et al., 2014) . Efficacy of the knockdowns was then evaluated by analyzing gene expression following mock stimulation or stimulation with 100 ng/ml human IFN-\u03b2 for 4 hours for the CRISPR-control, CRISPR-RIG-I, and CRISPR-PKR cells, or with 40 \u00b5M NTZ for 8 hours for the CRISPR-control and CRISPR-GADD34 cells. RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using anchored oligoDT priming and cDNA was measured using standard qPCR methodology and normalized to the housekeeping gene cyclophilin B\n\nwith the primers shown in the legend of Fig. 3 .\n\nThe CRISPR A549 cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 complete media and \n\nTo assess the ability of NTZ treatment to inhibit replication of authentic EBOV in A549 cells, we infected cells in duplicate with the Zaire ebolavirus Kikwit strain (EBOV). After 1 hour in DMEM+1%FBS cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M or 40 \u00b5M NTZ for 4 hours before EBOV infection. After the 4-hour pre-treatment, the supernatants from the NTZ-treated cells were removed and then used to make up the EBOV inocula per condition. Cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01, which was rocked at 37\u00b0C for one hour. The inocula were left on the cells and had fresh media containing 20 \u00b5M or 40 \u00b5M NTZ added. Supernatants were collected at 1, 48, and 72 hours post infection and analyzed for production of infectious virus by plaque assay analysis.\n\nThe A549 cells with CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB-based knock down of: i) PKR, ii) RIG-I, or iii) GADD34 were used to assess the mechanism of NTZ EBOV inhibition through these genes. For this analysis, we infected cells in duplicate with the Zaire ebolavirus Kikwit strain (EBOV). After 1 hour in DMEM+1%FBS cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M NTZ for 4 hours before EBOV infection. After the 4-hour pre-treatment, the supernatants from the NTZ-treated cells were removed and then used to make up the EBOV inocula per condition. Cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01, which was rocked at 37\u00b0C for one hour. The inocula were left on the cells and had fresh media containing 20 \u00b5M NTZ added. Supernatants were collected at 1, 48, and 72 hours post infection and analyzed for production of infectious virus by plaque assay analysis.\n\nVirus titration was performed on Vero E6 cells from all supernatants collected.\n\nIncreasing ten-fold dilutions of each sample were adsorbed to the cell monolayers in duplicate wells (200 \u00b5l each); the limit of detection of the assay was 25 plaque forming units per milliliter."}
