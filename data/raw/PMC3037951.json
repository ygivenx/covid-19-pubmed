{"title": "Short Term Effects of Weather on Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease", "body": "Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by a number of different enteroviruses, among which are enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackie A16 (CA16). The disease is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets, feces, and blister fluid of infective patients or through contact with contaminated environment such as water, food, or surface [1], [2]. HFMD inflicts mainly children with mild clinical symptoms include fever, blisters and sores in mouth, palms and soles following 3\u20137 days of incubation period and a patient generally recovers in 7\u201310 days. Nevertheless, severe health consequences or death may occur owing to complications such as encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, and acute flaccid paralysis mainly following EV71 infection. HFMD can be asymptomatic and it is possible for a recovered person to be infected again by different serotypes of enteroviruses [1]. There is no specific treatment or vaccine available; therefore, preventive measures such as avoid direct contact with infective patients, disinfection of viral contaminated items or premises, and good personal hygiene practices remain the only effective methods to disrupt disease transmission.\n\nIn recent decade, Asian countries have experienced increasing trend of HFMD outbreak with deaths among children due to severe complications [3], [4], [5]. HFMD has raised public health concerns in Asia following severe outbreaks in Malaysia and Taiwan in 1997 and 1998, respectively. About 6000 young children were infected with 42 deaths during the HFMD outbreak in Malaysia [6]. Whereas a total of 129,106 cases were reported in Taiwan with 405 children suffered complications that led to 78 deaths [7], [8]. In the first half of 2010, mainland China experienced 72% increase in HFMD cases compared with 2009; resulting in approximately 1.3 million reported cases [5]. Also, 5454 severe cases that caused 260 deaths were reported in mainland China between January to the first week of May [5]. HFMD outbreaks generally occur in 2\u20133 years cyclical pattern in endemic countries across the Western Pacific Region and EV71-related HFMD outbreak frequency is expected to increase in the region partly owing to complex factors including continued evolution and emergence of novel recombinants of EV71, inadequate healthcare capacity, and a lack of effective surveillance system in some countries [9].\n\nHFMD is endemic in Singapore with EV71 and CA16 as two main dominant circulating strains. About 90% of the reported cases were children below 10 years old. The number of HFMD outbreaks reported from childcare centers, kindergartens, and preschools had escalated from about 167 in year 2001 to more than 1700 in year 2007. In the same period, the incidence rate among children aged 0\u20134 years surged from approximately 16 to 60 per 1000 populations and from 3 to 21 per 1000 populations among children 5\u20139 years old [10].\n\nHFMD is endemic in the tropical and subtropical countries with tendency of higher number of cases in wet season depending on geographical locations [5], [11]. Whereas outbreaks usually occur in summer or early fall in temperate countries. Enterovirus surveillance in USA for the period 1970\u20132005 showed that EV71 and CA16 had endemic circulation pattern and that around 70% of cases were reported during warmer seasons between June\u2013October [12]. Considering the seasonal pattern of HFMD outbreaks, we hypothesized that short-term changes in weather can influence the transmission dynamic of HFMD. This study aims to establish a relationship, analyze the effects and estimate potential thresholds of weekly temperature and rainfall associated with the risk of HFMD outbreaks in Singapore.\n\nSingapore is an island state nation with land size of approximately 710 km2 and population density of 7000 persons per km2\n[13]. The island experiences tropical climate with high temperature, humidity, and rainfall.\n\nWeekly cases of HFMD for the period 2001\u20132008 were obtained from the Weekly Infectious Diseases Bulletins of Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health Singapore [14]. Report of HFMD cases from physicians, education institutions, and laboratories was mandatory in Singapore since October 2000 [15], [16]. Data of daily temperature and rainfall were retrieved from National Climatic Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USA [17]. Weekly average temperature and cumulative rainfall were computed or aggregated from daily weather data. Weekly temperature difference (Tp) was computed as the difference between weekly average maximum and minimum temperature.\n\nWe established time series Poisson regression models to analyze the relationship between weather and HFMD cases adjusting for long-term time trends and seasonality. Time trends, driven by other factors such as circulating virus serotypes, disease control measures, and social behavior, could confound the relationship between temperature (e.g. seasonality) and HFMD. Therefore, trend and seasonality were adjusted to account for time varying factors that were influential on weekly HFMD incidence during the study period. We modeled the seasonality and long-term time trends in one function allowing the seasonality (driven by unknown factors) of HFMD to change between years as that allows more flexible adjustment for the potential confounding. We used smooth functions of natural cubic splines allowing 12 degrees of freedom (df) to adjust for seasonality and long-term time trends. Sensitivity to the effect estimates the flexibility of the smooth function of time trends was further tested using df of 8, 10, 15, and 20. The sensitivity tests did not show significantly different results of the estimated risk functions. We tested the lag time between temperature, rainfall, and HFMD by including lag terms 1\u20132 and 3\u20134 weeks using a backward stepwise model fitting procedure. The tests indicated insignificant results for lag term 3\u20134 weeks; thus, only lag term 1\u20132 weeks was included in the model. We analyzed the risk of HFMD as function of temperature and rainfall using 2 different models. In Model A, we included temperature difference (Tp) as the only temperature parameter; whereas both weekly minimum and maximum temperature were included in Model B. Model A was included to demonstrate risk function without potential co-linearity bias due to correlation between minimum and maximum temperature. To test the sensitivity of Model B for the co-linearity between minimum and maximum temperature, we repeated analysis using either minimum or maximum temperature parameter in each test. At a first stage, we allowed a non-linear exposure-response relationship using natural cubic splines with 4 df. In a second stage, we estimated the risk ratio of the relationship between weather parameters and HFMD incidence using piecewise linear spline functions where such approximation appeared applicable. One characteristic of infectious disease is the serial correlation between past and current incidence. Examination of the time series using autocorrelation function (ACF) indicated serial correlation for consecutive lags of HFMD cases; thus, we included autoregressive term of time lag 1\u20132 weeks based on average infectious and recovery period of a patient [1], [18].\n\nModel A =  model with temperature differences and rainfall\n\n\n\nModel B  =  model with minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall\n\n\nWhere Log (\u00b5(t)) is the mean predicted weekly cases of HFMD; t equals the week in year 2001\u20132008; \u03b20 represents the intercept; tmaxt represents maximum temperature; tmint represents minimum temperature; Tpt means temperature difference; S denotes a cubic spline function with corresponding degrees of freedom (df); raint is the cumulative rainfall; trend equals to week number running from 1 in the first week of year 2001; and hfmdt is an autoregressive term of HFMD.\n\nThe optimal model and parameters were selected and validated using post estimation residuals and the Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The post estimation was performed by plotting predicted residuals against observed data in addition to the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), scatter plots, normality tests and histogram of residuals. The risk ratio of HFMD incidence was presented as function of weather in relation to a minimum point of the curve or as corresponding to a unit increase of a particular weather predictor. All estimates were presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Statistical analyses were conducted using R 2.10.1 [19] and STATA 11.1 (StataCorp, USA).\n\nDuring the study period, Singapore experienced nationwide HFMD outbreaks in March-May in year 2002 and 2005\u20132008. Bimodal outbreaks occurred yearly with second outbreak in August-October during 2005 to 2008.\n\nMinimum and maximum temperature during the study period ranged from 22.8\u201327.6\u00b0C and 27.7\u201334.6\u00b0C, respectively. The highest weekly maximum temperature and lowest minimum temperature was recorded in 2005 and 2008 respectively. Overall, Singapore experienced temperature above 32\u00b0C in one-third of the study period with a total of 30 weeks in 2002 and about 6 weeks in 2008 (Figure 1). A total of 30 weeks with temperature difference (Tp) above 7\u00b0C was observed in year 2005, and highest weekly Tp of 8.8\u00b0C was recorded in 2006 and 2008. The weekly cumulative rainfall during the study period ranged from 0\u2013388 mm with higher amount of rainfall recorded between October and January. About 80% of the weekly cumulative rainfall was below 75 mm.\n\nThe HFMD incidence was significantly associated with short term variability of weekly temperature difference (Tp), minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and cumulative rainfall at time lag of 1\u20132 weeks. Figure 2a depicts a wide J-shaped relationship between HFMD incidence and Tp with significant increase in the risk of HFMD incidence when Tp is above 7\u00b0C. Likewise, the risk of HFMD incidence rises steeply when maximum temperature is above 32\u00b0C; while low maximum temperature poses negligible effects on HFMD (Figure 2c). Inverse relationship is observed between minimum temperature and HFMD incidence (Figure 2d). Similar results are obtained when we test minimum and maximum temperature independently, except that minimum temperature is not statistically significant (Figure 2e & 2f). Figure 2b indicates the relative risk of HFMD incidence increases linearly with weekly cumulative rainfall between 0\u201375 mm; whereas every unit increases beyond 75 mm reduces the risk of HFMD incidence. During the study period, Tp>7\u00b0C mainly coincided with maximum temperature above 32\u00b0C and low rainfall, except year 2008.\n\nIn the piecewise linear Poisson regression function, we used breakpoints of 32\u00b0C for maximum temperature, 25\u00b0C for minimum temperature, 7\u00b0C for Tp, and 75 mm for rainfall. Table 1 shows every 1\u00b0C increases in maximum temperature above 32\u00b0C and in weekly Tp above 7\u00b0C elevates the risks of HFMD incidence significantly by 36% and 41%, respectively. The risk, however, declines by 17% with each degree increases in minimum temperature above 25\u00b0C. Additionally, a unit (mm) increases in weekly cumulative rainfall between 0\u201375 mm elevates risk of HFMD incidence by 0.3%.\n\nObserved and predicted time series of HFMD using both models produced similar results. Both model A and B explained about 87% of variations among HFMD cases using temperature, rainfall, and trend parameters. The residuals plots indicated model residuals did not violate the statistical modeling assumptions. Furthermore, the PACF showed no indication of further non-adjusted residual autocorrelation.\n\nWe found a strong relationship between HFMD incidence and the preceding 1\u20132 weeks weather parameters after adjusting for other time varying factors. A maximum daily temperature above 32\u00b0C and rainfall up to 75 mm is expected to increase the HFMD incidence in the subsequent 1\u20132 weeks. These findings suggest that weather parameters can be used as early risk indicators for potential HFMD outbreaks. Implementing a simple weather-based early warning could help 1) local authority to heighten alert, intensify surveillance, and activate infection control measures to prevent or curb disease outbreaks; and 2) community to exercise vigilance and take precautionary actions such as good hygiene practices and isolation to disrupt HFMD transmission chain. However, future studies are required to confirm this relationship in other regions. Subsequent studies need to elucidate the chain of events following temperature and rainfall changes and their pathways to the increase of HFMD incidence."}
