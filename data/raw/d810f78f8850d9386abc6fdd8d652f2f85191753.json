{"title": "The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China", "body": "history, and timelines of reporting changes to identify early shifts in the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, from an epidemic driven by frequent importations to local transmission.\n\nAs of 1 st March 2020, 79,986 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China (Fig. 1a) (10) . Reports of cases in China were mostly restricted to Hubei until 23 rd January 2020 (81% of all cases), after which most provinces reported rapid increases in cases (Fig. 1a) . We build a line list dataset from reported cases in China with information on travel history and demographic characteristics. We note that the majority of early cases (before 23 rd January 2020, Materials and Methods) reported outside of Wuhan had known travel history to Wuhan (57%) and were distributed across China (Fig. 1b) , highlighting the importance of Wuhan as the major source. However, testing was initially focused mainly on travelers to Wuhan, potentially biasing our estimates of travel related infections upwards (Materials and Methods). Among cases known to have traveled from Wuhan before 23 rd January 2020, the time from symptom onset to confirmation was 6.5 days (SD: 4.2, Fig. S2 ), providing opportunity for onward transmission at the destination. More active surveillance brought this interval down to 4.8 days (SD: 3.03, Fig. S2 ) for those who travelled after 23 rd January 2020.\n\nTo identify accurately a timeframe for evaluating early shifts in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China, we first estimated from case data the average incubation period of COVID-19 infection (i.e. the duration between time of infection and symptom onset (6, 7) ). Since infection events are typically not directly observed, we estimate incubation period from the span of exposure during which infection likely occurred. Using detailed information on 38 cases for whom both the dates of entry to and exit from Wuhan are known, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days (std. dev. = 3.0 days; Fig. S1 ), similar to previous estimates from other data (8, 9) . In subsequent analyses we add an upper estimate of one incubation period (mean + 1 standard deviation = 8 days) to the date of Wuhan shutdown, in order to delineate the date before which cases recorded in other provinces might represent infections acquired in Hubei (i.e. 1 st February 2020; Fig. 1a ). In order to understand whether the volume of travel within China can predict the epidemic outside of Wuhan, we analyzed real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc., together with epidemiological data from each province (Materials and Methods). Small local transmission clusters (in a family) of COVID-19 were first reported in Guangzhou, Guangdong province (14) . We investigated spatio-temporal disease spread to elucidate the relative contribution of Wuhan to transmission elsewhere and evaluate how the cordon sanitaire may have impacted it.\n\nAmong cases reported outside Hubei province in our dataset, we observe 515 cases with known travel history to Wuhan and a symptom onset date before 31 st January 2020, compared with only 39 after 31 st January, 2020, illustrating the effect of travel restrictions (Figs. 1b, 2a, Fig. S3) . We confirm the expected decline of importation with real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc. Movements of individuals out of Wuhan increased in the days before the Lunar New Year and the establishment of the cordon sanitaire, before rapidly decreasing to almost no movement (Figs. 2a,b) . The travel ban appears to have prevented travel in and out of Wuhan around the time of the Lunar New Year celebration (Fig. 2a) and likely reduced further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan.\n\nTo test the contribution of the epidemic in Wuhan to seeding epidemics elsewhere in China we build a na\u00efve COVID-19 GLM (15) model of daily case counts (Materials and Methods). We estimate the epidemic doubling time outside Hubei to be 4.0 days (range across provinces of 3.6 -5.0 days) and estimate the epidemic doubling time within Hubei to be 7.2 days, consistent with previous reports (5, 9, 16, 17) . Our predicts daily case counts across all provinces with relatively high accuracy (as measured with a pseudo-R 2 from a negative binomial GLM) throughout early February 2020, and when accounting for human mobility (Figs. 2c, Table S1, S2).\n\nWe find that the magnitude of the epidemic (total number of cases until February 10, 2020) outside of Wuhan is remarkably well predicted by the volume of human movement out of Wuhan alone (R 2 = 0.89 from a log-linear regression using cumulative cases, Fig. S8 ). Therefore cases exported from Wuhan prior to the cordon sanitaire appear to have not only contributed to initiating local chains of transmission, both in neighboring provinces such as Henan, and in comparatively more distant provinces, e.g., Guangdong .

This suggests that travel restrictions may have reduced the flow of case importations from Wuhan; but also that other factors guiding a local epidemic may be taking over.

In the same period, we show that variation in the growth rates are almost entirely explained by human movements from Wuhan (Fig. 3c) , consistent with theory of infectious disease spread in highly coupled metapopulations (19, 20) . Following the implementation of drastic control measures across the country, growth rates become negative (Fig 3b) , indicating that transmission is being successfully mitigated. The correlation of growth rates and human mobility from Wuhan becomes negative, i.e. provinces with larger mobility prior to the cordon sanitaire (but also larger number of cases overall) have more rapidly declining growth rates of daily case counts. This could be partly due to travel restrictions but also the fact that control measures may have been more drastic in locations with larger outbreaks with local transmission (see more detail in section \"Current role of imported cases in Chinese provinces\"). The travel ban coincides with increased testing capacity across provinces in China. An alternative hypothesis is that the observed epidemiological patterns outside Wuhan are the result of increased testing capacity. We test this hypothesis by including differences in testing capacity before and after the rollout of large scale testing in China on 20 th of January 2020 and test its impact on the predictability of daily cases (Materials and Methods). We plot the relative improvement in the prediction of our model (based on normalized residual error) of (i) a model that includes mobility from Wuhan and (ii) a model that includes testing availability (see more details in Materials and Methods). Overall, the inclusion of mobility data from Wuhan produces a significant improvement in the models prediction (delta-BIC > 250, (24) ) over a naive model that considers only autochthonous transmission with a doubling time of 2-8 days (Fig. 3b) . Of the 27 provinces in China reporting cases through February 6 th , 2020, we find that in 12 provinces the largest improvements in prediction can be achieved using mobility only (Fig. S5) . In 10 provinces, both testing and mobility improve the models prediction and in only one province testing is the most important factor improving model prediction (Fig. S5) . We conclude that laboratory testing during the early phase of the epidemic is critical, however, mobility out of Wuhan remains the main driver of spread prior to the shutdown.\n\nAs case counts are decreasing outside Wuhan (Fig 3b) , we can further investigate the current contribution of imported cases to local epidemics outside Wuhan by investigating case characteristics. Age and sex distributions can reflect heterogeneities in the risk of infection within affected populations. To investigate .

However, details of travel history exist for only a fraction of confirmed cases and this information is particularly scant for some provinces (e.g. Zhejiang and Guangdong). Consequently, we grouped confirmed cases into four categories: (I) early cases with travel history (early = reported before 1 st Feb), (II) early cases without travel history, (III) later cases with travel history (later = reported between 1 st -10 th Feb), (IV) later cases without travel history.\n\nUsing crowdsourced case data, we found that cases with travel history (categories I and III) had similar median ages and sex ratios in both the early and later phases of the outbreak (41 vs 42 years old, 50%\n\ninterquartile interval: 32.75 vs 30.75 and 54.25 vs 53.5 respectively, p-value > 0.1; 1.47 vs. 1.45 males per female, respectively; Fig. 4d, Fig. S7 ). Early cases with no information on travel history (category II) had a similar median age and sex ratio to those with known travel history (42 years old (50% interquartile interval: 30.5 -49.5, p-value > 0.1) and 1.80 males per female, Fig. 4d) . However, the sex ratio of later cases without reported travel history (category IV) shifted to approximately 1:1 (57 male vs. 62 female, X 2 test, p-value < 0.01), as expected under a null hypothesis of equal transmission risk (Fig. 4a ,b,d, see also reference (11, 12) , Materials and Methods) and the median age in this group increased to 46 (50% interquartile interval: 34.25 -58, t-test: p-value < 0.01) (Figs. 4a,b,c, Fig. S7 ). We hypothesize that many of the cases with no known travel history in the early period were indeed travelers that contributed to disseminating SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan. The shift towards more equal sex ratios and older ages in non-travellers after 31 st January 2020 confirm the finding that epidemics outside Wuhan were then driven by local transmission dynamics. The case definition changed to include cases without travel history to Wuhan after 23 th January 2020 (Materials and Methods).\n\n.

Intensive control measures, including travel restrictions, have been implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19 in China. Here, we showed that this combination of interventions was successful in mitigating the spread and reduce local transmission of COVID-19 in China although it is not possible to definitively determine the individual impact of each intervention. More analyses will be required to determine how to optimally balance the expected positive effects on health with the negative impact on individual liberties, the economy, and society at large.\n\n.

We assumed that cases travelling from Wuhan were exposed during their stay in Wuhan. We estimated the incubation period from 38 travelling cases returning from Wuhan with known dates of symptom onset, entry and exit. The end of the exposure period was assumed to be the exit travel date except if symptom onset occurred prior to the exit date (in which case exposure was assumed to have occurred prior to symptom onset). The start of the exposure period corresponded to the entry date. We assumed that the incubation period could not exceed 30 days.\n\nFor each case, the minimum and maximum incubation period was derived from the dates of entry, exit and symptom onset\n\nWe fitted a truncated gamma distribution (0 to 30 days) and estimated the mean and variance of the incubation period using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a Bayesian framework using an uninformative prior distribution. We derived the likelihood as follows:\n\nA Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was implemented in R. Marginal posteriors were sampled from a chain of 5,000 steps after discarding a burn-in of 50 steps. Convergence was inspected visually.\n\nAge and sex distributions are important in understanding risk of infection across populations. Assuming risk to be distributed relatively equally across a population, as an outbreak evolves age and sex distributions should follow the underlying population structure. Varying degrees of immunity and exposure may shift these distributions (31) . To examine whether the ongoing outbreak shifted from an epidemic concentrated in Wuhan and among travelers from .

This was selected to be 8 days after the Wuhan shutdown, which conservatively corresponds to one incubation period + 1SD (see above) after the shutdown. After that date (i.e. 1 st Feb 2020) we assume that most reported transmissions in provinces outside of Wuhan are the result of local transmission. We further divided our data in those that had cases with known travel history to Wuhan and those who did not. Then we produce the following summary statistics:\n\n1.

Further, more work will be necessary to understand the differential risk of severe or symptomatic disease to fully understand the age and sex distributions in this outbreak. For example, why there are relatively few reports of cases <18y old. However, as for other respiratory pathogens symptomatic and severe infection were more concentrated in older populations. We do not intend to make any general statements about differential risk but were more interested in shifts in reported cases across multiple geographies in China.\n\nWe extract human mobility data from the Baidu Qianxi web platform, which presents daily population travels between cities or provinces tracked through the Baidu Huiyan system. The data do not represent numbers of individual travelers but rather an index of relative movements constructed by Baidu's proprietary methods which are correlated with human mobility (32) (http://qianxi.baidu.com/). In particular, two pieces of information are collected. First, we extract a series of migration scale indices for traveling out of Wuhan, from January 1st to February 10, both in 2019 and 2020. Second, we obtain the proportion of human movement from Wuhan were bound for each of 31 provinces in China. These proportions are available for January 1st -February 10, 2020. Based on this data we had access to both changes in mobility volume and changes in mobility direction. See more detailed descriptions of the human movement data here: (33, 34) Review of interventions and reporting shifts: We reviewed the literature and online social media to understand the key timings of interventions and announcements that are relevant for disease transmission across China. We collated information about the type (e.g., announcement of outbreak, travel restrictions, isolation of patients, etc.), geographic location (e.g., city where available, province), and timing (specific date or date range).\n\n.

Models were fit to province-level data. The three models were compared using differences in Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), where larger values indicate models with lower relative support, and BIC>4 considered the cutoff for substantial model improvement. We performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on the availability of PCR tests, doubling time, and incubation periods. We obtained qualitatively similar results for Model 1 (Poisson GLM fit to daily case counts), Model 2 (negative binomial GLM fit to daily case counts ), and Model 3 (log-linear regressions fit to cumulative cases), see Table S2 . In addition, we provide a full time series analysis of the optimal lag structure for cases and mobility for each province. Additionally, although BIC is considered more conservative, model selection results were confirmed using AIC for model selection (see Fig. 4 and Table S2 ). Lastly, we validated our model selection results using elastic-net regression and n-fold cross validation as implemented in the R package GLMNET (11, 12. Estimating epidemic doubling time: To estimate the epidemic doubling time across each province, we fit a mixed effects Poisson GLM of daily case counts to days since the first case report in each province (fixed effect) and a random effect for each province on the slope and intercept, using the R package lme4 v.1.1-21 (35) . Daily case counts were determined using the date of symptom onset. However, we only have a symptom onset date for 667 cases. Where the date of symptom onset was not available, we .

Using this model, we estimated the onset date for the 31436 cases with a recorded confirmation date. \n\nTo ascertain whether earlier travel restrictions could have prevented the wide-spread increase in cases witnessed in late-January we constructed a simple forecasting model for COVID-19. Briefly, we forecast the cumulative number of cases in each Chinese province by simply doubling the number of cumulative cases reported six days prior. For dates prior to Jan. 28th and after Feb 3rd, this naive forecast produces an accurate estimate of the cumulative number of cases in each province (Fig. S4) . However, the cumulative number of cases reported on Jan 28th is poorly estimated using this model (Fig. S4) . In order to accurately forecast the number of cases on Jan 28th, we must also include the relative amount of mobility out of Wuhan into various provinces in the regression model. In Fig. S4 , we show how a model including only movement from Wuhan on January 22nd fit to the residuals from Fig. S4 is once again .
