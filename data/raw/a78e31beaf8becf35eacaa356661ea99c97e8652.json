{"title": "", "body": "This study focused on: (i) all ages in Curitiba, (ii) adults (+18) and elderly (60+) in Rio de Janeiro, and (iiii) children (<18) in Fortaleza. Patients presenting an acute process, whose indication for admission was any of a predefined set of conditions described as potentially associated with a recent influenza infection, were enrolled and epidemiological data were collected.\n\nThere were no interventions.\n\n1 Influenza infection.\n\nA total of 1,666 patients were screened and 595 met the criteria for inclusion.\n\nInfluenza viruses and ORVs were detected in 6.5% and 59% of patients, respectively.\n\nInfluenza)positive cases fell in the severe spectrum compared to those with ORV (30% vs. 11%), but without any difference in mortality rates. Epidemiological results revealed variations in the peak time of influenza infections between Northeast (Fortaleza) and\n\nSouth (Curitiba) Brazil, which basically followed the rain period of each region. In the Northeast, in particular, viral circulation was prevalent in the first 4 months of the year, indicating that the vaccination campaign was being carried out in a post)seasonal period, possibly explaining the low effectiveness. Through broad geographical coverage and data standardization, the GIHSN group seeks to obtain a global picture of the impact of influenza on patients with respiratory pathologies. In addition, this network provides invaluable tools to investigate the seasonality of influenza in regions in which this information is not available, as well as a framework for estimating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines in preventing severe cases among age and risk groups.\n\nIn 2015, the GIHSN group started a study in Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, and In Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, patient recruitment and data collection occurred from April to September, coinciding with the period of influenza seasonality in South and Southeast Brazil. In Fortaleza, the study spanned all of 2015, because, in spite of a previous study showing influenza circulation between January and April, [11] the seasonality of influenza in this region is not well established.\n\nIn Curitiba, the study was carried out at HC/UFPR, a 310)bed tertiary care academic center, with 47 beds for intensive care. It is also one of the sentinel hospitals for influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance in the region.\n\nCuritiba is located at 25\u00b0 25\u2032 S, 49\u00b0 15\u2032 W, 924 m (3031 ft), and has a mild marine west coast climate, with no dry season and warm summers. Seasonality is moderate, with heavy precipitation during mild winters and a mean temperature of 16.5\u00b0C. The city's population numbered approximately 1,879,355 people in 2015.\n\nIn Fortaleza, the study was conducted at HIAS, a public health institution of 270 beds. It is a city of 2,500,000 inhabitants at sea level, 4\u00b0 south of the equator. Its tropical climate is characterized by two distinct seasons: a rainy one between January and May, and a dry one during the rest of the year. There is high relative humidity (79%) and little variation in the average temperature (26.4\u00b0C).\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the study was conducted at Hospital Quinta D'Or, which is a private hospital with 350 beds for general admission and 150 beds in the intensive care unit (ICU). Rio de Janeiro is located at 22\u00b0 54\u2032S, 43\u00b0 12\u2032W and its climate is classified as tropical Atlantic. The year comprises two seasons: a hot and relatively humid one, and another with mild temperatures and less rainfall.\n\nPatients of all ages, who were admitted for any acute condition described as potentially associated to influenza, were considered eligible for enrollment in the study. To be included, eligible patients were identified in the hospital admission registries and had to comply with all of the following criteria: i) admission within 24 to 72 h prior to recruitment; ii) be a resident in the area of the study (defined for each site) and belong to the base population source; and iii) a referred history of any acute condition associated to influenza with onset within 7 days or less prior to admission to the hospital. The study used the European CDC definition for ILI, which included at least one out of four systemic symptoms (fever, headache, myalgia, or malaise) and at least one out of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath).\n\nPatients who did not give consent to participate, institutionalized individuals, and those with a history of hospitalization within 30 days or less prior to recruitment were excluded from the study.\n\nSamples were collected using flocked nylon swabs (Copan, Italy). It was collected one nasopharyngeal and one pharyngeal swab (or nasal swab for patients <14 years). Samples were added to a flask containing 3 mL of universal viral transport medium (UTM\u2122 Medium; Copan, Italy) and stored at )80 o C until tested.\n\nAll samples were submitted to nucleic acid extraction using a QIAmp Viral Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics with normal and non)normal distributions are presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), respectively. We compared the parameters associated with influenza and During the study period, 1,666 patients from three participating hospitals were screened (161 in Curitiba, 1,362 in Fortaleza, and 143 in Rio de Janeiro). A total of 595 patients met the criteria for inclusion, as shown in Figure 1 .\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the population are listed in Table   1 . In Curitiba and Fortaleza subsets, males and females were recruited in equal proportions and most individuals were younger than 5 years. In contrast, in Rio de Janeiro, females and adults were predominant, and no child under 2 years was included.\n\nAs expected from a predominantly young population, the prevalence of chronic conditions associated to aggravation of influenza was low in Curitiba and Fortaleza subsets. In contrast, the Rio de Janeiro subset was characterized by a significantly higher prevalence of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, COPD, and diabetes.\n\nOther factors that impact the prevalence of severe influenza infections are the use of antivirals and vaccination. Antiviral administration was more frequently reported in Curitiba. Overall, influenza vaccination rates were low, in spite of most age groups included in the study being covered by the Brazilian immunization program: around 31% of patients from Curitiba were vaccinated, against the estimated 14% and 19% in Fortaleza, and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. In general, only 21% of children younger than 5 years who were included in the study were vaccinated. Severe disease was detected in 149/595 cases (24%), but mortality was low: 9/595 (1.5%).\n\nAll samples were tested for influenza virus, and a total of 39 (6.5%) were positive; 23 (59%) for influenza A H3N2 and 16 (41%) for influenza B ) all Yamagata) like lineage. Of these cases, nine (23%) presented co)infection with ORV.\n\nThe presence of ORV was tested in 497 patients (83.5%), with 293 (59%) of them being positive and 46 (16%) presenting co)infection. RSV was the most frequently \n\nEpidemiological and clinical data comparing patients infected with influenza and those infected with ORV were assessed; only monoinfected cases were included in this analysis. As shown in Table 2 , 9/37 influenza)positive cases fell in the severe spectrum, and severe disease was significantly more frequent in influenza)infected patients than in those with ORV (30% vs. 11%). In an adjusted analysis, only age was associated with this outcome ( = 0.01), whereas presence of comorbidities was not ( = 0.12). No difference in mortality was observed between influenza) and ORV)infected patients.\n\nTo better understand the seasonality of influenza infections in the study sites, we evaluated the monthly distribution of samples and viral positivity. Then, we plotted this information against the temperature and precipitation (historical means) recorded for each month. Results show variations between Northeast (Fortaleza) and South (Curitiba) Brazil in relation to the peak time of influenza infections, which essentially followed the rain season of each region. Finally, results indicate that immunization against influenza in the Northeast was carried out after the period of virus circulation ( Figure 3 ). Data from Rio de Janeiro were not evaluated owing to the small number of patients included in the study.\n\nThe subtyped influenza A. [15] Since 2014, the Brazilian Ministry of Health included children up to 4 years of age in the group of individuals at risk of severe influenza and, thus, started vaccination of this subpopulation. Data from the National Immunization Program show coverage rates above 83% among young children and pregnant women, 89% in the elderly, and 95% in health workers. [10, 14] However, in this study, a much lower coverage was observed, with only 21% of patients reporting or showing proof of influenza vaccination. This was surprising, considering that a significant part of our patients fell in at least one risk category or presented comorbidities. Given a 10.5% mortality rate due to influenza)related SARI cases in 2015, it is essential to assess the reasons for such low immunization frequency. Among influenza deaths, 65% of patients and particularly those aged over 60 presented at least one risk factor likely to cause complications. [10] Our data emphasize the need for a comprehensive identification of the weaknesses of the vaccination campaigns and an intensification of the efforts to bring immunization to these individuals.\n\nWe also evaluated the prevalence of ORV in a subset of samples from HC/UFPR, and samples that were selected randomly among patients from Fortaleza and patient was very low, whereas codetection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common. This observation is consistent with those in previous reports by our group, and we hypothesize that low codetection of influenza with other ORV is due to the higher pathogenicity of influenza. [17, 19] Next, we compared clinical and epidemiological data from influenza) and ORV)\n\ninfected patients in an attempt to evaluate the impact of influenza infections. The latter were significantly more abundant in older patients and those with severe diseases, whereas comorbidities were associated with ORV infections. These findings reflect the higher virulence of influenza viruses, but could also be a consequence of a lower adhesion to immunization among older children. No difference in mortality was observed between groups infected with different viruses. This contrasts with a previous study performed in Fortaleza, which showed significant association between RSV infections and infant mortality. [20] We believe that such discrepancy may be due to the low number of positive cases observed in the present study.\n\nStudies on influenza seasonality in Brazil have shown that viral circulation in the Northeast region was more prevalent in the first 4 months of the year, coinciding with a period of higher humidity in that area [11, 21] , whereas a distinct pattern of viral 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 No additional data available.\n\nThe authors have no competing interests.\n\nThis work was supported by Sanofi Pasteur through the Global Influenza Hospital\n\nSurveillance Network and the M\u00e9rieux Foundation.

In the Northeast, in particular, viral circulation was prevalent in the first 4 months of the year, indicating that the vaccination campaign was being carried out in a post)seasonal period, possibly explaining the low effectiveness. The main weakness of the data is the low inclusion of patients in Rio de Janeiro that does not allow for an assessment of the impact of viral respiratory infections in southeastern Brazil. Seasonal influenza epidemics peak during the winter in temperate latitudes of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In contrast, tropical countries may experience two annual peaks, with shorter and less intense epidemics. [3, 4] Moreover, previous studies showed that influenza activity has been frequently out of phase with the hemispheric winter in many tropical regions, and even temperate ones, with the consequence that optimal timing for routine influenza vaccination recommendations does not necessarily correspond to the one expected for their hemisphere. [5] . In Brazil, which presents temperate and tropical regions, it has been showed an important regional heterogeneity in influenza peak. [6, 7] Besides climate and environmental conditions, which have shown an association between seasonal influenza epidemics with \"cold)dry\" and \"humid)rainy\".

No difference in mortality was observed between influenza) and ORV)infected patients. Overall, the frequency of influenza viruses in the study specimens was 6.5% subtyped influenza A. [18] Since 2014, the Brazilian Ministry of Health included children up to 4 years of age in the group of individuals at risk of severe influenza and, thus, started vaccination of this subpopulation. Data from the National Immunization Program show coverage rates above 83% among young children and pregnant women, 89% in the elderly, and 95% in health workers. [13, 17] . In the present study, it was observed that proportionally there were a higher percentage of patients from Curitiba vaccinated among the 3 sites.\n\nHowever, overall a lower coverage was observed, with only 21% of patients reporting or showing proof of influenza vaccination.

Interestingly, although circulation of influenza and ORV coincide in time, the frequency of codetection of influenza with ORV in the same patient was very low, whereas codetection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common.

No difference in mortality was observed between groups infected with different viruses. This contrasts with a previous study performed in Fortaleza, which showed significant association between RSV To know the dynamics of dispersion of influenza viruses in tropical regions have been considered of crucial importance, since several reports have suggested that in these regions the influenza activity is more temporally diffuse and may contain the foci for the emergence of new variants. [6, 7, 27] In addition to the need for a different influenza immunization schedule in Brazil, the composition of this vaccine should also be evaluated, since its antigenic composition for this region may be different from that recommended for the temperate region. [7] However, information on strains circulating in tropics is still scarce, since most of the countries in this region have low income and the health surveillance is not completely employed. Besides that, the logistical challenges to implementing a national immunization program with different calendars and distinct antigenic compositions in Brazil meet the need for investments that provide self)sufficiency in its production [7] .

Initially, immunization targeted individuals aged \u226565 years; however, in 2000, the age limit was lowered to 60 years. In 2016, the Brazilian Ministry of Health extended the recommendation to children <5 years, pregnant women, people with 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 procedures were performed according to approved protocols, and consent was obtained from all patients (or guardians).\n\nThis multicenter, cross+sectional study was designed to provide information on active surveillance of influenza in hospitalized patients. Data were collected in 2015 from three participating hospitals located in distinct cities and regions of Brazil:\n\nCuritiba (south), Fortaleza (northeast), and Rio de Janeiro (southeast) (Figure 1 ).\n\nIn Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, patient recruitment and data collection occurred from April to September, coinciding with the period of influenza seasonality in south and southeast Brazil. In Fortaleza, the study spanned all of 2015, because, despite a previous study showing influenza circulation between January and April, 14 the seasonality of influenza in this region is not well established.\n\nIn Curitiba, the study was performed at HC/UFPR, a 310+bed, tertiary care, academic center, with 47 beds in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is also among the sentinel hospitals for influenza and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in the region. Curitiba is located at 25\u00b0 25\u2032 S, 49\u00b0 15\u2032 W, 924 m (3031 ft) and has a mild marine west coast climate, with no dry season and warm summers.\n\nSeasonality is moderate, with heavy precipitation during mild winters and a mean temperature of 16.5\u00b0C. The city population numbered ~1,879,355 people in 2015.\n\nIn Fortaleza, this study was conducted at HIAS, a public health institution of 270 beds.

Its tropical climate is characterized by two distinct seasons: a rainy one occurring between January and May, and a dry one occurring during the rest of the year.\n\nThere is high relative humidity (79%) and little variation in the average temperature (26.4\u00b0C).\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, this study was conducted at Hospital Quinta D'Or, which is a private hospital with 350 beds for general admission and 150 beds in the ICU. Rio de Janeiro is located at 22\u00b0 54\u2032S, 43\u00b0 12\u2032W, and its climate is classified as tropical Atlantic. The year comprises two seasons: a hot and relatively humid one and another with mild temperatures and less rainfall.\n\n\"373 .\n\nPatients of all ages who were admitted for any acute condition described as potentially associated with influenza were considered eligible for enrollment in the study. To be included, eligible patients were identified in the hospital admission registries and had to comply with all of the following criteria: 1) admission within 24 h to 72 h prior to recruitment; 2) a resident of the area of the study (defined for each site) and belonging to the base population source; and 3) a referral history for any acute condition associated with influenza and exhibiting onset within \u22647 days prior to hospital admission. This study used the European Center for Disease Control definition for ILI, which included at least one of four systemic symptoms (fever, headache, myalgia, or malaise) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath). Patients who did not give consent to participate, institutionalized individuals, and those with a history of hospitalization \u226430 days prior to recruitment were excluded from the study.\n\nSamples were collected using nylon FLOQswabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy) and proportions, with most individuals <5 years of age. By contrast, in Rio de Janeiro, females and adults were predominant, as the hospital did not evaluate children.\n\nAs expected from a predominantly young population, the prevalence of chronic conditions associated with aggravation of influenza was low in the Curitiba and Fortaleza subsets, whereas the Rio de Janeiro subset was characterized by a significantly higher prevalence of conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes.\n\nOther factors that impact the prevalence of severe influenza infections are the use of antivirals and vaccination. Antiviral administration was more frequently reported in Curitiba. Overall, influenza vaccination rates were low, despite most age groups included in the study being covered by the Brazilian immunization program: ~31% of patients from Curitiba were vaccinated, and an estimated 14% and 19% were vaccinated in Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Only 21% of children <5 years who were included in the study were vaccinated. Severe disease was detected in 149/595 cases (24%), but mortality was low: 9/595 (1.5%).\n\nAll samples were tested for influenza virus, with 39 (6.5%) positive: 23 (59%) influenza A H3N2 and 16 (41%) for influenza B (all Yamagata+like lineages). Of these cases, nine (23%) presented ORV co+infection.\n\nThe As shown in Table 2 , 9/37 influenza+positive cases fell into the severe spectrum, and severe disease was significantly more frequent in influenza+infected patients than in those with ORV (30% vs. 11%). In an adjusted analysis, only age was associated with this outcome ( = 0.01), whereas the presence of comorbidities was not ( = 0.12). No difference in mortality was observed between influenza+ and ORV+infected patients.\n\nComparison 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   13 and 95% in health workers. 13, 17 In the present study, we observed that there was a higher percentage of patients from Curitiba vaccinated among the three sites; however, an overall lower coverage was observed, with only 21% of patients reporting or showing proof of influenza vaccination. This was surprising, considering that a significant number of our patients fell in at least one risk category or presented comorbidities.\n\nGiven a 10.5% mortality rate due to influenza+related SARI cases in 2015, it is essential to assess the reasons for such low immunization frequency. Among influenza deaths, 65% of patients and particularly those aged over 60 presented at least one risk factor likely to cause complications. 13 Our data emphasized the need for comprehensive identification of the weaknesses in the vaccination campaigns and an intensification of the efforts to bring immunization to these individuals.\n\nWe also evaluated the prevalence of ORV in a subset of samples from HC/UFPR and in samples selected randomly from among patients from Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro. Overall, different respiratory viruses were found in 59% of the tested samples.\n\nThis was consistent with previous reports showing high co+circulation of ORV in hospitalized patients during the influenza season, and confirmed that the viruses detected caused very similar ILI respiratory manifestations. [19] [20] [21] Moreover, our results reflected the profile of respiratory viruses in children, which was the predominant group included in the study. Interestingly, although circulation of influenza and ORV coincided over time, the frequency of co+detection of influenza with ORV was very low, whereas co+detection of more than one ORV in a single patient was rather common along with RSV. This observation was consistent with those in our previous reports, and we hypothesize that low codetection of influenza with other ORVs in these hospitalized patients was likely due to the higher pathogenicity of influenza. 20, 22 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Understanding the dispersion dynamics of influenza viruses in tropical regions is considered of crucial importance, given that several reports suggested that in these 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 "}
