{"title": "Hepatitis B: Prevalence, Hope", "body": "David Maurice Surrey Dane was educated at Charterhouse School, Surrey, England. (Fig.2). In October 1942 he was gazetted as a Second Lieutenant in the British Army8. In 1943, Dane joined the British Parachute Regiment and was seconded to the Special Air Service (SAS). Having been taught in Northern Ireland to organize the construction of clandestine advanced landing strips, Dane wrote, \u201cI saw a Coastal Command Hudson which crashed and blew up in spectacular fashion when coming in to land at Aldergrove aerodrome with a full load of depth charges on board\u201d 9.\n\nDane was dropped at 1:00 a.m. on 28th June 1944 from an RAF Stirling bomber into a field 250 miles east of Normandy9,10. After exit, his parachute collapsed then reopened at low level. As part of SAS Operation Bulbasket in Nazi-occupied France, Dane organized the building of advanced landing strips; Dane\u2019s main French strip was named Bon Bon. On 7th August 1944 Wing Commander Alan Boxer and Flight Lieutenant Abbott flew two Lockheed Hudsons into Bon Bon to evacuate Allied survivors of Bulbasket: thirty-five out of fifty-five, 64 percent, had been lost9. Dane had to wait at Bon Bon for four more days until a USAAF C-47 (DC3) arrived, piloted by Colonel Clifford Heflin who picked up Dane, five USAAF pilots shot down by German forces, and two British signalmen9. Colonel Heflin later became commander of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit Special Airfield for the Manhattan Project and was awarded the Legion of Merit by Eisenhower, and the French Cross of War and Legion of Honor11.\n\nSAS HQ staff did not appreciate Boxer\u2019s refusal to repeat flying an RAF Lockheed Hudson into Bon Bon necessitating Colonel Heflin to fly in his C-47. SAS HQ telegrammed \u201cBulbaskets to you Boxer\u201d9,10. Boxer was later knighted. Boxer was technically correct: C-47s were more suited to Bon Bon. By December 1943, one C-47 was being produced in the United States every thirty minutes12 (Fig. 4).\n\nIn the spring of 1945, Dane took part in Operation Howard in which Regiment 1 of the SAS under Royal Ulster Rifleman Lieutenant Colonel Blair (Paddy) Mayne covered the 4th Canadian Armoured Division as they advanced to the Baltic through Northern Germany13. For exemplary heroism in bitter fighting, fellow Ulsterman Field Marshal Montgomery recommended fellow Ulsterman Mayne for the Victoria Cross. In his Memoirs, Montgomery writes \u201cIn the end we beat the Russians to L\u00fcbeck on the 2nd May 1945 and thus sealed off the Danish peninsula with about six hours to spare before the Russians arrived\u201d13 (Fig.5). Dane wrote for Field Marshal Montgomery one of three testimonials for Mayne\u2019s VC : finally it became, although almost unprecedented, a third bar to Mayne\u2019s DSO14,15,16,17.\n\nDane arrived at Clare College, Cambridge in October 1945 to read Honours Natural Science Tripos18,19. Unusual for an undergraduate, although he had been an active member of the Charterhouse Bird Club20. While at Clare, Dane published three different papers on epidemics in Manx shearwaters in Skomer and Skokholm islands off Pembrokeshire21,22,23 (Fig.6). The co-author of one paper was Michael G.P. Stoker, Dane\u2019s and later my* Clare Medical Tutor23,24,25 (Fig. 3). On 2 February 1948 Dane wrote from Clare College to Ibis about the severe outbreaks of \u201cdisease among juvenile Manx shearwaters, Puffinus, puffinus\u201d in 1946 and 194722. Juvenile Manx shearwaters develop blisters on webs of their feet and or conjunctivitis, frequently followed by early death before leaving their natal burrow25,26.\n\nIt has been estimated that approximately half of the world\u2019s Manx shearwaters are born on the coasts of St. George\u2019s and North Channels. The 300-acre Old Lighthouse Island, situated two-and-a-quarter miles off the coast from Donaghadee North Down, Northern Ireland, is the second most prolific site of hatching27.\n\nAbout five weeks after hatching, parents leave the area, and the offspring a week or so later. By banding it has been shown that Manx shearwaters migrate across the Atlantic to Brazil and the United States27,28. On the way they seem to rest and refresh at human watering holes like Biarritz and the beaches of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Currently, twenty-six are visiting Cape Cod, Massachusetts28. Manx shearwaters can take as little as twelve days to fly from Boston\u2019s Logan Airport area beaches to Northern Ireland or the West of Scotland\u2014roughly the same time duration as the 1846 news of the success of diethyl ether in anaesthesia and surgery29.\n\nAfter passing Conjoint in 1951 from St. Thomas\u2019s Hospital, Dane emigrated to Australia. In the spring of 1955, Dane returned from the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide18,19,30 to Clare and Cambridge, from which in 1955 he received an M.B., and I received a B.A. Also in 1955 David Surrey Dane married Veronica Tester Hope, a widow, with two children Kerin and Alex. This family of four moved forthwith to Belfast, where the Danes later had three additional children: Roland, Penelope and Thomas18,19. That same year, 1955, Dane joined Professor George Dick\u2019s Department at Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, where in the winter of 1956 they developed plans for a Virus Reference Laboratory which became operational within the year18,19,30,31. Dane also started a research programme \u201cwhich aimed at identifying human hepatitis viruses by electron microscopy\u201d32. In 1969, \u201csome doubted whether Australian antigen was specifically related to hepatitis B virus\u201d2. In a letter invited by Eugene Garfield to Current Contents in 1980, Dane wrote that he \u201cthought that [by the 1960s] EM and negative staining techniques had developed to the stage where they could be used by virologists\u201d32. Dane and his Belfast coworkers used specimens negatively stained with \u201c4% phosphotungstic acid at pH 6.5 and applied to formvar/carbon grids before examination in an A.E.I. EM 801 electron microscope\u201d3. Hepatitis B virus was found by Dane to be a particle 42 nm in diameter with DNA and DNA polymerase3,32, later eponymously named the \u201cDane particle\u201d32. Dane wrote that \u201cI never discovered whether the person who originally referred to it this way was a well-wisher who thought we were right or someone who hoped we were wrong\u201d32.\n\nIn 1978, 19 Manx shearwaters sick with puffinosis were transported live to Oxford from Skomer and Skokholm islands. A homogenate from each freshly decapitated bird was injected separately into Oxford Dunn Pathology mice randomly inbred since 1953. One to 3 day old suckling mice were injected intracerebrally and subcutaneously. Eight to 11 day old fertile hens\u2019 eggs were injected as also were various cell cultures.\n\nTwo days after inoculation, two of the mice showed clinical signs of infection, one with paralysis. Sera from the Manx shearwaters were not collected after inoculation due to \u201cdifficulties keeping the birds\u201d in Oxford26. The virus that was isolated differed from that found in 1948 by Stoker33. Probably the coronavirus at Oxford they discovered was from an Oxford Dunn School of Pathology mouse. Electron microscopy was non-diagnostic of puffinosis. Nuttal and Harrap, whose work was funded by the National Environment Research Council (NERC), stated \u201cWe are studying puffinosis because, unlike many epizootics in wild animal populations detailed investigation is possible\u201d26.\n\nAccording to Michael Stoker on a visit to me at Harvard Medical School34, David Dane thought that the Oxonians had wider aims. Stoker told me that the study had led to Clare discussions. Did Oxford want to allot to Manx shearwaters the role of carrier pigeons? Or were they manufacturing an opportunity to test their electron microscopy specimen preparation and imaging techniques? We concluded, said Stoker, we should not ascertain.\n\nWarsaw-born Wolf Szmuness, who had studied medicine in Italy, returned to his family in Poland after the 1939 German invasion. He then fled to the Soviet Union where he was confined to a Siberian labour camp at which he was eventually assigned duties of sanitation management and epidemiologic records. Post-release he received a medical degree from the University of Tomsk in 1950, an advanced scientific degree from the University of Kharkov in 1955 and an additional degree from the University of Lublin in 1964. In 1968 he left Poland with his family and emigrated to the United States where he met with Dr. Aaron Kellner, President of the New York Blood Center to discuss career prospects2,4. They consulted Barry Blumberg (Fig.1) and together decided that Szmuness should work as Kellner\u2019s technician. Wolf Szmuness published in 1980 on the efficacy of Blumberg anti-hepatitis B vaccine produced by Merck in a Controlled Clinical Trial in a high-risk New York Population5.\n\nMichael Stoker was born in Taunton, Somerset on 4 July 1918 just after his Corkonian physician father, Cork Medical School-educated, had returned from France with an M.C.24,35,36,37,38,39 and relocated the family to Market Harborough. Michael, aged 8, was sent as a boarder to Oakham and thence to Sidney Sussex, where the pre- Cromwellian silver fascinated him and Veronica English. They married in 1942, the year Michael passed conjoint. In 1943 Michael was sent as an RAMC Lieutenant to the 3rd/9th Ghurkas in Northern India39. Douglas Black, later PRCP, London, arranged for Stoker to enroll in a course in laboratory medicine run by William Haye, a bacterial geneticist in Poona. Together they studied virus activity in Herpes simplex and the bacterial antigenic variation of Rickettsiae. After World War II, Henry Thirkill, M.C., Master of Clare, called Michael Stoker and Veronica and their son to Clare, with Michael as Clare Medical Tutor for Honours Natural Science Tripos.\n\nFrom Clare, Michael Stoker expanded the horizons of H.R. Dean\u2019s Cambridge Department of Pathology. Stoker used electron microscopes in the Cavendish Laboratory of Rutherford and later Pippard40.\n\nAs we were Stoker\u2019s tutees our job was to educate Stoker: subjects such as Antigenicity versus Infectivity. Polymorphism\u2014\u201chave you chased the Beagle?\u201d What about the scientific verse of Grandfather Erasmus? What about Medical Management of the aftermath of the Quetta Earthquake? 41,42 Much of these discussions took place in Veronica\u2019s house, not at Clare.\n\nAfter I went down from Cambridge, Stoker, for decades would send me, his \u201cperpetual student\u201d, a postcard after I had published in the Scientific or Medical Literature. Nearly all messages were short. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d \u201cSurprising but believable\u201d. \u201cTalk to Aage Bohr\u201d. Re: our ICU and Thomas Huckle\u2014\u201cDo it\u201d43,44.\n\nIn 1961-1962 while I worked on \u201cimpaired oxygenation in surgical patients\u201d at Harvard45,46. Michael Stoker, now Professor of Virology at Glasgow, advised as to the management of viremia44. My Harvard Department Heads E.D. Churchill and H.K. Beecher47 along with M.G. Stoker declined co-authorships:\u201dthat is not our style\u201d44,46.\n\nAfter Clare, the Stokers had nine years in Glasgow, then California, then great success from 1968 at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories introducing Genetics and more fundamental Molecular Biology. Michael used to say his co-workers and tutees converted him from Virology to Cell Biology. Knighted in 198048, from London he and Veronica went back to head up Clare Hall for seven happy years. Then Michael returned to his Cambridge Pathology Laboratory to continue work on hepatitis B and hepatocellular cancer49,50,51,52.\n\nEach year an estimated 887,000 humans are killed by hepatitis B53; how many thousands of non-humans we do not know. Hepatitis B has solely infected humans and other hominidae and simian species for at least the last 7,000 years54,55. Currently hepatitis B infects 257 million people worldwide53,56. The \u201cNorthern Ireland Hepatitis B and C Managed Clinical Network\u201d has reported that Northern Ireland is a \u201cvery low prevalence country\u201d for hepatitis B57. Much progress has been made in vaccination of healthcare workers, as well as mothers and their offspring58,59.\n\nInvestigators from the Regional Virus Laboratory at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, with colleagues from the Liver Unit, Department of Genitourinary Medicine and HIV and the Public Health Agency of Northern Ireland have recently suggested a higher than expected rate of progression from acute to chronic hepatitis B among persons aged 50 and over in Northern Ireland60. Patients co-infected with HIV show hepatitis B chronicity rates as much as six times higher than hepatitis B patients who are HIV seronegative. While such co-infection is relatively rare in Northern Ireland, the overall aging of the population amid higher hepatitis B chronicity rates emphasizes the importance of vaccination and provision of accurate information to patients.60\n\n\u201cThis plague has come upon us by infection and will spread still further\u201d61 \u2020. Before you travel to foreign parts ascertain your vaccination status56.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Ms. Anna Sander, Archivist and Curator of Manuscripts, and Professor Seamus Perry, Balliol College Oxford, for assistance with permission to reproduce the portrait of Baruch S.
