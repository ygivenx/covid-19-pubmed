{"title": "Regulation of Immunogen Processing: Signal Sequences and Their Application for the New Generation of DNA-Vaccines", "body": "\nOne of the most promising vaccine types today are DNA\u2013vaccines. In its simplest form, a\nDNA\u2013vaccine is a plasmid containing a gene of the pathogenic protein and the elements\nneeded to transcribe this gene in mammalian cells. This DNA is introduced into mammalian cells\nduring immunization. It is then transcribed, and the encoded antigen is synthesized initiating\nan immune response (Fig. 1). Unlike protein\u2013based vaccines,\nDNA\u2013vaccines based on microbial genes and tumor antigens have the advantage of synthesizing the\nspecific antigen in the host\u2019s organism, where it is processed correctly to induce an immune\nresponse of the desired specificity. This approach is promising because of the simplicity and low cost\nof the production and transportation of DNA\u2013vaccines as compared to the traditional vaccines.\nMoreover, gene engineering allows an easy modification of DNA\u2013immunogens; new antigens\ncan be designed with properties predicted by  in silico  studies. The use of\nDNA\u2013vaccines causes some anxiety because of the possibility that the genetic material\ngets inserted into the host genome (insertional mutagenesis). However, the probability of this\nevent is extremely low. It is in the range of around 1\u20137 insertions per 150,000 nuclei,\nwhich is lower than the rate of the natural insertion mutation by a factor of 1,000 [1].\n\n\n\nDNA\u2013vaccines are used to induce a protective immune response against various infections\nin small animals (rodents) and in larger species [2\u20134]. Series of trials of\nprophylactic and therapeutic DNA\u2013vaccines against various human pathogens, including\nHIV\u20131 and HCV, have been performed [5\u20137]. However, the immunogenicity\nof genetic vaccines needs improvement, especially for human applications [8\u201310]. Various approaches are\nbeing used in order to increase the efficiency of DNA\u2013vaccines [11\u201313]. They include the\ndevelopment of novel methods of DNA\u2013vaccine administration (electroporation has become\nincreasingly popular in the recent years); supplementing vaccine formulation with cytokines\nand/or chemokines or their genes [14] ; optimizing\nplasmid vectors by selecting more effective gene promoters and regulatory elements [15] ; and modulating plasmid CpG content [14]. The DNA\u2013immunogen is also modified: the coding\nsequence of immunogen is often changed to increase the expression [16]. One of the most promising approaches for modifying the immunogen is to\nalter its processing and presentation pathway [17]. Such\nre\u2013direction can be achieved by \u201clabeling\u201d the protein with specialized\nsignal sequences.\n\n\n\nThis review focuses on the signals directing protein into various cellular compartments and\ntheir use for DNA\u2013vaccine design. In order to be recognized by the immune system, an\nantigen must be processed and presented on the surface of a cell by the molecules of the major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC). There are two main classes of these molecules: MHC class I\n(MHC\u2013I) and MHC class II (MHC\u2013II). In order to bind to the molecules of either\nclass, the protein encoded by DNA\u2013immunogen must go through antigen processing in the\nspecialized cell compartments (Table 1). Endogenous proteins are degraded in the proteasome and\nare presented in a complex with \u041c\u041d\u0421 \u2013I on the cell surface, where they\ncan be recognized by the receptors of cytotoxic CD8+ T\u2013cells (CTL), which then initiate a\ncytotoxic immune response [18]. Exogenous proteins are\nhydrolyzed by proteases in the lysosome, antigen fragments generated by processing are bound to\nMHC\u2013II molecules and recognized by the CD4\u2013receptors of T\u2013helper cells, which\nfacilitate cellular as well as humoral responses [19].\nThus, it is evident that the processing pathway of the immunogen determines the type of immune\nresponse it induces.\n\n\n\nAs has been mentioned earlier, processing of an antigen via the MHC\u2013I pathway results in\na CTL\u2013response. This process involves several steps (Fig. 2).\nThe protein is synthesized in the cell and then broken into small peptides in the proteasome,\nafter which these fragments are taken up by the transporter\u2013proteins associated with antigen\nprocessing (TAP). These proteins guide the peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),\nwhere they can bind to MHC\u2013I molecules [18].\n\n\n\nThe peptide\u2013MHC\u2013I complex is transported to the cell surface to be recognized by\nCD8+ T\u2013cells (CTL), manifesting the initiation of a cellular response. This is why\nincreasing the amount of the protein that is transported into the proteasome or\nER should in principle increase its presentation via MHC\u2013I pathway,\nhence, the availability on the cell surface resulting in an enhancement of the cellular\nresponse.\n\n\n\nTo be degraded by the proteasome, proteins must bear a specific signal \u2013 a chain of\nubiquitin molecules (Ub), small polypeptides consisting of 76 amino acid\nresidues. The eukaryotic cell has a specialized group of enzymes that recognize protein\nsubstrates and covalently attach polyubiquitin to these substrates. This enzymatic group is\ncalled the ubiquitin\u2013conjugating system [20].\n\n\n\nThis system recognizes various proteasome degradation signals. Signals can represent a\nspecific amino acid sequence, a specific pattern of protein phosphorylation, or alterations in\nthe protein structure, often missfolding. Several degradation signals with a characteristic\namino acid sequence have been described. The first signal discovered was the N\u2013degron.\nThis is a specific first amino acid residue in the protein that serves as a substrate for the\ncomplex of cellular enzymes responsible for labeling the protein with a polyubiquitine chain\n[21]. Amino acids differ in their capacity to be\nrecognized by the ubiquitinating enzymes (Table 2). There are also other degradation signals,\nsuch as the PEST\u2013sequence [22] and the Destruction\nBox [23], often found in the short\u2013lived cellular\nproteins (Table 2).The nature of the first amino acid residue in the protein is, thus, one of\nthe main protein features determining its accumulation.\n\n\n\nThe main focus of the researchers has been on the antigen (re)targeting into proteasome via\nthe ubiquitin\u2013dependent mechanism, thought to provide for antigen processing and\npresentation in complex with MHC\u2013I and an enhanced antigen\u2013specific\nCTL\u2013response [25\u201328]. This (re)direction can be achieved by cloning an\nUb\u2013encoding sequence onto the 5 \u00b4 \u2013terminus of the target gene and\nadding a destabilizing N\u2013terminal residue after the Ub, which makes an\nantigen a better proteasome substrate. In the cell, Ub is cleaved off in a\nposttranslational modification of the chimeric protein catalyzed by the C\u2013terminal\nubiquitin hydrolase, thus exposing the N\u2013degron. The HIV\u20131 nef was modified in this\nway to generate a Ub\u2013Arg\u2013Nef, which led to the improved\nimmunogenicity of nef in mice [29]. Fusion with\nubiquitin was used for immunization with HIV\u20131 gene expression libraries. All of the ORFs\n(open reading frames) of HIV\u20131 encoded by 32 plasmids were modified by the addition of an\nubiquitin encoding sequence. After a single immunization using gene gun, this library\nstimulated a strong T\u2013cell response against all 32 antigens. This response was registered\nas an enhanced CTL\u2013activity, IFN\u2013 \u03b3 + production by CD8+ T\u2013cells and\nHLA\u2013tetramer binding [30]. Addition of ubiquitin\nto the N\u2013terminus of a synthetic protein consisting of HIV CTL\u2013epitopes also\nresulted in the increase of immunogenicity of this prototype DNA\u2013vaccine [31].\n\n\n\nAn incorrect protein folding can also act as the proteasome degradation signal. This was used\nto increase the immunogenicity of the influenza virus proteins M1 and NS1. Unstable variants of\nM1 and NS1 were constructed by disrupting their alpha\u2013helical regions via introduction of\nshort (foreign) amino acid sequences. Immunization by the genes of the destructured M1 and NS1\nresulted in a much stronger CTL\u2013response than that induced by the original genes [32].\n\n\n\nHowever, for some viral proteins, fusion with the proteasome\u2013targeting signals did not\nresult in an increased degradation [27, 33]. The HIV\u20131 Gag protein modified by ubiquitination\nand by a destabilizing N\u2013terminal arginine residue\n(Ub\u2013R\u2013Gag) showed only a slight increase in the degradation rate.\nEffective destabilization of this protein required an insertion of the additional exposed\nlysine residue eK (Ub\u2013R\u2013eK\u2013Gag). The\nUb\u2013R\u2013eK\u2013Gag chimera was effectively directed into the\nproteasome, which increased the presentation of MHC\u2013I\u2013antigen peptide complexes on\nthe cell surface. However, this did not significantly increase the anti\u2013Gag\nCTL\u2013response in mouse immunization [34]. Also, no\nenhancement in immunogenic performance was observed after a similar modification of\nDNA\u2013immunogen expressing nucleocapsid (core) protein of Hepatitis C virus\n(HCV). HCV core genes carrying cleavable, as well as uncleavable ubiquitin\nresidues with N\u2013stabilizing or N\u2013destabilizing amino acid residues, were equally\npoor immunogens [35]. Other (viral) models were\ndescribed for which an increase in the proteasomal degradation did not result in an increased\nprotective immunity [34].\n\n\n\nNotably, some proteins do not require ubiquitin for degradation [36]. The first such protein to be discovered was ornithine decarboxylase\n(ODC) [37]. Its degradation is\nATP\u2013 and antizyme\u2013protein\u2013dependent. The C\u2013terminus of the antizyme\nbinds to the N\u2013terminal region of ODC, directing it to the proteasome\nwhile the antizyme is released. In addition to the antizyme\u2013binding site on the\nN\u2013terminus, ODC contains also a C\u2013terminal PEST\u2013signal\n[38]. Experiments with deletion mutants of\nODC have shown that the minimal signal required for the rapid degradation of\nODC in the proteasome is a 37\u2013residue C\u2013terminal stretch of amino\nacids [39]. It was demonstrated that this region is\nrequired for binding of ODC to the proteasome.\n\n\n\nThe ubiquitin\u2013conjugating system is a multi\u2013stage mechanism with a complex\nregulation. The use of protein degradation signals, which direct proteins to the proteasome via\nan ubiquitin\u2013independent mechanism, circumvents the effects of a multitude of factors and\nthus provides a more straight\u2013forward way of proteasome targeting. Fusion of HIV\u20131\nreverse transcriptase with the minimal proteasome\u2013targeting signals of\nODC represented by two short amino acid sequences at the ODC\nC\u2013terminus led to an accelerated degradation and an increased immunogenicity of the\nchimeric gene in mice as compared to the original gene [40]. This modification was also successful when applied to the weakly\nimmunogenic reverse transcriptase of drug\u2013resistant HIV\u20131 [41] helping to enhance both cellular and antibody immune responses against the\nmutant enzyme form [42].\n\n\n\nProcessing of an antigen via the \u041c\u041d\u0421 \u2013I pathway involves the\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER). That is why increasing the antigen\u2019s\naffinity towards ER can improve the immunogenic performance of the antigen.\nThe Ca2+\u2013binding protein calreticulin (CRT) is abundant in\nER, where it is associated with the components involved in the presentation of\nthe antigen via the \u041c\u041d\u0421 \u2013I pathway [43\u2013 45]. Fusion of calreticulin\nto the tumor antigens was used to improve the T\u2013cell immune response against tumor cells.\nA DNA\u2013vaccine that encoded a fusion of CRT with \u0415 7 protein of\nhuman papilloma virus 16 (HPV\u201316) was created. Mice immunized by this DNA\u2013immunogen\nexhibited a significant increase in the population of the E7\u2013specific CD8+ T\u2013cells\nand in their lytic activity against E7\u2013expressing tumors [46, 47]. A fusion\u2013protein of\nCRT with another HPV\u201316 protein E6 also improved the\nantigen\u2013specific CD8+ T\u2013cell immune response in mice [48].\n\n\n\nAltered localization of \u0415 7 HPV\u201316 protein associated with an increased affinity\nfor ER was also achieved by a different strategy that involved antigen fusion\nwith the extracellular domain of the Fms\u2013like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FL) [49]. The E7 gene fusion introduced subcutaneously by the gene\ngun technique led to a considerably increased capacity of E7 to activate specific CD8+\nT\u2013cells compared to the unmodified \u0415 7 gene.  In vitro  studies\nshowed that 293 cell lines transfected with FL\u2013E7 DNA presented \u0415 7 antigen in\ncomplex with MHC class I molecules more effectively than cells transfected with the original E7\ngene. The FL\u2013E7 chimera potently activated CD8+ T\u2013cells; anti\u2013tumor effect\nwas dependent on the CD4+ \u0422 \u2013cells [49].\nAnother successful case of enhancing the immune response by manipulating the\nER\u2013signals was reported for the envelope protein E2 of the hepatitis C\nvirus. The effect was achieved by duplication of the ER\u2013localization\nsequence, which promoted the accumulation and subsequent release of E2 from the endoplasmic\nreticulum [50].\n\n\n\nPeptides to be bound to MHC\u2013II are mainly of exogenous origin and are captured by\nendocytosis to be directed into the lysosomes (Fig. 3).\nHowever, it has been demonstrated that some intracellular proteins can be presented by\nMHC\u2013II as a result of autophagy [51]. Such\nproteins are transported into the lysosome via the chaperone\u2013mediated transfer carried\nout by a transport\u2013protein; by the engulfment of cytoplasm by the lysosome membrane, or\nby the formation of double\u2013membrane autophagosomes [51\u201355]. After transporting to the\nlysosomes, the antigen is cleaved by the acidic proteases and the resulting peptides are loaded\nonto the MHC\u2013II molecules and brought to the cell surface. On the cell surface, these\ncomplexes are recognized by the CD4+ T\u2013cell receptors [56]. This leads to the stimulation of cellular (Th1\u2013type) and humoral\n(Th2\u2013type) immunity.\n\n\n\nTraditional therapeutic vaccinations with soluble protein antigens aim to recruit CD4+\nT\u2013cells. The relatively weak response of CD4+ T\u2013cells is one of the weak points of\nDNA\u2013vaccines today. Clinical trials have also shown that the current generation of\nDNA\u2013vaccines cannot induce a strong antibody response [57]. Therefore, targeting of antigen presentation into the MHC\u2013II\npathway in order to activate CD4+ \u0422 \u2013cells seems especially advantageous. Such\ntargeting can be achieved artificially by supplementing immunogen with lysosome localization\nsignals.\n\n\n\nThe DNA\u2013antigen can be specifically (re)directed into lysosomes using protein sorting\nsignals. Such intracellular sorting signals can be found in the cytoplasm\u2013terminal\nregions of the transmembrane and lysosome\u2013associated proteins [24, 58, 59]. Most of them are short amino acid sequences and can be divided into the\ntyrosine\u2013 and dileucine\u2013bearing sequences [24, 60]. Tyrosine\u2013bearing signals\nhave a consensus motif NPXY or YXX (where X is any amino acid, and \u00d8 is an amino acid with a\nlarge hydrophobic side\u2013chain). The consensus sequence of the dileucine signals is\n(DE)XXXL(LI) or DXXLL. These signals are recognized by the adaptor protein AP or by related\ncomplexes and are then directed into the trans\u2013Golgi, to the plasmatic membrane, and\nfurther into the endosomes. There are other motifs, such as a cluster of acidic amino acids and\nthe NPFSD sequence [58]. A number of cellular proteins\nare directed into lysosomes due to the presence of a phosphorylated mannose residue attached to\nthe consensus sequence NX(ST) [61\u201363]. There are also signals that seem to direct cytoplasmic\nproteins into the lysosome via an autophagosome mechanism [64].\n\n\n\nIt has been shown that tyrosine\u2013 and dileucine signals can effectively direct\nheterologous proteins into the lysosome [19, 65, 66]. The most\nactively used signals targeting to MHC\u2013II presentation are those of the\nlysosome\u2013associated membrane protein 1(LAMP\u20131) [67]; invariant chain (Ii) [65], and the AP3\u2013 binding motif of the lysosome protein LIMP II [66].\n\n\n\nSorting signal of the lysosome\u2013associated protein 1 (LAMP\u20131)\ntargets the antigen to processing via the MHC\u2013II presentation pathway and enhances its\npresentation to CD4+ \u0422 \u2013cells, as has been shown in  in vitro \nexperiments. Mouse immunization experiments have demonstrated that LAMP\u20131gene chimeras\ninduced stronger lymphoproliferative activity, CTL\u2013activity and higher antibody titers as\ncompared to the nonmodified DNA\u2013immunogens. An increase in the Th2\u2013type immune\nresponse of CD4+ \u0422 \u2013cells in response to the LAMP\u20131 fusions\nwas shown after immunization with DNA encoding LAMP\u20131 fusions of\nHIV\u20131 gp160\u2013 and p55gag [68, 69]. A LAMP/gag DNA\u2013vaccine stimulated prolonged\nB\u2013, CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2013cell responses, while an immune response caused by the\ninjection of a nonmodified Gag gene rapidly receded [70]. Another successfully redirected cytoplasmic protein was the nucleocapsid\nprotein of the coronavirus SARS (sarsN). Immunization of mice with DNA\nencoding the LAMP\u20131\u2013sarsN chimera led to a balanced specific\nIFN\u2013\u03b3 and IL\u20134 production and strong CTL\u2013response against\nsarsN [66]. Also, fusion of\nHIV\u20131 reverse transcriptase with LAMP\u20131 improved the\nimmunogenicity of a prototype DNA\u2013vaccine against a drug\u2013resistant virus. A strong\nimmune response of the mixed Th1/Th2\u2013type was raised both against the wild and\ndrug\u2013resistant HIV\u20131 reverse transcriptases, circumventing tolerance of the immune\nsystem towards this conserved retroviral antigen [71].\n\n\n\nFusion with LAMP\u20131 increased the immunogenicity of DNA immunogens\nencoding flavivirus envelope proteins. In a candidate vaccine against Dengue virus type 2 based\non the DNA encoding the premembrane (preM) and envelope (E), the transmembrane and cytoplasmic\ndomains of E were replaced by similar domains of LAMP\u20131 [72;]. LAMP\u20131/preM\u2013E chimera\nexhibited a characteristic granular cytoplasmic staining that indicated co\u2013localization\nwith the endogenous LAMP\u20131, MHC\u2013II, and H2\u2013M proteins that\nwas not observed in the case of the nonmodified antigen. Mice immunized with the gene of the\nLAMP\u20131/preM\u2013E chimera exhibited a much higher level of\nneutralizing antibodies than the controls that received the parental preM\u2013E gene. A\nsimilar prototype DNA\u2013vaccine was designed against the West Nile virus. In this case, the\npremembrane and envelope (WN preM\u2013E) coding sequences were fused to the sequences\nencoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of LAMP\u20131 [73]. Mice immunized by the gene of the WN\nLAMP\u20131/preM\u2013E chimera responded by a long\u2013lasting production\nof high titers of neutralizing antibodies, while DNA encoding the original antigen induced a\nshort\u2013termed low\u2013titer antibody response. Altogether, these results provide a basis\nfor creating a panel of effective DNA\u2013vaccines against flaviviruses.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of the HPV\u201316 \u0415 7 protein gene, fused to the sequence encoding\nLAMP\u20131, also increased the Th2\u2013type immune response [74]. Introduction of a secretory variant of\nE7/LAMP\u20131 in the form of a DNA\u2013chimeric recombinant virus induced\na strong anti\u2013tumor immune response, which prevented the formation of tumors and reduced\nthe size of the ones already present [75].\n\n\n\nThere are, however, few unsuccessful cases of applying this modification to the cytoplasmic\nproteins, as in the case of the nucleocapsid protein of HCV and of p53 [35, 76]. A plasmid was\nconstructed expressing a chimeric fusion protein of HCV nuclecapsid protein\nwith signal\u2013 and C\u2013terminal LAMP\u20131 sequences. Immunization\nof mice with this construct did not lead to any detectable antibody response or cell\nproliferation and induced only weak CTL\u2013activity [35]. Thus, direction into the lysosome by fusing the immunogen to\nLAMP\u20131 does not necessarily ensure an enhancement of the Th\u20132 type\nimmune response.\n\n\n\nMHC\u2013II molecules require transportation into the lysosome compartment. This transport\ninvolves the invariant chain of MHC class II molecules (Ii) [77]. Two sorting signals were found in the cytoplasmic domain of Ii [65, 77, 78]. It was shown that endogenously synthesized proteins,\nnormally not presented via the MHC\u2013II pathway, can be effectively presented by\nMHC\u2013II if fused to Ii [79]. Numerous experiments\nin the animal models demonstrated that fusion of the recombinant antigens to Ii can enhance,\nbroaden, and prolong the protective immune response to the resulting chimeric\nDNA\u2013vaccines.  In vitro  and  in vivo  experiments had\nshown that immunogens based on an adenovirus expressing fusion of Ii with the glycoprotein of\nlymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) had an increased ability to\nstimulate LCMV\u2013specific CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2013cells. Moreover, mice that\nhad been immunized by this plasmid only once were resistant to the infection by the lethal\nLCMV dose [80].\n\n\n\nThis approach is also effective for immunization of larger species. A DNA\u2013construct was\nmade encoding the major surface protein 1a of  Anaplasma marginale  fused with\nthe lysosome\u2013targeting motif of the bovine Ii, which directed the chimera into the\nlysosome compartment [81]. A single dose of this plasmid\neffectively stimulated an immune response seen as a potent proliferation of IFN\u2013 \u03b3\n+/CD4+ T\u2013cells and production of specific IgG. A single injection of this construct\ninduced antigen specific memory cells, which formed the basis for an accelerated response to\nrepeated doses of the antigen [81].\n\n\n\nThe precise mechanisms behind autophagy are yet unknown despite the intensive ongoing studies.\nWith regard to antigen retargeting, it was shown that fusion of the\nautophagosome\u2013associated protein Atg8/LC3 with the influenza virus matrix protein 1 leads\nto a considerable increase in the MHC class II presentation and in the M1\u2013specific\nresponse of CD4+ T\u2013cells [82]. This confirms that\nautophagy constantly and effectively directs cytoplasmic proteins into presentation via the MHC\nclass II pathway, where they can be used to stimulate a \u0422 \u2013helper response.\n\n\n\nAn effective approach to the induction of a T\u2013helper immune response is targeting of\nproteins for secretion into the extracellular environment. Fusion of HIV\u20131 Gag and E\nproteins to the secretory chemokine MCP3 directed these viral proteins into the secretory\npathway. Chimeric genes induced an effective production of anti\u2013HIV\u20131 antibodies in\nmacaques. Macaques immunized with the chimeras and infected with a pathogenic SIVmac251 had\nlower viral loads than the infected na \u00ef ve animals [83]. This is an example of the conversion of an endogenous antigen into the\nexogenous, for further capture by endocytosis and transfer to the lysosomes. This pathway, as\nwell as the endogenous lysosome (re)targeting, enhances antigen presentation in complex with\nthe MHC class II molecules and can considerably increase the immunogenicity of\nDNA\u2013vaccines.\n\n\n\nToday, mankind faces an acute problem of creating vaccines against such hazardous diseases as\nhepatitis C, the immunodeficiency caused by HIV\u20131, and cancer. DNA\u2013vaccine\ntechnology opens a wide range of possibilities for creating effective vaccines, one such is\nthrough immunogen (re)targeting. In this paper, we reviewed a number of signal sequences that\ncan be introduced into the immunogens to direct them into a predetermined processing and\npresentation pathway, usually different from the one they would naturally take. Direction of an\nantigen into the MHC\u2013I presentation pathway would enhance the cytotoxic \u0422\n\u2013cell response, while direction onto the MHC\u2013II pathway would activate\nT\u2013helper cells and stimulate both cellular and humoral responses. Overall, the use of\nsignal sequences to control and guide immunogen presentation can increase the immunogenic\npotential of the existing DNA\u2013immunogens and help to create new effective prophylactic\nand therapeutic vaccines for diverse human applications.\n"}
