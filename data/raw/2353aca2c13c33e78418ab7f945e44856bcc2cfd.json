{"title": "", "body": "The primary stage of every successful gene expres sion study for investigations such as functional genom ics, gene therapy and gene regulation or pathway anal ysis requires an efficient and optimized method of transfection of nucleic acids (usually in the form of plasmid DNA) into specified mammalian cells [1, 2] . Although currently several biological (virus mediated) and non biological (including chemical and physical) transfection methods are available, for every individ ual cell type the supreme method which should be effi cient and reproducible with minimum cell toxicity, needs to be optimized and selected experimentally through comparative studies [2] . Chemical transfec tion protocols are the most widely used methods in research which employ cationic polymers, calcium phosphate and cationic lipids with almost similar functional mechanisms [3] . Briefly, positively charged chemicals make complex with negatively charged nucleic acids and the complex subsequently is fused to the negatively charged cell membrane followed by passing through via endocytosis or phagocytosis [1, 2] . Cell confluency and reagent/DNA ratio are two main parameters that should be optimized for the cell types 1 The article is published in the original. under study when chemical transfection methods are being employed [4] . Besides, the total volume of the transfection medium is suggested to have some minor effects on the efficiency of transfection when chemical methods are being used [4] . The physical transfection methods such as gene gun or electroporation (which is the most widely used technique) make use of physical tools to deliver nucleic acids into cells [1] . Although the exact mechanism of electroporation is unknown, it is supposed that short electrical pulse makes some holes in the cell membrane through which nucleic acids can go across [5] . Since the electrical pulse induces a high degree of cell death, minimal amount of cell death as well as highest gene transfer efficiency are provided by optimization of the electric field strength and pulse length for each cell type [6] . In addition, some early studies indicated that post trans fectional chilling of the cells to 0\u00b0C [6] or utilization of electroporation buffers containing dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO 1.25%) during and for 24 h after the pulse [7] may improve transfection efficiencies.\n\nHuh 7 is an immortal and well differentiated hepa tocyte derived cellular carcinoma cell line that was originally taken from a liver tumor [8] . These cells have application in various studies, especially under standing of hepatic disease at the cellular and molecu\n\nA Comparative Study 1 CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS Vol. 46 No. 6 2012 lar levels [9, 10] . The Vero cell line was initiated from the kidney of a normal adult African green monkey. These cells are being used in different studies such as; screening for the toxin of Escherichia coli [11] , as host cells for a wide range of viruses including polio, arbo viruses and retroviruses as well as host cells for eukary otic parasites [12, 13] .\n\nA few comparative studies have already addressed the transfection efficiency of several chemical reagents to the electroporation using numerous cell types such as primary and transformed airway epithelial cells, pri mary fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, HEK 293, primary hematopoietic stem cells [4] , embryonic stem cells [14] [15] and primary human corneal endothelial cells [16] . However, there is no report (to our knowledge) on optimization and comparing efficiency of elec troporation to chemical transfection systems for Huh 7 and Vero cell lines.\n\nIn the present study, we provide data of a detailed study on optimization of transfection condition (based on transfection of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) harboring plasmid DNA; pGFPN1) for two chemical transfection reagents including one cationic polymer based reagent (jetPEI TM ) and one cationic lipid based reagent (Lipofectamine TM 2000) compared to elec troporation in Huh 7 and Vero cell lines and present an efficient transfection protocol.\n\nCell culturing. The human hepatoma (Huh 7) (Invitrogen, USA) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines (National Cell Bank of Iran, Tehran) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Biosera) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) and antibiotics (0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin) (Biosera). Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO 2 .\n\nPlasmid preparation. To monitor the efficiency of transfection, pEGFP N1 plasmid DNA (NRGB, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran) encoding Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein was employed through all experiments of this study. The vector was purified from cultured transformed bacteria using plasmid purifica tion Maxi kit (QIAGEN, USA) according to the man ufacturer's protocols. The mean A260/280 ratio of the DNA samples isolated from both cell lines was 1.8 \u00b1 0.045 (n = 3).\n\nTransfection methods. Two commercially available transfection reagents including jetPEI TM (Polyplus, France) and Lipofectamine TM 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) were used for transfection based on the manu facturer's protocols. Each experiment was performed three times.\n\nFor electroporarion, after washing two times in ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), cells were resuspended at 1.1 \u00d7 10 8 /mL in RPMI 1640 + 10 mM HEPES. 5 \u00b5g of DNA was mixed with 0.09 mL of Huh 7 or Vero cell suspensions, transferred to a 4 mm gapped cuvette and immediately pulsed using a Gene Pulser Xcell (BioRad, Germany). The cells were sub sequently diluted into 10 mL prewarmed complete growth media (DMEM 15% FBS) and plated in 75 cm 2 flask and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for 48 hours [4] . For all studies, untransfected cells (mock) were included as negative (reference) control. Each experi ment was performed three times.\n\nEvaluation of transfection efficiency. To determine the proportion of fluorescent cells (i.e. transfected cells), the cells were sorted by a Partec PAS instrument (Germany) and samples were evaluated by FlowMax software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Briefly, twenty four hours after transfection via chemical based reagents or 48 h after transfection by electroporation, the cells were harvested by trypsinization. After centrif ugation, the cells were resuspended at 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL in DMEM medium. To identify the GFP positive cells, untransfected cells (mock) were used as the GFP negative control to set the gates. Subsequently the gated region was analyzed for green fluorescence (488-508 nm) on a Partec PAS instrument supplied with a 6 W argon laser tuned to 488 nm at 100 mW out put power. The percentage of the total cells displaying GFP emission in the gated region was expressed as transfection efficiency.\n\nGFP fluorescent images of transfected cells were acquired using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, London, UK) with a 10\u00d7 lens and digital images were collected using a digital camera.\n\nTo obtain the optimized cell conflu ency for the highest transfection efficiency 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 \u00d7 10 3 Huh 7 cells were seeded per well (in 24 well plates) twenty four hours before transfection. Different reagent/DNA ratios (based on the manufac turers' recommendation) were also considered to screen the highest efficiency. As shown in Fig. 1a , the highest transfection efficiency using Lipofectamine TM 2000 was obtained when 60 \u00d7 10 3 cells were seeded and the transfection reagent/DNA ratio was 4 \u00b5L/0.8 \u00b5g (results for other cell confluencies are not shown). In this optimized condition, the highest transfection effi ciency was 12.2% for Huh 7 cells (Fig. 1b) .\n\nDifferent cell confluencies for Huh 7 cells (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 \u00d7 10 3 ) and Vero cells (10, 20, 30, 40 , 50, 60 and 80 \u00d7 10 3 cells) were seeded per well (in 24 well plates) twenty four hours before jetPEI transfection. Different reagent/DNA ratios (based on the manufac turers' recommendation) were also considered to screen the highest efficiency. As shown in Figs. 1c, 1e the highest transfection efficiency using jetPEI TM was obtained when 60 \u00d7 10 3 and 20 \u00d7 10 3 Huh 7 and Vero Vol. 46 No. 6 2012 cells were seeded, respectively. While the transfection reagent/DNA ratio was 4 \u00b5L/2 \u00b5g for both cell lines (results for other cell confluencies are not shown). In this optimized condition, the highest transfection effi ciencies were 14.2 and 28% for Huh 7 and Vero cells, respectively (Figs. 1d, 1f) . We also investigated if the total volume of medium per well during chemical transfection would affect the Optimization of transfection efficiency via electropo ration. According to prior studies, application of the square wave and low field strengths (500-2000 V/cm) together with long time constants (10-30 ms) pro vided the highest transfection efficiencies in mamma lian cell types [6] . Besides, low resistance buffers like PBS or culture medium are shown to be the optimal media for efficient electrotransfection of these cell types [6] . Accordingly, to obtain the condition in which cell death and electroporation efficiency are approximately equilibrated, we employed square wave form and evalu ated different low field strengths (400, 425, 450, 625, 750 V/cm corresponding to: 160, 170, 180, 250, 300 volts for a 4 mm gapped cuvette, respectively) as well as two different long pulse lengths (20 and 40 ms) for both cell lines (Fig. 2a) . Results indicated that the optimal electroporation condition for Huh 7 cells (electric field strength and pulse length of 425 V/cm and 40 ms respec tively) led to 63.73 \u00b1 2.36% transfection efficiency while the optimal condition for Vero cells (625 V/cm and 20 ms) resulted in 73.9 \u00b1 1.6% transfec tion efficiency (Figs. 2b, 2c) . Furthermore the cell viability 24 h after plasmid delivery was similar and more than 50% for both cell lines (data not shown).\n\nTo investigate the temperature effect on the elec troporation efficiency of Huh 7 cells, the cuvette con taining the electroporated cells was incubated on ice for 5 min before transferring to the growth medium. After 48 h, green fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry and compared to those cells transferred to the medium immediately after pulsing. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that chilling the Huh 7 cells to 0\u00b0C post transfectionally led to a significant decrease in cell viability by 40% (data not shown). Moreover, to evaluate the effect of DMSO on elec troporation efficiency, a final concentration of 1.25% was included into electroporation buffer during and for 24 h after the application of the pulse. Results showed a decrease in electroporation efficiency and cell survival of Huh 7 cells by 60% and 50% respec tively (data not shown).\n\nHuh 7 and Vero cells are two immortalized cell sys tems in two different mammalian species (human and monkey respectively) that are particularly important for characterization of hepatitis viruses molecular mechanisms (Huh 7) [8, 10, 17] or as host cells for a wide range of viruses and eukaryotic parasites (Vero cells) [11] [12] [13] . The Huh 7 and Vero cell lines have been employed in number of prior studies and have been transfected via different transfection reagents or electroporation in separate set of experiments. However, the previous reports did not provided an optimized transfection protocol for these important cell types [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This is specially important for Huh 7 which is generally known as a difficult to trans fect cell line [23] and when high rates of transfection efficiencies are determinant for the aim of the study. Previously the elegant study of Uchida and co workers [24] based on a comparative analysis for the transfec tion efficiency and cytotoxicity of six non viral chem ical reagents (Lipofectin, Lipofectamine plus, Super fect, Effectene, DMRIE C and DOTAP) intended for a wide range of human cells including Huh 7 was reported. Results of this study indicated efficient transfection of Huh 7 cells by \"Lipofectamine plus\" and \"Effectene\" compared to other reagents (with some strong cytotoxicity for \"Effectene\"). However there is no report to compare the efficiency of trans fection between chemical methods and electropora tion in Huh 7 and Vero cells as well as provide an opti mized and practical protocol of transfection for these cell types.\n\nIn the present study we compared two commer cially available transfection reagents including \"Lipo fectamine TM 2000\" (as a cationic liposome) and \"jet PEI TM \" (as a cationic polymer). Optimization of the parameters in both cell lines resulted in the transfec tion efficiencies of 12.2 \u00b1 0.6% in case of \"Lipo fectamine TM 2000\" for Huh 7 cells and 14.2 \u00b1 0.69 and 28 \u00b1 1.11% in case of \"jetPEI TM \" for Huh 7 and Vero cells, respectively. Although these transfection efficiencies are comparable with the results reported by Uchida et al. [24] , the slightly lower transfection efficiency of Huh 7 cells using \"Lipofectamine TM 2000\" (12.2 \u00b1 0.6%) in our study compared to \"Lipo fectamine plus\" used by Uchida et al. might be rele vant to the addition of the DNA compacting agent to cationic lipids in \"Lipofectamine plus\" composition [24] . In agreement to this suggestion, addition of DNA compacting peptides derived from human sequence to cationic lipid agents were previously shown to enhance the gene transfer efficiencies in vitro and in vivo [25] .\n\nEndocytosis is considered as the preferred route of cell entry of nonviral complexes and cargos via chem ical transfection methods [26] . The efficiency of cargo transfer by endocytic pathway itself (and therefore the transfection efficiency of chemical methods) is highly dependent on the cell line type and specific character istics of the chemical reagent (polyplex or lipoplex) used as carrier [27, 28] . Different transfection effi ciencies obtained in our study for Huh 7 and Vero cells (14.2 \u00b1 0.69% versus 28 \u00b1 1.11% respectively) in spite of employing the same reagent (jetPEI TM as a polyplex reagent) clearly indicated the effect of the cell type in utilizing different endocytic pathways. Indeed, previous findings suggested that the same chemical reagent (poly plex) may be internalized by different cell lines through various endocytic pathways leading to different transfec tion efficiencies. Of note, it is suggested that in Hela and 293 cells the caveolae dependent endocytic pathway leads to effective transfection by polyplex reagent [29] while clathrin mediated endocytosis is the main endocytic pathway in Huh 7 and COS 7 cells when the same chemical reagent (polyplex) is employed for trans fection [30] . Therefore, our results for the observed dif ferences in the transfection efficiencies between Vero and Huh 7 cells in case of polyplex reagent may be related to the different fates of this reagent through endocytic path ways in these two cell lines.\n\nWe also improved electroporation protocols for gene delivery into these two cell lines by optimizing the electric field strength and pulse length. In accordance with previous reports the square wave form provides higher mammalian transfection efficiencies and is widely used for in vitro and in vivo applications [31] . Therefore, square wave pulsing was employed in our study. In addition reports using electroporation to transfect mammalian cells either employed high field strengths and short pulse length or using lower field strengths and longer pulse length [31] . However, later studies showed that higher levels of expression could be obtained by the latter [6] . Our results showed that high efficiencies as well low cell death were obtained with low field strengths and long time constants con dition in both cell lines. CYTOLOGY Effect of cold treatment on electrotransfection effi ciency of Huh 7 cell was also addressed in our study. Few prior reports have indicated that post transfec tional chilling of the cells to 0\u00b0C increase the transfec tion efficiency of some cell types (apparently due to keeping the membrane pores open for longer time which subsequently provides more time for DNA to enter the cell) [6] . On the contrary immediate trans ferring of electroporated cells to pre warmed medium have been suggested for other cell types to increase cell survival (probably via helping the pores created to be resealed) [6] . Our results in accordance with the later report demonstrated that post transfectionally chill ing of the Huh 7 cells increased cell death by 40%. We also assessed the potential role of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) on electrotransfection efficiency of Huh 7 cell in our study. DMSO has been reported to enhance the transfection efficiencies of DNA introduced by polycations including polybren and DEAE [32, 33] as well as calcium phosphate method [34] . It is suggested that DMSO enhances the uptake of DNA by aug menting cell membrane permeabilization and the osmotic shock [34] . However, the concentration of DMSO for efficient transfection is critical and should be determined experimentally for each cell line. In fact optimal concentration of DMSO for one cell line may be toxic for another one. This fact was previously reported for chemical transfection of human epidermal keratinocytes and muine NIH 3T3 cells by polybrene reagent in which the optimal concentration of DMSO for highest transfection efficiencies of the cells were 27 and 15% respectively [35] . According to previous study, improvement in electrotrans fection efficiency and cell viability in four different cell lines (HL60, TR146, COS 7 and L132) using electroporation buffer containing DMSO (1.25%) during and for 24 h after the pulse was reported [7] . Accordingly in our study Huh 7 cells were electroporated in buffer (media) containing 1.25% DMSO when other param eters were kept in optimized condition. However this modification decreased the electroporation efficiency and cell survival of Huh 7 cells by 60 and 50%, respec tively (data not shown). This result was not surprising and may indicate the toxic effect of 1.25% DMSO on Huh 7 cells. Further experiments are required to access the specific concentration of DMSO for Huh 7 cells in which cell permeability increase is balanced with cell viability decrease. In addition, concentration of plasmid DNA might be an important parameter for electrotransfection efficiencies that should be deter mined experimentally for each cell type. Application of 1-10 \u00b5g plasmid was suggested in different elec trotransfection studies [6, 36] . In our study 5 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA (as a mean concentration and starting point) was used throughout all experiments. Although, it may be possible to further increase the transfection efficiencies obtained in this study by optimizing DMSO and plasmid DNA concentrations, the achieved effi ciencies (63.73 and 73.9% for Huh 7 and Vero cells, respectively) are good enough to satisfy most of the experimental applications requiring high trans fection efficiencies of these two cell types.\n\nFinally, in complete agreement with a recent report by Maurisse et al. [4] which indicated the superiority of electroporation/nucleofection to chemical methods for DNA delivery into primary and transformed mamma lian cells from different lineage, our results also showed that electrotransfection was the suprime method for Huh 7 and Vero cells. The mechanism for this superiority of electroporation compared to chem ical methods should lie on the direct delivery of the plasmid DNA into the cytosol and passing though the endocytic pathways as previously suggested [37] .\n\nIn summary, to best of our knowledge, we provided data of the first comparative study on optimization of transfection condition by electroporation and chemical methods for Huh 7 and Vero cells. These data indicated the superiority of electroporation to chemical methods for DNA delivery into Huh 7 and Vero cells. According to our results, application of 60 \u00d7 10 3 Huh 7 cells and transfection reagent/DNA ratios of 4 \u00b5L/0.8 \u00b5g and 4 \u00b5L/2 \u00b5g in a total volume of 500 \u00b5L provided trans fection efficiencies of 12.2% \u00b1 0.6 and 14.2% \u00b1 0.69 in case of \"Lipofectamine TM 2000\" and \"jetPEI TM \" reagents, respectively. While application of the later reagent provided 28% efficiency using 20 \u00d7 10 3 Vero cells and transfection reagent/DNA ratio of 4 \u00b5L/2 \u00b5g in a total volume of 150 \u00b5L. Alternatively, electro poration of both cells at a density of 1.1 \u00d7 10 8 \u00b5L in RPMI+10 mM HEPES buffer in the presence of 5 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA and application of electric field strength and pulse length of \"425 V/cm and 40 ms for Huh 7\" cells and \"625 V/cm-20 ms for Vero cells\" resulted to transfection efficiencies of 63.73 \u00b1 2.36 and 73.9 \u00b1 1.6% for these two cell lines, respectively. The presented protocols should satisfy most of the experimental applications required high transfection efficiencies of these two cell types.\n\nA.H received a fellowship from graduate school of Pasteur Institute to pursue this study in the Ph.D. pro gram.
