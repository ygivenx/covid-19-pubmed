{"title": "Multiple Contact Dates and SARS Incubation Periods", "body": "I used published data reporting possible incubation periods for 17 patients (6,7) plus data from two case-patients in an unpublished database maintained at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data illustrate a common problem: many patients have multiple possible incubation periods. I built a simulation model in a standard computer spreadsheet (Excel 2000, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) (See Appendix). I first listed each possible incubation period for every patient for whom incubation period data were available (Table). Then, for every patient, I assigned a random number generator (function RAND in Excel software) to each possible incubation period. This method is the equivalent of using a uniform distribution to select an incubation period from all possible choices. Using a spreadsheet-based simulation software package (@Risk, Palisade Corp., Newfield, NY), I programmed the spreadsheet to run iterations of the model.\n\nDuring a single iteration, for each patient, the programmed model selects the incubation period with the highest random number for that iteration. After a single iteration, the program calculates the frequency distribution for the incubation periods. Then, the program assigns another set of random numbers to each possible incubation period and selects and calculates the frequency distribution. After numerous iterations, the program combines all the frequency distributions from all iterations to provide a general frequency distribution. From this final frequency distribution, descriptive statistics can be obtained, such as the mean, median, 5th and 95th percentile values. I ran approximately 10,000 iterations, at which point each additional iteration caused the mean and the standard distribution for each possible day of incubation to change by <1%.\n\nThe three largest mean frequencies of incubation periods among the patients examined were 2, 3, and 6 days (Figure 1). Incubation periods of 1, 4, 5, and 10 days were the second highest mean frequencies (Figure 1). However, the confidence intervals (5th and 95th percentiles) for most of the potential incubation periods clearly overlapped (Figure 1). This finding indicates that with the given data set, an incubation period of 10 days is almost as likely to occur as an incubation period of 6 days. Using the mean frequency of each incubation period, I constructed a cumulative frequency graph (Figure 2). The 95th percentile is 12 days, with a median (50th percentile) of approximately 4 days.\n\nThe incubation period for SARS is likely to be varied, with the frequency distribution being nonnormal (Figure 1). Thus, using mean incubation periods for activities such as mathematical modeling will probably result in a misrepresentation of SARS transmission. The type of analysis presented here can help public health officials determine minimum quarantine periods for persons exposed to SARS, who are not yet symptomatic. For example, public health authorities should be aware that in a small percentage of case-patients, the incubation period might be >10 days (Figure 2).\n\nGiven that data from only 19 patients were available for this analysis, some caution should be exercised when evaluating the results. Adding or subtracting relatively small numbers of patients can cause estimates such as the 95th percentile of the cumulative frequency to change. More data concerning the possible incubation period of SARS patients are needed. The advantage of the method used here is that such data need not be specific. The method readily \u201caccepts\u201d data in which patients have multiple possible incubation periods. More data will likely reduce the confidence intervals for the frequencies of each incubation day (Figure 1), giving a clearer picture of the actual frequency distribution of all incubation periods.\n\nThe method can also be readily adapted to examine other aspects of SARS epidemiology when unambiguous data are scarce. For example, with the appropriate data, this method can be used to examine the frequency distribution of when an infectious person infects other people. (An Excel workbook [Excel 2000, Microsoft, Corp, Redmond, WA] containing the model used to calculate the results shown in Figures 1 and 2, and using the data shown in the Table, is available in the Appendix). Also, distributions of incubation periods can be used to examine whether an association exists between incubation period and likelihood of hospitalization or death."}
