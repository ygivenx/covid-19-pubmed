{"title": "Synthesis and Toxicity Evaluation of Some N4-Aryl Substituted 5-Trifluoromethoxyisatin-3-thiosemicarbazones", "body": "Much interest has been shown in isatin and its derivatives due to their diversified pharmacological properties including antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, antineoplastic, antiviral, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory and enzymatic inhibition activities [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Amongst isatin derivatives, isatin-thiosemicarbazones have been found to demonstrate numerous chemotherapeutic properties such as anticancer, antimicrobial, antituberculosis, antiulcer, antiviral, antiplasmodial, cytotoxic and enzymatic inhibition [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,12,19,20]. Prompted by this and in continuation of our work on bioactive isatin derivatives [21,22,23,24,25], it was of interest to synthesize some new isatin-3-thiosemicarbazones, which may exhibit better or different types of biological properties. It is pertinent to mention that a number of N4-aryl substituted isatin-derived thiosemicarbazones, prepared earlier in our laboratory, displayed different biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, phytotoxic and urease inhibition [22,23,24,25]. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in the synthesized N4-aryl substituted isatin-3-thiosemicarbazones revealed that in certain cases, the nature and position of different substituents about the phenyl ring attached to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety [22,23,25] and/or the presence of an inductively electron-withdrawing nitro group at position-5 of the isatin scaffold [24] played an important role in the inducement or enhancement of different activities. Furthermore, it has been reported by some other workers that certain N4-aryl substituted 5-nitroisatin-3-thiosemicabazones exhibit more cytotoxic activity than their alkyl and alkenyl counterparts [26]. Also, N4-aryl substituted 5-bromoisatin-3-thiosemicabazones have been found to show favourable cytotoxicity [27]. In view of this, it was envisaged that the combined effect of substitution of different inductively electron-attracting groups at position-5 of the isatin part and the attachment of a variety of aryl substituents to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety would result in increased toxic activity. Thus, the present work to synthesize some title thiosemicarbazones and screen them for their toxicity potential by a brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality bioassay was accomplished. This work describes the effects of the nature of aryl groups (modified by placement of one, two, or three substituents about the phenyl ring) attached to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety as well as the presence of trifluoromethoxy substituent at position-5 of the isatin scaffold on the toxicity potential of these compounds.\n\n5-Trifluoromethoxyisatin 1 was reacted with appropriate N-substituted thiosemicarbazides 2 in aqueous ethanol (50%) containing a catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid to give the corresponding 5-trifluoromethoxyisatin-3-thiosemicarbazones 3a-3u (Scheme 1) in moderate to excellent yields (50\u201393%). The structures of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of their analytical (CHN) and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) data. Satisfactory elemental analysis (\u00b10.4% of theoretical values) was obtained for all compounds, except where noted otherwise. The IR spectra of 3a-3u showed the absorption bands of NH stretching in the 3354\u20133200 and 3196\u20133055 cm\u22121 regions. The absorption bands of lactam C=O, azomethine C=N and thioamide C=S stretchings appeared in the 1705\u20131692, 1629\u20131564 and 1182\u20131143 cm\u22121 regions, respectively [26,28,29,30]. The 1H-NMR spectra of 3a-3u displayed three separate singlets at \u03b4 10.45\u201311.07, \u03b4 11.39\u201311.48 and \u03b4 12.58\u201312.81 attributed to thiosemicarbazone N4-H, indole NH and thiosemicarbazone N2-H, respectively [26,28,31,32]. The electron impact mass spectra (EIMS) of the synthesized thiosemicarbazones demonstrated molecular ions of different intensities, confirming their molecular weights. Compounds 3r and 3u did not display molecular ion peaks in their mass spectra; however, the fragments corresponding to thiosemicarbazone part of the molecules, formed by N-N and NH-CS bond rupture, confirmed their structures. X-ray structures of two representative examples 3k and 3t were determined in order to confirm the assigned structures and establish conformations of the synthesized thiosemicarbazones 3a-3u. Relevant crystal data and details of structural elucidation have been reported elsewhere [33,34].\n\nAll the synthesized thiosemicarbazones 3a-3u were screened for toxic activity by a brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality bioassay. The compound 2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)-N-phenyl-1-hydrazinecarbothioamide, whose synthesis has been reported elsewhere [21], served as reference compound (without a substituent in the isatin part as well as on the phenyl ring) to evaluate the effects of substituents about the isatin scaffold as well as the phenyl ring attached to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety of the test compounds on their toxicity potential. The results given in the Table 1 revealed that substitution of trifluoromethoxy group alone in the isatin scaffold or in combination with some other functions on the phenyl ring resulted into either induction or enhancement of toxic activity in certain cases, compared with the reference compound. To the contrary, in some other cases, such a combination caused either elimination or reduction in the activity. This inference receives support from the results obtained by us in the earlier studies [22,23,25]. For example, compound 3a possessing inductively electron-attracting trifluoromethoxy substituent at position-5 of the isatin scaffold exhibited promising toxic activity (LD50 = 4.49 \u00d7 10\u22125 M), whereas the corresponding compound i.e., the reference point having no trifluoromethoxy group in the isatin moiety, was found to be inactive (LD50 = >3.38 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) [22]. Similarly, compound 3k having trifluoromethyl substituent at position-4 of the phenyl ring was found to display enhanced toxicity (LD50 = 1.11 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) when compared with the corresponding compound with no trifluoromethoxy function at position-5 of the isatin scaffold, giving a LD50 value of 1.17 \u00d7 10\u22124 M [23]. Also, compounds 3n and 3o possessing fluoro groups at positions-2,4 and -2,6 of the phenyl ring exhibited increased toxic activity (LD50 = 1.43 \u00d7 10\u22125 M and 1.34 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, respectively) in comparison to the corresponding compounds having no trifluoromethoxy substituent at position-5 of the isatin part, giving the same LD50 values of 2.00 \u00d7 10\u22125 M. Much more pronounced enhancement was observed in the case of 3k (LD50 = 1.17 \u00d7 10\u22124 M \u21921.11 \u00d7 10\u22125 M). However, compound 3l with trifluoromethoxy group at position-4 of the phenyl ring attached to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety and the corresponding compound possessing no such substituent at position-5 of the isatin scaffold displayed almost the same activity (LD50 = 1.81 \u00d7 10\u22125 M and 1.80 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, respectively) [23] indicating that the introduction of trifluoromethoxy group at position-5 of the isatin scaffold did not significantly affect toxicity potential of the compound having trifluoromethyl substituent at position-4 of the phenyl ring. On the contrary, compounds 3b-3d, 3h, 3r and 3u with 4-ethyl, 2-fluoro, 3-fluoro, 4-iodo, 2,4-dichloro and 2,4,6-trichloro substituents about the phenyl ring showed almost no toxic effects (LD50 = >2.45 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, >2.51 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, >2.51 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, >1.98 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, >2.23 \u00d7 10\u22124 M and >2.07 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, respectively), whereas the corresponding compounds without trifluoromethoxy group at position-5 of the isatin scaffold gave LD50 values of 5.10 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, 3.10 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, 4.60 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, 1.26 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, 1.20 \u00d7 10\u22124 M and 1.10 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, respectively [23,25]. Similarly, compounds 3i, 3j and 3p with 2-trifluoromethyl, 3-trifluoromethyl and 3,5-difluoro substituents about the phenyl ring showed reduced toxic activity (LD50 = 1.80 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, 1.70 \u00d7 10\u22124 M and 4.32 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, respectively) in comparison to the corresponding compounds (without trifluoromethoxy group at position-5 of the isatin moiety), which gave LD50 values of 1.36 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, 2.20 \u00d7 10\u22125 M and 2.10 \u00d7 10\u22125 M [23]. Relatively, much pronounced reduction in the toxic activity was observed in the case of 3j (LD50 = 2.20 \u00d7 10\u22125 M \u2192 1.70 \u00d7 10\u22124 M). This showed that the simultaneous presence of inductively electron-attracting groups in the isatin scaffold as well as the phenyl ring substituted at N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety caused either elimination or reduction in the toxicity potential. However, compared with monofluoro-substituted compounds 3c and 3d, compound 3e having fluoro substituent at position-4 of the phenyl ring displayed promising activity (LD50 = 3.72 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) in the present assay. Similarly, compared with compound 3c, the dihalogeno-substituted compound 3q possessing fluoro and bromo substituents at positions-2 and -4 of the phenyl ring, respectively, exhibited induced toxic activity (LD50 = 1.60 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) in the present assay.\n\nOn the whole, out of twenty one compounds tested for toxic activity, ten i.e.,3a, 3e, 3i-3l and 3n-3q proved to be active, exhibiting promising toxicity (LD50 = 1.11 \u00d7 10\u22125 M \u2212 1.80 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) against Artemia salina. The remaining compounds i.e., 3b-3d, 3f-3h, 3m and 3r-3u gave LD50 values ranging from >1.98 \u00d7 10\u22124 M to >2.51 \u00d7 10\u22124 M in the present assay and, therefore, can be considered as inactive. Compound 3k having an inductively electron-attracting trifluoromethyl substituent at position-4 of the phenyl ring proved to be the most potent toxicant, as it showed exciting activity with a LD50 value of 1.11 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, which was even better than the potent anticancer drug etoposide (LD50 = 1.27 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) used as a reference standard in the present assay, and thus seems a promising lead compound for further studies. The next potent compounds were found to be 3n and 3o with fluoro groups at positions-2,4 and -2,6 of the phenyl ring, showing toxic activity with LD50 values of 1.43 \u00d7 10\u22125 M and 1.34 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, respectively. These preliminary results indicate that structural modifications may lead to the development of novel compounds with improved toxicity. \n\nMelting points were taken on a Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed on a Leco CHNS-9320 (USA) elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra (KBr discs) were run on Shimadzu Prestige-21 FT-IR spectrometer. The 1H-NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 on Bruker (Rhenistetten-Forchheim, Germany) AM 300 spectrometer, operating at 300 MHz and using TMS as an internal standard. 1H chemical shifts are reported in \u03b4/ppm and coupling constants in Hz. The electron impact mass spectra (EIMS) were determined with JEOL MSRoute mass spectrometer. The progress of the reaction and purity of the products were checked on TLC plates coated with Merck silica gel 60 GF254, and the spots were visualized under ultraviolet light at 254/366 nm and/or spraying with iodine vapours. In vitro biological evaluation of the synthesized compounds was done at Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry, University of Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nTo a solution of 5-trifluoromethoxyisatin (2.5 mmol) in 50% aqueous ethanol (10 mL) containing a catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid was added the appropriate thiosemicarbazide (2.5 mmol) dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) under stirring. The reaction mixture was then heated under reflux for 2 h. The crystalline or amorphous solid formed during heating was collected by suction filtration. Thorough washing with hot aqueous ethanol (50%) furnished the target compounds 3a-3u in pure form.\n\nN-Phenyl-2-[2-oxo-5-(trifluoromethoxy)-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene]-1-hydrazinecarbothioamide (3a).

An unequal partition was made in the plastic dish with the help of a perforated device. Approximately 50 mg of eggs were sprinkled into the large compartment, which was darkened, while the smaller compartment was opened to ordinary light. After two days, nauplii were collected by a pipette from the lighted side. A sample of each test compound was prepared by dissolving 2 mg in 2 mL of methanol. From this stock solution, 100, 10 and 1 \u00b5L were transferred to 9 vials, three for each dilution, and one vial was kept as control having 2 mL of methanol. The solvent was allowed to evaporate overnight. After two days, when shrimp larvae were ready, 1 mL of sea water and 10 shrimps were added to each vial (30 shrimps/dilution) and the volume was adjusted with sea water to 5 mL per vial. After 24 h, the number of survivors was counted [35,36]. Data were analyzed by a Finney computer programme to determine the LD50 values [37].\n\nWe have demonstrated the potential of N4-aryl substituted 5-trifluoromethoxyisatin-3-thiosemicarbazones to show toxic activity. Based on the preliminary data given in the Table 1 and in terms of further development and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, simultaneous substitution of different substituents at position-5 of the isatin scaffold and on the phenyl ring attached to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety certainly warrants further investigation. Work in this regard along with extended SAR studies will be reported in the near future."}
