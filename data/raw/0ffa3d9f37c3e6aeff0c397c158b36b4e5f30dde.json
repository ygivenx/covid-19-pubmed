{"title": "", "body": "There is an increasingly recognized array of bacterial, parasitic and viral organisms associated with infection of the intestinal tract which can profoundly disrupt intestinal function with or without causing acute diarrhea. Acute diarrhea is a syndrome that is frequently not differentiated clinically by a specific etiologic agent. The wide spectrum of evolution varies from self-limited disease to death. Death is mainly due to dehydration and acute diarrhea takes the highest toll among children in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). This chapter examines the viral and bacterial causes of acute diarrhea, clinically defined by three or more loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based upon an individual baseline lasting for less than 2 weeks. Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract will be presented in Section 6 and diarrhea associated with food poisoning is discussed in Chapter 37. Diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile infection is covered in Chapter 40. When diarrhea lasts for 14 days it can be considered persistent; the term chronic generally refers to diarrhea that lasts for at least one month (see Chapter 39) .\n\nEpidemiology PREVALENCE Acute diarrheal diseases ranked seventh in the causes of mortality in LMIC in the global disease burden series, 2013, with an estimated 1.3 million deaths (2.4 %). 1 Most of these deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years in LMIC and diarrhea remains among the top five causes of all deaths among children younger than age 5 years, as tabulated in 2013. 1 The incidence of acute diarrhea in the general population could be estimated by prospective studies such as those organized in the Food-borne Disease Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in the USA. The network observed that 6% of interviewed people reported an acute diarrheal illness during the 4 weeks preceding the interview, that is an annualized rate of 0.72 episodes per person-year. Rates of illness were highest among children younger than 5 years (1.1 episodes per person-year) and were lowest in persons aged \u226565 years (0.32 episodes per person-year). 2 A study in 2000 that estimated the economic burden of both infectious and noninfectious gastrointestinal and liver disease in the USA found that the most prevalent diseases\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea can be caused by a wide spectrum of viruses, bacteria and parasites. Multiple infections are common.\n\n\u2022 The spectrum of illness ranges from self-limited disease to a potentially deadly situation depending on the pathogen and the host.\n\n\u2022 In healthcare-associated diarrhea the cause is typically limited to Clostridium difficile and norovirus.\n\n\u2022 Acute diarrhea can be diagnosed at the point-of-care by using rapid lateral flow and real-time polymerase chain reaction tests.\n\n\u2022 Recently available multiplex tests allow for a rapid syndromic diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Appropriate water networking, environmental surface cleansing and hand hygiene are key to preventing outbreaks.\n\nThe Gastrointestinal System colon. By the time the initial 8 liters of fluid reaches the ileocecal valve, only about 600 mL remain, representing an efficiency of water absorption of 93%. By the time the remaining 600 mL of fluid reaches the anus, only about 100 mL of fluid remains, generally as formed feces.\n\nIn the small intestine, water is absorbed by three basic mechanisms: 'neutral' sodium chloride (NaCl) absorption mediated by two coupled systems -one of which exchanges Na/H (cation exchanger), and the other exchanges Cl/HCO 3 (anion exchanger); 'electrogenic' sodium absorption where sodium enters the cell via an electrochemical gradient -this electrogenic sodium absorption mechanism is commonly damaged during acute enteric infection; and sodium co-transport whereby sodium absorption is coupled to the absorption of organic solutes such as glucose, many amino acids and peptides. This co-transport mechanism remains intact during most acute diarrheal disorders. It is for this reason that oral rehydration is effective during acute diarrheal illness. Osmotic diarrhea occurs when an absorbable solute, such as lactose, is not absorbed properly and retains water in the gut lumen. Infections that damage the intestinal epithelial cells either directly (rotavirus) or by a toxin (Shigella spp.) cause malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea results from an active, toxin-mediated secretion of water into the gut lumen. This is observed during cholera, and infection by Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli and Shigella species. Rotavirus also produces a viral enterotoxin, the nonstructural glycoprotein (NSP4). Lastly, diarrhea can result from infection-mediated intestinal inflammation. After ingestion, an enteric organism colonizes the intestinal epithelium by adhering to enterocytes. One of two pathways are generally followed depending upon the offending organism, either mucosal invasion or production of an enterotoxin.\n\nAeromonas species are inhabitants of aquatic environments worldwide, including rivers and lakes as well as drinking water plants and distribution systems. Also, most pathogenic Aeromonas species can be found in meat and dairy products. Some Aeromonas isolates encode enterotoxins, including an alt gene-encoded heat-labile and an ast geneencoded heat-stable enterotoxin. Aeromonas enteric infection may range from, most commonly, an acute watery diarrhea to dysenteric illness. Symptoms may include abdominal cramps (70%), nausea (40%), vomiting (40%) and fever (40%). Infection is usually selflimiting although children may rarely be hospitalized because of dehydration. Aeromonas caviae is the most prevalent species. Aeromonas veronii can be associated with rare cholera-like illness and dysenteric diarrhea resembling shigellosis with bloody and purulent stools. Onetenth of patients are coinfected with a second enteric pathogen. Intermittent and persistent diarrhea may occur for years after initial infection. Aeromonas enteritis can be complicated by the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and kidney disease. 13 \n\nCampylobacter species are motile, gram-negative, S-shaped, microaerophilic organisms responsible for zoonoses. Not only food animals such as poultry, cattle, sheep and pigs, but also domestic pets are reservoirs for worldwide human infection. Although the incidence is decreasing in the USA, Campylobacter species are still responsible for sporadic infections following improper handling of poorly cooked meat. Poultry is a major source of infection. 14 Unpasteurized dairy products and water have been found to be sources for limited outbreaks. The incidence of infection with Campylobacter spp. is higher in LMIC than in industrialized nations and travelers to LMIC are at risk of Campylobacter infection. The pathogenesis of Campylobacter infections is poorly understood. C. jejuni and C. coli are the most frequently encountered species responsible for diarrhea. Signs and symptoms may vary from asymptomatic infections to include fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea with or without blood and fecal white blood cells. Although generally self-limiting, relapse with chronic diarrhea is possible as well as extraintestinal infection including bacteremia. C. jejuni infection is the most often recognized infection preceding the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. 15 The mechanisms rely on the cross-reactivity between ganglioside-like motifs present in C. jejuni lipopolysaccharide and those of peripheral nerves. Also, this species has been associated with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. 16 Species other than C. jejuni and C. coli are increasingly isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea, including C. fetus, mainly isolated from extraintestinal sites, and C. upsaliensis. Both species being susceptible to cephalothin, an antibiotic usually incorporated in C. jejuni-selective media, their prevalence in stools and diarrhea may be underestimated by culture methods.\n\nClostridium difficile infection is discussed in detail in Chapter 40.\n\nE. coli organisms are common inhabitants of the intestinal tract of healthy people, yet a limited number of clones are responsible for acute diarrhea and extraintestinal infections. E. fergusonii is frequently isolated from stools yet its pathogenic role is non proven, and E. albertii is a possible agent of acute diarrhea. 17 There are five groups of E. coli organisms associated with acute diarrhea: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), also named enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC); enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC); enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC); enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC); and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC). STEC produce one or several Shiga toxins also known as verocytotoxins and are the E. coli organisms most frequently associated with acute diarrhea in industrialized countries. These organisms, including various E. coli O157 serotypes, are responsible for mild non-bloody and bloody acute diarrhea. 18 Non-O157:H7 STEC are associated with illnesses that differ from those caused by E. coli O157:H7. Most notably, they are found later and have a lower proportion of bloody diarrhea than in patients infected with E. coli O157:H7. 19 STEC are also responsible for an estimated 80% of HUS cases in about 4% of patients with enteric infection. Ground beef has been the major vehicle of transmission of O157 STEC, although other vehicles contaminated by bovine manure have been reported, including raw milk, sausage, apple cider, and raw vegetables and nonchlorinated water supply. Also, person-to-person transmission is responsible for outbreaks in communities. ETEC produce heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins and are a frequent cause of acute diarrhea in LMIC, thus being a frequent cause of travelers' diarrhea. ETEC infection manifests as relatively mild watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps, but without vomiting or fever. EPEC comprise organisms characterized by an adherence factor plasmid and the chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement. These organisms are responsible for severe infantile diarrhea in LMIC, associated with fever, vomiting and prolonged evolution. Chronic diarrhea may follow EPEC infection and be responsible for malabsorption, weight loss and growth retardation. EIEC are responsible for an infection mimicking shigellosis.\n\nEAEC are responsible, worldwide, for mild enteric infections with non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and mild fever.\n\nThe genus Salmonella comprises motile enteric bacteria of problematic nomenclature. Salmonella comprises two species and the species Salmonella enterica comprises five subspecies. The vast majority of human infections are due to strains of Salmonella enterica subspecies I, also isolated from warm-blooded animals, while the other Salmonella organisms are isolated from the environment and cold-blooded animals. These organisms are further serotyped and serotype generally correlates with the food source of infection. Notably, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi is the agent of typhoid fever. Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium are the most commonly isolated in LMIC.\n\nNon-typhoidal S. enterica organisms are responsible for acute diarrhea with fever and abdominal cramps lasting for an average of one on the basis of simple laboratory tests including the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, the Voges-Proskauer test and resistance to polymyxin, which are all positive in the El Tor biotype. The first six historical pandemics are thought to be due to the Classical biotype whereas the on-going seventh pandemic since 1961 is due to the El Tor biotype.\n\nV. cholerae O1 is the organism responsible for historical pandemics of cholera since 1816, including the current pandemics. Most patients contaminated with V. cholerae O1 have an asymptomatic or selflimited diarrhea (>75%), but massive contamination results in severe diarrhea and large volumes of 'rice water stools' and dehydration. Clinical manifestations include loss of skin elasticity, watery eyes, painful muscle cramps and anuria. Dehydration leads to hypovolemic shock and death. Exceptional extraintestinal V. cholerae O1 bacteremia infections have been reported.\n\nIn 1992, cholera cases due to a new serogroup, V. cholerae O139 (Bengal), were reported in India and Bangladesh and spread rapidly throughout Asia. The new serogroup probably resulted from the lateral gene transfer of novel capsule and somatic antigen genes to the El Tor strains. It causes a disease similar to that caused by V. cholerae O1 except that adults are more frequently infected.\n\nSome V. cholerae isolates do not agglutinate with anti-O1 and anti-O139 antisera and are therefore referred as V. cholerae non-O1 isolates. V. cholerae non-O1 isolates do not produce the cholera enterotoxin and are responsible for mild watery diarrhea. Unlike V. cholerae O1 isolates, V. cholerae non-O1 isolates are responsible for extraintestinal infection such as life-threatening sepsis, especially in patients with previous liver disease or hematologic malignancies. V. cholerae non-O1 isolates have also been recovered from other anatomical sites.\n\nOther Vibrio species are responsible for diarrhea. They include V. mimicus, a species phenotypically related to V. cholerae, which is responsible for diarrhea after the consumption of raw seafoods; some strains harboring the cholera toxin can produce cholera-like symptoms. In Asia, V. parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of food-borne intestinal infections after the consumption of raw fish or shellfish. The species is responsible for watery diarrhea, rarely bloody diarrhea and exceptionally is responsible for severe dehydration and death. A first pandemic clone of V. parahaemolyticus serotype O3:K6 emerged in 1996 in Taiwan and then spread throughout Asia to America, Africa and Russia. New serotypes emerged for a few years. V. vulnificus is primarily responsible for life-threatening sepsis and secondary skin infection with necrosis; however, it has an intestinal route of entry and is responsible for vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps after the consumption of raw oysters. Three biogroups have been defined in V. vulnificus, the vast majority of infections being due to biogroup 1. V. fluvialis, V. furnisii and Grimontia (Vibrio) hollisae cause sporadic cases of diarrhea worldwide. 32 V. alginolyticus is occasionally isolated from stools but there is little evidence for V. alginolyticus being actually responsible for intestinal infection and diarrhea.\n\nAmong the numerous members of the Yersinia genus, only Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis have been associated with digestive tract infection. Y. enterocolitica, further divided into two subspecies enterocolitica and paleartica on the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing, 33 comprises more than 70 serotypes, five of them being associated with human infection. These strains encode for an enterotoxin and some strains harbor a chromosome-borne pathogenicity island which contains the yersiniabactin gene, providing the organisms with iron. Y. enterocolitica is primarily an environmental organism isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of numerous animals, most commonly swine, dogs and rodents. Its distribution is mostly in Northern Europe and the northern USA, reflecting its increased growth at cold temperatures. This species is responsible for gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of contaminated water and food, mainly poorly cooked swine meat. The disease spectrum comprises self-limited, acute diarrhea to terminal ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis mimicking appendicitis. Prolonged shedding has been observed. Sepsis is an uncommon complication observed in patients with an increased iron week. Rarely, these organisms are responsible for bacteremia and extraintestinal infections in immunocompromised patients. Contacts with animals and animal foods are the sources of infection with the Enteritidis serotype, being associated with chicken and egg products. Serotype Cholerasuis is adapted to cattle and serotype Dublin is adapted to pigs. The latter serotype harbors virulence traits in common with serotype Typhi, the typhoid fever agent. Typhoid fever is a lifethreatening sepsis rarely observed in industrialized countries but still of public health concern in LMIC (see Chapter 115). Humans are the only known reservoir for serotype Typhi, which is therefore transmitted by direct person-to-person contact and through contaminated water and food. A syndrome similar to typhoid fever is due to serotypes Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B and Paratyphi C.\n\nShigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii and Shigella sonnei 20 are responsible for acute diarrhea. Man is the only known reservoir for Shigella spp. and transmission is by direct contact from person-to-person and by contaminated water and food. Sexual transmission has been observed in homosexual males. Most cases in industrialized countries are imported from LMIC. Shigella spp. are responsible for bacillary dysentery characterized by acute, bloody diarrhea accompanied by fever and abdominal cramps. Classic dysentery is characterized by scant stools containing mucus, pus and blood. Shigellosis is responsible for rectal and colonic ulcerations that do not develop beyond the lamina propria. Rare cases of sepsis have been observed but Shigella spp. are responsible for HUS.\n\nTropheryma whipplei is an Actinobacterium and the etiologic agent of Whipple disease. 21 Besides frequent fecal carriage in children, 22, 23 T. whipplei has been more recently recognized as an etiologic agent of mild gastroenteritis and diarrhea in children. 24 Indeed, it was not detected in asymptomatic children but its DNA was detected with high bacterial loads in the stools of symptomatic children, followed by disappearance in children recovering from diarrhea, associated with seropositivity. 24 Adults also may present with T. whipplei diarrhea and T. whipplei must be added to the list of agents responsible for travelers' diarrhea. 25 In adults, however, there is asymptomatic fecal carriage of the micro-organism 26 and although the ultimate sources and precise routes of infection are not elucidated, colonized persons are likely sources of infection by the oro-oral and oro-fecal routes of transmission. Diagnosis relies on home-made real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays tested on two different specific sequences. 27, 28 This approach increases the sensitivity of diagnosis over 16S rRNA gene detection. 29 There is no specific treatment for T. whipplei diarrhea.\n\nVibrio species are found ubiquitously in aquatic environments and more than 70 Vibrio spp. are classified as responsible for traumarelated, extraintestinal infections and intestinal infections with diarrhea. 30 Vibrio cholerae is the etiologic agent of cholera. This is a motile, gram-negative, facultative anaerobe bacterium which requires a small concentration of sodium for growth. V. cholerae is primarily an aquatic inhabitant found in freshwater rivers and lakes as well as in estuarine and maritime environments. In these environments, V. cholerae is isolated from both the inanimate environment and from plankton and various bivalves, crabs, shrimp and prawns. A viable-but-not-cultivable state has been described in which regulation may be phage-dependent. 31 V. cholerae comprises three major subgroups, V. cholerae O1, V. cholerae O139 and V. cholerae non-O1, widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical areas, including the Gulf of Mexico for V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae O1 chromosomes contain virulence cassette and pathogenicity islands, encoding virulence factors such as the pilus responsible for the attachment of V. cholerae O1 organisms to the intestinal epithelium, and the cholera enterotoxin responsible for the substantial excretion of electrolytes and water in the intestinal lumen. Two biotypes, designated Classical and El Tor biotypes, can be differentiated which resist in the inanimate environment comprising contaminated surfaces, water and food. Outbreaks of norovirus infection are observed in daycare centers where child vomiting can readily contaminate floor and fomites. 50 Accordingly, direct evidence for animals as reservoirs for human infection is still lacking. Noroviruses are the most prevalent cause of nonbacterial acute enteritis worldwide. 51 These viruses cause large outbreaks and provoke incapacitation for a few days; they have therefore been included in the list B of potential bioterrorism agents by the NIAID. Outbreaks mainly occur in institutions including healthcare centers. Cruise ships appear to be an emerging setting for norovirus infection. Also, air flight has been shown to be a circumstance for norovirus diarrhea, for both cabin crew and passengers. 52 The inanimate environment in healthcare centers is also a source for norovirus infection, and the viruses are resistant to routine cleansing and routine alcohol hand hygiene. 53 The diagnosis can be made within 10 minutes at point-of-care thanks to commercially available immunochromatographic tests.\n\nThese RNA viruses, which average 30 nm diameter, are mainly responsible for acute diarrhea in children, although outbreaks in military troops and hospitals have also been reported. These worldwide viruses are responsible for 2-10% of pediatric cases of acute diarrhea. Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific. 54 \n\nAdenoviruses look like non-enveloped, 100 nm round particles containing DNA and are responsible for human infections. They belong to 51 different serotypes and six subgroups, but only two serotypes Ad40 and Ad41 (subgroup F) have been clearly demonstrated to be agents of acute diarrhea. Clinical characteristics include a higher prevalence in children <4 years of age and a mean duration of disease of 5-10 days, that is longer than that caused by other viruses. Prolonged diarrhea has been observed in immunocompromised patients. 55 \n\nA few other viruses have been associated with acute diarrhea, yet their role remains to be firmly established. These include coronavirus, a definite agent of diarrhea in animals and seldom visualized by electron microscopy and isolated in culture from the stools of patients with diarrhea. Likewise, torovirus is responsible for acute human gastroenteritis and is responsible for nosocomial cases. Aichi virus, a picornavirus, has been characterized by reverse transcription-PCR during an outbreak of enteritis following the consumption of oysters in Japan. 56 Picobirnaviruses have been detected in stools of animals and humans; their significance remains to be established. Recently, cardiovirus, closely related to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, has been detected in the stools in 1.2% patients with acute enteritis. 57\n\nThe global mortality from diarrhea declined from approximately 4.6 million annual deaths during the mid-1980s, to 2.4 million deaths in 1990 and to the current estimate of 1.6-2.1 million. 1 The decline is generally attributed to global improvements in sanitation and the use of glucose-electrolyte oral rehydration therapy (ORT) which has dramatically reduced acute mortality from dehydration caused by diarrhea. In contrast to the fortunate decrease of mortality, morbidity remains as high as during the previous century. However, simple, cheap measures could be undertaken to make the incidence fall. A prospective study in India demonstrated that the promotion of hand washing with plain soap reduced by 53% the incidence of acute diarrhea (and of pneumonia and impetigo). 58 In industrialized countries, prevention relies on increased sanitary measures in sources of enteric pathogens such as recreational lakes for fishing and swimming, and swimming pools, as well as better control over fresh foods. A lifelong oral vaccine against rotavirus has been recently licensed after a few previous attempts and its safety and preventive effects have been carefully evaluated. 59 Cost-effectiveness of a vaccine against rotavirus has been evaluated favorably in the Netherlands. 60 pool, such as thalassemic patients in Western countries, 34 liver disease, cancer and receiving steroid therapy. Y. enterocolitica is a prominent cause of bacterial sepsis associated with blood transfusion. Reactive arthritis is an uncommon sequela observed in HLA-B27-positive patients and immunocompromised patients; it is characterized by an asymmetrical involvement of multiple joints, including the sacroiliac joints and the spine.\n\nY. pseudotuberculosis is rarely isolated as a cause of a self-limited acute diarrhea; it has been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis after consumption of contaminated fresh fruit and vegetables. 35, 36 Y. pseudotuberculosis is also responsible for pseudoappendicitis, and reactive arthritis may develop after infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis O3. 37 \n\nArcobacter are Campylobacter-like organisms occasionally isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea, including Arcobacter butzleri 38 and Arcobacter cryaerophilus DNA group 1B. 39 Particular culture conditions are required for proper isolation of these fastidious organisms, therefore limiting their detection to a few studies. Listeria monocytogenes has only recently been recognized as an agent of acute enteritis, but it has now been associated with several outbreaks. 40 Enteritis typically occurs after ingestion of a large inoculum and is self-limiting after a few days. 41 Klebsiella oxytoca is found in the environment but its principal reservoir is the human gastrointestinal tract. K. oxytoca has been associated with C. difficile-negative antibioticassociated colitis. 42 K. oxytoca organisms cause experimental colitis and exhibit cytotoxicity against HEp-2 cultured cells. 42 Its culture is not routinely performed and requires a specific isolation agar medium. Laribacter hongkongensis is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that was initially reported as being responsible for acute diarrhea in Asian patients. 43 Case-control study indicated that eating fish and travel were associated with L. hongkongensis acute diarrhea. 44 Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides (formerly CDC group DF-3) 45 are Captocytophaga-like organisms isolated from the stools of immunocompromised patients. [46] [47] [48] \n\nRotaviruses are RNA viruses appearing as 70 nm particles with a wheel-like appearance. Based on group-specific antigens of the major viral structural protein VP6, rotaviruses can be classified in six groups A to G. Groups A to C infect humans, the other groups are found in animals. Human rotaviruses are responsible for severe acute diarrhea with dehydration associated with childhood death in low-and middleincome countries. In Europe, children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis were more likely to have lethargy, fever, vomiting and dehydration, and, therefore, more severe disease than were children with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis. Dehydration was up to 5.5 times more likely in children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than in those with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis. 49 Acquisition of rotaviruses is likely from subclinical infection in parents or siblings but rotavirus infection can be a zoonosis. Rotaviruses are resistant in the inanimate environment which may participate as a source of infection, including nosocomial outbreaks. Rotavirus infection is seasonal, with a peak of incidence in winter/spring in temperate countries. Clinical symptoms include acute diarrhea for 2-3 days, fever, vomiting and anorexia. Rapid diagnosis at the point-of-care can be achieved within 15 minutes by using a commercially available lateral-flow assay with parallel detection of adenovirus.\n\nThe family Caliciviridae includes the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus, both responsible for enteritis. These RNA viruses appear as <40 nm nonenveloped particles. Noroviruses comprise five genotypes, the genotypes I, II and IV are responsible for human infections, the two other genogroups being animal-associated. Likewise, sapoviruses comprise five genogroups, the genotypes I, II, IV and V are responsible for human infections. These human viruses are highly contagious viruses Paratyphi C serotypes. O serotype determination is done by agglutination using pooled antisera while further H serotype determination is done by tube agglutination tests using broth culture and testing the two phases of the flagellar antigens. Campylobacter spp. are recovered by using the filtration method in parallel to selective, blood-containing or non-blood containing media and a micro-aerophilic atmosphere. Some Campylobacter spp. require 6% hydrogen in atmosphere. A 42 \u00b0C incubation temperature allows the growth of C. jejuni and C. coli but not all Campylobacter and Aeromonas spp. are recovered using blood agar incorporating 20 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin and produce \u03b2-hemolytic colonies. Further identification should be done for oxidase-positive and indole-positive colonies. Modified cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin agar is also suitable for the isolation of Aeromonas species. The interpretation of recovery of Aeromonas in stools must be cautious since there is no strong evidence that all Aeromonas isolates from stools are responsible for diarrheal infection. 72 Blood cultures are mandatory for the diagnosis of typhoid fever as well as bacteremia due to non-Typhi serotypes of Salmonella.\n\nThe systematic search for other enteritis pathogens may depend on local epidemiology, including Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio spp., K. oxytoca, L. monocytogenes and Plesiomonas shigelloides. Growth of Y. enterocolitica from stools is enhanced by incubation of selective media at 35 \u00b0C. A pectin agar should be used for the isolation of Y. enterocolitica from stools. V. cholerae will be visible as very motile, gram-negative slightly curved bacilli cultivated using a TCBS agar after enrichment. Yellow colonies of oxidase-negative bacilli can be confirmed, by 16S rDNA sequencing. In parallel to the search for pathogenic bacteria, the search for viruses should be done using electron microscope observation after negative staining as well as detection of rotavirus. Identification of bacterial colonies is now routinely done by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 73 Management Management of acute diarrhea should include the clinical evaluation of the patient, including risk factors for specific etiology and dehydration; rapid diagnosis of viral diarrhea; and treatment, including rehydration, antibiotic treatment and symptomatic treatment. Rehydration is a major therapeutic measure. Oral rehydration has a higher risk of paralytic ileus, but intravenous rehydration exposes patients to risks of intravenous therapy. For every 25 children treated with oral rehydration one will fail and require intravenous rehydration. 74 Rapid diagnosis of viral diarrhea is important in order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. Because of the absence of any antiviral drug effective against the viruses responsible for acute diarrhea, the management of viral diarrhea comprises the relief of symptoms and rehydration. Most acute diarrhea episodes are self-limiting and do not require antibiotic treatment. Meta-analysis has confirmed that antibiotic treatment is useful to shorten the duration of signs and symptoms in travelers' acute diarrhea. 75 When antibiotics should be prescribed, fluoroquinolones are the drugs of first choice, and one-day treatment is advocated except for Campylobacter and Shigella infections, which may be treated for three days. 76 In the case of patients returned from countries where fluoroquinolone resistance is prevalent, such as Campylobacter spp. in Thailand, azithromycin (500 mg \u00d71/d) could be used for three days (see also Chapter 37 and Practice Point 11). 77 Antimicrobial therapy for O157 E. coli enteritis remains a controversial issue because some studies reported a deleterious effect on the evolution of hemolytic uremic syndrome. The increasing resistance of S. enterica Typhi to antibiotics, notably to ciprofloxacin, makes the choice of first-line antibiotic treatment of typhoid fever more problematic (see Chapter 115). The majority of Y. enterocolitis gastroenteritis does not require antibiotic treatment, contrary to systemic infection which could be treated using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (no resistant strain reported) or fluoroquinolones, despite the fact that a few resistant strains have been reported. 78 References available online at expertconsult.com.\n\nAs for travelers, pre-travel prophylaxis relies on vaccines. There is currently only one vaccine available that provides protection against diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and ETEC. This vaccine is licensed in only a few Western countries. Protective efficacy against cholera is 85%, while protection against the heat-labile toxin of ETEC reaches 67%. Current studies show a protective effect of up to 43%. Vaccination against cholera and ETEC should be recommended for at-risk travelers, in particular those with high exposure at their travel destination or high personal risks through fluid loss. 61 Typhim Vi is a conjugate vaccine aimed at prevention against typhoid fever; its safety and effectiveness have been favorably evaluated. 62,63 During travel, systematic administration of antibiotics including fluoroquinolones, cyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) is controversial. Prophylaxis may rely on the basic rules of boiling fresh water or drinking bottled water, and cooking foods.\n\nThere is no recommended serologic test for the microbiologic diagnosis of enteric pathogens, and the laboratory diagnosis of diarrhea relies solely on direct diagnosis. Serologic testing is useful for epidemiologic investigation of Campylobacter species infections. 64 Fresh stools should be collected in a clean container with a tight lid. Alternatively, a transport medium incorporating buffered glycerol in saline can be used. Rectal swab is an alternative specimen in selected situations. It is well established that hospitalized patients who did not enter the hospital with diarrhea are unlikely to develop diarrhea caused by other bacterial agents than C. difficile; therefore, stool culture should not be performed in patients hospitalized for more than 72 hours (the three-day rule) and a rapid detection of C. difficile toxins should be performed. 65 For routine purposes, testing a single stool specimen has acceptable sensitivity but testing a second specimen is mandatory when the first one had a more than 2-hour delay in transport. 66 Several techniques have been developed for the point-of-care diagnosis of diarrhea including the rapid (<30 minutes) agglutinationbased detection of rotavirus and adenovirus as well as the detection of C. difficile toxins. The rapid detection of C. difficile toxins A and B should be routinely performed for both out-clinic patients and hospitalized patients. Point-of-care detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in children using EIA has not been evaluated favorably. 67 A commercially available Campylobacter antigen detection kit has been favorably evaluated. 68 A dipstick test for the rapid detection of Shigella is under evaluation. 69 Multiplex real-time PCR assays are now commercially available for a 1-3-hour diagnosis of bacteria virus and parasites. 70 Further detection of the causative organism relies on stool examination in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Direct microscopic examination may yield motile bacteria such as Vibrio and Salmonella species and parasites. Although Gram-staining analysis of stool specimens may not be routinely done, it has demonstrated 66-94% sensitivity and >95% specificity for the rapid detection of Campylobacter species. 71 Culture of stools will focus on frequent pathogens and the systematic query of less frequent bacterial pathogens will be guided by the local epidemiologic situation. Pathogens routinely detected by culture of diarrheal stools include O157 E. coli, Shigella spp., S. enterica serotypes, C. jejuni and C. coli and Aeromonas spp. Enrichment of stools in O157, O111 and O26 serotypes of E. coli can be done by using specific, commercially available magnetic beads. Sorbitol MacConkey agar should be used for the isolation of O157 STEC as these organisms do not ferment D-sorbitol, contrary to the vast majority of other E. coli strains. S. enterica serotypes are better isolated by using an enrichment broth before plating onto selective media. Biochemical identification of Salmonella spp. and O (somatic), H (flagellar) and Vi (capsular) antigen serotyping should be performed in order to identify Salmonella enteritis Typhi (the typhoid fever agent, being capsular antigen Vi positive) and the most prevalent non-Typhi serotypes. The Vi capsular antigen is occasionally detected in non-Typhi, Dublin and"}
