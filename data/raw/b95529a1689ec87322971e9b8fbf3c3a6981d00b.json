{"title": "", "body": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common diseases and both result in signifi cant morbidity and mortality. Although they share some clinical features and although they may coexist in the same individual, they are distinct disease syndromes with diff erent pathogenetic mechanisms. In each case much of the morbidity and mortality is associated with exacerbations of disease, in response to a variety of trigger factors. A common feature of asthma and COPD is the important role of infection in triggering exacerbations. Infections have also been implicated in the etiology of the two diseases. Th is chapter will review the epidemiological evidence implicating infectious pathogens as triggers and will discuss the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology that result in an exacerbation.\n\nAsthma aff ects 20-33% of children in the United Kingdom [1] . It is a multifaceted syndrome involving atopy, bronchial hyperreactivity, and IgE and non-IgE-mediated acute and chronic immune responses. Th e asthmatic airway is characterized by an infi ltrate of eosinophils and of T-lymphocytes expressing the type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Trigger factors associated with acute exacerbations of asthma include exposure to environmental allergens, especially animals, molds, pollens and mites, cold, exercise, and drugs. Th e link between respiratory infection and asthma exacerbations is well established although incompletely understood. In the 1950s this association was attributed to bacterial allergy [2] but it is now clear that the majority of exacerbations are due to viral rather than bacterial infection.\n\nViral respiratory tract infections are a major cause of wheezing in infants and in adult patients with asthma. Th eir role may have been underestimated in early epidemiological studies because of diffi culties in isolation and identifi cation [3] . Th e introduction of PCR to such studies has implicated viral infection in the majority of asthma exacerbations.\n\nIndirect evidence from population studies has established a signifi cant correlation between the seasonal variation in wheezing episodes in young children and peaks of virus identifi cation [4] . Seasonal patterns of identifi cation of respiratory viruses are associated with peaks in hospital admissions for both children and adults with asthma indicating a role for such infections in severe asthma attacks [5] . Direct evidence implicating viral infection in asthma exacerbations has been provided by studies showing an increased rate of virus detection in individuals suff ering asthma attacks. Viruses have been detected in 80-85% of asthma exacerbations in children [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and in 75-80% in adults [11] [12] [13] [14] . Th e highest rates of identifi cation are in those studies where subjects were followed prospectively allowing collection of clinical specimens early in the course of the illness, where PCR-based methods of diagnosis were used instead of or in addition to serology and culture, and where the methodology used allowed for detection of rhinoviruses. Th e rate of detection of viruses between exacerbations when individuals are asymptomatic is only of the order of 3-12%. In contrast a study of transtracheal aspirates in adult asthmatics during exacerbations [15] yielded sparse bacterial cultures with no correlation to clinical illness and no diff erence from those of normal subjects.\n\nIn almost all studies of asthmatics, the predominant viruses are rhinoviruses (RV), infl uenza, RSV, and parainfl uenza viruses. RV alone are detected in around 50% of virus-induced asthma attacks. Adenoviruses, enteroviruses, metapneumoviruses, bocaviruses, and coronaviruses are also detected but less frequently. Infl uenza is only found during annual epidemics.\n\nTh e eff ects of respiratory virus infection in the nasal mucosa and upper respiratory tract have been extensively investigated. Th e eff ects of such viruses in the lower respiratory tract have been studied but detailed knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in asthma exacerbations remains limited. Experimental respiratory virus infection in human volunteers is limited to mild disease by concerns of safety [16] . Most such studies have therefore focused on the experimental innoculation of rhinovirus in allergic rhinitic or mild asthmatic individuals and normal control subjects [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Such studies provide a useful model of natural virus infection in asthma and off er the advantages of patient selection and monitoring, under controlled conditions before, during, and after infection, of administration of active and placebo medication, of ability to sample the lower airway with timing from onset of infection accurately defi ned and the study of RV-induced eff ects including asthma symptomatology, lung function, and airway pathology/immunology. Recent epidemiological evidence confi rms a synergistic interaction between virus infection and allergen exposure in precipitating hospital admissions for asthma [29, 30] . Other trigger factors that may interact with infection include air pollution. A study of asthmatic children demonstrated an increased risk of developing an asthmatic episode within 7 days of an upper respiratory tract infection if the nitrogen dioxide level was greater than 28 \u03bc g/m 3 [9, 31] .\n\nMost studies of experimental virus infection in allergic subjects are performed outside the relevant season for allergen exposure. One attempt to provide a model combining allergen exposure and virus infection utilized RV infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Individuals received three high dose allergen challenges in the week prior to innoculation to try to mimic combined allergen exposure and virus infection [32] . Interestingly, prior allergen challenge in this model, somewhat unexpectedly, appeared to protect against an RV cold with delayed nasal leukocytosis, increased generation of the proinfl ammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and a delayed, less severe clinical course. Th ere was an inverse correlation between nasal lavage eosinophilia and the severity of cold symptoms. Th e explanation proposed by the authors of this study is that limited high dose allergen challenge may not reproduce the eff ects of chronic low dose allergen exposure and may stimulate the production of antiinfl ammatory mediators such as IL-10 or antiviral cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 . In work by de Kluijver et al . the eff ects of a 10-day period of low dose allergen exposure in house-dust mite sensitive and/or experimental RV16 infection were studied. No synergistic or additive eff ects were observed as regards lung function parameters [33] . Further development of models of experimental combined allergen exposure and virus infection is clearly required.\n\nWe have recently adopted the approach of infecting asthmatic volunteers with RV and then sending them home to continue their normal allergen exposure in the natural environment [34] . We investigated physiologic, virologic, and immunopathologic responses to experimental rhinovirus infection in blood, induced sputum, and bronchial lavage in 10 atopic mild asthmatic and 15 nonatopic normal volunteers. Rhinovirus infection induced significantly greater lower respiratory symptoms, lung function impairment, increases in bronchial hyperreactivity, and eosinophilic lower airway infl ammation in asthmatic compared to normal subjects. We also saw trends to increased neutrophils and lymphocytes in the lower airway in asthmatics, and coincident reductions in blood lymphocytes, suggesting traffi cking to the airway. In asthmatic, but not normal subjects, virus load was signifi cantly related to lower respiratory symptoms, bronchial hyperreactivity, and reductions in blood total and CD8 \u03e9 lymphocytes and lung function impairment was signifi cantly related to neutrophilic and eosinophilic lower airway infl ammation. Th is study demonstrated increased rhinovirus-induced clinical illness severity in asthmatic compared to normal subjects, provided evidence of strong relationships between virus load, lower airway virus-induced infl ammation, and asthma exacerbation severity and suggests that this approach could provide a very good model in which to examine asthma exacerbation pathogenesis as well as treatment interventions.\n\nWhereas other respiratory viruses such as infl uenza, parainfl uenza, RSV, and adenovirus are well recognized causes of lower airway syndromes such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis and are capable of replication in the lower airway, until recently there was uncertainty as to whether RV infection occurred in the lower airway or solely in the upper respiratory tract . Although the possibility of nasopharyngeal contamination cannot be ruled out, RV has been detected in lower airway clinical specimens such as sputum [35] , tracheal brushings [26] , and BAL [36] by both RT-PCR and culture. RV has been cultured in cell lines of bronchial epithelial cell origin [37] and replication has been demonstrated in primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells [38] [39] [40] . Th e preference of RV for culture at 33\u00b0C rather than 37\u00b0C has been used as an argument against lower airway infection but there is now evidence that replication does occur at lower airway temperatures [41] . Finally the use of in situ hybridization has conclusively demonstrated RV replication in bronchial biopsies of subjects following experimental infection [38] and recent immunochemistry data suggests a preference for basal cells [42] . Th ese data confi rm that RV infection of the lower airway does occur and directly implicate lower airway infection in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.\n\nInvestigation into the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infections and rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations has been severely hampered for the \u03f3 50 years since their discovery, as it has been believed that rhinoviruses only infect humans and chimpanzees. However, a mouse model of rhinovirus infection has recently been successfully developed for the fi rst time. New methods of purifi cation and concentration of rhinoviruses, were used to show that for the minor group of rhinoviruses (the \u03f3 10% that use the LDL receptor as their mode of entry into cells), wild-type BALB/c mice can be successfully infected and that most of the diseaserelated outcomes observed in humans were reproduced in this unique new model. Th ese outcomes include induction of both innate and acquired immune responses, induction of mucin synthesis and secretion, induction of both acute neutrophilic and prolonged lymphocytic airway infl ammation, and induction of chemokines responsible for chemoattraction of neutrophils, lymphocytes and dendritic cells as well as a range of proinfl ammatory cytokines. Mice transgenic for a chimera of ICAM-1, the receptor for the major group ( \u03f3 90%) of rhinoviruses, in which the rhinovirusbinding domains were human, but the remainder of the molecule mouse were then developed. Th is transgenic mouse was then able to be infected by major group strains, thus generating mouse models capable of being infected by all rhinovirus serotypes. Finally an established mouse model of allergic airway infl ammation was used to demonstrate that rhinovirus infection of this model resulted in rhinovirusinduced exacerbation of allergic airway infl ammation. Th e asthma-related outcomes exacerbated by infection in this model include exacerbation of airway hyperresponsiveness, exacerbation of mucin synthesis and secretion (MUC5AC and MUC5B), exacerbation of neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and lymphocytic airway infl ammation, and augmented induction of both Th 1 (IFN-\u03b3 ) and Th 2 (IL-4 and -13) cytokines. Th e development of this novel mouse model of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations, should allow mechanisms of disease to be investigated in vivo and true causation be established in vivo . [43] .\n\nSubjects with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis exhibit increased pathophysiological eff ects as a result of RV infection as compared to nonatopic, nonasthmatic controls. With detailed monitoring, it is possible to detect reductions in both peak fl ow [44] and home recordings of FEV 1 [24] in atopic asthmatic patients in the acute phase of experimental RV16 infection. Th ere is an enhanced sensitivity to histamine and allergen challenge after RV16 innoculation in nonasthmatic atopic rhinitic subjects [19, 45] . RV16 increases asthma symptoms, coinciding with an increase in the maximal bronchoconstrictive response to methacholine up to 15 days after infection [20] . Th ere is also a signifi cant increase in sensitivity to histamine in asthmatic subjects after RV16 infection, most pronounced in those with severe cold symptoms [25] and our recent study confi rmed that these reductions in lung function and increases in symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness were observed only in asthmatic, but not in normal subjects [34] .\n\nCurrent concepts of a typical antiviral immune response, as reviewed in detail elsewhere [46, 47] , result from research in human volunteers and patients but also in experimental animals, especially inbred mice. Results of animal studies may not be directly applicable to the outbreed human population but ethical considerations often limit direct investigation of the human immune system. All immune responses are a combination of nonspecifi c (innate) and specifi c (adaptive) immunity.\n\nNonspecifi c or innate [48] elements include: phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages that engulf and destroy viruses; natural killer (NK) cells that recognize and destroy virus-infected cells on the basis of reduced HLA class I expression; cells including NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, basophils, epithelial cells that release cytokines, such as interferons, with immunoregulatory or antiviral actions; components of body fl uids such as complement, defensins, and surfactant proteins that are capable of neutralizing viruses independently of, or in combination with, antibodies.\n\nSome viruses may also cause complement-mediated damage. Complement components bind to epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo during RSV infections. C3a and C5a are increased in human volunteers infected with infl uenza A virus [49] . Th ere is little information on the role of complement in immunity to RV. Recent data suggests that the RV 3C protease cleaves the complement factors C3 and C5 which may interfere with the destruction of virus-infected cells [50] . For other viruses, for example infl uenza, the complement system forms an important link between the innate and specifi c immune systems. Mice defi cient for the third component of complement are highly susceptible to primary infl uenza, showing reduced priming of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells in lung draining lymph nodes and severely impaired recruitment into the lung of virus-specifi c CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 eff ector T-cells producing IFN-\u03b3 [51] . Activation of the complement cascade may be necessary for the function of other innate antiviral proteins such as serum mannose-binding protein [52] Defensins Th e \u03b1 and \u03b2 defensins are small cationic antimicrobial peptides which have the capacity to kill bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses by disruption of the microbial membrane.\n\nIn vivo they are probably most important in phagocytic vacuoles and on the surface of skin and mucosal epithelia. In addition to their direct antibiotic role, defensins are increasingly being found to have immunomodulatory actions [53] and to play a role in cell recruitment through activation of certain chemokine receptors, for example hBD3 and CCR6 on dendritic cell (DC).\n\nSpecifi c immunity involves production of antibody by B-lymphocytes and the activities of cytotoxic T-cells following processing and presentation of viral antigens by additional cells of the immune system, the most important of which are probably dendritic cells. Immunological memory modifi es the overall response to reinfection by previously encountered virus and alters the timing and magnitude of contributions due to diff erent components.\n\nIn primary infection, viruses replicate in the respiratory tract reaching peak levels at around days 2-4. At this time type I interferons are fi rst detected, peaking around days 2-3 and falling to become undetectable once active replication has ceased. Interferons activate NK cells, fi rst detectable around day 3 and peaking around day 4. In addition to destruction of virally infected cells NK cells release cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 that activate additional infl ammatory cells in the airway including macrophages. Such nonspecifi c immune mechanisms are essential in early defense against virus in the fi rst few days. In addition, the innate immune system plays a role in stimulating specifi c immunity and may infl uence the nature of the specifi c response, for example whether this is characterized by type 1 or type 2 cytokines.\n\nMeanwhile, viral antigens are processed locally and in regional lymph nodes by dendritic cells and presented to T-cells. CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T-cells are detectable from around day 4 then generally decline as infection resolves to become undetectable by day 14. However, memory CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 responses may persist for life. T-cell recruitment is dependent on the production of chemokines and on alterations in the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelium of infl amed tissues. Time is also required to generate B-cell responses. Mucosal IgA may be detected around day 3, serum IgM from days 5-6 and IgG days 7-8, increasing in amount and avidity over the next 2-3 weeks. IgA falls normally to low or undetectable levels over 3-6 months. Serum IgG may remain detectable for life. Specifi c immune mechanisms such as CD8 \u03e9 T-cells and immunoglobulin are responsible for the eradication of infectious virus usually by 7-10 days after infection.\n\nSecondary infection with the same virus results in rapid mobilization of B-and T-cell specifi c immunity with an earlier T-cell peak coinciding with the NK cell peak around days 3-4. If reinfection is with the same serotype a rapid increase in levels of preexisting neutralizing antibodies may limit viral replication to such an extent that infection is clinically silent. Because this results in fewer infected cells there is relatively less activation of nonspecifi c immunity and it may be diffi cult to detect a CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response.\n\nFollowing experimental infection of seronegative subjects with RV2 [54] serum-specifi c antibodies are detectable at 1-2 weeks, reach a maximum at 5 weeks, persist for at least a year and may remain elevated many years after infection. Local specifi c antibody levels may be lost more rapidly. High levels of serum neutralizing antibody or specifi c IgA protect against reinfection with the same rhinovirus serotype. However, since it appears relatively late, recovery from illness for seronegative hosts which usually occurs at 7-10 days must be due to other components of the immune response. In seropositive subjects preexisting serum neutralizing antibodies to RV39 and to RV-Hanks modify experimental infections in human subjects [55, 56] . Local IgA and IgG passing from the vasculature into the pulmonary interstitium contribute to viral clearance. However, the 100 \u03e9 RV serotypes mean that repeated infection with RV to which an individual lacks appropriate antibodies is common .\n\nT-cell responses to RV demonstrate MHC class I restricted cross-reactivity between serotypes due to specificity for conserved epitopes within the capsid proteins VP 1-3 [57] . RV16-and RV49-specifi c T-cell clones from human peripheral blood demonstrate recognition of both serotype specifi c and shared viral epitopes [58] . Vigorous proliferation of and IFN-\u03b3 production by PBMC in response to RV16 in seronegative subjects is associated with reduced viral shedding after inoculation [59] , thus T-cells responses also appear protective.\n\nTh e interaction of respiratory virus infection and chronic asthmatic airway infl ammation results in respiratory symptoms that are more severe than those suff ered by nonasthmatic individuals [34, 60] and case-control studies have demonstrated clear synergistic interactions between virus infection and allergen exposure in increasing risk of exacerbation [29, 30] . Th e detailed immunological mechanisms underlying this interaction are currently being investigated, but recent data suggest defi cient production of type I ( \u03b2 ), type II ( \u03b3 ), and type III ( \u03bb ) IFNs, as well as Th 1 cytokines (IL-12) and anti-infl ammatory cytokines (IL-10), are likely to increase virus-induced lower airway infl ammation [34, 61, 62] . Th ese defi ciencies are also accompanied by augmented production of Th 2 cytokines suggesting that perhaps allergen-induced infl ammation is also increased in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.\n\nBronchial infl ammation is likely therefore a central event for virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Th e processes involved include interacting cascades from the complement, coagulation, fi brinolytic, and kinin systems of the plasma as well as cell-derived cytokines, chemokines, and arachidonic acid metabolites. Our understanding of the interaction of viruses with these cascades in asthma is incomplete and it is likely that diff erent viruses interact with each system to diff erent extents. However, it is reasonable to believe that in all cases the initial trigger of the infl ammatory reactions is epithelial cell-virus interaction. \n\nTh e airway epithelium is an important component of antiviral defense. In addition to its function as a physical barrier to the entry of viruses, the responses of epithelial cells (EC) following viral infection, whether or not this results in destruction of the cell, contribute to both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses. Information regarding the eff ects of RV on EC comes from in vivo studies and from in vitro models using either cultured primary airway EC or cell lines of epithelial cell origin such as A549, BEAS-2B, and H292.\n\nEC contribute to the immune response following virus infection through the production of cytokines and chemokines ( Fig. 37 .1 ). Th ey may also act as antigen presenting cells particularly during secondary respiratory viral infections. Epithelial cells express MHC class I and the costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 and this expression is upregulated in vitro by RV16 [63] ( Fig. 37.2 ) .\n\nTh e extent of epithelial cell destruction observed in the airway varies according to virus type. Infl uenza typically causes extensive necrosis [64] , whereas RV causes little or only patchy damage. Destruction of epithelial cells results in both an increase in epithelial permeability, and increased penetration of irritants and allergens, and exposure of the extensive network of aff erent nerve fi bers. Both eff ects may contribute to increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In vivo RV causes some shedding of infected ciliated EC [65] , but the extent of viral infection of the epithelium may be incomplete even in the nose [66] . In vitro studies exposing monolayer cultures of nasal epithelial cells to respiratory viruses at 10 3 -10 4 TCID 50 /ml demonstrate no detectable CPE (carboxypeptidase E) with RV or coronavirus in contrast to the extensive destruction with infl uenza and adenovirus [67] . Ex vivo infection of cells from both the upper and the lower respiratory tract suggest that less than 10% of cells in the epithelium are infected by RV [68] , however the extent of virus-induced epithelial damage may be considerably greater in asthmatic than in normal subjects, as asthmatic epithelium has been shown to be much more susceptible in vitro [61] . In vivo studies of degrees of epithelial damage would be technically challenging, but could generate interesting fi ndings.\n\nViruses enter into and replicate within airway EC. Entry is dependent on the interaction with host cell surface proteins which function as receptors. In the case of the major group RV this is ICAM-1 [69] and infection can be blocked by antibodies to ICAM-1 or with soluble ICAM-1 [37] . Th ere is relatively limited expression of ICAM-1 in airway epithelium prior to RV infection [70] and this may explain the patchy nature of infection. Th e upregulation of ICAM-1 in the asthmatic airway is one possible explanation for the increased severity of RV infection in asthma. RV upregulates expression of its own receptor ICAM-1 both in vitro and in vivo . Following experimental infection with RV, ICAM-1 expression is upregulated in nasal epithelium within 24 h, declining by day 5 [71] . RV has similar eff ects on EC from the lower airway. RV has been shown to upregulate ICAM-1 in primary bronchial EC in vitro [72] and ICAM-1 is upregulated in bronchial biopsies following experimental infection of asthmatic subjects with RV16 [73] .\n\nTh ere are two forms of ICAM-1: membrane bound (mICAM-1) which favors viral infection by acting as a virus receptor and soluble (sICAM-1) which binds virus outside the cell and can thereby inhibit virus infection. RV infection of EC is reported to alter the balance in favor of further infection by inducing mRNA for mICAM-1 whilst suppressing that of sICAM-1 [74] . Th e LDL receptor is the receptor for the minor group RV. RV2 infection of primary human tracheal EC (PHTEC) is blocked by an antibody to the LDL receptor and is also reported to upregulate LDL-R expression [48] .\n\nICAM-1 expression by human nasal EC is upregulated in vitro by exposure to a number of infl ammatory cytokines and mediators including IL-1 \u03b2 , IL-8, IFN-\u03b3 , TNF-\u03bb , and the eosinophil-derived proteins MBP and ECP [75] . IL-1 \u03b2 in particular may be important in RV-induced induction of ICAM-1. Antibodies to IL-1 \u03b2 but not TNF-\u03b1 decreased viral replication and ICAM-1 expression by PHTEC [76] . Not all respiratory epithelial cell lines behave in the same way as primary EC -for example A549 cells express ICAM-1 at lower levels constitutively and show upregulation by IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 but not by ECP or MBP. Th e eff ect of IFN-\u03b3 is complex. Whilst IFN-\u03b3 upregulates ICAM-1 in uninfected cells this cytokine inhibits ICAM-1 upregulation by RV14 in H292 cells and its presence results in reduced viral titers [72, 77] . A preexisting elevation of ICAM-1 expression in the asthmatic airway may contribute to increased symptom severity of RV infection. Type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) upregulate ICAM-1 in H-292 cells [78] . Allergen challenge results in upregulation of ICAM-1 on conjunctival and nasal EC in atopics [79] . In nasal brushing EC from atopics, basal ICAM-1 levels were increased relative to nonatopics and elevated in the relevant allergen season. Nasal EC from atopics showed further upregulation after in vitro culture with allergen. Th e highest basal ICAM-1 was found on nasal polyp EC and this was increased further after RV14 infection. Viral titers after RV14 infection were signifi cantly higher for polyp EC than for nonatopic and atopic nonpolyp EC [80] .\n\nModifi cation of EC ICAM-1 expression is therefore of possible therapeutic benefi t. In vitro RV increases expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in primary bronchial EC (PBEC) cultures and in A549 cells via a mechanism involving NF-\u03ba B [5, 81, 82] . One of the actions of corticosteroids is inhibition of NF-\u03ba B [83] . In both A549 cells and in PBEC pretreatment with three corticosteroids, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and mometasone furoate inhibits RV16-induced increases in ICAM-1 surface expression, mRNA, and promoter activation without alteration of virus infectivity or replication. Dexamethasone suppresses ICAM-1 in PHTEC and inhibits RV infections [84] . Dexamethasone does not inhibit infection of PHTEC by minor group RV2 [85] . Disappointingly, a study of inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatics prior to experimental RV infection failed to show reduced virus-induced ICAM-1 expression in bronchial biopsies [73] but it is possible that a longer course and/or a higher dose of inhaled steroid or administration of oral steroids might have demonstrated a signifi cant eff ect.\n\nOther drugs which aff ect EC ICAM-1 include reducing agents [86] , the H 1 receptor antagonists desloratidine/ loratidine which inhibit RV-induced ICAM-1 upregulation in HPBEC and in A549 cells [87] and erythromycin which inhibits infection of PHTEC by both major group RV14 and minor group RV2 through eff ects including ICAM-1 reduction, blockage of RV RNA entry into endosomes and small reductions in LDL receptor expression [88] .\n\nEC can activate and recruit a variety of other cell types such as lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils through the production of chemokines and cytokines ( Fig. 37.1 ). Such cells are important components of the antiviral response but may also contribute to airway infl ammation and dysfunction in asthma.\n\nInterferons (IFN) play an important role in innate resistance to viruses [89] , acting on virus-infected cells and surrounding cells to produce an antiviral state characterized by the expression and antiviral activity of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Th ere are three main types of IFN, type 1 (IFN-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03b2 , IFN-\u03c9 , IFN-\u03c4 ), type 2 (IFN-\u03b3 ) and the recently discovered type 3 (IFN-\u03bb s [90, 91] ). EC can produce both type 1 and type 3 IFNs. Th ere are 14 IFN-\u03b1 genes but only 1 IFN-\u03b2 gene. IFN-\u03b2 synthesis involves NF\u03ba B, ATF/JUN and the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) (up to 10 of which are currently identifi ed), activation of which occurs in response to virus-specifi c signals including dsRNA, a product of the replication of ssRNA viruses such as RV, RSV, and infl uenza.\n\nIFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 4 are expressed early through the action of IRF3. Activation of the IFN intracellular signaling pathway is required for induction of IRF7 which is required for transcription of the full range of IFNs. DNA microarray analysis has shown that following binding to their receptors on target cells IFNs trigger a complex signaling pathway (mainly JAK-STAT) resulting in the transcription of hundreds of ISGs [92] .\n\nSeveral ISGs have been well studied. Th ese include the dsRNA-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (PKR) which reduces cellular mRNA translation and transcriptional events, two enzymes involved in mRNA degradation, 2 \u0408 5 \u0408 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, the myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins and RNA-specifi c adenosine deaminase (ADAR) which is involved in RNA editing. Th ese ISGs inhibit virus replication at a number of levels and not surprisingly, viruses have evolved mechanisms to resist the actions of IFNs, for example blocking of PKR by the infl uenza NS1 protein [93] . IFNs also upregulate cellular expression of MHC class I and II molecules therefore increasing antigen presentation to CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T-cells and enhancing cellular immune responses.\n\nOne recent study has examined type 1 interferon production by primary bronchial epithelial cells from normal and asthmatic subjects infected ex vivo with RV [40] . Asthmatic EC following infection released a higher titer of virus into culture supernatant and exhibited impaired apoptosis and a greater degree of necrotic cell death, favoring release of virus from dying cells. Th is was accompanied by lower concentrations of IFN-\u03b2 after infection. Addition of IFN-\u03b2 to asthmatic ECs inhibited virus replication to levels observed in ECs from normal subjects. Th is study suggests that the production of IFN-\u03b2 is defi cient in asthmatic ECs and that replacement/augmentation of IFN-\u03b2 to boost the innate immune response could be a novel approach to treatment of virus-induced asthma exacerbations [94] .\n\nA new family of interferons, called type III IFN-\u03bb s, and characterized by three elements: \u03bb 1, \u03bb 2, and \u03bb 3, also termed IL-29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, has recently been described [90, 91] . Th e three highly homologous IFN-\u03bb proteins demonstrate limited (about 20%) homology to type I IFNs [95] . Human IFN-\u03bb s bind to a unique heterodimeric receptor (IFN-\u03bb R), composed of CRF2-12 (also designated IFN-\u03bb R1), and CRF2-4 (also designated IL-10R2) shared with other class II cytokine-receptor ligands including IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26 [90] .\n\nViral infection induces upregulation of IFN-\u03bb mRNA in epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and dendritic cells [90, 91, [96] [97] [98] [99] . IFN-\u03bb s exhibit some similar biological properties to type I IFNs: they induce Jak/STAT pathways that lead to the upregulation of several antiviral proteins and enzymes including 2 \u0408 ,5 \u0408 -OAS and MxA, have antiviral activity in vitro [90, 91, 97] and have also exhibited antviral activity in an in vivo model of vaccinia virus-infected mice [100] . Based on current knowledge, it thus appears that both IFN-\u03b1 /-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb ligand-receptor systems can independently induce an antiviral state by engaging similar participants of the antiviral response, though the signaling pathways involved in IFN-\u03bb production are currently largely unknown. Recent data suggest that IFN-\u03bb may be involved in antiviral responses against RV. In vitro RV infection of a bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) led to IFN-\u03bb production and this cytokine demonstrated a dose-dependent antiviral eff ect against RV [62] . Moreover, IFN-\u03bb production occurred after in vitro infection of primary bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, and BAL cells from healthy volunteers.\n\nWe have recently investigated the production of IFN-\u03bb s in response to RV in primary bronchial ECs and in BAL cells (90% macrophages) from normal and asthmatic subjects [62] . Production of IFN-\u03bb 1 and IFN-\u03bb 2-3 was deficient in ECs and BAL cells from asthmatic subjects after in vitro RV infection and induction of IFN-\u03bb s by RV infection of ECs was strongly inversely related to RV replication. To determine whether IFN-\u03bb production was important in determining responses to RV infection in vivo , the same volunteers were then experimentally infected with RV16, the severity of symptoms and reductions in lung function were monitored and the virus load was determined in BAL. In vitro production of IFN-\u03bb s by RV infection of BAL cells was strongly inversely correlated with both common cold symptoms and in vivo virus load and strongly positively correlated with severity of falls in lung function, in asthmatic and normal volunteers experimentally infected with RV16. Asthmatic patients, in whom in vitro IFN-\u03bb production in BAL cells was signifi cantly lower than in normal subjects, exhibited increased common cold symptoms and reductions in lung function and virus load after in vivo RV16 infection. In marked contrast normal subjects had robust IFN-\u03bb responses, less severe cold symptoms, lower virus load, and no signifi cant changes in lung function. Th ese results document the importance of IFN-\u03bb in the host defense against RV infection in vitro and in vivo and indicate that defi cient IFN-\u03bb production is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.\n\nViral infection of the respiratory tract results in significant changes in the pattern of cytokine expression by a number of cell types, by both cells of the immune system, which may be increased in number and activation status, and by cells often considered to be structural but which in fact contribute signifi cantly to the immune response such as EC. Effi cient orchestration of the immune response by cytokines is essential for eradication of virus. Modifi cation of cytokine expression in the airway may contribute to the increased severity of virus infection in asthma.\n\nIn vitro studies of bronchial EC lines or macrophages have demonstrated the production of a wide range of proinfl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, IFN-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03b3 , TNF-\u03b1 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the chemokines IL-8, ENA-78, RANTES, and IP-10 and macrophage infl ammatory protein (MIP)-1 \u03b1 in response to RV and RSV [37, [101] [102] [103] . In vivo these cytokines can be found in nasal lavage in association with RV infection [104] .\n\nTh e specifi c roles of individual cytokines in the human lower airway during viral infection are not well understood, but increasing information is becoming available. Such cytokines and chemokines activate and recruit a variety of other cells including lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. IL-1, TNF-\u03b1 , and IL-6 share proinfl ammatory properties such as the induction of the acute phase response and the activation of both T-and B-lymphocytes. IL-1 enhances the adhesion of infl ammatory cells to endothelium, facilitating chemotaxis [105] . TNF-\u03b1 is a potent antiviral cytokine but in vitro increases the susceptibility of cultured epithelial cells to infection by RV14 through upregulation of ICAM-1 [37] . IL-6 has been shown to stimulate IgA-mediated immune responses. IL-11 may also be important in virus-induced asthma [106] . It appears to cause bronchoconstriction by a direct eff ect on bronchial smooth muscle [102] . Production of this cytokine by human stromal cells in vitro is increased by RV14, RSV, and parainfl uenza type 3 but not by cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 or adenovirus. In vivo IL-11 is elevated in nasal aspirates from children with colds, levels correlating with the presence of wheezing.\n\nSimilarly the chemokine MIP-1 \u03b1 is increased in nasal secretions during natural viral exacerbations of asthma [107] . Studies in MIP-1 \u03b1 knock-out mice suggest that it mediates pneumonitis due to infl uenza [108] . Th e other chemokines IL-8 and ENA-78, will recruit and activate neutrophils, while RANTES and IP-10 will do the same for lymphocytes [103] .\n\nViral upregulation of cytokines and chemokines may be mediated through certain key transcription factors. Increases in IL-6 and IL-8 production by cultured epithelial cells due to RV was dependent on NF-\u03ba B [82, 107, 109] and further upstream, protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated RV-induced RANTES, IL-8, and IL-6 [110] . Rhinovirus induction of IL-8 was shown to require IkappaB kinasebeta (IKK \u03b2 ) and the transcription factor NF-IL-6 as well as NF-\u03ba B. Similar observations have been made with regard to the induction of IL-1, -6, -8, -11, and TNF-\u03b1 by RSV [111, 112] , thus the potential role of inhibition of NF-\u03ba B in this context has generated considerable interest.\n\nIn addition to the induction of IL-1 \u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 RV infection results in substantial increases in IL-1ra both in vivo and in vitro . Th is is a relatively late eff ect, occurring 48-72 h after infection and may contribute to symptom resolution [113] .\n\nA multitude of infl ammatory mediators are generated or act on the epithelial surface. Bradykinin, a-nine-amino acid peptide generated from plasma precursors as part of the infl ammatory process has been shown to be present in nasal secretions of RV-infected individuals [114] . Bradykinin given intranasally is able to reproduce some of the symptoms of the common cold such as sore throat and rhinitis [115] . Although the presence of kinins in the lungs of virus-infected individuals has not been reported they are present in both the upper and lower airways in allergic reactions [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] .\n\nNitric oxide (NO) is produced by diverse sources including epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. In human airways NO appears to be important in relaxation of the human airway smooth muscle [119] . Nitric oxide (NO) may be important in a range of respiratory diseases [120] including asthma [121] and in virus infection [122] . NO is produced both by the constitutive enzymes, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)1, and NOS3 and by the inducible, calcium-independent NOS2 expressed by airway EC [123] and macrophages.\n\nIn asthma there is increased NOS2 expression and an elevated level of exhaled NO [124] that falls with corticosteroid therapy; the level of exhaled NO correlates with sputum eosinophilia and methacholine responsiveness [125] . In contrast in stable COPD, exhaled NO levels are not diff erent from normal subjects [126] although there may be an increase during exacerbations [127] . In fact in vitro cigarette smoke reduces cytokine-induced NOS2 mRNA expression in the LA-4 murine cell line, in A549 cells and in PHBEC [128] .\n\nTh e relative importance of the benefi cial antimicrobial activity of NO versus the potentially disadvantageous suppression of IFN-\u03b3 may be dependent on the specifi c pathogen. NOS2 knock-out mice show an increased susceptibility to infections [129] , perhaps because release of NO may be important for NK cell-mediated target cell killing [130] . However NO may also possess antiviral activity. In vitro RV induces NOS expression in HPBEC [131] . Th ere is increased expression of NOS2 mRNA in cultured HPBEC after RV16 infection [132] . NO inhibits RV-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF and viral replication in a human respiratory epithelial cell line [132, 133] . RSV also induces NOS2 and increases nitrite levels in supernatant from A549 cells, from HPBEC culture and in BAL fl uid from RSV-infected BALB/c mice, eff ects opposed by IL-4 and dexamethasone but unaff ected by IL-13 or IFN-\u03b3 [134] . Replication of RSV in Hep2 cells is inhibited following transfection with a retroviral construct containing NOS and this inhibition is abolished by the NOS inhibitor, NGmethyl-l -arginine [135] . Replication of infl uenza A and B in Mabin Darby kidney cells is severely impaired by the NO donor, S -nitroso-N -acetylpenicillamine [136] .\n\nOverall there is evidence that in vivo increased lower airway NO production may be of benefi t in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Work in a guinea pig model suggests that one mechanism for increased airway hyperresponsiveness during respiratory virus infection is through inhibition of NOS enzymes and a loss of NO-related relaxation of airway smooth muscle [137] . Studies of human asthmatics would also suggest that NO has a protective role in virusinduced exacerbations. Following experimental RV16 infection patients with the greatest increase in exhaled NO had smaller increases in histamine airway responsiveness [131] .\n\nIn experimental animals parainfl uenza virus-induced hyperreactivity correlates with a defi ciency in constitutive NO production [137] . Increased levels of exhaled NO are found in nonasthmatic volunteers following natural colds [138] as well as in asthmatic patients after experimental RV infection [131] . In the latter study, an inverse association between NO increase and worsening of airway hyperresponsiveness was demonstrated arguing in favor of a protective role for this substance. Th is is further supported by the observation that NO reduces cytokine production and viral replication in an in vitro model of RV infection [133] . Interestingly, studies of viral upper respiratory tract infections have failed to demonstrate an increase in nasal NO after experimental RSV, RV, and infl uenza infections [139] . In normal subjects experimental infl uenza infection increased oral NO 8 days postinfection but had no eff ect on nasal NO [140] . Th is raises the possibility that during respiratory virus infection induction of NO is selective for the lower respiratory tract.\n\nTh e responses of airway EC to virus infection are consequences of the interactions between virus and the intracellular signaling pathways of the host cell [141] . Knowledge of the mechanisms involved for rhinoviruses is currently very limited. Activation of signaling pathways may be dependent on cell surface receptor (ICAM-1, LDL-R) binding or may occur during viral replication within the cell. Th e need for replicative virus is demonstrated by the inhibition of RV induction of EC cytokines after UV inactivation. One product of replication, common to ssRNA viruses such as RV and also RSV and infl uenza, is dsRNA, which has been shown to activate components of signaling pathways including dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, IKK \u03b2 , NF-\u03ba B, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase with resultant induction of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES [110, 142] . Activation of EC by dsRNA may be direct or indirect through the interferon system as discussed above. It has also been reported that dsRNA and virus infections activate EC through binding to TLR3 [143, 144] .\n\nStudies utilizing isolated rabbit tissues and human cultured airway smooth muscle cells suggest that, for RV16, exposure to the virus may have a direct eff ect on smooth muscle cells, resulting in increased contractility to acetylcholine and impaired relaxation to isoproterenol. Th is eff ect is dependent on ICAM-1 and appears to involve an autocrine signaling mechanism including upregulation of production of IL-5 and IL-1 \u03b2 by the airway smooth muscle itself [145] . A more recent study demonstrated that RV induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was increased in smooth muscle cells from asthmatic compared to normal subjects [146] . Whether rhinovirus reaches airway smooth muscle cells in suffi cient quantity to produce a signifi cant eff ect by this mechanism in vivo is as yet unknown. Th e eff ects of other respiratory viruses on smooth muscle require further investigation.\n\nA variety of leukocytes show changes in number, site of accumulation, and activation state in response to virus infection. Since these cells are also implicated in asthmatic infl ammation of the lower airway they provide potential sites of interaction between the immunopathologies of virus infection and asthma.\n\nAlveolar macrophages are present in large numbers in the lower airway. Th ey make up around 90% of the cells seen in BAL from normal volunteers [28] . Th ey are ideally placed for early phagocytosis of virus particles and are likely to play an important role in the immune response through antigen presentation to T-cells and through the production of cytokines and other mediators. RV has been shown to enter human monocytes and macrophages which express high levels of the major RV receptor ICAM-1. It has not been possible to demonstrate RV replication within alveolar macrophages although low grade productive infection has been shown in the monocyte cell line THP-1 [147] . Replication also occurred in THP-1-derived macrophages but was limited in monocyte-derived macrophages which are relatively resistant to viral replication at least partly because of higher levels of type I interferon production [148] . RV entry into monocytes results in activation and the production of both IL-8 [147] and TNF-\u03b1 [149] . In monocyte and THP-1derived macrophages RV induction of TNF-\u03b1 is NF-\u03ba B dependent [148] .\n\nA recent study reported that infectious but not UVinactivated RV-increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 release by macrophages derived from resected lung tissue. Interestingly, infectious rhinovirus-impaired LPS and lipoteichoic acidinduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 secretion by macrophages as well as the macrophage phagocytic response to labeled bacterial particles [150] . Th is RV-induced impairment of cytokine responses to bacterial LPS and lipoteichoic acid and of phagocytosis in alveolar macrophages could lead to impairment of antibacterial host defense may have important implications in the pathogenesis of exacerbations of respiratory diseases including both asthma [151] and COPD [152] . In contrast, infection of human monocytes in vitro with infl uenza A causes alterations in structure and activation status and the production of IL-1 \u03b2 IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 IFN\u03b1 , and IFN-\u03b2 [153] , eff ects dramatically potentiated by subsequent exposure to bacterial LPS.\n\nDendritic cells are key cells in IFN production, as well as in antigen presentation both of allergens and pathogens with a capacity to induce both primary and secondary immune responses. Th ey may also play a role in the regulation of the type of T-cell-mediated immune response [154] . RV infection has been shown to induce production of the dendritic cell attracting chemokine MIP-3 \u03b1 [43] and to increase in number in the lung during RSV infection [155] , suggesting they are recruited to the lung during respiratory virus infections. However, they have also been shown to be produced from local precursors during RSV infection [156] . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are likely protective against infection as they have been shown to limit virus replication in RSV infections, as well as reducing airway infl ammation and airway hyperresponsiveness [157] . In contrast, others have reported induction of the high affi nity IgE receptor on dendritic cells during Sendai virus infection, and linked this with induction of mucus cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity [158] . Th ere is thus increasing knowledge of the immunobiology of these cells during respiratory infections but their role in the context of viral exacerbations of asthma remains unclear and further studies are needed.\n\nBronchial biopsies demonstrate increases in cells positive for CD3, CD4, and CD8 within the epithelium and submucosa of both normal and asthmatic subjects following experimental RV infection [21] and we have recently demonstrated a trend toward increased numbers of lymphocytes in BAL from asthmatic compared to normal subjects ( p \u03ed 0.06) [34] . Such increases coincided with peripheral blood lymphopenia, and reductions in blood total lymphocytes and CD8 \u03e9 T-cells correlated strongly with virus load only in asthmatic subjects [34] suggesting increased recruitment of T-cells to the asthmatic airway may be important in the context of asthma exacerbations. Since T-cells are believed to be key cells in the pathogenesis of asthma the eff ects of viruses on T-cells are of particular importance.\n\nT-cell recruitment into the airway is at least partly under the infl uence of chemokines, including those whose production by EC is upregulated by viruses. Th e nature and the eff ectiveness of the specifi c immune response may be infl uenced by the balance of chemokine production by airway EC. Th is balance may in turn be infl uenced by preexisting chronic infl ammation as found in asthma.\n\nStudies of cloned T-cells suggest that Th 1 and Th 2 cells show diff erential expression of chemokine receptors. Th ere is increased expression of CXCR3 (receptor for IP-10, I-TAC, and Mig) and CCR5 (MIP-1 \u03b2 ) in human Th 1 cells and increased expression of CCR4 (TARC and MDC) and to a lesser extent CCR3 (eotaxin and MCP-3) in Th 2 cells, with selective migration of cells in response to the appropriate chemokines. CCR1 (RANTES, MIP-1 \u03b1 , MCP-3) and CCR2 (MCP-1, -2 ,-3, -4) were found on both Th 1 and Th 2 cells [159] . Bronchial biopsies from asthmatics show high levels of expression of CCR4 and significant levels of CCR8 by T-cells [160] .\n\nIncreased recruitment of T-cells to the airway as a result of virus-induced chemokine production by EC could amplify preexisting allergic infl ammation. If the asthmatic airway microenvironment infl uences the pattern of chemokine expression following virus infection then this could alter the Th 1/Th 2 balance of the antiviral immune response.\n\nTh e CD4 \u03e9 T-cell response to virus infection is thought to be of the T-helper 1 (Th 1) type. It is thought that an eff ective antiviral immune response is characterized by the production of type 1 cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 . IFN-\u03b3 , in addition to IFN-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03b2 , and IFN-\u03bb from monocytes and macrophages, plays a role in establishing an \" antiviral state \" in neighboring cells. IFN-\u03b3 has a complex role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It appears to increase basophil and mast cell histamine release [161] but on the other hand inhibits the expression of type 2 cytokines. Production of IFN-\u03b3 is increased in PBMC [162] and in nasal secretions [104] during RV colds and in human and animal models of infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and RSV infection [119, 163, 164] . Th ere are exceptions where the antiviral response exhibits a Th 2 character or a mixture of Th 1/Th 2. In animal models of RSV, diff erent proteins of the virus may induce either Th 1 or Th 2 type responses and priming with such proteins prior to infection with whole virus can infl uence the character, eff ectiveness, and associated immunopathology of the immune response [165] .\n\nAsthma is believed to be characterized by type 2 infl ammation. Many studies have demonstrated mutual inhibition of Th 1 and Th 2 cells [166, 167] . It is therefore possible within an airway with a preexisting type 2 allergic asthmatic microenvironment that there may be inhibition of the normal eff ective type 1 antiviral immune response or that the system may be skewed toward type 2 responses.\n\nPapadopoulos et al . have shown that type 1 responses to RV are defi cient in individuals with asthma [168] . PBMC taken from asthmatics and exposed in vitro to RV show lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 and higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in culture supernatants than cells from normal subjects. Th e IFN-\u03b3 /IL-4 ratio was three times lower in the asthmatic group [168] .\n\nIn a study by Gern et al . of experimental RV16 infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis or asthma, the balance of airway Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines in induced sputum induced by viral infection was found to be related to clinical symptoms and viral clearance. Although protein could not be detected in sputum due to the presence of inhibitors of the ELISA assay used, there were increases in mRNA, as determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR, for both IL-5 and IFN-\u03b3 . An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the ratio of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA to IL-5 mRNA and peak cold symptoms. In addition subjects with RV16 still detectable 14 days after inoculation had lower IFN-\u03b3 /IL-5 ratios during the acute phase of the cold than those subjects who had cleared the virus [169] .\n\nWe have recently investigated the production of type 1 and type 2 cytokines from BAL cells in asthmatic and normal subjects. We found that production of the type 1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 were suppressed in the asthmatics, while production of the type 2 cytokines IL-4, -5 and, -13 were all increased [34] . Importantly CD4 \u03e9 T-cell production of IFN-\u03b3 was strongly inversely correlated with virus load and reductions in lung function in the asthmatic subjects when they then underwent RV experimental infection, suggesting that CD4 \u03e9 T-cell production of IFN-\u03b3 is protective in the context of RV-induced asthma [34] . Conversely, CD4 \u03e9 T-cell production of each of IL-4, -5, and -13 was positively correlated with lower respiratory symptom severity, suggesting CD4 \u03e9 T-cell production of each of IL-4, -5, and -13 are associated with more severe exacerbations. Th ese data are novel and important, but causal roles cannot be established in such human challenge studies. Investigation of the possible causal role of each these cytokines in vivo is now required using the newly developed mouse model [43] .\n\nCD8 \u03e9 T-cells are important eff ector cells in specifi c cellmediated antiviral immunity. Th ey also demonstrate polarization of cytokine production, the major Tc1 cytokine again being IFN-\u03b3 and are believed to regulate CD4 Th 1/ Th 2 balance [170] . In a murine asthma model induction of bystander CD4 \u03e9 Th 2 responses to ovalbumin resulted in a switch of virus-peptide specifi c lung CD8 \u03e9 T-cells to production of Tc2 cytokines including IL-5 with, after virus peptide challenge, induction of airway eosinophilia [171] . If this occurs in man it suggests a means whereby CD8 antiviral function could be inhibited at the same time as CD8 amplifi cation of allergic infl ammation through IL-5 induction of airway eosinophilia. Th e role of CD8 \u03e9 T-cell production of type 1 and type 2 cytokines in virus-induced asthma exacerbations requires investigation. \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u0609 T-cells \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells are a minor subset of T-cells expressing receptors distinct from the \u03b1 \u03b2 receptors found on the majority of T-cells involved in adaptive immunity. Th ere appear to be at least two types of \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells. Th e fi rst type is found in the lymphoid tissue of all vertebrates and displays highly diversifi ed receptors. Th e second type, intraepithelial \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells, display receptors of limited diversity. It has been suggested that this second subset recognize molecules expressed only by nearby infected cells. Candidate ligands are heat-shock proteins, MHC class IB molecules and unorthodox nucleotides and phospholipids. Antigen is recognized directly rather than as processed peptide presented by MHC. Recognition of molecules expressed as a consequence of infection rather than pathogen-specifi c molecules themselves would place \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells at the intersection of innate and adaptive immunity [172] .\n\nHowever, exaggerated responses to various pathogens and self tissues have been found in studies of mice defi cient in \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 \u03e9 T-cells rather than defi ciencies in control of pathogens. Such work has suggested that at least some \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 \u03e9 T-cells have a regulatory role in modulating immune responses [173] , a function consistent with their demonstrated ability to secrete regulatory cytokines when activated.\n\nIt has been reported that \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells are more numerous in the asthmatic airway [174] . A recent study found a greater capacity for production of IL-5 and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells from asthmatic subjects [175] . If virus infection results in the release of molecules from epithelial cells that activate \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells in the respiratory mucosa, such cells could provide a source of type 2 cytokines that infl uence the nature of the subsequent immune response. Th e role of \u03b3 \u03b4 -TCR \u03e9 T-cells in virusinduced asthma exacerbations requires investigation.\n\nEosinophils are increased in bronchial epithelium in biopsies taken from normal and asthmatic volunteers following experimental RV infection; in a small study eosinophilic infl ammation persisted for up to 6 weeks in asthmatic subjects [21] and in our recent study eosinophil numbers in the BAL were signifi cantly (threefold) increased in asthmatic compared to normal subjects during the acute RV infection and correlated signifi cantly with reductions in lung function only in the asthmatic subjects [34] . In allergic rhinitis experimental RV infection increases BAL eosinophils following segmental allergen challenge, again persisting for 6 weeks [28] , and increased levels of ECP are found in the sputum of RV-infected subjects [23] and during naturally occurring acute exacerbations of asthma [13] . Eosinophils accumulate in the airway under the infl uence of IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-8, RANTES, and eotaxin [176] . Of these only IL-5 has not been shown to be produced by airway EC in vitro after infection by RV. Expression of RANTES is increased in nasal secretions of children with natural virusinduced asthma [107] . RANTES is upregulated in primary nasal EC cultures by RSV [177] and RV [178] . GM-CSF is important in bone marrow eosinophil production and in eosinophil survival [176] but levels are not increased during viral upper respiratory tract infections [107, 179, 180] . Levels of eotaxin in nasal lavage rise after experimental RV16 infection [181] . Th ese data suggest a pathogenic role for eosinophils in virus-induced asthma. However, a protective role is also possible. In allergic rhinitic subjects, infected with RV after high dose allergen challenge, the severity and duration of cold symptoms were inversely related to the NL eosinophil count prior to infection [32] . Eosinophils may contribute to viral antigen presentation. Eosinophils pretreated with GM-CSF bind RV16 via ICAM-1 and present viral antigen to RV16-specifi c T-cells, inducing proliferation and secretion of IFN-\u03b3 [182] . Eosinophils have antiviral actions in parainfl uenza-infected guinea pigs [183] . EDN and ECP have ribonuclease activity and reduce RSV infectivity [184] . Th e role of the eosinophil in the antiviral immune response thus requires further evaluation.\n\nTh ese cells are important sources of infl ammatory mediators, characteristic of allergic infl ammation in asthma. Mast cell basal and stimulated histamine release increases after virus infection [185] . Airway mast cell numbers are upregulated in a rat model of parainfl uenza infection. Several viruses can enhance basophil IgE-mediated histamine release, but the role of this cell in human asthma is controversial.\n\nMast cells are also important sources of infl ammatory mediators. Th eir function and localization suggest an early interaction with viruses. Leukotriene (LT) C 4 is among the mediators responsible for the late phase of bronchospasm in asthma. During RSV infection increased levels of LTC 4 were found in the nasopharyngeal secretions of infants [186] . Levels correlated well with the symptoms of the disease with concentrations in infants presenting with bronchiolitis being fi vefold higher than in those with only upper respiratory tract symptomatology. Cultured alveolar macrophages can be infected with parainfl uenza virus and respond with an increase in arachidonic acid metabolism. Several of the products of this pathway are known inducers of airway constriction, including LTC 4 , LTD 4 , PGF 2 \u03b1 , and thromboxanes and/or stimulants of mucous secretion such as PGF 2 \u03b1 , LTB 4 , and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [187] . RV infection has been shown to induce prostaglandin and LT synthetic enzymes in bronchial biopsies in normal subjects, as well as trends for increased numbers of mast cells ( p \u03ed 0.07) bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid cysteinylleukotriene levels ( p \u03ed 0.13), but these outcomes have not been studied in asthmatic subjects [188] .\n\nNeutrophils are recruited early during respiratory viral infection in response to the production of IL-8, Gro-\u03b1 , and ENA-78 by EC and activated neutrophils are a prominent feature of severe asthma. Induced sputum IS in asthmatics and nonasthmatics demonstrates a signifi cant increase in neutrophils at day 4 of a natural cold, correlating with sputum IL-8 [189] . Similar results were obtained in IS taken 2 and 9 days after experimental RV16 infection in asthmatics. Intracellular staining demonstrated an increase in cells positive for IL-8 at day 2 attributable to increased IL-8 positive neutrophils [25] . Th e chemokine IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils but also acts on lymphocytes, basophils, and primed eosinophils. Increased IL-8 has been found in NL from children with natural colds [104] . Experimental RV16 infection of asthmatics resulted in elevated NL IL-8, correlating with cold/asthma symptom scores and histamine PC20 [25] . IS from asthmatics with exacerbations has both elevated IL-8 and neutrophilia [23, 190] . A study of experimental infection in asthmatic children also demonstrated elevated IL-8 and neutrophilia in NL during the acute infection and levels of neutrophil myeloperoxidase correlated with symptom severity [191] . In asthma, exacerbations in asthmatic adults [13] those with virus infection had increased sputum neutrophils and increased neutrophil elastase and more severe clinical disease. Such studies suggest a prominent role for the neutrophil in tissue damage during virus-induced asthma.\n\nNatural killer (NK) cells are an important part of the innate immune response, their function being the elimination of a variety of target cells including virus-infected cells and the modulation of adaptive immunity toward viruses [192] . Cell killing by NK cells may occur through natural killing, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or apoptotic killing of Fas-positive target cells via membrane bound FasL. Th e ability to directly kill virus-infected cells is regulated by a balance between inhibitory and activating receptors [193] . Killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs), Ig-like receptors that recognize HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules, and the lectin-like CD94/NKG2A receptor that interacts with HLA-E allow NK cells to recognize cells expressing normal self MHC class I [194] . Loss of inhibition occurs if potential target cells have lost class I expression following virus infection or if they display abnormal class I/peptide complexes.\n\nNK cells are rapid and effi cient producers of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 , important both in early viral infection in the antigen-independent activation of antigen presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells, and for biasing the development of CD4 \u03e9 Th 1 and CD8 \u03e9 Tc1 cells. Cytokines and chemokines shown to enhance the activities of NK cells in vitro and in vivo include IFN-\u03b1 /-\u03b2 , IFN-\u03b3 , TNF-\u03b1 , IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, MIP-1 \u03b1 MIP-1 \u03b2 , MCP-1, 2, 3, and RANTES. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and IL-10 inhibit NK cell activity [195] . Type 2 cytokines may also modulate NK function, increasing NK type 2 activities and decreasing NK type 1 activities. Human NK cells cultured in medium supplemented with IL-4 diff erentiated into NK type 2 cells, secreting IL-5 and IL-13 and when cultured in the presence of IL-12, diff erentiated into NK type 1 cells secreting IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 . IL-4 and IL-13 have also been shown to suppress IL-2induced cytolytic and proliferative activities and IFN-\u03b3 production of human NK cells [196] . NK cell production of IL-5 is enhanced by IL-4 and reduced by IL-10 and IL-12 [197] . In a mouse model of asthma, intracellular staining of NK cells has demonstrated IL-5 production and depletion of NK cells resulted in reduced airway eosinophilia [198] .\n\nTh e function of NK cells in the asthmatic airway is as yet unexplored. It may be that, in an airway environment rich in type 2 cytokines, that NK type 1 function and eff ective antiviral activity are inhibited. If this is the case then a key component of the early immune response would be defi cient and viral clearance would be impaired. In addition, if NK type 2 function is favored by the asthmatic microenvironment, production of type 2 cytokines by NK cells in response to virus infection might be one mechanism for amplifi cation of allergic infl ammation. Th ese hypotheses are as yet untested in human studies of experimental virus infection.\n\nAn elevated serum total and allergen-specifi c IgE are features of \" extrinsic \" or atopic asthma. IgE-mediated mechanisms are certainly important in the pathophysiology of extrinsic asthma. Recent studies suggest a similar airway pathology in both extrinsic and \" intrinsic \" nonatopic asthma [199] where there is an absence of specifi c serum IgE and negative skin prick tests to aeroallergens. It has been suggested that there may be the production of local IgE to as yet unknown environmental allergens in intrinsic asthma.\n\nUpregulation of total IgE or virus-/allergen-specifi c IgE locally or systemically during respiratory virus infection would be expected to contribute to the duration and severity of symptoms of an asthma exacerbation.\n\nIntranasal challenge with RV39 results in an increase in total serum IgE in allergic rhinitic subjects but no increase in preexisting allergen-specifi c IgE [200] . In children with asthma, during infection with infl uenza A there was no change in total IgE but increases were observed in specifi c serum IgE to house dust mite and in ex vivo proliferative and IL-2 responses of lymphocytes challenged with house dust mite allergen [201] . In a study of RSV infection in infants the development of serum RSV-specifi c IgE occurred more frequently in atopics and correlated with clinical wheezing, histamine levels in nasal secretions, and hypoxia [202] . Th ere is no information as yet on the presence of local virus-specifi c IgE in the airway during asthma exacerbations.\n\nIncreasing interest in the clinical features and pathogenesis of COPD refl ects the worldwide importance of the disease. More than 14 million patients are aff ected in the United States alone. It is predicted to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 [203] . National and global initiatives have been launched and management guidelines have been published [204, 205] .\n\nTh e frequency of exacerbations is a major factor in the quality of life of patients with COPD [206] . Th e typical clinical features of an exacerbation include increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production, and worsened gas exchange. Although noninfectious causes of exacerbations such as allergy, air pollution, or inhaled irritants including cigarette smoke may be important, acute airway infections are the major precipitants [207] . Th e infection and consequent host infl ammatory response result in increased airway obstruction.\n\nIt is likely that two-thirds to three-quarters of COPD exacerbations may be caused by viral infections. In a study of 186 patients rhinoviruses, infl uenza virus, parainfl uenza virus, and coronavirus were signifi cantly associated with COPD exacerbations [208] . Between 60% and 70% of exacerbations are associated with preceding symptoms of a common cold. Th e frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization is higher in the winter. One explanation for this could be the increased frequency of respiratory viruses at this time of the year. A recent study of 321 exacerbations in 83 patients with moderate to severe COPD using new diagnostic methods including RT-PCR shows a high incidence of viral infection [209] . Viruses were detected in nasal aspirates at exacerbation in almost 40% of cases. Rhinovirus was the most common, occurring in 58% of cases where a virus was present. Th e presence of virus was associated with increased dyspnea, cold symptoms, and sore throat and with prolonged recovery from exacerbation. Earlier studies relying on serology and virus culture quote lower virus detection rates of 15-20% [208, [210] [211] [212] . Other studies of more severe exacerbations using more comprehensive PCR methods confi rmed the importance of virus infection, with viruses being detected in around 50% of exacerbations [152, 213] . Because these studies all involve sampling relatively late in the course of illness, it is likely that these detection rates underestimate the true importance of virus infections.\n\nTh e role of bacteria in precipitating exacerbations is also somewhat controversial. Bacteria may have a primary role in the development of an exacerbation and/or represent a secondary superinfection of an initial viral process. Various bacterial species are present in the airways of 25-40% of patients, even when the COPD is stable but increased frequency of recovery of bacteria during exacerbations ( \u03f3 55%) as well as higher bacterial loads during exacerbations both suggest that they play an important role in a signifi cant number [152, 214, 215] . Signifi cant bacterial infection has been suggested when there is an abundance of neutrophils in the sputum [216] and when the sputum is purulent and green (due to neutrophil myeloperoxidase) [217] . Bacteria may contribute to the pathogenesis of an exacerbation due to increased bacterial loads of bacteria already colonizing diseased airways, however in addition to this, acquisition of new bacterial strains has also been shown to be important, increasing the risk of exacerbation over twofold [218] .\n\nTh e major bacterial organisms associated with COPD exacerbations are nontypable Haemophilis infl uenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis [219, 220] . Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae may play a part [221, 222] . Evidence also suggests that in more severe patients with a baseline FEV 1 of 35% predicted or less, gram-negative bacteria especially enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas play an important part in acute exacerbations [223] .\n\nRecent studies have addressed the role of coinfection with both bacteria and viruses -one study showed this to occur in 25% of exacerbations, and that patients with dual infection had more marked lung function impairment and longer hospitalizations [152] . Another reported that exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV 1 fall was greater and symptom count was higher than those with a bacterial pathogen alone [224] . Th us even in exacerbations in which viruses are detected, bacteria can also contribute to exacerbation severity.\n\nAlthough the results of placebo-controlled trials show confl icting results, overall the eff ects of antibiotic treatment also support an etiological role for bacteria in exacerbations in some patients. A meta-analysis of nine studies showed a small overall benefi t when antibiotics were used for COPD exacerbations [225] . Th e largest study included 362 exacerbations in 173 outpatients [216] . Compared with placebo, the rate of symptom resolution and improvement of peak expiratory fl ow during exacerbations was slightly but significantly faster when patients were treated with co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, or doxycycline. More importantly, treatment failures as defi ned by respiratory deterioration were nearly twice as likely in the placebo group. Benefi t from antibiotics was most evident for patients with most symptoms (dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and sputum purulence).\n\nGuidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of COPD are unclear because of the diffi culties in defi ning the role of bacterial infection in an individual case. Th e American Th oracic Society statement on COPD [205] suggests using antibiotics if there is evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, CXR changes) but not all patients with bacterial bronchial infection have fever (this is more common in viral infection or pneumonia) and few have CXR changes. Th e European Respiratory Society recommends antibiotics if the sputum is purulent, using standard antibiotics as fi rst line, and sputum culture if these fail [226] .\n\nBacterial infection has a defi nite role in the pathogenesis of other chronic lung diseases such as cystic fi brosis and bronchiectasis where bacterial infection is chronic, causing not only acute exacerbations but also infl uencing long-term prognosis [207] .\n\nIn these diseases chronic bacterial infection occurs as the host immune response is unable to clear the bacteria, the continuous infection leads to continuous infl ammatory responses and continuous tissue damage [207] . Host and bacterial factors attract and activate neutrophils, which produce proteinases and reactive oxygen species. Lung antiproteinase defenses are overwhelmed. Both proteinase enzymes and reactive oxygen species cause damage to the epithelium, stimulating mucus production and impairing mucociliary clearance. Neutrophil elastase stimulates epithelial cell production of the chemokine IL-8 which attracts further neutrophils and in addition impairs phagocytosis by destroying antibody and cleaving complement receptors from neutrophils and complement components from bacteria. Neutrophils are also stimulated by cigarette smoke.\n\nIdentifi cation of bacteria during exacerbation is also associated with increased levels of infl ammatory mediators in BAL and/or sputum. Th ese include reactive oxidant species, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 , neutrophil elastase, LTB 4 , and myeloperoxidase and many others. Th ese clearly have potential to cause considerable tissue damage, as well as further recruitment and activation of infl ammatory cells. COPD patients, particularly those at the more severe end of the disease spectrum, may also be chronically colonized by bacteria between exacerbations, bacterial numbers then increasing during exacerbations. In a study using bronchoscopic protected brush specimens [214] 10 of 40 COPD patients were colonized with bacteria when stable. During exacerbations 50% had bacteria present and when present, bacterial numbers were greater. When protected brush specimens were taken during severe acute exacerbations of COPD requiring ventilation [227] bacteria were detected in 50% but it was not possible to distinguish patients more likely to have bacteria on the basis of clinical features or other investigations.\n\nTh e major bacterial pathogens isolated during bronchial infections all form part of the commensal fl ora in the nasopharynx. Bronchial infections occur in patients with abnormal airways with reduced host defenses. Persistence of bacteria within the bronchial tree may come about through toxins that impair mucociliary clearance, enzymes that breakdown local immunoglobulin, products that alter immune eff ector cell function, adherence to mucus and damaged epithelium, or other mechanisms of avoiding immune surveillance [207, 228] .\n\nBacterial colonization in the stable state represents an equilibrium in which the number of bacteria present in the bronchial tree is contained by the host defenses but not eliminated. During an exacerbation this equilibrium is upset and bacterial numbers increase, inciting an infl ammatory response. Change will usually occur because of a change in the host rather than altered virulence of the bacteria, for example as a result of viral infection.\n\nExacerbations associated with viral infections also have increased levels of many infl ammatory mediators also found in bacterial exacerbations including TNF-\u03b1 , IL-8, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and LTB 4 . In contrast to bacterial exacerbations where neutrophils and neutrophil products predominate, during a viral exacerbation both neutrophils and eosinophils are present and eosinophil products such as ECP are also increased [152] . Other mediators implicated include ENA-78, RANTES, and endothelin-1 [229] .\n\nIt has also been suggested that persistent virus infection contributes to the progression of COPD. In particular, adenovirus appears to persist in a latent form in which viral proteins are produced without replication of complete virus. Such latent infection may amplify lung infl ammation due to cigarette smoke [230] . Adenoviral E1A DNA persists in human lungs from patients with COPD compared with patients of similar age, sex, and smoking history who do not have COPD [231] . Th e E1A protein has been demonstrated in airway epithelial cells from smokers [232] . It is able to amplify many host genes through attachment to the DNA-binding sites of transcription factors [233] . Airway epithelial cells transfected with E1A produce excess infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-8 [234] and surface adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 [235] after in vitro challenge by an NF-\u03ba B-dependent mechanism [236] .\n\nRSV has been identifi ed in induced sputum from patients with stable COPD. Th ese individuals have a higher plasma fi brinogen and serum IL-6, a higher pCO 2 and increased frequency of exacerbations [209] . Th is suggests either that low grade persistent RSV infection contributes to COPD severity or that patients with more severe COPD are less able to clear RSV from the airway.\n\nTh e immunology of virus infection in COPD is not well understood. Less data is available than for virus infection in asthma since this has not been a major subject of human experimental infection studies. In a small safety study of four patients, inoculation with low dose RV16 resulted in symptomatic colds, viral replication, signifi cant increases in lower respiratory tract symptoms, and reductions in PEF and FEV 1 typical of an acute exacerbation of COPD [237] . Further studies are clearly needed in view of the increasing evidence for a major role for viruses in causing COPD exacerbations.\n\nCurrently much of the treatment of infective exacerbations of asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of increased bronchodilators, either short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists in inhaled or intravenous form or anticholinergics or theophyllines, or supportive in the form of oxygen and in severe cases noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. Corticosteroids are widely used in inhaled or oral form for their anti-infl ammatory actions. Th e eff ects of corticosteroids are the result of actions at many points in various infl ammatory cascades. Whilst this undoubtedly contributes to their benefi cial eff ects it also results in signifi cant local and systemic side eff ects, in particular if oral steroid treatment is prolonged or frequent. In addition systemic steroids may interfere with the antiviral immune response resulting in reduced viral clearance [238] .\n\nIn persistent asthma, control of disease is achieved predominantly with inhaled corticosteroids. Th ere is a role for additional drugs such as long-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists and leukotriene antagonists. Th e long-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists in particular appear to increase the eff ectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids allowing the dose needed to achieve control to be reduced [239] . Th ere is also evidence that these drugs in combination with inhaled corticosteroids may further reduce exacerbation frequency [240] . Th e leukotriene antagonists appear to be most eff ective in treating or preventing exacerbations in children [241, 242] .\n\nRegular corticosteroid treatment is however only partially eff ective at preventing exacerbations. In adult asthma inhaled steroids reduce exacerbation frequency by only 40% [243] . In school age children inhaled steroids are ineff ective at reducing exacerbation frequency, duration, or severity [244] . In preschool age children with virus-induced wheeze oral steroids are ineff ective even in those with primed eosinophils [245] .\n\nSpecifi c antibiotic therapy is available for bacterial infections and is indicated where there is good evidence of such infection or when the exacerbation is severe and bacterial involvement is a possibility.\n\nHowever, as discussed above the majority of infective asthma exacerbations are of viral rather than bacterial origin and viruses are also common in exacerbations of COPD.\n\nTh e success of vaccination to prevent respiratory virus infections has been limited by signifi cant variation within the major virus types causing disease. Th ere are 102 serotyped strains of rhinovirus and several more that have not been serotyped and no eff ective vaccine has been introduced. A decavalent vaccine [246] developed in the 1970s was ultimately of limited effi cacy. Th e infl uenza viruses display antigenic shift and drift. Vaccines must be modifi ed every 2-3 years to cover the strains prevalent at the time. Vaccination against RSV experienced a major setback in the 1960s when the use of formalin-inactivated virus in young babies resulted in increased disease severity following subsequent virus infection [247] . Eighty percent of vaccinated children required hospitalization when subsequently infected with RSV, as compared to 5% of controls. Th e lungs of two vaccinated children who died contained eosinophilic infi ltrates. It has been suggested that formalin inactivation may have modifi ed epitopes within the RSV G and F surface glycoproteins, resulting in a modifi ed immune response to subsequent infection with enhanced immunopathology [248] . Vaccinated individuals demonstrate a number of diff erences from individuals who have suff ered natural RSV infection including a lack of specifi c mucosal antibodies and defi cient neutralizing and fusion-inhibiting serum antibodies [249] . Th ere are also diff erences in the cell-mediated immune response with some vaccinated individuals demonstrating peripheral eosinophilia and exaggerated lymphocytic proliferative responses to RSV [250] . To protect against RSV infection a successful vaccine would need to provide more eff ective protection than natural infection, which is itself frequently followed by reinfection [251] , and would have to be administered early in infancy to have an eff ect on infant bronchiolitis.\n\nSimple nonspecifi c treatments for the common cold do exist although their effi cacy is debated. Vitamin C and zinc gluconate [252] both may shorten the duration of a cold by 1-2 days. Th e inhalation of humidifi ed hot air provides symptomatic relief [253] . Nasal IFN-\u03b1 is an eff ective treatment for the common cold [254] but must be given either prior to or shortly after exposure to the virus. It is also expensive and is associated with signifi cant local side eff ects such as bleeding and discharge. Th ese problems have limited its clinical use. However IFN therapy for virus-induced asthma exacerbations may be more useful in view of the defi ciencies identifi ed by recent studies. Further because of the large number of viruses producing similar clinical syndromes, the general antiviral properties of IFNs would provide signifi cant advantage over the use of specifi c antiviral drugs.\n\nSpecifi c antiviral agents exist for infl uenza. Amantidine and rimantidine are eff ective against infl uenza A. Th e use of amantidine has been limited by CNS side eff ects such as dizziness and insomnia; fewer such side eff ects are seen with rimantidine. Both drugs are indicated during epidemics for treatment and prophylaxis in high risk groups including asthmatics. Neither is active against infl uenza B. Two neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, are active against both infl uenza A and B [255] [256] [257] . Th ese agents are eff ective in preventing infection when used as prophylaxis during the infl uenza season and, as treatment, they reduce the duration of illness if started within 36-48 h of the onset of illness. Zanamivir must be given by inhalation whereas oseltamivir can be given orally. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog active against RSV in vivo and also against infl uenza in vitro . Nebulized ribavirin therapy is licensed for use in hospitalized infants and children in the fi rst 3 days of RSV bronchiolitis. It is however expensive and of unproven benefi t on clinical outcome. Because of its toxicity it is not appropriate for asthma. RSV enriched immunoglobulin was eff ective as prophylaxis for infants at high risk of RSV bronchiolitis [258] but has been superseded by RSV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [259] .\n\nRV are a major target for drug treatment. It has been estimated that rhinoviruses result in 6-10 colds per year in young children [260] . As yet no eff ective agent is available for clinical use. Capsid-binding/canyon inhibitors block RV binding to host cell receptor (ICAM-1 in the case of the major group). One example in phase 3 clinical trials is pleconaril (Picovir). Th ese drugs can be extremely potent but their clinical usefulness is often limited by toxicity, the need for rapid initiation of therapy and the possible development of resistance. Alternative targets include soluble ICAM-1 which inhibits major rhinovirus infection and conserved viral enzymes such as protein 3D, the RNAdependent RNA transcriptase, protein 2C, the associated ATP-helicase, and the cysteine protease 3C.\n\nAlternative approaches to direct antiviral therapy are suppression of virus-induced infl ammation, or strategies that promote innate or type 1 immune responses in individuals with excessive type 2 responses. Understanding the complexities of the antiviral immune response, in particular how it may be altered in the context of preexisting chronic airway diseases such as asthma is an essential fi rst step. Further work is needed to elucidate the important sites of interaction between the immunological networks of asthma and of virus infection. Greater knowledge is required if we are to identify key targets for therapeutic intervention, the aim of which will be to minimize immunopathology whilst maintaining or enhancing the host anti-viral immune response."}
