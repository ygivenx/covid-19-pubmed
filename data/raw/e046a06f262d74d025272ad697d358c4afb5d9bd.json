{"title": "Application and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection", "body": "In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origins were identified in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China 1 . On Jan 7, a novel coronavirus was discovered using high-throughput sequencing in the throat swab sample of a patient , and is currently named SARS-CoV-2(previously known as 2019-nCoV)on February 11, 2020 by ICTV 2,3 . The initial defined cases of COVID-19, were epidemiologically linked to the human seafood market in Wuhan, Although later more and more COVID-19 were found without exposure the market but with a history to Wuhan or contact with the patient of COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed 2,4,5 . Current epidemiologic data indicate the Fever, cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A manifestation similar of those of two other disease caused by coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [18] [19] [20] . CT is an important method in the diagnosis of lung lesions, and the radiological changes in the lungs of COVID-19 patients has been characterized 21 . Zhong et al. reported that of 840 COVID-19 patients who underwent CT on admission, around 76.4% manifested abnormal CT imaging features and usually exhibited typical radiological finding of the ground-glass opacity (50%) or bilateral patchy shadowing (46%) 22 .\n\nBased on the \"Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for New Coronavirus Pneumonia (the fifth edition), China\", CT scan were used as the clinical diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia, but strictly limited in Hubei Province 23 . However, the specificity of chest CT is relatively low\uff0calone could not distinguish the SARS-CoV-2 infection from other pathogens well.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 causes extensively outbreak in cold winter. In this season, many other pathogens causing pneumonia also become prevalent, even including many viral agent. The infectious diseases share some common characteristics in signs, symptoms and laboratory findings. Therefor it is difficult to differentiate COVID-19 suffers from other pneumonia patients purely depending to the manifestation or routine examination. Therefore , an precision screening scheme is urgent to be employed. High sensitive test is pivotal to avoiding secondary transmission by missed diagnosed cases.\n\nMeanwhile, the positive predictive value also should be counted, for a number of false positive would bring out not only occupation and cost of healthcare resource, but also increasing infection risk of suspected cases isolated in hospital. In this study, we performed a retrospective study in the 568 cases and compare the efficacy of RT-PCR and CT diagnostic approaches in COVID-19 diagnosis, and to provide evidence for future strategic diagnosis in regions outside Hubei Province.\n\n.

During this period, RT-PCR and chest CT was performed for consecutive patients including the local residents of Wuhan, outside of Wuhan did have a recent travel to Wuhan or contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan, or had fever or acute respiratory symptoms of unknown cause. Of the 16 patients recruited as of Feb 11, had a suspected diagnosis and were therefore excluded in this study. 87 patients, who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 and 481 patients exclusion COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance, were enrolled in this study. The performances of the first RT-PCR detection in pharyngeal swabs and chest CT were evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, youden's index et al. Then the performances of combination of the second RT-PCR, or chest CT were also calculated. Agreement between the two method was analyzed using\n\nMcNemar Chi-squared test. Finally the all RT-PCR results from pharyngeal and stool were plotted by time to explore the value of stool nucleic detection (Fig 1) . The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was defined based on the international guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia 24 . Laboratory and CT characteristics data were obtained with standard data collection forms from electronic medical records.\n\nThe study was approved by The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from patients involved before enrolment when data were collected retrospectively.\n\n.

The upper respiratory tract specimens (pharyngeal and nasal swabs) and stool were obtained from all the cases. Ensure each specimen collected has the name, gender and age of the patient as well as a serial number; any abnormality in the specimen should be noted.\n\nRNA was extracted and tested by real-time RT-PCR with SARS-Cov-2 specific primers and probes according to instruction of Kit. The real-time RT-PCR was carried out in biosafety level 2 facilities at the clinic laboratory. If two targets (RdRp+, E or N +) tested positive by specific RT-PCR, the patients would be considered to be laboratory-confirmed.\n\nNegative: no Ct value or Ct 40.\n\nPositive: a Ct value < 37.\n\nA Ct value between 37-40 is indeterminate. It is required confirmation by repeating. If, when repeated, the Ct value is < 37 the sample is positive, otherwise, it is negative. .

We looked through the case data retrospectively and found that 5 patients without CT scan were admitted to hospital complaining of epidemiology contact. Although they were eventually diagnosed, they had only mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection on admission and in the course of infection, and no CT scan had been performed.\n\nIn the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, RT-PCR for pharyngeal and CT scan is the main Besides that, we also analyze the agreement of the two methods (The cases with uncertain CT results were not involved in statistical analysis due to statistical limitations). As is shown in Table3, there was statistically significance between the two methods (p<0.001). Moreover, there was statistically differences in the diagnosis of non-COVID-19 patients(p<0.001), but not in COVID-19\n\npatients (p=0.734). The agreement was good to fair agreement (kappa value, 0.430) , and the adjusted agreement was 72.8% in all patients.\n\n.

The average time of nucleic acid screening was earlier than that of CT scan statistically (-0.7390days, -3625~1.674) ( Table 4) It is notable that both of the methods acquired the sensitivity less than 80% in screening SARS-CoV-22 infections, which is not ideal enough for the diagnosis of infectious diseases with severe consequences.
