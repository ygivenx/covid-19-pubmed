{"title": "Common cold in Team Finland during 2018 Winter Olympic Games (PyeongChang): epidemiology, diagnosis including molecular point-of-care testing (POCT) and treatment", "body": "Elite athletes are predisposed to the common cold due to heavy physical and mental stress which may suppress both innate and adaptive immunity.1\u20135 Air travel, human crowding, housing with other athletes and competition all increase the susceptibility of an elite athlete to the common cold.6 The Winter Olympic Games take place during periods of low temperatures and its timing coincides with epidemics of many respiratory viruses. The common cold has been said to be \u2018the most dreaded opponent\u2019 at the Winter Olympic Games, and may ruin the athlete\u2019s long-term goal of success.7\n\n\nThe common cold is a prevalent, complex and heterogeneous illness.8 More than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist, and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies.9 10 Signs and symptoms of different viral infections overlap, and it is not possible to identify the aetiological agent on clinical grounds alone.11 12 Antiviral treatment is only available for influenza, but virus-specific preventive measures may reduce the transmission of illnesses.13 14\n\n\nThe aim of our prospective observational study was to investigate the occurrence and aetiology of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. We used recently developed molecular multiplexed POCT for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus at the Games site.15 16 After the Games, we used laboratory-based PCR testing to detect 16 possible causative respiratory viruses.\n\nThis prospective observational study was carried out during the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea between 26 January and 28 February 2018. During the Games, the temperature and humidity measured by Team Finland varied between \u221217\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C and between 12% and 77%, respectively. Monitoring of the common cold was provided to Team Finland members who stayed in the Olympic Village (45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members) and the two hotels outside the village (22 staff members) (figure 1). The mean age of the athletes (n=45) was 27 (SD 6) years and the mean age of the staff members (n=68) was 44 (SD 9). Thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female. The team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their Olympic trip, starting from their departure from Helsinki airport and finishing with their return to Helsinki airport, thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min. On their departure, all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion. The team members stayed in PyeongChang for a median length of 21 days (with a range of 10\u201332 days). They lived in groups of 5\u20136 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats.\n\nAll team members were instructed to immediately report symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection to the chief physician (MV), who stayed in the same building. At the onset of a symptom, two nasal mucus specimens (one from each nostril) were collected at a depth of 3\u20134 cm using flocked nasal swabs (503CS01, Copan Flock Technologies, Brescia, Italy). One specimen was used immediately for POCT and the other was refrigerated in a dry storage tube (553C, Copan Flock Technologies, Brescia, Italy) in the team\u2019s medical room. Swabs were also taken from subjects exposed to a patient with the common cold. Specimens for POCT were collected as part of the medical care of the team members.\n\nAll study-related activities were conducted according to good clinical practice, which includes the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nThe common cold was defined as the acute onset of any of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and cough.8 In addition, fever (an axillary temperature \u226537.8\u00b0C), hoarseness and lethargy were recorded on a standardised form in the evening on a four-point severity scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe).17 The total symptom score for the first 5 days of illness was calculated.\n\nA fast, automated POCT, the Cepheid Xpert Influenza+RSV Xpress Assay, was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.16 A nasal swab was suspended into 3 mL of universal transport medium (UTM, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) and 300 \u00b5L of suspension was added into the assay cartridge, which was then loaded into the Cepheid GeneXpert II instrument. After a processing time of 30 min, the test reading was recorded.\n\nFor laboratory testing, stored specimens were suspended into 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. Nucleic acids were extracted from 500 \u00b5L aliquots of the suspended specimens with the MagNA Pure 96 System using a MagNA Pure 96 DNA Viral NA LV 2.0 kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the Pathogen Universal 500 3.1 protocol and an elution volume of 50 \u00b5L. The extracted nucleic acids were stored at \u221270\u00b0C between analyses. Allplex Respiratory Panels 1\u20134 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and the CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) instrument were used in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to detect respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, parainfluenza type 1\u20134 viruses, human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus using 8 \u00b5L of each specimen per panel. The AllPlex Respiratory Panel also detected the following bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A laboratory-designed triplex RT-PCR assay for influenza A, A/H1pdm09 and B viruses was performed as described earlier, with the exception that NxtScript DNA Master (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and Mic PCR instrument (Bio Molecular Systems, Upper Coomera, QLD, Queensland, Australia) were used for the PCR step.18 In addition, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected using a triplex RT-PCR assay as described earlier, with the exception that SensiFAST Probe No-ROX kit (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany), and Mic PCR instrument were used for the PCR step.19\n\n\nA virus cluster was defined as three detections of the same virus during the median length of 3 weeks. This was considered an unusual aggregation event.\n\nThe difference between proportions was tested with a binomial standard normal deviation (SND) test and 95% CIs were calculated accordingly.\n\nForty-two out of 112 team members reported symptoms of respiratory infection during the study period of 10\u201332 days (median 21 days). There were 20 athletes (45%) and 22 (32%) staff members (p=0.123, 95% CI \u22125.2 to 31.2). Two athletes and two staff members suffered from a febrile illness. The mean duration of the symptoms was 8.3 (SD 7.8) days and 8.7 (SD 8.9) days in the athletes and the staff, respectively. One athlete and one staff member suffered from symptoms throughout their entire stay in the village (figure 2). Symptoms were mostly mild, and the mean total severity score was 6.4 (SD 5.9) for the athletes and 7.3 (SD 5.7) for the staff (table 1). Only one athlete lost a competition on 1 day due to a respiratory infection.\n\nOnsite, the aetiology of respiratory infections was identified in 11 of 42 (26%) symptomatic cases. Before the Games, two cases of influenza B were detected by local healthcare services using antigen detection. POCT in the team\u2019s medical room detected one case of influenza A virus, three cases of influenza B virus and five cases of respiratory syncytial virus A. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in six athletes and in five staff members. All six patients with an influenza virus infection were treated with oseltamivir. Oseltamivir prophylaxis was given to their 32 contacts (11 athletes). None of them developed a symptomatic infection.\n\nThe aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 30 of 42 patients, in 15 of 20 (75%) athletes and in 15 of 22 (68%) staff members. Nine different respiratory viruses were identified. Coronaviruses (229E, NL63 and OC43) were the most commonly detected viruses (table 1). Two participants had two viruses (respiratory syncytial virus A and coronavirus OC43; and coronavirus 229E and coronavirus NL63). One athlete suffered from two different coronavirus (OC43 and 229E) infections 20 days apart. The recorded PCR threshold values mostly indicated low viral loads (table 1, figure 2). In five athletes and nine staff members (p=0.117), the PCR cycle threshold values were <27, indicating high viral load (figure 2). In 8 out of 20 virus-positive cases, a previous or later nasal specimen was virus-negative.\n\nNasal mucus samples were taken from 34 asymptomatic subjects due to close contact to a symptomatic subject. Eight samples were virus-positive (rhinovirus 3, coronavirus 229E 3, coronavirus NL63 2).\n\nMultiplexed PCR-testing for nasal bacteria identified H. influenzae in seven subjects and S. pneumoniae in two subjects. Co-detection with a respiratory virus was found in three out of nine cases. No cases of atypical bacteria were identified. Clinically no cases of probable bacterial infections were recorded.\n\nEleven specimens were not available for retesting in the laboratory. All other POCT results were confirmed in the laboratory.\n\nFour athletes competed with mild symptoms of the common cold. One athlete competed 5 days after the onset of an influenza B infection, another competed 5 days after the onset of a respiratory syncytial virus A infection and two athletes competed five days after the onset of a metapneumovirus infection.\n\nOne subject reported nasal congestion when departing Finland. Respiratory syncytial virus A was detected at the Olympic Village. Six days later, the neighbouring team member in the aeroplane developed symptomatic respiratory syncytial virus A -infection. The next respiratory syncytial virus A cases were identified consequently 10, 16 and 17 days after the initial respiratory syncytial virus A detection.\n\nOne subject developed a febrile influenza B infection during the 9-hour outbound flight. Another subject on the same flight (seated one row behind) developed an influenza B infection 1.5 days later. Three more subjects were infected with the influenza B virus. These cases were separate and were not known to be in contact with the earlier cases.\n\nOne subject developed nasal congestion during the 9-hour flight, later detected to be a respiratory syncytial virus B infection. The subject was seated in business class and was isolated for 4 days in the Olympic Village. No other team member was infected with respiratory syncytial virus B.\n\nOne subject reported a sore throat and mild lethargy 6 days after the departure. Metapneumovirus was detected. Metapneumovirus was detected in team members consequently 8, 13, 15 and 18 days after the initial metapneumovirus detection.\n\nRhinovirus was detected in two samples from asymptomatic individuals 3 days and 4 days after their departure from Finland. One subject later arrived in the village with a symptomatic rhinovirus infection. One more subject developed nasal congestion in the village and one asymptomatic subject staying outside the village was predisposed to influenza B infection. In both cases, rhinovirus infection was later laboratory-confirmed. According to the incubation time and known contacts, the rhinovirus infections in the team were considered separate.\n\nCoronavirus 229E was detected in two subjects on February 13. The following cases were identified consequently 7, 8 (2 cases), 9 (4 cases) and 10 (2 cases) days after the initial detections. Three of these infections were asymptomatic. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in one subject 1 day after the subject departed Helsinki. Two further cases were identified 2 and 4 days after the initial case. Two asymptomatic coronavirus NL63 cases were identified on February 12. Two and one symptomatic subjects were detected 5 and 13 days later.\n\nAltogether seven virus clusters were identified. Four clusters (respiratory syncytial virus A, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and NL63) occurred within the same sport discipline (table 2). Inter-disciplinary transmission was rare (data not shown).\n\nTwo previous studies by the IOC reported 2% and 4% incidences of respiratory infections in elite athletes during the Vancouver 2010 and the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, respectively.20 21 Our observation (45%) contrasts those observations. The IOC\u2019s reporting system may not be reliable because it is based on voluntary reporting by team physicians, who may not be properly informed within the team. At the onset of the Games, in our study, the team physician informed all team members about the monitoring of the common cold. She stayed in the same building as the team which allowed for daily encounters with the majority of team members. Even one symptom or mild symptoms were reported.22 In agreement with our observations, 48% of 44 Norwegian cross-country skiers self-reported becoming ill during or 10 days immediately after the Tour de Ski.23\n\n\nOur study is the first to detect the aetiology of respiratory infections in elite athletes using molecular POCT at a major event. All available POCT virus diagnoses (positive and negative) were later confirmed at a laboratory. Diagnostics had clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections. In addition to early treatment with oseltamivir, POCT enabled effective post-contact oseltamivir prophylaxis for close contacts, for example, those living in the same accommodation or travelling on the same flight or in the same vehicle.14 The isolation of infected team members was initiated after the onset of symptoms and continued for 3\u20134 days (ie, the most infectious period).24\u201327\n\n\nWe detected the probable causative virus in 75% of the elite athletes with the common cold. Causality is supported by a 4%\u20136% occurrence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults.28 29 Only two earlier studies carried out in Australia in warm climate conditions have investigated the viral aetiology of acute respiratory symptoms in summer sport elite athletes. In one study the recovery rate was 29% and in the other it was 27%.30 31 These low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation. Our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion. The virus recovery rate of 75% in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults.9 10 A higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because PCR tests may detect only 50%\u201390% of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections.13 32 The occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members. The difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes. It is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff (table 1). Before and during the Winter Games, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in Finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in South Korea. The prevailing virus epidemics obviously contributed to the transmission of the infections.\n\nIn three subjects, the symptoms of the common cold\u2014one caused by influenza B virus and the others by respiratory syncytial virus A and B\u2014developed during the 9-hour flight from Helsinki to Seoul. Two patients seemed to transmit the illness to another team member during the flight. Long-haul air travel is a well-known risk factor for the transmission of contagious diseases. One person with influenza can transmit the infection to 5\u201310 people during an intercontinental flight.33 Two cases of coronavirus OC43 infection were most probably travelling during the incubation period of the infection (3.5 days) and developed the illness within 2\u20133 days after arrival in the Olympic Village.27 34 In addition, the first cases of rhinovirus and metapneumovirus infections were detected during the first week, suggesting that these infections also originated in Finland.34 In addition to direct or indirect contact and droplets, respiratory viruses can spread via exhaled aerosols, even while talking.35 36 Viruses may stay infectious on a surface for hours or days. The most commonly detected coronavirus 229E, stays infectious on common surfaces for at least 7 days.37 Interestingly, it was recently shown that viruses can also spread through toilet flushing.38 Ultimately, 7 clusters of different respiratory virus infections were recorded. Important factors in the transmission of the viruses were the housing with other athletes and the sport discipline (table 1). Competition venues may be a favourable environment for virus transmission. Rigorous hand washing, the use of hand sanitisers, enhanced disinfection and strict patient isolation were likely to prevent the spread of viruses within the team but were apparently not very effective (figure 2). This is due to the multifactorial transmission mechanisms of viral infections.39\n\n\nThe number of subjects was small. Nasal swabs were planned to be taken from symptomatic subjects as part of normal healthcare. The prevalence and clinical significance of asymptomatic infections (eg, most coronavirus and influenza infections are asymptomatic) and prolonged virus shedding (ie, infectiousness) remains unclear. The POCT diagnostics detected only three respiratory viruses.16 The 2018 influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were prominent, which may have increased our detection rate and affected the generalisability of the findings. Our study did not answer the question concerning the impact of a symptomatic or asymptomatic respiratory virus infection on an elite athlete\u2019s performance.\n\nMolecular POCT diagnostics proved clinically valuable. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in the majority of cases. The viruses were readily transmitted within the team. We believe comprehensive viral POCT is useful at major sporting events."}
