In infected cells, the CoV RNA-23 synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are 24 transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). While double-membrane vesicles 25 (DMVs) appear to be a pan-coronavirus RO element, studies to date describe an assortment The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005298 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 DMVs would pose the conundrum of how metabolites and newly made genomic and 64 subgenomic mRNAs could be transported across the double-lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, 65 experimental evidence for the location of vRNA synthesis within the RO was lacking. 66 Importantly, dsRNA is not a bona fide marker for vRNA synthesis as it may no longer be 67 associated with the active enzymatic replication complexes in which most of the 16 viral non-68 structural proteins (nsps) come together. Thus, the possibility of vRNA synthesis taking place 69 in alternative locations, like the convoluted membranes (CM) that are also prominent 70 elements of the beta-CoV RO [15, 20, 21] , was entirely possible and started to attract 71 attention. Notably, DMVs can be also formed in the absence of vRNA synthesis by 72 expression of key transmembrane nsps [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, several studies suggested a lack of 73 direct correlation between the number of DMVs and the level of CoV replication in the 74 infected cell [27, 28] . 75 The interpretation of the CoV RO structure and function was further compounded by the 76 discovery of different RO elements, never reported in beta-CoV infections, that set apart 77 other distantly-related CoVs genera. In particular, zippered ER (instead of CM) and double-78 membrane spherules (DMSs) were detected for the avian gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis 79 virus (IBV) [29] and, recently, for the porcine deltacoronavirus [30] . The size and topology 80 of these DMSs, invaginations in the zippered ER, were remarkably similar to those of the 81 spherular invaginations induced by other +RNA viruses and, consequently, DMSs were 82 suggested to be sites of vRNA synthesis [29, 31] . 83 In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and function of the RO induced 84 by members of different CoV genera, with a special focus on beta-CoVs like SARS-CoV and 85 MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) [32, 33] \n\n106 double-membrane spherules (DMSs) 107 We first set out to analyse the ultrastructure of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells under sample 108 preparation conditions favourable for autoradiography (see Materials and Methods) (Fig 1, S1 109 Video). Strikingly, in addition to the DMVs and CM that are well established hallmarks of 110 beta-CoV infections, the presence of small spherules, occasionally in large numbers, was 111 readily apparent (Fig 1A and 1B) . These spherules were notably similar to the DMSs 112 previously described for the gamma-CoV IBV [29] . Their remarkably regular size of ~80 nm 113 (average diameter 79.8 \u00b1 2.5 nm, n=58), a delimiting double membrane and their electron-114 dense content, made these spherules clearly distinct from other structures, including progeny 115 virions, which had comparable diameter (Fig 1C and 1D ). The double-membrane spherules 116 (DMSs) generated during IBV infection were previously described as invaginations of the 117 zippered ER that remain open to the cytosol [29] . In MERS-CoV-infected cells, the DMSs 118 were connected to the CM from which they seemed to derive ( Fig 1E) . Clear openings to the 119 cytosol could not be detected for the large majority (~80%, n=54) of the fully reconstructed 120 DMSs, which suggests that the original invagination may eventually transform into a sealed 121 compartment. This type of apparently closed DMSs were also present, though in a lower 122 proportion (~50%, n=39), in IBV-infected cell samples processed in an identical manner (S1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005298 doi: bioRxiv preprint (right) of a representative area containing the different types of MERS-CoV-induced membrane 130 modifications: DMSs (orange), convoluted membranes (CM, blue) and DMVs (yellow and lilac, outer 131 and inner membranes). The model also highlights ER membranes (green) and a vesicle (silver) 132\n\ncontaining new virions (pink). (See also S1 Video).

No clear openings connecting the interior of the DMVs and the cytosol could 157 be detected. All three types of MERS-CoV-induced membrane modifications appeared to be 158 interconnected, either directly or indirectly through the ER. While DMSs were connected to 159 CM, and CM to ER, ER membranes were often continuous with DMVs (Fig 1F, arrowheads) . 160 Therefore, like other CoVs, MERS-CoV infection appears to induce a network of largely 161 interconnected modified ER membranes that, as a whole, can be considered the CoV RO. Quantification of the autoradiography signal per subcellular structure (see also S1 Table) . Labelling 214 densities and relative labelling indexes (RLI) in different subcellular regions of (C) Vero E6 cells 215 infected with SARS-CoV (MOI 10) or (D) Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (MOI 5). 216\n\nRadioactively-labelled uridine was provided for the indicated periods of time immediately before 217 fixation at 7 hpi and 12 hpi, respectively. Control mock-infected cells are excluded from the RLI 218 plots, as RLI comparisons between conditions require the same number of classes (subcellular 219 regions) and these cells lack ROs and virions.

This 233 type of analysis was used to compare CoV-and mock-infected cells labelled for different 234 periods of time. To this end, we analysed the autoradiography signal present in hundreds of 235 regions that were randomly picked from large EM mosaic images [38] and calculated 236 labelling densities and relative labelling indexes (RLI) per compartment [39] (see Materials   237 and Methods, S1 Table) . The results for SARS-CoV did not show association of vRNA 238 synthesis with any subcellular structure other than ROs ( Fig 3C) .

Scale bars, (A) 5 \u00b5m, (B) 500 nm. 284 285 Next, we specifically investigated the possible involvement in vRNA synthesis of CM and/or 286 DMSs, which always were present in membrane-modification clusters that also contained 287 DMVs. A close inspection of CM showed that these structures were mainly devoid of signal 288 and that the occasional silver grains present primarily appeared in the periphery of CM, 289 therefore likely stemming from surrounding labelled DMVs (Fig 5A and B) . budding vesicles (Fig 6A-C) .The M and S proteins also localized to the Golgi complex, 348 aligning with previous observations for other CoVs [20, 44, 48, 49] . The MERS-CoV N 349 protein was found in regions with CM and DMSs, though the distribution of signal was 350 homogenous and DMSs were not particularly densely labelled (Fig 6D) .

Similarly, 358 nsp3 mapped to the CM induced in MERS-CoV infection, but also to the DMSs to a 359 comparable extent (Fig 6G) . Our attempts to combine dsRNA antibody labelling with thawed 360 cryo-sections were unsuccessful, which made us resort to HPF-FS samples. In these, 361 however, while DMVs were easily detected, the morphology of CM and DMSs was less 362 clearly defined. Nevertheless, dsRNA signal was clearly associated with DMVs, while the 363 dark membranous regions between DMVs that we interpreted as CM and DMSs clusters 364 appeared devoid of signal (Fig 6H and 6I ). 365 In summary, for the antibodies tested (recognizing N, M, S, nsp3, and dsRNA), the labelling 366 pattern in MERS-CoV-induced DMSs closely resembled that of the CM, from which they 367 seem to derive. The absence of labelling for key proteins in virus assembly, like the M and S 368 proteins, strongly suggest that DMSs do not represent (spurious) virus assembly events. [15, 20, 21, 29, 30, 47] , the unifying model that emerges from our study is that thus be a by-product of viral protein overexpression. Although DMSs seem to be derived 408 from CM, it is harder to imagine that these highly-regular structures would also lack a 409 specific function. However, their possible role remains elusive. The idea that DMSs could be 410 DMV precursors seems unlikely, considering that no intermediate structures between the two 411 were found, and that DMV formation precedes the appearance of CM, from which DMSs 412 seem to originate. A suggestive possibility was that DMSs represented non-productive virus 413 assembly events, but the lack of DMS labelling for key structural proteins seems to rule out 414 this option. In fact, no differences were apparent in the labelling patterns of CM Our results add to studies that, in the last years and after much speculation, have started to 419 provide experimental evidence that the DMVs induced by +RNA viruses are active sites of 420 vRNA synthesis [11, [58] [59] [60] . However, it is not clear that DMVs always play the primary role 421 in virus replication that we demonstrate here for CoV.

The most 444 appealing scenario is that in which vRNA synthesis only takes place inside the DMVs. This 445 would provide the compartmentalization of vRNA synthesis that may be most beneficial for 446 viral replication, although it would require the existence of a yet unidentified import/export 447 mechanism.

For each 609 CoV, different conditions (infected and mock-infected cells, plus different labelling times) 610 were compared using only samples developed after the same period of time. The analysis of 611 the signal in different subcellular regions was carried out using home-built software. Areas of 612 4 \u00b5m 2 were randomly selected from the mosaic EM maps and the autoradiography grains 613 present in those areas were manually assigned to the underlying cellular structures. The 614 abundance of the different types of subcellular structures was estimated through virtual points 615 in a 5\u00d75 lattice superimposed to each selected area, which were also assigned to the different 616 subcellular classes. Regularly along the process, the annotated data per condition was split 617 into two random groups and the Kendall and Spearman coefficients, which measure the 618 concordance between two data sets [73], were calculated. New random regions were added 619 until the average Kendall and Spearman coefficients resulting from 10 random splits were 620 higher than 0.8 and 0.9, respectively (maximum value, 1).

Tritiated uridine, for example, can be used to locate active RNA synthesis 5 [3] [4] [5] , as shown also in this study. A clear advantage over the use of alternatives for metabolic 6 labelling of newly-synthesized RNA (e.g. Br-uridine, Br-UTP, 5-ethynil uridine) is that the 7 radioactive precursor is chemically identical to the natural substrate. 8 After labelling, the samples are immediately fixed and processed for EM. The location of the 9 radioactive marker can then be made apparent by applying a highly-sensitive photographic 10 emulsion (a nuclear emulsion) on top of the cell sections and exposing it for several weeks to 11 months. The beta particles that are emitted as a result of tritium disintegrations generate 12 electrons that get trapped in the silver halide emulsion and create a \"latent image\". When the 13 emulsion is developed, these negative charges promote the reduction to metallic silver, 14 generating electron-dense grains that are visible by EM. In principle, given enough time to 15 accumulate enough radioactive disintegrations, even low levels of the radioactive marker 16 could be detected. In practice, other factors (e.g. background radiation, emulsion aging) set 17 some limits to autoradiography, which is nonetheless a very sensitive technique. 18 The resolution of EM autoradiography is limited by the fact that radioactive disintegrations 19 generate beta particles that are emitted in random directions. Importantly, the probability of 20 giving rise to signal degreases with the distance from the radioactive source; however, some 21 beta particles may travel up to a few hundred nanometers before striking the photographic 22 emulsion [2] . Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the silver grains may not directly 23 overlay the structure containing the radioactive source. Quantitative analyses of the signal 24 .
