The data were 33 collected over the course of several weeks up to February 10, 2020 and overlap with a period 34 of intensifying public health and social distancing measures. Phylodynamic analysis allows us to 35 evaluate epidemiological trends after seeding events which took place in mid to late January, 2020. 36 The objective of our analysis is to evaluate epidemiological trends based on national surveillance 37 and response efforts by Weifang Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This analysis provides an 38 estimate of the initial rate of spread and reproduction number in Weifang City. In contrast to the 39 early spread of COVID19 in Hubei Province of China, most community transmissions within Weifang 40 took place after public health interventions and social distancing measures were put in place. We 41 therefore hypothesize that genetic data should reflect a lower growth rate and reproduction number 42 than was observed in Wuhan. A secondary aim is to estimate the total numbers infected and to 43 evaluate the possibility that there is a large unmeasured burden of infection due to imperfect case 44 ascertainment and a large proportion of infections with mild or asymptomatic illness. 45 To analyze the Weifang sequences, we have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods 46 which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence 47 data from Wuhan and exported international cases (Volz et al., 2020) . This analysis has several 48 constraints and requirements: 49 50 Importation of lineages from Wuhan. The outbreak in Weifang was seeded by multiple lineages 51 imported at various times from the rest of China. We use a phylodynamic model that accounts for 52 location of sampling. Migration is modeled as a bi-directional process with rates proportional to 53 epidemic size in Weifang. The larger international reservoir of COVID19 cases serves as a source of 54 new infections and is assumed to be growing exponentially over this period of time. 55 Nonlinear epidemiological dynamics in Weifang. The maximum number of daily confirmed COVID19 56 cases occurred on February 5, but it is unknown when the maximum prevalence of infection oc-57 curred. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model (Keeling and Rohani, 2011) 58 for epidemic dynamics in Weifang. The model accounts for a realistic distribution of generation 59 times and can potentially capture a nonlinear decrease in cases following epidemic peak. 60 Variance in transmission rates (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) .To estimate total numbers infected, the 61 phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly 62 influence genetic diversity. Foremost among these is the variance in offspring distribution (number 63 of transmissions per primary case). We draw on previous evidence based on the previous SARS 64 epidemic which indicates that the offspring distribution is highly over-dispersed. High variance of 65 transmission rates will reduce genetic diversity of a sample and failure to account for this factor 66 will lead to highly biased estimates of epidemic size (Li et al., 2017) . Recent analyses of sequence 67 data drawn primarily from Wuhan has found that high over-dispersion was required for estimated 68 cases to be consistent with the epidemiological record (Volz et al., 2020) . Models assuming low 69 variance in transmission rates between people would generate estimates of cases that are lower .

In this study, we elaborate the SEIR model to 73 include a compartment( ) with higher transmission rates. The variance of the implied offspring 74 distribution is calibrated to give similar overdispersion from the SARS epidemic.\n\nDespite an initial rapid increase in confirmed cases in Weifang in late January and early February, the 77 number of confirmed cases by Weifang CDC show that outbreak peaked quite early and maximum 78 number of cases ocurred on February 5. Phylodynamic analysis supports the interpretation that 79 control efforts reduced epidemic growth rates and contributed to eventual control. Figure 1A 80 illustrates the phylodynamic model which was co-estimated with the phylogeny which provides 81 estimates of epidemiological parameters summarized in Table 1 . Figure We do not have sufficient data to detect a large decrease in epidemic growth rates as the 93 epidemic progressed. We estimate 0 = 2.6 (95% HPD:1.5-5). The growth rate in estimated 94 infections remained positive but decreased substantially over the sampling period. These estimates 95 correspond to growth during a period when Weifang was implementing a variety of public health 96 interventions and contact tracing to limit epidemic spread. These interventions included public 97 3 of 9\n\n.
