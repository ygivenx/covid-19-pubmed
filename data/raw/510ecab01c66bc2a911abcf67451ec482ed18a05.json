As Chongqing is reported to be one of the major cities imported passengers from Wuhan in China from December 16, 2019 9 . Given the regional disparity of COVID-19, we aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing municipality, and compare the differences between non-severe and severe patients, which may unravel risk factors associated with 28-day mortality and further suggest a specific therapeutic intervention for patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality, China.\n\nA retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study on the clinical characteristics of All rights reserved.

Bacterial, fungal, and pathogenic microorganism test in respiratory and blood samples was routinely performed. Cytokines and lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood were measured by fluorescence-labeled flow cytometry (Beckman, Cell Lab Quanta SC)\n\nThe epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment and outcomes data from confirmed COVID-19 patients' medical and nursing records were obtained and analyzed. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptoms were noticed.

In our study, 103(38.6%) patients had been discharged and 4(1.5%) patients had died, and all other patients were in hospital. The For severe patients, the duration from admission to developing ARDS is only 3 days (IQR, 2.0-5.0), and the 28-mortality of severe patients was 8.0% (4/50), with much higher when complications occurred (14.8%, [4/27] ). Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4% (4/9). Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases will be considerably essential to reduce complications and mortality.\n\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 firstly occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.\n\nThe disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to worldwide 1 . On January 30, the World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency due to this rapid infection spreads. However, as one of the major cities imported passengers from Wuhan in China 9 , the regional characteristics of COVID-19\n\nin Chongqing municipality were not reported so far. Our presents study, to our knowledge, firstly portrayed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory characteristics, treatment regimens and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Chongqing municipality, China. And we further compared the numerous differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than the 28-day mortality of mainland China including Hubei province (2.51%\n\n[1770/70548]), reported by national official statistics as for February 16th, 2020 All rights reserved.

Two more researches including COVID-19 cases based on the big data from the whole country delineated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in nationwide 8, 13 . The clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients was recently reported 14 .\n\nIn our study, the majority critically severe patients are older and male, consistent with gender difference in previous researches 6, 13, 14 Compared with patients who had a definite direct exposure to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the epidemics in Chongqing has transmitted to the coexistence of imported cases and local sporadic or clustered cases. As the strong epidemic control in Hubei was implemented, clustered cases or family aggregation cases gradually compose the majority of confirmed cases in Chongqing. Although small part of patients in Chongqing had coexisting chronic disease, relatively less frequent than that of patients in Wuhan 6 , severe patients were more likely to suffer from underlying comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases), All rights reserved.

Among the common comorbidities, we found a significant portion of patients in Chongqing suffered from overweight and obesity, which is more common in severe patients.\n\nObesity-induced chronic inflammation status is well documented to contribute to the progress of multiple diseases 18 . Large epidemiological studies have shown that BMI was associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and length of hospital stay, which has already been used in lung injury prediction score (LIPS) to help physicians identify at-risk patients for developing ALI 19 . Therefore, elderly male patients with a history of smoke and underlying comorbidities are at increased risk of becoming critically severe if they are suffered from COVID-19 infection, which deserves more attention and intensive care treatment. Therefore, the atypical patients and asymptomatic carriers deserves more attention to avoid delayed or missed diagnosis. Moreover, rales and wheezes are scarcely noted when lung auscultation was performed, due to the lack of sputum or mucus, especially for non-severe patients. Further comparison between the severe and non-severe patients found that severe patients are more likely to suffer from dyspnea and confusion symptoms on disease onset, which may suggest severe complications such All rights reserved.

The median durations from symptoms onset to laboratory diagnosis and hospital admission were 4 days and 7 days, with obvious longer time for severe cases, which may lead to the poor outcome due to delayed medical interventions. In general, COVID-19 in severe cases progresses rapidly to lethal complications (ARDS, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, refractory metabolic acidosis and so on), even leading to death. Our study demonstrates that the median interval from symptoms onset to ARDS of severe cases was much shorter than that of non-severe cases. It has been demonstrated that poor populations always endured a disproportionate burden of disease and death from infectious diseases like influenzas 21 .\n\nA great number of death cases in our study were poorly-educated elders with chronic comorbidities, their illness deteriorated rapidly to severe ARDS within several days, presented as suddenly occurred severe hypoxaemia, malignant arrhythmia, cardiac and respiratory arrest, unfortunately death, despite of timely rescue including invasive ventilation and other advanced medical interventions. Therefore, early diagnosis and management of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially poorly-educated elderly male with chronic comorbidities, should be vigorously advocated.\n\nRegarding to laboratory tests, consistent with most reports, peripheral lymphocytopenia is the most crucial and common feature for COVID-19 infection. In our study, most patients suffered from varying degrees of lymphocytopenia, especially for critically severe patients. Lymphocytopenia is also a prominent feature for patients author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397 doi: medRxiv preprint proinflammatory Th17 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, partially accounts for the severe immune injury in death patient 26 . The phenomenon that T cell counts reduced and functionally exhausted has been reported in previous study, which indicates high risk for further deterioration of COVID-19 27 . In our study, a progressive decline of lymphocytes and CD4 positive T cells was observed during the deterioration of illness. presented as elevated levels of infectious parameters, but other abnormalities were less common. While, severe patients obviously manifested more prominent abnormalities, suggesting multiple organ dysfunction and poor outcomes. Additionally, severe cases suffered from lower albumin and hemoglobin, suggesting the importance of nutrition supportive treatments. As for radiologic presentations, more attention should be paid to the cases without obvious radiological abnormalities on admission, so as to avoid the miss or delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial important to take symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings into account to make an integrated and thorough judgment. The MuLBSTA score, an efficient early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia 30 , needs further validation in the future practice.\n\nAll rights reserved.

As most of patients in Chongqing were non-severe, antiviral therapy was commonly adopted among these patients. Empirical antibiotic therapy was merely administered to few patients with bacterial infection evidence, and ordinary oxygen therapy was supplied only if hyoxemia occurred.

Therefore, it is still too early to judge the efficiency of these therapy, much more studies are still needed In summary, our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients in Chongqing municipality, China. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing municipality is 1.5%, approximately consistent with the official fatality rate 0.91%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. Early isolation, early diagnosis, early management, combined with the strong epidemic control in Hubei and the effective prevention of local cluster outside Hubei might collectively contribute to the marked reduced 28 day-mortality in Chongqing municipality.\n\nHowever, for severe patients, the 28-mortality was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Thus, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.\n\nMahallawi WH, Khabour OF, Zhang Q, Makhdoum HM, Suliman BA. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397 doi: medRxiv preprint Fig.1 Chest computed tomography of a 56 years old female patient of non-sever COVID-19 in Chongqing on admission.
