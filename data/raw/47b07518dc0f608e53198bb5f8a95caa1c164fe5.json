A way of accelerating triage process and prioritizing CT examination and PCR tests for suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients would be to identify a useful practical marker. The official guidelines (the Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China for COVID-19, 5 th edition; 2 and the WHO interim guideline 3 ) currently recommend two laboratory parameters, \"normal/ decreased number of leukocytes\" or \"decreased number of lymphocytes\", as one of the criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Here, our analysis suggests eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) as a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection than recommended \"leukocyte counts\" and \"lymphopenia\".\n\nMethods: Data of this retrospective case-negative control study were collected from 105 patients first visiting the Fever Clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 3 to Feb 7, 2020.\n\nNasopharyngeal swab specimens of all patients were subject to real time RT-PCR tests through amplifying ORF1ab gene and N gene of SARS-CoV-2 (BioGerm, Shanghai, China). Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded and carefully checked. All statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

The differences in clinical and laboratory findings between the two cohorts were univariately and multivariately analyzed (Table1). No significant differences were found in gender. SP patients (average age 57) was older than SN patients (average age 51, p=0.015). SN patients had a higher rate of other respiratory pathogens infection (34% vs 9.6%, p=0.005). All the patients had pneumonia-like clinical symptoms including fever and respiratory symptoms, whose distribution was similar in the two cohorts.\n\nIn laboratory findings, the rates of \"normal or decreased number of leukocytes\" and \"lymphopenia\" that were used for defining suspected patients by the current guidelines, were not different between these two cohorts. Intriguingly, eosinopenia (<0.02 \u00d710 9 / L) was observed in the majority of SP patients (78.8 %), in stark contrast to 35.8 % in SN patients (p \uff1c0.001). Consistently, the average eosinophil counts across SP patients (0.02 \u00d710 9 / L) was significantly lower than that of SN patients (0.05 \u00d710 9 / L, p=0.004).\n\nThe performance of eosinopenia as a predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection was then determined in the presence of symptoms ( Table 2 ). The inclusion of leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) had no significant diagnostic value. Notably, the inclusion of eosinopenia remarkably improved the sensitivity and specificity to 78.8% and 64.2%, respectively, much higher than the inclusion of lymphopenia (48.1% and 52.8%). Further, the combination of other blood parameters (leukocytes and/ or lymphopenia) with eosinopenia increased selectivity but reduced sensitivity.\n\nDiscussion: Eosinopenia can be observed in typhoid fever or as a response to glucocorticoid.\n\nIn previous clinical reports on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and current SAR-CoV-2, 4-6 changes in eosinophils in peripheral blood were usually omitted. Our study showed that eosinopenia appeared in the majority of SP patients. The mechanisms underlying such eosinopenia were currently unclear and warrant further study.\n\nSince the data was collected at patients' first medical visit, eosinopenia was presumed to be an early event in patients' clinical course, possibly prior to emergence of characteristic radiological findings. Combined with fever and respiratory symptoms, eosinopenia as a parameter in routine blood tests might be capable of facilitating rapid identification of highlysuspected cases from mixed patients at triage in fever clinics. These quickly-identified suspected patients would be recommended to (1) receive the priority for radio-diagnosis and laboratory-definitive diagnosis, (2) be isolated in designated wards without any delay to avoid potential virus spreading, (3) and receive empirical antiviral treatment (as of now no consensus All rights reserved.

The additional inclusion of eosinopenia may further refine the laboratory diagnostic criteria recommended by the current guidelines. Numbers are absolute cell counts (10 9 / L).
