{"title": "Comparing the economic effects of climate change and zooanthroponosis in Korea: Prerequisites for the creative economy? \u2606", "body": "Societies in the 21st century require more proactive management of risks in many areas due to the complexities people have built into socioeconomic systems, ranging from science and technology, economic, and finance to education, entertainment, and tourism infrastructure. These systems thrive on stability, which can easily be challenged by unexpected risks (Commission, 2008; Fraser et al., 2004) . Thus, preparing for unexpected risks is a significant component of sustainable growth management. We have focused more on traditional factors of production even when we consider creative economy. Theoretical and practical debate, such as the introduction of more robotics can be an agenda from the supply side. Yet, in thinking of creative economy, just considering supply and demand will not be sufficient. Our global economy as a whole can be endangered with an unexpected outbreak of a symptom, whether it could come from naturally or unnaturally. Actualizing the creative economy depends on risk management at social and global levels, and especially depends on the most serious upcoming risks this research selected, which we tend to under invest due to our socio-economic decision making system. This paper, with the backdrop, compares economic risks that may arise from climate change-based sea level increases (Stern, 2007b) and zooanthroponosis by conducting a cost-benefit analysis using data on the Korean economy (Parker, 2013b) . By comparing the two risks, this study suggests the relative magnitude of preparation that societies may choose to undertake. Second, this study shows how a policy measure could be cost effective by proposing the hypothetical alternative of creating research institutions for both the climate change and zooanthroponosis cases. Specifically, a cost-benefit analysis was presented to examine whether these institutions can be effective against the risks related to climate change and disease.\n\nconcern since the late 20th century owing to the increase in air and surface traffic (Newcomb, 2004a ; Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2009). In addition to the independent economic analysis conducted and presented in this study, the literature on zooanthroponosis is presented and utilized to check the robustness of the study's calculations.\n\nIn a study, the West Nile Virus, which is carried through mosquitos and was once foreign to the US environment, was found to be epidemic enough to be traced. In the past 15 years in the US, about 17,367 medical cases have been reported, of which 1654 lives were lost (Barrett, 2014) . Delving further into the cases, in 2003, in 17 hospitals in four counties in the state of Colorado, 80 of 221 hospitalized patients were investigated. Among them, 38 patients participated in a longitudinal study for 5 years. From this patient group, a median medical cost of US$22,628 was found. The same research has estimated that during 1999-2012, the West Nile Virus led to a cost of US$778 million, which can be converted to an annual figure of US$56 million (Bode et al., 2006) .\n\nApplying the result to the national level in the US was found to be meaningful, considering that the national average medical cost per patient because of the virus was US$28,151 in 1997. Especially, the case from Colorado took a conservative approach in calculating the average medical costs by including diagnosed patients but not non-hospitalized ones. Further, the Colorado medical costs did not include sanitation costs or diagnosis-related costs (Newcomb, 2004b) .\n\nTo compare and apply this estimation to the Korean context, this study tried an independent calculation and reached the following estimation. While the difference between the actual GDP size between the US and Korea is more than 10 times, an individual level consumption or PPP level comparison roughly gives about a ratio of 1:2 between the two countries. Based on this assumption, if cases of the West Nile Virus should arise, individual level medical costs could be between US$14,000 and 15,000; and if about 0.027% of the total population of 48 million people in South Korea contracts the virus, the estimated total medical costs would be approximately KRW195 billion. The calculation is based on 1300 patients, of which 500 patients were from the Seoul and Gyung gi Province, which takes about half of the population, and the other 800 patients from 8 major cities generating 100 patients each. This figure is compared in terms of absolute size with the estimation from this study in the following section.\n\nAccording to the USGS and its Wild Life Health Center, the economic impact from SARS could be between US$50 and 100 billion (Newcomb, 2004b) . In other words, the size of the impact could be about 2% of the national GDP of the US. Considering this proportionally in the Korean case, an impact of US$5-10 billion can be anticipated.\n\nFor comparison purposes, as shown in Fig. 1 , SARS in Asian countries was estimated to have an economic impact of US$30-50 billion during [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] . It is estimated that this figure will still be valid after considering inflation factors.\n\nAccording to the Asian Development Bank's estimation, if the incidence of zooanthroponosis is mild, it will cause about a 2.6% decrease in GDP in Asian countries (Asia Development . If the incidence of zooanthroponosis is significant, regional Asian GDP will drop by a maximum of 6.8%. While the USGS has estimated losses of approximately US$50-100 billion for SARS, other estimations have predicted about a 50 billion worldwide loss of economic value (Fineberg and Wilson, 2010; Wilson, 2010b) .\n\nAvian Flu is another zooanthroponosis case. AI was estimated to have caused a US$150-200 billion loss in the US, or a 3% loss in the GDP of the originating country (Smith, 2005; Nelson Rodrigo da Silva Martins, 2012) .\n\nThe same study estimated a 0.5% loss in GDP worldwide. Another study showed a 2% GDP loss in East Asia from AI (Nelson Rodrigo da Silva Martins, 2012) . For AI, the World Bank has estimated a 0.6%-2% loss in GDP and loss of US$800 billion worldwide Wilson, 2010a) .\n\nScholars and organizations have been keenly monitoring the rise in sea level due to climate change. Especially, the United Nation's Fifth IPCC (Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change) report has mainly focused on the issue of sea level rise with scientific evidence gathered through different studies in many countries (Stocker et al., 2013) . According to the report, between 1901 and 2010 (about 110 years), the sea level has risen by 19 cm. Moreover, since 1993, the average annual rise in sea level was estimated to be 3.2 mm. Based on the evidence and trend, toward the end of the 21st century, the sea level is expected to rise by 28-98 cm, based on different scenarios (Cayan et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2000) .\n\nKorea is not an exception from this global trend. According to research conducted in Korea, in recent years, the sea level has risen by 2.37 mm annually in Korea and by 5.14 mm annually near Jeju island, which has been higher than the global average (Kim and Cho, 2013) . Even more concerning is the fact that another study has estimated that the sea level could go up to a maximum of 1.36 m.\n\nThe sea level rise has repercussions on different dimensions. Sea level rise will reduce wet land, but the impact does not end there (Perrette et al., 2013; Milly et al., 2003) . According to a scenario-based forecast for Korea, in 2100, the loss of residential areas would lead to a loss of approximately US$29.5 billion and affect about 3% of the total population. In the same scenario, 6.2% and 5.8% of total roads and railroads, respectively, could be affected and lost. Major ports will lose their functions in the sense that they will lose or rebuild their \"breakwater.\" As much as 84% of reclaimed land near the shore will be affected. With all the damage and losses, it was tentatively estimated that monetary costs could be up to US$286 billion (Kim and Cho, 2013) .\n\nWith the future increase in risks, in addition to international joint research and operations on the climate change-induced sea level rise, several countries have established special research institutions to cope with the problem in research areas. In the US, the University of Hawaii has opened the University Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC), and in the UK, the Perman Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) is the equivalent organization for the same purpose. Australia has established the National Tidal Center (NTC), and Japan, the Coastal Movement Data Center (CMDC), both of which are designed to cope with the risks associated with sea level rise. With these organizations taking their duty and with organizations and research groups working on the issue, several publications of these institutions warn of the danger of sea level rise, such as \"Coastal Sensitivity to Sea level Rise: Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region\" by the Climate Change Science Program (2009) and National Climate Assessment (2013) and the UK's \"Adapting to Climate Change\" (2013). In Australia, research initiatives such as \"Climate Change Risks to Australia's Coast: National Assessment\" (2009) can also be considered a valid effort in this field (Parker, 2013a; National Research Council, 2012; Katsman et al., 2011) .\n\nThis study adopted the Bank of Korea's statistical database for economic output by sector to estimate the economic impact of climate change and zooanthroponosis.\n\nTo fulfill the study objectives, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted on both climate change induced sea level rise and zooanthroponosis, which was proxied in this study as the SARS case, with an expected impact of a 0.15% loss in GDP (Adams et al., 1995) .\n\nAfter the two cost-benefit analyses were conducted, this research performed a hypothetical cost-benefit analysis of establishing research institutions for both cases to show the impact of both sea level rise and the disease on GDP so that rational and cost-efficient measures can be taken to prepare for the risks.\n\nThe findings in this research focused on whether the forecasts and trends introduced in the previous section could be found in the Korean data set. Of course, the validity of the forecasts previously given may be challenged by different standards. However, taking it as a reference point, this section tries to present similarities and differences between the earlier forecasts as well as the empirical data based on the Korean case.\n\n4.1. Cost-benefit analysis of zooanthroponosis: A case of SARS impacting 0.15% of GDP\n\nRelying on literature from a Canadian case which estimated a 0.15% loss on GDP from SARS, 2 this research tried to calculate, in a bottom up industry level, a cost benefit analysis in the case of Korea to show the feasibility of a 0.15% of GDP. Table 1 below contains time series data of individual industrial sectors and their output in Korea Won by quarter, from the fourth quarter in 2012 to the third quarter in 2013, based on recent data at the time of the analysis. In a typical cost-benefit analysis used for industries, the expected rate of profit can be calculated as follows.\n\nExpected rate of profit \u00bc impact from 0000 \u00c2 information usage increase rate \u00c2 decision rate 2 SARS refers to severe acute respiratory syndrome. This formula can be adapted to the context of this study as follows.\n\nImpact from a disease \u00bc expected impact from disease \u00c2 information usage increase rate \u00c2 decision rate By using the formula for the agricultural and fishery sector in Korea, the impact of SARS expressed as a loss in GDP is calculated as KRW29,540.3 billion \u00d7 0.15%, which is KRW 3 44.31 billion. To get the 0.15%, one should multiply impact of a disease = expected impact from the disease (0.1) \u00d7 information usage increase rate (0.1) \u00d7 decision rate (0.15) = 0.0015, or 0.15%. By performing this calculation for each sector, the loss in GDP for each sector can be attained, which adds up to the total loss in GDP from SARS, which was KRW194.982 billion (approx. US$194 million).\n\nIn the formula, the expected impact of the disease implies a hypothetical expectation of the disease. In the meteorological field, it has been established that severe damage from extreme weather conditions may lead to a loss in GDP by 10% or in the output of the sector by a maximum of 10% (WMO, 2007; Stern, 2007a) . Based on this logic, this analysis assigned a 10% a priori impact expectation for each sector. While this seems to be very significant, other factors to be multiplied in the formula will dramatically reduce the absolute size of the impact from SARS. The information usage rate, another element in the formula, denotes the possibility of given scientific knowledge of the impact of the disease (in this case 10%) on a specific sector, and seeks to determine the possibility that the sector will utilize the information. In this analysis, the agricultural and fishery sectors were given 10% for both expected impact on GDP and information usage increase rate as an exception. Together, the calculation of the impact is designed to be conservative. The last element of the decision rate denotes the possibility that each sector will actually use the information in decisionmaking, when knowing the expected impact and increased usage of information. The outcome from the formula is conservative in estimating the impact from SARS for two reasons. The first reason is that this is the lower bound estimate. Second, to produce a macroeconomic level estimation, it seems safer to be conservative, especially in the costbenefit analysis, by not exaggerating.\n\nTo derive a comparison number, this study utilized an upper bound estimate, which was 2% of GDP loss owing to SARS (Wong and Siu, 2008) . In this case, we tried a topdown approach by multiplying 2% directly. The \n\nAfter calculating the possible loss in GDP from zooanthroponosis, which in this case is SARS, this study attempted to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of a policy measure, that is, to establish a research institution to deal with the risk of the disease. The underlying logic is that establishing a research institution will not prevent the risk of the disease entirely, but with the calculation of the cost-benefit analysis, it was assumed that a certain portion of the risk could be reduced. For comparison purposes, the analysis for the climate changeinduced sea level rise case can also be adopted by establishing a research institution as a policy measure to have a one-to-one comparison of the risk itself and cost-benefit result from the two risks.\n\nFor the analysis, it was assumed that an organization that begins construction and development in 2014 will be operational as of 2016. Within this timeframe, the cost-benefit element was calculated up to year 2030. Going back to the earlier calculation of the loss in GDP, utilizing the Bank of Korea statistics, approximately KRW194.99 billion was estimated.\n\nThis figure was important because it is consistent with an independent research example showing that the lower bound estimate from SARS damage will be around 0.15% of GDP. The figure this study found was almost 0.15% of Korea's GDP in 2013, which validates both research cases.\n\nIt was assumed in this study that about one-third of the risk can be prevented by establishing an institution designed to perform research functions to reduce all the possible risks from the diseases.\n\nThus, it was calculated that annually about KRW64.9 billion (US$6.49 billion) worth of benefit would be generated, while after year 2022 the estimation would be increased to reflect potential benefits from the vaccine products this institute may For each cost and benefit section, the net present value was calculated by applying a discount rate of 5.5%, which is the official rate for government budgetary expenditure up to Spring 2014. Reflecting interest rate changes in the market, the government's discount rate has been adjusted; this was reflected as a 3% discount rate, which this study also used as shown in Table 5 . (See Table 4 .) Tables 6 and 7 show a cost-benefit ratio and a net present value of establishing a research institution from 2014 to 2030. In terms of the cost-benefit ratio, with the change in the discount rate, the ratio was slightly reduced, which shows the relatively stable nature of the flow of costs and benefits. In the 3% discount rate case, costs increased more sharply than the benefits in the 5.5% case.\n\nFor comparison purposes, this study performed a costbenefit analysis of the sea level rise affected by climate change. As shown in Table 8 , output data for different industrial sectors in Korea from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2012 was utilized. (See Tables 9 and 10.) Similar to the zooanthroponosis case, the base model for the cost-benefit calculation was adopted from atypical private sector cases, where expected rate of profit = impact from 0000 \u00d7 information usage increase rate \u00d7 decision rate. From this formula, this part applied an approach for the sea level case, which can be presented as impact form the sea level rise = expected impact from the sea level rise \u00d7 information usage increase rate \u00d7 decision rate. In this case, based on the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) and the US NOAA reports, industries and people were assumed to have approximately 10% of expected impact from the sea level rise. In fact, WMO has shown that research on meteorology can have an approximately 5-10 times benefit (WMO, 2003 (WMO, , 2007 World Bank, 2008) , compared to the costs; moreover, NOAA 4 has estimated that about 10% of GDP will be affected by climate change and related information (Fettweis et al., 2011; Stern, 2007a) .\n\nBased on this background, for each industrial sector, GDP loss can be calculated. From this calculation, a loss of KRW128.17 billion (or US$128 million) was estimated for all industries. To show the validity of this calculation, if one applies a 0.01% loss for the GDP in 2012, an amount of about KRW126.82 billion was attained. Thus, the top-down and bottom-up (sector-wise build up) approaches showed only minimal differences in calculating the loss of GDP. It is quite clear that the calculation was very conservative in estimating possible damage to the economy, since the formula itself was designed to reflect how industries will use the scientific information, and how in that process, a buffering effect was taking place. For example, in reflecting the information usage increase rate, agricultural and fishery sectors were given 10%, while other sectors were assigned 5%. Similarly, the decision rate, which shows whether industries actually make decisions based on calculated risks, for the agricultural and fishery sectors was 12%, while other sectors were given only 2%.\n\nWith the deliberate calculation, the approximate figure of KRW128.1 billion was deduced, and this could be considered the direct benefit of establishing a research institution aimed at preventing sea level rise risks. According to a report in Korea by KEI, if the sea level rises by 0.2 m, the maximum damage could be nearly US$7 billion (KRW7,568.5 billion). Considering the magnitude of the estimated damage, the calculation from this study could be regarded as the least conservative one (Marcelja, 2010; Kim and Cho, 2013) .\n\nBy applying the calculation above, we conducted a costbenefit analysis of establishing a research institution aimed at reducing sea level rise-related risks. As mentioned earlier, other major countries have established similar organizations, yet the size varies depending on national characteristics. Considering this factor, this study prepared a small organizational design to perform an organizational cost-benefit analysis. As the table shows, with a 10-year time horizon, costs can be itemized, and in year 1, total costs were estimated to be KRW11.64 billion (or US$11 million approximately). One peculiar element in the table is the benefit element from \"direct research.\" This element was to highlight a case in which a small institute outsources most of its research projects. In this case, it was argued that this outsourcing is minimized, and therefore, the amount that was to be outsourced was added as a benefit element in the lower cells of the table.\n\nWith the adding, for example, in year 1, the total benefit was estimated to be KRW13.117 billion, while in the same year, the total cost was KRW11.64 billion. The total benefit was added for the inflationary factor for the upcoming years by multiplying the 3% annual increase. With these settings, the cost-benefit ratio of establishing a special institute aimed at sea level rise risks was between 11.26 and 11.27, which shows that about 11 times, the benefits can be attained through the establishment of an organization. This is consistent with what WMO has claimed as the benefit size from weather-related research for the economy (Adams et al., 1995) . WMO claims that about 10 times the benefits will be generated with research (WMO, 2003 (WMO, , 2007 . In this case, slightly higher numbers are suggested as a policy measure for establishing an institute (Frei, 2009 ).\n\nIf policy alternatives for making the research institution specialized for zooanthroponosis, it is possible to sketch out several points. First, it is crucial to have a benchmarking case, if necessary. In this case, the US institutions including the National Wildlife Health Center can be a candidate for benchmarking. Second, in terms of facilities, it is crucial that the new institution be equipped with the BL 3 level equipment and facilities, which is the highest level required for biological research. Third, taking the assumption that around 150 research related people will be hired, research areas can be expanded into basic research, vaccine related research as well as prevention type surveillance for wild life diseases.\n\n6.1. Implications for the creative economy: implications for vaccine research and industry against the risk and climate change adaptation What makes this research applicable for the creative economy comes from the notion that managing risks will determine whether we can make our economy prosper or not. Traditionally, we have underestimated the importance of prevention from the risks this paper has raised. We have focused more on traditional factors of production even when we consider creative economy. Theoretical and practical debate, such as the introduction of more robotics can be an agenda from the supply side. Yet, in thinking of creative economy, just considering supply and demand will not be sufficient. Our global economy as a whole can be endangered with an unexpected outbreak of a symptom, whether it could come from naturally or unnaturally.\n\nFirst, maintaining the risk management, in some sense, can be at least equally important as improving factors of production in creative ways. Against the understanding, this research tried to show the relative magnitude of the zooanthroponosis in conventional economic numbers. Second, this research tried to stereotype the risks that making creative economy may be faced. This study focused on both zooanthroponosis and climate changed based sea level change. Both risks can endanger our civilization from the bottom. Especially, the reason why this study focused on the zooanthroponosis case with a special attention to establishing a research center specialized for the type diseases was its implication for the creative economy in a narrow sense. While people can easily be drawn by the sheer numbers of potential danger from such diseases, it is not easy to get the public budget for preventing the risks. Making a research center like this will need public money, which is tax money. This will require a series of thorough feasibility tests. Ironically, however, to pass the test, cost benefit analysis results should not be big enough. An implication from the dynamic is that as a society as a whole, we may underinvest in vaccine research and production until when we finally acknowledge the risks. Third, the same story can be told for the climate change. Society has traditionally underestimated the potential danger from the risk. After the Stern report of the U.K., people hailed the implications from the report until people have turned away from them, due to slowly changing nature of the phenomenon. After the Stern report, research communities have, in some sense, over reacted by reproducing the implications, which have undermined the original intention and warning from the phenomenon. This chain reaction has eventually may result in underinvestment at the societal level as well as global level.\n\nIn sum, actualizing the creative economy depends on risk management at social and global level, and the most serious upcoming risks will be the zooanthroponosis and climate change, which we tend to under invest due to our socioeconomic decision making system. This is what this research can speak up in preparing the upcoming creative economy.\n\nThis study has presented a cost-benefit analysis of two risks that apparently do not seem closely related. One common perspective this study provided is that both of them are risks to the socioeconomic aspect of today's civilization. The results of applying cost-benefit analysis to both cases show an interesting comparison.\n\nFirst, while both cost-benefit analyses in this study were conducted in a conservative manner, most of the earlier research examples dealing with diseases have produced more serious economic figures than climate change related research cases. A consequence was that disease-related research easily attracted attention from society, probably because with the existing record of zooanthroponosis cases. People already have enough awareness of the problem, while climate change is at a research stage and its impact or damage is something to be materialized in the future.\n\nSecond, because of the first reason, even though the numbers of disease cases handled are more conservative, the total costs were still much greater than in the climate change case.\n\nThird, because of the existence of real-world data on damage from zooanthroponosis in the past 20 years, in the cost-benefit analysis, only a small fraction of the damage was used to make it more realistic. In comparison, climate changerelated circles were trying to better describe the potential magnitude of future risks.
