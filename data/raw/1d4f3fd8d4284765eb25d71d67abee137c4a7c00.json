{"title": "Emerging infectious disease: trends in the literature on SARS and H7N9 influenza", "body": "Since 19 February 2013, when the first patient was reported to have been infected with the novel H7N9 influenza virus from an avian source, 571 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in China, of which 212 individuals died by 23 February 2015 (WHO 2015) . Also in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged late in 2002, first in Guangdong Province, subsequently spreading across China and worldwide to 29 countries. Probable SARS cases reached 8096, of which 774 individuals died (WHO 2003) .\n\nSARS and H7N9 influenza are emerging infectious diseases sharing some common features. First, they all began in China; the first SARS patient was identified in Guangdong Province in 2002, and human H7N9 influenza infection first emerged in Shanghai in 2013. Second, they have a relatively high mortality rate, approximately 9.6 % for SARS (WHO 2003) and approximately 37.1 % for human H7N9 influenza infections (WHO 2015) . Third, they all caused worldwide alarm. Meanwhile they also have some differences, one being that SARS spread rapidly outside China and became epidemic in some other countries such as Canada, Singapore and Vietnam, although H7N9 influenza has been mainly confined to China. Another difference is that, unlike H7N9 influenza, SARS is capable of effective person-to-person transmission, although some research shows that the possibility of H7N9 influenza transmission via this route exists (Rudge and Coker 2013) .\n\nJournal articles are useful for sharing research results, promoting control and prevention of emerging infectious diseases, and speeding up drug and vaccine development. The quantity and quality of journal articles can reflect the level of research in some countries and institutes as well as the degree of concern. China is a developing country, with the world's highest population, and like other countries it faces the threat of emerging infectious disease. China is now improving its capability to deal speedily with emerging infectious disease. To some degree, literature analysis can reflect this improvement.\n\nA literature search of Science Citation Index Expanded database (http://apps.isiknowledge. com) was conducted on July, 2015. The search formula for SARS was: Title = (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' OR ''SARS''), Publication Type = Article; the search formula for H7N9 influenza was: Title = ''H7N9'', Publication Type = Article. The affiliation countries and institutes of the author were based on the Reprint Address. Some results were removed that were not about the search target. Literature analysis included article literature distribution by year, country,institute, journal and literature citations. We particularly analyzed article literature in the journals The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature and Science, which have higher impact factors. For the purposes of analysis, Hong Kong and Taiwan of People's Republic of China were treated separately from mainland China.\n\nWe analyzed changes in published SARS literature by year. SARS article literature that have country information about the reprint author reached a peak of 591 in 2004 and decreased in the following years. Articles from Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Stateds also increased in 2004 compared with 2003, and decreased in the following years. However, in mainland China the peak did not occur until 2005 (Fig. 1 ).\n\nWe retrieved 2628 article literature about SARS that identified the country of the reprint author. Country and region distribution were mainland China (21 %), the United States (20 %), Hong Kong (16 %), Taiwan (10 %), Canada (7 %), Singapore (6 %) and so on Of the 385 article literature about H7N9 influenza that have country information about the reprint author, most were from Mainland China (57 %), followed by the United States (18 %), Hong Kong (6 %), Japan (3 %), Taiwan (2 %) and so on (Fig. 4) .\n\nOf the 47 article literature about SARS that were published in the leading scientific journals The Lancet, NEJM, Nature and Science and that have country information about the reprint author, most came from Hong Kong (16), the United States (11), Canada (5) and so on (Table 1) .\n\nOf the 20 article literature about H7N9 influenza that were published in these journals and that have country information about the reprint author, most were from mainland China (12), followed by Hong Kong (3), United States (2) and so on ( Table 2) .\n\nWe total retrieved 76,632 citations of SARS articles. Country and region distribution were the United States (28 %), Hong Kong (19 %), Mainland China (14 %), Canada (9 %), and so on (Fig. 5) .\n\nWe retrieved 4633 citations of H7N9 articles. Country and region distribution were mainland China (65 %),the United States (13 %), Hong Kong (7 %), Japan(6 %), and so on (Fig. 6) . Mainland China had 12 article literature about H7N9 influenza in The Lancet, NEJM, Nature and Science, more than half of the total. The Chinese articles mainly originated from seven institutes, including China CDC (Nature 1, NEJM 2), Chinese Acad Agr Sci (Science 1), Chinese Acad Sci (Lancet 1, Science 1), Fudan Univ (Lancet 1), Shantou Univ (Nature 1, Science 1), Zhejiang Univ (Lancet 1, NEJM 1), Shenzhen Third Peoples Hosp (Nature 1). The institutes of other countries and regions that had H7N9 influenza literature in those journal include Univ Hong Kong (Lancet 3) and so on.\n\nEmerging infectious disease poses an enormous threat to humankind. It can be associated with tragic consequences due to lack of immunity or inexperience in public health response, and the lack of effective medical treatment. One terrifying example is the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which killed 50 million people (Taubenberger and Morens 2006) . There have been many emerging infectious diseases beside SARS and avian influenza, such as E. coli O157:H7, Nipah virus, Enterovirus 71, Hendra virus (Morens et al. 2004) . Also including Ebola virus disease and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic in year 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, because of the possibility of gene reassortment and potential cross-species transmission, the influenza virus is very threatening to humankind. New types of influenza are endlessly emerging. The potential H5N1 \n\nFactors affecting the quantity and quality of literature related to emerging disease include the overall strength of the national research effort, the number of institutions and scientists engaged in such research, the amount of funding, the epidemiology of the disease, the level of scientific investigations in the field and so on. The literature relating to SARS has decreased since 2004, mainly because SARS cases vanished after 2004. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was once considered an emerging infectious disease, but the quantity of literature on AIDS is persistently high because of the continuation of the global pandemic of AIDS (Tian et al. 2012) . Also the quantity of H1N1 influenza literature sharply increased in 2009 because of the world epidemic of the H1N1 influenza.\n\nThe quantity and quality of emerging disease literature is also related to the science and technology capability. The United States had only 27 SARS case and no deaths, but the quantity of its SARS article literature is more. By contrast, some countries, such as Vietnam, had 63 SARS cases (WHO 2003) , but the quantity of SARS article literature is far behind that of the United States. Another example is that the United States and the Japan have no human H7N9 influenza cases, but they have relatively more H7N9 literature. \n\nThrough analysis of the H7N9 journal articles from mainland China, it was found that these articles covered different fields, including epidemiology, clinical, virology, phylogenetics and so on. The NEJM article from the China CDC in April 2013 and February 2014 analyzed data obtained from field investigations and characterize the epidemiologic Scientometrics (2015) 105:485-495 493 characteristics of H7N9 cases in China (Liu et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014 ). The NEJM journal article from Zhejiang University in June 2013 analyzed the clinical findings in 111 cases of influenza H7N9 virus infection . The Lancet article from Chinese Academy of Sciences in June 2013 did phylogenetic analyses to extrapolate the potential origins of the virus and possible routes of reassortment events (Liu et al. 2013) . The Nature article from the China CDC in July 2013 analyzed the biological features of the H7N9 influenza virus (Zhou et al. 2013) . The Science article from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in July 2013 found that one virus isolated from humans was highly transmissible in ferrets by respiratory droplets .\n\nImproving Chinese capability to respond to emerging infectious diseases\n\nTen years ago, in the SARS response, the science and technology support capability of China was inadequate. For example, the SARS biological agent first appeared in China, but the gene sequence was first published by another country (Marra et al. 2003) . Due to lack of experience, some health practitioners were infected and even died. Ten years later, the environment had changed notably. The overall capacity of the national disease prevention and control system has been greatly improved. A Web-based infectious disease reporting system has been built during the past decade, and it played a vital role in the response to H7N9 (Wang 2013) . In 2008, China initiated major national science and technology projects including ''Prevention and Control of Major Infectious Diseases Including HIV/ AIDS and Viral Hepatitis'', together with the ''973'' project, ''863'' project and the National Natural Science Foundation, which promoted basic and applied research into emerging infectious disease. All of those have improved the science and technology support capability in response to emerging infectious diseases in China and the world."}
