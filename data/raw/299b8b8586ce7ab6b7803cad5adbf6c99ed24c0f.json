{"title": "Expanding roles for CD4 + T cells in immunity to viruses NIH Public Access", "body": "Viral pathogens enter the body by diverse routes, infect almost every type of host cell, and mutate to avoid immune recognition. Destroying rapidly dividing viruses efficiently thus requires coordination between multiple immune mechanisms carried out by distinct cell types recognizing distinct viral determinants. At the earliest stages of infection, innate immune defense mechanisms provide a critical initial check on viral replication that can also mobilize cells of the adaptive immune system to develop into effector cells that mediate viral clearance.\n\nProfessional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) activated through germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) migrate to secondary lymphoid organs where they present virus-derived peptides on MHC class II molecules to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and deliver costimulatory signals, a process that is also enhanced by PRR ligation. Na\u00efve CD4 + T cells respond by extensive division and differentiation to give rise to multiple populations of effector T cells with specialized functions (BOX 1). The best characterized subsets are T helper 1 (T H 1) and T H 2 cells, characterized by strong IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 production, respectively 1 . More recently, specialized B cell helpers, known as follicular helper T (T FH ) cells, and the pro-inflammatory T H 17 cell subset, have been described. Finally, regulatory T (T Reg ) cells have come to be appreciated as crucial for avoiding over-exuberant immune responses and associated immunopathology 2 .\n\nA crucial role of CD4 + T cells is to ensure optimal responses by other lymphocytes. Thus, CD4 + T cells are necessary as helpers to promote B cell antibody production, and often the generation of cytotoxic CD8 + T cell responses and memory development. Recent studies define additional important roles for CD4 + T cells in enhancing innate immune responses and in mediating antiviral effector functions that are distinct from their helper functions. We will discuss what is known about the T cell subsets that develop following acute viral infection, and how different subsets contribute to viral control and clearance.\n\nIf antiviral mechanisms are elicited rapidly and the load and pathogenicity of virus is not overwhelming, infection is resolved and the majority of effector CD4 + T cells die, leaving a much smaller population of memory CD4 + T cells that persists long-term 3, 4 . Memory CD4 + T cells have unique functional attributes which endow them with superior protective capacities compared to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells upon reencounter with antigen. We need to understand these additional functions of memory CD4 + T cells to evaluate their potential contribution to immunity when they are induced either by infection or vaccination. We will contrast the attributes of and roles CD4 + T cells play in viral control in both the first encounter with virus and upon re-infection.\n\nIn order to develop into primary effector T cell populations to combat viral infections, na\u00efve CD4 + T cells need to recognize peptide antigens presented on MHC class II molecules on activated APCs. APC activation is achieved by recognition of conserved elements of microbial products by APC-expressed pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). Signaling via PRRs leads to the upregulation of MHC class II, costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, and inflammatory cytokines that are involved in APC-mediated stimulation of T cells. TLRs and CLRs expressed on the surface of APCs, such as TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR11, dectin-1, dectin-2, and MINCLE, as well as PRRs located within endosomes, such as TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, recognize products of diverse viral pathogens. Other recognition receptors, RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) and NLRs (NOD1, and NOD2) react to signatures of pathogens in the cytoplasm, the former reacting to RNA viruses and the latter to various microbial and viral PAMPs as well as to cellular stresses that can be triggered by infection 5 .\n\nActivated APCs also secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12 6 . Some of these factors, such as IFNs, directly contribute to an antiviral state in infected cells, while others promote the activation of innate immune cells so they can more effectively control the virus. PRR ligation promotes APC activation and migration to draining lymph nodes for na\u00efve CD4 + T cells activation, the first step in generating primary antiviral T cell responses (FIGURE 1). The efficiency of this process, especially in immunologically na\u00efve hosts, can determine whether viral replication or T cell expansion, differentiation, and the elaboration of adaptive immunity, gains an upper hand. The priming environment can vary dramatically in different viral infections due to variables such as the route of exposure, viral dose, and the organ or cell types targeted. As extensively reviewed elsewhere, the subset of APC activated, such as plasmacytoid versus conventional dendritic cells (DCs) 7, 8 the level of antigen and duration of presentation 9 , and the patterns and amounts of cytokines produced by the different APC 10 can all impact the extent of expansion of adaptive immune cells and their subset specialization.\n\nIn contrast to T H -polarized effectors generated in vitro, effector subsets responding in vivo are often characterized by plasticity and heterogeneity in terms of cytokine production potential. Nevertheless, the CD4 + effectors generated in response to viral infection are mainly T H 1-like, characterized by strong IFN-\u03b3 production, which classically depends on exposure to high levels of IL-12 and type I IFNs in the priming milieu 11 . There are, however, several examples of intact T H 1 responses generated in response to certain viruses independently of IL-12 or type I IFN [12] [13] [14] , suggesting that other factors can also contribute to the generation of the T H 1 phenotype. These virally induced innate mediators repress development of other polarized T H cell subsets, intensifying T H 1 cell polarization, and even affect already polarized effector cells. For example, transfer of polarized T H 2 cells to hosts that are infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitus virus (LCMV) leads to development of a mixed T H 1/T H 2 phenotype 7 days after infection that is characterized by strong IFN-\u03b3 production and diminished IL-4 production. Interestingly, the majority of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in this 'mixed' T H 1/T H 2 cell population also produced IL-4 or IL-13, and in vitro   experiments found that IL-12 and type I IFNs were critical in driving the cells to this mixed  T H 1/T H 12 phenotype 15 . IL-12 can also override responses by already polarized T H 17 cells  in vitro and in vivo to generate effector CD4 + T cells that closely resemble T H 1 cell   populations 16, 17 . In addition, viral infection leads to production of anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, from innate immune cells and this can also suppress the generation of antiviral T H 17-polarized responses 18 .\n\nOriginally, it was thought that IL-4 producing T H 2 cell responses were necessary to drive optimal humoral immune responses. Thus the predominance of T H 1 over T H 2 responses against viral pathogens was somewhat surprising given the generation of neutralizing antibody that is important for viral clearance and long-term immunity. However, adoptive transfer of T H 1 cells, as well as transfer of T H 2 cells, was shown to provide efficient help for the generation of anti-viral IgG responses 19, 20 . The signature T H 1-type cytokine IFN-\u03b3 enhances IgG2a class-switching responses, explaining why IgG2a is usually the dominant isotype in IgG responses generated against viruses 21 . In fact, several studies have found that, far from promoting antiviral responses, T H 2 cell-associated mediators, and IL-4 in particular, have a strong negative impact on protection, and drive immunopathology during infection with many viruses, including influenza virus 18, 22 , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 23 , herpes simplex virus (HSV) 24 and vaccinia virus 25 .\n\nThe role of T H 17-type effector responses that are generated during viral infection is not yet well understood, but virus-specific IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells have been detected in mice following infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) 26 , HSV, 27 , vaccinia virus 28 , Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus 29 , and influenza virus 17 , although at levels lower than that of T H 1 cells. The generation of polarized T H 17 cells during virus infection has been correlated with high levels of IL-6 that are produced in response to virus and may also be influenced by TGF-\u03b2 29 . T H 17 cells are implicated in driving excessive inflammation during autoimmunity, and IL-17 may contribute to immunopathology during responses against viruses, as demonstrated in studies using influenza virus and vaccinia virus 28, 30 . However, in some cases T H 17 cells can contribute to protection against viruses 17 . One protective mechanism mediated by T H 17 cells might be the promotion of enhanced neutrophil responses at sites of infection. IL-17 upregulates CXC-chemokines that promote neutrophil recruitment 31 and neutrophils have been demonstrated to contribute to protection against certain viruses, including influenza virus 32 . We expect other functions will be indentified in future studies as well, considering that T H 17 cells often produce significant levels of IL-21 and IL-22 in addition to IL-17 17 . Although not extensively studied in viral systems, IL-22 production from T H 17 cells could be involved in regulating the expression of defensins, and could also play an important role in tissue repair (reviewed in 33 ). IL-21 production may also regulate aspects of innate responses during viral infection and is involved in sustaining CD8+ T cell responses during chronic viral infection, as will be discussed.\n\nCD4 + T cell functions play an important role in responses against many viral pathogens. While the best-studied pathways of help are those resulting in B cell antibody production, CD4 + T cells also significantly enhance effector CD8 + T cell responses in some but not all viral infections and contribute to the maintenance of a functional memory CD8 T cell pool. (FIGURE 2 ). Beyond help, effector CD4 T cells regulate inflammation and often directly mediate viral clearance.\n\nCurrent licensed vaccines directed against viral pathogens are evaluated almost exclusively by their ability to generate strong neutralizing antibody responses. Antibody-mediated protection can be extraordinarily long-lived 34 and neutralizing antibodies present at the time of pathogen encounter can prevent rather than combat infection, achieving 'sterilizing' immunity. Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which CD4 + T cells help B cells during viral infection to define what is required for effective vaccination (FIGURE 2a). CD4 + T cells that enter B cell follicles and provide help to B cells resulting in germinal center (GC) formation are now referred to as follicular helpers, T FH cells. The generation and detailed functional capabilities have been expertly reviewed elsewhere 35, 36 , so we will focus on their role during viral infection.\n\nT FH cells are likely to play the key role in the generation of long-lived antibody responses and protective immunity regardless of the specific viral pathogen. CD4 + T cells have been shown to be required for the generation of optimal antibody responses following infection with corona virus 40 , vaccinia virus 41 , yellow fever virus 42 , and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 43 though a direct association with Tfh subsets is not yet clear. In acute LCMV and influenza infection, SAP (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) -associated protein) expression in T cells is necessary to direct T FH cell-dependent formation of germinal centers 37, 38 and is required for the generation of B cell memory and long-lived IgG antibody following viral challenge 37, 39 . How other distinct cytokine-polarized CD4 + T cell subsets contribute to B cell responses during primary viral infection. One possibility is that distinct T H cell subsets, such as T H 1, T H 2, and T H 17 cells, can each develop into T FH cells and provide efficient help for B cells. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study demonstrating that such polarized subsets can be reprogrammed to express T FH characteristics in vitro 44 . The often-broad spectrum of isotypes present in long-lived virusspecific antibody in individuals with immunity to a virus favors such a model. Several costimulatory ligands expressed by CD4 + T cells contribute to promoting B cell activation and antibody production. One notable ligand is CD40L. Interactions between CD40, expressed on B cells, and CD40L, expressed on activated CD4 + T cells are crucial for generating optimal humoral responses against several viral pathogens, including LCMV, Pichinde virus, VSV, HSV, and influenza virus 45-47 . ICOS expression by T FH cells has also been shown to be important for germinal center formation 35 and studies have shown that ICOS expression is required for optimal primary humoral responses against LCMV, VSV, and influenza virus 48 . The role of other costimulatory molecules expressed by T FH cells is less clear during viral infection. For example, OX40-deficient mice generate normal levels of class-switched antibody during responses against LCMV, VSV, and influenza virus 49 . Further studies are required to determine the importance of additional signals passing between T FH cells and B cells for generating timely antibody responses during viral infection and in the formation of long-lived antibody-secreting cells and memory B cells that provide enduring protection.\n\nCD4 + T cell help for the initial generation of CD8 + T cell responses and the survival of memory CD8 + T cells is not as well understood as their roles in B cell help. In parallel to B cell help, however, CD40L -CD40 interactions between CD4 + T cells and APCs are crucial (FIGURE 2b). It has been suggested that this APC-mediated mode of help by CD4 + T cells for CD8 + T cells is of minor importance during viral infection because APCs are activated effectively by viruses through PRRs 50, 51 , hence replacing the need for CD4 + T cellmediated 'licensing' 51,52, 53 . Whether activation of APCs through PRRs, targeting TLRs, for example, results in identical licensing of APCs as through activation by CD4 + T cells is not clear 54 . The generation of primary CTL responses against vaccinia virus 55 , HSV 56 and influenza virus in some 57, 58 but not all studies 59 have been found to be compromised in the absence of CD4 + T cells, indicating that they may not be. The difference between viruses that are dependent or not on CD4 + T cell help for the generation of optimal effector CD8 + T cell responses may depend on what elements of the inflammatory environment are triggered after infection and to what degree. For example, the strong type I IFN response induced by polyI:C administration can bypass the otherwise obligate requirement for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of CD8 + T cell responses upon vaccinia virus infection 60 . It is not clear whether different cytokine-polarized CD4 + T cells play distinct roles in mediating CD8 + T cell help. During the primary response, CD4 + T cell-driven APC licensing likely occurs before the full polarization of CD4 + T cell effectors, but fully polarized effectors could also promote efficient CD8 + T cell responses against viral pathogens through means other than licensing APCs. For example, chemokines produced upon antigen-specific interactions between DC and CD4 + T cells can actively attract CD8 + T cells to activated APCs 61 , and CD40-CD40L interactions between CD4 + T cells and APCs can protect the latter from CTLmediated death 62 , perhaps leading to more efficient CD8 + T cell priming.\n\nAnother role for CD4 + T cells is to facilitate the development of functional pathogenspecific memory CD8 + T cells that can respond upon rechallenge 52, 53, 63, 64 . One wellcharacterized mechanism of this regulation by CD4 + T cells is the down-regulation of TRAIL expression on responding CD8 + T cells (FIGURE 2b). It is thought that 'helped' CD8 + T cells down-regulate TRAIL and are therefore not susceptible to 65 or have delayed 66 susceptibity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, unlike unhelped CD8 + T cells, which undergo enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis upon antigen rechallenge. Further studies suggest that CD4 + T cell help regulates additional TRAIL-independent elements, for example down-regulating PD-1 expression, to contribute to the function of pathogenspecific memory CD8 + T cells [67] [68] [69] .\n\nCD4 + T cells may also act during the initial programming of responding CD8 + T cells to generate efficient memory through signals delivered by activated APCs such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, or IL-15 70 , which could also improve the kinetics and quality of CD8 + T cell effector generation. Additionally, paracrine IL-2 produced by CD4 + T cells during the initial priming of CD8 + T cells responding to LCMV dramatically improves CD8 + T cell recall response potential 71 , and CD4 + T cells have been shown to upregulate CD25 (IL-2R\u03b1) expression on CD8 + T cells responding to vaccinia virus and VSV 72 . At later phases of the response CD4 + T cells produce additional cytokines, such as IL-21, which appears to be a critical signal in down-regulating TRAIL expression on CD8 + T cells responding against vaccinia virus 73 . Finally, evidence suggests that direct ligation of CD40 on na\u00efve CD8 + T cells by CD40L on CD4 + T cells can enhance the generation of memory CD8 + T cells 74 (FIGURE 2).\n\nThus, CD4 + T cells seem to be particularly critical for maintaining memory CD8 + T cell populations 75 , and the presence of CD4 + T cells during priming may influence the homing and ultimately the distribution of memory CD8 + T cells 76 . To date no specialized helper subset for CD8 + T cells analogous to the specialized B cell helpers (T FH cells) has been identified. Defining conditions that lead to CD4 + T cells with potent CD8 + T cell helper activity could be important for developing improved vaccines against several viral pathogens.\n\nIn addition to activating cells of the innate immune system at early time-points and providing potent help to promote the functions of B cells and CD8 + T cells during viral infection, CD4 + T cells develop into populations of effector T cells that migrate to sites of infection 77 . Accumulating evidence suggests that effector CD4 + T cells have potent protective roles during viral infection that are independent of their helper activities. Strong immune protection mediated by CD4 + T cells has been described in animal models of rotavirus 78 92, 93 . In several of these studies, the direct protective mechanism employed by CD4 + T cells has not been defined. However, effector CD4 + T cells have in general been shown to protect against viral pathogens through two distinct mechanisms: first, through the production of cytokines, most notably IFN-\u03b3 and TNF 82, 83, 86, 88, 90, 91, 93 and second, through direct cytolytic activity 79, 82, 83, 88, 93 involving both perforin-87 and FAS-dependent 85 killing (FIGURE 3). Cytotoxic CD4 + T cells have also been observed following infection with LCMV 94 .\n\nEvidence suggests that cytotoxic activity of CD4 + T cell effectors is achieved independently of T H 1 cell polarization 95 . A recent study suggests that expression of the transcription factor eomesodermin, but not T-bet, is critical in driving the development of cytotoxic function in CD4 + T cells in vivo 96 . Thus, CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic activity may be a separate subset defined by function, and in that sense more akin to T FH cells. That MHC II expression is largely restricted to professional APC under steady state conditions could limit the protective potential of virus-specific cytotoxic CD4 + T cells to infections that target these populations. However, multiple cell types are capable of expressing MHC II following pathogen challenge, dramatically increasing the potential for cytotoxic CD4 + T cells to impact the outcome of viral infection. For example, epithelial cells activated through infection 97 or through IFN-\u03b3 signals 98 can strongly upregulate MHC II.\n\nWhile immune protection mediated by effector CD4 + T cells through cytotoxicity requires direct recognition of virally infected cells, the protective impact of soluble factors released by effector CD4 + T cells may act more broadly and on multiple targets. For example, release of IFN-\u03b3 can lead to the establishment of an antiviral state in the surrounding tissue and also activate several innate immune cell populations, most notably macrophages, to mediate antiviral activity 99 . Thus it is likely that an array CD4 effectors that migrate to the sites of viral infection both eliminate virally infected cells and enhance viral elimination via cytokines.\n\nEffector CD4 + T cells are capable of potent immunoregulation at sites of infection. A subset of T H 1 cells has been found to transiently co-produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 at the peak of the effector CD4 + T cell response in many models of infectious disease 100 . Several signals have been found to stimulate the generation of IL-10-producing effector CD4 + T cells, including high levels of antigen, soluble factors including IL-12 and IL-27, and costimulatory signals including ICOS (reviewed in 100 ). IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine but is most often associated with anti-inflammatory or inhibitory properties during strong immune responses (FIGURE 3). The impact of IL-10 production by effector CD4 + T cells is complicated and can be variable, especially in situations where strong immune responses, capable of serious immunopathology, are required to eliminate a rapidly replicating pathogen. For instance, the absence of IL-10 during influenza virus infection can lead on one hand to improved survival, due to enhanced T cell 17 and antibody responses 101 , or on the other, to exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology, leading to increased mortality 102 . Similarly, ablating IL-10 has been found to enhance protection against WNV 103 and vaccinia virus 104 , but to lead to increased pathology upon infection with RSV 105 , and death upon infection with mouse hepatitis virus 106 and corona virus 107 . Finally, as well as producing IL-10 themselves, effector CD4 + T cells can also promote IL-10 production by effector CD8 + T cells during virus infection 108 .\n\nIn addition to the development of IFN-\u03b3 + IL-10 + effector T cells, enhanced frequencies of CD4 + regulatory T (T Reg ) cells, both FOXP3 + and FOXP3 \u2212 , have been observed in numerous human and animal studies of viral infection. The majority of studies assessing the impact of T Reg cells during viral infection have concentrated on models of chronic infection and in such settings T Reg cells have been found, depending on the particular pathogen, to have both beneficial roles, such as limiting collateral tissue damage, and detrimental roles, including diminishing the overall magnitude of antiviral immune responses 109 . The antigenspecificity of T Reg cells in the context of infectious disease has not been addressed often, but it is likely that T Reg cell populations contain at least some virus-specific cells, and that these populations are generated in concert with anti-viral effector T cell responses, as has recently been demonstrated in a corona virus model 110 . The accumulation of virus-specific Foxp3 + T Regs during viral infection could be due to expansion of pre-existing 'natural' T Regs specific for viral antigen or could also reflect the generation of Foxp3 + T Reg from conventional CD4 + T cell precursors (adaptive or induced T Reg ). An important factor in this conversion is TGF-\u03b2 111 . How induced T Regs impact viral infection is not well understood, but evidence from studies with human CD4 + T cells and HIV suggests that viral infection can enhance Foxp3 expression through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent mechanism 112 . This finding and others suggests that some viral pathogens may promote the differentiation of various regulatory T cell populations to further their own goals. Evidence for this hypothesis is found in several models of mostly chronic viral infection 113, 114 . Although less studied, during acute viral infection, T Reg cells have been shown to limit pathology upon WNV 115 , RSV 116, 117 , and in a model of IAV infection 118 . A detailed account of T Reg induction and responses during viral infection infection is beyond the scope of this review but has been discussed elsewhere 119 .\n\nCompared with CD8 + T cells 120 , much less is known about how chronic infection impacts CD4 + T cell phenotype and function. However, the impact of persistent virus infection on CD4 + T cell function, and the importance of CD4 + T cells during chronic viral infection are receiving increasing attention. During persistent infection with LCMV Clone 13, responding CD4 + T cells lose the abilities to produce T H 1-associated effector cytokines and to respond optimally following virus rechallenge 121 . The loss of function of CD4 + T cells responding to persistent antigen is likely driven by high levels of antigen following the priming phase 122 and seems not to be regulated by intrinsic changes in APCs that are caused by chronic viral pathogens 121 . Chronic infection may not lead to complete exhaustion of responding CD4 + T cells. For example, functionally impaired CD4 + T cells have been observed in HIV patients, and treatment with antibody stimulating CD28 123 , blocking TIM-3 124 or blocking PD-1 signalling 125 dramatically increased their proliferative potential in vitro. Also, a recent study by Fahey et al. found that during chronic LCMV infection responding CD4 + T cells progressively adopt a functional T FH -polarized phenotype 126 . That CD4 + T cells may retain specific functions during chronic infection helps to explain earlier observations that persistent LCMV infection is eventually cleared through mechanisms that are dependent on CD4 + T cells (BOX 2) . These findings and others (reviewed in 137, 138 ) have important implications in the design of vaccines and treatments against viruses that result in chronic infection of humans including HIV and hepatitis B and C and hence deserve further analysis.\n\nFollowing the resolution of infection, or upon successful vaccination, the majority of virusspecific effector CD4 + T cells die leaving a small population to transition to memory, which is retained at levels greater than before priming. This population of CD4 memory decays with time and may require boosting . It is unclear which responding CD4 + T cell effectors transition to memory but a recent study suggests that those with decreased expression of Ly6c and T-bet have greater potential to do so 139 . A quantitative gain in antigen-specific T cells represents one important advantage of the memory state but memory CD4 + T cells also differ from na\u00efve T cells by broad functional criteria. Several of these attributes of memory CD4 + T cells allow them to respond much faster and more vigorously than na\u00efve CD4 + T cells upon pathogen challenge 140 . Additionally, subpopulations of memory CD4 + T cells have wider trafficking patterns and some are retained at or near sites of previous infection 141 , which contributes to their ability to be rapidly activated upon local reinfection. Tissue tropism and/or retention of tissue-resident memory CD4 + T cells may depend on specific interactions between adhesion molecules and their receptors\n\nMemory CD4 + T cell recognition of APC following re-infection has rapid consequences. Within 48 hours of intranasal influenza virus infection, antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells cause an enhanced inflammatory response in the lung, characterized by the upregulation of a wide array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 147 (Figure 4) . T H 1-and T H 17-polarized memory cells, as well as memory CD4 + T cells generated by previous infection strongly induce expression of a cohort of these molecules including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p40, CCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10. In contrast, T H 2-polarized and unpolarized (T H 0) memory T cells have a minimal impact on pulmonary inflammation following influenza virus challenge. Memory CD4 + T cell induction of innate inflammatory responses requires recognition of antigen on CD11c + APCs, which become activated during interaction with memory CD4 + T cells resulting in their upregulation of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and which contribute to the subsequent innate inflammatory response through production of factors such as IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. In contrast, the na\u00efve CD4 + T cell response in vivo does not appreciably impact inflammation at 48 hr post infection 147 .\n\nIn other studies, unprimed CD4 + T cells actually down-regulate innate inflammation following MHV infection 148 . The ability of T H 1-and T H 17-polarized memory CD4 + T cells, but not T H 2-or T H 0-polarized memory cells to induce the early inflammatory response is well-correlated with the pattern of protective immunity observed in unprimed mice challenged with influenza following the transfer of the same T H -polarized effector subsets 17, 87 , and the memory CD4 + T cell-enhanced inflammatory response correlates with an early control of viral titer 147 \n\nand was also correlated with dramatic enhancement of innate responses against virus. This has not yet been studied in other viral models.\n\nWe suggest that this early memory CD4 + T cell activation of innate immunity concomitantly serves to lessen the 'stealth phase' of infection during which titers of virus are still too low to generate robust inflammatory responses 150 . This would prevent viruses from gaining a foothold by infecting and replicating in cells where they would not come to the attention of the immune system until substantial replication had occurred. Induction of early innate immunity by memory CD4 + T cells, which is independent of known PRR pathways 147 , could also enhance innate responses when viral pathogens, such as vaccinia virus and influenza virus, actively antagonize elements of innate recognition pathway like PKR (dsRNA-dependent protein kinase) 151 .\n\nOne intriguing aspect of the innate activation was that induction of memory CD4 + T cells specific for a known protein epitope (ovalbumin) resulted in partial viral control when ovalbumin was co-administered with an influenza virus not expressing ovalbumin 147 . Thus, we hypothesize that this induction of innate immunity could act like an adjuvant to substitute for PRR stimulation 147 including promoting responses to vaccines that do not contain live virus. For example, memory CD4 T cell activation of innate immunity could be induced by vaccines including antigens that stimulate memory cells known to be widely present in the human population (e. g. those specific for tetanus). This could possibly enhance the immunogenicity of these \"weak\" vaccines.\n\nIt has recently become clear that heterologous viral immunity, in which memory T cells generated to a particular virus cross-react with epitopes expressed by other unrelated viruses, is quite a widespread phenomenon, and that it is likely to play a significant role in human populations which have been exposed to large numbers of antigens both by infection and vaccination 152 . Although heterologous immune responses can be protective, they may in some cases be deleterious resulting in dramatic immunopathology 153 . It will be important to determine to what extent the ability of memory CD4 T cells to induce innate immunity contributes to both beneficial and deleterious heterologous responses.\n\nIn addition, we point out that the impact of memory CD4 + T cells on the early innate response may also dramatically alter subsequent antigen-specific responses against viral pathogens through the establishment of chemokine gradients that facilitate the optimal influx of both effector and memory T cells. For example, by upregulating local production of CCR5 ligands at the site of infection, memory CD4 + T cells could facilitate the enhanced influx of memory CD8 + T cells that contribute to early viral control in a model of heterosubtypic influenza infection 154 . In HSV2 infection, IFN-\u03b3 expression by CD4 + T cells is required to induce local chemokine gradients for the optimal migration of CD8 + T cell effectors to the vaginal tissue following vaginal infection 155 . Similar roles for CD4 + T cells in facilitating adaptive immunity through the generation of local chemokine gradients at sites of infection may well operate in other viral disease models, though teasing apart the roles of CD4 + T cell help in the generation of CD8 + T cell effectors and in modifying the trafficking of CD8 + T cell effectors is often difficult 40, 86, 156 .\n\nSeveral studies indicate that memory CD4 + T cells are superior to na\u00efve T cells in providing B cell help and they have been found to drive earlier B cell expansion, enhanced antibody levels, and earlier class switching compared to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells [157] [158] [159] . In many cases, where pre-existing circulating antibody is able to recognize virus, re-infection may never occur. However, more rapid antibody production could be particularly important after reinfection with rapidly mutating viruses such as influenza virus, where generation of neutralizing antibody against new variants that evade previously generated antibodies could be necessary for immunity.\n\nThat memory CD4 + T cells are superior helpers compared to na\u00efve T cells is suggested by multiple criteria and many mechanisms may contribute. Memory CD4 + T cells contain preformed CD40L, an important signal in CD4 + T cell help for antibody production 160 , which may especially contribute. The location of memory cells may also be an advantage (see above). For example, antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells with a T FH cell phenotype are retained in draining lymph nodes of mice for over 6 months following protein immunization 161 . The enhanced production and polarized profile of cytokines produced by the memory T cells versus na\u00efve cells likely promote a more robust B cell antibody response and dictate the isotype, which plays a key role in efficacy against viruses such Ebola 162 , WNV 163 and influenza virus 164 . Recent observations suggest that IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 produced by T FH cells have a central role in driving not only immunoglobulin class switching in the germinal center, but also affinity maturation 165 .\n\nWhether memory CD4 + T cells are superior to na\u00efve CD4 + T cells at providing help for primary or secondary CD8 + T cell responses during viral infection has not been rigorously tested. However, the features of memory cells described here predict that memory CD4 + T cells could promote an accelerated response by na\u00efve CD8 + T cells both through more rapid licensing of APCs and through more rapid and robust production of IL-2 and possibly other cytokines; these possibilities need to be explored. In support of this concept, a study utilizing Listeria monocytogenes found that T H 1-but not-T H 2 polarized memory CD4 + T cells enhanced primary CD8 + T cell responses both in terms of magnitude and cytokine production, though the mechanism of memory CD4 + T cell mediated help was not determined 166 . Whatever the pathways involved, the fact of enhanced production of CD8 + memory and the greater dependence on CD4 + T cell help when PRR stimulation is limited, suggest that CD4 + T cell help will be of particular importance in achieving optimum CD8 + T cell memory responses when vaccines are used that do not contain live replicationcompetent virus.\n\nMemory CD4 + T cells capable of producing multiple cytokines have been correlated with superior protective capacity in numerous studies 167 , but how such cells achieve enhanced protection has not been addressed. One possibility is that the more robust protection observed in models of viral disease seen when memory CD4 + T cells are present or introduced is that the secondary effectors generated from memory CD4 + T cells may be much more efficient than the primary effectors generated from naive cells in directly combating pathogens. Our recent experiments directly comparing such effectors upon influenza infection support such a view (Strutt, McKinstry, Bradley, Swain, unpublished observations). We find that upon transfer of equal numbers of memory or na\u00efve CD4 + T cell precursors specific for influenza, the secondary effectors that develop upon viral challenge contain higher frequencies of multiple cytokine producing cells (IFN\u03b3+, TNF + , IL-2 + ) and reach higher numbers than corresponding primary effectors. Furthermore, while strong IL-10 production characterizes primary CD4 + T cell effector responses against influenza, secondary effectors produce dramatically reduced IL-10 168 . Thus, secondary CD4 + T cells seem to give rise to a spectrum of secondary effector T cells that are distinct from primary effectors derived from na\u00efve precursors and we predict that this will result in distinct regulation of protective recall responses. We also suggest that further functions of secondary effectors will be discovered as more comparative analyses are done.\n\nWe have reviewed how CD4 + T cells contribute to protective immunity both in primary and secondary responses against viral pathogens via an extensive series of mechanisms working both at the site of infection and in secondary lymphoid organs. Several key principles emerge. The various distinct CD4 + T cells subsets, including T H 1 cells, T H 17 cells, T FH cells and those effector CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic functions, each play important roles in the antiviral response. Key among these is the provision of help to B cells, well known to be critical for antibody production and for the generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. However, CD4 + T cell effector roles of direct cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine secretion at the site of infection and the ability to enhance CD8 responses, suggest multiple additional functions which we suggest can synergize with each other and provide more robust immunity by doing so.\n\nMemory CD4 + T cells have additional protective functions compared to na\u00efve cells. They induce early innate inflammatory responses in the lung that contribute to viral control. Memory CD4 + T cells provide help to B cells, and most likely CD8 + T cells, earlier than do effector T cells that are derived from na\u00efve precursors, thereby leading to faster and more robust protective antiviral immune responses. Finally, secondary effectors derived from memory precursors are likely to be more capable of mediating direct antiviral activity.\n\nThe picture that emerges is that CD4 + T cells carry out an impressive variety of functions at different times and in different sites, and we suggest the synergy of these distinct mechanisms provides an extraordinarily high level of viral control. Depending on the pathogen and dose, these mechanisms may often be redundant, but they are likely to each make key contributions following exposure to high doses of rapidly replicating viruses, and in cases where viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade individual functions. We point out that the study of the immune response to viral infections has in the past and will in the future reveal novel mechanisms by which CD4 + T cells function to protect against pathogens and thus lead to a better understanding of how vaccines can be designed to harness the power of CD4 + T cell memory. \n\nUpon recognition of specific antigen presented by an appropriately activated APC, na\u00efve CD4 + T cells undergo several rounds of division and can become polarized into distinct T helper cell (T H ) effector subsets that differentially orchestrate protective immune responses. The differentiation of polarized effectors is controlled by unique patterns of transcription factors whose expression is determined by multiple signals, but particularly by soluble factors acting on responding CD4 + T cells during their activation. The elucidation of the critical cytokines governing the differentiation of distinct T H subsets has allowed researchers to examine the protective capacities of differently polarized CD4 + T cell subsets in several models of infectious disease.\n\nAlthough the production of signature cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-17, are routinely used to assign subsets (T H 1, T H 2 and T H 17, respectively) to responding CD4 + T cells, it is increasingly clear that considerable plasticity exists within T H subsets in vivo, especially during responses to pathogen. Moreover, certain cytokines, for example, IL-10, can be produced by subpopulations of cells within multiple effector subsets. Finally, successful clearance of viral pathogens in particular often depends upon complex CD4 + T cell responses encompassing multiple T H cell subsets that are capable of mediating direct anti-viral functions, of providing help for B cells, of regulating immunopathology, and of mediating cytotoxic killing of virally infected cells. CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic activity have been described in a number of models of viral disease as well as in the clinic. Upon restimulation, memory CD4 + T cells retain their previous effector functions and rapidly produce effector cytokines. This property of primed CD4 + T cells represents a key advantage of the memory state.\n\nCertain T H cell subsets, including T FH cells and regulatory T (T Reg ) cells, are often defined less by cytokine profile and more by their functional attributes. Further studies will be required to determine whether populations of CD4 + T cells with specialized function can include several subsets of cytokine polarized subsets.\n\nThe best-characterized function of CD4 + T cells during persistent viral infection is the maintenance of competent CD8 + T cells that retain robust effector functions longterm 127 . Although most rigorously studied in models of LCMV infection, CD4 + T cells have also been found to impact CD8 + T cell responses to varying degrees in other models of chronic infection including MCMV 128 , mouse polyoma virus 129 , and gamma herpes virus 130 . Recent studies employing LCMV suggest that IL-21 production by CD4 + T cells during chronic infection is critical in maintaining functional CD8 + T cells that are able to contain the infection [131] [132] [133] . Importantly, clinical evidence also correlates the presence of higher numbers of IL-21-producing CD4 + T cells with improved CD8 + T cell function and improved control of HIV 134, 135 . These observations suggest new avenues that could improve vaccination strategies and adoptive transfer therapies 136 through the generation of CD4 + T cell populations specifically geared towards the provision of maximal help in the context of chronic infection.\n\nFollowing the resolution of primary immune responses, the majority of effector T cells die via apoptosis leaving behind a small population of long-lived memory cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to recirculating through lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, some memory cells reside at sites of infection. While the majority of these studies have concentrated on CD8 + T cell memory, CD4 + T cells also appear to survive for long periods in peripheral tissues 142, 143 .\n\nOften, the expression of distinct surface proteins distinguishes tissue-specific memory cells from conventional lymphoid memory populations. These molecules likely play a crucial role in the retention of memory T cells at different sites through specific interactions with ligands expressed in particular tissues. For example VLA1 expression by airway-resident memory CD4 + T cells in the lungs can facilitate binding to collagen 143 and high levels of CD103 expression by brain and skin-resident memory CD8 + T cells facilitates their interaction with E-cadherin-expressing cells 144, 145 .\n\nTissue resident memory T cells act as a first line of defense. Combined with the ability of memory, but not na\u00efve T cells, to be activated through recognition of antigen in peripheral tissues 146, 147 , the location of memory CD4 + T cell populations at potential sites of re-infection represent a powerful advantage of the memory state over the na\u00efve state in which a lag of several days precedes the influx of antigen-specific cells into infected sites. Tissue-resident memory cells may facilitate more rapid recruitment of and activation of innate cellular populations that are capable of controlling initial viral titers while simultaneously enhancing the kinetics of the development of pathogen-specific effector populations of T and B cells through the earlier activation of APCs.\n\nUnderstanding the important cues that drive the development of long-lived tissue-resident memory will likely represent an important area of research especially with consideration to the design of improved vaccination strategies.\n\nThe crucial initial steps in generating primary antiviral T cell responses are the uptake of viral antigen in infected tissue, activation by PRR ligation, and migration of APCs to draining lymph nodes. The nature of the viral infection as well as PRR ligation can influence the activation status of antigen-bearing APC and the Th-polarizing environment. Na\u00efve CD4 + T cell recognition of antigen on activated APCs during viral infection predominately results in the generation of T H 1 cells due to the presence of type I IFNs and IL-12, however, T H 17, T H 2 and T reg cell populations are also generated to some degree in certain viral infections. The best characterized pathway for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of CD8 + T cell effectors is through the activation (licensing) of APC via CD40L: CD40 interactions, and the provision of IL-2. A role for CD4 + T cell help in the initial generation of antiviral CD8 + T cell effector responses is often not clear, presumably because viruses can trigger PRRs and independently activate APC. However, a clear role for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of function of memory CD8 + T cells has been demonstrated upon infection with viruses. Down-regulation of TRAIL on CD8 + T cells is a prominent feature of 'helped' CD8 + T cells and at least in part facilitates their robust recall response during secondary infection. Virus-specific memory CD4 + T cells can directly activate DCs through the recognition of antigen presented by MHC class II molecules, even in the absence of costimulation delivered via PRR-mediated signaling. The critical signals delivered by memory CD4 + T cells to DC in this process are unclear and could involve both cell surface interactions and cytokine signals. The outcome of DC activation and initiation of inflammatory responses are similar whether triggered through PRR or memory CD4 + T cells, but in situations of infection with a rapidly replicating virus such as influenza, memory CD4 + T cell-mediated enhancement of innate immunity is substantially quicker and more effective."}
