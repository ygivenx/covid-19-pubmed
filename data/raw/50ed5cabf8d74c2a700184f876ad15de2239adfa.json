{"title": "An anti-Gn glycoprotein antibody from a convalescent patient potently 2 inhibits the infection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus", "body": "Type I interferon (interferon \u03b1/\u03b2) receptor gene (IFNAR1) deficient A129 mice (n = 5 144 per group) were subcutaneously injected with the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain of SFTSV at a 145 dose of either 2 or 20 plaque forming units (PFU). After 1 h, mice were intraperitoneally 146 administered with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Ab10, MAb4-5, or a human IgG 1 147 isotope control antibody at a dose of 600 \u03bcg (approximately corresponding to 30 mg/kg of 148 body weight); for 4 days at 24 h intervals, the injection of the same amount of antibody was 149 performed (Fig 2A) . 176 ranging from 10 pM to 1 nM ( Fig 4A) . Further, the amount of antibody bound to the HB29 177 and SD4 Gn glycoproteins coated on the ELISA plate was higher than that of the 178 Gangwon/Korea/2012 glycoproteins, at most of the tested concentrations. We also found that 179 Mab4-5 was reactive to Gn glycoprotein from the HB29 and SD4 strains ( Fig 4B) . 180 We used surface plasmon resonance analysis to determine the kinetics of Ab10 181 binding to the Gn glycoprotein of Gangwon/Korea/2012. Ab10 bound to Gn glycoprotein 182 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of 104 pM and found an association rate (K on ) 183 of 7.4 \uf0b4 10 5 M -1 s -1 and a dissociation rate (K off ) of 7.7 \uf0b4 10 -5 s -1 (Fig 4C) . \n\nIn the stem region, replacing the cystine residues (C349, C356, C376, and C381) 211 reduced the relative reactivity by more than 80%. This observation was consistent with a 212 previous report that the structural stability of Gn was disrupted by a C356A mutation [29] .\n\n213 Also, mutation of the flanking residues of cystine, corresponding to G351, L354, E355, I357, .

In the cases of mutation residues   215 which are distant from cysteine residues, mutation of G360, V361, R362, L363, T365, L370, 216 G387, and K389 residues reduced the relative reactivity by more than 80%. The other 217 residues had minor effects on reactivity. Overall, Ab10 binding to Gn was predicted to be 218 affected by 25 amino acid residues within domain II and the stem region of SFTSV Gn 327 For alanine-scanning mutagenesis, SFTSV Gn glycoprotein with amino acid residues (315-328 389) substituted with alanine were produced by cloning synthesized DNA fragments 329 (Integrated DNA Technologies) into modified pCEP4 vector, as described above.\n\n330 Subsequently, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced 331 to the C-terminus of the Fc region of human immunoglobulin heavy gamma1 and the whole 332 protein, designated as Gn-Fc-HA, was produced as described above.\n\n333 In order to produce histidine tagged SFTSV Gn glycoprotein, a ligand for surface plasmon 334 resonance analysis, a Gn-C\u03ba with six carboxy-terminal poly-histidine residues was designed 335 and produced as described above.
