{"title": "2019 novel coronavirus disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients: Report from one HD center in Wuhan, China", "body": "In December 2019, the initially outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city spread rapidly to all over China and even the world, becoming a serious pandemic [1] [2] [3] . As of February 17, 2020, the confirmed COVID-19 case in Wuhan city, nationwide of China, and world globally reached to 37152, 70635, and 71429 respectively [4, 5] . In the patients with COVID-19, some special population should be paid special attention to. Epidemiological survey shows that COVID-19 patients with underlined conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the elderly are not only susceptible, but also often more serious. These patients are at higher risk of admission to intensive care or death [6, 7] . In addition, the profound impact inflicted by COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns has also been noticed [8, 9] . However, as far as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease patients, especially uremic HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the large population size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD treatment in 61 centers in Wuhan city.), the high aggregation and mobility of HD center population, and the low immune function of uremic patients [10] , the situation of HD patients under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored.\n\nIn this study, we described an outbreak of COVID-19 in one HD center in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, which is located in the downtown of Wuhan city of China. A cluster of HD patients contracted COVID-19 were surveyed and followed until the day on February 17, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, and outcomes of some of these patients were reviewed. We expect our findings will shed light on the appropriate management of the HD center and HD patients in face of COVID-19 or other similar epidemic emerging.\n\n.

Enumeration data were described as number (%). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Statistical analysis), and a P value of less than 0.05 is considered as significant difference.\n\n230 patients and 33 staff in our HD center were included in this study. The dynamic course of COVID-19 epidemic from emerging to development is schematic presented in Figure 1 . We can see that the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on January 14, and the second diagnosed patient appeared on January 17. Since January 21, patients with COVID-19 had been requested to be isolated and all medical staff had be asked to upgrade their personal prevention and protection, which including wearing full protective gear such as waterproof disposable gown, cap, gloves, face shield, and N95 face mask, and more rigorous cleaning and disinfection. On The other 31 patients were distributed to the designated hospital receiving HD and other treatment. 4 (12.12%) medical staffs with COVID-19 were treated in isolation wards. There are totally 7 episodes of death were recorded since the epidemic outbreak, 2 happened in hospital and 5 at home. Among the 7 died cases, 6 were HD patients with COVID-19 and the other one was COVID-19 free ( Figure 2B ). All of the death were followed and reviewed by our research team, the presumed cause of death was heart failure, hyperkalemia and cerebrovascular disease, and none of them succumbed to severe pneumonia based on the appearance of death ( Figure 2B ). 37 HD patients with COVID-19 demographic and biochemical clinical data were summarized in Table 1 . In total, 23 (62%) men and 14 (38%) women were concluded.\n\nThe median age of all patients was 66 years (IQR, 55-81), and the median HD age was 34 months (IQR, 13-61). Meanwhile, all clinical data involving dry weight, hemoglobin, albumin, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and Kt/VUrea values were also listed in Table 1 . Unlike previous studies, the clinical symptoms of HD patients with COVID-19 were not obvious since the medical records showed that 4 (11%) patients had fever, 3 (8%) patients had fatigue, and only 1 (3%) patient had the symptom of cough, chest pain or nausea respectively (Table 2) . Besides, no other symptoms were observed in these patients.\n\nAccording to chest CT scans reports, 15 (41%) patients showed unilateral involvement (13 cases in right lung and 2 cases in left lung) and 22 (59%) patients showed bilateral involvement. 23 (62%) patients had multiple \"ground-glass opacity\" lesions in the lung which were regarded as the characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia (Table 3 and Figure 3 ).\n\nThe immune system is the key defense line for the body to resist and eliminate the virus. In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role. The underlined mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inflicted harmful effects leading to severe condition or death in COVID-19 patients is the over response against the virus by immune system and large amount of cytokines production (cytokine storm) [13] . The above results show that most of the HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in .

We speculated that this might be related to the special immune dysfunction of HD patients. Therefore, we detected the frequency of T cell, \n\nIn the first two decades of this century, three members of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have caused three major pandemic outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases. At present, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious, but its pathogenicity is weaker than the other two viruses.\n\nCompared with the previous two outbreaks, the epidemic area of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is wider, the number of infected people is larger, more patients died, and the global economic loss is greater. As the origin source of the epidemic and the the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients. HD patients are distinct different cluster from other population because: 1. They compose a large scale cluster. For instance, there are more than 7000 HD patients in Wuhan city; 2. They are scattered in different centers across the city; 3. They are highly mobile. Patients should regularly return to their residences and hospitals; 4. They usually receive concentrated dialysis treatment in a large space; 5. Their immune function are impaired; 6. When they are infected, they become a potential source of mobile infection. Considering these natures, HD patients and HD centers need to be given priority in epidemic prevention and control. According to our investigation on single center, the infection rate of HD patients in the COVID-19 epidemic is indeed much higher than that of other population, and the staffs in HD center are also susceptible to infection.\n\nReviewing the epidemic situation in our center can bring some important experiences and lessons. On January 14, 2020, the center found the first HD patient infected with COVID-19. This patient had fever symptoms at that time, and the chest CT showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass like changes. The staff of the center isolated and distributed the patient with vigilance. On January 17, a second case of infection was found, and isolation and distribution measures were also taken.\n\nUntil January 21, Hubei provincial government launched the secondary emergency response to public health emergencies, and the center immediately upgraded the level of prevention and protection. However, staff and patients were still infected on February 4. In that situation, the center began to carry out general screening of patients and staff, and the screening item was chest CT. The reason why the nucleic acid of pharyngeal swab virus was not adopted was that, on the one hand, the detection resources were limited, and on the other hand, the reported positive rate of nucleic acid detection was not high. Because HD patients come to the center for dialysis treatment at intervals, and during the epidemic period, many patients are worried about being infected, reducing the number of dialysis times and prolonging the dialysis interval, resulting in the screening work of more than 230 patients being completed until February 13. However, the confirmed infected case during the screening were all isolated and distributed. As can be seen from the figure 1, the vast .

Recapitulate of the COVID-19 epidemic in our center imply that, although SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, it can still get control through strict and standardized protective measures, as well as timely patient screening based on chest CT result, and followed patient distribution and isolation.\n\nDuring the outbreak of COVID-19 in our center, 7 episode of death were recorded, with a mortality of 3%, which is far higher than that of the same period in history. The high mortality is obviously related to the epidemic situation. However, it was found that no one patient died of pneumonia directly after tracing the causes of death of 7 patients. The main causes of death were cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications or hyperkalemia, which was presumed due to the reduction of dialysis times for fear of contracting the virus. It should be noted that although HD patients are highly susceptible to COVID-19, the infection for them is likely less severe or fatal. Actually, none of the 37 infected patients in our center has been admitted to ICU due to severe pneumonia. Some infected patients even have no obvious clinical symptoms. These suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic emerging, measures of prevention and protection certainly should be taken to avoid infection, but the sufficient dialysis remains the key issue for patients to survive the epidemic.\n\nDuring the outbreak of SARS in 2003, it was observed that the severity and mortality of HD patients infected with SARS-CoV were similar to other infected population, but the duration of shedding virus through stool or breath was significantly longer than other patients [18] . Considering the high biological similarity between therefore tested the frequency of immune cells in the PBMCs of patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and the level of cytokines in the body of patients. The results showed that compared with the general population, the T cells, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells was reduced remarkably in PBMCs of HD patients, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the serum level of serial cytokines of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected HD patients remain relatively lower in comparison with non-HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This indicates that the impaired immune system seems to be unable to mount effective cellular immune response upon the invasion of SARS-CoV-2, thus results in no cytokine storm and no severe organs damage. In the current clinical guidelines and practice for COVID-19 therapy, glucocorticoids are regularly recommended and usually prescribed, for the purpose of inhibiting the overactive immune response and reducing the cytokine storm [6, 11] . However, with regard to the management of COVID-19 in HD patients, we suggest the administration of glucocorticoids should be prudent since the immune system in HD patients have already been suppressed [19] [20] [21] . .
