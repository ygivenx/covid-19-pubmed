{"title": "Gene regulation: translational initiation by internal ribosome binding", "body": "Translation initiation of most mammalian mRNAs is initiated by a 'scanning mechanism' [ 11. In this mechanism, the 43s ternary complex, composed of the 40s ribosomal subunit carrying the initiator tRNA as well as a set of eukaryotic initiation factors [2,3], binds at the 5' end of capped cellular mRNAs and moves linearly, scanning the primary sequence of the mRNA, until an AUG codon in the context of a PuNNAUGPu (where Pu indicates A or G, and N any nucleotide) consensus motif is encountered. Subsequently, the 60s ribosomal subunit joins the complex and protein synthesis commences [ 1,3].\n\nWhile the scanning mechanism can easily accommodate translational initiation on most known mammalian mRNAs, the efficient translation of certain mRNAs containing long 5' non-coding regions (5' NC%) burdened with numerous AUGs and embedded in consensus motifs, is not easy to envisage [4] . Most notably, mRNAs of picomaviruses contain 5' NCRs that lack a 5' m7GpppG cap, are 600 to 1200 nucleotides in length and harbor many AUG codons [ 51. In addition, picornavims infection results in the specific inhibition of host cell translation [6] . This observation indicated that viral mRNA translation must be initiated by a mechanism that is different from the cap-dependent scanning mechanism used by cellular mRNAs. Indeed, in 1988, Pelletier and Sonenberg [7] , and Jang et al. [8] showed that the mRNAs of two picomaviruses, poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus, are translated by the unusual mechanism of internal ribosome binding. Specifically, they showed that internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences could be used to create functional dicistronic transcripts [7, 8] . This was the first indication that eukaryotic ribosomes can in principle utilize an initiation mechanism resem-bling the internal initiation mechanism used in prokaryotes.\n\nOver the past year, other viral as well as cellular mRNAs were shown fo harbor IRES elements that can be used for internal initiation of translation. This review details studies that seek to answer how widely IRES elements are used, and what the molecular mechanism of internal ribosome binding is. conditions in which cap-dependent translation was inhibited [7,10,11**]; secondly, that direct transfection of uncapped dicistronic RNA into tissue culture cells resulted in the translation of the second but not the first cistron [11**,12] (C Wang, P Samow and A Siddiqui, unpublished data); and thirdly, that translation of the first cistron in dicistronic mRN& was inhibited by an analog of the m7GpppG cap without affecting the translational efficiency of the second cistron [ 131.\n\nDemonstrating that translation of the second cistron of a dicistronic mRNA does not result from the generation of monocistronic transcripts, produced by nucleases, is a more difficult problem. It has been argued that dicistronic mRNAs are not conclusive tools to identify IRES elements because one can not be certain that the dicistronic transcript is the only transcript produced [ 141. One can, of course, never conclusively demonstrate a zero concentration of smaller, uncapped transcripts present in cells that mediate translation of the second cistron. However, it is striking that small deletions in IRES elements have been shown to abolish translation of the second cistron in a dicistronic mRNA without inducing a detectable increase in cleavage of the dicistronic mRNA [8,15,16\"].\n\nA further argument against the use of dicistronic RN4.s to demonstrate IRES function was that IRES elements, which one could imagine to be position-independent, function with different efficiencies depending on their location in the RNA [ 141. This is not really surprising; it is expected that the functional highly structured IRES elements [ 17,181 may be affected by long-range term tiary interactions between the IRES and other parts of a long RNA molecule. This may explain the deleterious effect on IRES function of certain small mutations located outside the IRES element [ 15, 19, 20] . Furthermore, ongoing translation of the first cistron in dicistronic mRNAs may affect the structure of the IRES in a dicistronic context, and thus result in altered translational efficiency of the second cistron. Such From this, and experiments in which additional AUGs were added between the IRES and the initiator AUG, it was concluded that ribosomal subunits bind to the IRES and subsequently scan in a 5' to 3' direction until the next AUG codon is encountered. There is little similar@ between the polioviral/rhinoviral IRESs and those found in the EMC or FMD viruses. It has been found that the EMC and FMD viral IRESs are both located at the initiator AUG codon, suggesting that the ribosomal subunits are recruited directly to the initiator AUG codons in these viruses [ 270,281.\n\nAn essential feature of the picornaviral IRES element is the presence of a conserved oligopyrimidine sequence located upstream of an AUG codon [29*-31**].\n\nMutations in the oligopyrimidine sequence abolish IRES function, and the proper spacing between the oligopy rimidine sequence and the AUG codon is also important for the maintenance of a functional IRES [29**-31\u00b0a]. Because part of the oligopyrimidine sequence reveals complementarity to the 3' end of ribosomal 18s RNA, it has been suggested that this sequence may function in a manner similar to the Shine-Dalgamo sequence [15,31**]. However, it has not been reported whether the oligopyrimidine-AUG sequence motif can function as an IRES on its own, as predicted by this model.\n\nMuch work has been devoted to the identification of viral and cellular proteins that mediate ribosome entry to viral IRES elements [ 32,33*,34**]. In particular, two cellular proteins, p52 [35] and p57 [30**, 36, 37] , have been identified by their ability to be crosslinked by ultraviolet light to multiple sites in viral IRES elements. Further functional assays are needed to reveal the role of these proteins in internal initiation. In addition, poliovirus encodes a transactivator protein, 2A, that can stimulate IRES usage [38=*]. More recently, the eukatyotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F has been shown to stimulate translation of the second cistron in a dicistronic mRNA [ 39**,40*]. This finding is intriguing, because eIF-4F, also known as the cap-binding protein complex [2,3], is also involved in cap-dependent translational initiation. Furthermore, there seems to be competition for eIF-4F between the cap-dependent and the cap-independent (by internal ribosome binding) initiation pathways [39**]. It is possible that one of the reasons that poliovirus encodes a function that modifies eIF-4F by proteolytically cleaving the ~220 component of eIF-4F [41] is to alter eIF-4F to enable the viral RNA to compete for it more efftciently. The proteolyzed form of eIF-4F is known to moderately stimulate internal initiation and inhibit cap-dependent translation in vitro [42] . In contrast, EMC virus does not induce the cleavage of the ~220 component of eIF-4F and, therefore, may compete more efficiently with cellular mRNAs for eIF-4F. Two recent reports have described the presence of IRES elements in viruses outside the Picornaviridae family. First, hepatitis C virus (HCV), tentatively assigned to be a flavivirus, contains a 5' NCR whose sequence and predicted secondary structure are more similar to picor-naviral5' NCRs than to the 5' NCRs of RNAs from other Gene expression and differentiation Aaviviwes. Both the poliovirus and the HCV genome contain long 5' NCRs with several AUG triplets, some preceded by oligopyrimidine sequences.\"IXvo studies reported that the 5' NCR of HCV, when placed into the intercistronic spacer of a dicistronic mRN& promoted internal initiation as efficiently as the EMC virus IRES in in vitro translation systems (43.1 (C Wang, P Samow and A Siddiqui, unpublished data). A third study did not find evidence that the HCV 5' NCR could function as an IRES 144.1. In this last study, additional non-viral sequences were present between the HCV 5' NCR and the initiator AUG triplet; thes,e extra sequences could have changed structures in the RNA resulting in an abrogation of a functional IRES (C Wang, unpublished data). An IRES was also discovered in mRNA3 of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus [45**]. The capped mRNA3 is functionally tricistronic encoding 3a, 3b and 3c proteins [45**]. It was argued that 3a is likely to be produced by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism, 3b by a leaky scanning mechanism, in which the 3a initiator AUG is bypassed, and 3c by internal ribosome entry [45**]. The IRES thought to mediate translation of 3c is located within the 3a and 3b coding sequences; the first example of an IRES located within a coding region. It will be very interesting to study the effects of ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of 3a or 3b on IRES usage for 3c translation.\n\nBecause internal initiation mediated by picornaviral IRES is efficient in uninfected cells [46, 47] , it was clear that the host cell translation apparatus was able to perform this function without the help of viral gene products. This led to the idea that cellular mRNAs, that could escape the inhibition of cap-dependent translation in poliovirusinfected cells [ 481, may contain functional IRES elements. In fact, it was found that the 5' NCR of the mRNA encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, whose translation continues in poliovirus-infected cells [48], could be translated by internal initiation [lo].\n\nA second example of a cellular IRES came from the examination of the mRNA of the murine androgen receptor. Mice bearing the testicular feminization (Tfm) mutation in this gene display altered androgen responsiveness [49] . Curiously, the TJin androgen-receptor mRNA contains a single-nucleotide deletion in the coding region, resulting in short-lived mRNA that produces carboxyl-terminal androgen-receptor peptides by internal ribosome binding [ 491.\n\nIn a search for additional cellular IRES elements, it was noted that 42% of known Drosophila genes contain one or more AUG triplets in their 5' NCRs [50] . The average length of a Drasophih gene 5' NCR is 250 nucleotides 1501, five times longer than the average mammalian gene 5' NCR [51]. One striking example of such a Drosophila gene is the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) whose 5' NCR is either 1512 or 1727 nucleotides in length, depending on whether transcription was initiated from the PI or P2 promoter [ 52,531. A 252 nucleotide sequence element in exon D, common to mR-NAs from both transcription units, was found to contain an IRES element [ 1 l**]. Moreover, within this IRES is a 55 nucleotide sequence element that is highly conserved among different Drosophila species [54] . When placed into the intercistronic region of a dicistronic mRNA, the 55 nucleotide sequence alone functioned as an IRES in cultured Drosophila cells (S-K OH and P Sarnow, unpublished data). The function and potential regulation of the Antp IRES in Drosophila is currently being explored.\n\nOver the past year IRES elements have been discovered in mRNAs from viruses outside the Picornatk-lake, such as the HCV and coronaviruses, and in cellular mRNAs, such as the homeotic Antp mRNA. Novel experimental systems involving dicistronic polioviruses and circular RNAs will serve as useful genetic and biochemical tools to elucidate the mechanism of internal ribosome binding. In addition, the fruitfly Drosophila may be the choice for genetic approaches to identib key players in internal initiation and to study their regulation during cell growth.\n\nThe surprising finding that the coding region of mRNA3 of coronavirus can harbor an IRES element demonstrates that eukaryotic mRNAs can be functionally polycistronic, opening the possibility of controlling translational initiation within the coding region as well as at the 5' end of mRNAs. IRES elements within coding regions may provide an interesting way to control gene expression at the cotranslational level. Interactions of proteins with two of thece SfNCNres were investigated in this work. Interestingly, these RNA-protein interactions are conserved among certain picomavicuses, implying that this consenztion has functional significance.\n\nTSUKNUMA-Ko~ K, IIZIJKA N, KOH~RA M, NOMOTO A: Inter-.\n\nnal Ribosome Entry Site Within Hepatitis C Viis RNA.
