{"title": "Health is global: proposals for a UK Government-wide strategy", "body": "Globalisation can bring benefi ts for human health: via improved trade, sharing of medical research, and the pooling of fi nancial, technical, and intellectual resources for solving shared health problems. Globalisation can also pose risks to human health-for example, through unfair trade and its regulation, inequitable distribution of natural resources, and poorly managed migration. The key issue for policymakers is how these benefi ts can be harnessed while minimising the potential for harm. The Whitehall Permanent Secretaries regularly discuss how the UK government best responds to globalisation. The group promulgates UK action to maximise the opportunities of globalisation in areas such as development, climate change, energy security, trade and industry, science and innovation, education, and global health.\n\nThe US Institute of Medicine, in a 1997 report, 4 made a strong case for why that country would benefi t from investing in health abroad. The report identifi ed three pillars: protecting people, enhancing the economy, and advancing international interests. In 1999, the then director general of WHO, Gro Harlem Brundtland, reminded the international community that investing in global health was good politics, good economics, and good for national and international security. 5 A Lancet Editorial recently described the advantages of using health as an instrument of foreign policy, 6 such as protecting nations against health threats, social cohesion, strengthened national infra structure, improving bilateral relations, and encouraging trust across global multilateral agencies. Five key reasons exist for why the UK Government should do more than it does at present to prom ulgate global health. Engagement with the global health agenda can improve global security and health protection, enhance sustainable development, improve trade by promoting health as a commodity, maximise potential of global public goods, and encourage a human rights approach to health. Potential confl icts exist between them. For example, reconciling UK trade interests (includ ing trade in health commodities) with sound pro-poor development policy and maintenance of international human rights might be diffi cult. Also, global health should not be seen solely in security terms. That would create a security triage in which health issues that rep resent security threats are given automatic priority over others. Another potential area of diffi culty is where the military is associated with peacekeeping and service deliv ery. Local populations can be unclear on mandates and non-governmental organisations might have con cerns about erosion of humanitarian space. 7 A coherent UK glo bal-health strategy is important in navigating an econom ically and ethically acceptable path through these fi ve areas.\n\nThe eff ect of confl ict on health is well known. 8 Confl ict causes death and morbidity from physical injuries, but also results in large population movements, mental illness, malnutrition, and outbreaks of communicable diseases. Improvement of global health and health care helps guard against states failing. Failed states, poor human development, and absence of basic services breed instability, poverty, and inequalities-the sort of environment that can encourage confl ict, but also terrorism and illegal traffi cking of tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and people. Global security also means food security and includes food safety and continuity of food supply.\n\nNowadays, improving human security includes tackling communicable diseases. The UK Government Offi ce of Science and Innovation's Foresight Project drew attention to the threat of new infectious agents and their potential for epidemic spread. 9 It identifi ed the need to strengthen the response to this threat by integrating new and eff ective public-health control measures within local cultural and governance systems. An infl uenza pandemic is an obvious example of a global-security threat. HIV and AIDS are inextricably linked with national and global security. AIDS is crippling economies and also compro mising the governance, state stability, and military capacities of many African countries. 10 In view of South Africa's international tourism boom and global trade and transport systems, recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is another example of disease with a global threat. 11 Migration brings economic and social benefi ts. Although many migrants are healthy, some have complex, specifi c health needs (eg, mental health, communicable disease). 12 People developing communicable disease control policies, such as pre-embarkation screening for tuberculosis and HIV, should do so on the basis of sound public-health evidence.\n\nThree of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) relate directly to health, but health is also an important contributor to several of the other goals. 13 The WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health showed that investing in health makes sound economic sense. 14 Countries with poor health are less likely than those with good health to achieve sustained economic growth and contribute to the global economy. The commission estimated that in developing countries, a basic health-care package of US$34 per person would save 8 million lives a year, which would generate economic benefi ts of $360 billion. Tactically sound action across government could encourage African countries to implement the Commission for Africa's recommendation that they spend 15% of their national income on health and that resources are used to support health interventions that are proven to be most cost eff ective. 15, 16 The macroeconomic eff ects of the HIV pandemic are substantial. 17, 18 In eastern Europe, 80% of people infected with HIV are of working age. Malaria is slowing African economic growth by up to 1\u00b73% a year, costing more than $12 billion yearly. Controlling endemic malaria in Africa will raise its gross domestic product by 20% over 15 years. Tobacco use results in a yearly global net loss of $200 billion. The $300 million investment in global smallpox eradication returned more than $3 billion in economic benefi ts. 19 Improvements in health might have contributed to as much as a third of the east Asian economic miracle. 20\n\nHealth services, research, drugs, and medical devices are commodities that contribute to the global and UK economies. Worldwide, the health-care industry is worth more than US$3 trillion yearly. 21 The estimated value of healthcare products and services exported from the UK in 2005 was \u00a314 billion. Pharmaceutical industry exports are estimated at \u00a312\u00b72 billion, creating a trade surplus of \u00a33\u00b74 billion. The UK's medical device market is the fourth largest in Europe, with an estimated value of \u00a34 billion. Globally, the industry is an attractive target for abuse. According to Transparency International the medi cal sector is seen as being more corrupt than the military sector. 22 Enhancing the eff ect of industry on global health requires greater focus on access for the poorest people in the world than exists at present. Increasing the number of public-private partnerships that include commercial drug and biotechnology companies is one way to do this. A second approach is fairer regulation of international trade. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement is designed to protect the rights of patent holders over knowledge systems or products including, for example, drugs. In 2003, World Trade Organisation (WTO) members agreed that developing countries with insuffi cient manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector could make eff ective use of the compulsory licensing provisions contained in the TRIPs agreement, which was amended in 2005. These changes are designed to make it easier for poor countries to import cheaper generic medicines if they are unable to manufacture them. Developed countries have an obligation to help poor countries make the most of these fl exibilities with the aid for trade approach. 23 The General Agreement on Trade in Services is the fi rst multilateral trade agreement to cover trade and investment in services. It constitutes the legal framework through which WTO members progres-sively liberalise trade in services, including, where members wish, health-related services. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, a UN Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO body, sets standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations for food quality and safety to protect consumers from food-borne illness from home-grown and imported food and ensure fair trade practices in the food trade.\n\nPublic goods are goods that benefi t society as a whole. In an increasingly interdependent world, more attention than ever before is being paid to global public goods. These address issues in which the international community has a common interest, although some might be especially important to certain countries. Public-health interventions, such as eff ective therapy for a disease, epidemic control, or dissemination of research, are global public goods that address problems irrespective of national borders. The UK's contribution to the polio-eradication initiative or the containment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 are examples of its contribution to global-public health goods-shared protection of health worldwide.\n\nThe UK Government global-health strategy can look at how to build on existing global public goods, including the work that the International Task Force on Global Public Goods has been doing on infectious diseases, climate change, and ensuring that the public good benefi ts of, for example, the uptake of new vaccines are distributed as widely as possible. 24\n\nExamples of international human rights instruments that are binding on the UK include the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, and Convention on the Rights of the Child. In 2002, the UN Commission on Human Rights created a Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which reports on a yearly basis. 25 Achieving a balance between respecting the rights of the individual and the population is crucial. Compulsory as opposed to voluntary vaccination, and whether involuntary detention should be used to contain extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, are examples of some of the diffi cult judgments to be made. 26\n\nThe UK Government has much to build on. The growth of an international social movement that recognises health as a shared global value that comes from vibrant non-governmental organisations and academic institutions has been important. The UK has been at the forefront of multilateral initiatives, such as cancelling debt from poor countries, increasing access to medicines, and establishing global initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations, the World Alliance for Patient Safety, and the WHO Commission for Social Determinants. The UK Government Department for International Develop ment is seen by many development specialists as one of the most eff ective bilateral development agencies. Frame works and initiatives across the UK Government have the potential to improve global health (webtable).\n\nThe 2005 UK presidency of the Group of 8 wealthiest nations (G8) drew attention to global health, climate change, investment in health systems, and partnerships with governments of developing countries. The UK Prime Minister's Commission for Africa gives the UK a leading role to end poverty and tackle health inequality in Africa, tackle HIV/AIDS, and meet the 2015 MDG targets. These and other frameworks reinforce the importance of a multisector approach to achieving health outcomes. European Union engagement provides opportunities to drive the global-health agenda forward.\n\nThe UK Government's support to the UN and other global-health agencies and partnerships places it in a strong position to encourage the UN and others towards reform-eg, implementation of the recommendations of the High-Level Panel on System-Wide Coherence. 27 WHO's International Health Regulations show how concerted global action can provide the framework for national measures to address a health threat. 28 The UK has worked with others to implement these in a way that avoids unnecessary interference with international traffi c and trade. After Sept 11, 2001 , the G7 countries, European Commission, and Mexico established the Global Health Security Initiative with WHO as a technical adviser. This initiative is an informal, international partnership of like-minded countries to strengthen health preparedness and response globally to threats of biological, chemical, and radio-nuclear terrorism and pandemic infl uenza. 29\n\n\u2022 Global-health risks that threaten health of UK population (eg, communicable diseases (such as HIV, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pandemic infl uenza) and food-borne disease, bioterrorism, and climate change) \u2022 Global-health solutions in which UK has particular expertise (eg, global-disease surveillance, workforce planning, standards and training) \u2022 Global-health opportunities that benefi t UK (eg, sharing knowledge and learning lessons from other countries, improving UK health and health services) \u2022 Global-health problems that UK action can help solve (eg, our work on an ethical code for international recruitment of health-care professionals or work to support UN reform) \u2022 Achievable but challenging goals can be set \u2022 Specifi c, measurable, and time-bound outcomes possible \u2022 Cuts across several Government departments, particularly when one department leads but is frustrated by insuffi cient engagement of others See Online for webtable\n\nThe UK has several internationally respected nongovernmental agencies and academic institutions as well as the NHS and specialist agencies (eg, Health Protection Agency and National Centre for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE]) that can help central Government develop and implement global health policy. The UK is also a global leader in the biotechnology sector, which is the largest in Europe and second only to the USA. The central government Department of Trade and Industry and UK Trade and Investment are important in identifying new international markets and attracting foreign investment.\n\nThe global-health strategy could have a number of functions. First, it could give additional legitimacy for individual government departments and non-governmental agencies to invest in and take action on global health. Second, it could be an accountability mechanism for govern ment delivery on existing frameworks that aff ect global health. Third, it could help to prioritise areas for action. A global-health strategy provides the opportunity for individual Government departments and agencies to ask themselves whether their engagement in global health is suffi cient. For example, many of the central government Department of Health's objectives and targets under its Pub lic Service Agreement (reducing adult smoking rates and halting the rise in obesity in children younger than 11 years) have a global dimension and require global engagement.\n\nIn the wake of the Stern Review, 30 Stott and Godlee challenged citizens and governments to take eff ective action in responding to the challenge of climate change, 31 an area in which a Government department such as the Department of Health can show leadership.\n\nIn 2002, the UK Government published a strategy for combating infectious diseases, 32 which made clear that the prevention and control of infectious disease in England must be set in a global context. The separation of domestic and international health problems is less relevant than it used to be as people and goods travel across continents. The strategy also widened the traditional infectious-disease control functions to encompass health protection-including combating chemical, environmental, and radiation hazards. The value of this approach was shown in the response to the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian intelligence offi cer, with polonium. 33 WHO, for example, often struggles to get professionals working in the UK health system released to work on global health priorities. In February, 2007, the ex-Chief Executive of the NHS, Lord Crisp, published a report commissioned by the Prime Minister on how the UK and the NHS can do more to strengthen the health capacity of developing countries. This report provides an opportunity for UK development partners to think about engaging more strategically in this area. 34 Independent of the priorities that arise from the global-health strategy, Government departments can work together more eff ectively. The UK Government should speak with a clear and unifi ed voice on the role and mandate of WHO and other multilateral agencies with an interest in health. Many of the Government's health targets need international solutions that can only be tackled through the input of a number of domestic Government departments. The human-rights agreements to which the UK Government has signed up encompass availability of health care, health promotion and protection, safe water, adequate sanitation, and occupational and environmental conditions conducive to good health.\n\nHealth is global: proposals for a UK Government-wide strategy 35 makes the case and provides a framework for the development of a global-health strategy. The document creates the opportunity for a wide discussion on what the current global-health priorities are, what the UK should focus on, and what the global-health strategy should include. During the fi rst part of 2007 a UK Government-wide steering group will lead the collaborative process of developing the strategy. This group will consult widely-both within Government and with the non-governmental sector, the professions, industry, academia, and partners abroad. In moving from these proposals to a full strategy, cri teria will need to be agreed the steering group after consul tation that determine what the priorities should be (panel 1) and several questions must be addressed (panel 2).\n\nThe range of international resources (both fi nancial and services in kind) needed for global health, what is currently available from Governmental and other organisations, and how they are spent, must be better understood. Although estimates exist for amounts of development assistance that countries, such as those in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, should aspire to, much less information is available about the right amount to invest in other aspects of global health. The strategy provides the opportunity to bring together the UK's foreign, international development, and trade and investment policies that aff ect global health. The outcome should be a strategy that is challenging and achievable, that will improve health and wellbeing in the UK and elsewhere, and that allows Government to be held to account."}
