{"title": "Researchin Veterinary Science", "body": "A porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was inoculated by aerosol into nine hysterectomy-derived and colostrum-deprived pigs at the age of one week. They were killed at different times after inoculation and tissues were sampled for virus isolation and immunofluorescence. Results indicate that virus replicated to high titres in the respiratory tract. Replication mainly occurred in alveolar cells but also in epithelial cells of nasal mucosa, trachea, bronchi, bronchioli, in alveolar macrophages and in tonsils. After primary replication in the respiratory tract, viraemia occurred. Virus also reached the gastrointestinal tract after swallowing. Subsequently, PRCV was observed to replicate in the ileum. The inflftion spread within a few days from the ileum to the duodenum. Replication in the small intestine remained limited to a few cells located in or underneath the epitheliallayer of villiand, or, crypts. The cell type could not be identified. Virus was isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes in all pigs, but immunofluorescence was not observed. Results show that small changes in molecular structure between transmissible gastroenteritis virus and PRCV resulted in important changes in host cell tropism.\n\nTRANSMISSIBLE gastroenteritis (TGE) is a viral disease characterised by watery diarrhoea in swine and caused by a coronavirus called transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEY) . TGEY was first isolated by Doyle and Hutchings (1946) . It was long known as a prototype enteropathogenic virus. It replicates in the cytoplasm of the absorptive epithelial cellson the villi of the small intestine. Virus replication in these cells induces cellular degeneration and villous shortening leading to diarrhoea in swine of all ages. Mortality approaches 90 to 100 per cent in pigs infected during the first week of life (Hooper and Haelterman 1966 , 1969 , Pensaert et al 1970 . TGEY isolates have been reported to have a tropism not only for the intestinal tract but also for the respiratory tract, without causing respiratory disorders (Kemeny et al 1975) . Furuuchi et al (1979) showed that TGEY strains lose their enterotropism but can gain tropism for respiratory tract tissue by serial passaging in cell cultures.\n\nThe appearance of a porcine coronavirus related to TGEY was observed in 1984in the swine population in Belgium (Pensaert et al 1986) . This virus has, since then, become widespread in several European countries (Brown and Cartwright 1986 , Jestin et al 1987 , van Nieuwstadt and Pol 1989 . It replicates in the respiratory tract and is transmitted aerogenically. Although respiratory distress has been reported upon infection with this porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCY), it usually causes a subclinical infection. Infection with this virus does not cause diarrhoea (Pensaert et al 1986 , Jestin et al 1987 , Duret et al 1988 .\n\nRecently, the antigenic relationship between the Belgian isolate of PRCY, designated TLM83, and the classical TGEY has been studied (Callebaut et aI1988) . Both viruses show a complete cross neutralisation activity and possess common antigenic determinants on each of their structural proteins. Nevertheless, distinct antigenic differences have been demonstrated between both~ruses with the use of monoclonal antibodies. Non-neutralising monoclonal antibodies directed against E2 protein epitopes of TGEY do not recognise PRCY. This indicates that these epitopes of the E2 protein of TGEY are modified or absent in PRCY. Since PRCV and TGEY are antigenically closely related, PRCY can be regarded as a TGEY variant.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to find out in what tissues and cells PRCY replicates and to det'ermine the sequence of events of PRCY infection in pigs particularly in comparison with those known to occur with TGEY.\n\nThe TLM83 isolate of PRCY was used in this study (Pensaert et al 1986) . The stock for experimental infection represented the first passage in swine testicle cells (McClurkin and Norman 1966) . It was derived from a 20 per cent suspension of lung tissue from an experimentally inoculated piglet. The infectivity titre of this stock was 10 6 ' 7 tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) ml-I \u2022\n\nThe present study was performed in nine hysterectomy-derived colostrum-deprived pigs which were individually housed in Horsfall-type isolation units. They were inoculated by aerosol with 107-0 TCID50 TLM83 in 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at six days old. The virus suspension was nebulised with the 'Wright' nebuliser (particle size <8 j,lm) (Aerosol Products) for 40 minutes with each pig individually.\n\nSix pigs were inoculated in a first experiment (group 1). They were observed daily for clinical signs. One piglet a day was killed on days 1,2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 after inoculation. A blood sample was collected at the time of euthanasia and processed as further described. Immediately after bleeding the pigs, the following tissues were collected for viral isolation and immunofluorescence: stomach; small intestine; colon; rectum; spleen; liver; kidney; thymus; lymph nodes (mesenteric, bronchial, inguinal, cervical, mandibular and parotid); tonsils; respiratory and olfactory nasal mucosa; trachea and lungs (apical, cardial and diaphragmatic lobes). The small intestine was divided into seven segments, equal in length, pesignated duodenum, jejunum 1 to 5 and ileum. A piece approximately 1, 5 em long was collected for immunofluorescence. Virus isolation 'was performed on the remaining parts. Small intestinal, caecal and rectal contents were also collected for virus isolation.\n\nIn a second experiment, three pigs were inoculated by aerosol and one killed on each of days 1, 2 and 3 after inoculation (group 2). A post mortem lung washing was performed in these pigs. Furthermore, lung lobes, trachea, tonsils and the same small intestinal segments as described above were collected for immunofluorescence.\n\nBlood was collected in heparin from a jugular vein. White blood cells were isolated by sedimentation on dextran, followed by lysis of erythrocytes in ammonium chloride (Gutekunst 1979) . After centrifugation (10 minutes at 300 g) sedimented cells were resuspended in PBS and smears were made of the white blood cells for examination by immunofluorescence. Cells and plasma were separately investigated by viral isolation.\n\nFor lung washing, 50 ml of PBS containing 50 per cent (v/v) Alsever's solution was injected post mortem through a polyethylene catheter placed in the left bronchus. The fluid was immediately aspirated, whereafter the cells were sedimented by centrifugation (10 minutes at 300g). Next, the erythrocytes were lysed with ammonium chloride. Sedimented cells were resuspended in 5 ml Eagle's minimum essential medium whereafter smears were prepared for immunofluorescence.\n\nAll samples collected for viral isolation were immediately frozen at -70\u00b0C and kept at this temperature until processed. Viral isolation was performed using 20 per cent suspensions (w/v) in PBS according to standard procedures. Supernatants from homogenates were inoculated into 10 tubes fully sheeted with swine testicle cells. Cells were observed for the occurrence of cytopathogenic effect for seven days. No second passage was made.\n\nTitrations of infectious virus in samples were performed by inoculating lO-fold dilutions of the supernatants into microtitre plates on swine testicle cells.\n\nTissue pieces collected for examination by immunofluorescence were mounted in a gelatin capsule with methocel (Fluka Chemie AO) and frozen in a liquid alcohol carbon dioxide ice bath. White blood cell smears, lung washing cell smears and frozen sections (8 j,lm) were fixed in acetone before staining with the direct immunofluorescent method. A hyperimmune serum against TOEV, conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used as conjugate following standard procedures. The specificity of fluorescence was determined by the fluorescence inhibition test.\n\n. A semiquantitative evaluation of immunofluorescence was made according to the number of fluorescing cells in each section: -= 0 per cent of the epithelial cells fluorescing; + =<5 per cent fluorescing; + + =6 to 25 per cent; + + + =26 to 50 per cent; + + + + =>50 per cent.\n\nSamples for histopathological studies were collected from the lunglobes of all nine pigs, fixed in 10 per cent phosphate buffered formalin and examined by standard histological techniques.\n\nNone of the pigs experienced respiratory distress or intestinal disorders.\n\nInoculation of the PRCV isolate on the swine testicle cultures induced the formation of typical syncytia between one and four days after inoculation.\n\nThe results of the viral isolations and titrations of tissues and samples from pigs of group 1are presented in Table 1 . As can be observed, virus was isolated from the nasal mucosa, trachea, lungs and tonsils in all six pigs. The highest titres were detected in lung tissue (up to lO s \"3 TCIDSO g-I lung tissue). Virus was also isolated from stomach and small intestine in all six pigs. Virus titres in stomach and duodenum were higher than, or in the same range as, titres in caudal small intestinal segments between one and four days after inoculation. Titres increased in small intestinal segments from one to five days after inoculation.\n\nVirus was isolated from colon in four out of six pigs. Virus tit res were generally lower than in ileum.\n\nVirus was isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes in all pigs. It was isolated inconsistently and at low titres from other lymphoid tissues and from liver.\n\nVirus was isolated from the plasma samples of pigs killed from two days after inoculation at titres up to 1()3 TCID50 g-I.\n\nResults of the immunofluorescence study are presented in Tables 2 and 3 for groups 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nViral antigens in the respiratory tract were detected in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa, trachea and in lung tissue.\n\nFluorescence in lungs was seen in epithelial cells of alveoli, bronchioli and bronchi. The percentage of fluorescent cells in all three epithelia increased from one to three days after inoculation. At this time, generally more than 50 per cent of the alveolar cells were fluorescing, whereas 20 per cent of positive cells were observed in some bronchi and bronchioli. The immunofluorescence in alveoli remained unchanged until day 5 after inoculation, after which it decreased. The immunofluorescence in bronchioli did not change after day 3, but the immunofluorescence in bronchi decreased. At five and six days after inoculation, few cells were still positive in some bronchi, whereas in others no immunofluorescence was seen any more.\n\nSpecific fluorescence was detected in O\u00b72 to 1. 6 per cent of cells of the lung washing fluids in all three pigs of group 2. These latter cells had the morphology of alveolar macrophages. Viral antigens in the tonsils were present in the cytoplasm of a few epithelial cells at the surface or the crypts. Weak fluorescing structures were also seen in the tonsillary lymphoid tissue between the crypts. These structures could not be identified.\n\nViral antigens could be detected in a few cells in the ileum starting on day 2 after inoculation in both experiments (Tables 2 and 3 ). At this time, fluorescent cells were scarce and were detected only after careful examination of s!veral sections. The fluorescent cells were generally located in, but sometimes also underneath, the enterocytes of villi and, or, crypts. The cell type could-not be identified. The infection in the small intestine gradually spread from caudal to cranial and on day 4 and 5 after inoculation all small intestinal segments were positive. The number of fluorescent epithelial cells per section increased to reach a .maximum of four cells in some ileal sections on day 4 post inoculation, whereafter it decreased again. Immunofluorescing cells could not be observed in the dome epithelium above the Peyer's patches or inside the Peyer's patches.\n\nImmunofluorescence was not detected in white blood cell smears, stomach, colon, lymph nodes, spleen and liver.\n\nPneumonia was observed in the lungs of seven of the nine inoculated pigs at necropsy. In three pigs killed two, three and three days after inoculation, only one or two small lobular lesions were observed. These lesions became more pronounced in apical and cardiac lobes of the pigs killed four and five days after .. Histological investigation of lung lesions revealed capillary congestion and a diffuse interstitial pneumonia in pigs killed one and two days after the experimental infection. This interstitial pneumonia became more severe three days after inoculation. Besides the pneumonia, an early focal degeneration could be observed in the alveolar interstitium in apical and cardiac lobes on days 4 and 5. These degenerative lesions were also seen in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium six days after inoculation. The bronchioli and bronchi were partially filled with cellular debris.\n\nIn earlier studies, preliminary viral isolation attempts were performed on organs or tissues of pigs killed after intranasal inoculation with 10 306 TCIDSO TLM83. Virus was consistently isolated from respiratory tract tissue and not from the intestine (Pensaert et al 1986) . The efficacy of the viral isolation technique has been improved since then. Swine testis cells inoculated when fully sheeted five days after seeding were found to be most valuable for obtaining optimal results in isolating small amounts of virus. No second cell culture passage was needed. The high sensitivity of the swine testis cell line may explain why in this study virus was isolated in high titres from respiratory tract tissue and even at low titres from the intestinal tract.\n\nThe results of previous studies which indicated that respiratory tract tissues served as primary sites of multiplication of PRCV in pigs, were confirmed by the present study (Pensaert et al 1986 , Duret et al 1988 . Production of large amounts of virus on the respiratory tract surface during several days supports the observation that virus is transmitted by the aerogenic route. This mode of transmission has resulted in a rapid spread of PRCV among the pig population in many countries in Europe. Virus was consistently isolated in high titres from nasal mucosa. This could indicate that diagnosis of PRCV might be made by isolating the virus from nasal swabs taken during infection.\n\nThe intestinal infection of TLM83 was totally different from those of the PRcv-related enteropathogenic coronaviruses TGEV (Pensaert et al 1970) , canine coronavirus (Keenan et al 1976) and feline enteric coronavirus (Pedersen et alI981) . After oral inoculation, these viruses pass through the stomach and infect the absorptive enterocytes in the cranial and, or, mid small intestine and subsequently cause a contiguous infection of villous enterocytes. Within a few days, most small intestinal villi become infected and diarrhoea occurs. In contrast, TLM83 infected only very few cells at villus or crypt sites in the small intestinal mucosa and spread from the ileum to the duodenum. These results show a striking modification in tropism of PRCV for the intestine itself. It is unlikely that virus is spreading from the ileum to the duodenum through the gut lumen in the opposite direction to peristalsis. Other routes, such as via lymph or blood probably playa role.\n\nIt was not clear from the results of this study how virus reached the ileum. Two possible routes may be postulated: either by ingestion of virus produced in the respiratory tract or by viraemia. Isolation of virus from the stomach in all pigs and from duodenum and jejunum in pigs killed at days 1 and 2 after inoculation in the absence of fluorescence indicated that infectious virus was swallowed and reached the cranial intestinal segments.\n\nThe consistent isolation of virus from the plasma of all pigs killed between two and six days after inoculation indicated that viraemia may play a role in the spread of TLM83 from the respiratory tract to the gut. That viraemia occurred was substantiated by the ability to isolate virus from lymph nodes and abdominal organs (liver and spleen) in some pigs in the absence of immunofluorescence in these tissues.\n\nIn conclusion, aerosol inoculation of pigs with the roev-related PRCV caused an infection of the respiratory tract followed by viraemia and ingestion of virus. Subsequently, replication of PRCV was observed in a few unidentified small intestinal cells. The small changes in molecular structure between TGEV and PRCV have caused important changes in host cell tropism."}
