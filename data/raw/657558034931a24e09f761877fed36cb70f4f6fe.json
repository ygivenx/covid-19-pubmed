{"title": "Epidemiology and vaccine of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China: a mini-review", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. PEDV infections can occur in pigs of all ages, and infections are most serious in piglets, with morbidity and mortality often reaching 100% [9, 40] . Pigs that tolerate PEDV infections usually exhibit growth retardation, reduced food conversion rates, increased feeding costs and the co-occurrence of other diseases. Furthermore, PEDV infections result in reduced pig slaughter rates, insufficient pork supplies and pork price instability, because of a large number of piglet deaths.\n\nPEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus Alphacoronavirus. In 1971, the first reported PED outbreak occurred in pig populations in England, and PEDV was confirmed to cause PED in 1978 [30] . Thus far, PED has been reported in swine-farming countries in Asia, Europe, North America [7, 17, 20, 29, 32] . In 1973, an acute diarrheal disease similar to swine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) was first reported in Shanghai, China; however, the causative agent of this disease was not confirmed to be PEDV until 1984 [41] . From 1984 to early 2010, PEDV infections occurred in the pig population in China, but there were no large-scale outbreaks [3, 6] . Starting from the end of 2010, PEDV outbreaks occurred in the Chinese pig population and caused enormous economic losses [1, 2, 4, 20, 22, 42] . Because of the severity of PED, extensive, in-depth studies of PEDV have been performed during the past five years in China.\n\nSince 1966, the occurrence of pig diarrheal disease has been recorded in China. The disease showed a local endemic tendency with significant seasonal variations, usually occurring from the end of October to early February, and PEDV was confirmed to be the cause of such outbreaks in 1984 [43] . After PEDV infections in the pig population were confirmed, a series of investigations of PED occurrence were conducted in China. Ji et al. (1987) reported that in farms with PEDV outbreaks, the PEDV incidence was 80% in sows, 100% in suckling pigs and 90% in fattening pigs [18] . Wang et al. (1989) reported that among cases of PED in 1989, the PEDV incidence was 95% in fattening pigs, 60.4% in sows, 78.95% in boars and 100% in suckling pigs (with a mortality rate of 87.9%) [39] . These data suggest that PEDV infections were present in the pig population in China during PED occurred in Europe. However, before 2010, PEDV infections were mostly sporadic or locally endemic, with no large-scale outbreaks in China.\n\nAfter the PEDV outbreaks in 2010, detailed studies of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of PEDV were conducted in China, which led to the accumulation of a large amount of data (Table 1) . From February 2011 to March 2014, a long-term investigation showed that PEDV was circulating in 29 provinces in China, excluding Tibet and Hainan (Fig. 1A) ; the positive rates of samples varied from 61.10% to 78.49%, and the positive rates of pig farms varied from 71.43% to 83.47% (Fig. 1B) [10, 45] . The positive rates of PEDV in samples or farms were significantly [20] higher compared with earlier PEDV outbreaks in China and other countries. In addition to the PEDV, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine kobuvirus, porcine bocavirus, porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus, Lawsonia intracellularis and porcine deltacoronavirus have also been found in diarrhea samples from pigs [10, 12, 44] . These data demonstrated that PED occurred extensively among the pig population in China and that PEDV was the major cause of viral diarrheal diseases in swine during the recent outbreaks. However, co-infections of other intestinal pathogens with PEDV should also be monitored dynamically in future studies in China. The S1 regions of the spike (S) protein-encoding gene of 99 selected PEDV strains were divided into two groups (GI and GII) in a phylogenetic tree. The GI group consists of two subgroups (GIa and GIb), while the GII group also consists of two subgroups (GIIa and GIIb) (Fig. 2 ). Ten Chinese PEDV strains isolated from 2004 to 2015, which exhibited Several reports indicated that for PEDV field strains, the neutralizing epitopes of the major antigenic protein, the S protein, showed high conservation and were highly similar to that of the vaccine strain CV777 [2, 15, 33] . These data suggest that in China, the traditional PEDV vaccine strain (CV777) still could prevent infections by PEDV field strains and provide effective cross-protection. However, the protective effect of the PEDV vaccine needs to be dynamically monitored in future due to the increasing trend of PEDV variants in China.\n\nRecombination of the S gene of coronaviruses has been frequently reported [24, 31] . The PEDV S protein binds to a host cell receptor and triggers fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. It is likely that PEDV variants will continue to emerge, because of naturally occurring recombination events and mutations in the S gene. To identify possible recombination events within the S gene of PEDV, the S1 regions of 65 selected S genes from Chinese PEDV strains isolated from 2004 to 2015 (see Fig. 2 ) were screened using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP), GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, 3Seq, PhylPro, LARD and SISscan methods embedded in RDP4. The recombination analysis revealed that four potential recombination events occurred between the 65 PEDV strains from China (Table 2) , and confirmation of the four potential recombination events was carried out by bootscan analysis and fast neighbor-joining trees, respectively (Fig. 3) . Of the four potential recombination events, one potential recombinant event occurred between a GI group strain and a GII group strain, and three potential recombinant events occurred within GI group strains. Most of the GI group Chinese strains consisted of PEDV strains that emerged from 2011 to 2015. The limited data demonstrated that recently emerging PEDV strains in China exhibited high variability and potential recombination of the S gene. In summary, although the evidence of naturally occurring recombination events is limited, possible recombination events between the S genes of Chinese PEDV strains should be monitored by extensive molecular epidemiology investigations in the future.\n\nConventional vaccine: Wang et al. reported that a tissueinactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using PEDV strain S [38] . Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the active immunization protection rate of the prepared PEDV tissueinactivated vaccine in three-day-old piglets was 77.28%, and the passive immunization protection rate was 97.06%, while the immunization protection period was six months. Improving the tissue-inactivated PEDV vaccine involves a complicated preparation process, high production cost, high time requirement and quality control problems. Ma et al. adapted PEDV strain CV777 to Vero cells and successfully performed continuous passages by adding trypsin to the culture medium [27] . An inactivated PEDV vaccine was prepared using the cultures of 28th passage viruses [27] . Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the active immunization protection rate in piglets was 85.19%, and the passive immunization protection rate was 85.0%. However, inactivated PEDV vaccines still exhibited some limitations, including the need for high immunization doses and multiple booster immunizations, as well as short immunity durations. Tong et al. reported that an attenuated PEDV vaccine strain (a 90th generation cloned virus strain) was successfully prepared by serial passage in vitro [36] . Through Houhai acupoint immunization, the attenuated PEDV vaccine had a 95.52% active immunization protection rate and a 96.2% passive immunization protection rate in three-to six-day-old piglets.\n\nOn the basis of inactivated PEDV cell cultures, Ma et al. prepared an inactivated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine [26] . Tong et al. prepared an attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine based on the attenuated PEDV vaccine [37] . The inactivated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (1999 to present) and the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) are extensively used in the Chinese pig population, and they play important roles in the control of TGEV and PEDV infections. After the outbreak of PED at the end of 2010, there was a renewed demand for live vaccines that could effectively prevent viral diarrhea diseases of swine. Based on the attenuated, bivalent TGEV and PEDV vaccine, Feng et al. prepared a trivalent TGEV, PEDV and PRoV (G5 type) live vaccine (consisting of an attenuated H strain, an attenuated CV777 strain and the attenuated NX strain), which was licensed on December 31, 2014, by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. The results of vaccine clinical trials showed that the immunization protection rate was over 95%, and the incidence of viral diarrheal diseases of swine in experimental farms was reduced from 8-12% to 3-5% [5] . In the future, the TGEV, PEDV and PRoV trivalent live vaccine will serve as an effective tool for the control of viral diarrheal diseases of swine in China, especially PEDV infections.\n\nGenetically engineered vaccines: Mucosal immunity plays an important role in the immune mechanism of viral diarrheal diseases. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies secreted by the intestinal mucosa can defend against invading pathogens. Oral vaccines can stimulate mucosal immunity and produce protective mucosal and serum IgA antibodies, and they are an effective method for prevention of intestinal infectious diseases. For PEDV oral vaccines, Hou et al. reported that lactic acid bacteria expressing the PEDV N protein could activate the production of mucosal IgA and circulating IgG antibodies against the PEDV N protein [16] . Ge et al. reported that recombinant lactobacilli expressing * Group was defined based on the phylogenetic tree of S1 gene of the selected PEDV strains in our study (see Fig. 2 ).\n\nthe N protein and the core neutralizing epitope (COE) could stimulate the intestines to produce local immune responses, as well as systemic immune responses, after oral immunization [13, 14] . Liu et al. constructed recombinant lactobacilli expressing the PEDV N gene or the S1 region of the S gene, and an oral inoculation showed that lactobacilli expressing the N protein could enhance the mucosal and systemic immune responses mediated by recombinant lactobacilli expressing the S1 fragment of the S protein [25] . The S protein of PEDV is a peplomer glycoprotein that is located on the surface of viral particles, and it can mediate the production of neutralizing antibodies; therefore, it is a target for vaccine research. However, the S protein is a highly glycosylated protein, and in vitro expression of recombinant S protein usually results in the loss of immunogenicity. To produce a highly effective PEDV vaccine, Meng et al. used a eukaryotic expression vector to construct a DNA vaccine expressing the PEDV S gene. This vaccine was able to effectively activate cell-mediated immunity and mediate the production of high levels of antibodies in immunized animals [28] . Liang et al. used a eukaryotic expression vector to construct a recombinant plasmid expressing the S1 region of the PEDV S gene, and they further constructed an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain that carried a recombinant plasmid expressing the S1 region of the S gene [23] . Currently, although PEDV oral vaccines and DNA vaccines are still at the research stage and have not been applied in Chinese pig populations, these studies have broadened our understanding of PEDV vaccines, and they have provided a foundation for the future development of highly effective PEDV vaccines.\n\nRecently, a large number of studies of PEDV have provided an in-depth understanding of PEDV infections in the pig population in China. In particular, a trivalent live vaccine for viral diarrheal diseases of swine has been authorized for (b) Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (1,000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the recombinant region of each potential recombinant event; (c) Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (1,000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the non-recombinant region of each potential recombinant event.\n\nuse, and it is a powerful tool for the control of PED. However, virus variability and co-infections of PEDV with other enteric viruses are unpredictable. These factors make it difficult to understand and control PEDV infections. Therefore, future work should continue to trace the variability of PEDV strains and co-infections of other enteric viruses, improve PEDV vaccines using variant strains as candidates and elucidate the pathogenicity of PEDV variant strains."}
