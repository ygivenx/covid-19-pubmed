{"title": "Laboratory Methods", "body": "They were examined daily for cytopathic effect, and immunofluoresence was done on fixed cell smears when CPE appeared or at the end of the incubation period [1] .\n\nTotal nucleic acid was extracted from the specimens using NucliSens easyMAG extraction system (bioMerieux, Netherlands) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nTwelve \u00b5l of extracted nucleic acid was used to prepare cDNA by Invitrogen Superscript III kit with random primer as described previously [2] For influenza A or B virus, 2\u00b5l of cDNA was amplified in LightCycler with a total volume of 20\u00b5l reaction containing FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany), 4.0mM MgCl 2 and 0.5\u00b5M of each primer. The forward primer (5'-CTTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACG-3') and the reverse primer (5'-GGCATTTTGGACAAAKCGTCTA- 3) were used for amplification corresponding to the M gene of influenza A [1] . Cycling conditions were as follows:\n\nan initial denaturation at 95\u00baC for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00baC for 10 seconds, 60\u00baC for 3 seconds, 72\u00baC for 12 seconds with ramp rates of 20\u00baC/second. For influenza B, forward (5'-GGGATATACGTAATGTGTTGT) and reverse (5'-GCACTGCCTGCTGTACACTT) primers was used to amplify a 489bp product corresponding to the nonstructural protein [3] . Cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95\u00baC for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00baC for 10 seconds, 55\u00baC for 5 seconds, 72\u00baC for 20 seconds with ramp rates of 20\u00baC/second. A series of dilutions were prepared to generate calibration curves and run in parallel with the test samples. At the end of the assay, PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis to determine the specificity of the assay."}
