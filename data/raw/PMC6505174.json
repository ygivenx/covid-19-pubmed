{"title": "A Diallel of the Mouse Collaborative Cross Founders Reveals Strong Strain-Specific Maternal Effects on Litter Size", "body": "The mouse inbred strains used in these experiments are the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). The founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). Mice originated from a colony maintained by Gary Churchill at the Jackson Laboratory, and were transferred to the FPMV lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 2008. The original colony also produced most of the G1 breeders that populated the inbred funnels at ORNL, TAU and Geniad (Srivastava et al. 2017). All mice described here were reared by the FPMV lab at UNC. Mice were bred at the UNC Hillsborough vivarium from 2008-2010 and bred at the UNC Genetic Medicine Building (GMB) vivarium from 2010-2012. A total of 4,448 litters resulting from crosses between 1,478 individual dams and 1,238 individual sires were born from all eight inbred crosses and 54 of 56 reciprocal F1 hybrid crosses, excluding hybrids between NZO\u00d7CAST and NZO\u00d7PWK, which are known unproductive crosses (Chesler et al. 2008). The directions of all crosses are described as female by male (i.e., dam.strain \u00d7 sire.strain), unless otherwise noted. Litter size and sex were determined at weaning by visual inspection. Animals were kept on a 14-hour, 10-hour light/dark schedule with lights turned on at 7:00 am; temperature was maintained at 20\u00b0-24\u00b0 with relative humidity between 40\u201350%. Mice were housed in standard 20\u00d730-cm ventilated polysulfone cages with standard laboratory grade Bed-O-Cob bedding. Water and Purina Prolab RMH3000 were available ad libitum. Mouse chow was supplemented with Fenbendazole (Feb 2010) two weeks before and two weeks after transportation to the GMB facility to eliminate possible pinworms. Selamectin treatment was dropped onto the coats of mice before transfer to remove mites from the cages. These treated cages were not opened until after their arrival at UNC GMB. All animal rearing and breeding was conducted in strict compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council 1996, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232589/). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina approved all animal use and research described here.\n\nSignificant environmental interactions were determined using ANOVA, using JMP 12 software (JMP, Version 12. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989-2007). Tested effects included a season effect (average weaned litter size in each month over every year), non-seasonal factors using a year-by-month effect (average weaned litter size for all months across all years), and a litter order effect (average weaned litter size in each subsequent dam litter). We performed the ANOVA on litter size counts from the eight inbred matings only, because of their robust sample sizes throughout the four years of breeding.\n\nTo estimate the overall contributions of heritable factors affecting litter size in our population, we adapted a previously published linear mixed model, BayesDiallel (Lenarcic et al. 2012), which performs this estimation for continuous phenotypes, to the setting of a discrete count-based phenotype. To do this we reimplemented the BayesDiallel Gibbs sampler as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the R software package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010).\n\nLet yi be the number of pups born to litter i, where yi is a positive integer (zeros are not observed). For any categorical variable x, let the notation x[i] indicate the value of x relevant to i: in particular, let h[i] denote litter i\u2019s batch h=1,\u2026,48; let r[i] denote its parity order r=1,\u2026,12; and let (j,k)[i] denote its parentage, defined by maternal strain j and paternal strain k, where (j,k)\u2208{1,\u2026,8}2. The effect of parental strains on yi was modeled using an overdispersed zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) regression (data scales of the model in brackets):yi\u223cZTPois(\u03bbi)                           [observed]\u03bbi=g-1(\u2113i)                                 [expected]\u2113i=\u03b7i+\u03b5i                        [latent+overdis.]\u03b7i=\u03bc+orderr[i]+batchh[i]+dT(j,k)[i]\u03b2  [latent](1)where ZTPois(\u03bbi) denotes a Poisson distribution with an expected value E[yi]=\u03bbi1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbi but is conditional on having observed that yi\u22600 (Appendix A), g is the link function g(x)=log(x), with inverse g\u22121(x)=ex, that relates \u03bbi to a latent scale \u2113i, and \u03b7i is a linear predictor on that latent scale with an error term \u03b5i\u223cN(0,\u03c32) providing overdispersion. The linear predictor \u03b7i is composed of the following: an intercept \u03bc; a litter (parity) order effect, modeled as the combination of a fixed effect slope, r\u03b1, and a random effect with an independent level for each litter order, i.e., orderr\u223cN(r\u03b1,\u03c4order2), where \u03b1 is a fixed effect and \u03c4order2 is the variance of the random deviations around r\u03b1; a batch effect, batchh\u223cN(0,\u03c4batch2); and a linear predictor, d(j,k)T\u03b2, modeling the effect of the parental strain combination (j,k).\n\nThe contribution of parental strains, d(j,k)T\u03b2, is equivalent to the \u2018fullu\u2019 (full, unsexed, \u2018Babmvw\u2019) model described in (Lenarcic et al. 2012), namely,d(j,k)T\u03b2=aj+ak\ufe38additive+mj\u2212mk\ufe38parental sex+I{j=k}(\u03b2inbred+bj)\ufe38inbred penalty+I{j\u2260k}(vjk+S{j<k}\u22c5wjk)\ufe38epistasis(2)where subscripted variables a,m,b,v,w model the effects of specific strains or strain-pairs, \u03b2inbred models an overall effect, I{A} is an indicator and equal to 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise, S{A} is a sign variable equal to 12 if A is true and \u221212 otherwise. In more detail, the a (\u201cadditive\u201d) class represents strain-specific dosage effects, with a1,\u2026,a8 modeled as aj\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4a2), where Nstz is a normal distribution subject to the sum-to-zero constraint \u2211jaj=0 [using the approach of Crowley et al. (2014), Appendix A]. The m (\u201cparental sex\u201d) class represents parent-of-origin effects, modeled as mj\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4m2), where a positive value of mj implies that strain j increases litter size more when inherited through the maternal line, with the difference between maternal and paternal being 2mj (since the design matrix entry for mj is coded +1 for dam and \u22121 for sire). The effect of being inbred is composed of an overall (fixed) effect \u03b2inbred and strain-specific (random) effects bj\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4b2). Epistatic effects are modeled as strain-pair specific deviations, with \u201csymmetric\u201d effects vjk\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4v2) representing the overall deviation from the rest of the model induced by the (unordered) strain combination j with k, and \u201casymmetric\u201d effects wjk\u223cNstz(0,\u03c4w2) modeling a further deviation induced by differences in parent-of-origin.\n\nTo provide directional parent-of-origin effects for maternal and paternal strain we defined, by reparameterization of the additive and parental sex effect, the following two additional types of effect:damj=aj+mjsirej=aj\u2212mj .For example, damB6=aB6+mB6 is the B6-specific dam (maternal strain) effect and sireB6=aB6\u2212mB6 is the B6-specific sire (paternal strain) effect. Posterior samples of these quantities were obtained as a post-processing step by reparameterizing posterior samples of aj and mj. Obtaining these as a post-processing step, rather than explicit modification of Equation 2, preserves the original BayesDiallel model and therefore has no effect on the effect estimates (or variance projection estimates) for the other diallel categories. (Parameter definitions summarized in Table S1.)\n\nThe decomposition of diallel effects in Equation 2 and its dam vs. sire reformulation have parallels in earlier diallel literature. A reduced version of the decomposition composed of additive (a) and symmetric epistasis (v) estimate, respectively, the Generalized Combining Ability (GCA) and Specific Combining Ability (SCA) described by Sprague and Tatum (1942); including also the (reciprocal) asymmetric epistasis (w) term recapitulates Griffing\u2019s Method 1, Model 1 (Griffing 1956). The inbred penalty (\u03b2inbred, b) is comparable to dominance measures defined in, for example, Hayman (1954). The parental sex effects (m) are akin to the maternal effects of Topham (1966) and the \u201cextranuclear\u201d effects in the \u201cbio\u201d model of Cockerham and Weir (1977) and Zhu and Weir (1996), and the bio model\u2019s reparameterization to indirectly estimate dam and sire effects has been described in, for example, Lynch and Walsh (1998). The estimation of dam and sire effects directly, as explicit model parameters for the diallel, was proposed by Comstock and Robinson (1948, 1952). The main differences between these earlier analyses and ours are the simultaneous inclusion of all parameter groups, the use of a Bayesian random effects framework to allow all these parameters to be fitted, and the extension to modeling a non-Gaussian response.\n\nPriors were chosen to be minimally informative. For fixed effects (\u03bc, \u03b1, and \u03b2inbred) we used N(0,1\u00d7103). For variances of random effects (\u03c32, \u03c4a2, \u03c4m2, \u03c4b2, \u03c4v2, \u03c4w2, \u03c4order2, \u03c4batch2) we used an inverse gamma distribution with scale and shape both equal to 0.001. Posterior effect estimates are presented as posterior mean (and median), and the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval.\n\nIn order to stably estimate the contribution of each variance class to the overall phenotype, we used the diallel variance projection [VarP; Crowley et al. (2014)]. This is a heritability-like measure that partitions the overall phenotypic variance of an idealized future diallel experiment into additive, parent-of-origin (parental sex), inbred (dominance), epistatic, and other random/fixed effects categories in the diallel. Rather than being based on estimated variance parameters (e.g., \u03c4a2,\u03c4b2,\u2026), which are typically ill-informed by the data and thus both uncertain and sensitive to priors, the VarP uses the estimated effects themselves, both fixed (e.g., \u03b2inbred) and random (i.e., the best linear unbiased predictors, or BLUPs, such as a1,a2,\u2026), since these are well-informed, precise and regularized by shrinkage. The VarP calculation involves ratios of sums-of-squares in similar fashion to R2 but for an idealized diallel that is both complete and balanced. As an R2-like measure, the VarP is reportable for both fixed and random effects, and includes confidence intervals arising from posterior uncertainty in those effects\u2019 values.\n\nVarPs were calculated both from the ZTP model described above, and, for comparison, from the standard Gaussian-outcome BayesDiallel model (using the BayesDiallel software) (Appendix A). The standard BayesDiallel model was applied to our data after litter size was subject to a variance-stabilizing transformation, the square root, this corresponding to the linear mixed model approximation to the ZTP,\n\nTo model diallel effects on sex ratio we recast the BayesDiallel model as a binomial GLMM. Letting yi be the number of males out of a total of ni pups for litter i, we modelyi \u223c Binom (ni, \u03c0i)    [observed]\u03c0i=g-1(\u2113i)                [expected](4)where \u03c0i is the expected proportion of males predicted for litter i, the link function is g(x)=logit(x)=log(x)/(1\u2212x), with inverse link g\u22121(x)=logit\u22121(x)=expit(x)=ex/(1+ex), and \u2113i, which represents \u03c0i on the latent scale, is modeled using the BayesDiallel hierarchy as in Equation 1.\n\nAdditional details about our statistical modeling approaches are provided in Appendix A (litter size) and Appendix B (sex ratio).\n\nFile S1 contains all breeding data used for the analysis in this study.

Supplemental material available at Figshare: https://figshare.com/s/fefa6216bf29b2baeb65.\n\nWe bred litters in an 8\u00d78 inbred diallel of the CC founder strains, and generated all eight inbreds and 54 of 56 possible reciprocal F1 hybrids (Figure 1, Figure S1\u2013S3). The eight inbred strains, displayed across the diagonal, were mated at higher frequencies both for maintenance of inbred strains and propagation of the diallel. For all 62 genetic inbred and hybrid crosses, we recorded the following information: mated pairs, wean dates, litter size at weaning, including total and sex-specific counts (File S1). This diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects (Koturbash et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Didion et al. 2012; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Calaway et al. 2013; Crowley et al. 2014; Phillippi et al. 2014; Odet et al. 2015; Crowley et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Percival et al. 2016; Shorter et al. 2017; Oreper et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018). As a result, certain reproductive measurements such as time between litters and maximum number of offspring per cross were necessarily biased by experimental breeding requirements. Average weaned litter size, however, is a reproductive trait that should be well-estimated independently of these factors.\n\nWe measured litter size and report the mean number of weaned pups per litter for the 62 viable crosses in the diallel (Figure 1). A wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, ranging from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB\u00d7WSB crosses, to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD\u00d7PWK crosses, with an overall mean of 5.5 weaned pups per litter. Examining average litter sizes of the inbred strains across all 4 years, we found neglible evidence of consistent seasonal effects (F11,2283=1.272\nP = 0.23) (Figure S4) but positive evidence of non-seasonal patterns: a modeled \u2018year.month\u2019 covariate significantly affected litter size (F47,2247=2.44\nP < 0.0001; see also Figure S5). The non-seasonal effect could be driven by the relocation of mice between vivariums, which occurred in February 2010. The housing facility may have an impact on litter size as well. To test this, we measured average litter size differences between the two housing facilities and found that two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB with a difference of 5.87 to 4.42 weaned pups per litter (P < 0.0001) for 129S1, and 3.84 to 3.42 weaned pups per litter (P = 0.029) for WSB. The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion). For average litter size across the diallel, we tested for an effect of litter number (birth parity number, for a given mating pair) on the number of pups weaned in each litter. Previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors (De la Fuente and San Primitivo 1985). This effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed that there was significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (P < 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size (Figure S5).\n\nTo estimate founder strain effects on litter size, we used a Bayesian regression model that decomposes the phenotypic variation in the diallel into genetic and parent-of-origin contributions (Lenarcic et al. 2012). Using this model, the percentage of the variance in litter size explained by diallel effects was 17.73%, with additive effects explaining 9.18% (VarP[additive]; this GCA-like measure being related to narrow sense heritability), parent-of-origin effects (VarP[parental.sex]) accounting for 5.77%, the fact of being inbred (VarP[inbred.overall]) at 1.43%, and strain-by-strain interactions (VarP[epistatic.symmetric] + VarP[asymmetric.epistatic]) at 3.40% (Figure 2A).\n\nIn more detail, we present estimates for all modeled diallel effects as posterior means and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals (Figure 2B). Parameters are divided into two groups: general effects and strain pair-specific effects. General effects comprise strain-specific additive effects (additive), strain-specific and overall inbred (inbred), and strain-specific parent-of-origin (parental sex) effects. Strain pair-specific (epistatic) effects are the effects that arise specifically in crosses of two heterologous strains, with \u2018v\u2019 referring to symmetric epistatic and \u2018w\u2019 referring to asymmetric epistatic effects (pairwise parent-of-origin effects).\n\nUnder the general effects, we see significant positive additive effects on average litter size from B6, NOD, and NZO and significant negative additive effects on litter size from CAST, PWK, and WSB strain dosages. A similar pattern is seen in the parental sex effects, where B6 and NOD dosages have a significant positive effect on average litter size, whereas CAST, PWK, and WSB have significant negative effects. The overall \u201cinbred\u201d effect is negative, indicating that inbred status decreases average litter size, regardless of parental strain. Each strain also has an individual inbred effect in addition to the overall inbred effect. When the individual inbred effects are taken into account with the overall \u201cinbred\u201d effect, inbred litters are on average slightly smaller than their heterozygous counterparts. For strain pair-specific epistatic effects, there are a few marginally noteworthy effects, with the most prominent being a negative asymmetric epistatic effect for PWK\u00d7NOD.\n\nTo more clearly differentiate the contributions of the mother vs. the father strain, we reparameterized the BayesDiallel model to capture effects specific to dam.strain and sire.strain (Figure 3). B6 and NOD dams increase litter sizes by more than 1.26 fold, by an average of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, respectively, regardless of sire. CAST, PWK, and WSB dams tend to decrease average litter size by 0.90, 0.81, and 1.51 pups. The sire effect is similar, with NOD and NZO sires having larger litters and CAST sires producing smaller litters. As expected, we see that the dam.strain has a much larger influence on the variation of litter size compared with the sire.strain (13.15% vs. 1.81%).\n\nWe examined genetic and non-genetic effects on the average sex ratio per litter and found no evidence that sex ratio was skewed (Figure S6; Figure S7). The overall mean for sex bias, quantified as number of male pups weaned divided by the total number of weaned pups, was 0.4979, and did not significantly differ from our expectation of a 50:50 sex ratio (binominal test, two-tailed P = 0.219). For the eight inbred founders, 129S1 is the only strain that departed significantly from expectation, with slight reduction of males 0.475:0.525 (binominal test, two-tailed P = 0.041). However, correction for multiple testing shows no significant sex ratio bias of any inbred strain. The outbred crosses have substantially fewer litters and offspring than the inbred matings, leading to less balanced sex ratios; however, when multiple testing is accounted for, they also show no significant deviations from expected sex ratios.\n\nWe have investigated factors influencing litter size in the eight CC founders and their F1 hybrids using a new extension of the BayesDiallel model. We note that litter size is a component of reproductive performance, but distinct from total strain productivity; a study on total strain productivity would need to take into account litter size, numbers of litters, maximum reproductive age, and pup survival until breeding. Our results illustrate how mammalian litter size in a full diallel design is influenced by genotypic and environmental variation. These results present new information on CC founder strains\u2019 reproductive performance, show that maternal effects and the environment play a large role in litter size variation, and provide no evidence for seasonality effects on litter size in a controlled animal facility. The results also address some of the factors that contributed to line extinction and breeding problems in generating the CC (Chesler et al. 2008; Philip et al. 2011; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Shorter et al. 2017).\n\nWe estimated that genetic (additive, inbred, and epistatic) effects on average litter size explained 17.73% of variation, suggesting that most of the phenotypic variation arises from unexplained environmental effects. Compared with the overall average litter, we observed substantial positive effects of B6 and NOD strains, from both additive genetic and parent-of-origin parameters, and substantial negative effects of PWK and WSB (Figure 2). We also observed, as expected, that lower litter size was associated with being inbred (Figure 2A). These estimates are likely driven by the unique selection history of these inbred lines, and comparisons should be limited to these eight founder strains, and the CC and DO populations.\n\nDuring the G1 and G2 out-crossing generations of the CC, mean litter size was lower for crosses involving wild-derived strains, CAST, PWK and WSB (Philip et al. 2011). A similar pattern is observed here, but these effects are determined to be specifically through the maternal strain, with CAST, PWK and WSB having negative \u201cdam\u201d effects on litter size (Figure 3). It is likely that selection pressure in classical lab strains is associated with larger litters compared with the wild-derived strains. Additionally, two of the wild-derived strains, CAST and PWK, are from a different subspecific origin than the other six CC founders. This likely contributes to decreased productivity through subspecific incompatibilities (Shorter et al. 2017).\n\nWe identify and report environmental factors that may influence litter size. The breeding of this diallel was performed across two different vivariums over the course of 4 years, and we see a significant effect from housing facility. The Hillsborough facility was associated with larger litters for all strains, especially 129S1 and WSB. The two facilities have many different factors that could explain these differences. The Hillsborough facility housed multiple species, including dogs and mice, had smaller rooms that held approximately 300 mouse cages, was remotely located in a rural area, had different laboratory personnel, had cage changes once a week, and was supplied with filtered well water. The diallel breeding at the GMB facility took place in a large central room, contained only laboratory mice, is located in a basement of a large seven story research building on campus, has cage changes every other week, and is supplied with filtered city water. It is possible that one or more of these factors, independently or in combination, affected productivity. Another finding was that seasonality, which has previously been shown to influence litter size and frequency of litters in mammals (Drickamer 1990), did not seem to significantly impact litter size in this study. This is likely due to consistent light-dark cycles and temperatures as well as a steady diet. We did observe a significant effect on litter size after the transfer of the mice to the UNC GMB facility (February 2010), which reduced overall litter sizes from March to June 2010. This may have been due to the use of Fenbendazole during the time of the transfer. Other factors, such as the sex of the laboratory personnel interacting with the animals, are generally known to influence rodent behavior and could contribute to some of the environmentally-induced variation we observed (Sorge et al. 2014).\n\nLast, we measured sex ratio across all inbred and outbred crosses. Despite some departures from equality at the nominal significance threshold (alpha = 0.05), no associations with founder strain dosage remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Recent work has suggested a potential for bias in sex ratio driven by the male germline in Mus musculus (Conway et al. 1994; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2008; Cocquet et al. 2009; Ellis et al. 2011; Cocquet et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2012; Larson et al. 2016), particularly in inter-subspecific hybrids that are mismatched for copy number of X- and Y-linked genes expressed in postmeiotic spermatids. Although there are no previous observations that suggest a bias in sex ratio in the CC or its founders, it remains an important characteristic to measure in a study on reproductive productivity.\n\nTo estimate heritable effects on liter size and sex ratio we extended the original BayesDiallel model of Lenarcic et al. (2012) in two new ways. First, to better understand and distinguish the effects arising from female and male parents, we reparameterized our strain-specific additive and parental-sex effects such that we could provide estimates of maternal strain and paternal strain effects separately. In the original BayesDiallel model, maternal and paternal strain effects are split into \u201cadditive\u201d effects, which consolidates the effects they have in common, and \u201cparental sex\u201d, which models any remaining deviation between the two. Recognizing that additive effects from the sire are essentially wiped out by the additive effects, we instead collapsed the additive and parental-sex effects into \u201cdam.strain\u201d and \u201csire.strain\u201d effects in a post-processing step on the posterior output. This allowed us to run the original BayesDiallel model while also viewing our data from the perspective of dam strain and sire strain contributions.\n\nSecond, we reimplemented the original MCMC sampler, designed for modeling a continuous outcome variable, in a general package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010) in order to model count and binary responses. Litter size, as measured, is most naturally distributed as Poisson, with zero-truncation owing to the fact that only successful litters were recorded. Sex ratio is most naturally modeled as a binomial, with an underlying (male) proportion between 0 and 1. Although it would be possible to obtain an approximate analysis by transformations to normality using the original BayesDiallel (and we do this for litter size for some otherwise hard-to-obtain quantities), we found such approximations to be inadequate for reliable estimation of higher order effects in the case of litter size and deeply flawed in the case of sex ratio. Although there is a computational cost, and added complexity to determining variance contributions, this new implementation achieves several objectives: 1) we no longer break the assumptions in the original model regarding normally distributed errors; 2) we easily accommodate overdispersion in our data; and 3) we can select from a large number of GLMMs models that more closely resemble the forms of our data observations. In addition, we believe this flexibility will be appealing to many other researchers who would like to model non-Gaussian distributed phenotypes using diallel designs, and we have provided the code in an R package litterDiallel (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2580307).\n\nOverall, these results have implications for other avenues of future research. Future multiparental research populations should test for strain incompatibilities, reproductive phenotyping, and other health traits in a full diallel before the recombinant inbreeding begins (Odet et al. 2015). These future research populations should also use non-related wild-derived individuals from the same subspecific origin in order to increase genetic diversity without introducing hybrid incompatibilities."}
