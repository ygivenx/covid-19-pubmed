{"title": "", "body": "We assume that infection is acquired from individuals who are either asymptomatic or who have only mild symptoms, and who are therefore following their regular mobility patterns. In other words, the spatial distribution of infection results from the routine mobility patterns of susceptible and infectious individuals rather than, say, from susceptible individuals visiting non-mobile infectious individuals. We also assume that all individuals experience the same frequency and intensity of interactions, regardless of factors such as age.\n\nWhile it is untrue that all infections are acquired from individuals with mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, recent evidence shows that influenza transmission can arise via aerosol transmission from normal breathing [1]-i.e., sneezing and coughing are not required for infection to occur. This highlights the role that mildly-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can play in the population experience of infection, especially since they are likely to adhere to their regular routines and their routine hygiene practices.\n\nWe define the force of infection in region i that is exerted by infectious individuals who reside in region j (\u03b2 ij ), the daily force of infection in region i (\u039b i ), and the daily force of infection vector (\u039b):\n\nWe then define a meta-population SEIR compartment model of infection with a mean latent period of 1/\u03c3 and a mean infectious period of 1/\u03b3:\n\nWe define the initial state to be fully-susceptible resident populations in each region, and introduce E 0 exposed individuals into a randomly selection region \u03b1:\n\nThe absorbing states all satisfy the following condition:\n\nIn this model, infectious individuals move around the urban environment and due to their mixing patterns the force of infection can differ between regions:\n\nAccordingly, there is no simple expression for the epidemic final size in each patch [2, 3] .
