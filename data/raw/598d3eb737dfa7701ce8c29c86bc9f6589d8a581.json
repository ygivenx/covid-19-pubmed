{"title": "Duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a patient with COVID-19", "body": "The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concern about a global 16 pandemic. Knowledge about the duration of viral shedding remains important for patient 17 management and infection control. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum 18 of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, 19\n\nVietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-20 PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live 21 SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in 22\n\nChina, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, 23\n\nand fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications 24 for infection control. 25 .

He had become ill 34 with respiratory symptoms on January 26, 2020, ten days after arrival in Vietnam from the 35 United States. Whilst travelling to Vietnam, he had two hours of transit at an airport in Wuhan, 36\n\nChina. His clinical condition improved, and from February 9 th he no longer required supplementary 47 oxygen. However, follow-up throat swabs remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-48 .

Additionally, a plasma sample 50 collected on day 2 of admission was weakly positive; urine samples were negative (Figure 1) . 51\n\nThe patient was discharged with full recovery on February 21, 2020 after 21 days of 52\n\nSince his arrival in Vietnam, the patient had stayed in a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, and had 54 sought for medical treatments at private clinics before hospital admission. A total of 14 close 55 contacts were identified and followed for 14 days, but none had signs of respiratory infections, 56\n\nand their throat swabs collected on day 14 of quarantine were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-57\n\nLong duration of viral detection in throat swabs by RT-PCR has been reported in a case series 59 from China (2) Collectively, our report shows the persistence of PCR positivity in throat and rectum of a patient 64 with COVID-19, which may potentially indicate persistent viral shedding. As such COVID-19 65 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. 66 Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control. 67 .
