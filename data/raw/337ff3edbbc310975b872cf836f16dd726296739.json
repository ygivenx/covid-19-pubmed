{"title": "Immunization in Travel Medicine", "body": "approximately 54% of practitioners train in family medicine. 10 Travel and tropical medicine training has been increasingly embraced in emergency medicine over the last 20 years because of the escalating numbers of immigrants, refugees, and travelers presenting to emergency departments for care. 11 At present, few guidelines regarding certification and qualifications required to practice travel medicine exist. The Glasgow Diploma in Travel Medicine was the first diplomate course (DTM&H) offered by the Communicable Diseases Unit of the University of Glasgow in 1996. Several recognized courses are currently offered worldwide. Since 2003, ISTM has offered a voluntary Certificate of Knowledge Examination, which requires training and/or practice prerequisites. In 2010, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow introduced a formal 2-part examination to assess the knowledge of trained and experienced practitioners. Licensure to provide yellow fever vaccine is largely regulated by national or regional health care authorities in Europe and the United States. The CDC publishes the Health Information for International Travel (the Yellow Book), which serves as a reference, including updated malaria prophylaxis and treatment guidelines, for those advising international travelers about health risks (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ content/yellowbook/home-2010.aspx). Similar guidelines are available from several other national health services and specialty societies, such as the Public Health Agency of Canada's Travel Health Guidelines (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/) and Health Protection Scotland's Travax Web site (http://www.travax.nhs.uk). Rigorous structured continuing medical education, including outpatient clinic and hospital rounds, didactic lectures, and laboratory work, is provided in many tropical countries worldwide by specialty organizations and tropical medicine consultants. Multiple studies underline the importance of appropriate training, experience, and ongoing education in providing individuals with proper peritravel care. [12] [13] [14] \n\nIn general, travel medicine practice involves education and care of the traveler, before, during, and after a trip or more-prolonged stay in another country, to maintain traveler's well-being and safety and avoid importation of infectious agents. As noted, disease surveillance and care of migrants and refugees are becoming increasingly important additions to this practice. The pretravel consultation begins with an evaluation of the health and immunization status of the traveler and concludes with an assessment and a plan based on the itinerary-based risk. A growing number of decision-support resources and tools are available to facilitate this process, including government travel advice sites, Travax, Tropimed, and Gideon. Prevention of individual diseases is addressed by a combination of patient education, vaccination, provision of chemoprophylaxis, use of methods to avoid insect exposure, food and water precautions, provision of medication for self-treatment of certain illnesses, and provision of travel and evacuation insurance if desired. Individual recommendations are based on epidemiologically determined likelihood of injury and disease occurrence in an individual area and the individual traveler's health, experience, health belief model, and tolerance of risk. 15 At times, pretravel consultation may provide a cogent argument for travel postponement, as with pregnant women planning travel to malarial areas.\n\nRoutine medical and dental care should be updated before a trip. Patients are advised to carry a sufficient supply of required medications with them, because those drugs purchased overseas may not be the same drug, may not be manufactured to similar standards as those available in developed countries, or may contain counterfeit medications or contaminants. Detailed planning, equipment, and medications for large and specialized groups and expeditions are beyond the scope of this article but are readily available from several articles, texts, and on-line information sites provided by both the ISTM and the Wilderness Medicine Society.\n\nIdeally, the initial pretravel consultation should occur at least 4 to 6 weeks before the patient's departure to allow adequate time for serial immunizations and immunizations to take effect, to begin antimalarials that must be started before arrival in endemic areas, and for assessment of potential adverse reactions to vaccinations and medications. If a traveler has less time before travel, it remains important to see a provider for necessary vaccines, antimalarials, other medications, and counseling. Some medications may cause vaccine interactions or interfere with vaccine-derived immune protection. For example, an interval of at least 10 days should be scheduled between a dose of oral cholera vaccine and the initial dose of chloroquine or mefloquine. In general, attenuated live virus vaccines and bacterial vaccines are contraindicated in persons with altered immune competence and during pregnancy. [16] [17] [18] Multiple vaccines may be given at different sites during the same visit, limited by the traveler's anticipated tolerance for multiple injections and minor side effects. Up to 6 live virus vaccines may be given on the same day without interfering with immune efficacy; otherwise live virus vaccine doses should be separated by at least 1 month. Some immunizations, such as hepatitis A, may be provided in an accelerated schedule.\n\nThe individual's medical history, current medications and allergies, and immunizations are reviewed because these influence vaccine indications and potential contraindications. 18 For example, individuals with egg allergies have a potential contraindication to the vaccination for measles, mumps, rubella, yellow fever, influenza, and rabies. The pretravel history includes exploration and documentation of the individual's purposes for travel, specific travel itinerary, and duration, including discussion of planned or possible stopovers and side trips, with attention to seasonal and locale-specific variances in risk of infection and injury. For example, an individual traveling on business to Rio de Janeiro might wish to take a side trip to the Amazon, which will require additional counseling, vaccinations, and prophylaxis. The types of accommodation and likely styles of eating and drinking during the trip should be discussed relative to risk. Planned activities should also be reviewed relative to risk, for example, spelunking, white water rafting, fresh water and salt water swimming and diving, trekking in remote areas, and potential domestic and wild animal exposure. What degree of interaction will the traveler have with local populations? Will the traveler be engaged in agriculture, wildlife biology, construction, or local medical or humanitarian work? Will the individual travel to an area of unrest or conflict? Current outbreaks of disease and areas of violence and conflict, described on State Department, World Health Organization (WHO), CDC, Pan American Health Organization, and ProMed sites, also play important roles in pretravel counseling.\n\nImmunization is the most common reason that patients seek pretravel consultations. Travelers to tropical and developing countries from Western Europe and North America are exposed to communicable diseases infrequently seen in their home countries because of generally high sanitation standards and mandatory childhood immunization. Appropriate immunization has been shown to increase the likelihood of a traveler remaining healthy. The CDC currently divides travel immunizations into 3 categories: routine, recommended, and required. First-time travelers may be dismayed at the Shepherd & Shoff number of vaccines recommended, the route of administration, and the cost. Because many vaccines are not covered by regular health insurance, vaccines and the relative risk of travel-related illness are prioritized for the traveler. Travelers may elect to obtain routine vaccinations from their primary care provider to maximize insurance coverage. All immunizations administered to travelers are recorded in a copy of the yellow booklet, International Certificates of Vaccination, recognized by the WHO, which should be kept with the individual's passport. A specific page validates yellow fever vaccination.\n\nRoutine immunizations, such as those for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, pneumococcus, and influenza, should be reviewed and updated as warranted. Travelers are counseled about the potential differences in influenza risk and likelihood of vaccine efficacy when traveling in semitropical and tropical areas than in temperate areas and between the northern and southern hemispheres. Because of the infrequent but continued presence of wild poliovirus and clinical polio in developing countries, the CDC currently recommends that adult travelers who have received a primary polio vaccination series with either inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or oral polio vaccine (OPV) should receive a single lifetime additional dose of IPV. 19 The CDC currently recommends that all adults (younger than 65 years) should receive 1 dose of Tdap (tetanus-diptheria-pertussis vaccine) as one of their recommended 10-year boosters, which is particularly relevant to the traveler because of the increased likelihood of exposure to diphtheria and pertussis in developing countries. Individuals born before 1958 are generally considered immune to measles and mumps. All individuals born after 1957 should have documentation of 1 or more doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine unless they have medical contraindication, laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the 3 diseases, or documentation of provider-diagnosed measles or mumps. Individuals who received inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type during the period from 1963 to 1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine. Because of a significant risk of measles exposure, a second MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first, is recommended for adults who work in outbreak settings or in health care settings in developing countries or plan to travel internationally. 20\n\nRecommended vaccines include those that help to protect travelers from contracting illnesses present in other parts of the world and to prevent the importation of infectious diseases across international borders. Which vaccinations an individual will need depends on several factors, including the traveler's age and health status, previous immunization, the destination, the season of the year the individual will be traveling, the length of time an individual will spend in a specific area, whether a traveler will be spending time in rural areas, what activities the individual will engage in, [21] [22] [23] and whether the destination is currently experiencing disease outbreaks. For example, rabies preexposure prophylaxis is recommended for those travelers who will spend a significant time outdoors, especially in rural areas, or who anticipate activities such as spelunking, cycling, camping, or hiking. Rabies vaccination is also recommended for travelers with significant occupational risk (such as veterinarians); for long-term travelers and expatriates living in areas of significant exposure risk; and for travelers involved in any activities that might bring them into direct contact with bats, carnivores, and other mammals. Children are considered at higher risk for rabies exposure because they tend to interact with animals, may receive more bites, and may not report bites or exposures. See Table 1 for a list of recommended vaccinations for travel to certain countries. (continued on next page) (continued on next page) \n\nYellow fever is the only vaccine currently required by international health regulations for travel to and from certain countries in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa. Updated lists of Yellow Fever Vaccination Certification Requirements by Country and Authorized U.S. Yellow Fever Vaccination Clinics are found on the CDC Traveler's Health Web site (www.cdc.gov/travel/content/vaccinations.aspx). Over the last several years, quadrivalent (A/C/Y/W-135) meningococcal vaccination, which must have been issued not more than 3 years and not less than 10 days before arrival, has been required by the Saudi Arabian government for all infants, children, and adult pilgrims for annual travel during the Hajj. The immunization status is checked before issuance of a visa, which is not issued unless documented compliance is provided. A travel health provider letter may be issued to those individuals who are unable to receive vaccine; however, this does not guarantee issuance of a visa for Hajj travel.\n\nMalaria in humans is caused by 5 species of the protozoan genus Plasmodium: P falciparum, P vivax, P ovale (recently split into 2 subspecies), P malariae, and most recently and much less frequently P knowlesi. Malaria is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, although transmission is also documented via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and needle sharing. Anopheles spp are evening feeders; therefore, transmission occurs primarily from dusk to dawn. Annually, malaria causes 350 to 500 million infections and 1 million deaths globally, largely affecting children in areas of Central and South America, parts of the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania (see Fig. 1 for a map of atrisk areas for malaria transmission. Regularly updated maps are available on the WHO and CDC Websites [www.cdc.gov/malaria/map/index.html]). Thirty thousand travelers from Europe and North America contract malaria each year, with 10,745 cases reported in US residents to the CDC from 1997 to 2006. Of the reported cases in the United States, 59.3% were acquired in sub-Saharan Africa, 13.9% in Asia, 13.3% in the Caribbean and Central and South America, and 0.03% in Oceania. However, when considered in the context of volume of travel to these locations, the regions of highest estimated relative risk are West Africa and Oceania; other parts of Africa, South Asia, and South America are felt to have moderate risk, whereas, portions of Central America and other parts of Asia are of relatively lower risk. Individual traveler risk varies substantially by region, including areas of differing altitude, urban versus rural travel, by season, and between travelers. 24 The level of risk presented by a particular itinerary decides whether it may be appropriate to recommend mosquito avoidance methods only, mosquito avoidance methods and chemoprophylaxis, or no specific interventions. Even short exposure, such as that experienced by cruise ship passengers, may pose risk in an area of intense transmission.\n\nMalaria chemoprophylaxis is a dynamic topic, because the risk of transmission is influenced by an individual travelers' behavior, may not be uniformly distributed in individual countries, and is affected by changes in resistance patterns and the availability and usefulness of newer and older drugs. The highest-risk travelers are those first-or second-generation immigrants currently living in nonendemic countries who return to their countries of origin to VFRs. [23] [24] [25] These individuals often consider themselves not at risk because they grew up in an endemic area and believe themselves immune. Unfortunately, acquired immunity is lost very quickly on leaving an endemic area. Several options for malaria chemoprophylaxis are currently available, and no single regimen is ideal for all travelers. A thorough discussion of vector avoidance, malaria chemoprophylaxis, and treatment may be found elsewhere.\n\nMalaria vaccination development has faced numerous challenges since the initial cloning of malaria antigens in the early 1980s. At present, several questions remain regarding vaccine mode of action in this parasite's complex and incompletely understood infection biology, efficacy, dosage schedules, and potential duration of effect. Resources for research funding are relatively scarce. Goals of vaccine development have been to either prevent blood-stage infection completely via destruction of sporozoites before they enter the liver or kill the infected hepatocytes (preerythrocytic vaccine) or to limit parasite growth and density in the blood compartment via destruction of the infected erythrocytes (blood-stage vaccine), with the goal of providing a durable immune response similar in efficacy to that induced by natural infection. Significant antigenic diversity has been a barrier to the development of immunity in both the preerythrocytic and blood stages of parasite development. Although immunity to severe life-threatening disease is evidently acquired early in childhood in areas of intense malaria transmission, clearly demonstrating clinical immunity, vaccine trials have been limited by the lack of an immunologic correlate of effectiveness in vaccinated individuals. 26, 27 An ideal vaccine should be directed against several novel antigens, perhaps T-cell targets, expressed in several stages of parasite development, that are likely to be highly conserved in sequence and robustly recognized by vaccine-induced immune response. 28, 29 Several stage-specific vaccine candidates are currently in trials to prevent P falciparum infection. One preerythrocytic vaccine targeting P falciparum circumsporozoite protein, GlaxoSmithKline RTS, S/AS02 D , is currently in phase 3 trial (NCT00866619) in 11 African centers with results expected at the end of 2011. Phase 1/2b trial of this vaccine administered to 214 Mozambican infants at 10, 14, and 18 weeks of age, staggered with routine vaccines, reported a good safety profile (32.7% vs 31.8% serious adverse events in the control group) and remained somewhat efficacious at 14 months (geometric mean titers of anticircumsporozoite antibodies declined from 199.9 to 7.3 EU/mL at 12 months, remaining 15-fold higher than that of the control group, vaccine efficacy was 33% [95% confidence interval: \u00c04.3 to 56.9, P 5 .076]). 30 The immunogenicity data were similar to those previously reported in older children and adults. 30, 31 No relation between anticircumsporozoite antibody titer and protection was demonstrated in Mozambican children aged 1 to 4 years. 31 To successfully affect global malaria elimination, it is also crucial to attack other major malarial species that affect humans. Vaccine progress against P vivax, a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in Central and South America, the eastern Mediterranean, and Asia, with an estimated 70 million to 391 million cases annually, is not nearly as advanced. 32 Dengue, currently the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral illness in humans, is caused by 4 serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV). Dengue is a member of the Flaviviridae family, as are yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis. DENVs are transmitted to humans via the bite of peridomestic day-biting Aedes mosquitoes, most prominently Aedes aegypti. Infection with DENV causes a spectrum of clinical illness, ranging from a usually mild, acute self-limited febrile illness, dengue fever, to lifethreatening hemorrhagic and capillary leak syndromes of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). DENV causes an estimated 25 million to 100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000 cases of DHF yearly worldwide. 2.5 billion people are estimated to be at risk for infection (Fig. 2 , a world map indicating regions with known risk of dengue is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/ dengue). The United States has witnessed the return of autochthonous transmission since 1980, initially described in Texas, but now reported in Hawaii, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Geosentinel data, collected on 6 continents, showed dengue fever to be the second most common cause of systemic febrile illness, excluding diarrheal diseases, in returning travelers and the most common cause in travelers returning from the Caribbean, South America, Southeast Asia, and South Central Asia. 15 In brief, the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS reflects a complex interaction of viral virulence determinants and the host immune system. Infection with one serotype of DENV renders the individual immune to that strain for life but with only transient immunity to other strains, and individuals are at risk for DHF/DSS with secondary DENV infection with another strain. An increased risk of DHF/DSS also occurs in children within their first year of life when born to DENV-immune mothers. These observations served as the basis for the hypothesis of antibody-dependent immune enhancement (ADE) in DHF/DSS, which is supported by the findings of increased peak viremia in severe DHF/DSS, and ADE is seen in vitro in DENV-infected monocytes. A pathologic cytokine response, including increased levels of interferon g, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor g, after CD8 1 cell activation is thought to contribute to the capillary leak syndrome seen with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF has been hampered by the absence of a validated animal model of dengue infection. Based on the current understanding of virus-immune system interactions, an effective vaccine should produce high titers of neutralizing antibodies against all 4 strains. Failure to achieve this potentially increases the individual's risk of severe DHF/DSS if challenged by a natural virus infection with a different strain. Several tetravalent live attenuated virus candidate vaccines are in development (see Table 2 for a list of current candidate DENV vaccines). Tetravalent serologic responses have been observed in some individuals during trials; whereas each portion of the tetravalent vaccines has not been shown to elicit high titer responses, monovalent vaccines were shown to elicit higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than when they were combined in multivalent combinations, and many individuals mount insufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies despite multiple immunizations. Alternative vaccine candidates include subunit-based vaccines containing purified proteins or DNA plasmids, which have been shown to produce protective antibodies in mice at fairly low neutralizing titers; live attenuated vaccines, including dengue and dengue-yellow fever chimeras; and nonreplicating vaccines, including virus-like particles, DNA vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines. Long-lasting protective neutralizing antibodies are elicited against a specific serotype, but they have been shown to be poorly crossreactive against infection with another serotype. Similar problems were encountered in the development of OPV, and the imbalance in seroconversion was overcome by the administration of 3 doses of the multivalent vaccine. 33 tetravalent live attenuated chimeric yellow fever-dengue vaccine has entered hase 3 trials (NCT01134263). Phase 2 trials suggest that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic. 35 Preliminary results of an ongoing phase 2b efficacy and safety trial in Thai children are expected to be available by the end of 2012.\n\nTraveler's diarrhea is a significant concern among international travelers. It is usually self-limited, consisting of several days of watery diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by low-grade fever, headache, malaise, nausea, and abdominal cramping. Thirty to seventy percent of travelers may be affected during a 2-week trip, largely depending on the travel destination. 42, 43 Other postinfectious sequelae include Guillain-Barre and reactive arthritis. Many viral, bacterial, and protozoal microorganisms cause traveler's diarrhea. Symptoms may result from the ingestion of preformed toxins, such as that seen with Bacillus cereus, staphylococcal food poisoning, and botulism. In general, bacteria are the most commonly identified cause of acute diarrheal disease in travelers visiting tropical and developing countries (80%-90%), with risk modified by geographic region, time of year, and the presence of local outbreaks. In many cases, no causative organism may be identified. Enterotoxigenic strains of E coli (ETEC), which may carry both heat-labile and heat-stable plasmid-coded enterotoxins, are the most commonly identified bacterial cause. Oral cholera vaccine produces some protection against traveler's diarrhea, because it elicits antibody production against the B subunit of cholera toxin, which cross-reacts with the heat-labile toxin of ETEC. In the past decade, Campylobacter species, most commonly Campylobacter jejuni, have become increasingly common pathogenic agents of traveler's diarrhea. These seem to have seasonal and geographic variance, with the peak incidence in the United States in summer months, whereas the peak incidence in other regions, such as North Africa, occurs in winter months. Other bacteria implicated in traveler's diarrhea include enteroadherent E coli; Salmonella spp, including S typhi; Shigella spp; Yersinia enterocolitica; Aeromonas; Vibrio spp, including V parahemolyticus, V cholera, and V vulnificus; and Plesiomonas shigelloides. Norovirus is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea (10%-15% cases), notably in several cruise-ship outbreaks. Rotavirus and astroviruses are less common pathogens in adults (5%-14%). Hepatitis A and E also cause gastrointestinal illness in travelers. Hepatitis E is of particular concern in Immunization in Travel Medicine pregnant women as it may lead to severe, life-threatening illness. Most parasites implicated in traveler's diarrhea are protozoa, including Giardia lamblia, and less commonly Cryptosporidium spp, Cyclospora cayetenensis, Isospora belli, Entamoeba histolytica, and occasionally Dientamoeba fragilis. Helminths are also reported to cause diarrheal disease in travelers. Ingested plant, fish, and shellfish toxin-related illness, including Ackee poisoning, Scombroid, Ciguatera, paralytic, neurotoxic, and diarrheal shellfish poisonings, may also cause gastrointestinal disease in travelers.\n\nPretravel vaccination and counseling regarding safe food and water practices can provide varying degrees of protection against enteric infection; however, even with the greatest of care, the risk of developing diarrhea remains high. The natural protective mechanisms of the intestinal tract, most prominently gastric acidity, and immune stimulation provided by vaccination can be overwhelmed by the ingestion of heavily contaminated water and food and moderated by traveler specifics, such as immune suppression, hypochlorhydria, gastrectomy, and concurrent medications. 44 Environments lacking appropriate sanitary conditions and clean water provide significant stool contamination highly accessible to flies. Attempts to select safe foods, such as those freshly prepared and served hot, can be counteracted by contamination introduced during preparation, storage, and handling. 45 Although many travelers want to experience local culture and cuisine, commonsense food and water precautions may help individuals to make safer choices. These precautions are harder to maintain in those VFRs, those staying in local homes or pursuing more adventurous travel, and those staying in highly contaminated areas for prolonged periods of time. This article does not focus on a detailed discussion of food and water precautions, water treatment, and treatment and prevention of traveler's diarrhea.\n\nAt present, few vaccines are available to prevent the most common causes of traveler's diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccine and oral and intramuscular typhoid vaccines are effective and well tolerated, although limited data address the actual level of protection afforded by oral and injectable typhoid vaccines to travelers from nonendemic areas visiting endemic areas. 46 Cholera vaccine seems moderately effective against non-O139 strains. A transcutaneous E coli LT vaccine is currently in phase 3 trials.\n\nAdditional pretravel recommendations, such as jet lag mitigation, protection against sun exposure, venous thrombosis avoidance, prevention and treatment of altitude illness, baric risk, marine bites and envenomation attendant to diving and water sports, and the risks of extreme heat or cold, depend on the individual traveler's agenda. Safety regulations and practices are less prevalent in many nations than in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Most US medical insurance policies do not provide coverage for illness or accidents occurring outside the country and coverage for medical evacuation; however, many companies provide this insurance. A thoughtful discussion of these topics, and the management of the traveler returning with illness, lies outside the scope of this article.\n\nIn summary, individual travel for business and pleasure has grown tremendously in the past several decades, with an increasing number of at-risk individuals traveling and travelers visiting more remote and dangerous areas. Travelers potentially face several risks during travel. Thorough, epidemiologically and itinerary-based discussion and management of these risks before travel with a provider appropriately educated and experienced to provide this care, taking into consideration the individuals' risk tolerance, medical belief system, and finances, provide individuals the ability Shepherd & Shoff to travel more safely and to maximally experience their trip. Information gleaned from illness and injury experienced by travelers and, infections developed during travel and potentially brought back to the home country, continues to improve care and inform home countries about potential risks to their citizens and to improve the global management of transmissible illness."}
