To interact with biological target, a biological molecule antibodies, including biopolymers like collagen, or monolayers of small molecules acting as bioinorganic interface rendering the property of biocompatibility. To enable optical detection, NPs with fluorescent properties of that alter their optical properties are applied [8] . Some of the modifications of NPs for biomedical applications are enlisted in Fig. 2. \n\nNanotechnology has been applied to glycobiology forming the new science of glyconanotechnology and is a synergy between nanotechnology and glycans playing role in biological and medical applications [1] . More recently, they have been applied in the sialic acid biology.\n\nGlycans occur as surface lining macromolecules and form the first line of contact for any other cell or pathogen and protein-carbohydrate interactions and are known to play role in cell signaling, molecular recognition, immunity, and inflammation. Carbohydrate comprising of wood, insect shells, or cartilage, with mechanical properties serve as biomaterials of importance.

Recently, the sialic acid-Siglec axis discussed in the earlier chapters is revealing to be an emerging target to prevent or affect several diseases. However, the study of deeper role of sialic acid-Siglec axis in immune modulation and therapy suffers from the limitation of suitable sensitive methods. Natural sialic acid ligands can be modified by chemical methods leading to the development of sialic acid mimetics (SAMs) that reveal improved and selective binding affinity toward Siglecs. Glycobiotechnology involving bioorthogonal synthesis is enabling the presentation of SAMs on NPs, polymers, and living cells which finds application in the study of the sialic acid-Siglec axis and its role in immune modulation and therapeutic potential [9] .

The glycome of cells and glycoproteins and their detection and estimation finds importance in understanding glycan functions, development of diagnostics tests, and monitoring of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals. Sialic acid-containing carbohydrates, collectively grouped as sialosides, are known to play major roles in the physiology of health and disease-like infections by virus and bacteria, tumor cell metastasis, but limitation of suitable methods to study sialosides forms the major challenge in the study of their structure and function. Appropriate quantitation of sialic acid finds importance in health and disease to understand the levels correlating with the homeostasis and pathophysiology of the body in infection and disease. Although several biochemical tests find importance in detection and quantitative estimation of sialic acid in the body, the detection of minute quantities of sialic acid and the perturbation in disease states is far from complete. Nanotechnology and its diverse application and application in sensitive methods finds importance in the quantitative detection of N-glycans and sialic acid in the body even in very small amounts.\n\nSynthetic sialoside chemistry, by chemoenzymatic or stereochemical approach, have produced homogeneous size-and structure-defined sialosides with array application, to mimicking cell-surface display and aids in understanding sialoside-mediated interactions. Application of nanotechnology in sialoside arrays [41] is suggested to lead to promising results in study of sialic acid biology.\n\nN-glycans are isolated and characterized by conventional methods of enzymatic treatment, followed by their release and derivatization with a fluorochrome and separation by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Nano Quantity Analyte Detector (NQAD) has been designed to quantitate the nonderivatized sialic acid in glycoproteins, separated by hydrophilic interaction chromatography, detected by measuring size differences in dry aerosol and by converting the particle count rate into chromatographic output signal. This sialic acid quantitative sensitive method lacking requirement of active chromophore or fluorophore finds importance over conventional methods and HPLC/NQAD method offers advantage in reproductive results over the conventional HPLC/DMB method. While HPLC/DMB method involves derivatization of glycoproteins using 1, 2-diamino-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) and Dionex-based high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), the HPLC/NQAD method is designed with elimination of the derivatization step and efficient PolyGLYCOPLEX amide column adding to the sensitivity to the detection method [42] .\n\nSimultaneous quantification and characterization of the N-glycans including both neutral and sialylated glycans suffers from lack of appropriate methods of identifying them. This is circumvented by applying a weak anion-exchange HPLC separation step to fractionate glycans by their sialic acid content followed by a mild acid desialylation step and then resolved by nano-LC-coupled electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry with an intercalated nanofluorescence detector by which neutral glycans can be separated and characterized [43] .\n\nESI-MS method finds applications in detection and characterization of the heavily polysialylated N-glycans in human serum with improved sensitivity [44] .
