{"title": "Selective induction of interleukin-6 in mouse microglia by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor", "body": "Microglia, or brain macrophages, produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, including interleukin-la (IL-la), IL-1/3, IL-5, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), and transforming growth factor-/3 (TGF/3) [5, 11, 31, 32, 34, 36] . Astrocytes, another type of glial cell, also produce various cytokines including IL-la, IL-1/3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, TNFo~, TGF/3, granulocyte-(G-CSF), macrophage-(M-CSF) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM -CSF) [1, 7, 21, 22, 29, 32, 34, 36, 45, 46] . Some populations of astrocytes and microglia may also produce IL-3 [6, 9] , although we could not confirm in our mouse system [29] . Recently, we also showed that microglia and astrocytes produce IL-10 [25] . These various cytokines affect the functions of glial or neuronal cells and form a unique cytokine network in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes regulate the functions of microglia via cytokines, among which, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) such as IL-3, GM-CSF and M-CSF are potent regulators of microglial function.\n\nMicroglia express receptors for these CSFs [35] . M-CSF induces microglial proliferation and also activates lysosoreal enzymes in these cells, effects that are inhibited by antibodies to M-CSF receptors [33] . GM-CSF also induces proliferation of but does not activate lysosomal enzymes in microglia [42, 43] . IL-3 induces morphological changes in microglia and supports the survival of these cells in vitro [42, 43] . We recently showed that IL-3 induces class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on microglia, whereas GM-CSF inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the expression of class II MHC antigens on microglia induced by interferon-y (IFN 7) [18] .\n\nRecent evidence suggests that the regulation of cytokine production differs among different types of cells. Mitogenic and antigenic stimuli induce 1L-6 production in T cells [17] . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), viral infection, and various cytokines also induce IL-6 production in a variety of cells, including monocyte-macrophages [13, 26] . M-CSF and GM-CSF induce IL-6 production in human monocytes [27] . However, the effects of these CSFs on cytokine production in the CNS are as yet unknown. We have now investigated the effects of astrocyte-derived CSFs on cytokine production by microglia. Recombinant murine GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, IL-10, and  TGF/31, as well as human M-CSF and IL-6 were obtained from Genzyme (Boston, MA). Monoclonal antibodies to mouse GM-CSF were provided by Dr. J. Schreurs (DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Inc. Polo Alto, CA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTI') was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and Escherichia coli LPS was from Difco (Detroit, MI).\n\nPrimary mixed glial cell cultures were prepared as described previously [39] , from newborn C3H/HeN mice (Charles River Japan, Sizuoka, Japan). In brief, after the meninges were removed carefully, the brain was dissociated by passing it through a 320-/zm-pore nylon mesh. The cell suspension was washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, triturated, and plated in 75-cm 2 culture flasks (Falcon 3024, Beckton-Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density equivalent to two brains per flask in 10 ml Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 /.~g/ml bovine insulin, and 0.2% glucose. Microglia were isolated on the 14th day by the 'shaking off' method previously described [40] ; the purity of the cultures was 97 to 100% as determined by immunostaining with Mac 1 antibodies (Hybriteck, San Diego, CA, used in 1:50 dilution). Astrocyte-enriched cultures were prepared from the primary mixed glial cell cultures by repetitive exposure to trypsin and replating [41] ; the purity of the cultures exceeded 95% as determined by indirect immuno-fluorescence staining with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein [41] .\n\nMicroglia and astrocyte-enriched cultures were plated in 2.5 cm diameter culture dishes (Falcon 3001, Beckton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density of 5 \u00d7 105/ml and incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of graded concentrations of GM-CSF (0.1 to 100 U/ml), IL-3 (1 to 100 U/ml), M-CSF (1 to 100 U/ml), LPS (1 /.~g/ml) or IFNy (100 U/ml). In some experiments, various concentrations of antibodies to GM-CSF were added to microglia together with GM-CSF. The cell supernatant was then collected and stored at -70\u00b0C until monokine activities were assayed. The time course of cytokine induction by GM-CSF was investigated by collecting cell supernatants at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after stimulation with GM-CSF. After the remaining cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, total RNA was isolated from the cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi [4] with some modifications. RNA(1 /xg) was subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis at 37\u00b0C for 90 min with 50 U of recombinant moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.2 /zg of DNA random hexamers. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 rain, and 2 /xl of the mixture were amplified by 30 of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles with 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and 0.5 /xg each of the sense and antisense primers. The thermal cycle profile was 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and 2 min at 72\u00b0C. A portion (5 /xl) of the PCR mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, which was then stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The by Dr. K. Onozaki, Nagoya City University) [16] and MH-60 (from Dr. T. Hirano, Osaka University) [23] , respectively, and Mq-T colorimetric assay [34, 44] . TNF activity was determined by cytotoxicity to the L929 cell line as described [32] .\n\nAll experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Data are presented as means + S.D. and were analyzed by Student's t-test. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nGM-CSF, at doses of 0.1 to 100 U/ml, induced IL-6 production in microglia in a time-and dose-dependent manner, as assessed by bioassay with the IL-6 dependent cell line MH60 and MTT colorimetric assay ( Fig. 1) . At doses ofl to 100U/ml and time of >8h, the effect of GM-CSF on IL-6 production was statistically significant (P < 0.001) relative to unstimulated cultures at the corresponding times. The maximal effect of GM-CSF on IL-6 production was apparent after 12 h or 24 h of stimulation with each dose examined. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF was inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2) ; the inhibitory effects of the anti-GM-CSF antibodies was statistically significant (P < 0.001) at a dilution of 1:105, and the antibodies completely abolished the effect of GM-CSF (100 U/ml) at a dilution of 1:103. In contrast to its effect on microglia, GM-CSF did not induce IL-6 production in astrocytes. One to 100 U/ml GM-CSF did not induce IL-6 production by astrocytes (Fig. 3) . Among the CSFs, only GM-CSF, but not IL-3 or M-CSF, induced the IL-6 production in microglia ( Fig. 4) . The induction of monokine production by GM-CSF in microglia was specific for IL-6; GM-CSF had no effect on the production of IL-1 or TNFa, whereas LPS, used as a positive control, induced all three monokines (Fig. 4) . The induction of IL-6 production in microglia by GM-CSF was inhibited by IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5) . GM-CSF induced the expression of IL-6 mRNA in microglia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6) . The inhibition of GM-CSF-induced IL-6 production by IL-4 was also confirmed at the mRNA level (Fig. 6 ). IL-4 by itself did not induce IL-6 activity (Fig. 5) or IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 6 ).\n\nIL-6 has important functions in a variety of biological processes [14] . In the CNS, IL-6 promotes the survival and differentiation of cholinergic neurons [12] and modulates the production of neurotrophin [7] . Both IL-6 mRNA and IL-6 receptor mRNA are present in the striatum of rat brain during postnatal development [8] , although we did not detect IL-6 mRNA in the developing mouse cerebral cortex [24] . High levels of IL-6 transcript are present in the adult rat hippocampus [8, 37] , suggesting that IL-6 may function as a neurotrophic factor in both the developing and adult brain in vivo. The concentration of IL-6 is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus [20] , of patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy [28] and of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [15] . IL-6 was detected in association with amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, whereas it was undetectable in control brains [2, 38] . IL-6 may thus be induced in certain pathological conditions and participate directly in the pathological process in either inflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases in the CNS.\n\nIL-6 is produced by astrocytes and microglia in the CNS, and its receptors are expressed on these glial cells as well as neurons [1, 3, 34, 35] . In addition, neurons themselves may produce IL-6 [37, 47] . As in the immune system, IL-6 production is regulated differently in astrocytes and microglia. For example, IL-1 and TNFo~ induce the production of IL-6 in astrocytes but not in microglia [34] . Substance P also induces IL-6 production in astrocytes [10] . In human monocytes, IL-1, IFNT, M-CSF, and GM-CSF all induce IL-6 production [27] . However, with the exception of GM-CSF, these cytokines failed to induce IL-6 in microglia, the counterpart of monocytes/macrophages in the CNS. We show now, for the first time, that GM-CSF, which is produced by astrocytes in the CNS in response to appropriate stimuli [29] , induces IL-6 production in microglia. Because (i) microglia express GM-CSF receptor mRNA [35] , (ii) the effect of GM-CSF was completely inhibited by anti-GM-CSF antibodies, and (iii) other CSFs did not induce IL-6 production in microglia, the induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF appears to be a specific function of GM-CSF mediated by GM-CSF receptors on these cells. Although astrocytes also express GM-CSF receptor mRNA [35] , GM-CSF did not induce the production of IL-6 in astrocytes. The current data, together with our previous observation that IL-I and TNFa specifically induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia [34] , suggest that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate |L-6 production in the opposing cell type by different cytokines. The functions of the induced IL-6 in the CNS remain to be elucidated. However, it may exert neurotrophic effects, acting directly on neurons or indirectly via induction of neurotrophic factors as mentioned above. Alternatively, it may play a role on neuron-glia interaction by activating glial cells.\n\nGM-CSF exerts a variety of functions in the CNS. It reportedly functions as a neurotrophic factor [19] , and induces the proliferation and the morphological transfor-mation to rod-shaped cells of microglia [42, 43] . Recently, we also showed that GM-CSF inhibits the IFNy-induced expression of class II MHC antigen on these cells [18] . We did not detect GM-CSF mRNA in the developing mouse cortex in vivo [24] , and unstimulated glial cells did not produce detectable amounts of GM-CSF [29] . Therefore, GM-CSF may neither function as a neurotrophic factor nor induce IL-6 production in the normal developing brain. However, both GM-CSF mRNA and protein are inducible in astrocytes by stimulation with LPS [22, 29, 45] . Axotomy of facial nerves results in a rapid increase in GM-CSF receptors in the facial motor nucleus, which suggests that GM-CSF may play a role in the pathophysiology in this area after axotomy [30] . Because microglia have very similar characteristics to monocytes/macrophages and are thought to play important roles in the development of various neurological disorders, the effects of GM-CSF on microglia may be crucial in the pathophysiology of these cells. These observations suggest that GM-CSF, when produced in the CNS, may function either as a proinflammatory cytokine by inducing the proliferation and activation of microglia and by inducing another proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in microglia, or as an inhibitory cytokine by suppressing immunoregulatory functions of microglia."}
