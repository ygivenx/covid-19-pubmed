{"title": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus inhibits dsRNA-induced interferon-\u03b2 production in porcine intestinal epithelial cells by blockade of the RIG-I-mediated pathway", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, RNA virus of Coronaviridae family, which is the main etiological agent of severe diarrhea in pigs of all ages and fatality in neonates [1]. Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have received extensive attention for the considerable economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Great advances have been made in elucidation of the molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PED [2]. Recently, coronavirus interaction with host innate immune system has been a hot research field. Previous studies indicated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection enhanced type I interferon expression and its protein 7 modulated type I IFN expression [3, 4]. For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), IFN production among different cell populations varied due to their diverse susceptibility to this virus [5\u20139]. Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) do not induce type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) activation [10\u201312]. So far, limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production [13, 14].\n\nDuring viral infection and replication, the host innate immune response is the first line of defense; therefore, the ability of viruses to suppress or avoid this response is crucial for their pathogenic potential. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is an essential element of the host innate immune response against viral infections. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the replicative intermediate of most viruses, is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b2, which is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Two of major PRRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) detect dsRNA in the cytoplasm [15]. Following dsRNA binding, RIG-I and MDA5 recruit corresponding adapter protein IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) that, in turn, activate downstream signaling of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of \u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) transduction, leading to the activation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB). Activated IRF-3, and NF-\u03baB bind to IFN-\u03b2 enhancer and initiate IFN-\u03b2 transcription [16].\n\nVero cell, an African green monkey kidney cell line, was often used to isolate and propagate PEDV [17]. However, it was often considered that Vero cells might lack genetic component necessary for IFN production [18\u201320]. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are thought to the target cells of PEDV, which play an important role in the activation of host immune responses by induction of key signaling molecules, including cytokines, surface molecules, and chemokines during microoganism invasion [21, 22]. In the present study, to determine if PEDV infection suppresses IFN-\u03b2 activation, we chose IECs as an infection model to research the molecular mechanisms of PEDV infection and the host antiviral innate immune response. Our results clearly suggested that PEDV prevented dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 synthesis by blocking RIG-I-mediated pathways.\n\nType I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are critical to the host antiviral innate immune response. However, there is no evidence suggesting that IECs produce type I IFNs in response to PEDV infection. Previous studies have showed that PEDV could be propagated in IECs [ 23, 24,]. To confirm whether PEDV infection could induce IFN-\u03b2 production in IECs or not, we transiently cotransfected the IFN-\u03b2/luciferase reporter plasmid (IFN-\u03b2-Luc) and the Renilla luciferase construct phRL-TK and then infected with PEDV (at an MOI of 1 or 0.1, respectively) or mock-infected for 24 h. The cells were retransfected with 1 \u03bcg of poly (I:C) as a positive inducer. As shown in Fig. 1a, IFN-\u03b2 luciferase activity enhanced markedly in positive controls, while it was almost not detected in PEDV-infected IECs. In addition, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression was hardly detected in PEDV-infected IECs similar to mock-infected group, however, it had significant expression in poly (I:C)-transfected group at the indicated times (12 h and 24 h, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1b). This result was consistent with the luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, PEDV infection of IECs did not induce IFN-\u03b2 activation.\n\nIncreasing evidence showed that viruses not only inhibit the induction of type I IFNs, but also block dsRNA-induced production of type I IFNs to escape the innate immune surveillance of the host [25-27]. To identify whether PEDV was able to inhibit dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, IFN-\u03b2-Luc was transfected into PEDV-infected and uninfected cells, respectively. The cells were retransfected with or without poly (I:C) 24 h later. As a result, activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter decreased significantly in poly (I:C)-transfected, PEDV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells transfected with poly (I:C) (Fig. 1c). It showed PEDV also inhibited poly (I:C)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction.\n\nIRF-3 and NF-\u03baB are two essential IFN-\u03b2 transcription factors. In unstimulated cells, IRF-3 is ubiquitously present in the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer, whereas NF-\u03baB is present as a homodimer or heterodimer bound to the inhibitory proteins I\u03baB in the cytoplasm [28]. Phosphorylation, which is a key step during IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation, in turn, leads to nuclear translocation. Therefore, we evaluated whether PEDV infection induced IRF-3 and p65 activation by western blot analysis. Following PEDV infection, the whole cell extracts were prepared for the indicative times, in Fig. 2a, IRF-3 still existed in the cytoplasm, and the levels of IRF-3 protein was almost equal with mock-infected cells, while the phosphorylation of IRF-3 (p-IRF-3) did not detect in the PEDV infected cells in comparision to a obviously signal in poly (I:C)-transfected cells. On the contrary, compared with the amount of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65) increased with progression of PEDV infection in the nucleus. Meanwhile, the concentration of poly (I:C)-induced p65 nuclear translocation was clearly increased. PEDV N protein was also detected in PEDV-infected cells. These data suggested that PEDV did not induce activation of IRF-3, but NF-\u03baB.\n\nWe then used luciferase reporter assay system to determine whether IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB are linked with the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production after PEDV infection. As shown in Fig. 2b, IRF-3 luciferase activity was sharply decreased in PEDV-infected cells, and poly (I:C)-induced IRF-3 activation was also inhibited by PEDV in comparison to a remarkably signal in poly (I:C)-transfected cells. However, in Fig. 2c, compared with mock-infected cells, NF-\u03baB luciferase activity significantly enhanced both in PEDV-infected and poly (I:C)-transfected cells. In addition, we found that poly (I:C)-induced activation of NF-\u03baB was not blocked by PEDV. To further identify PEDV-inhibited poly (I:C)-mediated activation of IRF-3, confocal microscopy assay was used. As a result, IRF3-GFP remained in the cytoplasm of both mock-infected (Fig. 2d. a) and PEDV-infected (Fig. 2d. b) IECs compared with poly (I:C) controls, in which clear translocation to the nucleus was observed (Fig. 2d. d). Furthermore, PEDV could block poly (I:C)-mediated IRF-3 nucleus migration (Fig. 2d. c). Taken together, our date clearly implied that PEDV impeded dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03b2 transcription primary by interfering with IRF-3 activation, but not NF-\u03baB.\n\nTBK1 and IKK\u03b5 are essential kinases for the IRF-3 activation [29]. In order to ascertain whether PEDV inhibited poly (I:C)-induced IRF-3 activation by impeding TBK1/IKK\u03b5 kinase activity, we cotransfected plasmids expressing TBK1/IKK\u03b5 kinase and a plasmid encoding the IFN-\u03b2 promoter of the luciferase reporter into infected or mock-infected IECs and retransfected the cells with or without poly (I:C) at 36 h.p.i. As show in Fig. 3, TBK1/IKK\u03b5 overexpression increased IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in both infected and mock-infected IECs, and obviously upregulation was detected in IECs transfected with poly (I:C), suggesting that PEDV failed to block TBK1/IKK\u03b5 activity. However, poly (I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in IECs overexpression of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 plasmids was significantly inhibited by PEDV. It showed that PEDV interrupting dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 production should localize upstream from TBK1/IKK\u03b5.\n\nIt is possible that PEDV blocks poly (I:C)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production by suppression of the individual molecules upstream of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 in RIG-I signaling pathway. To explore this possibility, mock- and PEDV-infected IECs were cotransfected with IPS-1 expression plasmid and IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, overexpression of IPS-1 in IECs could enhance IFN-\u03b2 luciferase activity in mock-infected cells, but it was completely inhibited in PEDV-infected cells. For the poly (I:C) transfection experiments, there appeared significant restriction of IFN-\u03b2 luciferase expression in PEDV-infected cells compared with that of mock-infected cells. These date indicated that PEDV interacted with IPS-1 to block poly (I:C)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 transcription.\n\nIPS-1 is an adapter molecule of RIG-I, the data showed that PEDV blocked IPS-1-induced IFN-\u03b2 production in dsRNA signaling pathway, thus, we speculated that RIG-I-induced IFN-\u03b2 production in this signaling pathway was also inhibited. To verify it, mock- and PEDV-infected IECs were transfected with RIG-I expression and IFN-\u03b2 reporter plasmids. The results showed that IFN-\u03b2 luciferase activity was markedly increased in IECs overexpressing RIG-I, but was completely inhibited by PEDV infection. And the IFN-\u03b2 reporter signal could be observed in IECs stimulated with poly (I:C), while this signal could be sharply reduced in RIG-I-transfected, poly (I:C)-stimulated and PEDV-infected IECs (Fig. 4b).\n\nIn summary, the findings of the present study suggested that PEDV-infection in IECs inhibits dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 induction by interfering with IRF-3 activity associated with RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway. The target interaction molecules of PEDV intervention of dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 production primarily was IPS-1. However, as a limitation to this study, host cells may inhibit or activate multiple signaling pathways simultaneously in response to exogenous stimulus, and some other transcription factors may have been blocked or activated in this process. Here, we only addressed the mechanisms of PEDV-induced inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production in relation to the molecules of RIG-I signaling pathways in vitro. Further studies are needed. Overall, elucidation of the influence of PEDV evasion of the host innate immune response will aid in the development of antiviral agents to prevent the spread of PEDV during the early infection phase.\n\nThe African green monkey kidney cell line VeroE6 and swine small intestine epithelial cells (IECs) [30, 31] were respectively cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s F12 Ham medium (DMEM-F12) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2.
