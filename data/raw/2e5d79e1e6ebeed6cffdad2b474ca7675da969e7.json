While 82 norovirus gastroenteritis is generally mild and self-limiting, older nursing home residents are 83 vulnerable to infection leading to hospitalization and death [8] , with the vast majority of 84 norovirus-associated deaths in the U.S. occurring among persons aged 65 years and older [9] . 85 Norovirus is highly transmissible in nursing homes [10] [11] [12] , but there is no vaccine or 86 specific antiviral therapy available to prevent or treat norovirus infection. As a result, rapid 87 implementation of standard control measures is the mainstay for curtailing transmission [13] . 88 Identifying factors associated with norovirus transmission is critical to better understanding 89 disease spread and preventing additional cases. Individual-level risk factors for susceptibility to 90 norovirus infection or severe disease in nursing home outbreaks have been identified, including 91 resident mobility, dependency on staff assistance [14] , immunodeficiency [15] , and statin use 92 [16] . But because transmission of norovirus from one person to another cannot be directly \n\nStatistical algorithms can be used to infer outbreak transmission trees (i.e., who infected 97 whom) from case onset dates and independent estimates of the serial interval (i.e., the time 98 between symptom onset in primary cases and the secondary cases they generate) between 99 generations of case pairs [17] . Individual reproduction numbers (R i ), or the number of secondary 100 cases an individual generates, can then be calculated for all cases. We quantified the contribution 101 of specific symptoms and residents vs. staff in norovirus transmission by examining the 102 associations between these variables and individual case infectivity, which was characterized by 103 6 104 overall aim was to inform implementation of effective norovirus prevention and control 105 measures to reduce the size and duration of norovirus outbreaks in nursing homes. We achieved 106 this aim by characterizing norovirus transmission in these settings.\n\nOutbreak data 110 De-identified data from six separate and unique nursing home outbreaks from two 111 consecutive norovirus seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) were provided by the South Carolina 112 Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). All outbreaks were confirmed, 113 meaning they had at least two laboratory confirmed norovirus cases. Outbreak data were in the 114 form of line lists and included individual-level information on symptom onset dates, reported 115 symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, and fever), age in years, sex, illness duration, hospitalization, 116 emergency department visit, and whether the case was a resident or staff. Probable cases were 117 defined as residents or staff who had at least one episode of vomiting and/or three or more loose 118 stools within a 24-hour period. Confirmed cases were probable cases with a laboratory confirmed 119 norovirus infection. As this was an analysis of anonymized data that had already been collected 120 through routine public health response, the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) 121 determined that this study was exempt from IRB review. Transmissibility of a pathogen can be quantified by its basic reproduction number, R 0 , 125 defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious individual in a This article is a US Government work.

R 0 or R E of 1 signifies the extinction threshold, below which 129 each infectious individual, on average, infects less than one other individual and the outbreak 130 cannot be maintained. R E can be converted to R 0 by dividing R E by the proportion susceptible in 131 the population. Estimates for the R 0 of norovirus vary widely, from 1.1 to 7.2, and depend on 132 differences in settings [18] .\n\nThe primary outcome of interest in this study was individual case infectiousness, which 134 we measured by estimating the reproduction number, R Ei , for each case. Here, R Ei is defined as 135 the number of secondary cases generated by an individual case i. We estimated R Ei using a 136 maximum likelihood procedure to infer the number of secondary cases generated by each case [17, 19, 20] . Briefly, this method calculates, in a statistically rigorous 144 manner, the probability that cases with earlier symptom onset dates infected cases with later 145 symptom onset dates, selects the probabilities that are greatest using the frequency distribution of 146 the serial interval, and then, using these probabilities, determines the number of secondary cases 147 produced by cases with each symptom onset date.

To investigate whether this could indicate heightened infectiousness of 152 index cases or just the natural decline of the susceptible population, we also calculated R 0i by where C is the total number susceptible on day 1 and is cumulative incidence to day i. \u2211 0 157\n\nUsing this approach, we compared estimates of R 0i of index cases on day 1 to R 0i estimated from 158 cases with onset on days 2 to 4 of the outbreak (excluding days with no reported cases). 161 We used a linear mixed model to estimate the association between each case 162 characteristic and R Ei , while accounting for correlation between R Ei 's within each outbreak. The 163 outcome variable was the natural log of R Ei .\n\nThe following information was available for cases: symptom onset date, resident/staff 165 status, age in years, sex, illness duration, hospitalization, emergency department visit, and 166 presence of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Because information on fever, age, sex, emergency 167 department visit and hospitalization were missing for large percentages of cases (20%, 23%, 168 26%, 40% and 55%, respectively), we were unable to consider these variables as potential 169 exposure, confounder, or effect modifying variables in the regression model.

To account for 172 clustering induced by correlation of R Ei 's within the six outbreaks, outbreak number was 173 included in the model as a random intercept. The full model, with log R Ei as the outcome, 174 included the following explanatory variables: diarrhea, vomiting, resident. The model was 175 assessed for collinearity and no issues were found. We considered including 'time' in the model 176 and adjusting for it as a potential confounder, as R Ei inevitably declines over time. However, we 177 determined that time cannot be a confounder, since it cannot affect diarrhea, vomiting, or 178 resident vs. staff, our explanatory variables of interest. The final model is shown below:\n\nwhere log R Eij represents the estimated log R E of the j th case from the i th outbreak, b 0i represents 183 the random slope for the i th outbreak, and e ij represents residual heterogeneity of the j th case from 184 the i th outbreak not explained by the model. The residual heterogeneity, e ij , and random slope, 185 b 0j , are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid) with mean zero and their 186 respective variances. Cases from the same outbreak were assigned the same random effect, 187 whereas cases from different outbreaks were assumed to be independent. Final coefficient 188 estimates and 95% confidence intervals were exponentiated to show the relationships between 189 average R Ei (rather than log R Ei ) and the variables in the model.\n\nIn addition to regression analyses, we also used the The original dataset consisted of 209 lab-confirmed and probable cases from six separate 200 outbreaks. One case was excluded from the estimations of R Ei and all further analyses because 201 he/she was missing an illness onset date. After the estimations of R Ei , four additional cases were 202 excluded from the regression analyses because they were missing information on diarrhea, 203 vomiting, and/or resident vs. staff. Lastly, 9 more cases (4.3% of all cases with onset date 204 information) had symptom onset dates on the last day the outbreak and thus did not produce any 205 reported secondary cases. Therefore, they had estimated R Ei 's of zero. Because log R Ei could not 206 be taken for these cases, they were excluded from all regression analyses. Sensitivity analyses 207 were performed by adding 0.01 to these R Ei estimates to examine the influence of these cases on 208 model estimates.\n\nAcross the six outbreaks, the median number of cases was 36.5 (IQR: 28.3, 44.8) and the 212 median outbreak length was 12 days (IQR: 12.0, 12.8) ( Table 1 ). All cases involved in the 213 outbreaks were either nursing home residents or staff. The majority of cases were over 80 years 214 of age (62%), female (74%), nursing home residents (76%), and had diarrhea (with or without 215 vomiting) (79%), vomiting (with or without diarrhea) (75%), or both diarrhea and vomiting This article is a US Government work.

Of the 9 cases excluded from regression analyses for having R Ei = 0, 55% were residents, 217 55% reported vomiting, and 55% reported diarrhea. All six outbreaks were caused by norovirus 218 genogroup II, two of which were confirmed as GII.4 Sydney and four of which were not 219 genotyped. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) (nine index cases in total), defined as 229 cases with onset of symptoms on day one of an outbreak, that had large estimated R Ei 's (range: 230 1.48 to 8.70) relative to other cases in the outbreak. After the index case(s), each outbreak either 231 continuously declined to a R Ei below 1 or increased again before declining to a R Ei below 1 (Fig   232   1 ). Of these index cases, at least one from each outbreak reported vomiting (Fig 2) . While most 233 index cases also reported diarrhea, outbreak 6 began with a case that reported vomiting only.

When examining R 0i values (calculated from R Ei estimates), we found that outbreaks had 250 considerably higher basic reproduction numbers based on the index case(s) (R 0,1 = 6.8, 1.5, 8.4, 251 7.3, 4.6, and 8.7 for outbreaks 1-6, respectively) compared to the median basic reproduction 252 number calculated from cases on days 2 to 4 (median R 0,2-4 = 1.7; IQR: 1.6, 2.0).\n\nCases with vomiting (with or without diarrhea) had a greater median R Ei (0.54; IQR: \n\nThis article is a US Government work.

These differences were significant for vomiting (p-267 value = 0.001) but not diarrhea (p-value = 0.23) or resident/staff status (p-value = 0.06). All 268 index cases had R Ei 's greater than 1 (median: 4.60; IQR: 1.48, 7.13).\n\nIn the final multivariable model, cases who vomited infected 2.74 (95% CI: 1.90, 3.94) 270 more individuals than non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.62 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.41) more 271 individuals than cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.69 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.42) 272 more individuals than staff-cases (Fig 3) . In sensitivity analyses where cases with R Ei = 0 were 273 included in the regression analysis, stronger associations between infectiousness and vomiting, 274 diarrhea, and resident/staff status were observed (2.96, 1.90, and 1.89, respectively). Adding a 275 dichotomous variable (index vs. non-index case) to the model indicated that index cases infected 276 6.64 (95% CI: 3.49, 12.63) more individuals than non-index cases, holding resident vs. staff, 277 diarrhea, and vomiting constant. Furthermore, we examined the associations between outbreak 278 day, counting the first illness onset date as day one, and case characteristics and found cases who 279 vomited occurred 2.7 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.6) days earlier in the outbreak than cases who did not This article is a US Government work.

The association between diarrhea and R Ei did not appear to change when 287 the assumption about serial interval length was changed (Fig 3) . secondary cases produced by a single primary case comparing: cases with vomiting to cases with 296 no vomiting, cases with diarrhea to cases with no diarrhea, and resident-cases to staff-cases. \n\nWe inferred who infected whom from outbreak line lists and investigated risk factors for 302 transmission of norovirus in nursing home outbreaks, leading to several important findings. First, This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/707356 doi: bioRxiv preprint 303 vomiting and, to a lesser degree, diarrhea play a critical role in norovirus transmission in these 304 settings. Second, outbreaks tend to start with one or more cases who infect substantially more 305 individuals than later cases in the outbreak. Third, residents, rather than staff, are the primary 306 drivers of transmission. Our findings are based on data from multiple outbreaks affecting a 307 considerable number of cases. The novel application of our modeling methods to estimate 308 reproduction numbers required few assumptions regarding norovirus transmission. Additionally, 309 our findings were generally robust to assumptions about the serial interval and 310 inclusion/exclusion criteria for cases with missing data.\n\nWhile previous studies have found that exposure to vomit is associated with an increased 312 risk of norovirus infection in nursing home residents and staff [14] , and that proximity to a 313 vomiting event is correlated with higher attack rates [23, 24] , this is the first study to find that 314 individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus 315 transmission in U.S. nursing home outbreaks. Human challenge studies have found that 316 vomiting, compared to diarrhea, is more likely to result in environmental contamination 317 potentially leading to transmission through fomites and airborne droplets [25] . In household 318 norovirus outbreaks, however, primary cases with diarrhea, but not vomiting, have been 319 associated with higher secondary attack rates [26] . This suggests that the relative importance of 320 specific symptoms in norovirus transmission may be dependent on the outbreak setting.\n\nThere is little systematic information available on norovirus introduction into nursing 322 homes [14] . Outbreak reports have shown that nursing home outbreaks often start with single 323 index cases [14] , however the relative infectiousness of index cases (compared to non-index 324 cases) has not been examined in these settings. We found that outbreaks tend to start with one or 325 more cases who infect substantially more individuals compared to later cases. There are multiple This article is a US Government work.

First, as an outbreak 327 progresses and more individuals become ill and later immune, there is a natural decrease in the 328 proportion susceptible. However, we found that index cases generally had substantially greater 329 R Ei 's compared to cases with onset dates only a few days after outbreak initiation, before a 330 sufficient number of susceptibles could accumulate to explain this pattern. We also found that 331 R 0,1 (the basic reproduction number for index cases) tended to be substantially larger than R 0,2-4 332 (the basic reproduction numbers for cases on days 2-4), even under the extreme assumptions that 333 all individuals were initially susceptible and that the total population consisted only of reported 334 cases in the outbreak. If the observed declines in R Ei had been due to a natural decrease in 335 susceptibles alone, we would expect the calculated R 0i values to remain relatively constant over 336 time. Therefore, these results suggest that index cases are more infectious than subsequent cases 337 for reasons other than the natural decreases in susceptibles alone. Second, index cases may have 338 been more infectious than non-index cases due to intrinsic case characteristics (e.g., vomiting).\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the median R Ei may be ~1.0, meaning that most cases in the outbreak are 340 only moderately infectious, but a highly infectious case is required to initiate an outbreak [27] .\n\nThird, rapid implementation of effective outbreak control measures could curtail transmission.\n\nLacking data on the timing and type of control measures, we could not explicitly account for this 343 in our calculations. Results may be due to any one of these explanations, or some combination 344 thereof. 345 U.S. nursing home residents have an increased risk of norovirus gastroenteritis [8, 14] , 346 but evidence for their relative infectiousness compared to staff was lacking. While staff clearly 347 can transmit norovirus [12, 14] , studies of nosocomial outbreaks in the Netherlands have shown 348 that symptomatic patients have the largest contribution to virus transmission in those settings This article is a US Government work.

Third, we excluded 9 cases with R Ei = 0 from the regression analyses, however 370 including them in the main regression analysis only strengthened the associations between all 371 three predictor variables and infectiousness.

Lastly, we used a serial interval distribution estimated 373 from household transmission associated with norovirus outbreaks in child daycare centers in 374 Sweden and assumed a similar serial interval in our U.S. nursing homes. Unlike transmission in 375 the households, where it was clear that the child daycare center attendee/staff infected others in 376 the home, identifying transmission pairs in nursing home outbreaks is difficult, precluding direct 377 estimation of serial intervals in these settings. The true serial interval may be longer or shorter in 378 nursing homes. Regardless, we found that our main finding of the importance of vomiting in 379 transmission was robust when using different values of the serial interval. \n\nThis article is a US Government work.
