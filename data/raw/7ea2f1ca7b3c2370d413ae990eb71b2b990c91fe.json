{"title": "Clearing the FoG: Antifungal tolerance is a subpopulation effect that is distinct from 3 resistance and is associated with persistent candidemia 4 5", "body": "( Supplementary Fig. 3e) . A series of strains derived from SC5314 by passaging were 154 particularly sensitive to media differences, with lower RAD and higher FoG levels on rich 155 medium (YPD) than on casitone medium ( Supplementary Fig. 3f ), emphasizing that assays 156 must be performed under consistent conditions to ensure reproducible results. Importantly, FoG/SMG is independent of cell density. Importantly, these results establish that FoG levels 167 represent the proportion of the population that can form colonies or grow above the MIC. area occupied by light pixels and the change in this area over time are proxies for colony size and growth rate, respectively 74 . Different C. albicans isolates exhibited different initial time of Fig. 2e,f) . Notably, the \u2206ToA (ToA on FLC -ToA without FLC) of high FoG isolates was shorter 184 than that of low FoG isolates (Fig. 2f) , and correlated with overall FoG levels (Fig. 2g) . This 185 suggests that high FoG strains overcome the inhibitory pressures of the antifungal more 186 efficiently than low FoG strains. Consistent with this, in liquid assays with drug, highly tolerant 187 isolates also displayed shorter lag times than related isolates with low tolerance levels 188 ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ).\n\nA number of C. albicans growth parameters did not correlate with FoG levels. These 190 included cell viability in the presence of drug (Fig. 2h) , consistent with FLC being fungistatic 191 rather than fungicidal. Unlike tolerant bacteria, which display reduced growth rates and longer 192 colony appearance times 2,75-77 , antifungal tolerance did not correlate with slower growth in three Decreased intracellular drug levels underlie increased tolerance. A recently developed 206 fluorescent azole probe, FLC-Cy5 81 , provides a powerful tool to monitor intracellular drug levels 207 and uptake rates using flow cytometry (Fig. 3a) . The initial rate of FLC-Cy5 uptake per cell 208 varied between strains and showed a weak inverse correlation with FoG levels (R 2 = 0.64, P = 209 0.12, Fig. 3b ). By contrast, steady state FLC-Cy5 levels at 24 h correlated inversely with FoG 210 levels (R 2 = 0.8, P < 0.01, Fig. 3c ). Cells were categorized as having low, mid, and high levels of \n\nBased on the assumption that the steady state drug levels are influenced by both drug 215 efflux and uptake, we measured efflux of rhodamine-6-G (R6G), a dye removed primarily via the 216 ABC class of transporters 82 . In general, the rate of R6G efflux was higher in the presence, than 217 in the absence, of FLC, with SC5314 as the notable exception ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig.   218   6a ). Yet, efflux rates did not correlate with FoG under any of the conditions tested 219 ( Supplementary Fig. 6b , R 2 < 0.2). Thus, the determinants of steady state intracellular FLC 220 levels are complex, and include uptake and efflux rates as well as other factors (Fig. 3g ).\n\nfluoxetine, a serotonin inhibitor 21 ; and fluphenazine, an antipsychotic drug that stimulates ABC transporter expression and indirectly inhibits calcineurin via calmodulin 23,28,95 . FLC + adjuvant 233 cleared tolerance for all 7 clinical isolates tested (Fig. 4a,b) , as well as for a longitudinal series 234 from a single HIV patient 96,97 that had acquired resistance over time, and for a set of persistent 235 and non-persistent clinical isolates ( Supplementary Fig. 7a-d) . Importantly, most adjuvants had 236 little or no effect on RAD/MIC levels (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 7a- \n\nTaken together, these experiments demonstrate that tolerance is an intrinsic property distinct 302 from drug susceptibility, and that tolerance levels correlate with infections that resist azole 303 treatment in the clinic.\n\nCurrently, decisions about therapeutic strategies to treat Candida infections are based 307 upon patient status, infecting species and antifungal susceptibility, with clinical MIC assays 308 All rights reserved.
