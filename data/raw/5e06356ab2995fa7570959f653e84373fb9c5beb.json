{"title": "A Quantitative Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Away for Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BHV-1) Antibody", "body": "Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-11, also known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis+fectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR-IPV) virus is associated with a wide variety of clinical entities including respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, vulvovaginitis, abortion and less commonly encephalitis and generalized systemic infection.18 It is one of the most important agents of bovine respiratory disease, either directly or as a predisposing factor for bacterial infection, most commonly Pasteurella haemolytica.32 Several procedures have been used for the detection of BHV-1 antibody in cattle sera including indirect fluorescence' indirect hemagglutinationz3 reverse passive hemagglutination\" and, complement fixation. Although serum neutralization @NT) is accepted as the standard test and is commonly performed for the serological diagnosis of BHV-1 infections3~7~21~26 it is slow and requires expensive cell culture facilities. The advent of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has enabled more rapid and sensitive quantitative detection of I@6,9,14,20,29 and IgM antibodies.15 Several workers2*4'10*17*26 have demonstrated that ELISAs employing a single dilution of serum can be standardized and correlate well with other serological assays.\n\nSince it is necessary to detect latent carriers in BHV-1 control schemes and to demonstrate freedom from antibodies for animal certification in international trade, it is now imperative to have an international standard test with an agreed system of result expression.\n\nHowever, the currently used standard SNT is not well defined and the ELISA still suffers a major drawback of lack of uniformity in result expression.13T19 This paper describes work to provide a simple adaptable quantitative means of result expression and also to provide guidelines for international standardisation of testing for BHV-1 antibodies.\n\nAttempts were made to obtain standard positive and negative international reference sera against BHV-1 but none could be traced.\n\nThe The virus used for these injections had infectivity titres of 8-l or 8.9 logic TCIDsdml.\n\nThe calf was bled 10 days after the last injection. The standard negative serum was a preinoculation serum from the same calf.\n\nA total of 370 serum samples submitted to the Moredun Research Institute for analysis from different parts of Scotland were used in the study. One hundred and twenty six samples were paired sera collected from 63 animals at the time of respiratory disease (acute phase serum) and three to four weeks later (convalescent phase sera). The remaining sera were collected from 244 different animals which were bled once. All sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and stored in small aliquots at -20\u00b0C before use. The sera were tested in the SNT and IgG ELISA by independent operators before the results of each test were compared.\n\nA semicontinuous cell line of embryonic bovine trachea (EBTr) cells was used for virus growth as previously described.28\n\nThe '6660' field strain of IBR virus was used after four passages including three plaque purifications, for the preparation of both the SNT and ELISA antigens according to the methods of Hebert et al. (1985) .ls Control ELISA antigen was prepared in the same way from uninfected EBTr cells.\n\nHorseradish-peroxidase (HRPO)-conjugated heavy chain specific rabbit-anti-bovine IgGi, IgGs and IgM were obtained (Nordic Immunological Laboratories Ltd). Equal volumes (50 ~1) of heavy chain specific anti-bovine IgGi and anti-bovine IgGs were mixed22 and used at an optimal predetermined diIution for testing alI sera. Only selected sera were tested for IgM antibodies with the anti-bovine IgM conjugate.\n\nThe substrate was 40 mg orthophenylene diamine (OPD) (Sigma) per 100 ml of citrate phosphate buffer pH 5 (0.1 M citric acid, O-2 M NasHPOd) containing 10 ~1 of 30% hydrogen peroxide (HsOs).\n\nThe infected cell lysate was used as the BHV-1 antigen for the ELISA. Flat-bottomed 96-welI poly-vinyl plates (Cooke M129A Dynatech Laboratories, Billinghurst, Sussex) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 $/well of BHV-1 antigen at an appropriate predetermined dilution in 50 mM carbonatebicarbonate buffer pH 9.6. The wells in column one were not coated and were used as a blank in each plate. During the assay, standard positive and negative test sera and conjugate were diluted in 0.5 M sodium chloride buffered to pH 7.2 with 0.1 M phosphate, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% ovalbumin. A standard positive serum was made up in 8 four-fold dilutions between l/16 and l/262144 for the standard curve. 50 ~1 volumes of each dilution in duplicate were transferred into the wells of column two and three, and 50 ~1 volumes of the negative standard serum into column four of each plate. Each test sample was tested in duplicate (in row) at a single dilution of l/50 and the plates incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a humid box. After washing, 50 ,ul of the appropriately diluted HRPO-conjugated rabbit-anti-bovine IgGi + IgGs or IgM conjugate was added to wells of column two to twelve, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.\n\nAfter the final washing step, 100 ~1 of OPD was added to each well. The reaction was stopped after 40 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C in the dark by addition of 25 ~1 of 2.5 M sulphuric acid. The optical density (OD) was read at 492 nm wavelength (against substrate/acid blank) in a multichannel recorder (Titertek Multiscan Flow Laboratories) interfaced to a BBC computer and Epson FX-80 printer (Acorn Computer Ltd, Cambridge, U.K.) using a Titertek Multiskan interface (Flow Laboratories) and a 3187 serial interface type 312B (Flow Laboratories).\n\nThe computer programme was designed to fit data from the standard curve to a second polynominal equation.8\n\nOptical density versus reciprocal of dilution of standard were used in the equation: y = a + b (logx) + c (lo&)' where y = optical density, ;1c = reciprocal of dilution of the standard positive serum, a = value of y intercept, b = slope of the line and c = constant. The titre of the standard serum was taken as being equal to the number of units of antibody contained therein. The level of antibody in the test sera was derived directly from the equation and expressed as ELISA units.\n\nVirus neutralizing antibody assay was carried out using the modified serum neutralization test described by Bitsch (1978) in a microtitre plate system using approximately 100 TCIDSO of the '6660' strain IBR virus. The overall agreement between the two tests was 90.5%.\n\nBecause it was considered likely that the positive result in the SNT was due to the presence of IgM, the 21 sera which were IgGl + IgGs ELISA negative/SNT positive were tested for the presence of IgM by ELISA. All but 2 were positive by IgM ELISA. Combining the IgM ELISA results with the IgGr + IgGs ELISA results increased the sensitivity and overall agreement between the ELISA and SNT (Table 3) .\n\nOf the paired serum samples tested it was found that 3 pairs had shown significant seroconversion in the SNT test. All three also showed significant seroconversion in the IgGl + IgGs ELISA (Table 4 ).\n\nThe regression analysis and correlation coefficient of the results from the IgGr and IgGs ELISA and SNT on positive sera are shown in Fig. 1 . There was a very good positive correlation coefficient (r = 0.86, at P << 0.001) between the ELISA and SNT (for the 98 serum samples with ELISA units ~50) when data were subjected to simple linear regression analysis and the non-parametric rank correlation by the Spearman method.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to develop a simple rapid ELISA capable of providing results which can be evaluated and compared between laboratories for the testing of sera in IBR control schemes and for the screening of animals for international trade prior to export and after importation.\n\nAlthough the SNT is the accepted test for screening animals for international trade, it is recognized to suffer from interference by non-antibody neutralizing factors in some sera.ll*l\"\n\nOther disadvantages include slowness and requirement for expensive cell culture facilities, and so far there is no single established test protocol. Many laboratories now use ELISA routinely for diagnosis of BHV-1 infections.\n\nHowever, the major drawbacks hindering the recommendation of ELISA for adoption as an international standard test are the great variation in the ELISA techniques and the dif&ulties likely to be experienced with standardization between laboratories, together with the lack of any agreed system of expression of results. 13 The system of standardization adopted in the ELISA developed in the present study was the inclusion of a series of eight appropriate standard positive reference serum dilutions, and eight replicates of a standard negative reference serum on each plate to compensate for interplate variations associated with variable incubation times, temperature etc. As previously pointed out, 24 the quantitation of the results by comparing the activity of the serum samples to that of a standard reference serum in each test plate gives an opportunity to standardize the test not only within one laboratory but also between several laboratories.\n\nWe have clearly shown a good positive correlation between the SNT and the ELISA (r = 0.86). Both tests were able to detect animals exposed to BHV-1 with a high degree of accuracy and agreement when cut-off values were fixed i.e. by excluding sera with low SNT titre (cl:41 and low ELISA titre (<50 units) in the comparison of the two tests. As widely acknowledged by othersso*31 at low discrimination dilutions of some sera, the ELISA may be positive when there is no discernible activity in the SNT. It is also known that such low SNT titres of <1:2 or 1:4 are difficult to assess in an SNT.\" Therefore, to formulate guidelines for standardized ELISA for BHV-1 serology particular considerations should be given to the provision and availability of an international control reference serum or preferably a battery of sera such as the ones which exist for coronavirus (WHO reference serum), Brucellosis or Toxoplasmosis together with a standard antigen, labelled antiglobulin sera, and specification of a standard ELISA protocol with a single internationally agreed system for the expression of results which is readily comparable between laboratories."}
