{"title": "Alterations in sialic-acid O-acetylation glycoforms during murine erythrocyte development", "body": "Sialic acid, a monosaccharide with a nine-carbon backbone, is widely found in nature as a terminal sugar of animal and microbial glycoproteins and glycolipids. It plays important roles in animal development, cellular recognition processes and host-pathogen interactions (Schauer, 2009) . A common modification of sialic acid is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition and ganglioside biology. The hemagglutinins or hemagglutinin-esterases of type C influenza viruses and certain nidoviruses specifically recognize the 9-O-acetylated form of sialic acid, and this form of sialic acid is required for the entry of these viruses into human cells. Although we had previously inferred a role for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in regulating Siglec-2 (Cariappa et al., 2009) , we have demonstrated that many of the phenotypes on the basis of which earlier conclusions were made, actually resulted from a mutation that was traceable to a commercially available C57BL/6 strain of mice (Mahajan et al., 2016) . , 2015) . Their studies implicated CASD1 in directly transferring acetyl moieties from acetyl-CoA to CMP-sialic acid. Whether CMP-sialic acid is the preferred substrate for the O-acetylation of sialic acid in vivo however remains to be established. In this report, we describe a mouse strain in which Casd1 has been deleted in the germline. Analysis of these mice demonstrated the loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid on the surface of all hematopoietic cells examined. Based on the differential specificity of hemagglutinin O-acetylated sialic acid found on the surface of murine myeloid cells may decorate this glycoprotein. Indeed, mucin-like glycoproteins such as CD43 and CD45RB have been shown to bear 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on mononuclear cells in the spleen (Krishna and Varki, 1997) . No detectable 9-O-acetyl sialic acid was found on the CD11b + CD43 + population in the bone marrows of Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1C) . A large proportion of CD43 + CD11bnon-myeloid cells, largely hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow, also express surface 9-O-acetyl sialic acid in wild type mice but this was completely lost in Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1C) .\n\nWe found no detectable levels of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid on B220 + CD93 + transitional B cells, B220 + CD19 + CD21 lo IgM + follicular B cells and CD21 hi IgM hi marginal zone B cells in the spleen of wild-type (C57BL/6J) or Casd1-deficient ( Fig 1D) . We also analyzed B220 + B cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes, and found no detectable levels of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid on these cells in wild-type or Casd1-deficient mice . CD4 + T cells express high levels of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (Fig 2A) , which is partly on mucin-type glycoproteins and partly on gangliosides (Krishna and Varki, 1997) .\n\nWe found that naive CD44 lo CD62L hi CD4 + T cells had higher levels of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid than CD44 hi CD62L lo effector memory CD4 + T cells (Fig 2C) . The 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid normally observed on both naive and memory wild-type CD4 + T cells in the spleen was completely lost in Casd1-deficient mice (Figs 2A & 2C) . The 9-O-acetyl sialic acid on wild-type CD4 + T cells was also eliminated by influenza C hemagglutinin esterase (CHE-Fc) treatment (Fig 2D) .\n\n.

Surprisingly, Casd1-deficient erythrocytes, which lack 9-O-acetyl sialic acid based on the lack of binding to CHE-FcD, also lost reactivity to TER-119, suggesting that this antibody may recognize a 9-O-acetyl sialic acid glyco-epitope (Fig 3A) . A previous study on the identification of the target of TER-119 suggested that this antibody can immunoprecipitate proteins of 110 kDa, 60 kDa, 52 kDa and 32 kDa from the erythrocyte membrane (Kina et al., 2000) . Of these, only the 52 kDa protein was detectable in a Western Blot using TER-119. However, the identity of this protein was not deciphered, and it was suspected to be a glycophorin A associated molecule.\n\nErythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow can be identified based on CD71 and TER-119 staining and are divided into the Ery-A (TER-119 + CD71 + FSC hi ), Ery-B (TER-119 + CD71 + FSC lo ) and Ery-C (TER-119 + CD71 -FSC lo ) flow cytometric fractions based on CD71, TER-119 and forward scatter (FSC) (Fig 3B) (Chen et al., 2009; Koulnis et al., 2011) . We found that surface 9-O-acetyl sialic acid identified using CHE-FcD staining appears only at the most mature Ery-C stage in the erythroid lineage. We did not observe any CD71 positive cells that lacked TER-119 in the wild-type mouse bone marrow, suggesting that CD71 and FSC alone could be used to identify the Ery-A and Ery-B erythroblast fractions in the bone marrow of Casd1-deficient mice (that lack the TER-119 epitope) ( Fig 3B) . As in wild-type mice, in the bone marrow of Casd1-deficient mice, there was also no detectable surface 9-O-acetylation on CD71 + Ery-A and Ery-B erythroid progenitors based upon staining with CHE-FcD ( Fig 3B) . Our flow cytometry analysis suggests that Casd1-deficient mice exhibit a pan-hematopoietic loss of 9-O-.

However, the Ery-A and Ery-B erythroid precursors that normally express the TER-119 epitope in wild-type mice do not express any 9-O-acetyl sialic acid that is detectable by CHE-FcD staining. Therefore, we decided to examine the relationship between 9-O-acetyl sialic acid and the TER-119 epitope in greater detail. The hemagglutinin-esterase from bovine coronavirus Mebus strain (BHE) also recognizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acid, but in a manner that is structurally distinct from CHE (Zeng et al., 2008) . Furthermore, unlike CHE, the BHE lectin recognizes 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid in addition to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Langereis et al., 2015; Bakkers et al., 2016) . Therefore, we expressed BHE as an Fcfusion protein (BHE-Fc) analogous to the approach used to generate CHE-Fc. In addition, we also generated a catalytically inactive form of BHE-Fc bearing the S40A substitution (BHE-Fc-S40A) whose ability to bind 9-O-acetyl sialic acids is unhindered as previously described (Zeng et al., 2008) . We found that the TER-119 + CD71 + Ery-A and Ery-B precursors from wild-type mice exhibited strong staining with BHE-Fc-S40A but not with CHE-FcD (Fig 3B and 4A) . This suggested to us that the TER-119 epitope may be recognized by the BHE virolectin but not by CHE. We next used murine RBCs to examine the interactions of the TER-119 epitope with CHE and BHE. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/469254 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4B). Yet, the TER-119 epitope on murine erythrocytes was surprisingly resistant to treatment with CHE ( Fig 4B) . As a control, and as previously shown by Varki et al., we also showed that CHE-Fc pre-treatment completely eliminated CHE-FcD binding on CD4 + T lymphocytes (Fig 2D) . Interestingly, the TER-119 epitope on murine RBCs was sensitive to BHE-Fc but not CHE-Fc esterase treatment (Fig 4B) . In contrast, pretreatment with an enzymatically inactive version of BHE-Fc bearing the S40A catalytic site mutation (BHE-S40A-Fc) had a negligible effect on TER-119 staining (data not shown).\n\nHowever, in the setting of a competitive binding assay, the lectin domain of BHE modestly hampered TER-119 binding to its epitope in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig   4C) . Given that both CHE and BHE have evolved as receptor-destroying enzymes that recognize 9-O-acetyl sialic acids, it was not surprising that both CHE-Fc and BHE-Fc pre-treatment of mouse RBCs was able to eliminate the corresponding virolectin receptor binding (Fig 4D) . Although treatment with BHE-Fc completely eliminated CHE-FcD binding, CHE only partially eliminated BHE-S40A-Fc binding (Fig 4D) . These data are consistent with the notion that the BHE virolectin and enzyme has the ability to recognize modified 9-O-acetyl sialic acid ligands that are not recognized by CHE. Since BHE has been shown to bind to 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid while CHE cannot (Langereis et al., 2015; Bakkers et al., 2016) , our results support the notion that 7,9 di-O-acetyl sialic acid is a component of the TER-119 epitope and is expressed in the erythroid lineage from the Ery-A stage onwards.\n\nPrior studies of Baumann et al have shown that CASD1 catalyzes the transfer of acetyl moieties from acetyl-CoA to CMP-sialic acid through the formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate (Baumann et al., 2015) .

The authors proposed that the 9-O-acetylated CMPsialic acid is subsequently incorporated into sialoglycans.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/469254 doi: bioRxiv preprint Based on our analysis of the differential binding or inactivation of the TER-119 epitope by BHE and CHE virolectins and receptor-destroying esterases, the TER-119 antibody appears to recognize an epitope bearing 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid. The analysis of the ligand-bound structures of BHE and CHE shows that although there is some structural homology between the two hemagglutinins, they bind the 9-O-acetyl sialic acid ligand in opposite orientations (Zeng et al., 2008) . Thus, it is theoretically possible that the conformation of the specific 9-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform recognized by TER-119 is sterically constrained in the context of a particular glycan that favors binding and recognition by BHE over CHE. Although both BHE and CHE are lectins fused to receptor-destroying enzymes, it is particularly interesting that the esterase and hemagglutinin activities appear to have evolutionarily converged at the level of the specific glyco-conformations of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids. Thus study reveals an additional layer of complexity and diversity among the O-acetylated sialic acids and establishes the developmental regulation of the sequential acquisition of two different forms of 9-Oacetyl sialic acid during murine erythroid differentiation.\n\n.
