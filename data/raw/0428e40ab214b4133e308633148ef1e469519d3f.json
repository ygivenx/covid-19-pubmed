{"title": "Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus of Pigs and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus", "body": "The life cycles of TGEV and PEDV consist of virion attachment and entry, viral RNA translation, viral RNA replication and transcription, virion assembly and release (Fig. 2) . Virion attachment to a host cell requires the interaction between viral S protein with cellular receptors. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a major receptor for TGEV. However, whether APN is an essential receptor for PEDV is debatable. PEDV S protein can bind to sialic acid on the cell surface that may mediate virion attachment. After receptor binding, the S protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage that in turn induces membrane fusion and virion entry. Viral RNA with a 5\u2032 cap structure and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail serves as an mRNA that is translated by cellular translation machinery to generate viral replicase proteins pp1a and pp1ab. Replication and transcription complexes formed by these proteins produce both genomic and subgenomic progeny RNA species. Structural and accessory proteins are translated from subgenomic RNAs. Nucleocapsids formed by the N protein and progeny viral genomic RNA are enveloped in the endoplasmic reticulum -Golgi intermediate compartment with the involvement of S, E, and M proteins. The assembled virions are transported to the cell surface and released. Epidemiology TGEV, first described in 1946 in USA, has been detected all over the world. PEDV was first isolated in 1978 in Belgium and is widespread in Europe and Asia ever since. The appearance of PEDV in North America was reported in 2013 where the virus continues to circulate in swine herds and there is a potential for new PEDV strains to emerge.\n\nBoth TGEV and PEDV cause enteritis in pigs with very similar clinical symptoms. Major clinical signs include vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss. The mortality rate can reach greater than 90% and is inversely related to the age of pigs. Penetration and uncoating occur after the S protein-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Following disassembly, the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm and immediately translated to yield replicases ppla and pp1ab. These polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved into 16 nsps comprising the replication and transcription complex (RTC) that first engages in the minus-strand RNA synthesis using genomic RNA. Both full-and sub genomic (sg)-length minus strands are produced and used to synthesize full-length genomic RNA and sg mRNAs. Each sg mRNA is translated to yield only the protein encoded by the 5'-most ORF of the sg mRNA. The envelope S, E, and M proteins are inserted in the ER and anchored in the Golgi apparatus. The N protein interacts with newly synthesized genomic RNA to form helical RNP complexes. The progeny virus is assembled by budding of the preformed RNP at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and then released by the exocytosis-like fusion of smoothwalled, virion-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane.

Viral infection causes cell death that results in villous atrophy followed by malabsorption, diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, and eventually animal death. The molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis are not very well understood. There is evidence to suggest that viral proteins, such as spike and ORF3 proteins may affect viral virulence. At the molecular level, TGEV and PEDV have been shown to modulate multiple cellular processes/pathways including endoplasmic reticulum stress, cell cycle, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.\n\nBecause clinical signs cannot distinguish between TGEV and PEDV infections, additional assays are required for diagnosis. Common diagnostic assays include viral antigen detection by histoimmunochemistry and enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay (ELISA), viral RNA detection and genotyping by PCR and sequencing, virus isolation by cell culture, as well as antibody detection by serology.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for TGEV and PEDV infections.\n\nEnhanced biosecurity procedures are a general means to contain the spread and prevent the entrance of viral infection in pig farms, but vaccination represents the most effective way in preventing TGEV and PEDV outbreaks. Because of high mortality in piglets, it has become a common practice to vaccinate sows in order to transfer lactogenic immunity to protect piglets from TGEV and PEDV infections. Live attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines have been developed for both TGEV and PEDV. Since the spike protein is the major immunogen, numerous technologies have been employed to express the spike protein. These include DNA vaccine, vectored vaccine, subunit vaccine, and dendritic cell-based vaccine. Experimental and commercial TGEV and PEDV vaccines are listed in Table 1 . "}
