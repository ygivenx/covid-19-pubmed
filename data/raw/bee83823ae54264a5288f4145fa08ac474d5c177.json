{"title": "Detection of COPD Exacerbations and Compliance With Patient-Reported Daily Symptom Diaries Using a Smartphone- Based Information System", "body": "the Research Ethics Board of St. Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton (RP07-2864).\n\nThe inclusion criteria were age \u0546 40 years, ability to communicate in English, COPD diagnosis and meeting criteria for GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stages I to IV classifi cation, current or ex-smoker with a minimum 10 pack-years of exposure, previous demonstration of , 20% reversibility in FEV 1 or an increase in FEV 1 of , 200 mL after inhalation of 200 m g of salbutamol, willingness to provide informed consent, and residing in a noninstitutional domicile without current plans to transfer to institutional care. The exclusion criteria were signifi cant comorbidity that would interfere with the participant's ability to complete the study protocol, including use of a BlackBerry; planning to be away for a signifi cant part of the study; or a history of asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis.\n\nParticipants meeting the inclusion criteria underwent a baseline assessment, including clinical history, spirometry, BODE (BMI, airfl ow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index calculation, completion of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and collection of samples of sputum and nasal brushings for virologic testing and blood for measurement of C-reactive protein titer. During the study, participants' medical care remained with their own physicians.\n\nAt enrollment, participants were provided with and trained in the use of model 8700 BlackBerry Smartphones (BlackBerry) controlled and monitored centrally. Functions of the BlackBerrys not needed for the study were disabled. Participants were alerted when a new daily diary (e-Appendix 1) was delivered to their BlackBerry. When all daily questions had been answered, diaries were encrypted and transmitted wirelessly to a data server. Flags were programmed to alert staff when one or more symptoms moved up two levels of severity on a given day; any symptom reached its worst level on a given day; or a participant reported a health-system encounter for a respiratory problem, reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, had not transmitted two sequential daily diaries, or requested contact by staff.\n\nParticipants whose diaries met one of the aforementioned criteria were contacted by a study nurse and were asked, using lay terminology, to confi rm whether they thought their breathlessness was worse than the usual day-to-day variation; they had an increase in sputum volume and/or sputum purulence; and/or medical attention, if sought, was sought for \"breathing problems\"; and/or a respiratory infection was probable.\n\nIf a new possible exacerbation was confi rmed, a meeting with a study nurse in the participant's home was scheduled for as soon as possible. During these, participants underwent postbronchodilator spirometry (SpiroPro, BTL Inc) and had specimens of sputum and nasal brushings (both nostrils) taken for virologic analysis. The participants were notifi ed that three supplementary questions (e-Appendix 1) would appear in their daily diary to determine if prednisone, antibiotic, or both were taken or if breathing had returned to normal on a given day. When this occurred, supplementary questions were removed by remote command from the daily diary.\n\nDuring hospitalizations, staff met with the participants as soon as medically acceptable. With the approval of attending physicians, participants continued their diary submissions while in hospital.\n\nThe severity of COPD exacerbations by the Anthonisen criteria 23 was assessed by a COPD nurse. Exacerbation length was defi ned with higher rates of hospitalization for COPD, 16 suggesting that school attendance fosters the transmission of respiratory infections between children and adults. Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) coincide with a substantial proportion of COPD exacerbations. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In a previous study, we used faxed daily symptom diaries to monitor patients with COPD over a single winter period. 22 Of 111 exacerbations meeting the Anthonisen criteria, 23 only one was not detected during its occurrence. However, the fax-based system requires high levels of patient support by staff and data transmission that could only occur at a single location.\n\nOur primary objective in this study was to determine whether 95% or more of all exacerbations in a cohort of patients with COPD could be detected using secure devices that could be used anywhere, would be well accepted by patients, and would require modest staff support and enable collection of supplementary information when exacerbations occur. Our secondary objective was to confi rm our previous observation 22 that COPD exacerbations are more frequent during the Christmas period than at other times of the year.\n\nThis was a prospective, observational study of a cohort of patients with COPD of mixed disease severity over a maximum period of 17 months. The study was conducted between December 1, 2007, and April 30, 2009.\n\nStudy participants were recruited from the clinics of respiratory specialists or were referred by primary-care physicians in the region of Hamilton, Canada. This study was approved by Fisher Scientifi c Inc). Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 m L of homogenized sputum using the MagNA Pure LC 2.0 system (Hoffman-La Roche Inc) following the manufacturer's instructions. Two hundred microliters of the nasal phosphate-buffered saline were extracted without further manipulation using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA instrument and the Viral NA Small Volume Extraction Kit (Hoffman-La Roche Inc). Elution volume was set at 100 m L. Virologic testing was undertaken using real-time polymerase chain reaction against a panel of viral targets: infl uenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfl uenza virus types 1 to 3, adenovirus, human rhinovirus, the four currently circulating human coronavirus types (229E, OC43, NL-63, and HK-1), human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus. Real-time polymerase chain reaction against a cellular gene transcript, RNAseP, was used as a measure of specimen quality, and an extraction control, MS2 RNA phage, was added to each specimen during extraction.\n\nOf 166 potential participants identifi ed through chart review, 65 declined eligibility assessment, 51 were ineligible (see e-Appendix 2 for details), and 50 were recruited. One participant withdrew after assessment but before beginning the study. Forty-nine participants provided data between December 1, 2007, and November 30, 2008, and one died during the period. The study was extended from December 1, 2008, to April 30, 2009. Forty-six of the original participants continued through the extension period. One hundred forty-one new candidates were identifi ed; 66 declined eligibility assessment, and 45 were ineligible (e-Appendix 2). During the second study period, fi ve participants died. Seventy-one people completed the study extension. Demographic and clinical as the period between the date on which an exacerbation was confi rmed and the date on which the participant reported a return to normal breathing.\n\nAs in a prior study, 22 we defi ned the Christmas COPD epidemic period as December 1 to January 17. This includes the period of frequent social activity before, during, and after both Christmas (December 25) and the Orthodox Christmas on January 7 (Ontario has a signifi cant population of Orthodox Christian heritage) and an arbitrary 10-day period following that for related symptom episode development. The \"rest of winter\" was defi ned as January 18 to April 30, and the third study period was May 1 to November 30.\n\nAssessment of compliance with the completion of daily diary questionnaires and the detection of COPD exacerbations are descriptive. Secondary analyses compared the annualized rates of COPD exacerbation and the proportion of exacerbations coinciding with RVIs during two Christmas periods, two rest-of-winter periods, and the period from May 1, 2008, to November 30, 2008. Differences in exacerbation rates between periods were tested using a x 2 test, in which the observed rate of exacerbations/participant-year was compared with the number expected across all time periods or between the Christmas and rest-of-winter periods. Exacerbation length and Anthonisen scores with and without the presence of RVIs were examined using a Student t test. To determine whether there was a difference among the symptom levels before, during, and after an exacerbation, daily diary data for questions 1 to 4 (e-Appendix 1) were analyzed with a repeated-measures analysis of variance with two factors: before/during/after and question. The analysis was repeated for the before and after scores only to determine if symptom levels returned to baseline after an exacerbation.\n\nSputum samples were homogenized by shaking for 15 min after the addition of an equal volume of SPUTASOL (Thermo Table 1 \n\nSubject Characteristics GOLD I (n 5 1) and II (n 5 39) GOLD III (n 5 28) and IV (n 5 11) a course of prednisone during an exacerbation than were those in GOLD I and II. The former participants' exacerbations were also longer on average; however, they experienced minimal reductions from baseline in their percentage of predicted FEV 1 , whereas those in GOLD I and II had an average drop of 7%. The mean average symptom score across questions 1 to 4 was 1.97 preexacerbation and 1.99 postexacerbation. The difference was not signifi cant (F 5 2 0.59, P 5 .44).\n\nThe rate of exacerbations during the Christmas period (3.3/participant-year) was higher than in the other two periods (2.5/participant-year for the rest of winter and 1.8/participant-year for the rest of the year) The difference between exacerbation rates during the Christmas period and the rest of the year was signifi cant ( x 2 5 17.2, P , .0001). The difference between exacerbation rates during the Christmas period and the rest of winter alone was not signifi cant ( x 2 5 2.26, not signfi cant). Characteristics of exacerbations in the three study periods are shown in Table 3 .\n\nBaseline: Nasal-fl uid samples were obtained from all 80 participants, and sputum specimens from 48. characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1 .\n\nParticipants transmitted all but 26 of 28,514 possible daily diaries. Participants completed their diaries on 176 of 191 inpatient hospital days (92%).\n\nOne hundred ninety-two participant encounters were initiated for possible COPD exacerbations, with 191 events meeting the Anthonisen criteria (101 type 1, 57 type 2, 33 type 3); in the remaining event, the participant experienced worsened dyspnea and an antibiotic was ordered. Physician visits for breathing problems occurred during 122 exacerbations (64%) ( Table 2 ) . Overall, the rate of exacerbations observed was 2.54/participant-year. During 148 of 191 exacerbations (78%), participants were hospitalized and/or began oral prednisone, an antibiotic, or both (1.97/patient-year).\n\nThe median length of the 173 exacerbations in which participants reported a return to normal breath ing before the end of the study was 10.0 (interquartile range, 14.0 days). Participants in GOLD III and IV categories were twice as likely to be prescribed a degree that may not be possible in a multicenter study. However, a BlackBerry-based system has been used in other COPD studies, including a large, multicountry clinical trial, with 91% compliance. 24 Our participants reported when their breathing returned to normal after an exacerbation using a supplementary BlackBerry diary question. Analysis of diary symptom data established that this self-assessment was accurate, suggesting that assessments of their respiratory health by patients with COPD are perceptive. The Christmas period, as we defi ned it, involves an elevated exacerbation risk for patients with COPD, but this was not signifi cant compared with the rest of winter. Since this study was completed, two reports of seasonal patterns of COPD exacerbations in major clinical trials, TORCH 15 and Prevention of Exacerbations With Tiotropium in COPD (POET-COPD), have been published. 25 In both, in the northern hemisphere exacerbations occurred most frequently in December and January. The original characterization of a Christmas peak in COPD exacerbations 12 examined data for 209,274 ED presentations for COPD in Ontario, Canada, over a 4-year period (summary data provided in e- Table 1 ). In every year, the last week of the year from Christmas Day to New Year's Eve had the highest number of events. That the existence of a specifi c Christmas effect as opposed to an elevated risk over the broader period can only be demonstrated in large administrative data sets suggests that preparing patients with COPD for the risks One baseline nasal-fl uid specimen (2.5%) and seven baseline sputum specimens (15%) were virus positive, all for rhinovirus.\n\nExacerbations: Nasal-fl uid samples were obtained during all 191 confi rmed COPD exacerbations and sputum samples during 141 (74%). Respiratory viruses were present in 78 of 191 of the COPD exacerbations (41%) ( Table 4 ). Forty-fi ve nasal specimens (24%) and 58 sputum specimens (45%) were positive for one or more viruses.\n\nExacerbations coinciding with RVIs, in which a return to normal breathing occurred before the end of the study, lasted an average of 12.0 days, compared with 8.9 days without RVIs ( t 5 2.06, P 5 .04) ( Fig 1 ) . Anthonisen scores for episodes with virus present and absent were 1.52 (SD, 0.71) and 1.73 (SD, 0.78), respectively ( t 5 1.87, P 5 .06).\n\nWe have shown that, over an extended period of time, patients with COPD will provide daily respiratoryhealth data with near-perfect compliance using BlackBerry devices. In interpreting this fi nding, one must keep in mind the possibility that this study population was biased toward participants more confi dent in using electronic devices. The study team was also assiduous in maintaining oversight of participants to Table 3 nasal-fl uid and sputum viruses were different, or only found in one type of sample, confi rming that the role of RVIs in COPD symptom exacerbations should include examination of both nasal fl uid and sputum. The only virus detected in specimens taken at recruitment was rhinovirus, found in one nasal-fl uid sample of winter as a whole, but not the Christmas season specifi cally, would be prudent.\n\nWe detected one or more respiratory viruses in 41% of exacerbations. Viruses were more likely to be detected in sputum than in nasal fl uid, as has been reported previously. 21, 26 In a majority of cases, the a In addition, combinations of viruses were detected in fi ve exacerbations, two in which coronavirus was present in nasal fl uid and rhinovirus in sputum, one in which respiratory syncytial virus was present in nasal fl uid and human metapneumovirus in sputum, one in which adenovirus was present in nasal fl uid and human rhinovirus in sputum, and one in which adenovirus and coronavirus were both present in sputum . and seven sputum samples. Recruitment occurred in the fall, a period when rhinovirus is most common, 27 and we conclude that the positive participants had colds at the time. Exacerbations coinciding with RVIs took longer to resolve than those without RVIs, consistent with fi ndings in other studies, 26,28 but were no more severe based on Anthonisen scores.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of BlackBerry-based technology permitted early and complete detection of COPD exacerbations. Such technologies may foster the adoption of patient-reported outcomes and symptom-based measures in clinical studies and facilitate early detection of deterioration in high-risk patients with COPD in regular clinical practice. However, for this to occur, the effectiveness of the approach must be evaluated in a full spectrum of patients with COPD.\n\nAuthor contributions : Mr Johnston is responsible for the integrity of the manuscript and the study data.
