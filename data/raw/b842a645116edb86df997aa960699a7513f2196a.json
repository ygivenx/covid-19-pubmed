{"title": "Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020", "body": "The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic started with a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China back in December 2019 (1, 2). The initial cases have been linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, pointing to an animal source of the epidemic (3) . Subsequently, rapid humanto-human transmission of the disease was confirmed in January 2020, and the etiological agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV discovered in 2003 (4, 5) . The total global case tally has reached 95,333 infections including 3282 deaths and involving 85 countries as of March 5, 2020 (6) . As the virus continues to spread in the human population, obtaining an accurate \"real-time\" picture of the epidemic's trajectory is complicated by several factors including reporting delays and changes in the case definition (7, 8) . Although (2) . Therefore, detailed epidemiological data from these countries is needed to monitor transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time.\n\nOutside of China, Singapore is one of the hardest hit countries with the COVID-19 epidemic (9), reporting its first symptomatic imported case (a 66 years old Chinese male) on January 23, 2020 (10). st, including 24 reported case importations from Wuhan China and one non-Wuhan related case importation (9, 11). Imported cases include six individuals who were evacuated from China between January 30 and February 9, 2020 (12, 13). On February 4, 2020, the Ministry of Health of Singapore reported its first local cluster of COVID-19, which was linked to the Yong Thai Hang shop (14) . A total of 11 clusters with 2 or more COVID-19 local cases have been reported thus far. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 6 largest clusters in Singapore.\n\nAlthough large-scale community transmission has not been reported in Singapore, the novel coronavirus can rapidly spread in confined and crowded places, as illustrated by a large cluster of\n\nSingapore, Wizlearn Technologies and the SAFRA Jurong cluster (11, 15) . In China, substantial hospital-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, with a total of 1700 cases involving among healthcare workers (16, 17) . This pattern aligns well with past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (18) , including substantial nosocomial transmission during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore (19) . Thus, the distributions of cluster sizes for SARS and MERS outbreaks are characterized by high heterogeneity (18) . To minimize the risk of hospital-based transmission of .

Also, because multiple unlinked community cases of COVID-19 have been reported (21) , various social distancing measures have been put in place including advising the public against large social gatherings in order to mitigate the risk of community transmission (22, 23) . These social distancing measures reduce the risk of onward transmission not only within Singapore, but also beyond the borders of this highly connected nation (24).\n\nThe reproduction number is a key threshold quantity to assess the transmission potential of an emerging disease such as COVID- 19 (25, 26) . It quantifies the average number of secondary cases generated per case. If the reproduction number is below 1.0, infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease would require continued undetected importations. On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained community transmission (18, 26) . Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, we are monitoring the effective reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Singapore in real-time, and here we report the evolution of Rt by March 5, 2020. Specifically, we assess the effective reproduction number from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the reproduction number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore.\n\nWe obtained the daily series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Singapore as of March 5, 2020.\n\nIndividual-level case details including the dates of symptoms onset, the date of reporting, and whether the case is autochthonous (local transmission) or imported are publicly available from the Ministry of Health, Singapore (27). Clusters consisting of one or more cases according to the infection source were also assembled from case descriptions obtained from field investigations conducted by the Ministry of Health, Singapore (27). Single imported cases are analyzed as clusters of size 1 whereas unlinked cases were excluded from the cluster analysis.\n\n.

A schematic diagram and characteristics of the COVID-19 clusters in Singapore are given in Figure 1 and Table 1 . The geographic location of the six clusters accounting for 58.9 % of the total cases is shown in Figure 2 whereas the corresponding distribution of cluster sizes is shown in Figure 3 . Recently, links between the Wuhan travelers and the two church clusters have been established in Singapore as described below.\n\nThis cluster with 9 cases was the first to be reported in Singapore. It has nine traceable links, including eight Chinese and one Indonesian national associated with the visit of Chinese tourists to the Yong Thai Hang health products store, a shop that primarily serves the Chinese population, on January 23, 2020. Four shop employees and the tour guide were first identified as a cluster on February 4, 2020 (14, 28, 29) . The tour guide subsequently infected her husband, a newborn and the domestic helper (29). No further cases have been added to this cluster as of February 8, 2020.\n\nThis cluster with 3 local cases was the second cluster to receive international attention, as it originated from a business meeting held at the Grand Hayatt hotel attended by Singaporean locals and the Chinese visitors from Hubei (30). Four international cases associated with this cluster had left Singapore before the onset of symptoms. All Singaporean residents associated with this cluster have recovered as of February 19, 2020 (30) . No additional cases have been added to this cluster as of February 8, 2020.\n\nThis cluster with 5 Bangladeshi work pass holders was identified on February 9, 2020. No further cases have been added to this cluster as of February 15, 2020.\n\nThe biggest Singaporean cluster is composed of 31 cases, including two imported cases who are related to each other and 29 local cases. The cluster started during The Life Church and Missions service event in Paya Lebar on January 19, 2020. This event was apparently seeded by two visitors .

The two imported cases are related to each other. No further cases have been added in this cluster as of February 10, 2020.\n\nThe first case of this cluster was identified on February 14, 2020. This cluster is composed of three cases (case 59 infected case 72 who in turn infected case 79). No further cases have been added in this cluster since February 18, 2020.\n\n.

This cluster is composed of 4 cases (case 50 generated three secondary cases). No further cases have been added to this cluster since February 17, 2020.\n\nThe first case of this cluster was identified on February 9, 2020. The two cases in this cluster are related to each other (case 41 infected case 75). No further cases have been added in this cluster since February 16, 2020.\n\nThe first case of this cluster was identified on February 19, 2020. Two cases have been identified in this cluster (case 82 infected case 86). No further cases have been added in this cluster since February 21, 2020.\n\nAs an outbreak progresses in real time, epidemiological curves can be distorted by reporting delays arising from several factors that include: (i) delays in case detection during field investigations, (ii) delays in symptom onset after infection, (iii) delays in seeking medical care, (iv) delays in diagnostics and (v) delays in processing data in surveillance systems (33). However, it is possible to adjust epidemic curves by reporting delays using statistical methods (34). The reporting delay for a case is defined as the time lag in days between the date of onset and date of reporting. Here we adjusted the COVID-19 epidemic curve of local cases by reporting delays using a nonparametric method that employs survival analysis techniques (35-37). The 95% prediction limits are derived according to Lawless et al. (38) . For this analysis, we exclude 6 imported cases and 6 local cases for which dates of symptoms onset are unavailable.\n\nWe assess the effective reproduction number over the course of the outbreak, Rt, which quantifies the temporal variation in the average number of secondary cases generated per case during the course of an outbreak after considering multiple factors including behavior changes, cultural .

Estimates of Rt>1 indicate sustained transmission; whereas, Rt <1 implies that the outbreak is slowing down and the incidence trend is declining. Hence, maintaining Rt <1 is required to bring an outbreak under control. Using the reporting delay adjusted incidence curve, we estimate the most recent estimate of Rt for COVID-19 in Singapore. We first characterize daily incidence of local cases using the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) after adjusting for imported cases. This model characterizes the growth profile via three parameters: the growth rate (r), the scaling of the growth parameter (p) and the final epidemic size (K). The GLM can reproduce a range of early growth dynamics, including constant growth (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0<p<1), and exponential growth (p=1) (40) . The generation interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days based on refs. (41, 42) . We denote the local incidence at calendar time \" by \" , the raw incidence of imported cases at calendar time \" by \" , and the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval by \" . Then, we can estimate the effective reproduction number by employing the renewal equation (43-45)\n\nIn this equation the numerator represents the new cases \" , and the denominator represents the total number of cases that contribute to the new cases \" at time \" . Parameter 0\u2264 \u2264 1 represents the relative contribution of imported cases to the secondary disease transmission. We perform a sensitivity analyses by setting = 0.15 and = 1.0 (46). Next, in order to derive the uncertainty bounds around the curve of (, we estimate ( for 300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure (47) .\n\nIn the branching process analysis, the number of transmissions caused by each new infection is modeled as a negative binomial distribution. This is parameterized by the effective reproduction number, R, and the dispersion parameter, k. The reproduction number provides the average number of secondary cases per index case, and the dispersion parameter varies inversely with the heterogeneity of the infectious disease. This parameterization allows variation in the both the strength and heterogeneity of disease transmission, where a lower dispersion parameter indicates higher transmission heterogeneity.

This permits direct inference of the maximum likelihood estimate and confidence interval for R and k.\n\nThe COVID-19 epidemic curve by the date of reporting and stratified for local and imported incidence case counts is shown in Figure 4 . It is worth noting that the majority of the imported The reporting-delay adjusted epidemic curve of local cases by date of symptoms onset is shown in Figure 5 , and the distribution for reporting delays is displayed in Figure 6 . The gamma distribution provided a reasonable fit to the distribution of overall reporting delays and estimated a mean reporting delay at 7.6 days (95% CI: 6.6, 8.5) ( Figure 6 ). We also found that imported cases tend to have shorter mean reporting delays compared to local cases (mean 3.3 vs. 8.5 days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001), as imported cases tend to be identified more quickly. The distributions of reporting delays for the larger clusters are displayed in Figure 7 .\n\nUsing the delay-adjusted incidence curve of local cases, we estimated the intrinsic growth rate r at .

This indicates that containment efforts are having a significant impact in Singapore. However, some differences in the reproduction numbers reported for the epidemic in China may result from different methods, differences in data sources, and time periods used to estimate the reproduction number. Similarly, a recent study has shown an average reporting delay of 6.1 days in China (60) which agrees with our mean estimate for cases in Singapore (7.6 days). Moreover, the scaling parameter for growth rate (p) indicates a sub-exponential growth pattern in Singapore, reflecting the effective isolation and control strategies in the region. This is consistent with a sub-exponential growth pattern for Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (p~0.67), as estimated by a recent study (61); whereas, an exponential growth pattern was estimated for Hubei (p~1.0) (61).\n\nA previous study on the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea reported substantial potential for superspreading transmission despite a subcritical Rt (62) . The lower estimate of the dispersion parameter in our study also indicate significant transmission heterogeneity in Singapore. Superspreading events of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV associated with nosocomial outbreaks are well documented and driven largely by substantial diagnostic delays (18, 37) . Although the average delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis for COVID-19 patients in Singapore is at 7.6 days and no super-spreading events has been observed yet, the dispersion parameter, k<1, indicates the probability of observing large clusters and the potential for super-spreading (62, 63) . Therefore, public health measures enacted by public health authorities in Singapore that advise the public to avoid mass gatherings and confined places are crucial to prevent disease amplification events.\n\nHowever, the presence of asymptomatic cases in the community represent an ongoing threat (64, 65) although it is not currently known if subclinical cases are less infectious. This highlights the need for rapid testing suspected cases to quickly isolate those that test positive for the novel coronavirus. To achieve this goal, public health authorities in Singapore are reactivating 900 general practitioner clinics (66) . Field investigations have identified cases linked to the \"Grace Assembly of God\" and the \"Life Church and Missions\" in Singapore, a large cluster seeded by the Wuhan visitors. Our overall estimate for R does not differ considerably if these two churches are analyzed as a single large cluster or as two smaller clusters. While new clusters emerge, some . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Moreover, Singapore has also produced secondary chains of disease transmission beyond its borders (24). Although Singapore has been detecting and isolating cases with diligence, our findings underscore the need for continued and sustained containment efforts to prevent largescale community transmission including nosocomial outbreaks. Overall, the current situation in Singapore highlights the need to investigate the unlinked and asymptomatic cases that could be a potential source of secondary cases and amplified transmission in confined settings. Although\n\nSingapore has a world-class health system including a highly efficient contact tracing mechanism in place (24), continued epidemiological investigations and active case finding efforts are needed to control the outbreak.\n\nOur study is not exempt from limitations. First, the outbreak is still ongoing and we continue to monitor the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore. Second, onset dates are missing in twelve cases, which were excluded from our analyses. Third, we cannot rule out that additional cases will be added to existing clusters, which may lead to underestimating the reproduction number based on the cluster size distribution. Finally, the cluster size analysis is modeled under the assumption that there is one primary case (i.e. all cases can be connected eventually to one person), rather than being multiple imported cases. As more data becomes available, more theoretical work could be extended to account for the uncertainty regarding the primary number of cases per cluster and the possibility of ongoing transmission in some clusters.\n\nThis is the first real-time study to estimate the evolving transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore. Our current findings point to temporary sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number lying below the epidemic threshold .
