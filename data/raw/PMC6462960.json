{"title": "Zika Outbreak Emergency Preparedness and Response of Malaysian Private Healthcare Professionals: Are They Ready?", "body": "Epidemics of infectious diseases are a major concern for global health [1] and the recent epidemic of Zika virus Brazilhas gained attention globally [2,3,4,5], due to its complications associated with congenital malformations [6]. The recent outbreaks suggest that Zika virus, one of the arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, is mainly spread all over tropical and sub-tropical counties worldwide [7]. Presently, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine to manage the consequences of Zika virus infection [8].\n\nOrganizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in United States, World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) have come up with numerous initiatives for preparedness and response purposes, and for the prevention and control of the Zika virus epidemics [4,5,9,10,11]. The impact of the Zika outbreak may affect healthcare professionals. Therefore, their preparedness and response measures are of paramount importance to prevent further outbreaks, especially in the tropical regions, where Aedes spp mosquitoes mainly exist. With Zika virus infection manifesting as an evolving pandemic concern, it is crucial to focus on the preparedness and readiness of healthcare professionals in managing a Zika outbreak.\n\nHealthcare professionals, are under an enormous risk of getting exposed to the infections, more than any other individuals, as they are in contact with the infected individuals. Especially, during any outbreak, they may need to work with a healthcare team [12] as their exposure to the Zika virus infection during patient care may put them under the highest risk of contracting the infection. Their awareness and preparedness in managing the risk of the Zika outbreak is very important to prevent further spread of this infectious disease.\n\nThe Asian region is susceptible to epidemic Zika transmission because of various reasons like; widespread distribution of relevant mosquito vectors, the large amount of travel to, and from, Zika-affected areas, local conditions conducive to transmission, and limited health resources [13,14]. Zika virus infections have affected Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia [15], Singapore [16], Vietnam [17], and Thailand [18], and Microcephaly, associated with Zika infection [19], has been also reported in Southeast Asian countries. Previous literature has furthered the knowledge, attitude, practice, and vigilance of healthcare professionals from Malaysia and some Southeast Asian countries [20,21,22,23,24,25]. However preparedness and response studies among healthcare professionals is still lacking in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nMalaysia is located in Southeast Asia, where the Aedes mosquitoes thrive and spread disease like dengue [26]. Suspected Zika cases have been reported in four states (Johor, Penang, Sarawak, and Selangor) in Malaysia and hence it is important to focus on the preparedness of healthcare professionals of Malaysia. With help from WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, Malaysia has developed its own Zika virus infection task forces, emergency operation centres, and regional responses [11], including Zika virus simulation exercises [2,3,4,5]. With the propensity of such activities, healthcare professionals have been provided information on Zika. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess health care professionals\u2019 preparedness and response towards Zika outbreak to understand how Malaysian healthcare professionals are prepared against the infection and how well can they respond in case of an outbreak.\n\nThis study was conducted among private healthcare professionals in Malaysia between June 2017 and December 2017. Among the private Malaysian healthcare professionals, three categories (general practitioners in clinical, community pharmacists, and nurses in clinics) were considered in the study as these are the professionals in the Zika virus front-line. The samples were from four states (Johor, Penang, Sarawak, Selangor) in Malaysia, where the suspected cases of Zika virus infection were reported [27]. In total, 504 private healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) were after the sample size calculated from those four states. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimation of unknown population proportion [28]. Ten percent of the calculated sample size was added to compensate for the non-response rate [29]. Therefore, the minimum sample size required for each category was 78 general practitioners, 172 community pharmacists, and 145 nurses. A convenient sampling method was used to select the sample. Participants who were willing to give their informed consent to participate and those who have been in practice for more than 6 months during the study period were included. Foreign health care professionals, public, healthcare professionals of Malaysia, and those who were unable to communicate were excluded. A total of 445 healthcare professionals (100 general practitioners, 193 community pharmacists, 152 nurses) from four states was approached in this study.\n\nThere is a checklist provided by the CDC and Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) [30,31] to assess how prepared healthcare professionals are for the Zika outbreak. This checklist was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals\u2019 preparedness and perceived response if there was a Zika outbreak. Prior to the study, this questionnaire was piloted on 20 private healthcare professionals from four states (five from each state mentioned above) in Malaysia. No modifications were required following the evaluation. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.78 for preparedness and 0.74 for perceived response. The overall Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.76; indicating that all of the items included make a valid contribution. The questionnaire was a \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 type comprised of 30 questions. The statistical computer package, IBM SPSS, Version 22 was used to perform quantitative analysis on the collected data. In order to perform analysis of data, it was necessary to code the response variables, i.e., yes = 1, no = 0. Data cleaning was carried out throughout the data entry process. The analysis of the data was performed through descriptive statistics, such as frequencies for each of the variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the significant differences of each variable between the groups, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test to determine the differences of each variable within the groups. The threshold for statistical significance was p \u2264 0.05.\n\nThe study was approved by the International Medical University Research and Ethics Joint Committee, project number BP I-01-14 (23)2017. The names and identity card numbers of participants were excluded to ensure anonymity and confidentiality. Before the survey, a study information sheet was shown, and individual verbal or written consent was obtained.\n\nA total of 422 healthcare professionals completed the survey, resulting in a response rate 94.8 percent. More than 50% of the respondents were female. The majority of the respondents were in the age range between 31 and 40 years. In terms of experience, 50.23% of the respondents had at least 10 years during the study period. As a multi-ethnic country, the respondents\u2019 ethnicity was comprised of 33% Malay, 39% Chinese, and 26% Indians. Table 1 shows the statistical summary of the demographic details of the respondents.\n\nThe mean scores presented in Table 2 and Table 3 were obtained by calculating the total response for each item in the questionnaire and the total sample participated in each category. Table 2 presented the health care professionals\u2019 preparedness for a Zika outbreak. The data revealed that most of the respondents were prepared for the Zika outbreak. Yet, there were significant differences between healthcare professionals on some of the items asked in the questionnaire. The nurses found it difficult to access the research literature on Zika virus management, with a low mean score for this statement (0.31 \u00b1 0.34), while general practitioners found it easy to access the literature with the highest mean score among the other groups (0.69 \u00b1 0.31), with the significant value p = 0.03. Community Pharmacists felt that they have not participated in educational activities related to Zika virus preparedness on a consistent basis (continuing professional development, education classes, seminars, or conferences) with a low mean score (0.36 \u00b1 0.31), whereas the general practitioners (0.61 \u00b1 0.35) had the highest mean scores and felt they have participated in such activities on a regular basis p = 0.002. Community Pharmacists considered themselves, not prepared for the management of Zika virus, with a low mean score (0.35 \u00b1 0.27), whereas the general practitioners in this study considered themselves prepared for the management of Zika virus with the highest mean score (0.72 \u00b1 0.27) p = 0.002.\n\nTable 3 presents the health care professionals\u2019 perceived responses to the Zika outbreak. The data revealed that most of the respondents perceived postive responses towards theie preparedness for the Zika outbreak. Yet, there were significant differences found between health care professionals\u2019 perceived response towards Zika outbreak on some of the items asked in the questionnaire. Community pharmacists were not confident in identifying the signs and symptoms of Zika virus (0.46 \u00b1 0.44) and providing patient education on the Zika virus (0.71 \u00b1 0.48), with low mean scores for these statements p = 0.05. However, the general practitioners had highest mean scores for these statements.\n\nSub-group one-way analysis of variance tests (Table 4) did not reveal any significant differences in mean scores for preparedness among the health care professionals regarding age, gender, profession, and ethnicity. However, there was a significant difference in mean scores for preparedness by level of experience among healthcare professionals. Tukey\u2019s post hoc test revealed that among the experience level of >5 to 10 years, the general practitioners mean score 14.52 \u00b1 3.12 was significantly higher than those of the other healthcare professionals; nurses 14.21 \u00b1 3.63 (p = 0.04) and pharmacists 13.87 \u00b1 3.42 (p = 0.03).\n\nSub-group one-way analysis of variance test (Table 5) revealed significant differences in perceived response scores among healthcare professionals by age. Tukey\u2019s post hoc test revealed that, among the age group of 20\u201330 years, the nurses mean score (14.02 \u00b1 4.95) was approximately 25% higher than those of pharmacists (11.22 \u00b1 4.34), which was significant p = 0.018. Tukey\u2019s post hoc test also revealed that there was a significant difference in mean scores of the perceived response by level of experience among the healthcare professionals. The experience level up to 5 years, the nurses mean score (14.53 \u00b1 4.09) was approximately 25% higher than those of pharmacists (12.78 \u00b1 4.71), which was significant p = 0.003. No significant differences in any other demographic factors were observed.\n\nThe total mean scores of healthcare professionals\u2019 preparedness and perceived response to the Zika outbreak is given in Table 6. The overall preparedness for a Zika outbreak, as measured by the total mean score, of general practitioners (13.21 \u00b1 4.14) was approximately 15% higher than those of the other healthcare professionals. One-way ANOVA test revealed significant differences between general practitioners and pharmacists, p = 0.001. The overall perceived response to the Zika outbreak, as measured by the total mean score, of the general practitioners (9.28 \u00b1 2.46) was approximately 25% higher than those of the other healthcare professionals. One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between general practitioners and nurses, p = 0.01.\n\nHealthcare professionals in the public sector were not included in this study as access to public hospitals could was not approved within the stipulated timeframe during the study. Future studies should focus on public healthcare professionals. Convenience sampling may cause selection bias and effects outside the control of the researchers. Therefore, caution should be exercised in generalizing these findings. All data were self-reported, and no cross verification of actual competence of methods and techniques were made.\n\nHealthcare professionals in the Malaysian private sector perceived that they are ready and can respond at any moment in case of Zika outbreak. However, community pharmacists in the private sector are still lacking in their preparedness and perceived that they cannot respond efficiently in case there is a Zika outbreak. As the Ministry of Health, Malaysia, is vigilant and continually conducting preventive measures programs. Participation of community pharmacists may improve their preparedness and response towards any emergency outbreak of Zika virus infection in Malaysia."}
