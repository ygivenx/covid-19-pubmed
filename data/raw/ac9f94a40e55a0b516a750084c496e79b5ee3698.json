{"title": "Design, synthesis, antiviral and cytostatic evaluation of novel isoxazolidine nucleotide analogues with a carbamoyl linker", "body": "Nucleoside analogues are of great interest in medicinal chemistry due to their broad spectrum of biological activities. Extensive search for modified nucleosides has led to the discovery of many potent drugs for treatment of various viral infections 1 and diverse types of neoplasms ( Fig. 1 ). 2 The adverse effects of the available therapies, low selectivity and the observed drug resistance have become a driving force in a search for new analogues with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Numerous modifications of naturally occurring nucleosides have provided analogues with altered sugar and/or nucleobase subunits. Heterocycles containing one or more heteroatoms and carbocycles of various sizes as well as straight or branched chains also with heteroatoms have been applied as an alternative to the furanose ring. 3, 4 So far less attention has been paid to the synthesis of analogues having modified nucleobase residues in comparison to sugar-modified analogues due to ensuring base pairing, but recently it has been proven that other aromatic rings are able to base-pair as well. 5 A long list of nucleoside analogues continues to expand by incorporation of several linkers such as a 1,2,3-triazole group, 6-9 a carbamoyl [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] or an ureidyl function 18 among others.\n\nThe isoxazolidine framework has successfully been applied as a surrogate for a furanose ring in the synthesis of nucleoside ana-logues with anticancer or antiviral activity (Fig. 2) . Nucleoside analogue 1 [(\u00c0)-AdFU] having a fluorouracil residue attached to the isoxazolidine ring induces apoptosis on lymphoid and monocytoid cells and exhibits low level of cytotoxicity. 19 Phosphonylated isoxazolidines 2 inhibit reverse transcriptase of HTLV-1 with activity comparable to that of AZT and protect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells against HTLV-1 transmission. 20 Furthermore, compounds of general formula 3 show high cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines comparable to the known anticancer drugs, namely, Mitomycin C, Paclitaxel and 5-Fluorouracil, used as positive controls. 21 Synthesis and promising antiproliferative properties of isoxazolidines 4 have been reported by Bortolini et al. 22 Recently, a series of 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidine nucleosides 5 23,24 as well as their further modifications 6 with an 1,2,3-triazole spacer 25 have been obtained and their antiviral and cytotoxic properties were evaluated. Isoxazolidines 5 substituted with 1-and 2naphthyl at C5 were found cytotoxic against HeLa and K562 cell lines (R = 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl; IC 50 0.05 and 0.09 mM, respectively), 23 while cis-configured 5-fluorouracil and 5-thymine derivatives 5 completely inhibited the reverse transcriptase activity of Avian Moloney Virus (AMV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 24 Although (1,2,3-triazolyl)isoxazolidinephosponates 6 did not show antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations, derivatives of 6 having the unsubstituted and fluorosubstituted phenyl at C4 in the 1,2,3-triazole ring proved slightly cytostatic. 25 Encouraged by these results a new series of 5-substituted (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines 7 was designed (Scheme 1).\n\nCompounds 7 could be regarded as nucleotide prodrugs due to incorporation of a bioisosteric diethoxyphosphoryl function at C3 of the isoxazolidine ring which mimics nucleoside monophosphate. 26 Moreover, it was anticipated that insertion of a carbamoyl linker between the isoxazolidine moiety and careful selection of mono-, di-or trisubstituted phenyl groups as nucleobase replacer would improve their interaction within DNA/RNA strands by forming stronger hydrogen bonds.\n\nTo synthesise the desired isoxazolidines 10 and 11 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of N-methyl C-phosphorylnitrone 8 27,28 with a series of acrylamides 9 was employed (Scheme 2). Most of substituted acrylamides 9 used in this paper have already been described in the literature. However, compounds 9ab, 9ad, 9an, 9az and 9ba were prepared according to the standard procedure from commercially available substituted anilines and acryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine. 29 Cycloadditions of nitrone 8 with acrylamides 9aa-9ba were carried out in toluene at 70\u00b0C and afforded mixtures of diastereoisomeric (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines trans-10aa-10ba and cis-11aa-11ba (Scheme 2, Table 1 ). In all cases moderate to good trans/cis diastereoselectivities (de 50-80%) were observed. The crude mixtures of the respective cycloadducts were subjected to column chromatography and in almost all cases (except for 10ae, 10ah and 10aq) pure major trans-isomers 10 were separated in moderate to good yields (Table 1). Isolation of pure minor cis-isomers 11, which are very cru- cial for biological evaluation, was not a trivial task. However, several purifications of the enriched diastereoisomeric mixtures of the respective isoxazolidines 10/11 on silica gel columns proved fruitful for isoxazolidines 11aa, 11ab, 11ac, 11ai, 11aj, 11al, 11am, 11an, 11ap, 11aq, 11ar, 11as, 11at, 11av, 11aw and 11ba (Table 1) making minute quantities of cis-11 available. Stereochemistry of the cycloaddition of N-substituted C-phosphorylated nitrones to various alkenes has already been described and the relative configurations of trans-and cis-isoxazolidine cycloadducts were established based on detailed conformational analyses. [23] [24] [25] 27, 28 Indeed, the assignment of relative configurations in isoxazolidines has often been difficult due to conformational flexibility of substituted five-membered ring, but in the case of isoxazolidines containing the diethoxyphosphoryl group at C3 stereochemically valuable data are extended over PCCH 30, 31 and PCCC 31-34 vicinal couplings, which appeared to be extremely useful in establishing the stereochemistries of phosphorus-labelled heterocycles. 35, 36 For the major isomers of all obtained isoxazolidines 10aa-10ba trans-configuration was assigned taking advantage of our previous observations regarding stereochemistry of cycloaddition of N-methyl-C-phosphorylated nitrone 8 with terminal alkenes. 27, 28 In this series a similar approach to configurational assignment was applied. Thus, based on the values of vicinal coupling constants [J CCCP = 8.6-9.5 Hz, J H3-H4a = 7.7-8. 3 Hz, J H3-H4b = 8.5-9.2 Hz, J H4a-P = 8.0-9. 8 Hz, J H4b-P = 15.4-16.1 Hz, J H4a-H5 = 5.0-5.7 Hz and J H4b-H5 = 8.5-9.2 Hz] extracted from the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 10al-10ao, 10aq, 10at and 10aw-10ba preferred 3 E conformation of the isoxazolidine ring ( Fig. 3 ) was established. In this conformation the diethoxyphosphoryl group resides in the equatorial position of the isoxazolidine ring while carbamoyl substituents are located pseudoequatorially. Furthermore, a similar spectral pattern was previously observed for structurally related methyl trans-3-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-2methylisoxazolidin-5-yl-5-carboxylate. 27, 28 To provide an additional piece of evidence for the already established relative configuration at C3 and C5 in isoxazolidines trans-10 and cis-11 2D NOE experiments were performed for trans-10ay and cis-11ay (Fig. 4) . The occurrence of NOE signal between HC5 and HC3 was noticed for cis-11ay, while the spectrum of trans-10ay lacks such correlation. Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaque formation (VZV) by 50% or to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (other viruses). Unfortunately, no inhibitory activity against any virus was detected for the evaluated compounds at 250 lM.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the tested compounds toward the uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum compound concentration (MCC) that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation was determined against murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. None of the tested compounds affected cell morphology of HEL, HeLa, Vero, MDCK and CrFK cells at concentrations up to 100 lM. However, several compounds, having phenyl residue substituted with F, Br, Cl, NO 2 and CH 3 C(O) groups, were able to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% (CC 50 ) at concentrations ranging from 116 to 228 lM for L1210 cells, and from 102 to 227 lM for CEM and HeLa cells ( Table 2) .\n\nStructure-activity relationship studies for a series of 5-arylcarbamoyl-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates trans-10 and cis-11 described in this paper revealed that, in general, cis-isomers 11 are more cytostatic toward tested tumour cell lines than the respective trans-10 (11aa vs 10aa, 11ab vs 10ab, 11af vs 10af, 11ag vs 10ag, 11aj vs 10aj and 11ar vs 10ar). is the most cytostatic. According to Kool, a 2,4-fluorophenyl group could be regarded as an uracil non-polar isoster due to the steric and electrostatic similarities. [37] [38] [39] [40] To our surprise introduction of additional fluorine atoms into the aromatic ring resulted in loss of cytostatic activity (10ad/11ad; Ar = 2,4-diF-C 6 H 3 ).\n\nA new series of 5-arylcarbamoyl-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3phosphonates have been efficiently obtained from N-methyl-C-diethoxyphoshporylnitrone and the respective N-arylacrylamides via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. All synthesised isoxazolidineposphonates trans-10 and cis-11 were evaluated against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses but were not active at 250 lM.\n\nCytostatic activity of trans-10 and cis-11 compounds were performed on three tumor cell lines (L1210, CEM and HeLa) and showed that cis-configurated isoxazolidines containing phenyl substituted with halogen [cis-11aa (Ar = 2-F-C 6 H 4 ), cis-11af (Ar = 3-Br-C 6 H 4 ), and cis-11ag (Ar = 4-Br-C 6 H 4 )] are the most active toward all tested cancerous cell lines (IC 50 100-180 lM).\n\nFurther studies on isoxazolidinephosphonates of general formula 7 containing natural or modified nucleobases instead of aryl groups are in progress and will be published in due course.\n\n1 H NMR spectra were taken in CDCl 3 or CD 3 OD on the following spectrometers: Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III Table 2 Inhibitory effect of several 5-arylcarbamoyl-2-methylisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates against the proliferation of murine leukemia (L1210), human T-lymphocyte (CEM) and human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa)\n\nAr (600 MHz) with TMS as internal standard. 13 Starting materials: All solvents were dried according to the literature methods. Nitrone 8 was previously reported. 27 4.1. General procedure for the preparation of acrylamides 9\n\nTo a solution of substituted aniline (1.00 mmol) in dichloromethane (2 mL) triethylamine (1.10 mmol) was added. The mixture was cooled in an ice bath and acryloyl chloride (1.05 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature and extracted with water (3 \u00c2 3 mL). Subsequently, the inorganic layer was extracted with ethyl ether (3 \u00c2 5 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 and filtered. After evaporation of solvents the residue was purified on a silica column with chloroform:methanol mixtures (100:1, 50:1 v/v) as eluents to afford the respective acrylamides 9. \n\nA mixture of nitrone 8 (1.00 mmol), acrylamide 9 (1.00 mmol) and toluene (2 mL) was stirred at 70\u00b0C for 24 h or until disappearance of the starting nitrone. After evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure the crude products were purified by silica gel chromatography with chloroform/methanol mixtures as eluents. C NMR signals of cis-11ac were extracted from the spectrum of a 48:52 mixture of trans-10ac and cis-11ac, 13 \n\nInhibition of HIV-1(III B )-and HIV-2(ROD)-induced cytopathicity in CEM cell cultures was measured in microtiter 96-well plates containing 3 \u00c2 10 5 CEM cells/mL infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV per milliliter and containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4\u00c05 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 -controlled humidified atmosphere, CEM giant (syncytium) cell formation was examined microscopically. The EC 50 (50% effective concentration) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit HIV-induced giant cell formation by 50%.\n\nAll assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. To each well were added (5\u00c07.5) \u00c2 10 4 tumor cells and a given amount of the test compound. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h (murine leukemia L1210 cells) or 72 h (human lymphocytic CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO 2 -controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter. The IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of the compound that inhibited cell proliferation by 50%."}
