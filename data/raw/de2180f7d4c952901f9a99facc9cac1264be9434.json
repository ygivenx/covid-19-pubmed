{"title": "", "body": "\u2022 The most common causes of a cloudy eye are diseases that cause edema or scarring of the cornea, and uveitis, which causes cloudiness in the aqueous humor and/or vitreous as a result of protein and cells leaking through inflamed uveal blood vessels. Hereditary cataract (opacity of the lens) is rare in cats, but cataracts may develop secondary to uveitis. Nuclear sclerosis is a common cause of lens cloudiness in old cats.\n\nDiseases causing a cloudy eye WHERE?\n\n\u2022 Corneal sequestrum (feline keratitis nigrum)** (p 1260)\n\nPresents with an axial (central) area of staining (light brown to black) in the cornea, and is usually unilateral. Most common in brachycephalic breeds such as Persians and Himalayans. Approximately 80% are associated with herpetic keratitis. In the early stages there is no ulceration, but chronic lesions may have ulcerated borders surrounded by an inflammatory zone with intense vascularization.\n\nA rare condition in young Manx cats that starts with axial stromal edema and progresses to a diffuse corneal edema with a thickened stroma full of bullae (fluid-filled vesicles). It is a blinding corneal disease with no treatment possible.\n\n\u2022 Feline herpesvirus-1 keratitis*** (p 1259)\n\nCats may have a history of FHV-1 infection as kittens. Often appears as a unilateral disease in older cats. The epithelium may show dendritic lesions (finger-like projections of thickened epithelium that stain with rose bengal stain) in early cases. Chronic cases show irregular (geographic) ulceration to the level of the superficial stroma. Scarring and vascularization of the cornea follows after repeated inflammatory episodes.\n\n\u2022 Mycobacterial keratitis (\"Florida spots\") (p 1264)\n\nFocal grayish opacities seen in the stroma caused by a mycobacterium. Only seen in the southeast USA.\n\nA very painful, cloudy eye with serous discharge, blepharospasm and photophobia. Usually occurs secondary to corneal trauma. Superficial ulcers have loss of epithelium, which is seen as an erosion of the surface, and stains green with fluorescein dye. Deeper ulcers have a hollow caused by loss of stroma.\n\n\u2022 Eosinophilic keratitis* (p 1261)\n\nSeen as a cloudy, red cornea, sometimes with a muco-purulent discharge. A proliferative white to pinkish plaque develops on the cornea, with superficial and in chronic cases, deep vascularization. Usually a history of poor response to antibiotic therapy. Eosinophils demonstrated on cytology from corneal scrapings are diagnostic.\n\n\u2022 Cornea scarring from injury* (p 1263)\n\nOpaque areas on cornea, which vary in size and intensity. There is no pain or discharge associated with these opacities, and usually there is a history of previous severe ocular inflammation or trauma.\n\nANTERIOR CHAMBER\n\n\u2022 Lipemic aqueous (p 1270)\n\nThe anterior chamber looks milky, but intra-ocular architecture can be visualized. Signs may be unilateral or bilateral, and may have a sudden onset. Occurs secondary to anterior uveitis in cats on a high-fat diet, or is associated with hyperlipidemia. Idiopathic in Burmese cats.\n\nMost cases present as anterior uveitis with corneal edema and a cloudy aqueous, and have some form of swelling seen in the iris, which may cause distortion of the pupil (dyscoria). The retina may be distorted and have a color change. Lymphosarcoma is the most common tumor and often presents as bilateral iris swelling with a \"creamy\" color change, and anterior chamber hypopyon and/or hemorrhage in a young cat, with or without other signs suggesting multicentric neoplasia. The pupil may be distorted (dyscoria).\n\nFeLV may present as a cloudy aqueous associated with white cells and fibrin in the eye caused by a uveitis. Changes to iris appearance and abnormal pupil size and shape occur. It may or may not be associated with lymphosarcoma.\n\n\u2022 Feline infectious peritonitis (p 1266)\n\nOcular form usually occurs in cats 6-12 months old. Ocular signs may be unilateral or bilateral. Typically there is fibrinous anterior uveitis and hypopyon, and initially no systemic signs. Advanced cases show serous retinal detachment and may have neurological signs.\n\n\u2022 Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis)** (p 1265) Most common sign is a cloudy anterior chamber from anterior uveitis and hypopyon. Older cats may develop small translucent nodules in the iris from lymphocytic-plasmocytic uveitis. Advanced cases may develop serous retinal detachment. Occasionally systemic signs are present including fever, weight loss, and respiratory, neurological and hepatic signs.\n\n\u2022 Cryptococcus neoformans (cryptococcosis) (p 1268)\n\nUsually presents as anterior uveitis with a cloudy aqueous secondary to leakage of white cells and protein. Examination of the retina shows focal granulomas with a cloudy vitreous. Blindness occurs in advanced cases.\n\nTypically there is a cloudy aqueous secondary to white cells and protein leaking into eye from anterior uveitis. Pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes are seen in chronic cases. Hemorrhage is associated with the PFIMs. Retinal hemorrhage is seen occasionally in areas of granuloma formation and appears as focal cloudy swelling in the retina.\n\n\u2022 Nuclear sclerosis and senile cataract** (p 1271)\n\nIn nuclear sclerosis, the central part of the lens (nucleus) becomes slightly cloudy but the cat is still visual. Sclerosis is a normal aging process that starts from 8 years and becomes progressively cloudier with age. Senile cataract is seen in much older cats from 12-20 years of age. Nuclear continued cells finally break down so the nucleus becomes very cloudy and vision deteriorates. The lens cortex may also start to degenerate resulting in cortical changes in addition to nuclear changes.\n\n\u2022 Diabetic cataract (p 1273)\n\nRare finding in aged diabetic cats. Lens is cloudy with an immature to mature cataract and impaired vision.\n\n\u2022 Cataract secondary to infectious uveitis** (p 1271)\n\nThe lens becomes very cloudy because of a cortical cataract developing from poor nutrition and toxic states within the eye. Signs of uveitis are present such as a cloudy eye due to aqueous flare and fibrovascular membranes on the iris (PFIMs).\n\n\u2022 Cataract secondary to non-infectious uveitis (p 1273)\n\nNuclear cataract in a young healthy cat with no evidence of ocular inflammation. Rare.\n\n\u2022 Cataract secondary to lens trauma* (p 1272)\n\nPenetrating injuries that rupture the lens capsule will disrupt normal lens physiology and cause cataract development. This causes an acute uveitis from the released lens proteins within the eye (lens-induced uveitis). Blunt trauma to the eye may also rupture the lens. A tentative diagnosis is based on a history or signs of eye trauma and the presence of a mature or immature cataract. \n\n\u2022 Feline immune deficiency virus* (p 1275)\n\nFIV infection causes pars planitis which is a \"Snowbank\" inflammation of the pars plana and thought to be almost pathognomonic for FIV infection. It results in a cloudy vitreous.\n\nThe eye is an organ with various media that normally maintain clarity for transmission of light by very specialized means.\n\n\u2022 The corneal stoma maintains optical clarity by the highly organized structure of the collagen fibrils, lack of blood vessels and lack of pigment. \u2022 The lens fibers (cells) are also laid down in a very orderly fashion and contain soluble lens proteins known as crystallins. \u2022 The aqueous humor is a clear fluid secreted by the ciliary body to maintain the anterior chamber. \u2022 The vitreous is a complex, transparent living tissue made mainly from complex carbohydrates.\n\nCloudiness of the eye results from changes in structure and composition of the cornea, aqueous (anterior chamber), lens or vitreous (posterior chamber).\n\nFor details on the structure and function of the cornea see \"The Cat With Abnormalities Confined to the Cornea\" (page 1236).\n\nThe cornea becomes cloudy from edema when the surface develops an ulcer (ulcerative keratitis). Loss of epithelial cells allows the stroma to absorb fluid. This causes the intercellular matrix to swell, which in turn, disrupts the normal pattern of the keratocytes and the cornea becomes cloudy.\n\nCorneal edema is also seen in cases of glaucoma and uveitis where the endothelial pump mechanism is disturbed, so that aqueous enters the stroma from the anterior chamber.\n\nInflammatory conditions in the cornea cause cloudiness by disrupting the normal cellular matrix, either with cellular infiltrates or by changing the normal cellular structure, such as scar tissue formation.\n\nThe anterior chamber is a fluid-filled compartment bounded by the cornea anteriorly and the lens and ciliary body posteriorly.\n\nThe fluid is called aqueous humor and is produced by a process of ultrafiltration and active secretion in the ciliary body. Aqueous exits the anterior chamber through the trabecular meshwork in the iridocorneal angle to reach the vascular system via the scleral vessels. The dynamics of aqueous humor production and drainage is very complex, but simply, it keeps the eye inflated at a predetermined pressure known as the intra-ocular pressure (IOP). Interference of aqueous drainage causes glaucoma. The increased intraocular pressure disturbs the corneal physiology resulting in corneal edema and a cloudy eye. See \"The Cat with Abnormal Globe Position or Size\" (page 1312).\n\nAqueous is a clear fluid that also supplies nutrients to the inner structures of the eye. When the anterior uveal tract (ciliary body and iris) becomes inflamed this is called anterior uveitis. Inflammation of the vascularrich uveal tract causes the blood vessels to leak protein and white blood cells into the aqueous causing \"aqueous flare\". Accumulations of protein and white blood cells may form opaque clots known as \"hypopyon\". This causes a cloudy anterior chamber. See \"The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance\" (page 1294).\n\nAt the same time, anterior uveitis disturbs the endothelial pump mechanism, allowing aqueous to enter the stroma. This causes edema of the cornea seen as a cloudy eye.\n\nA cloudy lens is seen when the lens develops a cataract.\n\nA cataract is defined as an opacity of the lens. Lens fibers become opaque when they are no longer viable. A cataract is classified according to the position in the lens, and according to whether it is immature or mature.\n\nThe lens consists of an anterior and posterior capsule on the outer surface of the cortex. The central part of the lens is known as the nucleus. The lens is suspended by fibers known as zonules, which extend from the equator (outer circumference) of the lens to the ciliary processes. Lens cells are known as lens fibers and are continually produced from the lens epithelium, which is most active at the equator.\n\nThe lens has no blood supply, and therefore relies on the nutrients in the aqueous humor and the vitreous for its nutritional requirements. Disturbance to the nutrition of the lens will result in death of lens fibers and development of a cataract.\n\nGenetic cataract is rare in the cat.\n\nMost cataracts in cats are secondary to disease processes within the eye such as uveitis or neoplasia.\n\nLens fibers in the nucleus become slightly opaque with age. This is known as nuclear sclerosis and may be seen from about 8 years of age. This is not a true cataract as the fibers are viable and the eye is usually visual. With age, the nuclear fibers may die, so nuclear sclerosis may develop into a nuclear cataract.\n\nThe vitreous is a living tissue (mainly mucopolysaccharide; also called glycosaminoglycans) that fills the space between the retina, ciliary body and lens.\n\nInflammation or hypertension of the inner retinal blood vessels will allow protein and white/red blood cells to leak into the vitreous causing \"vitreous flare\". This may present as a cloudy eye behind the pupil.\n\nInflammation of the choroid (posterior uvea) leads to leakage of protein and blood cells into the outer retinal space leading to a serous retinal detachment. Retinal detachment can present as a cloudy eye behind the pupil.\n\nVitreous degeneration is rare in the cat.\n\nDisease affecting the cornea, anterior chamber, lens or vitreous may result in a cloudy eye.\n\nDecide which of the media have become cloudy and go to that part of the text for greater detail.\n\nCloudiness of cornea, anterior chamber, lens or vitreous may be caused by:\n\n\u2022 Infiltrates of inflammatory cells or infusion of tissue fluid (edema), which produces swelling of the corneal stroma, will result in a cloudy cornea. \u2022 Alteration of the cellular matrix in the cornea and lens causes a change in the refractive index, because of changed chemical properties of these structures. For example, the change in the structure of the crystallins in the lens results in cataract formation. \u2022 Accumulation of protein and cells in the aqueous humor causes a cloudy aqueous called hypopyon. \u2022 On rare occasions lipid may be seen in the aqueous (aqueous lipid) forming a very cloudy eye. \u2022 Leakage of cells and protein into the vitreous from inflammation of the ciliary body and/or choroid causes a cloudy vitreous.\n\nThe most common causes of corneal cloudiness are from inflammation associated with herpesvirus keratitis or eosinophilic keratitis, or from trauma resulting in edema, cellular infiltrates, ulcerative keratitis, and/or scarring or corneal sequestrum.\n\nThe most common causes of anterior chamber cloudiness are inflammation from infectious agents such as Toxoplamsa gondii, Cryptococcus, other systemic fungi, feline infectious peritonitis virus, feline leukemia virus or from neoplasia.\n\nThe most common causes of lens cloudiness are from nuclear sclerosis or cataract secondary to infectious uveitis or trauma.\n\nThe most common cause of posterior chamber cloudiness is from systemic hypertension. \n\nHerpesvirus is one of the most common causes of acute and chronic corneal disease in older cats.\n\nAcute primary infection with herpesvirus may result in the following signs:\n\n\u2022 Conjunctival hyperemia and serous ocular discharge that becomes purulent by days 5-7 of infection. \u2022 Mild to moderate chemosis and blepharospasm. \u2022 Non-specific upper respiratory signs such as sneezing and serous nasal discharge. \u2022 Fine-branching (microdendritic) corneal lesions may be seen, especially if the cornea is stained with rose bengal. They result from the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, and are finger-like projections of epithelium.\n\nSymblepharon formation with adhesion of conjunctiva to conjunctiva and conjunctiva to cornea may follow severe inflammation especially in young kittens.\n\n\u2022 Dendritic ulcers.\n\n\u2022 Corneal sequestrum.\n\n\u2022 Superficial indolent epithelial ulcers.\n\n\u2022 Serous ocular discharge.\n\n\u2022 Stromal edema and scarring.\n\nFrequently unilateral but may be bilateral.\n\nA large shallow ulcer with an irregular shape that appears to look like a continent or land mass (geographic ulcer) may be evident, and is often associated with superficial vascularization. It is the result of an immune response to viral antigen. There may be edema and in chronic cases scarring with calcific degeneration (calcium deposition in the anterior stroma).\n\nTypically there is a history of acute episodes followed by quiescent periods, but close examination will reveal a slightly cloudy, scarred cornea.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is usually based on the clinical signs.\n\nA definitive diagnosis requires specific techniques, which are available from some la oratories. These are used infrequently and vary in their sensitivity. PCR is the most useful of these.\n\n\u2022 Cytological examination of corneal/conjunctival smears stained with immunoperoxidase may demonstrate intranuclear inclusions in epithelial cells in some acute primary infections, but is not very reliable. \u2022 Immunofluorescence using direct or indirect fluorescent antibody techniques on corneal/conjunctival smears or tissue sections may demonstrate the virus, but has poor sensitivity. \u2022 Virus isolation is the gold standard for detection, but is not often used because of logistical difficulties in getting rapid results. It depends on demonstration of cytopathic effects of the virus in cell culture. \u2022 Serological techniques are not very useful because antibody titers tend to be of low magnitude after primary infection sometimes reaching only 1:64 at 60 days after infection. High titers are rarely seen after recrudescent infection. \u2022 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing depends on DNA amplification of an amino acid sequence of the thymidine kinase gene, and is perhaps the most sensitive test available. Theoretically the test could pick up one strand of viral DNA. High sensitivity in nested PCR tests may reduce specificity by the detection of non-viral DNA contaminants.\n\n\u2022 Area of pigmented cornea varying from a very light coffee-colored stain to an intense thick black plaque. \u2022 +/-Blepharospasm and photophobia. \n\nThe classic presentation is an area of pigmented cornea. The degree of pigmentation varies from a very light coffee-colored stain to an intense thick black plaque.\n\nApproximately 80% are associated with herpetic keratitis. There may be a history of previous infection with FHV-1 as a kitten, or later in life, with herpetic keratitis. However, cases may develop after corneal ulceration or from medial entropion.\n\nThe disease is initially seen unilaterally, but eventually both eyes may become involved.\n\nInitially the cat may not show any signs of discomfort, but as the lesion progresses blepharospasm and photophobia develop.\n\nEarly, light-staining lesions have an intact epithelium and do not stain with fluorescein. Lesions that have developed a dense plaque may have a fine ring of ulceration surrounding the lesion, which may stain positive with fluorescein.\n\nIn mild cases, the surrounding cornea will not show signs of edema or vascularization, but as the degree of degeneration progresses, corneal edema with marked deep stromal vascularization may be prominent.\n\nEyes that have a faint stain usually do not have any ocular discharge. Eyes that have a dark plaque with surrounding ulceration and intense corneal vascularization often have a mucopurulent ocular discharge.\n\nThe condition is seen in any breed of cat, but it occurs predominantly in brachycephalic breeds such as Persians and Himalayans. There is no sex or age predilection.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the signalment and clinical signs. Typically there is a mild brown-staining cornea to a dense black plaque with keratitis.\n\nA definitive diagnosis is based on histopathological examination of resected cornea. There is a typical pattern of degenerated stroma surrounded by a ring of inflammatory cells.\n\nPCR tests on resected cornea may confirm the presence of FHV-1 infection.\n\n\u2022 Irregular white to pinkish plaque on the cornea. \u2022 Corneal edema and vascularization. \u2022 +/-Similar conjunctival lesion. \u2022 Unilateral or bilateral.\n\n\u2022 Poor response to a variety of antibacterial agents.\n\nSee the main reference on page 1245 (The Cat With Abnormalities Confined to the Cornea).\n\nSigns begin unilaterally, but may become bilateral.\n\nSeen as a cloudy, red cornea. This is a proliferative lesion producing whitish to pink, plaque-like tissue that may be covered by a thick white discharge.\n\nThe corneal epithelium is usually intact, but may show patchy staining with fluorescein. There is usually an intense neovascularization (superficial and deep) in chronic cases. There are varying degrees of edema, usually involving the entire cornea.\n\nThe conjunctiva is usually involved secondary to the cornea, and may present with a similar white, proliferative plaque and mucopurulent ocular discharge.\n\nThe third eyelid may also show proliferative lesions.\n\nThere is often a history of a poor response to a variety of antibacterial agents.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the history of an edematous, vascularized cornea that will not respond to antibiotic therapy.\n\nClean the eye with saline or eye wash and take a scraping of the lesion using a scalpel blade, spatula or cytology brush. Gently spread the tissue onto a glass microscope slide and stain with a Wright or Romanofski stain. The presence of eosinophils is diagnostic. If conjunctival lesions are present, preferably take a sample from the conjunctiva.\n\nSmall conjunctival biopsies can be submitted in formalin for histopatholgy. The presence of eosinophils is diagnostic.\n\nHematology may reveal a peripheral eosinophilia.\n\nThe condition will rapidly respond to systemic corticosteroids dosed at 1 mg/kg daily.\n\nIf the tips of the ears show alopecia, pruritis and crusting, the condition may be caused by biting insects. Such cases have been documented in Queensland, Australia. In such cases the cats must be housed in conditions that are insect free. \n\nThere may be evidence of the underlying cause. Most ulcers that are not associated with a specific corneal disease are caused by corneal trauma. Foreign bodies such as grass seeds and thorns, or blunt trauma from motor vehicle accidents are the most common causes of corneal trauma. Trauma may cause a superficial ulcer, a deep ulcer or penetrating wound.\n\nEyes with ulceration are invariably very painful. Cats show serous ocular discharge, blepharospasm, photophobia and ocular guarding in severe injuries.\n\nUlcers stain positive with fluorescein dye. A very deep ulcer that has formed a Descemetocele may not show any staining because Descemet's membrane will not stain with fluorescein.\n\nExamination of the cornea with magnification will show a deficit in the corneal surface because of loss of epithelium and stroma.\n\nCorneal edema will be present in cases that have loss of epithelium, because fluid will be absorbed by the stromal matrix. This will show as a cloudy cornea. Edema may be focal around the ulcer, or diffuse when large ulcers are present.\n\nPenetrating injuries are common after cat fights. They present with a perforation of the cornea surrounded by a dense area of edema and swelling. A fibrin plug may be present in the corneal wound. If the iris has prolapsed into the wound, the center of the perforation will be dark brown or black in color. The anterior chamber may be collapsed and contain blood (hyphema) and fibrin.\n\nPerforating injuries that are not sealed by fibrin and/or iris, will leak aqueous so the cat will have a very wet eye and face.\n\nThere may be a history of trauma or a cat fight. The diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is based on clinical signs of a painful eye showing a stromal deficit.\n\nThe ulcer will stain with fluorescein except in the case of a Descemetocele. If the center of the ulcer is dark, and the area bulges, there may be a Descemetocele. Descemet's membrane is very elastic in cats and can bulge forward quite noticeably.\n\nPerforating injuries are very painful and show changes in the anterior chamber such as hyphema and protein leakage with fibrin.\n\nAs a general rule, eliminate the cause of the ulcer and provide protection for the cornea using lubrication, appropriate antibiotics where necessary and surgical techniques to close and protect the eye.\n\nSuperficial epithelial erosions heal rapidly with minimal treatment. The use of antibiotics is not encouraged as they are rarely infected. Support with artificial tear solutions will make the eye more comfortable.\n\nCorneas with deep ulcers that have stromal loss need to be protected with surgical techniques such as third eyelid flaps or temporary tarsorrhaphies (see references for texts that show details of these surgical techniques).\n\n\u2022 Antibiotics are often used topically to prevent secondary infection. If the ulcer is infected, then appropriate antibiotics should be used after culture of a swab taken from the edge of the ulcer. \u2022 Artificial tear solutions will lubricate the eye and make the cat feel more comfortable. \u2022 Atropine ophthalmic drops (most commonly 1%) are used to dilate the pupil and to prevent ciliary muscle spasm. They should be used two to three times daily until the pupil is dilated, and daily thereafter (NOTE: atropine drops are very bitter and often make cats salivate profusely). For this reason 1% atropine ointment is often used, as the drug does not run down the tear duct as fast.\n\nWhere a Pseudomonas infection is suspected or confirmed by laboratory analysis, the cat must be treated vigorously with aminoglycoside (commonly gentomycin or tobramycin in gentomycin-resistant cases) or fluoroquinalone (some generations such as flucloxacillin are effective) antibiotics topically every 15 minutes to 1 hour until the infection is controlled. They may also be used systemically but particular care should be used with aminoglycosides in cats as they are ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Toxicity may occur from frequent topical use, so monitor cases carefully.\n\nNEVER use topical corticosteroids when a corneal ulcer is present, as this will predispose to keratomalacia (melting ulcer).\n\nIf there is a penetrating corneal lesion, examine the eye carefully for signs of iris prolapse and lens rupture. These cases need to be referred to a veterinary ophthalmologist whenever possible.\n\n\u2022 If there is a corneal tear that is well sealed with a fibrin plug, protect the cornea with a third eyelid flap or temporary tarsorrhaphy. Dilate the pupil with atropine and use a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic drop. NEVER use an ointment when there has been a penetrating corneal injury, because ointment bases that enter the anterior chamber will cause an intense and chronic foreign body uveitis.\n\nAnimals with acute eye injuries should be given systemic NSAIDs to minimize the effects of an intra-ocular prostaglandin reaction. The eye should also be protected from infection with systemic broadspectrum antibiotics.\n\nWhen there is an iris prolapse, microsurgery is required to suture the cornea. The iris needs to be gently teased back into the anterior chamber, and the chamber flushed to remove blood and fibrin. Viscoelastic solutions are then used to space the anterior chamber, and the corneal deficit is sutured with interrupted 8/0 to 10/0 nylon or absorbable suture material. This is very specialized surgery that requires specialist training, magnification and specialized instrumentation. The pupil is then dilated with atropine, infection prevented with broad-spectrum topical and systemic antibiotics and NSAIDs given to minimize inflammation.\n\n\u2022 Range from faint cloudiness of the superficial stroma to dense opacity. \u2022 Variable position, size, shape and density of scar. \u2022 History of previous severe inflammation or trauma.\n\nScarring may be secondary to disease processes or trauma.\n\nScars form secondary to stromal damage. When stroma is infected or lost from ulceration, keratocytes metaplase into fibrocytes. \n\nScars present as cloudy areas on the cornea. Superficial scarring of the cornea is seen as a faint cloudiness of the superficial stroma. Dense opacity is seen with deep scars that involve the deep layers of the cornea.\n\nScars vary considerably in position, size, shape and density depending on the depth and area of corneal stroma that has been damaged.\n\nUsually there is no inflammation in the affected eye.\n\nVision is always affected by corneal scarring.\n\nA diagnosis is based on clinical findings and history.\n\nTypically the cornea has cloudy areas of varying density, there is no positive staining with fluorescein, and the eye has no sign of inflammation, pain or discharge.\n\nUsually, there is a history of previous severe inflammation or trauma, with healing of the cornea.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 An asymptomatic keratitis recognized in the southeastern USA. \u2022 The cornea has focal gray-white opacities in the anterior stroma, varying in diameter from 1-8 mm in size. \u2022 The lesions usually affect both eyes.\n\nSee the main reference on page 1251 (The Cat With Abnormalities Confined to the Cornea).\n\nOne, or more commonly, both corneas have focal white to gray opacities in the anterior stroma.\n\nThe condition is asymptomatic, as cats show no signs of ocular pain or irritation, and there is no associated inflammation in the cornea.\n\nThe condition has only been described in the USA.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on clinical signsmultiple focal opacities in the anterior stroma of the cornea, not associated with irritation or inflammation.\n\nRhinosporidium was initially diagnosed from histological samples. However, ultrastructural examination of affected cornea showed vacuoles with amorphous material and rod-like organisms characteristic of mycobacteria that stain positively with Ziehl-Neelsen carbolfuchsin stain. \n\nRare disease of young Manx cats. Cats present with an axial (central) stromal edema which progresses to diffuse corneal edema and a thickened corneal stroma filled with bullae (fluid-filled vesicles).\n\nAffected cats become blind.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the presentation of a young Manx cat with corneal edema.\n\nA definitive diagnosis is based on histopathology.\n\n\u2022 Histology demonstrates progressive disintegration of stromal collagen fibers, which are replaced with fluid-filled vesicles. Eventually the epithelium separates from its basement membrane and ulceration occurs.\n\n\u2022 Cloudy anterior chamber from anterior uveitis is the most common sign. \u2022 +/-Gray to tan-colored nodules on the iris surface (lymphocytic-plasmacytic uveitis). \u2022 Cloudy vitreous (chorioretinitis and optic neuritis). \u2022 Rarely, systemic signs may be seen concurrently with ocular signs. \u2022 These include fever, weight loss, +/muscular pain, +/signs of respiratory or neurological disease. \n\nSystemic signs are rare but may include: \u2022 Fever, weight loss and muscle pain.\n\n\u2022 Respiratory signs associated with pneumonia.\n\n\u2022 Signs of multifocal neurologic disease.\n\n\u2022 Liver disease.\n\nOcular signs are more common, and may include one or all of the following signs: \u2022 Anterior uveitis is the most common sign and is seen as a cloudy anterior chamber. This is caused by leakage of protein and white blood cells from inflamed iris and ciliary body blood vessels into the aqueous humor. It is also known as hypopyon. \u2022 In severe cases of uveitis, the cornea may be cloudy due to edema caused by aqueous leakage through a compromised endothelium. \u2022 Keratic precipitates may be seen on the surface of the endothelium. These are the so-called \"mutton fat\" deposits that consist of white cells and protein attached to the endothelium. They are more common in the inferior cornea. \u2022 Cloudy vitreous caused by chorioretinitis; white cells and protein leak into the vitreous through inflamed retinal and choroidal blood vessels. \u2022 Lymphocytic plasmocytic uveitis is seen as pale nodules on the iris surface. \u2022 Secondary cataract formation is common in chronic cases, and will be seen as a cloudy eye within the pupil space. \u2022 Glaucoma is a sequel to chronic uveitis. \u2022 Signs may be unilateral or bilateral.\n\nA tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical signs.\n\nA definitive diagnosis requires supportive laboratory data which may include: \u2022 Serology.\n\n-Demonstration of a rise in IgM titers indicates a recent active infection. -Comparison of levels of aqueous humor T. gondii antibody levels with serum levels (Goldman-Witmer coefficient or C-value) has been advocated, with higher aqueous levels suggesting the anterior uveitis was caused by T. gondii. The use of C-values is still controversial. \u2022 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for parasite DNA in tissue or fluid samples. \n\nThe ocular form of the disease is usually seen in young cats from 6 months to 1 year of age.\n\nThe main presenting sign is uveitis. Large fibrin clots mixed with exudated white and red blood cells form a hypopyon. Keratic precipitates are common and appear as large pinkish, brown spots on the inferior endothelial surface of the cornea (\"mutton fat deposits\").\n\nThe vitreous may be hazy due to a similar exudation of cells from the ciliary body.\n\nThe retina may show a focal or total exudative retinal detachment. It is common to see an inflammatory exudate sheathing the major retinal blood vessels, which form a cloudy sheath around the vessels.\n\nBlindness may be seen with abnormal pupil reflexes (miotic in early stages with uveitis, followed by dilation in blind cases) and abnormal pupil size (anisocoria).\n\nCats with ocular signs frequently develop neurological signs, and die or are euthanized as a result of meningioencephalitis and its associated signs, which include behavioral changes, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures and head tremor (seizures most common).\n\nCats with ocular signs of FIP rarely show systemic signs of illness such as fever, inappetence and weight loss at the initial presentation. As the disease becomes chronic, weight loss and neurological signs develop.\n\nThere is no definitive diagnosis for FIP.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is initially based on clinical signs; a young cat with uveitis showing hypopyon and keratic precipitates.\n\nSerology is usually regarded as being of dubious benefit in the diagnosis, as the FIP organism cross-reacts with enteric forms of coronavirus.\n\nDiagnosis can only be confirmed on characteristic histopathology of affected tissues on biopsy or necropsy examination. The typical change is described as a pyogranulomatous vasculitis. Necrosis and a fibrinoid response are seen in some cases. The ocular cellular response includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and large, spindle-shaped histiocytes.\n\nCats often have a large increase in plasma total protein, globulin and IgG concentration, because of the chronic nature of the inflammatory disease process. The polyclonal increase in gammaglobulins is caused by virus antigen and cell destruction from the intense inflammation associated with the infection.\n\n\u2022 Discrete iris or ciliary body masses (FeLVassociated lymphosarcoma). \u2022 Anterior uveitis. \u2022 Intermittent asymmetric changes in pupil size, shape or response. \u2022 Other FeLV-associated signs, e.g. anemia.\n\n\u2022 Retinal detachment.\n\nSee the main reference on page 1300 (The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance).\n\nFeLV may cause ocular lymphosarcoma, which appears as discrete iris or ciliary body masses, usually bilateral, which may cause gross distortion of the iris structure.\n\nFeLV more commonly presents as a uveitis, with changes to iris appearance, and abnormal pupil size and shape. The anterior chamber may contain fibrin and/or blood. Anterior uveitis may occur in the absence of discernible intra-ocular neoplasia.\n\nSome cats develop spastic pupil syndrome, which presents as otherwise unexplainable intermittent asymmetric changes in pupil size, shape or response. For more detail see page 1300 (The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance).\n\nIt is possible to see retinal detachment when the neoplastic process involves the choroid.\n\nThere may be other signs of FeLV-associated disease, e.g. anemia or multicentric lymphosarcoma.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical signs observed in the eye, in association with other signs suggestive of FeLV, e.g. multicentric lymphoma, FeLV-associated anemia.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed on clinical pathology, for example on cytology of lymph nodes or aqueous centesis samples, or occasionally on hematology.\n\nA positive serological test using an antigen-based test for FeLV is supportive evidence of the disease. For more detail see page 543 (The Anemic Cat). \n\nMost cases present as anterior uveitis with corneal edema and a cloudy aqueous, and have some form of swelling seen in the iris, which may cause distortion of the pupil (dyscoria).\n\nVarious tumors occur in the eye. They may arise from the iris such as melanoma, lymphosarcoma, sarcoma and ciliary body tumors or arise from the retina including lymphosarcoma and adenocarcinoma from lung, uterus and undetermined origin.\n\nLymphosarcoma is the most common ocular neoplasm, and may be FeLV-associated, although more commonly does not appear to be associated with FeLV.\n\nLymphosarcoma often presents as bilateral iris swelling, and anterior chamber hypopyon and/or hemorrhage in a young cat, with or without other signs suggesting multicentric neoplasia.\n\nSigns of lymphosarcoma typically include: \u2022 The anterior chamber is cloudy from white blood cells and proteins that have leaked from diseased iris blood vessels. \u2022 The iris may have red cells on the surface mixed with protein and white blood cells caused by disruption of the endothelial cells on the blood vessel walls. Lymphosarcoma does not usually cause frank hemorrhage. Varying degrees of hyphema are present. \u2022 The iris appears thickened with a pale fleshy color change, and may be tinged with blood. \u2022 The pupil is distorted (dyscoria) if the iris is grossly distorted with infiltrated cells. \u2022 Glaucoma is often an associated complication. \u2022 Corneal edema may be present. \u2022 Regional lymph nodes may be increased in size.\n\nDiffuse iris melanoma typically appears as an enlarging area over months to years of light tan to dark brown pigmentation on the iris surface. Usually the neoplasm does not form an obvious discrete mass, but the iris may become diffusely thickened. The disease is usually unilateral and typically occurs in older cats. \u2022 Presentation may more resemble uveal inflammation than neoplasia. \u2022 Sometimes the disease may present in an advanced state with secondary glaucoma. \u2022 Amelanotic diffuse iris melanomas have also been reported. These are difficult to diagnose unless the effects of the tumor on angle obstruction and resultant glaucoma are observed.\n\nPost-traumatic sarcoma more commonly forms discrete masses within the eye.\n\nCiliary body adenoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm, which appears as a whitish to cream mass behind the pupil margin.\n\nMetastatic neoplasia from an extra-ocular primary tumor appears as an intra-ocular neoplasm involving the iris, and is associated with a similar neoplasm remote from the eye, e.g. mammary or uterine adenocarcinoma.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based initially on the appearance of the eye (uveitis, iris swelling and/or distortion of the retina) and consideration of the history.\n\nExamination of the buffy coat is useful for diagnosis of lymphosarcoma. The presence of abnormal plump lymphocytes with large prominent nucleoli is highly suggestive. Biopsy of regional lymph nodes is useful if there is lymphomegaly.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis may be obtained by fine-needle aspirate biopsies or anterior chamber centesis and cytology.\n\nSerology for FeLV may support the diagnosis of lymphosarcoma.\n\nChest and abdominal radiology and/or ultrasound may be indicated. \n\nCryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection affecting cats, and occurs throughout the world.\n\nThe initial ocular site for establishment of infection is usually the choroid, and the anterior uveal tract is often involved later in the course of the infection.\n\nCats may present with sudden blindness caused by multifocal granulomatous chorioretinitis with varying degrees of retinal detachment. \u2022 Vitreous flare (cloudy vitreous) is present, and makes the retina difficult to examine in cases with severe inflammation. \u2022 If the retina can be visualized, the granulomas appear as small swollen brownish discolored areas in the tapetal and non-tapetal retina.\n\nThere is usually anterior uveitis with corneal edema, anterior chamber flare (with or without hypopyon and keratic precipitates), swollen iris with varying degrees of posterior synechia causing a distorted pupil, and in chronic cases, new vascular growth on the anterior surface of the iris (pre-iridal fibrovascular membrane formation).\n\nSome cats present with exophthalmos (eye bulging forward), where there has been an extension of the disease from the sinuses and nasal cavity into the orbital tissues.\n\nIn cases with nasal infection, there may be a mucopurulent discharge with sneezing. Distortion and swelling over the bridge of nose, or a polyp-like mass projecting from the nasal cavity are present in 70% of cats with the respiratory form.\n\nChronic skin granulomas may be present. Skin lesions consist of papules or nodules varying from 0.1-1 cm in diameter. Lesions may ulcerate and exude serous fluid, or remain as intact nodules.\n\nCats with disseminated disease may show neurological signs.\n\nCats may present with chronic nasal or skin disease, and the ocular involvement is identified secondarily on physical examination. Cats may also be presented primarily for the ocular signs, where the owner has seen the development of a cloudy eye and the cat has gone blind.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on typical clinical signs of nasal or skin disease and concurrent ocular signs. The presence of small swollen brownish discolored areas in the retina suggests fungal disease. The frequency of occurrence of individual fungal diseases in the geographical area helps establish a tentative diagnosis.\n\nCytology can be very useful in the diagnosis of C. neoformans. Demonstration of the organism can be made via anterior chamber centesis or by fine-needle biopsy (using a 25-gauge needle) taken from the subretinal space. The sample is best stained with new methylene blue, Indian ink or Diff-Quick.\n\nSerology to detect capsule antigen is sensitive using serum, CSF fluid or urine.\n\nHistopathology from tissue biopsies demonstrates the organism.\n\nRadiology of the nasal cavity, sinuses and chest may be useful in cases that do not demonstrate nasal or skin signs.\n\nOcular ultrasound can be used to detect retinal detachment when anterior chamber flare, cataract or vitreal flare prevents ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus. It is also used in cases of exophthalmos to examine, and do ultrasound-guided biopsies of the orbital tissue.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Chorioretinitis progressing to anterior uveitis (cloudy eye) and endophthalmitis, in a geographical area where fungal infections occur. \n\nMost intra-ocular fungal infections cause similar ocular signs.\n\n\u2022 Choroidal granulomas are the most characteristic sign on fundoscopy, and appear as a raised area of tapetal hyporeflectivity, or small swollen brownish discolored areas in the retina. \u2022 A generalized chorioretinitis and secondary retinal detachments, with ballooning of the retina into the vitreous. \u2022 Optic neuritis may be present, seen as a red, swollen optic nerve that is hyperemic. \u2022 Anterior uveitis seen as cloudy, red eye with corneal edema, hypopyon and inflamed conjunctiva.\n\nAffected cats show varying degrees of blindness, depending on the severity of the ocular infection.\n\nSystemic signs can involve many other organs, especially the lungs, brain, nasal cavity, as well as the periorbital tissues, lymph nodes, bones, toenails and skin.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the presenting signs of a cat with rapidly progressive, usually bilateral chorioretinitis, progressing to anterior uveitis, with signs of other systemic disease, and occurring in a geographic area where such fungal disease is known to occur.\n\nImaging techniques can be used to obtain more supportive evidence of a deep fungal infection:\n\n\u2022 Thoracic radiography to demonstrate pulmonary granulomas. \u2022 Nasal cavity radiography. Serological tests can be performed, looking for elevated antibodies (blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidiodomycosis).\n\n\u2022 Eye may suddenly become very cloudy with a \"milky appearance\". \u2022 Unilateral or bilateral. \u2022 Idiopathic in Burmese cats associated with hyperlipidemia. \u2022 May occur in cats with uveitis that are on a high-fat diet.\n\nHigh concentrations of lipid can enter the anterior chamber from the uveal vessels if there is either:\n\n\u2022 Breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier in anterior uveitis. \u2022 Abnormally high concentrations of serum lipids, which can be secondary or primary hyperlipidemia.\n\nLipemic aqueous is idiopathic in Burmese cats associated with hyperlipidemia.\n\nTypically there is a diffusely and uniformly cloudy anterior chamber. The aqueous appears as if it is full of milk.\n\nUsually the iris, pupil and tapetal reflex can still be visualized.\n\nLipemic aqueous is often unilateral and may be sudden in onset.\n\nOccasionally it is associated with cats that have uveitis caused by systemic diseases such as toxoplasmosis, FIP, fungal infections, when they have hyperlipidemia caused by a high-fat content in the diet.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on clinical signs.\n\nA definitive diagnosis is based on biochemical analysis of aqueous centesis samples and demonstration of high serum lipid concentrations. Lipid electrophoretograms may be performed on the sample.\n\nDiagnosis of the underlying cause should be pursued, if lipemic acqueous is not in a predisposed breed such as the Burmese. If it is the result of a systemic disease combined with a high-fat diet, the underlying disease should be identified (see The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance, page 1294 and With Retinal Disease, page 1186).\n\nReduce plasma lipid concentrations using a low-fat diet.\n\nTreat other underlying medical problems, which are associated with hyperlipidemia such as diabetes mellitus, and systemic diseases causing uveitis (see The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance, page 1294). \n\nInflammation in the eye results in changes to the lens nutrition and accumulation of toxic products in the eye which results in death of cells. This will cause a cloudy lens (cataract).\n\nCataract is often associated with chronic uveitis caused by infectious agent such as toxoplasmosis or fungal disease.\n\nThe lens appears cloudy due to the formation of a cortical cataract.\n\nThe cataract may be unilateral or bilateral, but is more often unilateral. Vision is poor if bilateral.\n\nOther signs of uveitis will be present such as aqueous flare and fibrovascular membrane growth on the iris. The iris may have a darker color than the opposite eye, or have changes in contour due to adhesions of the iris to the anterior lens capsule (posterior synechia).\n\nThere may be changes in the cornea such as edema or scarring, with or without superficial vascularization.\n\nHypopyon or keratic precipitates may be evident.\n\nSome cats develop secondary glaucoma.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the signs of a cloudy lens or cataract. \n\n\u2022 Milky appearance of lens in cats older than 10 years of age. \u2022 Cats are usually visual and leading a normal lifestyle. \u2022 The fundus can be seen clearly with an ophthalmoscope.\n\nNuclear sclerosis is a normal aging process in the lens which starts in animals from about 8 years of age and is evident by 10 years.\n\nLens fibers are produced throughout life, but the lens does not increase in size. Therefore, the fibers in the center become thinner and pack closer together causing a slight opacity, termed sclerosis. As the lens ages further some of these fibers may break-down and then a nuclear cataract develops. In very old cats, the nuclear cataract may become quite dense with secondary changes in the surrounding cortex leading to a mature cataract.\n\nThe center of the lens becomes slightly cloudy, but the cat will be able to see quite well until the changes are advanced and become a cataract.\n\nNuclear sclerosis is seen from 10 years of age and cataracts typically occur in cats 12-20 years of age.\n\nOn ophthalmoscopic examination, the fundus will be clearly visible until a true cataract forms.\n\nDiagnosis of nuclear sclerosis is based on clinical signs of a slightly cloudy lens in an older cat, with vision intact. The fundus can be clearly seen with an ophthalmoscope.\n\nDiagnosis of senile cataract is based on clinical signs of a cloudy lens in an older cat, with no history or signs of preceding ocular trauma or inflammation.\n\nThere is no definitive treatment for this aging change.\n\nIf a cataract develops and the cat is healthy, cataract surgery can be performed. Because senile cataract occurs in aged cats, it is important to check renal function and blood pressure before proceeding with surgery.\n\n\u2022 History of previous eye injury, frequently caused by a cat claw. \u2022 Cornea has scar from old wound. \u2022 \u00b1 Anterior or posterior synechia (iris adhesions to cornea or lens). \u2022 Lens may be partially or completely cloudy. \u2022 \u00b1 Chronic inflammation (uveitis) caused by lens protein outside the capsule.\n\nAny injury to the lens fibers will disrupt the normal lens metabolism, and cause death of lens fibers leading to cataract formation.\n\nThe most common cause of lens injury in cats is from cat fights when a cat claw penetrates the globe and tears the anterior lens capsule. This may be obvious when the tear is visible through the pupil, but some injuries occur under the iris root in the equator of the lens and are not possible to visualize.\n\nOther causes of injury are blunt trauma, which is frequently associated with motor vehicle accidents. With blunt trauma, the sudden compression of the eye followed by rapid decompression causes rupture of the lens capsule.\n\nOnce the nutrition of the lens fibers is disturbed, the cells will start to die and become opaque, resulting in typical cloudy lens and cataract formation.\n\nAn injured lens in a cat can lead to sarcoma formation due to metaplasia of the lens epithelial cells. See pages 1276 (Feline intra-ocular sarcoma).\n\nTypically, there is a history or signs of eye trauma, usually a cat-fight claw injury or blunt trauma. The cornea may have a scar from an old wound.\n\nLens may be partially or completely cloudy because of an immature or mature cataract.\n\nIn anterior capsule tears, lens material can be seen in the anterior chamber as a cloudy flocculent material.\n\nThere is intense inflammation associated with leakage of lens material, and it may be difficult to see through a very cloudy cornea.\n\nTears in the equatorial region of the lens may often be sealed by the ciliary body and iris root, and only develop a local cataract. Generally, an injury to the lens fibers will lead to a mature cataract.\n\nWhere the eye has hyphema (red eye), the lens will not be able to be seen ophthalmoscopically.\n\nOften the tear in the lens capsule has iris pigment adhered to it, visible as a black area. Anterior or posterior synechia (iris adhesions to cornea or lens) may be evident.\n\nBe aware that cats with chronic inflammation after trauma often have a ruptured lens causing chronic lens-induced uveitis.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on a history or signs of eye trauma and the presence of a mature or immature cataract.\n\nIn acute cases, lens material is visible in the anterior chamber.\n\nIn chronic cases, chronic uveitis is evident after an eye injury.\n\nOcular ultrasound is a very useful tool for detecting lens rupture. Look for the normal position of the lens as seen by the anterior and posterior hyperechoic line defining the anterior and posterior lens capsule. In high-quality machines with a 10-MHz probe, the lens shape and position can be visualized quite easily. Any change to the appearance or lack of hyperechoic lines is suspicious for lens rupture.\n\nIf there is corneal edema and the anterior chamber is filled with blood and protein, treat the eye with broadspectrum antibiotics topically and systemically. Inflammation should be controlled initially with NSAIDs. If the lens is ruptured, corticosteroids systemically will be needed to control the lens-induced uveitis, which is an immune reaction in the eye against the exposed lens fibers.\n\nIf the injury has recently occurred, and the cornea and anterior chamber allows visualization of the lens, a lentectomy should be performed immediately. This treatment is controversial because of the danger of sarcoma formation later in life.\n\nCataract surgery can be performed later if a mature cataract develops.\n\nCats with an injured lens have a high risk of developing ocular sarcoma, and enucleation should be considered.\n\n\u2022 Nuclear cataract in a young healthy cat that with no evidence of ocular inflammation.\n\nIn contrast to dogs, genetic cataract is rare in cats, but has been reported.\n\nCongenital cataract is seen when the lens development is disrupted or altered in the early embryonic development of the eye.\n\nAs the nucleus is the first part of the lens to develop, this is the usual area of cataract development seen in young cats (nuclear cataract). As the cat ages, the lens cortex may become cataractous and the eye develops a mature cataract.\n\nCloudy lens in a young cat with no history of illness and no sign of inflammation in the eye.\n\nVision is reduced or absent if both eyes are affected.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the classical appearance of a cloudy lens in a young healthy cat, which has no evidence of ocular inflammation.\n\nCataract surgery can be done by a trained ophthalmologist if the globe and retina is normal.\n\n\u2022 Ocular ultrasound should be done to determine whether the retina is detached. A 10-MHz probe should be used. Detached retinas are seen as faint lines bulging into the vitreous between the optic disc and ora serrata. \u2022 Electroretinography can be done to determine whether the retina has normal rod and cone function.\n\n\u2022 Rare finding in older cat with diabetes mellitus. \u2022 Cloudy lens with immature to mature cataract.\n\nDiabetic cataract forms because the lens is bathed in a solution that is very high in glucose. The lens cells cannot metabolize the excess glucose by normal anaerobic glycolysis, and therefore uses aerobic glycolysis using the sorbitol pathway and the enzyme aldose reductase as the catalyst. The by-product of this process is sugar alcohol (sorbitol), which kills the cell. The sugar alcohol is a large molecule that cannot escape through the cell wall, and results in a more concentrated intracellular fluid than the surrounding fluid. Water is therefore imbibed into the cell, which causes it to swell and rupture. This in turn causes an immune reaction within the eye called lens-induced uveitis.\n\nDiabetic cataracts are rare in cats. This is thought to be due to low levels of the enzyme aldose reductase in old cats, which prevents the lens cells from using the sorbitol pathway to the same degree as other animals.\n\nCloudy lens and poor vision in a cat with diabetes mellitus.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the signs of a cloudy lens consistent with an immature to mature cataract in a cat with diabetes mellitus.\n\nCataract surgery can be done successfully by a trained ophthalmologist. \n\nHypertension causes vasoconstriction of pre-capillary retinal arterioles. Hypoxia of the arteriole causes smooth muscle necrosis, which leads to vascular dilatation, and leakage of serum and blood.\n\nLeakage from vessels causes serous retinal detachment, and subretinal, intraretinal or preretinal hemorrhage.\n\nRetinal blood vessels may rupture, causing hemorrhage into the vitreous.\n\nHypertensive retinopathy occurs most commonly secondary to chronic renal disease and hyperthyroidism.\n\nClassical signs are acute onset of vision loss in an old cat, which is usually bilateral. The cat suddenly starts to bump into things, appears to be lost, and has very cautious movements.\n\nThe pupils are usually dilated, and non-responsive or poorly responsive light.\n\nAffected eyes appear slightly cloudy, and there may be focal red areas visible through the pupil, as a result of retinal hemorrhage. The vitreous may appear red. Early cases may show hemorrhage along the larger retinal blood vessels.\n\nIt is difficult to visualize the retina on fundoscopic examination, as it appears out of focus. This is caused by retinal detachment, with the retina ballooning into the vitreous, and appears as a thin veil of pale tissue.\n\nThese cats may have cardiomegaly, and left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nThere may be other signs suggestive of hypertension, for example, a bounding cardiac apex beat.\n\nSystolic arterial blood pressure is usually greater than 160 mmHg.\n\nOther signs suggestive of renal and/or thyroid disease, such as progressive weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria and azotemia may be present.\n\nClinicians should suspect this problem in any old cat that has suddenly gone blind.\n\nOphthalmoscopy will demonstrate vitreal hemorrhage.\n\nThe retina will appear out of focus, and hemorrhage adjacent to the major retinal blood vessels is visible.\n\nBlood pressure is most commonly measured in the cat using Doppler technology. Arterial blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy. Most cats with clinical signs have a blood pressure of greater than 200 mmHg.\n\nBUN, creatinine and urine protein:creatinine ratios are useful clinical pathology parameters to check renal function.\n\nThyroid function should be checked by measuring plasma thyroxine (T4) concentration.\n\nFurther useful procedures include cardiac ultrasound, and in some cases, imaging of the thyroid with radioisotopes.\n\nAmlodipine (Norvasc, Pfizer) is a calcium channel blocker, which has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. The dose is approximately 0.625 mg/cat/day, i.e. 1/4 of a 2.5 mg tablet (USA) or 1/8 of a 5 mg tablet (Australia).\n\nThe use of corticosteroids is controversial.\n\nIf hypertension is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, then calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem may be used. For more detail see main reference on page 162 for details (The Cat With Tachycardia, Bradycardia or an Irregular Rhythm).\n\nb-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal) can also be used in the management of the cardiac disease at 1/4 of a 10 mg tablet q 8 h.\n\nHyperthyroidism when present, should be treated using surgery, radioactive iodine (131-I) or anti-thyroid drugs such as carbimazole or methimazole. For more detail see main reference on page 305 (The Cat With Weight Loss and a Good Appetite).\n\nCats with renal disease should be placed on appropriate medical and dietary management. For more details see the main reference on page 337 (The Thin, Inappetent Cat).\n\n\u2022 Show signs of mild uveitis.\n\n\u2022 \"Snowbank\" inflammation of the pars plana seen through dilated pupil. Appears as cloudy outer vitreous in this area. \u2022 May be other systemic signs such as loss of weight, inappetence and fever.\n\nInfection with the virus usually occurs as a result of a bite from another FIV-positive cat. Transmission in saliva by grooming is thought possible, but rare.\n\nAfter infection a viremic phase occurs, which may be associated with a transient fever, generalized lymphadenopathy and neutropenia. An asymptomatic carrier state or chronic disease then follows.\n\nCats that develop signs of FIV may have evidence of generalized systemic disease such as weight loss, and poor body and coat condition. Pyrexia, lymphadenopathy and infections of the oral cavity, respiratory tract, skin and other sites may occur.\n\nIn the eye, pars planitis or \"snow bank\" inflammation of the pars plana resulting in vitreous cloudiness is thought to be almost pathognomonic for FIV infection. Other signs of uveitis can also be seen, such as cloudy aqueous and iris inflammation.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the clinical signs of vitreous cloudiness described as \"snow bank\" inflammation, in a FIV-positive cat.\n\nSupportive treatment is indicated, and depends on the organ system affected.\n\nThe use of steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for the ocular lesion has to be weighed against the potential immunosuppressive effects.\n\n\u2022 Rare, primary neoplasia that occurs in older cats (7-15 years). \u2022 History of previous severe trauma to eye. \u2022 Anterior uveitis, keratitis (corneal edema and pigmentation) and glaucoma. \u2022 White to pinkish masses may be visible in the vitreous.\n\nIntra-ocular sarcoma is a rare primary neoplasia reported only in cats.\n\nIt is occurs in older cats 7-15 years of age, that have had a history of ocular trauma 3-10 years previously.\n\nThere may be signs of anterior uveitis with keratitis, with edema and pigmentation of the cornea. These changes may prevent visualization of the intra-ocular structures.\n\nSecondary glaucoma is common at this stage of the disease. The eye will show buphthalmos (enlarged globe) with engorged scleral vessels.\n\nIf the posterior segment of the eye can be visualized, white to pink masses may be seen in the vitreous.\n\nThe condition is thought to occur after lens trauma, which triggers the lens epithelial cells to undergo metaplasia.\n\nThe neoplasia rapidly extends through the choroid and infiltrates the optic nerve. Metastasis has been reported.\n\nSurvival rate is very low.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the signalment, history and signs of an old cat with a prior history of trauma and signs of glaucoma, uveitis and keratitis.\n\nA definitive diagnosis is based on histological examination of tissue.\n\n\u2022 Fine-needle biopsy can be attempted, but may not yield a diagnostic sample if the tumor contains fibrous and cartilagenous tissue. \u2022 Histopathology of enucleated globes shows changes that may include granulation tissue, fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and anaplastic spindle cell sarcoma.\n\nAll blind globes with chronic uveitis should be watched for the development of this condition.\n\nEarly enucleation with histopathology should be done on all globes with a prior history of trauma whenever there are changes in the size and shape of the globe, or changes in the anterior chamber and cornea indicative of intra-ocular disease.\n\nSeverely traumatized blind eyes in cats should be enucleated to prevent the occurrence of this condition, particularly if there has been lens rupture.\n\nCheck for metastases to regional lymph nodes and other organs such as lungs and liver prior to surgery."}
