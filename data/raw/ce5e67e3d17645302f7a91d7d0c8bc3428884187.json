{"title": "Supplementary Text: The spatial resolution of epidemic peaks", "body": "Proof By Theorem 0.1 it is true that for the matrices C and B where C = B T , the spectral radius of C and B is the same: \u03c1(C) = \u03c1(B). By Theorem 0.2 it is true that the spectral radius of matrix C is bounded by the limits of the row sums of matrix C: min(\n\nAs C = B T the row sums of matrix C are equivalent to the column sums of matrix B: min( j c ij ) = min( i b ij ). Therefore it follows that Eqn. S1 may be equivalently written:\n\nwhere T was the time spent infected (which depended on recovery rate r such that T = 1 r , same for all pixels), N i was the number of individuals in pixel i, infectious contacts were made with other individuals present in the pixel with rate \u03b2 and m was the mobility matrix defined earlier. We let D k=1 m ki N k = N N i , the total number of individuals in pixel i at any time (where m ki is the probability that for an individual from pixel k, given that the individual made a contact, this contact was with an individual from pixel i). Recall that D k=1 m jk = 1. Then summing the jth column of the next generation matrix gives:\n\nThis holds for all columns j of G. Therefore using Corollary S1.3 it follows that \u03c1(G) = \u03b2T . This holds for all values of s d and \u03b3 in the mobility matrix m and for any resolution (any number of pixels over the same region).\n\nWe showed in the main text that the final epidemic size (the final cumulative attack rate) for a population was the same at all resolutions and all mobilities we considered (as long as for all pixels, i and j, m ij > 0). Here we demonstrate how this is an outcome of the particular way our model was defined. The derivation is based on those in Refs. [3, 4] .\n\nOur SIR meta-population model can be defined as a system of differential equations as follows:\n\nwhere r is the recovery rate and \u03bb i is the force of infection in pixel i:\n\nD is the total number of pixels, m is the mobility model and N i is the total number of individuals in pixel i. Transmission occurs during a contact between an infected and a susceptible individual at a rate \u03b2.\n\nThen it is straightforward to show that a final equilibrium exists, we represent this equilibrium as S i (\u221e), I i (\u221e) and R i (\u221e) and we can show that I i (\u221e) = 0 and S i (\u221e) + R i (\u221e) = N i .\n\nWe have shown earlier that R 0 for the system is constant and R 0 = \u03b2T , where T = 1 r , the mean infectious period.\n\nIn each pixel i the fraction who did not get infected is \u03c3 i = S i (\u221e) S i (0) , so the final epidemic size in each pixel is x i = N i (1 \u2212 \u03c3 i ) (recall that N i is the total population in pixel i). Then the total final epidemic size in the whole population is\n\nWe divide dS i dt (Eqn. (S4)) by S i and integrate between 0 and \u221e, then we have:\n\nand we note that:\n\nand as it is also true that:\n\nwe can write (recalling that 1 r = T ):\n\nNow, with the condition that m ij > 0 for all i, j (i.e. there is always some contact between every pixel), then if the total final epidemic size is non-zero, then the final epidemic size in each pixel, x i or (1 \u2212 \u03c3 i ), is also non-zero [3] . To see this, let an arbitrary pixel i have no infection, so \u03c3 i = 1, then Eqn. (S11) implies that\n\n(S13)\n\nBut, as m ij > 0, then for the left hand side to be zero it must be that (1 \u2212 \u03c3 l ) = 0 for all l, so no pixel has infection. Therefore, if Z > 0 then x i > 0 for all pixels i. Now, we focus on the RHS of Eqn. (S11). Note that the matrix m (mobility) is a positive, right stochastic matrix, as its rows sum to 1. Therefore, \u03c1(m) = 1 (by definition of a stochastic matrix, and using Corollary S1.3).\n\nWe can simplify the RHS as follows (recall that D p=1 m pj N p = N N j :\n\n, then the RHS of Eqn.\n\n(S11) is the ith row of matrix C multiplied by (1-\u03c3), which is a vector of length D with entries (1\u2212\u03c3 j ). Note that the matrix C is mathematically similar to R, the next generation matrix (defined in Eqn. (S2)); this means that there exists a matrix \u2206, such that C = \u2206 \u22121 R\u2206. In this case, \u2206 is the D x D matrix with the number of individuals in each pixel, N i , on its diagonal. As C and R are similar, they have the same spectral radius: \u03c1(C) = \u03c1(R) = R 0 = \u03b2T . We note that the row sums of C are all equal to \u03b2T , the proof is similar to that for the column sums of R in the next generation matrix simplification (i.e. note that D j=1 D l=1 m ij m lj N l N N j = 1).\n\nThen, as all rows are equal, transmission in each patch is equal (to \u03b2T ) and so, as in [3] , the final fraction infected is given implicitly by F = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212R 0 F ). With R 0 = 1.8 as in the main text, this can be solved numerically to give F = 0.73243, as we saw from the simulations."}
