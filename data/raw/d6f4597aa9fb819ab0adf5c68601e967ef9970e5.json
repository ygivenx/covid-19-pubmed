{"title": "Supplementary Information 6: Evidence Narratives for Additional Feline Infections Vector-borne agents Leishmaniasis", "body": "The available evidence for Leishmania spp. as a cause of IMHA in cats is negligible. However, given the lack of data, the role of this pathogen in the pathogenesis of feline IMHA cannot be ruled out.\n\nOne study by Limlenglert et al was evaluated. 2 This study did not ask whether IMHA was associated with infection. Five cats were Coombs'-positive; of these 5 cats, 3 were FIVpositive. Of the 3 Coombs'-positive, FIV-positive cats, 1 cat was also FIP-positive.\n\nnegligible. Further study is required to determine if IMHA contributes to anemia in some FIVinfected cats.\n\nA total of 3 studies were evaluated. [2] [3] [4] Each of the studies identified at least 1 cat with a Coombs'-positive anemia and FIP infection. In the study by Limlenglert et al, the FIP-infected cat was also infected with FIV; an IME value could not be assigned. The remaining 2 studies were respectively associated with IME values of 2.20 and 3.62. 3, 4 Consensus Summary Statement: The overall evidence that FIP infection induces IMHA in cats is negligible. However, given the immune mechanisms underlying effusive FIP, combined with the lack of conclusive studies, a role for this virus in IMHA cannot be ruled out. Of note, false positive Coombs', saline agglutination, and flow cytometric assays for surface antibody may hypothetically occur as a consequence of non-specific antibody adsorption to RBCs.\n\nFew cases of cats with focal bacterial infections suspected to cause IMHA have been reported in the literature. [3] [4] [5] Owing to the presence of multiple co-morbidities in individual cats, an IME value (1.70) could only be assigned for abscessation.\n\nSimilar to the situation in dogs, the evidence for localized bacterial infections inducing IMHA in cats is negligible, but is difficult to evaluate from available studies. Bacterial infection cannot be ruled out as a cause of IMHA in cats, and further investigation of this possibility may be warranted.\n\nNon-hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. have been associated with IMHA in some species. 6, 7 One case report describes a cat infected with M. gatae that initially developed signs of inflammatory joint disease and shortly after developed a Coombs'-positive anemia, 8 suggesting that M. gatae was the causative agent. The IME value for this study was 3.82.\n\nThe evidence for Mycoplasma gatae causing IMHA cats is low, and currently limited to a single case report. Based on the observation that Mycoplasma spp.\n\ninfection cause cold agglutinins in other species, M. gatae may be considered as a possible etiology of feline IMHA, but further studies are needed to confirm this possibility and the clinical significance of cold agglutinins in cats."}
