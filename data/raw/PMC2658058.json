{"title": "Structural Basis of Inhibition Specificities of 3C and 3C-like Proteases by\nZinc-coordinating and Peptidomimetic Compounds*S\u20de", "body": "Preparation of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, CoV-229E 3CLpro, and CVB3\n3Cpro\u2014SARS-CoV 3CLpro was prepared as described\npreviously (21). The gene encoding CoV-229E\n3CLpro was cloned from viral cDNA obtained from Tri-Service General Hospital\n(Taipei, Taiwan) using PCR. Primers (forward,\n5\u2032-CGCGGATCCATCGAAGGTCGTGCTGGTTTGCGCAAAATGGCAC-3\u2032\n(encoding Factor Xa cleavage site); and reverse,\n(5\u2032-CCGCTCGAGTCATTGCAGGTTAACACCAAACATTTGTTTG-3\u2032)\ncontaining BamHI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) were used. The PCR product was digested\nby BamHI and XhoI and then ligated into pGEX-6p-1 vector (GE Healthcare), which contains a\nglutathione S-transferase tag at the N terminus.\n\nThe gene encoding CVB 3Cpro was cloned from viral cDNA obtained from Chang-Gung\nMemorial Hospital (Tao-Yuan, Taiwan) by PCR. Primers (forward,\n5\u2032-CATGCCATGGGCCCTGCCTTTGAGTT-3\u2032; and reverse,\n5\u2032-GCGCTCGAGTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTGCTCATCATTGAAGTAGTG-3\u2032)\ncontaining NcoI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) were used for C-terminal His6\ntag construction. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and XhoI, and the DNA fragment were\ncloned into pET16b (Novagen). The correct constructs were subsequently transformed to\nEscherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) for protein expression. Overnight culture (5\nml) of a single transformation was used to inoculate 500 ml of fresh LB medium containing 100\n\u03bcg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown to A600 = 0.6 and\ninduced with 1 mm isopropyl-\u03b2-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 \u00b0C. After 16\nh, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 \u00d7 g for 15\nmin.\n\nPurification of the proteases was conducted at 4 \u00b0C. His-tagged CVB3 3Cpro\nwas purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and eluted with 25 mm\nTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. The protein solution was\ndialyzed against 2\u00d7 2L buffer (containing 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120\nmm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 1\nmm dithiothreitol). The 229E 3CLpro was purified using a glutathione\nS-transferase column and then treated with Factor Xa to remove the fusion tag.\nFor further purity improvement and buffer exchange of both enzymes, a HiTrap\u2122 26/10 QFF\ncolumn (GE Healthcare) was used with the buffers, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH\n7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (for CVB3 3Cpro) and 1\nm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for 229E 3CLpro). The purified\nproteins were concentrated for crystallization.\n\nPeptide Synthesis and Examination of Substrate Specificity\u2014The\npeptides used for testing as protease substrates were synthesized by using a 433A peptide\nsynthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Starting with 0.10 mmol (0.101 g) of\np-hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl polystyrene resin (1.01 mmol/g), synthesis was\nperformed using a stepwise FastMoc protocol (Applied Biosystems). The amino acids were\nintroduced using the manufacturer's prepacked cartridges (1 mmol each). Mass spectra of the\nsynthesized peptides were obtained using the Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer with an electrospray\nion source.\n\nFor examining the substrate specificity of the protease, each peptide at 50\n\u03bcm was incubated with 1 \u03bcm protease for 12 h, and the\nresulting mixture was analyzed by C-18 reverse-phase HPLC using the above mentioned conditions.\nThe peak areas of the product were integrated to calculate the reaction rate of each peptide\nsubstrate under catalysis of the protease. The optimal peptide substrate was labeled with a\nfluorescence quenching pair; thereby the fluorogenic peptide (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) could\nbe used to measure the protease activity.\n\nProtease Activity Assays\u2014By using the fluorogenic peptide, the\nkinetic measurements were performed in 10 mm MES (pH 6.5, the optimal pH for protease\nactivity) at 25 \u00b0C. Enhanced fluorescence due to cleavage of the peptide was monitored\nat 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent, Thermo\nScientific). The enzyme concentration used in measuring Km and\nkcat values was 0.5 \u03bcm, and the substrate\nconcentrations were 0.5\u20135-fold the Km value. Substrate\nconcentration was determined by using the extinction coefficients 5438\nm\u20131 cm\u20131 at 336 nm (Edans) and 15,100\nm\u20131 cm\u20131 at 472 nm (Dabcyl). The initial rate,\nwithin 10% of the substrate consumption, was used to calculate the kinetic parameters using\nMichaelis-Menten equation fitting with the KaleidaGraph computer program (Synergy Software).\n\nEnzyme Inhibition Assay\u2014For inhibition constant measurements of CVB3\n3Cpro, reactions were performed with 0.5 \u03bcm protease and 10\n\u03bcm fluorogenic peptide in a buffer of 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 25\n\u00b0C. The fluorescence change resulting from the reaction was followed with time using a\n96-well fluorescence plate reader. To determine the inhibitory effect of various compounds, the\ncompound and the enzyme were preincubated at 25 \u00b0C for 20 min prior to the addition of\nthe substrate. The inhibition constant of SARS 3CLpro was analyzed with reverse-phase\nHPLC using a C-18 column. Ki was calculated as described previously\n(18, 20).\n\nCrystallization\u2014All inhibitors, including TG-0204998, TG-0205486, and\nzinc N-ethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamate (EPDTC), were dissolved\nin DMSO. Using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method, the enzyme solution was mixed with\ninhibitor solutions at a molar ratio of 1:5 for 20 min before being combined with equal amounts\nof reservoir. 3CLpro-EPDTC crystal of CoV-229E was obtained using a reservoir of 18%\nPEG 6000, 10% DMSO, 14% methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), and 0.12 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The\ncrystals were flash-frozen with 20\u201325% ethylene glycol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant. For\nCVB3 3Cpro and 3Cpro-EPDTC crystals, a solution of 24% PEG 4000 and 0.1\nm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was used as the reservoir. Native CVB3 3Cpro was\ncrystallized using 25% PEG 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl,\npH 8.5, to give two monoclinic forms with space groups P21 (form I)\nand C2 (form II). The second crystal form was obtained when the enzyme solution\nwas mixed with the reservoir at a volume ratio of 3:2. The other two CVB3 3Cpro\ncrystals, the TG-0204998 complex and the inactive C147A mutant, were obtained using a reservoir\nsolution of 24\u201330% PEG 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m\nTris-HCl, pH 7.5\u20138.5. These crystals were rinsed with 26% glycerol as a cryoprotectant\nprior to data collection. Crystals of SARS 3CLpro complexed with TG-0204998 and\nTG-0205486 were obtained using a reservoir solution of 3\u20136% PEG 6000, 4\u20136% DMSO\nor MPD, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, and a cryoprotectant of\n25\u201330% glycerol or ethylene glycol. All diffraction data were collected at cryogenic\ntemperatures and processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (22).\n\nStructure Determination\u2014All crystal structures were determined by\nmolecular replacement using the program AMoRe (23).\nUsing the SWISS-MODEL server (24) and the human RV\n3Cpro (1CQQ; 4) structure as a template, a CV3B 3Cpro model was generated\nto solve its EPDTC complex structure. The remaining CV 3Cpro crystal structures were\nsolved using the partially refined 3Cpro-EPDTC complex structure as a search model.\nFor SARS 3CLpro and CoV-229E 3CLpro complex structures, 1Z1I (25) and 1P9S (26)\nwere used as the search models for molecular replacement, respectively.\n\nThe program CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) (27)\nwas used for structure refinement. All manual modifications of the models were performed using\nthe program XtalView (28). Difference Fourier\n(Fo \u2013 Fc) maps were calculated\nto locate the inhibitors and solvent molecules. Data collection and final model statistics are\nshown in Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure\nfactors of the various structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (see Table 1).\n\n\n\nDetection of Coxsackievirus B3 by RT-PCR\u2014The confluent human\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells in 12-well plates were infected or mock-infected by\ncoxsackievirus B3 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, with treatment of compound TG-0204998\nat 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 \u03bcm or compound TG-0205221 at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 50\n\u03bcm. Forty-eight hours after infection, total culture supernatants were\nharvested from the culture medium, and the supernatants of cell platelets were disrupted by\nfreeze-thaw method. Viral RNA, extracted from 150 \u03bcl of total culture supernatant using\nthe viral RNA extraction mini-prep system kit (Viogene, Sunnyvale, CA) with the protocol\nrecommended by the manufacturer, was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated\nwater. RT-PCR amplifications were performed using a Reverse iT\u2122 one-step RT-PCR kit\n(Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK) using the primer set specific for pan-enterovirus detection (29). RT-PCR was carried out in a 25-\u03bcl reaction\nmixture containing 11 \u03bcl of RNA template, 0.5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcm\nforward and reverse primers, 0.5 \u03bcl of kit-supplied enzyme mixture, and 12.5 \u03bcl\nof 2\u00d7 RT-PCR Master Mix. The RT step included incubation at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h and\nthen at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C\nfor 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min and a final elongation step of 72 \u00b0C for 5 min.\nPCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing 2 \u03bcg/ml\nethidium bromide. The DNA bands were visualized and photographed through UV\ntransillumination.\n\nSubstrate Specificity and Kinetics of CVB3 3Cpro\u2014The\npeptides corresponding to the autoprocessing sites of CVB3 3Cpro included LAGHQ\n\u2193 GLPTM between vp2 and vp3, QNFFQ \u2193 GPVED between vp3 and vp1, DAMEQ \u2193\nGVKDY between P2A and P2B, MAERQ \u2193 NNSWL between P2B and P2C, EALFQ \u2193 GPPVY\nbetween P2C and P3A, FAGFQ \u2193 GAYTG between P3A and VPg, QAKVQ \u2193 GPAFE between\nVPg and 3C, FNDEQ \u2193 GEIEF between 3C and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and SAVLQ\n\u2193 SGFRK derived from the N-terminal autoprocessing site of 3CLpro from\nSARS-CoV (almost all of which contained a Gln followed by a small amino acid (Gly or Ser) to\nserve as the cleavage site) were tested as substrates for the protease (\u2193 indicates the\ncleavage site). Surprisingly, CVB3 3Cpro showed substantially better activity\n(30-fold) against SAVLQ \u2193 SGFRK, the substrate of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, than its\nown cleavage sites based on the HPLC assay (Fig.\n1A). Therefore, the peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans, with the\nfluorescence quenching pair Dabcyl-Edans, was chosen for CVB3 protease activity assay by\nmonitoring the fluorescence increase due to peptide bond cleavage in real time. The\nkcat (Vmax/[E]) and\nKm values of the protease using this fluorogenic substrate were\ndetermined to be 6.2 \u00d7 10\u20133 s\u20131 and 9.2 \u00b1\n1.7 \u03bcm, respectively (Fig.\n1B).\n\nEvaluation of Inhibitors\u2014Because CVB3 3Cpro showed\nsubstrate specificity similar to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, our reported\n3CLpro inhibitors were tested against the recombinant 3Cpro of CVB3 by\nusing the fluorogenic substrate to determine their inhibitory activities. EPDTC, which inhibited\nSARS protease with a Ki of 1 \u03bcm (19), showed lower inhibition against CVB3 3Cpro\n(Ki = 4.4 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcm) (Fig. S1). From the\ninhibition pattern, it was shown to be competitive with respect to the substrate. For the\npeptidomimetic inhibitors, the Ki values of TG-0203770, TG-0204998,\nTG-0205221, and TG-0205486 against SARS-CoV 3CLpro were 0.058, 0.038, 0.054, and\n0.099 \u03bcm, respectively. The Ki values of TG-0203770\nand TG-0205221 are reported elsewhere (20). Larger\nKi values of 1.5, 0.8, 2.5, and 0.4 \u03bcm for the\nfour compounds against CVB3 3Cpro were observed, indicating their lower affinity\ntoward CVB3 3Cpro (Table 2). TG-0204998 and\nTG-0205486 have similar structures, differing only by an extra cyclopropyl group at the\nP1\u2032 residue, and they also possess similar potency with a Ki\nof 0.8 and 0.4 \u03bcm, respectively, against CVB3 3Cpro.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructures of CVB3 3Cpro and CoV 3CLpro\u2014Two\ncrystal forms belonging to the monoclinic space groups P21 (form I)\nand C2 (form II), of CVB3 3C protease were obtained under similar\ncrystallization conditions (Table 1). Form I crystal\nhas two molecules per asymmetric unit related by a pseudo-dyad; form II crystal has only one\nmolecule. As shown in Fig. 2A, the\nstructure of CVB3 3Cpro adopts a chymotrypsin protein fold similar to those of RV\n3Cpro (4) and other viral 3C proteases. The\nroot-mean-square deviation between CVB3 3Cpro and RV 3Cpro is 0.73\n\u00c5 for 166 C\u03b1 atoms. The N terminus starts with an \u03b1-helix of residues\n1\u201314 and is followed by two topologically equivalent \u03b2-barrel domains comprising\nresidues 15\u201377 and 99\u2013173, which pack together to form an extended shallow\ngroove for substrate binding. The catalytic triad of Cys147, His40, and\nGlu71 is located in the cleft between the two \u03b2-barrel domains. The protease\nstructures in the two crystal forms are very similar, except that the loop of residues\n143\u2013146 is disordered, the side chain of Cys147 has a different orientation,\nand His40 is slightly shifted in the form II crystal (Fig. 2A). This loop is flexible on the protein surface, which may\nregulate the substrate binding. Such variable loop conformation was also observed in the\n3Cpro structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus (30). The C147A mutant of CVB3 3Cpro crystallized in a unit cell similar to\nthat of the wild-type form I crystal and diffracted to 1.38 \u00c5 (Table 1 and Fig. S2). Both complexes of CVB3 3Cpro with EPDTC and\nTG-0204998 crystallized in the form II unit cell, with only a slight variation in the protein\nconformation (Fig. 2A).\n\nThe complex crystals of SARS-CoV 3CLpro/TG-0204998 and 3CLpro/TG-0205486\nbelong to the C2 space group with one complex model per asymmetric unit (Table 1). In these structures, the inhibitors were well\ndefined in the Fourier maps. CoV-229E 3CLpro-EPDTC complex crystallized in a\nP21 unit cell with a dimer as its asymmetric unit (Fig. 2B). As reported previously, both CoV-229E and\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro are homodimers with three domains in each monomer. The catalytic dyad\nof His-Cys is located in the active site in the cleft between domains I and II, whereas domain\nIII participates in the protease dimerization (26,\n31). In contrast, CVB3 3Cpro is a monomer,\nand it does not contain the dimerization domain III. By employing the program O (32), CVB3 3Cpro monomer can be superimposed onto\nSARS 3CLpro with a root-mean-square deviation of 2.11 \u00c5 for 121 matched\nC\u03b1 atoms or 1.06 \u00c5 for 48 C\u03b1 if more stringent criteria were used.\nHis40 and Cys147 in the catalytic triad of CVB3 3Cpro coincide\nalmost perfectly with the His-Cys dyads of the CoV proteases (Fig. 2C). Although the two types of proteases share very little\nsequence homology, structure-based sequence comparison reveals some similarity in the regions of\ndomains I and II (Fig. 2D), which\nexplains the similar substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism. However, the different\naffinities of the protein for the inhibitors encouraged further analysis of their\ninteractions.\n\n\n\nInteractions of 3Cpro and 3CLpro with the\nInhibitors\u2014The structure of EPDTC is shown in Fig. 3A, and those of the peptide inhibitors are shown in Table 1. The local structures of CVB3 3Cpro and\nCoV-229E 3CLpro in complex with EPDTC are shown in Fig. 3, B and C, and the previously determined\nstructure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with EPDTC is shown in Fig. 3D for comparison. The environments of the peptide\ninhibitors bound to the proteases are shown in Fig. 4.\nOmit maps for the bound inhibitors are shown in Fig.\n5.\n\nThe zinc sites were confirmed by anomalous difference Fourier maps (not shown). The binding\nmode of EPDTC in the CVB3 and CoV-229E proteases are similar to that observed in SARS-CoV\n3CLpro, where the Zn2+ binds to the two catalytic residues Cys and His.\nThe zinc and two sulfur atoms of EPDTC were clearly seen in every subunit, but the bulky\nsubstituent groups in both crystals were invisible. In the zinc center, the\nS\u2014Zn\u2014S bond angle is 103.1\u00b0 for CVB3 3Cpro, similar to the\n107.2\u00b0 observed in SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure; but a distorted tetrahedral\ngeometry was observed for CoV-229E 3CLpro (Fig.\n5B), with an S\u2014Zn\u2014S angle of 85.25\u00b0, despite\nthe restraints to an ideal angle of 109.5\u00b0 employed in the refinement.\n\nIn addition to Zn2+, an MPD molecule from the crystallization reservoir was found\nin one subunit of CoV-229E 3CLpro, which is located in the S1 pocket. The two oxygen\natoms of MPD form two H-bonds with the side chain of His162 and Gln141\nwith distances of 2.66 and 3.15 \u00c5, respectively. MPD binds in a similar position to that\nof DMSO (coming from the solvent to dissolve the inhibitor) in SARS-CoV 3CLpro\ncomplexed structure. No such organic molecule was observed in the complex structure of CVB3\n3Cpro with EPDTC.\n\nIn the CVB3 3Cpro/TG-0204998 structure (Fig.\n4A), the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ethyl ester occupies the\nS1\u2032 site, which is in close proximity to the catalytic center. The Michael acceptor\nforms a covalent C\u2013S bond with the Cys147. The lactam ring occupies the S1\nsite, as it is a Gln mimic and forms two H-bonds with Thr142 and His161.\nThe P2 Leu side chain occupies the S2 site, a large hydrophobic pocket. Interestingly, the P3\ngroup of TG-0204998 is actually located in the S4 site. The P4 benzoxy ester group lacks strong\nelectron densities (Fig. 5C) because it\nis exposed to the bulk solvent. In Fig.\n4B, two protein molecules in the C147A structure are superimposed,\nalong with the TG-0204998 complex and eight conserved water molecules with distances of less\nthan 0.4 \u00c5 between the equivalents. Some of these waters occupied the inhibitor binding\nsites, whereas others may help improve the drug-protein interactions (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the SARS-CoV 3CLpro/TG-0204998 structure (Fig.\n4C), Cys145 attacks the \u03b1-carbon of the\n\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone at the P1\u2032 position to form a covalent\nC\u2013S bond of 1.99 \u00c5 and induces hydrogen bonding between the ketone oxygen and\nthe N-H groups of Gly143 and Cys145 itself in the S1\u2032 pocket. In\nthe S1 site, the carbonyl oxygen and the nitrogen of the five-member lactam ring at the P1\nposition form hydrogen bonds with His163 and Glu166, respectively. The\nfollowing P2 Leu side chain binds into a hydrophobic S2 pocket. The P3 group is directed toward\nthe bulk solvent. The benzoxy group at the P4 position is bound in the S4 pocket with its phenyl\nring aligned parallel to a flat surface near Ala191. Most of the carbon atoms (4 of\n6) in the phenyl ring show hydrophobic contacts with the protein.\n\nIn the structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro/TG-0205486 (Fig. 4D), the inhibitor adopts a similar binding mode to that in the\nabove structure. In both structures, the peptide N-H groups of residues P1 to P3 form four\nhydrogen bonds with the backbone CO groups of His164 and Glu166, and the\nside chain of Gln189. In addition, the CO group of P3 interacts with the N-H groups\nof Glu166.\n\nAntiviral Compounds TG-0204998 and TG-0205221 Can Effectively Inhibit Replication of\nCVB3\u2014The critical and essential step in coxsackievirus replication is\npolyprotein cleavage by 3Cpro after viral protein translation, which is the potential\ntarget for antiviral drugs TG-0204998 and TG-0205221 (33). To observe the effect of compounds TG-0204998 and TG-0205221 on virus replication,\nRT-PCR was applied to detect the coxsackievirus genome in the infected cells. As shown in Fig. 6, a 150-bp DNA fragment could be detected in\nvirus-infected cells either in the absence or presence of 0.5 \u03bcm TG-0204998.\nHowever, no specific DNA fragment could be found when the concentration of compound TG-0204998\nor TG-0205221 was increased to 1 \u03bcm, indicating that both compounds could\neffectively block viral replication in the host cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo kinds of proteases, 3Cpro and 3CLpro, serve as drug targets for\ndeveloping inhibitors against picornaviruses and coronaviruses, respectively. Although these two\nproteases do not share sequence homology, they share similar substrate specificity in\nrecognizing Gln as the P1 residue, a hydrophobic residue at the P2 position, and a small amino\nacid residue at the P1\u2032 position. In this study, we found that CVB3 3Cpro\nactually prefers the substrate of SARS-CoV 3CLpro derived from its N-terminal\nprocessing site. However, the inhibitors could not inhibit both proteases equally (Table 2), suggesting some structural differences in the\nactive site. To understand the structural basis of the specificity, we solved the structures of\n3Cpro from CVB3 and 3CLpro from CoV-229E and SARS-CoV with the same\ninhibitors to compare their binding modes. The information obtained here is useful for designing\nspecific inhibitors against each kind of the proteases.\n\nFor the zinc-coordinating inhibitor EPDTC, similar to the previously determined binding mode\nin the structure of a complex with SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the Zn2+ cation is\ntetrahedrally coordinated by the His-Cys catalytic residues of CVB3 3Cpro (Fig. 3B). The binding is facilitated by the\nsuitable distances from the nitrogen atom of His and the S\u2013 anion of Cys to\nthe zinc center in both 3C and 3CL proteases. However, the EPDTC inhibition of CVB3\n3Cpro is 4.4-fold weaker (Fig. S1); this is probably because the side chain of\nGlu71 is hydrogen-bonded to the N\u03b41 atom of His40 to favor the\nprotonation of N\u03b52. Therefore the N\u03b52 atom must be deprotonated before EPDTC\nbinding takes place. The lack of electron density for the bulky substituent groups might suggest\nthat they are disordered. According to a computer model of the inhibitor with SARS-CoV\n3CLpro (21), the entire EPDTC could be\naccommodated in the active site with sufficient room for the bulky side groups to rotate about.\nOn the other hand, a molecule of DMSO (SARS-CoV) or MPD (CoV-229E) is bound in the S1 site of\n3CLpro. Although the DMSO molecule forms a hydrogen bond with Ser144 of\nthe former enzyme, the smaller side chain of Ala143 in the latter case provides\nhydrophobic interaction and larger space for MPD bonding (Fig.\n3, C and D). No such solvent molecule was seen in the\ncomplex structure of CVB3 3Cpro with EPDTC, because its more open S1 pocket fails to\ntrap small molecules.\n\nUnlike 3CLpro, which is dimeric and in which each subunit is composed of three\ndomains, 3Cpro is a monomer with only the two catalytic domains. Structure-based\nsequence alignment shows that 3CLpro has a large loop between \u03b2-strands C1\nand D1, whereas 3Cpro has smaller loops inserted between E1 and F1 and between B2 and\nC2 (Fig. 2D). The C1\u2013D1 loop of\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro secures the S2 hydrophobic pocket for the P2 side chain. The two\nloops E1\u2013F1 and B2\u2013C2 of CVB3 3Cpro are also adjacent to the active\nsite, and they modulate the binding of the P3 and P4 residues. The four peptidomimetic compounds\nhave a higher Ki for CVB3 3Cpro than for SARS-CoV\n3CLpro in general, not only because it has a more open active site but also because\nthe binding sites are different.\n\nFor the peptidomimetic inhibitors, both TG-0204998 and TG-0205486 bind to the active site of\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro in similar modes, whereas TG-0204998 binds differently to CVB3\n3Cpro. The P2 cyclohexyl side chain of TG0205221 fits well in the S2 site of\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro but is too bulky for CVB3 3Cpro, whereas the P2 Leu of\nTG0204998 fits well in both. The E1\u2013F1 loop of CVB3 3Cpro makes the S2 site\nshallow and open (Fig. 4B), which is\nconsistent with its 46-fold higher Ki of TG-0205221 (Table 2). On the other hand, our CVB3 3Cpro\nstructure is analogous to that of RV 3Cpro, and a P2 phenyl side chain may be\npreferred by CVB3 3Cpro as evidenced by the tight binding of AG7088 to RV\n3Cpro (4). Moreover, the\nt-butyl group of P3 is favored for tight binding to the S3 site of SARS-CoV\n3CLpro, which enhances the inhibition by more than 10-fold (20). Conversely, the P3 Val in AG7088 fits RV 3Cpro very well,\nbut the additional t-butyl group makes our compounds weaker inhibitors of CVB3\n3Cpro. With the t-butyl group, the bulky P3 residue is actually\nrelocated to the hydrophobic environment in the S4 site formed by the B2\u2013C2 loop of CVB3\n3Cpro, leaving the unbound P4 benzoxy group facing the bulk solvent (Figs. 2A and 4B). This may also contribute to the higher\nKi. Removal of the P3 t-butyl group or the entire\nP4 residue may improve the inhibitors against CVB3 3Cpro.\n\nIn these inhibitors, the P1 site favors Gln or its mimicking lactam ring, and the lactam ring\nprovides 15-fold better inhibitory activity than Gln, as revealed by the previously reported\nstructure-activity relationships (4). The strong binding\nof the lactam ring to the proteases is evidenced by the multiple hydrogen bond formations in the\ncrystal structures (Fig. 4). The addition of a\ncyclopropyl group to the P1\u2032 residue of TG-0205486 enhances the inhibition against CVB3\n3Cpro by almost 4-fold as compared with TG-0203770, but it becomes weaker against\nSARS-CoV 3CLpro (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 4D, the triangular group tends to clash\nwith the protein atoms because of the more limited space of the S1\u2032 site adjacent to\nloop C1\u2013D1. In CVB3 3Cpro, the S1\u2032 site is more open, yet still\nflanked by the hydrophobic side chain of Phe25.\n\nThe conserved water molecules in the active site, as revealed by the high-resolution crystal\nstructure of the C147A mutant of CVB3 3Cpro (Fig.\n4B), may also offer some trends for optimizing the inhibitors. If the\nwater model is superimposed on the bound TG-0204998 molecules, W3 and W4 are equivalent to two\ncarbon atoms in the P1\u2032 and P1 residues of TG-0204998. W5 and W6 are located in the S1\npocket, forming hydrogen bonds to the protein including His161. These are to be\ndisplaced by the P1 lactam ring with a similar bonding pattern. W7 is located in the S2 pocket\nwith a distance of about 1.85 \u00c5 to the side chain carbon of P2 Leu and is\nhydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Glu71 at a distance of 2.98 \u00c5. Based on\nthese observations, a new drug can have the W4-equivalent carbon atom replaced by a nitrogen or\nsulfur, but the W3-equivalent carbon cannot be changed because it is part of the\n\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde for the Michael addition. The P2 Leu may be replaced by\nan Arg or a Lys residue, which can interact with Glu71.\n\nIn summary, we have shown here that the antiviral compounds TG-0204998 and TG-0205221 inhibit\nthe viral protease, thus preventing CVB3 genome replication. Our study reveals the key\ninteractions in determining the binding specificity of the inhibitors against 3C and 3CL\nproteases. The information will be useful for further inhibitor optimization and drug\ndiscovery."}
