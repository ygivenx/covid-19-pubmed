{"title": "The role of institutional trust in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak among residents in Hubei, China", "body": "quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. 25 Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high 26 institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant 27 determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. 28 Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important 29 factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care 30 during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely 31 contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention 32 to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant 33 to seek treatment at formal health services. We searched PubMed on January 28, 2020, for articles that describe the trust, 48 preventive practices and health-seeking behaviors related to the 2019 novel coronavirus 49 (2019-nCoV) in China, using the search terms \"novel coronavirus,\" \"institutional trust,\" 50 \"behavioral change,\" \"protective behaviors,\" and \"treatment-seeking\" with no The questionnaire was developed in English and translated into Chinese.

Most 204 participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek treatment at the hospital, 205 whereas 42% (n = 1,782) reported that they would seek traditional healing, and 62.4% 550) of participants who were in the quarantine area reported no intention of seeking 215 treatment in the hospital. In the multivariable analysis, similarly, being quarantined 216 (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80-3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 217 95% CI 1.96-2.49) were two strong significant determinants of treatment-seeking in 218 the hospital.\n\nWith the aim of understanding the public behaviour in prevention measures in this crisis 221 that has now become a worldwide concern, this study collected data at the 2019n-CoV 222 outbreak epicentres during a period of exponential growth of the epidemic. This study 223 found a considerably high level of institutional trust among the public in the epicenters. 224 However, trust in the local authority was lower than that in the provincial and central (11, 12) . Healthcare providers can be strong advocates for outbreak prevention efforts 231 in these communities, considering that many expressed a high level of trust in them.\n\nOn a positive note, this study revealed that the people in the epicenters adopted a 233 high level of prevention measures. As noted, however, a relatively small proportion 234 reported using face masks at home when they were around household members. overseas countries such as Germany, Japan, and Vietnam, the community in Hubei 239 province and the epicenters should be made aware of the essential importance of 240 wearing face masks when they are around other household members.\n\nThe main strength of this study is the finding of the strong influence of institutional 242 trust on overall preventive behaviors, in good agreement with previous studies (8, 11) . 243 As the 2019-nCoV epidemic is still growing exponentially, continued strengthening of 244 institutional trust, and in particular, increasing the trust in the local authority, is essential 245 for emergency management. outbreak control.\n\nThe study also found that uptake of prevention practices was poorer among older 247 members of the public, which warrants serious attention. It has been found that older 248 adults affected by 2019-nCoV are likely to have a higher risk of complications and 249 mortality (4). There is a need to find out whether a lack of appropriate prevention 250 practices among people of older age is due to knowledge deficiency or to their being 251 out-of-reach of current public health intervention.\n\nThe finding that nearly 15% of people would be reluctant to seek treatment in the 253 hospital if they were suspected to have been infected with 2019-nCoV is clinically 254 important and worrisome. Of utmost importance, a proportion of those participants are 255 in the city of Wuhan and currently under quarantine. The preference for using 256 traditional healing among a minority of the older respondents is also of concern. Refusal 257 to seek hospital treatment not only leads to progress to serious respiratory distress and 258 can be life-threatening, but also increases the chances of spreading the disease.
