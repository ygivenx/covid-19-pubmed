{"title": "EUROPEAN COMMUNITY PREVIEW A RTI CLE CONTROL OF ACUTE VIRUS DISEASES OF CALVES IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY*", "body": "In the Federal Republic of Germany there are at present 14.5 million cattle, of which 2.8 million are calves up to 6 months of age.\n\nAnnual production from these cattle exceeds 21 billion DM and satisfies about 95% of the FRG's total beef consumption and 60% of its veal consumption. These figures emphasize the enormous economic importance of cattle breeding and production in the FRG, and the great responsibility of veterinary medicine in establishing and maintaining a healthy and productive cattle population.\n\ninteraction of many different microbial and non-microbial factors.\n\nThe latter diseases develop by the synergistic interaction of a variety of agents especially shortly after calves are crowded together for veal production and at the beginning of the cold season.\n\nThe acute viral diseases of calves which are of most importance in the Federal Republic of Germany are summarized in Table I .\n\nCalf rearing and fattening is mainly plagued by Enzootic Bronchopneumonia, Mucosal Disease, IBR-IPV and Rota-and Coronavirus infections.\n\nDuring recent years we have worked particularly on the incidence of these acute calf diseases, and developed diagnostic and control measures.\n\nDuring recent years two viruses have been demonstrated to play a role in the complex diarrhoeal diseases of newborn calves.\n\nFirst is the so-called Nebraska calf diarrhoea virus, a nonenveloped, RNA containing, reo-like virus, which is now called Rotavirus, and secondly a Coronavirus, which also contains RNA, and has an envelope with clublike projections ( Table 2) . Although the two viruses are very different in their properties they have many similarities with respect to their pathogenesis. The bovine rotaviruses and coronaviruses both have a strong affinity for epithelial cells of the small intestine, and the coronaviruses also have an affinity for the epithelium of the colon~ Infection with these viruses rapidly leads to a loss of function of the The methods used were electron microscopy, using faecal filtrates, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate antigen-containing cells in the faeces (Bachmann, 1977 (Bachmann, 1977) .\n\nThe IBR-IPV infection has been known in Germany for decades.\n\nUntil recently the infection produced mostly genital lesions (infectious pustular vulvovaginitis; infectious balanoposthitis; IPB; IBP) but during the last two years a respiratory form has been observed to increase.\n\nOther diseases due to the IBR-IPV virus, such as encephalitis and abortion, do not play a role according to our experiences.\n\nThe epizootiology of IBR-IPV in the FRG is variable. The virus is much more common in Northern than Southern Germany, and much more common in bulls on artificial insemination stations than in animals on ordinary farms.\n\nIBR-IPV viral infections can be diagnosed from clinical signs, but diagnosi~ is mainly performed by the isolation of virus and the demonstration of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nWe regard the antibody test as the most reliable method.\n\nThe control of IBR-IPV in the FRG is regulated partly by law (especially by the use of vaccines), but further measures depend on the current disease situation, for example on the incidence in an infected population (region and herd) and on the nature of the disease (respiratory or genital form; acute or persistent).\n\nControl can be difficult because IBR-IPV virus infections tend to become persistent, (when virus can be excreted intermittently for years), and also because of the common occurrence of infections without clinical signs.\n\nOnly one vaccine type is used for immune prophylaxis against (Straub, 1976; Straub and Wizigmann, 1968 ). Table III .\n\nEffective control of BVD-MD is possible only by active immunization combined when necessary wfth hygienic measures such as isolation and quarantine, and disinfection. No treatment for the disease is known, and the success of symptomatic therapy is limited (Table IV) .\n\nFor immune prophylaxis of BVD-MD in the FRG a combination vaccine made from inactivated agents is commercially available and there is also a live vaccine developed at our Institute. The live virus vaccine is produced in cell culture with an attenuated 2% were clinically ill and 85% were without symptoms.\n\nIn evaluating the pattern of disease after vaccination it is necessary to take into account s fact that already infected populations were vaccinated and that further cases or losses decreased only gradually in parallel with the development of active immunity. After vaccination 15 of the clinically ill animals died, and all the others recovered. Of 2,502 healthy animals 21 (0.8%) became ill, and the others remained healthy.\n\nThe results of these trials are summarized in Table V .\n\nThey show clearly that the vaccinations were effective and rapidly and completely stopped the disease in infected populations.\n\nEnzootic bovine bronchopneumonia, which is also often called \"cattle flu\", \"viral pneumonia\", or \"enzootic bronchitis\" has a complex etiology and may be classified as a multifactorial infectious disease. At present the disease is thought to be caused primarily by viruses, but the \"triggers\" that convert an infection into disease may be non-microbial factors. The disease is also complicated by bacterial infections (Wizigmann, 1974; Wizigmann et al. 1976 ). Among the participating viruses the \n\nin beef production farms. This form may occur at any season but is always associated with \"Crowding\".\n\nAttention must also be paid to the method of husbandry, the age of the animals, the time of vaccination, the kind of vaccines and/or drugs used and the form in which they are administered (Wizigmann et al. 1976 ).\n\nIn the season-dependent form of enzootic bronchopneumonia vaccination with an agent-specific vaccine is most important. We have had success with a combination vaccine derived from inactivated agents (bovine adenoviruses type i, 3 and 5-reoviruses type 1 and 3 and parainfluenza 3-virus) which has been developed on the basis of investigations of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of bovine enzootic bronchopneumonia (Wizigmann, 1974; Wizigmann, et al. 1976 ).\n\nWe have data from the vaccination of more than 70,OOO animals in problem herds during four vaccination campaigns. After vaccination the morbidity in these herds decreased from 72% to 6.8% and mortality decreased from 5.1% to 1%. 86-89% of the animal's owners were satisfied with the vaccination results, and veterinarians evaluated the efficacy of the vaccines as \"very good\" or \"good\"\n\nin 89-94% of the herds (Wizigmann et al. 1976 ).\n\nIn enzootic bovine bronchopneumonia associated with crowding it seems that prophylactic measures should at first be nonspecific, using so called paramunity-inducers, (Mayr, 1976; Mayr et al. 1976 ). These should be followed and supplemented by agent-specific vaccines.\n\nThe paramunity-inducers increase non-specific resistance to infection in the short term, induce interferon production and activate the lymphopoietic cell system (Mayr, 1976; Mayr et al. 1976 ). Paramunity inducers of very different natures are known (Mayr, 1976) ; the most useful in bovine practice are biological inducers or safe living vaccines (e,g. PI-3; BVD-MD). These have the advantage of combining non-specific and specific effects.\n\nIn practice the inducer and vaccine should preferably be administeredtogether.\n\nSo far we have obtained good results with a preparation (PIND-AVI) which is produced from an inactivated avipoxvirus which is heterologous for mammals, Wizigmann, unpublished observations) .\n\nWhen administering a combination vaccine derived from inactivated agents one must consider the age of the animal and the danger of vaccination provocation, for example by vaccinations during the incubation period. Animals bought at 1-3 weeks of age should be vaccinated first with a paramunity inducer which should be followed by the \"cattle flue vaccine\" 2-4 weeks later, but not before 5 weeks of age. It also has the advantage that, in contrast to other Orf virus vaccines, it can be given subcutaneously without loss of immunogenicity.\n\nBovine malignant catarrhal fever is also enzootic in the FRG.\n\nIn differential diagnosis it can be confused with mucosal disease and IBR-IPV, especially when it occurs in calves. The exotic diseases Rinderpest and blue tongue also have to be excluded. The disease is diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and pathological changes. We have not been able to isolate a virus in thyroid cell cultures.\n\nEffective control is difficult, because the disease occurs only sporadically. Both diseased and suspected cases are slaughtered immediately because of the unfavourable prognosis. Specific prophylaxis or therapy will not be possible until we know more about the properties of the virus that causes bovine malignant catarrhal fever in the FRG.\n\nIsolates from other countries have proved to be herpesviruses (Plowright, 1968) ."}
