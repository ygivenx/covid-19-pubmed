{"title": "Sickness behaviour reduces network centrality in wild vampire bats 1 2", "body": "As a pathogen spreads across a population, sickness behaviours -like lethargy, 38 increased sleep, and reduced movement -can slow pathogen spread, because less socially 39 connected individuals are often less likely to transmit a pathogen [1] [2] [3] . This sickness-induced 40 'social distancing' can be important for modelling pathogen transmission as a social network 41 changes over time (i.e. a dynamic social network [4] ). Tracking the effects of sickness behaviour 42 on a dynamic social network requires large datasets with temporal and spatial resolutions that 43 are high enough to be ecologically useful. Automated tracking of animal associations typically 44 occurs in the lab [1] or at specific field locations such as feeders or nest boxes [2] . Proximity 45 sensors by contrast can measure association times and durations, at high spatial and temporal 46 resolution, among free-ranging animals at any location [5] . Proximity tracking is therefore a 47 potentially powerful tool for understanding how individual sickness behaviour reshapes a social 48 network. 49\n\nHere, we induced sickness behaviour in wild-caught vampire bats using injections of 50 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which mimics the symptoms of a bacterial infection without an active 51 pathogen. LPS treatments allow us to isolate the effects of sickness behaviour from parasite-52 specific manipulations of host behaviour [6, 7] . After injections, we tagged both the 'sick' bats 53 (injected with LPS) and control bats (injected with only saline) with proximity sensors [8] . We 54 released them back into their wild colony and tracked changes in their association rates. Based 55 on the effects of LPS on the physiology and behaviour of captive vampire bats [6, 7], we 56 predicted reduced association rates between 'sick' bats and control bats in the wild. 57\n\nIndeed, LPS-induced sickness behaviour caused a dramatic decrease in network 58 centrality. The control bats encountered fewer 'sick' individuals and also spent less time near 59 them. For studying pathogen transmission, the links (or edges) in a social network would ideally 60 be defined based on the pathogen-specific transmission mechanism, because some pathogens 61 require longer or closer physical contact. In practice, however, most social network edges are 62 . We captured bats from a colony of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) inside a 70 hollow tree at Lamanai, Belize. Before sunset on April 24 th 2018, we blocked all exits of the 71 roost except one and we used a handnet and mist nets to capture about 100 vampire bats 72 (including 41 females) until 0500 h the next morning. We kept females in cotton cloth bags, and 73 measured their mass to ensure they did not differ between the randomly assigned treatment 74 and control injections (difference in mass = 0.17 g [95% CI: -2.9, 2.4]). We randomly assigned 75 the females to the test or control treatment by flipping a coin, then adjusted to ensure more 76 balanced samples. We injected the individuals in the test group under the dorsal skin with 70-77 100 \u00b5l of LPS (lipopolysaccharide in phosphate-buffered saline, L2630 Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, 78 MO, U.S.A.) at a dosage of 5 mg/kg, following previous studies with this species [6, 7] . Bats in 79 the control group received an injection of the same volume per body mass of phosphate-80 buffered saline. One hour after injection, we released 34 females, tagged with proximity 81 sensors, back into their roost. 82 83\n\nTo track dyadic associations among the bats, we used custom-built proximity sensors 85 (see [5, 8, 9] for details). The sensors weighed 1.8 g (including battery and housing) and were 86 glued to the dorsal fur using skin-bonding latex adhesive (Montreal Ostomy Skin-Bond). Tag 87 weights were 4.5 -6.9 % of each bat's mass, in accordance with recommendations for short-88 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We placed the antennas of a base station inside the roost for 89 encounter data download. Each encounter observation includes a duration and received signal 90 strength indicator (RSSI), which can be used as an estimate for a minimum distance between 91 two tagged bats during the encounter. We defined a 'proximity index' as the percent quantile of 92 all RSSI values. To define association, we used a proximity index of 85% (i.e. the top 15% of all 93 encounters ranked by signal strength, Fig. S1 ). We chose this value by using the same RSSI 94 value as a previous study linking wild associations to captive interactions (-27 dbm [8] ). Past 95 work [8] suggests these associations involve a proximity of about 0-50 cm. 96\n\nWe excluded data from three sensors, which apparently dropped off the bat, either 97 inside (n=2) or outside (n=1) the roost, evident from the sensor's constant contact with the base 98 station (i.e. no evidence of exiting or entering the roost). We therefore used association data 99 from 16 'sick' bats and 15 control bats. 100 101\n\nWe created social networks where edges were association time. To track associations 103 over the day, we created social networks for each hour. To measure an LPS effect size, we 104 created a network for the entire period where we expected an LPS effect based on past work 105\n\n[7]. This \"treatment period\" was 3 to 9 h post-injection (1700 -2300 h). We did not include 106 associations from the second half of the night because we observed, visually and in the sensor 107 data, that most of the bats left the roost to forage after midnight. For comparison, we also 108 created two more networks for the corresponding times of day (24 and 48 h later). 109 110\n\nTo test the effect of LPS on three measures of network centrality, we first fit a general 112\n\nlinear mixed-effects model with treatment (LPS, saline) and day (1, 2, 3) as fixed effects, bat as 113 a random effect, and the network centrality measure (degree, strength, and eigenvalue, 114 .

We then extracted the standardized model coefficients for the 115 treatment effect and the interaction between treatment effect and day. If we detected an 116 interaction, we also fit a linear model for the observations within the first and last day separately 117 and extracted those standardized treatment effect coefficients. To get two-sided p-values, we 118 created 10,000 null datasets where the treatment was re-assigned randomly among bats at the 119 start of the study, then measured the proportion of the null coefficients that were greater than 120 the observed coefficients, and then doubled those one-sided p-values. This procedure creates a 121 null model accounting for the non-independent and non-normal structure of the network data 122 [11] . To assess assortativity of sick and control bats over time, we calculated for each hour the 123 association probability (proportion of possible pairs that were associated) and the mean 124 association time (total seconds per period) for three dyad types: control-control, control-sick, 125\n\nand sick-sick. For all 95% confidence intervals, we used basic nonparametric bootstrapping with 126 5,000 iterations. 127 128\n\nDefining network edges requires deciding what minimum proximity or duration 130 constitutes an 'association'. With proximity sensor data, this definition is flexible but requires a 131 trade-off between maximizing the sample size of observations and filtering for observations that 132 are more meaningful (e.g. closer proximities or longer durations). We inspected how the size 133 and precision of the LPS effect changed with variations in how networks were constructed. To 134 do this, we resampled our data using different definitions of association, then we plotted 135 changes in the number of observations and the treatment effect size (defined as the 136 unstandardized model coefficient during the treatment period). As a measure of relative 137 detectability, we used the p-value from the parametric linear model. To investigate the effect of 138 minimum encounter duration, we defined association at one proximity index (85% as in our 139 original analysis), but filtered encounters using several values of minimum duration that varied 140 .

To investigate the effect of minimum encounter proximity, we set no minimum 141 duration (as in our original analysis), but filtered encounters using a proximity index threshold 142 that varied across several values from 76 -98 %. Proximity index thresholds below 76% are not 143 informative given the roost size; thresholds over 98% use less than 2% of the data. Finally, to 144 assess if the LPS treatment effect size was robust across different proximity thresholds, when 145 controlling for number of observations, we used several proximity index thresholds varying from 146 75% to 94% but we randomly sub-sampled the same number of observations in each case 147 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 Results 153 154\n\nCompared to the control group, 'sick' (LPS-injected) bats associated with fewer 156 groupmates (lower degree centrality), spent less time with them (lower strength centrality), and 157 were less socially connected to the entire network (lower eigenvector centrality), and these 158 effects diminished with time ( Figure 1, Table 1 ). During the hours of the treatment period, a 159 control bat had on average a 49% chance of associating with each control bat ([95% CI: 44, 54], 160 n = 105 pairs), but only a 35% chance of associating with each 'sick' bat ([31, 38] , n = 240 161 pairs). During the treatment period, the mean association rate for two control bats was 15 min 162 per h [13, 18], but for a control and 'sick' bat, it was only 10 min per h ([8, 11] , Figure 2 ). 163\n\n164\n\nWhen we increased the minimum threshold of time defining an association, we observed 166 that the estimate of the treatment effect grew larger, but eventually became smaller and less 167 clear as the number of observations decreased ( Figure 3A ). When only using associations over 168 15 min, the effect became harder to detect. Next, when we increased the minimum proximity 169 index threshold defining an association, we again observed that the treatment effect estimate 170 grew larger but less clear as the number of observations declined ( Figure 3B ). When controlling 171 for the number of observations, the treatment effect was relatively stable across different 172 proximity thresholds ( Figure S2) . 173 174 .
