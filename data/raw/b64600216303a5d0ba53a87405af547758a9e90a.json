Aggregate Signal Profiles for Two Channel Arrays! 7 Supplementary Method Details", "body": "As discussed in the main text, the ProtoArrays' signal analysis in both Stage I and Stage II of the investigation involved multi-step processing. In both steps, aggregate raw signals ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) were normalized within each array, using an implementation of the ProCAT algorithm 1 . Briefly, the algorithm was utilized with parameters implementing a sliding window of length 15, to take into account local background subtraction as well as local intensity normalization across each array. The normalized signal for each position i,j on the protein array is calculated using the sliding window signals and backgrounds as, Supplementary Fig. S1 .\n\nThe normalized signals in the custom protein arrays (Stage II of investigation), were fitted to roughly normal distributions using a power transformation, implemented per protein. Namely, each signal is scaled by fitting \u03bb so that each adjusted protein signal, pi is IPSS classification, using package ks 9 , with unconstrained smoothed cross-validation method for bandwidth selection, are also shown. 5-fold cross-validation was used in assignment of KDA classes, and median classifications and standard deviations of 1,000 random data partitions were computed.\n\nRaw data and corresponding normalized matrices were deposited in the Gene Expression\n\nOmnibus repository under the following accessions: \n\nThe high-priority proteins were analyzed with IPA's knowledge database (Ingenuity\u00ae Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com). Various functional associations were found, as shown above. The three proteins with validated Stage II reactivity are show in blue (AKT3, FCGR3A, ARL8B). \n\nThe ProtoArrays display overall higher foreground (a) than background signals (b) for both channels (532 nm and 635 nm), with similar distributions across various subgroups. Similarly for the focused arrays (c) and (d). Note that GST signal is generally higher than IgG signals (c).\n\nSupplementary and corresponding standard deviations shown in (b). Kernel Discriminant Analysis classification results were based on using the three protein reactivities validated in Stage II, AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B, as defining coordinates per sample.\n\nClassifications used 5-fold cross-validation, with medians/deviations based on 1,000 random group partitioning repetitions."}
