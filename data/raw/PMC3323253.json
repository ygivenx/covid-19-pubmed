{"title": "Correction, vol. 10, no. 9", "body": "In \u201cSARS-CoV Antibody Prevalence in All Hong Kong Patient Contacts\u201d by Gabriel M. Leung et al., errors occurred on p. 1654. The seventh sentence read \u201cthose who declined testing\u201d but should have been \u201cthose who consentedto testing.\u201d\n\nThe corrected sentence reads as follows: However, those who consented to testing were more likely to report more frequent contact and closer relationships with SARS patients, more febrile or respiratory illness episodes since February, and a travel history to SARS-affected regions, which may have biased our seroprevalence estimate upwards.\n\nThe corrected article appears online at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/9/04-0155_article.htm.\n\n We regret any confusion these errors may have caused."}
