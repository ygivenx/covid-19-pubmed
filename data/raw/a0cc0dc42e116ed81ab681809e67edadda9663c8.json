{"title": "2\u2032-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members HHS Public Access", "body": "activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2\u2032-O methylation of the 5\u2032 cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2\u2032-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from nonself RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA likely serves as a paradigm for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.\n\nMost eukaryotic mRNA contains a 5\u2032 Cap 0 (7mGpppN) structure with a methyl group at the N-7 position. In higher eukaryotes, methylation of cellular mRNA occurs additionally at the 2\u2032-O site of the penultimate (7mGpppNm, Cap 1) and antepenultimate (7mGpppNmNm, Cap 2) 5\u2032 nucleotides in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively 3,5. Many viral mRNA also contain Cap 1 and 2 structures, but cap acquisition occurs distinctly among virus families 2,6. RNA and DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm cannot use the host nuclear capping machinery, and thus, have evolved MTases to facilitate N-7 and 2\u2032-O capping or mechanisms to \"snatch\" the cap from host cell mRNA 1. It remains unclear how 2\u2032-O methylation contributes to viral infection or cellular mRNA homeostasis 2,3.\n\nFlaviviruses are a genus of positive-strand RNA viruses with a 5\u2032 Cap 1 structure that is generated by an MTase in the NS5 protein 7. Whereas mutations abrogating the N-7 MTase activity abort WNV infection, an E218A substitution that completely abolished the 2\u2032-O but not N-7 MTase activity ( Supplementary Fig 1) did not affect replication in permissive BHK cells 8. Although C57BL/6 mice infected subcutaneously with the parental WNV-WT strain had a \u223c40% mortality rate, recipients of WNV-E218A showed 0% mortality, even at high challenge doses (Fig 1a, P < 0.05, n = 10) or after direct intracranial infection (Fig 1c) . Levels of WNV-E218A after subcutaneous inoculation were markedly decreased in the spleen, serum, or brain compared to infection by WNV-WT (Fig 1b) .\n\nSince dissemination of WNV-E218A was aborted in vivo we assessed whether 2\u2032-O methylation restricted the protective IFN-induced immune response. IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with WNV-WT showed 100% mortality and a mean time to death (MTD) of 3.5 days, as seen previously 9 (Fig 1a) . Remarkably, IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with the WNV-E218A exhibited a similar phenotype with only a slightly delayed MTD of 4.5 days. IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice infected with WNV-E218A at day 3 sustained tissue titers that approached those of WNV-WT (Fig 1d) . Thus, 2\u2032-O methylation of WNV RNA is required for virulence in vivo, and its absence renders a virus sensitive to the IFN response. Viral growth analysis in primary mouse fibroblasts (MEF) and macrophages (M\u03d5), which both produce and respond to type I IFN after WNV infection 10, confirmed attenuation of WNV-E218A in wild type cells (50-fold lower and 151-fold lower at 72 h, P < 0.05, n = 3 in MEF and M\u03d5, respectively) and restored growth in IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/cells (Fig 1e and f) . Replication of WNV-E218A also was rescued in IRF-3 -/-, IRF-3 -/-\u00d7 IRF-7 -/-, or IPS-1 -/cells that have altered or abolished IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses 11 ( Supplementary Fig 2a- c and 3a-d, respectively), but not in IRF-7 -/or TLR3 -/cells, which have normal IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2 responses after WNV infection, respectively 10,12 ( Supplementary Fig 2d-e) . These experiments confirmed that rescue of WNV-E218A in primary cells requires attenuation of the IFN response.\n\nSince 2\u2032-O methylation rendered WNV-WT less susceptible to the IFN response than WNV-E218A, we hypothesized it might directly limit IFN induction by affecting the avidity of viral RNA for the host sensor, RIG-I. However, direct binding assays with recombinant RIG-I and 2\u2032-O unmethylated or methylated WNV RNA (5\u2032 untranslated region) showed no change in binding ( Supplementary Fig 4) . It remained possible that 2\u2032-O methylation of WNV RNA affected other proteins required for transcriptional activation of the IFN-\u03b2 gene. To evaluate this idea, IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/-MEF, which produce IFN-\u03b2 without responding to it, were infected at a high MOI and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was measured. Notably, both WNV-WT and WNV-E218A stimulated IFN-\u03b2 transcription equivalently after infection (Fig 2a) . Thus, a lack of 2\u2032-O methylation does not affect pathogen sensing or IFN induction. To address whether 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA serves to antagonize or evade IFN effector functions, IPS-1 -/-MEF, which do not produce type I IFN after WNV infection but can respond to it 11, were exposed to IFN-\u03b2 to induce ISG, and then infected. WNV-E218A displayed increased sensitivity to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment when compared to WNV-WT (2,400,000 and 20,000-fold inhibition with 500 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b2, respectively) (Fig 2b) .\n\nIFN induces hundreds of ISGs, some of which may have antiviral effector functions 13. Among these, IFIT family members (e.g., IFIT-1 and IFIT-2 (also known as ISG56 and ISG54, respectively)) are induced after WNV infection 14, reduced in IRF-3 -/and IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/cells (15 and Supplementary Fig 5) cells, and inhibit replication of some viruses 16-18 in part, by interacting with eIF3 and limiting translation of viral mRNA 19,20. To assess whether differential 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA might affect suppression by IFIT-1 and/or IFIT-2, we evaluated infection in 3T3 MEF expressing a murine IFIT-1 or IFIT-2 transgene. As observed in primary cells, WNV-E218A replication in control 3T3 cells was reduced (\u223c5 to 60-fold-decrease at 24-72 h, P < 0.05, n = 3) compared to WNV-WT, confirming that 2\u2032-O methylation is required for optimal infectivity (Fig 3a) . Transgenic expression of IFIT-2 reduced infection of WNV-WT (\u223c56 to 100-fold decrease at 24-72 h, P < 0.0005, n = 3) (Fig 3b) when compared to replication in 3T3-GFP cells. In comparison, expression of IFIT-2 virtually abolished replication of WNV-E218A (up to 2,700-fold decrease at 72 h, P < 0.0005, n = 3) (Fig 3b) . Expression of IFIT-1 in 3T3 cells had minimal inhibitory effects on WNV infection (Fig 3c) . To confirm the linkage between IFIT-2 expression and restriction of infection, siRNA knockdown experiments were performed. Transfection of a sequence-specific siRNA that reduced protein expression of IFIT-2 enhanced replication of WNV-E218A (P < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig 3d) . These experiments demonstrate that mouse IFIT-2 is an antiviral effector of IFN actions, whose inhibitory activity is minimized by 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA.\n\nAlthough IFIT family orthologs exist over a broad evolutionary time frame 21, humans have a distinct complement of IFIT genes (IFIT-1 (ISG56), IFIT-2 (ISG54), IFIT-3 (ISG60), and IFIT-5 (ISG58)). Transient transgenic expression of human IFIT-5 but not IFIT-1, IFIT-2, or IFIT-3 in human 293T cells inhibited infection of WNV-E218A (P = 0.003, n = 3) ( Supplementary Fig 6) , suggesting a species-specificity of IFIT genes in restricting WNV lacking 2\u2032-O methylated RNA.\n\nWe assessed the stage of the WNV lifecycle that was restricted by mouse IFIT-2. Using strand-specific qRT-PCR to quantify genomic (positive strand) and replicative intermediate Daffis (negative strand) viral RNA, we found that in control 3T3 cells each increased by 18 h post infection (Fig 3e and f) , whereas the expression of mouse IFIT-2 delayed production of both by \u223c15 h in the context of WNV-WT infection. In comparison, increases in negative and positive strand RNA were abolished in IFIT-2 transgenic cells infected with WNV-E218A. The levels of WNV-E218A positive strand RNA remained essentially constant over the time course, suggesting that the lack of 2\u2032-O methylation did not affect viral RNA stability. Thus, mouse IFIT-2 blocks infection of the E218A mutant in fibroblasts at or prior to negative strand synthesis.\n\nAs other virus families encode 2\u2032-O MTases, we sought to determine if 2\u2032-O-methylationdependent evasion of IFIT proteins functions as a more general immune escape mechanism. We obtained a vaccinia virus (VACV) mutant (J3-K175R) that lacks 2\u2032O MTase activity, replicates normally in BSC40 cells 22 but was attenuated in wild type M\u03d5 (\u223c6 to 8-fold reduction at 24-72 h) and fully rescued in IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/-M\u03d5 (Fig 4a) . Growth curves with VACV-WT and VACV-J3-K175R in 3T3 cells expressing GFP or ISG20 confirmed an essential role of 2\u2032-O methylation in poxvirus infection (\u223c3 to 5-fold reduction at 24-72 h, P < 0.005, n = 3) (Fig 4b) . Transgenic expression of IFIT-2, however, did not affect replication of VACV-WT (P > 0.5, n = 3) suggesting that IFIT-2 lacks activity against VACV-WT or that the virus efficiently antagonizes its antiviral effect. Expression of mouse IFIT-2 but not IFIT-1 further reduced infection of VACV-J3-K175R (6 to 25-fold decrease, P < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig 4c and d) . Consistent with these findings, wild type C57BL/6 mice were resistant to lethal challenge with VACV-J3-K175R (0% lethality, n = 6) but sensitive to infection with VACV-WT (100% lethality, n = 13). In contrast, in IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/mice, VACV-J3-K175R was virulent as all animals succumbed to infection with similar kinetics compared to those infected with VACV-WT ( Supplementary Fig 7) .\n\nWe examined the replication of a wild type and 2\u2032-O MTase mutant (D130A in the nsp16 protein) 23 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV-D130A was more sensitive to the effects of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment ( Supplementary Fig 8) , attenuated in control 3T3 cells (\u223c6 to 15-fold reduction at 9-24 h, P < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig 4e) , and sensitive to transgenic expression of mouse IFIT-2 (\u223c8 to 234-fold reduction, P < 0.05, n = 3) in comparison to MHV-WT (\u223c2 to 5-fold decrease at 9-24 h, P < 0.05, n = 3). Thus, analogous to flaviviruses and poxviruses, the 2\u2032-O methylation of coronavirus RNA supports evasion from the antiviral effects of IFIT-2. In contrast, transgenic expression of IFIT-2 did not affect replication of a picornavirus, which lacks a 5\u2032 cap structure (Fig 4f) .\n\nTo confirm the role of IFIT proteins in restricting viruses lacking 2\u2032-O methylation, growth curves were performed in wild type, IFIT-1 -/or IFIT-2 -/-M\u03d5. Surprisingly, the infectivity of WNV-E218A was almost completely rescued in IFIT-1 -/-M\u03d5 (2,300-fold increase in titer at 72 h, P < 0.04) but not in IFIT-2 -/-M\u03d5 (Fig 3g) , and the virulence of WNV-E218A was almost entirely restored in IFIT-1 -/mice (Fig 3h) \n\nViruses WNV-WT and WNV-E218A were propagated in BHK21 cells as described 8. VACV-WT and VACV-J3-K175R 22 (gift of R. Condit) and EMCV (strain K) were propagated in HeLa and L929 cells, respectively. Generation of MHV-WT (strain A59) and MHV-D130A recombinant coronaviruses has been described 25.\n\nC57BL/6 wild type and immunodeficient (IFN\u03b1\u03b2R -/-, IFIT-1 -/-, IRF-3 -/-, IRF-7 -/-, IRF-3 -/-\u00d7 IRF-7 -/-, and IPS-1 -/-) mice were bred at Washington University. Infection experiments were performed with approval of the Washington University and Saint Louis University Animal Studies Committees. Viral titers in blood and organs were quantified as previously described 11.\n\nBone marrow derived M\u03d5 and MEF were generated as described 11. 3T3 fibroblasts expressing GFP or ISG were previously described 18. Cells were infected with WNV, VACV, MHV, or EMCV at MOI of 0.01, 1, 1, and 0.001, respectively. Lysates or supernatants were titered by plaque assay on BHK21-15 cells for WNV and EMCV, BSC-1 cells for VACV, and L929 cells for MHV.\n\nIFN-\u03b1\u03b2R -/-MEF were infected at an MOI of 10 with WNV-WT or WNV-E218A. Total RNA was isolated, treated with DNAse (Qiagen), and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA were amplified by qRT-PCR as described previously 11.\n\nIPS-1 -/-MEF were pre-treated with increasing doses of mouse IFN-\u03b2 (PBL Laboratories) for 24 h and then infected with WNV or MHV at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants were harvested at 48 or 12 h post infection, respectively, and titered by plaque assay.\n\nQuantitation of positive and negative strand WNV RNA was performed using a T7-tagged primer strategy 26. Fibroblasts expressing GFP or mouse IFIT-2 were infected with WNV-WT or WNV-E218A at an MOI of 1 and total RNA was harvested at indicated time points.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
