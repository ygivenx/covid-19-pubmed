{"title": "Recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cholangiocyte Damage with Human Liver Organoids 2 3", "body": "Wuhan (China) has caused emergent and significant threats to global public health 1 . 48 The dominant symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are fever and 49 cough 2,3 . However, a proportion of patients showed multi-organ damage and 50 dysfunction 2-4 . Of note, liver damage is emerging as a co-existed symptom reported 51 in patients with COVID-19. A recent epidemiologic study in Shanghai (China) 52 reported that 75 out of 148 (50.7%) COVID-19 patients had liver function 53 abnormality, indicated by key liver function parameters above the normal range, 54 including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline 55 phosphatase (ALP) or total bilirubin (TBIL) 5 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.990317 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nACE2+ cholangiocytes are preserved in human liver ductal organoid cultures. 88 To establish the SARS-CoV-2 infection model with human liver ductal organoids, 89 we first determined whether the long-term organoid culture could preserve the 90 ACE2+ cholangiocytes ex vivo. We processed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 91 to interrogate the transcriptome of cholangiocytes in human liver ductal organoids.

We isolated and plaque-purified the SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19 111 patient in Shanghai. The liver ductal organoids from two individuals were inoculated 112 with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour then re-embedded in Matrigel and maintained in culture Statistical analysis. 249 We employed Student's t-test or ANOVA test to analyze the parametric 250 experimental results. Significant differences were noted with asterisks.
