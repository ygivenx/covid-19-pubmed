However, in the ab-VLPs. vTF7-infected L cells were transfected with pMIDI-HD and four different plasmids encoding the structural sence of MHV the DI RNA could not be detected. This is most likely due to the lack of a T7 terminator sequence proteins of MHV (M, N, S, and E), all under the control of the T7 promoter. The production of RNA-containing on pMIDI: the T7 transcripts that are produced are heterogeneous in length and cannot be detected by hybrid-particles was tested by mixing helper virus MHV-A59 with the medium of the transfected cells and adding this ization. Since nothing is known about possible 3 end constraints for RNA packaging we have introduced the mixture to a new monolayer of L cells. When the VLPs are infectious, they will be able to deliver the packaged cis-acting hepatitis delta ribozyme followed by the T7 terminator sequence into the cDNA clone behind the MIDI-HD RNA to the cytoplasm of the cells and the DI RNA will subsequently be replicated and packaged by poly(A)-tail in order to generate an RNA that has a 3 end that resembles the 3 end of MIDI RNA as much as the coinfecting helper virus MHV-A59. The presence of MIDI-HD in the intracellular RNA is thus used as a marker possible. Only four nonviral nucleotides are present downstream of the poly(A)-tail.

An endogposttransfection and the latter was mixed with helper virus MHV-A59 (m.o.i. of 10). A fresh monolayer of Lcells was infected with this mixture and serial undiluted passages were performed. Intracellular RNA of P0 cells and of the passages was analyzed in a hybridization assay. Figure 5 shows that MIDI-HD RNA was produced abundantly in transfected cells. After passaging of the material derived from the cells that were transfected with pMIDI-HD and the structural genes, MIDI-HD RNA could be detected in the intracellular RNA of P2, P3, and P4 cells (Fig. 5A) . However, no MIDI-HD RNA was observed when pMIDI-HD was cotransfected with pUC20 and subsequently passaged in the presence of helper virus (Fig.  5B) . This experiment showed that the virus-like particles can package the MIDI-HD RNA and that they are infec- Although we have not shown the expression of E by immunoprecipitation using an E-specific antibody, our data clearly suggest that not only M but also the expression of E is required for the production of VLPs. More importantly, coexpression of E and M appeared to be sufficient for the release of virus-like particles. Therefore, E and M must be important factors in virus budding.\n\nNot much is known yet about the small membrane protein E, except that the acylated protein is found in virions in very low amounts (Yu et al., 1994) and that it is expressed at the cell surface (Tung et al., 1992) . Other enveloped viruses, like Influenzavirus, alphaviruses, and pestiviruses, also have small membrane proteins that play an important role in the biogenesis of infectious progeny (Pinto et al., 1992; Allison et al., 1995; Loewy et al., 1995) . The E protein might have similar functions. Possibly, an interaction between E and M induces the budding process. Both proteins are modified in the intermediate compartment; the M protein acquires GalNac (Tooze et al., 1988; Krijnse Locker et al., 1992) absence of M can induce virus budding (Fig. 2B) .
