{"title": "Towards RNA Nanoparticle Vaccines: Synergizing RNA and Inorganic Nanoparticles to Achieve Immuno-potentiation", "body": "Genetic medicines hold tremendous potential and there is a large literature already devoted to the topic of DNA vaccines. However considerably less work has been done on RNAbased vaccines despite several potential advantages, such as avoiding insertion, replication and transcription steps. Today there are literally thousands of papers in the literature also involving RNA nanoparticles. However few, if any, have considered whether the immunological profile of inorganic nanoparticles could synergize with the RNA to potentiate immune response. Here we summarize progress to date on RNA vaccines and address the molecular correlates and immunological responses desirable for potential RNA vaccine nanoparticles and their continued progression.\n\nWhile DNA vaccines have long been heralded, more recently an interest in RNA vaccines has emerged. RNA vaccines are being evaluated against a variety of diseases as summarized in Table 1 .\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , diseases for which RNA vaccines have been tested include; viruses such as Avian influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Flavivirus, Hepatitis C, HIV, influenza, and some cancers (e.g.-melanoma) and measles. Delivery of the RNA vaccines has been accomplished via physical means such as electroporation or particle based methods such as gene gun and lipid nanoparticles. Routes of RNA vaccine administration include; subcutaneous, intradermal and intramuscular. Except for one case where RNAi was used, the overwhelming majority of RNA vaccines are constructed from either mRNA or selfamplifying RNA (saRNA), and these are discussed in the next section.\n\nFor RNA vaccines the delivery of a translatable RNA sequence into the cytoplasm circumvents many of the complications of DNA delivery, in that nuclear localization is not required and there are no integration, replication or transcription steps necessary. The structural elements an RNA vector must contain in order to be directly translated to protein once present in the cytosol is illustrated below in Figure 1 . Figure 1 illustrates basic structural features of RNA vaccine expression vectors. For example mRNA constructs contain a 5\u2032-G cap, a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), the coding sequence for the antigenic protein, a 3\u2032-UTR, and a 3\u2032-poly(A) tail. The vaccine antigen to be expressed is encoded in the coding region. Within the 5\u2032-UTR are sequences that promote the assembly of and stabilization of the ribosome on the mRNA. The 3\u2032-UTR is generally thought to mediate mRNA decay rate. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a replicon-based vaccine that is longer than other RNA-based vaccines with typical molecular weights of approximately 10 kb. 11 The most studied saRNA vaccines have been derived from alphavirus genomes. Alphaviruses consist of a single copy of positive, single-stranded RNA that contains genomic RNA encoding its own replication machinery and sub genomic RNA that encodes viral proteins, such as caspid and glycoproteins. 12 When creating the vaccine, the sub genomic RNA encoding the viral structural proteins is replaced with RNA that encodes the antigen(s) of interest. First, the replicase complex is translated in the cytoplasm. The replicase then synthesizes a genomic anti-sense RNA that is used as a template for the genomic positive-strand RNA synthesis as well as for the sub genomic RNA encoding the structural antigen. 13 No viral particles are produced because their genetic sequences have been replaced by those encoding the desired antigens and there is no cell-to-cell transmission. saRNA vaccines have the potential to be more potent than mRNA vaccines because of their ability to replicate and induce a stronger, broader, and more effective humoral and cellular immune response. 14 Their delivery has advanced from being packaged into virus-like particles into synthetic formulations (i.e., lipid nanoparticles 15, 16 ) , which doesn't require a cell culture step. This provides simplicity and safety benefits that using a virus would impose. receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). 17,18,19 One type of dsRNA, for which there has been a lot of recent interest, is polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, poly I:C. Poly I:C (pIC) is a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA with one strand composed entirely of cytidine and the other strand of inosine. It has long been suggested as an adjuvant to potentiate vaccine immunogenic activity, but is more recently being considered for combination chemotherapy 20 or even as a stand-alone treatment. 21 Diseases being tested for potential pIC treatment are summarized in Table 2 .\n\nAs shown in Table 2 , a variety of cancer and infectious diseases are being treated with pIC. In some cases, the pIC is used more as an adjuvant in conjunction with vaccine or in combination with cytokine (IL-2). However, in many cases the pIC or the related compound poly ICLC (polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid-polylysine-carboxymethylcellulose) is used as the active immunotherapeutic agent itself. Similar to RNA vaccines, in some cases, naked pIC is delivered locally such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or administered via intranasal, intraperitoneal or intravascular injection. Many of these have progressed beyond mouse studies into humans.\n\nOne of the key factors for immunological activity of any potential RNA nanoparticle is the activation of innate and adaptive systems. A robust molecular response needs to be triggered for the cells of the immune system to communicate with each other and perform their critical functions. Table 3 presents an overview of these signaling systems. Table 3 , the immune system has a number of specialized cells including; neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Producer cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, signal the receiver cells through expression of various cytokines. Major cytokines include, but are not limited to: Tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) such as TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2, and a variety of interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-15 and IL-18. Each elicits a different response on a variety of specific receiver cells or even on organs, such as the hypothalamus. Responses are overt and robust, and range from acute inflammation, the recruitment of a variety of cells to the site of infection, the release of killing agents, the production of chemokines, chemolocation, and chemoattractant agents, as well as the signaling of a variety of other molecules involved. Receiver cells can be T cells, B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and other cells. The response of the receiver cell can be production of various classes of antibodies, MHC class I and II, cell differentiation and growth signals. Innate immune cells provide a quick, general response that typically leads to inflammation. These express genetically encoded receptors, called Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize general danger-or microbe-associated patterns. These non-specific receptors cannot distinguish between strains of bacteria or viruses. 17, 18, 19 Despite their lack of specificity, innate immune cells are essential in that they also activate adaptive immunity. Upon recognition of a microbe, dendritic cells and macrophages consume the invader and become antigen-presenting cells that activate lymphocytes. 37 Essentially, all cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity produce cytokines, but especially by T helper (T H ) lymphocytes, which are a part of adaptive immunity. 38,39 IL-2 is considered and early responder to adaptive immunity and activation of type II interferon is also considered indicative of adaptive immunity. In addition to antibody production other signaling molecules which get up-regulated in an adaptive immune response include VCAM, ICAM, CD and MHC molecules.\n\nWhile a great deal of work has already been described for the immunology of organic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, etc, there is a growing body of literature which suggests that inorganic nanoparticles are also immunologically active as highlighted in Figure 2 . nanoparticles were compared. As can be clearly seen, all these types of nanoparticles have been reported to elicit some type of immunological response. Common molecular markers investigated include various interleukins, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, chemokines and others. For example silicon oxide (SiO 2 ), titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) and Fe 3 O 4 have been shown to activate the transcription factor NF-kB leading to increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cultured brain microglia and neuronal cells. 54 In human vascular endothelial cells or human keratinocytes IL-6 induction has been reported to be mediated via potassium channel or P2Y11 receptor. 55, 56 While our work and others suggests IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 may be indicative of nanoparticle pro-inflammatory activity, 58-62 IL-6 is recently considered as the keystone cytokine in disease. 62 Therefore the above results should be interpreted with some caution and may be cell type and route of administration dependent. These need to be balanced by modulation of CD, increases in serum IgG, IgM, chemokines, MHC-I, and MHC-II reported for MSN and other nanoparticles which could otherwise contribute a desirable immunological component to an RNA vaccine or double stranded RNA (dsRNA) as discussed next. [66] [67] [68] \n\nNanovaccines incorporating RNA may have several advantages. First the core nanoparticles themselves are capable of augmenting immunogenic activity as shown Fig. 2 . Further more recent evidence for this is seen for example when MSN and CaP nanoparticles have been tested in conjunction with vaccine and have been shown to enhance and sustain T-cell responses and in the case of CaP to protect against influenza challenge. [66] [67] [68] [69] The RNA molecule does not have to encode an antigen to potentiate an immune response either, as shown previously for example with pIC where its signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) are immuno-stimulatory. Thus another means of achieving synergy has been shown for example with pIC containing CaP nanoparticles which in addition to molecular signaling as above have the additional advantage of T cell activation and the induction of dendritic cell maturation. 66, 67 Lipid coated CaP co-loaded with pIC, STAT3 siRNA and ovalbumin (Ova) antigen have been referred to as nanovaccines and have been shown to induce an effective anti-tumor immunological response. 70 Therefore similarly, another attractive approach for achieving synergy against cancer is to co-load the nanoparticle with pIC and another anti-tumor agent such as Zoledronic acid. 71 As mentioned previously, pIC is a much needed double edged sword against cancer capable of stimulating an immunogenic and anticancer approach. Bob Langers group showed that surface functionalization is required for iron oxide to bind RNA, 72 and this is true for pIC and consistent with our results for another magnetic nanocarrier, manganese oxide. 73, 74 There is however a great deal of current interest in targeted combination chemotherapy with pIC nanoparticles, 75-77 especially as a novel approach for intratumoral immunotherapy against melanoma and potentially other cancers. [78] [79] [80] For additional synergy it would be desirable to be able to load the RNA onto for example zinc oxide or cobalt oxide nanoparticles which have been shown to possess inherent anti-cancer activity themselves. [81] [82] [83] [84] A schematic of the synergistic advantage of such an approach is illustrated in Figure 3 . Figure 3 , the delivery of pIC by zinc oxide nanoparticle would be expected to trigger an appropriate immune response as discussed above, and in addition activation of TLR3 causing translocation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus where type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8, would be expected to induced. This would essentially activate the immune system against the tumor. Further through TLR3 signaling, as well as RIG-1 and MDA-5, poly IC would be expected to trigger apoptosis, and essentially cause a molecular chemotherapeutic effect. Further, mechanisms of apoptosis caused via nanoparticles, ROS induction, etc. are not expected to be the same as poly IC, and thus the molecular signaling pathways may be complementary leading to such immunochemotherapeutic potentiation.\n\nIn summary, RNA vaccines are in development against a variety of cancers, viral infection and type I allergy. RNA vaccine vectors thus far have been either mRNA or self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) constructs. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) such as pIC is also immunogenic and in addition to anti-viral activity is being evaluated as an immunotherapy or combination immunochemotherapy against melanoma and several other solid tumors, as well as ischemia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Hepatitis B, herpes zoster in children with cancer and others. While liposome delivery of either RNA vaccines or pIC has been evaluated, the immunogenicity reported for inorganic nanoparticles has gone surprisingly underexploited. As clearly in the literature the last few years ample evidence has now been reported, particularly for calcium phosphate (CaP) and mesoporous silicate nanoparticles (MSN), but also for iron oxide, zinc oxide and cobalt oxide, of pronounced immunogenic activity. In the last year CaP and MSN have shown profound application as nanovaccines accordingly. 69, 70 RNA nanovaccines may therefore have promise and application against cancer, where in this case exploring the RNA nanobio interface of zinc or cobalt iron containing nanoparticles which could combine indigenous anti-cancer and immunogenic activity with direct RNA binding may therefore achieve the synergy long sought after. Particularly given recent reports of the antimetastatic activity of pIC [85] [86] [87] , it is imperative now to evaluate its activity in conjunction with nanomaterials. \n\nDeLong and Curtis Page 13\n\nSynergy expected between zinc oxide nanoparticle and pIC.
