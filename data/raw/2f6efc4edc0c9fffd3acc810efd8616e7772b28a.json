{"title": "Differential Antibody Recognition by Novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domains: Mechanistic Insights and Implications for the Design of Diagnostics and", "body": "The outbreak of the new betacoronavirus 2019-nCoV, formally named SARS-CoV-2, represents a world-wide epidemic threat that has been causing major disruptions in societies and economies 1-2 . For these reasons the new virus has been internationally declared a public health emergency.\n\nIn this context, structural knowledge of the proteins of the virus can provide important information to develop strategies against the infection, ranging from diagnosis to therapy. In general, coronaviruses use this protein localized on the envelope to bind their cell receptors. After binding, a series of molecular events lead to the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell, eventually leading to virus entry and invasion.\n\nOne of the necessary steps in this mechanism is the binding of the spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to the cell receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, knock out of ACE2 in HeLa cells was shown to prevent infection.\n\nFor these reasons the development of antibodies that target the spike RBD of coronaviruses and block their interaction with ACE2, disrupting a fundamental infection mechanism, represent attractive therapeutic solutions. Monoclonal antibodies with high affinities had been previously developed against the spike RBD of SARS-CoV. However, despite the correlations between the two viruses, no RBD-targeted SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies have shown the ability to bind and neutralize 2019-nCoV.\n\nThe recent publication of the Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike trimer at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution can provide a useful basis to link these observations to molecular causes, guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, and possibly suggest the basis for molecules able to block cell viral entry.\n\nHere, we carry out a comparative analysis of the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to reveal the key properties of their surfaces that can be reconnected to observed differences in antibody (Ab) and receptor binding. Starting from the atomic resolution information available from the solved structures of the two proteins, the MLCE (Matrix of Low Coupling Energies) method is applied to identify the subsets of surface residues that can be defined as \"interacting\". MLCE analysis of protein energetics accounts for the interactions that each residue establishes with all other residues of the protein it belongs to. The correlation of this parameter with the structural properties of the protein thus highlights which substructures are (pre)organized to interact with a potential partner (a cell receptor or an antibody). MLCE analyzes the interaction energies of all of the amino acids in a protein. In particular, it computes the nonbonded part of the potential (van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, solvent effects) via an MM/GBSA calculation, obtaining, for a protein composed by N residues, an N \u00d7 N symmetric interaction matrix Mij. Eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix highlights the regions of strongest and weakest couplings: the fragments that are on the surface, contiguous in space and weakly coupled to the protein core, define the potential interaction regions. In other words, the putative interacting patches are assumed to be characterized by frustrated intramolecular interactions. The actual interaction with a partner will actually occur if favorable interactions determine a lower free energy for the bound than the unbound state [3] [4] . Indeed, Minimal energetic coupling with the rest of the protein allows these substructures to undergo conformational changes, to be recognized by a binding partner (Antibodies, Receptors). All these properties are hallmarks of Antibody binding epitopes and PPI substructures.\n\nThe MLCE method for the prediction of Protein-Protein Interaction regions and Antibody binding epitopes has been validated in several previous studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .\n\nHere, we took advantage of the recent publication of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in its pre-fusion state (doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2507) and of known structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein to comparatively apply our interaction epitope prediction method MLCE.\n\nThe application of MLCE to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD, aa 319-591) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pdb code 6vsb; doi: 10.2210/pdb6vsb/pdb) 15 and of the SARS-CoV spike protein (pdb code 5x58; doi: 10.2210/pdb5X58/pdb) ( Figure 1 ) shows that the two protein regions that contain potential interaction regions/Ab-binding epitopes share the same topological localization at the two opposite ends of the 3D structures ( Figure 1 ). However, this trait appears to be the only common one. The linear sequences that correspond to the predicted interacting epitope regions are reported in Table 1 .\n\nImportantly, the predicted epitopes for SARS-CoV spike RBD show a good degree of overlap with the epitopes mapped for neutralizing Ab 80R 16 , S230 17 and m396 18 , providing a relevant validation of our approach. However, in spite of the high degree of structural similarity between the two spike proteins, these mAbs failed to bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD, probably due to the low degree of sequence conservation in the regions contacted by these antibodies. The fact that most of the SARS-CoVdirected mAbs are not reactive against the novel betacoronavirus once more highlights the need to discover specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2.\n\nActually, except for the common topological localization, the predicted Ab-binding epitopes differ between the two proteins, both in their sequence and 3D structural organization (Table 1 , 2 and Figure 1 ). In some cases, linear sequences spanning distant segments of the primary structure come together in the three-dimensional structure to form extended substructures potentially (pre)organized for binding. This is particularly true for the conformational epitope at the N-and Cterminal region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD: the interacting region spans a large part of a well-defined betasheet subdomain (Table 1 , 2 and Figure 2 ). It is tempting to suggest that the expression of such subdomain in isolation could give rise to a highly immunoreactive molecule [19] [20] [21] .\n\nIn SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the knowledge of substructures representing potential conformational epitopes may be helpful in guiding the development of peptide-based immunogens able to elicit antibodies that specifically target the cognate protein to which the predicted epitopes belong (Figure 2 ). Simply speaking, the termini of the linear segments making up the conformational epitopes could be aptly bridged with a number of Gly residues sufficient to approximate the distance in the experimental structure (Table 3 ). Antibodies raised against these molecules, which recapitulate the main determinants of immunoreactivity of the full protein, could have useful applications in a therapeutic setting [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, information on potentially specific SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-specific epitopes The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990267 doi: bioRxiv preprint function both as antigen-mimicking baits to target virus-specific antibodies in patients' fluids, and as immunogens to generate new Abs able to detect relevant antigens [22] [23] .\n\nImportantly, after we ran our predictions on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, crystal structures of this domain in complex with the cellular receptor protein ACE2 was reported by 24 and by Yan et al. 25 . Of note, one predicted interaction region almost completely overlaps with the substructure of spike protein RDB engaged in binding with ACE2 (478 TPCNGVEGF 486). Synthetic mimicry of this sequence could aptly generate high priority candidates aimed at disrupting PPIs between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and its cell receptor ACE2. Such molecules could be used to block viral entry into cells.\n\nSimilarly, our approach also predicts a patch on SARS-CoV spike RBD, which is partly involved in binding ACE2 (see 26 ).\n\nOverall, while the two RBD proteins likely evolved from a common ancestor and share a common fold, they are characterized by different sequences. The physico-chemical properties determined by such sequence differences, efficaciously unveiled by MLCE, reverberate in the modulation of the networks of intraprotein interactions that underlie the (pre)organization of regions for potential recognition of binding partners (cell receptors or antibodies).\n\nThese results represent, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first molecular physical-chemistry based rationalization of the reasons why some of the tested SARS-CoV RBD monoclonal Abs do not have appreciable cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD 15 , despite the fact that the two domains were recently reported to display the same affinity for the ACE2, with KD values of 15.2 nM and 15 nM for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively 27 .\n\nIn this complex scenario, our predictions can help disentangle some of the issues related to betacoronavirues infectivity and immunological response.
