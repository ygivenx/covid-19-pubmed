{"title": "Pandemic Influenza Planning in Nursing Homes: Are We Prepared?", "body": "against which no one has developed any immunity and for which no disease-specific vaccine initially exists. Only influenza A can cause pandemics. Influenza can be transmitted directly by large-droplet spread (e.g., when infected people cough or sneeze and their droplets come in contact with an uninfected person) or indirectly by contact spread (when uninfected people touch hands, surfaces, or objects contaminated with influenza virus) or airborne transmission (small-droplet nuclei 1-5 \u03bcm that remain suspended in air for long periods with a potential for infecting a large number of susceptible people).\n\nInfluenza A virus, occurring naturally in wild birds, causes the avian influenza (H5N1), more commonly known as \"bird flu\". The current strain of H5N1 has several characteristics required for a pandemic; it can infect humans, the entire population is immunologically na\u00efve (susceptible) to this virus, and it is deadly. The only missing characteristic is the lack of a sustained human-to-human transmission, although transient human-to-human transmission has been reported. 3 Direct sustained contact with infected birds is a requisite for avian influenza infection, although for efficient human-to-human transmission to occur, only a single genetic mutation is required. 2 Wild birds, which carry the virus asymptomatically, have been spreading H5N1 to domestic birds (ducks and chickens) throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. Domestic birds are highly susceptible to this virus, and mortality rates in these flocks can reach 100% [3] [4] [5] .\n\nDescriptions of widespread and serious epidemics of respiratory diseases suggestive of influenza can be traced back for 300 years. [6] [7] [8] Based on historical reports, there have been 10 probable and three suspected influenza pandemics since 1590. There were four pandemics in the twentieth century, at 9-to 39-year intervals. Spanish influenza (H1N1) in 1918/19 was the most devastating pandemic, resulting in 25 million to 50 million deaths worldwide. 9 Other less-catastrophic pandemics occurred in 1957 (Asian influenza, H2N2), 1968 (Hong Kong influenza, H3N2), and 1977 (Russian influenza, H1N1). 10, 11 These influenza pandemics caused millions of deaths and social disruption and had enormous economic consequences worldwide. Although experts agree that another pandemic is likely to occur, it is unclear when or how severe it will be. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict what age groups will be most affected. [12] [13] [14] Improved nutrition and health care, greater international travel, other simultaneous health threats, and level of preparedness will all influence the eventual morbidity and mortality from such a pandemic.\n\nAre we, as a society, prepared to effectively handle another influenza pandemic? The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plan, released in November 2005, is clear about the threat of a pandemic. According to HHS, when a pandemic strain emerges, 25% to 35% (approximately 75-105 million) of the U.S. population would develop the disease, and a significant number (from 209,000 to 1,903,000) could die. 15 Current response to pandemic influenza relies on a decentralized approach, with individual states and countries mounting their own responses. Their responses must take into account the likely absence of an effective vaccine, an expected shortage and rationing of antiviral medications, a healthcare system that has not been designed to accommodate even a modest pandemic, and most worrisome, erratic planning in some regions.\n\nCurrent influenza pandemic response plans do not include nursing home residents in their priority group for vaccine distribution. [15] [16] [17] Whether nursing home administrators are aware of the need to ration if faced with a pandemic and ensuing scarcity of vaccine, or have made contingency plans to sequester their patients in the event of an outbreak, is unknown. In fact, the extent of influenza pandemic preparedness in nursing homes is unknown, and research in this area is notably absent.\n\nAn influenza pandemic differs from seasonal influenza epidemics in ways that directly influence the healthcare system's emergency preparedness (Table 1) . 18 During a pandemic, there will be more sick patients to take care of and fewer healthcare and essential service workers to provide that care.\n\nAn influenza pandemic will likely occur simultaneously across every community in the nation and place a huge burden on the U.S. healthcare system. Published estimates based on extrapolations from the 1957 and 1968 pandemics suggest that there could be 865,000 hospitalizations, 45 million outpatient visits, 45 million additional illnesses, and 209,000 deaths. Estimates based on the 1918 pandemic are grimmer: 9.9 million hospital admissions and 1.9 million deaths globally in a short time span. 19 In addition to morbidity and mortality, pandemics can have enormous social and economic consequences.\n\nPrepandemic planning by healthcare facilities is therefore critical to provide quality, uninterrupted care to the ill and to prevent further spread of the influenza virus. According to the HHS pandemic preparedness plan, the participation of the entire healthcare industry, including federal, state, and local health departments, community stakeholders, acute care hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient clinics, is crucial to pandemic readiness. 6 It would be reasonable to assume that a pandemic could disrupt all factions of society, requiring every level of the healthcare system to be self-sufficient. Developing a response plan to deal effectively with all phases of a pandemic ensures that measures are put into place before an emergency occurs. This will help contain the disease and reduce its transmission, decreasing the number of cases, reducing hospitalizations and mortality, maintaining essential services, minimizing the economic and social effects, and helping keep healthcare costs contained.\n\nA pandemic response plan for healthcare facilities, including nursing homes, can be used as a road map for future emergencies, such as infection outbreaks, seasonal influenza vaccine shortages, and other natural disasters. Formal and informal professional ties established as a result of such planning can help healthcare facilities handle various natural and man-made disasters. Critical elements and considerations of a pandemic influenza response plan (put forward by the HHS) for healthcare facilities, including nursing homes, are described below.\n\nTo aid the pandemic response planning process and to make it consistent, the World Health Organization has defined distinct phases of a pandemic ( Table 2) , all of which require specific planning. 20 Currently, in the United States, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Website, we are in Phase 3 of the Pandemic Alert Period. 21 HHS has made several assumptions related to the epidemiology of influenza and its effect on the overall delivery of health care. [6] [7] [8] 18, 19 Recommendations for a pandemic influenza response plan are based on these assumptions.\n\nAssumptions Related to the Epidemiology of Pandemic Influenza-The pandemic will affect all phases of the healthcare industry and the community because of the universal susceptibility to the influenza subtype. The typical incubation period for pandemic influenza virus will be approximately 2 days; on average, two secondary infections will occur as a result of disease transmission. The attack rate in the United States may approach 40% (approximately 90 million people). Those at greatest risk will include infants, older people, and those with chronic conditions.\n\nCare-Of those who become ill, 50% will seek outpatient medical care (45 million people in the United States). The number of hospitalizations will depend on the virulence of the virus. Hospitals and other local public health units will operate at a diminished capacity. The number of healthcare workers (HCWs) will be reduced by one-third or more because of concerns about infection transmission at a facility, personal illness, and family and caregiving responsibilities. Usual sources of essential supplies (medical and nonmedical) may be disrupted or unavailable. To meet community needs, resources, including staff, supplies, and equipment, may need to be reassigned or shifted to accommodate an overflow of patients from local hospitals; nursing home residents may need to be moved.\n\nPlanning During a Pandemic-It will take at least 4 to 5 months (after the pandemic strain is identified) for an effective vaccine to be available; when it does becomes available, it may reduce the effect of outbreak, although it is expected that vaccines will initially be in short supply and high demand. This may lead to rationing and chaotic, inequitable distribution. The United States will not have enough antiviral medications, and the CDC will have to prioritize the distribution of these drugs. Priority groups may change based on the epidemiology of the viral strain.\n\nIt is assumed that preparedness plans developed by healthcare facilities, including nursing homes, will be coordinated with plans of other organizations in their communities and local or regional pandemic plans and be consistent with the respective state plan, although currently it appears that nursing homes are not actively involved in planning at a regional level.\n\nNursing home residents will not be in a high-priority group for receiving influenza vaccine. 7 The only specific drug treatment option for influenza during a pandemic will be antiviral medications, which must be started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. These antivirals will also be in short supply, and distribution may be chaotic.\n\nNursing homes may become sites for acute management of pandemic influenza patients if the hospitals are overwhelmed. Nursing homes will face the pressure to accept pandemic influenza patients for postacute care requiring immediate implementation of infection control practices, such as creating an isolation ward, to cohort residents and staff. Traditional infection control prevention and control practices will need to be in place, such as hand hygiene, appropriate personal protective equipment, and ability to cohort sick individuals. In addition, social activities such as dining and other recreational events and rehabilitation will have to be curtailed. Care protocols will need to be updated frequently. Plans to emergently transfer residents with their medical records to their homes (if well), another nursing home, or hospital (if sick) will need to be in place. Although not unique to nursing homes, they will need to be prepared to restrict visits by concerned family and friends, and staff will need to communicate with residents' families and friends, as well as the media.\n\nSpecial considerations for HCWs must be taken into account in the planning stages. HCWs are at a similar risk of acquiring influenza as the general population. They have a duty to provide care to their patients; at the same time, society has an obligation to support HCWs, who will bear the greatest risk in fulfilling their care responsibilities. One of several ethical dilemmas that nursing homes face is determining whether vaccine should be distributed to save the \"most number of lives\" or the \"most years of life.\" 20 Should policy makers give priority to individuals who are more likely to die if infected (e.g., an 89-year-old nursing home resident) or to individuals who are less likely to die if infected but stand to lose more if they did (e.g., a 41-year-old HCW with two children)? The HHS pandemic preparedness plan currently advocates saving \"most years of life\" by prioritizing immunization to HCWs. 6 Nursing homes, like other healthcare employers, are expected to maintain healthy work environments. Whether they have appropriate guidance to streamline their immunization programs during healthcare emergencies, be it seasonal influenza vaccine shortage or pandemic influenza response planning, needs to be examined further.\n\nThis section provides an overview of specific planning activities during various stages of a pandemic.\n\nDuring interpandemic and pandemic alert periods, all healthcare facilities are responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Developing response plans and decision-making structures, including chain of command\n\n\u2022 Developing written plans that address disease surveillance, facility access, occupational health, distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, supply chain, access to critical inventory needs, and mortuary issues\n\n\u2022 Participating in response exercises and drills, and incorporating lessons learned into response plans. [6] [7] [8] 18, 19, 22 During a pandemic alert period, if an influenza pandemic begins in another country, healthcare facilities are responsible for heightened institutional surveillance for influenza and preparing to activate institutional pandemic influenza plans, as necessary.\n\nDuring a pandemic alert period, if an influenza epidemic begins or enters the United States, healthcare facilities are responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Activation of institutional pandemic plans\n\n\u2022 Implementation of infection control practices to prevent influenza transmission \u2022 Establishment of rapid and frequent communication within healthcare facilities and between healthcare facilities and healthcare departments\n\n\u2022 Implementation of surge capacity plans to sustain healthcare delivery. [6] [7] [8] 18, 19, 22 To adequately respond during various alert periods, the HHS recommends that a healthcare facility's pandemic response plan include an internal multidisciplinary planning committee. 15 The committee should include technical experts, leadership personnel with decision-making authority, and representatives from a wide range of response partners. A response coordinator should directly command the facility's response. Various elements of pandemic response plan pertaining to nursing homes are briefly described in Table 3 . 15 An in-depth review and guidance for the entire plan is available at www.hhs.gov/pandemicflu/plan.\n\nSeveral opinion papers and review articles have been published recently on the political, social, economic, and health implications of a pandemic. 5 38 No studies evaluating pandemic preparedness plans within the United States exist, but there has been one in-depth qualitative study that evaluates 12 U.S. communities and their overall emergency response systems. 44 That study noted that, with flexible federal funding, communities have strengthened their ability to respond to public health emergencies.\n\nAs pandemic preparedness becomes reality, policy makers are identifying various key challenges. For example, in one meeting report, the following issues were brought to the forefront. 30 There is a lack of clear definition of hospital \"preparedness.\" The HHS has formulated and disseminated a comprehensive checklist of pandemic preparedness tasks, but there is a lack of guidance in terms of priorities or metrics of implementation of the specific elements of the plan. Current regional-level planning does not bring nursing homes to the table. In a severe pandemic, traditional hospital care (as well as care provided in the community and nursing homes) will need to be altered significantly, and elective services would have to deferred and acute services rationed. Although many experts recognize the need to ration care in these circumstances, no nationally recognized scientific, ethical, or legal framework exists for accomplishing this.\n\nApproximately 1.5 million people in the United States reside in more than 16,000 nursing homes. 45 A significant proportion of these people have cognitive and functional impairments. Unlike other healthcare institutions, these facilities care for a highly vulnerable population at high risk of adverse outcomes from any emergency or disaster (e.g., hurricane Katrina). The objective of pandemic response planning in nursing homes is to enable them to recognize and manage a pandemic. Advanced planning may eventually help to reduce transmission of the pandemic virus, decrease the number of affected residents, reduce hospitalizations and deaths, maintain essential services, and reduce the socioeconomic effect of the pandemic. It is unrealistic for any facility to operate with the belief that it can adequately prepare and implement a comprehensive pandemic response plan in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe overarching questions are: What are the challenges that nursing homes face in planning for pandemic influenza? Are nursing homes capable of obtaining rapid testing for influenza when a majority of nursing homes contract with laboratories that are off-site? Will nursing homes be able to adjust case-definitions for pandemic influenza rapidly to screen their residents? Do they have protocols in place to screen their new admissions? Are nursing homes prepared to prevent or minimize their resident morbidity and mortality, to limit internal social disruption, and reduce the economic consequences caused by an influenza pandemic? Are these facilities able to establish effective collaborations with other community and state stakeholders? Thus far, there has been no published report or research focusing on the extent of, challenges to, barriers to, and opportunities for pandemic preparedness in nursing homes 46, 47 .\n\nA few articles have evaluated the effect of seasonal influenza vaccine scarcity during the 2004/05 influenza season and the adverse effect of ensuing vaccine rationing on immunization programs 47 . Nursing homes initially sought help from a variety of likely sources, such as local health departments, hospitals, and physician practices, and then moved on to unlikely sources, such as local prisons, schools and transportation authorities.\n\nA quarter of the facilities reported that they obtained vaccine from two or more sources.\n\nThese results indicate the turmoil and uncertainty during the 2004/05 influenza vaccine shortage leading to an adverse effect on the facilities' immunization program.\n\nTo explain the decision-making process during an emergency, a qualitative study examined how medical and public health decision-makers navigated through the 2004/05 influenza vaccine shortage. 46 Although decision-makers initially relied on the scientific literature, professional judgment of experts, and patient information to make informed decisions, in a crisis, resources still needed to be allocated by relying on professional judgment. During their interviews, the investigators realized that clinical knowledge and perspectives, although crucial for making informed decisions, were not sufficient alone because of the social values at stake when protecting human lives.\n\nProcedural rigor and transparency may reduce inequities in vaccine and antiviral medicine distribution during a shortage. An organizational framework of shared decision-making and collaboration with various stakeholders would assist in decision-making. Gaps in knowledge, pressure from the public sector, and logistic delays during the shortage suggest that the burden of responsibility and decision-making would fall at the local level (i.e., on local health agencies, hospitals, and nursing homes). As such, local acute care hospitals, nursing homes, and public health institutions would benefit from creating collaborations during prepandemic periods that would clarify the administrative structure and decisionmaking for coordinated, equitable vaccine and antiviral medication acquisition and distribution. Facilities without these connections and collaborations would be left on their own to handle the shortage.\n\nBoth of these studies evaluating the adverse outcomes of the 2004/05 influenza vaccine scarcity highlighted the practical and ethical challenges of rationing life-saving resources. The ensuing chaos led to reduced vaccinations in the CDC-defined high-priority groups, including nursing home residents and their HCWs. Although vaccine and antiviral medication allocation during a seasonal influenza season and a pandemic will differ, nursing homes are susceptible to disarray and suboptimal healthcare delivery, eventually leading to poor health outcomes.\n\nA pilot survey was conducted to evaluate the status of pandemic preparedness in five local nursing homes. Only one government-owned facility had a well-developed pandemic preparedness plan. Three nonprofit facilities had just started their planning process, and one for-profit facility had not begun planning (Table 4 ). All four facilities with some pandemic planning had a complete or in-progress infection control plan to manage residents with pandemic influenza. This finding reflected the involvement of a pre-established infectioncontrol committee in the planning process. Alternatively, only one facility had established contact with a state health department, and none had established any communication with other emergency preparedness point people, reflecting a lack of collaborative relationships between nursing homes and other stakeholders such as local hospitals and community planners.\n\nThe pilot data of five local nursing homes suggest that, although they are aware of the need to initiate a pandemic response, their planning is only in the early stages.\n\nFurther research in a diverse group of nationally representative nursing homes is required to examine the level of pandemic preparedness in these facilities and their involvement in overall pandemic influenza planning as an integral part of the community. This research should then be applied to public policy in prioritizing resources and suggesting sequential guidelines to increase level of preparedness in nursing homes.\n\nIn conclusion, pandemic influenza outbreaks have the potential to cause millions of deaths, lead to social disruption, and create enormous economic consequences worldwide. Although experts agree that another pandemic is likely to occur, it is unclear when or what its epidemiology will be, in terms of the likely target age groups, or what the virulence will be. Nevertheless, pandemic preparedness is critical to reduce the adverse effect of this potentially devastating outbreak. Nursing homes, serving the frailest, most-vulnerable populations, will have to make vital decisions and provide care to older adults who will not be on the initial priority list for vaccine. At the same time, nursing homes will face an anticipated shortage of antiviral medications and be expected to provide surge capacity for overwhelmed hospitals. Further research is crucial to assess pandemic preparedness in nursing homes.\n\nDialogue between healthcare personnel providing care to seniors (including nursing homes, short-term rehabilitation facilities, and assisted living facilities) and local, state, and national pandemic preparedness planners is critical to providing the best possible care to older adults during a pandemic. Collaborative planning between acute care hospitals and nursing homes is urgently needed to adequately prepare for a pandemic. A pandemic response plan for nursing homes can then be used as a road map for future emergencies, such as infection outbreaks, seasonal influenza vaccine shortages, and other natural disasters.
