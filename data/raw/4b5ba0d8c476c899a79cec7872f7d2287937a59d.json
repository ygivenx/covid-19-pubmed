The size of the LUVs was determined by DLS and the The leakage assay is a technique that permits the detection of changes in membrane 192 permeability. It is based on the self-quenching ability of the fluorophore CF when it is highly 193 concentrated. The CF was encapsulated within LUVs at enough concentration to be self-194 quenched and the LUVs were exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs. The ITO   211   slides were then assembled into an electroformation chamber each in contact with a copper   212   tape and separated by a Teflon gasket. The chamber was filled with a 300 mM sucrose   213 solution (300 mOsm kg -1 ) and connected to a function generator to apply an AC electric field.\n\nThe electroformation was carried out at 5 V peak to peak and 10 Hz for two hours and then \n\nFRAP experiments were performed on the top pole of GUVs before and after 20 \u00b1 5 minutes 249 of exposure to AgNPs. A circular ROI of 5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m diameter was exposed to 5 bleaching 250 scans at 100% laser power and the recovery was monitored by recording time series of 100 251 frames with the confocal pinhole adjusted to 3 \u00b5m. The recovery curves were fitted with 252 Origin Pro using the classic fluorescence recovery model 35, 36 : The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

However, a small proportion of GUVs in HEPES saline experience a great change in membrane tension after exposure to 100 \u00b5M AgNPs which is also associated to a small decrease in bending rigidity (dashed box). These GUVs show a membrane tension higher than 5x10 -7 Nm -1 and a bending rigidity between 10 and 15 \u03ba b / k B T.\n\nThe behaviour of nanomaterials in biological systems is governed by their The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We propose that single AgNPs do not possess enough energy to bend the membrane, 513 nonetheless the formation of NP clusters of a particular size and shape will increase their 514 ability to deform the membrane and produce invaginations and ILVs. The formation of these 515 structures removes excess membrane, which, along with the pressure generated by the 516 AgNPs that adhere onto the membrane, increases the membrane tension and can lead to 517 membrane poration 46 . The increase in membrane tension is also known to be the driving 518 force of opening of pores which will in turn produce membrane permeation, causing the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

However, the aggregation of AgNPs would lead to two different possibilities: i) 564 large aggregates precipitate and are expelled from the solution and do not interact with the 565 membrane. These large aggregates are expected to be highly toxic because they are more 566 difficult to be transported in the blood and can be accumulated in certain organs before 567 reaching their specific targets and produce severe damage 20 \n\n.
