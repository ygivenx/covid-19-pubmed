E. Decreased numbers of leukocytes are denoted by the addition of the suffi x \"penia\" or \"cytopenia.\" 1. Neutropenia is defi ned as absolute neutrophil counts of <2900/mL in dogs and <2500/mL in cats. 2. Lymphopenia is defi ned as absolute lymphocyte counts <400/mL in dogs and <1500/mL in cats.\n\nand are of no clinical importance. 4. Eosinopenia and basopenia are diffi cult to defi ne, because the lower limit of normal in dogs and cats typically extend to 0/mL. a. Eosinopenia may occur with acute infl ammation or infection. b. Eosinopenia also may follow endogenous corticosteroid release secondary to stress, trauma, or hyperadrenocorticism, and may be associated with exogenous corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration. IV. Assessment of WBC morphology is extremely important.\n\nA. Altered WBC morphology and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions are important indicators of physiological abnormalities or disease (Tables 65-1 and 65-2). B. Abnormal morphology does not always indicate abnormal or compromised cell function; normal morphology does not guarantee normal cell function. C. Characteristic and cyclical patterns of changes in WBC numbers over time are unique to certain disorders (e.g., canine cyclic hematopoiesis).\n\nI. Neutrophils in peripheral blood randomly disperse into two interchangeable populations-the circulating and the marginated pools. II. The circulating pool includes neutrophils located within the vasculature that are sampled with routine blood collection and quantifi ed in the CBC. III. The marginated pool is composed of neutrophils that are loosely attached to capillary and venule endothelial surfaces\n\nI. The complete blood count (CBC) evaluates white blood cells (WBCs [leukocytes]), red blood cells (RBCs [erythrocytes]), and platelets. II. The leukogram is composed of total, relative, and absolute differential leukocyte counts and morphology evaluation. A. Absolute differential leukocyte counts (total WBC \u03bc WBC type relative percent) are the preferred evaluation method and result in fewer interpretation errors. B. Canine and feline leukocytes are present in the following numeric order of prevalence in healthy animals: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. III. Published total leukocyte counts in health are 6000 to 17,000/mL in dogs and 5500 to 19,500/mL in cats (Mahaffey, 2003) . A. These numbers are provided as guidelines; use the reference ranges provided by each laboratory to interpret the leukogram. B. Interpretation of the leukogram is based on the absolute leukocyte count (reported as numbers/mL) rather than the relative percentages. C. The absolute numbers of the various WBCs are altered by physiological, pathologic, or pharmacological processes. D. Increased numbers of leukocytes are denoted by the addition of the suffi x \"ilia\" or \"osis.\" 1. Neutrophilia is defi ned as absolute neutrophil counts >12,000/mL in dogs and >12,500/mL in cats; it is the most common contributor to leukocytosis. 2. Monocytosis is defi ned as absolute monocyte counts >1400/mL in dogs and >850/mL in cats. 3. Lymphocytosis is defi ned as absolute lymphocyte counts >2900/mL in dogs and >7000/mL in cats. 4. Eosinophilia is defi ned as absolute eosinophil counts >1300/mL in dogs and >750/mL in cats; it generally occurs with hypersensitivity reactions or parasitic infections. 5. Basophilia is defi ned as absolute basophil counts >140/mL in dogs and >200/mL in cats. 6. Basophilia is rare, is often accompanied by eosinophilia, and is associated with parasitic diseases (par- and, therefore, are not sampled during blood collection procedures.\n\nI. Neutrophil production and maturation occurs in the bone marrow, with precursors progressing through stages, such as myeloblast, progranulocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, band neutrophil, and mature segmented neutrophil. II. Neutrophil precursors are divided into two pools based on their mitotic capabilities.\n\nA. The proliferation-mitotic pool is composed of myeloblasts, progranulocytes, and myelocytes. B. The storage-maturation pool (no cell division) is composed of metamyelocytes, band, and segmented neutrophils. III. The marrow transit time (myeloblast to released segmented neutrophils) is 3.5 to 6 days.\n\nSee Box 65-1.\n\nI. Neutropenia is characterized by a neutrophil count below the lower limit of the reference range (<2900/mL in dogs and <2500/mL in cats) (Mahaffey, 2003) . II. It is common in dogs and cats and is often accompanied by leukopenia. III. Neutropenia accompanied by anemia and thrombocytopenia indicates pancytopenia and is suggestive of bone marrow injury or effacement.\n\nI. General mechanisms of neutropenia consist of decreased bone marrow production and tissue utilization exceeding marrow production and release (Box 65-2). II. Neutropenia can be secondary to increased margination, sequestration, hemophagocytic syndrome, and immunemediated damage to circulating neutrophils or granulocytic precursors in the bone marrow. III. Neutropenia can be a negative prognostic indicator associated with increased mortality; the more severe the neutropenia, the greater the risk of infection (Aroch et al., 2005) . IV. Neutropenia resulting from tissue utilization in excess of marrow production can occur with severe, localized bacterial infections involving body cavities, the uterus, the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, or during generalized septicemia. V. Neutropenia can be associated with neutrophil toxicity. VI. Marrow suppression resulting in decreased leukocyte production may arise with the following: A. Total body ionizing radiation B. Myelosuppression with chemotherapeutic agents (see Chapter 72) 1. Examples include cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, dimethyl myleran, doxorubicin, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, cisplatin, carboplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and combination therapy with vincristine and Lasparaginase. 2. The marrow neutrophil proliferation-mitotic pool is most sensitive to chemotherapeutics. a. Differentiated cells in the maturation-storage pool are unaffected, so release of mature neutrophils continues for 5 to 10 days. b. A neutropenic nadir often occurs during these 5 to 10 days as a result of decreased marrow production and the short (6-hour) lifespan of the circulating neutrophil. 3. Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia occurs in 1 to 2 weeks (circulating lifespan of platelets is 10 days). 4. Anemia is uncommon. C. Estrogen toxicosis in dogs 1. Sources of estrogen exposure include the following: a. Diethylstilbestrol or estradiol cyclopentylpropionate therapy used for mismating, urinary incontinence, or infertility in females may be a cause. b. With exogenous estrogen therapy for perianal gland tumors in males, pancytopenia can occur with the neutropenia. c. Excessive endogenous estrogen with interstitial and Sertoli cell tumors (males) and granulosa cell tumors (females) can also be associated with pancytopenia. 2. Sequential hematological abnormalities in canine estrogen toxicosis consist of the following: a. Immediate leukocytosis followed by rapid leukopenia b. Thrombocytosis followed by rapid thrombocytopenia c. Slow development of anemia and pancytopenia within 1 month D. Prolonged (14 to A. Hematology fi ndings consist of cytopenias involving two or more of the hematologic cell lines and circulating fragments of erythrocytes. B. Bone marrow aspirate reveals increased numbers of macrophages containing phagocytized hematopoietic precursors, and predominantly erythroid precursors, with fewer neutrophils and platelets. X. Uncommon causes of neutropenia include the following:\n\nA. Immune-mediated neutropenia can be idiopathic, drug-related, or associated with other immunemediated diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). 1. Presumptive diagnosis can be made with clinical response to immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids and with termination of therapy in cases of drug-related neutropenia. 2. Defi nitive diagnosis requires demonstration of antineutrophil antibodies, which is diffi cult owing to fragility of the neutrophils and potential release of intracellular enzymes. B. Canine cyclic hematopoiesis, a genetic disorder specifi c for gray-coated collies, is characterized by continuous, abnormal 2-to 4-day cycles of neutropenia. \n\nI. Consider discontinuing or delaying chemotherapy in animals with neutrophil counts of <1000/mL, and starting prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics, because they are predisposed to sepsis (Kociba, 2000) . II. Lithium carbonate (11 mg/kg PO BID for 6 weeks) may reverse marrow hypoplasia and pancytopenia secondary to estrogen toxicosis in dogs (Hall, 1992) . III. Lithium carbonate at 21 to 26 mg/kg/day PO may partially alleviate neutropenia of canine cyclic hematopoiesis, but can have toxic effects at this latter dose (Campbell, 1985) . IV. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, 2.5 to 10 mg/kg/day SC for 3 to 5 days) can be used for short-term management of neutropenia in dogs and cats, but neutralizing antibodies develop in cats and dogs within 14 and 21 days, respectively; therefore, long-term use is not recommended (Ogilvie, 2000; Phillips et al., 2005) . V. Parenteral administration of 1 mg cobalamin once monthly has resulted in temporary remission; no improvement occurs with oral therapy (Fyfe, 2000) .\n\nVI. Bone marrow transplantation and lentivirus-mediated G-CSF therapy have been used experimentally to treat or lessen the severity of canine cyclic hematopoiesis (Lothrop et al., 1988; Yanay et al., 2003) .\n\nI. Prognosis for recovery from neutropenia is dependent on the cause and reversibility of bone marrow damage. II. Neutrophil counts usually rebound when chemotherapeutic agents are discontinued. III. Recovery following estrogen toxicosis is possible but variable.\n\nA. Recovery may occur within 3 months. B. Pancytopenia may be permanent in some cases. IV. Neutropenia associated with idiosyncratic drug reactions may resolve within 1 to 2 weeks after therapy is discontinued. V. Neutropenia induced by infectious diseases carries a fair (FeLV) to good (ehrlichiosis) prognosis. VI. Neutropenia associated with bone marrow necrosis and myelophthisic disease has a guarded prognosis, but recovery is possible with successful treatment of certain underlying causes, such as lymphoma.\n\nSee Box 65-3.\n\nSee Box 65-4.\n\nSee Box 65-5.\n\nSee Box 65-6.\n\nMast cells are rarely seen in peripheral blood smears, but can occur with certain conditions. \n\nI. When mast cells are seen in peripheral blood smears, the underlying disease should be identifi ed and treated. II. See Chapter 70 for further discussion of treatment of mastocytosis.\n\nI. Neutrophil supply released from the bone marrow exceeds the migration of neutrophils into sites of infl ammation. II. The end result is an increase in circulating mature and immature neutrophils. 1. The WBC count is normal to decreased with excessive numbers of immature relative to mature neutrophils. 2. It is often seen with septicemia or endotoxemia. 3. Prognosis is poor, because tissue demand is greater than neutrophil production in the bone marrow. II. Neutrophilic responses vary with infl ammation.\n\nA. Peracute infl ammation 1. Transient neutropenia develops within 1 to 3 hours. 2. It is often in response to endotoxemia or severe infections, particularly those involving the peritoneum, lungs, or thorax. B. Acute infl ammation 1. Bone marrow responds within 4 to 6 hours to increased tissue demands, causing an accelerated release of neutrophils (mature and immature). 2. The resulting infl ammatory leukogram is characterized by leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and a regenerative left shift (generally >450 immature neutrophilic precursors/mL in dogs or >500 to 1000/mL in cats) (Schultze, 2000; Cowell and Decker, 2000) . C. Chronic, prolonged (days to weeks) infl ammation 1. Characterized by leukocytosis with mature neutrophilia 2. Results from expanded marrow production that exceeds tissue demand\n\nI. It is characterized by leukocytosis with mature neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia. II. Concurrent monocytosis is common in the dog and infrequent in the cat. III. It accompanies increased endogenous corticosteroid concentrations (severe stress or hyperadrenocorticism) or exogenous glucocorticoid or ACTH administration.\n\nA. WBC counts from 15,000 to 25,000/mL (Schultze, 2000) B. Neutrophilia in the absence of a left shift C. Lymphocyte count <1000/mL (Latimer and Prasse, 2003) II. Stress leukogram can also occur concurrently with an infl ammatory leukogram (see Infl ammatory Leukocytosis).\n\nI. Pronounced leukocytosis from dramatic neutrophilia (up to 100,000/mL in dogs or 75,000/mL in cats), with a signifi cant but orderly left shift (Kociba, 2000 \n\nI. Differentiate from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). II. Both conditions have neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift, nonregenerative anemia, and increased myeloid: erythroid ratio, with orderly granulocytic maturation in the bone marrow. III. Suspect CML with a disorderly left shift, neutrophil dysplasia, thrombocytopenia, decreased marrow megakaryocytes, and granulopoietic precursors in extramedullary sites (liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). IV. Neutrophil toxicity, indicative of infl ammatory conditions, drug toxicity, or systemic disease, is not typically a feature of CML.\n\nI. Transient leukocytosis from epinephrine release with excitement, fear, or exercise that is characterized by mature neutrophilia and lymphocytosis II. Common in puppies and kittens III. Uncommon in adult dogs IV. Rapid neutrophilia A. Neutrophil count up to 39,000/mL in cats (Latimer and Prasse, 2003) that generally diminishes within 20 minutes B. Neutrophilia often accompanied by lymphocytosis (absolute lymphocyte counts usually <20, 000/mL) in young cats (Cowell and Decker, 2000) Causes and Pathophysiology I. Neutrophilia A. It results from cellular shifts from the marginated to circulating pool. B. It is of greater magnitude in cats (larger marginated pool). II. Lymphocytosis: decreased migration into lymphoid tissue or increased mobilization from the thoracic duct III. Monocyte and eosinophil numbers: unchanged or slightly increased\n\nSee Table 65 -3.\n\nI. Autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by multiple organ failure (Table 65 -4) II. Intracellular accumulation of incompletely degraded substrates from defi ciency of the lysosomal enzyme required for their metabolism Diagnosis I. Examination of peripheral blood smears may reveal vacuolation or abnormal granules within leukocytes. II. Radiography helps characterize bony malformations in animals with clinically evident skeletal abnormalities. III. Identifi cation of defi cient lysosomal enzyme activity in plasma, leukocytes, or cultured skin fi broblasts can be attempted. IV. The structures of lysosomal enzymes are highly conserved; therefore, techniques developed for detection of enzymatic defi ciencies in humans can be used in dogs and cats. V. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genomic screening can be used to identify some cases.\n\nA. Examples include dogs with fucosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I, and MPS VII, and cats with MPS VI. B. Novel genetic mutations can occur with these diseases that may not be detected by the established testing procedures; therefore, a negative result does not eliminate a storage disease (Skelly and Franklin, 2002) . VI. Excessive urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion in animals with MPS can be detected by a urine spot test.\n\nI. Storage diseases are generally untreatable and progressive. II. Bone marrow transplantation has resulted in clinical improvement in dogs with MPS I and cats with MPS VI.\n\nSee Chapter 66.\n\nI. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by progressive lymphoblastic infi ltration of lymphoid organs and bone marrow. II. Unlike lymphoma, the bone marrow is the primary tumor site.\n\nI. Affected animals present with nonspecifi c signs of anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, lameness, altered mentation, and intermittent fever. II. Physical examination fi ndings consist of pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and petechia.\n\nI. Lymphocytosis with circulating lymphoblasts II. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, variable WBC counts, or pancytopenia III. Possible absence (aleukemia) or only small numbers (subleukemia) of circulating lymphoblasts IV. Possible bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy fi ndings A. Homogeneous population of large immature lymphocytes B. Replacement of normal nucleated cell population with 40% to 50% lymphoblasts V. Possible clinical chemistry abnormalities A. Increased alanine and aspartate transferases (ALT, AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities indicative of potential liver involvement B. Increased blood urea nitrogen concentration indicative of azotemia (prerenal or renal) or GI hemorrhage C. Hypercalcemia uncommon\n\nI. ALL is diffi cult to differentiate from multicentric lymphoma with bone marrow or blood involvement (stage V disease). II. Unlike advanced lymphoma, ALL often occurs without lymphadenopathy, is poorly responsive to chemotherapy, and has a more rapid and progressive disease course. III. Differentiation from acute myeloproliferative diseases (see Chapter 66) requires cytochemical and immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow preparations. IV. Lymphocytosis with mature, well-differentiated lymphocytes distinguishes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) from ALL (see below). \n\nI. Treat ALL using established protocol treatments for canine or feline lymphoma (Fan, 2003; Couto, 2001) A. Use of vincristine and L-asparaginase therapy together may result in neutropenia. B. Prognosis is poor, as treatment-induced remission is short and survival is generally less than a few months. II. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in animals with fever or neutropenia (<1000/mL). III. For animals with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, consider fresh whole blood, packed RBCs, platelet-rich plasma, or platelet concentrate transfusions (see Chapter 71).\n\nI. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by lymphocytic leukocytosis, with a predominance of small lymphocytes.\n\nII. There is no reported association between CLL and FeLV infection in cats. III. Most cases of CLL in dogs are of T-cell origin. IV. CLL is rare in cats. LGL leukemia in cats is uncommon, may accompany lymphoma, and involves the alimentary tract or mesenteric lymph nodes. B. In dogs, LGL leukemia presents as either ALL or CLL. III. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia IV. Multicentric lymphoma Treatment and Monitoring I. Treatment for CLL is not often required, especially in the absence of bone marrow involvement and hematological abnormalities (anemia or other cytopenias), or evidence for multiorgan involvement (lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, enzyme abnormalities). II. Chemotherapy is not recommended until the development of clinical signs, cytopenias, or marked lymphocytosis (generally defi ned as 60,000 to 100,000/mL). III. A combination protocol of oral chlorambucil and prednisone is effective dogs and cats (Workman and Vernau, 2003) . A. Treatment in dogs involves the following: 1. Chlorambucil: 0.2 mg/kg or 6 mg/m 2 PO SID for 7 to 14 days, then 0.1 mg/kg or 3 mg/m 2 PO SID, then long-term maintenance at 2.0 mg/m 2 QOD 2. Prednisone: 30 mg/m 2 PO SID for 7 days, followed by 20 mg/m 2 for 7 days and 10 mg/m 2 QOD B. Treatment in cats involves the following:\n\n1. Chlorambucil: 0.2 mg/kg or 2 mg/cat QOD 2. Prednisone: 1 mg/kg SID C. Dosages are modifi ed based on clinical response. D. Monitor CBCs weekly for the fi rst month and monthly thereafter. E. Prognosis is variable and depends on the extent of disease and response to therapy.\n\nI. Lymphoproliferative disease in dogs (uncommon) and cats (rare) II. Characterized by cutaneous lymphoma and a circulating population of large neoplastic T lymphocytes with intensely cleaved or indented nuclei and prominent nucleoli\n\nI. Ulcerative dermatitis, pruritus, anorexia, alopecia, and peripheral lymphadenopathy II. Hematologic abnormalities A. Lymphocytic leukocytosis with abnormal lymphocyte morphology B. Possible monocytosis, neutrophilia, and nonregenerative, normocytic, normochromic anemia\n\nDermal-epidermal infi ltration by neoplastic lymphocytes in skin biopsy samples combined with the presence of circulating neoplastic lymphocytes.\n\nI. Chemotherapeutic protocols for canine lymphoma can be tried. II. Prognosis is poor. "}
