{"title": "Degenerate primers based RT-PCR for rapid detection and differentiation of airborne chicken Newcastle disease virus in chicken houses", "body": "Airborne and droplet transmission are the major routes for transmission of animal viral diseases, such as Newcastle disease (ND), Avian Influenza, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) and Foot-and-Mouth disease. Newcastle disease (ND) is included in the World Organization (OIE) for Animal Health list of notifiable diseases (former list A). Historically, ND has been a devastating disease of poultry, and the disease remains one of the major problems affecting existing or developing poultry industries in many countries (Alexander, 1995 (Alexander, , 2003 . Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the causative agent of ND, is a non-segmented, single-stranded, negative sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Avulavirus within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family (Mayo, 2002) . Its genome is approximately 15 kb in length and encodes six proteins, namely, nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) and large protein (L) or polymerase in the order 3 -leader-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-trailer-5 (de Leeuw and Peeters, 1999; Pedersen et al., 2004) . 'Traditional' routes of NDV transmission like direct animal contact, contaminated feed, water, implements, transport contact or transmission by people were identified (Alexander, 1988 (Alexander, , 2003 . Airborne transmission was also one important route for transmission of Newcastle disease. Alexander (1988 Alexander ( , 1995 Alexander ( , 2003 recognized that the majority of ND infections were attributable to the inhalation of small viral aerosols or viral droplets by susceptible chickens. Airborne transmission was considered a significant factor in the 1970 -1971 ND outbreaks in England (Hugh-Jones et al., 1973 ) and the 1973 ND epidemic in Northern Ireland (McFerran, 1989 . Airborne NDV can also infect humans and cause clinical symptoms such as mild conjunctivitis (Chang, 1981) . Therefore, airborne NDV continues to be a major threat to chickens and people.\n\nConventionally, NDV was characterized by isolation of the virus followed by in vivo tests such as intracerebral pathogenicity index, intravenous pathogenicity index and mean death time in SPF chicken embryo/birds for pathotyping. These tests are cumbersome, labor intensive, inhumane and some times inconclusive (Tiwari et al., 2004) . In order to meet the need of production and eradication of Newcastle disease as soon as possible, more rapid methods that enable detection and differentiation of pathotypes of the airborne virus are required. RT-PCR alone using degenerate primers designed from the 'F' gene for detection and differentiation of airborne NDV avirulent strains from virulent strains is described in the present report. This technique could decrease the time required to identify NDV infected flocks while distinguishing between virulent and avirulent viruses. It will help to control effectively Newcastle disease in future.\n\nThe NDV vaccine strain La Sota (GenBank accession no. AF077761) and Chinese standard virulent NDV F 48 E 9 strain (Gen-Bank accession no. AY508514) were used as positive and negative controls of RT-PCR based degenerate primers. The control viruses were purchased from China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control. Other known viruses, such as SGM01 (GenBank accession no. DQ227248), WHZ03 (GenBank accession no. DQ363530), B1 (Gen-Bank accession no. AF309418) were kindly provided by Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering, Shandong Agricultural University, China. Standard serum was purchased from China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, which was used to identify NDV by the hemagglutination inhibition test.\n\nSpecific pathogen free (SPF) chickens and 9-to 10-day old SPF embryonating chicken eggs were purchased from the Poultry Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Chickens were housed in positive and negative-pressure isolators and were supplied with water through automatic feeder and enough feed to sustain the chickens throughout the experiment. Chickens were utilized for the Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and Intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) experiment, embryonated eggs were used for viral propagation, isolation and the mean death time (MDT) test.\n\nFive chicken houses were studied in this experiment. A description of these chicken houses is given in Table 1 . In addition, egg production fell at 170-180 days of ages, which was due to the infection with Newcastle disease virus in house C two years ago. There was no remarkable reduction in egg production history in the other four houses. The five flocks had no clinical ND or increased mortality at the time of air sampling.\n\nAir samples were collected by liquid impingement with AGI-30 samplers (Ace Glass Co., Vineland, NJ) operated in the centre and four corners of each chicken house. The AGI-30 samplers, each containing 20 ml of collection buffer (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2), were operated indoors at the manufacturer's suggested flow rate of 12.5 l/min for 20 min (Alvarez et al., 1995; Lin et al., 1997) . Sampling height was set at 1 m from the ground. To avoid an extensive formation of foam that could interfere with the physical sampling process, antifoam A (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis) was added to the collection media prior to sterilization (Chinivasagam and Blackall, 2005) . Four impingers were used at the same one sampling point per sampling time, facing the same direction. They were mixed as one sample. Three sampling times were conducted continuously at the same one sampling point in each chicken house.\n\nOn arrival at the laboratory, the inlet of each sampler was rinsed with 1-5 ml of sterile phosphate buffer to collect cells trapped in the curved inlet tube. Wash buffer was added to the collection buffer, resulting in a total volume of 23-24 ml and then the air samples were stored at 4 \u2022 C overnight. All microbiological cultures were conducted within 24 h of arrival at the laboratory (Chinivasagam and Blackall, 2005) . Most chickens seemed undisturbed and were breathing quietly during sample collection.\n\nOropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected at random from 15 chickens in houses A and B and 10 chickens in houses C-E. Swabs were placed in one tube and the supernatant fluids were removed after processed and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until tested by RT-PCR.\n\nAir collection fluids were first spun at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 45 min to remove the pelleted bacteria and dust, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 2 h to collect the viral pellet.\n\nViral RNA was isolated from the air collection pellet and swabs supernatant fluids using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The viral RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)treated water and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until further use. Controls and other known viruses were handled identically to the air samples taken from chicken houses.\n\nDegenerate primers for the RT-PCR amplification for the main function region of the fusion protein gene of NDV in the air samples swabs and were designed on the basis of published primers (Kant et al., 1997; Tiwari et al., 2004) . Three primers [P 1 -5 -TTGATGGCAGGCCTCTTGC-3 nucleotide position 141-159; P 2 -5 -AGCGT(C/T)TCTGTCTCCT-3 nucleotide position 395-380; P 3 -5 -G(A/G)CG(A/T)CCCTGT(C/T)TCCC-3 nucleotide position 395-380] were synthesized in Sangon Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Both the amplicons of P 1 + P 2 (virulent) and P 1 + P 3 (avirulent) were \n\nThe allantoic cavity of 9-to 11-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs was inoculated with 0.2 ml of the aerosol collecting medium, incubated at 37.0 \u2022 C for 4-6 days. Eggs were monitored, and dead or dying embryos were removed as they arose. Embryos dying within 24 h of inoculation were discarded. Allantoic fluids were collected from the remaining eggs upon death or at the end of the incubation period, chilled to 4 \u2022 C, and examined with haemagglutination (HA) test and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test according to the OIE standard (OIE, 2004) . Fluids that gave a negative reaction were passaged into at least one further batch of eggs.\n\nIn order to exclude interference from other pathogens, viruses were purified by using the virus plaque technique. If morphology was maintained after three successive steps of purification, then plaques were picked again and a sample was injected into 10-day-old embryonated eggs. Fluids were harvested, clarified by low-speed centrifugation and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C.\n\nPathotyping of the isolates involved virus inoculation of 10day-old embryonated, SPF eggs to determine the mean death time (MDT) in eggs of the embryos, and further testing entailed to determine the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values in 1day-old SPF chicks and the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test in 6-week-old SPF chickens. All the tests were performed using standard procedure according to the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, Chapntiters 2.1.12 and 2.1.15 (OIE, 2004) .\n\nAs expected, using the mixed primers of P 1 + P 2 the RT-PCR generated a fragment of 255 bp only with RNA isolated from NDV F 48 E 9 strain, SGM01 strain and WHZ03 strain which were already known as velogenic (Figs. 1 and 2) . Using the mixed primers of P 1 + P 3 the RT-PCR also resulted in a 255 bp fragment only with RNA of vaccine strain La sota and B1 which were known as lentogenic strains (Figs. 1 and 2) .\n\nAvirulent ND viruses were detected in four out of five houses (houses A, B, C and E), virulent ND viruses were detected in two out of five houses (houses B and C) and no virus was detected in house D (Table 2) .\n\nOnly avirulent viruses were detected in two air samples and four swab samples in house A. Avirulent viruses were detected in seven air samples and five swab samples and virulent viruses were detected only in five air samples in house B. Avirulent viruses were detected in six air samples and five swab samples and virulent viruses were detected only in two air samples in house C. Avirulent viruses were detected in seven air samples and one swab samples in house E (Table 2) . \n\nSeven NDV strains were obtained. Three were virulent strains and four were avirulent strains (Table 3) . One strain avirulent (NDV01) was isolated in house A; one virulent strain (NDV02) and one avirulent strain (NDV03) were isolated in house B; two virulent strains (NDV04, NDV05) and one avirulent strain (NDV06) were isolated in house C; one avirulent strain (NDV07) was isolated in house E (Tables 2 and 3 ). The overt clinical signs observed in chickens following intravenous inoculation were tremors and paralysis, typical of a neurotropic virus infection. Those with severe paralysis were euthanized and recorded as dead.\n\nIn the present study, RT-PCR was applied on NDV in air samples using degenerate primers designed from F gene encoding for cleavage site. Using both primer combinations P 1 + P 2 and P 1 + P 3 , a specific product of 255 bp could be amplified from the air samples, swab samples, control NDV strains and other known viruses ( Figs. 1 and 2) . A total of 75 air samples and 60 swab samples were collected from the five chicken houses. Both virulent and avirulent viruses were detected by RT-PCR and were also isolated from air samples in the vaccinated chicken flocks (Tables 1 and 2) . However, only avirulent viruses were detected by RT-PCR in the swab samples (Table 2 ). It indicated that only a small proportion of bird samples could not represent all the chickens and bird samples were collected from all the chickens was impractical at the same time. Environmental sampling has several advantages for flock surveillance, including minimizing direct human contact with flocks, eliminating individual bird handling, and providing a time-and cost-efficient sampling technique (Hietala et al., 2005) . Air sampling of poultry environments to detect NDV, is not a new concept. Delay et al. (1948) documented originally the recovery of Newcastle disease virus from poultry environment air samples in 1948, and Hietala et al. (2005) collected successfully air of poultry environments to detect airborne NDV by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The evaluation of environmental air sampling to detect an aerosolized virus indicated that the technique has potential application as an effective sampling tool.\n\nSince the 1980s, strict vaccination programs have been practised in both large-scale poultry operations and small poultry farms. The prevalence of ND has been both mild and sporadic. However, NDV still induces a high mortality rate in some regions in the world, which is caused mainly by virulent NDV. In the current study, virulent NDV were detected in seven air samples of two chicken houses, though there was no prevailing of ND. Virulent NDV may have been present in the chicken house and the surrounding environment constantly. Airborne NDV was a major threat to chickens. Once some of the failed immunized chickens were challenged by virulent NDV, the spread of ND will probably occur (Toyoda et al., 1989; Seal et al., 1995) . It is important to develop rapid and accurate methods to monitor and differentiate NDV aerosols in chicken houses. The specificity, sensitivity, and reduced processing time of PCR are suit-able for applications for aerobiological monitoring for the detection of small numbers of targeted microorganisms (Saiki et al., 1988; Alvarez et al., 1995) . Agranovski et al. (2004) had proven that the PCR method could be utilized in detection the Vaccinia virus and considered that even in case of some decay, collected fluid could be tested by RT-PCR to detect qualitatively the existence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus in the ambient air.\n\nBoth avirulent and virulent viruses could be detected in the same air samples in the present study (Table 2) . Therefore, differentiation of virulent and avirulent strains in the air is an important aspect of diagnosis of virus aerosol. Kant et al. (1997) have developed an RT-PCR which detected and differentiated two pathotypes, virulent (velogenic) and non-virulent (lentogenic), of NDV strains directly in tissue homogenate. Tiwari et al. (2004) also demonstrated that degenerate primers based RT-PCR was a simple and rapid for the detection and differentiation of virulent and avirulent NDV, which is important for the control of the disease in the event of the outbreaks.\n\nAirborne viruses in the air samples were also isolated and differentiated by in vivo tests (Table 3 ). Viruses could be isolated from all RT-PCR positive samples and seven viruses were obtained by purified assay (Table 3) . As demonstrated in the present study, the use of an available air sampler, paired with virus detection using degenerate primers RT-PCR, allows environmental air sampling to be a more accessible, time-efficient, and a practical surveillance tool than described previously, which was also demonstrated by Hietala et al. (2005) . The current study opens new possibilities of moving to a next development stage related to the replacement of the standard RT-PCR with the available multichannel real time RT-PCR capable of providing quantitative results within even shorter time periods for a number of microorganisms simultaneously."}
