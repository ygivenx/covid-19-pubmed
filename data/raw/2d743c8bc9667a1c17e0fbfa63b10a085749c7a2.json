{"title": "", "body": "estimates of vaccine effectiveness in post-licensure settings. Further discussion of this topic by experts is warranted.\n\nA key feature common to all of these approval provisions is that the established standards for the demonstration of safety and effectiveness are maintained. From our perspective, if needed, any of these pathways to licensure could provide an alternative science-based approach to the demonstration of vaccine effectiveness against Ebola virus disease.\n\nThe rapid evolution of the Ebola outbreak will need continued regulatory flexibility and adjustment to approaches used for product development and approval. By fostering a high level of communication both together and with our stakeholders, the FDA, EMA, and Health Canada will continue to employ their science-based regulatory approaches to expedite Ebola vaccine licensure and thus facilitate the availability of one or more effective Ebola vaccines.
