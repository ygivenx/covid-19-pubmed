{"title": "Diagnostic and Prognostic Plasma Biomarkers for Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation", "body": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a noninfectious pulmonary complication with diffuse lung injury after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [1, 2] . IPS develops in 4% to 12% of HCT recipients [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , and according to our recent study, the mortality rate by day 100 after IPS is as high as 70% [8] . Current diagnostic criteria for IPS are widespread alveolar injury with symptoms and signs of pneumonia and no active lower respiratory tract infection [1, 2] . In fact, our previous study showed that approximately one-half of the patients with previously diagnosed IPS had viral pathogens detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, suggesting that distinguishing viral pneumonia from IPS is difficult if we use only clinical criteria [8] . Although the evaluation of a BAL sample is necessary to diagnose IPS, the significance of detecting a viral pathogen in the pathogenicity of pneumonia, especially with a low viral load, is not necessarily clear, and bronchoscopic evaluation is occasionally infeasible due to the patient's condition. Therefore, noninvasive blood tests that could aid in IPS diagnosis (an assay that accurately identifies patients at the onset of clinical disease) and prognosis (an assay that categorizes patients by degree of risk for disease occurrence) are required [9] .\n\nMortality after IPS remains high, and the current standard treatment for IPS is high-dose corticosteroids. Although TNF-\u03b1 receptor inhibitor is a promising drug, it has not yet been established for the treatment of IPS [10] [11] [12] . Considering the high mortality rate, identification of IPS cases in the early phase of IPS for potential preemptive intervention might be critical.\n\nPlasma biomarkers may be useful tools for supporting disease diagnosis, performing risk stratification before the onset of clinical signs, or predicting outcomes because of the simplicity of sampling. No biomarkers for IPS have been identified so far. Based on previous reports, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and IL-6 are candidate biomarkers for IPS, with elevated levels in BAL samples from patients with IPS [10, 13] . Stimulation 2 (ST2) also may be a candidate, considering that it is elevated in acute lung injury [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and is an important biomarker of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Three other proteins-lymphocyte vessel endothelial receptor (LYVE), endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-have been identified as potential candidates based on a separate proteomics analysis (unpublished data).\n\nThe aim of the present study was to examine the usefulness of adding candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and/ or prognosis of IPS, as well as to compare their profiles with those of viral pneumonia.\n\nAmong patients who underwent HCT between 1988 and 2014 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch), we identified 41 patients with IPS occurring within 100 days post-HCT based on radiographic findings and exclusion of occult virus or fungus infections by multiplex PCR assay and Aspergillus galactomannan assay using frozen BAL and serum samples, as reported recently [8] . We routinely performed conventional cultures, shell viral culture, and direct fluorescent antibody testing to detect pathogens using BAL samples. Patients with viral pneumonia due to parainfluenza virus (PIV) or human rhinovirus (HRV) documented in BAL samples obtained within 100 days post-HCT without copathogens were selected as a comparative cohort [26, 27] . Transplant recipients who did not require bronchoscopic examination and who did not grow any bacterial or fungal blood cultures within 100 days post-HCT were considered unaffected controls. Patients' demographic data and transplantation information were retrieved from the Fred Hutch database. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Indiana University and Fred Hutch.\n\nCryopreserved plasma samples from day 7 post-HCT and within 1 week before or no more than 1 day after the onset of each event were analyzed. The \"onset sample\" for unaffected controls was the sample closest to day 24, which was the median day +1 of onset for patients with IPS. We selected 6 candidate proteins based on the literature and unpublished preliminary data: ST2, TNFR1, IL-6, LYVE, EPCR, and HVEM. ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and a sequential ELISA workflow was used as described previously [28] .\n\nLogistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between each analyte in HCT recipients with IPS versus unaffected controls or versus those with viral pneumonia. Analyte concentrations were log2-transformed. Univariable models were fit using each analyte, and an adjusted model for each analyte was constructed in a stepwise fashion, adding demographic and clinical variables to the model for each analyte and retaining variables in the model if their inclusion modified the association of the analyte with outcome by >10%. Multianalyte models were developed to determine whether combinations of proteins improved the discrimination between patients with IPS and control cohorts. Analytes were added to the model in a stepwise fashion, selecting the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was evaluated for each analyte to assess its ability to discriminate between patients with IPS and controls or those with viral pneumonia. Predictive values were calculated using the sensitivity and specificity for the cutoff point that is closest to the top left corner of each ROC plane and assuming a range of prevalence values (0-15%) for IPS. Weighted versions of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated for high-versus low-cytokine subgroups with a log-rank test to evaluate P values. Because the proportion of subjects with IPS was far higher in our combined cohorts than would be expected in a typical HCT population, individuals were weighted so that subjects with IPS represented a more plausible 8% prevalence of IPS for the survival analysis. Among patients with IPS, Cox regression was used to assess associations between each analyte's onset value with day 200 postinfection survival. Given the limited number of subjects, models were adjusted by the clinical or demographic feature whose inclusion effected the greatest change (at least 10%) on the analyte's association with outcome. A 2-sided P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.2 [29] .\n\nWe evaluated 41 patients with IPS with cryopreserved plasma samples. The comparative cohorts included 162 unaffected patients without bronchoscopic examination and any documented infections and 37 patients with PIV or HRV infection occurring within 100 days post-HCT. Characteristics of each cohort are presented in Table 1 . The median onset after HCT was 23 for IPS and 35 days for viral pneumonia cases. HCT recipients in unaffected controls included more recent HCT recipients, and peripheral blood stem cell as a cell source and reduced-intensity conditioning were used more often in patients with IPS or viral pneumonia than in unaffected controls. The clinical presentation was generally similar in the patients with IPS and those with viral pneumonia. Among the 41 patients with IPS, 10 (24%) received corticosteroids at the onset of IPS, whereas only 1 patient (2%) received a corticosteroid at the time of day 7 sample collection.\n\nThe concentrations of 6 candidate proteins selected based on the literature and unpublished preliminary data (EPCR, HVEM, IL-6, LYVE1, ST2, and TNFR1) were measured at IPS onset and day 7 post-HCT, and are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 for each group. The concentrations of IL-6, ST2, and TNFR1 at onset showed trends toward increasing median values across groups from the unaffected control to the viral pneumonia to the IPS cohorts. The concentrations at day 7 post-HCT, which is generally before the onset of IPS (2 cases measured within 1 day following diagnosis), showed similar trends for IL-6 and ST2.\n\nUnivariable logistic regression models were used to predict IPS versus unaffected controls and versus patients with viral pneumonia based on biomarkers sampled at the time of onset ( Table 2 ). The patients with IPS had significantly elevated HVEM, IL-6, LYVE1, ST2, and TNFR1 compared with unaffected controls, and all of these analytes except ST2 were elevated compared with patients with viral pneumonia. IL-6, ST2, and TNFR1 were significantly increased at day 7 post-HCT in patients who will eventually develop IPS compared with unaffected controls, and only TNFR1 was significantly elevated in IPS at day 7 compared with patients with viral pneumonia. To evaluate whether the biomarkers could improve the prognostic ability for IPS occurrence over clinical criteria only, combinations of multiple analytes were analyzed. ST2 and IL-6 was the best combination for the comparison of IPS with controls both at onset and at day 7 post-HCT (Table 3) . No other marker enhanced the ability of TNFR1 to distinguish IPS from viral infection at onset of clinical signs. We further analyzed each analyte in multivariable models that also included clinical factors that proved to be important in each model (Figure 1 and Supplemental Table S1 ). The adjustment variables included in each model are shown in Figure 1 . At the onset of IPS, HVEM (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; P = .001), ST2 (OR, 3.8; P = .004), and TNFR1 (OR, 3.3; P = .013) distinguished patients with IPS from unaffected controls. TNFR1 (OR, 3.4; P < .001) was the major protein that could discriminate IPS from viral pneumonia. For prognosis at day 7 post-HCT, IL-6 (OR, 1.4; P = .007) and ST2 (OR, 2.3; P = .013) were best at discriminating patients with IPS from unaffected controls, whereas there was no significant marker discriminating between IPS and viral pneumonia at this time point.\n\nWe next produced ROC curves for each biomarker without adjustment for clinical factors to obtain thresholds with optimized sensitivity and specificity for IPS ( Figure 2 ). Comparing patients with IPS and controls, ST2 provided the highest AUC (.89), followed by TNFR1 (.84) and IL-6 (.79) at onset (Figure 2A) . Cutoff values identified from the top left point of the ROC curve that best balance between the true-positive rate and false-positive rate were identified as 49 ng/mL for ST2, 5113 pg/mL for TNFR1, and 36 pg/mL for IL-6. At day 7 post-HCT, AUC values were lower, but ST2, TNFR1, and IL-6 had relatively high AUC (ST2, .80; TNFR1, .68; IL-6, .75), and the cutoff values defined at the top left point of the curve were 21 ng/mL for ST2, 3421 pg/mL for TNFR1, and 61 pg/mL for IL-6 ( Figure 2B ). In distinguishing between IPS and viral pneumonia with the onset sample, TNFR1 (top left cutoff, 7033 pg/ mL) and IL-6 (top left cutoff, 45 pg/mL) showed the highest AUC values, although they were relatively low for all the analytes ( Figure 2C ). Because ST2 and IL-6 together provided the best model fit for the comparison of patients with IPS with controls (Table 3) , we calculated ROC curves based on the multiple cytokine models (Figure 3 ). AUC at onset and at day 7 post-HCT were .91 and .83, respectively, similar values as those provided by ST2 alone (Figure 2A and B) . Positive PPVs for patients with IPS compared with unaffected controls were highest in ST2, followed by TNFR1 and IL-6 ( Figure 4 ). For instance, assuming that the prevalence of IPS among all HCT recipients is 8%, a patient with an ST2 value >49 ng/mL measured at the onset of symptoms has a 50% chance of having an IPS diagnosis, a 6-fold increase over the a priori 8% chance of identifying an IPS case. When measured at day 7 post-HCT, a patient with an ST2 value >21 ng/ mL has a 25% chance of developing IPS in the near future, approximately 3-fold higher than the assumed 8% prevalence of IPS. As expected in view of the low prevalence of the disease, the NPVs were high (>90%).\n\nWe next evaluated whether biomarkers that are related to the occurrence of IPS can provide reasonable predictions of survival. Because the proportion of patients with IPS in our cohort is much higher would be expected in a combination of the 2 populations, we downweighted the IPS cases to make their contribution to the analysis more representative (8% prevalence). We then dichotomized the patients into high or low biomarker groups using the top left cutoff values from the ROC curves at day 7 post-HCT and calculated survival curves for groups defined by high versus low biomarker levels. In this hypothetical population, high IL-6 (P < .001) or ST2 (P = .002) level at day 7 post-HCT was significantly associated with higher mortality when assuming an 8% prevalence of IPS ( Figure 5A ). We next evaluated the prognostic value of the biomarkers for mortality after IPS. Among the patients with IPS, higher ST2 levels at onset were associated with an increased risk of death up to day 200 post-HCT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38; P = .028). Moderate associations were also seen for EPCR (HR, 1.68; P = .065) and TNFR1 (HR, 1.65; P = .079) ( Figure 5B ).\n\nThis study demonstrates that ST2, IL-6, and TNFR1 can aid in the diagnosis of IPS, and TNFR1 may be used to improve discrimination between IPS and respiratory viral pneumonia, in addition to PCR assays for the different infectious agents. Importantly, patients with high values of both ST2 and/ or IL-6 at day 7 post-HCT are at high risk of future IPS occurrence, and ST2 and IL-6 are also associated with higher mortality.\n\nOur proteomics analysis identified 3 potential biomarkers of IPS; ST2, IL-6, and TNFR1. ST2 and IL-6 could function as both diagnostic and prognostic markers for IPS. ST2 is an IL-1 receptor and the receptor for its unique ligand, IL-33 [30, 31] , and was recently identified as an important biomarker of GVHD [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . ST2 also appears to be a candidate marker for the diagnosis of IPS compared with patients with uncomplicated HCT. In our study, a formal comparison with patients developing GVHD was not performed. ST2 did not discriminate IPS from viral pneumonia. This finding indicates that ST2 may be a marker of lung injury, as supported by previous reports of elevated levels in acute lung injury, and plays a role in protection against lung injury [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Interestingly, ST2 was elevated in the early phase of HCT, suggesting that it is also a prognostic marker for the future development of IPS, with the stronger PPV among the 3 markers elevated at day 7 post-HCT. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to be elevated in patients with IPS [10, 13] . Similar to ST2, IL-6 may function as a diagnostic marker compared with unaffected controls, but not in patients with viral pneumonia [13] . It is also elevated in the early phase of HCT, although not with as strong a PPV as ST2. In the multiple analyte models, the combination of ST2 and IL-6 provided the best model fit for predicting IPS compared with controls both at diagnosis and at day 7 post-HCT. However, in terms of discrimination, the AUC in the combined models did not increase compared with that in the models using only ST2, suggesting that testing for the second biomarker, IL-6, might not be worth the extra cost. TNFR1, another biomarker associated with IPS, was the single best marker in the comparison with viral pneumonia. For the diagnosis of IPS, exclusion of respiratory viral pneumonia is critical, and several obstacles, such as bronchoscopic evaluation in a patient in poor condition or availability of comprehensive assays for respiratory viruses, prevent accurate diagnosis of IPS. Therefore, TNFR1 as a potential marker to help distinguish IPS from viral pneumonia is important, although this finding requires validation in an independent cohort. Etanercept, a TNFR inhibitor, is used to treat IPS, and decreased TNFR1 levels have been reported in patients who respond to etanercept [10] [11] [12] .\n\nOur results regarding predictive values are potentially clinically relevant. The incidence of IPS is low, between 5% and 10%. Based on our data, high values of ST2 or IL-6 at day 7 post-HCT identify a subgroup with a markedly increased likelihood of IPS occurrence, which would allow close monitoring early post-transplantation and biomarkerbased preemptive interventions enabling personalized medicine in this more targeted population. Our calculation of PPV at the onset of the pulmonary symptoms showing that high ST2 has a PPV of approximately 50% provides an informative change in knowledge from the a priori likelihood of IPS based on the assumed 8% prevalence, especially when the patient cannot undergo bronchoscopic examination due to poor condition.\n\nGiven the low incidence of IPS (approximately 8%), we performed weighted Kaplan-Meier estimation in controls and patients with IPS to generate representative mortality estimates and found associations between high ST2 or IL-6 values and increased mortality in a population with typical IPS prevalence rates. Because prevention of lung injury in the early phase of disease may be important to avoid mortality following IPS, early monitoring of ST2 and IL-6 post-HCT could be informative to guide preemptive therapy. A prospective trial is needed to test this hypothesis.\n\nThis study has strengths and limitations. Our cohort constitutes one of the largest available cohorts of patients with IPS. The patients with IPS and viral pneumonia were extremely well characterized in terms of the diagnostic panel that was applied [8, 26] . For the first time in a biomarker study for IPS post-HCT, predictive values for a range of IPS prevalence scenarios were estimated. This provides valuable and practical information regarding the degree to which knowledge about an individual's biomarker values increases understanding of the likelihood of IPS for that individual, especially when patients cannot undergo bronchoscopic examination for diagnosis of IPS.\n\nOne limitation of this study was the limited numbers of IPS subjects due to the low incidence of IPS and availability of samples. Therefore, samples were collected over a long time period, which might have affected our results despite multivariable analyses including key clinical variables. Moreover, the number of subjects was insufficient to evaluate results within strata defined by the presence or absence of acute GVHD. Instead, we included acute GVHD as a clinical variable in the multivariable analysis.\n\nA second limitation is our selection of PIV and HRV cases as representative examples of viral pneumonia. We chose these respiratory viruses because they are common in HCT recipients and are associated with relatively high rates of pneumonia [32, 33] .\n\nDespite the high incidence and collection from our 25year database, the total number of the pneumonia cases with PIV or HRV was only 37 after several restrictions (ie, time point post-HCT, copathogen, and serum availability), and we could not evaluate the cytokine profiles separately. Viral pneumonia resulting from different pathogens might have a different cytokine profile. Therefore, TNFR1 might not be a biomarker for distinguishing IPS from other viral pneumonias, such as influenza or CMV.\n\nA third limitation is the lack of a validation cohort. Establishing such a cohort is difficult because the incidence rate of IPS is low, and most centers do not identify IPS reliably and do not have biobanked samples for these patients. Thus, an independent validation cohort, optimally a prospectively enrolled cohort, is warranted to validate our findings.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified ST2, IL-6, and TNFR1 as potential biomarkers that can help screen for IPS, and TNFR1 can be a useful marker to distinguish IPS from respiratory viral pneumonia. ST2 and IL-6 also may function as prognostic markers of future occurrence of IPS. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and to determine the usefulness of these IPS candidate markers.\n\nThe authors thank Zachary Stednick for assistance in retrieving clinical data and Jessica Yi, Laurel Joncas Schronce, Heather Andrew, and Jo Tono for assistance in retrieving and aliquoting samples.
