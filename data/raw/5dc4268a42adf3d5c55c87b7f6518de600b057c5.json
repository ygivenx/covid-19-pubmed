{"title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Pregnancy", "body": "The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the 68 severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an 69 accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 -2.5, indicating that 2 -3 70 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and 83 encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy 84 bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother 85 vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These 86 unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. 87 Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various 88 factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic as COVID-19 pneumonia rapidly progresses from focal to diffuse bilateral consolidation of 230 lung parenchyma, 11 which in the context of the pulmonary changes described above, would 231 more readily predispose to hypoxemic respiratory failure in pregnancy.\n\nImmune system 233 Cytokines produced by T-helper (Th) lymphocytes regulate immunity and inflammation.

The outcomes of coronavirus infections in pregnancy are summarized in Table 1 The safety of healthcare providers is of utmost importance in any pandemic and the type of 465 PPE necessary depends on the degree of perceived risk ( Neonatal death (%) 2 0^ 9* * Patients whose data was not reported were excluded from the calculations. ^1 patient who aborted her pregnancy was excluded from the calculations. a Leukocytosis was defined as a white cell count of more than 11,000 per cubic millimeter.
