{"title": "", "body": "The Coronaviridae are a family of enveloped viruses with positive-sense, monopartite, single-46 stranded RNA genomes. At 27-32 kb, coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest known RNA 47 lysis, caused stress-induced accumulation of ribosomes at the 5\u00b4 end of coding regions (CDSs; 103 [16] ). In this work, therefore, cells were not pretreated with CHX and were snap-frozen before lysis, 104 which avoids this artefact ( Table 1 ). Some of the most differentially transcribed cellular genes (ochre 113 points) are related to the host translational apparatus: Rplp1 -a ribosomal protein from the large 114 subunit; Eef1a1 -eukaryotic elongation factor 1A-1; Rps21 -a ribosomal protein from the small 115 subunit; Eif3f -eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit F; Eif3j1 -eukaryotic initiation factor 3 116 subunit J; and Eif2b3. This is also reflected in the gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis 117 ( Fig 1B; full results in Supplementary Table 2), which reveals that all GO terms enriched in the list 118 of genes significantly transcriptionally down-regulated in infection were related to protein synthesis 119 (blue points). 120 121 Several transcription-related genes were found to be transcriptionally up-regulated, for example 122 Polr2a, the gene coding for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Fig 1A) . GO terms related to 123 transcription, for example \"transcription by RNAPII\" (GO:0006366), are also enriched in the up-124 regulated genes list. Many histones feature in the transcriptionally up-regulated gene list and, as 125 such, many histone-related GO terms are enriched in this list (Fig. 1B) . Significantly, the GO term 126 \"response to unfolded protein\" (GO:0006986) is enriched 4.85-fold in the list of genes 127 transcriptionally up-regulated during infection (p=0.046, FDR-adjusted p-value), with similar fold 128 6 changes observed for \"response to topologically incorrect protein\" (GO:0035966; 4.31-fold 129 enrichment; p=0.046) (Supplementary Table 2 ) and \"response to endoplasmic reticulum stress\" 130 (GO:0034976; 3.8-fold enrichment; p=0.012) (Fig 1B - note that these terms are clustered within 131 the \"response to unfolded protein\" GO term). Accordingly, some of the most differentially 132 expressed genes were involved in the UPR such as Herpud1 -homocysteine inducible ER protein 133 with ubiquitin like domain 1; Bip -immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein; Chac1 -134 glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1; Chop -a C/EBP family transcription factor 135 involved in the ER stress response, and Xbp1 -X-Box Binding Protein 1 ( Fig 1A) . L19 (Rpl19), which has been reported to be unaffected by ER stress [22, 23] . Up-regulated 145 transcripts had qRT-PCR values broadly consistent with the RNASeq measurements ( Fig 1A and  146 1C) whereas there was a little more variation in the down-regulated transcripts, which may be partly 147 explained by the observation that Rpl19 itself was slightly, though not statistically significantly, 148 down-regulated (log 2 (fold change) = -0.34, p=0.37) (Fig 1A, yellow) . 149 150\n\nCoVs induce host translational shut-off [24-29] although the mechanisms are not completely 152 understood. We reasoned that some host genes may be resistant to virus-induced shut-off and that 153 identifying such genes might give new insights into the shut-off mechanism(s). To evaluate 154 differences at the level of translation as a result of MHV infection, we calculated relative translation 155 efficiencies (TE) -defined herein as the ratio of ribosome-protected-fragment (RPF) and total RNA 156 density in the CDS of a given gene -at 5 h p.i. using Xtail [30] , applying the same fold change and 157 p-value thresholds as for the transcription analysis. As shown in Fig 2A, Supplementary Fig 2) . Comparison of RPF distribution with 179\n\nRNASeq read distribution allows visualisation of the changes in TE. These results, consistent with 180 .

This will be further explored below. Rpl19 can be seen at 8 and 10 h p.i. but this is likely due to the fact that RT reactions were carried 226 out using a consistent amount of total RNA as starting material but, at these timepoints, viral RNA 227 comprises approximately 80% of the total RNA in the cell [16] .

In MHV-infected 17 Cl-1 cells at 5 311 and 8 h p.i., the drug prevented autophosphorylation of PERK (Fig 6A, lower panel) and 312 phosphorylation of the PERK substrate, eIF2\u03b1, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A, upper panel) , 313 effectively blocking this branch of the UPR. Pulse labelling of infected cells for one hour at 5 h p.i. 314 revealed, as expected, that prevention of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation increased modestly both viral (Fig  315   6A ) and host protein synthesis (Fig 6B) , without effect on mock-infected cells (Fig 6B) . Rpl19 was only slightly increased at the highest PERKi concentrations (Fig 6F, upper panel) .
