{"title": "In China, Students in Crowded Dormitories with a Low Ventilation Rate Have More Common Colds: Evidence for Airborne Transmission", "body": "\u201cCommon cold\u201d is a conventional term for a mild upper respiratory illness, with symptoms such as nasal blockage and discharge, sneezing, sore throat and cough [1]. Adults typically have 2\u20135 common colds per year, and children 4\u20138 colds [2]. Although such infections are often regarded as trivial, the cost to society is large [3]. Rhinoviruses have been associated with 40\u201365% of \u201ccommon colds\u201d through the year [4], and up to 80\u201392% of colds during outbreaks [5].\n\nCross-infection from an infected person to a healthy person depends on a number of factors, including how many viral particles are shed by the infected person, and the viral particles' survivability, both over time and with respect to distance from source in a shared environment. Three main mechanisms have been proposed for transmission of viruses causing airways infections:\n\nDespite many years of study, the routes of spread of viral airways infections remain controversial. One opinion is that the virus is transferred through direct contact [6], while the other is that the virus is transferred through airborne spread [7], [8]. During the SARS epidemic, early preventive messages to the public were to wash hands and, generally to avoid \u201cdirect\u201d contact spread. Later, analysis of the temporal and spatial distributions of SARS cases in a large community outbreak in Hong Kong and the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume indicated an important role for airborne spread of droplet nuclei [9].\n\nThe influence of building characteristics including ventilation on the spread of viral respiratory infections has begun to receive increased attention from the public, government, media and scientists [10]. Brundage et al. [11] studied the risk of febrile acute respiratory diseases at four army training centers and found that disease rates were significantly higher among trainees in modern energy efficient barracks that had a low ventilation rate. Menzies et al. [12] suggested that there was a relationship between lower ventilation rates and more frequent tuberculosis infections among hospital workers. Milton et al. [13] reported an association between sick leave of employees and outdoor air supply rate. Myatt's [14] study showed that the probability of detecting airborne rhinoviruses was positively associated with weekly average CO2 concentration in an office. Other factors found to be associated with rate of infectious diseases include occupancy level [15], cleaning routines and \u201cdamp\u201d buildings [16]. With respect to crowding, direct and surface contact as well as airborne transmission both appears to be factors in disease transmission. Hoge et al. found that severe overcrowding and inadequate ventilation contributed to an outbreak of pneumococcal disease in a large urban jail [17].\n\nIn China, one 20 m2 dormitory room is shared by 6\u20138 bachelor students or 4 master students or 3 PhD students. While such crowded spaces may be important sites for the propagation of respiratory infections, few studies have examined dorm room ventilation and its possible association with infection transmission.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to test whether the common cold is associated with how crowded a dorm room is and how well ventilated it is among college students in China.\n\nVerbal consents were obtained from participants, since participants did not want to be tracked back by signature. Both the study and the consent procedure were approved by the ethics committee at Tianjin University.\n\nThis study is part of the \u201cDorm Environment and Occupants' Health\u201d study, which was carried out from 2006 to 2007 at Tianjin University, China. Details of the recruitment process and questionnaire contents have been previously described [18].\n\nIn brief, this study consisted of two phases. In Phase I, demographic information, the health status of 6500 students, and building and room characteristics of 2117 dorm rooms at Tianjin University were surveyed by questionnaires. The questionnaire survey was anonymous, but building number and room number were reported by participants. Project members visited dorm rooms, distributed questionnaires and explained to participants how to fill out questionnaires. The questionnaires were collected 2 days later. The questions on common cold infections were \u201chow many times have you had a common cold in the previous 12 months (options: <6 times; 6\u201310 times; >10 times)\u201d and \u201chow long does a common cold usually last (options: <2 weeks; 2\u20134 weeks; >4 weeks)\u201d. Other questions were about frequencies of window opening, cleaning routines and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure.\n\nIn Phase II, air temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration in dorm rooms were measured by indoor air quality monitor PS 31 (http://www.sensotron.pl) for 24 hours. Air quality monitors were calibrated at the International Center for Indoor Environment and Energy, Technical University of Denmark prior to measurements. Dorm occupants reported opening status of doors and windows at day and at night during measurement (options: completely close; 2 cm open; 5 cm open; 50% open; completely open).\n\nThe out-to indoor air flow rate at night was calculated from an analysis of the build-up period of metabolic CO2 produced by sleeping occupants (1:00 a.m.\u20138:00 a.m.) [19]. Calculation details are described in Information S1. CO2 concentrations of dorm rooms were measured both in the summer (May\u2013Jul., 2006) and in the winter (Dec., 2006\u2013Apr., 2007) [20]. The average indoor air temperature and relative humidity at night were calculated (1:00 a.m.\u20138:00 a.m.). Outdoor CO2 concentration and meteorological parameters were also measured on campus during the same time.\n\nThe associations among gender, age, whether family member ever had asthma and allergy, environmental tobacco smoke, cleaning routine, window opening frequency, occupancy levels, and self-reported common cold incidence and duration were analyzed by Chi-square tests. Adjusted odds ratios of crowdedness and air flow rate for common cold infections were evaluated in multiple logistic regression models. A carbon dioxide-based risk equation [21] was used to calculate the basic reproductive number of common colds which was compared to the self-reported infection rate.\n\nA P value less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance. SPSS software 15.0 was used to perform the statistical analyses.\n\nIn Phase I, 3712 students living in 1569 dorm rooms in 13 buildings answered the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 57%. Surveys for 276 students were excluded from the analysis due to missing information. Forty eight percent (48%) of students were female. PhD students' mean age was 29 years, master students 25 years and bachelor students 22 years. Monday through Friday, 18% of participants spent less than 2 hours indoors watching TV/playing games per day, 36% spent 2\u201310 hours per day, and 46% spent more than 10 hours per day. Dorm buildings had 3\u201312 floors, with 26\u201343 dorm rooms per floor. All floors in each dorm building are homogeneous with regard to occupants' gender and education level. Dorm rooms consisted of one simple bedroom. Each floor provided two washing rooms and restrooms. Six bachelor students, 4 master students or 3 PhD students shared one dorm room with a volume of 50\u201370 m3. The average density was 5 m2 per person. Based on the questionnaire data from Phase I, 238 dorm rooms with 473 students living in these dorms were evaluated for Phase II. The evaluated dorm rooms represented different building structures, construction periods, locations and occupancy levels. There were no significant differences in students' ages, gender, self-reported common cold incidence or duration between Phase I and Phase II.\n\nIn the questionnaire survey of Phase I, 249 out of 3436 (7.3%) students reported 6\u201310 common colds in the previous 12 months, while 94 (2.8%) reported more than 10 common colds. Four hundred and thirty six (12.8%) students had common colds lasting for 2\u20134 weeks, while 65 (1.9%) reported colds lasting more than 4 weeks. Demographic information and living habits of dormitory occupants, and their associations with common cold are summarized in Table 1. Atopy was associated with increased incidence and longer duration of common cold. Male students were more susceptible than females, but had shorter duration colds. Females cleaned rooms more often than males, cleaning rooms at least twice per week 52% compared to 31% for males, and smoked less (1.4% vs. 15.9%). Passive smoking had a significant effect on the incidence of common cold (p = 0.029), but after adjustment for environmental tobacco smoke, males were still at greater risk for common colds (p = 0.010). Younger students lived in more crowded rooms and reported longer duration colds. Crowding, not age, was shown by stratification for occupancy level to be the significant association with common cold duration.\n\nSelf-reported common cold incidence and duration are compared for different occupancy levels in Figure 1. With incrementally increasing occupancy in dorm rooms, the proportion of occupants with \u22656 common colds increased significantly (p = 0.002), as did the proportion of occupants with \u22652 weeks common cold duration (p = 0.000). The odds ratios of crowdedness for common cold incidence of \u22656 times and duration of \u22652 weeks, adjusted for gender, age, hours spent indoors, family members' asthma and allergy history, environmental tobacco smoke exposure are shown in Figure 2. Students in 6-person rooms were about 2.0 times as likely to have a common cold incidence \u22656 times per year and a duration \u22652 weeks, as students in 3-person dorm rooms.\n\nFor Phase II, the evaluated dorm rooms were located in 13 buildings. Four were built between 1940 and 1960, two between 1977 and 1983, three between 1993 and 1999, and four after 2000. For newly constructed dorm buildings, concrete structure and PVC frame windows were used instead of the brick-stone structure and the wooden frame windows used in older buildings. Ventilation for all dorm rooms consisted solely of opening doors and windows. The out-to indoor air flow rates for rooms measured during summer varied significantly, from 0.8 to 110 L/s per person, with a median of 18 L/s per person. Air flow rates measured in the heating season (from Dec. 5, 2006 to Apr. 14, 2007) varied from 0.3 to 24 L/s per person, with a median of 3.0 L/s per person. Ninety percent of the dorm rooms had an out-to indoor air flow rate less than 8.3 L/s per person.\n\nThe average indoor air temperature (mean 28.0\u00b0C, 95% confidence interval (CI) 27.8\u00b0C\u201328.3\u00b0C, range 22.0\u00b0C\u201332.1\u00b0C) and relative humidity (mean 54%, 95% CI 53%\u201355%, range 27%\u201378%) in summer were high and had large variations consequent to opening doors and windows as the sole mode of ventilation. During the winter season when the heating system was in use and doors and windows were closed, weather conditions had less influence on the indoor thermal environment (temperature: mean 21.0\u00b0C, 95% CI 20.7\u00b0C\u201321.3\u00b0C, range 15.4\u00b0C\u201326.5\u00b0C; relative humidity: mean 40%, 95% CI 38%\u201341%, range 18%\u201372%). Data for temperature and relative humidity in rooms with different occupancy levels and out-to indoor air flow rates are shown in Table 2. In summer, relative humidity and temperature were not different in rooms with different air flow rates. An inverse association between occupancy level and relative humidity was caused by the measurement sequence (6-person dorms were measured at the driest time in May, whereas 3-person dorm rooms were measured in July when outdoor relative humidity was higher). Outdoor climate is the dominating factor in determining the indoor temperature and relative humidity in summer. In winter, rooms shared by 6 people had the highest relative humidity and temperature at night. A low out-to indoor air flow rate was related to a significantly higher relative humidity (p = 0.000). However, common cold infections were not significantly associated with indoor air temperature (p = 0.806) and relative humidity (p = 0.642).\n\n\nFigure 3 shows that the lowest quartile of out-to indoor air flow rates per person in both summer and winter were associated with an increased proportion of occupants with \u22656 common colds in the previous 12 months. The adjusted odds ratios of ventilation rates for common cold infections increased slightly across the quartiles. The critical ventilation rate, below which common cold incidence increases, is identified. When ventilation rate is below 6 L/s per person, the common cold incidence in dorm rooms with average 4 occupants increased from 10% to 12%. When ventilation rate is below 1 L/s per person, the common cold incidence increased from 10% to 15%.\n\nIn our study, old buildings had more dampness problems, while new buildings using modern construction technologies had smaller ventilation rates [21]. Dampness problems have been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of common cold infections [18]. In order to eliminate the influence of indoor environmental factors other than poor ventilation, the mean ventilation rates in newly constructed dorm buildings were calculated and related to the percentage of occupants with common cold infections more than 6 times annually. The ventilation rates in winter are less than those in summer, and may help nail down the critical ventilation rate, below which common cold incidence increases. Figure 4 shows that the infection rate of common colds in the \u201ctight\u201d buildings constructed after 1993 is, in winter, associated with mean ventilation rate. There were 7 buildings constructed after 1993. One building was not included in the analysis because measurements were performed in only 9 dorm rooms. On average, there were 1140 occupants in each dorm building. A mean ventilation rate of 5 L/(s\u2022person) was associated with \u22656 common colds per year in 5% of occupants , compared to a 35% for 1 L/(s\u2022person). There were 6 buildings constructed before 1993, among which 4 buildings had <10 dorm rooms measured in winter and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 2 buildings, one had mean ventilation rate of 5.7 L/(s\u2022person) and a common cold infection rate of 23.8%, while the other had a mean ventilation rate of 6.4 L/(s\u2022person) and a common cold infection rate of 7.1%.\n\nThe Wells-Riley equation estimates the number of secondary infections that arise when a single infectious case is introduced into a population where everyone is susceptible [22]. This number is called the basic reproduction number. Rudnich and Milton [23] expanded the Wells-Riley equation to apply to situations with non-steady state conditions and variable ventilation rates:(1)Where RA0 is the basic reproduction number; n is the number of occupants; f is the re-breathed fraction; and I is the number of infectors ( = 1). q is the quantum generation rate by an infected person (quanta/h), where a quantum is the amount of infectious material needed to produce infection in 63% of uniformly exposed animals, and is therefore 1.25 times the median infectious dose, 1.25\u00d7ID50. t is the exposure time (h); f = (C-C0)/Ca, where Ca is the volume fraction of CO2 added to exhaled breath, C is the volume fraction of CO2 in indoor air, and C0 is the volume fraction of CO2 in outdoor air.\n\nThe incidences (<6 times; 6\u201310 times; >10 times) and durations (<2 weeks; 2-4 weeks; >4 weeks) of common colds in the previous 12 months for different occupancy levels (6-people; 4-people; 3-people per dorm) were self-reported by occupants. The mean duration of a common cold is 7\u201310 days [1]. For this study we assumed that the duration of a common cold was 9 days. Although many viruses can produce symptoms of common cold, rhinovirus is the most frequent cause of the common cold [24]. Riley and Nardell suggested that q for rhinovirus is in the range of 1\u201310/h [25]. Here we inferred q = 9/h. We assumed that the infector remained in the dorm room 8 hours per day. The average CO2 concentrations in each dorm room from 1:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. were calculated. The estimated and self-reported number of common colds in each day in winter is compared (Table 3). These two numbers fit very well indicating the validity of this CO2-based risk model in predicting infection rate of infectious disease like common cold.\n\nIf for a given population and infectious agent, the basic reproductive number >1 then that agent can spread in the population. The critical re-breathed fraction (fc), corresponding to a basic reproduction number of 1, can be derived from Equation (1), (2)\n\n\nIn the present study, the critical re-breathed fraction in rooms with different occupancy levels and the associated critical indoor CO2 concentrations above background (outdoor CO2 concentration) were calculated from Equation (2), both as a function of exposure time (Figure 5(a)) and quantum generation rate (Figure 5(b)). Thus Figure 5 predicts the critical indoor CO2 concentrations beyond which infectious disease will spread. The family of curves in Figure 5(a) describes the trends of the critical indoor CO2 concentrations above outdoor values (C-C0) as a function of exposure times for risk of respiratory infections. The quantum generation rate used was 2/h. The critical CO2 concentration above the background levels off if the common cold lasts more than 3 weeks (exposure time 8 hours/day, totally 168 hours) (Fig 5(a)). This indicates that even for less infectious agents with quanta generation rate no more than 2/h, a full fresh outdoor air system without recirculation of indoor air needs to be used in environments where people spend extended time (for example bedrooms, dorms, schools, daycare centers) in order to prevent viral infections. In Figure 5(b), the exposure time was assumed to be 56 hours (8 hours/day, i.e. 7 days). It shows that the current ASHRAE standard of 700 ppm above the background level [26] would not prevent the infection from being spread in a dorm room with 6 occupants unless the quantum generation rate of infectious agents is no more than 1 quantum/h (Fig. 5(b)).\n\nCrowdedness and outdoor air ventilation per person are important for the spread of airborne infectious diseases in rooms such as dorms where people spend a lot of time. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted through air so that transmission is modulated by outdoor air supply rates. Further studies are warranted."}
