This procedure is adaptable to preparing a number of 5 0 -fluoro-5 0 -deoxycarbocyclic nucleoside analogs with diversity in the heterocyclic base.

However, various attempts at converting 5-6 (e.g., using DAST shown as example in Scheme 1) were unsuccessful.\n\nAttention then turned to creating a fluoro-bearing cyclopentyl unit for coupling with an appropriately functionalized purine base. Scheme 2 presents the steps employed to the requisite precursor 15. To circumvent the interference by the C-6 amino substituent of adenine under the Mitsunobu coupling conditions, 9 N 6 -bis-boc protected adenine was employed with 15 in the presence of diiso'propyl azodicarboxylate to yield 19. Acidic deprotection of 19 led to the desired 2. 10\n\nTo gain a glimpse into the biological potential of 2, it was subjected to antiviral analysis versus herpes simplex-1, herpes simplex-2, herpes simplex-1 (TK \u00c0 ), vaccinia, cowpox, vesicular stomatitis, coxsackie B4, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza 3, reovirus-1, Sindbis, Punta Toro, rhinovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis C, and West Nile, and feline coronavirus. 11 No activity was found for these viruses. However, effects toward measles (MO6) were observed (EC 50 2.8 lM, neutral red assay; EC 50 Available online at www.sciencedirect.com family of viruses it might be expected that some activity would be seen with an aristeromycin analog since this viral family is susceptible to inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine metabolism. 12 It is surprising, however, that the other paramyxo representatives (respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza) and none of the other viruses (e.g., vaccinia, cowpox, vesicular stomatitis, and reo) that are vulnerable to such interference were not affected by 2. 12 Perhaps, another mechanism is selectively operative for 2 toward measles. 13 No cytotoxicity arose in the cell lines used for the antiviral assays. 14 \n\nThis research has been supported by funds from the Department of Health and Human Services (Al 56540), which is appreciated.
