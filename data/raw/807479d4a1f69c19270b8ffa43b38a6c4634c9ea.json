{"title": "ROTAVIRUS INFECTIONS OF NEONATES", "body": "WE'reported the excretion of rotaviruses by neonates in the nurseries of two large metropolitan hospitals in Sydney.' Our studies suggested that there was a high incidence of asymptomatic infection (53% in one nursery and 26% in the other) and that the virus persisted for long periods in the nurseries. Chrystie et awl. have also drawn attention to the high infection-rate and lack of symptoms in neonates in St. Thomas' Hospital, London. On the other hand, Bishop et al. 3 ,4 described outbreaks of diarrhoea in hospital nurseries which they attribute to rotaviruses.\n\nA high percentage of cases of enteritis in infants and young children has been shown to be associated with rotaviruses, and our initial interest in neonatal infections was stimulated by the finding of rotaviruses in five babies with diarrhoea who were less than 7 days old. However, the discovery that many symptomless neonates were excreting virus raised doubts about its role as a causative agent in diarrhoea in the very young and we have therefore extended our studies to six hospital nurseries in the greater metropolitan area of Sydney.\n\nFaecal specimens were collected from all babies in a particular nursery on a given day. 5 standard public hospital nurseries in widely scattered areas of metropolitan Sydney were surveyed in this manner. No baby had diarrhoea at the time of the survey. Specimens were subsequently collected from neonates with diarrhoea, a few with \"loose\" or \"mucousy\" stools, and from normal babies during outbreaks of diarrhoea. Most of the neonates were less than 7 days old. Specimens were transported to the laboratory within 24 h and stored at -20&deg;C until processed.\n\nA 20% w/v suspension of faeces was made in Hanks' balanced salt solution without antibiotics, mixed with an equal volume of Arklone P (trichlorotrifluoroethane), and homogenised thoroughly for 5 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 7000 g for 20 min and the aqueous layer removed. A portion of this aqueous layer was then centrifuged at 240 000 g for 30 min. For electron microscopy the pellet was resuspended in a few drops of distilled water, one drop of which was placed on a carbon-coated parlodion grid, allowed to dry, and then negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid at pH 6-5. A Philips 201 electron microscope was used.\n\nFaecal specimens from 628 neonates were processed and examined for viruses. Rotaviruses were found in 304 (49%) (table i). The four groups of neonates (normal babies tested during surveys, normal babies tested during outbreaks of diarrhoea in the nurseries, those with diarrhoea, and those with mild gastrointestinal symptoms) gave excretion rates of 44%, 46%, 61%, and 45% respectively. Of the 6 nurseries 5 showed evidence of infection. In the sixth nursery no rota viruses were found during the survey or later when there were cases of diarrhoea. The difference between the percentage of positive excretors in the diarrhoea group and that in the normal-baby group is statistically significant (P<0.05).\n\nVery few other viral particles were found in the deposits examined by electron microscopy. 2 myxoviruslike particles, 2 coronavirus-like particles, a small 18 nm particle (possibly a parvovirus), 4 mycoplasma-like organisms, and a number of bacteriophages were the only other microorganisms seen. Attempts to isolate viruses by standard cell-culture techniques were unsuccess- More than 100 specimens were tested but no viruses were cultivated. Likewise bacteriological investigations did not reveal any pathogens.\n\nAge of Infection Continuing Presence of Virus and Seasonal Incidence 2 nurseries were studied continuously for 9 mo and another for 11 mo. Rotaviruses were regularly found in \n\nThese studies indicate that about half the newborn babies in the nurseries of five major metropolitan hospitals in Sydney were infected with rotaviruses before they were discharged. The great majority of these infections were asymptomatic and apparently quite transient in some babies. One surprising feature was the rapidity with which the neonates became infected after they entered the nursery. 3 out of 35 babies tested were found to be excreting virus one day after birth and 24 out of 65 (35%) two days after birth. From the third day, approximately 50% were excreting virus. The neonatal gut is colonised by lactobacilli and Escherichia coli within a few days of birth and it is not unreasonable to assume that rapid infection can take place with rotavir-uses. Mebus et al. have shown that bovine rotavirus will produce diarrhoea in newborn calves in 15 h after artificial inoculation. Excretion of viruses 24-48 h after birth by the human neonate is therefore not improbable.\n\nHow the virus is acquired is not known but the few available facts strongly suggest environmental spread within the nursery. Adults seldom excrete rotaviruses and although a few cases of gastroenteritis and asymptomatic infection have been recorded7,8 it is unlikely that individual infection is acquired directly from mother or nurses.\n\nIt is most likely that the virus enters the nursery through a visiting child or the rare adult excretor and then passes readily from neonate to neonate; the result is a persisting endemic infection as susceptible babies enter the nursery.\n\nWe found no seasonal variation in the incidence of infection. About half the babies in the nursery seem to be consistently excreting virus throughout the year, unlike the infants and young children in whom the prevalence of the virus increases in the late winter and early spring.9\n\nBecause of the high infection-rate among the newborn babies without symptoms, the role of rotaviruses as a cause of enteritis is not clear. Only 84 out of 304 babies (28%) excreting virus had diarrhoea. However, there were significantly more neonates with diarrhoea excreting virus than the symptom-free group (p<0.05) and in the absence of any other pathogen it seems that these viruses do in fact cause diarrhoea in some neonates. It was noted that viruses from some babies were coated with an antibody-like material; this feature may be an indication of the antibody level of the mother's milk or perhaps the non-antibody virus inhibitor recently described in human and cow's milk by Matthews et al.Io We did not find \"antibody\" coated viruses in cases of diarrhoea. The possible existence of rotavirus serotypes of differing pathogenicity could also explain the variable response to infection, but the determination of minor antigenic differences is not possible with the techniques available at present."}
