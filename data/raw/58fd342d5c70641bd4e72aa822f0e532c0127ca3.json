{"title": "Comparative analyses of SAR-CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations and other coronavirus family genomes reveals unique features potentially consequential to host-virus interaction and pathogenesis", "body": "domain of spike protein which is most variable part in coronavirus genome (3) .\n\nThere are more than 400 SARS-CoV2 assembled genomes available at NCBI database.\n\nSequence analysis of the genomes can give us plethora of information which can of use for drug development and vaccine development research attempts. In the current work we collected SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical origins mainly from India, Italy, USA, Nepal and Wuhan to identify notable genomic features of SARS-CoV2 by integrated analysis. These analyses include identification of notable mutational signatures, host antiviral-miRNA identification and epitope prediction.\n\nAs a host defense mechanism, a repertoire of host miRNAs also target invading viruses.\n\nWe followed the parameters used in various anti-viral miRNA databases to predict host anti-viral miRNAs against SARS-CoV2. Our analysis shows unique host-miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV2 virus genes. respectively, were retrieved from NCBI genome database. SARS-CoV2 genomes from India, Italy, USA, Nepal along with SARS-CoV and MERS were used as query genomes to compare with Wuhan SARS-CoV2 genome. Genes and protein sequences of SARS-CoV2 were retrieved from ViPR database (4) .\n\nAll assembled query genomes in FASTA format were analyzed using Genome \n\nTo understand the variation in genomes from various geographical areas used in the study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. Neighbor joining method with bootstrap value of 1000 replicates was used for the construction of consensus tree using MEGA software(6) (10.1.7 version). CELLO2GO (7)server was used to infer biological function for each protein of SARS-CoV2 genome with their localization prediction.\n\nThe mutations reported in literature (3)were catalogued and evaluated for pathogenicity.\n\nWe used MutPred(8)server to identify disease associated amino acid substitution from neutral substitution, with a p-value of >=0.05. In order to assess the impact of SNPs on protein stability, we used two machine learning based prediction methods. The first method, I-MUTANT server(9) was used to predict stability of the protein sequences at pH 7.0 and temperature 25\u02daC. The second prediction method is MuPro(10) server, the predictions with the former method helps in getting a consensus prediction.\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

Only these host miRNAs were processed for downstream analysis. (Figure 1 \n\nTo identify potential host microRNA target sites in the virus genome sequences, we have used miRanda (3.3 a version) (12, 13) software, with an energy threshold of -20 kcal/mol. We also used psRNATarget server to compare the predicted targets by the two methods (14) .\n\nAll the genes and protein sequences for SARS-CoV2 were retrieved from ViPR database. To identify CTL and B-cell epitopes we have used CTLpred(15), ABCpred(16) servers with default parameters. CHEMOpred (17) and Vaxijen server (18) were used to predict chemokines and protective probable antigen, respectively ( Figure 1(c) ).\n\nAssembled SARS-CoV2 genomes sequences in FASTA format from India, USA, China, Italy and Nepal used for coronavirus typing tool analysis. Using the tool, we were able to locate query SARS-CoV genomes with known SARS-CoV2 to obtain a cladogram for evolutionary analysis as shown in Figure to S13_Q14insSDLD (21601_21602insAGTGACCTTGAC) ( Table S1 ) was also revealed.

L455Y mutation predicted to altered Ordered interface, Disordered interface Stability, transmembrane protein and gain of GPI-anchor amidation at N450 position (Table 2) .\n\nIt is known, and also confirmed by Gene ontology analysis that the protein is involved in pathogenesis, membrane organization, reproduction, symbiosis, encompassing mutualism through parasitism, and locomotion. PsRNATarget analysis based on the complementary matching between the sRNA sequence and target mRNA sequence with predefined scoring schema identified 6 miRNAs out of the 9 identified miRNAs to target SARS-CoV2 genes. The 6 miRNAsare predicted to act on the viral genomes by cleaving their target sites (Table   4 ).\n\nIntriguingly, our analysis (S. Figure 2 ) revealed that there is only a single host miRNA (hsa-miR-27b) uniquely targeting the India SARS-CoV2.Strikingly, the hsa-miR-27b\n\nhas been linked to target host IFN-gamma signaling pathways in certain viral infections. Studies on SARS-CoV (30, 31) shows that Interferon-beta and interferon-gamma synergistically inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus.

Further, we also identified host anti-viral miRNAs predicted to target the spikeglycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, as shown in Figure 3 . \n\nImmunogenic properties of SARS-CoV2 proteins CTL and B-cell epitopes for each protein of SARS-CoV 2 were determined using CTLpred and ABCPred servers (Table 5) .\n\nAmong CTL predictions for spike surface glycoprotein LTTRTQLPP peptide at 130 position was highly antigenic with score 1.

Non-structural proteins display similar CTL and B-Cell epitopes i.e YACWHHSIGFDYVYNP and SGTYEGNSPFHPLADN with a prediction score of more than 0.9.\n\nCTL and B-cell epitopes for Nucleocapsid protein are TQALPQRQK and TRRIRGGDGKMKDLSP with the highest predictive score at 121 positions. The highest overall protective antigen prediction probability was observed for ORF7b with a score of 0.64 as reported by VaxiJen server. \n\nWe have used bioinformatics tools to investigate SARS-CoV2 sequences from different geographical locations. The Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes, the nucleotide sequence diversity analysis of the genomes, the predicted antiviral host miRNAs specific to the genomes and the prediction of immune active sequences in the genomes have yielded some interesting facts, including unique features.\n\nFor the phylogenetic analysis, we compared the sequences of 6 SARS-CoV2 isolates from different countries namely, Wuhan, India, Italy, USA and Nepal along with other author/funder.

As reported earlier too (19, 20) , the virus from Wuhan showed higher similarity with SARS-CoV. There was no phylogenetic segregation of the genomes based on geographic origin, whether from the same continent or a neighboring country (Figure 1 ) but, ambiguously showing varied clustering like Italy and Nepal clustered together, followed by India and USA. This reiterates the findings indicating the massive exchange and importation of the carriers between the epicenter Wuhan and these countries. However, a detail analysis, complemented with more sequences and patient met data will give further evolutionary insights regarding the fast spreading pandemic.\n\nThe phylogenetics heterogeneity between different strains is explored by genome variation profiling to find alterations in genetic information during the course of evolution, outbreak, and clinical spectrum caused by the different strains. In case of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV too, few clinical characteristics differentiate them among themselves and with other seasonal influenza infections as well, as reported recently (21) . Interestingly in the present analysis, in comparison to SARS-CoV, we observed at least one of the variations like indels, deletions, misaligned and frameshift in all the SARS-CoV2 proteins except ORF6, ORF10 and ORF14 (Table S1 ).\n\nThe spread and containment of the SARS-CoV2 outbreak is varying among different countries (https://www.gisaid.org/). Amongst other factors, sequence of the host invasion factors of the virus strain may possibly play an important role in degree of transmission, virulence and pathogenicity of the virus. Therefore, we set out to investigate the genetic variations present in the spike surface glycoprotein (S) which plays a significant role in binding of the virus to the host cell, and determining host tropism and pathogenicity (22) . Going well with the expectations from a rapidly transmitting pandemic virus, in our analysis, we observed various mutations located in the regions associated with immune response (Table S2) . These mutations may have significant impact on the antigenic and immunogenic changes responsible for differences in the severity of the outbreak in different geographical regions. author/funder.

Surprisingly, the mutation spectrums were different among these countries (Table 3) . While sequence from Nepal showed no variations, the maximum number of mutations were identified in Indian sequence-located in ORF1ab, nsp2, nsp3, helicase, ORF8 protein and spike surface glycoprotein (Table3). Probably presence of the unique mutations identified in the genome from Italy are responsible for the sudden upsurge in the number of affected cases and deaths (2), combined with other factors-a speculation which maybe verified with more evidences. From this analysis, we also speculate that the presence of country specific mutation spectrum may also be able to explain the current scenario in these countries like severity of illness, containment of the outbreak, the extent and timing of exposures to a symptomatic carrier etc.\n\nNon-structural proteins have their specific roles in replication and transcription (23) .\n\nPrevious studies on SARS-CoV revealed Nsp15 as a potential candidate for the therapeutic target (24) . It is noteworthy to mention that in the present study; various mutations have been identified in all the non-structural proteins suggesting them to be an important and potential player in proposing therapeutic targets and should be explored experimentally.\n\nMany studies have reported that miRNAs not only act as the signature of tissue expression and function but also as potential biomarkers playing important role in regulating disease pathophysiology (25) . In viral infections, host antiviral miRNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of immune response to virus infection depending upon the viral agent. Many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes and their functions like interfering with replication, translation and expression.\n\nIn the present study, we tried to predict the antiviral host-miRNAs specific for SARS-CoV2.Firstly, we compared SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV and identified a list of 6 miRNAs unique to SARS-CoV2 and previously reported to be associated with other virus diseases, including HIV (Table. 4 ). author/funder.

Also there are studies on the regulatory role of miRNA hsa-mir-27b-3p described in ACE2 Signaling (27) . The results of the present study suggest a strong correlation between miRNA hsa-mir-27b-3p and ACE2 which needs to be confirmed experimentally in SARS-CoV2 cases.\n\nFurther, we tried to compare the miRNAs in the genomes and observed some striking findings. We observed that out of all the miRNAs, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique miRNA specific to India SARS-CoV2 and showed no significant complementarity-based nucleotide-binding with the strain of SARS-CoV2 from other countries. This is surprising and is of utmost importance along with our other novel finding of a unique mutation identified in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian sequence. The target of the hsa-miR-27b sequence is the location containing A930V mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein which perhaps, should be explored further, experimentally. Reports have demonstrated the ability of miR-27b to inhibit HIV-1 replication (28) . There are contradicting reports regarding the use of HIV antiviral regimen for SARS-CoV2 infection showing no effects in China (29) while the Indian Council of Medical Research (India) has given the guidelines for the use of HIV treatment in these cases as some of the patients showed improvement with the administration. A few other drugs, including FDA approved antiviral and antimalarials are being used with significant claimed-successes. Needless to say, the variation in the protein sequences may have some influence on the therapeutic effects of these drugs.\n\nBased on our analysis, we speculate an important regulatory role of miR-27b in SARS-CoV2 infection. The contradictory treatment outcomes may be due to the presence of the miR-27b target in the Indian genome specifically. It probably indicates author/funder. All rights reserved.

For example, one may analyse the link between severity of diseases to each of the variants, expression of the predicted host antiviral miRNAs can be checked in the patients, the predicted epitopes may be explored for their immunogenicity, difference in treatment outcomes may also be correlated with genome variations, lastly the potential of the unique segments of the virus proteins and the unique host miRNAs may be explored in development of novel antiviral therapies."}
