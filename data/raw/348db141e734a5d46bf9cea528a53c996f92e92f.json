{"title": "Deep Learning-Based Recognizing COVID-19 Deep Learning-Based Recognizing COVID-19 and other Common Infectious Diseases of the Lung by Chest CT 2 Scan Images", "body": ". Although the upward trend of COVID-19 has been 94 effectively curbed, the number of confirmed cases has increased dramatically in 95 several countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, and other countries. 96\n\nAccording to the WHO interim guidance (2) and series diagnosis and treatment scheme 97 for COVID-19 of China, confirmed case of COVID-19 was made on the basis of a 98 positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time 99 reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of specimen 100 collected by nasal and pharyngeal swab. However, the false negative rate of nucleic 101 acid detection may be relatively high in early stage of 102 repeated tests are needed to get positive results. Novel coronavirus that leads to 103 COVID-19 is encoded by RNA, which is a highly unstable and tends to be degraded 104 by RNAase. RNAase is widely found in saliva and surrounding environment. Thus, 105 RNA of novel coronavirus in the specimen collected by nasal and pharyngeal swab 106 All rights reserved.

Another 108 constraint in practice is that the supply of assay kits of nucleic acid detection may be 109 seriously inadequate in case of a large-scale outbreak of disease. In contrast, 110 COVID-19 has relatively unique imaging features in CT manifestations. In early stage 111 (less than 1 week after symptom onset), the predominant pattern was unilateral or 112 bilateral ground-glass opacities. Within 1-3 weeks, ground-glass opacities will 113 progress to or co-existed with consolidations. (3) According to the investigation by 114 Guan et al, (4) at the time of admission, 86.2% revealed abnormal CT scans whereas 115 radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 97.1% of the patients with severe type 116 of COVID-19. What cause the characteristic abnormality found by CT scans? 117\n\nHistological examination reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid 118 exudates, which may lead to the changes in CT scans (5) . Fibromyxoid exudates in 119 alveoli may further cause disorder in gas exchange and even respiratory failure, which 120 is consistent with the observation by Li et al. (6) 121\n\nGiven the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the above advantages of CT scan, we 122 developed deep learning-based detection of characteristic abnormality to facilitate the 123 early diagnosis of COVID-19. 124 125 All rights reserved.

Identifiable personal information, 148 such as name of the enrolled patients, name of hospital, etc, was removed. 149\n\nConsecutive images of the lung fields for each patient were selected for image 150 recognizing. For a specific patient, he will be classified as \"COVID-19\" case if 151 typical CT manifestations related to COVID-19 were identified even in only one 152\n\nimage. This rule was also true for other diseases, such as non-COVID-19 virtual 153 pneumonia, biological pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis. But for each selectee, 154 only when all of his images were recognized as \"normal\" will he be classified into the 155 group of \"normal\". 156 157 Datasets 158 Lung CT scan images collected from Department of radiology, Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan 159\n\nHospital were randomly divided into training set or validation set at a ratio of 3:1.

Multi-class comparison was performed 255 between COVID-19, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, 256 pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung. Confusion matrix of the AI framework 257 based on test dataset was shown in Figure 2 . Binary classification between COVID-19 258 and the other four types, including non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial 259 pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and normal lung, was also implemented to 260 evaluate the performance of recognizing COVID-19. For test dataset, accuracy, 261 sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 98.8%, 98.2%, 262 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). The ROC curve was 263 generated to evaluate the AI algorithm's ability to distinguish COVID-19 from other 264 four types. The area under the ROC curve was 99.0% (Figure 2 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 severe cases and mild cases were 60.0% and 61.3%, respectively whereas positive 284 rates for throat swabs reduced to 50.0% and 29.6% for severe cases and mild cases, 285 respectively (8) . 286 COVID-19 may cause asymptomatic infection in some individuals (9) . Asymptomatic 287 or mild cases combined are reported to represent about 40-50% of all infections (10) . 288\n\nLike confirmed COVID-19 cases, asymptomatic carriers of novel coronavirus acts as 289 the infectious sources of COVID-19. Usually, confirmed COVID-19 patients are 290 known risk and easy to prevent. However, asymptomatic carriers are \"hidden 291 enemies\", which tends to become mobile infectious sources. 292\n\nDue to the unsatisfying positive rate nucleic acid detection and huge number of 293 asymptomatic carriers, developing alternative methods of detection is urgently needed. 294\n\nIndeed, there is some significant advantages of detecting infected patients by CT 295 scanning.

There is large 301 number of potential patients in need. More than that, each examination of CT imaging 302 will generate a large number of images and significant inter-observer-variation exists 303 in the interpretation of CT images. Thus, it is necessary to develop new auxiliary 304 measures for the interpretation of CT images. In this study, we report an artificial 305 intelligence framework based on deep learning for identifying COVID-19, which has 306 balanced sensitivity and specificity. More than that, the area under the ROC curve was 307 high as 99.0% evaluated by test dataset. Another advantage of our study is that five 308 diseases or conditions were enrolled, which cover the most common infectious 309 diseases of the lung. The limitation is that our AI framework will need further 310 evaluation by more wide clinical application. 311 312 All rights reserved.
