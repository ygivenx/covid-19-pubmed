If the flanking sequences of the transcription consensus sequence affect Preparation of virus-specific intracellular RNA and transcription, then the different results from these two Northern (RNA) blotting studies may be explained by the differences in the nature of sequences flanking the inserted intergenic sequence.\n\nVirus-specific RNAs in virus-infected cells were extracted as previously described (Makino et al., 1984) .

Mouse DBT Northern blot hybridization was performed (Jeong and Makino, 1992) . The 32 P-labeled probes were prepared by cells (Hirano et al., 1974) were used for growth of viruses. a random-priming procedure (Sambrook et al., 1989) . For the densitometric analysis, autoradiograms were scanned using a scanner (RELI 4816 scanner, Relysis) and the intensity of each band was quantitated using Scan Analysis program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).\n\nPrimer extension products were purified from the gel and amplified by PCR under the same conditions described above. The gel-purified RT-PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Direct PCR sequencing was performed according to the procedure established by Winship (1989) .\n\nWe examined whether sequences outside of the consensus sequence could affect subgenomic RNA transcription efficiency by using the subgenomic DI RNA system. We initially constructed eight different MHV DI cDNA clones, each with a 12-nucleotide-long TCTAATCTAAAC insert (12-nt sequence) placed at a different site; that inserted 12-nt sequence is perfectly complementary to the 3 region of the genomic leader sequence and in- (Makino et al., 1988a) and intide numbering begins from the 5-end of DE5-w3, and the inserted 12cludes cis-acting replication signals, which are essential nucleotide sequences are boxed.\n\nfor MHV-JHM DI RNA replication; these regions were the 5-most 0.47 kb, the 3-most 0.46 kb, and about 60 nucleotides near the 5 end of domain II (Kim et al., 1993;  labeled by random-priming with 32 P. This probe detects only helper virus genomic RNA, genomic DI RNAs, and Kim and Makino, 1995b; Lin and Lai, 1993) (Fig. 1A) . We used PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to insert the subgenomic DI RNAs ( Fig. 2A) . For the detection of the remaining DI mutants, we used the EagI-SphI fragment 12-nt sequence into DE5-w3. The locations of the 12-nt sequences in these eight clones, DI-AflIII, DI-StuI, DI-of DE5-w3 as a probe (Fig. 2C) , and a probe corresponding to a region 18 to 262 nucleotides from the 3-end of EagI, DI-SphI, DI-SpeI, DI-D20, DI-NruI, and DI-TA 7, are shown in Fig. 1B . ; the former probe detects only helper virus mRNA 1 and genomic DI RNAs and the latter We examined replication and transcription of these DI RNAs in DI RNA-transfected, MHV-infected cells. DI binds to all MHV RNA species. To directly compare the efficiency of subgenomic DI RNA transcription, we used RNAs were synthesized in vitro and transfected by lipofection into DBT cell monolayers that were infected with the same membrane in the experiments documented in Figs. 2B and 2C.

From DI cDNAs, this band probably represented a DI RNA that was newly DI-StuI, DI-EagI, DI-SphI, DI-SpeI, DI-D20, and DI-NruI, generated in DI RNA-transfected cells. All the DI RNAwe removed a 0.4-kb-long PCR fragment, which carried replicating cells synthesized subgenomic DI RNA with the 12-nt sequence and 0.2 kb of its upstream and downdifferent transcription efficiencies. The difference in the stream flanking sequences, and inserted this into the radioactivity ratios of subgenomic DI RNA to genomic DI AflII-SacII site of DE5-w3 to produce FDI-StuI, FDI-EagI, RNA for these five DI RNAs was roughly comparable to FDI-SphI, FDI-SpeI, FDI-D20, and FDI-NruI, respectively those of the parental DI RNAs (Figs. 2 and 4) .

Schematic diagram of the structure of DE5-w3 and DE5-w3-derived insertion mutants with flanking sequences. Fragments for FDIs contained a 0.4-kb-long PCR product consisting of the 12-nucleotide sequence (solid box) and 0.2 kb from an upstream and a downstream flanking sequence; the flanking sequences were derived from DI-StuI, DI-EagI, DI-SphI, DI-SpeI, DI-D20, and DI-NruI genomic fragments. The 0.4-kb PCR fragment of DI-StuI, DI-EagI, DI-SphI, DI-SpeI, DI-D20, and DI-NruI was inserted into the AflII-SacII site of the DE5-w3 to produce FDI-StuI, FDI-EagI, FDI-SphI, FDI-SpeI, FDI-D20, and FDI-NruI, respectively. Solid boxes represent the 12-nucleotide sequence. Locations of probe 1 and probe 2 used for Northern blot analysis (see Fig. 4 ) are also shown.\n\nEffect of the 12-nt sequence location on transcription probe 1 (Fig. 5A ). FDI-StuI/Sp, FDI-EagI/Sp, FDI-SphI/Sp, FDI-AflII/Sp, and FDI-SacII/Sp replicated and transcribed We next examined whether the location of the 12-nt (Fig. 5B) . The molar ratio of the genomic to subgenomic sequence could affect transcription by constructing a new series of DI cDNAs with the 12-nt sequence positioned at different sites in DE5-w3; each construct was similar to the others in that they all contained the 0.4-kb inserted region that carried the 12-nt sequence and its upstream and downstream 0.2-kb sequences; each construct differed only in the location of the insertion within the DI genome. We chose the 0.4-kb fragment used for construction of FDI-SpeI, because FDI-SpeI showed the most efficient subgenomic DI RNA transcription (Fig. 4) . We inserted this 0.4-kb fragment at the AflIII, StuI, EagI, SphI, AflII, SacII, and NruI sites of DE5-w3 to produce FDI-AflIII/Sp, FDI-StuI/Sp, FDI-EagI/Sp, FDI-SphI/Sp, FDI-AflII/Sp, FDI-SacII/Sp and FDI-NruI/Sp, respectively (Fig.  5A) . We expected that this set of DI constructs would overcome the transcriptional suppressive effect that structure of DE5-w3 and DE5-w3-derived insertion mutants with flanking sequences. Fragment for FDIs contained a 0.4-kb-long PCR product consisting of the 12-nucleotide sequence (solid box) and 0.2 kb from an upstream and a downstream flanking sequence of DI-SpeI genomic fragments. This 0.4-kb PCR fragment was inserted into the AflIII site, StuI site, EagI site, SphI site, AflII site, SacII site, and NruI site of the DE5-w3 to produce FDI-AflIII/Sp, FDI-StuI/Sp, FDI-EagI/Sp, FDI-SphI/Sp, FDI-AflII/Sp, FDI-SacII/Sp, and FDI-NruI/Sp, respectively. Solid boxes represent the 12-nucleotide sequence. Location of probe 1 for Northern blot analysis is also shown. (B) Northern blot analysis of FDI RNAs. Intracellular RNAs were extracted from DI RNA-transfected, MHV-infected cells (lanes 6-10) or DI RNA-transfected, mock-infected cells (lanes 1-5), and poly(A)-containing RNAs were analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Lane 11 represents RNA from MHV-infected cells. 32 P-labeled probe 1 (see A) was used as a probe. Arrow represents genomic DI RNAs.\n\nDI RNA from these replication-competent DI RNAs was inserted within the cis-acting replication signals in these DI RNAs (Kim et al., 1993) (Fig. 1) . Probably the insertion essentially the same (Fig. 5B) ; the ratio was approximately 0.3, a value that was very close to that of FDI-of the 0.4 kb disrupted the structure of the cis-acting replication signals in regions that were essential for DI SpeI. We did not observe replication of FDI-AflIII/Sp and FDI-NruI/SP (data not shown). The 0.4-kb region was RNA replication, resulting in failure of the DI RNA to replicate. These data indicated that the location of 12-nt 2 and genes 2-3 demonstrated subgenomic DI RNA transcription activity that was similar to the 0.4-kb-long sequence on DE5-w3 was not crucial for the regulation of subgenomic DI RNA transcription.\n\nflanking sequences of the intergenic region of genes 6-7, indicating that no transcriptionally suppressive element existed in the naturally occurring flanking se-Effect of the naturally occurring sequences that flank quences adjacent to the intergenic regions at genes 1the MHV intergenic regions on transcription 2 and 2-3.

We quence. Less subgenomic DI RNA synthesis in FDI-6/ 7M than in FDI-6/7wt was consistent with our previous interpreted these data as indicating that nonnaturally occurring sequences flanking the 12-nt sequence could study; in that study a mutant like FDI-6/7M, with the same deletion in the intergenic region between genes 6 and suppress subgenomic DI RNA transcription, whereas naturally occurring sequences flanking the genes 6-7 7, synthesized significantly less subgenomic DI RNA than did a DI RNA with an intact intergenic region (Makino intergenic sequence do not suppress transcription.\n\nWe examined naturally occurring flanking sequences and Joo, 1993). from other MHV intergenic regions. For this analysis we chose sequences surrounding the genes 1-2 intergenic Sequences surrounding genomic cryptic consensus sequence and the genes 2-3 intergenic sequence. The sequences suppressed transcription amounts of mRNA 2 and mRNA 3, synthesized from the intergenic regions between genes 1-2 and genes 2-3, MHV transcription regulation is flexible enough to recognize altered consensus sequences in which just one respectively, are about 50 and 30 times lower than the amount of mRNA 7 in MHV-infected cells (Leibowitz et of seven consensus sequence nucleotides is changed to any of the three possible alternative bases (Joo and al., 1981) . Currently we do not know why the amount of mRNA 2 and mRNA 3 is significantly lower than mRNA . Indeed some MHV sequences that differ only by one nucleotide from the consensus sequence 7. We constructed six different DI cDNAs, all of which had an insertion of a 0.4-kb fragment at the AflII-SacII are transcriptionally active (Schaad and Baric, 1993) . However, many genomic cryptic consensus sequences site of DE5-w3 (see Figs. 3 and 6) .

The genomic DI RNA in DI RNA-transfected, MHV-A59-infected cells by Northern blot analysis using the 32 P-la-inserted 0.4-kb fragment of FDI-M1, FDI-M2, and FDI-M3 corresponded to MHV-JHM sequences at about 0.7-1.1 beled SacII-SpeI fragment of DE5-w3 as a probe (probe 2) (see Fig. 3 ).

Replication of FDI-M5 was lower than that of the other DI RNAs, which was consistent with subgenomic DI RNA transcription (Makino et al., 1991) .\n\nour previous study showing that DI RNAs that do not synthesize subgenomic DI RNA replicate more efficiently than those that synthesize subgenomic DI RNA (Jeong and Makino, 1992) . Here we clearly showed that flanking sequences of UCUUAAC in FDI-M1, FDI-M2, and FDI-M3 suppressed subgenomic DI RNA transcription, whereas the flanking sequences of UCUUAAC in FDI-M5 did not.

Noncoronavirus RNAs containing negative sense transcription consensus sequence of coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) serve as templates for transcription in TGEV-infected cells (Hiscox et al., 1995) . These data suggest that the coronavirus transcription machinery most probably recognizes transcription consensus sequences for transcription. Recognition of the intergenic region by MHV transcription machinery may involve host proteins (Zhang and Lai, 1995) . One possible mechanism of flanking-sequence-mediated transcription-suppression is that the transcription consensus sequence and its flanking sequences may form a stable RNA structure that may prevent accessibility of the MHV transcription mechanism to the consensus sequence.

Most of DI RNAs we studied in our previous studies contained the 18-nucleotide-long natu-S protein is essential for MHV replication; S protein binds to the cell receptor to initiate infection (Dveksler et al., rally occurring intergenic sequence from genes 6-7 with its natural occurring flanking sequence, thus we could 1991). Expression of both of those MHV genes seems to be crucial for replication and pathogenesis of MHV.

During the evolution of MHV, 2/3M that lacked the transcription suppressive element found in the flanking sequences, the sequence comple-many mutations must have occurred within the sequences flanking the intergenic region of these genes; mentarily between the intergenic sequence and the 3end of leader sequence did not directly correlate with variant viruses whose flanking sequences did not suppress transcription might have had a selective advan-transcription efficiency. In a similar report, van der Most et al. (1994) concluded that the extent of base pairing tage. We showed that flanking sequences of the intergenic between the leader RNA and the intergenic sequence does not control subgenomic RNA abundance; they ana-sequence at genes 6-7 contained the transcription suppressive element. MHV mRNA 7 synthesized from the lyzed several MHV-A59-derived DI RNAs with inserted transcription consensus sequences. On the contrary, de-intergenic region at genes 6-7 encodes the N protein that is essential for MHV replication; N protein forms creasing complementarily between the intergenic sequence and the 3-end of the leader sequence results in helical nucleocapsid and is most likely required for viral RNA synthesis (Compton et al., 1987;  Kim and Makino, a decreasing level of subgenomic DI RNA transcription in DI RNAs with an inserted genes 6-7 region (Makino 1995a) . Probably sequences that correspond to the transcription suppressive element encode an important func-et al., 1991; Makino and Joo, 1993) . We speculate that the different conclusions between van der Most et al.\n\ntion for either M protein or N protein, thus this transcription suppressive element was not eliminated during MHV (1994) and our previous studies probably reflect the dif-"}
