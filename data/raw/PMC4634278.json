{"title": "Epidemiological and clinical features of human coronavirus infections among different subsets of patients", "body": "The genus Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a variety of livestock, poultry, and companion animals, in which they can cause serious and often fatal respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases.1 The first reports on human coronaviruses (HCoVs) appeared in the mid\u20101960s. The human viruses were isolated from persons with the common cold, and two species were detected: HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43.2\n\n\nAlmost 40 years later, an emergent HCoV was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 While SARS\u2010CoV was eradicated from the human population after a highly effective global public health response,4 its emergence necessitated a rethinking of the role that CoVs play as a potential cause of more than just the common cold. Thereafter, there was an increase in research on HCoVs worldwide, which has led to the discovery of two other HCoVs, HCoV\u2010NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV\u2010HKU1 in China.5, 6 Reports have documented that HCoVs are involved in a wide spectrum of clinical presentation in upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 as well as being a contributor to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease16 and among patients presenting cystic fibrosis.17 The involvement of other non\u2010respiratory organ systems is still controversial but can occur, for example the enteric and nervous systems.18, 19 Additionally, the role of HCoV infections among susceptible groups, outbreaks, and fatal cases has been documented.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 However, the majority of reports describe HCoV infections only among children. Moreover, longitudinal studies of CoV epidemiology in the literature are lacking and are restricted to descriptions spanning 1\u20133 years at most.26, 27, 28 In this study, we conducted a comprehensive 9\u2010year study of the epidemiological and clinical features of all four circulating HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63) among four different subsets (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) of adult and child patients.\n\nDuring the 9\u2010year study, respiratory samples were collected from patients presenting acute respiratory illnesses and those who were asymptomatic. The study period began in June 2001 and concluded in September 2010. We collected 1137 samples and stored them at \u221280\u00b0C. The clinical specimens from the studied patients were collected from specific units by trained professionals (nurses or doctors). The specimens comprised 464 nasopharyngeal swabs, 208 nasal aspirations, and 465 nasal lavages. The subjects were 50 asymptomatic adults and 1087 patients presenting acute respiratory infections (ARIs): 465 from the general community (adults, children, and healthcare workers), 410 with comorbidities (children with heart diseases, patients with stem cell and renal transplants), and 212 hospitalized patients (adults and children) originally suspected of H1N1 2009 influenza infection. Of the 1137 studied patients, 591 (51.9%) were adults, while the rest were children. The patients were treated at the primary care health service section of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University/S\u00e3o Paulo University Hospital in ambulatory or specific units and the emergency room. Each of these specific health services had a variable flow of sampling to respiratory viruses diagnoses, which resulted in collections of different patient groups in this study. Hence, the subjects groups were unevenly distributed throughout the study. The distribution of the studied years and clinical specimens by studied patients is shown in Table 1.\n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: clinical diagnosis of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) defined by the presence of fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one constitutional symptom (headache, myalgia, sweat, or chills); clinical diagnosis of ARI, defined by the presence of respiratory symptoms that did not fulfill the definition of ILI; hospitalized patients suspected of 2009 H1N1 influenza A infection presenting fever >38\u00b0C, cough, and dyspnea. Lower respiratory tract illness was defined as having suggestive clinical findings and one of the following: chest radiograph revealing possible or definite infiltrates, mechanical ventilation requirement, or supplemental oxygen requirement.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical data from outpatients were obtained using a standardized questionnaire, while data from hospitalized patients were extracted from medical charts using a standardized form. Age, gender, occupation, presence of underlying conditions or diseases, and clinical findings at first attendance (for outpatients) or during the first 24 hours (for hospitalized patients) were recorded for analysis. The number of days between admission and a positive CoV sampling, as well as the total length of respiratory illness, was evaluated for evidence of nosocomial acquisition. Institutional review board approval was received before we reviewed any records. The Ethics Committee of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University (CEP 1968/09) approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all patients or those responsible for the individual patient.\n\nViral genomic RNA was extracted from the collected specimens with a QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A previously described pan\u2010CoV RT\u2010PCR assay29 with minor modifications (from 50 amplification cycles to 40 and melting temperature from 48 to 50\u00b0C) was performed as a screening step to detect human and animal CoVs in the samples. The amplification of a 251\u2010bp fragment of the polymerase gene was carried out using the following primer set: Cor\u2010FW (5\u2032\u2010ACWCARHTVAAYYTNAARTAYGC\u20103\u2032) and Cor\u2010RV (5\u2032\u2010TCRCAYTTDGGRTARTCCCA\u20103\u2032). These one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR assays (OneStep RT\u2010PCR kit; Qiagen) were undertaken in a 50\u2010\u03bcl reaction volume containing 10 \u03bcl RNA extract, 10 \u03bcl 5 \u00d7  Qiagen OneStep RT\u2010PCR Buffer, 2 \u03bcL dNTP mix (final concentration of 400 \u03bcm of each dNTP), 1.8 \u03bcl Qiagen OneStep RT\u2010PCR Enzyme Mix (a combination of Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase and HotStarTaq DNA polymerase), 4 \u03bcm of each primer, and RNase\u2010free water. Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR experiment. The reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 40 cycles of amplification (30 seconds at 94\u00b0C; 30 seconds at 50\u00b0C; 1 minutes at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes in a Veriti thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR products were verified on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The sensitivity of the assay was assessed by testing 10\u2010fold dilutions of HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA standard curve, which showed sensitivity of 5 \u00d7 105 RNA copies/\u03bcl. The specificity was assessed by testing controls of other respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, bocavirus, human parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) through the methods for HCoVs detection. There was no amplification of the non\u2010HCoV controls through the method used for CoVs detection.\n\nPositive samples on the pan\u2010CoV RT\u2010PCR assay were tested to identify the HCoV species OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 using a previously described real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR panel consisting of four different HCoV monoplex assays run under identical amplification conditions. Reaction mixtures were prepared using the AgPath\u2010ID\u2122 One\u2010Step RT\u2010PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions (25 \u03bcl) contained 2 \u00d7  RT\u2010PCR buffer, 25 \u00d7  RT\u2010PCR enzyme mix, primers, probe, nuclease\u2010free water, and nucleic acid. Amplification was performed on a 7500 Standard Real\u2010Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycling conditions: 48\u00b0C for 10 minutes (1 cycle); 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes (1 cycle); and 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds followed by 55\u00b0C for 1 minutes (45 cycles). Each specimen was also tested for the human ribonuclease P gene to measure nucleic acid integrity.30 The sensitivity of the assay was assessed by testing 10\u2010fold dilutions of each HCoVs RNA standard curve, which showed sensitivity of 5 \u00d7 102 copies/\u03bcl for HCoV\u2010OC43, 5 \u00d7 104 copies/\u03bcl for HCoV\u2010229E, 5 \u00d7 103 copies/\u03bcl for HCoV\u2010NL63, and 5 \u00d7 103 copies/\u03bcl for HCoV\u2010HKU1. The specificity was assessed as described in the Pan\u2010CoV assay.\n\nStatistical analysis consisted of Pearson's \u03c72 test for the comparison of categorical values, with a significance level of P < 0.05. Non\u2010conditional logistic regression was used to identify associations between CoV positivity and the studied populations. All reported values were two\u2010tailed. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P values. All data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis Software, version 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\nThe pan\u2010CoV assay detected 128/1137 (11.2%) CoV\u2010positive samples, and the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR panel identified 88 HCoV of the 128 (68.7%) screened samples. The most frequently detected HCoV species were NL63 (50.0%) and OC43 (27.3%). The 229E and HKU1 species were detected in 17.0 and 5.7% of the samples, respectively. The CoV infection among the studied settings was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. When compared with the hospitalized, significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed among all subsets, except in children from the community (P = 0.3076) and asymptomatics (P = 0.9879; Table 2). Patients with comorbidities presented the highest risk of acquiring CoV infection (OR = 4.17; 95% CI 1.9\u20139.3; P = <0.05) when compared with the other subsets. Children with heart diseases and renal transplant patients had the next highest rates of CoV infections after the comorbidities group, tallying 17.3 and 12.2%, respectively. An important rate of detection was also found among healthcare workers (10.5%) and patients in stem cell transplantation programs (10.5%). No HCoV infection was found among asymptomatic patients. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of HCoV species among the positive cases based on the studied patient subsets. HCoV\u2010NL63 was the species most frequently associated with children, both from the community (100%) and presenting heart diseases (50%), while there was a high rate of HCoV\u2010229E detection among renal transplant patients (44%). Patients in stem cell transplantation programs were more frequently infected with HCoV species OC43 (47%) and NL63 (42%) when compared with the other HCoV species. HCoV\u2010NL63 was not detected among adults from the community, and HCoV\u2010HKU1 was detected only among adults, healthcare workers, and children with heart diseases.\n\nCoronaviruses were most frequently detected during winter and autumn (75%) (Figure 2). Peak detection frequency was observed in the years 2001, 2004\u20132005, and 2008, with the highest rate of detection recorded in 2005 (8/42; 19%). There were additional longer\u2010term differences in detection frequencies between seasons, with HCoV\u2010229E being predominant in 2004 (61.5%) and HCoV\u2010NL63 (70.8%) in 2008.\n\nHCoV\u2010OC43 was detected in all studied years (except in 2006, when no CoV cases were detected) from March to November (autumn to spring), with detection frequencies peaking in August (winter). Interseason HCoV\u2010OC43 detection frequencies were more consistent than that for the other CoVs.\n\nHCoV\u2010HKU1 was detected only in July (winter) of 2001, 2005, and 2008. A decrease in HCoV\u2010OC43 detection was observed during the period of HCoV\u2010HKU1 detection.\n\nHCoV\u2010229E displayed a marked autumn seasonality (between March and April), with the highest rate of detection recorded in May (autumn) in 2002, 2004\u20132005, and 2008\u20132010.\n\nHCoV\u2010NL63 was the most frequently detected species in the study, circulating in all seasons. Although the NL63 species presented a high frequency of detection in July (winter), it was a unique HCoV species with cases also being detected in the summer.\n\nThe median age of HCoV\u2010infected patients was 28 years (range, 1 month to 68 years). The frequency was higher in patients aged 50\u201359 years (15.9%). Figure 3 depicts the distribution of CoV\u2010infected cases by age. Predominantly, infected patients were female (60 \u00d7 28, P < 0.001). Sixteen percent (16/88) of the infected patients reported underlying conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T\u2010cell leukemia virus (HTLV)\u2010type infection, diabetes mellitus, liver transplant, megacolon syndrome, hypertension, Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome, and congenital kidney and lung diseases. In addition, four patients were born prematurely and seven were smokers.\n\nClinical data were available for all 88 HCoV\u2010infected patients (Table 3). Coryza, cough, and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation, being reported in 86%, 77%, and 51% of positive cases, respectively. There were differences in clinical expression among the studied populations. Fever was found less frequently among renal transplant patients and patients in stem cell transplantation programs when compared with the other patient subsets. Cyanosis was observed among children with heart disease, and wheezing was reported among hospitalized patients, children from the community, and children with heart diseases. Dyspnea, another lower respiratory tract infection symptom other than wheezing, was documented among patients in stem cell transplantation programs, children with heart diseases, children from the community, and hospitalized patients. Healthcare workers presented more cases of sore throat and myalgia than did adults from the community group, patients under transplantation program, and hospitalized patients. Differences in clinical presentation were observed among each HCoV species infection (Figure 4). Patients infected with HCoV\u2010HKU1 presented more fever, coryza, and myalgia when compared with the other HCoV\u2010infected cases (P < 0.05). Dyspnea was more frequently associated with patients infected with HCoV\u2010229E (66.6%). Cyanosis was reported only among patients infected with HCoV\u2010OC43, and diarrhea was reported only in HCoV\u2010NL63 cases.\n\nThe median time for hospitalized CoV\u2010infected patients to be discharged was 12 days (range, 5\u201330 days); of the seven hospitalized CoV\u2010infected patients, three were infected with HCoV\u2010NL63, two with HCoV\u2010229E, and the other two with HCoV\u2010OC43. Patients infected with HCoV\u2010OC43 stayed longer in hospital (average, 19 days) than did patients infected with HCoV\u2010NL63 or HCoV\u2010229E. Four hospitalized patients of seven (57.1%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Lower respiratory tract infections were found in 6/7 (85.7%) hospitalized CoV\u2010infected patients. The remaining patient was infected by HCoV\u2010OC43 and presented upper respiratory tract infection. This patient was a nosocomial case documented in a child who had been admitted for an intestinal surgery due to megacolon. Six of the patients had a good outcome, but 1 diabetic adult died of HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010associated pneumonia 9 days after admission.\n\nInvestigations into other respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, influenza A or B, and respiratory syncytial virus) were available in 87 of 88 CoV\u2010infected cases, in which at least 1 respiratory virus other than CoV was detected in 26 samples (29.8%). Rhinovirus (46.1%) and adenovirus (26.9%) were the most frequently codetected viruses in CoV\u2010positive cases. HCoV\u2010NL63 was associated most frequently with coinfection (57.7%), followed by HCoV\u2010229E (23.1%) and HCoV\u2010OC43 (19.2%). There was no codetection of HCoV\u2010HKU1 with other respiratory viruses. The most common associations were HCoV\u2010NL63 plus adenovirus (46.1%) and HCoV\u2010NL63 plus rhinovirus (38.5%). The methods used for detecting the coinfections were conventional RT\u2010PCR (for rhinovirus, bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus detection) and direct immunofluorescence (adenovirus, influenza A or B, and respiratory syncytial virus detection).\n\nSince the emergence of SARS\u2010CoV, numerous studies have been carried out on the clinical impact of different HCoV species.8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32 However, the majority of these studies were only performed in children, with small sample sizes and short sample collection periods. This is the first study reporting on the epidemiological and clinical features of non\u2010SARS HCoV infections among different clinical patient subsets, both adult and child, over a 9\u2010year period.\n\nHuman coronaviruses were detected among all studied subjects presenting respiratory tract illnesses, but not among those who were asymptomatic. Recently, studies have demonstrated HCoV detection among asymptomatic patients, with a positive rate of approximately 4\u20137%.33, 34 In contrast to our study, the evaluated asymptomatic patients from those reports were children, and we hypothesize that asymptomatic respiratory infection may be more frequent among children than in adults.\n\nAn important CoV detection rate was found among the subset of patients with comorbidities, being most frequent in children with heart diseases and in renal transplant patients. Additionally, underlying conditions other than cardiac disease/transplantation were observed in 18% of CoV\u2010infected patients. These data point to the relevance of CoVs causing respiratory tract illness in patients with comorbidities. Some reports have demonstrated a correlation between CoV\u2010induced respiratory tract illness and populations with comorbidities.22, 35, 36, 37\n\n\nIn spite of there being a lower HCoV detection rate in the hospitalized subset, the majority of positive cases presented with lower respiratory tract infections, and one fatal case was documented. This result supports the premise that HCoV infection may cause more than mild respiratory tract disease.\n\nA significant frequency of HCoVs among healthcare workers was also documented. Previous studies have demonstrated the important burden of healthcare workers associated with respiratory tract infections, as well as their being strongly implicated in HCoV outbreaks.20, 25, 38, 39, 40\n\n\nAlthough HCoV is considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract infections in children, the present study revealed a higher rate of detection among adults in the 50\u2010 to 59\u2010year range. As our study cohort contained a significant number of adult patients with comorbidities, this result can represent a bias.\n\nAs different age groups were tested for HCoV infections in different years in our study, this represents a flaw in the study design which prevents us from comparing the frequency of infection in one age group to another, and it is considered as the major limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the results of our study showed interesting findings on HCoVs infection, which means that HCoVs may be the causal agents of respiratory diseases among patients under different clinical conditions, either adults or children.\n\nOur data revealed that NL63 and OC43 were the most commonly detected HCoV species in our study. Recently, Dijkman et al.41 demonstrated that HCoV\u2010OC43 and HCoV\u2010NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV\u2010HKU1 and HCoV\u2010229E infection, respectively, which would explain why HCoV\u2010OC43 and HCoV\u2010NL63 are the most frequently infecting HCoVs. Other studies have demonstrated a higher frequency of HCoV\u2010NL63 among children12, 32, 42 and HCoV\u2010OC43 among adults.43\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to verify the periodicity of HCoVs infection in the presented data of this study, that is, HCoV\u2010HKU1 (Figure 2), our study focuses on HCoV\u2010type specificity frequency in particular patient groups. In this regard, HCoV\u2010229E was mainly associated with renal transplant patients and HCoV\u2010NL63 was involved in a death. HCoV\u2010229E has previously been associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals,37, 44 and some reports have demonstrated the further association of HCoV\u2010NL63 with fatal cases.22, 23, 24 However, there are no consistent indications that infection by one HCoV is more pathogenic than that with another. Thus, our data provide evidence that the detection and diagnosis of HCoV infections should be considered for immunocompromised individuals with respiratory tract symptoms.\n\nCoronaviruses display the marked seasonality typical of other respiratory viruses, with high detection frequencies in the winter months but few or no detections in the summer. The climate of the city of Sao Paulo (Southeast of Brazil) is under constant influence of both the southern coast and the northern part of the state, which presents a subtropical climate. Thus, this city has an uncharacterized climate marked by a wide thermal and meteorological variety. In this regard, it is not possible for us to trace any interaction between climatic and meteorological factors and HCoVs detection. However, due to the long\u2010term HCoV surveillance performed in the present study, it was possible to demonstrate particular trends concerning CoV species seasonality, where different marked peaks of detection were observed for each HCoV species during the 9\u2010year study. Other studies have demonstrated differences between CoV species seasonalities and a winter preference. van der Hoek et al.45 performed a study on HCoV\u2010NL63 revealing that this species infection follows a 2\u2010year interepidemic period with peaks of infection in the winters. Gaunt et al.28 in a study carried out over a period of 3 years in the UK demonstrated a high detection of HCoVs species during winter months.\n\nOur study showed a very low HCoVs detection rate in 2007 and none in 2006. These were the years that presented the lowest number of samples included in the study, and we believe this might have influenced the HCoVs detection during these 2 years.\n\nDifferent clinical specimens were used in search of HCoVs. Although some studies have shown the sensitivity of different kinds of specimens for respiratory viruses diagnosis through many different detection methods, we did not evaluate data on HCoVs detection from the different specimens collected using the molecular methods applied in our study.\n\nIn conclusion, our data provide a novel insight into the epidemiology and clinical knowledge of HCoV among different subsets of patients, supporting the notion that HCoVs play an important role among patients with comorbidities. HCoV infections were found not only in children, but also among adults, mainly in healthcare workers. Therefore, HCoVs are important pathogens involved in unexplained respiratory illness among patients with different clinical patterns.\n\nWe would like to thank Dr Luis Vicente Ribeiro Ferreira da Silva Filho for providing the HCoV\u2010NL63 control and Dr Edison Luiz Durigon for providing the HCoV\u2010HKU1 control.
