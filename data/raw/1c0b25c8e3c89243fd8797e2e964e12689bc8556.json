{"title": "50-valent inactivated rhinovirus vaccine is broadly immunogenic in rhesus macaques", "body": "HRV causes respiratory illness in billions of people annually, a socioeconomic burden 1 . 33 HRV also causes pneumonia hospitalizations in children and adults and exacerbations of asthma 34 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 2 . HRV was found to be the second leading 35 cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in US children, second only 36 to respiratory syncytial virus, and the most common pathogen associated with pneumonia 37 hospitalization in US adults 3,4 . A vaccine for HRV could alleviate serious disease in asthma and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a correlate of protection, and estimated duration of 41 immunity 5-11 . Trials with monovalent HRV vaccine demonstrated that protection from 42 homologous challenge and disease can be achieved with formalin-inactivated virus given 43 intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) 8,10,11 . Humoral immunity to heterologous virus types 44 was not observed, though cross-reactive CD8 T cells can promote clearance 12, 13 . Limited cross- 45 neutralizing Abs can be induced by hyper-immunization in animals 14, 15 . The possibility of a 46 vaccine composed of 50, 100, or more distinct HRV antigens has been viewed as formidable or The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Although the nAb titer 65 required for protection is not defined, early studies established inactivated HRV as protective in 66 humans, and immunogenicity in animals informed clinical testing.\n\nResults and discussion 69 We first used BALB/c mice to test immunogenicity. We propagated HRVs in H1-HeLa 70 cells and inactivated infectivity using formalin. Sera from na\u00efve mice had no detectable nAb 71 against HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . Alum adjuvant enhanced the nAb response induced by i.m. inactivated 72 HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . There was no effect of valency (comparing 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-valent) on the 73 nAb response induced by inactivated HRV-16 or to the 3 types in the 3-valent vaccine (HRV-16, 74 HRV-36, and HRV-78) (Fig. 1) . The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) titers of the 75 input viruses prior to inactivation (inactivated-TCID 50 ) are provided in Supplemental Table 1 . 76 Original antigenic sin can occur when sequential exposure to related virus variants results in 77 biased immunity to the type encountered first 32 . In bivalent HRV-immune mice, we observed 78 modest original antigenic sin following prime vaccination with 10-valent inactivated HRV, and 79 boost vaccination partially alleviated the effect (Supplemental Fig. 1) , similar to influenza 80 virus 32 . Collectively, these results prompted us to explore more fully the nAb response to 81 polyvalent HRV vaccine.\n\nIn 1975, it was reported that two different 10-valent inactivated HRV preparations 83 induced nAb titers to only 30-40% of the input virus types in recipient subjects 33 . However, the 84 input titers of viruses prior to inactivation ranged from 10 1.5 to 10 5.5 TCID 50 per ml, and these 85 were then diluted 10-fold to generate 10-valent 1.0 ml doses given i.m. as prime and boost with 86 .

We reconstituted the 1975 10-valent vaccine, as closely 88 as possible with available HRV types, over a 10 1 to 10 5 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose, and 89 we compared it to a 10-valent vaccine of the same types with input titers ranging from > 10 5 to > 90 10 7 inactivated-TCID 50 per dose. The reconstituted 1975 vaccine resulted in no detectable nAb 91 after prime vaccination and, following boost vaccination, nAb to the five types that had the 92 highest input titers (Fig. 2) . The high titer vaccine resulted in nAb to 5 of 10 types after prime 93 vaccination and all 10 types after the boost (Fig. 2) . Following the boost vaccinations, there 94 appeared to be a 10 4 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose threshold for the induction of nAb in 95 this model (Fig. 2b) . Above this titer, there was no correlation between input load and nAb Table 2 ) to accommodate the volume adjustment. The 10-valent inactivated 102 HRV vaccine induced nAb to 100% of input types following the prime and the boost (Fig. 3a) . 103 The nAb induced by 10-valent inactivated HRV were persisting at 203 days post-boost 104 (Supplemental Fig. 2) . The 25-valent inactivated HRV prime vaccination induced nAb to 18 of 105 25 (72%) virus types, and the 25-valent boost resulted in nAb against 24 of the 25 types (96%) 106 (Fig 3b) . The average nAb titer resulting from prime + boost was 2 7 for 10-valent and 2 6.8 for 25-107 valent. The data demonstrate broad neutralization of diverse HRV types with a straightforward 108 vaccine approach.\n\nIn order to increase vaccine valency, we chose rhesus macaques (RMs) and a 1.0 ml i.m. Table 3 ). The 25-valent 114 vaccine induced nAb to 96% (RM A) and 100% (RM B) of input viruses following the prime 115 vaccination (Fig. 4a) . The 50-valent vaccine induced nAb to 90% (RM C) and 82% (RM D) of 116 input viruses following the prime vaccination (Fig. 4c) . The breadth of nAb following prime 117 vaccination in RM was superior to what we observed in mice, which may have been due to 118 animal species differences and/or higher inactivated-TCID 50 input titers in the RM vaccines.\n\nFollowing boost vaccination, there were serum nAb titers against 100% of the types in 25-valent 120 HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4b) and 98% (49 out of 50) of the virus types in 50-valent HRV-121 vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4d) . The average nAb titer resulting from prime + boost in RMs was 2 9.3 122 for 25-valent and 2 8.6 for 50-valent. The nAb responses were type-specific, not cross- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

As proof of principle, we purified three HRV types by high 134 performance liquid chromatography and found uncompromised immunogenicity of trivalent 135 inactivated purified HRV in mice (Supplemental Fig. 5) . 136 Forty years ago, the prospects for a polyvalent HRV vaccine were dour for good Advancing valency may be applicable to vaccines for other antigenically variable pathogens.
