{"title": "", "body": "1 GAmOINTESIINIl . . . . .\n\nDamage to a salivary duct or gland which results in leakage of saliva into the surrounding tissues results in the formation of a salivary mucocele or sialocele. The trauma may be blunt trauma or penetration by a foreign body. A ranula is a sublingual mucocele. The sublingual and mandibular salivary glands are the most commonly involved.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe swelling in the cervical area, loss of appetite. difficulty swallowing, blood-tinged saliva. or difficulty in breathing. Physicalexam-A nonpainful, soft. fluctuant mass may be observed in the cervical area, orbital area, or sublingual area. The animal may exhibit abnormal movements of the tongue. dyspnea, or dysphagia. Aseptic aspiration of the swelling with an 18-to 20-gauge needle and syringe yields a clear. gray. honey-colored or blood-tinged, thick, sticky, and stringy fluid-like saliva.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Abscess, neoplasia, rattlesnake bite, spider bite, insect bite. scorpion sting. localized inflammatory reaction, seroma, hematoma, cyst.\n\nAlthough usually not life-threatening. recurrence may happen.\n\nEmergency treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Aseptic aspiration may be indicated if the patient is exhibiting dyspnea or discomfort. 3. Administer oxygen if indicated. 4. Administer anesthesia and perform endotracheal intubation if necessary to establish a patent airway. 5. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics. 6. Recommend the patient be fed a soft diet for one week.\n\nRefer the patient to the daytime veterinarian for surgical removal of the mucocele.\n\nHistory-The owner may have observed the animal chewing on a bone or playing with a ball, coin, wooden stick. needle or pin. or chewing on a foreign object. The animal may have got hold of a fish hook. A piece of a toy may be missing. The owner may observe acute respiratory distress. excessive salivation, difficulty swallowing, agitation including pawing at the mouth. regurgitation, restlessness. lethargy, and anorexia. 133 n I I Esophageal foreign bodies occur more frequently in dogs than in cats, due to the indiscriminate eating habits of dogs.\n\nCaution: Wear examination gloves during the physical examination and avoid contact with the patient's saliva until the diagnosis of rabies is ruled out. The patient may present with an upper airway obstruction if the esophageal foreign body is compressing the trachea. The patient may be cyanotic, have a weak and rapid pulse, and may have increased lung sounds due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient may exhibit agitation by shaking its head or pawing at the mouth. There may be stridor, ptyalism, and persistent gulping. A fishing line may be observed in the mouth. Carefully examine under the base of the tongue, particularly in cats which may have swallowed a linear foreign body.\n\nMost esophageal foreign bodies become trapped at the thoracic inlet, in the heart base area, or in the distal esophagus just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. Radiographs-Of the cervical and thoracic esophagus may reveal the presence of a foreign body or a mass effect in the esophagus. Evaluate for signs of aspiration pneumonia or esophageal tears, pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion. Look for additional gastrointestinal foreign bodies. If contrast radiography is performed, use an iodinated compound rather than barium. Laboratory evaluation-A CBC should be evaluated. If the patient is to undergo sedation or anesthesia, the appropriate pre-anesthetic blood screening should be performed.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Rabies, dysfunction of cranial nerves IXand X, trigeminal neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, periodontal disease, stomatitis, tracheal or oropharyngeal foreign body, esophageal mass, esophageal stricture, mediastinal mass, or insect bite to the oropharyngeal region.\n\nThe prognosis varies from good to poor, depending upon the foreign body, duration of obstruction, severity of obstruction, location, surrounding tissue damage including esophageal perforation, and associated problems such as aspiration pneumonia and mediastinitis. Treatment 1. Inform the client ofthe diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. If the situation is critical due to airway obstruction, quickly obtain the owner's permission for sedation, an attempt at foreign body removal or tracheostomy tube placement. 2. Sedation may be necessary \u2022. Acepromazine, 0.05 mg/kg IV; ketamine and diazepam, or isoflurane should be administered. b. Place the patient in left lateral recumbency.\n\na. The Heimlich maneuver may be beneficial. It may be possible to manipulate the mass towards the mouth by applying pressure rostrally with one hand around the ventral aspect of the neck caudal to the foreign body, while inserting the other hand into the mouth and grasping the foreign body with the other hand. Racquetballs sometimes need to be cut while in place and then grasped with sponge forceps. 4. If removal is not successful and the patient is in a state of severe respiratory distress due to tracheal compression, perform a tracheostomy. 134 5. lfthe object has sharp edges, is pointed, or is causing the patient distress, seda-tion and endoscopic removal of the foreign body within 4-6 h of presentation should be attempted, unless signs of esophageal perforation are present 8. General anesthesia should be administered. b. Place the patient in left lateral recumbency. c. Place an endotracheal tube. d. Caution: Insufflation of air into a perforated esophagus during endoscopy can result in acute respiratory distress and death. e. Gentle manipulation of the foreign body is important to avoid further esophageal trauma. L If possible, remove pointed or sharp objects with the sharp end exiting the oral cavity last. I. After the foreign body has been removed, evaluate the esophageal mucosa for erosion, ulceration, and perforation. 8. If the esophageal foreign body is not pointed, does not have sharp edges, and is not causing patient distress, removal is not a true emergency procedure and can be delayed until the availability of adequate equipment and personnel can be arranged. 1. Removal of fish hooks 8. Ifthe hook is free within the lumen of the esophagus, grasp the point or curve, with the point facing caudally,and gently retract the hook through the mouth. b. If the hook is superficially embedded in the submucosa or mucosa of the esophageal wall but the point of the hook is observed penetrating into the lumen of the esophagus, grasp the point and pull the entire hook through the esophageal wall. Once it is freed from the wall, retract the hook through the mouth.\n\nc. If fishing line is attached to the hook, a deep esophageal laceration or perforation may result from pulling the hook through the esophageal wall. This procedure should be avoided. II. If the point appears to be embedded in the mucosa or submucosa but is not visible, it can be pulled gently out. Asuperficial tear will result, but will usually heal without complications. 8. In some cases, it is best to attempt to push the esophageal foreign body gently into the stomach and then perform a gastrotomy rather than an esophagotomy. 9. Followingesophageal endoscopy, survey thoracic radiographs should be evaluated for signs of esophageal perforation including pneumomediastinum. 10 . Surgery of the esophagus should be performed if there are signs of esophageal perforation or the foreign body cannot be removed or dislodged into the stomach. 11. Ifthe esophageal damage is mild, withhold water for 12 h and food for 24 h. Feed soft food for 3-5 days. 12. If the esophageal damage is moderate 8. Withhold food for 3-5 days, and then feed soft food for 3-5 days. b. Place a gastrotomy tube. c. Administer corticosteroids to decrease fibrous tissue production and prevent stricture formation. II. Administer antibiotics (cephalosporins, amoxicillin, ampicillin). 8. Administer metoclopramide, 0.2-0.4 mg/kg q8h, or cisapride, 0.5 mg/kg q8h. I. Administer sucralfate suspension or dissolved in water, 0.5-1 gPO q6-8h. I. Administer lidocaine gel if needed for esophageal pain or discomfort. 13. If the esophageal damage is severe 8. Withhold food for 5-10 days. b. Place a gastrotomy tube. II I I .. Administer lidocaine gel if needed for esophageal pain or discomfort. II. Repeat thoracic radiographs immediately, 12 hand 24 h after foreign body removal to evaluate for signs of perforation. I. Endoscopically reevaluate the esophagus in 3-5 days. 14. If pleural effusion is observed on the thoracic radiographs, thoracocentesis and fluid analysis, including culture, should be performed. A thoracotomy should be performed as soon as the animal is stabilized. \n\n9.\n\nPlace an intravenous catheter and obtain blood and urine samples. Administer high-volume intravenous fluid therapy with a balanced electrolyte solution such as LRS, PlasmaLyte or Normosol-R to prevent stasis and organ ischemia \u2022. Dogs: 90-100 ml/kg the first one to two hours IV, then re-evaluate. b. Cats: 4S-60 ml/kg first one to two hours.\n\nc. After the first one to two hours, re-evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.\n\nGenerally decrease the rate to 20-40 mllkg/h in dogs and 20-30 mllkg/h in cats until the patient is stabilized. Continue at 10-20 ml/kg/h to maintain perfusion. Fluid rate requirements may range from 2 to 7 times normal maintenance rates. II. Monitor for fluid overload or continued hypotension\n\n\u2022 Monitor blood pressure. Maintain systolic pressure above 90 mmHg and mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. \u2022 Monitor central venous pressure (maintain between 8 to 10 cm of water). \u2022 Monitor urine output (minimum should be 1-2 ml/kg/h). Administration of 7.S%hypertonic saline, 4 ml/kg IV, will help to achieve peracute volume resuscitation, but should be followed by,or accompanied by,either crystalloid fluid therapy or crystalloid and colloid fluid therapy. Administer colloid therapy to improve perfusion and expansion of the vascular space while avoiding peripheral edema \u2022. Hetastarch\n\n\u2022 Dogs: administer a 20 mllkg IVbolus, possibly followed by an additional 20 ml/kg IVover 4-6 h daily for at least 3 days. \u2022 Cats: administer a 1001S mllkg IVbolus, possibly followed by an additional lO-IS ml/kg IVover 4-6 h daily as needed. \u2022 Reduce the crystalloid fluid volume administered by 40-60%. b o Administer clindamycin, 10 mg/kg ql2h or 11 mg/kg q8h IV, and enrofloxacin, 5-10 mg/kg ql2h IVor 5-20 mg/kg q24h IV \u2022 Only administer enrofloxacin at the dose of 10-20 mg/kg twice then decrease the dose, as seizures may occur with high doses. \u2022 Avoid the use of enrofloxacin in all puppies under 8 months of age and in giant breed puppies under 18 months of age. II Administer a combination of ampicillin (20-40 mg/kg q8h IV), or a firstgeneration cephalosporin (cefazolin (20 mg/kg q8h IV) or cephalothin (20-30 mg/kg q6h IV)), with a fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin 5-10 mg/kg ql Zh, IV or 5-20 mg/kg q24h IV, ciprofloxacin (5-15 mg/kg ql2h PO or 5-20 mg/kg q24h PO)), and an aminoglycoside (amikacin (3.5-5 mg/kg q8h IV or 10-15 mg/kg q24h IV), gentamicin (6-9 mg/kg/24h IV or 2-3 mg/kg q8h IV), or tobramycin (2-4 mg/kg q8h IV)), or a thirdgeneration cephalosporin (ceftizoxime (25-50 mg/kg Iv, 1M, SC q6-8h) , cefotaxime (20-80 mg/kg IV, 1Mq6-8h)) \u2022 The penicillins have been combined with a~-lactamase inhibitor (ticarcillin-clavulanate (Timentine) 30-50 mg/kg q6-8h IV, ampicillinsublactam (Unasyne) 50 mg/kg q6-8h Iv, and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn\", dose = 50 mg/kg Iv, 1Mq4-6h) for increased efficacy. \u2022 Aminoglycosides should be avoided in the presence of dehydration or azotemia as they may cause renal failure. \u2022 Aminoglycosides administered once every 24 h are more effective and cause less renal toxicity. \u2022 If furosemide is utilized, aminoglycosides should be discontinued, as the combination increases the risk of inducing iatrogenic renal failure. \u2022 When the patient is on aminoglycosides, urine sediment should be evaluated at least daily for casts and cellular debris. \u2022 If an anaerobic infection is suspected, add either metronidazole (10 mg/kg IVCRIover I h, q8-12h), clindamycin, cefoxitin, or penicillin G to the above combinations. II) Administer imipenem, 2-5 mg/kg IVCRI over I h, q8h\n\n\u2022 Imipenem may cause seizures in young animals.\n\n\u2022 Nausea, diarrhea, and allergic reactions may occur. \u2022 PT, PTT, FSPand D-dimers. .. Urinalysis. 5. Evaluation of peritoneal fluid obtained by abdominocentesis or diagnostic peritoneallavage e. Measure the creatinine level of the peritoneal fluid and compare it to the patient's serum creatinine level. If the peritoneal creatinine level is higher than that of serum, it indicates urine is leaking into the abdominal cavity and exploratory surgery is necessary. b. A bilirubin concentration higher in the peritoneal fluid than in serum indicates the presence ofhepatobiliary or proximal intestinal disease or injury and exploratory surgery is indicated. c. Measure the PCV and TS of the peritoneal fluid and compare it to peripheral blood. If the PCV is greater than 5%, intra-abdominal hemorrhage has occurred. Treat the patient supportively and repeat the peritoneal tap in 30 min. If the PCVhas increased, exploratory surgery is indicated. d. Microscopic examination \u2022 Cytology-Intracellular bacteria in neutophils or a high leukocyte count indicates infection and exploratory surgery is indicated o WBC, greater than 1,000 cells/ul, indicates inflammation or suppuration and exploratory surgery is indicated. II) An increase in neutrophils ($1O,000/mm 3 ) commonly occurs in the lavage fluid of animals without peritonitis that have had recent abdominal surgery. However, these neutrophils should not contain bacteria and should not be degenerate. \u2022 The presence of bacteria indicates bowel rupture has occurred and exploratory surgery is necessary. \u2022 The presence of vegetable matter indicates bowel perforation has occurred and exploratory surgery is required. I D Abdominal radiographs-\u00ab I 1. Survey films may show free fluid or free gas in the peritoneal cavity.Free air may be observed in normal patients for 1-5 weeks following abdominal surgery, so this should be taken into account in postoperative patients with signs of peritonitis. Intraluminal accumulation of gas and generalized intestinal ileus may be observed. 2. Contrast studies 8. Evaluation of the urinary tract utilizing contrast studies may be useful. b. Evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract utilizing contrast studies, with either barium sulfate or hyperosmolar iodinated contrast materials is not recommended \u2022 There is an increased risk for contamination ofthe peritoneal cavity.\n\n\u2022 Both types of contrast agents increase the severity of peritonitis.\n\n\u2022 Ileus causes contrast agents in the stomach to remain there for many hours. \u2022 An early exploratory laparotomy is more revealing and more beneficial to the welfare of the patient. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may reveal previously undetected pockets of fluid accumulation, abscess, neoplastic masses, organomegaly, bile duct obstruction. the presence of calculi, and aid in obtaining samples for culture.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Acute abdominal pain without peritonitis, ascites, SIRS, gastroenteritis.\n\nThe prognosis is generally guarded to poor, but varies depending upon the underlying etiology, the patient's previous health status, early surgical correction, establishment of effective drainage, antibiotic administration, and nutritional and hemodynamic support. The presence of severe shock, coagulation abnormalities, or hypoglycemia indicate a poorer prognosis. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the underlying etiologies, diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Attempt to find and treat the underlying etiology. 3. Anticipation of complications, not reaction to clinical signs, is necessary for patient survival. 4. Administer oxygen supplementation. 5. Place an intravenous catheter and obtain blood and urine samples. 6. Administer high-volume intravenous fluid therapy with a balanced electrolyte solution such as LRS, PlasmaLyte or Normosol-R to prevent stasis and organ ischemia 8. Dogs: 90-100 mllkg for the first one to two hours IV; then re-evaluate. b. Cats: 45-60 mllkg for the first one to two hours. c. Afterthe first one to two hours. re-evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.\n\nGenerally decrease the rate to 20-40 ml/kg/h in dogs and 20-30 mllkg/h in cats until the patient is stabilized. Continue at 10-20 mllkg/h to maintain perfusion. Fluid rate requirements may range from 2 to 7 times normal maintenance rates. II. Monitor for fluid overload or continued hypotension\n\n\u2022 Monitor blood pressure. Maintain systolic pressure above 90 mmHg and mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. \u2022 Monitor central venous pressure (maintain between 8 and 10 em of water). \u2022 Monitor urine output (minimum should be 1-2 ml/kg/h). J.\n\nAdministration of7.5% hypertonic saline, 4-5 ml/kg IVin the dog, 2 ml/kg IVin 144 the cat. will help to achieve peracute volume resuscitation, but should be followed by, or accompanied by, either crystalloid fluid therapy or crystalloid and colloid fluid therapy. 8. Administer colloid therapy, along with crystalloid fluid therapy, to improve perfusion and expansion of the vascular space while avoiding peripheral edema a. Hetastarch \u2022 Dogs: administer a 20 ml/kg IVbolus, followed by an additional 20 mllkg IVover 4-6 h daily for at least 3 days. \u2022 Cats: administer a 10-15 mllkg IV bolus, followed by an additional 10-15 mil kg IVover 4-6 h daily as needed. \u2022 Reduce the crystalloid fluid volume administered by 40-60%. b. Dextran 70 (avoid in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy)\n\n\u2022 Dogs: administer 14-20 mllkg IV.\n\n\u2022 Cats: administer 10-15 mllkg IV. c.

Administer broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy pending culture and sensitivity.\n\n\u2022. Administer a combination of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin (20 mg/kg q8h IV)), with an aminoglycoside (amikacin (3.5-5 mg/kg q8h 1\\1, or 10-15 mg/kg q24h IV), gentamicin (6-9 mg/kg q24h IVor 2-3 mg/kg q8h IV), or tobramycin (2-4 mg/kg q8h IV)), or a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftizoxime (25-50 mg/kg IV, 1M, SC q6-8h), cefotaxime (20-80 mg/kg 1\\1, 1M q6-Hh)) and metronidazole, 10 mg/kg IVCRI over I hr, q8-12h \u2022 Aminoglycosides should be avoided in the presence of dehydration or azotemia as they may cause renal failure. \u2022 Aminoglycosides administered once every 24h are more effective and cause less renal toxicity. \u2022 If furosemide is utilized, aminoglycosides should be discontinued, as the combination increases the risk of inducing iatrogenic renal failure. \u2022 When the patient is on aminoglycosides, urine sediment should be evaluated at least daily for casts and cellular debris. \u2022 The penicillins have been combined with a~lactamase inhibitor (ticarcillin-clavulanate (Tlmentins', 30-50 mg/kg q6-8h IV)), ampicillinsublactam (Unasyn\", 50 mg/kg q6-8h IV), and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn\u00ae, 50 mg/kg IV, 1Mq4-6h) for increased efficacy. b. Administer a combination of cefoxitin, (40 mg/kg IV initially and continued at 20 mg/kg IV q6-8h in the dog and q8h in the cat), and metronidazole, 10 mg/kg IVCRIover I h, q8-12h. 12. The administration of corticosteroids in septic shock is controversial. The recommended medications are methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 15-30 mg/kg 1\\1, and dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 4-6 mg/kg Iv. 13. Perform an exploratory laparotomy or definitive abdominal surgery if the etiology is isolated \u2022. Perform a thorough and symptomatic exploration of the peritoneal cavity. b. Surgically correct any gross abnormality observed.\n\nc. Control leakage from a hollow viscus by debridement and closure, resection or serosal patch application. d. Remove all foreign material, necrotic tissue, and blood clots from the peritoneal cavity. \u2022. Perform peritoneal irrigation with large volumes of warm lavage fluid and remove all lavage fluid from the peritoneal cavity prior to closure. I. Place a gastrotomy tube or jejunostomy tube if indicated. g. If there is severe contamination of the peritoneal cavity or septic peritonitis, consider open peritoneal drainage with incomplete abdominal closure \u2022 Remove the falciform ligament and preperitoneal fat.\n\n\u2022 Place the omentum around the organs that have been surgically repaired and suture it in place to prevent migration. \u2022 With a simple continuous pattern, using monofilament suture, bring the edges of the external rectus fascia to within 2-4 em apart. This 'closure' should run from the xiphoid to about halfway between the umbilicus and the pubis. \u2022 Close the external rectus fascia in the caudal approximately one-third of the laparotomy incision with a separate simple continuous pattern of monofilament suture, irrigate the area well, then close the subcutaneous tissue and skin over the apposed rectus fascia. \u2022 Place sterile pads (absorbent towels, laparotomy pads, cloth diapers) over the cranial two-thirds of the incision to completely cover the open abdomen. \u2022 Secure the sterile pads in place with gauze and tape circumferential bandages, in multiple layers, to absorb fluid. \u2022 Encourage the patient to move about or rest in sternal recumbency to assist drainage. \u2022 Change the bandages as needed when they are soaked and examine the exposed peritoneal cavity during the bandage changes. \u2022 If necrotic tissue or debris is observed, induce general anesthesia. \u2022 Perform exploratory surgery to re-examine the peritoneal cavity. Repair damaged viscera, debride necrotic tissue, and irrigate the peritoneal cavity. \u2022 The abdominal drainage usually decreases by the third or fourth day,when the contamination and necrosis have been controlled. \u2022 The abdomen can be usually be closed by the third to sixth days, when the abdominal bandages are not soaked through after a 24-h period. \u2022 During open abdominal drainage, monitor albumin levels at least daily.\n\nExtensive protein and fluid loss occurs and repeated plasma administration may be necessary. 14. Nutritional support should be initiated within 12 h of presentation \u2022. Provide a minimum of 25%of the patient's protein and energy requirements within the first 12 h. b. Provide a minimum of 75% of the patient's protein and energy requirements within 72-96 h. c. Afterthe patient has been rehydrated, administer a 3.5%amino acid solution with glycerine (Procal Amine\"). The normally recommended dose is 40-45 ml/kg/day. The amino acid solution should make up Y. to~of the patient's maintenance fluid needs and can be administered through a peripheral vein, 'piggy-backed' on the maintenance fluid line. d. The patient can then be eased onto an enteral nutrition program, either orally, through a nasogastric tube, gastrotomy tube, or jejunostomy tube. Oral supplementation with electrolytes, glucose, and glutamine supplementation is available in commercial products including Resorb\" and Vivonex,TEN\u00ae \u2022 For dogs and cats, the package of Vivon ex, TEN\u00ae should be diluted with double the amount of fluid recommended on the package for human consumption. \u2022 The dose is 40-45 ml/kg/ day. \u2022 The first day, administer 33% of the recommended dose, in divided feedings given every 1-2 h. \u2022 The second day, administer 66% of the recommended dose, in divided feedings given every 1-2 h. \u2022 The third day, administer the recommended dose, in divided feedings given every 1-2 h. u 141 n I I 148 I. If vomiting does not occur, a bland diet can be given \u2022 It may be beneficial to administer a liquid diet, such as Clinif'are\", first, to see if the patient can tolerate oral feeding. \u2022 Clink.are\" should initially be diluted to a 50%solution to decrease the incidence of osmotic diarrhea. \u2022 Hills i/d\", or a/d\u00ae, or Eukanuba recovery formula\" are examples of diets that may be considered.

Reviewfluid therapy and provide adequate fluid volume replacement. History-The patient may have recently been fed. The owner may observe repeated unproductive retching, restlessness, abdominal distention, and hypersalivation. The patient may have been found in a state of collapse. Question the owner about any treatment they may have attempted, including orogastric decompression or gastric trocarization. Physical exam-The patient will often present with obvious distention of the abdomen which is tympanic. Abdominal palpation reveals varying degrees of gastric distention and splenomegaly. The patient may retch with an inability to vomit. Often the patient is presented in a state of hypovolemic shock. Occasionally,the only finding is spreading of the forelimbs and hind limbs so as to stretch the abdomen, an enlarged and displaced spleen, or tachycardia. Abdominal radiographs-Take right lateral recumbency and dorsoventral abdominal radiographs. If the patient resists the position for the dorsoventral view, a left lateral view can be utilized in its place. If the stomach is normal, the right WI n I I lateral view will illustrate fluid in the pylorus, and with the left lateral view, the pylorus will contain gas. If a gastric torsion is present, the pylorus will be displaced. Il Complete serum biochemical profile, including ALT, AlkPhos, BUN, creatinine, amylase, and lipase. e. Coagulation profile (ifindicated)-PT, PTT, FSPs and D-dimers.\n\nr. Measure preoperative plasma lactate levels in a heparinized blood sample obtained prior to the administration of intravenous fluids. The normal range of plasma lactate levels in dogs is about 0.3-2.5 mmol/l. Aplasma lactate level >6.0 mmolll has been associated with gastric necrosis and severe systemic hypo perfusion in dogs with gastric dilatation and volvulus. Electrocardiography-Various arrhythmias may be observed, but the most common are premature ventricular contrations (PVCs).\n\nThe prognosis is guarded to grave, depending on the physical status of the patient upon presentation. The mortality rate is reported to be from 33% to 43%. Aplasma lactate level >6.0 mmol/l in dogs with gastric dilatation and volvulus has been associated with gastric necrosis, severe systemic hypoperfusion and a poor IIlIUn 1.2 Premature ventricular contractions on an EeG strip. These are the most common 150 arrhythmias that occur in gastric dilatation and volvulus patients. prognosis for survival (58%), compared to dogs with a plasma lactate level <6.0 mmolll (86-98% survival rate). Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Obtain pretreatment blood samples. 3. Place the largest-diameter possible intravenous catheter, or two intravenous catheters, and administer high-volume intravenous fluid therapy with a balanced electrolyte solution such as LRS, PlasmaLyteor Normosol-R to prevent stasis and organ ischemia 8. Dogs: 90-100 ml/kg the first one to two hours IV; then re-evaluate. b. Cats: 45-60 ml/kg first one to two hours. c. Afterthe first one to two hours, re-evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.\n\nGenerally decrease the rate to 20-40 ml/kg/h in dogs and 20-30 ml/kg/h in cats until the patient is stabilized. Continue at 10-20 ml/kg/h to maintain perfusion. Fluid rate requirements may range from 2 to 7 times normal maintenance rates. d. Monitor for fluid overload or continued hypotension\n\n\u2022 Monitor blood pressure. Maintain systolic pressure above 90 mmHg and mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. \u2022 Monitor central venous pressure (maintain between 8 and 10 cm of water). \u2022 Monitor urine output (minimum should be 1-2 mllkg/h). 4. Consider the administration of Dextran 70 or Hetastarch, 14-20 mllkg IV bolus. 5. Consider the administration of7.5% NaClIV; 4-5 mllkg in dogs, 2 ml/kg in cats, over 2-5 minutes if the patient is in severe hypovolemic shock and there is no indication of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Hypertonic saline in Dextran 70 (HSD) may also be administered to contribute to rapid volume restoration in the treatment of hypovolemic shock. 6. The administration of glucocorticoids for shock is considered controversial, but is recommended prior to trocarization and derotation of the stomach. If desired, administer methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 15-30 mg/kg IV, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 2-4 mg/kg IV; or prednisolone sodium succinate, 20 mg/kg rv 1. Administer analgesics, which also act as premedication agents for anesthesia. 8. Take abdominal radiographs after initiating intravenous fluid therapy, unless euthanasia is an option being more heavily considered by the owner than surgery. 9. Pass the largest-diameter stomach tube possible and lavage the stomach. 10. If orogastric tubing is unsuccessful, clip and prepare an area caudal to the right 13th rib and trocarize the stomach with one or two 18-or 20-GAneedles. 11. Reattempt orogastric tubing, sedation with oxymorphone and diazepam may be necessary. 12. Recommend and perform surgery as soon as possible if the stomach is distended. A distended stomach causes up to a 75%reduction in arterial flow to the gastric mucosa and is a surgical emergency. Do not waste time trying to differentiate volvulus from simple bloat as volvulus is an extension ofthe clinical progression of bloat. Abloated stomach causes significant vascular compromise to the gastric mucosa and adversely affects systemic circulation. 13. Administer preoperative antibiotics, ampicillin, 20-40 mg/kg IVq6-8h, cefoxitin, 40 mg/kg IVinitially and continued at 20 mg/kg IVq6-8h in the dog and q8h in the cat, or cefazolin, 20 mg/kg IV q6-8h combined with enrofloxacin 5-20 mg/kg IVq24h. 14. Monitor the ECG. If any arrhythmias are observed, administer oxygen supplementation. 15. Preanesthetic medications are usually not necessary, due to tachycardia and depression of the patient. Avoid phenothiazine derivatives. Do not administer atropine unless bradycardia occurs during induction or under anesthesia. Induce anesthesia with a. Mask induction with isoflurane. Preoxygenate the patient for 5 min first. This technique may result in a greater degree of hypotension, vasodilation. and myocardial depression than induction with one of the following methods. b. Diazepam. 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IV, and ketamine, 10 mg/kg IV, titrated to effect. &. Oxymorphone, 0.2 mg/kg IV, and diazepam. 0.2 mg/kg IV, titrated to effect. d. Fentanyl. 0.02 mg/kg IV, and diazepam. 0.2 mg/kg IV, titrated to effect. 8. Place an endotracheal tube.\n\nr. Place an orogastric tube as soon as possible after induction to decrease the risk of gastric reflux and aspiration. Maintain anesthesia with isoflurane and oxygen-no nitrous! a. Supplement with either oxymorphone, 0.0!M>.2 mg/kg IV, or fentanyl, 5 Ilg/kg IVas needed. b. Positive-pressure ventilation is often needed. &. Fluid administration needs often exceed 10 ml/kg/h. II. Administer dopamine. 51lg/kg/min IV, if a positive inotropic drug is needed. 18. Surgery a. Make a long midline incision beginning at the xiphoid process. b. If the stomach is grosslydistended, pass an orogastric tube, or perform needle decompression. c. Reposition the stomach. As the patient lies in dorsal recumbency on the surgery table most GDVs are rotated with the pylorus positioned ventrally and to the left. so one hand is used to press the right side of the dilated stomach down while grasping the pyloric region with the other hand and gently pulling the pyloric region up (ventrally) and to the right. d. Partial gastrectomy may be necessary to remove areas of the stomach that are pale greenish to grayish in color, which result from ischemia or necrosis, or black to blue-black areas which result from venous occlusion and hemorrhage. Areas that are questionable in appearance should be re-evaluated 10-15 min after returning the stomach to normal position. The prognosis following partial gastrectomy is grave, increasing the mortality rate to about 63%.\n\n8. Perform a gastrotomy only if absolutely necessary. to remove large gastric foreign bodies or large quantities of ingesta. fIlIln 1.3 Technique for performing serosal gastropexy.\n\n(a) Illustrates the surgical approach: (b) illustrates the purse-string sutures opposing the circular incisions in the parietal peritoneum and the gastric serosa.\n\nI. Perform a serosal gastropexy. permanent incisional gastropexy, belt-loop gastropexy. or circumcostal gastropexy. Use 2-0 monofilament nonabsorbable suture for the gastropexy. .. Suture the deeper (dorsal-cranial) margins of the gastropexy incision first. 152\n\nh. Evaluate the spleen. Return it to its normal anatomic position and remove it only if necessary due to infarction and thrombosis. Removal of the spleen is associated with an increased mortality rate. I. Evaluate the other abdominal organs quickly, but thoroughly, An enterotomy is occasionally necessary to remove an intestinal foreign body. J. If gastric resection is performed or pancreatic trauma is evident, place a jejunostomy tube. II. Lavage and suction the peritoneal cavity. I. Rapid closure of the linea alba is facilitated by using a simple continuous pattern with a monofilament nonabsorbable or slowlyabsorbable suture such as Prolene or PDS \u2022 0 for animals < 30 lb.\n\n\u2022 1 for animals 31-80 lb.\n\n\u2022 2 for animals> 81 lb. m. Close the subcutaneous tissue and skin with continuous patterns, consider using staples in the skin to further decrease the surgical time. 19. Monitor the ECG throughout surgery and for the next 3-4 days postoperatively (every 2-6h as indicated Canine parvovirus (CPV) gastroenteritis is probably the most common and severe viral enteritis causing severe illness in puppies. Many different diseases cause acute gastroenteritis which can all be clinically managed in a similar manner to CPV; since the treatment is symptomatic and supportive.\n\nThe incubation period of canine parvovirus (CPV) is 2-14 days, with most clinical cases occurring 4-7 days after exposure. CPV is most commonly observed in puppies from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. Dog breeds which are reported to be at an increased risk include rottwellers, Doberman pinschers, Labrador retrievers, American pit bull terriers. German shepherds, springer spaniels, and Yorkshireterriers.\n\nActive shedding of the virus in feces generally occurs for about 2 weeks postinoculation, but in rare cases has persisted for one year. Normally, recovered dogs do not transmit disease to their susceptible kennel mates, even when they have lived together for several months. Subclinical infections probably play a significant role in the spread of infection. If conditions are favorable. CPVcan remain infectious for 5 months or more in ground that has been contaminated with fecal material. Physical exam-The patient may present with signs of vomiting and/ or diarrhea and may vomit or have diarrhea in the waiting room or examination room. \u2022. The initial fluid rate if the patient presents in hypovolemic shock is 90-100 mllkg the first one to two hours IV; then re-evaluate. b. After the first one to two hours, re-evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.\n\nGenerally decrease the rate to 20-40 ml/kg/h until the patient is stabilized. Continue at rates as high as 5-10 mllkg/h to maintain perfusion. Fluid rate requirements may range from 2 to 7 times normal maintenance rates (44-66 mllkg/day). Fluids such as Multilyte-M or PlasmaLyte-M may be utilized for maintenance.\n\nc. If the patient has a mild degree of dehydration, replace the deficit over 2-6 h.\n\nThe volume ofthe deficit can be calculated as follows: deficit (in mil = dehydration (%) x body weight (kg). d. Monitor for fluid overload or continued hypotension\n\n\u2022 Monitor blood pressure. Maintain systolic pressure above 90 mmHg and mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg \u2022 Monitor central venous pressure (maintain between 8 and 10 em of water). \u2022 Monitor urine output (minimum should be 1-2 ml/kg/h) and urine specific gravity (which should be 1.015-1.020). 1. Consider the administration of Dextran 70 or Hetastarch, 14-20 ml/kg IVbolus. B. Consider the administration of 7.5% NaC! IV; 4-5 mllkg over 2-5 min if the patient is in severe hypovolemic shock \u2022. Hypertonic saline in Dextran 70 (HSD) may also be administered to contribute to rapid volume restoration in the treatment of hypovolemic shock. b. 7.5% NaCI should not be administered to dehydrated patients or those with increased serum sodium levels. c. All patients that receive 7.5% NaCi should also receive crystalloid fluids either prior to or simultaneously with the administration of7.5% NaC!. 9. Administer antibiotics \u2022. Sodium ampicillin, 20-40 mg/kg IVq6-8h. b. Cefoxitln, 40 mg/kg IVinitially and continued at 20-25 mg/kg q6-8h IV. c. Ticarcillin-clavulonate (Ttrnentine). 30-50 mg/kg q6-8h IV. d. In patients that are well-hydrated. arnoxicillin, 15-30 mg/kg q12h SC or 1M, and amikacin, 3.5-5 mg/kg q8h IVor 10-15 mg/kg q24h IV \u2022 Aminoglycosides should be avoided in the presence of dehydration or azotemia as they may cause renal failure. \u2022 If furosemide is utilized, aminoglycosides should be discontinued, as the combination increases the risk of inducing iatrogenic renal failure. \u2022 When the patient is on aminoglycosides, urine sediment should be evaluated at least daily for casts and cellular debris.\n\n\u2022. Sodium ampicillin, 20-40 mg/kg q6-8h IV. and amikacin, 3.5-5 mg/kg q8h IV or 10-15 mg/kg q24h IV. r. Sodium ampicillin, 20-40 mg/kg q6-8h IV; and ceftizoxime (25-50 mg/kg q6-8h, IV. 1M.SC), or cefotaxime, 20-80 mg/kg q6-8h IV or 1M.\n\nII. If an anaerobic infection is suspected. administer metronidazole, 10 mg/kg IVCRI over Ih, qsh, or clindarnycin, 10 mg/kg q12h IV. in addition to one of the above antibiotic regimens. b. Trimethoprim and sulfadiazine (15-30 mg/kg SC qI2h). I. Enrofloxacin,5 mg/kg q 12h IV; and sodium ampicillin. 20-40 mg/kg q6-8h IV \u2022 Avoid enrofloxacin in young large breed dogs with incomplete closure of epiphyseal growth plates. One study has shown no detrimental effects to the use of enrofloxacin for 3-5 days in young large breed dogs. \u2022 Dilute enrofloxacin 1:1 with saline and administer it slowly intravenously over 15-20 minutes. 10. In patients which exhibit early signs of sepsis or enterotoxemia (fever. tachycardia, muddy or injected mucous membranes. or those with evidence of gastrointestinal barrier breakdown), the administration of a single dose of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 2-4 mg/kg IV, or flunixin meglumine, I mg/kg Iv; may be considered after the initial intravenous fluid bolus is administered. 11. Ifthe patient exhibits excessive, repeated vomiting, or nausea, repeat the physical examination including palpation of the abdomen for an intussusception. Consider the administration of antiemetics, after volume replacement is achieved 8. Chlorpromazine, 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IVq4-6h as needed, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg SC, 1M q6-8h, or I mg/kg diluted in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl and administered rectally q8h via a plastic catheter. b. Prochlorperazine, 0.25-0.5 mg/kg SC, 1M q6-8h. c. Ondanestron (Zofran\"), 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IVq6-12h. d. Metoclopramide (Reglans), 0.2-0.4 mg/kg SC or 1M q8h or 0.01-0.02 mg/kg/h (0.04-0.08 mg/kg/h) CRI IV. If the patient is on metoclopramide, it is very important to palpate the abdomen every 2-4 h and closely monitor for intussusception. Avoid metoclopramide if a mechanical obstruction is suspected, or if the patient has a history of seizures. 8. Butorphanol, 0.2-0.4 mg/kg IV, 1M q2-6h, has been shown to exhibit an antiemetic effect as well as an analgesic effect.\n\nr. Place a nasogastric tube, suction gastric fluid every few hours and reduce the stimulus to vomit. g. Monitor for signs of a gastrointestinal foreign body, intussusception, acute pancreatitis, or reflux esophagitis. Palpate the abdomen every 4 h. 12. Ifhematemesis or signs of nausea (drooling, exaggerated swallowing motions) occur, administer 8. Famotidine (Pepcid\"), 0.5-1 mg/kg IVql2h. b. Ranitidine, 2-5 mg/kg IVor SC q 12h. c. Cimetidine, 5-10 mg/kg IVor 1Mq8-12h. d. If severe hematemesis is present, administer omeprazole (Losecv). 0.2-0.7 mg/kg PO q24h. 8. Sucralfate, 1 g dissolved in 10 ml of water, administer 250-500 mg for a dog < 20 kg PO q6-8h and 1 g PO q6-8h for a dog> 20 kg. I. Consider the administration of an oral therapeutic dose of barium sulfate, 0.25-0.5 ml/lb PO ql2h. 13. Administer medications for the control of abdominal pain as indicated.\n\nButorphanol also has an antiemetic effect. 14. Monitor blood glucose levels, maintain at 100-130 mg/ dl with IVboluses of 25% dextrose (l mllkg) as necessary. Dilute the dextrose solution to 12.5% if the patient is less than 16 weeks of age 8. If the hydration status is normal, consider adding dextrose to the crystalloid intravenous fluid to make a 2.5-5% dextrose solution for CRI. Continue to monitor hydration status. b. Avoid rebound hypoglycemia by tapering the patient off of the dextrose drip. 15. If the patient is severely anemic, rule out concurrent rickettsial or parasitic infections and consider the administration of canine red blood cells, 5-10 mil kg IV over 3-4 h, through a filter. Cross match prior to the administration of RBCs. 16. Evaluate a fecal sample for hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, coccidia, and giardia. Treat accordingly. Consider the administration of an antiparasiticidal agent to all affected puppies, regardless of fecal examination findings 8. Ivermectin, 250 ug/kg SC, can be given to all breeds of dogs except for collies, collie mixed-breed dogs, shelties, Border collies, Australian shepherds, or in dogs with heartworm disease. Use it with caution in Old English sheepdogs. b. Fenbendazole (Panacur\"), 50 mg/kg PO for 3 days. c. Pyrantel (Nemex\"), 5 mg/kg PO, repeat in 7-10 days. 11. Monitor protein losses. Recheck TS and/ or albumin levels at least once a day IJ II I I I. If the TS is < 3.5 mg/ dl, administer Hetastarch or Dextran 70, 14-20 mllkg Iv.\n\nThe beneficial colloidal effects of Hetastarch increase with repeated, serial, daily administration. b. Administer plasma, 5-30 mllkg IVif the albumin level is < 2.0 mg/ dl. Plasma administration is also recommended if the patient is severely neutropenic, immunosuppressed, or exhibiting signs of DIC (in which case it should be heparinized). Administer plasma through a filter and cross match prior to administration. 18. Supplement intravenous fluids with additional potassium depending on the laboratory potassium level or the severity and duration of vomiting (see Table  7 .1). 19. Provide nutritional support I. A partial parenteral nutritional solution, such as Procalarnine\", which contains 3% amino acids, glycerol, and electrolytes, can be administered IV through a peripheral vein and should be administered to puppies that have been anorectic for more than 3 days. b. The dose of Procalaminev is 40-45 rnI/kg/ day, administered at maintenance fluid rates.\n\nc. The Procalamine\" infusion line can be 'piggybacked' into the balanced electrolyte fluid infusion line to ease administration. II. As an alternative to a commercially prepared product, a partial parenteral solution may be prepared by adding 300 mI of an 8.5% amino acid solution to 700 ml ofLRS with 5% dextrose. Lipid emulsion administration is controversial and has been associated with immunosuppression. .. When administering partial parenteral solutions, it is important to aseptically place and maintain the intravenous catheter. Monitor the catheter daily for pain, redness, or swelling. 20. Administer oral glutamine, either in the form of glutamine powder (250 mg/kg ql2h) orVivonexTEN(ii) I. Glutamine is essential for normal enterocyte function and must be absorbed across the intestinal lining to be effective. A lack of glutamine for as few as 3 days will result in microscopic damage to enterocyte function and intestinal integrity. b. Administer VivonexTEN\u00ae PO q1-2h or via CRI through a nasogastric tube. c. The dose of VivonexTfilv\" is 40-45 Kcallkg/day (l Kcal = 1 ml). d. Mix Vivonex TEN\u00ae as a 50% solution by adding 500 ml of water to a single packet rather than 250 ml as stated in the packet instructions. e. Give Yl or 33% of the recommended dose the first day, 'Il or 66% the second day, and the full dose the third and following days, until the puppy resumes 158\n\neating.\n\nI. The administration of Vivon ex TEN\u00ae orally every 1-2 h is recommended, unless emesis is uncontrollable and unrelenting, hematemesis is present, a gastrointestinal obstruction is present, or the patient is so depressed that aspiration pneumonia may occur following emesis. 21. Consider adding Vitamin B complex, 4 ml/l, to intravenous fluids. 22. Consider the administration of antiserum against LPS endotoxin (SEPTI-Serum's) 8. The dose is 2 ml/lb (4.4 ml/kg) diluted in a crystalloid intravenous fluid, administered in a CHI over 1 h IV. b. The dose of antiserum to be administered must be diluted in an equal amount of a crystalloid intravenous fluid.\n\nc. The patient must be closely monitored for signs of anaphylactic reactions during and shortly following administration. II. Antiserum administration is generally recommended only once per patient, but it may be repeated within 5-7 days, with an increased incidence of anaphylactic reactions. e. This therapy is controversial, but has been beneficial in some septic patients that were unresponsive to other therapeutic manipulations. 23. If the patient's WBC is < 2000, consider the administration of GCSF (Neupogens) 8. The dose is 5-10 ug/kg/day SCor IVif the patient's albumin level is decreased. b. Recheck the patient's white blood cell count every 2 days. Normally, Neupogen\" is administered for 3-5 days. c. This therapy is also controversial. The effectiveness of the additionally released white blood cells is questionable and controlled studies are lacking. However, some reports indicate a beneficial effect has been observed clinically. 24. Another controversial therapy is the administration of ImmunoReglan 8. The dose is 1 ml IVfor dogs weighing less than 25 Ib and 1.5-2 ml IVfor dogs weighing more than 25 lb. b. ImmunoReglan has been recommended for administration 3 times per week. 25. Monitor the PCv,TS, and blood glucose levels every 12 h or more frequently. 26. Monitor the CBCand serum chemistries (albumin, ALT, creatinine, potassium, and additional chemistries as indicated by the patient) every 24-48 h. Adjust therapy accordingly. 21. Monitor blood gases as indicated by the patient's clinical status, initial evaluation, and progression of signs. 26. Monitor urine output, color, and USGat least once daily.The minimum volume of urine output should be 1-2 ml/kg/h. USG should be between 1.015 and 1.020. If administering aminoglycoside antibiotics, check for the presence of casts daily. 29. Monitor body weight and repeat a physical examination every 12-24 h. 30. If the puppy's rectal temperature is above 106\u00b0F (41.3\u00b0C) 8. Increase intravenous fluid rate (use room temperature fluids or cool fluids slightly) and recheck the temperature. b. If no reduction in temperature, administer acetaminophen elixir, 10 mg/kg PO once. c. Or administer ketoprofen, 0.5-1 mg/kg Iv, once. d. Or administer dipyrone, 10-15 mg/kg Iv, once. 31. As time allows, give the puppy some tender loving nursing care. Nourish its emotional needs as well as its physical needs. Take time just to pet the puppy and play, if it feels up to it, so that future visits to the veterinarian will not be perceived as threatening and frightening. 32. NPO while vomiting, except for administering an oral glutamine-containing electrolyte solution every 1-2 h. 33. If the puppy maintains for 12 h without vomiting, offer Pedialytew or Clinif'are\" 8. Dilute Clinit.are\" to 50% when first offered, to avoid an osmotic diarrhea. b. Increase Clirnt.arev to full strength after 24 h. c. If the puppy tolerates Clinif.are\" or Pedialyte\" for 12-24 h then offer a gruel of Hill's i/d\u00ae and water, Hill's a/d\", or Eukanuba Nutritional Recovery Formula\", If the patient is able to eat the gruel without vomiting, over the next 24 h, decrease the amount of water in the mixture. Continue to feed a bland diet for 3 days, then gradually switch the puppy to its normal puppy food. Abdominal radiographs-May be normal unless there is a radiopaque foreign body or a gas-distended bowel loop. Boweldistention occurs proximal to the foreign body. The common areas for gastrointestinal foreign bodies to cause obstruction are the pylorus, distal duodenum, and proximal jejunum. Bowel perforation is indicated by the presence of free abdominal gas, fluid opacity in the abdominal cavity,and loss of abdominal visceral detail. Linear foreign bodies may cause a plication, pleating, or gathering of small intestinalloops which may appear as numerous end-on loops on survey radiographs. This should not be confused with the normal 'string of beads' appearance of cat intestines, which is a symmetric narrowing and widening of the intestinal lumen.\n\nContrast studies, with air, carbon dioxide, positive contrast agents, or double contrast studies may be helpful. Barium should be avoided in patients suspected of gastrointestinal perforation. Gastric retention is diagnosed by the observation of contrast media retained in the stomach longer than 12 h. Normal gastric emptying begins less than 30 min after ingestion.\n\nAn ileocolicintussusception may appear as a tubular soft-tissue mass, with an oval or rounded leading edge on survey films. The intussusceptum (the invaginated segment) may be surrounded by intestinal gas. On contrast films, the intussusception appears as a radiolucent filling defect, there is delayed intestinal transit time, abrupt narrowing of the intestinal lumen at the entrance to the intussusceptum, and dilation of the intestine proximal to the intussusception. A barium enema is most helpful in diagnosing an ileocolic intussusception. Gastroscopy-It may be beneficial in the diagnosis and removal of gastric foreign bodies. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may help determine the presence of an intussusception, which appears as a double-concentric, hypoechoic ring with a hyperechoic center on cross section. The appearance offoreign bodies will be variable with ultrasonography, depending on the degree of obstruction and the composition of the foreign body. Areas of small bowel distention should be investigated for the presence of an obstruction. Exploratoryceliotomy-This is a useful diagnostic tool in patients with persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, intestinal distention, or peritonitis. Obstructions or foreign bodies cannot always be observed with other diagnostic methods.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Gastric mucosal hypertrophy, gastric ulceration, gastric neoplasia, pyloric stenosis, acute gastritis, acute gastroenteritis, paralytic ileus, inflammatory bowel disease, mesenteric volvulus.\n\nThe prognosis varies depending on the duration of the obstruction, the location of the obstruction, and the amount of tissue compromised. Some patients with a simple, early obstruction with normal gastrointestinal integrity will have a good prognosis, others with a prolonged duration of intussusception will have extensive bowel necrosis and peritonitis and will not survive. The prognosis for intestinal volvulus or torsion is grave. Cefazolin, 20 mg/kg q8h Iv; or sodium ampicillin, 2040 mg/kg q6-8h IVand amikacin, 3.5-5 mg/kg q8h IV or 10-15 mg/kg q24h IV or gentamicin, 6-9 mg/kg q24h IVor 2-3 mg/kg q8h IV \u2022 Aminoglycosides should be avoided in the presence of dehydration or azotemia as they may cause renal failure. \u2022 If furosemide is utilized, aminoglycosides should be discontinued, as the combination increases the risk of inducing iatrogenic renal failure. \u2022 When the patient is on aminoglycosides, urine sediment should be evaluated at least daily for casts and cellular debris. b. Sodium ampicillin, 20-40 mg/kg q6-8h IV; and ceftizoxime, 25-50 mg/kg q6-8h, IV; 1M, SC,or cefotaxime, 20-80 mg/kg q6-8h IVor 1M. c. Cefoxitin, 40 mg/kg IVinitially and continued at 20-25 mg/kg q6-8h IV.\n\nII. Ticarcillin-clavulonate (Timentine), 30-50 mg/kg q6-8h IV. .. Trimethoprim and sulfadiazine (15-30 mg/kg q12h Sel. I. Enrofloxacin, 5-10 mg/kg q12h IVor 5-15 mg/kg q24h Iv; and sodium ampicillin, 20-40 mg/kg q6-8h IV \u2022 Avoidenrofloxacin in young large breed dogs with incomplete closure of epiphyseal growth plates. One study has shown no detrimental effects to the use of enrofloxacin for 3-5 days in young large breed dogs. \u2022 Dilute enrofloxacin 1:1with saline and administer it slowly intravenously. g. If an anaerobic infection is suspected, administer metronidazole, 10 mg/kg IVCRIover 1 h, q8h, or clindamycin, 10 mg/kg q12h Iv; in addition to one of the above antibiotic regimens. 8. Avoid the administration of metoclopramide if an obstruction is suspected.\n\nOther antiemetics, such as chlorpromazine or prochlorperazine may be administered but emesis will generally continue until the obstruction is relieved. 8. Immediate surgery is indicated, as delay may increase the severity of intestinal necrosis and possible perforation. 10. Surgical correction of any lesion should be performed, foreign bodies should be removed, and thorough exploration of all abdominal organs should be performed. If no lesion is grossly observed, intestinal biopsies of the jejunum and ileum at least should be taken. 11. Linear foreign-body removal 8. With the patient under general anesthesia, examine thoroughly under the tongue and cut the string if present. b. Gently examine the entire intestinal tract. c. Perform a gastrotomy if indicated to remove a gastric foreign body.\n\nII. Make an enterotomy incision midway along the length of the obstruction. .. Gently pull the string from the mesenteric side of the intestinal lumen. I. Remove as much string as possible through each enterotomy site, cut the ends when necessary and make another enterotomy incision further down the length ofthe obstruction. II. Where there are signs of perforation and peritonitis along the mesenteric border of the intestine, intestinal resection and anastomosis is indicated \u2022 Use a simple interrupted suture pattern with either apposing or crushing sutures or a simple continuous pattern with appositional sutures. \u2022 Use synthetic monofilament absorbable or nonabsorbable suture or synthetic multifilament absorbable suture of size 3-0 or 4-0 in dogs and 4-0 or 5-0 in cats. h. Wrap the anastomosis site with omentum.\n\nI. Perform peritoneal lavage with warmed sterile saline and carefully aspirate all lavage fluid from the abdomen prior to closure of the abdominal cavity. I. If malabsorption is expected due to the length of intestine that must be removed (generally when more than 75% of the small intestine is resected), the prognosis is guarded. 12. Reduction of an intussusception a. Gently squeeze the intussuscipiens (the enveloping segment) while applying gentle traction to the proximal segment (the intussusceptum or invaginated section). b. If the intussusception is reduced, examine the serosal surface for signs of trauma. Simple lacerations may be repaired with synthetic absorbable 3-0 sutures, placed in a simple interrupted pattern. c. If the intussusception cannot be reduced, or the involved intestinal segments are not viable, resection and anastomosis is indicated. d. Wrap the anastomosis site with omentum. e. Enteropexy, suturing of the site of the intussusception to the abdominal wall, or enteroplication, suturing the intestine in accordion-like folds, is recommended to decrease the incidence of recurrence.\n\nr. Perform peritoneal lavage with warmed sterile saline and carefully aspirate all lavage fluid from the abdomen prior to closure ofthe abdominal cavity. 13. If peritonitis has occurred secondary to bowel perforation, delayed abdominal closure should be utilized to facilitate abdominal drainage. 14. If the viability of a section of bowel is in doubt, a second exploratory laparotomy 24 h later is indicated to reassess the viability. 15. Offer the patient a small amount of water to drink 24 h after surgery. If no vomiting occurs for 8-12 h on liquids, offer a small amount of bland food. Continue the patient on a bland diet for 3-5 days, then gradually switch back to the regular diet. 1B. Complications following intestinal surgery include breakdown of the enterotomy or anastomosis site with subsequent peritonitis, peritonitis, abscessation, adhesion formation, stricture formation, and malabsorption syndromes from the resection oflarge portions (75% or more) ofthe small intestine. 11. Signs of peritonitis following gastrointestinal surgery include e. Increased abdominal pain. b. Depression. c. Persistent vomiting d. Fever and leukocytosis. e. Absence of normal borborygmus.\n\nr. Ileus.\n\ng. Abdominal radiographs may show an accumulation of fluid and gas throughout the intestinal tract, a lack of intestinal detail, and a ground glass appearance of the abdominal cavity. Free air will be present in the abdominal cavity normally following abdominal surgery, so the presence of free abdominal air cannot be used to evaluate for signs of intestinal perforation postoperatively. h. Abdominocentesis or diagnostic peritoneal lavage and fluid analysis is usually the most valuable diagnostic tool \u2022 Intracellular bacteria in neutophils or a high leukocyte count indicates infection and exploratory surgery is indicated. \u2022 An increase in neutrophils (~lO,OOO/mm 3 ) commonly occurs in the lavage fluid of animals without peritonitis that have had recent abdominal surgery. However, these neutrophils should not contain bacteria and should not be degenerate. \u2022 The presence of bacteria or vegetable matter indicates bowel rupture has occurred and exploratory surgery is necessary. 18. Ifperitonitis is suspected, a second exploratory celiotomy should be performed immediately. Immune-mediated disease-Food intolerance and/or sensitivity. 4. Inflammatory-Plasmacytic lymphocytic, eosinophilic, granulomatous, histiocytic or ulcerative gastroenteritis, suppurative enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease. 5. Metabolic and endocrine disorders-hyperthyroidism, diabetes, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, pancreatitis, and hepatic disease. 8. Neoplastic diseases-lymphosarcoma, intestinal mast cell tumors, systemic feline mastocytosis, intestinal adenocarcinoma (especially in male Siamese cats) and other intestinal tumors. 1. Drugs and toxins-a variety of drugs, chemicals, and plant materials have direct irritative effects on the bowel or alter gut motility and cause diarrhea. 8. Miscellaneous-idiopathic feline colitis especially in 'nervous breeds' (Siamese, Abyssinian, Burmese), dietary indiscretion or overload, abrupt dietary change or stress.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe vomiting and diarrhea, intermittent diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy. There may have been a sudden diet change within 1-3 days prior to the onset of diarrhea. Physical exam-Perform a complete and thorough physical examination; however, performing a rectal exam on an un sedated feline patient is not recommended. The patient may appear dehydrated. Abdominal tenderness may be elicited upon abdominal palpation. An abdominal mass may be palpable. Laboratory evaluation-1. Fecal examinations (gross and microscopic). 2. CBC. 3. Complete serum biochemistry profile. 4. Urinalysis. 5. FeLV and FlYtests. 6. Thyroid tests. 1. Empirical treatment for Giardia. 8. A controlled elimination diet. 9. Further testing may be necessary (oxygenspecific function tests. fecal cultures. absorption tests). Abdominal radiographs-These may reveal a gastrointestinal foreign body, an area of thickened intestine, an obstructive pattern or an intra-abdominal mass. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may help determine the presence of thickened bowel walls or abdominal masses. Anesthesia, endoscopy, and intestinal biopsies may contribute to the diagnosis. Exploratory celiotomy is a useful diagnostic tool in patients with persistent vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain, intestinal distention, or peritonitis. Intramural lesions, obstructions or foreign bodies cannot always be observed with other diagnostic methods.\n\nThe prognosis is variable, depending on the etiology and the patient's condition at presentation. n Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis. and cost of the treatment. 2. Acute diarrhea (mild) a. NPOfor 24-36 h unless the patient is less than 8 weeks of age. b. Maintain hydration with oral fluids unless the patient is vomiting. c. Begin bland food (such as boiled chicken or turkey, cottage cheese, potato and rice). Avoid baby foods which contain onion powder, as onion powder has been linked to Heinz body anemia in cats. If the diarrhea resolves, gradually return the patient to its regular diet over 2-3 days. d. Empirically treat the patient for coccidia or Giardia\n\n\u2022 The recommended treatment for coccidiosis in cats is sulfadimethoxine (Albon\"), 55 mg/kg initial dose, followed by 25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. \u2022 The recommended treatment for giardiasis in cats is metronidazole, 10 mg/kg PO q8h for 7-10 days. 8. The recommended treatment of Toxocara and Ancylostoma infection in cats is pyrantel, 20 mg/kg PO given once and repeated in 3 weeks.\n\nr. Treat the specific cause as needed.\n\n3. Acute diarrhea (severe)-Treat as for canine parvovirus gastroenteritis a. Administer either intravenous or subcutaneous balanced electrolyte crystalloid fluids such as Normosol-R or LRS. Intravenous fluid therapy is preferred. b. Potassium supplementation is usually necessary. Check serum potassium levels and treat accordingly. Empirically, add 30-40 mEq of potassium chloride to each liter of intravenous fluids. c. Administer antibiotics if the patient has a fever, leukocytosis, or severe hemorrhagic enteritis. Recommendations include amoxicillin, enrofloxacin, metronidazole, and trimethoprim-sulfa. d. Monitor blood glucose levels, maintain blood glucose between 130 and 180 mgt dl with a 5% dextrose drip if necessary. 8. Administer antiemetics if necessary. r. Administer colloids or plasma if the patient develops hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia. g. Provide nutritional support, consider the administration of Procal Amine.\n\n40-45 ml/kg/day IV; for partial parenteral nutrition. h. Treat the specific cause as needed \u2022 Ifcampylobacteriosis is suspected, administer erythromycin, 10-15 mg/kg PO q8h, or tetracycline or chloramphenicol. \u2022 Ifsalmonellosis is suspected, administer enrofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfa, or chloramphenicol if the patient is septic. Ifthe patient only has mild diarrhea, avoid the administration of antibiotics, which may promote the development of a carrier state. 165 D m i I 4.\n\n\u2022 If c1ostridiosis is suspected, administer amoxiciIlin, c1indamycin, chloramphenicol, or tylosin. I. The use of antidiarrheal agents is contraindicated. J. If the patient is not vomiting, feed a bland diet such as cottage cheese, boiled chicken and potato. Chronic diarrhea (3-4 weeks' duration) e. Provide the patient with nutritional support. Often a diet change to lams Feline\", Hill's Feline c/d\u00ae,or Hill's Feline Science Diet\" will be beneficial. b. Administer metronidazole (10-20 mg/kg PO q8h), tylosin powder 1/16 teaspoon q12h mixed with food), or sulfasalazine (3-4.5 mg/kg q8-12h for 7-10 days).\n\nc. Treat the specific cause as needed.\n\nII. Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in cats \u2022 Prednisone, 0.5-1 mg/kg PO q12h for 2-4 weeks, then gradually decreased at 50% increments at 2-week intervals. \u2022 Metronidazole, 10-20 mg/kg PO q 12h, for several months.\n\n\u2022 If there is a lack of response to the above medications, the addition of azathioprine (Imuran\"), 0.3-0.5 mg/kg PO once q48h for 3-9 months, may be beneficial in some cats.\n\nHistory--HGE is usually seen in young adult small breed dogs (poodles, dachshunds, miniature schnauzers). There is usually an acute onset of vomiting, hematemesis, fetid diarrhea, hematochezia, a 'jam-like' consistency to the feces, and tenesmus. Physical exam-The patient is usually presented with depression and dehydration and no marked abdominal pain. The patient has profuse hematemesis and/or hematochezia. The condition can progress into a state of severe hypovolemic shock. Laboratoryevaluation-Often, there are no significant abnormalities other than an elevated PCV (often 55-70%), with little or no change in TS; however, a stress leukogram is possible.\n\nDifferential diagnosis 1. Acute parvovirus or coronavirus gastroenteritis. 2. Parasitic infestations of the intestinal tract. 3. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or corticosteroid administration-related gastrointestinal ulceration. 4. Toxicitiessuch as arsenic or lead. 5. Salmonella gastroenteritis.\n\nThe prognosis is favorable to poor, depending upon the patient's physical status at the time of presentation. Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment.\n\nNormosol-R or LRS, at the rate of 40-60 mg/kg/h, until the pev< 50%. If the patient is in hypovolemic shock, administer the fluids at the rate of 60-90 ml/kg/h for one hour and then re-evaluate the hydration and perfusion status. Fluid therapy is usually needed for 24-48 h. 3. Antimicrobial therapy with penicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin) is usually 166 recommended.\n\n4. Administer corticosteroids, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 2-4 mg/kg IV, or prednisolone sodium succinate, 5-10 mg/kg IV if the patient is in shock, unless gastrointestinal ulceration is suspected. 5. Observe the patient closely for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIe).\n\nTreat the patient appropriately with heparinized fresh frozen plasma, intravenous fluids, etc. if DIC occurs. 6. If the patient exhibits excessive, repeated vomiting, or nausea, consider the administration of antiemetics, after volume replacement is achieved 8. Chlorpromazine, 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV q4-6h as needed, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg 1M qfi-Bh, or 1 mg/kg diluted in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCland administered rectally q8h via a plastic catheter. b. Prochlorperazine, 0.1 mg/kg 1M q6-8h. c. Ondanestron (Zofrarr\"), 0.1-0.18 mg/kg IVq6-12h. \n\nHistory-The owner may notice an increased frequency of defecation of a low volume of stool with tenesmus, dyschezia, and urgency.Mucus or blood, or both, are commonly seen in the stool. Frequent vomiting and weight loss are rare, but can occur in chronic or recurrent cases. Physicalexam-The patient is usually normal, except for the presence of mucus and possibly blood in the feces. A rectal examination is critical. Rectal discomfort and/or hematochezia may be detected. Some patients may have gravel or bone chips impacted in the rectum. Laboratory evaluation-A CBC and serum biochemical profile should be performed to rule out other abdominal conditions 1. The CBC is usually normal; however, some patients will have an iron deficiency anemia, neutrophilia, eosinophilia, and/or hypoproteinemia. 2. The serum biochemical profile is usually normal.\n\nAbdominal radiographs-These should be evaluated to rule out other abdominal conditions. Look for masses and intestinal foreign bodies. Colonoscopy and biopsy of the colon is helpful for establishing the diagnosis. c. Isopropamide plus prochlorperazine (Darbazine\"), < 10 kg body weight, Capsule #1 PO q8-12h, > 10 kg body weight. Capsule #3 PO q8-12h. may cause ileus, hypotension, and CNS abnormalities. 1. Immunosuppressive agents a. Corticosteroids are indicated in eosinophilic colitis when dietary causes or parasitic infestations have been eliminated and also for cats with plasmacytic lymphocytic colitis but will make ulcerative colitis worse. b. Prednisone, 0.5-1 mg/kg qlzh, tapered over 3-4 weeks.\n\nRectal prolapse commonly occurs in dogs or cats that are experiencing habitual or continual straining; therefore. obvious causes of straining to void feces or urine should be evaluated.\n\nDifferentiation between a rectal prolapse and an intussusception, which is rare. is made by attempting to insert a finger or a blunt probe between the mucocutaneous junction of the anus and the protruding bowel. Ifthe finger or blunt probe passes easily. an intussusception is present; if resistance is met, a rectal prolapse has occurred.\n\nThe prognosis is fair to guarded. depending upon the underlying etiology, severity, and duration.\n\n-'1.4 Reduction of a rectal prolapse. A blood sample tube or a thermometer can be used to maintain the proper diameter anal opening, depending upon the size of the patient. A purse-string suture of non absorbable, monofilament suture material is tied around the anus, applying enough pressure to inhibit rectal prolapse. D I I 110 Treatment 1. Inform the client of the diagnosis. prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Successful treatment requires identification and treatment of the cause. 3. Administer fluid replacement therapy for dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. 4. Symptomatic control of diarrhea. 5. Treatment ofthe causative illness (antibiotics, parasiticides, etc.). 6. Application of hypertonic glucose solutions or granulated sugar to the rectal mucosa to reduce edema. J. Under general anesthesia, manually reduce a minor rectal prolapse, and maintain with a purse-string suture in the anus for 2-3 days. Draw the suture closed around a 4 inch rectal thermometer or object of similar diameter in puppies and kittens; use a blood sample tube in mature animals. 8. Topical anesthetic ointment with 1% dibucaine (Nupercainal Ointment's) can be instilled in the rectum or a hydrocortisone retention enema, Cortenema\", 20-60 ml can be administered rectally q24h postoperatively for 2-3 days. 9. A nonreducible rectal prolapse with necrosis ofthe mucosa is best managed by full-thickness amputation and anastomosis. 10. If a rectal prolapse becomes recurrent, nonreducible, or intractable to treatment, celiotomy and colopexy should be performed.\n\nHistory-Perineal hernias occur most commonly in male dogs from 7-9 years of age. There appears to be an increased incidence in the Boston terriers, boxers, corgi, dachshund, Old English sheepdog, and Pekingese. Between 10 and 14 years of age there appears to be an increased incidence in collies and mixedbreed dogs. The owner may observe a perineal swelling, constipation, obstipation, tenesmus, and dyschezia. Stranguria may occur. Other signs which may be observed are fecal incontinence, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, ulceration of the skin overlying the swelling, a change in the way the tail is held, and depression and vomiting secondary to post-renal uremia. Physicalexam-Most cases of perineal hernia are unilateral, on the right side, but it can occur on the left side and also bilaterally. Usually the swelling is ventral and lateral to the anus, but it may not be obvious. Contents of the hernia usually include retroperitoneal fat, connective tissue, fluid, the prostate gland, and sacculation or flexure of the rectum. The urinary bladder, colon, jejunum, or a prostatic cyst may occasionally be found in the hernial sac.\n\nRectal examination may reveal a rectal diverticulum, rectal deviation, or lack of muscular support in the perineal region.\n\nRadiographs may provide beneficial information regarding the anatomic structures present within the hernia. Positive-or negative-contrast studies may be useful to demonstrate the position of the urinary bladder. Oral barium administration followed by radiographs taken about 5 h after ingestion of barium, or 24 h if the patient is constipated, may reveal the presence of rectal sacculation or a rectal flexure in the perineal hernia. Laboratory evaluation-Patients should be evaluated for dehydration, sepsis, and post-renal uremia.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Neoplasia, seroma, hematoma, abscess, perianal fistula, anal sac abscess.\n\n12. Administer famotidine (Pepcidvl, 0.5-1 mg/kg IV q12h or ranitidine (Zantace), 2-5 mg/kg IV or SC q12h to control gastric acid secretion and decrease the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration. 13. Flumazenil (Romazicone), 0.02 mg/kg IV; may improve the neurologic status in some dogs. 14. Mannitol 20%, 100-1000 mg/kg IV over 30 min, repeated q4h as needed and furosemide, 1-2 mg/kg IV q8h, may be indicated if there is a failure to respond to therapy or rapid central nervous system deterioration suggestive of cerebral edema. 15. For long-term management, the ideal diet should be high in carbohydrates and contain highly digestible protein of high biologic value 8. Hill's Prescription Diets k/d\u00ae. b. Pro-Plan CNM Nf-Formula\", c. Homemade diet using low-fat cottage cheese, possibly small amounts of egg, with rice, pasta, or potato, supplemented with vegetables and fruits. d. If the patient is reluctant to eat, an esophagostomy tube may be placed. 16. Thiamine supplementation is recommended for any anorectic cat, 100 mg PO or 1M then 50 mg PO q12h. 11. Arginine should also be supplemented for any anorectic cat, 1 g per day. lB. Avoid the use of diazepam, especially as an appetite stimulant, as it may cause profound sedation. Also avoid acepromazine, as it may also cause excessive sedation.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, but the condition has been associated with nutritional, metabolic, hormonal, toxic, and hypoxic liver injury. Diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis may cause hepatic lipidosis. Arginine and/or taurine deficiency may be involved. It usually develops in obese cats after a period of prolonged anorexia.\n\nHistory-The owner may observe anorexia, lethargy, depression, weight loss with a previous history of obesity, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. There may be a history of a stressful event, such as boarding, surgery, introduction of a new pet into the household, abrupt dietary change, or a move. n I I 4. Acoagulation panel should be evaluated and may reveal a marked prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time and hypofibrinogenemia. 5. The cat should also be tested for FeLV and flY. Abdominal radiographs-These may reveal mild hepatomegaly and a diffuse loss of abdominal detail. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may reveal a diffuse increased hepatic parenchymal echogenicity and hepatomegaly. In conjunction. there is decreased visualization of the walls of the portal vein. Peritoneal effusion and a hypoechoic irregular pancreas suggest the presence of concurrent pancreatitis. An ultrasound-guided hepatic biopsy may confirm vacuolation of hepatocytes. Hepatic biopsy specimens from a patient with hepatic lipidosis when placed in a buffered 10%formalin solution will usually float.\n\nDifferential diagnosis Diabetes mellitus, cholangiohepatitis, other hepatic diseases.\n\nThe prognosis is good to guarded. depending on the length and severity of the illness at the time of presentation and the underlying etiology. Treatment 1. Avoidstress. 2. Administer amoxicillin, 22 mg/kg PO or SC ql2h. 3. Administer intravenous fluids with a balanced electrolyte solution, such as Normosol-R or Ringer's solution to correct dehydration. then administer fluids at maintenance rates (20-30 ml/kg/day). Do not administer dextrose solutions unless the patient has hypoglycemia which has been documented. Dextrose administration can stimulate hepatic fat synthesis and block fat oxidation for energy. 4. Supplement intravenous fluids with potassium chloride as indicated by serum potassium levels. 5. Place a feeding tube to administer nutritional therapy 8. A5-6 Fr nasogastric tube is only useful for short-term therapy, but is preferable to force-feeding. b. An esophagostomy tube is very easy to place and does not require expensive equipment or involvement ofthe abdominal cavity with a risk of peritonitis. Esophagostomy tubes may be managed long-term by the owner at home \u2022 Administer general anesthesia.\n\n\u2022 Place an endotracheal tube.\n\n\u2022 Clip and surgically prepare the lateral cervical area on the left side.\n\n\u2022 Through the mouth. place the tip of a curved forceps into the proximal esophagus and position the tip so that the skin overlying the esophagus is tented outward. The site of the tube placement should be about~to )f of the distance down the neck. \u2022 Incise the skin. subcutaneous tissue and esophagus just enough to fit a red rubber feeding tube of at least 10 Fr in size. \u2022 Push the tip of the forceps through the incision and grasp the tip of the feeding tube. \u2022 Retract the tip of the feeding tube out through the mouth, with the syringe end of the feeding tube remaining percutaneously outside the esophageal incision. \u2022 Direct the tip of the feeding tube into the esophagus and feed the tube down the esophagus until the tip lies in the distal third of the esophagus. Do not have the tip pass the cardia. \u2022 The position of the tube can be confirmed radiographically.\n\n\u2022 Suture the feeding tube to the skin, with a Chinese finger-lock pattern.\n\n\u2022 Place a support wrap around the neck. c. Agastrostomy tube can also be managed long-term by the owner at home. o Blind method \u2022 Administer general anesthesia. \u2022 Place the patient in right lateral recumbency. \u2022 Place an endotracheal tube. \u2022 Clip and surgically prepare the skin caudal to the last rib.\n\n\u2022 Lubricate a flexible, curved polyvinyl placement tube and pass it through the mouth into the stomach. \u2022 Grasp the tube through the body wall and push a 14 g over the needle catheter into the placement tube lumen in the stomach. Remove the stylet from the catheter. \u2022 Pass a guide wire with #1 or 2 polyester suture attached through the catheter that is long enough to pass through the length of the placement tube. \u2022 Remove the placement tube, guide wire, and suture from the stomach through the mouth. \u2022 Pass the suture retrograde through another catheter and secure it to the modified end of a 14-24 Fr de Pezzar type (mushroom-tipped) catheter. \u2022 Carefully enlarge the entry wound in the body wall with a scalpel. \u2022 Lubricate the catheter and feeding tube then gently pull them into the stomach and through the body wall. \u2022 Pull the mushroom tip until it rests against the gastric mucosa. \u2022 Secure the tube by suturing tape tabs and using a Chinese finger-lock suture. \u2022 Place a light abdominal bandage over the tube exit site. W Endoscopic method \u2022 Administer general anesthesia. \u2022 Place the patient in right lateral recumbency. \u2022 Place an endotracheal tube. \u2022 Clip and surgically prepare the skin caudal to the last rib.\n\n\u2022 Insufflate the stomach with air, with the endoscope placed in the stomach.\n\n\u2022 Push an 18 g over the needle catheter through the body wall into the stomach where the illuminated tip of the endoscope is observed. \u2022 With the endoscope, position the catheter in the stomach and remove the stylet. \u2022 Insert #1 or 2 polyester suture through the catheter and grasp it with the endoscope. \u2022 Withdraw the endoscope and suture from the stomach. \u2022 Pass the suture retrograde through another catheter and secure it to the modified end of a 14-24 Fr de Pezzar type (mushroom-tipped) catheter. \u2022 Carefully enlarge the entry wound in the body wall with a scalpel. \u2022 Lubricate the catheter and feeding tube, then gently pull them into the stomach and through the body wall. \u2022 Pull the mushroom tip until it rests against the gastric mucosa. \u2022 Secure the tube by suturing tape tabs and using a Chinese finger-lock suture. \u2022 Place a light abdominal bandage over the tube exit site. 6. Provide nutritional support (60-80 kcal/kg/day) 8. CliniCarediluted to 200-300 mOsm/liter initiallyand gradually increased over one week. b. Human liquid diets (Pulmocares) with protein (Pro-Magic\" or dehydrated cottage cheese) and taurine added. Mixwith warm water and blenderize prior to each meal. c. Blenderized Hill'sPrescription Diet p/d\", k/d\u00ae or c/d\u00ae. 14. e. Continuous infusion is recommended. Start at 3 ml/kg/h and progressively increase to 10-15 mllkg/h. r. If continuous feeding is not feasible, feed 4-6 times daily.\n\nCats with hepatic encephalopathy require a lower protein diet such as RenalCare.\n\nIf the cat has pancreatitis along with hepatic lipidosis, administer total parenteral nutrition for 5 days, then administer a highly digestible diet such as Pro-Plan CNM EN-Formula@. Administer B vitamin complex at double the daily maintenance dose, 4 mill. Supplement thiamine by administering 100 mg 1M q12h initiallyfor several days, then 50-100 mg q12-24h Po. Supplement taurine, 500 mg/day initially. AdministerVitamin K 1 (2-5 mg/kg/day SC divided q8h for 5-7 days). Administer metoclopramide if the patient exhibits persistent vomiting, 0.2-0.4 mg/kg q8h PO through the feeding tube or SC30 min prior to feeding. Do not attempt to feed the cat for 1 week. Then offer food other than the desired maintenance diet. as the initial response of nauseation may be remembered and the cat may become conditioned to avoid the first diets offered during bouts of nausea. 15. When feeding is to be attempted, administer an appetite stimulant such as cyproheptadine, 1-2 mg PO q12h or Valium\", 0.2 mg/kg IV q12-24h, or oxazepam (Serax\", Y, of a 15 mg tablet PO q12-24h, if the cat is not suffering from severe hepatic disease. 16. Avoidthe administration of glucocorticoids.\n\nThe etiology is unknown. An immune-mediated disorder may be involved. Other causes associated with feline cholangiohepatitis include toxins, infections, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome, hepatobiliary parasites (including Platynosomum concinnum or Pfastosumi, anatomic abnormalities of the biliary tract, and periductal biliary fibrosis.\n\nThere are two major types of cholangiohepatitis in cats. They are classified by the histopathologic findings as either lymphocytic/plasmacytic (nonsuppurative) or suppurative.\n\nHistory-The condition is more common in middle-aged cats, but can occur at any age. There is no apparent breed or sex predisposition. The owner may observe anorexia, vomiting, depression, weight loss, and jaundice. The signs may be intermittent or persistent and acute or chronic. Physical exam-The patient may be febrile, dehydrated, and jaundiced. Ascites may be present. Laboratory evaluation-n 13. Restrict oral intake for at least 2-3 days, often for as long as 1 week. !Z! s:a 16. When it is advisable to offer food, begin by offering the patient small amounts ... en of water. If water is well tolerated, gradually reintroduce the patient to food. The initial diet should be Hill's Prescription r/d\u00ae, rice, pasta, potato or other low-fat and low-protein diet. Then maintain the patient on a low fat diet, such as Hill's Prescription r/d\u00ae or w/d\u00ae for several weeks. 11. If prolonged restriction of oral intake is necessary, place a jejunostomy tube or provide the patient with total parenteral nutrition. 18. If the patient has concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis, the pancreatitis must be brought under control before regulation of the diabetic condition may be initiated. These patients will require prolonged hospital stays 8. Control hyperglycemia (blood glucose> 300 mg/dl) with short-acting regular crystalline insulin. Either the 1Mor SC method or an insulin CRIIVinfusion may be utilized. b. After rehydration, recheck the blood glucose level.\n\nc. There are three methods for insulin administration, the 1Mhourly method, the CRImethod and the subcutaneous insulin method. With all methods, it is important to lower blood glucose levels slowly, at a rate of 50-75 mg/dl/h, over 24-48 h, to decrease the development of cerebral edema. 19. 1M hourly method for insulin administration-Administer insulin into the muscles of the rear legs 8. Administer regular insulin, 0.2 U/kg 1M. b. Then administer hourly injections of regular insulin, 0.1 U/kg 1Muntil the blood glucose level is~250 mgt dl.\n\nc. Recheck the blood glucose level every 1-2 h. t When the blood glucose level = 150-250 mg/dl, change the IV fluids to 5% Dextrose, with 4-8 mEqll KCl added, and then decrease the frequency of administration of regular insulin, 0.1-0.4 U/kg 1M q4-6h, or 0.5 U/kg SCq6-8h . \u2022. Maintain the blood glucose level at 100-200 mg/dl at 4 h after the last insulin injection.\n\n\u2022\u2022 Continue the patient on regular insulin until the ketonuria, acidemia, electrolyte imbalances and fluid imbalances have resolved, and until the patient is eating on its own. 20. CRI method for insulin administration 8. Add regular crystalline insulin to a 250 ml bag of 0.9% NaC!. b. The dose of regular crystalline insulin to add is 2 U/kg for dogs and 1.1 U/kg for cats. c. Insulin binds to plastic, so 50 ml of the solution should be run through the IV line and discarded. d. Either 'piggy-back' the insulin infusion line onto regular IVfluids or place a separate intravenous catheter.\n\n\u2022\u2022 Adjust the insulin infusion as follows (see Table 7 .2):\n\nt Monitor the urine for ketones. g. Afterthe pancreatitis has resolved, when the patient can and will eat, without vomiting, and the urine ketones are negative, the patient may be switched from a short-acting regular crystalline insulin to a longer-lasting insulin. 21. Subcutaneous insulin method may be used once a normal hydration status has been established. \n\nFrom D. K. Maclntire (1995) , with permission ofW B. Saunders Co.\n\n8. Administer regular insulin, 0.25 U/kg, SC q4-6h. b. Measure the serum glucose level in 4-6 h. c. If the blood glucose level is > 500 mg/ dl, increase the insulin dose by 50-100% of the initial dose. d. If the blood glucose level is 400-500 mg/ dl, repeat the initial dose. .. Ifthe blood glucose level is 250-400 mg/ dl, reduce the insulin dose to 50% of the initial dose.\n\nr. If the blood glucose level is~250 mg/dl, decrease the insulin dose to 25% of the initial dose and change the intravenous fluids to a 2.5-5% dextrose solution. 22. Monitor for oliguric renal failure. The minimum volume of urine output should be 1-2 mllkg/h. If oliguria occurs, administer furosemide. 23. Consider the administration of minidose Heparin. 10 units/kg SCq8h, to prevent microthrombi formation and the initiation of DfC. 24. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias. Provide treatment if necessary. 25. If the patient shows signs of peritonitis, perform abdominocentesis or diagnostic peritoneal lavage and obtain peritoneal fluid samples for cytologic evaluation and culture 8. Sterile technique must be utilized. b. Administer systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nc. Use a Cook peritoneal dialysis catheter, another multiholed peritoneal dialysis catheter, a pediatric trocath, or for cats use a 14 GATeflon IVcatheter with additional side holes, placed (with sterile technique) all on the same side to preserve the integrity of the catheter. II. Make a stab incision (I em) through the linea alba 2-4 em caudal to the umbilicus. .. Aim the catheter towards the pelvic inlet.\n\nr. Infuse warm sterile saline (0.9%NaCl) 22 ml/kg (10 ml/lb), intraperitoneally. g. Rollthe patient to disperse the fluid, then remove 5--20 rnl of fluid for analysis.\n\nPlace 2-4 ml of peritoneal fluid in an EDTA tube and 3-10 ml in sterile red top tubes. II. Remove the peritoneal catheter when finished, close the abdominal wall with one to two sutures, and apply a sterile abdominal wrap. 28. Surgery is necessary for the treatment of pancreatic abscesses, biliary obstruction, or for the management of septic peritonitis. 2J. Oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation may be beneficial for patients with D 28. Experimental therapy under investigation 8. Terbutaline administration, 0.01 mg/kg SC,1M, N qsh, may inhibit the progression of edematous pancreatitis to hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Terbutaline decreases pancreatic secretion and suppresses the increased microvascular permeability induced by histamine and other vasoactive substances released during acute pancreatitis. b. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone produced by the small intestine which stimulates the pancreas. CCK receptor blockers which improve patient survival are being investigated. c. Protease inhibitors, such as gabexate mesilate and camostate, may reduce activation of digestive enzymes within pancreatic acinar cells and also appear to inhibit the development of DIC. "}
