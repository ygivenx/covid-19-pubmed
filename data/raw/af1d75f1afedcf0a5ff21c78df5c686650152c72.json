{"title": "Detection and molecular characterization of caliciviruses (vesivirus and norovirus) in an outbreak of acute diarrhea in kittens from Brazil", "body": "The Caliciviridae family consists of five well-defined genera: Norovirus (NoV), Sapovirus, Lagovirus, Nebovirus, and Vesivirus. Only Sapovirus and Norovirus are known to infect humans and most of the calicivirus isolates detected in dogs and cats belong to the genus Vesivirus (Radford et al., 2007) .\n\nFeline calicivirus (FCV) is a common pathogen of domestic cats. The virus is associated with a variety of clinical presentations, from subclinical infections to upper respiratory disease and/or signs of oral ulceration, acute and chronic stomatitis, acute arthritis, febrile limping syndrome and hemorrhagic-like fever, also known as FCVassociated virulent systemic disease (FCV-VSD). Some FCV strains have the ability to actively replicate in the enteric tract and have been occasionally detected in fecal specimens of cats (Radford et al., 2007) . Recently, NoV strains have been identified in the feces of cats in the USA and Japan, but their role as enteric pathogens has not been elucidated (Pinto et al., 2012; Soma et al., 2015) .\n\nFrom December 2010 to June 2012, a total of 29 diarrheic fecal specimens from kittens up to 10 months of age were collected from four rescue shelters in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The kittens were housed with adult dogs and cats of different origins. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Research (PROPP/ UFF-CEPA/ NAL, Protocol 0223/12).\n\nFor FCV detection, nucleic acids were extracted from 10% fecal suspensions in 0.01 M Tris/HCl/Ca 2+ using the PureLink Spin column-based kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed on extracted RNA using random primers (Invitrogen) and the Superscript III enzyme (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nInitially, all 29 specimens were screened with primers p289H, position 4663-4684 (TGACGATTTCATCATCACCATA)/p290H, position 4354-4376 (GATTACTCCAGGTGGGACTCCAC), targeting a 300 nt fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region at the 3\u2032 end of ORF-1b (Farkas et al., 2004) . For detection of NoV RNA, all specimens were screened by one step real-time PCR (RT-PCR) with primers FNoV-F9, position 4655-4677 (GCCCACTGGATWTACACCCTCTC) and FNoV-R15, position 4970-4993 (CTGATGGTTGGGTCCTCTGGTCCA), targeting a 550 nt fragment of the 3\u2032 end of the NoV GIV RdRp encoding region (Pinto et al., 2012) .\n\nThe 29 specimens were also submitted for NoV GIV detection and quantification with a TaqMan-based approach, using the RNA UltraSense one-step quantitative RT-PCR system (Life Technologies). The primers and probe targeted a highly conserved region of the open reading frame (ORF1-ORF2) junction of the genome with primer pair Mon 4F, position 718-743 (TTTGAGTCYATGTACAAGTGGATGC) Mon 4R, position 815-794 (TCGACGCCATCTTCATTCACA) and probe Ring 4, position 763 (FAM-TGGGAGGGGGATCGCGATCT-BHQ; Trujillo et al., 2006) . A 10-fold serial dilution of plasmid DNA containing the target NoV GIV sequence was used to generate a standard curve between the logarithm of the standard concentrations (10 6 -10 1 copies per reaction) and the cycle threshold (Ct) value for virus quantification.\n\nAmplification data were collected and analyzed using commercially available software (Applied Biosystems 7500 Software v2.0).\n\nModeltest software 3.7 was used to test for the statistically justified model of DNA substitution that best fit our data set. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using a matrix of genetic distances established under the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano plus I model (MEGA 6.0 suite). Additionally, specimens were screened for the presence of feline parvovirus (FPV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline astrovirus and group A rotavirus, either by PCR or RT-PCR Pratelli et al., 2001; Chu et al., 2008; G\u00f3mez et al., 2011;  Table 1) .\n\nFCV RNA was detected in 8/29 (27.6%) specimens. Based on nucleotide (nt) analysis of the RdRp gene, seven FCV sequences shared 60.9-80.2% nt identity with sequences from the Vesivirus genus, as compared to the feline (42.7-45.6% nt identity) and human NoVs (45.1-49.5% nt identity). The Brazilian viruses clustered together with FCV (Fig. 1A) .\n\nSurprisingly, an analysis comparing the sequence of RJ1018/10 with sequences available in the GenBank database, using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), 1 indicated that the 300-base pair (bp) fragment displayed 91.3% nt identity with feline NoV (FNoV; strain CU081210E, accession number JF781268; Fig. 1A ). This specimen (RJ1018/10) tested positive using a specific primer pair for NoV GIV RdRp (RJ1018/10). Nucleotide analysis of the 550-bp fragment showed that the NoV GIV strain was closely related to other cat, dog and lion GIV NoV strains (93.2-93.9% nt identity; Fig. 1B ). Using the qPCR, NoV GIV RNA was detected in the same specimen (RJ1018/10) at a cycle threshold of 31.8, corresponding to 5.98 \u00d7 10 5 genome copies/g feces.\n\nSingle calicivirus infections were detected in five cats and mixed infections in another three cats. There was one cat with FCV/FCoV and one cat with FNoV/FCoV/ FPV (RJ1018/10) ( Few studies have investigated FCV-associated outbreaks of gastroenteritis in cats (Pinto et al., 2012) . In this study, we detected only FCV infection, using RT-PCR in six of seven kittens with clinical evidence of gastroenteritis.\n\nDescriptions of NoV GIV infections in pets have recently been reported. Canine NoVs were described for the first time in 2008 in Italy (Martella et al., 2008) . FNoV GIV was first described in the USA in 2010, and around that time it was also detected in other carnivores (lions and dogs), suggesting interspecies circulation of NoV GIV (Pinto et al., 2012) .\n\nThis study was conducted to identify the viral agents associated with diarrhea in cats and there was no attempt to determine the primary etiology of the diarrhea. We report here for the first time the detection of caliciviruses (FCV and FNoV) in diarrhea in domestic cats in South America. The FNoV reported in this study is phylogenetically similar to human GIV.1 NoVs. Further studies should be conducted in domestic animals to determine the prevalence of FNoV and to monitor the circulation of these viruses and their impact on feline populations. Our results indicate that cats with acute gastroenteritis should be screened for FCV as well as established pathogens such as FPV and FCoV."}
