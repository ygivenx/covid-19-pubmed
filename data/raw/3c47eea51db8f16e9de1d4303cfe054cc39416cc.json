{"title": "Tidal Changes on Computed Tomography and Progression of ARDS", "body": "3 measurements, animals were removed from the scanner and euthanized by lethal pentobarbital injection. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) with pH 1.25 was injected through the endotracheal tube at doses ranging between 1 and 4 ml/kg. HCl was injected in two aliquots with the animal in the right and left lateral positions and 45\u00b0 head elevation. Rats were immediately returned to the supine position and allowed to stabilize while ventilated with PEEP 10 cm H2O and VT 6 ml/kg for one hour. No effort was made to spread the liquid in the airways. After stabilization, rats were ventilated with the assigned VT, PEEP, and respiratory rate, which were not modified throughout the rest of the experiment. All rats received FiO2 1.0. Rats that survived for at least three hours after stabilization were considered survivors.\n\nHigh resolution whole lung computed tomography (CT) was performed hourly at each time point using a commercial microCT scanner (eXplore CT120 system, Gamma Medica, Inc., Northridge, CA). The lungs were easily contained within the default field of view (85 mm transaxial diameter). Settings used for imaging were: 80 kVp, 32 mA, 16 ms exposure time, 220 projections (half-scan), and 200 \u00b5m isotropic resolutions. Imaging was ventilator-gated and performed during 500-ms breath-holds at end inspiration (EI) and end-expiration (EE). Only a single view per breath was acquired during each breath-hold.\n\nThe methodology of CT analysis was designed to spatially match baseline density changes due to lung inflation with the later progression of lung injury. To measure regional inflation at each time point, EI and EE images were registered (superimposed on each other), so that inspiratory 4 density changes could be assessed in individual voxels. This was accomplished with parametric response map methodology (described below). To measure progression, all serially acquired images were aligned: voxels with increasing density over time could be identified and counted.\n\nImage Registration: The entire scheme of image registration is shown in Figure 1 . This registration pipeline was implemented using the open source ANTS package with newly refactored Insight Toolkit (version 4). [5] We performed a two-step registration for each pair of EI and EE images; all the subsequent time points for each animal were then registered to the baseline (after HCl aspiration) EI image. The first step of registration was the computation of a rigid transform to coarsely align images by registering the bone structures, using the mutual information as similarity function. The second step consisted of a deformable registration using the symmetric diffeomorphic transformation model [6, 7] with third-order B-spline regularization. [7] Normalized cross correlation was used as the similarity metric between reference and target images.\n\nImage Segmentation: Lung outlines were semi-automatically segmented (separated) from surrounding tissue (i.e. chest wall, diaphragm, the mediastinum). For this purpose, the mask of the baseline EI image (after HCl) was manually outlined by a trained operator and applied to all the subsequent EI and EE images of that same animal, which had been previously registered to the same coordinates. Implementation details and software code of the registration and the procedure of manual segmentation can be found in. [8] Quality of the Registration Methodology: Figure 2 shows a representative example of the output of the registration pipeline. Starting from paired EI and EE CT acquisitions, a warped expiratory map (middle panel) was obtained by registering the original EE to the EI image. In the warped 5 EE image, the bone structure and the major airways appeared to be aligned with the EI image, and the local distribution of aeration was maintained as in the original. To validate alignment of major anatomical structures, we randomly selected 15 rats providing a total of 75 pairs (five time points for each rat) of co-registered EI and EE images and 60 pairs of longitudinally coregistered (between baseline and each subsequent time points) EI images. In each pair, eight anatomic landmarks were chosen at bifurcations of major airway branches. [9] Trained operators manually recorded the spatial coordinates of each landmark, and compared the topological distance in each paired set of co-registered images. The results of the landmark validation of the registration process are shown in Figure 3 . All operator-labeled landmarks (insert) were in positions that matched reasonably well between EI and warped EE images, with average distance of 325.7\u00b1170.4 \u00b5m between the corresponding landmarks in each pair. In longitudinal CT acquisitions, landmark positions were also maintained in the warped EI images and the average distance was of 335.7\u00b1168.0 \u00b5m between markers in the original and in the warped EI images.\n\nThese distances were not different between landmarks and image acquisitions (p>0.05 by ANOVA for all comparisons). Figure 4 shows examples of displacement fields in healthy and injured rats. These were extracted from the transform functions used to align EE to EI images during the registration process. The color intensity represents the amount of deformation that lung regions underwent during inflation, while the segments indicate its direction. The maps show patterns of deformation that were compatible with physiology, in both healthy and injured lungs. Finally, comparisons of density distributions were performed between the original and the warped images, in both the whole lung and in horizontal bins ( Table 1) . Warping adapts the EE image to fit the size and shape of the EI image, but the percentage of voxels allotted to each density range (as a fraction of total voxels in each image) remained unchanged between warped 6 and original images (P>0.05 by ANOVA). This confirms that no tissue type was overrepresented at the expense of the others, suggesting that distortion artifacts were minimal and percent inflation abnormalities (e.g. atelectasis, mixed aeration) were preserved during image processing.\n\nParametric Response Mapping: We analyzed lung inflation and injury progression in a voxelwise manner using parametric response maps (PRM) [10] of all co-registered and segmented images. For this purpose, the frequency distributions of the CT densities of all paired EI and EE voxels were plotted on an equally spaced bi-dimensional 110 by 110 matrix with range between -1000 and 100 Hounsfield Units (HU), then binned in 100 HU increments. Voxels with both EI and EE densities higher than -300 HU were categorized as severe injury based on our preliminary and published results showing more severe inflammation in these regions. Changes in the distribution of paired CT density values between two consecutive PRMs (at one hour increments) were then studied. At any given time point, injury progression was considered present if both EI and EE voxel density increased to the -300 HU cut point for severe injury in the later PRM. This binary outcome was categorized for subsequent analysis as '1' where density was -300 HU or greater, and '0' when density did not reach -300 HU.\n\nRisk Quantification: We tested the performance of PRM as a diagnostic tool in identifying the tissue at higher risk of later progression by analyzing range-wise receiver operating characteristic (ROC) [11] between each two consecutive PRMs (one hour apart). We used the density boundaries of each range (100 HU increments) to generate two-dimensional bins in PRM plane ( Figure 5) . These bins were then tested as a dichotomic classifier of propagation vs. stable density as follows: in each PRM we determined the fraction of voxels that showed injury progression in the subsequent PRM (after one hour); values of sensitivity and specificity for such 7 observed progression were calculated for each bin (two dimensional ranges of HU for EE and EI) and averaged for all rats ( Figure 5) . The averages were weighted by the bin-wise frequency distribution of voxels in the overall population, to assure that bins with high sensitivity and specificity for propagation but containing small numbers of voxels had limited undue influence on the assessment of the bin's overall prediction. A domain of voxels at high risk of increasing their density to the severe injury region of the PRM after one hour was then identified, where both the sensitivity and the specificity of the prediction (after averaging and normalization) were higher than 0.85 in that bin. Percent values of high risk and severe injury tissue, measured using PRM in healthy rats are shown in Table 2 . (Figure 7) . For validation of the prediction model, a jack-knifing cross-validation strategy was used (leave-one out). [12] This approach to validation was chosen due to the heterogeneity of injury trajectory in the sample population. The 8 residuals of the model were tested to assure the quality of the prediction. Then, we tested whether or not the model generated in the first stage was able to predict voxel distributions in the following time intervals larger than one hour. For this purpose, Pr and Pi in the baseline (after HCl) condition of each rat were used to obtain predicted values of Pr (Pr') and Pi (Pi') after one hour; these predicted values were then used to predict Pr'' and Pi'' after two hours, with an iteration that was continued until the last image of each series. Derived Pr' * and Pi' * values for the final time point of each experiment were then correlated with the actual measured Pr and Pi for validation: a jack-knifing cross-validation strategy was again used, similar to the first stage.\n\nUsing regression analysis, we then tested whether baseline Pr predicted subsequent worsening of dynamic respiratory compliance (Cdyn) and of driving pressure.\n\nHuman Imaging: CT images were acquired from a previously published human study on lung metabolism in ARDS. [13] Of a total of 13 patients, we chose 9 subjects who underwent inspiratory and expiratory CT within one week after intubation. A PET/CT tomograph (GE Discovery ST, axial field of view 15 cm, 47 sections 3.27 mm thick), equipped with an 8-slice CT, was used. A section of thorax 15 cm long on the longitudinal axis was acquired, selected on the scout view. In all patients the most cranial slice was above the carina and the most caudal slice below the diaphragmatic dome. One 15 cm long field of view in this region includes approximately 73 % of the lung volume. The images used for the current study were spiral CT scans obtained while holding the airway pressure constant at PEEP, at EI (plateau pressure), and at a pressure equivalent to the mean airway pressure recorded during ventilation (CT fusion).\n\nThe rotation speed was 0.7 second, with 80 mA, 140 kV, Pitch 1.675 and collimation 1.25*8.\n\nImages were reconstructed to voxel size of 0.98*0.98*1 mm (matrix size 512*512, slice thickness = 3.75 mm) with standard Filtered Back Projection FBP. The dosage for each scan was 9 1.4 mSv. For the current study, inspiratory and expiratory images were registered, manually segmented by trained operators, and replotted in PRM using the same methodology used for the animal scans. High risk and severely injured voxels were identified and measured using the inspiratory-expiratory density ranges derived from the animal experiments. In addition to PRM analysis, CT density analysis was performed, using methods described in the original publication. [13] Briefly, three dimensional regions of interest (ROI) were segmented on the original CT fusion images and partitioned in air and tissue, allowing quantifying lung weight and gas volumes. Tidal recruitment (the weight of lung that collapses and reopens after each inspiration) was also calculated. [13] Results of this analysis are shown in Table 3 .\n\nStatistical Analysis: Image analysis was performed using Matlab R2013a software (Mathworks) applications developed in the authors' laboratory; statistical analysis was performed using \"R\" (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna Austria, http://www.R-project.org). The primary outcome of the analysis was the increase of the fraction of 'severe injury' voxels observed during mechanical ventilation. Comparisons between predicted and measured percent values of high-risk or severely injured voxels were performed using linear regression; the agreement between variables was tested using Bland-Altman plots [14] and by calculating the 95% limits of agreement (LOA). ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was used for intergroup comparisons and to compare landmark between images. An \u03b1 of 0\u00b705 was used for type I error.\n\nAll data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Table 1 . Percent differences (as a fraction of total lung volume) of aeration compartments between warped and original expiratory images. A sample of 70 registered expiratory images was randomly selected from the groups with decreased (5 rats) and stable (5 rats) compliance. Table 3 . Imaging characteristics of the nine patients included in the human portion of the study.\n\nHigh risk and severely injured tissue were measured using parametric response mapping in coregistered inspiratory and expiratory images. All other CT parameters were measured on the manually segmented images. All percent values are calculated as % of lung volume. Patients are reported in the same order as in Table 2 1 . The pipeline of image registration. All the sequential EI(1-4) were registered to EI0 (the first EI image after acid aspiration), with corresponding transformation function \u044401 \u044402 \u044403 \u044404.\n\nEach pair of EI and EE images was registered with transformation function \u044400 \u044411 \u044422 \u044433 \u044444.\n\nFor example the EE image at the fifth hours, denoted EE4 was registered to EI0 by utilizing \u044404\u044444EE4.\n\n15 Figure 2 . Representative end-inspiratory (EI), and-expiratory (EE), and warped EE images in a rat at baseline (after aspiration of hydrochloric acid). Major airway and bone landmarks are visually matched between EI and warped EE. In the warped EE image, the local distribution of aeration was maintained as in the original EE.\n\n16 parametric response maps. Each PRM was divided in square bins (100 HU wide); in each bin, we then determined the fraction of voxels that progressed to severe injury (EI and EE density >-300 HU) in the subsequent PRM (after one hour). Using the boundary of each bin as 'test' for later progression vs. no progression, we calculated values of sensitivity and specificity for such progression in each bin. We averaged these values for all rats and normalized them by the overall frequency distribution of the whole population. Bins in the left lower corner of the PRM (low EI and EE density) have high sensitivity but low specificity as predictors of progression (at lower initial density, the probability of missing progression is low, but many voxels will not progress).\n\nIn contrast, voxels in the right upper corner (high density) range have high specificity but low sensitivity. Finally, a region at high risk of progression was identified by setting an empiric threshold of >0.85 for both sensitivity and specificity. "}
