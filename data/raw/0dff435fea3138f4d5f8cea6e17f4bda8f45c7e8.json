Given the dynamic interactions between the virus and the host, many questions related to viral entry can be directly addressed by live cell imaging. Recent advances in fluorescent labeling of viral and cellular components, fluorescence microscopy with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, and image analysis enabled studies of a broad spectrum across many viral entry steps, including virus-receptor interactions, internalization, intracellular transport, genomic release, nuclear transport, and cell-to-cell transmission. Collectively, these live cell imaging studies have not only enriched our understandings of the viral entry mechanisms, but also provided novel insights into basic cellular biology processes.\n\nAs microscopic Trojan horses, viruses usurp host cell machinery to deliver their genome into the cell for initiating productive infection. Viral entry is extremely dynamic and consists of multiple steps. The process begins with virion attachment to the cell surface, typically via low affinity electrostatic interactions with the glycocalyx, followed by specific binding to receptors. Receptor engagement allows viruses to either directly release their genome into the cell at the plasma membrane, or to enter cells through endocytosis. Endocytosed virus particles typically traffick through endosomal vesicles by actindependent and/or microtubule-dependent transport to rapidly navigate through the dense cytoplasm. Specific environmental cues trigger either fusion of enveloped virus with the endosome, or membrane penetration by capsid proteins for non-enveloped viruses, allowing viral genetic material to be released into the cytoplasm. For DNA viruses and a few RNA viruses, nuclear import of the viral genome precedes viral replication, protein expression, and assembly. For most RNA viruses however, subsequent steps of the infection cycle follow immediately after viral genome release ( Figure 1) [1,2].\n\nGiven the dynamic and multi-step nature of viral entry, many questions can benefit from studying viral entry in live cells. For example, how does the virus initiate internalization? How are host proteins spatially and temporally recruited during viral entry? Furthermore, since viruses may enter through multiple uptake pathways, yet not all routes lead to productive infection, what are the specific entry pathways that result in successful viral genome release and where does this process happen? Answering these questions not only elucidates mechanisms of viral entry, but also -oftentimes -provides new insights into the cellular uptake pathways [2] .\n\nLive cell imaging with fluorescent microscopy offers a powerful tool for studying the dynamic viral entry events. To allow successful detection, viruses and relevant cellular components are often labeled with fluorescent probes, but cautionary steps should be taken to ensure that viral infectivity and cellular functions are not impaired by fluorescent labeling (Table 1) . Depending on the purpose of study, viral membrane, capsid proteins or viral genome contents are often labeled separately or simultaneously (Table 2) . A number of different imaging modalities such as confocal, total internal reflection (TIR) and Epi-illumination fluorescence microscopy have been used. Furthermore, development of image analysis algorithms has enabled researchers to track a large number of viral entry events in three-dimensions with high speed and precision [3,4,5 ,6,7]. We refer the reader to several reviews on instrumentation and analysis for live cell virus tracking [3,8-10].\n\nLive cell imaging has substantially improved our understanding of viral entry. Because of the limited space, we can highlight only a small subset of recent studies, though additional studies of interest are summarized in Table 3 . The following section reviews the virological insights garnered from live cell imaging in combination with other cell biological and virological assays. We will focus on how dynamic imaging of living cells can be used . Similar to CVB, HCV viral entry into polarized cells also begins with binding to co-receptors on the apical domain followed by lateral transport to tight junctions, the viral entry site. However, the process is even more complicated, requiring engagement with up to five different protein receptors [23] . One can expect that visualization of these complex viral entry processes will provide interesting new insights about entry dynamics.\n\nIn order to enter cells, viruses hijack different cellular endocytotic pathways for internalization, among which clathrin-mediated endocytosis is commonly used, though viruses may also internalize through other pathways such as macropinocytosis, caveolar/raft-dependent endocytosis, and clathrin-caveolin/raft-independent pathways. We refer readers to several reviews on this topic Schematic of the different viral entry pathways. Viral entry encompasses the following steps: virus-cell surface interactions, endocytosis, intracellular transport, genome release, and in some cases, nuclear import. To begin an infection, virus particles absorb directly onto the cell surface or onto filopodia (a). Cell surface interactions are typically characterized by low electrostatic interactions with the glycocalyx before specific binding with cellular receptors. Virus binding to receptors may directly lead to genome release at the plasma membrane (b). More commonly, however, virusreceptor engagement induces downstream signaling events, resulting in internalization through one or more of the following pathways: macropinocytosis (c), clathrin-mediated endocytosis (d and e), caveolin-dependent endocytosis (f), or alternative, less characterized uptake pathways (g). Upon endocytosis, viruses hijack either the actin cytoskeleton (h) or microtubule network (i) to navigate through the dense cytoplasm. In addition to relying on the cytoskeleton for transport, viruses also utilize compartment-specific environmental cues, such as low pH or enzymatic cleavage, to trigger genome release through viral fusion for enveloped viruses or membrane penetration for non-enveloped viruses (j and k Hemifusion and Fusion kinetics ASLV [89] , HIV PsV [72, 88] , IAV [87] In vitro systems SV40 (virus particle orientation) [4] SV40 (label free method) [20] IAV (hemifusion and fusion) [86 ] substantial number of internalized virus particles display actin-dependent fast, undirected movement with speeds of up to 5 mm/s. The unusually high actin-dependent transport speed observed in this study is nearly a magnitude greater than previously reported actin-dependent motility. Therefore, the underlying mechanism for the rapid actin-dependent transport remains unclear [7] .\n\nRecently, HbsAg particles have also been found to hijack actin for rapid intracellular transport [63] . Future work is required to determine whether this novel trafficking pattern contributes to productive infection, and what endosomal populations and molecular motors mediate the rapid actin-dependent transport.\n\nCargos that are internalized through different endocytic pathways are delivered to different endosomal compartments. For example, cargos internalized through clathrinmediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and some cargos internalized through clathrin-independent and caveolin-independent pathways, are first delivered to early endosomes, before being trafficked either back to the plasma membrane directly by recycling endosomes, or to late endosomes and lysosomes for eventual degradation [64] . Cargos internalized via macropinocytosis are first delivered to macropinosomes before sorting to degradative or recycling endosomes [28] .\n\nViruses have evolved mechanisms to co-opt these endosomal compartments not only for efficient navigation through the dense cytoplasm, but also to access specific intracellular environments for triggering viral genome release. Viruses including VSV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) undergo viral uncoating within early endosomes [35, 65, 66] . Many other viruses, such as IAV, Ebola, DenV, SFV, and UUKV, require trafficking from early to maturing or late endosomes before uncoating [38, 46, 58, 62, 67, 68] . The pH drop during the endosomal maturation process is likely to trigger conformational changes in viral proteins that lead to viral fusion, although viruses like Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) require additional acid-dependent enzymatic cleavages [69, 70] . SV40 is sorted from late endosomes to the ER, where the ER-associated degradation machinery facilitates the disruption of the capsid for viral genome release [41, 71] . Live cell imaging with proper labeling schemes not only helps to detect where genome release occurs (Table 1) , but also sheds light on the fundamental endosomal trafficking pathways.\n\nLive-cell tracking of Rab5 (early endosome marker) and Rab7 (late endosome marker) shows that early endosomes consist of two populations: a dynamic population that rapidly matures into late endosomes and a static population with much slower kinetics. Interestingly, IAV and other degradative cargoes, primarily sort into the dynamic population of early endosomes, while recycling cargoes such as Tfn non-discriminately sort into both populations. The study revealed that sorting signals can come from the plasma membrane rather than beginning at the early endosomes. Furthermore, tracking IAV within the dynamic population revealed that viral fusion occurs within Rab5+ and Rab7+ endosomes [68] , which is different from DenV, a virus that primarily fuses within Rab7+ late endosomes [38] . Recent studies have also defined macropinocytosis as an important entry pathway for IAV [47 ] . For this pathway, it remains unclear whether IAV can undergo fusion directly within macropinosomes, or whether IAV in macropinosomes eventually are sorted into degradative, low pH endosomal compartments for uncoating.\n\nIn contrast to viruses that require endocytosis for viral fusion, several enveloped viruses including HIV, HSV, sendai virus (SendV), and a number of non-enveloped viruses such as PV, have been reported to release their genome at the plasma membrane [29, 72] . These viruses often rely on viral protein-receptor conformational changes that are usually pH-independent. However, endocytosis of these viruses is often observed, making it difficult to identify the productive entry pathway. Single-virus tracking provides an ideal approach to directly probe the exact viral genome release site. Using this approach, PV RNA release was shown to occur rapidly near the plasma membrane by using Syto82 to label the vRNA and Cypher5, a pH sensitive dye, to the label the capsid. By quenching the non-internalized Cypher5 fluorescence with alkaline buffer, the authors found that PV RNA release occurs only after the virus particles internalized. Taken together, these PV studies decisively proved that PV vRNA release occurs within the cell in vesicles close to the plasma membrane [73 ] . A single-virus tracking study was also performed to revisit the exact HIV entry site using membranelabeled HIV containing a diffusible core content marker. Three categories of HIV-cell fusion events were observed: partial fusion at the plasma membrane without releasing its content, bona fide endosomal viral fusion, and a more complicated two-step fusion event with membrane mixing at the cell surface, followed by content release inside the cell. Furthermore, internalized HIV particles require dynamin before fusion within endosomal compartments, which likely leads to productive infection [74 ,75] . Future work using similar assays will help to identify the sites of genome release for other viruses that do not require low pH for membrane fusion or penetration.\n\nAfter delivery into the cytoplasm, the viral genome contents of DNA viruses and a few RNA viruses must undergo nuclear import to initiate subsequent steps of the infection. A recent study using FlAsH-labeled integrase incorporated into infectious HIV-1 particles showed that the HIV-1 complexes sequentially exhibit four distinct stages of movement: first, microtubule-dependent transport; second, actin-directed trafficking; third, confined mobility upon docking at the nuclear membrane; and fourth, diffusive intranuclear movement [61 ] . Interestingly, data suggest that HIV reverse transcription may already occur sometime during stage 1 movement [57] . In another study, Strunze et al. found that kinesin-1 mediates the interaction between adenovirus viral capsid and nuclear pore complex components, and further disrupts the capsid to facilitate nuclear import [76] . Future studies of interest will likely use similar techniques to elucidate how other viruses hijack the host cell machinery to deliver their viral genome into the nucleus.\n\nMost live cell viral entry studies are performed with purified virus particles infecting cultured cells. However, many viruses such as HIV, human T cell leukemia virus type (HTLV-1), and VV can propagate themselves through cell-to-cell transmission [29] . Virus spread through cell-to-cell transmission may mimic pathogenesis in vivo. Live cell imaging provides a powerful tool to study the transmission process in real time. A recent study shed light on how HIV virus transfers through virological synapses by visualizing an infectious fluorescent HIV clone with GFP inserted within the Gag interdomain (HIV Gag-GFP). During the transmission process, time-lapse imaging revealed that Gag accumulates at the synaptic buttons after forming stable adhesion with adjacent primary T cells. Proximal to the existing buttons, Gag puncta are highly dynamic and individual puncta can penetrate, release, and infect the neighboring target cells [77 ] .\n\nViruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host cell machinery for the purpose of delivering its genome into the cell for initiating productive infection. Before the broad application of live cell imaging, many viral entry pathways had been extensively characterized. However, as discussed in this article, live cell imaging of viral entry captures the dynamic, transient, and multi-step processes unascertainable through traditional ensemble and fixed cell assays.\n\nDespite the extensive body of knowledge obtained through live cell virus imaging, the technique has its own limitations and future improvement is definitely needed. Firstly, due to the small size of virus particles, only a limited amount of fluorescent probes can be attached to the virus without impairing viral infectivity. This problem poses a challenge for studies tracking slow entry processes that require long imaging acquisition times. Furthermore, contents within the virus are typically labeled during the growth of the virus and incorporated during viral packaging [8, 73 ] . However, few probes exhibit sufficient brightness and stability without significantly perturbing viral assembly and subsequent infectivity. Future technical advances in fluorescent probe development and application of novel labeling schemes will prove extremely useful for real-time tracking of viral genome release in living cells, and for labeling viruses that can tolerate only a few dye molecules before affecting infectivity. Secondly, the low throughput nature of single particle live cell imaging proves a daunting barrier for scaling-up to high throughput studies. Particularly, over the recent years, a number of genome-wide studies have identified host dependency and susceptibility proteins involved in the virus infection cycle, many of which play critical roles in viral entry [78] . Given that viruses exploit a variety of cellular machineries to enter cells, live cell imaging will undoubtedly provide an indispensible tool for dissecting the dynamic roles of the identified host proteins in viral entry. Development of high-throughput and high-content live cell imaging methods for analyzing the large body of data will tremendously abet future work [79, 80 ] . Thirdly, given that each virus trajectory contains a wealth of information, improvements in analysis algorithms are needed for maximal extraction of information on the different types of viral transport behavior and interactions between viruses and cellular machinery in an unbiased manner. Integrating such tracking algorithms with high-throughput imaging may not only provide further insights into individual particle behavior, but also define dynamic patterns of virus-host interactions at a population level [81] . Fourthly, interactions between virus and cellular factors occur at the nanometer scale. For instance, initiation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by viruses and other cargoes lead to a highly specific, well-orchestrated and ordered cellular protein distribution within the clathrin-coated pit [82] . Under conventional light microscopy, the precise localization of the proteins is blurred by the diffraction limit of light. The recent development of superresolution techniques that overcome the diffraction limit and provide nanometer-scale image resolution will open up a window for more detailed investigation of viruscell interactions [83 ] . Lastly, as highlighted by the visualization of HIV cell-to-cell transmission, most live cell imaging studies on virus entry are performed with tissue culture systems. Viral tracking in conditions that more accurately mimic in vivo conditions are likely to give additional insights in the entry process. The exciting discoveries made possible by live cell virus tracking within the recent years represent just the tip of the iceberg of knowledge that may be acquired through live cell imaging in the future. In combination with the development of new technologies and discovery of novel biological processes and unknown viruses, future live cell viral entry studies will undoubtedly further enrich our understanding of virology and basic cellular biology.\n\nMercer J, Helenius A: Vaccinia virus uses macropinocytosis and apoptotic mimicry to enter host cells.

In this study, the authors found that VV lands on cellular filopodia protrusions, undergoes actin-dependent retrograde flow toward the cell, induces apoptotic-like membrane blebbing, and internalizes the cell during the bleb-retraction process.\n\n14. \n\nCureton DK, Massol RH, Saffarian S, Kirchhausen TL, Whelan SPJ: Vesicular stomatitis virus enters cells through vesicles incompletely coated with clathrin that depend upon actin for internalization. PLoS Pathog 2009, 5. This study revealed how VSV particles internalize through clathrin-coated pits despite having dimensions larger than conventional clathrin-coated vesicles. The authors found that VSV internalizes within partial clathrincoated pits, and that actin polymerization is required to facilitate pit scission and virus internalization. "}
