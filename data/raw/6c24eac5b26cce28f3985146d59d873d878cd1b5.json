{"title": "Evaluation of the AdvanSure\u2122 real-time RT-PCR compared with culture and Seeplex RV15 for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses \u2606", "body": "Human viral respiratory infections are often associated with significant morbidity and mortality (Thompson et al., 2003) . The rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are important in identifying the causative pathogens at early stage of the illness, initiating timely therapeutic interventions and limiting the misuse of drugs (Coiras et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2012) .\n\nDiagnoses of viral respiratory tract infections have been made generally by non-molecular approaches such as direct immunofluorescence and viral culture. Although these methods are effective and often complementary, they are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often lack sensitivity or specificity (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Gooskens et al., 2008; Vallieres and Renaud, 2013; Zhang et al., 2012) . However, various nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed and employed for a number of years, their utility having been demonstrated largely by comparison with these classical diagnostic methods (Bibby et al., 2011; Gharabaghi et al., 2011) .\n\nAs molecular assays offer reduced turnaround times and considerably improved sensitivity (Choudhary et al., 2013; Drews et al., 2008; Vallieres and Renaud, 2013) , they have been progressively multiplexed to simultaneously detect several different viruses in a single assay while maintaining excellent sensitivity and specificity (Choudhary et al., 2013; Vallieres and Renaud, 2013) . Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex PCR assays such as xTAG RVP, RVP fast (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, ON, Canada), Resplex II (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), FilmArray\u00ae Respiratory panel (Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA), and Seeplex RV assays (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), which are used routinely for the detection of respiratory viral infection (Bibby et al., 2011; Couturier et al., 2013; Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012) .\n\nRecently, AdvanSure\u2122 respiratory virus (RV) has been introduced as multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) (LG Life Science, Seoul, Korea), using 14 primer sets for simultaneous detection of 14 RVs with 5 tubes: influenza virus type A and B; parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1, 2, 3; \n\nFrom August 2012 to February 2013, 437 nasopharyngeal samples (each from each patient) were consecutively collected from 437 patients with acute respiratory infection at the Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, Korea. All of our samples (nasopharyngeal aspirates or flocked nasopharyngeal swabs) had been transported in 3 mL of UTM (COPAN, Murrieta, CA, USA) and were freshly used for virus culture, Seeplex\u00ae RV 15 assay, and AdvanSure\u2122 real-time RT-PCR (LG Life Science). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Korea University Anam Hospital for patients.\n\nFrozenFreshCell R-Mix Too cells (Diagnostic HYBRIDS, Athens, OH, USA) were provided as cryovials shipped on dry ice. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the thawed cells were diluted in planting medium and delivered into 24-well plates. Once the cells had formed a confluent monolayer, 200 \u03bcL of each specimen was inoculated into each of 4 wells of 24-well plates, and the plates were centrifuged. The first well was used for screening at day 1. When the initial screen was negative, the second well was examined at day 3. If the second well tested positive at day 3, the third well was used to confirm the result. The fourth well was used as viral stock. For viral detection, RV fluorescent antibody pool, D3 DFA (Diagnostic HYBRIDS), and Diagnostics HYBRIDS' individual monoclonal antibodies were used.\n\nNucleic acids were extracted from 500 \u03bcL of nasopharyngeal samples using a NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was carried out with RevertAid\u2122 First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's suggested methods. The samples were tested with Respiratory Virus Detection Kit-A, B, and C (Seeplex\u00ae RV 15 ACE detection kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification products were detected using capillary electrophoresis technology (Lab901Screen Tape system; Lab901 Ltd, Loanhead, UK).\n\nNucleic acids (RNAs and DNAs) were extracted from 200 \u03bcL of nasopharyngeal samples using a TANBead fully automated magnetic bead operating platform, Smart LabAssist-32 with TANBead Viral Auto Plate (96) (Taiwan Advanced Nanotech Inc., Taoyuan City, Taiwan). AdvanSure\u2122 RV real-time kits (LG Life Science) were used to detect 12 types of RNA viruses and 2 types of DNA viruses according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 \u03bcL of extracted nucleic acids was added in an AdvanSure RV real-time PCR reaction tube containing 5 \u03bcL of primer probe mixture and 10 \u03bcL of 1-step premix operating cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR. For the reverse transcription step, this mixture was incubated at 50\u00b0C for 10 min. Denaturation followed at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, then 10 cycles of PCR (15 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 53\u00b0C, and 30 s at 60\u00b0C), and 30 additional cycles of PCR for the detection of fluorescence signals (15 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 53\u00b0C, 30 s at 60\u00b0C). AdvanSure\u2122 RV real-time RT-PCR performed both reverse-transcription reaction with the extracted RNA and multiplex PCR reaction simultaneously in a single tube and used endogeneous RNase P, as an internal control, to give information for validity of RNA extraction procedure and to prevent misjudgment from sampling error and RT-PCR reaction error.\n\nRNAs were extracted from 500 \u03bcL of nasopharyngeal samples with addition of 10 \u03bcL of bacteriophage MS2 as an internal control (Anyplex\u2122II RV 16 detection; Seegene) using a MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) with STARMag 96 Virus Kit (Seegene). Automated protocol for extraction, RT-PCR, and PCR setup was implemented using Nimbus automated liquid handling workstation to maximize the workflow and accuracy.\n\nThe internal control added to each specimen works as an exogenous control to check the whole process from nucleic acid extraction to RT-PCR. cDNA synthesis was performed with cDNA synthesis Auto mix (Seegene) from extracted RNAs. Respiratory Virus Detection Kit-A and B (Anyplex\u2122II RV 16 detection; Seegene) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the assay was conducted in the final volume of 20 \u03bcL using a real-time thermocycler CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After reaction, Catcher Melting Temperature Analysis (CMTA) was performed by cooling the reaction mixture to 55\u00b0C, holding at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, heating from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (Hwang, 2012) .\n\nFor singleplex PCR and sequencing, the primers for singleplex PCR in the single or nested PCR format were identical with the primers of previous studies (Arden et al., 2005; Kapoor et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2007) . The PCR products were purified with a QIA quick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Purified templates were sequenced with an ABI Prism 3730xl DNA sequencer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA).\n\nPerformance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard (Gharabaghi et al., 2011) . A positive result from all 3 methods or from culture or from both RV15 and AdvanSure\u2122 was considered to be a true positive. A negative result from all 3 methods was considered to be a true negative. In the case of a positive result from only 1 of 2 PCR assays, the confirmatory test was as follows: A positive result from only RV15 was confirmed with RV16 (Seegene). A positive result from only RV15 with a negative result from RV16 was considered to be a false positive. A positive result from AdvanSure only was confirmed with RV16. In case of a positive result from AdvanSure only with a negative result from RV16, another confirmatory test, singleplex PCR and sequencing, was performed. The main outcomes of this study were sensitivities and specificities of culture, AdvanSure\u2122, and RV 15 assay. Because culture cannot detect human rhinovirus (HRV), MPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus, we excluded HRV, MPV, coronavirus, and bocavirus results from the sensitivity analysis of culture. Specificity was calculated as the percentage of the number of target virus-negative specimens by each assay against the number of target virus-negative specimens by composite reference standard. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nFour hundred thirty-seven respiratory samples were tested by culture, RV15, and AdvanSure. Of 437 samples tested, respiratory viral pathogens were detected from 205 samples (46.9%, 205/437). The distributions of the viruses as single infections and coinfections were shown in Table 1 . Forty-five samples (10.3%) had viruses more than 1. Of 45 coinfected specimens, AdvanSure detected 41 specimens (91.1%) as coinfected, while RV15 detected 27 specimens (60.0%) as coinfected. Thirty-seven samples (8.5%) had 2 viruses in their samples, while 8 (1.8%) had 3 viruses. In our study, RSV and rhinoviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by adenoviruses and bocaviruses.\n\nA total of 195 (44.6%, 195/437) and 184 (42.1%. 184/437) samples were AdvanSure and RV15 positive, while 114 (26.1%, 114/437) samples were culture positive. One hundred twelve of 114 culturepositive samples were AdvanSure positive, except 2 samples (1 adenovirus, 1 RSV) ( Table 2) . (Table 3) The sensitivity for each target and assay was calculated with the number of true confirmed cases (Table 3) . Overall, the sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 74.5, 89.8, and 95.1%, respectively. Eight target viruses (influenza A, influenza B, RSV, PIV, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E/NL63, bocavirus, MPV) demonstrated sensitivities of more than 93% in AdvanSure (Table 3) . Four target viruses (influenza A, RSV, PIV, coronavirus OC43) had sensitivities of more than 93% in RV15. Influenza B, coronavirus 229E/NL, bocavirus, and MPV showed poor sensitivities in RV15. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 PCR assays for all viruses except MPV. Culture showed fairly good sensitivities in influenza A (90.9%) and PIV (86.7%). However, culture showed lower sensitivities in RSV and adenovirus (63.2 and 69.2%, respectively).\n\nThe overall specificity of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 100/ 98.9/99.5%, respectively. As for each target virus, the specificities of RV15 and AdvanSure were as follows: 100/99.8% for influenza A, 100/ 100% for influenza B, 100/100% for RSV, 99.8/100% for adenovirus, 100/99.8% for PIV, 99.5/100% for rhinovirus, 99.8/100% for coronavirus OC43, 100/100% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 99.8/99.8% for MPV, and 100/100% for bocavirus.\n\nThirty samples were only positive by AdvanSure, of which 25 (83.3%) were positive by RV16. As for 5 discrepant samples, an additional confirmatory test, singleplex PCR and sequencing, was performed. Taken together, 29 (96.7%) were confirmed as true positive by composite reference standard. Confirmed true-positive viruses were 11 rhinoviruses, 6 MPVs, 4 bocaviruses, 3 RSVs, 2 influenza B viruses, 2 adenoviruses, and 2 coronavirus NL63. One MPV was false positive.\n\nSixteen samples were only positive by RV15, of which 11 (68.8%) were confirmed as true positive by RV16. They were 6 rhinoviruses, 2 RSVs, 1 influenza A virus, and 2 adenoviruses. Two rhinoviruses, 1 coronavirus OC43, 1 adenovirus, and 1 MPV were false positive.\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the performance of the AdvanSure assay with those of RV15 assay and viral culture. The agreement between AdvanSure and RV15 assays was 92.7% (405/437). For PIV and coronavirus OC43, 2 PCR assays showed the same sensitivities of 93.3% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity for AdvanSure was slightly higher than that for RV15 (95.1% versus 89.8%); there was no statistically significant difference between 2 PCR assays. For detection of influenza B, coronovirus229E/NL63, bocavirus, and MPV, there might be an apparent difference between AdvanSure and RV15. Nevertheless, the difference was not statistically significant, which is likely due to the low number of target virus-positive specimens ( Table 3) .\n\nThe good performance of AdvanSure was found in multiple viruses infected specimens. Of 45 coinfected specimens, AdvanSure detected 41 specimens (91.1%) as coinfected, while RV15 detected 27 specimens (60.0%) as coinfected. Although the contradictory conclusions on the clinical impact of viral coinfections have been reported (Vallieres and Renaud, 2013) , several studies have pointed out that multiple virus infections are associated with a more severe clinical course (Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2013) . As simultaneous control of all coinfected viruses becomes more important goal of medical treatment, AdvanSure assay would provide clinicians with better infectious status of patients than RV15 (Zhang et al., 2012) . As expected, AdvanSure and RV15 showed sensitivities superior to culture. For influenza A, viral culture showed good sensitivity similar to both of them, but lower sensitivities for RSV and adenovirus, as in other studies (Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010; Sanghavi et al., 2012) . Among 5 influenza B positives, 3 were detected by culture, and 5, by AdvanSure, while none of them were detected by RV15. In the previous study evaluating Seeplex RV12 detection kit (Seegene, Rockville, MD, USA), viral culture, RV12, and real-time PCR detected 8, 6, and 11 of 11 influenza B-positive specimens, respectively (Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010) . In that study, RV12 based on a dual priming oligonucleotide system (DPO) demonstrated less clinical sensitivity for detection of influenza B than viral culture, while real-time PCR showed the greatest analytical and clinical sensitivity. Similarly, our study demonstrated that RV15 with DPO technology was less sensitive for influenza B than viral culture, while AdvanSure was the most sensitive for influenza B virus.\n\nViral culture is not a sensitive method for detection of rhinovirus and other viruses such as MPV and coronavirus (Lee et al., 2007) . Viral culture has limited ability to detect many serotypes of rhinovirus (Greenberg, 2011) . In our study, only AdvanSure and RV15 detected 48 rhinoviruses (14.9%) from 323 culture-negative samples. Although MPV causes acute respiratory tract infections similar to that caused by RSV in children, the elderly, and immune-compromised patients, it is difficult to detect MPV by cell culture due to its fastidious growth requirements and mild cytopathicity (Feuillet et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2007) . In this study, AdvanSure and RV15 detected 6 MPVs (1.9%) from 323 culture-negative samples.\n\nIn spite of the relatively low sensitivity of culture, a positive result from culture only was considered to be a true positive because it has been regarded as traditional gold standard. As shown in a case of 2009 H1N1 influenza positive by culture and negative by the ProFlu+ assay (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc., Waukesha, WI, USA), mutations of target site could raise the false negativity by PCR method (Zheng et al., 2010) . There was 1 case of adenovirus positive by culture and negative by both PCR assays in this study, which may be caused by mismatch between primer and/or probe and its binding region.\n\nAmong 29 specimens, which were positive by only AdvanSure and confirmed as true positive by composite reference standard, 21 specimens (72%) had high cycle threshold values (\u226520, cut-off = 27) by AdvanSure, indicating low amounts of target virus in the specimens. As expected, the real-time PCR system of AdvanSure was more sensitive than RV15 based on capillary electrophoresis.\n\nFive false-positive cases in RV15 in comparison with 1 case in AdvanSure might be caused by carry over or contamination during the process of 2-step RT-PCR and/or gel electrophoresis after PCR, while the AdvanSure system, being a 1-step real-time PCR with automated nucleic acid extraction system, seems to be able to reduce such chance (Caliendo, 2011; Kehl and Kumar, 2009; Olofsson et al., 2011) . Besides, AdvanSure as real-time PCR technology has the advantages such as decreasing the turnaround time, evaluating PCR products in real time during each PCR cycle, and aiding as a semi-quantitative method in distinguishing a true etiological agent from an innocent bystander (Kehl and Kumar, 2009; Olofsson et al., 2011) .\n\nWith the introduction of simultaneous molecular diagnostics, current estimates of the prevalence of viral coinfections were documented to be 5%-50% (Martin et al., 2013; Vallieres and Renaud, 2013) . Similar to the previous study evaluating multiplex real-time PCR, 2 and 3 viruses-infected specimens in this study were 8.5% and 1.8% of total respiratory specimens, respectively (Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2009) .\n\nRSV and rhinovirus were the most common viruses detected with other viruses. However, coinfection rates were highest in bocavirus and coronavirus. Bocavirus was always detected with other viruses (9/9, 100%). Seven coronavirus (70%) was co-detected with other viruses among 10 coronavirus-positive cases. In the previous study analyzing multiple viral respiratory infections among 225 childcare attendees, viruses frequently coinfected with bocavirus were adenovirus, coronavirus, and HRV (Martin et al., 2013) . Similarly, in this study, bocaviruses presented most frequently with adenoviruses (77.8%, 7/9). Our result that all of bocavirus-infected samples were coinfected supports the claim that the development of human bocavirus pathogenicity may require its reciprocal interaction with other coinfecting viruses (Zhang et al., 2012) .\n\nTwo different extraction methods with different input volumes (NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae versus Smart LabAssist-32) in this study were used according to manufacturer's instruction. Different extraction method could partly affect the difference observed. However, further study is needed to evaluate accurately the impact of different extraction systems on the performance of AdvanSure or RV15.\n\nThe main limitation of this study is the small number of specimens with specific virus such as influenza B virus, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus 229E/NL63, bocavirus, and MPV, requiring future study with more specimens as for those viruses. Nevertheless, it should be noted that AdvanSure showed improved overall sensitivity over RV15. Also, we compared not only AdvanSure and multiplex conventional PCR but also culture, complementing the shortcoming in the previous study evaluating AdvanSure (Rheem et al., 2012) .\n\nIn conclusion, AdvanSure assay demonstrated exquisite performance, compared with RV15 as well as culture method. In addition, the AdvanSure showed improved sensitivity over RV15 for detection of coinfection, while maintaining excellent specificity. AdvanSure will be a promising alternative for molecular multiplexing testing."}
