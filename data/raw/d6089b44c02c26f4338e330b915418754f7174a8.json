{"title": "Assessing the Global Tendency of COVID-19 Outbreak", "body": "At the end of 2019, the first case of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) was confirmed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, caused by a new type of coronavirus named \"2019 new coronavirus [1] \" [2] . The disease spread across China during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival. As of 24:00 on March 14, China had passed the peak of the epidemic and started to recover gradually, with a total of 80,844 confirmed cases and 3,199 deaths reported [3] . However, new cases of disease began to appear in other parts of the world and increases rapidly. Because of the rapid spread of the disease, the World Heath Organization (WHO) has assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic [4] , which is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. As of March 14, 2020 , the cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 135 countries and territories worldwide, with a total of 142,539 confirmed cases (61,518 outside of China) and 5,393 deaths (2, 199 outside of China) [5] . Among them, a total of 17,660 cases were confirmed in Italy, 11, 364 in Iran, 8, 086 in Republic of Korea, 1,678 in the U.S., furthermore, Europe became the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China [6] .\n\nWith the outbreak of COVID-19, countries or territories have been taking different measures to cope with the spread of the pandemic, but the number of infectious people is still increasing. Meanwhile, the development of the pandemic has also caused a huge impact on the trade flows and economic development of the world. These situations raised many urgent problems. How will the epidemics develop in countries or territories around the world? When will the spread of epidemic arrive the peak or turn to stabilize? How many people will be at risk of infectious? Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze the trend of COVID-19 and predict the arrival of peaks for the prevention and control of the pandemic all over the world .\n\nBased on the global data [7] reported by national authorities, we perform an analysis on epidemic status in 118 countries. Section 2 briefly discusses the most up-to-date literature related to COVID-19 epidemic status. Section 3 describes SEIR model in details. Section 4 presents the simulation and analysis of the model. Section 5 concludes.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, Li Y et al [8] , used the outside-China diagnosis number released by WHO and built a mathematical model to capture the global trend of epidemics outside China, and they found that 34 founder patient outside China were not found, the worldwide epidemic trend is approximately exponential, and may grow 10 folds every 19 days.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, Zhuang Z et al [9] , used a stochastic model to simulate the transmission process of South Korea and Italy under two corresponding assumptions of exponential growth periods, the results indicated that the reproductive number of the Republic of Korea and Italy are 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) and 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6), respectively. In addition, the estimation of dispersion term were conducted, which indicated that there are fewer super-spreading events.\n\nOn March 8, 2020, Zhang Z et al [10] , applied a data-driven coding method for the prediction of the global spreading epidemic of COVID-19. Based on the historical epidemiological data and the sets of parameters of augmented SEIR model in 367 cities of China, they selected the best fit profiles to predict the trend of epidemic with any population by comparing the given an early epidemic and the historical profiles. In their study, the peaks of infectious cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran are expected to occur at the end of March, and the percentages of population infectious will less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, respectively. On March 10, 2020, Zhang Z et al [11] , used the state transition matrix model to predict the epidemic trend of South Korea, Italy and Iran. By matching and fitting different scenarios, the inflection point arrival time will be March 6-12 for South Korea, March 10-24 for Italy and March 10-24 for Iran, and the cumulative number of cases will reach 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy and 226k in Iran, respectively.\n\nOn March 14, 2020, Li L et al [12] , made a propagation analysis and the wordwide prediction of COVID-19, and they also realized the backward inference of the epidemic starting day. The main results show that the epidemic in South Korea will be basically under control at the end of March, and the inflection day is January 7, before the control the reproductive number is 4.2 and 0.1 after the control. Epidemic size in Italy and Iran will reach 200,000 and 20,000, respectively at the end of March, and the inflection starting day are both on January 13, the reproductive number are in decline from 4.2, 4.0 to 0.1, 0.2. And their work could be a reference to our prediction results.\n\nOn March 17, DJ Darwin R et al [13] , used the progression of the epidemic curve and the defined frame work to estimate the instantaneous reproductive number combined with the whole genome sequencing, wich can provide the genomic evolution and variation in the context of the outbreak dynamics. They divided the epidemic into different serial interval scenarios, and estimated the R values. The R value in Japan, Germany, Spain, Kuwait and France are over 2, in Italy, Iran and South Korea are even over 10, however, the R will be low after the social distancing intervention.\n\nIn our previous work [14] , we predicted the time and value of inflection point and peak point in both Hubei and outside Hubei of China. Inspired by the recent studies and our precious works, we conduct a worldwide prediction of the time and value of the peak point, which is essential for the containment of the epidemic spread of COVID-19. The predicted results are based on the current medical situation, if there is specific medicine for COVID-19 in the future, the time and value of peak point of all countries will be advanced and shrinking compared with none-medicine situation.\n\nThe SEIR model was firstly proposed by Aron and Schwartz in 1984 [15] , where S, E, I and R referring to four different populations in epidemiology: the Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered, respectively [16] [17] .

In the study of China's epidemic situation, many factors such as Spring Festival, control policies and so on are taken into account, but in contrast, this paper will analyze the heterogeneity of each country or region on the basis of the common spread of infectious diseases. Although these countries have different policies and customs, their basic spread pattern of the epidemic still meets the principle of dynamics [18] . The epidemic impact of current attitudes and measures on the future trend can also be seen from the data. In this paper, SEIR model which has a strong generalization ability is used. The main assumptions of this model are as follows:\n\n(1) In the predicted time scale, the existing influences of policies or culture of the target object will be unchanged. (2) During the transmission of virus, the probability of infection in contact with each person is equal in the same target group.\n\nwhere t means time, and S, E, I, R represent 4 different state variables, respectively. Formula (3.1) can be represented by the state transition diagram in Figure 1 . All parameters and physical interpretations of the model are shown in Table 1 . \u03b1 Rate of those exposed and being infectious.\n\nTransmission rate to the recovered from the exposed.\n\nTransmission rate to the recovered from the infectious.\n\n.

COVID-19 spreads during incubation period at this phase, but the confirmed cases officially counted remains at a low level, and the public's awareness of defense is light.\n\nPhase two: the main feature is that a large number of patients have been diagnosed, and the statistical data of confirmed cases increase significantly. But there still has no policy intervention and large-scale quarantine measures.\n\nPhase three: as the intensity of policy intervention increases, the spread of COVID-19 is effectively suppressed, and growth rate of confirmed cases is gradually controlled until the end of the epidemic. The main feature of this phase is a strong human intervention. It is crucial to get as much information as possible from the data in three stages. Because this paper aims at the analysis of the peak size and its arrival time in each country or region, two latter transmission phases will be our focus in this paper. In phase two, SEIR will be used to analyze the trend of the epidemic, while in phase three, the simulation of policy intervention will be carried out in combination with the prior information of China studied in [14] .\n\nThe basic reproduction number, \u0734 , refers to the average value of how many people an infected person can transmit the virus to through natural transmission without external intervention [19] . From the second generator approach in [20] , the equation (3.2) is derived as follows:\n\n.

Considering that the calculation of \u0734 is in the case of natural transmission, so we use the parameters of the starting time of epidemic spread in each country or region to estimate \u0734 to avoid the impact of human intervention.\n\nIn this study, we use open dataset from World Health Organization, BNO News, National Health Commission of China and Github. The details of data source are shown in Appendix 1.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) .

For a detailed description of data, please refer to the research of E. Recchi, et al [14] .\n\nRecovered cases data for each country or region was obtained from BNO News ( https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/02/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/ ). However, there are missing values. For an observation with a missing value, if the previous and the next data points are non-missing and the difference between the values is small than 10, we fill in the missing value by taking the average values. Otherwise, this observations is discarded.\n\nWhile estimating the \u0734 of the epidemic globally, we ignore the countries whose ultimate cumulative number of confirmed cases are less than 100 by Mar. 22, 2020 and focus on 64 countries out of 118 (please refer to appendix). The average basic reproduction number of these countries is 2.48 (95% CI: 1.60 -4.33). As we can notice, COVID-19 is lashing a great part of the world, and the sufferings are not likely to end soon. By estimating the average value of R 0 , we obtain the objective information of current situations as well as the importance of epidemic prevention.\n\nAmong these 64 mainly researched countries, the \u0734 of five countries are higher than 3.60, suggesting the great potential of a destructive outburst. U.S. is one of these countries with a basic reproduction number of 6.25, much higher than the global .

In fact, the U.S. had a large outbreak of influenza before testing for SARS-CoV-2 (See Appendix 2 for more details). The basic reproduction number of the U.S. was followed by Germany, Spain and Italy, reflecting the severe epidemic status in European countries and confirming that they have become the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreaks. The lowest value of R 0 is 1.44 in Brazil, still greater than 1.\n\nThe peak value is defined as the cumulative number of confirmed cases. After this peak point, the temporary number of cases gradually decrease and the epidemic subsides Error! Reference source not found.. The epidemic trend of 118 countries are first simulated all over the world, and the peak number of confirmed cases and its arrival time in each country are predicted (See Appendix 2 for details). According to different peak value intervals, these countries are divided into six different categories. Among these categories, U.S. and Italy, whose peak values are higher than 100,000 based on simulation. 21 countries including German, Spain, Turkey and France have peak values higher than 10,000. And the peak values of most of these contries come after April, 11, 2020. 34 countries have peak values ranging from 1000 to 10,000, and all of their peak values arrive after April 18, 2020. Romania and other 33 countries have peak values ranging from 100 and 1,000. 27 countries have peak values between 10 and 100. And 9 countries have peak values under 10. .

It is the only country in our prediction where the number of confirmed cases exceeds 200,000. It should be suggested that the U.S. should take effective measures to overcome the epidemic as soon as possible.\n\nGermany, Italy and Spain monopolize one category, out of all 118 countries, due to its high risk of the coronavirus. The peak number of real-time confirmed cases of Italy is predicted to reach 78,237 according to our estimation. As one of the worst-hit countries, Italy has already attracted the world's attention. The president of Italy issued a national blockade on March 10, however, the daily number of new confirmed cases continued to rise. The other 18 countries whose peak values are estimated to reach over 10,000, such as the France, Iran, United Kingdom and South Korea, are all in severe situation at present. Poland, Brazil and Australia and several other countries are the next worst-hit areas with their peak value over 1000.\n\nFurthermore, 36 of all 118 countries will not reach the peak value of 100, and 58.3% of 118 countries will have the peak value under 1000. However, 18.6% of the countries are suffering a lot that they will have a peak value over 10,000. We are supposed to help each other to overcome the hardship. We compared peak arrival time in countries whose peak value are higher than 500. As we can see, most of the countries will reach their peak value in May. \n\nIt can be observed in Table 2 that Africa has the the minimum peak value and the second earliest peak arrival time. There are only two countries in Oceania for our study, the sparse population makes it earlier to reach the peak value quickly. It is .

As of March 22, 2020, the daily increment of confirmed cases only in the U.S. is 4763. This also led to an outbreak trend in North America, which is estimated to reach a peak of 283,128 (95% CI: 189,394 -632,844) on May. 30 (95% CI: May. 5 -July. 15) under the current policy intervention. Europe has the highest peak value indicating the severe situation in Europe. South America also has the second latest peak-arrival time but a much lower peak value than North America. Figure 5 .

According to [21] , geographic proximity transmission is very prominent in epidemic transmission. That is to say the phenomenon of regional transmission is popular. This opinion can also be confirmed on the map shown in Figure 5 . The outbreak shows multiple clusters, and has a more obvious near aggregation effect. But we can still find that North Korea is geographically close to South Korea, Japan and China, which has the worst situation. The neighboring countries of North Korea are suffering from severe epidemics, but North Korea has no confirmed cases until now. This is because at the time of the outbreak in China in January 2020, North Korea adopted strict control and management. The North Korean government blocked all entry borders, not allowing any people to travel home and abroad. The choropleth map indicates that the spread of COVID-19 will form four major regional clusters. The first cluster ranges from Southeast Asia to Oceania, including China, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, etc. South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines will all have peak values of more than 1,000. Water transportation in this area is well developed, with frequent commercial exchanges and more opportunities for people to gather, which may accelerate the spread of COVID-19. Among these cases, the Diamond Princess incident is the most typical one. The effect of epidemic spread caused by gathering behaviors such as cruises is likely to be much higher than the R 0 level in general sense [21] . As Mar. 22, 2020, 712 people have been diagnosed with the disease on the diamond princess. In the case of unknown diseases, patients will spread the virus to more susceptible groups.\n\nThe second outbreak cluster occurs in Western Europe, including Spain, Italy, France, Poland, Germany, and many other neighboring countries. Germany, Italy and Spain are estimated to have 98,893, 156,857 and 65,082 confirmed cases, respectively, given that the current policies are not changed. France, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Netherlands are all expected to have peak values of over 20,000. Considering the number and density of European countries, there would be a serious cross-border phenomenon. As the first outbreak center, China has a population of about 1.4 billion, and the number of patients in China has basically reached the relative saturation level, because the increment of confirmed cases in China is less than 100 more than one week. As of March 22, 2020, the cumulative number of patients is 81,649 in China. Under the current transmission environment and government measures, the estimated number of patients is likely to be 559,356, with 740 million population in Europe. Based on the above data, the per capita prevalence rate in Western Europe will be at least 11.96 times higher than that in China.\n\nThe third outbreak cluster is in the Middle East. According to the current trend, the peak number of confirmed cases in Iran will reach 29051. According to the current trend, the epidemic situation in Iran has gradually slowed down, and the number of confirmed cases is expected to reach peak around April 7, 2020. In addition, the peak values of Qatar and Saudi Arabia are both estimated to be over 1,000. Estimated by the current situation, the peak of diagnosis in the Middle East will come in early May .

The last outbreak luster occurred in North America. Up to now, although there's no direct evidence to prove that wearing masks can inhibit the spread of the epidemic, the phenomenon of crowd gathering in airports and other places in the U.S. still exists, and many people have not taken any isolation and protection measures. Given that the epidemic has spread in the U.S. (35,209 cases in total, as of March 22, 2020), if the current situation is maintained, the peak number of cases in the U.S. will reach 267,324, which may have a huge impact on American people's livelihood and social economy. If the U.S. follows the existing policy, the peak arrival time of COVID-19 in the U.S. will be much later than that of global epidemic.In addition, Canada is expected to have a peak value of 13,336, making it the second most affected country in the region.\n\nIt can be seen clearly that the most countries or regions where the outbreak is expected to occur has relatively developed trade system and their population flows are relatively large. Timely isolation measures are necessary and the epidemic situation is urgent. The cumulative number of global patients will finally be 1,225,059 (95% CI: 486,934 -4,533,392).\n\nWe performed simulation analysis of COVID-19 based on SEIR model. From analysis, we draw the following conclusions: Table 2 for more details.) (4) Western Europe, Southeast Asia to Oceania, the Middle East, and North America will be the four epicenter with the most severe situation. The epidemic situation in North America and Western Europe are estimated to far exceed that in China.\n\nIn this paper, we mainly estimated and analyzed the transmission trend of COVID-19 based on the daily updated data of confirmed cases and recovered cases.\n\n.

China's prior data were used in the third phase of the epidemic (see Figure 2) , however, the testing policies and standards in each country and region are different, which is highly related to the governance system and safety consciousness. In addition, in the second phase of epidemic transmission, human-to-human transmission plays an important role. The intensity of people flow directly affects the infection degree of the virus. Some factors, such as subway traffic, catering facilities, customs or habits of each region remains to be researched.\n\nIt should be noted that because the analysis above is based on that the official statistics of confirmed cases and of recovered cases are true in a unified environment. As a matter of fact, there may be deviations in the norms of statistical data in various countries, which will also lead to errors between our conclusions and the real situations. \n\nEthics approval and consent to participate Not applicable.\n\nNot applicable.\n\nThe datasets used and analyzed during the current study is available from open resources. 1 3 Analyzed the data: Qinghe Liu, Junkai Zhu, Zhicheng Liu, Yuhao Zhu.
