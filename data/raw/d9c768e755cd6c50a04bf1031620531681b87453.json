{"title": "Camelid type I interferons: Identification and functional characterization of interferon alpha from the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius)", "body": "The interferons (IFNs) of vertebrates constitute the primary line of defense of host immune response against invading pathogens. These helical proteins are classified into type I (viral interferons), type II (immune interferon or IFN-\u03b3) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) interferons based on the amino acid sequence, chromosomal location and the specific receptors used for signaling (Pestka et al., 2004) . Type I IFNs form the primary line of defense in the host immune response against viral pathogens which comprise of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03c4 and IFN-\u03b4 (de Weerd and Nguyen, 2012d) . In the human genome, type I IFN genes are intronless and are arranged in tandem from IFNB to IFNE spanning a region of \u223c400 kb on the short arm of chromosome 9 (D\u00edaz et al., 1994; Roberts et al., 1998) . The first primordial IFN gene is believed to have originated 500 million years ago and eventually diverged into IFNA and IFNB around 400 million years ago. The IFNA gene evolved again and duplicated many times to produce the multiple IFNA subtypes present in human and other animals (Gillespie and Carter, 1983) . In mammals, IFN-\u03b1 is one of the major type I IFN proteins modulating the host immune response against viruses and is the only type I IFN used in therapeutic practice (Antonelli et al., 2015) . Thirteen functional IFN-\u03b1 subtypes have been reported in human (Kuruganti et al., 2014) . These are produced as precursor proteins with a 23 amino acid hydrophobic signal polypeptide at the N-terminus which is cleaved off before mature IFN-\u03b1 proteins are secreted from the cells. Four conserved cysteine residues are present in the mature proteins of all IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and are located at 1, 29, 99 and 139 positions in the protein sequence. Multiple IFNA genes have been reported in other domestic animals as well. Fourteen IFNA genes have been reported from porcine and the recombinant proteins exhibited antiviral activities against porcine viruses in-vitro (Cheng et al., 2006) . Recombinant bovine IFN-\u03b1 showed antiviral activity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (Li et al., 2010; Yanagida et al., 2004) . IFNA genes have been identified from the horse and bacterially expressed recombinant equine IFN-\u03b1 exhibited antiviral effect against equine herpesvirus (Himmler et al., 1986; Steinbach et al., 2002) .\n\nThirteen IFN-\u03b1 subtypes were identified in mink, a fur producing animal and antiviral activity tested against vesicular stomatitis virus and canine distemper virus . In wild animals, twelve IFNA genes have been identified in the giant panda, and the recombinant proteins tested for antiviral activity with VSV (Tan et al., 2007) .\n\nCamelids are a unique group of mammals with distinct immunology, the most important being the single-chain antibodies. Camelids originated in North America during the Eocene period and the present-day members have evolved to adapt to diverse challenging habitats ranging from hot deserts of Asia to cold high altitudes of South America. They are the only surviving members of the mammalian suborder Tylopoda and are represented by the Old World Camelids (the dromedary and the Bactrian camel) the New World camelids (alpaca, llama, guanaco, and vicu\u00f1a) . Though considered a hardy species, the dromedary camel is still susceptible to many viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens. One of the most contagious and infectious diseases affecting the dromedary camels is Camelpox. It is enzootic to every region of the world (except Australia), where camels are reared, and severely impact the economy of communities dependent on camels for milk, meat, transportation, and sport. This disease is caused by Camelpox virus (CMLV), belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus of the Poxviridae family. Like many members of the poxviruses, CMLV is also host-restricted to a single host -Camelus species (Duraffour et al., 2011b) . However recent reports of human infections in India, the Middle East, and Africa have pointed out the zoonotic threat of the camelpox virus (Bera et al., 2011; Khalafalla and Abdelazim, 2017) . Although the CMLV vaccine has been developed, the disease is still prevalent since the vaccination is not widely used and only calves above six months of age are protected by vaccination. Identification of host immunomodulatory genes targeted by CMLV and development of antivirals for treatment have been suggested as key areas for research in Camelpox (Duraffour et al., 2011b) . Dromedary camels are also reported to be the reservoir of another major zoonotic diseasethe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and as a direct source of infection to humans (Gossner et al., 2016; Wernery et al., 2017) .Type I interferons play an important role in the host response against MERS-CoV. Interaction of the MERS-CoV with the human antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and dendritic cells significantly induce the expression of type I and III IFNs, particularly IFN-\u03b1 (Scheuplein et al., 2015) . IFN-\u03b12b treatment along with ribavirin is effective in treating MERS-CoV (Falzarano et al., 2013) . There are no reports of IFN-\u03b1 from the dromedary camel or any other members of the mammalian family Camelidae in spite of its role in the dissemination of many zoonotic infections. For elucidation of the role of IFN-\u03b1 in these major emerging zoonotic viral infections, it is necessary to isolate and characterize these key immune genes from dromedary camel.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification, isolation, and characterization of the IFNA genes from the Camelids. We identified and cloned eleven IFNA subtypes from the dromedary camel. We also report the generation of recombinant protein from the canonical camel IFN-\u03b11 and purification from E.coli inclusion bodies. Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 protein induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and conferred antiviral resistance to camel kidney cells against camelpox virus infection in-vitro. The recombinant IFN-\u03b1 proteins could be used to develop specific immunological tools for the detection and management of these diseases in camelids.\n\nThe IFN-\u03b1 coding region in camel was identified in the camel genome by BLAST sequence analysis of porcine IFN-\u03b11 sequences. We identified a few Camelus dromedarius whole-genome sequence contigs in NCBI GenBank (JDVD01068073, JDVD01067647, and LSZX01078649. 1) which contained putative IFNA like sequences. Primers CIFNa1vFF 5\u2032 -CAG GTC TTC AGA GAA CCT TCA G -3\u2032 and CIFNAvFR (5\u2032-GCA GAG CGG AAC GTG ATG TTG-3\u2032) were designed based on the regions flanking the IFN-\u03b1 protein-coding region.\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from dromedary camel blood using Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). PCR amplification was carried out using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Life Sciences) using 50 ng of genomic DNA as the template. Amplicons of the expected size were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\nPrimers for 5\u2032 RACE were designed based on the cloned sequence to identify the cDNA sequence. RNA was isolated from Camelpox virusinfected camel kidney cells (Premraj et al., 2015) using TRIzol reagent (Thermo) and cDNA made using FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Thermo). For 5\u2032 RACE, two rounds of PCR was carried out using the RLM-RACE Kit primers and IFN\u03b1 specific primers IFNa5P R1 (5\u2032-CAA AGT CC TGT CTG TCC TTC AGG CAG -3\u2032) and IFNa5P R2 (5\u2032-AGC ACC AAG GTC CTC CTG GTG GCC AG-3\u2032) primers.\n\nGene walking was done using the Genome Walker Universal Kit (Thermo) to identify the 5\u2032 promoter region. Camel genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV, PvuII, DraI, and StuI enzymes and each of these digests ligated separately with the Genome Walker adapter to create Genome walker libraries. Using these libraries as the template, PCR was carried out with camel IFN-\u03b11 specific primers IFNa5PR1 / IFNa5PR2 to amplify 5\u2032 region of the gene. Amplicons were cloned and sequenced.\n\nSequence contig for each clone was made using the Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). We used BioEdit 7.0 software (Hall, 1999) to identify the Open Reading Frame (ORF) and the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned IFN-\u03b1 sequences. Multiple sequence alignment was done using the ClustalW program (Thompson et al., 1994) . We used the SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ and ProtParam (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) servers to predict the signal peptide sequence and protein properties respectively. A phylogenetic tree was made with MEGA4 software (Tamura et al., 2007) using the amino acid sequences of the generated dromedary IFN\u03b1 amino acid sequences, previously reported and predicted mammalian IFN-\u03b1 sequences available in the NCBI Genbank. We made the 3-D homology models of the mature dromedary IFN-\u03b11 protein using the I-TASSER server (Yang and Zhang, 2015) .\n\nWe used the primers IFNA-MPF (5\u2032 GAA TTC TGT GAC CTG CCT CAA ACC -3\u2032) and IFNA-NR (5\u2032 TCA TCT TTC TTG CAA GTG TCT CGC 3\u2032) to amplify the mature protein-coding sequence of the dromedary camel IFN-\u03b11. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pET28 vector (Novagen) to create an N-terminal His 6-tagged recombinant protein expression construct. The expression construct was sequence confirmed and transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega) / Rosetta 2(DE3) (Novagen) expression strains of E.coli.\n\nE. coli cells harboring the pET28-IFN-\u03b11 constructs were grown in LB Kanamycin broth at 37\u00b0C to an optical density of \u223c0.5 (600 nm). Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Promega) was added to the culture medium (1 mM concentration) to induce recombinant protein expression and cells grown for four hours at 30\u00b0C. Induced cells A. Premraj, et al. Molecular Immunology 119 (2020) 132-143 were harvested by centrifugation (5000, G at 4\u00b0C for 10 min), and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Pierce)and lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The inclusion bodies were separated from the soluble fraction of the lysate by centrifugation at 10,000 G for 10 min and resuspended in Inclusion Body Solubilization Buffer (6 M Guanidine hydrochloride, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , (pH 8.0)). The solubilized inclusion bodies were incubated for 16 h at 4\u00b0C and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 G for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Ten ml of supernatant was loaded onto a 1 ml HisTrap FF Crude (GE Life Sciences) affinity chromatography column (equilibrated with 6 M Guanidine hydrochloride, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 8.0) connected to an \u00c4KTA Avant 25 FPLC system (GE Life sciences). The column was washed initially with Inclusion Body Wash Buffer (8 M Urea, 10 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0). On-column refolding of the recombinant proteins bound to the column was performed by applying a slow linear gradient of 8 M to 0 M urea refolding buffer (10 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). After refolding, the protein bound to the column was washed with wash buffer (40 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and finally eluted with a linear gradient of 100 to 500 mM imidazole containing elution buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Fractions containing the recombinant protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pooled recombinant protein-containing fractions were desalted using PD-10 desalting columns (GE healthcare) and endotoxin removed using Pierce High Capacity Endotoxin removal columns (Thermo Fisher). Purified proteins were sterilized using a 0.22\u03bcm Millex GP filter unit (Merck Millipore, Cork, Ireland) and stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,pH 7.4 with 50 % glycerol). The purified recombinant proteins were characterized by western blot using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human IFN-alpha antibody (Abcam, ab168449) as the primary antibody and a monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG alkaline Phosphatase conjugated antibody (Sigma, A2556) as the secondary antibody. The membrane was developed with CDP-Star Chemiluminescent Substrate (Sigma) and visualized on a G:BOX Chemi XX9 imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). To detect the His 6 -tag in the recombinant protein, western blot was carried out with an anti-His 6 antibody (Sigma) and developed with NBT BCIP reagent (Promega). A. Premraj, et al. Molecular Immunology 119 (2020) 132-143 2.6. In-vitro induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in Camel kidney cells\n\nCamel kidney cells were cultured in 25 cm 2 flasks in DMEM medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10 % FCS. Before the assay, the growth medium was removed and cells were incubated for 2 h in plain DMEM without serum. Cells were treated with recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 (500 ng/ml) in assay medium (DMEM with 1 % FCS) for 4 h. We also incubated cells with a His 6 -tagged control protein of similar size (20.4 kDa His 6 -tagged Trx fusion protein expressed from an intact pET32a expression vector) at the same concentration as camel IFN-\u03b11 and medium without any other additives as experimental controls. Posttreatment, the cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 2 \u03bcg of the total RNA after DNase treatment was reverse transcribed using Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo). We performed real-time PCR to quantify the expression of IFN responsive genes like ISG15, Mx1, RIG1 and Viperin using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-time PCR and GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega). All samples were analyzed in triplicate and the relative expression of each sample was normalized to that of GAPDH as calculated as 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT .\n\nWe assayed the antiviral activity of the purified recombinant IFN-\u03b11 as the reduction in cytopathic effect (CPE) on Camelpox virus infected Camel Kidney Fibroblast cell lines. Camel kidney cells cultured in 24well plates were treated with 500, 125, 31 or 7.8 ng/ml of recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 or control His-tagged protein for 4 h. After treatment, the medium was removed and cells infected with Camelpox virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The virus inoculum medium was then removed and cells were grown in growth medium for another 24 h. Cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope and images were captured with NIS-Elements D 3.10 Software (Nikon).\n\nVirus (CMLV) DNA as a measure of antiviral activity Camel kidney cells were treated with 500 ng/ml of IFN-\u03b11 or Histagged control protein and infected with camelpox virus (MOI of 0.1) as described earlier and incubated for 24 h. The cells along with supernatant were collected and viral DNA was isolated using DNeasy DNA isolation Kit (Qiagen). Viral DNA in the samples was estimated by realtime PCR using previously reported primers and probes targeting the CMP48L gene (Duraffour et al., 2011a) of the camelpox virus (Forward Primer CMLV-qTF (5\u2032 CAA CTC CAT TAT AGA AGC CAT T 3\u2032), reverse Primer CMLV-qTR (5\u2032 CGT VGT TCT TAT CCC AAT TAC CA 3\u2032) and CMLV QT Probe (5\u2032-FAM-ATA GAG GAG TTA AGA TCA GAC TT-MGB-3\u2032). The qPCR was performed in an ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR machine using the following conditionsinitial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 s and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. The amount of viral DNA was estimated using a standard curve made from 10-fold serial dilutions of viral DNA standard run under the same conditions in qPCR. \n\nWe amplified and cloned an 818 bp DNA fragment containing the dromedary camel IFN\u03b1 by PCR using CdIFNaVF & VR primers. To identify the 5\u2032 UTR of IFN\u03b1-1, RACE PCR was done with RNA from virus-infected cell lines. After two rounds of 5\u2032 RACE PCR for IFN\u03b11, a 340 bp fragment was obtained. This fragment contained 220 bp of 5\u2032 UTR and 120bp of the ORF (Fig. 1) . The cloned IFN-\u03b11 sequence contained a 555 bp Open Reading Frame (ORF) that encoded a 184 amino acid protein. The sequence of the Camel IFN-\u03b11 has been submitted to the NCBI GenBank (Accession number MN883354). When compared to the reference sequence of other well-studied mammals, the Camel IFN-\u03b11 shares 84 % nucleotide identity with equine IFN-\u03b11, 82 % with porcine, 80 % with human and 73 % with murine ( Supplementary Fig.  S1) .\n\nAt the protein level, the amino acid similarity values were 83% (porcine IFN-\u03b11), 81% (equine IFN-\u03b11 and IFN-\u03b12), 79% (porcine IFN-\u03b14) and 75% human IFN-\u03b12. Eukaryotic signal peptide prediction analysis using the SignalP Server predicted that the first 23 N-terminal amino acids of the 184 amino acid camel IFN-\u03b11 precursor represented the signal peptide. Hence the predicted mature protein is 161 amino acids long, with a molecular weight of 18.6 kDa and a pI of 8.37. Five cysteine residues are present in the dromedary camel IFN-\u03b11 sequence at amino acid positions 1, 29, 86, 99 and 139 in the mature protein ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nWe constructed 3-D homology model with the mature protein sequences of the CdIFN-\u03b11 protein using i-TASSER server. The mature protein is predominantly alpha-helical, comprising of five helices (Fig. 2B) .\n\nA total of eleven subtypes of camel IFN-\u03b1 were identified (NCBI GenBank accession numbers MN883354 to MN883364). Of the eleven IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, seven subtypes including the canonical IFN-\u03b11 had 184 aa long precursor protein. Four subtypes were 187 aa long since they had three additional amino acids at the N-terminal. This could be due to the usage of a start codon placed three amino acids upstream in these subtypes. The original methionine position in these subtypes is substituted with a valine residue (Fig. 3) . No N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in any of the eleven Cd IFN-\u03b1 proteins. \n\nWe identified and cloned an 1132 bp fragment from a StuI digested genomic DNA library by gene walking which contained the 5\u2032 end of the IFNA1 gene. This fragment contained 957 bp of the 5\u2032 regulatory region of IFNA1 gene (Fig. 4) . A key feature of the IFNA1 gene promoter is the presence of the virus-responsive elements (VRE) which modulate the activity of the IFN in response to viral infection. The three modules (B, C & D) of this VRE are present in the camel promoter also. Modules B and C correspond to the IRF-7 and IRF-3 binding sites. The consensus IRF3/7 binding site GAAANN is conserved in camel also. Module D corresponds to the proximal interferon regulatory domain (Fig. 4) .\n\nTo evaluate the biological activity of camel IFN-\u03b1, we generated an N-terminal His 6 tagged expression construct of Camel IFN-\u03b11 mature protein-coding region in pET28a prokaryotic expression vector. Codon analysis of the camel IFN-\u03b11 revealed the presence of 22 E.coli rare codons in the mature protein coding region that could potentially impede the recombinant expression ( Supplementary Fig. -S3) . Hence, the expression construct was transformed into Rosetta 2(DE3) strains of E.coli which carried tRNAs for 7 rare codons (AGA, AGG, AUA, CUA, GGA, CCC, and CGG). Rosetta 2(DE3) E.coli carrying the CdIFN-\u03b11 expression construct produced a specific band of the expected size of \u223c 22 kDa upon IPTG induction (Fig. 5A ). Almost all of the overexpressed recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 protein was found to be in the inclusion body and none in the soluble fraction in SDS PAGE analysis ( Supplementary  Fig. -S3-D) .\n\nThe inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M Guanidium hydrochloride buffer and captured on a Ni-NTA affinity column, subjected to on-column refolding on an \u00c4KTA Avant 25 FPLC system. Recombinant protein FPLC fractions eluted from the column using an imidazole buffer gradient contained the purified \u223c22 kDa protein (Supplementary fig. S3-E) . These proteins were further purified by desalting and endotoxin removal columns and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 5A) . Western blot of the purified protein with an anti-human IFN\u03b1 antibody detected a specific band of \u223c22 kDa (Fig. 5B) . A protein band of identical size was detected in another blot using an anti-His 6 tag antibody confirming the presence of the His 6 -tag in the recombinant protein (Fig. 5C ).\n\nIFN binding to its receptor initiates a signaling cascade which ultimately results in the expression of many ISGs. To investigate the ability of the recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 proteins to induce the expression of ISGs, we treated camel kidney cells with CdIFN-\u03b11 for 4 h. The mRNA expression of four candidate ISGs -Mx1, ISG15, Viperin (VIP) and RIG-1were analyzed by qPCR. The expressions of these ISGs were significantly up-regulated in recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 treated samples. VIP and ISG15 mRNA expression were found to increase by more than \u223c750 and \u223c1800 fold respectively upon CdIFN-\u03b11 treatment. Mx1 and RIG1 mRNA expression also were enhanced \u223c350 to 300 fold upon treatment with CdIFN-\u03b11 protein (Fig. 6 ). There were no significant changes in the expression of these ISGs in cells treated with a His 6tagged control protein which was purified under similar conditions.\n\nThe biological activity of recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 protein was assayed in-vitro by induction of the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 against camelpox virus in Camel Kidney fibroblast cells. Pre-treatment of recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 conferred antiviral resistance to Camel fibroblastic cells against camelpox virus infection. The His 6 -tagged control protein did not show any antiviral activity as evident from the cytopathic effects of CMLV in this sample (Fig. 7A) .\n\nWe also used qPCR to quantify the camelpox virus DNA reduction upon recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 treatment to assess the antiviral activity of CdIFN-\u03b11. Camel Kidney fibroblastic cells were pre-treated with CdIFN-\u03b11 or control his tagged protein for 4 h and then infected with the virus. After 24 h, the DNA in the supernatant was extracted and CMLV virus quantified by qPCR. Cells pretreated with recombinant CdIFN-\u03b1 showed significantly lesser amounts (\u223c 56 % reduction) of viral DNA when compared with the CMLV-infected samples pretreated with control His 6 -tagged protein or without any pretreatment (Fig. 7B) .\n\nCells pre-treated with recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 (concentration of 500 to 31 ng/ml) showed improved cell survivability in a dose-dependent manner (65 to 31 %) when compared to the control His 6 -tagged protein treated cells (7-9%) ( Fig. 7C and D) .\n\nIFN-\u03b1 has been well studied and characterized in many mammalian species due to its immunomodulatory role, but not in camels. We report in this paper, the identification of IFNA genes from the dromedary camel. IFNA genes are characterized by their intronless nature and are proposed to have originated from a common ancestral gene (Capon et al., 1985; Goeddel et al., 1981) . A total of 11 IFN-\u03b1 subtypes were identified from the dromedary camel.\n\nComparative sequence analysis of the camel IFN-\u03b1 to other wellstudied mammalian counterparts indicate the highest homology to the porcine and equine IFN-\u03b1 (\u223c 80 % amino acid similarity). In the phylogenetic analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), the camelid IFN-\u03b1 proteins cluster together in a distinct group like other dromedary camel immune genes we reported earlier (Premraj et al., 2015 (Premraj et al., , 2013 .\n\nIFN-\u03b1 belongs to the long-chain helical cytokine subfamily which includes IFN-\u03b2 and IL-10 and the protein has a left-handed four-helix bundle structure (Klaus et al., 1997) . The mature dromedary IFN-\u03b11 protein is predicted to be predominantly alpha-helical, with the helices accounting for around 56 % of the secondary structure ( Fig. 2 & 3) . Based on secondary structure prediction and 3-D homology modeling, the dromedary IFN-\u03b1 mature proteins have the characteristic alphahelical bundle topology. Human IFN-\u03b11 has two disulfide bonds between Cys-1/Cys-98 and Cys-29/Cys-139. Mutational studies have revealed that these Cys-29 /Cys-139 disulfide bridges are critical for the antiviral activity, whereas mutations in Cys-1/Cys-98 bridge only marginally altered antiviral activity (Beilharz et al., 1986) . In addition to these four cysteines, human IFN-\u03b11 has an additional cysteine residue (Cys-86), which is not present in human IFN-\u03b12. This additional cysteine (Cys-86) is conserved in all the eleven camel IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, the porcine IFN-\u03b11, porcine IFN-\u03b14, and mouse IFN\u03b1-1 ( Fig. 2A) . No additional cysteine residues were noted in any of the camelid IFN-\u03b1 subtypes (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe major putative IFNAR-1 binding residues are located on the helices A and C. These residues are fully conserved across the IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. The putative IFNAR-2 binding residues are distributed at two regions in the mature protein; the extended loop region between helix A-B and in helix D region. These residues are also entirely conserved (Fig. 3) . The Arg-33 and Tyr-123 residues in the mature murine and human IFN-\u03b11 protein are reported to be critical for antiviral activity (Kerry et al., 1988) . The stringent conservation of these two residues in all the IFN-\u03b1 sequences indicates their significance in antiviral action ( Fig. 2A and Fig. 3) .\n\nAlthough the different mammalian mature IFN-\u03b1 protein sequences show a high level of structural and sequence conservation, they differ in the total length of the mature protein (Fig. 2) . The mature camel IFN-\u03b11 (161 aa) is shorter compared to human IFN-\u03b11/murine IFN-\u03b11 (166 aa) or human IFN-\u03b12 (165 aa). Both the equine IFN-\u03b11 and IFN-\u03b12 have the Fig. 6 . Induction of Interferon stimulated genes (ISG15, Mx1, Viperin(VIP) and RIG-1) transcript levels upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment in-vitro. Camel Kidney Fibroblast Cells (CKS) were stimulated with \u223c500 ng/ml of each CdIFN-\u03b11, His-tagged control protein or growth medium for four hours. Total RNA was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR after four hours of stimulation. The fold induction of the four interferon-stimulated genes (ISG15, Mx1, VIP and RIG1) mRNA was calculated with the respective untreated control cells using GAPDH mRNA as the housekeeping mRNA.\n\nsame size as the camel IFN-\u03b1 mature protein. Porcine IFN-\u03b11 (158aa) seems to 8 amino acids shorter than porcine IFN-\u03b14 (166 aa). The variation in size of these mature mammalian IFN-\u03b1 proteins is due to the unstructured C-terminal tail and is presumed to contribute to differential receptor binding and biological activity (Slutzki et al., 2006) . Interestingly all the eleven predicted camel IFN-\u03b1 mature proteins are of the same size (161 aa) and have identical C-terminal tail (Fig. 3) .\n\nNo N-linked glycosylation sites are predicted in any of the camel IFN-\u03b1 mature proteins. N-linked glycosylation is predicted in a few murine IFN-\u03b1, four porcine IFN-\u03b1, two mink interferons and only human IFN-\u03b114, and none of the other IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. Since IFN-\u03b1 is intronless and does not need glycosylation for its activity, prokaryotically produced recombinant IFN-\u03b1 has been the first choice for commercial production. However prokaryotic expression of interferons in heterologous expression systems like E.coli poses other technical challenges like the presence of rare codons and formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. There were 22 rare codons in the mature proteincoding sequence of camel IFN-\u03b1 which severely hampered recombinant expression. Recombinant expression of the protein was improved after the usage of Rosetta 2 (DE3) strain of E.coli which supplemented the tRNAs for 19 of the 22 rare codons present ( Supplementary Fig. S3 -A, B & C) . When overexpressed in E.coli, recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 Fig. 7 . A: Camel Kidney Cells were pretreated with recombinant IFN-\u03b11 or His 6 -tagged control protein or medium alone for 4 h. Cells were then infected with Camelpox virus (MOI = 0.1) for 1 h. Fresh medium was added to the cells and allowed to grow for another 24 h. Cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope and images captured with the NIS-Elements D 3.10 Software (Nikon). B: Reduction of CMLV DNA in IFN-\u03b11 pre-treated Camel Kidney cells infected with CMLV: After 24 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and DNA isolated. CMLV DNA was quantified by RT-PCR (TaqMan) assay using primers CLMV-qTF/CLMV-qTFR and 5\u2032-FAM-labeled CMLV QT Probe that recognized the CMP48 L gene of CMLV. A standard curve made from 10-fold serial dilutions of viral DNA standard run under the same conditions in qPCR was used to estimate the viral DNA quantity. Results represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of three replicates. C : Dosedependent antiviral activity of recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 : Camel Kidney Fibroblast cells were pre-treated with four-fold serial dilutions (500 ng/ml to 7.8 ng/ml) of purified recombinant Cd-IFN-\u03b11 or Control His-tagged protein and then infected with camelpox virus (moi of 0.1). Cells were observed on Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope and images captured. D: The antiviral activity was expressed as the percentage of cells surviving following the camelpox virus infection when compared to the uninfected control. A. Premraj, et al. Molecular Immunology 119 (2020) 132-143 tends to form insoluble protein aggregates termed inclusion bodies, which are insoluble and do not exhibit biological activity (Babu et al., 2000) . Prior to recombinant expression, we analyzed the mature protein sequence of the dromedary camel IFN-\u03b11 in PROSO-II (http:// mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/prosoII/), a sequence-based protein solubility evaluator. Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 was predicted to be insoluble when expressed in E.coli upon PROSO-II analysis and was later confirmed by small-scale expression studies. We used a purification strategy in which His 6 -tagged CdIFN-\u03b11 proteins in inclusion bodies were initially solubilized using 6 M GuHCl as a denaturing agent, captured on a His-affinity column and finally eluted out after on-column refolding ( Supplementary Fig. 3D & E) . Before use in in-vitro assays, to confirm the identity of recombinant protein as IFN-\u03b1, we analyzed it by western blot with an anti-human IFN\u03b1 antibody. For animals like camels which have limited species-specific immunological reagents, we have to rely on antibodies targeted against proteins of other well-studied organisms. The anti-human IFN-\u03b1 antibody recognized the recombinant camel protein, but the sensitivity seemed lower especially at low target concentration of the target protein (Fig. 5B ). This may be due to the lesser amino acid identity between the human and camel IFN-\u03b1 proteins. For better sensitivity, anti-camel IFN\u03b1 specific antibodies need to be generated, keeping in mind of the role of camel as a potential reservoir of zoonotic diseases like MERS. Primary evaluation of the biological activity of the purified recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 protein was performed by qRT-PCR analysis of the mRNA expression of different interferon responsive genes in camel kidney cells in vitro. The recombinant IFN-\u03b11 protein induced the mRNA expression of key interferon-responsive genes like ISG15, Mx1, Viperin and RIG1 (Fig. 6) . Hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been identified so far and they form the major interferoninduced effectors contributing to antiviral activity. These IFN effector genes work in combination to induce a potent antiviral state (Schoggins and Rice, 2011) . Mx1 effectively blocks viral replication, whereas viperin inhibits the early stages of viral entry and replication. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that has been reported to inhibit viral release and also modify viral as well as host proteins to elicit an antiviral response. Pre-treatment of the camel kidney cells with the recombinant CdIFN-\u03b11 is presumed to induce a signaling cascade leading to the expression of these ISGs which further confer antiviral activity.\n\nWe evaluated the antiviral activity of the recombinant Camel IFN-\u03b11 using Camelpox Virus (CMLV), one of the common contagious orthopoxviruses infecting dromedary camels. Pre-treatment of recombinant prokaryotically expressed Camel IFN-\u03b11 conferred resistance to Camel kidney cells in vitro against the cytopathic effects of CMLV. Preliminary evaluation of antiviral activity was conducted by visual observation of the reduction in cytopathic effects of CMLV in IFN-\u03b11 treated cells (Fig. 7A) . The antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b1 pretreatment in vitro could be confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR estimation by showing reduction of the CMLV viral load and also by measuring the cell survivability ( Fig. 7B and D) . As the most abundant subtype of IFN\u03b1 present among the clones screened and having identical protein sequence to that from a potential IFNA gene identified in a few Camelus whole-genome contigs, we selected CdIFN-\u03b11 for preliminary recombinant expression and bioactivity testing. It would be interesting to compare the antiviral activity of all the camelid IFN\u03b1 subtypes against different camel viruses.\n\nImmune evasion strategies of other orthopoxviruses like Variola virus and cowpox virus have been well studied compared to CMLV. Many of these viruses encode multiple genes to antagonize or modify the host immune response by interfering with the interferon response, pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine pathways. CMLV has been reported to encode a few proteins that inhibit IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and chemokines. CMS-252, a protein similar to VACV B19R secreted by CMLV is reported to bind to IFN-\u03b1 with low inhibitory potency (Duraffour et al., 2011b) . Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b1 proteins hence could be useful both in understanding the immune/counter-immune strategies of host/ virus, as well as for the development of potential biological antivirals for CMLV. The IFN-\u03b11 protein we generated seems to be the first recombinant antiviral camelid-specific type I interferon. Considering the high level of sequence similarity with the predicted IFN-\u03b1 from other species, the dromedary IFN-\u03b1 recombinant proteins could be used in other camelids also.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified eleven functional IFN-\u03b1 subtypes from the dromedary camel by cloning and sequencing. Prokaryotically expressed recombinant IFN-\u03b11 protein induced the expression of ISGs and showed antiviral activity against camelpox virus in-vitro. To our knowledge, these proteins represent the first antiviral recombinant type-I camelid interferons and could be used in better understanding of the immune system of dromedary camels which has been reported to be a reservoir of zoonotic viruses like MERS coronavirus. \n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
