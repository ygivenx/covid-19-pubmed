{"title": "Cytotoxic Lymphocytes in Mucosal Effector Sites", "body": "Lymphocytes that express cytotoxic function are a major component of the immune system. Cytotoxic lymphocytes can be classified broadly into two groups based on their antigenic specificity. The first group is antigen specific and is thought to be involved in the rejection of tissues expressing nonself major histocompatability complex (MHC) antigens (alloantigens). Antigen-specific cytotoxic cells also are thought to be important in the elimination of cells infected with a wide number of intracellular pathogens via recognition of pathogen-specific antigens (nominal antigens) complexed with self MHC molecules. Antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are T-cell receptor bearing CD3 + T lymphocytes. These cells are usually CD8 + and are restricted by MHC Class I molecules. However, CD4 + MHC Class IIrestricted CTLs also have been found to exist as a subpopulation of CTLs. The second group of cytotoxic effector cells includes a variety of cell types that are not antigen or MHC restricted and often exist in the absence of specific infections or diseased states. In this chapter, I review the cytotoxic lymphocyte compartment of mucosal tissues with emphasis on antigen-specific cytotoxic cells. Although the primary focus of this review is the CTLs, a description of nonspecific cytotoxic cells in mucosal tissues is also included. The presence of nonspecific cytotoxic cells in mucosal tissues may indicate that they play a functional role in protection of mucosal areas. In addition, their presence should be appreciated since they can complicate the detection of specific cytotoxic effector cells in specific CTL assays.\n\nSeveral different types of nonspecific cytotoxic cell have been described based on target preference, surface phenotype, and responsiveness to various biological factors. Natural killer cells (NK) lyse Yac-1 targets and express asialo-GM1, NK-1 antigen, and low levels of Thy 1 antigen. These cells are responsive to interferon and interleukin 2 (IL-2) in vitro (Welsh, 1984; Brooks and Henney, 1985) . Natural cytotoxic cells (NC) lyse WEHI-164 targets, are negative for the NK cell markers, and are responsive to IL-2 and IL-3 in vitro (Stutman et al., 1978; Lattime et al., 1983) . Spontane-ously cytotoxic T lymphocytes (SC) were described initially as arising from splenocytes cultured in the absence of mitogen, antigen, or interleukins. These cells bear high levels of Thy 1 and lyse P-815 cells (Ching et al., 1977) . The origin of and interrelationship among these cytotoxic cells is not clear, and is complicated by observations of the breakdown in specificity of cultured antigen-specific CTLs (Wilson and Shortman, 1984) . The levels of these types of nonspecific cytotoxic activity have been analyzed in various mucosal lymphoid populations. Peyer's patch lymphocytes obtained from conventionally reared mice have been shown to contain undetectable levels of cytotoxic activity to the NK-sensitive target Yac-1 in 4-hr (Tagliabue et al., 1981 (Tagliabue et al., ,1983 (Tagliabue et al., /1984 or 16-hr (Tagliabue et al., 1983 (Tagliabue et al., /1984 51 Cr release assays. NK activity was not induced by a 24-hr incubation of Peyer's patch lymphocytes with a source of IL-2 or IL-3 (Tagliabue et al., 1983 (Tagliabue et al., /1984 ). However, the incubation of Peyer's patch lymphocytes with irradiated peritoneal exudate cells and 10% concanavalin A (Con A)-conditioned medium has been shown to result in the generation of cytotoxic activity to Yac-1 target cells (London et al., 1986) . These results may be analogous to the observation that Peyer's patches lack terminally differentiated B cells (plasma cells) although they are capable of generating antibody secreting cells in in vitro cultures (Kiyono et al., 1982) . In contrast to NK cytotoxicity, normal Peyer's patch lymphocytes lyse the NC-sensitive target WEHI-164 in 16-hr 51 Cr release assays. Peyer's patch lymphocytes have higher levels of NC activity than either spleen or peripheral lymph node lymphocytes (Tagliabue et al., 1983 (Tagliabue et al., /1984 ). Peyer's patch lymphocytes obtained from conventionally reared mice also were found to contain a population of novel naturally cytotoxic effector cells that have been termed natural cytotoxic T cells (NCTC) (Gautam et al., 1986 ). NCTC effector cells were able to lyse a wide variety of syngeneic and allogeneic tumor cell lines as well as syngeneic or allogeneic Con A-induced T lymphoblasts. These cells are characterized as plastic nonadherent, nylon wool adherent Thy 1 + Ia + asialo-GMl + T cells (Gautam et al., 1986) and have been identified in several inbred strains of mice. Of all lymphoid tissues tested, only Peyer's patch lymphocytes were found to contain NCTC activity.\n\nIn addition to Peyer's patch lymphocytes, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) have been analyzed for the presence of naturally occurring cytotoxic cells. NC (Tagliabue et al., 1983 (Tagliabue et al., /1984 activity has been observed in purified populations of unprimed IELs. Whereas IELs of normal mice do not express cytotoxicity toward the SC target P-815 (Goodman and Lefrancois, 1988) , such cytotoxicity can be elicited in vitro by culturing IELs in the presence of Con A-conditioned medium or in vivo after immunization by the combined feeding and parenteral inoculation of allogeneic splenocytes or tumor cells (Klein and Kagnoff, 1984) . The literature regarding the presence of NK cytotoxicity among IELs is more complex, with some reports of this activity in normal mice Tagliabue et al., 1981 Tagliabue et al., ,1982 Tagliabue et al., , 1983 Tagliabue et al., /1984 Klein, 1986 ) and some reports of this activity only in mice experimentally stimulated with allogeneic splenocytes or tumor cells (Klein and Kagnoff, 1984; Carman et al., 1986; Goodman and Lefrancois, 1988) . The inconsistent finding of NK activity in isolated IELs may be related to differences in environmental conditions. For example, specific pathogen-free mice and germ-free mice, compared with conventionally reared mice, have lower numbers of IELs and phenotypically altered IEL populations (Carman et al., 1986; Lefrancois and Goodman, 1989; Guy-Grand et al., 1991a) . Utilizing an antigen nonspecific ''redirected\" cytotoxicity assay, some investigators have reported that the cytotoxic potential of IELs is unrelated to gut antigen stimulation (Guy-Grand et al., 1991b) whereas others have shown a striking environmental influence on the cytotoxic potential of particular IEL subpopulations (Lefrancois and Goodman, 1989) . The redirected cytotoxicity assay has demonstrated clearly that IELs from conventionally reared mice are constitutively lytic (Lefrancois and Goodman, 1989; Viney et al., 1990; Guy-Grand et al., 1991b) . Thus, environmental factors may have a strong influence on the nature and immune potential of IELs, so these factors should be considered in the planning and interpretation of experiments involving IELs. In addition, these results suggest that the activation of nonspecific cytotoxic effector populations that occurs during an antigen-specific response may be a nonspecific defense mechanism that is important for the protection of the gut mucosa from infection with environmental pathogens.\n\nThe cytotoxic lymphocyte response to gut mucosal infection with an enteric murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), has been analyzed. Although an antigen-specific CTL response was not detected, a novel non-MHCrestricted cytotoxic IEL effector cell population has been identified that is highly cytotoxic to target cells infected with this virus (Carman et al., 1986) . These predominantly asialo-GM1 + Thy 1\" Lyt 1\" Lyt 2~ cytotoxic effector cells were present in immune and normal mice. Elimination of asialo-GM1 + cells in vivo resulted in an increased persistence of virus in gut tissues as well as decreased cytotoxic activity of isolated IELs to MHV infection in vitro (Carman et al., 1986) . Although MHV-specific CTLs have been difficult to demonstrate and MHV-specific CTL clones have been obtained only recently (Yamaguchi et al., 1988) , antibodyindependent B lymphocyte-mediated lysis of MHV-infected cells has been shown to occur (Wysocka et al., 1989) . This lysis is likely to be mediated by selective fusion of B lymphocytes and MHV-infected cells, facilitated by the neutral pH membrane-fusing activity of MHV E2 protein. Note that a similar mechanism of nonspecific cytolysis may control MHV infection at mucosal surfaces and that this activity is carried out by a unique cell population present only in the intestinal epithelium. Kagnoff and Campbell (1974) were the first to demonstrate that Peyer's patch lymphocytes express CTL activity by generating allogeneic specific CTLs in secondary mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) of cultured Peyer's patch lymphocytes from normal mice. The precursor CTLs were identified as T cells by pretreatment with anti-theta serum and complement (Kagnoff and Campbell, 1974) (Kagnoff, 1978 ). In contrast to tumor cells bearing major MHC differences, tumor cells bearing minor MHC differences induced a CTL response in Peyer's patches after intrapeitonael priming but not after chronic feeding (Kagnoff, 1978) .\n\nThe intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic tumor cells has been shown to generate allogeneic specific CTLs recoverable from IELs and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) 6-11 days after immunization Parrott, 1980,1981; Parrott et al., 1983) . This cytotoxic activity was observed without re-stimulation of isolated effector cells in an in vitro MLR. Control mice do not respond to allogeneic targets, and the subcutaneous route of immunization does not generate high levels of CTL activity in the gut mucosa (Davies and Parrott, 1981; Parrott et al., 1983) . LPLs contained the highest levels of cytotoxic activity of all tissues tested after intraperitoneal immunization; this cytotoxicity lasted for prolonged periods (>40 days; Parrott et al., 1983) . The phenotype of both alloantigen-specific effectors and precursor CTLs (pCTLs) generated in vitro in primary isolated IEL MLR cultures was shown to be Thy \u0393 Lyt 2 + . The frequency of alloantigen-specific pCTLs was found to be approximately threefold higher among unfractionated splenocytes than in isolated IELs .\n\nAlloantigen-specific CTL clones have been obtained from isolated IELs derived from BALB/c mice that were immunized twice, intragastrically and intraperitoneally, with allogeneic tumor cells (EL-4) (Klein et al., 1985; Klein and Kagnoff, 1987) . Two types of effector clone were generated:\n\n(1) clones that were antigen specific with respect to proliferation and cytolytic activity and (2) clones that were antigen specific for proliferation but were not cytolytic when maintained in 4% Con A-conditioned medium. When cultured in the presence of 25% Con A-conditioned medium for 4 days, these clones exhibited broad lytic potential and were cytotoxic for EL-4 cells, P-815 cells (SC), and Yac-1 cells (NK), as well as for syngeneic and allogeneic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blasts. Although one clone (D3) was reported lytic for syngeneic LPS blasts, it does not lyse itself when 51 Cr-labeled D3 cells are used as targets. The phenotype of both types of clones was Thy 1 + Lyt 2 + (Klein et aL, 1985; Klein and Kagnoff, 1987) . These broadly cytotoxic clones may be an in vitro counterpart of the broadly cytotoxic NCTC cells observed in normal Peyer's patches. The presence of broadly cytotoxic cells in gut mucosal tissues might be one mechanism by which mucosal tissues are protected from infection with particular intracellular pathogens.\n\nAlthough early studies have indicated that gut mucosal tissues have the capability to contain CTLs, whether mucosal application of antigen is a necessary prerequisite for the generation of CTL activity in these tissues is not clear. Further, the generation of allospecific CTLs with precursors that are present at an extremely high frequency (Lindahl and Wilson, 1977) may not be a good indication of the potential of Peyer's patches to generate CTL activity directed to nominal antigens associated with environmentally encountered pathogens. Gut mucosal infection with vaccinia virus has provided direct evidence that some gut associated tissue contains virusspecific CTLs. After enteric injection, mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes had a strong vaccinia-specific T helper cell and CTL response (Issekutz, 1984) . Vaccinia-specific T helper cell and CTL responses were not observed in Peyer's patches. Since Peyer's patches are one source of lymphocytes that migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes, one interpretation of these results is that Peyer's patches are an inductive site from which virus-specific Th cells and CTLs were stimulated. In this scenario, the absence of detection of these cells in Peyer's patches is a consequence of their rapid migration to mesenteric lymph nodes.\n\nReovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (reovirus 1/L), is a naturally occurring enteric virus that is stable within the gastrointestinal tract (Sabin, 1959; Rubin and Fields, 1980) . The observation that reovirus 1/L preferentially binds to and is transported from the intestinal lumen into Peyer's patches through microfold (M) cells (Wolf et aL, 1981 (Wolf et aL, ,1983 ) and its ability to stimulate the appearance of IgA-committed memory cells in Peyer's patches and distal lymphoid tissues after intraduodenal immunization (London et aL, 1986) suggest that reovirus 1/L is an effective mucosal immunogen. Further, the marked expansion of cells expressing the GCT antigen (an antigen present on subpopulations of CD8 + T and germinal center B cells) after a single intraduodenal application of reovirus 1/L provides additional evidence of the ability of reovirus 1/L to stimulate Peyer's patch T and B cell subpopulations acutely (London et aL, 1990) .\n\nIn studies aimed at analyzing the potential of gut mucosal tissues to generate virus-specific CTLs, researchers found that a single intraduodenal application of reovirus 1/L generates the appearance of detectable levels of virus-specific cyto-toxicity in Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes on in vitro re-stimulation (London et aL, 1986) . Although this was the first demonstration of virus-specific pCTLs in Peyer's patches, these results confirm those found with vaccinia virus infection and offer further support that the CTL response observed in mesenteric lymph nodes in both systems may have originated from migrating Peyer's patch lymphocytes. Peyer's patch effectors show the surface phenotype of CTLs (Thy 1 + Lyt 2 + ), are MHC restricted, and are virus-specific (London et aL, 1986) . In addition, the phenotype of the pCTLs prior to their in vitro stimulation also was shown to be Thy 1 + Lyt 2 + (London et aL, 1990) . Although the virus-specific cytotoxic cells derived from Peyer's patches were found not to be selective for the immunizing serotype of reovirus, as was reported previously for nonmucosal lymphocytes (Finberg et aL, 1979) , they were not crossreactive with unrelated virus antigens (London et aL, 1986) . The lack of serotype specificity was found not to be unique to Peyer's patch-derived lymphocytes but also was displayed by intraperitoneally primed splenocytes (London et aL, 1986 (London et aL, ,1989a and is similar to the CTL response observed with a number of other viruses, including two other members of the Reoviridae family of viruses: blue-tongue virus (Jeggo and Wardley, 1982) and Group A rotavirus (Offit and Dudzik, 1988) (see subsequent discussion).\n\nSince reovirus-specific pCTLs have been demonstrated in Peyer's patches, determining whether they were generated locally or whether they represent a population of lymphocytes stimulated elsewhere that have localized preferentially in the patch was of interest. Two observations suggest that the former possibility occurs: (1) Peyer's patches contain virus-specific helper activity that has been shown to be required for the generation of effector CTLs on in vitro restimulation in the reovirus system (London et aL, 1986 ) and (2) significantly higher levels of virus-specific cytotoxicity are generated from cultures of Peyer's patches than from peripheral lymph nodes 2-6 days after intraduodenal immunization (London et aL, 1986) . The frequency of reovirusspecific pCTLs in these tissues was confirmed directly. A 100fold difference in frequency (1675/10 6 CD8 + Peyer's patch lymphocytes vs. 17/10 6 peripheral lymph node CD8 + lymphocytes) was found 6 days after enteric immunization. In addition, the gradient of pCTLs that initially was established early after infection was found to exist for a prolonged period after the single intraduodenal injection of reovirus 1/L. The frequency of pCTLs was an order of magnitude greater in Peyer's patches than in peripheral lymph nodes (14.5-fold higher; 1235/10 6 CD8 + vs. 85/10 6 CD8 + ) 6 months after reovirus infection (London et aL, 1986) . et al., 1990) .\n\nSimilarly, the adoptive transfer of reovirus-immune Thy 1 + CD8 + IELs confers protection on neonatal mice when challenged with a lethal neurotropic strain of reovirus .\n\nThe presence of precursors for virus-specific CTLs, diffusely scattered in the intestinal epithelium, and the ability of enterically applied reovirus 1/L to generate a CTL response in Peyer's patches that can persist for many months demonstrates that a CTL response exists among the repertoire of immune responses that can occur in Peyer's patches and the gut epithelium. For viruses that initially impinge on the wet epithelium, the presence of virus-specific CTLs and natural effector (i.e., NK) cells at this location could result in the local containment, limitation, and resolution of the infectious agent rather than its dissemination. The ability to mount a mucosal CTL response may be advantageous to the host, because local containment could prevent sequelae associated with infection at distal sites.\n\nThese viruses share similar structural features and replicative strategies, yet their interaction with the gut mucosa is strikingly different. Whereas reovirus infection of the gut mucosa is a potent stimulator of virus-specific and nonspecific responses, the virus infection is subclinical and is resolved in the gut within 10-12 days (Cebra et al., 1991) \n\nInfection of mice with several strains of rotavirus is a potent inducer of virus-specific CTLs. Rotavirus infection by either oral or parenteral route elicits effector CTLs in multiple lymphoid tissues that can be detected without in vitro amplification Dudzik, 1988,1989b; Offit and Svoboda, 1989; Offit et al., 1991b) . Effector and precursor CTLs are serotype nonspecific Thy 1 + CD8 + lymphocytes Dudzik, 1988,1989b; Offit and Svoboda, 1989; Dharakul et al., 1991; Offit et al., 1991a) . Although these effectors usually are elicited by infection with replicating virus, inoculation with noninfectious virus has been shown to be capable of eliciting rotavirus-specific CTLs (Offit and Dudzik, 1989a) .\n\nThe tissue distribution of rotavirus-specific CTLs has been analyzed after various routes of immunization. The salient observations from these studies follow: (1) Six days after oral immunization, effector CTLs were detected among Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, LPL, spleen, and IEL lymphocyte populations (Offit and Dudzik, 1989b; Offit et al., 1991b) . (2) Six days after intraperitoneal or subcutaneous immunization, effector CTLs were detected among Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, LPL, spleen, and peripheral lymph node lymphocytes. Effector CTLs were observed in IELs after intraperitoneal but not subcutaneous immunization (Offit and Dudzik, 1989b; Offit et al., 1991b) . (3) Four weeks after oral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous immunization, pCTLs (as assayed by in vitro culture) were detected in Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, LPL, spleen, and peripheral lymph node but not IEL lymphocyte populations (Offit and Dudzik, 1989b; Offit et al., 1991b) . (4) IEL effector CTLs obtained from orally infected mice were shown to be CD3 + and express the a\u00df form of the TcR (Offit et al., 1991b) . (5) When the frequency of pCTLs was analyzed 3, 6, and 21 days after immunization, the site of rotavirus infection determined that pCTL first appeared in Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph nodes three days after oral infection. Three days after footpad infection, pCTLs were detected first in the inguinal peripheral lymph node. At six days, pCTLs were 30-fold higher in Peyer's patches after oral infection and ~7fold higher in inginual peripheral lymph node after footpad infection. However, by 21 days, pCTLs were distributed uniformly throughout the lymphoid system (with the excep-tion of IEL), regardless of the route of immunization (Offit and Dudzik, 1988; Offit et aL, 1991b) . Thus, in contrast to results obtained with gut mucosal reovirus infection, which suggested that the route of immunization may be important for the generation and maintenance of a gut mucosal CTL response, the route of immunization with rotavirus does not appear to be as important for the generation of disseminated gut mucosal responses. The lack of persistence of rotavirusspecific pCTLs in the epithelium also contrasts with results obtained with gut mucosal reovirus infection. These discrepancies are likely to be the results of differences in virus dissemination and interaction with the immune system, and suggest that different strategies for particular mucosal pathogens may be devised that elicit protective T-cell immunity at mucosal surfaces.\n\nThe potential functional relevance of rotavirus-specific CTLs has been demonstrated in two animal model systems. In the first example, Thy 1 + CD8 + splenocytes obtained from intraperitoneally immunized mice passively protect suckling mice against diarrhea induced by rotavirus challenge (Offit and Dudzik, 1990 ). In the second, rotavirus infection was cleared in SCID mice after the transfer of immune CD8 + splenic lymphocytes from intraperitoneally immunized histocompatible mice (Dharakul et aL, 1990 (Dharakul et aL, ,1991 . Interestingly, CD8 + immune splenocytes or Thy 1 + CD8 + IELs obtained from orally immunized mice only temporarily cleared rotavirus infection of SCID mice (Dharakul et aL, 1990 (Dharakul et aL, ,1991 . Whether the suboptimal ability of orally immunized spleen and IELs to contain rotavirus infection in SCID mice is a result of intrinsic differences in cell population after oral or intraperitoneal immunization or is simply a technical problem remains to be resolved.\n\nThe lung is another mucosal site that has been shown to contain nonspecific and specific cytotoxic effector cells. Natural killer cell activity is normally present in the lung and is enhanced after influenza infection in mice (Wyde et aL, 1977) . Seven days after infection with influenza virus, \u03b3\u03b4 TcR-expressing cells are found to predominate in the lungs of mice (Carding et aL, 1990) . Although these cells are not constitutively cytotoxic when recovered directly from the respiratory tract, cytotoxic function can be induced by culturing them in the presence of monoclonal antibody to CD3 and low concentrations of IL-2 (Eichelberger et aL, 1991a) . Although the function of these \u03b3\u03b4 TcR-expressing cells remains an enigma, they may have a role in the containment and resolution of infections in the lung by either cytolytic or noncytolytic (i.e., secretion of cytokines) mechanisms.\n\nAntigen-specific CTLs also have been shown to be a component of the immune repertoire of the lung. Immunization with allogeneic tumor cells by both the intratrachial and the intraperitoneal route have resulted in the accumulation of alloantigen-specific CTLs in the lung and spleen (Liu et aL, 1982 , and references therein). Viral-specific CTLs also are generated after pulmonary infection with several viruses that replicate in the respiratory epithelium. For example, influenza virus-specific precursor and effector CTLs are found in the lung shortly after intratrachial infection (Bennink et \n\nThe idea that both antigen-specific and nonspecific cytotoxic cells are an integral component of mucosal tissues is becoming increasingly evident. Although much research has focused on the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, cytotoxic cells are likely to be components of the immune repertoire of other mucosal tissues. The specifics of the cytotoxic response are likely to vary depending on the nature and location of the immune stimulus. For example, studies of the eye have revealed site-specific immunoregulation of CTL development and have demonstrated the presence of the less commonly observed CD4 + MHC Class II-restricted CTLs in mucosal tissues. In the eye, the placement of tumor cells in two anatomically distinct regions (anterior chamber and subconjunctiva) elicits tumor-specific pCTLs (Ksander and Streilein, 1990 , and references therein). However, the pCTLs differentiate into cytotoxic effector CTLs only in the subconjunctiva, thereby allowing tumor rejection to occur only in this site. Recurrent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection of the corneal stroma of the eye often results in stromal pathology and, ultimately, in vision impairment. HSV-1-specific MHC Class II-restricted CD4 + CTLs have been implicated as constituting one of the mechanisms leading to stromal immunopathology in herpetic infections (Doymaz et al., 1991) .\n\nA better understanding of how to stimulate cytotoxic cells in mucosal tissues, their recirculation pathways between mucosal and systemic tissues, and their function in mucosal sites is warranted since these cells may limit pathogens or may be involved in pathogenesis at mucosal sites. The series of observations that CTLs are elicited in response to a number of nonviral intracellular pathogens suggests that such cells might be a more generalized component of the immune system. CTL responses have been identified for the protozoan parasites Leishmania (Smith et al., 1991) and Toxoplasma gondii (Hakim et al., 1991; Khan et al., 1991) , for malaria Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (Aggarwal et al., 1990, and references therein) , and for the gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Pamer et al., 1991) . In studies of immunity to malaria, researchers found that oral immunization with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium recombinants containing the full-length P. bergehei circumsporozoite gene induces protective immunity against intravenous sporozoite challenge in the absence of antibodies. Immunity was found to be mediated through the induction of circumsporozoite-specific CD8 + CTLs (Aggarwal et al., 1990) . Thus, the mucosal application of S. typhimurium, a bacterium known to interact with Peyer's patches, is capable of inducing a systemic CTL response that can control heterologous infections. This elegant study suggests that oral Salmonella vectors may be useful for the generation of specific CTL responses, which may be useful for the containment of viral or nonviral infections of mucosal or systemic tissues."}
