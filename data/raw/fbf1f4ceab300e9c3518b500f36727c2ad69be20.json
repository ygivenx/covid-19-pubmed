The first complete\n\nThe aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive analysis of codon usage and composition of 48 coronavirus and explore the possible leading evolutionary determinants of the biases found. [19]. For nCoV we note a different trend T>A>G>C, but in totally AT% is more used than GC% (See 54   Table 3 ). The GC content in 2019-nCoV is 0.373 \u00b1 0.05. 55 2.2. All the sequenced 2019-nCoV genomes share a common codon usage 56 We downloaded the protein-coding sequences of 2019-nCoV from GIDAID database, by did not cluster according to geographic location, thus confirming the common origin of these genomes. 63 Therefore, we will consider a unique vector to represent 2019-nCoV in the following analyses. 2.4. The codon usage of 2019-nCoV is not optimized to the host. 81 To measure the codon usage bias in the coronavirus genomes, we used the effective number 82 of codons (ENC) value and the Competition Adaptation Index (CAI). In Table 2 and 3, we report 83 the ENC and CAI values for all the coronaviruses we considered in this work. To visually enhance 84 the differences among the codon usage of these coronaviruses we calculated Zscore of a single virus 85 in relation to the other members of the CoV subfamily. Interestingly, the ENC value associated to 86 2019-nCoV (51.9 \u00b1 2.59) is lower than the average of all Coronaviruses, meaning that 2019-nCoV uses 87 a broader set of synonymous codons in its coding sequences. We also note that CAI of 2019-nCoV 88 (0.727 \u00b1 0.054) is lower than the average one, underscoring that this coronavirus tend to use codons 89 that are not optimized to the host.

Conversely, the steeper slopes for genes N, RdRP, 166 and S indicate that these genes tend to evolve faster compared to other ones. A plausible explanation 167 for this observation is that protein N due to its immunogenicity, has been frequently used to generate 168 specific antibodies against various animal coronavirus, including in SARS [24] . The viral replicase 169 polyprotein that is essential for the replication of viral RNA and, finally, the gene S encodes the protein 170 that is responsible for the \"spikes\" present on the surface of coronaviruses. Taken together, our results 171 suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these proteins could represent a major obstacle 172 to in the development of a antiviral therapeutics against 2019-nCoV. 173 author/funder.

In general, ENC ranges from 20 (when each aminoacid is coded by just one and the same codon) to 61 (when all synonymous codons are used on an equal footing). Given a sequence of interest, the computation of ENC starts from F \u03b1 , a quantity defined for each family \u03b1 of synonymous codons (one for each amino acid):\n\nwhere m \u03b1 is the number of different codons in \u03b1 (each one appearing n 1 \u03b1 , n 2 \u03b1 , ..., n m \u03b1 times in the sequence) and n \u03b1 = \u2211 m \u03b1 k=1 n k \u03b1 . ENC then weights these quantities on a sequence:\n\nwhere N S is the number of families with one codon only and K m is the number of families with 235 degeneracy m (the set of 6 synonymous codons for Leu can be split into one family with degeneracy 2, 236 similar to that of Phe, and one family with degeneracy 4, similar to that, e.g., of Pro). 237 We have evaluated ENC by using the implementation in DAMBE 5.0 [31]. \n\nCodon adaptation index CAI [? ] is used to quantify the codon usage similarities between the virus and host coding sequences. The principle behind CAI is that codon usage in highly expressed genes can reveal the optimal (i.e., most efficient for translation) codons for each amino acid. Hence, CAI is calculated based on a reference set of highly expressed genes to assess, for each codon i, the relative synonymous codon usages (RSCU i ) and the relative codon adaptiveness (w i ):\n\nIn the RSCU i , X i is the number of occurrences of codon i in the genome, and the sum in the denominator runs over the n i synonyms of i; RSCUs thus measure codon usage bias within a family of synonymous codons. w i is then defined as the usage frequency of codon i compared to that of the optimal codon for the same amino acid encoded by i-i.e., the one which is mostly used in a reference set of highly expressed genes. The CAI for a given gene g is calculated as the geometric mean of the usage frequencies of codons in that gene, normalized to the maximum CAI value possible for a gene with the same amino acid composition:\n\nwhere the product runs over the l g codons belonging to that gene (except the stop codon).\n\nThis index values range from 0 to 1, where the score 1 represents the tendency of a gene to always The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.006569 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo study the patterns of codon bias in the coronaviruses, we use Z-score values:\n\nwhere ENC f amily is the average of the ratio within a codon bias index in a family of a virus v, ENC v 246 and \u03c3 v are the average value of ENC and its standard deviation over the whole virus v, and N v is the 247 number of virus in the family (we use the standard deviation of the mean as we are comparing average 248 values).\n\nThe same Z-score is evalueted for codon bias index CAI. ENC-plot analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of mutational bias and natural selection in shaping CUB of genes encoding for proteins that are crucial for 2019-nCoV: RdRP, the spike-surface glycoprotein (protein S), the small envelop protein (protein E), the matrix protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The ENC-plot is a plot in which the ENC is the ordinate and the GC3 is the abscissa. Depending on the action of mutational bias and natural selection, different cases are discernable. If a gene is not subject to selection, a clear relationship is expected between ENC and GC3 [? ]: The following abbreviations are used in this manuscript: author/funder. All rights reserved.
