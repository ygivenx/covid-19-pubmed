{"title": "The scanning electron microscope in microbiology and diagnosis of infectious disease", "body": "Salmonella Senftenberg (kindly provided by Dr. George Golding, National Microbiology Laboratory) strains were grown overnight in 3 mL LB broth at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. Fifty \u03bcL of bacteria were then sub cultured into 3 mL LB broth and grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 4 hours to the approximate mid-log phase of growth. The bacteria were fixed at 1:1 v/v in 1% paraformaldehyde and 2% gluteraldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature. Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc (kindly provided by Dr. Robbin Lindsay, National Microbiology Laboratory) was grown in Ellinghausen and McCullough media modified by Johnson and Harris (EMJH) (Royal Tropical Institute, The Netherlands). The inoculate culture was placed at 30 \u00b0C for 14 days and then stored at room temperature in low light.\n\nBaby hamster kidney fibroblast cells (BHK-21:ATCC) were grown to 80% confluence in high-glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin. The BHK-21 cells were infected with 1 mL of Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus (kindly provided by Dr. Jingxin Cao, National Microbiology Laboratory) and incubated for 48 hours at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. The infected cells underwent 3 freeze-thaw cycles in the presence of the growth media, alternating between \u221280 \u00b0C and room temperature. MVA was collected in the supernatant after removing cells and debris by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 3 min.\n\nZaire Ebola virus (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Jones) was propagated, purified and rendered non-infectious as previously described1633.\n\nUnless otherwise stated sample preparation was performed in a class II biosafety cabinet. All samples were passed through SPI-pore polycarbonate track etch filters (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA) held inside a 13 mm Swinnex\u00ae filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). For bacterial sample preparation, 0.08 \u03bcm pore size filters were used, while the 0.05 \u03bcm pore size was used for MVA and Ebola virus preparations. Filters were first wetted using 2 mL Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) in a 3 mL Luer-Lok\u2122 syringe. To load the sample onto the filter, 100 \u03bcL of sample was added to 5 mL DPBS in a 5 mL syringe. After attaching the syringe to the filter holder, the sample was filtered through the filter using a Legato 200 syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) at a rate of 1000 \u03bcL/min. In some cases the concentration of the sample was too high which would overload the filter and fluid could not flow through. If such an event occurred the sample was diluted 1:5 or 1:10 until fluid could flow freely through the filter. The sample filters were washed using 3 mL syringes containing 2 mL each of 50%, 70%, 85%, 95% and 100% ethanol in increasing concentration. Following the last wash the filter was removed from the filter unit and allowed to air dry for 30 min. The filter was trimmed, cut in half and placed on a 9 mm carbon disc (SPI Supplies) and mounted on a 3/8\u201d aluminum stub (SPI Supplies). Flash Dry silver paint (SPI Supplies) was used on each of the four corners of the filter to create a contact between the filter and the stub. The samples were removed from the biosafety cabinet and sputtered with gold using a Quorum Q150R S (Quorum Technologies, East Sussex, UK) containing a 0.1 mm gold target. The sample was pumped down, purged with argon and sputtered with gold for 120 sec on a rotating stage.\n\nFor a filter with a single type of metal coating the following procedure was used (Supplementary Fig. S1a). For the forts step either 2 cm of 0.2 mm diameter Al wire or 3 cm of 0.2 mm Au wire was wrapped around the tungsten filament. SPI-pore polycarbonate track etch filters were placed on a filter paper in a glass dish and secured from movement with metal washers. The dish was then placed in a Turbo Carbon Coater (Agar Scientific Ltd, Stansted, Essex, United Kingdom). Once under vacuum, the voltage was gradually increased until the Al or Au wire had completely evaporated. The 2 cm of aluminum wire would create a metal film approximately 18 nm thick, and the 3 cm of Au would create a metal film approximately 27 nm thick. To produce a filter with two types of metal on it the following variant of the above procedure was used (Supplementary Fig. S1b). The filter was placed on top of the filter paper on the glass dish, and a razor blade was placed directly over one half of the filter. One of the above metals (Au or Al) was evaporated as described above. Following this, the razor blade as removed and a second razor blade was used to cover the region of the filter where the previous metal was evaporated, and the remaining area of the filter was then coated with the second metal.\n\nThe ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate was diluted to a final concentration of 2.5% in distilled water and placed at 40 \u00b0C for 30 min to reduce viscosity9. The metal-coated filters were placed inside the filter unit and wetted using 2 mL DPBS. A total of 100 \u03bcL of sample was added to 5 mL DPBS and filtered through the coated filter using the Legato filter pump. After the sample was washed with 5 mL distilled water the filter was removed from the filter assembly and excess liquid was wicked off with tissue paper. The filter was immediately trimmed, placed on a carbon disc mounted on an aluminum stub. The four corners of the filter were painted to the aluminum stub using Flash Dry silver paint. A total of 50 \u03bcL of ionic liquid was pipetted onto the sample and the excess was removed after 60 sec by blotting with filter paper. The samples were then viewed by SEM.\n\nAll samples were imaged in a JCM-5700 Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA, USA) contained inside a mobile biological containment enclosure (Dycor Technologies Ltd, Edmonton, AB, Canada)8. Gold coated specimens were imaged under high vacuum at 6 kV, with an 8 mm working distance and a 30 \u03bcm objective lens aperture. Images were collected using the secondary electron detector, the acquisition time per image was 160 sec and each image was 2560 \u00d7 1920 pixels. Images of ionic liquid stained samples were obtained using the above noted settings with the exception that the acceleration voltage was adjusted to 4 kV. SEM images were recorded at magnifications ranging from 3,000 x to 20,000x.\n\nSamples were adsorbed for 1 min to a formvar film on a carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grid. The adsorbed samples were washed 3X in distilled water and negatively contrasted with 2% methylamine tungstate (Nano-W; Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY, USA). Imaging was performed at 200 kV using a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Digital images of the specimens were acquired using an AMT Advantage XR 12 CCD camera (AMT, Danvers, MA, USA). TEM images were recorded at magnifications of 3,500 x to 19,000x.\n\nEbola virus, Salmonella Senftenberg, and Leptospira biflexa diameter measurements were made using the Image J software package34 using the straight line tool, and the analyze/measure function. Length measurements were calibrated using the scale bars on the image, and the analyze/set scale function in Image J. For this analysis, diameter measurements only were made, since the bacteria and viruses have varying lengths, but relatively constant diameters. Measurements were collated and analysed using MS Excel.\n\nHow to cite this article: Golding, C. G. et al. The scanning electron microscope in microbiology and diagnosis of infectious disease. Sci.
