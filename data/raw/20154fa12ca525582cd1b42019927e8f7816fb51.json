{"title": "Validation and automation of a high-throughput multi-targeted method for semi-quantification of 2 endogenous metabolites from different biological matrices using tandem mass spectrometry 4", "body": "after addition of an internal standards working solution, biofluid samples were extracted with 1% 96 formic acid in 99% acetonitrile. Tissue samples were extracted using homogenization in two steps.\n\nExtraction was first performed with 1% formic acid in 99% acetonitrile; the second extraction used 98 80/20% ACN/H2O+1% formic acid by protein precipitation followed by filtration through Ostro 99 plates. After this step, 5 \u03bcL of filtered sample extract was injected into an Acquity UPLC system 117 metabolites in a single method. However, they did not use an automated platform and a drying step 118 in their method increases the analysis time of the method overall. Our method has clear advantages 119 compared to other published methods, including shorter analysis time, high throughput, automation, 120 and semi-quantitation using individual external 11-point calibration curves along with 12 labeled 121 internal standards. Furthermore, the method has been used in many biomedical and clinical studies 122 for biomarker discovery [10, 11, .\n\nThe primary objective of this work is to show the robustness of our method through a thorough 124 validation of our previously developed analytical method according to European Medicines Agency 125 (EMA) guidelines. We also demonstrate automation of tedious and manual data processing tasks in 126 high-throughput metabolomics analyses using an in-house developed R package. The R package 127 automates various corrections and normalization steps to convert the raw peak area data to molecular 128 concentrations for each compound in each sample and also provides quality evaluation of the data 129 and reduces the manual work load significantly. International (Helsinki, Finland). Analytical-grade chemicals (formic acid, ammonium formate, and 137 ammonium hydroxide) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water (18 M\u2126.cm at 25\u00b0C) 138 used for solution preparation was made using a Milli-Q water purification system (Bamstead\n\nEASYpure RoDi ultrapure water purification system, Thermo scientific, Ohio, USA). Mouse tissues, 140 including heart, liver, brain, spleen, and muscles were obtained from Innovative Research Laboratory 141 (Novi, MI, USA). Whole blood was obtained from the Finnish Red Cross blood service (Helsinki, 142 Finland), from which serum was prepared during method optimization and validation. Cell samples 143 author/funder.

To assess the linearity, accuracy, and precision, six replicates of spiked QC samples at high, 182 medium, and low concentrations along with calibration curve were injected on three separate days.\n\nCalibration curve standards of 11 points were prepared via serial dilution. The curve was plotted by 184 using the peak area response ratios (standard/labeled standard) versus the concentrations of the 185 individual metabolites. The calibration curve was constructed using the regression equations (linear 186 and quadratic) by applying appropriate weighing factor and by transforming the axis (both 187 instrument response and theoretical concentration) into logarithmic or square root function.

The primary objective of this work was to optimize and validate our previously published 283 protocol for different types of biological matrices. For tissue samples (placenta, liver, heart, brain, 284 spleen, and muscles), the sample volumes of the tissues and extraction solvent volumes were 285 optimized to fit the concentrations of most of the metabolites within the linearity of calibration curve 286 for reliable results. We observed that most of the metabolites can be semi-quantified within the 287 calibration curve range with 20\u00b15mg of sample weight.\n\nFurthermore, we optimized the protocol with extraction solvent for tissues and adherent cells.\n\nSome of the metabolites (in particular inositol, GABA, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric 290 dimethylarginine, spermidine, ribose-5-phosphate, and orotic acid) had poor separation and 291 irreproducible chromatography. Interference of isobaric compounds with other metabolites was also 292 observed due to poor separation. Thus, different compositions of the extraction solvent were assessed 293 to achieve the acceptable chromatography. We observed that modification of acetonitrile content 294 from 80% to 90% and applying longer equilibration time for the HILIC column yielded acceptable 295 chromatography and also good separation for most of the metabolites.\n\nWe also optimized the extraction protocol for different sample types from various organisms, 297 such as tissue types (adipose, endometrium, testicles, lung), fecal samples, dried blood samples, To cover a broad concentration range, the linear or quadratic models were used and the variables 319 from X and Y axes were logarithm or squareroot transformed to fit the calibration data [43] . The 320 coefficient of determination (R 2 ) value for each metabolite was greater than 0.980 at their respective 321 concentration range, except for some metabolites such as aspartate, uracil, 2-deoxyuridine sucrose, 322 and chenodeoxycholic acid (likely due to their broad peak shapes and poor recovery at lower 323 concentration, Table S1 ).\n\nConcentration precision for QC samples was calculated by measuring %CV at high, medium, 325 and low concentration level of QCs (N=6 replicates). In general, intra-and inter-day precision (CV) 326 values were within 15% for most of the metabolites except acetoacetic acid, folic acid, sucrose, 327 homoserine, 2-deoxyuridine, and cholic acid ( Figure 3) . However, at low concentrations, more than 328 20% CV were observed for NAD and myo-inositol. This might be due to the low recoveries of these 329 compounds.\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

However, compounds such as UDP-glucose, IMP, cGMP, D-ribose 337 5-phosphate, NAD, AMP, homocysteine, carnosine, and glutathione had recoveries less than 30% in 338 serum. However, CV of recoveries at low, medium, and high concentration levels were within 25% 339 except for cGMP in serum. Metabolites such as 1-methylhistamine, aspartate, glutamine, adenosine, 340 and glutathione had recoveries over 120%. Histidine, ornithine, cystathionine, 3-OH-DL-kynurenine, 341 carnosine, AMP, NAD, cGMP, IMP, and UDP-glucose had less than 30% recovery in some tissues 342 types, indicating matrix effect or degradation (Figure 4) . However, CV of repeatability at all 343 concentration levels were within 15% except for 1-methylhistamine, aspartate, glutamine, 344 glutathione, NAD, and UDP-glucose in some tissues.\n\nThe matrix effect values were observed to be within the range of 0.6 to 1.8 (below 1 indicates ion 346 suppression and above 1 indicates ion enhancement) for the metabolites in serum and tissues. The 347 challenge of the matrix effect can be overcome by having individual isotope-labeled internal 348 standards for each individual compound for true quantification. However, this is not practically 349 possible for high-throughput metabolomics analyses, where usually the aim is relative comparison 350 of cases vs controls. This is due to high costs and also because not all internal standards are 351 author/funder. All rights reserved.

In our method, we selected 12 labeled internal standards (Table S1 ), which 352 represent chemically similar classes for optimal correction. This is because the matrix effect was 353 expected to be the same for an analyte and its labeled isotope analogue. The process efficiency 354 percentages were calculated for the metabolites without internal standards. The analyte 355 concentrations determined through the external calibration were divided with the total process 356 efficiency values to correct the concentration values of the analyte in the given biological sample.\n\nAlso, the repeatability of matrix effect in terms of CV was less than 25% for most of the compounds.\n\nReliable measurements are accordingly possible. 359 author/funder.

This information is particularly important for clinical studies, where samples 372 are often thawed once or twice.\n\nTo determine the stability of working solutions, we started evaluating the stability from The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/352468 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/352468 doi: bioRxiv preprint In general, for majority of the analyte MRM channels neither peak nor any interference in the 388 blank samples was detected after injection of metabolite standard with high concentration. For 389 compounds such as spermidine, succinate, AMP, and IMP, carryover eluted constantly even after 390 washing but was not significantly high. Other than these compounds, we can conclude that the 391 column, needle, syringe, and seal washes were sufficient to avoid any inter-sample carryover.

To reduce the bias from sample analysis, we always double-randomized the 419 samples (i.e., one before the sample extraction step and one before injecting into the LCMS system 420 across different phenotypes of the samples). For stabilization of response and retention time, we 421 always verified a few runs of highest calibration level 11 before injecting the experimental samples.\n\nDuring the stabilization process, we also verified the chromatography including peak shape, 423 retention time, and response of all the metabolites. Any significant changes in the intensity, peak 424 shape, retention time, and system pressure were thoroughly investigated and corrected by resolving 425 the problems before injection of experimental samples.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of LCMS runs, QC samples were run at every tenth experimental sample 427 and a blank sample at every fifth run during all the metabolomics studies within a batch.\n\nFurthermore, chromatography and response of QC samples (including chromatography of some 429 metabolites and IS response variation) and blank runs were always verified after completion of the 430 runs and before starting data processing. In case of any abnormality observed for particular samples, 431 those samples were reinjected or reanalyzed. Only after passing these quality checks we proceed 432 further to process the data. This included verifying the accuracy of calibration curve standards, 445 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This package takes 483 the raw data produced by TargetLynx software as input and produces processed data into ready-to-484 use spreadsheets. Using the R package, all the PPB values are converted into \u00b5mol/L, \u00b5mol/g, or 485 \u00b5mol/million cells by diving with molecular weight of the respective metabolites and correction 486 factor (weight of tissues, number of cells, and dilution factor) with respect to sample types.

We validated the analytical 510 method according to EMA guidelines for bioanalytical methods and showed good accuracy, 511 reproducibility, selectivity, specificity, recoveries, and stability. We have also implemented a strict 512 quality management and electronic notebook system. Reproducibility was demonstrated by 513 consistent results for retention time and correlation coefficient of calibration curves, and 514 concentrations of QC samples over a period of 1 year. Reliability was shown by the excellent 515 correlation between metabolite concentrations measured using our method and the NIST reference 516 values. Moreover, robustness was shown via good cross-platform comparability between two 517 completely different analytical platforms. Furthermore, we have automated the downstream data 518 processing steps to handle sample analyses in a high-throughput manner, which is particularly 519 valuable for analyzing population cohorts and large clinical samples for metabolomics studies. We 520 have successfully applied this method in many biomedical research projects and clinical trials, 521 including epidemiological studies for biomarker discovery.\n\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/link, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/352468 doi: bioRxiv preprint"}
