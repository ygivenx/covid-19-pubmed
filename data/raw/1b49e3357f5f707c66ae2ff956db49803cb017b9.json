{"title": "", "body": "toxoplasmosis may or may not be present, and include fever, inappetence, lethargy, dyspnea, muscle pain, CNS signs, and jaundice or increased liver enzymes.\n\n\u2022 Fly larval migration (ophthalmomyiasis) (p 1182)\n\nTypically presents with a unilateral blindness. Examination of the fundus shows a cloudy vitreous, and linear track marks in the retina, which appear as linear areas of pigment change, and hemorrhage in early cases.\n\n\u2022 Toxic retinal degeneration (p 1185) Sudden blindness after drug administration. Fluoroquinolones, particularly enrofloxacin, may rarely cause blindness, especially at high doses. This syndrome has also been described after concurrent administration of methylnitrosurea and ketamine hydrochloride. Cortical blindness can occur following hypoxia associated with anesthesia.\n\n\u2022 Traumatic retinal detachment (p 1177)\n\nThere will be a history of trauma. Usually presents acutely as a painful, red eye caused by intra-ocular hemorrhage (hyphema), and usually unilateral. Scleral and conjunctival hemorrhage may also be present. Ocular ultrasound is very useful to assess the state of the retina, lens and posterior sclera.\n\nOPTIC NERVE ANOMALY \u2022 Optic nerve coloboma (p 1187) Rare in cats. It may be present in cats with eyelid coloboma (agenesis). Optic disc has dark, hollow appearance (inverted funnel shape).\n\nMIDBRAIN AND VISUAL CORTEX ACCIDENT \u2022 Ischemic encephalopathy (p 1188) Ischemic encephalopathy results from several disease processes including embolism (feline ischemic encephalopathy), and hypotension, which is usually associated with anesthesia. Hypoxia during anesthesia may result in cortical blindness. It most often occurs after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, or following an anesthetic protocol that predisposes to hypoxia. Feline ischemic encephalopathy presents as sudden onset of unilateral thalamocortical neurological signs including mental depression and confusion, compulsive circling, and hemiparesis and rarely, severe cluster seizures or status epilepticus. Occasionally, it is bilateral and associated with blindness.\n\nBlindness is associated with neurological signs. Blindness is caused by lesions affecting the optic chiasm (dilated pupils) or cerebral cortex (slow to normal pupils). The retina appears normal.\n\nThe ocular media are the transparent parts of the eye, through which light passes to the retina. They consist of the cornea, anterior chamber, lens and vitreous. Any mechanism that causes loss of clarity in these media will cause loss of vision. \u2022 Corneal diseases that cause loss of transparency will affect vision, and are described in the chapter \"The Cat With Diseases Confined to the Cornea\" (page 1233). \u2022 A cloudy anterior chamber may affect vision. This is usually seen in cases that have uveitis (inflammation of the vascular coat of the eye). Problems that cause a cloudy anterior chamber are discussed in the chapter \"The Cat With a Cloudy Eye\" (page 1254). \u2022 Hemorrhage in the anterior chamber will cause vision loss. This is called hyphema and is discussed in the chapter \"The Cat With a Red Eye\" (page 1196). \u2022 A cloudy lens is called a cataract and will cause vision loss. See the chapter \"The Cat With a Cloudy Eye\" (page 1254). \u2022 Inflammation or hemorrhage in the vitreous will cause a vision defect. See the chapter \"The Cat With a Cloudy Eye\" (page 1254) or \"The Cat With a Red Eye\" (page 1191).\n\nThe retina is complex neural tissue that transforms photic energy into electrical energy. This energy transformation occurs in cells known as rods and cones. These cells form the outer layer of the neural retina.\n\nThe cones are used for day vision and color, and the rods for night vision and movement. Cats have roddominated retinas. The rods and cones are supported metabolically by the retinal pigment epithelium, which lies internally to the choroid (vascular tunic of the eye).\n\nThe rods and cones communicate with bipolar, horizontal, amacrine and Mueller cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina. These cells modify and integrate the stimulus produced in the rods and cones and transfer this information to the ganglion cells, which lie in the inner retina. Axons from ganglion cells join to form the optic nerve.\n\nInformation from the rods and cones is thus passed via the inner nuclear layer cells and ganglion cells, to the visual cortex, where it is processed as vision.\n\nThe most common cause of blindness in cats is secondary to problems associated with this complex tissue and includes: \u2022 Genetic disorders that effect metabolism of the rods and cones such as progressive retinal atrophy in the Abyssinian cat. epithelium from the rich vascular supply of the choroid, to cause retinitis and retinal detachment. \u2022 Systemic conditions that affect the vascular system can cause changes in the retina. Systemic hypertension causes inner retinal hemorrhage and detachment. Anemia, polycythemia vera and hyperviscocity syndromes can cause vision problems. \u2022 Glaucoma (increased intra-ocular pressure) causes retinal degeneration by complex mechanisms that are not well understood, but include retinal vascular ischemia, and pressure-related changes in the axoplasmic flow of optic nerve fibers.\n\nThe optic nerve connects the eye to the midbrain. Inflammation of the optic nerve and conditions that affect the anterior brain and/or midbrain will cause vision loss, by preventing stimuli from the ganglion cells from reaching the central processing area of the visual cortex. Efferent nerve fibers controlling pupil function will usually be affected causing changes in pupillary light reflexes. See the main references on page 1279 \"The Cat With Abnormal Pupil Size, Shape or Response\" and optic neuritis is a rare condition in the cat. Causes of optic nerve disease in cats are usually confined to: \u2022 Inflammation or neoplasia affecting the optic chiasm. \u2022 Inflammation or neoplasia of the mid-brain.\n\nSometimes ocular lesions are present, but do not account for the blindness.\n\nPupil size and pupillary light reflexes help localize the site of the lesion causing blindness. \u2022 If the lesion is at the cortical level, there will usually be a normal to slow pupil light reflex. \u2022 If the lesion is anterior and involves the optic chiasm, there will be a loss of pupillary light reflex. \u2022 If the lesion is in the mid-brain, there will be anisocoria (uneven-sized pupils).\n\nThe visual cortex occupies approximately one third of the cerebrum. Vision is an extremely complex process that is not fully understood. The ocular structures may be perfectly normal, but if the brain cannot process the information sent from the eye, the animal will appear to be blind. Animals with central blindness generally have normal pupil reflexes, although they may be slow.\n\nConditions that affect the visual cortex include: \u2022 Ischemia from oxygen starvation or trauma.\n\n\u2022 Vascular accidents causing ischemia. \u2022 Inflammation of brain or meninges. \u2022 Neoplasia of cerebral or meningeal tissue, causing pressure-related cell degeneration.\n\nUsually other neurological signs are present suggesting there is a central lesion such as seizures, proprioceptive deficits, ataxia and weakness.\n\nStructures that may be involved in blindness include: \u2022 The ocular media (cornea, anterior chamber, lens and vitreous). \u2022 Retina. \u2022 Optic nerve. \u2022 Mid-brain. \u2022 Visual cerebral cortex.\n\nChanges to the ocular media appear as a cloudy eye. See the main reference on pages 1254, 1233 \"The Cat With a Cloudy Eye\" and \"The Cat With Abnormalities Confined to the Cornea\".\n\nCats that have blindness associated with abnormal pupil reflexes and normal retinas generally have optic nerve or mid-brain disease.\n\nBlind cats with normal retinas and normal pupil reflexes usually have central blindness, with lesions involving the visual cortex.\n\nPupillary light reflexes form an important part of eye examinations, and help determine the part of the visual system that is causing blindness.\n\nThe summation of retinal electrical responses to light can be measured electrophysiologically using a procedure known as electroretinography (ERG).\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of vision loss in an old cat, usually bilateral. \u2022 Dilated pupils, non-responsive or poorly responsive to light. \u2022 Cloudy vitreous with red areas of hemorrhage.\n\nHypertension causes vasoconstriction of pre-capillary retinal arterioles. Hypoxia of the arteriole causes smooth muscle necrosis, which leads to vascular dilatation, and leakage of serum and blood.\n\nLeakage from vessels causes serous retinal detachment, and subretinal, intra-retinal or preretinal hemorrhage.\n\nRetinal blood vessels may rupture, causing hemorrhage into the vitreous.\n\nHypertensive retinopathy occurs most commonly secondary to chronic renal disease, hyperthyroidism and cardiac disease.\n\nClassical signs are acute onset of vision loss in an old cat, which is usually bilateral. The cat suddenly starts to bump into things, appears to be lost, and has very cautious movements.\n\nThe pupils are usually dilated, and non-responsive or poorly responsive to light.\n\nAffected eyes appear slightly cloudy, and there may be focal red areas visible through the pupil, as a result of retinal hemorrhage. The vitreous may appear red. Early cases may show hemorrhage along the larger retinal blood vessels.\n\nHyphema may be seen in the anterior chamber.\n\nIt is difficult to visualize the retina on fundoscopic examination, as it appears out of focus. This is caused by retinal detachment, with the retina ballooning into the vitreous, and appears as a thin veil of pale tissue.\n\nThese cats may have cardiomegaly, and left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nThere may be other signs suggestive of hypertension, for example, a bounding cardiac apex beat.\n\nSystolic arterial blood pressure is usually greater than 160 mmHg.\n\nOther signs suggestive of renal and/or thyroid disease, such as progressive weight loss, polydypsia, polyuria and azotemia may be present.\n\nClinicians should suspect this problem in any old cat that has suddenly gone blind.\n\nOphthalmoscopy will demonstrate vitreal hemorrhage. The retina will appear out of focus, and hemorrhage adjacent to the major retinal blood vessels is visible.\n\nComplete retinal detachment is common.\n\nBlood pressure is most commonly measured in the cat using Doppler technology. Arterial blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg confirms a diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy. Most cats with clinical signs have a blood pressure of greater than 200 mmHg.\n\nBUN, creatinine and urine protein:creatinine ratios are useful clinical pathology parameters to check renal function.\n\nThyroid function should be checked by measuring plasma thyroxine (T4) concentration.\n\nFurther useful procedures include cardiac ultrasound, and in some cases, imaging of the thyroid with radioisotopes.\n\nAmlodipine (Norvasc, Pfizer) is a calcium channel blocker, which has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. The dose is approximately 0.625 mg/cat per day, i.e. 1/4 of a 2.5 mg tablet (USA) or 1/8 of a 5 mg tablet (Australia).\n\nThe use of corticosteroids is controversial.\n\nIf hypertension is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, then calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem may be used. For more detail see main reference on page 130 for details (The Cat With Abnormal Heart Sounds and/or an Enlarged Heart).\n\n\u03b2-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal) can also be used in the management of the cardiac disease at 1/4 of a 10 mg tablet q 8 h.\n\nHyperthyroidism when present, should be treated using surgery, radioactive iodine (131-I) or anti-thyroid drugs such as carbimazole or methimazole. For more detail see main reference on page 306 (The Cat With Weight Loss and a Good Appetite).\n\nCats with renal disease should be placed on appropriate medical and dietary management. For more details see the main reference on page 337 (The Thin, Inappetent Cat).\n\n\u2022 Anterior uveitis (cloudy eye) is the most common sign. \u2022 +/-Lymphocytic plasmacytic uveitis -gray to tan-colored nodules on the iris surface. \u2022 Chorioretinitis and optic neuritis that may cause blindness. \u2022 Rarely, systemic signs may be seen concurrently with ocular signs. These include fever, weight loss, +/muscular pain, +/signs of respiratory or neurological disease.\n\nSee the main reference on page 375 (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nInfection with Toxoplasma gondii occurs by three mechanisms.\n\n\u2022 Ingestion of tissue cysts (bradyzoites) from an intermediate host such as cockroaches, earthworms, rodents, reptiles and birds (most common) is the common route of infection in cats, and occurs in kittens once they start to hunt. Infection may occur from eating uncooked meat from cattle, sheep, chickens and pigs, which consumed food or water contaminated by cat feces. \u2022 Ingestion of sporulated oocysts from food or water contaminated by cat feces (far less common). \u2022 Transplacental transmission occurs, but is less common.\n\nAfter ingestion, a gut replication cycle occurs. The cat is the definitive host and is the only species in which this occurs. This results in the production of unsporulated (non-infective) oocysts, which are passed in feces. These become infective after 1-5 days, by sporulation (this requires aeration) in the environment. The spores formed are called sporocysts, and are filled with sporozoites.\n\nThe extra-intestinal development of T. gondii is similar in all species. Upon ingestion, sporozoites and bradyzoites transform into tachyzoites, which is the rapidly multiplying form of T. gondii. These may replicate in any cell type, and are disseminated to various organs in the body. Tachyzoites multiply intracellularly for a period of time, and then become tissue cysts containing numerous bradyzoites, which is the slowly replicating form of T. gondii. Release of bradyzoites from these cysts restarts the intracellular replication in cells.\n\nCysts may develop in the CNS, muscles, visceral organs (particularly lungs and liver) and ocular tissues. They may persist in a dormant state for life. Biologically they are a resting state, waiting for ingestion by a predator. Following ingestion by a mammal or bird they form tachyzoites.\n\nActivation of bradyzoites in tissue cysts may occur associated with other disease states, such as FIV, FeLV, hemobartonellosis and FIP, which act as stressors or immunosuppressors. High-dose corticosteroid use has been known to activate dormant T. gondii infections.\n\nWhen bradyzoites are activated, they undergo rapid replication, causing destruction of tissue. This incites an inflammatory response in various tissues, notably the central nervous system, uveal tract of the eye, muscle, liver and lungs. This also causes a host of immune responses, including hypersensitivity, antibody and immune-complex reactions.\n\nIt is unclear whether the inflammation in ocular toxoplasmosis is caused by cellular destruction, and the resultant local hypersensitivity, antibody, and immunecomplex reactions, or whether the eye is secondarily involved from reactions occurring in tissues outside the eye.\n\nOcular toxoplasmosis in humans causes a posterior uveitis, with a necrotizing chorio-retinitis. In cats, the most common presenting sign is anterior uveitis, and in cases with disseminated disease, chorioretinitis and optic neuritis may be seen.\n\nHistologically, ocular lesions in cats appear as granulomatous to lymphocytic/plasmocytic, multifocal chorioretinitis and/or iridocyclitis.\n\nThe most common ocular presenting sign is anterior uveitis, appearing as a cloudy eye. This may be unilateral or bilateral.\n\n\u2022 Affected eyes appear cloudy in acute cases, and may show hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber) and keratic precipitates, which are focal accumulations of protein, and white blood cells on the corneal endothelium.\n\nCats that present with lymphocytic, plasmocytic nodules on the iris, seen as diffuse focal grayish nodules protruding from the anterior iris surface, may have ocular toxoplasmosis.\n\nBlind cats with toxoplasmosis have chorioretinitis. This is seen as small, multifocal, raised areas in the retina that have pigment changes. These cats may also have optic neuritis, with an inflamed optic disc that is hyperemic and raised.\n\n\u2022 Fever, weight loss and muscle pain.\n\n\u2022 Respiratory disease, especially pneumonia.\n\n\u2022 Multifocal neurologic disease.\n\n\u2022 Liver disease.\n\n\u2022 Systemic signs of toxoplasmosis are very rare in adult cats. They are most common in perinatal kittens.\n\nIt is very difficult to make a definitive diagnosis with demonstration of the organism in cases with T. gondii infection. A tentative diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical signs, supported with laboratory tests. Comparison of levels of aqueous humor T. gondii antibody levels with serum levels (Goldman-Witmer coefficient or C-value) has been advocated to determine that anterior uveitis has been caused by T. gondii, although the use of C-values is still controversial. The Goldman-Witmer coefficient compares the T. gondiispecific immunoglobulin concentration with the total immunoglobulin concentration in serum and aqueous humor. A T. gondii-specific antibody C-value > 1 in aqueous humor indicates possible local production, rather than leakage from the serum through a faulty blood-ocular barrier. T. gondii-specific C values > 3 are advocated as criteria for evidence of local antibody production.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include other conditions that present as anterior uveitis.\n\n\u2022 Cats with FIP present with anterior uveitis (hypopyon and keratic precipitates). This is not as common in many geographical areas, and most commonly occurs in young cats from 6 months to 1 year of age. Currently, there is no definitive test for FIP. Serology is confused by intestinal coronavirus infections. Cats with FIP often have increased total protein and IgG concentrations in response to viral antigen, and also from cell damage resulting from the intense tissue inflammation. It is not pathognomonic for FIP, and reflects the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease. \u2022 FIV uveitis can cause a mild anterior uveitis, and anterior chamber flare. The condition can be diagnosed with serology using an ELISA test. \u2022 FeLV uveitis can cause signs similar to acute T.\n\ngondii infection, with an inflamed swollen iris and hypopyon. The retina may be infiltrated with tumor cells, and the retina may occasionally be detached from neoplasia infiltrating the choroid.\n\n\u2022 Fungal diseases especially cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, candidiasis and coccidioidomycosis. These diseases present with signs of uveitis and multifocal granulomatous chorioretinitis that appears as small brownish nodules in the retina, and may cause blindness. Systemic signs of fever, inappetence, weight loss and dyspnea are often present. Serological tests are available to differentiate these infections.\n\nA combination of drugs that inhibit the production of folinic acid necessary for T. gondii proliferation has been the mainstay of treatment in people. The most common combination is pyrimethamine, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, and a sulfonamide, which inhibits production of folic acid. Unfortunately, cats do not tolerate sulfa drugs as well as people, and often develop gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nTrimethoprim/sulfadiazine (30 mg/kg PO q 12 h) may be given alone, or with pyrimethamine (0.5 mg/kg PO q 24 h). Supplement with folinic acid (1 mg/kg PO q 24 h).\n\nOther antimicrobial drugs that are used to control T. gondii infection include tetracyclines, clindamycin, clarithromycin and atovoquone.\n\nClindamycin (Antirobe, Upjohn) at a dose rate of 12.5 mg/kg q 12 h for 3-4 weeks is the most common treatment used in cats.\n\nConcurrent anti-inflammatory therapy for anterior uveitis, e.g. topical 0.5% prednisolone acetate drops applied q 6-12 h are used to suppress the inflammation associated with the infection, and prevent secondary complications such as glaucoma.\n\n\u2022 Sudden blindness with retinal detachment. Vitreous flare may be present making the retina difficult to examine. \u2022 Anterior uveitis (anterior chamber flare, miosis, inflamed discolored iris). \u2022 Exophthalmos (eye bulging forward). \u2022 +/mucopurulent discharge with sneezing and a swollen nose. \u2022 Neurological signs. \u2022 Chronic skin granulomas.\n\nCryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection affecting cats which occurs throughout the world.\n\nCryptococcus neoformans is a budding, capsulated yeast-like fungus found in soil or in avian excreta. In Australia, there is an association of the organism C. neoformans var. gatti with the bark of a Eucalypt tree, the River Red Gum (River and Forest varieties), which has been exported world wide as a timber tree.\n\nIn general, all deep fungal infections enter the body by the inhalation of aerosolized spores leading to either fungal rhinitis (e.g. Cryptococcus) or pneumonia (e.g. blastomycosis, histoplasmosis), with subsequent dissemination to other parts of the body, including the eye, by hematogenous or lymphatic spread.\n\nThe initial ocular site for establishment of infection is usually the choroid, and the anterior uveal tract is often involved later in the course of the infection.\n\nCats may present with sudden blindness caused by multifocal granulomatous chorioretinitis with varying degrees of retinal detachment. \u2022 Vitreous flare (cloudy vitreous) is present, and makes the retina difficult to examine in cases with severe inflammation. \u2022 If the retina can be visualized, the granulomas appear as small swollen brownish discolored areas in the tapetal and non-tapetal retina.\n\nThere is usually anterior uveitis with corneal edema, anterior chamber flare (with or without hypopyon and keratic precipitates), swollen iris with varying degrees of posterior synechia causing a distorted pupil, and in chronic cases, new vascular growth on the anterior surface of the iris (pre-iridal fibrovascular membrane formation).\n\nSome cats present with exophthalmos (eye bulging forward), where there has been an extension of the disease from the sinuses and nasal cavity into the orbital tissues.\n\nIn cases with nasal infection, there may be a mucopurulent discharge with sneezing. Distortion and swelling over the bridge of the nose, or a polyp-like mass projecting from the nasal cavity are present in 70% of cats with the respiratory form.\n\nChronic skin granulomas may be present. Skin lesions consist of papules or nodules varying from 0.1-1 cm in diameter. Lesions may ulcerate and exude serous fluid, or remain as intact nodules.\n\nCats with disseminated disease may show neurological signs.\n\nCats may present with chronic nasal or skin disease, and the ocular involvement is identified secondarily on physical examination. Cats may also be presented primarily for the ocular signs, where the owner has seen the development of a cloudy eye and the cat has gone blind.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on typical clinical signs of nasal or skin disease and concurrent ocular signs. The presence of small swollen brownish discolored areas in the retina suggests fungal disease. The frequency of occurrence of individual fungal diseases in the geographical area helps establish a tentative diagnosis.\n\nCytology can be very useful in the diagnosis of C. neoformans. Demonstration of the organism can be made via anterior chamber centesis or by fine-needle biopsy (using a 25 gauge needle) taken from the sub-retinal space. The sample is best stained with new methylene blue, Indian ink or Diff-Quick.\n\nSerology to detect capsule antigen is sensitive using serum, CSF fluid or urine.\n\nHistopathology from tissue biopsies demonstrates the organism.\n\nRadiology of the nasal cavity, sinuses and chest may be useful in cases that do not demonstrate nasal or skin signs.\n\nOcular ultrasound can be used to detect retinal detachment when anterior chamber flare, cataract or vitreal flare prevents ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus. It is also used in cases of exophthalmos to examine, and do ultrasound-guided biopsies of the orbital tissue.\n\nOther fungal diseases such as blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, candidiasis and coccidioidomycosis can cause similar signs. They also present with signs of uveitis and multifocal granulomatous chorioretinitis that appear as small brownish nodules in the retina, and may cause blindness. Consideration of individual fungal diseases as differential diagnoses will depend on which diseases are found in the geographical region. Serological tests are available to differentiate these infections.\n\nOcular toxoplasmosis. Cats present with similar signs of anterior uveitis, blindness and chorioretinitis, although the ocular inflammation is not usually as severe.\n\nLaboratory tests may be needed to differentiate these diseases. Tests for toxoplasmosis can be confusing to interpret, but serological tests for Cryptococcus antigen are sensitive and specific.\n\nOcular manifestations of FIV, FIP and FeLV are usually signs of anterior uveitis, rather than sudden blindness from retinal involvement. However, retinal disease and sudden blindness can be an uncommon presenting sign with these viruses. FIP is difficult to confirm with diagnostic tests, and is diagnosed by a process of elimination. FIV and FeLV can be diagnosed with serological tests, although these diseases can occur concurrently with cryptococcosis.\n\nSee the main reference on page 26 (The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease).\n\nProlonged treatment with constant monitoring of antigen titers and renal function is required.\n\nCombinations of anti-fungal drugs appear to give the best results and include: \u2022 Amphotericin B. Drug can be given IV (see standard texts) or SC (0.5-0.8 mg/kg) in 400 ml of 0.45% saline containing 2.5% dextrose. Administer subcutaneously two or three times a week for 1-3 months, until a total cumulative dose of 8-26 mg/kg is reached. Monitor serum creatinine, urea (more sensitive, but influenced by many non-renal factors) and urine specific gravity and sediment for casts. If azotemia develops, discontinue amphotericin until it resolves and reduce dose. \u2022 5-fluorocytosine 50 mg/kg q 8 h PO used combined with amphotericin. \u2022 Fluconazole 2.5-10 mg/kg PO q 12 h may be the best of the imadazole drugs for CNS and ocular cryptococcosis, and is used after the course of amphotericin for as long as 2 years.\n\n\u2022 Chorioretinitis progressing to anterior uveitis (cloudy eye) and endophthalmitis, in a geographical area where fungal infections occur. \n\nOther fungi that cause intra-ocular infections vary in their geographical distribution:\n\n\u2022 Blastomycosis is a dimorphic fungus, which grows as a yeast in mammalian tissue, and as a mycelial form in the environment. It is found in the USA in the midwestern and southeastern states along the Mississipi, Ohio and Missouri Rivers and occasionally mid-Atlantic states, and in Central America, parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and Israel. Close proximity to water is a factor in its distribution. \u2022 Histoplasmosis is a dimorphic fungus, which exists as a free-living mycelial form, and yeast-like organisms in mammalian tissues. It is found in central USA, especially in the Ohio, Mississipi and Missouri River basins, and in Central and South America.\n\nThere is an association with moist humid conditions and nitrogen-rich soils, bat and bird excrement. \u2022 Coccidioidomycosis a soil mycelial organism with a natural reservoir in desert soils, and around animal burrows. It is found in southwestern USA, Mexico, Central and South America. Animal infection occurs by inhalation of arthrospores, which can transform into spherules and then endospores in lung tissue.\n\nMost intra-ocular fungal infections cause similar ocular signs.\n\n\u2022 Choroidal granulomas are the most characteristic sign on fundoscopy, and appear as a raised area of tapetal hyporeflectivity, or small swollen brownish discolored areas in the retina. \u2022 A generalized chorioretinitis and secondary retinal detachments, with ballooning of the retina into the vitreous.\n\n\u2022 Optic neuritis may be present, seen as a red, swollen optic nerve that is hyperemic. \u2022 Anterior uveitis seen as cloudy, red eye with corneal edema, hypopyon and inflamed conjunctiva.\n\nAffected cats show varying degrees of blindness, depending on the severity of the ocular infection.\n\nSystemic signs can involve many other organs, especially the lungs, brain, nasal cavity, as well as the peri-orbital tissues, lymph nodes, bones, toenails and skin.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on the presenting signs of a cat with rapidly progressive, usually bilateral chorioretinitis, progressing to anterior uveitis, with signs of other systemic disease, and occurring in a geographic area where such fungal disease is known to occur.\n\nImaging techniques can be used to obtain more supportive evidence of a deep fungal infection:\n\n\u2022 Thoracic radiography to demonstrate pulmonary granulomas. \u2022 Nasal cavity radiography. Serological tests can be performed, looking for elevated antibodies (blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidiodomycosis).\n\nAntifungal medications are the cornerstone of therapy. Drugs chosen should be based on results of fungal culture and sensitivity, where possible. Treatment may need to be prolonged, depending on response.\n\nItraconazole 100 mg PO q 24 h with food, or 10 mg/kg q 24 h, or 5 mg/kg q 12 h PO.\n\nFluconazole 50 mg PO q 8 h.\n\nAmphotericin B. This drug can be administered in a subcutaneous infusion of glucose and sodium chloride to reduce the renal toxicity (see The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Discharge, page 26).\n\nTopical steroids or NSAIDs may be used to control the anterior uveitis.\n\nSupportive therapy such as fluids and nutritional support.\n\nEnucleation of the eye is recommended if endophthalmitis and/or secondary glaucoma develop.\n\nPrognosis is guarded to grave in most cases where there is systemic involvement.\n\n\u2022 Acutely painful eye with hyphema. \u2022 +/-Scleral and conjunctival hemorrhage. \n\nThe typical presentation of traumatic retinal detachment is an acutely painful eye, which is usually unilateral.\n\nExophthalmos may be present from retrobulbar hemorrhage and swelling.\n\nMost traumatic eye injuries will exhibit some degree of ocular hemorrhage. This may present as: \u2022 Scleral and/or subconjunctival hemorrhage. \u2022 A red eye with hyphema. The anterior chamber may be filled with blood, or there may be a loose clot. \u2022 If the vitreous is visible, there may be focal areas of hemorrhage, or the vitreous may be filled with blood.\n\nTry to visualize the pupil and pupillary light reflex. A blind eye will usually have a dilated pupil.\n\nThe retina may not be visible due to the hyphema. If there is hemorrhage in the inter-retinal space between the retinal pigment epithelium and the rods and cones, the retina will bulge forward with a red appearance.\n\nLoss of vision may be caused by trauma to the optic nerve. It is not possible to visualize this part of the nerve, but hemorrhages may be present on the optic disc.\n\nBeware of secondary glaucoma. Initially, traumatized eyes are very soft. Glaucoma may follow acutely from obstruction of the iridocorneal angle by hemorrhage, lens luxation or rupture, and inflammation. Cases with chronic retinal detachment may form vascular membranes, which obstruct the drainage angle.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs of a cat presented with an acutely painful, red eye. Carefully examine the eye to determine the extent of the injury. If the fundus is visible ophthalmoscopically, the retina will be able to be examined, and areas with hemorrhage and detachment will be visible.\n\nOcular ultrasound using a 10-megahertz stand-off probe, is a very useful diagnostic tool when the fundus cannot be visualized because of severe hyphema. Retinal detachment will show as a bulging hypoechoic line. Pay particular attention to the shape of the globe, as severely traumatized eyes may also have a rupture of the sclera posteriorly, and this will have a very poor prognosis. Try to visualize the muscle cone and optic nerve for swelling.\n\nUse tonometry to monitor intra-ocular pressure.\n\nTreatment is usually conservative, and includes antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n\u2022 Systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic cover to prevent hematogenous infection. \u2022 Systemic anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation and prevent secondary complications in the eye, such as prednisolone 1 mg/kg bid or a NSAID like ketaprofen, cartrophen or metacam.\n\nIn cases with exophthalmos, do a temporary tarsorrhaphy to protect the cornea.\n\n\u2022 Buphthalmos (an enlarged globe).\n\n\u2022 Increased intra-ocular pressure.\n\n\u2022 Dilated pupil, poorly or non-responsive to light. \u2022 Hyper-reflective tapetum. \u2022 Luxated lens or cataract.\n\nSee the main reference on page 1232 (The Cat With Ocular Discharge or Changed Conjunctival Appearance).\n\nCats blinded from glaucoma will have an enlarged globe (buphthalmos), and the condition will be chronic.\n\nDeep episcleral vessel injection is seen in eyes with a high intra-ocular pressure (above 30 mmHg). Compared to superficial episcleral vessels, the deep vessels are usually straighter and larger, do not move when the overlying bulbar conjunctiva is moved, and do not blanch with the topical application of 1:1000 epinephrine.\n\nThe pupil is dilated or semidilated, with either absent or poor pupillary light reflex.\n\nThere may be signs of chronic anterior uveitis, especially abnormalities in the appearance of the iris surface for example: \u2022 Pinkish discoloration associated with fibrovascular membrane formation. \u2022 Grayish nodules on the iris surface.\n\nThere may be signs of lens instability including: \u2022 An aphakic crescent (crescent shape produced by the clear space between the edge of the displaced lens and the adjacent pupillary margin). \u2022 Anterior or posterior luxation (dislocation). \u2022 Iridodonesis (wobbling of the iris).\n\nThere may be signs of intra-ocular neoplasia.\n\nProlonged increased intra-ocular pressure results in collapse of the cribriform plate. This causes obstruction to retinal vascular flow at the level of the optic disc, and obstruction to the axoplasmic flow in the optic nerves fibers. The resulting retinal degeneration results in the following ophthalmoscopic signs: \u2022 A hyper-reflective tapetum. \u2022 Attenuation (thinning) of the retinal blood vessels. \u2022 Optic disc cupping (the optic disc is pushed backward).\n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical appearance of buphthalmos, with any or all of the other related signs of glaucoma, such as chronic anterior uveitis and lens instability.\n\n\u2022 Tonometry is used to measure intra-ocular pressure (IOP). Normal range for IOP in the cat is 15-25 mmHg. Readings over 30 mmHg are supportive of a diagnosis of glaucoma.\n\n\u2022 Discrete iris or ciliary body masses (FeLVassociated lymphosarcoma). \u2022 Anterior uveitis. \u2022 Intermittent asymmetric changes in pupil size, shape or response. \u2022 Other FeLV-associated signs, e.g. anemia.\n\n\u2022 Retinal detachment.\n\nSee the main reference on page 1300 (The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance).\n\nFeLV may cause ocular lymphosarcoma, which appears as discrete iris or ciliary body masses, usually bilateral, which may cause gross distortion of the iris structure.\n\nFeLV more commonly presents as a uveitis, with changes to iris appearance, and abnormal pupil size and shape. The anterior chamber may contain fibrin and/or blood. Anterior uveitis may occur in the absence of discernible intra-ocular neoplasia.\n\nSome cats develop spastic pupil syndrome, which presents as otherwise unexplainable intermittent asymmetric changes in pupil size, shape or response. For more detail see main reference on page 1278 (The Cat With Abnormal Pupil Size, Shape or Response).\n\nIt is possible to see retinal detachment when the neoplastic process involves the choroid.\n\nThere may be other signs of FeLV-associated disease, e.g. anemia or multicentric lymphosarcoma.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the clinical signs observed in the eye, in association with other signs suggestive of FeLV, e.g. multicentric lymphoma, FeLV-associated anemia.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed on clinical pathology, for example on cytology of lymph nodes or aqueous centesis samples, or occasionally on hematology.\n\nA positive serological test using an antigen-based test for FeLV is supportive evidence of the disease. For more detail see main reference on page 543 (The Anemic Cat).\n\nFor more detail see main reference on pages 1292 and 544 (The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance and The Anemic Cat).\n\nTreatment of the ocular condition, in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy, might include topical corticosteroids such as 0.5% prednisolone acetate drops given q 6-12 h.\n\nPrognosis for the eye will be poor to guarded, if secondary glaucoma has occurred.\n\n\u2022 Young cats 6-12 months of age. \u2022 Anterior uveitis with large fibrin clots (hypopyon). \u2022 Keratic precipitates (\"mutton fat deposits\") on the cornea. \u2022 Chorioretinitis causing variable vision loss and/or abnormal pupil reflexes.\n\nClassical signs-Cont'd \u2022 Neurological signs, including behavioral changes, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures and head tremor.\n\nSee the main reference on page 372 (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nFIP is caused by a coronavirus that causes a disseminated, pyogranulomatous vasculitis. There are two forms of the disease that are recognized: \u2022 An effusive (wet) form, that causes a fibrin-rich exudation in the peritoneal cavity. \u2022 A non-effusive (dry) form, that usually manifests with ocular and neurological signs including anterior uveitis, chorioretinitis and meningitis, respectively.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that FIP is caused by a mutation of enteric coronavirus (FECV) which occurs within about 18 months of infection.\n\nThe ocular form of the disease is usually seen in young cats from 6 months to a year of age.\n\nThe main presenting sign is uveitis. Large fibrin clots mixed with exudated white and red blood cells form a hypopyon (cloudy eye). Keratic precipitates are common, and appear as large pinkish, brown spots (\"mutton fat deposits\") on the inferior endothelial surface of the cornea.\n\nThe vitreous may be hazy, because of similar exudation of cells from the ciliary body.\n\nThe retina may show a focal or total exudative retinal detachment. It is common to see an inflammatory exudate sheathing the major retinal blood vessels, which appears as a cloudy sheath around the vessels.\n\nBlindness may be seen with abnormal pupil reflexes (miotic in the early stages with uveitis, followed by a dilated pupil in blind cats), and abnormal pupil size (anisocoria).\n\nCats with ocular signs frequently develop neurological signs weeks or months later, and are euthanized or die because of meningoencephalitis, and its associated signs, such as seizures. Most common signs in addition to seizures, are central vestibular signs, which include head tilt, loss of balance, nystagmus, mental depression, and postural reaction deficits, and cerebellar signs such as intentional tremors, and hypermetria. Behavioral changes often occur.\n\nCats with ocular signs of FIP rarely show systemic signs of illness such as fever, inappetence and weight loss at initial presentation. As the disease becomes chronic, weight loss and neurological signs develop (seizures are most common).\n\nThere is no definitive diagnostic test for the FIP virus.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is initially based on the suspicious clinical signs of a young cat with uveitis showing hypopyon and keratic precipitates.\n\nSerology is usually regarded as being of dubious benefit in the diagnosis, as the FIP organism cross-reacts with enteric forms of coronavirus.\n\nDiagnosis can only be confirmed on characteristic histopathology of affected tissues on biopsy or necropsy examination. The typical change is described as a pyogranulomatous vasculitis. Necrosis and a fibrinoid response are seen in some cases. The ocular cellular response includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and large, spindle-shaped histiocytes.\n\nCats often have a large increase in plasma total protein, globulin and IgG concentration, because of the chronic nature of the inflammatory disease process. The polyclonal increase in gammaglobulins is caused by virus antigen and cell destruction from the intense inflammation associated with the infection.\n\nToxoplasmosis is the main differential diagnosis. Toxoplasmosis occurs in cats of all ages. The exudative response in the eye is not usually as pronounced. Laboratory tests can be used to differentiate (see above).\n\nAll other ocular diseases that cause anterior uveitis and chorioretinitis should be excluded with diagnostic tests, particularly fungal infections such as cryptococcosis (see page 1268).\n\nThere is no specific treatment for FIP, and once signs develop the disease is almost uniformly fatal.\n\nTopical and systemic corticosteroids will initially reduce the signs of uveitis and chorioretinitis, but recurrence is common.\n\nSupportive medical management including fluids and nutrition can be attempted. Interferon-alpha and cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil may temporarily reduce clinical signs.\n\nCats which are anorexic and depressed, and do not respond to supportive therapy, should be euthanized.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Vision loss in advanced cases.\n\n\u2022 Hyper-reflective tapetal retina, beginning as an elliptical lesion in the area centralis and progressing to include the entire retina. \u2022 Attenuated (thin) retinal blood vessels in advanced cases. \u2022 History of inadequate diet especially cats fed commercial dog foods. \u2022 All breeds at any age. \u2022 Affected cats may have a cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe syndromes feline central retinal degeneration (FCRD) and taurine deficiency retinopathy are regarded by many authors as being the same disease. The disease is still occasionally seen in cats that appear to have adequate levels of dietary taurine, but the overall incidence of the disease throughout the world appears to have declined as the taurine content of commercial diets has been increased.\n\nTaurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid, which is metabolized in the liver from cysteine. Cats are deficient in the enzyme cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase that is necessary for the production of taurine, and therefore need diets that contain a high level of taurine.\n\nIn cats, taurine is used almost exclusively for bile acid conjugation.\n\nTaurine is dissolved in the cytosolic fluids of cells, particularly in excitable tissues. It is found in high concentrations in the retina, heart, central nervous system and skeletal muscle.\n\nTaurine is essential for photoreceptor survival, and is found in high concentrations in inner and outer segments. It is thought to protect the retina from light and chemical damage, regulate calcium ion transport and regulate signal transduction.\n\nTaurine deficiency causes a loss of photoreceptor outer segment and photoreceptor nuclei, and underlying hypertrophy and disorganization of the underlying retinal pigment epithelial cells. It is not clear why the area centralis is affected more than the outer retina, but it may be associated with increased cone density and higher levels of rhodopsin pigment in cone cells in this area. Cone cells are affected more than rods.\n\nOphthalmoscopically the initial lesion develops in the area centralis. The area centralis (temporal to the optic disc) at first develops a granular appearance, then becomes hyper-reflective. As the degeneration advances, a second hyper-reflective lesion develops nasal to the optic disc, which eventually coalesces with the area centralis lesion to form a broad hyper-reflective band, dorsal to the optic disc. Finally, generalized retinal degeneration develops, with generalized tapetal hyper-reflectivity, and retinal vessel attenuation.\n\nTaurine deficiency also causes dilated cardiomyopathy. See main references on page 151 for details (The Cat With Abnormal Heart Sounds and/or an Enlarged Heart).\n\nTaurine deficiency may be seen in all breeds of cats, at any age, although it is less common now that functional taurine is in all commercial cat food. It is most commonly seen in cats fed dog food or vegetarian diets.\n\nInitially, cats are presented with vision loss. In later stages, this is associated with poor pupillary light reflexes.\n\nThere are five stages of the disease described on clinical ophthalmoscopy: \u2022 Stage 1. There is an increased granularity of the area centralis, adjacent to the optic disc. Cats are visual at this stage. \u2022 Stage 2. The area centralis develops an ellipsoidal hyper-reflective appearance. Vision is starting to deteriorate. \u2022 Stage 3. A second hyper-reflective lesion develops nasal to the optic disc. Vision deteriorates further. \u2022 Stage 4. The two hyper-reflective lesions join to form a broad band of hyper-reflective tapetum. Vision is noticeably poor at this stage. \u2022 Stage 5. There is generalized retinal degeneration, with severely attenuated retinal blood vessels. The cat is blind.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs, in particular observation of the typical retinal lesions, and a history of inappropriate diet.\n\nElectroretinography (ERG) can be performed to identify altered photoreceptor function. Cones appear to be affected more than rods, so these cats will have reduced b waves in photopic (light) conditions, and better responses in scotopic (dark adapted) conditions.\n\nMeasurement of plasma taurine levels is the best way to diagnose the condition. Cats with plasma taurine levels below 40 nmol/ml are regarded as deficient.\n\nProvide taurine supplementation.\n\n\u2022 250-500 mg PO q 12 h. \u2022 In the early stages, retinal damage can be reversed, but ophthalmoscopic signs remain unchanged. \u2022 The effects of prolonged deficiency are only partially reversible. \u2022 The ERG signs associated with rod degeneration may reverse, but cone degeneration never totally recovers.\n\nAdvanced cases will remain irreversibly blind, despite treatment.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Vision loss, usually unilateral.\n\n\u2022 Cloudy posterior segment with linear track-like lesions on fundoscopy. \u2022 Anterior uveitis associated with larva in the anterior chamber. \u2022 Rare condition.\n\nLarval migration of the Cuterebra fly causes vision loss, usually unilateral, associated with chorioretinitis. Typically the cat is presented with a cloudy painful eye.\n\nThere are usually poor pupillary light reflexes in that eye, and anisocoria, if the condition is unilateral.\n\nThe characteristic fundoscopy signs are linear hyperreflective \"tracks\" in the tapetal fundus, and linear light gray areas of reduced pigmentation in the nontapetum. Hemorrhage may be evident in the early stages. Sometimes the white body of a fly larva is seen associated with one of the tracks.\n\nRarely, the larva is seen in the anterior chamber, with associated signs of anterior uveitis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on appearance of the fundoscopic lesions, or observation of the parasite in the anterior chamber and associated uveitis.\n\nThere is no specific treatment.\n\nDo not kill the parasite, as this may cause a severe immune reaction to the parasite proteins.\n\nTopical and systemic corticosteroid therapy is used to minimize the inflammation in the affected eye.\n\nA free-moving parasite in the anterior chamber or vitreous should be surgically removed.\n\n\u2022 Progressive loss of vision occurs in young Abyssinian cats. \u2022 Loss of pupil light reflexes in advanced cases. \u2022 Tapetal hyper-reflectivity and retinal vessel attenuation. \u2022 Relatively rare disease.\n\nTwo forms of hereditary retinal degeneration have been described in Abyssinian cats.\n\n\u2022 Rod-cone dysplasia.\n\n-Inheritance is autosomal dominant.\n\n-Rods and cones degenerate at the same rate.\n\n-Degeneration begins centrally, with progressive loss of the photoreceptor layer. -The photoreceptor inner segments remain rudimentary, and the outer segments fail to elongate. \u2022 Rod-cone degeneration.\n\n-Inheritance is autosomal recessive.\n\n-Rods degenerate rapidly, but cones are spared until the late stage of the disease. -Degeneration begins in the mid-peripheral regions of the retina. -Histological changes begin at approximately 35 days post-natally, with immature rod outer segment discs. The cones appear normal at this stage. The rod outer segments begin to form vacuoles, and the disc material clumps with subsequent drop out of the cells. Two to three years later, the cones start to degenerate and drop out. Rhodopsin levels are reduced in affected cats. Cats may also have plasma lipid abnormalities.\n\nInherited retinal degeneration is a rare disease causing blindness in young (\u2264 4 years) Abyssinian cats. It occurs very rarely in other breeds of cats.\n\n\u2022 Retinal degeneration begins at 4 weeks of age, and cats are blind by 1 year of age. The typical history is of a young cat that goes rapidly blind.\n\n\u2022 Nystagmus may be present.\n\n\u2022 Loss of vision occurs rapidly, and mydriasis, hyperreflective tapetum and attenuated retinal blood vessels are evident. \u2022 There is loss of pupillary light reflexes in advanced cases.\n\n\u2022 Retinal degeneration does not begin until 1.5-2 years of age, and blindness follows over the next 2-4 years. The typical history is of older cats that go slowly blind. \u2022 The retina on either side of the optic disc begins to develop a subtle gray discoloration. A more diffuse grayness of the tapetal area follows. The tapetal area then becomes hyper-reflective and the retinal blood vessels attenuate. \u2022 The non-tapetal fundus may show pale areas mixed with heavily pigmented areas. \u2022 There is loss of pupillary light reflexes in advanced cases. \u2022 Electroretinography (ERG) shows a progressive reduction of the B-wave amplitude which correlates to the loss of rhodopsin.\n\nInitially, diagnosis is made on the breed and age of the cat, and the clinical presentation of vision loss. Pupils may become dilated, and the tapetum will be hyperreflective in the advanced stage of the disease.\n\nHistopathology will help to confirm the disease if cats can be sacrificed.\n\nERG with reduced B-wave amplitude is useful in the early stages of the disease.\n\nTaurine deficiency will present with loss of papillary light reflexes, hyper-reflective tapetum and retinal vessel attenuation. This may affect cats of all ages and all breeds. Dietary history and plasma taurine levels should help to differentiate this disease.\n\nHypertensive retinopathy usually occurs in older cats. There is always hemorrhage present around retinal blood vessels, or there is focal areas of hemorrhage present in the vitreous. There will be varying degrees of retinal detachment. Check these cats for renal disease and hyper-thyroidism.\n\nInflammatory chorioretinitis is always appears as cloudy eyes that have uveitis. Laboratory tests are useful to confirm diagnoses.\n\nThere is no treatment for this form of retinal degeneration. Breeders need to be made aware of the mode of inheritance.\n\n\u2022 Rare, primary neoplasia that occurs in older cats (7-15 years). \u2022 History of previous severe trauma to eye. \u2022 Anterior uveitis, keratitis (corneal edema and pigmentation) and glaucoma. \u2022 White to pinkish masses may be visible in the vitreous.\n\nTrauma-associated ocular sarcoma is a rare primary neoplasia reported only in cats.\n\nIt occurs in older cats, typically 7-15 years of age that have had a history of ocular trauma 3-10 years previously.\n\nSigns of anterior uveitis and keratitis may be evident, as edema and pigmentation of the cornea, and a cloudy eye. These changes may prevent visualization of the intra-ocular structures.\n\nSecondary glaucoma is common at this stage of the disease. The eye will show buphthalmos (enlarged globe) with engorged scleral vessels.\n\nIf the posterior segment can be visualized, white to pink masses may be seen.\n\nThe condition is thought to occur after lens trauma, which triggers the lens epithelial cells to undergo metaplasia.\n\nThe neoplasia rapidly extends through the choroid, and infiltrates the optic nerve. Metastasis has been reported.\n\nSurvival rate is very low.\n\nOld cats that have a prior history of trauma, and present with glaucoma and signs of uveitis and keratitis, are candidates for this rare condition.\n\nFine-needle biopsy may be done, but may not yield a diagnostic sample if the tumor contains fibrous and cartilagenous tissue.\n\nHistopathology of enucleated globes provides a definitive diagnosis, and will show changes that may include granulation tissue, fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and anaplastic spindle cell sarcoma.\n\nAll blind globes with chronic uveitis should be watched for the development of this condition.\n\nEarly enucleation with histopathology should be done on all globes where there is a prior history of trauma, and there are changes in the size and shape of the globe, or changes in the anterior chamber and cornea, that are indicative of intra-ocular disease.\n\nSeverely traumatized blind eyes in cats should be enucleated, to prevent the occurrence of this condition, particularly if there has been lens rupture.\n\nIn confirmed cases, check for metastases to regional lymph nodes, and other organs such as lungs and liver.\n\n\u2022 Rare in cats.\n\n\u2022 Uveitis with corneal edema, cloudy aqueous and distorted pupil. \u2022 Swelling and pigment changes in the retina.\n\nThis is a rare condition in cats.\n\nMost cases present as anterior uveitis with corneal edema and a cloudy aqueous, and have some form of swelling seen in the iris, which may cause distortion of the pupil (dyscoria).\n\nFundoscopy may show a bulging of the retina, and some pigment change such as a brownish appearance. Retinal detachment may occur as the neoplasia extends through the choroid into the intra-retinal space.\n\nThe most common metastatic neoplasia in the eye include lymphosarcoma, and adenocarcinoma from lung, uterus and undetermined origin.\n\nAn initial tentative diagnosis is based on the most common presentation of iris swelling, distortion of the retina and signs of uveitis.\n\nFine-needle biopsies may help to obtain a diagnosis.\n\nChest and abdominal radiology should be done to find primary adenocarcinomas.\n\nExamination of the buffy coat for abnormal lymphocytes can be done in cases with lymphosarcoma.\n\nFine-needle biopsies of enlarged lymph nodes may be diagnostic.\n\n\u2022 Rapid loss of vision within 5 days with dilated pupils. \u2022 History of administration of methylnitrosurea in combination with ketamine hydrochloride. \u2022 High doses of fluoroquinalones, particularly enrofloxacin, may cause blindness in cats.\n\nThere are few cases reported of toxic retinal degeneration in the cat.\n\nThere is rapid loss of vision over approximately 5 days, usually in cats that have been administered specific drugs. This syndrome is associated with high doses of fluoroquinalones, particularly enrofloxacin, although it has also occurred as an idiosyncratic reaction in cats given less than the recommended dose of 5 mg/kg q 24 h. Methylnitrosurea, in combination with ketamine hydrochloride, has also been associated with this syndrome.\n\n\u2022 Ketamine also increases cerebral oxygen demand, and the visual cortex is the most sensitive area of the brain to hypoxia. Hypotension associated with acepromazine especially intravenous administration, and high doses of isoflurane, or other anesthetic agents, and mask delivery of anesthetic agents all exacerbate the hypoxia. Hypoxia of the visual cortex can result in cortical blindness following anesthesia.\n\nPupils become dilated and unresponsive to light.\n\nPathology is characterized by photoreceptor and outer nuclear layer degeneration.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on clinical signs and history of either:\n\n\u2022 Sudden blindness after administration of methylnitrosourea and ketamine. \u2022 Sudden blindness after administration of enrofloxacin, especially at a higher dose (20 mg/kg q 24 h) than the recommended rate of 5 mg/kg q 24 h.\n\n\u2022 Retinal blood vessels appear enlarged, and may have a yellow to orange hue. \u2022 Rare in cats.\n\nSee main reference on page 569 (The Cat With Hyperlipidemia).\n\nCats do not show visual impairment with lipemia retinalis, so this condition is usually seen as an incidental finding.\n\nOphthalmosopic examination reveals enlarged retinal blood vessels, which have a yellow to orange coloration. There may be some haziness surrounding the major vessels from lipid leakage, and this may cause a local inflammation.\n\nLipemia retinalis is seen in cats that have increased fasting triglycerides, which is most commonly idiopathic in origin, but may be associated with diabetes mellitus or hereditary hyperchylomicronemia. Post-prandial lipidemia may be seen in normal cats, especially after a high-fat diet, and obese cats. It can occur after administration of corticosteroids.\n\nThe clinical signs of large retinal blood vessels that have a yellow to orange hue should alert the clinician to lipidemia. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be checked.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs and increased plasma triglycerides.\n\nBlood glucose levels should be checked for diabetes mellitus.\n\nThere may be a history of corticosteroid use, particularly megesterol acetate.\n\n\u2022 Blind, weak cat with profound anaemia (PCV < 10% or hemaglobin < 5 g/dl). \u2022 Retinal hemorrhages and attenuated, pale retinal vessels. \u2022 Partial to complete loss of pupillary light reflex.\n\nTypically the cat presents as blind and weak, with profound anemia (PCV < 10%). The severe anemia is thought to cause a hypoxic retinopathy.\n\nOn fundoscopy there are focal retinal hemorrhages associated with anoxia of the retinal blood vessel cell wall. The vessels appear pale and are attenuated (thinned).\n\nPartial to complete loss of the pupillary light reflex is present as a result of retinal hypoxia.\n\nOther signs of severe anemia are present including pale mucous membranes, increased respiratory rate, lethargy and weakness.\n\nDiagnosis is based initially on the clinical signs of a severely anemic cat with poor pupillary light reflexes and multiple small retinal hemorrhages.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed on hematology, and ruling out coagulopathy as a cause of retinal hemorrhage. Anemia must be profound for this syndrome to occur, i.e. usually the PCV is less than 10% or hemoglobin less than 5 g/dl.\n\nThe cause of the anemia should be identified. \n\nSevere plasma hyperviscosity causes blindness and loss of pupillary reflexes.\n\nMarkedly increased plasma proteins cause increased viscosity of blood. This results in sluggish blood flow to the retina and retinal hypoxia.\n\nOn fundoscopy, there are extremely dilated, tortuous retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhages, retinal detachment, perivascular effusion and optic disc edema may be evident.\n\nA variety of other clinical signs may be present associated with the primary disease causing the hyperproteinemia, including lethargy, pale mucous membranes, neurologic signs and lameness.\n\nDiagnosis is initially based on the suspicious signs seen on fundoscopy, especially the presence of bizarre dilated, tortuous retinal vessels.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a monoclonal globulin spike on protein electrophoresis of plasma.\n\nMultiple myeloma is the most frequent cause of a monoclonal globulin spike. \n\nOptic nerve coloboma is a rare lesion in cats.\n\nIt is usually seen as an incidental finding on ophthalmoscopic examination of cats with eyelid agenesis (coloboma).\n\nBoth hereditary and in utero infections have been suggested as causes.\n\nThe coloboma appears as a dark area associated with the optic disc, and has the appearance of an inverted funnel or black hole.\n\nVision is rarely affected.\n\nRetinal dysplasia may occur concurrently, and appears as a dark streak or depigmented rosette in the tapetal fundus.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the fundiscopic findings of an optic disc with a dark hollow appearance. Retinal dysplasia appears as dark lines in the tapetal fundus. \n\nCryptococcosis affects cats of all ages. Blindness may occur with or without CNS signs. Blindness may be central or associated with retinal detachment and optic neuritis. Cats with CNS signs may show seizures, ataxia and/or depression.\n\nUveitis with hypopyon and keratic precipitates is a common presenting sign.\n\nAffected cats often show other signs that may include one or all of the following: chronic nasal discharge with swollen bridge of the nose or polyp-like mass protruding from nostril, skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes, anorexia and weight loss.\n\nTreatment of the ocular disease may alleviate signs, only to be followed by blindness with or without CNS signs such as seizure and ataxia.\n\nCSF tap may confirm the presence of typical yeast-like organisms visible either directly, or found on culture.\n\nSerology may support the diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Young adult to middle-aged cats. \u2022 Sudden-onset blindness. \u2022 Normal, slow or absent papillary light reflexes. \u2022 Seizures, ataxia and/or motor defects.\n\nSee the main reference on page 800 (The Cat With Seizures, Circling and/or Changed Behavior).\n\nIschemic encephalopathy can result from several disease processes including embolism (feline ischemic encephalopathy), and hypotension, which is usually associated with anesthesia.\n\nFeline ischemic encephalopathy is a syndrome more common in young adult to middle-aged cats. The pathogenesis is unknown, but is thought to be an associated embolic event resulting in cerebral ischemia. \u2022 In contrast, cerebrovascular accidents resulting in hemorrhage into the brain, are rare in cats, and older animals are more at risk, especially if hypertensive from renal failure or hyperthyroidism.\n\nIschemic encephalopathy may also occur as a complication of anesthesia, particularly in cats resuscitated after cardiac arrest. The visual cortex is the most sensitive area of the brain to hypoxia. Hypoxia of the visual cortex can result in cortical blindness.\n\n\u2022 Hypotension associated with acepromazine, especially intravenous administration, and high doses of isoflurane, or other anesthetic agents, and mask delivery of anesthetic agents (which combines high doses of inhalant agents and poor airway maintenance), all exacerbate anesthesia-associated hypoxia.\n\nKetamine also increases cerebral oxygen demand and has been associated with cortical blindness. \u2022 Cortical blindness associated with anesthesia is evident once the cat wakes up. Other neurological signs may be evident such as paresis, ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, circling and seizures. \u2022 Typically, there is blindness with dilated pupils, and normal to slow pupillary light reflexes.\n\nIn feline ischemic encephalopathy typically there is a peracute onset of unilateral forebrain signs (mental depression and confusion, compulsive circling, hemiparesis and ataxia) and rarely, severe cluster seizures or status epilepticus. Vision defects including loss of menace response may be present. Blindness does not occur unless the infarction involves both hemispheres, which is uncommon.\n\nA tentative diagnosis is based on clinical signs of a sudden onset of neurological problems in an adult cat unassociated with anesthesia (feline ischemic encephalopathy), or on recovery from anesthesia.\n\nCT scan or MRI using dyes may help to localize and diagnose the problem, if feline ischemic encephalopathy is suspected. A CSF tap may show red blood cells, or hemosiderin in more chronic cases.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Typically, young cats 6-12 months of age.\n\n\u2022 Central blindness with normal PLR or anisocoria. \u2022 Central vestibular and cerebellar signs.\n\nSee the main reference on page 372 (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis is an infrequent disease causing central blindness, and most often occurs in young cats that were in multi-cat households or obtained from breeders within the previous 18 months.\n\nCats with central blindness have the dry form of FIP, and usually have a history of uveitis and the classical signs of hypopyon and keratic precipitates.\n\nThe choroid of the eye is homologous embryologically with the meninges, so cases with meningitis often also show chorioretinitis.\n\nCentral blindness is associated with normal to slow pupillary light reflexes for cortical lesions, or anisocoria if the midbrain is involved. Concurrent involvement of the eyes may result in abnormal reflexes.\n\nFIP is usually a protracted disease, often with vague systemic signs such as inappetence, weight loss, lethargy and pyrexia.\n\nCentral vestibular and cerebellar signs may be seen. Affected cats often develop seizures.\n\nOcular disease may initially respond to corticosteroid therapy, with the cat then developing CNS signs and blindness weeks or months later.\n\nThere is no definitive diagnosis for FIP.\n\nDiagnosis is initially based on the suspicious clinical signs of a young cat with uveitis, showing hypopyon and keratic precipitates, followed up to months later with neurological signs.\n\nSerology is usually regarded as being of dubious benefit in the diagnosis, as the FIP organism cross-reacts with enteric forms of coronavirus.\n\nDiagnosis can only be confirmed on characteristic histopathology of affected tissues on biopsy or necropsy. The typical change is described as a pyogranulomatous vasculitis. Necrosis and a fibrinoid response are seen in some cases. The ocular cellular response includes neu-trophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and large, spindle-shaped histiocytes.\n\nCases usually show a large increase in IgG due to the chronic nature of the disease, seen as increased plasma total protein and globulin concentration. There is a polyclonal increase in gammaglobulins caused by virus antigen, and cell destruction from the intense inflammation associated with the infection.\n\nClassical signs \n\nIntracranial neoplasia causing blindness usually presents as an older cat with a loss of vision, which may be unilateral or bilateral. \u2022 If the lesion affects the optic chiasm, the pupils will be dilated and non-resposive to light.
