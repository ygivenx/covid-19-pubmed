{"title": "Rapid Identification of Emerging Pathogens: Coronavirus", "body": "Table 1 lists all the CoV used in this study. Multiple sequence alignments of all available CoV nucleotide sequences from GenBank were scanned to identify pairs of potential PCR priming loci. Two target regions were selected in CoV ORF-1b (annotations based on Snijder et al. [20]), 1 in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the other in Nsp14 (Table 2). 5\u2032 propynyl-modified pyrimidine nucleotides (shown in bold) were positioned at universally conserved positions within these primers to extend the breadth of broad-range priming to allow efficient PCR from all CoV species tested.\n\nFor each primer region, a database of expected base compositions (A, G, C, and T base counts) from all known CoV sequences in GenBank was generated (data not shown) and used in the identification and classification of the test isolates. Several of the isolates used in this study did not have a genome sequence record in GenBank. Experimentally measured base compositions from these isolates were independently verified by sequencing \u2248500 base pair (bp) regions that flanked both target regions used in this study (GenBank accession nos.AY874541 and AY878317-AY878324).\n\nRNA was isolated from 250 \u03bcL of CoV-infected cells or culture supernatant spiked with 3 \u03bcg of sheared poly-A DNA using Trizol or Trizol LS, respectively (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Reverse transcription was performed by mixing 10 \u03bcL of the purified RNA with 5 \u03bcL of water treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 500 ng random primers, 1 \u03bcg of sheared poly-A DNA, and 10 U SUPERaseIn (Ambion Inc., Woodlands, TX, USA). The mixture was heated to 60\u00b0C for 5 min and then cooled to 4\u00b0C. Following the annealing of the random primers to the RNA, 20 \u03bcL of first-strand reaction mix consisting of 2x first-strand buffer (Invitrogen Inc.), 10 mmol/L DTT, 500 \u00b5mol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 7.5 U SuperScript II was added to the RNA primer mixture. The RNA was reversed transcribed for 45 min at 45\u00b0C. Various dilutions of the reverse transcription reaction mixes were used directly in the PCR reactions.\n\nAll PCR reactions were performed in 50 \u03bcL with 96-well microtiter plates and M.J. Dyad thermocyclers (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA). The PCR reaction buffer consisted of 4 U Amplitaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA), 1x buffer II (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 2.0 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.4 mol/L betaine, 800 \u03bcmol/L dNTP mix, and 250 nmol/L propyne-containing PCR primers. The following PCR conditions were used to amplify CoV sequences: 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. After PCR, the amplified products were desalted before analysis by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) by methods described previously (21). A small oligonucleotide SH2 (CGTGCATGGCGG, Synthetic Genetics, San Diego, CA, USA) was added as an internal mass standard (22); the final concentration of SH2 was 50 nmol/L.\n\nThe mass spectrometer used in this work is based on a Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA, USA) Apex II 70e ESI-FTICR-MS that used an actively shielded 7 Tesla superconducting magnet. All aspects of pulse sequence control and data acquisition were performed on a 1.1 GHz Pentium II data station running Bruker\u2019s Xmass software (Bruker Daltonics). Inputs to the signal processor are the raw mass spectra for each of the parallel PCR reactions used to analyze a single sample. The ICR-2LS software package (23) was used to deconvolute the mass spectra and calculate the mass of the monoisotopic species using an \u201caveragine\u201d fitting routine (24) modified for DNA (Drader et al., unpub. data). Using this approach, monoisotopic molecular weights were calculated. The spectral signals were algorithmically processed to yield base composition data as described previously (25). The amplitudes of the spectra are calibrated to indicate the number of molecules detected in the mass spectrometer; m/z and the m/z values are corrected by using internal mass standards. The algorithm computes the organism\u2019s identity and abundances consistent with observations over all the PCR reactions run on the input sample.\n\nFor broad-range detection of all CoV, the 2 PCR primer target regions shown in Table 2 were used against each virus listed in Table 1. Resultant products were desalted and analyzed by FTICR-MS by methods described previously (21). The spectral signals were algorithmically processed to yield base composition data. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of electrospray ionization, strand separation, and the actual charge state distributions of the separated sense and antisense strands of the PCR products from the RdRp primer pair for SARS-CoV. Due to the accuracy of FTICR-MS (mass measurement error \u00b1 1 ppm), all detected masses could be unambiguously converted to the base compositions of sense and antisense strands (25).\n\nOne of the limitations of all molecular methods for detecting pathogens, including the one described here, is that unexpected variations in PCR primer target sequences in unknown species can lead to missed detection. To minimize this possibility, the primers designed in this study were selected on the basis of highly conserved regions identified by multiple sequence alignments of all previously known CoV species sequences. Further, we chose 2 amplification targets for redundant detection of the CoV and to have increased resolution to distinguish the different viral species. Both primer pairs were tested against multiple isolates from the 3 previously known CoV species groups and from SARS-CoV isolates.\n\nThe results from analysis of 14 CoV isolates are shown in Table 1. For both target regions, the measured signals agreed with compositions expected from the known CoV sequences in GenBank (data not shown). Several of the isolates used in this study did not have a genome sequence record in GenBank. Nevertheless, we were able to amplify all test viruses and experimentally determine their base compositions. These experimentally determined base compositions were confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). Thus the strategy described here enables identification of organisms without the need for prior knowledge of the sequence, provided that the broad range primers do not fail to amplify the target because of excessive numbers of mismatches.\n\nTo demonstrate the potential to detect multiple viruses in the same sample, as might occur during a coinfection, we pooled the viral extracts from 3 human CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV, and analyzed the mixture. Signals from all 3 viruses were clearly detected and resolved in the mass spectra (Figure 2), which demonstrated that coinfections of >1 CoV species could be identified. We have previously determined that the system can reliably detect multiple species in ratios of \u22481:1000, while varying input loads from 10 to 10,000 organisms (data not shown).\n\nTo determine sensitivity in a clinical sample, viable, titered SARS-CoV was added to human serum and analyzed in 2 ways. In the first, RNA was isolated from serum containing 2 concentrations of the virus (1.7 x 105 and 170 PFU/mL), reverse transcribed to cDNA with random primers, and serially diluted (10-fold), before PCR amplification with both RdRp and Nsp14 primer sets. By using this approach, the assay was sensitive to \u2248102 PFU per PCR reaction (\u22481.7 PFU/mL serum). We estimated the number of reverse-transcribed SARS genomes by competitive, quantitative PCR with a nucleic acid internal standard (data not shown). Analysis of ratios of mass spectral peak heights of titrations of the internal standard and the SARS cDNA showed that \u2248300 reverse-transcribed viral genomes were present per PFU, similar to the ratio of viral genome copies per PFU previously reported for RNA viruses (26). By using this estimate, PCR primers were sensitive to 3 genome equivalents per PCR reaction, which is consistent with previously reported detection limits for optimized SARS-specific primers (27,28). In the second method, we spiked 10-fold dilutions of the SARS virus into serum before RT-PCR and could reliably detect 1 PFU (\u2248300 genomes) per PCR reaction or 170 PFU (5.1 x 104 genomes) per mL serum. The discrepancy between the detection sensitivities in the 2 experimental protocols described above suggests that losses were associated with RNA extraction and reverse transcription when very little virus was present (<300 genome copies) in the starting sample in serum. This finding is consistent with results for direct measurement of RNA viruses from patient samples (26). Therefore, in a practical experimental analysis of a tissue sample, the limit of sensitivity was \u22481 PFU per PCR reaction.\n\nWe have described a novel approach using base composition analysis for viral identification. However, since RNA virus nucleotide sequences mutate over time within the functional constraints allowed by selection pressure (29), the utility of this method to correctly classify RNA viruses depends on the resolution needed for a particular application. We considered 2 specific applications. The first was to distinguish SARS-CoV from other species of CoV that infect humans, namely HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. The second application was the utility of the technique for exploration of animal reservoirs for the discovery of SARS-related CoV species.\n\nTo quantitatively analyze the resolving power of base compositions, we mathematically modeled base composition variations using known sequences of multiple isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in GenBank (H. Levene, et al., unpub. data). HCV sequence-derived mutation probabilities were used to estimate the extent of base composition variations for CoV species. Figure 3 shows a plot of the base compositions for the RdRp target region for the 3 CoV known to infect humans. \u0394bc represents the net changes in composition required for strain variants of 229E or OC43 to be misidentified as SARS, and \u0394m the probability of occurrence of these changes. The cumulative probability of misclassifying either 229E or OC43 as SARS by using base composition measurements from both target regions was low (\u0394m >10), even allowing for unseen variations in those 2 viruses. Thus, for use in human clinical diagnostics, base composition analysis of the 2 target regions described here would provide corroborative information and accurate species identification of CoV infections.\n\nTo determine the utility of base composition analysis in the search for animal CoV species, we calculated the cumulative mutation distances for both target regions for all known CoV and plotted groups where all members fall within certain probability thresholds, as shown in Figure 4. A series of nested ovals represents subgroupings of species, where the maximal distance between known members of a subgroup is represented by the \u0394m next to the oval. By using the above classification metric, SARS-CoV would be considered the first member of a new group of CoV, not a member of the core group 2 cluster, although it would be placed closest to group 2 (\u0394m < 10.2). These findings are similar to those recently described by Snijder et al., who used sequence data from the replicase genes (5,487 bp) in ORF1b and suggested that the SARS-CoV was most closely related to and possibly an early split-off from group 2 CoV (20). However, substantial space exists around SARS-CoV where as yet undiscovered SARS-CoV could populate a subgroup without being confused with the group 2 or other CoV.\n\nThe strategy we describe allows rapid identification of new viral species members of previously characterized viral families, without the need for prior knowledge of their sequence, through use of integrated electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and base composition analysis of broad-range PCR products. Broad-range PCR reactions are capable of producing products from groups of organisms, rather than single species, and the information content of each PCR reaction is potentially very high. Further, in many cases, including the SARS-CoV detection described in this article, priming across broadly conserved regions provides adequate species detection and taxonomic resolution. In cases where additional subspecies level classification becomes important, broad primers can be followed up with more species-specific primers that can detect even single nucleotide changes (SNPs) or alternatively, larger regions of the identified species can be analyzed by sequencing. Despite the advances in high throughput sequencing, however, it is impractical as a front-end detector in a routine survey and detection setting. The mass spectrometer is capable of analyzing complex PCR products at a rate of \u22481 minute per sample. Because the process is performed in an automated, microtiter plate format, large numbers of samples can be examined (>900 PCR reactions/day/instrument), which makes this process practical for large-scale analysis of clinical or environmental surveillance samples in public health laboratory settings. The current generations of ESI mass spectrometers used in the detector cost approximately U.S.$150,000 and can be operated 24 hours per day by trained technicians. Tools for analyzing mass spectrometry data are widely available and are described in detail elsewhere (23\u201325). A comparable alternative to the methods described here are microarrays, which can also provide broad range detection.\n\nThis approach can be extended to other viral, bacterial, fungal, or protozoal pathogen groups and is a powerful new paradigm for timely identification of previously unknown organisms that cause disease in humans or animals and for monitoring the progress of epidemics."}
