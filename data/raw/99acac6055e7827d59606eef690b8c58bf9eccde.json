{"title": "Modeling and Forecasting Trend of COVID-19 Epidemic in Iran Affiliation: Modeling and Forecasting Trend of COVID-19 Epidemic in Iran", "body": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have been identified since 1965 and so far 7 species of them have been discovered and reported to affect humans. These viruses have three genotypes of alpha, beta and gamma. The natural reservoirs of these diseases are mammals and birds, and therefore are considered as zoonotic diseases (1, 2). The virus is believed transmitted mostly via contact or droplets. individuals are all generally susceptible to the virus. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number (R zero) in china was 2.2 at the onset of the epidemic. Most patients were clinically mild and moderate cases. The case fatality ratio was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death (3). These viruses cause direct and indirect transmission of respiratory diseases with a wide range of asymptomatic, cold symptoms from respiratory/fever symptoms, cough, shortness of breath to kidney failure and death, leading to more severe respiratory illness epidemic and pandemic in most countries of the world (3-5). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a species of coronavirus that infects humans, bats and certain other mammals, which has led to epidemics in 2002 and 2003 (2,6,7), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused 2012 epidemic in Saudi Arabia (8) , and more recently their newest variant COVID-19 has led to the recent epidemic in China and then across the world (9) (10) (11) . For these viruses, three genotypes were introduced and the COVID-19 genotype is beta coronavirus (9) . COVID-19 is an emerging disease, with an incubation period of 1 to 14 (mostly 3 to 5) days. The mortality rate has been reported to be 2-3%. Approximately 80% of patients are classified as invisible infections (12) (13) (14) . As of the time of writing this article, March 11, 2020, COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in more than 100 countries (most prevalent in China, Italy, Iran, France, Spain, Germany, and the United States) with 126369 cases, 4633 deaths and 68304 individuals recovered worldwide (15, 16) .\n\n.

People are referring to health centers and hospitals, and the public is almost alarmed by the epidemic of panic and inaccurate reporting in cyberspace. The recurring and important questions are: How is the size of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran and how long and when will the epidemic go down? We cannot answer these questions with certainty, but it can be investigated in terms of pathogenic behavior \n\nThis study is a secondary data analysis and mathematical modeling based on a research proposal .

First, based on a search for reliable sources of disease trends and epidemic curves across the world, the curve of Iran was also drawn. Focused and scientific group discussion sessions were held with experts on epidemiology, biostatistics, and mathematics, infectious diseases specialists as well as healthcare managers on the topic, the scenarios were discussed and agreement was reached on the application of the final scenarios. From different models and logistic growth differential equations, Gompertz growth, von Bertalanffy growth equation and curve fitting by Least Squared Error (LSE) method with cubic polynomial for Epidemic forecasts were run in MATLAB software until April 3, 2020 (the following Iranian new year). Models are presented as the following differential equations:\n\nLogistic Differential Equation:\n\nGompertz Differential Equation:\n\nVon Bertalanffy's differential growth equation:\n\nCubic Polynomial Polynomials:\n\n. Where P represents the number of individuals in each population, e, c, b, and a represent parameter and t time.\n\nis a derivative of time (20) (21) (22) .\n\nWe used the MATLAB fminsearch function to calculate the unknown parameters in the differential equations, and also to solve the equations.\n\n.

All estimated are based on current trends, Sampling of severe cases, hospitalization and tip of iceberg spread disease and asymptomatic, mild and moderate cases could not be calculated.\n\nFrequency of daily statistics of COVID-19 (definite new cases), number of deaths and recovered cases) in Iran are shown in Table 1 According to Figure 2B and the models of Von and Gompertz for prediction of recovered patients, the model estimated the number of recovered individuals to be 6540 and 11800, .

Moreover, according to Figure 3B , the maximum population of recovered individuals was estimated 21000 according to the method of least squared error.\n\nTo predict and estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19, two growth models ( Figure 2C ) and the least squared error ( Figure 3C ) were used to maximize logistic growth in the most optimistic manner. According to logistic, Von and least squared error method, the number of deaths will be 1707, 3165 and 6300 individuals on April 3, 2020, respectively. Also, to predict and estimate the number of deaths until the end of epidemic the Von's growth model is used for daily and cumulative deaths. Based on this model the maximum number of death will occur on March 25 by approximately 180 deaths and after this time mortality will start slowing down ( Figure 4C ). The end of the mortality will occur near May 28, 2020 with about 5000 deaths ( Figure 4D ).\n\nIn this study, for the first time in Iran, to monitor the trend of COVID-19 epidemic, prediction and estimation of the number of patients, R0, deaths and recovered individuals were performed and reported based on mathematical and statistical models. Although this prediction may be associated with random errors, it was made with assumptions about the past trends of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran as well as the behavior of the people and government interventions (Sampling of severe cases and hospitalization). One point that may change our estimates is that we are at the end of the solar year and are less than 10 days longer than the Iranian New Year (Nowruz 1399) and New Year's with long vacations may increase visits, travels, and other activities. It is a rigorous government and health care intervention that may be implemented more and more strictly on these days. Moreover, according to a valid scientific report, delay in the onset of symptoms until the isolation of patients plays an important role in controlling the epidemic. To achieve 90% control of the epidemic, 80% of the cases need to be tracked and .

The epidemic is controlled when a new infection does not occur 12 to 16 weeks after the initial cases of the disease (18). Therefore, it is recommended that efforts be made to control the epidemic with greater vigor and urgency and to conduct a daily risk assessment. In the current epidemiological situation in the world and Iran, fear control and avoidance of rumors are very important for the prevention and control of coronavirus (22) .\n\nThere are three important points in this epidemic. The first point is to help calm down the atmosphere of society and to avoid tension in societies, and the second is to properly interpret the COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) in Iran and calculate it tactfully. It should be taken into account in interpreting this index, since the denominator of the fraction is only positive, and the death rate is positive among the positive cases. This index should also be calculated until the end of the epidemic period, and if it is until the end of the epidemic and their outcome (death/recovery) is determined, this indicator will approach the real number. The third point is to recommend personal hygiene, in particular hand washing and avoiding contact with suspected patients, social distance, discovering unknown cases of infection and early detection, trace direct contact and isolation of patients, which is emphasized by the healthcare system to overcome this disease. One article reported that up to 70% of the supply chain could be cut off and the epidemic could be controlled if contact and isolation, quarantine and isolation were appropriately accomplished (18). The top priorities in Iran are now circular and comprehensive efforts to conduct epidemiological studies and identification of all aspects of the disease (source of disease, reservoir, pathways, infectivity, incubation period, incidence and prevalence, pathogenicity, immunogenicity, herd immunity, causes, epidemic and pandemic pattern, primary and secondary attack rates, response time, time needed for isolation and quarantine, treatment regimens, vaccines and other prevention methods, disease surveillance and statistical reporting) and evidence-based interventions and epidemic control.\n\n.

Obviously, cultural conditions are also effective. Given the prediction and modeling of the number of cases of coronavirus in Iran and because the virus is circulating in the country for at least a few weeks, we will have an ascending trend in the coming weeks.\n\nApplication of the experiences of China, which took almost 70 days to complete the epidemic curve, has reached a flat level; it is recommended that the following epidemiological recommendations be implemented promptly and that interventions recommended by the World Health Organization be implemented (23).\n\nUp-to-date and accurate data on definitions related to suspected, probable, and definitive people with coronavirus should be collected at all levels of the province's health care system. Percentage of completion and accuracy of their assessments and data should be monitored precisely and the epidemic curve should be drawn by rural, city, district, province, and other important sectors and be provided to the campus authorities in an updated dashboard format. Access to the results of the analysis as well as data should be provided for researchers and experts on the basis of specific protocols available for this purpose in the world and Iran, and a thorough critique and creative theories and ideas should be elicited from all university training and research groups.

Health care system staff should be empowered to record and train data, especially the use of virtual, remote, and web-based networks. This will certainly improve the quality of data recording. All epidemiological indicators that determine the epidemic pattern, including baseline R zero, attack rate, incubation period, index case, primary cases, secondary cases, and GIS mapping should be determined in provinces, cities, and across the entire country, and epidemic trends should be monitored. The models used to predict the end of the epidemic and control it should be evaluated, as well.\n\nThe actual trend of detecting COVID-19 cases in Iran has been increasing and is based on public behavior and government intervention. In this study, estimated are based on current trends, Sampling of severe cases, hospitalization and tip of iceberg spread disease and asymptomatic, mild and moderate cases could not be calculated. Complete reliance on any type of model will lead to systematic and random error, unless modeling provides a prediction with precise and If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be felat from late April 2020, and new cases are expected to decline from mid-April of the following Iranian new year.
