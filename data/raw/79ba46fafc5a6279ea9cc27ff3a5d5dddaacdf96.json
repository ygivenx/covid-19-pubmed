These results are consistent with this class of drugs targeting the SCV helicase within the cell.\n\nWe have previously developed a colorimetric assay to measure the NTPase activity of the SCV helicase in 96-Results well plates, in a high throughput format [26, 32, 33] . In this discontinuous colorimetric assay using malachite Synthesis of Bananin and Its Derivatives The bananins were synthesized by the reaction of green and ammonium molybdate, released phosphate is quantified after a 5 min reaction period, observed at phloroglucinol (most likely in its triketo tautomeric form) with aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by hydrochloric a wavelength of 630 nm. Oligo-dT 24 was included in the assay at a saturating concentration of 200 nM, to mimic acid or sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution [9] . Generally, acidic catalysis was used due to the degradation the nucleic acid-stimulated NTPase activity of the SCV helicase. Potential inhibitors of the ATPase reaction of pyridoxal under highly basic conditions. Alkaline catalysis was used for reaction with aromatic aldehydes would be expected to reduce the amount of phosphate released during the reaction, reflected in a decrease in such as vanillin. Bananin synthesis is driven by the creation of the highly symmetric trioxa-adamantane-triol the measured absorbance at 630 nm. We first checked whether the bananin compounds (TAT) cage system. The prototypical compound of the TAT series, the vitamin B 6 -derived bananin (BAN) or were able to inhibit the dT 24 -stimulated ATPase activity of the SCV helicase.

Reactions with subsequent oxidation to iodobananin (6#-iodobananin 5#-carboxylic acid, IBN). The iodine in IBN can be were carried out in the presence of various concentrations of the six bananin derivatives and the results were replaced by various substituents as exemplified by the synthesis of adeninobananin (6#-adeninobananin 5#-plotted and fitted to a simple model (Figure 2A) .

Interestingly, BAN is were making measurements within the linear region ( Figure S1 ). susceptible to Michael addition with the natural product eugenol, isolated from the essential oil of cloves Our results showed that the parent compound bananin inhibited the ATPase activity of the SCV helicase (Syzygium aromaticum). This NaOH-catalyzed addition leads to eugenolbananin (eubananin, EUB), which can with an ATPase IC 50 value of 2.3 M (IC 50 values shown in Figure 4C ).

It is expected that numerous naturally occurring aldehydes can be introduced to form the cor-Interestingly, ansabananin was a weak inhibitor, with an ATPase IC 50 of 51 M, while adeninobananin did not show responding TATs with phloroglucinol in 3.33 M aqueous NaOH. The bananin group of compounds represents, to any inhibitory activity at all. These results suggest that are the double reciprocal Lineweaver Burke plots for the data in Figures 3A and 3C . In both cases, as the V max was significantly decreased in the presence of the inhibitor, but the K M changed little, this indicated that bananin was acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the ATPase activity of the SCV helicase with respect to both ATP and nucleic acid. This suggests that bananin inhibits by binding at a site distinct from the ATP and nucleic acid binding sites. Building on this foundation, we next tested the antihelicase activities of these compounds. We used a newly developed fluorimetric assay based on the very strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the fluorophore Cy3 to the quencher Black Hole Quencher 2 (BHQ2). A similar approach has been outlined very recently in assaying the hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, a 3# to 5# helicase [34] . However, as we have recently shown that the SCV helicase holds strict 5# to 3# directionality [26] , we designed a system with a 5#-oligo(dT) overhang. The principle behind this new assay is outlined in Figure 4A . There is a Cy3 fluorophore at the 3# end of one of the oligomers of the duplex, in close proximity to a BHQ2 quencher at the 5# end of the other oligomer. When the two oligomers are in very close proximity (i.e., when the two oligomers are annealed), then the Cy3 fluorescence is strongly quenched by the FRET effect. After the duplex has been unwound by the SCV helicase, then the Cy3 fluorescence is no longer quenched, and a dramatic increase in the fluorescence may be observed. To ensure that the primers do not reanneal, a second capture primer is included in the reaction. This is identical to the BHQ2 primer but does not contain the BHQ2 quenching group, therefore the annealing process has little effect on the fluorescence of Cy3. We optimized reaction conditions to ensure that all measurements were carried out in the linear region ( Figure S2 ). As a one minute time-point was in the linear region, we then probed the larger) than the ATPase IC 50 values, it was observed that the inhibitors followed the same general trends as those observed for the ATPase data. Bananin, iodobabulky side groups on the six-membered ring of this nanin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin were effective inclass of compounds reduce their inhibitory activity hibitors of helicase activity, while ansabanin and adenagainst the SCV helicase.\n\ninobananin barely inhibit the reaction. We also checked whether bananin would inhibit the We also performed a final control to check whether unstimulated basal ATPase activity in the absence of bananin acted as a general helicase inhibitor or not. We dT 24 of the SCV helicase ( Figure 2B ). It is clear that cloned and purified the E. coli DnaB helicase, which is bananin is not an effective inhibitor of the unstimulated a well characterized helicase with 5# to 3# polarity of ATPase activity, although slight inhibition was observed unwinding [35] . The purity of DnaB may be observed at 100 \u00b5M.\n\nby SDS-PAGE in Figure S3A . We found that 250 \u00b5M We then tested the mechanism of inhibition of the bananin did not inhibit DnaB in our FRET-based assay ATPase activity by bananin, and checked competition ( Figure S3B ). These results suggest that bananin does with respect to both ATP (Figures 3A and 3B ) and with respect to dT 24 (Figures 3C and 3D) . Figures 3B and 3D not act as a general helicase inhibitor. \n\nThe potency of these inhibitors against the SCV helicase enzymatic activities prompted us to investigate effects were observed three days after infection with the serial dilutions, thereby allowing measurement of their ability to inhibit SCV replication in a cell culture system.

The ATPase inhibition results were consistent with those from the helicase assays: bananin, vanillinbananin, eubananin, and iodobananin were the best inhibitors of DNA-unwinding, while ansabanin and adeninobananin were poor inhibitors. Generally, the helicase inhibition activities measured for each compound, as determined by IC 50 values, were less than the corresponding ATPase inhibition activities, but the trends remained consistent. This appears to be a characteristic common to many helicase inhibitors [24, 25] .\n\nBananin, which acted as an effective inhibitor in both enzymatic assays and is the prototypical member of this class of compounds, was tested in a First, this would suggest that the compound does not helicase for several structurally unusual trioxa-adainhibit a viral entry process.
