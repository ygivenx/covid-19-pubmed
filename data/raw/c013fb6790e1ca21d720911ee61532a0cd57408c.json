{"title": "A model for COVID-19 prediction in Iran based on China parameters", "body": "Transmission of coronavirus-associated pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019 (1) . According to the latest WHO report on 11 March 2020, there were 118,329 confirmed cases and 4627 deaths worldwide, with 8042 confirmed cases and 291 deaths reported in Iran (2). The World Health Organization (WHO) named it a global pandemic on 11\n\nMarch 2020 because of the rapid outbreak of the disease worldwide (3) . The course of each epidemic depends on a number of important factors such as the Basic Reproductive Rate, the doubling time or serial interval, and the fatality rate. Estimating the epidemiological factors of COVID-19 and modeling-based prediction are useful in assessing epidemic transmission rates, predicting epidemic trends, and designing control measures (4, 5) .\n\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. What happened in China showed that quarantine, evacuation, and isolation of infected populations can become epidemic. This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for many countries where COVID-19 has begun to expand. However, it is not clear that other countries can implement the measures that the Chinese eventually adopted to reduce and control the incidence in the future (4, 6 \n\nEach parameter is defined as follows:\n\n.

This allowed us to estimate parameters by accessing more data Figures (1-4) .\n\nStep2: We put the fitting function for \u03b2(t), in the first step along with the actual trend parameters of Iran in Figures (5-7) and found that the behavior parameters of Iran are similar to\n\nChina.\n\nStep3: The conclusion of step 2 has many benefits for us because we cannot obtain the behavior of the parameters for Iran. Accordingly, we can use the Chinese parameters to predict the number of Iranian patients in the last step ( Figure 8 ).\n\nBut the question remained on how to fit each parameter in China model. Many data in the environmental sciences do not fit simple linear models and are best described by \"wiggly models\", also known as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). We used GAMs to estimate \u03b2(t), and models fit by REML (Restricted Maximum likelihood)\n\nOne of the main reasons for using GAMs models was that we did not know the distributions of parameters, so we could not use a parametric approach like non-linear least squares (NLS).\n\nWe did all the analysis with R software. Also, mgcv package in R was used to fit generalized additive models.\n\nThe first phase (03.12.2020 -03.15.2020): We expect daily diagnoses to increase from 1002 to 1095 until the end of the initial phase.\n\nThe third phase (03.26.2020 -04.10.2020): In this phase, it is expected that the downward trend will continue until 04. 10 .2020 if the intervention measures continue at current intensity.\n\n.

Virus tracking. In addition, the main source of the virus must be traced to understand the origin of the virus and effective measures must be taken to completely eliminate the source of the virus (9-11).\n\n.

New mobile hospitals should be built that can handle suspected cases in a centralized manner. This is essential to alleviate the pressure of treating the masses of infected patients in large hospitals. For example, during this outbreak, the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan lasted only 10 days to be built for people infected with coronavirus. During the whole process, the epidemic situation should be reported in a timely and transparent manner. It also prevents unexpected public pressure and reduces unnecessary mental health problems.\n\nArtificial intelligence technology can play a key role in almost every aspect including traffic management, infection detection, logistics supply chain, etc. This is a very important feature of a modern data-driven smart city. If the status of each citizen is listed, all can be accurately tracked and any population can be accommodated. Therefore, the flow of population can be controlled in a more orderly manner. Artificial intelligence technologies can be used to employ smart devices to support diagnosis and treatment, and can be used in telecommunications, online training and intelligent manufacturing to ensure minimal disruption to people's lives. Some hospitals use smart systems. Train stations can install powerful thermal imagers to measure the body temperature of passengers. Overall, efficiency and speed are very important in the control process, and conflicting research needs to be conducted (9-11).\n\nIn response to the outbreak, China expanded its day-to-day contact with the WHO, regardless of economic disadvantages, and developed comprehensive multifaceted approaches to tackle the virus and prevent further exposure to the virus by taking rigorous and unprecedented measures arising from a sense of responsibility to citizens. It also disseminated its epidemic information .

How people respond to recommendations on preventing transmission is more important than government measures. The government's strategy of communicating with the public to inform them about infection prevention is also crucial. Extra support for managing the recession is also important. However, it is not clear that other countries can implement the measures that the Chinese eventually adopted to reduce and control the incidence in the future. Extensive capacity is needed for such a level of medical care, which is a health emergency and is particularly challenging. We hope that the analytical results of this study will help to clarify important aspects of the outbreak so that the spread of coronavirus in different locations can be minimized in the shortest possible time.\n\nOne of the limitations of this study is the uncertainty of data on the first days of the epidemic in Iran. The distribution of data in the first week of the epidemic was such that the fitting of each parameter of the model with Iranian data through NLS or polynomial regression models posed problems so that we could not identify a better model with AIC or BIC criteria\n\nThe most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.\n\n.
