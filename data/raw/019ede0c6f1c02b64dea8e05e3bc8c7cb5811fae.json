{"title": "", "body": "been 4 cases with unknown dates of illness onset since June 15, but this substitution actually enabled us to conservatively argue the time to declare the end of outbreak: counting the waiting period from the date of diagnosis elevates the actual probability of the freedom from infection (4) .\n\nConsidering that illness developed in 2 persons on July 2, the end of MERS outbreak could be declared on July 31, at the earliest, following the WHO criteria. Nevertheless, to be conservative with the WHO method, counting the diagnosis date of 1 of the latest cases, July 4, as the first day, the earliest date to declare the end of outbreak may be August 2 (5).\n\nTo propose a more objective approach, 2 pieces of epidemiologic information were used.\n\nFirst, we used the distribution of the serial interval, i.e., the time from illness onset of a primary case to illness onset of the secondary case in a person who directly acquired infection from the primary case-patient (6) . An analysis of epidemiologic data in South Korea estimated the mean Page 2 of 6 and SD of the serial interval at 12.6 and 2.8 days, respectively (3). In the following, the cumulative distribution function of the serial interval is denoted by F(t) which was assumed to follow a gamma distribution. Second, we used parameters that govern the transmissibility of MERS, i.e., R0 at 0.75 and dispersion parameter k at 0.14 of a negative binomial distribution (7), which did not significantly deviate from published estimates in earlier studies (8, 9) . By using the estimated reproduction number and dispersion parameter, the cluster size of >150 cases was not unexpected (10) . These parameters are applicable to an initial exponential growth phase without interventions, and not specifically applicable to a nonlinear phase under contact tracing practice. Thus, it should be remembered that the use of these parameters would lead to an overestimation of the probability of observing additional cases, and thus, the proposed approach is deemed conservative. To address parameter uncertainties, we used a bivariate normal distribution that accounts for parameter dependence and resampled randomly drawn combinations of R0 and k as practiced before (7). The similar resampling was conducted for the serial interval distribution (i.e., the mean and the standard deviation) (3).\n\nHere we devise a model that calculates the probability of observing additional cases at a given calendar time, counting waiting time from dates of illness onset in potential primary cases. If 1 minus this probability is >95% on a given date, one can be 95% sure that the outbreak is over by that date. For simplicity, we ignore potential asymptomatic infection with MERS coronavirus in the following analysis.\n\nIf we were concerned with only a single (potential) secondary case, the probability that an outbreak is over at t days since the date of illness onset in the potential primary case would be Page 3 of 6 given by F(t) (11) . Nevertheless, an appropriate computation of the probability of observing additional cases on a calendar date involves 3 major obstacles that require some improvements.\n\nFirst, there can be multiple cases on the latest date, which was actually the situation for the MERS outbreak in South Korea. If there are 2 cases, the absence of transmission will be calculated at (F(t)) 2 , assuming that 2 cases independently produce secondary cases, and thus, the probability of observing at least 1 case is calculated as 1\u2212(F(t)) 2 . If there are n cases, the probability of observing additional cases is obtained as 1\u2212(F(t)) n . Second, there can be several persons who developed the illness on different dates around the latest time. Suppose that the days elapsed from 2 persons with different dates of illness onset were t1 and t2, the probability of observing additional cases will have to be calculated as 1\u2212F(t1)F(t2). Third, we have to address the potential for observing multiple secondary cases produced by a single primary case, e.g., multiple infections among healthcare workers who were exposed to an admitted patient. The variation in the number of secondary cases per single primary case can be addressed by using both R0 and k, which could even partially capture the emergence of superspreaders. Let py be the probability that the number of secondary cases is y, i.e., py = Pr(Y = y). Using the dataset of ti, the calendar date of illness onset of diagnosed cases i (i = 0,1,..,185), the probability of observing additional cases in future at calendar date t is calculated as and k were run 10,000 times, enabling us to take percentile points for the calculation of uncertainty bounds.\n\nThe calculated probability is interpreted as the risk of observing at least 1 more case on or after a specified date and has a good potential to assist objective determination of the end of outbreak. The model efficiently addressed 3 practical problems in objectively calculating the probability that an outbreak leads to the end: 1) multiple cases on the latest date, 2) several recent cases with different illness onset dates, and 3) variations in the number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case.\n\nThe cutoff probability is arbitrarily determined, as practiced to determine the length of quarantine period using the incubation period (4). Despite arbitrariness, p value in all hypothesis testing is determined in the same fashion. Rather than the issue of adopting a specific threshold probability, the point of devising the proposed model is to explicitly calculate the probability of observing additional cases at a given point in time. Relying on the use of the incubation period can be feasible only when the exact time of exposure is known for all traced contacts, but such situation is usually not the case for directly transmitted diseases, and thus, one should remember that the incubation period is applicable to specific settings with known times of exposure among all potential contacts."}
