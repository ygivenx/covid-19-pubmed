{"title": "", "body": "Pneumomediastinum is defined as the presence of air or gas in the mediastinum. Its etiology may be primary (spontaneous pneumomediastinum) or secondary (traumatic pneumomediastinum). 1 Spontaneous pneumomediastinum was defined as a specific clinical syndrome by Laennec in 1819. In 1944 Macklin and Macklin 2 described the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the syndrome, and their description is still valid today. Since then few cases have been reported, and with few exceptions, these have tended to be isolated cases rather than large series. 3 Trigger factors have been described as all those noniatrogenic factors contributing to an increase in the pressure gradient between the alveoli and the interstitium. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Clinical presentation varies widely from one series to another and there are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms. 3, 9, 10 The presence of Hamman's sign (pericardial crunch synchronized with the heart beat) is quite variable (5%-85%) and is not currently considered to be a characteristic sign. 9 We report a series of 36 cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed and treated in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2003.\n\nWe Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is defined as a primary process characterized by the presence of air or gas in the mediastinum. We report all the cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum diagnosed in our hospital between January 1996 and December 2004. We developed a protocol for data collection that included the following: medical history, triggers, signs, radiology, treatment, hospital stay, and complications. During this period we diagnosed 36 cases-25 men (69.4%) and 11 women (30.6%)-with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 11-90 years) and a mean hospital stay of 8.56 days (range, 1-53 days). The most common clinical presentation was chest pain, either isolated (27%) or with associated dyspnea (19.4%). A triggering factor was identified for 14 patients (38.8%). There was no associated morbidity or mortality. In view of our findings, we concluded that spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon entity with considerable clinical variability and that correct diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion. Radiography provides the best evidence for diagnosis. Neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo: estudio descriptivo de nuestra experiencia basada en 36 casos El neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo se define como la presencia de aire o gas en el mediastino de forma primaria. Presentamos todos los casos de neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo hallados en nuestro hospital entre enero de 1996 y diciembre de 2004. Para ello, elaboramos un protocolo de recogida de datos que incluy\u00f3: antecedentes personales, desencadenantes, semiolog\u00eda, radiolog\u00eda, tratamiento, estancia y complicaciones. En este per\u00edodo diagnosticamos 36 casos -25 varones (69,4%) y 11 mujeres (27,5%)-, con una edad media de 36,8 a\u00f1os (rango: 11-90) y estancia media de 8,56 d\u00edas (rango: 1-53). El cuadro cl\u00ednico m\u00e1s habitual fue el dolor tor\u00e1cico, aislado (27%) o asociado a disnea (19,4%). En 14 pacientes (38,8%) hubo factor desencadenante. No hubo morbimortalidad asociada al proceso. Por todo ello, se concluye que el neumomediastino espont\u00e1neo es una entidad infrecuente, con gran variabilidad cl\u00ednica, cuyo diagn\u00f3stico correcto exige un alto \u00edndice de sospecha, y la radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax es la prueba id\u00f3nea para ello.\n\ninhabitants, with an average of 87 600 emergency room consultations per year.\n\nThrough the hospital admissions' Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) we obtained the identity of all those patients who had been admitted with a diagnosis of spontaneous pneumomediastinum between the above-mentioned dates. We developed a protocol for data collection, shown in Table 1 . The protocol was implemented using the patents' clinical records obtained from the MBDS.\n\nOur series consisted of 36 patients, 25 (69.4%) men and 11 (30.6%) women, with a mean age of 36.8 years (range, 11-90 years). The mean number of cases diagnosed each year was 4.5 (range, 2-13). This accounted for 0.0051% of the hospital's annual emergency consultations.\n\nFifty percent of the cases (n=18) were admitted to the general surgery ward, with a mean of 2.25 cases per year (range, 1-7). The remaining 50% were distributed between the internal medicine and respiratory medicine wards, with a mean of 2.25 cases per year (range, 1-3).\n\nThe mean overall hospital stay was 8.56 days (range, 1-53 days). The mean stay for patients admitted to the general surgery ward was 6 days (range, 1-18 days), compared to 8.7 days (range, 1-53 days) for those admitted to the other 2 wards. Table 2 shows the patients' signs and symptoms upon presentation to the emergency room and Table 3 the relevant medical history and trigger factors. The most frequent symptom was chest pain (27.8%), followed by chest pain with associated dyspnea (19.4%), and isolated dyspnea (22.2%). There were no particularly frequent clinical signs. The presence of Hamman's sign was very infrequent (5.6%). Regarding blood test results, it is noteworthy that 94.4% of patients showed no variation in values, while 2 patients with pneumonia showed slight leukocytosis. All the patients were diagnosed by simple posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography ( Figure) , and no further imaging tests were needed in any case. Simple radiography was also used to monitor course of disease.\n\nThe 18 patients admitted to the general surgery ward were young and had no relevant medical history. The rest of the patients were admitted either to the respiratory medicine ward (n=10) or the internal medicine ward (n=8), depending on whether they had other associated diseases. We were able to identify a trigger factor for only 14 patients (38.9%). The most frequent triggers were asthma attacks (10%) and catarrh (10%). There was only 1 case associated with the use of inhaled street drugs, that of a 30 year-old habitual user of inhaled cocaine. In our series, 58.3% of patients diagnosed had a previous history of respiratory disease (asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). A third of the patients were smokers (at least 20 cigarettes per day). No differences in incidence were found to be associated with place of residence (rural or urban) or with occupation. None of the patients underwent surgery, and there were no associated complications. There were no deaths related to the episode of pneumomediastinum. *Percentages were calculated on the total number of patients (n=36) with the exception of the rates for asthma and COPD (n=14). COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \u2020Information available for 14 patients.\n\nSpontaneous pneumomediastinum is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinal space that is not due to previous injury or surgery. 1 While frequency is estimated to be low, the real incidence has not been established as few publications mention this entity and reports have always been of small series. The incidence we report is considerably lower than that observed by other authors, 3 probably due to an overestimation of real incidence.\n\nWe found spontaneous pneumomediastinum to be frequently associated with preexisting respiratory disease (asthma and COPD). This high association with asthma has not been observed in the series reported by Panacek et al 10 or in the majority of recent studies. 9, 11, 12 One recently published study showed an association with asthma that was considerably higher than that reported in the rest of the literature, however. 3 We also found a high association with smoking and this has seldom been mentioned in the literature. 9 Unlike other authors, we found a very low association with the use of inhaled street drugs. 9, 13, 14 It must be remembered that ours was a retrospective study, and so there may have been some recall bias in the data collected. Regarding the possibility of classification biases reported with the use of the MBDS, 15 it should be pointed out that our study used the MBDS only as a starting point, and that clinical histories were subsequently reviewed to verify the correct classification of the episode. We believe, therefore, that any classification bias that may exist is minimal.\n\nIn the literature, spontaneous pneumomediastinum has been associated with trigger factors in approximately 75% of cases. The most common trigger factors are cough, physical exercise, and drug abuse. 9, 14 In our series we found a lower association with trigger factors, and of these the most frequent were related to diseases of the lung and airways.\n\nThe most common clinical picture at presentation in our series was very similar to that reported in nearly all other published series. 3, 9, 10, 11, 16 Clinical findings were few and, while similar to those published in other studies, the frequency of each was lower. 3, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 We found the incidence of Hamman's sign to be low.\n\nFor all patients, simple chest radiography gave a firm diagnosis and allowed the course of disease to be monitored adequately. The diagnostic capacity of chest radiography is such that we do not consider it necessary to use computed tomography in managing this disease, as some authors recommend, 11, 17, 18 or to perform esophagograms or electrocardiograms. 3, 10 With conservative treatment (analgesia and oxygen therapy), all of the cases were resolved. There were no associated complications or mortality. The mean hospital stay in our series was somewhat higher than in others, 3, 9, 10 probably due to the absence of any other associated underlying disease in the patients in other series. In our series, more than half the patients had associated diseases, thus accounting for longer periods of hospitalization. Studies have recently been published in which a correlation was found between longer hospital stay and the presence of comorbidity. 19, 20 Mean hospital stays in the general surgery ward (young patients with no relevant medical history) were very similar to those published. 3, 9, 10, 12 Given the success of conservative management of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and the absence of complications, the suitability of outpatient treatment and follow-up could be considered in stable patients, as other authors have suggested. 10, 13 Due to the considerable clinical variability and low incidence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum, correct diagnosis of this disease requires maintaining a high level of suspicion, especially in young patients (between 20 and 40 years), men (3:1), those with a history of bronchial asthma or smoking, and those who present with a clinical picture that includes the spontaneous appearance of chest pain, either isolated or with associated dyspnea. Simple chest radiography (posteroanterior and lateral) will lead to a definitive diagnosis."}
