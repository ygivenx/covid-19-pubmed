{"title": "Point-of -Care Testing for Disasters : Needs Assessment, Strategic Planning, and Future Design Biohazard containment Hurricane Katrina Modular test design Newdemics Sampling method Small-world network (SWN) Tsunami", "body": "The 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina in the United States exposed the lack of disaster preparedness worldwide. 1 Although the feasibility of POCT was proven, and the disaster responses were extensive, follow-up studies showed rescue was slow and inadequate. 1 In Hurricane Katrina, flooded hospitals, roads, and communications hindered rescue efforts by first responders who carried limited POCT devices such as oxygen saturation monitors (pulse oximeters), blood glucose meters, and other small handhelds. 1 Furthermore, POCT instruments failed to operate effectively under adverse environmental conditions at respective disaster locations, where temperatures reached 110 F (43 C) or higher in hospitals. 2, 3 Broadly regional catastrophes, such as these recent ''newdemics,'' 4,5 lead to sequentially magnified setbacks. Others, such as the current novel H1N1 pandemic, threaten entire nations. Typically, communities lack the POCT resources necessary to effectively handle the disaster situations they face. 1 Conversely, newdemics highlight the significant potential for POCT to positively impact preparedness, disaster response, and patient outcomes. Current experiences, including the surprise appearance of the novel H1N1 pandemic in Mexico (unpublished observation), emphasize the need for new sturdy, handheld, and robust POC technologies capable of effectively operating in a variety of field locations.\n\nIn the future, better prepared first responders will carry reliable POCT diagnostics wherever disaster and emergency situations arise. Thus, POC user needs are being established through objective evidence-based national surveys (see Table 1 ) as a first step in identifying suitable device designs, effective test clusters, and environmental operating conditions. 6 The preliminary survey results are reported.\n\nForty disaster care experts were randomly selected from the editorial boards of the American Journal of Disaster Medicine (AJDM) and Disaster Medicine Public Health and Preparedness (DMPHP) using a random number generator (Minitab, State College, PA). This sample included physicians, public health officials, researchers, pathologists, first responders, and military personnel. Four Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the survey.

''Visual logistics,'' defined as graphics and pictorial media for common sense portrayal of questions, concepts, and designs, are introduced to build survey questions with the objective of generating easy to comprehend concepts without laborious text or lengthy explanation. Set theory (eg, Venn diagrams) was used whenever possible to compare 2 or more visual concepts, questions, and the results.\n\nTo encourage participation and simplify distribution and return, a visual logistics web-based survey was developed (SurveyMonkey, Portland, Oregon). Paper-based and web-based surveys used identical graphics and questions. The survey was divided into 4 parts: (1) demographic questions, (2) device design questions in 10 sections, (3) pathogen test cluster design questions in 4 sections, and (4) trade-off blocks that led to heuristic ranking of POC design features. At the time of this preliminary report, parts 1 to 3 were implemented.\n\nIf possible, personal contact was initiated by phone followed by shipment of a FedEx package containing an invitation letter, the paper-based survey, and a prepaid return envelope. The invitation letter explained the goal of the survey, provided instructions for participation, and included a hyperlink to the web-based survey (see Table 1 ). Email also was used to distribute the survey request and hyperlink. This preliminary report reflects survey results obtained between March 1 and June 14, 2009. The survey was conducted in compliance with the UC Davis Institutional Review Board.\n\nData obtained from the survey were analyzed using nonparametric Pearson chi-square exact tests (SAS, Gary, North Carolina). Statistical significance was defined as: *, P<.05; **, P<.01; and ***, P<.001.\n\nPathogen test cluster rank results were analyzed by assigning each pathogen a weighted score. The score for each rank was calculated using the following equation: S i 5 \u00f011 \u00c0 R i \u00de. R i is defined as the rank of each pathogen assigned by a survey participant, such that i 5 \u00bd1; n, where n is the number of ranks. When the respondent designated the same rank for 2 or more organisms, the average rank was calculated and assigned to each organism.\n\nThe weighted score was calculated by summing the product of each score and corresponding frequency using the following equation: WS j 5 P i51 S i \u00c2 F ij . The frequency, F ij is defined as the number of times survey participants ranked a pathogen a specific value, such that j 5 \u00bd1; N, where N is the number of pathogens.\n\nOf the 40 disaster medicine experts surveyed, 25 responses were received, giving a response rate of 62%. The respondents included 8 physicians (32%), 9 public health officials/hospital managers (36%), 3 pathologists (12%), and 5 emergency room doctors (20%). given clinical settings. The results showed that in disaster settings, respondents showed a significant preference for handheld diagnostics (Fig. 2 ) and cited increased portability and versatility as the rationale. When respondents were asked to choose between a device that tests multiple patient samples in parallel for a single pathogen versus a device that performs multiplex testing of several pathogens for a single patient sample (Fig. 3) , respondents preferred a multiplex test in the urgent care and emergency room settings (Fig. 4) . Participants cited the need to quickly screen a large volume of patients in a disaster setting, whereas a full workup is necessary in urgent care and emergency room settings. Several of the respondents who chose the device that parallel processes multiple patient samples for a single pathogen given a disaster setting, referenced biothreat or pandemic scenarios. Fig. 5 shows 2 different sample collection methods, a test cassette and vacutainer. A test cassette provides a housing platform in which one can automate preanalytical processing steps that are critical to subsequent analytical steps that follow on the POC device. Fig. 6 reflects general acceptance of test cassettes in disaster, urgent care, and emergency settings.\n\nRespondents were also asked to state their preference between 2 potential waste disposal methods (Fig. 7) . The first scheme suggests an instrument that stores biohazard waste in a reusable waste storage reservoir to be emptied periodically. A test cassette, used to transport the sample to the instrument, would also need to be properly discarded after a single use. The second scheme shows an instrument that stores all biohazard waste in the disposable test cassette, which then is discarded after a single use. Fig. 8 shows a statistically significant preference of respondents for the disposable test cassette in the second scheme across all 3 clinical settings, with a higher level of statistical significance (P<.01) of the preference in disaster and emergency room settings. Table 2 shows the weighted scores of the top 10 pathogens for each of 4 scenario sections. For a general disaster test cluster, Vibrio cholerae had the highest weighted score (117); whereas for a blood donor screening test cluster, HIV 1 and 2 had the highest weighted score (224). Depending on the clinical scenario, the specific Fig. 4 . Selection of testing method by survey respondents. In disaster settings, both approaches to pathogen detection may be useful. However, respondents preferred multiplex testing to testing multiple patients for 1 pathogen in urgent care (***P<.001) and emergency room (**P<.01) settings.\n\nTest cassettes versus vacutainers. Visual logistics were used to illustrate 2 sample collection methods for POCT instruments. (A) A vacutainer is used to collect the blood sample, allowing for multiple blood collection tubes to be drawn at one time.

Graphics updated for the survey currently in use.\n\npathogens a POC device would detect varies. For instance, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) had the highest weighted score at 147 for the bloodstream pathogen test cluster (see Table 2 ). However, in the pandemic test cluster, influenza A/B had the highest weighted score at 189, whereas MRSA was fifth with a weighted score of 112.5 (see Table 2 ).\n\nVarious POCT devices that test for a variety of analytes and pathogens are used during disaster and emergency situations, such as Hurricane Katrina. Emergency medical responders, disaster medical assistance teams (DMATs), international medicalsurgical response teams (IMSuRTs), and other first responders deploy to disaster sites carrying POCT devices. 6 They use POCT devices to test, rapidly diagnose, and, as indicated, treat victims. 6 Depending on where responders are deployed, the pathogens they encounter will vary, possibly unpredictably and unexpectedly. Table 3 7-32 documents the variety of pathogens present in several modern disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes, and earthquakes. When comparing the top 10 pathogens identified by preliminary needs assessment survey results in various disaster scenarios (see Table 2 ) with pathogens found in major disasters, there was substantial overlap.\n\nDuring Hurricane Katrina, for example, various pathogens were identified that also were selected and ranked by experts and surveyed as high priority for general disaster, blood donor screening, bloodstream pathogen, and pandemic test clusters. Specifically, in Table 2 for the general disaster scenario and in Table 3 for Hurricane Katrina, there is overlap for Vibrio cholerae, MRSA, and Escherichia coli. Thus, preliminary survey results demonstrate that survey experts identified pathogens encountered at disaster sites (see Table 3 ) as important for having POCT devices capable of detecting these organisms (see Table 2 ). A similar finding was observed when comparing pathogens detected at the tsunami disaster site in Southeast Asia (see Table 3 ) versus the general disaster and bloodstream pathogen test clusters ranked highly in Table 2 . Survey results identified several pathogens in the general disaster and bloodstream pathogen test clusters, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA, and Salmonella species. These pathogens also were detected at tsunami disaster \n\nNew POC devices must be capable of testing for a variety of pathogens present at a particular disaster site, and also properly integrated and used to decrease response 16 Salmonella paratyphi (blood) Water, food borne Nonspecific 17, 18 Streptococcus pneumoniae (blood) Inhalation (continued on next page) times and improve patient outcomes. During Hurricane Katrina, a variety of different locations and types of POCT were used featuring an array of POC tests covering chemistry, hematology, and other analyte categories. Fig. 9 highlights POC instruments, including the various locations and POCT operators in Hurricane Katrina. Hospitals, evacuation sites, and local agencies were not prepared for the disaster and offered few POCT devices and tests. Hurricane Katrina is an example of a newdemic. 5 Supplies depleted quickly. Needs for chronic monitoring, such as outpatient glucose monitoring, were not met. Fig. 10 displays Hurricane Katrina disaster sites, arrival, and responses of mostly military assets, and a suggested optimal POCT plan (upper right in figure) for timely disaster response. Fig. 10 also documents that the disaster response time was slow. Current POCT disaster preparation does not meet adequate standards and must be improved for future preparedness. Proper strategic placement of POCT, possibly in alternate medical care facilities, is needed to facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment. 33 Pandemic influenza strains, such as novel H1N1, have the potential to significantly increase mortality and morbidity, as well as quickly deplete resources of current health care infrastructures. Thus, for example, rapidly diagnosing a particular influenza strain using POCT devices is advantageous. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends the use of POCT devices for quick influenza diagnosis. Commercially available POC tests for influenza A and B are listed in Table 4 . [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Several of the tests currently available are immunoassays that target nucleoprotein or matrix protein to identify influenza A or B types, but rarely offer further subtyping.\n\nHowever, nucleic acid recognition (NAR) for detection of influenza A or B has shown promising benefits (see Table 4 ). These NAR devices exhibit greater sensitivity and can provide subtyping data. Once a subtype of influenza is positively identified, health care personnel and public health workers have the ability to start surveillance of new strains in a particular area. In addition, subtyping of influenza has the ability to guide antiviral treatment by identifying particular influenza strains that may be resistant or sensitive to antiviral treatment. For instance, several H1N1 strains of influenza were resistant to oseltamivir in fall 2008; however, in spring 2009, the novel H1N1 influenza strain (''swine flu'') was sensitive to oseltamivir. Furthermore, in a recent study conducted by Dr Nishiura and colleagues, 39 the use of quarantine and rapid diagnostic testing to prevent or delay the spread of pandemic influenza across island nations was evaluated. In order for quarantine strategy to be effective in preventing or delaying the spread of pandemic influenza, rapid and reliable diagnostic testing must be used to positively identify index cases (first victims) with influenza. 39 Thus, the use of POCT to rapidly diagnose and subtype influenza has significant potential to refine pandemic disaster response and prevent newdemics from spreading outside the bounds of initial disaster or emergency locations.\n\nThis concept is important for disasters on the horizon, such as extensively drugresistant malaria and tuberculosis. Globally, tuberculosis represents a major problem, especially in low-resource settings, such as impoverished African nations. Current tests available often fail to correctly identify tuberculosis, are not rapid, and cannot identify drug resistance. 40 Rapid-liquid culture shows promising results for tuberculosis detection by improving the sensitivity, speed, reliability, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis detection. 40 Future thinking is required for developing POCT devices that are proven to simultaneously be rapid, simple, reliable, and cost-effective for diagnosing extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. 40\n\nPOCT devices typically encounter harsh environmental conditions, temperature extremes, and high humidity in emergency and disaster care. Despite substantial improvements, gaps still exist between current POCT technologies and real-world needs. Inability of POCT instruments and reagents to withstand harsh conditions present at disaster and emergency sites compromises performance. 6 For example, glucose test strips and blood gas cartridges may not provide accurate measurements at disaster sites because thermal stresses adversely and inconsistently affect performance. 6 Because of these types of limitations and the obvious technical gaps in POC devices as we know them today, the United States and other countries are not prepared for disasters.\n\nBox 1 highlights gaps between current POC devices and various problems with technologies currently available. Without durable and robust POCT equipment, diagnosis and treatment of victims at disaster sites becomes increasingly complicated and hindered. To effectively and efficiently diagnose, monitor, and treat patients, the current gaps in POCT technologies and devices must be closed. The POC Technologies Center (http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pathology/poctcenter) is currently conducting static and dynamic environmental stress tests to understand the environmental limitations of POC devices and reagents in more detail.\n\nDynamic tests simulate realistic meteorologic conditions found in world regions with high risk for newdemics. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product labelings typically state temperature limits, but current limits are inadequate for most disaster conditions. Also, a POCT method that may be proven to work in environmental extremes must also be validated for critically ill patient populations, which few currently do.\n\nProblems with preanalytical processing present an additional major challenge for reliable POCT device performance. For example, in a recent study conducted by Dighe and colleagues, 41 unusually high false-positive potassium critical values led the laboratory to investigate the preanalytical processing after concluding that the instrument was not the source of the errors. Laboratory personnel noted that when false-positive potassium critical values were seen, a hemoglobin A1C test was also ordered.\n\nOn investigation of the sample processing, Dighe and colleagues 41 found that both tubes were being packaged with ice and transported to the testing facility. Icing blood tubes has been shown to lyse red blood cells and falsely elevate potassium levels. 41 Laboratory technologists subsequently altered the transport requirement for hemoglobin A1C and observed a substantial decrease in potassium false-positive values in ensuing months. 41 When POCT devices are reliable, these types of preanalytical Mutations and detection of multiresistant strains (eg, tuberculosis) in challenging environments\n\nFull user awareness of performance characteristics based on field evaluations Informatics compatibility, connectivity, and archival in small-world networks Risk indexing of diagnostic targets, wireless results reporting, and outcomes monitoring Cost-effectiveness for implementation in low-resource settings problems can be minimized or eliminated. To ensure best patient care, preanalytical processing methods used on field-worthy POCT devices should be self-contained and disposable, but free from confounding preanalytical errors.\n\nBox 1 lists several other gaps that need to be addressed. For example, the introduction of locally smooth median absolute difference (LS MAD) curves as a mathematical statistical method to visually analyze the accuracy of POCT blood glucose meters shows that performance in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges of most blood glucose meters in current use exceeds error tolerance limits for adult critically ill patient populations. 42, 43 POCT technologies intended for emergency and disaster settings and critically ill patient populations can be improved, standardized, and verified with this new math (see Box 1) to enable better performance and patient outcomes.\n\nThe search and discovery of novel new POC technologies should be actively pursued by researchers. Devices are needed in various global environments across the world. In these different conditions, POCT will encounter new challenges to be overcome. As noted above, POCT instruments must be environmentally robust and capable of withstanding dynamic stresses (see Box 1). In addition, POCT devices should be capable of diagnosing multiple pathogens with adequate clinical sensitivity and specificity (see Box 1), ideally including extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, malaria, and influenza. New and novel POCT devices will be created in the future featuring improved operational characteristics, environmental robustness, diagnostic performance, and knowledge optimization that enable disaster responders to rapidly diagnose and treat victims and fill current technology gaps.\n\nStrategic placement of POCT devices within small-world networks (SWN) will effectively facilitate rapid evidence-based medical decisions. 5 SWNs enable information to be transmitted quickly from site to site and facilitate quick triage of patients to appropriate points of evaluation. 5 SWNs can help manage POCT operations to improve overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness by integrating health care delivery components, including home monitoring, primary care unit testing, mobile medical unit, alternate medical care site, triage, emergency room, and local hospital resources. 5 Thus, when a disaster situation arises, such as Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami in Southeast Asia, or the novel H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, SWNs can effectively allocate POCT resources to allow for rapid and cost-effective patient care or isolation of index cases, as needed, that is also efficient within the context of regional resources. This strategic integration of POCT into regional aspects of disaster and emergency response will ensure that patient care will be rapid and effective.\n\nUse of POCT in disaster and emergency situations will efficiently facilitate rapid evidence-based diagnosis at the site of patient care. A variety of tests are currently available for POCT in hospitals, but the spectrum of POC tests for emergency and disaster care must be broadened.\n\nThe development of pathogen test clusters, based on needs assessment survey results, must be incorporated into new POCT device designs. Besides developing innovative POCT devices, current gaps in POCT technology and availability must be filled to ensure optimal patient care wherever the patient might be.\n\nIntegration and global use of POCT in emergencies will help prevent newdemics from accelerating as seen during Hurricane Katrina and the current influenza pandemic (novel H1N1), while simultaneously improving immediate patient care.\n\nWhen a disaster or emergency strikes and as POCT use becomes standard for SWN preparedness, emergency medical responders, alternate medical facilities, and hospitals will be ready to deal effectively with the crises and avoid the pitfalls of the past, when adequate POCT was not available or not used efficiently.\n\nHowever, given current state-of-the-art POCT, the United States and other countries are not prepared. Having environmentally robust and rapid POCT devices that are deployable to disaster and emergency sites, and also validated for the care of the critically ill, will bring care to the point of need where physicians and nurses can make fast, evidence-based decisions for triage and treatment."}
