{"title": "Proteomic approaches to uncovering virus\u2013host protein interactions during the\nprogression of viral infection", "body": "Viruses are fascinatingly diverse in composition, shape, size, tropism, and pathogenesis.\nInfectious virus particles can have core capsids that can be structurally helical, while\nothers are icosahedral. Some are enveloped with lipids and proteins, whereas others are not.\nViruses bear their genetic information as RNA or DNA, in a single strand or double-stranded\nhelix. For successful propagation, viruses depend on replication of their genomes, which\nitself may occur within the host cell cytoplasm or nucleus. For example, alphaviruses\nreplicate in the cytoplasm, such as Sindbis virus (SINV, Figure 1,\npanels 1b\u20137b). Conversely, herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1, Figure 1, panels 1a\u20137a), and the retrovirus, human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV, Figure 1, panels 1c\u20137c), replicate in the nucleus.\nViruses have a distinct tropism for host species and for cell types, although their\ncontinued coevolution with hosts has sometimes facilitated their capacity to infect new cell\ntypes and species.\n\nAt the core of virus replication and spread is the formation of virus\u2013host protein\ninteractions. One aspect to consider is the stark contrast between the proteomes of host\ncells and viral pathogens. The total protein complement of the genome in human cells, or\nproteome, is estimated at approximately 20,000 protein-encoding genes that, when taking into\naccount the copies per cell, can generate up to 3 million proteins per cubic micron [1,2]. Furthermore, the human proteome can\nbe further diversified by regulatory processes, including the presence of multiple\ntranscription start sites [3], alternative splicing [4\u20137], alternative mRNA polyadenylation\n[8], pre-mRNA editing [9], and\nposttranslational modifications [10,11]. Indeed, genomics studies have identified alternative splicing isoforms in up to\n60% of human genes [12,13].\nAdditionally, a large number of posttranslational modifications have been discovered that\nadd complexity and variability to the proteome [14]. The viral\nproteome can also be expanded by some of these regulatory processes. However, in contrast to\nthe human proteome, virus genomes encode far fewer proteins, ranging from 1 to approximately\n2500 that can be present in hundreds to thousands of copies per virion particle [15,16]. Therefore, even when encoding for\na small number of viral proteins, viral replication can still progress successfully by\nmaking use of dynamic interactions with the host. In fact, all viruses are obligate\nparasites and undergo evolutionarily conserved life cycles that dutifully depend on\nvirus\u2013host interactions, frequently mediated by protein\u2013protein associations.\n\nA complete infectious life cycle, regardless of virus classification, necessitates the\nattachment and entry of the virion particle into the host cell, viral translation of mRNA by\nhost ribosomes, viral genome replication, assembly of viral particles enclosing the genome,\nand release of infectious particles from the cell (Figure 1). As an\nexample, HSV-1 is a DNA virus that employs a temporal cascade of protein expression and\ninteractions with the host (Figure 1, panels 1a\u20137a). These\nvirus\u2013host protein interactions are aimed both at ensuring successful virus replication and\nat blocking host defense mechanisms. First, virion particles bind to host cell surface\nmoieties via viral glycoproteins (Figure 1, panel 1a). The fusion\nof the virion with the cellular plasma membrane leads to the release of the viral capsid\ncontaining the genome and matrix proteins into the cytoplasm. Through associations with\ncellular motor machinery, viral capsids traverse the cytoplasm, anchor at nuclear pores, and\nextrude the double-stranded viral DNA genome into the nucleus (Figure\n1, panel 2a) [17]. Concurrently, several incoming viral\nproteins are transported to various subcellular locations to regulate viral gene expression,\nas well as to inhibit cellular intrinsic and innate immune responses [18,19]. Within the nucleus, the expression of a highly\nregulated viral gene expression cascade is initiated and is organized into immediate-early,\nearly, and late gene expression (Figure 1, panel 3a). The host cell\nRNA polymerase is co-opted to begin transcribing viral immediate-early mRNAs. Upon\ncytoplasmic translation, immediate-early proteins are transported to the nucleus where they\nstimulate the transcription of early gene, and ultimately late gene products that are\nrequired for virion assembly. In the nucleus, immature capsids are packed with viral DNA and\nbud through the nuclear membranes, Golgi compartments, endosomes, and cell membranes to\nacquire matrix and envelope components that ultimately comprise a new fully infectious\nparticle (Figure 1, panels 4a\u20137a). Therefore, the establishment of\nvirus\u2013host and host\u2013host protein interactions that are temporally and spatially regulated is\ncritical for the progression of the virus life cycle, as well as for the modulation of host\nantiviral defenses.\n\nIn addition to providing mechanistic insights into the biology of an infection, knowledge\nof temporal virus\u2013host interactions can also reveal viral or host factors that can be\ntargeted in antiviral therapeutics. Viral pathogens such as HIV, Ebola, influenza, and\nhepatitis C virus represent significant threats to human health, yet efficacious antiviral\ntreatments are not readily available for many of them. Vaccines or effective treatments are\nalso lacking against other significant human pathogens that trigger lifelong infections and\nare global human health issues, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Dengue virus. The\nidentification and characterization of virus\u2013host protein interactions can point to\nessential events needed for viral entry, replication, or spread, which can be leveraged as\nnew avenues for antiviral therapeutics to predict, prevent, or treat virus-induced\nafflictions [20,21].\n\nThe last decade has witnessed the increasing application of proteomic approaches to\nvirology studies [22]. Technological advances in mass\nspectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, as well as in experimental workflows for antibody-based\nimmunoaffinity purification (AP) of protein complexes, have significantly accelerated the\nunbiased characterization of virus\u2013host protein interactions during viral infection. AP-MS\nhas been successfully implemented in virology studies to isolate virus\u2013virus and virus\u2013host\nmulti-protein complexes, allowing the identification of both indirect and direct protein\ninteractions. This approach has been used to either study interactions during the\nprogression of an infection, providing information about the temporality of interaction\nevents, or following the overexpression of individual viral gene products to gain insight\ninto the functions of single proteins (Figure 2A). The experimental\nconsiderations and examples of biological findings derived from AP-MS studies are detailed\nin the next sections.\n\nIn an effort to gain information about direct protein interactions during infection, other\nproteomic approaches have been implemented and are continuing to undergo development. Such\nmethods include yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) and cross-linking (Figure\n2B), and we discuss the advantages and limitations of these techniques in the\ncorresponding sections of this review.\n\nGiven the relevance of defining virus\u2013host protein interactions, more recently, a\nsignificant interest has been placed into developing proteomics approaches that allow\nhigh-throughput profiling of interactions. A method proven useful for such studies is based\non self-assembling protein array technology, and termed Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein\nArray (NAPPA) (Figure 2B). In our review, we dedicate one section\nto discussing this method and the biological findings derived from these studies.\n\nAltogether, these proteomics approaches have led to biological discoveries that have\nadvanced the current knowledge of how virus\u2013host multi-molecular protein assemblies modulate\nmechanisms of host cellular defense, virus replication, and virus subversion of host\ndefenses. Importantly, these approaches are broadly applicable to studying the life cycle\nand pathogenesis of many types of viruses that infect a diverse range of hosts, from human\nto mosquitos and plants.\n\nIn the following sections, we review the above-mentioned proteomic methodologies that have\nbeen successfully used for studying virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions. We explore the\nstrengths and limitations of these approaches, with an emphasis on understanding the spatial\nand temporal regulation of these protein interactions. Throughout the description of these\napproaches, we highlight important biological discoveries attributable to these studies, as\nwell as the diverse range of viruses that have been investigated using proteomics. We finish\nby providing a perspective of the promise that proteomics-based approaches hold for\ncontributing to fundamental findings in virology.\n\nIn early implementations of AP-MS to virology, studies targeted specific viral proteins\nat single time points of infection. As an example, the Knipe research group analyzed the\ninteraction partners of the HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP8 in human epidermoid HEp-2\ncells [35]. By isolating ICP8-associated protein complexes at\nan early time post infection in the life cycle of HSV-1, 6.5 h post infection (hpi), they\nidentified over 50 cellular and viral proteins, including host proteins that may be\ninvolved in viral replication, chromatin remodeling, or recombination repair pathways.\nUsing a similar approach, the Knipe group subsequently identified the eukaryotic\ntranslation initiation eIF3 subunits p47 and p116, eIF4G, and poly-adenylate binding\nprotein as cellular interactors of the HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP27 in human\nepidermoid cells at 6 hpi. These results suggested that ICP27 may interfere with viral or\nhost mRNA translation [36]. These interactions highlight the\nmultiple functions that can be acquired by a protein through the formation of distinct\ninteractions during the course of a productive infection. Despite the utility of\nantibodies against viral proteins, such reagents are limited by their availability and\noftentimes lack of high affinity required for AP-MS studies in infected cells. To\ncircumvent this restraint, AP may be conducted by using epitope-tagged viral strains.\n\nIf tags are to be employed in the context of an authentic viral infection, it is\nnecessary to generate a recombinant virus strain that is replication-competent and harbors\na full-length genome. This strategy has been exercised for a diverse array of RNA and DNA\nviruses. Furthermore, the use of a fluorescent tag allows tracking the localization of\nproteins in live cells, in parallel with the temporal regulation of virus\u2013host\ninteractions [25]. This was demonstrated for the first time by\nCristea et al. for the study of SINV protein interactions at different\ntime points of infection, in which a virus strain was constructed to express the\nnonstructural viral protein nsP3 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [24]. Using antibodies raised against GFP, proteins co-isolating\nwith nsP3 in fibroblasts were purified on magnetic beads and subjected to MS analyses\nafter different times during infection, that is 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hpi. This study led to\nthe discovery of time-specific interactions, with the early and stable recruitment of an\nendoribonuclease (G3BP), identified at all time points assessed, and the later recruitment\nof signaling proteins (14-3-3), identified only at the late 6, 8, and 10 hpi time points\nin the SINV life cycle. One hypothesis inspired by this finding and tested in a subsequent\nstudy from the same group was that the viral interaction with G3BP may serve to attenuate\nviral polyprotein expression during early stages of infection, while late 14-3-3\nrecruitment may be necessary for host translational shutoff [37]. Overall, this highlights the inherently transient nature of protein\nassociations throughout the progression of infection.\n\nThe use of GFP-tagged virus strains in conjunction with AP-MS laid the foundation for\nsubsequent studies on other types of viral infections, including HCMV, pseudorabies virus\n(PRV), and HSV-1 [38\u201343]. For\nexample, temporal interactions between HCMV virion components and host factors were used\nto predict that multiple intermediate vesicles are involved in the assembly of infectious\nparticles [43]. Using GFP-AP-MS studies in PRV infected neurons\n(neuronal growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells), the Enquist research group found that\nthe viral protein Us9 interacts with the cellular kinesin KIF1A. A PRV strain containing\nGFP-tagged Us9 was used to infect neurons for 20 h, after which neurons were lysed, and\nUs9 protein complexes were immunopurified using the anti-GFP antibody. As Us9 was known to\nbe critical for anterograde neuron-to-cell transport of virion particles [44], the authors further investigate this interaction,\ndemonstrating that KIF1A is required for the transport of viral capsid in axons and for\nthe spread of infection [42]. Similarly, GFP-AP-MS and live\ncell microscopy in HSV-1-infected primary human fibroblasts led to the discovery that the\nviral E3 ubiquitin ligase protein ICP0 does not only target host defense proteins for\nproteasome-dependent degradation, but also a viral protein, the outer tegument protein\npUL46. For this study, Lin et al. infected human fibroblasts with a\nstrain of HSV-1 that expressed GFP-tagged pUL46, and the cell lysate was collected at an\nearly and a late time of infection (6 and 14 hpi). The interaction between pUL46 and ICP0,\nobserved and validated at both time points, was further functionally characterized and\nproposed to likely act as an internal regulation of viral protein levels during the virus\nlife cycle [40].\n\nThe implementation of FLAG-tagged virus strains was also shown effective for studying\nprotein interactions during infection. Reitsma et al. used an HCMV strain\ncontaining FLAG-labeled pUL27 within its genetic locus to uncover virus\u2013host associations\nthat mediate a viral immune evasion strategy [39]. Upon\ninfection of primary human fibroblasts with the labeled HCMV virus strain, pUL27, a\nprotein of previously unknown function, was found to be necessary and sufficient to\ndestabilize and degrade a cellular acetyltransferase, Tip60. Cells were lysed after 24 h\nof infection, a relatively early time in the HCMV life cycle, and pUL27-containing protein\ncomplexes were isolated using anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to magnetic beads. The\nfindings from this study corroborated prior discoveries for the functions of the HIV\nprotein Tat and the human papilloma virus protein E6. Both Tat and E6 had been previously\ncharacterized as regulators of cellular Tip60 degradation in a proteasome-dependent\nfashion [45,46]. As such, the use of\nan unbiased AP-MS approach facilitated the further delineation of a potentially conserved\nviral offensive mechanism against host cells.\n\nStudies have also used host protein tagging and AP-MS to identify associated protein\npartners during infection. For example, Terhune et al. generated primary\nhuman fibroblast cell lines stably expressing the cellular histone deacetylase HDAC1\ntagged with GFP, and infected the cells with HCMV for 24 h [38]. By AP-MS, it was observed that the HDAC1-containing nucleosome remodeling and\ndeacetylase complex interacted with viral proteins pUL29/28 and pUL38. This association\nwas ultimately implicated in facilitating the production of immediate-early viral RNAs. It\nis noteworthy that the study of host protein interactions during infection does not always\nrely on the use of tagged cellular proteins. These experiments can be performed on\nendogenous proteins, when antibodies are available for efficient affinity purifications.\nFor example, the antiviral immune effector IFI16 was isolated at two early time points, 3\nand 8 hpi with HSV-1 by using a combination of monoclonal antibodies against the\nendogenous protein [18]. Based on spectral counting provided by\nthe MS analysis, the HSV-1 immediate-early transactivating protein ICP0 was determined to\nbe the most abundant viral interaction with IFI16. Further functional analyses [18] provided additional support for the current model that during\nearly stages of HSV-1 infection, ICP0 employs a virus immune evasion strategy mediated by\nprotein associations to target IFI16 for proteasome-dependent degradation. This early\nassociation inhibits the induction of IFI16-mediated intrinsic and innate immune\nresponses, thereby allowing viral replication to progress [19,47]. Highlighting the importance of this host\nprotein in defense, additional AP-MS studies have demonstrated that another herpesvirus\nhas also acquired a mechanism to inhibit IFI16 [48,49]. Specifically, the major viral tegument protein during HCMV\ninfection was shown to bind to IFI16 in the nucleus, thereby blocking its ability to\noligomerize and initiate antiviral cytokine response.\n\nIsolations of host proteins using AP-MS have also been used in conjunction with SILAC\nquantification to gain knowledge into mechanisms of viral entry. For example, Gerold\net al. investigated the interactions of the cellular surface protein\nCD81, a known receptor for HCV entry, to understand the downstream pathways modulated by\nCD81 upon virus binding [32]. SILAC and AP-MS was used to\ncompare CD81 interactions in uninfected and HCV-infected hepatoma cells (Huh-7). Serum\nresponse factor binding protein 1 was identified as a CD81 interaction, and shown to have\na critical role in the cell penetration by HCV. This protein was further demonstrated to\nbe a specific virus entry factor for HCV, functioning for all seven HCV genotypes.\n\nTogether with the continuous expansion of antibody resources, such as the human protein\natlas [50], these studies emphasize the promise of AP-MS\napproaches for defining critical host factors during the progression of viral\ninfections.\n\nAn ambitious investigation sought to comprehensively characterize HIV\u2013host protein\ncomplexes [54]. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and immune T\nlymphocyte (Jurkat) cells, Jager et al. individually expressed all viral\nproteins encoding genes with a streptavidin or FLAG affinity purification tag. Using\nAP-MS, nearly 500 specific HIV\u2013host protein interactions were identified, approximately\n40% of which were prevalent in both cell types. Although HEK293 cells are not\nphysiologically relevant for HIV-1 infection, prior studies on protein complexes outside\nthe context of infection have shown that information about protein complexes can be gained\nwhen using simpler cell model systems. In these cases, the follow-up investigation of\nthese interactions in a relevant cell type is critical for supporting the findings.\nTherefore, the comparison of HEK293 cells with Jurkat cells, which are immortalized\nCD4+ T cells commonly used in HIV-1 studies, helped to substantiate the\npotential biological relevance of the subset of protein associations identified in both\nhuman cell types. Given that protein abundances can vary significantly between different\ntypes of cells, it is maybe not surprising that the observed overlap in interactions\nbetween HEK293 and Jurkat cells was limited. This observation highlights that protein\ninteractions can be cell type specific, as well as the importance of performing such\nstudies in relevant biological systems. Notably, from this study, several new associations\nemphasized the interplay between virus mechanisms to stimulate replication, and cellular\nhost defenses to thwart such strategies. A host subunit of eukaryotic translation\ninitiation factor 3, eIF3d, was found to be targeted for cleavage by an HIV protease. When\neIF3d was knocked down via RNA interference, an additional 10 host factors were found to\nhinder HIV replication by means of virus\u2013host protein interactions.\n\nLarger scale proteomic studies using overexpression of individual viral gene products\nhave not only been performed to characterize the interactions of different viral proteins,\nbut also to compare the interactions and functions of the same viral protein from\ndifferent disease-relevant viral subtypes. Using a similar AP-MS approach, the E6 and E7\noncoproteins of up to 17 different human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes were hemagglutinin\n(HA)-tagged and separately introduced by retroviral transduction in immortalized human\nkeratinocyte cells (N/Tert-1) to identify associated host proteins [64,65]. Anti-HA antibodies coupled to agarose beads\nwere used to isolate the E6 or E7 protein complexes. By assessing various HPV subtypes,\nclinically classified by severity of oncogenesis and disease, these studies were able to\nidentify both strain-specific associations, as well as interactions conserved across HPV\nstrains. This information may be further leveraged to differentiate proteomic\ncharacteristics of disease-causing subtypes from largely innocuous subtypes. As an\nexample, the E6 protein of genus alpha HPV binds specifically to the cellular E6AP\nprotein, while that of the genus beta HPV binds specifically to cellular MAML1. Both\nvirus\u2013host interactions are mediated by a similar motif in the cellular protein, and may\nbe responsible for the different cell type-specific tropisms of the two genera [64,66\u201369].\n\nDespite the versatility of using a single tag for exploring interactions during\ninfection, studies using tagged proteins in AP-MS workflows are susceptible to the\nco-isolation of non-specific associations. Additionally, AP-MS analyses frequently lead to\nthe identification of hundreds of proteins that can represent strong and weak, and direct\nand indirect associations. Sparked by the necessity to reduce the presence of non-specific\ninteractions and to focus on the strong associations, tandem affinity purification (TAP)\ntagging was developed as a method that could be integrated into AP-MS workflows. The basic\nprinciple of tandem isolation involves the tagging of a protein of interest with two\ndifferent tags, which allow the subsequent purification of the protein in two sequential\naffinity steps. Although this approach tends not to be useful for studying transient\ninteractions, which can be lost during the two-step isolation, this method can help in\nobtaining cleaner purifications in comparison to one-step isolations and for identifying\nstrong protein\u2013protein interactions. In its initial form, TAP tagging utilized a\nbi-partite fusion tag separated by a protease cleavable spacer. TAP tagging was first used\nto identify multiprotein yeast complexes in 1999 [70], and has\nsince been employed in numerous biological systems, including virus\u2013host interaction\nstudies. For example, upon transfection of human epithelial cells (HeLa) with the\nTAP-tagged viral protein EBNA1 from the herpesvirus Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), Holowaty\net al. identified a stable interaction with the cellular\ndeubiquitinating protease USP7/HAUSP [71]. Based on prior\nanalyses, it had been hypothesized that EBNA1 contained no enzymatic activity and mediated\nits essential role in maintaining the EBV genome in proliferating cells through\ninteractions with cellular proteins [71\u201373]. The discovered EBNA1-USP7 interaction was confirmed by\nco-immunoprecipitation in insect cells, which additionally demonstrated that the\nEBNA1-USP7 interaction does not require other human proteins. Subsequent functional assays\nfurther suggested that the virus may sequester USP7 indirectly to inhibit host-induced\napoptosis and promote cell cycle growth. Based on previous knowledge that the HSV-1\nimmediate-early protein ICP0 significantly accelerates viral gene expression and also\ninteracts with cellular USP7 during infection [74\u201376], this TAP tagging technique facilitated the demonstration of a\npotentially conserved herpesviral strategy to target USP7.\n\nThe TAP technology has also been successfully applied to studies of RNA viruses, many of\nwhich constitute major threats to human health. To provide insights into the biology of\ninfluenza A, TAP-tagged influenza A virus polymerase subunit and streptavidin-tagged viral\nnucleoprotein were used by Mayer et al. to study interacting proteins\n[77]. HEK293 cells were transfected with tagged proteins,\ncell lysates were harvested 24 h later, and TAP purification was conducted followed by MS\nanalysis. Four proteins were discovered using the TAP-tagged bait, including\npolymerase-associated cellular factors, while 41 proteins were identified using the\nnucleoprotein bait. As an illustration of viral usurpation of cellular secretory pathways,\nYamayoshi et al. overexpressed the Ebola virus major matrix protein VP40\ntagged with both FLAG and HA at the N-terminus in HEK293 cells [78]. The authors established that VP40 interacts with a host component of the\nCOPII vesicular transport system. Through sequential affinity tag purification and\nsubsequent MS, cellular Sec24C was distinguished as a binding partner of VP40. This\ninteraction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of VP40 and localization studies upon\ninfection with Ebola virus for three days. These findings corroborated previous\nobservations that VP40 is sufficient to generate Ebola virus-like particles that form by\nbudding off from host plasma membranes [79,80].\n\nIn addition to using two tags on a single protein from its two-step isolation, sequential\n(tandem) affinity purifications can also be used to isolate two associated proteins of\ninterest that are tagged with two different tags. As a protein can be part of multiple\nprotein complexes, this strategy is beneficial for honing in on one given protein complex\nthat specifically contains two proteins of interest. With this in mind, Hrecka et\nal. used a dual-tag approach to investigate how an accessory factor of HIV-2,\nVpx, enabled HIV-1 to transduce immune cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, which are\notherwise non-permissive to HIV-1 [81]. It was previously\nreported that in myeloid cells transduced with HIV-2, Vpx prevents the inhibition of HIV-1\ninfection by associating with and hijacking a cellular E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase\ncomplex, including the proteins cullin 4 and DCAF1 [82,83]. To examine the precise virus\u2013host associations, the authors\npurified this complex in the presence of Vpx by sequential affinity isolations in cells\ntransfected with FLAG-tagged cullin 4 and HA-tagged DCAF1. Upon MS analysis, the cellular\ninnate immune protein SAMHD1 was the most spectrally abundant association with the Vpx-E3\nubiquitin ligase complex. It was then determined that Vpx may facilitate the association\nof SAMHD1 with this complex to promote its proteasome-dependent degradation. As SAMHD1\nhinders efficient viral cDNA synthesis during HIV infection, this study illustrates a\nviral usurpation mechanism by which HIV-2 evolved to establish infection in myeloid cells\nby inhibiting the host innate immune response.\n\nTagging was also proven useful and amenable for studying viral protein interactions in\nin vitro analyses. Kaul et al. used GST-tagged domains\nof a viral protein, latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), of Kaposi\u2019s\nsarcoma-associated herpesvirus to pull down domain-specific cellular binding partners in\nthe nuclear extract of immune cells latently infected with the virus [84]. As LANA is known to play an essential role in the modulation of latency in\nthe immune cells, the identification of multiple proteins involved in the control of the\ncell cycle, DNA polymerase, and RNA polymerase support a model in which specific LANA\nassociations may be critical for the development of oncogenesis.\n\nAs detailed above, the use of tagging approaches, either for studying individually\noverexpressed proteins or within replication-competent viral strains, can be powerful for\ndeciphering the interplay between viruses and hosts. However, several technical challenges\nhave to be taken into consideration when designing these experiments (as reviewed in\n[23,85]). The location and size of\nthe tag can impact protein function, and it is critical to determine that the use of a tag\ndoes not affect virus titers or the subcellular localization of the protein of interest.\nWhile some viral proteins can be tagged at their C- or N-termini (e.g. [86]), others may require the inclusion of the tag within an\ninternal loop (e.g. [24]). The available location for tagging\nis influenced by the protein conformation and by the necessity of certain domains for\nprotein interactions. Therefore, even the inability to tag a protein at a given location\ncan be informative and highlight a functionally important region. Similarly, while some\nviral proteins allow the inclusion of a relatively large tag (e.g. GFP, protein A), others\nrequire the use of a smaller tag (e.g. FLAG, V5). A larger tag tends to offer higher\nefficiency of isolation, as the use of polyclonal antibodies or multiple monoclonal\nantibodies is possible. It is conceivable that in some cases a larger tag can fold outside\nof a protein, while a small tag may be integrated in the protein folding, altering its\nfunction. However, the use of a smaller tag tends to be preferred, as a large tag may\nimpact protein size, affecting its localization and interactions.\n\nThe use of AP-MS approaches can reveal the formation of virus\u2013host macromolecular complexes\nduring infection, and inform on downstream pathways regulated by certain functional protein\ncomplexes. However, these methods tend not to inform whether a protein interaction is direct\nor indirect. Several methods have been developed to assess direct pairwise protein\ninteractions (Figure 2B, middle panel). As early as 1996, Bartel\net al. applied a genome-wide Y2H screen on proteins from\nEscherichia coli and bacteriophage T7 to reveal 25 interactions [87]. Of these interactions, six were in complexes involved in DNA\nreplication and packaging of phage particles. In 2007, an unbiased and systematic Y2H screen\nwas implemented for the first time to investigate virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions\n[88]. The study generated a protein interaction network\nconsisting of 173 unique associations between herpesvirus EBV proteins and human proteins.\nOut of the 89 known EBV proteins, all or part of 85 were screened against a human spleen\ncDNA library in haploid yeast cells. The global strategy adopted by this study and others\nprovided a resource for further hypothesis-driven investigations into the functions of both\ncharacterized and poorly understood proteins during viral infection. Similarly, using a\ngenome-wide Y2H screen, de Chassey et al. discovered host components that\ncritically interacted with viral replication proteins of the single-stranded RNA virus,\nhepatitis C virus (HCV) [89]. It was determined that the viral\nnonstructural proteins NS3 and NS5A, with known roles in HCV RNA replication, had an\nabundance of associations with cellular proteins. Interestingly, NS3 and NS5A were found to\nderegulate cellular focal adhesion, which could instigate tumorigenesis and cell detachment\nfrom extracellular matrix components [89]. These findings suggest\nthat NS3 and NS5A have multifunctional roles that hijack host cellular pathways through\nvirus\u2013host protein binding. Further highlighting the versatility in Y2H applicability to\ndifferent viruses, Khadka et al. performed a systematic Y2H screen to\nidentify over 130 novel interactions between Dengue virus and human proteins using a human\nliver cDNA library [90]. By conducting co-localization,\nsplit-luciferase, and siRNA assays, the authors were able to confirm a subset of these\ninteractions.\n\nTo gain information about both protein complexes and direct interactions in human cells,\nseveral studies have integrated Y2H screens with orthogonal AP-MS approaches. Nearly 3800\nvirus\u2013host protein interactions were identified by Rozenblatt-Rosen et al.\nin a single study of DNA tumor virus proteins from four viruses, HPV, EBV, adenovirus Ad5,\nand human polyomavirus [91]. Human diploid fibroblast cells,\nIMR-90, were transduced with retrovirus containing ORFs from the DNA tumor viruses. Control\ncell lines consisted of cells transduced with GFP or the SV40 large T antigen. The\nidentified associations stemmed from 54 viral and 1079 host proteins that pointed to viral\nsubtype-specificity in interactions. For example, the cellular transcriptional regulators\ncAMP-response element binding protein and EP300 were only found to associate with the E6\noncoprotein of HPV from cutaneous subtypes and not mucosal subtypes. These differences\nhighlight how various virus infections markedly alter the cellular proteome through specific\nprotein interactions that may be responsible for their pathogenesis. Similarly, TAP AP-MS\nand Y2H were used to survey interaction between viral immune modulator proteins and the\nhuman proteome [92]. Seventy viral open reading frames\nrepresenting previously identified viral immune-evasive modulators from 30 viral species\nwere selected for TAP tagging [92\u201394].\nFrom this study, researchers identified over 1600 virus\u2013host protein associations that\nhighlighted both species-specific and conserved viral immune-evasive strategies [92]. It was determined that 579 unique host proteins were targeted by\nat least one of the assessed viral open reading frames. Both of these approaches, Y2H and\nAP-MS, have certain limitations. For example, Y2H is known to generate false positives as\nproteins that may not be present in the same subcellular compartment can be artificially\nmade to associate. Similarly, the isolation of protein complexes by AP-MS is known to be\naffected by the generation of non-specific associations during cell lysis, as detailed\nabove. The integration of AP-MS with Y2H can help to filter some of the false positives and\nnonspecific associations generated by these approaches, and highlight the most prominent\ninteractions for further functional analyses.\n\nA powerful alternative approach to studying direct protein\u2013protein interactions is chemical\ncross-linking, which may be used to stabilize interactions in cells. Beginning as early as\nthe 1960s, protein cross-linking has been instrumental in uncovering numerous\nprotein\u2013protein interactions [95,96].\nThis approach has been effective in capturing transient or weak intermolecular protein\ncomplexes, and gaining knowledge of intramolecular surface topologies, structural\nconformations, as well as of the interacting amino acid residues [97]. The cross-linker is a chemical reagent that contains at least two reactive\ngroups flanking a linker region. Depending on the selected reactive groups, these groups\nwill associate with particular amino acid side chains that lie spatially close to each\nother. Today, numerous chemical cross-linkers are commercially available, consisting of\nvariable linker lengths and chemical specificities to meet unique experimental needs. As an\nexample, formaldehyde crosslinking has become an integral element in numerous fundamental\nbiochemical, molecular, and cellular biological techniques, such as chromatin\nimmunoprecipitation of protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes and the fixing of cells and tissues\nfor immunocytochemical assessments of protein localization by microscopy [98]. For example, crosslinking was used to show that a host defense\nprotein oligomerizes in response to viral infection [49].\nCoupling of chemical cross-linking with MS can be used to explore protein interaction\ntopologies between the virus and the host. Upon adding cross-linking reagents, cells may\nthen be lysed for subsequent targeted AP-MS analysis, or directly digested for large-scale\ninteraction studies to identify cross-linked peptides (Figure 3,\nright panel). This method covalently links one protein to another in virus-infected cells,\nthereby preserving weak or dynamic noncovalent protein interactions. The cross-linked amino\nacid residues at the interaction interphase are subsequently identified by MS. In a prime\nexample, Chavez et al. utilized a remarkable cross-linking strategy,\nProtein Interaction Reporter technology, to generate cross-links that are cleaved within a\nmass spectrometer for the identification of interacting protein and peptide sequences [99,100]. By these means, the authors\ncross-linked proteins in a purified potato leafroll virus sample and revealed topological\ninteraction data in the virus that are required for virus\u2013plant associations and its\ntransmission across aphid vectors [100]. Advantageously, this\ntechnique addresses the challenges of incomplete cross-linking and overly noisy and complex\nspectral data that have hindered the broad application of traditional cross-linking reagents\ncoupled to MS in virology [101\u2013103]\n(Figure 3, right panel).\n\nThe value of proteomic approaches for studying virus\u2013virus and virus\u2013host protein\ninteractions extends beyond the use of MS-based techniques. This was recently demonstrated\nby the NAPPA technology [104] (Figure\n2B, right panel). Prior to the development of NAPPA, protein microarrays were not\nwidely adopted as a result of difficulties in generating purified proteins to spot onto the\narrays by linkage chemistry [105\u2013108].\nTo circumvent this challenge, the LaBaer lab has developed protein microarrays containing\nprinted complementary DNA expression vectors, the proteins of which are expressed de\nnovo on the chip [109,110].\nThe DNA encodes both the protein of interest and an epitope tag, such as glutathione\nS-transferase (GST). Following an in vitro transcription\u2013translation step\nthat uses a cell lysate, the generated human or viral protein is immobilized to the array\nwith an adjacently located anti-tag (e.g. anti-GST) antibody (Figure\n2B, right panel). To assess virus\u2013host protein interactions, a second host protein\nis tagged with an alternative epitope that is used to probe the array.\n\nAvailable as a cloning resource, the LaBaer lab has since released a panviral proteome set\nof 2035 open reading frame clones generated from 830 viral genes from both DNA and RNA\nviruses, including HCMV, HSV-1, KSHV, vaccinia virus, SINV, chikungunya virus, and yellow\nfever virus [104,111]. These arrays\nare applicable to studying protein interactions from either the virus or host perspective,\nas demonstrated by case studies on rubella virus and varicella-zoster virus [112]. For example, NAPPA arrays containing 10,000 purified human cDNA\nplasmids were incubated with rubella virus-infected cell lysates, leading to the\nidentification and then confirmation of interactions between the viral capsid protein and\nhost proteins [104]. Additionally, the technology has been\nadvantageously employed to profile antiviral antibodies produced by infected cells on a\nhigh-density NAPPA array of viral antigens [111]. Detection of\nspecific antibodies may foster the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with\nvirus-associated chronic illnesses. Aspects to keep in mind when using this powerful\ntechnology are that the identification of an association does not inform if this interaction\nis direct or indirect, and that interactions dependent on posttranslational modifications\nmay not always be captured. However, NAPPA provides a platform for the high-throughput\nanalysis of the interactions of a particular protein of interest (viral or cellular in\norigin) conceivably against thousands of target proteins.\n\nThe identification of protein\u2013protein interactions using either AP-MS, Y2H, cross-linking\nor protein array studies can provide critical biological insight into protein function.\nHowever, the next essential step is to validate the newly identified protein interactions.\nGiven that these methods tend to lead to the identification of numerous putative\ninteractions, a first validation step is usually performed using controls and computational\napproaches. For example, control AP-MS isolations are performed in parallel to the isolation\nof the viral or host protein of interest. The comparison of the proteins identified in the\nbait and control isolations can be performed using label-free approaches, such as comparing\nspectral counts or precursor ion intensities obtained from LC\u2013MS analyses [28]. Alternatively, a more precise comparison of the bait and control\nIPs can be provided by relative quantification using metabolic labeling with stable isotopes\n[31,32], as shown by the isotopic\ndifferentiation of interactions as random or targeted method [29,113]. These comparative analyses can help remove\nlikely non-specific associations and uncover the protein interactions that are specifically\nenriched with the bait viral or host protein of interest. In an attempt to predict the\nassociations that are likely to be non-specific, several research groups have put together a\nresource of AP-MS controls, termed the contaminant repository for affinity purification\n[27]. This resource provides useful information about recurring\nsticky proteins in different cell types or when using certain tags or resins for the\nisolations. Therefore, this resource can be used in conjunction with any protein\ninteractions studies, in particular AP-MS analyses, but also for Y2H, cross-linking, and\nprotein array studies, to predict the likely specificity of the observed associations.\nHowever, as this resource is still growing and the available number of controls for infected\ncells is limited, caution has to be taken when using this repository for predicting\nnonspecific associations during viral infection. This is critical, as infections can trigger\nsubstantial changes in the proteome of a cell, thereby impacting the formation of\nnonspecific associations.\n\nOnce the subset of predicted specific interactions have been identified, it is imperative\nto confirm the associations of interest by orthogonal experimental methods. A conventional\nmethod is provided by reciprocal isolation, in which the newly identified interacting\nprotein is used as the bait. These isolations can be performed by either using antibodies\nagainst the endogenous proteins or by tagging the interacting proteins of interest and using\nantibodies against the tag. The presence of the initial protein of interest in this\nreciprocal isolation would substantiate the identified interaction. While straightforward in\nconcept, reciprocal IPs can be challenging. For example, the success of the validation\nrelies on the affinity of the antibodies used for reciprocal isolations. Another challenge\noccurs if the initial bait interacts with a protein that is either abundant or a part of\nmultiple different complexes. This suggests that in a reciprocal isolation experiment, only\na small subset of this protein would interact with the original bait, which can interfere\nwith the validation. An alternative approach for validating an interaction is the assessment\nof the co-localization of the proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. This approach\ninforms whether the proteins have the opportunity to interact by co-existing in the same\nsubcellular compartment, which is important for all interaction studies, but in particular\nfor validating Y2H and protein array results. Immunofluorescence microscopy can assess the\nco-localization of proteins within several hundred nanometers. Noteworthy, the reciprocal\nIPs and the co-localization by immunofluorescence lack the ability to distinguish between\nindirect and direct interactions. Several optical techniques may serve as complementary or\nalternative approaches, such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which assesses\nthe diffusion rate of fluorescently-tagged proteins as indications of weak or strong\nassociations with cellular structures [114]. Additionally,\nF\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and proximity ligation assay (PLA) can provide\ninsight into direct interactions in situ.\n\nFRET may be employed to identify direct virus\u2013host protein interactions in live cells\nthrough the detection of two fluorophores with intra- and inter-molecular distances as far\nas 10 nm apart [115,116]. This\ntechnique relies on fusing each protein of interest to fluorescent tags that have\noverlapping fluorescence spectra. Upon ectopic expression in cells and viral infection,\ncells may be excited by a microscopy laser. If the fluorophores of the tagged proteins are\nwithin 10 nm, the excitation will induce the lower wavelength fluorophore (donor) to\nphysically transfer nonradiative energy to the close-by neighboring fluorophore (acceptor).\nFRET has been implemented to demonstrate that an antiviral host protein interacted with a\nviral nonstructural protein during HCV infection, potentially to limit viral replication at\nthe replication complex [117]. The spatial resolution of FRET\nmakes it an attractive technique to assess virus\u2013host protein interactions, yet in practice,\nit requires careful optimization for reliable results. For instance, FRET signals may be\nattenuated despite the close proximity of two interacting proteins, if the fluorescent tags\nare on opposing sides of the proteins. As such, the tag location relative to the structure\nof the protein complex must be taken into account if FRET signals are weak or non-existent.\nFluorescent tags with different levels of brightness, as well as protein complex\nstoichiometry outside of a 10:1 range can complicate interpretations of the fluorescent\nsignals during FRET analysis [115].\n\nThe more recently established PLA can be used during viral infection to assess direct\ninteractions of proteins within a range of 40 nm [118]. PLA\nrequires the availability of an antibody specific to each protein, and that the antibodies\narise from different species. PLA relies on the principle of proximity-dependent DNA\nligation, which ultimately gives rise to signals from fluorescent nucleotides, seen as small\npuncta. Permeabilized cells are incubated with the respective two primary antibodies.\nSecondary antibodies against two distinct species are added, which have been previously\nconjugated to relatively short DNA oligonucleotides. If the two proteins are within 40 nm of\neach other, the subsequent addition of DNA aptamers that connect the two oligonucleotide\nstrands together is added with DNA polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides to\npromote ligation by rolling circle amplification. The concatameric product gives rise to\nfluorescent puncta. PLA has been performed to detect both protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013DNA\ninteractions in virus-infected cells [119,120]. Some technical considerations for PLA include the requirement of highly\nspecific antibodies and the incorporation of multiple controls to assess background\nfluorescence from the nonspecific binding of the antibodies used.\n\nOnce the protein interactions of interest are validated by any of these orthogonal methods,\nthe value of the identified protein\u2013protein interaction comes from understanding the\nbiological function of the interaction during viral infection. A series of functional assays\n(molecular, cellular, and biochemical) can be performed to test the role of an interaction.\nA commonly employed approach is to assess the impact of the levels of the interacting\nprotein on viral replication and spread. This can be accomplished by either decreasing (via\nsiRNA, shRNA, or CRISPR) or increasing (via transfection or stable lentivirus transduction)\nprotein levels, which can inform on whether a protein is required for viral replication or\nused in host defense against infection. Other functional assays can be specifically\ndesigned, depending on the prior knowledge regarding the biological functions of the\nidentified associated proteins.\n\nThe significant contribution of proteomic-based approaches to discoveries in virology is\nstarting now to be well recognized [85]. With regard to\nunderstanding dynamic virus\u2013host interactions during infection, MS, affinity purifications,\ncross-linking, and protein arrays are experimental platforms that are synergistically\nevolving and capable of high-resolution evaluations of protein interactions. To date, these\nadvances in proteomic-based approaches have paved the way for the identification of an\nimpressive number of virus\u2013host protein associations that otherwise may not have been\nuncovered using more traditional approaches. In fact, these studies have provided the\nfoundation for publically accessible databases, which currently contain over 5000 curated\nand non-redundant protein interactions between components of the virus and of the permissive\nhost cell [121\u2013127]. These valuable\nrepositories include the Database of Interacting Proteins [127],\nVirHostNet [124,125], VirusMentha\n[123], IntAct-MINT, and Uniprot [122].\n\nDespite these numerous elegant studies, this may still be considered a beginning stage of\nthe path to fully understanding virus\u2013host interactions during the progression of a viral\ninfection. The knowledge of interactions, and therefore biological functions, still remains\nlimited for numerous viral proteins for diverse types of viral infections, many of which are\nthreats to human health. This limited knowledge is connected to a series of experimental\nchallenges, including the generation of appropriate virus strains, performing studies in\nrelevant cell-model systems, and identifying interactions in the context of infection rather\nthan following overexpression of individual viral proteins. To address some of these\nchallenges, one avenue that scientists have probed has been the use of alternative model\norganisms as surrogate hosts. Noteworthy are several studies using yeast to investigate\nplant RNA viruses, such as tomato bushy stunt virus, Brome mosaic virus, and cucumber\nnecrosis virus [128\u2013131].\n\nRecent years were also marked by substantial advances in quantitative MS-based proteomics.\nSome of these methods, such as label-free quantification, metabolic labeling, and targeted\nMS analyses, have already been successfully applied to virus\u2013host protein interaction\nstudies. For example, the targeted MS quantification method based on selected reaction\nmonitoring [132\u2013134] was recently\nimplemented to understanding the transmission of a plant virus. Specifically, Cilia\net al. assessed how aphid transmission may indirectly modulate the\nvirus\u2013host interactions between the cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV) and plants [135]. Upon feeding of aphids with virus-infected plants, several\nplant proteins were found enriched specifically during infection, suggesting that CYDV\ninfection induces changes in the plant proteome that enhance virion uptake by aphids.\nDespite the successful integration of quantitative proteomics with virology, several\nvaluable quantitative MS methods are yet to be applied to studying protein interactions\nduring infection. For example, peptide labeling with isobaric tags (e.g. isobaric tags for\nrelative and absolute quantitation or TMT) provides multiplexing that can be directly\napplied to studying different time points of infection.\n\nMost importantly, proteomics is well suited to complement orthogonal approaches, including\nbiochemical, optical, and molecular virology methods, in the pursuit of further elucidating\nvirus\u2013host dynamics. An emerging technique is activity-based protein profiling, a\nchemo-proteomic approach that employs active site-directed probes to profile the\nfunctionality of enzymatically active proteins in whole proteomes [136,137]. Additionally, live cell imaging microscopy,\ntomography, and optogenetics can be further integrated with proteomics to generate\nbiological insights unattainable by individual techniques. In sum, we expect\nmulti-disciplinary studies to have a crucial impact on future discoveries in virology, with\nproteomics playing an instrumental role."}
