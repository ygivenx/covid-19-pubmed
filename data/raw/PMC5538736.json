{"title": "Open and Closed Structures Reveal Allostery and Pliability in the HIV-1 Envelope Spike", "body": "BG505 SOSIP.664 and B41 SOSIP.664 trimers were expressed by transient transfection (co-transfected with furin) in HEK293F (Invitrogen; mycoplasma-free) and purified as previously described using 2G12-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography28,29.\n\nThe two N-terminal domains of human CD4 were cloned into vector pHCMV3 with an N-terminal Ig-kappa secretion signal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for expression in HEK293F. One liter of 293 Freestyle cells was transiently transfected with 0.5 mg of DNA. After 7 days, the supernatant containing the secreted protein was applied to a 5ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) at 1 ml/min. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0\u2013100% of 1.5 M glycine in 0.02 M Tris-acetate pH 8.0, and 0.5 M NaCl. Peaks containing CD4 (as verified by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on an S75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 0.05 M Tris-acetate pH 8.0 and 0.3 M NaCl.\n\nPGV04, 17b or b12 Fab was expressed in HEK293F and purified by 5 mL KappaSelect or LambdaSelect affinity (GE Healthcare), MonoS 5/50 GL (GE Healthcare), and Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare).\n\nBG505 SOSIP.664 were mixed with a 10X molar excess (sCD4:trimer) of sCD4 for 2 hr at room temperature. For complexes containing 17b, a subsequent incubation was performed with a 10X molar excess (Fab:trimer) of 17b Fab for 1 hr at room temperature. The complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in TBS (0.05 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl). The fractions containing the complex were pooled and concentrated using a 100-kDa concentrator (Amicon Ultra, Millipore) to ~40 \u03bcL at 1 mg/mL. 5 \u03bcL of the complex was incubated with 3 \u03bcL of a fresh DDM solution at 1.8 mM. A 3 \u03bcL aliquot of the complex was applied to a C-Flat grid (CF-2/2-4C, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Protochips, Inc.) which had been plasma cleaned for 5 seconds using a mixture of Ar/O2 (Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma system), blotted off, and then immediately plunged into liquid ethane using a manual freeze plunger.\n\nThe same procedure was used to prepare the B41 complexes except that the incubation time of trimer and ligand(s) was increased to ~18 hrs prior to SEC. This long incubation time increased stoichiometry of binding for ligands with slow on-rates and did not have an effect on overall trimer stability judged by the lack of dimers or monomers in both SEC peaks and EM classifications.\n\nFrozen-hydrated samples were inserted into a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon) operating at 300 kV. Data was collected through the Leginon software solution30\u201332. Each micrograph movie was collected at a magnification of 22,500, which resulted in a pixel size of 1.31 \u00c5 in the specimen plane. Micrograph movies were acquired using a K2 direct detector camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, California) operated in counting mode with 200 ms exposure per frame. Dose rate was ~10 e-/pix/sec and defocus range was \u22121.0 to \u22124.0 \u03bcm. Micrograph movie frames were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor233. CTF models were calculated using GCTF34.\n\nMolecular projection image candidates were then identified in the aligned micrograph movies using DoG Picker35. Reference-free, 2D classification was performed using identified projection image candidates binned by a factor of two via iterative multivariate statistical analysis and multi-reference alignment36,37. Particles corresponding to class averages of the molecular complexes were selected for further processing in Relion version 2.038. Initially, full-size molecular projection images were refined against a simulated density map of an unliganded BG505 SOSIP Env trimer (simulated from the Env part of PDB ID 5CEZ) low-pass filtered at 60 \u00c5. Initial refinement was followed by 3D classification and stable symmetrical classes were selected for further symmetrized (C3) refinement. Resolutions were calculated using soft-edged masks that encompassed the entire structure (including all noisier regions) and are reported according to the FSC 0.143 gold-standard criterion. Final resolutions are ~3.6 \u00c5 (B41b12), ~3.7 \u00c5 (B41CD4/17b), ~5.2 \u00c5 (B41CD4), ~5.6 \u00c5 (B41LF) and ~7.4 \u00c5 (B41PGV04).\n\nSingle particles were selected using DoGPicker35 from the whole-frame aligned and summed micrographs and used to create an initial raw particle stack after removing regions of the micrographs containing gold or large areas of aggregation. The raw particle stack was extracted using a box size of 256 pixels, and was immediately binned by 2 in reciprocal space, to a pixel size of 2.62 \u00c5/pix and a box size 128 pixels. Initial 2D classification in Relion indicated a mixture of particle populations from sub-stoichiometric binding of sCD4 and 17b. Particles contributing to classes that did not produce clear structural features were discarded, leaving 98,845 particles. Next, to separate the different particle populations, this stack was subjected to competitive sorting using 3 initial models \u2013 trimer alone, trimer + sCD4, trimer + sCD4 + 17b Fab \u2013 in an identical manner as previously described39. This resulted in three separate stacks containing 69,105 particles (trimer alone), 6,342 particles (trimer + sCD4), and 23,398 particles (trimer + sCD4 + 17b). Each of these individual stacks was then subjected to 4-model classification in Relion, using 60 \u00c5 as the initial low-pass filter value38, followed by parameter conversion and final classification in Frealign40. For each subgroup, the number of classes in Frealign was varied from 2 to 4, and a final value was selected such that the classification would produce at least 2 nearly identical models, as described earlier41,42. Within the stack comprising the trimer alone or the trimer + sCD4, this procedure resulted in removal of bad particles that did not produce interpretable maps (Figure S5C); within the stack comprising the trimer + sCD4 + 17b, this resulted in 1 low resolution class that was discarded, as well as 3 classes that differed in the relative configuration of the 17b Fab, but that were otherwise very similar. Final resolutions (FSC 0.143) are ~10.5 \u00c5 (BG505CD4), and ~8.6 \u00c5 (BG505CD4/17b).\n\nModel building and refinement steps followed those previously described43. Briefly, initial homology models of B41 gp120 and gp41 were generated using Modeller44 and the crystal structure of ligand-free BG505 SOSIP.664 (PDB: 4ZMJ) as a template for B41LF and B41b12, while the crystal structure of gp120 bound to sCD4 and 17b (PDB: 1GC1) was used to model gp120 of B41CD4/17b. Coordinates for sCD4, 17b, b12, and PGV04 were obtained from PDB IDs 1GC1, 1RZ8, 2NY7, and 3J5M, respectively. Individual chains were fit into the respective cryoEM maps using UCSF Chimera45 and refined using a combination of Rosetta density-guided iterative local refinement46, RosettaRelax47, and manual building in COOT48. Glycans were built using an idealized Man9 model that was placed into corresponding glycan density in UCSF Chimera. Torsion angles were adjusted in UCSF Chimera until good agreement was achieved between map and model. Sugar molecules with disordered or no density were removed. The final models were further refined using Phenix49 real space refinement without NCS constraints. Glycans were validated by pdb-care50 and CARP51 and structures were evaluated using EMRinger52 and Molprobity53. Figures were generated in UCSF Chimera or Pymol54. Buried surface area calculations were performed using PDBePISA55 and R.M.S.D. analysis was performed in UCSF Chimera. Map fitting cross correlations were calculated using the Fit In Map feature in UCSF Chimera.\n\nA stock of B41 SOSIP.664 was thawed on ice and 3 \u03bcL were adsorbed onto a Cu400 carbon-coated grid for 10 s before blotting, and then stained for 60 s with 2% (w/v) uranyl formate. The remaining stock was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr on a heat block. 3 \u03bcL were removed and immediately adsorbed onto a carbon-coated grid followed by staining. The stock was again incubated on ice for 1 hr before a third grid was prepared using the same method. Data were collected and processed as described in Pugach et al., and de Taeye et al."}
