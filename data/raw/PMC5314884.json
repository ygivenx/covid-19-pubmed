{"title": "Examining the relationship between infectious diseases and flooding in Europe", "body": "Flooding has been of significant concern since the beginning of human civilization and has led to extensive morbidity and mortality. Floods are the most common natural disaster worldwide and specifically in Europe; hence, a crucial area of research.1 Between 1997 and 2006, the number of global flood events doubled.2 European vulnerability to flooding has been highlighted by recent flooding events; most notably, the Central European floods in 2002 and in 2010, the 2010 flooding in Southern France, and the 2007 flooding in several areas in the United Kingdom.\n\nDefining what constitutes a flood can be quite complex as floods can take many forms; therefore, no universal definition exists. Generally and in the context of this review, a flood is defined as the overflow of areas that are not normally submerged with water or a stream that has broken its normal confines or has accumulated due to lack of drainage.3 Overall, different flood characteristics affect the severity of the flood event; specifically, regularity, speed of onset, velocity of flow, and depth of water. Quantifying the level of flooding has proven to be difficult; however, the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) provides information about flood events and the impact of floods. For a flood to be classified as a disaster or flood event by EM-DAT one of the criteria must be fulfilled: either ten or more people killed; 100 or more people affected; declaration of a state emergency; and/or call for international assistance. EM-DAT defines a flood as a significant rise in water level in a stream, lake, reservoir, or coastal region and includes general river floods, flash floods, and storm surges or coastal flooding.\n\nFlood disasters hit some European regions very frequently, and in some circumstances every year. In Europe from 2003\u20132012, 19 flash floods and 162 general floods were reported by EM-DAT. In terms of the number of people affected, 7 out of the 20 most important floods ever recorded in Europe occurred during the 2000\u20132010 decade.4 A study concluded a rising number in flood disasters from 1950\u20132005 in the European Union (EU).5 According to Frei et al.6 there has been a significant trend toward increased intense winter rainfall events in Europe. Other studies do not find a rising incidence of flooding. For example Mudelsee et al.7 examined river flood patterns in Central Europe, and despite the occurrence of two flood events exceeding the 100-y flood level in 1997 and 2002, found no increased trend in extreme flood frequency over recent decades. Analyzing the more frequent, small-magnitude flood events as well as high-magnitude floods can make it easier to detect shifting trends in flood frequency.6 Flood trend analysis is essential to understand future flood risk and vulnerability.\n\nBoth climatic and non-climatic impacts, such as land-use dynamics, are expected to influence future flooding in Europe. Although considerable limitations remain in the ability to make robust projections of changes in flood size and frequency due to climate change, common projections appear to be emerging. According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) SREX Report8 there is a 66\u2013100% probability that the intensity of heavy precipitation and the proportion of total rainfall will increase particularly in northern mid-latitudes and high latitudes of Europe. The highest total precipitation increases are projected to occur during the winter months. Although the IPCC states a general decrease in mean precipitation in the southern European region, rainfall may become more irregular and intense. However there remains low confidence in projections of changes in riverine floods. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of storm surges and coastal flooding due to rise in sea levels, and threaten an additional 1.6 million people per year in Europe by the 2080s.9 Overall, changes in the climate that may affect the transmission of infectious diseases include temperature, humidity, altered rainfall, and sea-level rise.\n\nFlooding can have a range of health impacts but this review focused solely on infectious diseases. The diseases most likely to be affected by flooding are those that require a vehicle for transfer from host to host (water-borne) or a host/vector as part of its life cycle (vector-borne).10 Flood-affected areas serve as ideal breeding grounds for pathogens and may alter vector breeding grounds and zoonotic reservoirs.11,12 Where infectious disease transmission is endemic, it can present a major public health concern following flooding.13\n\nThe risk of infectious diseases following flooding is exacerbated by the fact many factors work together to increase incidence.14 The significance of the association between precipitation and disease is potentially amplified when considering the effects of global climate change and land use changes. Flooding can alter the equilibrium of the environment and may affect the incidence and geographic range of climate-sensitive infectious diseases. A better understanding of the associations and underlying mechanisms of infectious disease outbreaks following flooding will help support evidence-based flood policies and mitigation strategies.\n\nThis systematic literature review aimed to identify and examine the relationship between infectious disease incidence and flooding in order to gain a better understanding of:\n\nPersonal communications between key informants were conducted in conjunction with the literature review. The context of the questions included the current state of knowledge of the association between flooding and infectious diseases and potential solutions to mitigate the risks.\n\nBecause flooding is a natural disaster and cannot be induced experimentally, the research evidence was unlikely to be the considered \u2018gold standard\u2019 of a systematic literature review or a randomized controlled trial. Most of the data was observational, and because of insufficient numbers of similar studies, and variation in outcome reporting no studies were excluded on the basis of study quality. A formal assessment of bias was not possible for each individual study.\n\nThe initial search generated 7,861 relevant articles. After reviewing the abstracts, 106 full-text articles were examined in more detail for eligibility. Of these 106 articles, 38 peer-reviewed articles were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Increased infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following global flood events have been documented (Table 2). The study design and main results of all papers found meeting the inclusion criteria are listed in detail in Appendices A-D. Some articles and gray literature not meeting the specific inclusion criteria were incorporated into the conceptual framework to give a better contextual outline.\n\nWater-borne outbreaks are an acute aftermath of flood disasters, mainly as a result of contaminated drinking water supply. Intense precipitation can mobilize pathogens in the environment and transport them into the aquatic environment, increasing the microbiological agents on surface water.17-20 Chen et al.21 found extreme torrential rain (> 350mm) was a significant risk factor for enteroviruses (RR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.474\u201323.760) and bacillary dysentery (RR = 7.703; 95% CI 5.008\u201311.849). Globally, water-borne epidemics have shown an increasing trend from 1980\u20132006 which coincides with the increasing number of flood events.2 According to a global systematic literature review performed by Cann et al.17 the most common water-borne pathogens to be identified following flooding were vibrio spp The most common water-borne pathogens associated with heavy rainfall were campylobacter, followed by vibrio spp\n\nAppendices A, B list published studies which have reported post-flood increases in cholera, cryptosporidiosis, non-specific diarrhea, rotavirus, and typhoid and paratyphoid.22-31 Several studies have implicated excess rainfall in water-borne disease outbreaks because of the transportation of bacteria, parasites, and viruses into water systems.22 Marcheggiani et al.18 showed a potential association between flood events and a range of water-borne infectious diseases in Italy; including, legionellosis, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and infectious diarrhea. Reacher et al.28 performed a historical cohort study following a severe flood in 2000 in Lewes, England. The risk of gastroenteritis was significantly associated with depth of flooding in people whose households were flooded (RR = 1.7; 95% CI 0.9\u20133.0; p for trend by flood depth = 0.04). Additionally, an outbreak of norovirus in American tourists was linked to direct exposure to floodwater contaminated with raw sewage in Germany.29\n\nEarlier research has shown an association between water-borne diseases and flooding in high-income countries. From 1948\u20131994, more than half of the water-borne disease outbreaks in the United States were preceded by heavy rainfall (p = 0.002).30 Research from Finland found that 13 water-borne disease outbreaks from 1998\u20131999 were associated with un-disinfected groundwater contaminated by floodwaters and surface runoff.32 Surveys in high-income countries where individuals reported their own symptoms have indicated an increase in water-borne diseases following flooding.28,30-32\n\nRodent-borne diseases are climate sensitive and may increase during heavy rainfall and flooding because of altered patterns of human- pathogen- rodent contact.15 Flooding and heavy rainfall have been associated with numerous outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide-range of countries around the world.15,21,33-48 Areas at the highest risk for leptospirosis outbreaks are those where multiple risk factors are likely to coexist; such as, increased flooding risk, rising temperatures, overcrowding, poor sanitation, poor health care, poverty, and an abundance of rats and other animal reservoirs.39 Rodent-borne pathogens can be indirectly affected by ecological determinants of food sources which have an effect on the size of rodent populations. For example, lack of garbage management and collection following flooding where rubbish is left on the streets contributes to an increased rodent population.38 Appendices A, C summarize the key studies assessing the relationship between flooding and rodent-borne diseases.\n\nOutbreaks of leptospirosis were observed in the Czech Republic following floods in 1997 and 2002.41,42 The rates of serologically confirmed cases of leptospirosis were three times higher than usual at 0.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants (average incidence rate is 0.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants). The first leptospirosis outbreak in Austria in July 2010, involved four athletes who swam in recreational waters during a triathlon.43 Heavy rains had preceded the triathlon (22mm). This outbreak demonstrates a risk of contracting leptospirosis in recreational waters, especially after heavy rainfall.\n\nIn Marseilles, France the incidence of leptospirosis identified in the laboratory increased significantly between January 2001 and July 2011 (p < 0.0001).38 Between 1991 and 2003, the rate of leptospirosis incidence in southern France was very low, 0.09 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In 2008, this incidence increased to 0.25 cases/100,000 inhabitants. The first three autochthonous cases identified in Marseilles (October 2009) were preceded by heavy rainfall. The study showed the first autochthonous case was identified after a period of flooding preceded by heavy rainfall over several days (34.6mm/day; 79.2mm/day; 137mm/day with an episode of 63mm/3hr). Similarly, the other two autochthonous cases occurred during a period of high rainfall (13.6\u201323.8mm).\n\nPellizzer et al.36 performed a sero-epidemiological study to evaluate the risk of leptospirosis in a population in Northeast Italy exposed to a severe flood event. This area is endemic for leptospirosis and exhibits and average of 4 cases/100,000 inhabitants. Seven out of 44 subjects exposed to floodwaters exhibited anti-Leptospira specific IgM antibodies and five were confirmed positive by micro-agglutination test. Re-testing a few months later found significant antibody titers greater than 100 against serovar Copenhangeni in three cases (6.8% seroconversion rate). Overall, the rate for seroconversion for leptospirosis appeared to be low, and while flooding appeared to be the sole risk factor, confirmation was not possible due to a lack of a control group.\n\nAhern et al.15 reviewed earlier studies addressing flood-associated outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide-range of countries: Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, India, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Portugal, and Puerto Rico. In 1997 in the Krasnodar Territory in Russia, a severe outbreak of leptospirosis took place in connection with a high flood.49 Sanders et al.50 stated that flooding after heavy rain favors leptospires. It prevents animal urine from being absorbed into the soil or evaporating; therefore leptospires may pass directly into the surface water or persist in mud. The evidence of this review, supported by several other reviews, suggests the association between leptospirosis and flooding is fairly robust even in high-income countries.\n\nPrecipitation changes are known to effect the reproduction, development, behavior, and population dynamics of arthropod vectors, their pathogens, and non-human vertebrate reservoirs.10 Mosquito-borne infections tend to increase with warming and certain changes in rainfall patterns. Vector-borne diseases are unlikely to be a problem during the onset phase of the flood, as many vector breeding habitats are expected to be overwhelmed by the flood waters.51 While flooding may initially wash out vector populations, they return when the waters recede. Receding flood water can provide ideal breeding habitats. Therefore, vector-borne diseases are likely to have mid-term to long-term impacts on health following flooding (Fig. 1). Vector-borne virus outbreaks are strictly determined by the presence of the pathogen and particular competent disease vectors.52 The current and future establishment of exotic mosquito species in Europe is a cause for serious concern, as the newly introduced species may already be disease vectors or could potentially become vectors.\n\nWest Nile virus (WNV) emerged in Europe after heavy rains and flooding, with outbreaks in Romania in 1996\u20131997, the Czech Republic in 1997, and Italy in 1998.53 The 2002 flood in the Czech Republic resulted in mass mosquito breeding with a biting frequency peaking at 70 bites per person per minute.54 Specimens from 497 flood-affected residents were examined serologically for mosquito-borne viruses. Paired serum samples showed one Tahyna virus infection among 150 residents.\n\nJim\u00e9nez-Sastr\u00e9 et al.55 sampled dwellings in Tabasco, Mexico, post-flood for dengue fever cases and found the geographical distribution of dengue fever cases was associated with the proximity of two permanent bodies of water. Chen et al.21 found heavy precipitation was a significant risk factor for dengue fever (RR = 1.96; 95%; CI 1.53\u20132.52). Additionally, more non-European studies have also examined relationships between flooding and shistosomiasis, Japanese encephalitis, Ross River virus, and Rift Valley fever.21,56-58\n\nWhile evidence of vector-borne diseases associated with flooding from 2004\u20132012 in Europe was sparse (Appendices A, D) older studies have shown associations. In Romania, flooded basements were a significant risk factor for WNV in apartment dwellers (p = 0.01).59 In 1997, heavy rains in Moravia, Czech Republic resulted in flooding, and mosquito populations in the area amplified immediately.60 WNV activity was reported in the area. Hub\u00e1lek and Halouzka61 stated environmental factors such as flooding can facilitate the re-emergence of WNV.\n\nPublic health interventions include those made before, during, and after flooding to reduce vulnerability to infectious diseases. Interventions need to take place at a variety of levels: individual, household, community, regional, national, and international.51 The public health measures cited in the literature to reduce the risk of infectious diseases as a result of flooding focus on: risk assessments, enhanced surveillance systems, and specific prevention and control measures depending upon the type of infectious disease risk.62,63\n\nA rapid disease risk assessment should be conducted by a representative multi-agency group within the first week of the flood including: data on the flooded region and displaced persons, the main disease threats for the enhanced surveillance system, baseline data collection, and identification of priority interventions.62,63 During a flood event, hand-held devices that allow workers to enter and analyze data in the field can assist the rapid risk assessment.64\n\nExisting disease surveillance systems can be enhanced to target specific diseases or syndromes and to support timely response actions to reduce disease impact and risk of transmission.62,63 Public health teams need to establish adequate disease surveillance systems which take into account the inherent disruption of the public health infrastructure that may occur during flooding. An enhanced surveillance system should be adaptable and context-specific, monitor key epidemiological data and compare with baseline data, monitor vulnerable groups, identify any emerging outbreaks, and result in timely public health action. In high-income countries, risk assessments and surveillance systems need to be very refined to detect small differences from baseline incidence data.51\n\nPrevention of infectious diseases following flooding involves maintenance of health services, provision of shelter, clean water supplies, proper sanitation, regular and adequate food supply, and in some cases mass vaccination campaigns and control of disease vectors.62,63 Water and sanitation are vital elements in the transmission of water-borne diseases; hence, providing clean drinking water is a priority in the initial days following flooding. Clasen et al.65 found that household interventions were more effective in preventing diarrhea than interventions at the water-source. Interventions at the household level reviewed included: chlorination, filtration, solar disinfection, and combined flocculation and disinfection. Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al.66 found hand-washing interventions can reduce diarrhea episodes by one-third.\n\nRodent control is another prevention measure that needs to be considered during flooding. The local rodent species and their behaviors should be identified, water and food storage containers should be rodent-proofed, and solid waste should be properly stored, collected, and disposed.62,63 According to Bhardwaj et al.33 prompt and vigilant fever surveillance activities in pre-flooding preparedness plans, rodent control programs, and improvement of environmental sanitary conditions may help greatly reduce leptospirosis incidence.\n\nVector control can reduce disease transmission by rendering the environment unfavorable for the survival, development, and reproduction of the vector.62,63 Establishing surveillance for the introduction of new vector species could contribute substantially to vector-control. An expert should identify vectors responsible for local disease transmission, the factors that influence transmission, location of breeding ground, and which measures of control should be implemented. Local destruction of breeding sites after flooding has receded is extremely effective, so individuals should remove unused vessels and stagnant water when possible. Water storage containers need to be covered to protect from disease vectors, such as egg-laying female mosquitoes. Individuals can protect themselves against mosquito bites by using repellents during biting hours, mosquito nets, and screens in doors and windows.\n\nIndividual and community awareness and participation is essential for successfully reducing the risk of infectious diseases following flooding. Understanding the social and cultural influences on response behavior in the time of a flood emergency is crucial to inform the design and targeting of warnings and health education messages.1\n\nSome studies showed the frequency of infectious diseases can increase in the weeks to months after flooding, and Figure 1 illustrates when infectious disease outbreaks following flood events are likely to occur. However, there remains scientific uncertainty about the strength of association between infectious disease incidence and flooding. Floods can cause population displacement and changes in population density, raise concern about waste management and the availability of clean water, as well as affect the availability and access to healthcare services. All of these are risk factors for an infectious disease outbreak. Kouadio et al.13 and Watson et al.67 suggested that unless there is a substantial population displacement, there is minimal risk of infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following flooding. Overall, the risk of infectious disease following flooding is context-specific, differs between countries, and is dependent upon a number of synergistic factors. Outbreaks of leptospirosis and diarrheal diseases following flooding have been documented in Europe18,28,29,34,36,38,42 but the evidence of increased incidence of vector-borne diseases following flooding is lacking because the time lag before onset can be several months.68 Past studies have indicated possible associations between vector-borne diseases and flooding in Europe.36,59-61 European residents may be exposed to these risks while traveling. Foreign relief workers can potentially introduce infectious diseases into an area affected by flooding and these workers may be susceptible to endemic diseases that are more prevalent because of the flood.\n\nSurveillance in flood-affected areas is fundamental to understanding the impact of flooding on infectious disease incidence. Surveillance and early warning systems may reduce current and future vulnerability. A comprehensive risk assessment could help determine priority diseases for inclusion in the enhanced surveillance system and prioritize prevention and control measures. In addition to surveillance and early warning systems to detect epidemic-prone diseases, assuring access to clean water, proper sanitation, adequate shelter, and primary healthcare services is essential.\n\nDespite a considerable amount of research on the relationship between infectious diseases and flooding, globally and in Europe, the body of information still remains fragmentary. Many studies attempted to collect data retrospectively, had methodological shortcomings, lacked longitudinal data/baseline health data, control groups for comparison, and measures of clear disease outcomes. The studies included in this review were mainly observational studies with widely varying quality levels and study designs. Because it is unethical to conduct experimental studies on this topic, rigorous observational studies must be continue to be undertaken. Observational studies can present particular challenges because of the unpredictability of the timing and location of floods. Reporting and recall bias was very likely in many studies. Additionally, many studies relied on data from disease surveillance systems. Obtaining relevant disease surveillance data pre-, mid-, and post- flooding is frequently challenging. Population displacement can distort the rates of comparison for infectious disease incidence. The quality and robustness of disease surveillance systems can vary from country to country, and a country with a weak disease surveillance system will probably lack pre-flood baseline data. Flood damage to pre-existing public health infrastructure can exacerbate weaknesses in a disease surveillance system. Furthermore, it is difficult to attribute an increase in infectious disease incidence solely to a flood event, and therefore this issue may be under-investigated and under-reported. Finally, this systematic review is not entirely exhaustive, and there may be many other reports in gray literature, but the quality is likely to be lower than the peer-reviewed published reports identified.\n\nIt is important for health officials and the public to understand that exacerbation of disease risk factors contribute to infectious disease outbreaks following flooding. Population and individual vulnerability and resilience factors can worsen or mitigate infectious diseases following flooding. The community needs to be aware of actions that can facilitate or prevent infectious disease. To mitigate infectious disease risk following flooding, those involved in flood planning, response, and recovery should be aware of the results of this systematic literature review. If climate change causes more floods, then the future health burden of infectious diseases from floods could increase. In Europe, maintenance and continuous adaptation and improvement of public health measures is important to sustain the low risk of infectious disease outbreaks following floods. Presently, there are clear research needs to improve the understanding of the association between infectious diseases and flooding:"}
