{"title": "Supporting on-line material", "body": "The general synthesis protocol for N3 and compounds listed in Table 3 is depicted by the preparation of N1 and N2 (Scheme 2). After removal of the Boc protecting group in (1), coupling with Boc protected tripeptide acid (4) was carried out to produce N2 with 81% yield. Switching the N-substituent was accompanied with treatment of N2 with trifluoroacetic acid and coupling with 5metylisoxale-3-carboxylic acid (3) to provide N1 with 82% yield. "}
