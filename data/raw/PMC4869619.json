{"title": "Partitioning of Viruses in Wastewater Systems and\nPotential for Aerosolization", "body": "The Ebola outbreak\nin 2014 raised new questions about routes of\ntransmission of the disease. Aerosol transmission is theoretically\npossible but remains unproven.1 Experiments\nwith non-human primates have shown that inhalation exposure to Ebola\nvirus can lead to fatal infection.2\u22124 Patients with Ebola virus\ndisease expel large volumes of diarrhea,5,6 which may contain\nup to 107 genome copies of virus per milliliter,7 and toilets, sewer systems, and wastewater treatment\nplants are known to produce bioaerosols.8\u221219 The combination of these factors indicates that the potential exists\nfor aerosolization of Ebola virus from wastewater systems. Sanitation\nfacilities that are common in developed countries, such as pressure-assisted\nflush toilets and aeration basins, may provide opportunities for aerosolization\nof the virus that do not exist in western Africa, where the vast majority\nof cases of Ebola virus disease have occurred.\n\nGiven that Ebola\nis a high-consequence pathogen, it is critical\nto consider all possible exposure routes. What we define as the \u201csecondary\u201d\naerosolization exposure route (i.e., aerosolization from sources other\nthan the infected host) has been established as a concern for other\ndiseases. For example, a combination of epidemiological, experimental,\nand modeling approaches suggests that aerosolization from toilets\nand sewer pipes contributed to an outbreak of severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome in an apartment complex in Hong Kong in 2003.19 An important factor in determining the potential\nfor a pathogen to spread via aerosolization from wastewater is partitioning\namong the aqueous phase, biosolids, which are not as easily aerosolized,\nand material surfaces. If a pathogen partitions preferentially to\nbiosolids or surfaces, then the potential for aerosolization is reduced.\n\nThe goal of this research was to assess the partitioning of viruses\nin fluids and materials characteristic of modern wastewater systems.\nWe measured the partitioning of an unenveloped virus (MS2) and an\nenveloped virus (Phi6) among the liquid phase, solids, and porcelain,\npolyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene, and concrete surfaces, using\nboth synthetic sludge and real, anaerobically digested sludge as model\nfluids. Results from this work will provide information not only about\nthe potential for aerosolization of viruses but also about their fate\nin wastewater systems.\n\nBecause surface chemistry\naffects partitioning, we considered both\nunenveloped and lipid-enveloped viruses: MS2 and Phi6, respectively.\nMS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) is an icosahedral, single-stranded RNA bacteriophage\n\u223c27 nm in diameter and is widely used as a surrogate for enteric\nviruses in environmental studies.20\u221223 Phi6 (kindly provided by P. Turner\nof Yale University, New Haven, CT) is an icosahedral, double-stranded\nRNA bacteriophage \u223c85 nm in diameter and has been proposed\nas a surrogate for Ebola virus,24 although\nthe structures of the two viruses differ (i.e., roughly spherical\nvs filamentous). Table S1 of the Supporting Information compares the structure\nof Ebola virus and the two surrogates. We propagated the bacteriophages\nusing host bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas syringae, and standard culture methods. Concentrations\nin stock suspensions were 108\u20131010 plaque-forming\nunits per milliliter (PFU mL\u20131).\n\nWe tested\nfour bowl-shaped materials commonly used in wastewater\nsystems: porcelain, PVC, polypropylene, and concrete. The Supporting Information provides further details\nabout the containers used in this study.\n\nAs a surrogate for\ndiarrhea, we tested both synthetic sludge and\nreal sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant. We considered\nboth types of sludge to balance a well-defined composition of the\nfluid against real-world conditions. For synthetic sludge, we followed\na published recipe25 with the following\nmodifications. We adjusted the solid content to match that of our\nactual sludge. We substituted egg white albumin for bovine serum albumin\nfor economic reasons. We used a strain of Bacillus and E. coli isolated from anaerobically digested\nsludge as model Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms of\nenteric relevance, rather than yeast. For real sludge, we collected\nanaerobically digested sludge from a wastewater treatment plant whose\nflow is dominated by domestic sources (>99%). We stored the sludge\nat 4 \u00b0C and used it within a few weeks of collection to ensure\na robust population of microorganisms. Its total solid content was\n30 g L\u20131, and its volatile solid content was 3.5%. Table S2 shows additional properties of the sludge.\nWe did not sterilize the sludge out of concern that doing so would\nalter its properties and affect partitioning results. We seeded both\ntypes of sludge with MS2 or Phi6 to achieve a final bacteriophage\nconcentration of 107 PFU mL\u20131.\n\nWe conducted experiments in triplicate for each combination of\nbacteriophage, material, and type of sludge (2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 =\n16 combinations), as illustrated in Figure S1. For each replicate, we filled a container with 10 mL of sludge\nseeded with bacteriophage and 40 mL of autoclaved, ultrapure water\nto achieve a dilution similar to what might occur with diarrhea in\na toilet. After 5\u201310 min, we transferred the fluid, including\nsuspended solids, to a sterile, 50 mL tube and centrifuged it at 1700\nrcf for 3 min. We collected the supernatant as the \u201cliquid\u201d\nfraction. We poured excess fluid off the pelleted solids, briefly\nvortexed them, and denoted these as the \u201csolid\u201d fraction.\nFollowing established methods for recovery of viruses from surfaces,26,27 we collected the \u201csurface\u201d fraction using three sterile\ncotton swabs (Puritan 22029488) in series, each premoistened with\nsterile LB broth. We swabbed systematically and with constant pressure\nover the entire exposed surface area and subsequently eluted virus\nfrom the three swabs into 1 mL of LB broth by compressing and swirling\nthe swab in a sample tube. The swabbed surface area was \u223c115\ncm2 (\u00b110%) for all materials.\n\nTo prepare samples\nfor analysis by quantitative polymerase chain\nreaction (qPCR), we first converted RNA to cDNA. Immediately upon\nseparating the fractions, we extracted RNA from 140 \u03bcL subsamples\nof each fraction using a Qiagen QiAamp Viral RNA kit. For calibration\nstandards, we also extracted viral RNA from serially diluted stock\nsuspensions of each bacteriophage, whose concentration (PFU mL\u20131) was determined by a plaque assay, and carried it\nthrough the entire preparation and analysis process.28,29 We omitted carrier RNA from the extraction processes to increase\nRNA extraction efficiency, and we subjected Phi6 RNA to a postextraction\nheat shock treatment (110 \u00b0C, 5 min).30 We immediately synthesized cDNA using a Bio-Rad iScript cDNA Synthesis\nKit with 5 \u03bcL of template RNA, 4 \u03bcL of iScript 5x, 1 \u03bcL\nof reverse transcriptase, and 10 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water,\nusing the kit\u2019s recommended thermocycler protocol. We stored\nsamples at \u221220 \u00b0C until they were analyzed.\n\nWe used\nqPCR to quantify virus concentration in each fraction and\nin the calibration standards in terms of PFU equivalents per milliliter.\nWe analyzed fractions from synthetic sludge in triplicate (experimental\nreplicates) by intercalating dye-based qPCR using Bio-Rad SYBR Green\nMastermix with 5 \u03bcL of SYBR Green, 400 nM forward and reverse\nprimers,30,31 2.4 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water, and\n1 \u03bcL of cDNA template. We analyzed fractions from real sludge\nin triplicate (experimental replicates) by probe-based qPCR using\nBio-Rad iQ Supermix with 5 \u03bcL of iQ Supermix, 400 nM forward\nand reverse primers, 300 nM probe,30 1.72\n\u03bcL of nuclease-free water, and 1 \u03bcL of cDNA template. Table S3 shows the primers and probes, and Table S4 lists the qPCR conditions.\n\nFor\nquality control, we employed serial dilutions of genomically\nsequenced calibration standards, triplicate reactions, negative template\ncontrols, and melt curve analysis. The calibration curve covered a\nminimum of 6 orders of magnitude to equate qPCR amplification of genomic\ncopies to the concentration determined by a plaque assay in standards. R2 values for calibration curves ranged from\n0.96 to 0.99. We prepared serial dilutions of cDNA and analyzed all\nstandards and samples in triplicate (technical replicates) on the\nqPCR machine (Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system and C1000 thermal cycler).\nNegative template controls did not amplify. Additional controls are\ndescribed in the Supporting Information. Of the 144 individual experimental replicates, we discarded four\nthat failed to amplify. We reviewed preliminary qPCR results using\nthe machine\u2019s software to verify the calibration curve and\nmelt curve, including quantification cycle results. Melt curve analysis\nshowed a single, well-defined peak at the expected melt temperature\nfor the genome.\n\nWe spiked\nMS2, an unenveloped bacteriophage, and Phi6, an enveloped\nbacteriophage, into diluted synthetic and real sludge in porcelain,\nconcrete, PVC, and polypropylene containers and measured partitioning\namong the liquid, solids, and the interior surface of the container. Figures 1 and 2 show the concentrations of MS2 and Phi6, respectively, in\nterms of PFU equivalents in three experimental replicates of each\nfraction derived from diluted synthetic sludge. The three fractions\nwere 46 mL of liquid, 4 mL of wetted solids, and 1 mL of surface extract.\nMS2 and Phi6 partitioned similarly in synthetic sludge; concentrations\nwere highest in the liquid and solid phases for all materials tested,\nwith the exception of Phi6 in porcelain, where Phi6 concentrations\nwere comparable in all three fractions. Mean concentrations of MS2\nin each fraction were within 1 order of magnitude of each other, while\nmean concentrations of Phi6 varied by up to 2 orders of magnitude.\nBackground concentrations of genomic material were detectable in both\ntypes of sludge, particularly for Phi6, but were at least 4 orders\nof magnitude lower than in the seeded sludge.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show the concentrations\nof MS2 and Phi6, respectively,\nin terms of PFU equivalents in three experimental replicates of each\nfraction derived from diluted, real, anaerobically digested sludge.\nThe variability was much larger in real sludge than in synthetic sludge,\nlikely due to heterogeneities in the real sludge. The average concentration\nof MS2 in the solid fraction was \u223c2 orders of magnitude lower\nthan in the other fractions for all materials except concrete. Average\nconcentrations of MS2 were highest in the liquid fraction for concrete,\nporcelain, and PVC (Figure 3). In polypropylene, the highest concentration was found in\nthe surface extract. The average concentrations of MS2 in the liquid\nand surface extract from concrete were of a similar order of magnitude;\nhowever, the surface samples exhibited much larger variability. Average\nconcentrations of Phi6 in real, anaerobically digested sludge were\nhighest in the liquid fraction for all materials. Average concentrations\nwere \u223c1\u20132 orders of magnitude lower in the surface extract\nand were 2\u20134 orders of magnitude lower in the wetted solids\n(Figure 4).\n\nA mass balance indicated\nthat the sum of virions recovered (PFUs)\nfrom all three fractions was roughly within 1 order of magnitude of\nthe number of virions initially spiked into the samples (Table S5), so the amount of virus recovered was\nclose to the amount spiked into the samples. One exception was Phi6\nin real sludge, for which the total amount of virus recovered was\n2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher, on average, than the number\nof virions spiked into the samples for all four material types. A\nnegative control consisting of sludge that was not spiked with virus\nfailed to amplify, so the extra virus did not originate from the sludge.\nIt appears that Phi6 replicated rapidly in host bacteria present in\nthe sludge during the experiment, and thus, the partitioning results\nrepresent both spiked and new virus.\n\nFigure S2 shows the partitioning of\nMS2 and Phi6 among the three fractions for synthetic and real sludge\nand all four materials. In all cases, at least 94% of the virions\npartitioned into the liquid fraction. In synthetic sludge, up to 4%\nof virions partitioned to the solids, while in real sludge, no more\nthan 0.8% of virions partitioned to the solids. In synthetic sludge,\npartitioning to the material surface was low, at most 1% except for\nPhi6 in porcelain, where 6% of virions partitioned to the surface.\nIn real sludge, partitioning to the material surface was also low,\nalthough both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of concrete\nand polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain and PVC.\n\nThis study demonstrates that partitioning of viruses in wastewater\namong the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does not mitigate\nthe potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the virus remains\nin the liquid phase. Airborne viruses have been detected at wastewater\ntreatment facilities at concentrations as high as 3 \u00d7 106 genome copies m\u20133 for adenovirus.17,32 Previous studies have shown that virus removal efficiency in wastewater\ntreatment plants ranges widely from 0 to 4 logs.33\u221235 In contrast\nto our results, some of these studies have shown that viruses adsorb\nwell to solids. Our results are consistent with the general finding\nthat the extent of removal of bacteria is greater than the extent\nof removal of virus in conventional treatment plants.\n\nWith respect\nto concerns about transmission of Ebola virus, one\nlimitation of this study is that the surrogate viruses may not be\nrepresentative of Ebola virus. Its filamentous shape may make it more\nor less prone to adsorb to solids and surfaces. Another limitation\nis that the time allowed for partitioning was only 5\u201310 min,\nwhich could be representative of the time excreta remains in a toilet\nbefore flushing but is much shorter than the residence time in sewers\nand at wastewater treatment plants.\n\nWe have identified five\npotential sources of uncertainty in quantification\nof virus concentrations. Although our qPCR calibration curves had\nhigh R2 values, the differing matrices\nof the three fractions may have produced varying extraction and amplification\nefficiencies. It is possible that genomic material from inactivated\nvirus and/or exogenous genomic material was counted as PFU equivalents.\nInhibitors are a challenge for any PCR analysis and if severe will\nresult in false negatives or underestimates of gene copy levels. In\nthis study, we expect that any effects of inhibitors would have been\nminimal, as we were operating at the mid to upper end of the calibration\ncurve and did not have difficulty detecting virus in any of the samples.\nAlso, the mass balances did not suggest a major loss of virus. Because\nof requirements of the experimental approach, the surface fraction\nalso included any virions present in the residual liquid that remained\nin the bowls after pouring out the contents; allowing the bowls to\ndry out completely prior to swabbing would not have eliminated these\nvirions. Previous studies have shown that the swabbing method recovers\n7\u201358% of viruses from dry environmental surfaces, depending\non the type of swab, virus, surface material, and virus assay (culture\nvs molecular).26,27 Thus, there is the possibility\nfor both overestimation and underestimation of the amount of virus\nthat partitioned to porcelain, concrete, PVC, and polypropylene in\nthis study. The mass balance (Table S5)\nsuggests that large amounts of virus were not lost during the experiment,\nbut even if the actual numbers of virions on surfaces were 10 times\nhigher, the majority of virions would still be associated with the\nliquid phase."}
