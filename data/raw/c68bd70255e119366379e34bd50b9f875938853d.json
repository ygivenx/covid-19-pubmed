{"title": "First detection of Nebovirus and Norovirus from cattle in China", "body": "using the Primescript TM reverse transcription kit (TaKaRa, China) and stored at -20 \u00b0C.\n\nPrimers targeting the nebovirus genome were designed (using Primer 5.0 software) based on virus metagenomics sequencing data [GenBank accession number SUB2762873] obtained from a previously acquired calf diarrhea sample, which included nebovirus, as well as the nebovirus nucleotide sequences in GenBank. The primer sequences were as follows; F: 5'-CAG CCC GTC TGG GTG AAT -3'; R: 5'-CCA GCG TTA GCG TTC CAG -3'. The amplified fragment was 524 bp, composing part of the RdRp (1 bp to 297 bp) and the capsid gene (298 bp to 524 bp). For NoVsGIII, primer sets CBECU-F/CBECU-R were used to amplify 532 bp of the RdRp ORF of the virus according to previous reports [30] .\n\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with Premix Taq\u2122 (TaKaRa, China), following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR amplification products were gel-purified using a gel extraction kit (OMEGA, USA) and then cloned into the pMD19-T vector and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells. The recombinant plasmids were extracted using a plasmid extraction kit (OMEGA, USA) and sent to Sangon Biotech (China, Chengdu) for sequencing.\n\nAmong the 28 fecal samples from cattle, 3 diarrhea samples from 2 farms were positive for nebovirus (accession numbers in GenBank: MF182624-MF182626 for strains LZB-1, YLA-1 and YLA-2 respectively). Meanwhile, 3 diarrhea samples from 3 farms were positive for NoVsGIII (accession numbers in GenBank: MF182621-MF182623 for strains HBC-1, SCD-1 and YLA-3, respectively). YLA-1, YLA-2 and YLA-3 were all discovered at the same farm, which indicated there was co-circulation of nebovirus and norovirus at this farm.\n\nDiarrhea is one of the commonest diseases of calves in China, which leads to serious economic losses. Bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus have been identified as major diarrhea causing viruses. However, there is little attention to neboviruses and noroviruses in terms of calf diarrhea. Although the number of samples was limited, the study confirmed for the first time the presence of neboviruses and NoVsGIII in China, which has significant implications for the diagnosis and control of calf diarrhea in China.\n\nThe partial nucleotide sequences of the neboviruses and noroviruses identified in this study were analyzed using the MegAlign software to calculate sequence identities to other strains in GenBank. MEGA 6.0 was used to perform multiple sequence alignment and subsequently to build a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree with bootstrap support.\n\nThe 524 bp of the 3 neboviruses sequences in this study shared 88.4% to 97.7% nt identity to each other and 77.1% to 92.9% nt identity with neboviruses sequences in GenBank. The YLA-1 and LZB-1 strains shared 84.7% nt identity with Bo/DijonA216/06/FR, 81.5-85.1% nt identity with NB-like strains and 77.9-80.0% nt identity with NA1like strains. The YLA-2 strain shared 90.1-92.9% nt identity with NB-like strains, 87.4-88.4% nt identity with NA1like strains and 77.1% nt identity with Bo/DijonA216/06/ FR. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two of the three strains clustered with Bo/DijonA216/06/FR isolated in France (Fig. 1) , which supported the presence of a novel \"DijonA216-like\" genotype in China. The other strain clustered with the NB-like strains.\n\nAn alignment of the cloned 524 bp fragment amplified from neboviruses showed that YLA-1 and LZB-1 had similar nucleotide organization to Bo/Dijon216/06/FR. Interestingly, this genotype of nebovirus shared regular nucleotide mutations within the partial capsid sequence (312 bp to 412 bp within the cloned sequences) when compared with the other two genotypes of nebovirus (Fig. 2) . This data further supports the results whereby YLA-1 and LZB-1 clustered phylogenetically with Bo/DijonA216/06/ FR .\n\nAnalysis of the 532 bp fragment representing the NoVs-GIII isolates indicated that the 3 NoVsGIII sequences shared 91.7% to 98.5% nt identity with each other and 75.3% to 89.0% nt identity with NoVsGIII sequences in GenBank. The 3 NoVsGIII strains in this study shared 84.8-88.9% nt identity with genotype 1 and 76.1%-80.8% nt identity with genotype 2. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all 3 strains were genotype 1. Interestingly, the 3 sequences clustered into an independent branch (Fig. 3) . Previous studies have suggested that genotype 2 is the main genotype worldwide, and genotype 1 is a minor circulating genotype [7, 10, 27] . It is therefore valuable to further investigate the prevalence and genotypes of NoVsGIII in China. In conclusion, this study has confirmed for the first time the presence of neboviruses and NoVsGIII in China, which will have significant implications for the diagnosis and control of calf diarrhea in China. The two nebovirus strains in this study clustered with Bo/DijonA216/06/FR, which supports the presence of a novel \"DijonA216-like\" nebovirus genotype in China."}
