{"title": "DIFFERENTIATION OF BOVINE CORONAVIRUS (BCoV) GENOTYPES BY A RESTRICTION ENZYME ASSAY", "body": "Coronaviridae) (5, 7) , with a genome formed by a singlestranded non-segmented positive-sense RNA with 32 kb, arranged in a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry in association with the N nucleoprotein, a conserved phosphoprotein with 50-60kDa rich in basic amino acids (7, 9) . The viral envelope of BCoV is formed by a lipid bi-layer with four structural proteins (HE, S, E and M), resulting in a spiked structure (9).\n\nThe major envelope protein of BCoV is the spike (S) protein, organized as trimers that appear as 20-nm-long projections in the viral envelope with domains responsible for receptor binding, hemagglutination and induction of neutralizing antibodies. Spike protein is the most polymorphic among all coronavirus proteins and is divided in the subunits S1 and S2 (2, 3). Brand\u00e3o et al. (1) reported the existence of two different genotypes of BCoV in Brazil and one of these has a deletion of 18 nucleotides in the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of S gene.\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the use of a restriction enzyme assay as a specific, sensitive and practical tool to differentiate genotypes of BCoV for the molecular epidemiology of BCoV-caused diseases.\n\nA restriction enzyme selection was carried out based on the 488bp amplicon respective to the S1-coding region of BCoV described by Brand\u00e3o et al. (1) . The nucleotide region of the GenBank sequences AF058942 and AY606200 referent to the above-mentioned amplicon was used, being the second sequence representative of the deleted genotype.\n\nUsing the Bioedit 7.0.5.3 software (6), the GsuI (BpmI) restriction enzyme was selected which is able to cleave the "}
