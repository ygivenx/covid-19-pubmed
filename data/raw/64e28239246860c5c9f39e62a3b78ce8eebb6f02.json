Biological and Biochemical Characterization of Temperature- Sensitive Mutants of JHMV", "body": "Coronaviruses are common viruses found in many animal species from birds to man [See Robb and Bond (1979a) for review]. They produce significant organ and systemic disease in their natural hosts, diseases that often persist and become chronic (e.g., encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, lymphadenitis).\n\nThese viruses are transmitted by droplet inhalation and/or ingestion.\n\nIn the previous two papers, we have characterized the in vitro biology and the 1 To whom reprint requests should be addressed at the Department of Pathology, The Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, Calif. 92037.\n\n2 Present address: Department of Microbiology, University of Montana, Bozeman, Mont. 59715. intracellular virus-specific RNA and protein synthesis of two closely related murine coronaviruses: JHMV, a neurotropic virus, and A59V, a less neurotropic virus. This paper describes a murine model of coronavirus-caused encephalitis and primary demyelination (acute encephalomyelitis) and the preliminary characterization of our collection of 34 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of JHMV. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture amI virus titration.\n\nThe growth and titration of methods of JHMV and A59V in 17CL-1 cells are presented in the first of the two previous papers (Robb and Bond, 197913) . The doubly cloned JHMV wild-type (wt) \"parent\" (Robb and Bond, 1979b) was subjected to N-methyl-N'-nitrosaguanidine (NTG) or 5-fluorouridine (5FU) mutagenesis. The concentration of each drug was chosen so that infectivity was reduced by 90-95% after mutagenesis. Cells were infected in suspension with a m.o.i. = 0.10. After a 30-min adsorption at 33\" with agitation every 5 min, the cells were either treated with NTG or 5FU in the following manner. NTG: Infected cells were plated into MultiWell plates (Falcon) using 6 x lo5 cells per well in 1.0 ml DEBZ. After a 4-hr incubation at 33\", 4 pug of NTG in 8 ,ul of sterile deionized water was added to each well. After an additional 4-hr incubation at 33\", the NTG-containing medium was aspirated, the wells rinsed once with 1.0 ml DEBZ, and the cells incubated with 1.0 ml DEB2 per well for an additional 16 hr at 33\". 5FU: Infected cells were plated into MultiWell plates at 6 x lo5 cells per well in 1.0 ml DEB2 containing 500 ,ug/ml 5FU. After a 6-hr incubation at 33\", the medium was aspirated, the infected cells were rinsed once with 1.0 ml DEB2 per well, and the cells incubated with 1.0 ml DEB2 per well for an additional 18 hr at 33\". A modified version of the previously described (Robb, 1973) replica-plating microtechnique for the isolation of ts animal virus mutants was developed. The modification was necessary because the titer of any given clone of JHMV was not high enough for reproducible replica plating. Three types of plastic culture vessels (Falcon) were used: the mutagenesis procedure used MultiWell plates with 24 wells/plate and 1.0 ml/well; the procedure for cloning mutagenized virus used Microtest plates with 60 wells/plate and 10 pi/well (\"master plates\"); and the replica plating procedure used Microtest II plates with 96 wells/plate and 0.10 ml/well (\"replica plates\"). The mutagenized viruses from a single MultiWell were plated into Microtest master plates at a dilution that would infect about half of the 60 wells in each plate. This initial plating of mutagenized virus used a sterile Hamilton syringe with repeating dispenser to inocu-late each \"master well\" with the virus and 1000 17CL-1 cells in 10 ,ul of DEB2 (Robb, 1973) . These master wells were incubated at 33\" for 48 hr and all infected wells were replica plated into two Microtest II replica plates in the following manner. Each \"replica well\" was first filled with 0.10 ml of DEB2 containing 4 x lo4 17CL-1 cells. Five microliters from an infected master well was then added to each of two corresponding replica wells of the two replica plates. When all the master wells derived from a single MultiWell were replica plated into replica wells, one set of replica wells was placed at 38.5\" and the other set at 33\". After a subsequent 48-hr incubation at the respective temperatures, the replica wells were examined with phase contrast microscopy for the presence of JHMVspecific syncytia formation.\n\nThe replica wells that had syncytia at 33\", but not at 38.5\", contained potential temperaturesensitive JHMV mutants. Only one potential mutant was picked from each original MultiWell of mutagenized virus, a process that insured the independence of each mutant isolate.\n\nEach potential mutant was tested to confirm its ts nature. The cells in the 33\" replica well containing the presumed mutant were scraped with a sterile rubber policeman, sonically disrupted, and cloned by the endpoint dilution microtechnique (Robb and Bond, 1979b) . Two clones of a potential mutant were then picked from each of the independent isolates, incubated with 5 x lo5 17CL-1 cells in 0.5 ml DEB2 at 33\", plated into individual wells of a Multi-Well plate with an additional 0.5 ml DEBB, and incubated at 33\". Each of the two clones thus grown was harvested and titered at 33 and 38.5\". The clone with the greatest inhibition of syncytia formation at 38.5\" (reduction in the 38.5\" titer) was grown into a stock of mutant virus and the other clone was destroyed. Only mutants having a lOOO-fold or greater reduction in their ability to form syncytia at 38.5\" were studied further. The \"restrictive\" temperature of 38.5\" was chosen to provide the largest temperature differential (33\" vs 38.5\") while staying within the body temperature of a mouse (37-39\"). Perma-nent designations will be assigned to each mutant according to the nomenclature for animal viruses developed for mutants (Robb, et al., 1972) after the affected protein or complementation group has been identified.\n\nof virus-specific intracellular RNA. One million 17CL-1 cells were infected with wt JHMV or ts mutants of JHMV at an m.o.i. = 0.1. Virus adsorption was at 33\" for 30 min. Following virus adsorption, the cells were divided into four aliquots and duplicate samples were incubated in 1 ml of DEB2 at 33 and 38.5\". One microgram of actinomycin D (Merck) was added at 6 hr postinfection (hpi) (38.5\") or 12 hpi (33\"), and 15 min after the addition of the actinomycin D 25 $Zi of [3H]uridine (New England Nuclear) (specific activity 40-50 Wmmol) was added. After a further 2-hr incubation at either 33 or 38.5\", the dishes were placed on ice, the medium was removed, the cells were extracted with 1.0 ml 1% Nonidet-P40 (NP40) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, and the cell extract was pooled with the previously removed medium.\n\nThese 2.0-ml samples were brought to 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to inhibit RNase activity and were stored at -70\". After thawing, duplicate 50-~1 aliquots from each sample were assayed for acid-precipitable radioactivity. Radioimmune precipitation. The radioimmune precipitation technique using polyspecific mouse anti-JHMV serum to precipitate [35S]methionine-labeled protein has been previously described (Robb, 1977) . The properties of this anti-serum is described in the previous paper .\n\nSDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and fluorography.\n\nTotal viralspecific intracellular proteins and radioimmune precipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described in the previous paper . Immunofluorescent microscopy.\n\nThe fixation techniques using absolute methanol or formaldehyde-Triton X-100 (cell culture) and 95% ethanol (brain) are presented in the first of the previous two papers along with the preparation of the mouse anti-JHMV serum (Robb and Bond, 1979b) . The antiserum reacts with all JHMVspecific proteins observed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis as determined by radioimmune precipitation . Mouse brains were prepared for immunofluorescent microscopy using the ethanol fixation-paraffin embedding procedure of Sainte-Marie (1962) . Serial sections of each specimen were examined, one section by light microscopy using a hematoxylinleosin stain and the other sections by immunofluorescent microscopy using sera from seronegative-uninfected, JHMVinfected, or A59V-infected adult BALB/ c mice.\n\nElectron microscopy. All procedures used in the preparation of mouse brain for transmission electron microscopy have been previously described (Lampert, et al., 1973) . Inoculation of animals. There were three types of inoculation. (i) Intracerebral (ic) inoculation:\n\nAnimals were inoculated with 10 ~1 of fluid in the right frontotemporal region just posterior and superior to the eye. (ii) Intranasal (in) inoculation: Animals received 10 ~1 of fluid on one nostril and were watched until they inhaled the droplet. (iii) Intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation: Ten microliters of fluid was injected within the peritoneal cavity of each animal. All inoculations were carried out with a Hamilton syringe in a repeating dispenser. Sterile, disposable, 27-gauge, 0.5-in. needles were used for all inoculations. Infected animals were anesthetized with phenobarbital (ip) and soaked in 70% ethanol before dissection. Infectivity assay of JHMV in mouse brain. One aseptically removed mouse brain, approximately 1.0 ml in volume, was mixed with 4.0 ml PBS, pH 7.4, containing 25 mgltiter tetracycline.\n\nThe mixture was homogenized in a sterile Ten-Broeck homogenizer using lo-15 strokes. The homogenized fluid was clarified at 733 g in a Sorvall GLC-1 centrifuge at 25\" and stored at -70\" or immediately titered. The infectivity assay of the clarified brain homogenate fluid was performed in the following manner. Fluid, 0.5 ml, was added to 1 x 106 17CL-1 cells and incubated for ROBB, BOND, AND LEIBOWITZ \n\n>10,000 <lo-* 650 <lo-* 85 <lo-* 3,500 <lO-* 600 <lO-* >10,000 <lO-* >10,000 <lo-* >10,000 10-3 >10,000 <lo-* >10,000 <lO-* >10,000 <lO-* >10,000 <lo-* > 10,000 10-S >10,000 0.007 >10,000 <lO-* ~10,000 <lO-' >10,000 <lo-* >10,000 <lO-* >10,000 \n\nNeg 0 Neg u Ability to form syncytia at 38.5\": ratio of the titer in Syncytial Forming Units (SFU)/ml at 38.5\" to the titer at 33\". Virus was grown at 33\" from an m.0.i. = 0.0001. * Total virus-specific RNA synthesis:[3H]uridine was added in the presence of 1 pgiml actinomycin D to 17CL-1 cells infected at a m.o.i. = 0.1 (see Robb et al., 1979 for details). The ratio of mutant/wt RNA synthesis at 38.5\" was divided by the ratio of mutant/wt RNA synthesis at 33\" to provide the data shown. RNA-minus is defined as a value of less than 0.10. RNA-intermediate is defined as a value between 0.10 and 0.75. RNA-plus is defined as a value greater than 0.75. c 17CL-i cells were infected with an m.o.i. = 0.0001, adsorbed at 33\" for 30 min, and plated into replicate 32-mm petri dishes. Duplicate dishes were incubated at 33, 37, and 38.5\" for 48 hr. The total yield of virus in each dish was then titered in duplicate. 30 min at 33 or 3'7\" with agitation every 5 min. Eight milliters of DEB2 was then added, and 0.2 ml of the cell-brain fluid suspension was plated into each of four 32-mm petri dishes (Falcon). The dishes were incubated at 33\" for 72 hr and scored for infectivity by observing the presence of syncytia formation along two perpendicular diameters.\n\nIf infectivity was not detected, the remaining 4.5 ml of the brain homogenate fluid was assayed for infectivity.\n\nIf infectivity was observed, the brain homogenate fluid was quantitatively titered by the endpoint dilution microtitration method described above. Reconstruction experiments using noninfected brain homogenate with a known amount of virus that was added immediately after brain homogenization or brain homogenate that was made immediately after the intracerebral injection of a known amount of virus, have provided a lower limit of detection of l-3 infectious units (iU) per brain.\n\nAssays for serum neutralization of virus infectivity.\n\nTwo microculture techniques were used to assay specific JHMV neutralization activity in sera. One technique measured the loss of infectivity by immunofluorescence and the other technique measured the loss of cytopathic effect. Both assays gave similar quantitative results. Virus infection and addition of serum was similar for both assays, but JHMV was used at a m.o.i. of 0.1 for the immunofluorescent assay and at a m.o.i. of 0.01 for the cytopathic assay. JHMV, at 5 x lo5 iU/ml DEB0 (no FBS) for the immunofluorescent assay and at 5 x lo4 iU/ml DEB0 for the cytopathic assay, was mixed with the test serum. Additional DEB0 was added to provide a constant amount of virus in 0.10 ml with 20, 10, 5, 2.5, or 0% serum. These mixtures were incubated at 37\" for 30 min. After the incubation, 10 ~1 of the virus-serum mixture was added to 0.10 ml of 1 x lo6 1'7CL-1 cells in DEB2 for immunofluorescence or to 5 x lo5 cells/ml for eytopathic effect. The mixtures were plated into Microtest plates using 2 ,&well. This plating procedure provided 100 iUlwel1 for the immunofluorescent assay and 10 iU/ well for the cytopathic effect assay. The plates were incubated at 33\" for 7 (immunofluorescent) or 24 hr (cytopathic effect). The reduction in the number of immunofluorescent foci or in the number of infected wells (cytopathic effect) was determined. The reciprocal of the serum dilution producing a 50% reduction from control values (0% serum) was used as the neutralization titer. Fetal bovine serum (20%) and mouse anti-JHMV serum (3%) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.\n\nThe basis of mutant selection was the inability of the mutants to induce syncytia at 38.5\". The ratio of the ability to induce syncytia at 38.5\" versus 33\" was determined by titering the cloned mutant stock at each temperature, as the microtiter assay is based upon syncytia induction. All mutants had a 38.5733\" titer ratio of lob3 or less ( Table 1) .\n\nProduction of Total Virus-Specify Intracellular RNA at 38.5\" Three groups of mutants were defined by the relative ability of mutants to synd Number of infectious units (SFU) required to kill 50% of 4-week-old BALBic mice after ic inoculation as calculated by the procedure of Reed and Nuench, 1938. e Detection of brain infection after ic inoculation: Brain tissue was examined for JHMV-specific immunofluorescence, for infectious virus, and for neuropathology by light microscopy (H & E) as described under Materials and Methods. The \"wt\" designation for the mutants indicates that, in the animals that became ill after infection, the immunofluorescent staining pattern was similar to that after JHMV infection. AEM, acute encephalomyelitis; CM/D, chronic meningitis with demyelination in spinal cord, but without evidence of an acute encephalitis; Neg, no evidence of neuropathology in brain or spinal cord by light microscopy.\n\nf The type of virus recovered from infected brains (e.g., 113 ts = the recovered virus in one of three brains from which infectious virus could be recovered was a temperature-sensitive mutant that could not be distinguished from the inoculated mutant).\n\ng Not done.\n\nFIG. 1. Thermostability of virions. Four O.l-ml aliquots of each virus were incubated in a 45\" (kO.2') constant temperature water bath for 0, 15, 30, or 45 min. Duplicate microtitrations were made on each sample. The range of variability for JHMV is shown by the upper two lines (arrow) using six independent determinations and three pools of virus (two determinations for each pool). All mutants deviating from JHMV were retested independently at least twice. Residual infectivity is plotted as a function of length of incubation. thesize virus-specific RNA at 38.5 and 33\" relative to wild-type JHMV RNA synthesis at both temperatures. The three groups are shown in Table 1 and represent \"RNAminus\" mutants, \"RNA-intermediate\" mutants, and \"RNA-plus\" mutants. Mutants derived by both mutagens are represented in the minus and intermediate groups, but only mutants derived by 5FU mutagenesis are represented in the plus group.\n\nProgeny Virus Yields at 33, 37, and 38.5\"\n\nThe body temperature of a mouse is quite variable and ranges between 37 and 39\". It was therefore necessary to determine the ability of the mutants to multiply at both 37 and 38.5\" as compared to 33\" to allow suitable correlations between altered neuropathogenesis and mutant genotype (i.e., is the altered neuropathogenesis due to the mutation or simply to \"leakiness\" of the mutant at temperatures less than 38.5\"?). The data are presented in Table 1 . In spite of the fact that syncytia induction was inhibited to less than lop3 at 38.5\", progeny virus production was significant at 38.5\" for N19 and 20FU, both RNA-intermediate mutants. In fact, 20FU was distinguished from JHMV only because it did not induce syncytia at 38.5\". In spite of their \"leakiness\" at 37\", several mutants had LDjis of greater than 10,000 iU: RNAminus; 23FU, 24FU; RNA-intermediate, N16, N18, N19, N70, N71, 8FU, 33FU, and 37FU.\n\nVirus-Speci$c Antigen and Protein Synthesis at 38.5\"\n\nThe JHMV-specific immunofluorescence was similar for JHMV and all 34 mutants at 33\" using living, methanol-fixed, and formaldehyde-Triton fixed infected cells. At 38.5\", however, no viral specific antigens were detected by immunofluorescence in infected cells with the following exceptions: N19, 4FU, and 15FU all induced viral antigens which gave wt immunofluorescence although the amount of syncytia induction was markedly reduced. Cells infected with 8FU or 1OFU and were incubated at 38.5\" were indistinguishable from those infected with wt JHMV when tested by immunofluorescence. These two mutants were capable of inducing syncytia in infected cells. The fraction of infected cells incubated at 38.5\" which contained viral-specific antigens detectable by immunofluorescence was approximately the same as the ratio of virus yields at 38.5\"/33\" for 20FU, 23FU, and 42FU.\n\nRadioimmune precipitation of JHMV proteins was not as sensitive as immunofluorescence for detecting viral antigens. When infected cells were incubated at 38.5\" and radioimmune precipitation was used as an assay for viral-specific protein synthesis, only 4FU, SFU, and 42FU induced detectable JHMV-specific proteins, all at a greatly reduced level when compared with wt JHMV. The analysis of total intracellular proteins for JHMV-specific proteins synthesized by the mutants at 38.5\" by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis gave results comparable to that found by radioimmune precipitation.\n\nThe data in Fig. 1 show that wild-type JHMV loses G-40%, 25-65%, and 25-80% of its original infectivity after 15-, 30-, and 45min incubations at 45\", respectively. A59V is more thermolabile than JHMV. The mutants fall into three groups: 30 mutants similar to JHMV; 4FU with a modest initial loss; and N3, 5FU, and 23FU with marked thermoinstability. and/or demyelination after intracerebral inoculation with the doubly cloned wild-type JHMV. Figure 2 demonstrates that BALB/c mice were very sensitive to the intracerebral infection. The Swiss-Webster mice were less sensitive than the BALBlc mice and exhibited an all-or-none response independent of the dose of JHMV. The SJL mice were also less sensitive than the BALB/c mice, but the infection was dependent upon the dose of JHMV unlike the infection in the Swiss-Webster mice. The BALBlc strain was chosen for further investigation because of the sensitivity and reproducibility of JHMV infection in this strain. Another advantage of the BALBlc strain is that the 1'7CL-1 cells were derived from the BALB/c strain and are syngeneic. The third, fourth, and 0 io io u Three strains of mice were tested: BALBlc, Swiss-Webster, and S.JL. JHMV, 10, 100, or 1000 infectious units, was inoculated into five mice. The animals were observed for 16 days. The day of death is given for each mouse. The total number of animals that died is given at the top of each column for each dose of virus for each strain. JHMV was tested after its third (P3), fourth (P4), and sixth (P6) passages in 17CL-1 cells at 33\". sixth passages of wild-type JHMV were hippocampus.\n\nAstrocytes, oligodendroequally neuropathogenic in BALB/c and cytes, and neurons are infected during Swiss-Webster mice showing that the the first week of infection.

These lesions were similar to inoculation.\n\nthose described by Lampert et al. (1973) . Three routes of infection were examined in 4-week-old BALB/c mice to determine the ability of the doubly cloned JHMV to produce lethal encephalomyelitis.\n\nThe data are given in Table 2 . Intraperitoneal infection using up to 10,000 iU/mouse produced no clinical disease. Intracerebral infection was very effective in producing a lethal encephalitis with an LD,, of about 2-4 iU depending on the source of the mice. Intranasal infection was also effective, but loo-fold more virus is required by this route than by the direct intracerebral route.\n\nAltered Neuropathogenesis Figure 3A demonstrates by immunofluorescence JHMV-specific antigens in the Biochemical analysis of variants of JHMV and A59V might reveal differences in virus structure or multiplication that could be correlated with the selected alteration in neuropathogenesis.\n\nTo this end, we selected the JHMV-R strain which is less neuropathogenic than JHMV by repeated passages of JHMV in 17CL-1 cells using a m.o.i. = 0.0001. An A59V-R strain which is more neuropathogenic than A59V was selected by five intracerebral passages of A59V in 4-week-old BALB/c mice selecting the a Animals were observed for 3 weeks after inoculation. Focal spinal cord demyelination occurred in all animals surviving the ic inoculation of JHMV and A59V at the 100 and 10 iWanima1 doses. None of the survivors at the 1 or 0.1 iU/animal doses developed demyelination, probably as a result of not being infected as calculated by the Poisson distribution. Hepatitis was not detected by light or immunofluorescent microscopy.\n\nIr LD,, calculated by the procedure of Reed and Muench, 1938. c Not done. 4 . Demyelination in the brain of a BALB/c mouse. A 4-week-old BALB/c mouse was inoculated with 10 iU of JHMV by the intracerebral route 21 days before examination by transmission electron microscopy. Two normally myelinated small axons (arrow) are present within a group of demyelinated axons (Ax). MN indicates the nuclei within two macrophages that have removed the damaged myelin from the demyelinated axons.

These with the parent A59V or JHMV or the variants provide a model for acute viralvariants JHMV-R or A59V-R are all pre-induced demyelination in which almost 100% of inoculated animals survive low dose IC infection and have extensive spinal cord demyelination, usually without clinical symptoms. Almost all of the animals recover completely by 2-3 months. A second phase of demyelination does not occur except in a few animals that also seem to have foci of remyelination at 2-3 months after infection (Table 3 ).\n\nThe Neuropathogenesis of 34 Temperature-Sensitive Mutants of JHMV JHMV has an LD,, of 2-4 iU by the intracerebral route in 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Each mutant was tested using five mice for each dose: 101, 102, 103, and lo4 iU/animal. The LDSo was calculated, and the brains and spinal cords of the infected animals were examined for virus infection as shown in Table 1 . Of the mutants, 1307 RNA-minus, 12/14 RNA-intermediate, and 2/3 RNA-plus mutants had an LD,,, of greater than lo4 iU and produced no detectable neuropathology;\n\nl/17 RNA-minus (N32) and l/14 RNA-intermediate (20FU) mutants had an LD,, of greater than lo3 iU and had a neuropathology similar to that in JHMV-infected animals in only the ani-mals that became sick. The virus recovered from one sick N32-infected animal was not temperature sensitive. The healthy animals infected with these mutants had no detectable neuropathology. This neuropathology can be accounted for by the mutants' \"leakiness\" at 37\". Reversion to wtJHMV may also account for part of these findings. An LDSo greater than lo3 iU was found in l/14 RNA-intermediate (31FU) and l/3 RNA-plus (15FU) mutants, but no neuropathology was detectable even in the sick and dying animals. N48 (RNA-minus) has an LDSo of 600 and produced a neuropathology similar to that in JHMV-infected animals. Temperature-sensitive virus was recovered from 212 sick animals. \"Leakiness\" of N48 at 37\" ean account for this neuropathology.\n\nN2 and N3 are very interesting mutants because they produce only a chronic meningitis and demyelination of the brain and spinal cord without an acute encephalitis (i.e., killing of neurons as detected by light microscopy). Neurons, however, do contain JHMV-specific antigens when examined by immunofluorescence.\n\nAn alteration in neuronal function without neuronal death may account for the lethality of the a All animals that became sick within 14 days after infection had clinical encephalitis. The animals that survived became clinically well and stayed well except for those few that received JHMV-R and developed hindlimb paralysis between 60 and 100 days after infection.\n\n* Longitudinal sections of at least 50% of each animal's spinal cord were examined by light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated focal remyelination with a macrophage infiltrate in the A59V-Rinfected animals that relapsed at 60-100 days postinfection.\n\nc Number of additional animals that died after 14 days. a ic means intracerebral inoculation using 10 ylianimal. in means intranasal inoculation using 10 $/animal. ip means intraperitoneal using 10 @animal.\n\nb The animals surviving the primary infection were reinfected 2 weeks after their primary inoculation using 100 iUianima1 in 10 ~1 ic in the contralateral side of the head from the primary inoculation when the ic route was used for the primary inoculation. The animals were observed for 3 weeks after their reinfection. c A dose of 0 iU/animal means the animals were inoculated with a lysate of noninfected 1X1-1 cells (mock infection) using a dilution similar to that of the highest concentration of JHMV.\n\ninfection [LDso of 85 (N3) and 650 (N2)] because neither the \"leakiness\" of these mutants at 37\" (Table 1 ) nor the reversion of these mutants can account for the animal's death. The viruses recovered from the brains of six sick animals infected with N3 were all temperature sensitive. The viruses recovered from the brains of sick NB-infected animals were only temperature sensitive in one of three isolates suggesting a rather high reversion frequency for N2.\n\nDeath by Previous Infection with Temperature-Sensitive Mutants Pilot experiments were performed to determine which routes of primary infection would protect mice from a subsequent lethal ic infection with JHMV. A59V was inoculated ic, in, and ip using doses of 0, 10,100, and 1000 iU into each of five 4-week-old BALB/c mice for every point. Two weeks after the primary infection, all animals were inoculated with 100 iU of JHMV in the contralateral cerebrum. The animals were observed for three weeks after the JHMV inoculation. Only the intracerebral route of the primary infection was protective (Table 4) .\n\nFifteen mutants were subsequently tested in a similar manner for their ability to protect mice from a lethal JHMV ic infection. The data in Table 5 show that all the mutants tested were protective and that some mutants were more efficient than others in terms of the infectious units per animal required for this protection.\n\nThe murine and human coronaviruses are serologically related and extrapolations from the murine to the human disease are likely to be rewarding. Second, the diseases produced by the viruses are naturally occurring diseases produced in their natural host using doses (l-100 iU/animal) of virus and either a natural (intranasal or intraoral) or experimental (intracerebral or intraperitoneal) route of infection. The use of our collection of temperature-sensitive mutants and selected variant non-temperature-sensitive viruses should enable us to elucidate the disease process caused by this group of viruses during natural infections in both mice and men.\n\nOur mutants were selected by their inability to induce syncytia at low multiplicities of infection (\"fusion from within\") rather than the inability to produce infectious progeny virus at restrictive temperature (38.5\"). Of concern was the possibility that we would select a skewed collection of one or a few specific classes of mutants rather than a collection containing mutants having defects in many, if not all, the viruscoded proteins. Our collection, however, has RNA-minus, RNA-intermediate, and RNA-plus mutants and at four tentative complementation groups. The identification of the affected protein by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to continuing attempts to define complementation groups should eventually allow the proper grouping of each mutant.\n\nOur attempts to analyze the in viwo neuropathogenesis and immunology/immunopathology were curtailed by the serious problem that essentially all commercially available BALBlc mice had been previously infected with a murine coronavirus as detected by our microimmunofluorescence and microneutralization assays (data not shown). All of these animals were reported as \"negative for mouse hepatitis virus\" by the suppliers using complement fixation assays. Fortunately, the experiments using intracerebral inoculations are not altered by this finding because a previous infection by the nasal or oral route (the natural routes) The animals were observed for 3 weeks after their reinfection.\n\nAt the time of the reinfection with JHMC, the animals were 6 weeks old and more resistant as shown by the death rate of 40% (215) for JHMV using 100 iU compared to a death rate of 95% in 4-week-old animals (Table 2) . c A dose of 0 iU/animaI means the animals were inoculated with a lysate of noninfected 17CL-1 cells (mock infection) using a dilution similar to that of the 10 iU dose of JHMV.\n\ndoes not interfere with a subsequent intracerebral infection (Table 5) . Therefore, the data in Tables 1, 3 , and 5 are valid. The data in the other tables, where intraperitoneal or intranasal inoculation appear to be valid, but must be confirmed by further experiments using germ-free mice or mice that have been shown to be seronegative by immunofluorescence. Further work is necessary to define the mechanisms of protection afforded by intracerebral inoculation of A59V (Table 4 ) and some mutants ( Table 5) .\n\nThe altered neuropathogenesis produced by mutant N3 is of interest. Intracerebral infection by this mutant produces chronic meningitis and demyelination with an LD,, of 85 that cannot be explained by \"leakiness\" or reversion. Histologically, neurons are not killed as they are by JHMV infection (encephalitis), but are infected as detected by JHMV-specific immunofluorescence.\n\nThe anti-JHMV serum used for this immunofluorescence is polyspecific and recognizes intracellular JHMV-specific proteins . Monospecific antisera will have to be used to define further the protein(s) synthesized in the N3-infected neurons. One intriguing possibility is that the N3-infected neurons are simply \"dysfunctional\" and not lethally altered or made susceptible to immune attack. This type of dysfunctional attack is probably only clinically important in an organ such as the brain, where the neurons cannot be replaced by newly regenerated parenchymal cells as occurs in the liver, lung, or kidney. Such a hypothesis may gain some support from the work of Oldstone et al., (1977) who showed that the differentiated protein synthesis (e.g., choline acetyl transferase, acetylcholine esterase) in murine neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with the neurotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was selectively inhibited compared to uninfected cells and to general protein synthesis in the persistently infected cells. The role of defective interfering JHMV particles in the N3-altered neuropathogenesis is remote because 40 serial undiluted passages of JHMV in vitro do not decrease the production of infectious progeny JHMV (Robb, unpublished observation) .\n\nWe had hoped that by selecting wild-type variants with altered neuropathogenesis, we could develop a \"two-phase\" (acute and persistent) model for virus-caused demyelination, possibly analogous to human multiple sclerosis. Although we can produce primary demyelination in almost 100% of infected animals without death the animals recover and very few have persistent demyelination beyond 2-3 months (Table 3) . One temperature-sensitive mutant of JHMV has been isolated by Haspel et al. (1978) that produces both acute and persistent demyelination after intracerebral inoculation.\n\nPresent work is focused on identifying the biochemical differences between the temperature-sensitive mutants, the wildtype non-temperature-sensitive variants JHMV and A59V. We are also biologically and biochemically characterizing 17CL-1 and murine neuroblastoma cells that are persistently infected with JHMV and A59V, and the viruses recovered from these cells, to identifiy some of the mechanisms used by these viruses in establishing persistent disease."}
