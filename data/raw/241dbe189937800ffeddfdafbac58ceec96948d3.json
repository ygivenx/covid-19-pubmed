{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Applications of google search trends for risk communication in infectious disease management: A case study of COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan Applications of Google Search Trends for Risk Communication in Infectious Disease Management: a Case Study of COVID-19 Outbreak in Taiwan", "body": "As of February 20 th , 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported there were 75,748 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020a) . The infection has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) since January 30 th , 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020c and has been spread in 27 different countries (World Health Organization, 2020a) . Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan.\n\nCoronavirus, handwashing, and face masks related terms from GT were collected from December 5 th , 2019 to February 8 th , 2020. These search terms represented the information search for COVID-19 and practice of personal hygiene in order to prevent disease transmission. Relative search volume (RSV) data were filtered by geographic regions in Taiwan. GT data then were compared with daily data on COVID-19 cases that were obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control' website.\n\nMoving average with interval of three days of GT queries and number of COVID-19 cases were put into chart to observe the trends along the period of observation. This moving average method used to facilitate the trends comparison among datasets. Time-lag correlation was utilized to assess whether J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the raised of GT data were correlated with the following increased of COVID-19 cases, as previously applied in other study (Shin et al., 2016) .\n\nCOVID-19 related searches in Taiwan remained low in period of the first case was detected on December 12 th , 2019 (CNN, 2020) and continuously increased with the announcements of Taiwan' first imported case on January 21 st , 2020 (Taiwan CDC, 2020) . The same trend as occurred in worldwide and China (Strzelecki, 2020) . However, COVID-19 related searches in Taiwan continued to extend and reached its peak on January 30 th , 2020 as local cases were reported and the declaration of WHO for PHEIC was issued globally. It took two weeks for COVID-19 related searches to reach its peak and continuously declined afterward since the massive availability of information provided in online news reporting, video/radio news reporting, and health expert reporting (Keller et al., 2009) in the first week of February 2020, which was identified as peak of outbreak in observation period.\n\nIn addition, face masks related searches in Mandarin also increased as raised of COVID-19 related searches. Public restlessness seems to drive immense purchases of face masks that lead to face masks shortage in Taiwan that forced Taiwan government to loosen restrictions on surgical mask imports (Tzu-yu and Yi-ching, 2020). And due to massive panic buying of masks, Taiwan government has announced in February 3rd that face masks will be distributed through National Health Insurance (NHI) contracted pharmacies and drugstores started from February 6 th 2020. This policy might also correspond with declined of masks-related searches after D point (Taiwan CDC, 2020) Otherwise, searches for handwashing related information were relatively stable in 20 points and quickly increased in the fourth week of January 2020. These searches were gradually increased as declining of COVID-19 and face masks related searches. This condition indicated that people were still gathering information about necessary handwashing practices for personal hygiene and protection while lacking face masks.\n\nAccording to Fig.1 , the dynamics of GT data in Taiwan were related with the vulnerability due to the confirmation of local COVID-19 and public restlessness given the announcement of international warning from the WHO. Therefore, GT data could be used to frame the proper timing for risk communications to the public. Additionally, Fig.2 showed huge numbers of COVID-19 searches in six J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cities including Taipei (100 points), New Taipei (73 points), Taoyuan (85 points), Taichung (80 points), Tainan (82 points), and Kaohsiung (87 points).\"coronavirus \u4e2d\u6587\"was the term with the highest Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This keyword represented a strong tendency of Taiwanese people to search for information in Mandarin language for disease and symptom-related information.\n\nAccordingly, GT data could also depict the information needed by users based on keyword utilization.\n\nIn lag period, high to moderate correlations between Google RSV and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), and Tainan (lag-1). This finding reflected the increased of googling activities in one until three days before the increased of COVID-19 cases.\n\nWhile in Taichung and Kaohsiung, information searches increased in same day as increased of cases. Moreover, a distinct phenomenon found in New Taipei which indicated the increased of Google searches still found in two days after increased of COVID-19 cases.\n\nThese findings indicated that GT can be used as a tool to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan at a range of 1 to 3 days before the increased of confirmed cases. In addition, the Taiwan Providing proper information during the outbreak through risk communication is urgently needed.\n\nAppropriate risk communication could help prevent infodemics (World Health Organization, 2020b) or an excessive amount of information circulating in affected populations which might induce public restlessness or panic. In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location for risk communication.\n\nNo competing interest declared.\n\nThis research did not receive any specific grant.\n\nNo need for ethical approval as used of anonymous open data.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
