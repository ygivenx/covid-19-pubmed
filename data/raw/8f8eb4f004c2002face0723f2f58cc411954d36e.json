{"title": "Complete Genome Sequence of Bordetella bronchiseptica Strain KM22", "body": "20-kb insert library preparation protocol (https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/ Procedure-Checklist-20-kb-Template-Preparation-Using-BluePippin-Size-Selection -System.pdf). The 20-kb library was sequenced with a PacBio RS II platform using two single-molecule real-time (SMRT) cells, resulting in 283,436 total reads and an average read length of 7,600 bp. Reads were subsequently assessed for quality using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).\n\nWhole-genome assemblies were generated using PacBio SMRT Analysis v. 2.3.0 and Canu v. 1.5 (28) software. The average PacBio coverage for the assembled genome was 475\u03eb. Assembling the PacBio data resulted in a fully sequenced closed circular chromosome, which was subsequently oriented to start at the dnaA gene and trimmed by removing any overlapping sequence. The genome was then polished and error corrected using the Broad Institute's Pilon v. 1.18 software (29) along with the Illumina GAIIx 3,474,442 paired-end sequencing reads, which were previously used for the draft assembly (26) . Default parameters were used for all software. The closed KM22 genome was then annotated using NCBI's Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) (30) . The complete genome of KM22 consists of 5,205,646 bp with a G\u03e9C content of 68.2%, a total of 4,827 predicted protein coding sequences (CDSs), 9 rRNA operons, 1 transfermessenger RNA (tmRNA), 3 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and 56 tRNAs.\n\nData availability. The whole-genome sequence for Bordetella bronchiseptica isolate KM22 was deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number CP022962. The PacBio read data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject accession number PRJNA398562 and SRA study accession number SRP222122 (run numbers SRR10134673 and SRR10134672). Illumina HiSeq short read sequences have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number ERS027415.\n\nWe thank the Yale University Center for Genome Analysis for their assistance in producing the PacBio sequence data.\n\nFunding for this research was provided by the USDA Agricultural Research Service.
