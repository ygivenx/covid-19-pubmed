{"title": "Tracking Nosocomial Diseases at Individual Level with a Real-Time Indoor Positioning System", "body": "Nosocomial infections, or known as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), are infections that are acquired in a healthcare setting, such as those caught during an inpatient hospital stay or developed among patients and healthcare staff within a healthcare facility. HAIs have become one of the greatest challenges in the modern world and a global threat to health security. Magill et al. [1] estimated that there were around 722,000 HAIs in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, and the [2] reported that around 75,000 patients deaths were related to HAIs. Among the different types of transmission routes of HAIs, the most important and common one is through person-to-person contact, or known as direct-contact transmission. Person-to-person contact transmission takes place when there is a physical contact between an infected or colonized individual and a susceptible person such that disease-causing microorganisms may be transfered. In many cases, due to the incubation period of the infectious disease or unawareness of the disease severity, the disease had already been spread through the hospital before the index patient was identified and quarantined.\n\nA striking example of recent HAI outbreaks through person-to-person contact transmission is the spread of 2013 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Assiri et al. [3] reported that, of the 23 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in eastern province of Saudi Arabia, 21 cases were acquired by person-to-person transmission in different healthcare facilities including hemodialysis units, intensive care units (ICUs), and in-patient units. In the incident, Patient A with symptoms of dizziness and diaphoresis was admitted to a hospital. No MERS-CoV test was performed and this patient was not suspected of carrying this deadly virus at the time of admission. Another patient, Patient C, was admitted on the next day to the room adjacent to Patient A to undergo hemodialysis. Later, MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in nine other patients who were receiving hemodialysis treatments in the same hospital, six of whom had overlapping time with Patient C undergoing hemodialysis. MERS-CoV infection also developed in a nurse administrator, who had once been present in the ICU where the treatment of Patient A was provided. From this incident, [3] concluded that person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV can be associated with considerable morbidity in healthcare facilities and suggested that surveillance and infection-control measures are crucial to a global public health response.\n\nAnother classic example of large HAI outbreaks is the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The 2003 SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths in total around the globe [4], and 1755 confirmed cases and 299 deaths in Hong Kong alone (World Health Organization (WHO) 2003). The SARS outbreak began at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in Hong Kong. The index patient was admitted to PWH before WHO issued a high global alert about cases of this deadly pneumonia. Due to the unawareness of this previously unknown virus, the index patient was not treated as a carrier of a highly infectious and severe disease and SARS started to spread through the hospital among the patients, healthcare workers and visitors, resulting in at least 138 additional cases of SARS acquisition within the hospital (including at least 20 doctors, 34 nurses, 15 allied health workers, and 16 medical students) [5]. The disease was further spread to the community through the individuals leaving the hospital, e.g., leading to the outbreak in a housing estate Amoy Gardens with a total of 329 residents infected and 42 deaths [6], and became an epidemic threatening the world. During the outbreak, the governmental organizations (e.g., Department of Health and Hospital Authority) and public health workers put substantial efforts into contact tracing for effective infection control [6, 7]. It turns out that the contact tracing work was one of the key interventions that helped the Hong Kong Government successfully contained the SARS epidemic, e.g., through screening of symptoms and medical surveillance.\n\n\n\nThe lesson learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests that a rapid contact tracing is critical for effective quarantine and epidemic management in serious disease outbreaks in hospital settings. A traditional way of conducting contact tracing relies on interviewing. However, conducting interviews may be ineffective because the patient is generally very sick to recall and talk about the past activities and contacts. Another way is to interview the healthcare workers to reconstruct the patients\u2019 past activities. However, both ways cannot guarantee the information is exhaustive and accurate. More importantly, these procedures require lengthy investigations such that prompt isolations cannot be carried out to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\nOur research was motivated by a project initiated at PWH after the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. The project objectives were to mitigate HAI risk and to support rapid contingency responses in case of severe infectious disease outbreak. Our research team investigated how advanced indoor positioning technologies can be applied to enhance the person-to-person contact traceability for prompt contact tracing, and developed a radio-frequency identification (RFID) system for tracking people\u2019s interactivities (including those among patients and ward staff) and tracing high-risk individuals when infectious disease outbreak occurs. A pilot study was carried out in two medical wards at PWH. Our research team developed an RFID-based real-time locating system for this application. Figure 1 shows a screen-shot of the real-time locating system. For the details of the RFID hardwares, we refer the reader to [8]. It is worth mentioning that the rare experience that the hospital management and staff members of PWH had gone through during the 2003 SARS outbreak and their suggestions were crucial when developing this platform. While our pilot study was enabled by RFID, other indoor positioning technologies are also viable. In our application, RFID was adopted because it is a mature technology and can be deployed at a affordable cost.\n\nA vision-based system is an alternative technology capturing events of person-to-person contacts and monitoring activities of healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients. It can accurately review whether two individuals have been in close contact. Also, most hospitals have installed vision-based systems in the waiting area such as lobbies, escalators, etc., for surveillance purpose. However, such systems may raise privacy issues when installed in wards. In particular, patients\u2019 and HCWs\u2019 privacy is always a primary concern in Hong Kong. It is unlikely that HCWs and patients would accept an environment putting them under constant visual recording. Thus, a sensing method appeared to be more receptive in this study.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of HAIs, we characterize the contact patterns among the patients and healthcare workers, and study how an HAI is transmitted through person-to-person contact. From the on-site pilot project conducted at PWH, a large amount of positioning data of patients and healthcare workers were collected. This set of data provides the unique and necessary information to construct dynamic human networks to trace person-to-person contacts, and to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways individuals contact with each other in a healthcare environment. After the constructions of human networks within the healthcare facility, we investigate how an HAI is transmitted through person-to-person contact. This investigation requires the capability of tracking the transmission paths of HAIs at an individual level. In other words, we infer the health status of any person at any time and identify potential infected patients and healthcare workers.\n\nOur research is different from traditional epidemiology studies, which investigate the spread of infectious disease among people. Traditional epidemic models, for example, [9\u201311], assume homogeneous human connection (i.e., all individuals in the population are the same) and model the spread of infectious diseases with ordinary differential equations. As suggested by [12], individual differences should be considered when modelling the transmission and designing more effective strategies to reduce the propagation of disease. For HAIs, the assumption that all individuals are equally likely to be infected does not hold, and therefore estimates from community-based models can be inaccurate [13]. Due to the importance of considering individual interactions, some approaches have been proposed to capture the impacts of individual differences using heterogeneous networks, such as the percolation methods [14] and the non-linear dynamical system [15]. However, there is inadequate research on studying the problem of individual-level tracking of HAIs, where most existing methods can hardly be applied to identifying individual infection status. The novelty and uniqueness of our research are as follows. (1) The contact pattern of patients and healthcare workers in a healthcare facility differs from the contact pattern of people in a large region, for example, a city, studied by a majority of the existing epidemic research. A healthcare facility is a relatively closed community with a highly hierarchical and modular structure, leading to dense human connectivity. On the other hand, a city-level population is sparsely connected. (2) We construct time-varying networks to represent dynamic human interaction in a hospital, while many existing models assume static networks that treat human contact unchanged over time. (3) Individual differences in a healthcare setting are related to the roles of individuals in a hospital. As an example, a nurse generally has more interactions with other people than a patient does. (4) We aim to track transmission of HAIs at an individual level that infers the hidden health status for any person at any time, while traditional epidemic models focus on macro-level phenomena such as the total number of infected individuals and epidemic thresholds.\n\nThe recent advancement of real-time indoor positioning technologies has provided us with a precious opportunity to study the spread of infectious disease from a new perspective. Given the locational data of patients and healthcare workers in a healthcare institution collected continuously to the system, if an outbreak of an HAI occurs in the institution among patients and healthcare workers, our goal is to track transmission of the HAI at an individual level through person-to-person contact over time-varying contact networks. To achieve the goal, we propose a framework with three key components: time-varying network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation. We realize individual-level transmission tracking with the assumption that all input parameters for the HAI model (HAI parameters) are known. Then we discuss our proposed parameter estimation procedure for effective transmission tracking in a more general setting. Our work leverages a previous RFID tracking study in which we collected locational data of patients and healthcare workers for four months in two medical wards at PWH.\n\nOur research investigates the transmission of HAIs over time-varying human networks at an individual level. For an overview of the existing research on epidemic models, we refer the reader to [16\u201320].\n\nTraditional epidemic models such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model are based on differential equations [9, 11]. Pairwise models proposed by [21] also belong to this class; in addition, they leverage the local network structure such as the number of pairs or triples to substitute the simple infection number in standard epidemic models. These differential equation-based models have been widely used for analyzing the spread of various types of transmissible diseases. For example, [22] studied the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and considered network heterogeneities in their differential equation-based model. They showed that their predictive scheme was more accurate than models that assume homogeneous networks. Percolation models utilize network degree distributions and epidemic dynamics to examine outcomes of disease outbreaks in the steady state. [14] showed that a large class of standard SIR models could be solved exactly with the use of percolation theory. This approach is more realistic than the traditional approach as it allows heterogeneous and correlated infectiveness times and transmission probabilities. Meyers et al. [23] applied percolation theory to reduce time-consuming calculations and derive different epidemic outcomes on a contact network for the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Newman [24] and Karrer et al. [25] developed percolation models to study the transmission of two competing diseases based on probability generating functions. Volz [26] showed that SIR model can be represented by a system of ordinary differential equations with the use of probability generating functions. The result enables SIR dynamics to be modeled in random networks.\n\nAnother popular class is probabilistic models. This type of models incorporates uncertainty when modeling the disease spreading process. Larson [27] studied the use of \u201csocial distancing\u201d (e.g., closing of schools, mandated minimum physical distances between co-workers) to control influenza progression by reducing the frequency and intensity of daily human-to-human contacts. He considered heterogeneous populations, distinguished by high-activity and low-activity persons, in their probabilistic mixing model. Teytelman and Larson [28] considered heterogeneous population where the individuals are different regarding their social activities, pronenesses to infection, and pronenesses to shed virus and spread infection. These attributes determine the rate of human contacts per day and impact the probability that a susceptible individual becomes infected. Yaesoubi and Cohen [29] proposed a discrete-time Markov chain approach to modeling the transmission of diseases. Dynamic optimization techniques can be integrated into their model to aid real-time selection and modification of public health interventions. The studies mentioned above, however, focused on population-level epidemics, which differs from an infectious disease outbreak in a healthcare setting.\n\nAs suggested by [30] and [12], human behaviors that might lead to transmission of disease differ significantly between individuals. Much research thus has been carried out to study human interaction pattern. The majority of work in this direction is the use of network analysis. For instance, [31] constructed a bipartite network to represent the connectivity of patients and caregivers in a psychiatric institution. Liljeros et al. [32] studied network properties such as transitivity, assortativity and variation based on a large database constructing from the contact records associated 295,108 inpatients over two years. They concluded that the risk and adverse consequences of epidemic outbreaks might be reduced if these network properties are taken into account when designing the intervention schemes. Ueno and Masuda [33] constructed a hierarchical and modular contact network from a hospital setting. They showed that healthcare workers are main transmitters of diseases and shall be vaccinated with a higher priority. Curtis et al. [34] modeled dynamic contact networks by deriving spatial distributions of healthcare workers and generating random walks to predict human movements in a hospital. Prakash et al. [15] constructed a time-varying network which follows an alternating connectivity behavior to model the day-night pattern of nurse shifts and derived a closed-form equation for the epidemic threshold with their network. In these studies, their main focuses were on the constructions of networks to capture the effects of human interactions on disease transmission. In our work, we construct time-varying dynamic human contact networks from real data and study how these networks can be leveraged for prediction of health status of each individual in a healthcare facility.\n\nResearch on disease transmission in a healthcare setting is not adequately addressed in the existing literature. Meyers et al. [31] modelled the disease outbreak in a psychiatric institution, but their model did not utilize real-world human contact data and required some simplified assumptions, e.g., the connection degree of each object in the model follows a Poisson distribution. Prakash et al. [15] used a non-linear dynamical system to model the spread of infections in a time-varying network which takes into account the shifts of nurses in a hospital. Dong et al. [35] modeled nosocomial infections in an MIT college dormitory using graph-coupled hidden Markov models and solved the problem by Gibbs sampling. However, these studies either are limited to describing macro-level epidemic phenomena for HAIs, or did not attempt solutions to the individual-level transmission tracking problem.\n\nOur research studies the transmission of HAIs at an individual level. We propose a modeling framework to describe the interactions between individuals with a dynamic human contact network and tracks infections over this network. Furthermore, we utilize real-time indoor locating technology for tracking the interactions between individuals and constructing their time-varying contact networks. For our modeling contributions, we develop coupled hidden Markov models to solve the problem. Our method captures the difference of the underlying human connectivity where existing epidemic models are unable to address and contributes to more accurate estimations for predicting macro-level outcomes of HAI outbreaks. Moreover, compared to the existing epidemic models, our proposed approach has the unique capability to estimate individual hidden health status and to infer HAI parameters for practical solutions.\n\nA pair of individuals is considered to constitute a contact if the distance between them is within a pre-specified distance threshold for a duration that is longer than a pre-specified time threshold.\n\nThis definition establishes the foundation that we model the person-to-person transmission of HAIs. A person is considered to have been exposed to the disease if (i) he or she has had any face-to-face contact with an infectious patient, (ii) is in the same hospital room with an infectious patient for more than a certain amount of time, or (iii) is provided care by an infected healthcare worker [3]. With the definition of contact, we construct a person-to-person contact network, denoted by G = (V,E), with vertice set V consisting of individuals in the healthcare facility and edge set E representing the contact records between individuals, i.e., eij \u2208 E indicating a contact between individual vi,vj \u2208 V. The concept of time-varying contact network can then be extended from the above setting:\n\nA time-varying contact network is a series of static contact networks indexed by time points, which is denoted by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$G_{0:T}= \\{G_{t}\\}_{t = 1}^{T} = \\{(V_{t},E_{t})\\}_{t = 1}^{T}$\\end{document}G0:T={Gt}t=1T={(Vt,Et)}t=1T, where V\nt and Et are the sets of individuals and contacts at time t, respectively.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can denote a time-varying contact network by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$G_{0:T} = \\{(V,E_{t})\\}_{t = 1}^{T}$\\end{document}G0:T={(V,Et)}t=1T because any vertex vk that exists but is not present at time t, that is, vk with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$k \\in \\{\\cup _{s = 1}^{T} V_{s} \\}\\setminus V_{t}$\\end{document}k\u2208{\u222as=1TVs}\u2216Vt, can be viewed as an isolated vertex at time t in network Gt.

Technically, symptoms and signs are different; a symptom is a feature observed by the patient whereas a sign is observable by the others, e.g., physicians. For consistency, we use observation to represent a symptom or a sign. The presence of a disease, in general, is difficult to be identified without the use of medical diagnostic tests, and therefore, the actual health state of a patient is often hidden. We define the terms observation and health state used for our model as follows.\n\nAn observation is a feature that reflects the presence of a disease, which can be a symptom or a sign, or both. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}${o}_{t}^{i}$\\end{document}oti denotes the observation of person vi at time t.

Observations and networks are necessary to achieve this goal. Observations provide the essential information for diagnoses of an infection, while networks give the information the set of individuals an infected person has contacted. On the other hand, they also impose practical challenges on the accurate identification of hidden health states of a person. Observations can be misleading since the same observation may appear in different health states. The networking effect complicates the problem in the sense that the health state of a person not only is dependent on his/her medical history but also can be affected by other \u201cconnected\u201d patients. The challenges motivate us to consider the following overall problem, and the three sub-problems required to tackle in our framework.\n\nGiven time-stamped locations of the individuals in a healthcare facility, if an HAI outbreak takes place through person-to-person contact, how can we track the transmission of the HAI over the human contact network at an individual level?\n\n\nGiven time-stamped locations of the individuals in a healthcare facility, how do we establish contact between any\npair of individuals and to construct a time-varying contact network\nG\n0:\nT\nto characterize the human connection pattern?\n\n\nGiven (1) a time-varying contact network\nG0:T\nof the individuals in a healthcare facility, (2) observation vectors\nO0:T\nof these people, and (3) the transmission parameter set\n\ud835\udf03\nof the HAI, if an HAI outbreak takes place, how do we identify the hidden health state\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}${x}_{t}^{i}$\\end{document}xti\nfor\nany person\nvi\nat any time\nt \u2265 0?\n\nGiven (1) a time-varying contact network\nG0:T\nof the individuals in a healthcare facility, (2) observation vectors\nO0:T\nof these people, and (3) a subset\n\ud835\udf03s\nof the HAI parameter set\n\ud835\udf03\nwith\n\ud835\udf03s \u2282\ud835\udf03,\nif an HAI outbreak takes place, how do we estimate the unknown parameter set\ud835\udf03 \u2216\ud835\udf03s?\n\nWe propose a three-stage solution framework, consisting of the approaches to solving the three respective sub-problems, for tackling the overall problem. An overview of our solution framework is as follows.\n\n\nStage1(Time-varying contact network construction) Person-to-person transmission is the primary mode of transmission of HAIs. We define a distance threshold and a time threshold to utilize the time-stamped locations of individuals to construct the list of temporal-spatial co-occurrence events for the establishment of person-to-person contacts. Individuals are divided into multiple groups according to their roles and attributes, and contacts are labeled with four types. We first generate static hierarchical networks based on the types of contacts, and then construct a time-varying contact network.Stage2(Individual-level transmission tracking) We formulate the problem of individual-level transmission tracking with network-based coupled HMMs, in which the SIS model describes the transmission dynamics of HAIs. HMMs are known to have the power to recover hidden pattern from observable information, and shown to be effective in inference of health states, e.g., [36, 37]. Solutions are obtained in three steps. First, we give basic solutions to a standard HMM by considering all individuals as a single vertex. Then we derive solutions at an individual level by factoring basic solutions according to SIS dynamics. Finally, we reduce the computational complexity of the solutions based on mean-field analysis to speed up computations for large-scale problems.Stage3(HAI parameter estimation) The problem of HAI parameter estimation is formulated as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). An auxiliary function is introduced to transform the MLE problem to a computationally efficient optimization problem. By solving this optimization problem with Lagrangian multiplier method, we can obtain the Baum-Welch reestimate and recover the original HAI parameters from this reestimate. This learning method improves the estimation of HAI parameters iteratively.\n\n\nTable 1 summarizes the notation used throughout this paper.\n\n\nWe can establish a linkage between two persons in the contact network by utilizing the information about their temporal-spatial co-occurrence. First, movement trajectories of individuals, e.g. trajectories of person vi and person vj shown in Fig. 2a, are extracted from the time-stamped locational data captured from the indoor positioning infrastructure. The distance between person vi and person vj at any time is calculated; examples of the distances are represented by dashed lines in Fig. 2a. Let dij(t) be a function of time t that measures the distance between persons vi and vj. A contact between vi and vj is established if \u2203t1,t2, where t2 \u2212 t1 > \u0394Tth such that \n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$d_{ij}(t) < D_{th} \\quad \\forall t_{1} \\leq t \\leq t_{2} $$\\end{document}dij(t)<Dth\u2200t1\u2264t\u2264t2 where Dth is the distance threshold and \u0394Tth is the time threshold.\n\n\nA three-level hierarchical network is generated to represent the human connectivity in a hospital environment. Individuals are labeled with their role classes and divided into a patient group and a caregiver group. The patient group is further divided according to the ward where a patient is staying. Correspondingly, there are four types of contacts, namely, intra-ward contacts, inter-ward contacts, intra-type contacts and inter-type contacts. An example of a simple hierarchical contact network is shown in Fig. 3. The bottom-level network consists of patients and they are linked according to intra-ward contacts; the middle-level network consists of both patients and caregivers and they are linked with intra-type and inter-ward contacts; the top-level network consists of inter-type contacts between patient-caregiver pairs.\n\n\n\nA time-varying network can be represented as a series of static networks. We divide a continuous period into discrete time intervals and construct the time-varying contact network by combining the static networks constructed for each time period in sequence. In a hospital setting, it is common to divide a day into a daytime nighttime sessions [15], because most healthcare workers have fixed shift times and human connectivity has dissimilar structures in the two sessions.\n\nMost healthcare facilities adopt a hierarchical and modular structure for the separation of wards and different roles of individuals. Interaction pattern differs between the intra-ward and inter-ward contacts or between the intra-type and inter-type contacts. The time-varying hierarchical contact network naturally captures such characteristics in a hospital environment. Moreover, the hierarchical network is an extension of the bipartite patient-caregiver network in [31]. The bipartite patient-caregiver network assumes that only inter-type contacts exist, but does not consider contacts within the same individual group. Undoubtedly, it would be more practical to consider contacts among caregivers as they are the main transmitters of HAIs.\n\nThe classical SIS model formulates transmission dynamics of HAIs. There are two health states in the SIS model, namely, susceptible and infected. A person can be either susceptible or infected at one time.

Equation 2 indicates that a susceptible person gets infected if one or more of the infectious neighbors transmit the infection to him/her successfully. Equations 3 and 4 respectively state that an infected person recovers and remains infected independently. The SIS dynamics is shown in Fig. 4. The links between vertices represent the person-to-person contacts. At time t, v1,v2 and v3 are infected while v4 and v5 are susceptible. At time t + 1, v4 remains susceptible as the infected neighbors v1 and v3 both fail to transmit the disease to v4. v5 gets infected because v1 transmits the infection to v5 successfully. v2 recovers independently and becomes susceptible at time t + 1 , while v1 and v3 remain infected.\n\n\n\nThe one-step-ahead prediction probability of a sub-HMM is independent of those of other sub-HMMs, or formally\n8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\pi_{t|t-1} = \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\pi_{t|t-1}^{i},  $$\\end{document}\u03c0t|t\u22121=\u220fi=1n\u03c0t|t\u22121i,where n is the number of sub-HMMs.\n\nThe state transition probability ht|t\u2212 1 is determined by SIS dynamics.

Even if complete information on HAI parameters is not available initially, we can resort to this approach to improve estimation of the parameters with the updating observations and the tracked human contact networks. While theoretically the Baum-Welch reestimate converges to a local maximum, our computational experiments to be presented in \u201cComputational study\u201d show that our proposed approach has a good performance in the sense that the estimated values are close to the actual ones.\n\nWe compare our proposed methods of individual-level transmission tracking approaches \u2013 detection (ILTT-DT), tracing (ILTT-TR), one-step-ahead prediction (ILTT-PD1) and pure prediction (ILTT-PD0) \u2013 with the following three baseline methods. \nOrdinary-differential-equation-based SIS model (ODE-SIS) assumes homogeneous populations.

This approach requires an adjacency matrix At to represent the time-varying network at time t.\n\nWe leveraged the RFID human tracking data collected from two medical wards at PWH, which suffered from a nosocomial outbreak the 2003 SARS, for conducting our computational experiments. The data consists of time-stamped locations of 56 patients and 70 healthcare workers in two medical wards over a period of four months. Indoor locations of the tracked objects were recorded every 3 seconds with a spatial resolution of 0.5 meter. We set the time threshold \u0394Tth = 30 minutes and the distance threshold Dth = 1 meter. While these threshold distance and time were chosen to illustrate our idea, our algorithm allows the user to specify these threshold values. We also note that the threshold distance and time depend on the type of the HAI. We constructed static daytime networks and nighttime human contact networks for each time period based on the tracking data; a time-varying hierarchical contact network of 240 time periods was then obtained.\n\nWe considered the nosocomial outbreak of the 2013 MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia [3] for deriving practical HAI parameters.\n\nFrom April 1 to May 23, 2013, thirty-four individuals, including four healthcare workers, acquired MERS-CoV in three healthcare institutions. Fever, cough, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were respectively observed in 20, 20, 11 and 8 individuals. As of June 12, 2013 a total of 15 deaths were related to the disease. We prioritized the observations fever, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms and cough, in a descending order of priority (from 4 to 1). If multiple observations were found at the same time period for an individual, we consider the individual is at the observation state of the highest priority. There were only two health states; each individual either is susceptible (state 0) or infected (state 1). Table 2 provides the health state-observation probability matrix. We include the observation state 0, which indicates that no symptom was found.\n\n\n\n\nIn the experiments, we simulated the health states and observations based on the above setup.\n\nMost existing epidemic models focus on the macro-level phenomena of epidemic thresholds and the infected population. Figure 8 shows the fraction of infections at the steady state for different values of \u03c4/\u03bc on three static networks of snapshots at different time periods, G1, G41 and G62, respectively. G1 and G41 have the same degree distribution whereas G62 differs from them and is more sparse. The mean degrees of three networks are 15, 15 and 4, respectively. Although G1 and G41 have the same degree distribution, the underlying networks are not equivalent. As we observe from Fig. 8a and b, the simulated threshold effects of G1 and G41 are different: the curves of G1 \u201ctake off\u201d at around \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.5 while the ones of G41 \u201ctake off\u201d at around \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.2. Percolation gives the same threshold, \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.4, for G1 and G41 because it considers only the degree distribution of a network but ignores other network properties. ODE-SIS gives the same threshold for three different networks because it assumes a homogeneous connection. NLDS captures the difference between the networks but deviates much from the simulation result. Our ILTT-PD1 predicts the thresholds to be 0.5, 0.2 and 1.2 for G1, G41 and G62, respectively, which are more consistent with the simulated results compared with the other approaches.\n\nFigure 9 shows the plot of infection fraction at different time points resulting from the models for an HAI with infection rate \u03c4 = 0.4 and recovery rate \u03bc = 0.3. Since Percolation is not applicable for investigating transient states over time, we compare only ILTT-PD1, NLDS and ODE-SIS with the simulated result. The plots of infection fraction resulting from ILTT-PD1, NLDS and Simulation all increase rapidly at t = 3, whereas ODE-SIS increases at a significantly lower rate. As expected, ODE-SIS provides the same prediction for three networks because it does not capture the network structures. The simulated infection fraction at steady state ranges from 0.03 to 0.26. Our ILTT-PD1 provides a similar prediction to the simulated results (from 0.03 to 0.30), while NLDS has a significantly deviated prediction ranging from 0.33 to 0.54.\n\nAmong the baseline algorithms, only NLDS applies to time-varying networks. Figure 10 shows the comparison of NLDS, ILTT-PD1, ILTT-PD0 and simulated results on the time-varying network G0:T. As shown in Fig. 10a, ILTT-PD1 predicts the \u201ctake-off\u201d of the outbreak size at a threshold \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.4 while NLDS and ILTT-PD0 predict a lower threshold of 0.3. Figure 10b shows the plot of infection fractions above and below the threshold at different time points. Above the threshold the infection reaches a steady state much higher than the starting point, and below the threshold the infection decays and dies out. Note that ILTT-PD0 and NLDS give almost the same prediction in both figures. The reason is that our model reduces to NLDS when observations of HAIs are not available. Taking advantage of observable information improves the accuracy of prediction, which leads to a better performance of ILTT-PD1 than ILTT-PD0.\n\n\n\nOur proposed method has the capability to track the transmission of HAIs at an individual level. In other words, it infers the hidden health state of any person at any time. In this subsection, we compare the identification results obtained from ILTT-PD1, ILTT-DT, ILTT-TR and NLDS with fixed infection rate \u03c4 = 0.03 and recovery rate \u03bc = 0.02. Outcomes resulting from ILTT-PD0 are identical to NLDS. Figure 11 shows the estimation of the illness evolution of person v1, who is the patient zero of an HAI. This person stayed infected (at state 1) until time period 103 and remains susceptible (at state 0) from that time onwards. ILTT-DT, ILTT-TR, ILTT-PD1 all capture the state transition close to time step 103 whereas NLDS gives a smooth curve with no clear indication of such change in state. ILTT-TR identifies hidden states with the highest accuracy, and the ILTT-DT performs better than ILTT-PD1.\n\n\n\n\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves in Fig. 12 exhibit a consistent trend with the results shown in Fig. 11. We observe that ILTT-TR demonstrates an advantage over the other approaches and ILTT-DT performs slightly better than ILTT-PD1 whereas NLDS\u2019s performance is the worst. Their difference in performance is due to the fact that the approaches utilize different degrees of observable information. ILTT-TR makes use of all available observable information to obtain the estimation of the hidden Markov processes, while NLDS utilizes no observations at all. ILTT-PD1 and ILTT-DT both use past observations, but ILTT-DT performs slightly better because it also captures observable information at present.\n\nWhen an HAI outbreak takes place, the healthcare organization conducts contact tracing to identify the index case and construct epidemiological links with a manual approach. If this patient zero has had frequent contacts with the others, the transmission path can only be estimated based on experience [3, 5]. Our method provides an effective tool to construct the transmission network automatically and accurately. For example, if we consider a person as being infected if his/her tracing probability is greater than 0.5, we can draw a transmission map of the hospital outbreak for the first month, as shown in Fig. 13. 27 individuals in total got infected in the first month. The patient zero v1 transmitted the disease to 4 other individuals and patient v3 is a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d who infected 7 people. This transmission map is similar to the one reported in [3], a real-world hospital outbreak of the MERS-CoV.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the exact values of HAI parameters were not known exactly. Existing models, which are highly sensitive to the precision of HAI parameters, might produce predictions much deviated from the actual situation if parameters are not determined correctly. Our solution framework is capable of refining the estimate of HAI parameters in a step-by-step manner based on available information of observable features and human contacts. As discussed in \u201cHAI parameter estimation\u201d, our solution framework learns the infection rate \u03c4i and the recovery rate \u03bci for any individual vi. Without loss of generality, we set \u03c4p and \u03bcp for the patient group, and \u03c4c and \u03bcc for the caregiver group. The following experiment illustrates the estimation of parameters of SIS dynamics.\n\nFigure 14a and b show the estimation of infection rates and recovery rates for patients and caregivers. The dashed lines indicate true parameter values while the solid lines represent the estimated values at each step of estimation.

In contrast, Fig. 14d shows that the performance of the inference method is sensitive to the initial guess of the initial state distribution \u03c1.

This indicates the importance of an appropriate initial guess of the initial state distribution.\n\nIn this work, we propose a solution methodology integrating the techniques of network epidemiology and coupled hidden Markov models to infer the health state of any person at any time in a healthcare setting. We utilize advanced real-time positioning technologies for tracing person-to-person contacts among individuals, including patients and healthcare workers, in the healthcare facility and construct a time-varying human contact network. We also develop the algorithms for transmission tracking of individuals, with a given set of HAI parameters. We finally propose an estimation procedure to infer unknown HAI parameters to tackle the practical problem that the parameters are not completely known.\n\nWe conduct experiments based on four-month human tracking data collected from two medical wards at PWH, which suffered from the 2003 SARS nosocomial outbreak. Computational results show that our framework provides more accurate results for predicting macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected individuals and epidemic threshold, compared to existing epidemic models."}
