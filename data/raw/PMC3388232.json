{"title": "TLR9 agonists induced cell death in Burkitt's lymphoma cells is variable and influenced by TLR9 polymorphism", "body": "CpG ODNs activate B cells by impacting on gene expression.21 We asked how the gene expression pattern of BL cells is affected by TLR9 triggering using CpG ODN. We performed a microarray analysis comparing ODN CpG-2006-treated versus untreated Akata cells. Most of the \u22652-fold changes in gene expression were upregulation and only few downregulation. Among upregulated genes, we were mainly interested in those involved in cytokine (human interleukin 10; hIL-10) and chemokine expression (CXCL10), B-cell activation (CD40), transcription (NF-\u03baB) and apoptosis (FAS) as these genes are those that preferentially determine cell proliferation and survival (Supplementary Table 1). Thirteen genes, including two regulating cell cycle, one transcription factor, one involved in B-cell differentiation and apoptosis, four of diverse functions and four of unknown function, showed downregulation following ODN CpG-2006 treatment (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nWe earlier confirmed that TLR9 triggering of Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006 increases hIL-10 expression and leads to the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus.16 To validate a marker for B-cell activation, in this context, we measured CD40 expression by flow cytometry. CD40 expression was increased upon ODN CpG-2006 treatment (Figure 1a). After 48 h, CD40 expression on ODN CpG-2006-treated cells was increased 2.7-fold compared with untreated cells (Figures 1a and b). Surprisingly, the control ODN GpC-2006, which is similar to ODN CpG-2006 but lacks the CpG motifs, also led to a 2.4-fold increase in CD40 expression (Figures 1a and b). This might reflect a TLR9-independent mechanism or the ability of the control ODN to stimulate TLR9 in BL cells.\n\nTo clarify this point, we used Akata cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the adaptor protein MyD88 (DN-MyD88).16 Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 induced increased CD40 expression, corroborating our first observation (Figure 1c). By contrast, neither ODN CpG-2006 nor ODN GpC-2006 significantly induced an increase in CD40 expression in DN-MyD88 Akata cells (Figure 1c). Finally, we validated the ODN CpG-2006 treatment-induced upregulation of STAT3 (Supplementary Table 1) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and confirmed activation of STAT3 by western blot (data not shown).\n\nCollectively, we validated our microarray data showing that triggering with ODN CpG-2006 activates Akata cells to induce CD40 and STAT3 expression. Moreover, our results indicated that both ODNs used here act in a MyD88-dependent manner and that the ODN lacking CpG motifs activates Akata cells to a similar extent as the ODN containing CpG motifs.\n\nTLR9 triggering leads to cell cycle entry and proliferation of B chronic lymphatic leukemia cells.11, 12, 22 We analyzed the cell cycle of mock-treated or ODN CpG-2006-treated Akata cells after initiation of treatment by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Most cells were in the S phase during the time frame of 48 h (Supplementary Figure 1). Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 did not alter the cell cycle compared with mock treatment. Similar results were obtained with Akata31 cells (data not shown), an EBV-negative subclone of Akata cells.23 Thus, although TLR9 triggering by ODN CpG-2006 resulted in BL-cell activation based on increased expression of certain genes, it did not seem to influence the cell cycle.\n\nTreatment with ODN GpC-2006 unexpectedly induced CD40 upregulation in Akata cells in a MyD88-dependent manner similar to treatment with ODN CpG-2006. We determined whether treatment with distinct TLR9 ligands would similarly result in a MyD88-dependent effect on cell survival. Also, we explored whether a class A ODN, that displays low specificity for B cells, exerts similar effects on BL cells as class B ODNs that possess a high specificity for B cells. Therefore, we treated Akata cells or DN-MyD88 Akata cells with ODN CpG-2216 (type A), ODN CpG-2006 (type B) and ODN GpC-2006 (type B control), respectively, and analyzed the viability of the cells by Trypan Blue exclusion assay and PE-Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining. The Trypan Blue exclusion assay showed that treatment of Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 reduced the survival of cells within 48 h to below 50% of not treated cells and treatment with ODN CpG-2216 to almost 50% of not treated cells after 72 h (Figure 2a). By contrast, the survival of DN-MyD88 Akata cells was not, if at all, reduced by treatment with any of the three ODNs for 72 h (Figure 2a). These findings were corroborated by the Annexin V/7-AAD assay revealing that the viability of Akata cells was drastically affected by treatment with class B ODNs and to a lesser extent with class A ODN, contrasting DN-MyD88 Akata cells that were not affected by treatment with ODNs for 72 h (Figure 2b and quantification in Figure 2c). Thus, treatment of Akata cells with ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006 triggers TLR9 signaling via MyD88 and results in cell death.\n\nTo explore the mechanism of ODN-induced cell death of Akata cells we set out to investigate whether caspases were involved. Thus, the activity of caspase-3 and -7 in ODN-treated Akata cells was detected using a luminogenic substrate, which gives rise to a luminescent signal proportional to caspase-3/7 activity. Triggering with TLR9 ligands for 48 h increased the luminescent signal about twofold as compared with no triggering. This increase was abolished by treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Figure 3a), indicating that TLR9 triggering resulted in increased caspase activity in Akata cells and that this activity was not increased if cells were concomitantly treated with a caspase inhibitor. These findings were corroborated using PI staining, which indicate that Akata cell death induced by treatment with ODNs can be abrogated by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (Figure 3b); and by western blotting showing that PARP cleavage is increased by ODN treatment and can be reduced by the inhibitor (Figure 3c). Thus, ODN-induced cell death of Akata cells was found to be caspase-3/7 dependent and therefore due to apoptosis.\n\nODN CpG-2006 suppresses EBV lytic gene expression in Akata cells and primary B cells promoting latent EBV that may provide cell survival signals.15, 16 As we observed Akata cell death upon TLR9 triggering, we asked whether the absence of EBV would result in even more pronounced cell death following TLR9 triggering. Hence, we tested whether TLR9 agonists affect the survival of EBV-positive Akata cells and of EBV-negative Akata31 cells in a similar fashion. Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 strongly decreased the percentages of surviving Akata cells or Akata 31 cells between 24 and 72 h compared with untreated cells. Nevertheless, the effect on Akata 31 cells was less marked (Figure 4a). The percentages of apoptotic Akata 31 cells assessed by Annexin V/7-AAD staining after 72 h of treatment, however, were comparable to those of Akata cells (Figure 4b). Treatment with ODN CpG-2216, ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 resulted in similar respective decreases in viability of Akata cells versus Akata31 cells due to apoptosis. Treatment with class A ODN CpG-2216 exhibited almost no negative impact on cell survival compared with treatment with the class B ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006 (Figure 4b). These results showed that EBV-negative Akata31 cells exhibited a higher level of spontaneous cell death by apoptosis compared with EBV-positive Akata cells and corroborated the lower effect of TLR9 triggering by class A ODN compared with triggering by class B ODNs. Moreover, the results suggested that the presence of EBV does not prevent EBV-positive Akata cells from TLR9 triggering-induced cell death compared with EBV-negative Akata31 cells.\n\nNext, we investigated whether our observations in EBV-positive versus EBV-negative BL cells hold true in BL cells other than Akata. To this end, we used EBV-positive BL cells Mutu-I and EBV-negative BL cells BJAB and Ramos. Treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or with ODN GpC-2006 did not affect Mutu-I cell or BJAB cell survival (Figure 4c) but it decreased Ramos cell survival between 48 and 72 h (Figure 4c). Thus, the survival of BL cells following TLR9 triggering considerably differs between distinct BL cells and does not seem to depend on the presence or absence of EBV.\n\nhIL-10 has an important role in B-cell lymphoma biology as it seems to act as autocrine growth factor.22, 24, 25, 26 We previously reported 16 and corroborate here, a strong hIL-10 induction in Akata cells following TLR9 triggering with ODN CpG-2006 (Supplementary Table 1). Nevertheless, the very same treatment resulted in drastic Akata cell death (Figure 2), suggesting that the latter could not be prevented by the induction of hIL-10 expression. Otherwise, a recent report suggested that treatment with ODN CpG-2006-induced hIL-10 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells mediating their cell death.10 Therefore, we treated Akata cells and DN-MyD88 Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006, recombinant hIL-10 (rhIL-10) or a combination thereof. The concentration of rhIL-10 was based on the peak hIL-10 protein concentration induced by ODN CpG-2006 treatment in Akata cells.16 Additionally, ODN CpG-2006 treatment was reiterated at 48 h in a fraction of BL cells.\n\nAs expected, treatment with ODN CpG-2006 for 72 h reduced the viability of Akata cells to <20% but did not reduce viability of DN-MyD88 Akata cells compared with no treatment (Figures 5a\u2013c). Reiterated treatment with ODN CpG-2006 after 48 h did not further reduce viability of Akata cells compared with one-time treatment and did not reduce viability of DN-MyD88 Akata cells (Figure 5a\u2013c). Treatment with rhIL-10 for 72 h also did not reduce viability of Akata cells or DN-MyD88 Akata cells compared with no treatment. Treatment with rhIL-10 did not counteract ODN CpG-2006 treatment-induced reduction of BL cell viability or further decreased their viability. DN-MyD88 Akata cells were not affected by any of the treatments (Figures 5a\u2013c). Thus, maximal negative impact of ODN CpG-2006 on cell survival in Akata cells occurred after one treatment. Moreover, rhIL-10 did not change the number of viable Akata cells, or rescue Akata cells from ODN CpG-2006 treatment-induced cell death. This suggested that hIL-10 cannot counteract TLR9 triggering-induced cell activation resulting in death of Akata cells and is not responsible for their cell death.\n\nThe distinct survival of BL cells following TLR9 triggering with ODN CpG could be because of distinct magnitudes of ensuing cellular responses. The induction of hIL-10 following ODN CpG treatment can be regarded as a surrogate marker for the magnitude of cell activation mediated by TLR9 triggering. Thus, we assessed hIL-10 mRNA expression in BL cells treated with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006. All five BL cell lines tested expressed hIL-10 mRNA following treatment with ODN CpG-2006, the values peaking preferentially at 6 h post treatment (Figure 6a). Peak hIL-10 mRNA expression levels varied from 1.3 transcripts over HMBS in Ramos BL cells to 48 transcripts in Mutu-I BL cells. Treatment with ODN GpC-2006 also resulted in induction of hIL-10 mRNA expression but in lower levels, except in Akata cells. Similar variation of results was observed when analyzing hIL-10 protein levels (Figure 6b). Thus, TLR9 triggering of distinct BL cells resulted in a broad range of hIL-10 mRNA and hIL-10 protein expression levels, and the magnitude of the level seemed independent of EBV status.\n\nNext, we determined TLR9 mRNA expression levels in BL cells by qRT-PCR. Although distinct BL cells showed up to sixfold different relative TLR9 mRNA expression levels (Figure 6c), ODN CpG-2006 treatment-induced hIL-10 mRNA peak expression levels did not correlate with the relative TLR9 mRNA expression levels (Figure 6d). Collectively, TLR9 triggering in distinct BL cells resulted in distinct hIL-10 mRNA expression, not linked to presence or absence of EBV, and not correlated to TLR9 mRNA expression levels.\n\nTLR9 polymorphisms in patients are linked to different outcomes of inflammatory diseases and the development of cancer.27, 28 We hypothesized that TLR9 polymorphisms could be a possible explanation for our observations. Thus, we isolated the genomic DNA from BL cell lines and analyzed it for the presence of TLR9 polymorphisms. We found specific SNPs for each cell line, allowing segregation of the BL cell lines into three groups (Table 1): \u22121237 TT/1635 GA (Akata and Akata 31), \u22121237 TT/1635 GG (Ramos) and \u22121237 TC/1635 GG (Mutu-I and BJAB). This sub-grouping correlated with the degree of BL-cell survival in response to ODN treatment (Figure 4c), suggesting that the distinct BL-cell responses to TLR 9 triggering may depend on the SNPs present.\n\nNext, we analyzed TLR9 SNPs in genomic DNA from primary BLs or blood from healthy individuals. Indeed, we found the TLR9 SNPs detected in our BL cell lines in primary BL samples and blood of healthy individuals (Table 2). Importantly, the TLR9 SNP frequencies were statistically not significantly different between BL cell lines, primary BLs and blood from healthy individuals, respectively. This suggested that if the direct response to TLR9 agonists depends on the TLR9 SNP, this could be an important factor regarding the treatment of BL patients by TLR9 triggering.\n\nWe analyzed the effects of TLR9 agonists on BL cell lines as an in vitro model for B-cell tumor. We found that treatment with TLR9 ligands induces distinct cytokine expression and cell death responses in distinct BL cells. Cell death was (i) dependent on TLR9-MyD88 signaling, (ii) occurred concomitantly with activation and could be suppressed by pan caspase inhibitors, (iii) was not dependent on the presence or absence of EBV in the tumor cells and (iv) was associated with SNPs in the TLR9 gene. Our results suggest that individualized in vitro pretesting of BL responses to CpG ODNs could help to predict the outcome of therapeutic TLR9 triggering and tailor adjuvant molecular treatment of BL.\n\nOur observation that BL cells of different origin show distinct cell survival following TLR9 triggering is novel. We previously demonstrated that TLR9 triggering counteracts lytic EBV reactivation in BL cells and promotes latent EBV that is associated with B-cell lymphoproliferation.16 Here, we observed CpG type B ODN-induced cell death by apoptosis in EBV-positive Akata and EBV-negative Akata31 cells, but not or to a much lower extent in the other EBV-positive or EBV-negative BL cell lines tested. Thus, the EBV status of the tumor cells does not rule the responses of BL cells to TLR9 triggering.\n\nTLR9-triggered BL cells consistently upregulated hIL-10 expression. hIL-10 influences the development and growth of B cells29 and acts as an autocrine growth factor for different B-cell lymphomas.25, 26, 30 Importantly, here, rhIL-10 did neither prevent nor enhance cell death induced by TLR9 triggering. hIL-10, as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, inhibits the Th1 immune response31 and this effect would be detrimental in cancer therapy that is based on intact or enhanced immune responses,9 as an unintended proliferation of the malignant cells could be provoked. Thus, the function of CpG type B ODN-induced hIL-10 expression in BL cells seems to considerably differ from that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells that were reported to undergo hIL-10-mediated apoptosis.10\n\nSurprisingly, ODN GpC-2006 induced cell death to the same extent as ODN CpG-2006. ODN GpC-2006 binds to TLR9, but in contrast to CpG-2006 it does not lead to TLR9 signaling in HEK293 cells or to changes in the secondary structure of the ectodomain.32 Therefore, we examined whether downstream signaling of TLR9 via MyD88 is involved in the induction of cell death. Indeed, experiments using Akata cells overexpressing a MyD88 dominant-negative mutant indicated that both ODNs induce cell death of BL cells in a MyD88-dependent manner. Others demonstrated that ODNs induce cell death independently of the CpG motif, of TLR933 or even of the whole-ODN sequence.34 Another pathway that is triggered by CpG ODNs, but is TLR9-independent, was described in monocytes and involves the activation of the Src family kinases Lyn and Hck.35 In our experiments, BL cell death induced by TLR9 triggering correlated with increased caspase activity and was caspase-dependent, thus most likely due to apoptosis.\n\nThe BL cell lines tested differed in their TLR9 mRNA expression level and TLR9 SNPs. mRNA expression did not correlate with cell death responses to TLR9 triggering, but the distinct TLR9 SNPs did. The role of TLR9 SNPs in BL is unknown. To start to investigate this we analyzed the frequencies of given SNPs in BL patients and healthy individuals and found them to be similar. A recent report suggests that the rs5743836 polymorphism, which was also detected here, confers an increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in people from Portugal and Italy but not from the United States.20 The association of the C allele rs5743836 with lack of cell death upon TLR9 triggering observed here in the Mutu-I and BJAB BL cell lines is striking. It does not allow establishing a causal link, but justifies the hypothesis that the distinct cell death responses upon CpG ODN treatment in BL cells may be linked to TLR9 SNPs. Notably, the C allele of rs5743836 exhibits greater NF-\u03baB-binding affinity because of an additional NF-\u03baB transcriptional binding site that may lead to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.36 Hence, the presence of the C allele seems to result in enhanced NF-\u03baB activation following TLR9 triggering. This may lead to protection of ODN CpG treatment-induced apoptosis that can be observed in BL cells without the C allele.\n\nIn conclusion, therapeutic TLR9 triggering appears to be a double-edge sword that may induce apoptosis, or enhance lymphoproliferation. Our findings suggest that the effect of TLR9 agonists on BL cells should be tested in vitro before installment of therapy and that TLR9 SNPs in BL patients should be evaluated as potential biological markers for the response to treatment targeting innate immunity.\n\nThe EBV-positive BL cell lines Akata and Mutu-I, and the EBV-negative BL cell lines Akata 31, BJAB and Ramos were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 mg/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml) and L-glutamine (2 mM). EBV-positive BL Akata cells expressing a dominant-negative MyD88 (DN-MyD88 Akata)16 were grown in the same medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Promega, Mannheim, Germany).\n\nBLs were retrieved from the database of the Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital of Zurich (PathoPro Software, Institute of Medical Software, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany). The BL diagnosis was performed according to the WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.37 DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded whole-tissue sections, according to standard procedures. This study was in accordance with Swiss laws and approved by the official authorities of the ethical committee of the Canton of Zurich (StV2-2007). Peripheral blood was collected from 402 healthy blood donors (aged 19\u201370 years) who were randomly selected according to the criteria of the Swiss Red Cross.38\n\nWhole-genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping of the TLR9 polymorphisms \u20131237 T/C (rs5743836) and 2848 G/A (rs352140) was done by tetra-primer assays as previously described.39\n\nCells were split to a density of 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. The TLR9 ligands ODN CpG-2216 (type A), ODN CpG-2006 (type B) and ODN GpC-2006 (type B control) were applied at concentrations of 0.5 \u03bcM. ODN (LabForce-InvivoGen, Nunningen, Switzerland) sequences: ODN CpG-2216: 5\u2032-ggGGGACGATCGTCgggggg-3\u2032, bases are phosphodiester (capital letters) or phosphorothioate (lower case); ODN CpG-2006: 5\u2032-tcgtcgttttgtcgttttgtcgtt-3\u2032, full phosphorothioate backbone; ODN GpC-2006: 5\u2032-tgctgcttttgtgcttttgtgctt-3\u2032, full phosphorothioate backbone.\n\nAkata cells were mock treated or treated with CpG-2006, and harvested 6 h later. Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray analysis was performed at the Functional Genomic Center Zurich (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland). Human Exon 1.0 ST Array chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Genespring GX software (Agilent Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) were used for the analysis. An at least twofold change in gene expression (upregulation or downregulation) in the treated versus the mock-treated sample was regarded as significant.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from 106 cells with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and DNA was removed with DNA-free (Ambion Europe, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK). 1 \u03bcg of the purified RNA was used to generate cDNA with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with specific Taqman primers and probes on ABI 7200 (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed with the software SDS2.2 (Applied Biosystems). Delta cycle threshold (Ct) values for the respective genes were normalized to HMBS.\n\n105 cells were stained with FITC mouse anti-human IgM (Clone G20-127), PE-Cy5 mouse anti-human IgG (Clone G18-145), PE mouse anti-human IgD (Clone IA6-2) or the respective isotype controls, FITC IgG1\u03ba isotype control (Clone MOPC-21), PE-Cy5 mouse IgG1\u03ba isotype control (Clone MOPC-21), PE mouse IgG2a\u03ba isotype control (Clone G155-178) or PE-Cy5 anti-human CD40 (Cat. 555590) (all from BD Biosciences, Allschwil, Switzerland) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. Cells were counted with a flow cytometer (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences).\n\nTo assess apoptotic, necrotic or dead and viable cells, 105 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl Annexin V binding buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated with 5 \u03bcl Annexin V and 5 \u03bcl 7-AAD (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After addition of 200 \u03bcl Annexin V binding buffer, cells were analyzed with the FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).\n\nTo discern between dead and viable cells, treated cells were stained with 50 \u03bcg/ml PI (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) for 15 min at room temperature and then analyzed with the FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).\n\nTotal protein lysates were obtained after lysing the cells in RIPA complete buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP40 complemented with 0.1% SDS, 1 \u00d7 EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland)). Cell extracts were passed 10 times through a 25-G syringe. Protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoScientific, Erembodegem, Belgium), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To analyze protein expression by western blot, protein (20 \u03bcg/well) was loaded into a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (life technologies, Zug, Switzerland) and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Glattbrugg, Switzerland), incubated with rabbit anti-PARP antibody or rabbit anti-\u03b2-Actin antibody, and subsequently with anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody (all diluted 1:1000 and from, Cell Signaling Technology (Allschwil, Switzerland). The signal was detected with the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) and imaged using the LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Dielsdorf, Switzerland) and image reader LA-3000 (Fujifilm).\n\nhIL-10 protein concentrations were determined in supernatants from TLR9-stimulated cultures by standard capture ELISA (Ready-SET-Go, eBioscience, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions Plates were read at 450 nm once the substrate had developed, and cytokine concentration was determined by extrapolation from the standard curve.\n\nActivity of caspase-3/7 was assessed with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Wallisellen, Switzerland). Cells, dispensed at 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml/well in a 24-well plate were treated with TLR9 ligands and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. At the end of the incubation period, 100 \u03bcl of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent was added to 100 \u03bcl cell suspension in a white-walled 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Luminescence intensity was determined using a Synergy HT Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (BioTek, Luzern, Switzerland).\n\nOne day before the experiment, the cells were split to a density of 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. The next day, 106 cells were incubated with 900 pg rhIL-10/ml (Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany) for the indicated time points. This concentration corresponds to the hIL-10 protein concentration induced by ODN CpG-2006 in Akata cells.16"}
