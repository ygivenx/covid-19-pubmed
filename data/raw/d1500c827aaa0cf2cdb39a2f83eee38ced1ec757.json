Elevated progesterone, in turn, stimulates excessive growth hormone secretion of mammary origin. In cats, acromegaly is caused by a pituitary adenoma, usually a macroadenoma, which secretes excessive amounts of growth hormone. Physical changes are less pronounced in cats than in dogs. \n\nLymphocytic/plasmacytic gastritis (inflammatory reaction to a variety of antigens such as Helicobacter spp. or Physaloptera rara) Eosinophilic gastritis (allergic reactions to food antigens) Granulomatous gastritis (e.g., Ollulanus tricuspis) Atrophic gastritis \n\nImmune-mediated thrombocytopenia\n\nImmune-mediated neutropenia\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nMyasthenia gravis\n\nAntinuclear Antibody\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\nAntibody-complement deposition\n\nErosive Immune-Mediated Arthritides\n\nPeriosteal proliferative polyarthritis (cat, rarely in dog) \n\nFound worldwide, more common in southern United States, most common in cats Common clinical signs include upper respiratory signs, unilateral to bilateral nasal discharge, soft masses in nasal cavity or over bridge of nose, ulcerative skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, granulomatous chorioretinitis, and retinal detachment. Less common signs include fever, lung involvement, CNS involvement caused by invasion through cribriform plate, depression, seizures, circling, ataxia, blindness, head pressing, and paresis.\n\nDogs affected more often than cats Nasal turbinate destruction, frontal sinus osteomyelitis, mucoid to hemorrhagic nasal discharge, epistaxis May lead to masticatory muscle atrophy and CNS disease by erosion through cribriform plate In rare cases, disseminates and causes multiple-organ disease\n\nSevere, often fatal, chronic gastrointestinal and cutaneous diseases\n\nNasopharyngeal involvement, poorly responsive to therapy\n\nMultisystemic granulomatous, neoplastic, and immunemediated diseases must be differentiated from disseminated systemic mycoses. \n\nMay be asymptomatic or fulminant disease Anorexia, lethargy, fever, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, myocarditis (rare) Worse in very young and parasitized puppies Neutropenia, hypoalbuminemia, severe dehydration, secondary septicemia\n\nDiarrhea (infrequently blood in feces), vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, often self-limiting Canine respiratory coronavirus, part of \"kennel cough\" complex Coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge Canine pancytotropic coronavirus Severe clinical disease in puppies and juvenile dogs Fever, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, ataxia, seizures\n\nVomiting, diarrhea (rarely bloody), anorexia, typically recover after 5-7 days\n\nFever, anorexia, lethargy, depression, abdominal pain, pale mucous membranes, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, coughing, hepatomegaly Severe cases: coagulation abnormalities, petechiae, ecchymosis, DIC, rarely icterus, hepatic encephalopathy Anterior uveitis and glomerulonephritis secondary to immune complex deposition\n\nAcute onset of coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, ocular discharge Lowgrade fever Secondary commensal bacterial infections leading to mucopurulent discharge and productive cough May lead to pneumonia with high fever, inappetence, productive cough, and increased respiratory effort\n\nVariable incubation period, prodromal phase: nervousness, anxiety, paresthesia Progress to forebrain signs (\"furious\" form of rabies):\n\nirritability, restlessness, pica, photophobia, increased saliva production with decreasing ability to swallow, hyperesthesia progressing to incoordination, seizures, and death May also progress to \"dumb\" form: paralysis, lower motor disease, leading to coma, respiratory paralysis, and death\n\nSuspected to be result from ingestion of infected raw pork Neurologic dysfunction: ataxia, abnormal papillary light response, restlessness, trismus, cervical rigidity, ptyalism, tachypnea, excoriation from pruritus of head and neck; vomiting, diarrhea; most dogs die within 48 hours\n\nHacking cough with gagging, easily elicited with tracheal palpation; cough may be paroxysmal, usually subsides within 7-10 days, and may lead to secondary bacterial or mycoplasmal infection\n\nAbortion, stillbirths; puppies born live progress to crying, hypothermia, soft stools, petechiae, cessation of nursing, and death Older puppies develop mild respiratory signs that may emerge later as neurologic disease (ataxia, blindness, central vestibular disease).

Cranial nerve signs such as anisocoria, pupil dysfunction, facial or tongue paresis, and changes in phonation may occur. \u2022 Auditory, visual, or tactile stimulation may elicit profound aggression to self-mutilation. \u2022 Become profoundly moribund to comatose to death.\n\n100% fatal\n\nPurebred cats from cattery Multicat households Younger than 5 years or older than 10 years of age \n\nLow-grade fever Lymphadenopathy Neutropenia\n\nNo clinical signs for months to years \n\nPure red cell aplasia Regenerative anemia (less common and often associated with coinfection with Mycoplasma haemofelis) Myeloproliferative disease (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)\n\nRenal failure Urinary incontinence: sphincter incompetence or detrusor hyperactivity\n\nAqueous flare, mass lesions, keratitic precipitates, lens luxations, glaucoma, anterior uveitis\n\nAnisocoria, ataxia, weakness, tetraparesis, paraparesis, behavioral changes, urinary incontinence Secondary infection with FIP, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans\n\nAbortion, stillbirth, infertility, kitten mortality complex (\"fading kitten\" syndrome)\n\nNeutrophilic polyarthritis secondary to immune complex deposition Multiple cartilaginous exostoses\n\nViral replication in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow, spread to mucosal and glandular tissues, leading to shedding of virus. Most cats become persistently infected and frequently die of an FeLV-associated disease within a few years.\n\nEffective immune response limits viral replication. FeLV antigen detectable in peripheral blood within 2-3 weeks after exposure but disappears 2-8 weeks later. May not ever develop antigenemia. Clinical relevance of regressive infection is not clear.

Reduction is a poor prognostic indicator in cats but no prognostic significance in dogs. May be caused by saponification in peripancreatic fat and glucagon release stimulating calcitonin \u2022 Chloride-Very commonly decreased in dogs. Loss in gastrointestinal secretions in vomiting \u2022 Phosphate-Often increased in dogs, uncommonly increased or decreased in cats. Increase usually due to reduced renal excretion secondary to renal compromise. Decrease (in cats) due to treatment for diabetes mellitus \u2022 Glucose-increased in 40-88% of dogs and decreased in up to 40%. Increased in 64% of cats, rarely decreased. Increase due to decreased insulin and increased glucagon, cortisol, and catecholamines. Decrease caused by sepsis or anorexia \u2022 Albumin-Increased in 39-50% and decreased in 17% of dogs.\n\nIncreased in 8-30% and decreased in 40% of cats. Increase due to dehydration.

Unclear if cause or effect \u2022 Neutrophils-Increased in 55-60% of dogs, increased in 30% and decreased in 15% of cats. Increased due to inflammatory response. Decreased in some cats due to consumption, may be a poor prognostic indicator \u2022 Hematocrit-Increased in about 20% and decreased in 20% of both dogs and cats. Increased due to dehydration and decreased due to anemia of chronic disease or gastric ulceration \u2022 Platelets-Commonly decreased in severe cases in dogs.\n\nDecreased due to circulating proteases +/\u2212 disseminated intravascular coagulation \n\nMost severely affects tissues with a growth fraction that approaches that of tumor cells\n\nNeutropenia: short-lived cells; nadir is 5-10 days postchemotherapy Thrombocytopenia: nadir is 7-14 days postchemotherapy Anemia: erythrocytes live longer; rarely clinically significant\n\nNausea, vomiting Diarrhea Inappetence Anorexia\n\nDoxorubicin therapy Breeds susceptible to dilated cardiomyopathy (e.g., Doberman) most sensitive Most likely after cumulative dose of 180 mg/m 2\n\nCisplatin, streptozotocin Limit use of cisplatin in cases of preexisting renal disease.\n\nIrreversible hepatic toxicity may result if lomustine (CCNU) given in face of elevated ALT\n\nSterile hemorrhagic cystitis Cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide\n\nDoxorubicin: severe local reaction leading to slough Vincristine: usually minor tissue damage\n\nDoxorubicin: caused by histamine release from mast cells; prevented by slow administration L-Asparaginase: less likely if given subcutaneously rather than intravenously Etoposide, paclitaxel: caused by carrier solutions for these agents\n\nLess of a problem in dogs and cats than in people Worse in breeds that have hair (e.g., Poodles, Terriers, Old English Sheepdogs) than in dogs with fur Loss of \"feathers\" (e.g., Golden Retrievers) Loss of whiskers in cats\n\nFatal neurotoxicity in cats with topical or systemic administration of 5-fluorouracil\n\nFatal, acute pulmonary edema in cats with cisplatin therapy \n\nMay be difficult to differentiate from lymphoproliferative, granulomatous, or reactive inflammatory disease by histopathology alone\n\nBenign, usually solitary lesion Typically young dogs Often spontaneously regress\n\nRare, rapidly metastatic, cutaneous infiltration by histiocytes, may be limited to multiple cutaneous sites or may affect lymph nodes and internal organs\n\nSingle or multiple lesions May spontaneously regress May respond to immunosuppressive drugs\n\nFamilial disease of Bernese Mountain Dogs, rarely other breeds Similar lesions to cutaneous histiocytosis but may also affect mucous membranes, lymphoid organs, lung, bone marrow, and other organ systems Progressive, requires immunosuppressive therapy\n\nBernese Mountain Dog, Rottweiler, Flat-Coated Retriever, Golden Retriever, rarely other breeds Histiocytic sarcoma usually begins as a localized lesion in spleen, lymph nodes, lung, bone marrow, skin and subcutis, brain, and periarticular tissue of appendicular joints. \u2022 Rapidly disseminates to multiple organs\n\nBernese Mountain Dog, Rottweiler, Flat-Coated Retriever, Golden Retriever, rarely other breeds Multisystemic, rapidly progressive disease of multiple organs\n\nRare, usually see multiple skin nodules, papules, plaques Head, lower extremities, trunk Poor long-term prognosis\n\nPoorly demarcated tumors of subcutis or spleen Poor prognosis \n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (in cats, often associated with FeLV infection) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\nAcute myelogenous leukemia (myeloblastic) Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (myeloblasts/ monoblasts) Acute monocytic leukemia (monoblasts) Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (megakaryoblasts) Erythroleukemia (erythroblasts)\n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (neutrophils, late precursors) Primary thrombocythemia (platelets) Basophilic leukemia (basophils and precursors) Eosinophic leukemia (eosinophils and precursors) Polycythemia vera (erythrocytes) Loss of ability to smell\n\nLoss of vision, loss of menace response, dilated pupil, loss of papillary light reflex (direct and consensual)\n\nLoss of papillary light reflex on affected side (even if light shone in opposite eye), dilated pupil, ptosis, ventrolateral strabismus\n\nSlight dorsomedial eye rotation\n\nAtrophy of temporalis and masseter muscles, loss of jaw tone and strength, dropped jaw (if bilateral), analgesia of innervated areas\n\nMedial strabismus, impaired lateral gaze, poor retraction of globe\n\nLip, eyelid, and ear droop; loss of ability to blink; loss of ability to retract lip; possibly decreased tear production\n\nAtaxia, head tilt, nystagmus, deafness, positional strabismus\n\nLoss of gag reflex, dysphagia\n\nLoss of gag reflex, laryngeal paralysis, dysphagia, megaesophagus\n\nAtrophy of trapezius, sternocephalicus, and brachiocephalicus muscles\n\nLoss of tongue strength, inability to retract tongue if bilateral, atrophy of tongue Head tilt to side of lesion Circling/falling/rolling to side of lesion Vomiting, salivation Incoordination Ventral strabismus on side of lesion (\u00b1) Nystagmus, fast phase away from lesion Nystagmus may intensify with changes in body position.\n\nNystagmus is horizontal or rotatory.

Corneal lipidosis appears similar; it may be secondary to hyperlipidemia from hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypertriglyceridemia.\n\nMost cases are caused by lymphoplasmacytic dacryoadenitis. Rarely seen with xerostomia (Sj\u00f6gren-like syndrome) Possible causes include drug therapy, atropine, sulfa drugs, etodolac, and anesthetic agents. Others causes include canine distemper, FHV-1, and dysautonomia. \n\nMost often secondary to severe intraocular disease (uveitis) May be primary in terriers\n\nUsually affected by diseases that extend from the uveal tract (see previous section) or from central nervous system (immune-mediated diseases such as granulomatous meningoencephalitis or neoplasia of CNS).\n\nOptic nerve edema without hemorrhage, exudates, or blindness Seen with increased intracranial pressure\n\nRetinal degeneration May also cause dilated cardiomyopathy\n\nAllows assessment of systemic condition including anemia (attenuated, pale vessels), hyperlipidemia (creamy orange hue to vessels), hyperviscosity (increased vessel tortuosity) \n\nEaster lily (Lilium longiflorum) and daylily (Hemerocallis spp.), possibly other lilies: toxic to cats, vomiting, depression, anorexia, leading to acute renal failure, poor prognosis without early treatment Raisins/grapes: acute renal failure\n\nSeeds of many fruit trees (apple, apricot, cherry, peach, plum), contain cyanogenic glycosides\n\nEnzymatic and nonenzymatic proteins, local tissue damage: localized pain, salivation, weakness, fasciculations, hypotension, alterations in respiratory pattern, regional lymphadenopathy, mucosal bleeding, obtundation, convulsions, anemia, echinocytosis, stress leukogram\n\nRare envenomation, signs delayed 10-18 hours, emesis, salivation, agitation, central depression, quadriplegia, hyporeflexia, intravascular hemolysis, respiratory paralysis\n\nHyperesthesia, muscle fasciculations, cramping, somatic abdominal pain (characteristic sign), respiratory compromise, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, agitation, ataxia, cardiopulmonary collapse\n\nCutaneous form: bull's-eye lesion, pale center with localized thrombosis, surrounded by erythema, develops into a hemorrhagic bulla with underlying eschar Viscerocutaneous form: Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\n\nDermacentor and Haemaphysalis ticks, ascending paralysis, lower motor neuron signs, megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia in severe cases, spontaneous recovery a few days after tick removal\n\nBites and stings of winged insects and fire ants Toxic and allergic reactions (localized angioedema, urticaria, emesis, diarrhea, hematochezia, respiratory depression, death)\n\nSalivation, lacrimation, emesis, tachypnea, respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, shock rectum should be bilaterally symmetric, have a smooth and regular surface, have soft parenchyma, and not be painful to touch. \u2022 Radiography of limited value for providing an actual diagnosis but may provide information about size, shape, contour, and location of the prostate. Prostatomegaly may cause dorsal displacement of the colon and cranial displacement of the urinary bladder. Mineralization with neoplasia, bacterial prostatitis, and abscessation may be apparent. \u2022 Prostatic ultrasound is the most useful and practical imaging method. Normal prostate should have smooth borders and homogenous parenchymal pattern of moderate echogenicity. Ultrasound also offers the opportunity for guided aspirates and core biopsy sampling for culture, cytology, and histopathology. \u2022 CT and MRI can evaluate size, shape, homogeneity of prostate and allow evaluation of intrapelvic lesions, metastatic spread, and ureteral obstruction. \u2022 Definitive diagnosis requires cytologic, histologic, or bacteriologic evaluation of a prostate sample. Samples can be obtained using procedures such as semen collection, prostatic massage and wash, brush technique, fine needle aspiration, and biopsy. "}
