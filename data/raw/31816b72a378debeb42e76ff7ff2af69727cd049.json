By March 6, 2020, 80,714 cases were laboratory confirmed and 3045 were death in China based on CCDC reported. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus widely distributed in humans, other mammals and birds that cause respiratory, intestinal, liver and neurological diseases [2, 3] .

Common symptoms in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, and in more severe cases, infection can lead to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome [4, 5] . The known routes of coronavirus disease-19 transmission are respiratory droplets and contact transmission, while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission require further clarification [6] .\n\nFor SARS-CoV-2 infection, early diagnosis is particularly important, not only to prolong the survival of patients, but also to ensure the safety of the population [7] . In clinical practice, the detection methods have been rapidly updated due to the deepening understanding of COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing, chest CT, confirmation of epidemiological history and clinical manifestations are important bases for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, nucleic acid testing has operator restrictions, time-consuming, easy to pollution and the high cost. In comparison, the coronavirus antigen detection method has the advantages of rapid, convenient and the SARS-CoV antigen can be detected up to 1 day before appearance of clinical symptoms [11] .\n\nIn clinical practice, nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnostic for suspected acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\n\ninfections, but the use of SARS-CoV-2 antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected people. Therefore, detection of viral antigen can play a rapid screening effect and achieve the purpose of early diagnosis. Here, we report a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples and urine within 10 minutes, and evaluated its significance in diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nStudy design A total of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers, including General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan N0.7 People's Hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital\uff0cHubei Maternal and Child All rights reserved.

With the help of the capillarity of the absorbent pad, sample buffer containing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein could be combined by III-conjugated M4 antibody and captured by M1 antibody at the test line, while III-conjugated rabbit IgG could be captured on the control line, resulting in a fluorescent band on the test and control lines, respectively. The fluorescent results will then be read by the immunofluorescence analyzer. Cut-off value was determined by testing 100 nasal swab samples of healthy people and calculated as the mean value of the fluorescence signal plus 5 SD.\n\nNucleocapsid protein detection procedure Nasopharyngeal swab samples or urine were diluted and mixed well with 500\u03bcl saline solution, 100\u03bcl of which was then added to the sample well of the test card.

All participants underwent 3 nucleic acid tests, and the results of each nucleic acid test were verified by 2 COVID-19 nucleic acid test kits. As shown in Fig 2A, \n\nWe performed nucleocapsid protein (N antigen) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with nucleic acid test in multiple centers.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , among the 208 patients with COVID-19 nucleic acid positive results, 141 were SARS-CoV-2 N antigen positive, with a sensitivity of 68%.\n\nMeanwhile, among the 31 patients with COVID-19 nucleic acid negative results, 31 were N antigen negative, with a specificity of 100%. In order to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of antigen detection methods from a clinical perspective, our study selected CT value \u226440 and \u226430 (Higher virus titer) as the nucleic acid positive group while CT value > 40 was used as the nucleic acid negative group. The results showed the positive coincidence rate (sensitivity) was 68%, the negative coincidence rate (specificity) was 100%,and the total coincidence rate (accuracy) was 72% when CT value\u226440 as nucleic acid positive group while CT value > 40 as nucleic acid negative group (Fig3A). In addition, positive coincidence rate (sensitivity) was 98%, the negative coincidence rate (specificity) was 100%, and the total coincidence rate (accuracy) was 99% when CT value\u2264 30 as nucleic acid positive group while CT value > 40 as nucleic acid negative group (Fig3B). It is of noteworthy that in this study cohort the earliest patient with fever in 3 days were identified by N antigen detection.\n\nWe performed N antigen detection of SARS-CoV-2 in urine in one in parallel with All rights reserved.

It is interesting that 14 of 19 (73.6%) participants with diagnosed COVID-19 were detected N antigen in urine (Table 1 ).\n\nThe current epidemic situation of COVID-19 still remains severe and it quickly spreads all over China and to more than 20 other countries. Early diagnosis is critical to prevent its spreading and clinical treatment. In practice, nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnostic for suspected SARS-CoV-2\n\ninfections, but the use of novel coronavirus antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Now, the virus (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its high detection rate [12] . However, nucleic acid test results are sometimes unstable and take too long, or can appear false negative and false positive. Moreover, IgM and IgG antibody detection method have been used in diagnosing with a relative higher positive rate [13] . However, virus-specific antibody usually produced in 2-4 weeks after infection.\n\nTheoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected people. In our previous study in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), test of the N antigen of SARS-CoV achieved a sensitivity of 94% and 78% for the first 5 days and 6-10 days after onset, respectively. This pointed out that antigen detection has a high true positive rate and false negative rate, which can be used as an early diagnostic marker for SARS before 1 day clinical onset [11] . Other authors also indicate N antigen of SARS-CoV has a high sensitivity rate in early stage of SARS, which could be useful for early diagnosis of SARS [14] , indicate antigen detection can play an important role in the early diagnosis. Therefore, detection of viral antigen can play a rapid screening effect and achieve the purpose of early diagnosis.\n\nHere, we report a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples and urine within 10 minutes, and evaluated it's significance in diagnosis.

However, N antigen detection achieved a sensitivity of 100%, which greatly reduced the false positive rate of nucleic acid detection. More importantly, the earliest patient after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. Those findings indicate that our N antigen assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple diagnosis method of COVID-19. It implies that this N antigen detection method not only guarantee early diagnosis in hospitals, and can also be used large-scale screening in community.\n\nIn an additional preliminary study, it is revealed that 73.6% of diagnosed patients with nucleic acid assay in nasopharyngeal swab detected nucleocapsid antigen in urine in same day. This coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and test of N antigen in urine might be of diagnostic value [15] . the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524 doi: medRxiv preprint All rights reserved.
