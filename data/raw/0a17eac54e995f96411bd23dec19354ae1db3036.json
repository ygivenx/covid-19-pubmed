{"title": "Structure, Properties, and Biological Relevance of the DNA and RNA G Quadruplexes: Overview 50 Years after Their Discovery", "body": "The non canonical DNA structures formed by con formational rearrangement of the double stranded genome regions with specific base sequences are current ly considered as a novel set of regulatory elements. Four stranded G rich helical structures called the G quadru plexes (G4s) are among the most amazing and actively investigated non canonical forms of DNA. G quadru plexes discovered more than half a century ago as a curi ous phenomenon of guanosine gel formation now are perceived in the scientific mind as an important structur al element of the genome. Currently, G4 formed by RNA molecules have become the subject of intensive studies [1, 2] .\n\nNucleic acid sequences forming G4 (G4 motifs) have been found in G rich repeats of eukaryotic genomes such as telomeric DNA, micro and minisatel lite sequences, as well as in regulatory regions of genomes, specifically in oncogene promoters. Data have been obtained by novel experimental approaches indi cating that G4 play an important role in regulation of key cellular processes [3, 4] , such as replication [5, 6] , chromosome end protection [7] , transcription [8] , mutagenesis [9] , genome damage repair [10] , DNA recombination [11] , and epigenetic processes [12, 13] , as well as posttranscriptional events: translation [14] , RNA splicing, alternative polyadenylation of mRNA [15] , and others.\n\nMany reviews and even books have been dedicated to the different aspects of G4 formation, their topology, fac tors affecting stability and polymorphism of these struc tures, and interaction of G4s with small molecule ligands [3, 16 18 ]. However, the number of publications examin ing these non canonical forms of nucleic acids has grown steadily in the last decade, which has been related mainly with progress in investigation of their biological func tions. Interest in G4s is also because their formation is associated with widespread human diseases (cancer, car diovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative disor ders) [19, 20] . In recent years, G4s have been actively used as components of nanostructures and low cost switches that offer promise for applications in nanotech nology and biology [21 23 ].\n\nUnlike in previous review articles that considered specific issues related to G4s, in this review we summarize all aspects of the quadruplex studies. Data from recent papers that significantly change our notions on the struc tural polymorphism, thermodynamics and kinetics of G4 folding-unfolding, as well as factors affecting the equilib rium between DNA duplexes and non canonical four stranded DNAs, and the structural arrangement of multi quadruplexes are analyzed. In addition to these aspects, new information on the structure and stability of G4s in telomeric DNA and oncogene promoters, and on confor mational features of RNA G4 and of hybrid DNA-RNA quadruplexes is reviewed. Also we summarized data on various classes of ligands recognizing G quadruplexes, on G4 specific proteins and antibodies, and on the existence of G4s in vivo. In this review, we present the current state of nucleic acid G quadruplex science including a short history of the development of our notions on their struc ture and properties. Special attention was paid to novel experimental approaches that provided the breakthrough in investigation of G quadruplexes and their visualization in biological objects.\n\nG4s are formed via intra or intermolecular inter actions of DNA or RNA molecules containing tracts of oligoG (G tracts). The central part of a quadruplex (core) consists of G tetrads, in which four guanine residues from different strands or different G tracts (in the case of intramolecular G4) are linked through a sys tem of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (more precisely H bonds formed with participation of Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen faces of guanine bases). Stacking interac tions of planar G tetrads as well as additional interac tions of sugar phosphate backbone fragments [24] form the specific G4 structure (Fig. 1 ). It should be men tioned that the quadruplex like structures are formed even during self association of guanosine monophos phates. This is related with the specific properties of guanine residues, which have several mutually corre sponding electron donor and electron acceptor centers and exhibit enhanced capability for stacking interac tions. In in vitro studies, G quadruplexes were formed by intermolecular interactions of two, three, or four oligonu cleotide molecules containing G tracts, as well as by intramolecular folding of one oligonucleotide molecule (Fig. 1a) . A base sequence capable of intramolecular fold ing into a G4 is usually denoted as G 2 5 L 1 G 2 5 L 2 G 2 5 L 3 G 2 5 , where G 2 5 are G tracts containing from two to five con secutive guanosine residues, and L n are oligonucleotide linkers connecting these tracts. Until recently, the quadru plex core was considered as several right handed G tetrads [16] . Only in 2015, a left handed G quadruplex analog of Z DNA was discovered using X ray analysis and NMR spectroscopy, which was formed during intramole cular folding of the d(T(GGT) 4 TG(TGG) 3 TGTT) oligonucleotide under near physiological conditions [25] .\n\nConsiderable structural diversity is characteristic for DNA G4s due to such factors as the number of forming molecules, length of G tracts, mutual orientation of strands, base sequence (composition) and length of G4 loops, availability of oligonucleotide fragments flanking the G4 motif, type of cations in the medium, and others [26] . G4s can adopt manifold topologies characterized by different orientation of the four strands in the quadruplex stem. The structure is parallel if all the strands point in the same direction. In antiparallel G4 two of the four strands point in the same direction (two types are identified -\"chair\" and \"basket\" differing in the type of loops), and in mixed antiparallel-parallel (3 + 1) G4 three strands have the same orientation (Fig. 1a) . Classification of DNA G quadruplexes on the basis of the quadruplex twist angles is presented in [27] . Despite the fact that loops do not involve in G tetrad formation, they play a key role in the overall folding and stability of G4; quadru plex loops represent elements of secondary structure and are the main sources of tensions and limitations in the quadruplex structure. Three types of loops are character istic for G4s (Fig. 1c) : propeller (double chair reversal) ones connecting G tracts forming neighboring edges of the four stranded core (arbitrarily they can be defined as loops connecting \"upper\" and \"lower\" G tetrads); no inversion of the nucleic acid chain direction occurs in this case; lateral (side) loops connecting neighboring G tracts (change of the chain direction occurs); diagonal loops connecting G tracts forming opposite edges of the G quadruplex (change of the chain direction occurs). Formation of one type of loop or another depends on the number of G tetrads, number of nucleotide units between the G tracts, and their composition, and it is directly related to the strand orientation in the quadruplex.\n\nSpecific coordination of mono and bivalent cations inside the G4 as a stabilizing factor of such non canonical structures of nucleic acids. Considering that G quadru plexes are formed due to association of four poly(oligo)anions, electrostatic interactions are their main stabilizing factor. However, the ions concentrated around the G quadruplex helix that neutralize the charges of phosphate groups in the sugar phosphate backbone contribute only slightly to G4 formation [28] . Unlike other types of structured nucleic acids, G4 specif ically bind (coordinate) ions of mono and bivalent met als within the highly electronegative central channel along the axis of the G4 stem [29] ; the cations lose their hydration shell in the process. That is why the ionic radius is a significant factor ensuring the ability of ions to stabi lize quadruplexes. Information on location of cations inside the G quadruplex structure and on the dynamics of their binding to DNA was obtained with the NMR spec troscopy and X ray study. The mechanism of a cation migration into the G4 core was elucidated using molecu lar dynamics simulation; it was shown that migration occurs predominately via the terminal G tetrads, and the quadruplex loops affect the process. Location of internal cations depends on their size and charge. The distance between the electronegative oxo groups of guanine residues in the G tetrad decreases when a cation enters the quadruplex channel, due to electrostatic attraction, which prevents the release of cation into bulk solution [30] .\n\nAmong monovalent cations, the maximum stabiliz ing effect has been observed for K + , which is located between two consecutive G tetrads forming eight coordi nation bonds with the guanine carbonyl groups (Fig. 1b) . The spaces between the lateral or diagonal loops of the quadruplex and the terminal G tetrad are alternative sites for binding potassium ions [30] . Sodium ions, which usu ally localize in the tetrad plane and form four coordina tion bonds with the guanine residues, exhibit less pro nounced stabilizing effect [31] . In addition to the ionic radius, the difference in the hydration free energy of the ions is suggested as an explanation for the different effect of K + and Na + on the G4 stability.\n\nAmmonium ions were used as NMR probes for iden tification of coordination sites of monovalent ions with DNA. It was shown that NH 4 + could be localized inside the quadruplex between neighboring G tetrads the same as potassium ions [32] . According to other data [33] , ammo nium ions are too large to be embedded into the inner cav ity of the quadruplex without partial opening of G tetrads. Hence, the type of binding of these ions with G4 depends on the rigidity of the four stranded structure defined by the temperature, and it is controlled by steric limitations of G tetrads and the structure of the loops [33] . It was shown using NMR spectroscopy that thallium and rubidium ions are coordinated within the G quadruplex structure like K + . Thermodynamic stability of G4 increases with increasing concentration of monovalent ions in the medi um [34, 35] . It must be noted that Li + and Cs + ions have practically no stabilizing effect on the four stranded DNA structure because their ionic radius either prevents their entry into the quadruplex channel or (if it is too small) remaining there by forming coordination bonds with the guanine residues [28] . As recently shown, increasing the concentration of ions that do not stabilize quadruplexes (Cs + or trimethylammonium ion) at constant concentra tion of K + could result in collapse of G4; this effect was not observed for any other DNA structure [35] .\n\nIons of bivalent metals also affect the stability and conformation transitions between different forms of G4. Some of them (Ba 2+ , Sr 2+ ) have sizes that allow entering the central quadruplex cavity [36] and stabilizing G4 sig nificantly more strongly than monovalent ions. For example, the binding constant of intramolecular antipar allel G4 with barium cation is 10 fold higher than with the potassium cation [30, 37] . The pronounced stabilizing ability of strontium ions has been explained by their strong interaction with the guanine carbonyl groups and effective screening of the phosphate group charges [38] . Bivalent lead ions also stabilize quadruplexes efficiently because, as shown by X ray analysis, they are located between the planes of neighboring G tetrads and can replace K + and Na + in the quadruplex structure. Ca 2+ and Na + can coexist in the G4 core, exchanging their posi tions easily because their ionic radii are similar. The dependence of the G quadruplex stabilizing ability of bivalent metal ions on concentration is bell shaped: 2 5 mM salt solutions initiate G4 formation, while when concentrations are above 10 mM in combination with elevated temperature, some ions (Ca 2+ , Co 2+ , Mn 2+ , Zn 2+ , Ni 2+ , and Mg 2+ ) can cause the quadruplex unfold ing. Probably this is due to specific interactions of biva lent ions with electron acceptor groups of the guanines responsible for the formation of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Comparative ranking of the degree of G4 stabi lization by the mono and bivalent metal ions is as fol lows: Sr 2+ > Ba 2+ > K + > Ca 2+ > Na + , NH 4 + > Rb + > Mg 2+ > Li + Cs + [22] . The cations, especially the bivalent ones, initiate conformational transitions between the dif ferent G4 folding topologies. Thus, conversion of antiparallel G4 into parallel one occurs under the action of Ca 2+ [39] . A similar effect is observed for telomeric G4s when a small amount of KCl is added to Na + solution. It was shown recently that the G4 with only two G tetrad layers instead of the usually observed three tetrad struc ture becomes the predominant form at extremely low concentration of potassium or strontium ions [22] . According to molecular dynamics simulation, the cation does not initiate the quadruplex formation, but rather sta bilizes the preformed structure [30] .\n\nFactors affecting topology of DNA quadruplexes. The type of loops connecting G tracts, their length, and base sequence represent such factors [40 42] . The two or three tetrad G4 with three single nucleotide loops has parallel topology and no other, and all the loops are of propeller type [43, 44] . In the presence of K + , the struc ture with parallel orientation of all the strands is charac teristic for the quadruplex with two single nucleotide loops regardless of the length and base sequence of the third loop [26, 42, 45] . At the same time, in the presence of Na + the topology of G4s formed by the same oligonu cleotides is much more variable and depends to a greater degree on the G4 motif sequence than in K + solution [42] . The G quadruplex with three dinucleotide loops can adopt either parallel or antiparallel folding topology, but the parallel one is more energetically favorable [46] . The parallel stranded structure prevails in G4 with only one single nucleotide loop. The type of nucleotide (A, T, G, or C) in this loop does not affect the G quadruplex topology [42] . It was shown using CD spectroscopy that within the library of intramolecular DNA quadruplexes with loop lengths varying from one to three nucleotides, the G4 topology shifts from parallel to antiparallel or mixed when the total length of all loops is larger than five nucleotide residues [26] . The fact that the propeller loops contain no more than three nucleotides [26] imposes steric limitations on the number of G tetrad layers in the intramolecular quadruplex (that is on its \"height\") [47, 48] . The number of guanosines in the G tract does not necessary correspond to the number of G tetrads [47] . Thus, it was shown by NMR spectroscopy that oligonu cleotide containing G tract made from 15 guanosine residues formed a parallel intramolecular G quadruplex consisting of three G tetrad layers and three propeller loops containing guanosine residues [48] .\n\nThere is a correlation between the type of G4 motif folding and N glycosidic syn and anti conformations of guanosines forming the quadruplex core. Four possible conformation sets in the GpG dinucleotide sequence within G4 are considered: syn-anti, anti-anti, anti-syn, and syn-syn. They differ significantly in their energy parameters due to the different geometry of stacking con tacts between guanines. The 5\u2032 terminal GpG sequence that assume syn-anti and syn-syn conformations are also considered in [49] . In these dinucleotides, the 5\u2032 end hydroxyl group forms H bonds with N3 of the guanine in syn conformation. When all four strands in the G4 are oriented in parallel to each other, all the guanosines are in anti conformation, which is most favorable energetically. In the case of G4 with other topologies, the syn-anti con formation of guanosines correlates with the mutual orien tation of the strands changing both inside the G tetrad cycle and along the quadruplex axis (Fig. 1a) . Four grooves are located on the G4 surface with the width (narrow, medium, and wide) and distribution of the phos phate group charges in the sugar phosphate backbone depending on the topology of the four stranded structures [50, 51] . The parallel intermolecular quadruplex has four almost identical grooves that are of the same size as the minor groove of the DNA duplex. Two narrow and two wide grooves are formed in the G4 with alternating con formations anti-syn-anti-syn in each tetrad, while one wide, one narrow, and two medium grooves are formed in the G4 with alternating anti-anti-syn-syn conforma tions in the G tetrads. BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 Taking into consideration that there are 26 combina tions of different loops and eight possible types of G tetrads with various sets of syn-anti conformations of guanosine residues, the number of possible conforma tions even for the quadruplexes formed via intramolecu lar folding of one oligonucleotide molecule is very large [52] . Formation of intermolecular structures further increases conformational diversity of G4s. Additional conformation possibilities emerge due to introduction of A , C , or T tetrads into the quadruplex core, as well as due to formation of more complex planar pentads, hexads, heptads, and octads stabilized by H bonds [53, 54] that contain other bases along with guanines.\n\nQuadruplex associates. Some G4s, especially parallel ones, are prone to inter quadruplex interactions [55] . It was shown by NMR spectroscopy that two intramolecu lar parallel G quadruplexes in K + solution stuck together due to interactions of 5\u2032 end G tetrads (\"blunt\" end interaction) [43, 56] . Models of quadruplex multimeriza tion via stacking of 3\u2032 3\u2032 and 3\u2032 5\u2032 end G tetrads have been described [57] . Both intramolecular [43] and inter molecular DNA quadruplexes can interact with each other; moreover, the contact between the G4 subunits can be formed not only by the G tetrads, but also by heptads and octads with large hydrophobic surface [53, 54] that contain different bases in addition to four guanine residues. Another type of dimeric G4s is formed similarly to the assembly of DNA duplexes via \"sticky\" ends. \"Sticking\" together of two G quadruplexes can occur due to guanosine residues from each subunit participating in formation of new G tetrad at the two quadruplex subunit junction. This is what happens during intermolecular assembly of G4 by four molecules of the d(GGGT) oligonucleotide. The G tracts of the initial G4 slide along each other providing the dimer formation. The design of oligonucleotide constructs for formation of G quadru plex structures of higher order has been described [58] .\n\nThe main strategy for genome analysis involves cor rect determination of sequences that can be assigned to G4 motifs. The set of sequences that were shown experi mentally to form G quadruplexes is considered as a basis set [59] . Algorithms for searching and marking of G4 forming sequences have been developed in the last decade due to accumulation of a large amount of data on sequencing of genomes of mammals and bacteria [60, 61] . The distribution of G4 motifs revealed by the QuadParser algorithm (G n L 1 7 G n L 1 7 G n L 1 7 G n , where n 3, L = A, T(U), G, C) in the genomes of different organ isms was investigated in several works [62 64] . It was shown that predominantly the eukaryotic genomes are enriched with G4 motifs. They are distributed non ran domly primarily away from the regions involved in nucle osome formation and in non methylated regions [65] . High frequency of G4 motifs is observed within telomer ic DNA [66] and micro(mini)satellite repeats [67, 68] , in long terminal repeats (LTRs) of retrotransposons [69] , in genes of ribosomal RNA, in regulatory regions of the genome such as gene promoters [70] ; predominately in the coding (sense) strand [71] , in origins of replication [5, 72, 73] , in immunoglobulin switch regions and break point regions of chromosome translocation [74] , recom bination hotspots [75] , intronic sequences [76, 77] , CpG islands, enhancers, and insulators [78] , in mitochondrial DNA [79] , as well as in various regions of the transcrip tome including sites of alternative mRNA processing, splicing [80] , 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated mRNA regions [2] , telomeric non coding RNA [81] , pre microRNA [82] , and long non coding RNA [83] .\n\nIt was shown using the computational methods that G4 motifs are evolutionarily conserved [84] . The densi ty of G4 forming sequences is significantly higher in the non coding regions compared with coding ones [85] . There are more than 376,000 G4 motifs in the human genome according to the QuadParser algorithm. More than 40% of genes encoding human proteins contain at least one G4 motif in the promoter region [62] . On aver age, the distribution density of such sequences along the human genome is 0.153 per 1000 base pairs (bp), while their content in promoter regions is 1.48. The maximum on the distribution probability curve of G4 motifs in human, mouse, rat, yeast, and E. coli genomes corre sponds to a site located at approximately 50 bp from the transcription start site (TSS). On the other hand, more than 800 G4 motifs are localized in regions removed from the TSS of 22,049 human genes by up to 5000 bp [86, 87] . The fact that G4 forming sequences were evo lutionarily conserved support the role of DNA G quadruplexes in key cellular processes [88] . The gene regulatory regions of warm blooded animals are more enriched with G4 motifs [80] , with the human genome containing the highest number. Moreover, the presence of G4 motifs has been observed equally in regulatory sites of early and late genes. In general, they precede oncogenes and less often tumor cell suppressor genes [89] . The G4 motifs are mostly associated with genes encoding proteins responsible for regulatory functions rather than \"housekeeping\" proteins. Homology between G4 motifs of vertebrates and yeasts in the mito chondrial and nuclear genomes was revealed by compar ative in silico analysis [85] . Interestingly, there is one order of magnitude more G4 motifs in the mitochondr ial DNA from S. cerevisiae than in the nuclear genome [90] . In plants, quadruplex forming sequences acting as translation repressors were found in 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNA [91] . Retrotransposon LTRs, BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 which are highly abundant in plants, contain a large number of G4 motifs [69] .\n\nFalse negative and false positive G4 motifs. Numerous regions have been elucidated in recent years in the human genome with primary structure deviating from the G n L 1 7 G n L 1 7 G n L 1 7 G n pattern (where n 3, L = A, T(U), G, C), which nevertheless form quadruplex struc tures [92] . The G4 motif within minisatellite DNA that folds into a quadruplex with 9 nt middle loop is consid ered as a false negative [67] ; the dominating G4 formed in the promoter of the human Bcl 2 gene assumes paral lel topology with a 13 nt loop [87] . According to other data, the average middle loop of a stable G4 can contain up to 21 nucleotide residues [93] . Moreover, recently the evidence was presented for occurrence of bulges (that is the incorporation of non guanine bases in G tracts) in different G4 contexts. It was shown using NMR spec troscopy and other methods that single or multiple bulges in the quadruplex core can vary in length, nucleotide composition, and location [94] . There are also data of false positive G4 motifs that obey the classical pattern but do not form quadruplexes. Thus, G rich sequences in 5\u2032 UTR of human mRNA were not able to fold into quadruplexes due to the availability of C tracts in flank ing regions, which hybridized with the G tracts forming alternative secondary structures [14] . To overcome these limitations, other more accurate tools to predict G4 propensity of a given DNA or RNA sequences are need ed. More general criteria should be taken into account, for example, the effect of neighboring sequences, which could cover wider functional regions of genomes and transcriptomes [95, 96] . Development and testing of a radically different algorithm, G4Hunter, was suggested in 2016. This algorithm takes into consideration G richness and G skewness (G/C asymmetry between the comple mentary strands of the double helix) of a given sequence [97] . To validate the G4Hunter, a large dataset was ana lyzed, and G4 forming potential for human mitochondr ial DNA fragments was evaluated using the combination of biophysical methods. Analysis of genomes of various organisms using the developed algorithm showed that the number of sequences capable of forming stable G4s in the human genome is significantly (2 10 fold) higher than estimated before.\n\nG4 motifs at the ends of eukaryotic linear chromo somes (telomeres). It is known that telomeric DNA con sists of tandem repeats of G\u22c5C rich non coding sequences with a 150 250 nt single stranded G rich overhang at the 3\u2032 end. In human cells as well as in the cells of all verte brates, telomeric DNA comprises a (TTAGGG)/(CCC TAA) repeat with size of several thousands of base pairs. Similar G\u22c5C rich repeats are characteristic for many phy logenetically distant species; the typical telomeric sequence in insects contains the (TTAGG)/(CCTAA) repeat, in plants -(TTTAGGG)/(CCCTAAA), in Tetrahymena -(TTGGGG/CCCCAA), and in the lower eukaryote (ciliate) Oxytricha nova -(TTTTGGGG/ CCCCAAAA).\n\nG4 motifs in bacterial and viral genomes. The distri bution of G4 motifs in the genomes of these species is still poorly understood. The implication of G4s in virology only begins to be realized. In the E. coli genome, they also are mainly located in regulatory regions, which suggests participation of G4s in regulation of transcription [98] . The search for G quadruplexes and elucidation of their functions in viral genomes has mostly focused on the HIV retrovirus. Location of G4 motifs near recombination hotspots, central polypurine tract at the 3\u2032 end of the pol gene, and in HIV 1 LTR promoter indicates participation of G4s in recombination, replication, and regulation of HIV 1 promoter activity [99 101 ]. It has been suggested that G4s formed close to the origins of replication within DNA containing Epstein\u2212Barr virus play an important role in DNA replication and metaphase chromosome attachment [102] . Moreover, it was shown recently that G4 clusters were responsible for regulation of virus encoded nuclear antigene 1 mRNA translation [103] . The G4 motifs presented in the non coding regulatory DNA region of the SV40 virus can form unusual structures with a C tetrad integrated into the quadruplex core. It was suggested that these quadruplexes play an important role in the regulation of replication as well as early and late transcription of the viral genome. The G4 forming sequences and their potential to form quadruplex struc tures were analyzed in the genomes of all known human papillomaviruses [104] . Participation of G4s in transcrip tion, replication, and alternative splicing required for production of viral proteins has been discussed for at least some of them. The role of G quadruplexes in the life cycle of viruses, such as HIV, as well as applications of G4 containing DNA aptamers as antiviral agents, diag nostics, and innovation tools have been discussed [43, 105] .\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS AND KINETICS OF QUADRUPLEX FOLDING-UNFOLDING To characterize G quadruplexes formed in a certain genome locus, each identified G4 motif is investigated in vitro under different experimental conditions close, to a lesser or greater degree, to the intracellular ones. The methods commonly used for the description of G4 topol ogy and determination of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of G quadruplex folding and unfolding include CD [106, 107] and UV spectroscopy [108, 109] , differential scanning calorimetry [110, 111] , gel elec trophoresis [29, 52] , X ray crystallography [25, 112] , chemical and enzymatic probing [101, 113, 114] , fluores cence spectroscopy, fluorescence resonance energy trans fer (FRET) [34, 46, 115, 116] , including single molecule BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 FRET [41, 117, 118] , Raman spectroscopy [119] , elec tron paramagnetic resonance [120, 121] , hydrodynamic and chromatographic techniques [52] , molecular model ling and molecular dynamics simulation [30, 122 124] , mass spectrometry [125] , and NMR spectroscopy [56, 126, 127] . The detailed characteristic of several methods used for G4 investigation have been described [128] .\n\nA large amount of data is available in the literature on the kinetics and thermodynamics of G4 formation that were obtained using traditional approaches [128] . However, unlike G quadruplex structure, these aspects have not been studied systematically. Also, correlation between the thermodynamic stability, kinetics, and G4 structures has not been considered. Typically, the thermo dynamic parameters of individual G4 folding-unfolding were investigated and usually by different methods [129] . An algorithm for predicting quadruplex stability was developed based on non systematic data [130] . Spontaneous folding of single stranded sequences con taining G tracts into quadruplexes is a thermodynamical ly favorable process [128] . Unlike other non canonical structures, G quadruplexes are formed under conditions close to physiological, and their melting temperature (T m ) can exceed 70 80\u00b0C. Of critical importance for the stabilization and unfolding paths of G4s, not found in DNA and RNA duplexes, are the cations within the cen tral quadruplex channel. The \u0394G\u00b0 and \u0394H\u00b0 values of intramolecular G4 formation from 22 26 nt sequences (3 4 G tetrads) in 100 mM K + vary in the range from -2 to -8 kcal/mol and from -30 to -80 kcal/mol, respec tively; the stability of G quadruplexes in Na + solution is significantly lower [31] . Unlike G4, the stability of DNA and RNA duplexes does not depend on the type of monovalent cations. Analysis of the thermodynamic data has shown that intramolecular G4 are not more stable than other intramolecular complexes of nucleic acids [128] . Hairpin DNA structures exhibit significantly high er T m value than G4s of comparable length under equal conditions [131] . It was also shown that in most cases the energy of G4 formation is not sufficient to separate the strands of double helix (>20 bp) in inner DNA sites such as promoter regions [128] . However, special properties have been assigned to intramolecular parallel G4 formed by the d((GGGT) 3 GGG) sequence; folding of this G4 structure is much more energetically favorable than for mation of the DNA duplex in the presence of comple mentary strand [132] . Moreover, the replacement of guanosine in the first G tract (at the second position) by an apurinic site does not prevent folding of the analogous sequence into G4, although it results in significant desta bilization of the structure [133] . It was shown by molecu lar dynamics simulation that the vacant place in the formed G triad is occupied by a water molecule. The unique binding pocket in G4 can be used as a specific tar get for low molecular weight ligands and nucleic acids metabolites. The G4 containing more than one vacant site (in one or different G tetrads) is also reasonably sta ble [134] . Furthermore, G4 with a single apurinic site can be formed by other sequences, such as human telomeric repeats [135] . It is interesting that \"excess\" of guanosines in some G tracts can cause their sliding relative to each other during formation of quadruplex structures. It was shown that this process stabilized the folded state; the T m value of G4 increased significantly due to favorable entropic changes [136] .\n\nFactors affecting thermodynamic parameters of G4 folding-unfolding. Among these factors, the cation com position and ionic strength of the buffer solution, number of interacting molecules, their primary structure, and length of G tracts [109] , as well as the presence of nucleotide fragments flanking G4 motif [137] have been studied. The stability of G4 depends strongly on the type of loops, their length, and base composition/sequence [93, 138] . Replacement of only one base in a one or two nucleotide loop of a quadruplex and in the G4 flanking fragments can affect G4 stability [42, 137, 139] . In par ticular, the replacement of T or C by A in the one nucleotide loop of parallel G4 with (1:3-9:1) loops caus es significant destabilization of the quadruplex structure [42] ; according to NMR spectroscopy data, the adenine residue is pushed out of the G4 groove, unlike the thymine residue, which is in the quadruplex groove [140] . It was shown that independent of the orientation of DNA strands, the thermodynamic stability of intramolecular G4 decreased with increasing length of loops [26, 93, 139] . Indeed, each additional nucleotide in a propeller loop decreases the T m value by 2\u00b0C [42, 93] . This depend ence is not connected with the base sequence in the G4 loops; this was shown using a set of three tetrad intramol ecular G quadruplexes with partially randomized loop sequences [26] . In the case when the total length of all loops exceeds five nucleotide residues, its further increase affects the thermodynamic stability only insignificantly. On the other hand, H bonds or stacking contacts in long quadruplex loops [141] , as well as stacking interactions of loop bases with terminal G tetrads, could provide favor able contribution of enthalpy to the thermodynamics of G4 formation. The stability of G4 also increases when the bases in the long loop can hybridize with the bases of the 5\u2032 end sequence flanking the G4 motif [142] .\n\nIt is known that the G4 formation is accompanied by the release of water molecules [143] . The thermodynam ic contribution of dehydration and capture of counter ions was estimated in [50] . It was shown that water affect ed thermodynamic stability and polymorphism of G4s [110, 144] . The decrease in water activity caused by addi tion of various alcohols or polyethylene glycol (PEG) into aqueous solution, results in stabilization of the quadru plex [145] ; PEG is usually used as molecular crowding agent to create cell mimicking conditions. It should be noted that the solvation effects observed for intramolecu lar quadruplexes and DNA double helices are diametri cally opposite; decrease in water activity destabilized B DNA, but increased the stability of G4 [131] . However, the effect of PEG causing dehydration of quadruplexes on their stability is not so unambiguous. As shown in 2016, the G4 stability in the presence of monovalent ions increased after addition of molecular crowding agents. In contrary, PEG stabilized only parallel G4s, but had no effect on stability or even destabilized antiparallel or mixed G4 structures in the presence of bivalent ions [143] . According to a suggested hypothesis, Sr 2+ , Ba 2+ , and Pb 2+ compensate to some degree the effect of dehy dration accompanying formation of G4 structure, espe cially in the case of G quadruplexes with antiparallel ori entation of strands.\n\nThe most detailed and comprehensive information is available on the thermodynamics and kinetics of intramolecular G4 formation by oligonucleotides con taining four G tracts from human telomeric DNA repeats [109, 128, 130] . The thermodynamic data for oligonu cleotide models with identical or similar primary struc ture were summarized in a review published in 2010 [129] , where the presented \u0394G\u00b0 values varied over a wide range (3.4 14.8 kcal/mol). The reasons for the observed parameter variation were associated with polymorphism of telomeric DNA quadruplexes. It is now recognized that most G4 motifs can form G quadruplexes of differ ent architecture that are energetically similar and at dynamic equilibrium. Various types of G4 conformations can be formed at different rates, which results in non identical sets of conformers under variant conditions of sample preparation and using different investigation methods [146] . But even under the same conditions the identical telomeric sequence can fold into many different quadruplex structures [109] , and the formed G4 can con vert into other conformations that are separated by only slight energy barriers (2 kcal/mol) [147] . It was shown that individual conformers could be almost identical in thermodynamic, electrophoretic, and hydrodynamic properties, but exhibit different CD and NMR spectra as well as kinetic stability [52] .\n\nControversial opinions have been presented in the papers regarding whether the intramolecular foldingunfolding of the single G4 is a simple one step process. It has been advocated in some publications that G4 melting proceeds according to a two state model [111] . However, most researchers believe this process proceeds via inter mediate stages and does not correspond to an \"all or none\" model [129, 148, 149] . Using CD spectroscopy, fluorescence assay, and FRET, a multistep mechanism of telomeric G4 folding was verified recently, and the kinet ics of each step was investigated [150, 151] . According to data of biophysical, computational, and other methods, G4 formation proceeds via thermodynamically and kinetically significant intermediates even during intra molecular folding of the oligonucleotide [149, 152] . These intermediates can comprise hairpin structures whose interaction initiates formation of the quadruplex core, or these can be G triplexes varying in topology that are formed via separation of one of the G tracts from the quadruplex [153] . The evidence for the occurrence of these structures stabilized by G triads was obtained experimentally by NMR and CD spectroscopies, differ ential scanning calorimetry, and other techniques [134, 149] , and the properties of possible G triplex forms were analyzed by molecular dynamics techniques [154] . It was shown that the number of intermediates determined the kinetics of full sized G4 folding. The number of these states observed in K + solution was less than in Na + buffer [155] . The fundamental difference in the behavior of par allel G4 with all guanosines in anti conformation, which allowed slippage of G tracts along each other with forma tion of intermediates with lower number of G tetrads in the quadruplex core, and antiparallel G4, in which the syn or anti conformation of guanosine residues correlat ing with the strand directions blocked the slippage process, was specifically emphasized. It is of interest that the number and type of residues attached to 5\u2032 and to 3\u2032 ends of the G4 affect the rate of quadruplex formation, but they do not change its multistep mechanism.\n\nThe kinetics of G quadruplex folding depends on the base sequence of the G4 motif and varies in the range from milliseconds to minutes. It was noted that the time of G4 formation of human telomeric repeats that were capable of very fast intramolecular folding correlated with the time of DNA replication [156] . According to data obtained using various experimental approaches, high rate of telomeric G4 folding (16 50 s -1 ) was observed at low concentrations of potassium ions (<10 mM), while the rate of their unfolding was low (1.3\u00b710 -3 s -1 ) [128, 155] . Unusually slow melting of intramolecular quadru plexes was also postulated [157] . The statement on the high folding rate of the G quadruplex structure contra dicts the results of theoretical analysis [158] , according to which competition between the different conformations of G quadruplexes including the intermediates (especial ly DNA hairpin structures) makes this multidirectional process very slow. In the view of authors, the G4 forma tion follows a very complex kinetic pathway involving multiple alternative states, and only a small fraction of molecules is folded into the final G4 structure. Data obtained recently by NMR [159] and CD [110] agree with such kinetic pattern.\n\nRegarding intermolecular G4s, the polymorphism of these structures is defined by kinetics limitations even more than in the case of intramolecular G4s. Kinetic models that differed significantly depending on the type of the cation (K + or Na + ) in the environment were sug gested in a work of Prislan et al. [160] based on tradition al approaches. These models describe the processes of G4 folding-unfolding and structural transitions between the different quadruplex conformations formed by the d(G 4 T 4 G 3 ) oligonucleotide with two G tracts. BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 Potential of single molecule techniques for G quadru plex study. The commonly used experimental methods allowing exploring averaged properties of a multitude of molecules (CD, NMR spectroscopy, X ray crystallogra phy) are not so informative for the analysis of distinct G4 structures, especially those comprising a small fraction within heterogeneous population. Investigation of behav ior of single molecules provides more information for determination of the subpopulations of various structures in polymorphic mixture. For instance, the structure and dynamics of G4 at the single molecule level was investigat ed using FRET, and the coexistence of several types of quadruplex conformations formed by human telomeric repeats was revealed [117] . In recent years, the original laser and magnetic tweezers were developed for investiga tion of thermodynamics and kinetics of conformational transitions that occur due to mechanical stretching-relax ation of single stranded G rich repeats (telomeric DNA or promoter fragments) sandwiched between long pulling double stranded DNA (dsDNA) handles immobilized on two optically trapped or paramagnetic beads [146, 153, 157, 161, 162] . According to [163] , unwinding of struc tured DNA under stretching is physiologically more rational that thermal melting, the latter being impossible in vivo. On the contrary, DNA replication, transcription, and other processes can stretch DNA, which causes local unwinding of the double helix. The mechanical stability of G4s was evaluated using optical tweezers, and it was found to be comparable with the force causing the stop of DNA and RNA polymerases. Comparative study of mechanical stability of G4 and the hairpin DNA under physiological conditions using the same technique revealed that unlike the hairpin structures, DNA quadruplexes could serve as an efficient barrier for replication or transcription [164] . It Direct quantification of loop interactions and G tetrad stacking using the optical tweezers and chemical approaches. Assisted by click chemistry, pulling dsDNA handles were attached via two modified guanines in each of the three G tetrads. The G4 is presented on the scheme with \"upper\" or \"lower\" tetrad covalently bound to the DNA duplexes (a, b). Attachment of the dsDNA fragment carrying an azide group (4) to the guanosine derivative of the G4 motif with an alkyne group in the adjacent phosphate residue (3) was conducted via alkyne azide cycloaddition (5) . The modified guanosine residues after introduction of the alkyne group to the 3\u2032 end phosphate (1) were used as synthons (2) in solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. This allowed introducing alkyne containing residues to predetermined positions of the G rich oligonucleotide (c). A similar strategy was used for attachment of dsDNA to G quadruplex loops. The laser beams focused onto beads are pre sented as yellow cones.\n\nAlkyne azide cycloaddition Solid phase DNA synthesis a b c was shown using molecular dynamics simulation that the unfolding event of intramolecular G4s of different topolo gy under mechanical stretching was accompanied by the loss of coordination between the central ion and guanines of the G tetrads [165] , which agreed with experimental data [166] . In pioneering work [167] , new strategy was devel oped to discriminate the contribution of loops and G tetrad stacking to quadruplex stability at the force induced G4 unfolding. The contributions from G4 ele ments were determined using optical tweezers technique and click chemistry (Fig. 2) . Mechanical unfolding of human telomeric G4 revealed that the loops' interactions contribute more to the G4 stability than the stacking of G tetrads.\n\nThe use of magnetic tweezers allowed characterizing the equilibrium conformational transitions in intramole cular telomeric G4 at physiological concentrations of potassium ions (\u223c100 mM) [146] , which was impossible to do using optical techniques due to the high stability of quadruplexes under these conditions. Three quadruplex conformations were revealed in a timeframe of several minutes, which exhibited different lifetimes and mechan ical stabilities. It was shown that the kinetically controlled distribution of human telomer DNA G4 isomers depend ed on conditions of their formation [168] ; in other words, the longer lived and more thermodynamically stable iso mers could be accumulated in a sample with increasing experiment duration. The magnetic tweezers technique was used to study the kinetic properties of G4 formed from a 27 nt G rich region of the oncogene c Myc pro moter at 100 mM K + . The dominating G4 conformation was shown to melt more slowly by several orders of mag nitude than G quadruplexes of other topologies [157] . It was suggested that this non canonical structure could play a role of a kinetic barrier in transcription regulation.\n\nAnalysis of the published data indicates that the paths of G4 folding-unfolding and their thermodynamic and kinetic parameters can vary for different quadruplex es and different experimental conditions. It is likely that there is no universal mechanism appropriate for all G4s and sample preparation conditions. But the combination of modern experimental techniques and advanced com putational methods could help to elucidate which quadruplex conformations are most represented on bio logically significant time scales.\n\nBesides telomeric ends, G4 forming sequences are present in the genome together with complementary strands in the form of double helix. Thus, investigation of thermodynamics and kinetics of the equilibrium between G4 and duplex DNA is important because the double helix is the native context for genomic DNA. The fluores cence assay in a combination with G4 recognizing low molecular weight ligands was used to measure the G4 folding propensity in both single stranded and double stranded DNAs [116] . As expected, the ability of G4 motif to form G4 was substantially diminished in the DNA duplexes due to the competition from the Watson-Crick base pairing. Unlike G4 folding sequence in single stranded DNA, which forms both parallel and antiparallel G4s, dsDNA displays only parallel folding. It was shown in several studies that G4-DNA duplex equi librium depended on many factors affecting relative sta bility of both secondary structures: temperature, avail ability of fragments flanking G4, primary structure of G motif, cationic composition, and other factors. One such factor is the length of loops in the quadruplex; the short er they are, the more stable is the G4 and, consequently, the less stable is the duplex formed in the presence of complementary strand due to the shorter hybridization site [116] . Thus, oligonucleotide with human telomeric repeats d(TTAGGG) 4 (the length of loops in the G4 structure are 3 : 3 : 3) forms duplex under physiological conditions in the presence of complementary C rich strand, while the sequence of the C myc promoter d(GGGTGGGGAGGGTGGG) predominantly assumes G4 conformation with 1 : 2 : 1 loops. The same factorchange in length of the hybridization site -shifts the equilibrium towards the duplex formations in the case of the G4 motif flanked with nucleotide residues [169] . Similar regularities were observed during monitoring of isothermal G4 unwinding in the presence of complemen tary strand carrying fluorescent label [170] . It was shown that availability of the sequence neighboring the G quadruplex accelerated this process approximately two fold, and the K + concentration was found to be a key fac tor controlling the kinetics of G4 unwinding in the pres ence of a complementary strand. Thus, the G4 formed by the C myc promoter sequence remains stable in the pres ence of the complementary strand even at 70\u00b0C in 100 mM KCl. If the G4 motifs potentially can fold intramolecularly into imperfect hairpin duplex as in the case of the promoter region of the WNT1 gene, d(GGGCCACCGGGCAGGGGGCGGG), the K + induced transition into G4 occurs significantly more slowly than the quadruplex formation from the unstruc tured oligonucleotide [171] . Addition of PEG, which decreases water activity, facilitates G4 assembly even in the absence of cations and shifts the equilibrium from the DNA duplex formed by the telomeric repeats with the complementary strand to G4. The use of complementary probes with enhanced hybridization ability, for example peptide nucleic acids (PNA), on the contrary results in effective G4 unfolding and formation of a heteroduplex (DNA/PNA) [172] .\n\nThe DNA double helix in vivo becomes temporarily single stranded during replication, reparation, and tran BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 scription, and the open forms can later fold into various non canonical structures. The conformational rearrange ment of duplex DNA into G4, for instance, in gene pro motors, can be reached through supercoiling effect. It is known that the transcription machinery can generate negative supercoils behind the moving RNA polymerase. Negative superhelicity stimulates G4 formation [86] , because the local unwinding of duplex DNA is facilitated under conditions of topological stress, thus relieving the superhelical constraints. The effect of supercoiling can propagate along the double helix of chromosomal DNA over large distances, initiating conformational rearrange ments of genome sites separated by several thousand base pairs from the TSS [86] . That is why not oligonucleotide models but supercoiled plasmids containing inserts of double stranded G\u00b7C rich DNA with G tracts on one of the strands and C tracts on the complementary one are better for modeling in vivo conditions. It was shown using these models that G4 can exist inside a duplex DNA that is the native genomic context [113, 173] . They are formed much more easily in the case of negative supercoiling that is before the transcribed sequence but not behind it [86] . The statistical mechanism of transitions from B DNA to G4 includes competition between the two states, and the equilibrium distribution between them at a certain level of negative supercoiling is calculated from values of free energy for alternative conformations [174] . Modern tech niques of magneto optical tweezers that combine the nanometer resolution with the possibility to generate the prescribed level of DNA supercoiling by a pair of magnets were used for quantitative evaluation of the relationship between the degree of topological stress and the efficien cy of G quadruplex formation. It was shown that the G4 population increased from 2.4 to 23% with increase in the density of negative supercoiling to -0.05; moreover, the G4 formation efficiency correlated with the readiness of the DNA double helix melting [175] . In addition to supercoiling, the structure of chromatin, binding of pro teins specifically recognizing quadruplex structures [4] , and the effect of molecular crowding [116] can mediate a shift of equilibrium from DNA duplex to G4 in vivo.\n\nIt was shown using oligonucleotide models and plas mid constructs that the intramolecular folding of G rich sequences into the G4 could be accompanied by the for mation of non canonical four stranded i motif by com plementary the C rich strand (Fig. 3) [70, 113, 176, 177] . The enzymatic and/or chemical footprinting experiments are usually used to provide direct insight into the G4 and i motif folding patterns because these purine rich/pyrim idine rich tracts are the nuclease hypersensitive regions [113] . They are considered as markers of B form distor tions, such as \"unwound\" regions and various non canonical structures. It is known that the pH dependent i motif structure is formed by two parallel duplexes stabi lized by semi protonated C\u2261C + pairs (Fig. 3a ) through their intercalation in mutually antiparallel orientations ( Fig. 3) . The factors that affect the stability of i motif (pK a value, length of loops, epigenetic modification of cytosine residues, presence of PEG, degree of hydration) were recently analyzed [178, 179] . Oligonucleotides with G rich and C rich sequence from the gene promoters were shown in in vitro experiments to fold into G quadru plexes and i motifs, respectively, under certain condi tions. The competition between two types of four strand ed structures and DNA duplex depended on the cation composition and pH of the medium. Distance dependent DNA duplex destabilization caused by proximal G4 or i motif structures was estimated [180] . This rather artificial model comprises a fragment of double helix with protrud ing single stranded end, which folds into one of the non canonical forms. Though the slightly acidic medium sta bilized the i motif [176] , the formation of this alternative structure occurred even at neutral pH under conditions of DNA supercoiling [113] or in a molecular crowding envi ronment imitated by adding of special reagents [181, 182] -two physiologically relevant states of the genome.\n\nThere are contradicting data on whether an i motif can be folded in the complementary single stranded region after a G4 is formed in the opposite strand, or they are mutually exclusive. On one hand, formation of G quadruplex and i motif in the promoter regions of the c Myc gene inserted into the supercoiled plasmid ( Fig. 3c ) was established using chemical footprinting [113] . It was found that the G4 and i motif were slightly displaced rel ative to each other (contain only three common G\u00b7C tracts from the four required); moreover, a longer DNA fragment was used for formation of i motif, because, unlike G quadruplex, long loops increased the stability of the four stranded C rich structure [70] . On the other hand, it was shown using the laser tweezers based single molecule technique and chemical footprinting approach [163] that the fragment of double helix that contained the G\u22c5C rich region (ACAGGGGTGTGGGC) 2 /(GCCCA CACCCCTGT) 2 from the insulin linked polymorphic region (ILPR) formed only one four stranded structure, but not both, under conditions that favor the formation of G4 and i motif -pH 5.5, 100 mM K + . Formation of only one of the quadruplexes in this site was attributed to mutual steric hindrances emerging due to the mechanical stretching-relaxation of the dsDNA. A more general conclusion was suggested in a study conducted in 2016, where the formation of G4 and i motif in different frag ments of double stranded DNA (human telomeres and gene promoter regions) was investigated using the optical tweezers technique and population analysis. It was shown that mutually exclusive formation of one of the quadru plexes was the consequence of steric hindrance in duplex DNA; thus, simultaneous formation of both quadruplex es separated in the complementary strands was observed in the Bcl 2 gene promoter [183] . The variability in for mation of four stranded non canonical DNA structures governed by appropriate base sequence can facilitate fine BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 tuning of gene expression [184] , because the G4 forma tion represents the signal for inhibition of transcription, while the i motif can play a role as the activation signal [177, 184] .\n\nOligonucleotide DNA models with coexisting duplex and G quadruplex domains. In recent years, oligonu cleotide systems containing G4 duplex hybrids of various topology have attracted considerable attention [185] . Investigation of thermodynamic stability of constructs with contrasting orientations of the duplex stem with respect to the G4 core (coaxial or orthogonal) (Fig. 4) showed that in the case of the structured long loop, the stability of the quadruplex increased; furthermore, the type of the base pair closest to the duplex G4 junction and the availability of bulges at the boundary of two domains affected significantly the stability of the formed secondary structure [186] . As shown by NMR spec troscopy, stable structures were formed also in the case of multiple duplex stems within the same loop of the paral lel G4. Moreover, the multiple duplex inserts could be located in different loops of the same G4, allowing wider variety of the architecture of these structures [187] . The availability of sequences capable of folding into G4 with double helix in one of the loops (with length up to 20 nucleotide units) was analyzed in 2015 [188] . A large number (80, 307) of duplex stem loop containing G4 motifs organized as clusters was identified in the human genome: in the hotspots of mutations and in the promot er regions of genes associated with oncological diseases and brain tissue pathogenesis. It was suggested that this type of two domain structure can participate in various biological processes including pathological ones.\n\nIn other types of duplex-G4 hybrids, complementa ry sequences were attached to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of a G4 motif [189, 190] . It was shown using the thrombin bind ing aptamer as an example that both duplex and antipar allel G quadruplex domains coexist in intramolecular structure of aptamer. The interrelationship between the duplex and G quadruplex domains was identified: destruction of one via site directed modification of oligonucleotide sequence resulted in dissociation of the other [190] . The 3D structure of an aptamer with similar base sequence was investigated by X ray crystallography [112] . Formation of the duplex domain was not observed when the mutually complementary sequences flanked the parallel G4 because in this case the complementary frag ments were separated in space; their existence only desta bilized the G4 structure [44] . 3 . Four stranded i motif formed by C rich strand that is complementary to G4 forming sequences. Semi protonated C\u2261C + pairs (a) sta bilizing parallel duplexes whose mutual intercalation results in formation of i motif with the C\u2261C + pairs being in different planes (b). Two types of four stranded structures formed by G/C rich sequence integrated into DNA plasmid; G4 is shaded with green, and i motif -with yellow (c). Simple single quadruplex models are now replaced by more biologically relevant multiquadruplex models, which provide the possibility for investigation of interac tions between G4 subunits [56, 191] . Conformation potential of long single stranded DNA and RNA with human telomeric repeats, which allow the folding of more than one G4, was mostly investigated [111, 192 194] , as well as that of several other sequences from the human genome that contain many G tracts arranged in tandem, such as gene promoters [195] , insulin linked polymor phic region [193] , minisatellite loci CEB25 [67] , and microsatellite repeats [196] .\n\nTwo models were experimentally confirmed for structures with multiple G4s: \"beads on a string\" [67, 192 194, 197] , in which the individual G4s are separated by single stranded fragment and behave independently from each other, and a model in which G4 are in contact with each other, interacting and forming higher order structures [111] . Furthermore, interaction of neighboring G4 occurs not only via stacking of terminal G tetrads, but also via loop bases, which results in formation of rigid superstructures. Conflicting opinions have been expressed based on investigation of long telomeric DNA and RNA by X ray analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spec trometry methods regarding the model corresponding to structural organization of sequences with multiple G tracts [56, 111, 125, 191] . These contradictions could be explained by structural polymorphism of neighboring G quadruplex units and availability of intermediate and defective structures formed during G4 folding [153, 198] . It was suggested in several papers that both types of struc tures (\"beads on a string\" and interacting G4 subunits) could coexist in long telomeric DNA or RNA, and their ratio depended on various factors in the cell.\n\nIt was shown for simpler models that oligonu cleotides containing more than four guanosine tracts formed several G quadruplexes by using various combi nations of G tracts (position isomers) [52, 199, 200] . It was shown that the sequences capable of forming two individual G4s separated by oligonucleotide linker of var ious length could fold via different means [199] . Predominately one G quadruplex is formed if the linker is short (number of nucleotide units 3) and is found at different positions along the oligonucleotide chain (entropy gain), while in the case of longer linker only one secondary structure is formed with two G4s, which behave as independent quadruplex units.\n\nA multistep model is characteristic for unfolding of a G4 ensemble arranged as \"beads on a string\" [111] . Furthermore, these multiquadruplex structures unfold at lower temperatures than individual G4s [193] . It was shown in 2015 why the stability of the multiquadruplex garland depends on the number of G quadruplex units [201] . The authors proved that the observed decrease in the stability of the structure formed by d((GGGT TA) 4m-1 GGG), where m = 2, 3, 4, with increase of the number of G4 units, was related to the fact that the G4 at the 5\u2032 end of the molecule was more thermodynamically stable than the G4 at the 3\u2032 end, whose stability in turn was higher than the stability of the inner quadruplex domains. In other words, the stability of individual G4 in the garland is modulated by the flanking nucleotide sites. Thus, each inner G4 is surrounded by the TTA sequence from both sides, while the terminal G4 -only from one side (Fig. 5a) . The validity of this explanation has been confirmed by results of investigation of long G4 motif flanked with trinucleotide sequence TTA: d(TTA (GGGTTA) 4m-1 GGG TTA), where m = 2, 3, 4. It was found that the overall stability of the multiquadruplex structure formed by this oligonucleotide did not depend on the number of G4 units, because in this case both the inner and terminal G4 were flanked with trinucleotide sequences from both sides (Fig. 5b) . It is of interest that these results do not change with varying length of the fragment flanking G4.\n\nAt the same time, the higher order G quadruplex ensembles are significantly more stable than the individ ual G4s, and the interquadruplex interactions represent the stabilizing factor in this case [196] .\n\nConformational features of G4s, which are funda mentally different from the other structured DNAs, rep resent a basis for molecular recognition of G quadruplex structures by low molecular weight ligands. Hundreds of small molecules of various chemical nature that are capa ble of selective interactions with G4 have been produced and investigated in the last two decades [202] . They can recognize either preformed G quadruplexes [203] or ini tiate folding of the G4 motifs into such structures. The small molecules that bind and stabilize G4s in telomeric DNA and oncogene promoters are considered as poten tial antitumor agents [8, 77] . Moreover, G4 ligands are invaluable tools for investigation of the biological role of G quadruplexes [204] , as well as for their detection and isolation from cells [205 207] . Numerous articles and reviews have been devoted to analysis of interactions of G4 ligands of various chemical nature with their poly morphic nucleic acids targets, which is why we limited ourselves to only recently published studies [208 211] .\n\nA wide repertoire of chemical approaches has been used for producing compounds with high affinity to G4s [208] . The synthetic G4 ligands include derivatives of anthraquinone (BSU 1051), acridine (BRACO 19, BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 AS1410, RHPS4), quinacridine (BOQ1, NCQ), por phyrin (TMPyP4, NMM) [41] , perylene (PIPER), tri azine (12459) [212] , bis quinoline (360A, 307A) [213] , and others. Furthermore, natural macrocyclic com pounds capable of binding to G4 -telomestatin [214] , ligands based on natural alkaloids [58] , such as berberine [215] , daunomycin [216] , cryptolepine [217] , HXDV, pyridostatin [203, 218] , and natural polyamines -have been characterized. Actively investigated duplex DNA minor groove binding ligands based on benzimidazoles exhibit ability to recognize G4s [219] . Even though some of the investigated ligands demonstrate high selectivity and affinity to G4, several of their properties do not allow considering them as optimal. That is why in recent years numerous compounds have been produced and investi gated that in addition to the ability of binding to quadru plex structures provide such advantages as chemical sta bility and ease of synthesis, enhanced water solubility, ability to penetrate into cells and low toxicity, recognition of G4 with particular topology [220 222] , chiral selectiv ity of interaction with G4 [223, 224] , in particular with c Z G4 [225] , induction of conformational transitions in the quadruplex target [226 228 ], ability of inducing G4 formation (molecular chaperon functions), and high selectivity of the G4-ligand interaction. The selectivity of small molecule compounds was often assessed by their ability to interfere with biological processes associated with G4 formation [210, 213, 229] . Attempts to evaluate the selectivity of several commonly used G4 ligands by monitoring the quadruplex melting using optimized FRET techniques were reported [34] . Compounds that change their optical (luminescent) properties upon inter action with G4 are of interest [207, 230 233] , as well as reactive G4 ligands [234] . Small molecule compounds exhibiting enhanced affinity to RNA quadruplexes [235 237 ] that stabilize or disrupt them during interaction [236] have been actively investigated in recent years. A series of new G4 ligands was discovered using molecular docking [122, 238] . The database (http://www. g4ldb.org) comprising a unique collection of more than 800 known G4 ligands was created to facilitate the design of small molecules with predicted affinity to G quadruplexes [239] . In most ligands, the G4 recognizing site consists of a planar polycyclic aromatic system that binds to the four stranded helix via interaction of \u03c0 electrons of aromatic rings with the terminal G tetrads. It was found recently that some G4 ligands were capable of discriminating \"upper\" and \"lower\" tetrads of the same quadruplex [240, 241] . However, G4s have other sites that demon strate binding with small molecules: grooves with param eters varying for quadruplexes of different topology, phos phate groups, and loop bases. The ligands recognizing these structural determinants can bind to G4 with a par ticular secondary structure [242] . Narrow specificity of such ligands is of great importance for their application as novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents [214] . To impart the desired properties to small molecules, one can intro duce charged side chains and metal ions into them, and the 3D structure of the ligand can be changed radically as well [243] .\n\nMost G4 binding ligands stabilize the G quadruplex targets. G4 stabilization under the action of a low molec ular weight compound is determined by the balance of electrostatic and stacking interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic and Van der Waals forces. The electro static interactions are the most significant. Energy parameters of G4 binding to ligands and methods for their determination have been described [244] . Two pos sible mechanisms for G4 stabilization by ligands have been discussed: (i) decrease in the dissociation constant of the formed G4 structure, which results in increase in its lifetime; (ii) increase in the G4 formation constant; in this case, the ligand initiates the quadruplex assembly. For example, the 360A ligand is capable of acceleration the G4 formation 10 6 fold. Several types of small molecule ligands are known that cause destabilization or even dis ruption of quadruplex structures [245] . Some G4 ligands facilitate disturbance of telomere functions, preventing binding of the proteins of shelterin complex to telomeric DNA [66] . Ligands stabilizing G4s can inhibit their unfolding by helicases competing with the proteins for binding to G4 structures [213] . Small molecules are also known to introduce damages into DNA, for example, pyridostatin causing double strand breaks [203] . Such ligands are considered as effective antitumor agents because they affect cell viability, especially in the case, when the DNA repair system is inhibited or mutated [246] .\n\nStructural information on ligand-G4 complexes has been obtained using NMR spectroscopy [126] and X ray crystallography [247] . It was stated in a review devoted to structural analysis of such complexes [16] that the planar aromatic site of the ligand did not intercalate into the quadruplex core upon its binding, but interacted with ter minal G tetrads. Positively charged groups such as proto nated nitrogen of the acridine ring can use the central electronegative channel of the G quadruplex to enhance interaction of the ligand with G4 structures. The possibil ity of structural adaptation of the quadruplex to the ligand was mentioned, for example reorganization of loops to increase the surface area of G tetrads (to hexads and octads) via incorporation of additional bases or base pairs of the loops into the plane of terminal tetrads. The X ray crystallography data show that the type of G4 loops defin ing the accessibility of quadruplex grooves significantly affects the selectivity of the ligand [247] .\n\nIt must be noted that all the intramolecular G4s cocrystallized with small molecule ligands display paral lel topology [16, 215] . This is likely related with the dehy dration of the sample during crystallization (it is known that dehydration induces formation of parallel G4) and constraints imposed by the crystal lattice. Interaction of the ligand with G quadruplexes of different conforma tions was also characterized using molecular dynamics simulation [248] . As of now, structures of approximately 25 G4-ligand complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [248] .\n\nDespite the obvious desire to understand better the mechanism of molecular recognitions of G4 by aromatic ligands, only a few reports are available on investigation of thermodynamics of the complex formation. The ther modynamic and structural characteristics of binding of six different ligands with human telomeric DNA were compared in a paper in 2015 [226] . The analysis of exper imental data obtained from isothermal calorimetry, CD, fluorescent spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, and molec ular modeling allowed estimation of dominating forces (specific interactions, changes in solvation and confor mational state of the quadruplex) that controlled the binding of ligands to G4. Moreover, the existence of intermediate structures during G4 formation was taken into consideration for the first time. It was found that the parameters differed significantly for the poorly selective and quadruplex specific (highly selective) ligands.\n\nInvestigation of binding of aromatic ligands with multimeric G4s showed that the ligand was usually incor porated between two G4 subunits forming a sandwich like structure due to stacking interactions with terminal G tetrads of neighboring quadruplexes [249, 250] . Furthermore, the distance between the individual quadruplexes in the multimeric system affected the effi ciency of formation of these complexes [251] . However, it was shown recently that one of the enantiomers of the chiral nickel containing ligand was not incorporated between the two quadruplex units, but rather covered them from above, corresponding to two G tetrads in size. Furthermore, its binding with the G quadruplex dimer was 200 fold more efficient than with the individual G4 [252] .\n\nMetal complexes occupy a very important place among a huge number of organic molecules capable of binding to DNA quadruplexes, and they have been inves tigated thoroughly in the last ten years. The G4 ligands based on metal complexes combine advantages of organ ic compounds and coordinating action of a metal ion. They are relatively easy to produce and exhibit unusual optical, magnetic, and catalytic properties, which makes them appealing for creation of libraries of the G4 selec tive ligands, G quadruplex optical probes, and cleaving agents. Exhaustive classification of binding of metal com plexes to G4s (macrocyclic ligands, non macrocyclic polydentate ligands, bulky metal assemblies with flat sur faces, supramolecular chiral cylinders, luminescent metal complexes, and others) was presented in reviews [253, 254] together with their structural peculiarities, addition al geometric and electronic possibilities for the specific binding to G4s, and mechanisms of their interactions with DNA quadruplexes. Several types of metal complex es were designed to introduce damage and breaks into DNA. For example, a method for determination of strand orientation in G4s using the reactive metal complex Zn TTAP based on phthalocyanine was developed [255] . This method is based on ligand induced photocleavage of the DNA strand between guanosines along the quadru plex axis, predominately after the guanosine belonging to the \"upper\" G tetrad.\n\nAlkylating G4 ligands are now considered as a class of chemotherapeutic agents [234] . Targeted DNA modi fication induced by these compounds can prevent correct translation of genetic information, causing death of tumor cells. In addition to medical application, the cova lent modification of G4 using reactive ligands has been suggested as an effective strategy for detection and moni toring of G4 formation in the entire genome and tran scriptome. Marking of G4 sites can be performed via affinity isolation of the respective DNA fragments with covalently bound highly specific ligands [256] . It is important for reactive molecules to minimize non specif ic nucleophilic attack and make the alkylation process reversible, so that the DNA fragment isolated from the genome would not carry covalently bound small mole cule ligand on it. The electrophilic intermediate quinone methide was suggested as an alkylating agent attached to the G4 ligand, which is capable of reversible alkylation and can form adducts with DNA that are stable in aque ous solutions [257] . The fact that quinone methide can be easily produced from suitable water soluble precursors via mild activation (photochemical, reductive, oxidative, thermal, and other) signifies its advantage [258] . Recently developed chemical strategies for isolation and intracellu lar localization of G quadruplexes based on modified G4 ligands were summarized in a review [256] . The devel oped approaches allow a biotin residue to be introduced into a ligand, facilitating further affinity isolation of the DNA quadruplex on streptavidin coated magnetic beads [205] , transfer a fluorophore from the ligand to G4 by chemical reactions stimulated by short distance effects, or introduce the quinone methide precursor into the small molecule for its further chemical modification. Considering, that the availability of bulky substituents could affect the transport of the ligand into the cell, as well as affinity and selectivity of their interaction with G4, the strategy based on introduction of low volume alkyne residues into the ligand seems more promising. These groups can be transferred from the ligand to G4 via, for example, reaction between the nucleophilic group in the quadruplex loop and an electrophilic center on the linker connecting the alkyne with the ligand [256] . Small molecules containing alkyne functions can be immobi lized via the cycloaddition technique onto beads carrying azide groups, or they can be attached to fluorescent labels directly in the cell. Fluorogenic G4 ligands were used for optical visualization of G quadruplex aptamers intro duced into lung cancer cells [259] . The efficiency of cap ture of G rich oligonucleotides was monitored by confo cal microscopy, and the intracellular localization of the quadruplexes thus formed was revealed. It was shown that parallel G4s were observed mostly in cell lysosomes, while antiparallel structures were found in mitochondria. These findings are important from the point of view of drug delivery to specialized cell organelles using G quadruplex aptamers.\n\nAn innovative strategy for the synthesis of \"smart\" G4 ligands was developed recently based on template mediated assembly of water soluble compounds imitating G tetrad (Template Assembled Synthetic G Quartet, TASQ); moreover, this process occurs only in the pres ence of a G quadruplex target. For example, a novel mol ecule was designed and produced [260] with a structure that could rearrange when it interacts with a G4, but not interacts with duplex DNA. The \"smart\" ligand forms artificial G tetrad via template mediated intramolecular reaction, which binds to the terminal G tetrad of the quadruplex, stabilizing it in the process (Fig. 6) . The metal (terbium) coordination in the G4 channel facili tates organization of the active closed state, and the pre cisely located positive charges on the side substituents enhance affinity of the ligand to G4 even further. Application of these compounds as artificial receptors for testing the interaction of terminal G tetrads in the quadruplex with low molecular weight ligands was demonstrated [261] . The new generation of G quadru plex biomimetic ligands is also capable of playing a role of \"smart\" fluorescent labels [262] . The ligand fluorescence is quenched in the inactive open state due to intramolec ular photoinduced electron transfer, while the fluores cence is restored in the closed state induced by the self assembly of the artificial G tetrad. The first such ligand -PyroTASQ based on pyrene -was shown to be an effec tive G4 specific probe for in vitro studies [262] . However, it showed a tendency for aggregation in intracellular medium. The specifically designed N TASQ with pyrene replaced by a naphthalene residue was found to be suit BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 able for intracellular studies. N TASQ was used for the direct detection of RNA G4s in the non pretreated (fixa tion, permeabilization, etc.) human and mouse cells [263] .\n\nCellular and viral proteins. The availability of func tionally important proteins capable of specific binding to G4 is one of most significant factors supporting the hypothesis of biological relevance of these structures. Most regulatory functions of G4s in cells are mediated by the binding of proteins that modulate their thermody namic stability and conformation. As of now, numerous proteins have been identified that specifically bind to DNA quadruplexes [264 266] and to the RNA analogs of G4 [267, 268] . Affinity chromatography (for example, using biotinylated G4 forming oligonucleotides that are linked to streptavidin coated beads) was applied for isola tion of target proteins followed by the mass spectral analysis (LC MS/MS) [269, 270] . Identification and characterization of many cellular RNA G4 binding pro teins (nuclear ribonucleoproteins, ribosomal proteins, splicing factors) using developed screening system was described in a recent paper [271] . The selected proteins were characterized by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry, and their dissociation constants with RNA G4 (nanomo lar range) were determined with the surface plasmon res onance technique.\n\nThe proteins recognizing G4s belong to different classes and perform different functions in the cell: regula tion of telomere length, ribosome assembly [272] , tran scription, translation, splicing, and alternative splicing [20, 269, 273 276] , DNA replication and reparation [277, 278] , replicative bypass base damaged sites [279] , reverse transcription [206] , conjugation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, DNA duplex unwinding, changing DNA topology, and other processes of nucleic acid metabolism. The G4 binding proteins are classified into three functional groups: (i) telomere related pro teins, such as proteins of shelterin complex [267, 280, 281] ; (ii) G4 unwindig or cleaving enzymes, such as DNA and RNA helicases (molecular motors that unwind structured nucleic acids and thus are involved in numerous biological processes), nucleases [273, 282, 283] ; (iii) proteins that stabilize G quadruplexes and prone their folding (molecular chaperons), for example, nucleolin (multifunctional nuclear protein) and nucleo phosmin [269, 276, 284] . The proteins and enzymes with Fig. 6 . \"Smart\" G4 ligand capable of artificial G tetrad formation via template mediated intramolecular reaction; the terminal G tetrad of G4 used as a template in the process. a) Chemical structure of the \"smart\" ligand, which rearranges itself into active (closed) state gen erating an artificial G tetrad. b) Schematic representation of the mode of \"smart\" ligand action with G4 binding domain of the molecule presented by a yellow circle and the guanine residues forming a new G tetrad as pink rectangles. a b enhanced affinity to G quadruplexes in comparison with double and single stranded DNA not only discriminate such non canonical structures, but can also recognize their topology [269] .\n\nDespite intensive investigation of protein-G4 com plexes, the molecular mechanisms for recognition of G quadruplexes by protein molecules remain poorly under stood, and investigations in this area are fragmentary and unsystematic. It was established using high resolution methods that protein-nucleic acid binding is affected by the G4 loops [112] and duplex-G quadruplex junction [189, 285] . It was shown by molecular modeling that the cavities in the HIV 1 integrase and RecA protein matched exactly the G4 size [55] , and the domain of the nucleophosmin fit the G4 groove [286] . It was shown recently using NMR spectroscopy that two peptide mole cules with sequences corresponding to prion protein frag ments were bound to the terminal G tetrads of RNA G4 via hydrophobic interactions (favorable change of water entropy) [287] . An 18 unit G4 binding amino acid sequence of RNA helicase (RHAU) was identified in 2015 using the same method; it covered the end G tetrad of parallel DNA G4 and enveloped the quadruplex core due to electrostatic interactions between the three posi tively charged amino acids and the negatively charged phosphate groups [288] . Interestingly, this binding model closely resembles one for most G4 specific low molecular weight ligands. Investigation of the crystal structure of a complex of arginine and glycine rich peptide fragment of the FMRP protein with RNA containing G quadru plex and duplex domains with 2.8 \u00c5 resolution elucidated the molecular principles explaining the specificity of pro tein-nucleic acid interactions and identified a wide net work of contacts between the peptide and RNA, which included not only the G tetrad and boundary between the G4 and the duplex domain, but were extended into the RNA duplex domain [289] . It must be noted that FMRP is a well characterized regulatory RNA binding protein that plays a central role in the development of a series of human neurological disorders including autism. It was suggested that the interaction of this protein with RNA quadruplexes directly affected regulation of translation of hundreds of key mRNAs in neuronal cells, and the dis ruption of these interactions was considered as one of the major mechanisms initiating pathological changes caus ing mental disorders [20] . The role of aromatic amino acids -tyrosine and phenylalanine -in the C terminal domain of proteins associated with liposarcoma and Ewing sarcoma in recognition of telomeric DNA and RNA quadruplexes was investigated [290] . It was shown that phenylalanine residues were extremely important for specific binding to G4. Thus, the replacement of three Phe by Ala residues prevented interaction of the peptide with the G quadruplex structure. Also, it was possible to discriminate telomeric DNA G4s and RNA G4s by replacing the Phe residues with Tyr ones. This substituted peptide recognizes and binds predominately RNA quadruplexes due to the higher hydrophilicity of tyrosine in comparison with phenylalanine. It was shown using model structures containing modifications in the loops of DNA and RNA quadruplexes (apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, 2\u2032 O methyl derivatives, or nucleosides with locked ribose ring (LNA, Locked Nucleic Acids)) that the Tyr residues recognized primarily the ribose 2\u2032 hydroxyl groups.\n\nAccording to the modern paradigm, the G4s and recognizing proteins are key players in many very impor tant metabolic processes. In particular, G4 structures are considered as an endogenous source of chromosomal instability [291] associated with numerous human dis eases [292, 293] . Accumulated data indicate that if four stranded non canonical DNAs are not resolved by pro teins, they can interfere with transcription and replication processes [294, 295] , as well as reparation and homolo gous DNA recombination. This results in double strand ed DNA breaks, genome rearrangements, and expansion of G rich repeats [296 298 ]. Moreover, genomic damages are greater the higher is thermodynamic stability of the G4 [139] . At the same time, it has been mentioned that stable G4s are not the only reason for defective replica tion, and alternative mechanisms could exist that explain this phenomenon. For example, the DNA polymerase \u03b4 stalls near telomeric G4 motifs independent of the quadruplex structure formation on the lagging strand [299] ; investigation at the cellular level showed that these sequences were generally difficult to replicate. Unlike the high fidelity replicative DNA polymerases, the special ized DNA polymerases from eukaryotic cells, which can insert nucleosides opposite certain types of point dam ages, can prevent genomic instability in the vicinity of G4. Indirect indications exist that some of them, for example Pol \u03ba, Pol \u03b7, and Rev1 (members of Y family), can ensure efficient replication progress through DNA quadruplexes [300] . The structural features of the most investigated Rev1 explain why this polymerase operates predominately on G rich templates.\n\nHelicases that prevent chromosomal instability caused by G4 forming sequences occupy a specific place among the proteins specifically binding and unwinding G quadruplex structures [282, 298] . The mechanism and kinetics of G4 resolving by Pif1 family of replicases con served from bacteria to humans have been discussed in [301 303 ]. Interestingly, these helicases are activated in the process of G4 resolving and more readily unwind double stranded DNA during replication. Unlike the highly processive Pif1 family of replicases that remain bound to their DNA substrate, G4 resolvase 1 (also known as DHX36 or RHAU), which is capable of strong ly binding and resolving DNA G4 and RNA G4, is non processive, because it dissociates from the substrate after each act of ATP hydrolysis [304] . The unwinding of intramolecular G4 by the ATP dependent DNA helicase BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 BLM from the RecQ family is realized via different mechanisms depending of the G quadruplex DNA sur rounding (single or double stranded), as has been shown by FRET [305] . The technique based on fluorescence methods allowed monitoring the unwinding of different G quadruplexes by DNA helicases in real time [34] ; G4 binding with small molecule quadruplex stabilizing lig and inhibited the enzyme activity, the inhibition degree depending on the G4 structure and the ligand type. Different efficiency of denaturation of G4s with different folding topologies by replication protein A (RPA) was revealed by single molecule FRET [306] . G4 stabilizing factors, such as short loops (less than three nucleotide units) and more than three G tetrad layers, helped to pre serve the G quadruplex conformation even at the physio logically relevant protein concentration, which increases the functional significance of these structures [307] .\n\nThe effect of G quadruplexes on functioning of G4 binding proteins was investigated in several recent studies. Thus, it was shown using single molecule technique that telomeric DNA G4, which modulated telomerase activity in vitro, could affect the binding of other proteins involved into telomere biology [118, 308] . And vice versa, proteins binding to telomeric ends controlled DNA G4 formation in the cell. Data are available on the effect of G4 on translo cation of the telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) from the nucleus to mitochondria, which plays an important role in cellular apoptosis induced by the G quadruplex binding ligands [309] . It was established that G4s of different topol ogy could inhibit topoisomerase I mediated nicking of double stranded DNA [310, 311] , thus affecting the degree of DNA supercoiling. The specialized low fidelity DNA polymerases hPol \u03b7 and hPol \u03b5 from the Y and B families, respectively, which are capable of replicative bypassing base damaged sites, retain various activity towards G4 containing substrates depending on the degree of specific binding with G quadruplexes [279] . It was shown that in 20% of human genes G4 was a target for two components of the TFIIH transcriptional factor (XPD and XPB) [283] ; furthermore, XPD acted as DNA G4 helicase, and XPB as G4 binding protein. Considering that both these compo nents play a major role in coordinating the system of DNA damage identification and reparation mechanisms related to local melting of the double helix, it has been suggested that G4 can regulate these processes. A mechanism of G4 mediated regulation of gene expression and other processes of DNA metabolism has been discussed [312] . This mech anism is based on interaction of DNA G4s with yeast tran scription coactivator Sub1 and its human homolog PC4.\n\nIn recent years, our understanding of the biological relevance of G quadruplexes in prokaryotes [10, 98] and viruses [313] has increased. It was shown that G4s are specifically recognized by various viral proteins such as Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen I [103] , coronavirus SARC unique domain (SUD) existing exclusively in highly patho genic strains [314] , and nucleolin, which stabilizes G4 structures formed by LTRs promoter and silences HIV 1 viral transcription [276] . Moreover, it was established that the G rich DNA sequence in the U3 region of the HIV 1 virus that is capable of folding into G4 contains three bind ing sites of the Sp1 transcriptional factor, which is involved in regulation of the viral gene expression [100] . The G quadruplex aptamers targeting HIV 1 proteins that were considered as potential inhibitors of the viral gene replica tion in cells and viral integration in vitro [315] demonstrat ed antiviral activity [316] .\n\nG4 specific antibodies. G quadruplexes are immuno genic like any other non canonical DNA form. Anti bodies are described in the literature that exhibit 1000 fold higher affinity to the four stranded DNA in compar ison with duplex structures; furthermore, some of them are highly specific to parallel G4, while others bind either to parallel or antiparallel G quadruplex structures. Moreover, antibodies were isolated and characterized that display the ability to discriminate with 100 fold specifici ty parallel G4s differing only in the structure of their loops [317] . Usually antibodies are produced from a huge library of bacteriophages, with each bacteriophage dis playing a unique antibody on its surface (phage display). Bacteriophages carrying G4 recognizing antibodies are isolated via binding with immobilized DNA quadruplex es [317] . Antibodies of different specificity were success fully used as tools for quantitative detection of DNA and RNA quadruplexes in cells using different versions of immunofluorescence assay [318 320 ].\n\nAntibodies to G quadruplexes were also used to demonstrate that four stranded DNAs modulates gene expression in vivo. The presence of such antibodies in human colon carcinoma cells caused significant changes in the expression of a large group of genes (from the investigated set consisting of more than 18,000 genes) whose regulatory regions are enriched with G4 motifs [321] .\n\nIntramolecular G quadruplexes formed by single stranded telomeric repeats in in vitro studies represent a unique set of diverse topologies [148, 322] . The G4s formed by human telomeric repeats are the best studied [57, 323] , and this elevated interest is because they can act as suppressors of tumor growth [66, 324] .\n\nTelomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, which protect the cells from chromosome fusions and DNA damage responses. It is known that the telomeric DNA in somat ic cells progressively shorten with each round of cell divi sion due to inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the 3\u2032 end completely and due to nucleolytic processing. After reaching a critical length (the Hayflick limit), the replication ceases and the cells enter a senescence phase that precedes apoptosis. In contrast, a telomere length maintenance mechanism is induced in tumor cells via activation of telomerase -an enzyme of ribonucleopro tein nature capable of synthesizing G rich repeats at the 3\u2032 end of telomeric DNA according to the reverse tran scription mechanism or via alternative lengthening of telomeres based on recombination (ALT). Increase in telomerase activity is observed in more than 85% of tumor cells, and the ALT mechanism is realized in 15% of tumors. Since telomerase activity is either completely absent or significantly lowered (as in stem and germ cells) in the absolute majority of cells in the organism, inhibi tion of this enzyme would facilitate deceleration of tumor growth without toxic effects on the organism [325] .\n\nFolding of the single stranded overhang at the chro mosome ends into G quadruplex structure can effective ly block the undesired extension of telomeric DNA via preventing its hybridization with telomerase RNA, which serves as a template for synthesis of telomeric sequences [326] . Quadruplex formation also prevents realization of the alternative lengthening of telomeres due to inhibition of early recombination stages [18, 326] . It was shown that the recombination proteins attached to DNA only after unwinding of the telomeric G quadruplexes by helicases. That is why stabilization of quadruplex structures in human telomeric DNA by a small molecule ligand is a promising antitumor strategy [66] . The use of G4 stabi lizing ligands can also cause telomere dysfunction inde pendent of the telomeric DNA lengthening with telom erase. For example, telomestatin can remove the telomere shelterin protein TRF2, which results in damage of telomeric DNA in glioma stem cells and, consequently, slowing the growth of glioblastoma -a malignant brain tumor. It was found that the non glioma cells were insen sitive to the treatment with G4 stabilizing ligand [327] . Moreover, it was suggested that G quadruplexes could be involved in capping and telomere protection from degra dation or end fusion. The G quadruplex function as a protective mechanism of chromosome ends, postulated many decades ago, was clearly shown for yeast telomeres, at least when all other forms of capping were defective [326] .\n\nThe telomeric G4s are formed via intramolecular folding of tandem G rich repeats, although it has been mentioned in earlier studies that in some ciliates the telomeric 3\u2032 overhangs form intermolecular G quadru plexes, which link together the macronuclear chromo somes.\n\nThe use of G quadruplexes of telomeric DNA as tar gets of antitumor reagents requires knowledge of the detailed G4 structure under conditions mimicking intra cellular ones. The issue is complicated by the fact that the structure and stability of the most investigated G quadru plexes formed by the four human telomeric DNA repeats, d(TTAGGG), strongly depend on the presence of flank ing nucleotide residues, DNA concentration [119] , envi ronmental conditions such as ionic composition, avail ability of G4 specific ligands [228] , the degree of DNA hydration controlled by PEG addition [328] , on sample pretreatment, and methods of investigation [119] . Moreover, it must be taken in consideration that the telomeric repeats form intermediate hairpin and G triplex structures in addition to the final G4 [299] .\n\nIt was shown that the topology of G quadruplex formed by the d(AGGG(TTAGGG) 3 ) oligonucleotide and by oligomers with similar base sequence differ signif icantly in the crystal state and in solution. According to the X ray data, d(AGGG(TTAGGG) 3 ) in the presence of K + folds into parallel intramolecular G quadruplex with propeller type loops (PDB ID: 1KF1). At the same time, antiparallel G4 and different variants of mixed (paral lel-antiparallel) forms of G quadruplexes with various loop structures were identified in K + solution [47] ; fur thermore, the ratio between them was affected by the 3\u2032 end nucleotides attached to the oligonucleotide. However, the parallel intramolecular G quadruplex, like the one identified in the crystal state, was observed under conditions of lower water activity (dehydration) caused by addition of ethanol, DMSO, acetonitrile, or high molecular weight PEG of different length [191, 329] . Because PEG was usually added to the oligonucleotide solution to adjust the condition to intracellular molecular crowding, until recently the intramolecular parallel struc ture of the G4 formed by the human telomeric repeats was considered as a physiologically significant one [191, 329] . However, as shown recently, the presence of PEG not so much imitates the high concentration of biopoly mers as it facilitates dehydration of the sample, changing the water structure the same way as other cosolvents [18, 330] . The PEG initiated transition of the quadruplex structure from the more compact mixed form into the hydrodynamically less compact parallel one cannot be explained by the excluded volume effect, but rather can be explained by the higher affinity of PEG to the parallel G4 conformation, as shown in [331] . Moreover, the use of other compounds instead of PEG more suitable for mim icking the natural biological environment and creating high concentration of biopolymers such as 40% polysac charide (Ficoll 70) or bovine serum albumin (300 mg/ml) did not facilitate stabilization of the G4 parallel form [194, 332, 333] . The fact that it was precisely dehydration and not the excluded volume effect that induced forma tion of the parallel quadruplex was shown in 2013 [164] . In that study, the structural and mechanical properties of human telomeric quadruplex were investigated at the sin gle molecule level using optical tweezers.\n\nEither increase in the cosolvent amount or high DNA concentration (6 9 mM) can cause conversion of antiparallel G4 into the parallel one [334] . The oligonu cleotide itself can play a role of the agent mimicking molecular crowding in such concentrated solutions. BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 Despite differences in the action mechanism, both these factors result in the dehydration effect, that is decrease in water activity [335] . The concentration dependence of the G4 topology can provide an explanation why different experimental methods, which require DNA samples with concentrations differing by orders of magnitude, reveal different types of quadruplex folding for the same oligonucleotide. It is of interest that G4 stabilized with sodium ions maintains antiparallel topology independent of the DNA concentration [119] .\n\nIt is commonly accepted that the structural polymor phism of telomeric repeats is much less pronounced in solution containing Na + than in K + solution. For exam ple, the d(AGGG(TTAGGG) 3 ) oligonucleotide in Na + solution forms exclusively the antiparallel three tetrad G4 with \"basket\" type conformation. However, forma tion of the antiparallel intramolecular structure differing from the standard quadruplex by the nature of hydrogen bonds in G tetrads and by the loop locations was shown recently by NMR spectroscopy for longer oligomers con taining nucleotide units flanking the G4 core [127] . Different conformations of G quadruplexes formed by telomeric sequences and their dynamics in Na + solutions was investigated using single molecule FRET [336] . This method allows characterization of nucleic acids structur al polymorphism and the kinetics of conformational tran sitions on a time scale from milliseconds to minutes. In addition to the unfolded state, at least three different telomeric quadruplexes were identified under dynamic equilibrium. These data change our perspective on the limited conformational options of telomeric G4s in Na + solutions and indicate the polymorphic nature of the telomeric repeats under these conditions (see reviews on telomere structure in [57, 281] ). In a study published in 2016, conformational potential of telomeric DNA was investigated under conditions of low cation concentra tion, and it was shown that the conversion of the antipar allel G4 into the parallel one occurred when a minor amount of KCl was added to the Na + solution [22] .\n\nTaking into consideration the fact that the level of K + in mammalian cells (approximately 100 150 mM) is sig nificantly higher than the content of Na + , the G4 structure formed in the presence of K + seems more relevant physio logically. The conformation of d(AGGG(TTAGGG) 3 in live X. laevis oocytes and ex vivo in cellular extract of these oocytes where the natural conditions of molecular crow ing were realized was investigated in 2013 [194] . It must be noted that the recently developed in cell NMR technique was used for in vivo studies, which allowed evaluating of the nucleic acids structure in the eukaryotic intracellular environment. It was shown using this approach and using fluorescence spectroscopy that d(AGGG(TTAGGG) 3 ) adapted the G quadruplex structure with mixed topology (3 + 1). The same structure is formed in diluted K + solu tion (but not in the presence of Na + ). Investigation of a fragment of telomeric DNA containing 8 and 12 G tracts revealed that the conformation of the quadruplex units in the long strand was different from the conformation of the isolated G4. The end and inner quadruplexes exist pre dominantly as a two tetrad antiparallel \"basket\" and a structure with mixed topology with three G tetrad layers arranged as \"beads on a string\" [194] . The unusual two tetrad antiparallel G4 binding only one cation in the quadruplex cavity was documented with a combination of physicochemical methods at extremely low concentration of potassium or strontium ions [22] .\n\nThe proof that telomeres fold into G quadruplexes of various types under in vivo conditions allows new com prehension of the data according to which not all G4 conformations actively inhibit telomere lengthening by telomerase, including human telomerase [18] . In particu lar, parallel tetramolecular G4s are good substrates of the enzyme from Tetrahymena; the parallel intramolecular quadruplexes are also lengthened by telomerase. At the same time, the intramolecular antiparallel quadruplexes (that is the ones that have been postulated) are resistant to lengthening under the action of telomerase [194] . These are precisely the G4 formed by the single stranded telom ere ends that are capable of inhibiting telomerase acting as tumor suppressors.\n\nStructure and stability of G quadruplexes in elongat ed telomeric DNA. In the last decade, conflicting reports have been published on the structural arrangement and stability of G quadruplexes in such DNA in vitro. Data of CD spectroscopy and of electrophoretic studies indicate that the long telomeric sequences predominantly fold into intramolecular rather than intermolecular quadruplexes. Experimental confirmations were obtained for both the \"beads on a string\" model in which the individual G4s were independent [194] , and for the model in which the contiguously stacked G quadruplex units affected each other [111, 193, 337] . The results of optical tweezers investigation demonstrated that only 5% of higher order G4 structures were formed by the DNA fragment con taining 24 d(TTTAGGG) repeats, the length comparable with the total single stranded human telomeric overhang, while the clear majority of the quadruplexes behaved as \"beads on a string\" [162] . The contradictions related to the arrangement of multiquadruplex telomeric systems were partially explained in a work published in 2016 [31] . It was found that realization of one model or another depended on the ionic composition of the medium. The individual G4s practically do not affect each other in the K + solutions, while Na + facilitated interaction of quadru plex subunits. These are precisely the interactions that make the quadruplex structure formed by the d((GGGTAA) 7 GGG) oligonucleotide more stable in the Na + containing solutions than in the presence of KCl.\n\nThere is some disagreement in the published data on the number of formed G4 units in the long telomeric sequences. Thermodynamic studies revealed that more than 90% of the oligonucleotides d(TTAGGG) 12 and d((TTAGGG) 12 TT) fold into three adjacent G quadru plexes, in other words into the structure with the maximum possible numbers of G4s, and only 10% form the two quadruplex structure [111] . Nevertheless, it has been men tioned that in the case of very long telomeric repeats (\u223c200 nucleotide residues), formation of the maximum amount of G4s becomes energetically unfavorable [111] . The direct visualization of the d(TTAGGG) 16 telomeric repeats with single molecule atomic force microscopy [197] supported the \"beads on a string\" model, where the G4 were sepa rated by single stranded DNA regions, which in turn cre ated more flexible structure with the number of quadru plexes not at the maximum level possible. Such only partial folding of the long telomeric DNA provides the possibility of binding of the telomere protective protein POT1 with single stranded sites. In addition to the proteins of shel terin complex, a whole series of telomere processing enzymes requires free 3\u2032 end for binding and further func tioning. The minimal size of the single stranded binding site (6 12 nucleotides) for these enzymes was determined in in vitro experiments [338] . Considering that G quadru plexes are formed more readily at the 3\u2032 end of DNA [197] , and that the probability of folding into quadruplex structures decreases on moving towards the 5\u2032 end of the telomeric DNA (from 55% to 21.8, 14.5, and 7.9% for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th G4 position, respectively), the length of the single stranded 3\u2032 end region can vary from 0 to 18 nucleotides (three d(TTAGGG) repeats) in the case of human telomeric DNA [197] . It was noted that the size of single stranded site as a result of coordinated action of G4 formation and its unwinding by helicases affected telomere lengthening by telomerase or DNA polymerase (ALT mechanism) [338] .\n\nG quadruplexes with modified nucleotide residues. The effect of guanine analogs (2 aminopurine, 8 bromo and 8 methyl guanine, hypoxanthine, and others), sub stituted or modified ribose residues (LNA), and modified non guanine bases in the G4 motif on the folding topol ogy and stability of intra and intermolecular G quadru plexes [339 341] , as well as on the functioning of proteins recognizing G4 structures [342] was explored in several recent works and reviews. It was mentioned that certain types of DNA damages could act as modulators of G4 formation. The effect of natural modifications of bases (oxidative damages, apurinic sites, alkylated derivatives, and others) localized either in the loops or in the quadru plex core of human telomeric G quadruplexes has been discussed in detail [ 343 345] . As a rule, the analogs of bases that replace guanines in the G tetrad significantly destabilize G4. The loop modifications change the struc ture of the quadruplex and its stability less dramatically, and the effect depends on the type of damage and its loca tion in the base sequence. For example, apurinic sites in loops of DNA G4 facilitate formation of propeller loops and stabilize the parallel G quadruplexes [346] . And 8 oxoA either slightly destabilizes or stabilizes G4 depend ing on localization of the oxidized base. It must be men tioned that the reparation of natural damages in telomer ic G quadruplexes remains poorly understood.\n\nIt was shown using bioinformatics approaches that more than 40% of genes encoding human proteins con tained at least one G4 motif in a promoter region. The G motifs located in the promoters of human oncogenes and the genes of proteins expressed in tumor cells or involved in tumor angiogenesis, unlimited replication, deregulation of apoptosis, and metastasizing are the most popular study objects: c Myc [113, 138, 140, 157] , Bcl 2 [87] , c Kit 1, c Kit 2 [142, 347, 348] , c Myb, WT1 [349] , VEGF [114, 350] , VEGFR 2 [351] , RET [352] , Rb, HIF 1\u03b1, KRAS, PDGF A [353] , and PDGFR \u03b2 [354] , tran scription factors Nrf2 [227] , SRC [203] , as well as the pro moter of HIV 1 genes [99, 355] , 3\u2032 proximal promoter region of the human tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH) associated with neurological disorders [356] , promoter of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) [357, 358] . Under certain conditions, the mini satellite repeats from the ILPR, which is localized 363 bp upstream from the insulin encoding sequence, can also be assigned to this category [359] .\n\nOligonucleotides containing four consecutive G tracts, sometimes with flanking regions, were usually used for in vitro investigations of the secondary structures formed by G4 motifs from gene promoters [45] . As shown using NMR and CD spectroscopy and by chemi cal probing, these oligonucleotide models usually folded in K + solutions into parallel intramolecular quadruplexes [8, 227, 350] , although conformational heterogeneity of the promoter G4s was reported in some publications. The common features of the parallel G4s dominating in the population include three G tetrads connected by two sin gle nucleotide loops (first and third) and the middle loop variable in length [323, 350, 360] . For example, loops 1 : 2 : 1 are characteristic for the c Myc quadruplex, and for the G4 VEGF -1 : 4 : 1 [350] . Despite the indicated com mon features of promoter quadruplexes, it has been sug gested that each G4 can assume a unique structure due to interaction of the nucleotides from the middle loop with flanking sequences [350] . Conformation of G4s from the gene promoter regions was also investigated by X ray crystallography [361] . It was established that a dichotomy between the structure in crystal state and in solution, which was characteristic for telomeric quadruplexes, was not extended to the other eukaryotic G quadruplexes.\n\nConsidering that many G motifs in promoter regions contain more than four G tracts, they can form several discrete quadruplexes depending on what combi nation of G tracts is used for in vitro studies, its length, BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 and availability or absence of flanking regions. The vari ous G4 conformations can be at dynamic equilibrium with each other [138, 350] . The set of quadruplex con formers formed in the c Myc promoter as well as the effect of loops and flanking nucleotides on thermody namic stability and kinetics of the G4 folding was evalu ated [138] . The dependence of the results on the selected sequence can be clearly illustrated using the promoter region P1 of the Bcl 2 gene as an example. The 39 nt G rich sequence (Pu39) contains six G tracts from 3 5 con secutive guanosine residues. Investigation of the confor mational potential of the set of oligonucleotides (shorter than Pu39) with partly overlapping sequences containing four consecutive G tracts showed that they could form various quadruplex structures, which could bind G4 spe cific ligands with different degree of selectivity [362, 363] . Moreover, these G quadruplexes were not parallel but had mixed topology (3 + 1), which excluded them from the common trend. The MidG4 formed by four central G tracts was the most stable. However, when the full sized Pu39 was used as a model, the prevailing structure into which it folded comprised an intramolecular parallel quadruplex with two single nucleotide loops and a middle 13 nt loop. The G tracts I, II, IV, and V participated in formation of this quadruplex, as shown by chemical foot printing and NMR spectroscopy, and the guanosine residues of G tract III were included in the middle loop [87] . Moreover, the full sized parallel G4 was found to be even more thermodynamically stable than MidG4. The presence of several topologically different quadruplexes in the same regulatory region can be important for fine tuning of gene expression mediated by the binding of dif ferent G4s with different proteins. According to recent data, in the close vicinity of the P1 promoter of the Bcl 2 gene there is another 28 nt G4 forming sequence P1G4, which can fold under physiological conditions into two parallel G4s that are in a state of equilibrium with each other. It was shown using chemical footprinting and NMR spectroscopy that one of the quadruplexes con tained two single nucleotide loops and 12 nt middle loop, while the other had unusual conformation with three single nucleotide loops and 11 nt site protruding from the G4 core [364] . The long loops in both quadru plexes assume the hairpin duplex conformation, which differentiates them from other parallel G4s and can be specifically recognized by small molecules. The authors suggested that the presence of Pu39 and P1G4 in the neighboring regions of the P1 promoter provides an addi tional mechanism for regulation of the Bcl 2 gene tran scription. Furthermore, the P1G4 sequence plays a criti cal role in the repression of transcriptional activity [364] .\n\nThe occurrence of various G4s formed in gene pro moters was discussed in a review published in 2010 [70] , and their classification was presented. Four classes of intramolecular quadruplexes were suggested: (i) single G4, (ii) pair of different G4 separated by \u223c30 base pairs, (iii) tandem of two G4s interacting with each other, (iv) multiple G4s formed by overlapping G4 motifs. Evidence of the interactions between quadruplexes formed by sequences from promoter regions with multiple G tracts has been presented in several reports [358, 365] . Formation of G4 multimers can be a characteristic fea ture of the promoter G4s, because it is exactly the paral lel G4s that demonstrate a tendency for \"sticking\" to each other. The interaction between two individual G quadruplexes formed by the promoter region of the hTERT gene containing 12 G tracts was investigated in most detail (Fig. 7a) . It must be mentioned that contro versial opinions have been expressed in the published data on the number of G4s formed by this sequence. On one hand, arguments have been presented in favor of the exis tence of three parallel G4s interacting with each other via stacking interactions of the end G tetrads [358] . On the other hand, the formation of a two quadruplex structure has been reported, in which the components formed a unified structure; the formation of parallel G4 with four consecutive G tracts (I IV) and formation of a quadru plex with unusual conformation formed by two pairs of consecutive G tracts (V, VI and XI, XII) separated by 26 nt loop (tracts VII X) was shown by CD spectroscopy, Taq polymerase inhibition, chemical footprinting, and optical tweezers methods (Fig. 7b) . This loop likely forms a stable hairpin, which can explain high stability of this atypical G quadruplex [195] . Direct evidence of interac tion between two G4s obtained with optical tweezers was reported in 2016 [195] . This approach was modified in such a way to break down the entire structure into indi vidual components and to monitor sequentially the dynamics of conformational transitions in each G4 com ponent without disrupting contacts between the G quadruplexes. To target the desired domain of the bio molecule, the reaction of alkyne azide cycloaddition to the alkyne group attached between two analyzed G4s and 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the construct was used. This allowed targeted addition of dsDNA handles with a terminal azide group and separate monitoring mechanical foldingunfolding of one of the G quadruplex components, leav ing the other part of the biomolecule free of stress (Fig. 7c) . It was the authors' opinion that this approach provided a significant advantage over the use of truncated mutants, in which a part of the structure is deleted. The developed technique for the analysis of high order G quadruplex structures provided the possibility to deter mine hierarchy of the unfolding of the analyzed system (the less stable G4 at the 5\u2032 end of the molecule unfolded first, followed by the more stable 3\u2032 end G4 with the structured middle loop), and it was possible to estimate the stabilization energy of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the terminal G tetrads in the interquadruplex interface (2 kcal/mol) [195] . It should be noted that the G4 multi mers in this work are considered as elements of the terti ary structure, which is uncharacteristic for genomic DNA BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 unlike in proteins and RNA molecules. Usually conclu sions on the spatial organization of multiplex G4 are based on knowledge of the structure of quadruplex units in its composition. It was shown in a study devoted to direct evidence of interaction between two G4s formed by the human ILPR sequence (d(ACAGGGGT GTGGGG) 4 ) [359] that this principle was not obeyed. The data were obtained by chemical footprinting and optical tweezers techniques indicating that the conforma tion adapted by the intramolecular quadruplexes could not be automatically predicted based on the structure of individual G4, and the characterized interquadruplex interactions differed from those observed in telomeric sequences. The availability of \"tertiary\" interactions between the neighboring G4s can produce an important biological impact. The extended rigid quadruplex struc tures can cause more serious errors in the replication processes, create new targets for G4 specific ligands and cellular proteins, and ensure fine tuning of the gene expression level.\n\nIt is generally accepted that tandem arranged G tracts composed of three or more consecutive guanosine residues participate in the formation of intramolecular G4 forming \"edges\" of the quadruplex core, while the linker sequences connecting G tracts become the quadruplex loops. However, an exception from this rule was found recently using NMR spectroscopy and X ray analysis. The sequences of Pu24 and c Kit87 from the human promoters c Myc and c Kit [361] , respectively, can fold into unusual G4s. The characteristic feature of such quadruplexes is that the guanosine tract in one of the \"edges\" is interrupted, despite the presence of four full G tracts. For example, the structure formed by c Kit87 investigated in vitro exhibits unique topology like none of the known G4s. Despite the availability of four (GGG) tracts in the c Kit87 sequence (d(A 1 G 2 G 3 G 4 A 5 G 6 G 7 G 8 C 9 G 10 C 11 T 12 G 13 G 14 G 15 A 16 G 17 G 18 A 19 G 20 G 21 G 22 )), which suggests formation of the standard parallel G4, the separately positioned residue G 10 partici pates in formation of one of the \"edges\" of the experimen tally detected quadruplex together with only two of the three guanosines (G 21 and G 22 ) at the 3\u2032 end of the mole cule. The unusual quadruplex structures formed by the 32 nt oligonucleotide d(G 1 C 2 G 3 G 4 T 5 G 6 T 7 G 8 G 9 G 10 A 11 A 12 G 13 A 14 G 15 G 16 G 17 A 18 A 19 G 20 A 21 G 22 G 23 G 24 G 25 G 26 A 27 G 28 G 29 C 30 A 31 G 32 ) from the KRAS gene promoter were recorded using NMR spectroscopy, CD, and other methods [366] . This oligomer folds in K + solution into two dimeric quadruplexes at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the molecule, while the central segment A 11 A 21 only connects two quadruplex units even though it is enriched with G residues. One of the characteristic features of these structures is the fact that the C 2 residue that disrupts the G tract at the 5\u2032 end bulges from the G quadruplex core. The described dimeric G4s cannot be formed in the genome context; however, it is the authors' opinion that conditions of molecular crowding can facilitate the intramolecular assembly of the quadru plex. It was shown in earlier studies that oligonucleotides of various lengths from the promoter region of the KRAS gene in KCl solution folded into G4s of different topology, including monomeric forms [367] .\n\nEffect of promoter G4 on gene expression. Plasmid constructs with inserted G rich promoter regions or their fragments are better for mimicking in vivo conditions. Unlike in the single stranded telomeric ends, the forma tion of G quadruplex structure in the promoter regions occurs in competition with preservation of the double helix and is regulated by the level of DNA supercoiling and binding with G4 recognizing proteins. The G4 for mation could be energetically favorable only in negative ly supercoiled genome fragments (or plasmids imitating them) [113] . The mechanism of regulation of c Myc gene transcription has been elucidated using plasmid models in a conceptual study [113] where the major role was assigned to G quadruplexes. Participation of G4 struc tures formed in promoter regions in inhibition of onco gene expression has been postulated in many recent pub lications. That is why the use of low molecular weight lig ands, which specifically bind and stabilize G4s, is a basis for antitumor strategy [8, 229] .\n\nA strong effect of the G4 location in the eukaryotic gene promoter on the level of transcription was shown in recent publications using reporter constructs [368] . Whereas the G motif in the antisense (template) strand inhibits transcription significantly, its localization in the sense (coding) strand does not affect the efficiency of the process. More complicated regularities related to the position effect of G motifs in regulatory sites were revealed during investigation of the role of G4s in the expression of bacterial genes [369] . It was established that the degree of transcription inhibition in the case of G4 location in the antisense chain of the promoter site corre lated with the G4 stability. However, when the G4 motif was introduced into the antisense strand between the TSS and stop codon, an increase in the level of gene expres sion was observed. As suggested by the authors, the G4 formed beyond the promoter facilitated double helix unwinding, thus supporting the unwinding activity of RNA polymerase. Enhancement of promoter activity was also observed in the case when G rich sequence with seven G tracts was located at the 3\u2032 proximate region of the human TH gene promoter [356] . It was suggested that one of the reasons for promoter activation was the forma tion of multiple quadruplexes by these G4 motifs, which could differentially regulate the gene expression.\n\nBecause gene expression is insensitive to the avail ability of G4s in the sense strand of the promoter region [368] , it follows that the quadruplex structure in the C rich antisense strand (i motif) of the promoter region either does not form intracellularly or does not affect the transcription process. However, participation of the i motif in transcription regulation was not ruled out in other publications. For example, it was shown using the BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 methods of molecular population dynamics and optical tweezers that the small molecules and proteins interacting with i motif target could modulate transcription of the Bcl 2 oncogene [370] . It was suggested that while the G4 could act as an inhibition signal for the oncogene expres sion, the i motif could activate this process [184] .\n\nCorrelation between point mutations in G4 motifs that affected conformation and stability of quadruplexes and variation in the gene expression profiles of humans was analyzed [371] . In addition to the development of areas affiliated with personalized medicine, these findings have been related to evolutionary aspects. It was implied that the elements of the quadruplex core remained evolu tionarily conserved, while loops in G4s were subjected to mutations.\n\nThe same as the DNA sequences, RNA analogs con taining G tracts are capable of folding into quadruplex structures under physiological conditions, with stabiliza tion factors and folding pathways similar to those observed for DNA quadruplexes [372] . As in the case of DNA G4s, the length and base sequence of the loops, concentration of K + and Na + , and number of G tetrads are the major factors of RNA quadruplex stability [96, 373] . Considering that molecules of ribonucleic acid are usually single stranded, RNA G4 formation should occur more easily than in the case of double stranded DNA, because hybridization with the complementary sequence will not compete with the process of quadruplex assembly. However, it has been mentioned that the nucleotide con text is one of the major factors controlling the G4 folding in RNA molecules. Thus, the availability of C tracts in the vicinity that are capable of hybridization with the G4 motifs interferes with the formation of four stranded RNA structures [95] .\n\nMany G4 motifs have been identified in the human transcriptome. According to data of bioinformatic analy sis, they are present in the 5\u2032 UTR of more than 2000 human genes [374] , as well as in 3\u2032 untranslated sites [375] . The G4 motifs were found in various regions of mRNA encoding or not encoding proteins, for example, in the open reading frame of certain mRNA [376] , in sites of alternative processing of pre mRNA, as well as in pre microRNA [82] , in long non coding RNA [83] , and in viral RNA. A new approach for detection and mapping of RNA G4s in cellular transcripts has been described [206] . It is based on the monitoring of the reverse transcriptase stops due to formation of RNA G4; it has been shown that this process correlated with the stability of RNA quadruplexes, which was controlled by metal ions and G4 specific ligands. A promising strategy for detection of RNA G4s under different conditions in vitro and in fixed and live cells based on the use of the fluorogenic cyanine dye has been developed [377] .\n\nTelomeres -the specialized DNA-protein struc tures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes -for a long time were considered transcriptionally inactive. However, recent studies have shown that telomeric DNA were tran scribed in mammalian cells with formation of long non coding RNA (TERRA) that contain repeats of the 5\u2032 UUAGGG 3\u2032 sequence. These G4 motifs exist as quadruplexes in K + solutions and in vivo [1, 57, 81, 378] . The fact that the human TERRA can fold into stable G quadruplex structures was demonstrated using CD and NMR spectroscopy, X ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry [1, 125, 379] . The formation of parallel G4 from human TERRA molecules in live cells was demon strated using oligonucleotide probes with light switchable pyrene groups [1] . Series of oligonucleotides were synthe sized for this purpose that contained the 5\u2032 GGGU UAGGG sequence with two G tracts and with pyrene residues attached to their ends via flexible linkers. The two pyrene molecules were spatially separated in the unstructured state, and their fluorescence signal was weak (monomeric emission). However, the pyrene molecules at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the oligonucleotide probes were brought together during the formation of the bimolecular parallel G4 in the presence of K + , forming the fluores cence excited excimer state (Fig. 8) . The change in color of the excimer fluorescence observed by fluorescence microscopy allowed real time monitoring of G4 forma tion in HeLa cells incubated with oligonucleotide probes.\n\nUnlike the polymorphic DNA quadruplexes, the RNA G4 adopt only parallel topology [57, 380] ; more over, this is also true for both short oligonucleotide mod els [57, 81, 380] and long telomeric RNA forming a gar land of intramolecular quadruplex structures [192] . It was shown that parallel orientation of G tracts in the quadru plexes formed by TERRA RNA did not depend on the base sequence of loops, nature of monovalent cations (K + or Na + ), state of the sample (crystalline or in aqueous buffer), and the presence of small molecule ligands [379, 381] . It is known that all guanosines in the G4 of parallel topology have anti conformation, while in the antiparal lel G4, half of the residues have anti and another halfsyn conformation. That is why the conformational pref erences of nucleosides (syn anti) can define the mutual arrangement of strands in the G quadruplex. Since rG residues in oligo and polyribonucleotides are predomi nantly in anti conformation due to the steric hindrance imposed by the 2\u2032 hydroxyl group, and the dG readily assume the syn conformation also, the parallel topology is characteristic for G quadruplexes with ribonucleotide residues. Transition of the antiparallel G4 formed by the aptamer to thrombin (5\u2032 d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG)) to the quadruplex with parallel topology was achieved via partial or complete replacement of the dG residues by rG.\n\nMoreover, this replacement resulted in conversion of the monomolecular G4 into a bimolecular one due to incom patibility of the loop lengths of the quadruplex with the parallel intramolecular folding of the ribo version of the aptamer [382] .\n\nThe RNA quadruplexes are usually more stable than the G4s formed by the same DNA sequence [380] . For example, T m and \u0394G (at 310 K) of the RNA quadruplex containing three G tetrads and single nucleotide loops in solution with 15 mM concentration of cations are 359 K and 9 kcal/mol, respectively, versus 350 K and 5 kcal/mol for the DNA analog [131] . More likely, the difference in the properties of two nucleic acids is the reason for that, rather than the difference in the folding topology of the quadruplexes [57, 380, 383] . The availability of the 2\u2032 OH group plays a significant role in organization of the hydration shell in the grooves of the four stranded struc ture, in formation of the network of hydrogen bonds, and in conformation of the sugar residues. According to the Fig. 7 . Evaluation of the energy of interaction between two quadruplexes formed by the promoter region of the hTERT gene containing 12 G tracts (a) using optical tweezers (b). The reaction of alkyne azide cycloaddition was used for mechanical unfolding-assembly of the target domain of the biomolecule; the alkyne group placed between two analyzed G4 allowed targeted addition of the dsDNA handles containing the azide group. Stretching-relaxation of different combinations of dsDNA handles (indicated by green arrows) immobilized on optically trapped beads to monitor the dynamics of conformational transitions and their energy in the G quadruplex tandem and in each G4 compo nent separately (c). Laser beams focused onto the beads are presented as yellow cones. molecular modeling data, the additional H bonds formed with participation of the 2\u2032 OH group and electron acceptor centers such as oxygen atoms of the sugar phos phate backbone (O3\u2032, O4\u2032, O5\u2032) and polar exocyclic groups of the bases (NH 2 group) provide significant con tribution to stabilization of G quadruplexes of parallel topology [381] . Crystallographic studies showed that the sugar residues in the guanosines from the end tetrads had C2\u2032 endo conformation, while the C3\u2032 endo conforma tion was characteristic for the guanosines in the center of the quadruplex core, which was significantly different from the corresponding parameters of the DNA quadru plex [381] . These findings agree with the data of NMR spectroscopy and computer modeling [381] . As in the case of DNA G4s, thermodynamic stability of RNA quadruplexes decreases with increasing loop lengths [96] ; furthermore, on one hand this effect is more pronounced, and on the other it is governed by more complex regular ities than in the case of DNA quadruplexes [96, 384] . The effects of the number of nucleotide residues in loops, length of G tracts, and potassium ion concentration on the thermodynamic stability of RNA quadruplexes and the degree of cooperativity of their folding have been characterized [96, 373] ; the G4 topology remained invariably parallel. It was shown on the example of the r(GGGGCC) n sequence from the C9orf72 gene transcript that depending on the RNA concentration, length of repeats, and availability of flanking sequences, this type of oligonucleotides could form either very stable parallel intramolecular quadruplexes with propeller type loops, or parallel tetramolecular RNA G4 [385] . A mechanism was suggested recently according to which G4 formation in the long (GGGGCC) repeat both on the level of DNA and RNA initiates a molecular cascade of neurodegener ative disorders [292] .\n\nSome sufficiently long RNA molecules can form several stable intramolecular conformations that coexist with each other [386] . For example, the double helical hairpin structure can compete with formation of RNA G4s [387] . The relative amount of mono and bivalent metal ions that stabilize competing structures to various degree affect the \"quadruplex-hairpin\" dynamic equilib rium characterized by NMR spectroscopy. It was shown that the shift of \"hairpin duplex-RNA quadruplex\" due to potassium ion content regulated maturation of human pre microRNA [82] . Small molecule ligands that can unfold or stabilize RNA quadruplexes can also shift the \"quadruplex-hairpin\" equilibrium [387, 388] . Interesting ly, some ligands affect differently the RNA G4s and the DNA G4s. For example, the cationic porphyrin TmPyP4 stabilized the DNA quadruplex formed by the G4 motif in the c Myc promoter, thus inhibiting transcription of this oncogene. The same ligand exerts the opposite action on RNA G4s [236] unwinding, for example, the extreme ly stable quadruplex formed by the mRNA that encodes MT3 MMP protein, which results in the mitigation of the suppression effect and increase the level of translation of this mRNA in eukaryotic cells [236] . The reaction of alkyne azide cycloaddition in situ was used for identifica tion of ligands selectively binding to the TERRA G4 but not to the telomeric DNA quadruplex [235] .\n\nConformational transitions from duplex to G quadruplex mediated by metal ions, by oligodeoxyri bonucleotides of certain primary structure, by proteins, and by other agents represent a moving force for switch ing the activity of the specially designed ribozymes and DNA zymes [389 391] .\n\nParallel RNA quadruplexes exhibit a strong tendency to stick together [379, 381] . For example, the oligonu cleotide with two telomeric repeats r(UAGGGU UAGGGU) form in K + or Na + solutions bimolecular par allel quadruplexes that dimerize via stacking interactions of the 5\u2032 end G tetrads. The lack of UA residues at the 5\u2032 end of the molecule facilitates formation of dimeric RNA quadruplexes even more. Moreover, as shown by NMR spectroscopy, two additional adenine residues from UUA loops were brought into the plane of the end G tetrads, thus increasing the surface area of the stacking contact [81] . It has been suggested that the hexad A\u00b7(G\u00b7G\u00b7G\u00b7G)\u00b7A is stabilized by H bonds between N1 of adenine and 2\u2032 OH of guanosine [379] . Dimerization of parallel RNA quadruplexes via stacking interactions of G\u00b7(A)\u00b7G\u00b7G\u00b7(A)\u00b7G hexads was also reported for the G4 formed by the r(GGAGGAGGAGGA) oligonucleotide in the presence of potassium ions. The propensity of RNA G4 to multi merization is an important factor inducing formation of the high order structures in long RNA sequences [192] . According to mass spectral analysis, the TERRA forms stable multimeric G4. It was suggested that they could be arranged as \"beads on a string\" in which each bead com prised either a single RNA G4 or a pair of quadruplexes combined via stacking interactions [192] . These RNA quadruplex dimers could serve as targets for ligands recog nizing the G tetrad planes by intercalating between them or inducing emergence of flat structures with large hydrophobic surface area (such as A\u00b7G\u00b7A\u00b7G\u00b7A\u00b7G\u00b7A\u00b7G octads) for more efficient binding [379] . As established with the spectral methods and electrophoretic data, the r(GGGUUGCGGAGGGUGGGC) sequence from the 5\u2032 end region (hTERC) of the human telomerase RNA folded into G4 dimer in K + solution [392] . It was specifi cally mentioned that the thermodynamically stable intramolecular parallel RNA quadruplex contained a sin gle nucleotide bulge (the cytidine residue underlined in the presented sequence) in one of the G4 \"edges\". Direct experimental evidence for formation of RNA G4s in the full sized hTERC was also reported [206] .\n\nBiological functions of RNA quadruplexes. The stud ies of recent years have shown that RNA G4s play an important role in cellular processes [275, 393] . They par ticipate in transcription termination and in regulation of different stages of RNA metabolism, for example, post BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 transcriptional gene expression, which included control over mRNA half lifetime, splicing, and polyadenylation of pre mRNA [15, 394] , as well as translation [372, 393, 395] . Folding of G4 motifs in RNA sequences into quadruplex structure affecting translation can be espe cially important in plants and other organisms, where cel lular ionic conditions, e.g. the concentration of potassi um ions, can be changed as a result of stress [373] .\n\nUntil recently, the G4s formed in different mRNA regions were considered as a network of translation repressors. It was shown that RNA G quadruplexes local ized in 5\u2032 UTR mRNA encoding the NRAS, Bcl 2, Zic 1, TRF2, MT3, and ESR proteins inhibited translation, although the exact mechanism of the inhibition by RNA G4s was not understood. It has been mentioned that the level of translation repression could reach 50% (for most G4 motifs) and even 80%. The RNA quadruplexes formed in the 3\u2032 UTR mRNA [375] and in the mRNA open reading frame also inhibit translation elongation in vitro and decrease protein synthesis in cells [376] . It was shown that G4 localized in the coding regions of mRNA can stimulate reading frame shift in vitro and in cell cul ture, with this effect correlating with quadruplex stability, which can be modulated by G4 binding small molecules [396] .\n\nTo inhibit translation of the target mRNA, the fol lowing strategy was developed: formation of a bimolecu lar hybrid DNA-RNA G4 was initiated in the predeter mined regions of mRNA containing only two G tracts using modified oligodeoxyribonucleotides with design allowing targeted addition of missing G tracts required for G4 formation [397] . It was shown using the mRNA encoding eIF 4E protein, which was actively expressed in various malignant tumors, that formation of G quadru plexes in the 5\u2032 UTR mRNA and in the protein coding region of the eIF 4E mRNA initiated by phosphoro thioate derivatives of oligonucleotides resulted in 30 and 60% inhibition of expression of this protein in human cancer cells, respectively [397] . On the contrary, addition of antisense oligonucleotides (complementary to the G4 motif) can result in the destruction of RNA G4 [398] . The effect of antisense peptide nucleic acids on RNA quadruplex assembly in vitro with relatively high degree of discrimination between the different G4 motifs has been described [399] . This approach -unwinding of RNA G4 by 17 19 nt oligonucleotides -was successfully used for two fold change in the level of inhibition of specific mRNA translation in human cells [400] .\n\nHowever, it was recently shown that modulation of translation depended on the nucleotide context in which G4 motifs were located. The formed RNA quadruplexes can either inhibit or activate gene expression depending on their location in the 5\u2032 UTR mRNA [393, 401, 402] . It has been suggested that the neighboring base sequences, intracellular environment, and interacting partners can affect the functions of G4 in the cell. Indeed, when the RNA G4 is located in the IRES element, it facilitates a new mechanism of cap independent transla tion initiation [403] . It was reported [404] that RNA G4 formed in the IRES of the mRNA encoding human VEGF protein directly involved in interaction with the 40S ribosome subunit. In the review published in 2015, the role of RNA G4s in regulation of processing and functioning of non coding RNAs was discussed [20] . These are promising new objects for investigation of G4 functions in the context of various neurodegenerative dis eases.\n\nSeveral publications in recent years have been devot ed to investigation of biological functions of the TERRA telomeric repeats and quadruplex structures formed by these non coding RNAs. It was shown that TERRA was not only accumulated in the cell nucleus, but it was colo calized with telomeric DNA at the chromosome ends (FISH, Fluorescence In situ Hybridization method) and with proteins of telomere shelterin complex (immunoflu orescence assay) [1] . Participation of TRF2 in simultane ous binding to TERRA in the form of a G4 and to telom eric DNA as a duplex or G4 (ELISA, Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) provides evidence that TERRA is the key component of the telomere machinery [267] . During the process, one TERRA molecule, which can fold into a quadruplex garland [192] , can interact with several TRF2 molecules [267] . It has been suggested that TERRA represses its own transcription and participates in maintenance of telomere structure and formation of heterochromatin [405] . It was shown that TERRA caused changes in gene expression in human cancer cells in vivo. The telomeric RNA that forms G4s inhibits expression of genes associated with the innate immune system, thus affecting tumor malignancy [406] .\n\nIt is interesting that the TERRA repeats, 5\u2032 UUAGGG 3\u2032, are complementary to the telomerase RNA sequence. It was shown using in vitro reconstructed telomerase and synthetic TERRA molecule that the TERRA repeats hybridized with the enzyme RNA inhibiting its activity. However, the inhibiting action of TERRA upon telomerase can be mitigated in vivo by the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) involved in the control of telomere length [407] . It has been suggested that the enzymatic elongation of telomer ic ends required a balance between the levels of TERRA and hnRNPA1 protein functioning as regulators of enzy matic activity. The role of G quadruplexes in RNA biol ogy, including TERRA telomeric repeats and telomerase RNA component hTERC, has been discussed in the recent reviews [394, 408] .\n\nFrom the practical point of view, a study in which G4 containing RNA aptamer produced by in vitro selec tion activated fluorescence of a ligand similar to green fluorescent protein is of great interest [409] . The approach was developed recently based on the replace ment of pyrimidine residues in the loops of telomeric G4s BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 with fluorescent 5 benzofuran derivatives of 2\u2032 deoxyuri dine and uridine, which allowed the development of switchable fluorescent probes for discrimination of DNA quadruplexes of different topology and parallel RNA G4 [410] . These G4 sensors were also used for estimation of the specificity and affinity of low molecular weight lig ands to quadruplexes of various chemical nature and con formation.\n\nHYBRID DNA-RNA G QUADRUPLEXES Hybrid DNA-RNA G quadruplexes are also func tionally important. The possibility of association between telomeric DNA and TERRA via formation of hybrid DNA-RNA quadruplex with parallel topology was inves tigated for the first time in [411] . Formation of such structures in vitro was established by several independent and complementary methods using oligonucleotide mod els. To prove occurrence of the hybrid G4s in the cellular medium, telomeric DNA and RNA oligonucleotides labeled with different fluorophores (FAM and Cy3) at the 3\u2032 ends were transfected into HeLa cells. The observed change in the color of signal occurring during colocaliza tion of fluorophores served as evidence that they were brought together in the hybrid bimolecular G4. If the DNA and RNA probes were not interacting, there would be two different fluorescence signals. The addition al brilliant evidence of the hybrid telomeric G4 formation in live cells was based on the use of a chemical approach [411] . The DNA probe (12 mer with two telomeric repeats) contained an azidocoumarin residue at the 5\u2032 end, and the 12 nt RNA -a 5\u2032 alkyne group. Azido coumarin was selected as a pro fluorophore with quenched fluorescence by the electron rich \u03b1 nitrogen of the azido group. However, the synthesis of the triazole ring by alkyne azide cycloaddition is accompanied by the emergence of a strong fluorescence signal due to disap pearance of the quenching effect (Fig. 9) . Hence, the flu orescence enhancement could indicate formation of the hybrid parallel G4 in which the cycloaddition reaction was initiated due to bringing the reactive groups at the ends of RNA and DNA oligonucleotides into proximity. Bright blue fluorescence was observed (using a fluores cence microscope) following addition of the cellular medium containing copper catalyst to the HeLa cells incubated with the oligonucleotides. It was established that the simple molecular colocalization of oligomers did not initiate the reaction of cycloaddition. The fact that this method was successfully used to demonstrate the for mation of hybrid RNA-DNA G4 in solution in vitro agrees with the experimental data with the cells [411] . The formation of hybrid G4 between the natural telomer ic RNA (TERRA) and oligodeoxyribonucleotide con taining telomeric repeats with fluorescence label at both ends was observed under conditions close to native ones.\n\nThe probe was designed in a way that it can form a hair pin structure in the absence of target and, hence, the FAM fluorescence was quenched by the DABCYL quencher located at the other end of the molecule. Formation of the hybrid quadruplex with telomeric RNA forced the DNA hairpin to open, which resulted in fluo rescence enhancement because the fluorophore and quencher were separated. This effect was observed after penetration of the DNA beacon into HeLa cells, con firming intracellular formation of the telomeric hybrid G4 [411] . It was shown in the same work that quadru plexes containing telomeric DNA and RNA could con tribute to the protection of telomeric ends. It is known that telomeric single stranded DNA forms a quadruplex garland. Formation of G4 structures of higher order is also characteristic for telomeric RNA [381] . Intermolecular interaction of the DNA and RNA end repeats can lead to formation of hybrid G4, which is located at the interface of the structured telomeric DNA sequences and TERRA and can provide protective effect creating steric hindrance [411] . Moreover, it is known that the telomeric protein of shelterin complex TRF2 binds simultaneously DNA G4 and RNA G4, thus bring ing them closer together in the cell [267] .\n\nThe hybrid DNA-RNA G4s can be a predominant form of quadruplexes also in the transcription process. They are formed from the non template DNA sequence and the RNA transcript [412] . It was shown that the DNA-RNA G4s modulated transcription under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and it was precisely these struc tures that comprised the major form of G4 that were involved in the transcription process. The fact that the RNA transcript is involved in the formation of hybrid G4 was confirmed by demonstrating that the effect of tran scription inhibition was achieved on addition of GTP participating in the RNA synthesis, and its replacement by the 7 deazaGTP, which was not capable of G tetrad formation restored the transcription level. These results indicate that the intermolecular DNA-RNA G4s are more involved in the regulation of transcription and relat ed processes than the intramolecular DNA quadruplexes formed by the template strand of the double helix [412] . The fact that only two G tracts on the non template DNA strand participate in formation of hybrid G4 seems especially important, because as was shown with bioinfor matics techniques these motifs are more abundant in the transcribed regions of the genome than the intramolecu lar DNA quadruplex formation motifs containing four and more G tracts on the template strand [413] . The hybrid quadruplex motifs, which are evolutionarily con served [413] , are abundant in the genomes of warm blooded animals [414] and occur in more than 97% of human genes [412] . The folding mechanism of hybrid G4s associated with transcription allows controlling their formation and, consequently, the transcription level. For example, the presence of C rich oligonucleotides com plementary to the RNA transcript prevents formation of the hybrid G4, and the quadruplex specific ligands stabi lize these structures [414] .\n\nAccording to some published data [415] , quadruplex hybrids can be involved also in regulation of DNA syn thesis, at least in mitochondria, where the transcription machine generates RNA primers required for initiation of replication. The DNA of the non template strand con taining fragments with G rich conserved sequence 5\u2032 GGGGGAGGGGGGG (two G tracts) from human mitochondrial DNA and the formed transcript fold into a stable hybrid G4 with parallel topology close to the origin of replication. The 3\u2032 end of the primer in this quadru plex is removed from the template strand and is not acces sible to the action of the mitochondrial replication machinery, which explains the mechanism of negative regulation of the DNA replication. Only after unwinding of the G4 with helicase (such as, for example, evolution arily conserved Pif1) the released primer can be used for initiation of the DNA replication. Participation of hybrid quadruplexes in immunoglobulin gene recombination and in neurodegenerative diseases caused by expansion of G rich repeats in the C9orf72 [416] and FMR1 [417] genes has also been discussed.\n\nOver several decades, the possibility of formation of biologically relevant G quadruplexes in live cells that were unlike the other non canonical DNA structures sta ble under physiological condition has been discussed among scientists. The discovery of ligands specific to G4 structures provided a tool for investigation of the proper ties of such structures, as well as for development of methods for their isolation and identification in cells [205] . The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to determine the localization of G4s in the genome. The chromatin fragments were fractionated depending on their affinity to quadruplex binding ligands followed by analysis of selected samples using sequencing or template analysis on microchips. Identification of G4s in cellular cultures was also performed using monoclonal antibodies highly specific to these structures [320] .\n\nThe complexity of G4 testing in live cells and ambi guity of interpretation of the results is related to many factors. Numerous proteins and enzymes existing in vivo can interact with non canonical DNAs, thus stabilizing or destabilizing these structures [418] , as well as cleaving them. The genome regions containing G4 motifs can be included in nucleosomes, where they are completely shielded by histone proteins. Rearrangement of the genome G4 motif region into the G quadruplex structure depends on the factors affecting stability of the double helix: the degree of methylation and local topological stress of the DNA [419] . It should be also taken into account that in vitro experiments are commonly conduct ed in dilute solutions, i.e. under conditions that are sig nificantly different from the molecular crowding charac teristic of in vivo systems. Moreover, small molecule lig ands can shift the equilibrium towards quadruplex struc ture formation by stabilizing their structure, which can skew the real distribution pattern of these non canonical structures in the cell DNA. Nevertheless, direct evidence of the G4 existence in the gene promoter region was reported as early as 2002. However, this and similar stud ies were based on the biological effects of G4 stabilizing ligands introduced into the cell. The discovery of G quadruplex structures at the telomeres in macronuclei of the Stylonychia lemnae ciliate using fluorescent antibodies was an important breakthrough in this research area. It was shown later that the G4 formation depended on the phase of the cell cycle and was controlled by proteins binding to the telomeric ends. Only in studies of recent years the possibility to visualize the loci in mammalian cells (including human cells), which adopt the G4 struc tures, and to elucidate their role in the cascade of biolog ical events has been achieved.\n\nTwo independent lines of evidence demonstrated the genome wide distribution of G4 structures in human cancer cells [203] . In the first approach, a highly selected G4 binding small molecule ligand, pyridostatin, was used to target polymorphic G4s regardless of their topol ogy. Pyridostatin was shown to promote growth arrest in cells and modulate the expression of the genes containing G4 motifs by inducing replication and transcription dependent DNA damage. It was suggested that the ligand prevented the polymerase movement along the double helix by stabilizing the G4s, which resulted in a DNA break caused by the physical forces acting on a substrate or by endonuclease activity. A chromatin immunoprecip itation sequencing analysis of the DNA damage marker provided the genome distribution of pyridostatin induced damaged loci. A chemical approach (reaction of alkyne azide cycloaddition of fluorescent group to pyridostatin) was used in the independent series of experiments to visu alize the ligand molecules in the cell nuclei as fluorescent signals. The regioselective reaction of the alkyne group attached to pyridostatin with the azide group on the fluo rescent dye Alexa Fluor was initiated in cellulo by a cop per catalyst. Loci with folded G quadruplex structures in human cell DNA were revealed by high resolution microscopy, and it was shown that they were located pre dominately in the regions away from the chromosome ends. The hPif1 helicase, known for its high selectivity towards G4 and regulation of these structures formation and processing in the genome, was used as a second refer ence point. Distribution of helicase signals in the cell nuclei in comparison with the fluorescently labeled pyri dostatin was investigated on the human osteosarcoma cell lines expressing human helicase fused to green fluores BIOCHEMISTRY (Moscow) Vol. 81 No. 13 2016 cent protein. This analysis showed that the helicase was bound to G4 motifs in the genome even without the lig and treatment. The general distribution pattern of fluo rescent signals was comparable with that observed for the labeled small molecules. In an independent experiment with cells fixed by formaldehyde \"freezing\" all biological processes prior to the pyridostatin treatment significant overlapping between the genomic targets of pyridostatin and helicase was observed. These data indicate the exis tence of the preformed G4 in human cells, formation of which was not initiated by addition of the G4 binding lig and.\n\nNot all the sites with high content of G4 motifs were labeled with the fluorescent ligand. It is likely that addi tional mechanisms facilitating G4 folding should be real ized. Negative supercoiling of DNA in a certain locus or activity of replication or transcription processes that are accompanied by local melting of the double helix and short lived release of single stranded regions for reading by polymerase could serve as examples of such mecha nisms. The ability of G4 motif to form quadruplex and bind the ligand could also depend on whether the G rich regions are on the transcribed or non transcribed strand of the gene [368] or, in the case of replication, on the leading or lagging DNA strand. It also must be taken in consideration that certain cellular effects of G4 specific ligands might be caused by their interaction with RNA G4s [420] .\n\nDirect quantitative visualization of DNA G4 struc tures in human tumor cells using quadruplex specific antibody has been described [318] . The visualization was achieved via amplification of the fluorescent signal in an antibody sandwich. The loss of signals on pre incubation of the antibody with excess of preformed G4 oligonu cleotides as well as during incubation of the cells with fluorescent antibodies in the absence of the primary G4 binding antibody indicated specificity of the signal. The colored loci in the nucleus also disappeared during treat ment of the cells with DNase, but not with RNase. Location of the signals at the ends of metaphase chro mosomes confirms the presence of G4s at the telomeric ends, and the scattering of the signals in other chromo some loci indicates that most G quadruplex structures (approximately 75%) can be formed in promoter regions and in other DNA regions despite the presence of com peting complementary strand (Fig. 10) . It was shown in this excellent work that formation of G4s in cell nuclei was modulated depending on the phase of the cell cycle; maximum level was observed in the phase of active DNA replication (S phase), which was 4.8 fold higher than the level of G4 detection in the resting phase. According to these data, addition of small molecule ligands stabi lizing endogenous DNA quadruplexes resulted in an increase (2.9 fold) of the amount of detected G4 targets in the cell nucleus, which indicated the shift of the duplex-G4 equilibrium towards formation of quadru plexes, and this opened new possibilities for targeted reg ulation of cellular processes such as inhibition of onco gene expression.\n\nThese data were corroborated by the work of anoth er scientific group [421] where highly specific G4 anti bodies were also used. The increase in the number of detected G4s in nuclei of human cells was observed under the action of two G4 stabilizing ligands -telomestatin and TMPyP4. Intracellular optical visualization of DNA G4s using fluorogenic ligands was described [259] . Very recently, a report was published [422] where direct evi dence of the existence of DNA quadruplexes in cell mito chondria was presented. Fluorescent G4 specific ligands based on carbazole derivatives that can migrate from the nucleus to mitochondria of malignant cells were used for visualization of quadruplexes by confocal microscopy. It should be noted that in the case of normal cells they accu mulated in the cytoplasm. The developed compounds were shown to stabilize G4s and, hence, to inhibit expres sion of mitochondrial genes acting as antitumor agents.\n\nIn addition to DNA G4s, the ribonucleotide analogs of quadruplexes and their role in RNA biology have aroused considerable and growing interest [394] . Direct evidence of formation of RNA quadruplexes in human cells was presented in [319] , in which the detection of G quadruplexes was conducted in the cell cytoplasm by G4 specific BG4 antibody. Prior to that it was shown by ELISA that this antibody recognized the major structural determinant of G4s effectively binding to both DNA and RNA quadruplexes. The endogenous G4s were visualized by fluorescence microscopy in normal, immortalized, and malignant human cells. The fluorescence signals were amplified using a sandwich of labeled antibodies; BG4 served as a primary antibody in the process. Both the intranuclear signals assigned to the DNA quadruplexes and the fluorescence signals (with longer exposure) dis tributed in the cytoplasm of all the investigated cell lines and corresponded to RNA G4s were identified using the described approach. Cell staining with the CellMask green fluorescent dye, which revealed cell boundaries, corroborated cytoplasmic location of the primary BG4 antibody. When fixed permeabilized cells were treated with RNase A prior to addition of the BG4 antibody, the quadruplex signals in the cytoplasm disappeared, which indicated the presence of RNA G4s. Along with the immunofluorescence assay, low molecular weight ligands were used to provide evidence of the occurrence of endogenous RNA quadruplexes in human cells. For example, carboxypyridostatin, which was shown by chemical approaches (alkyne azide cycloaddition in situ) to bind more effectively to RNA G4 than to the DNA analogs [235] , increased (approximately 2.4 fold) the number of G4s only in the cell cytoplasm, not affecting the number of DNA quadruplexes with nuclear localiza tion. Recently, RNA G4 were found in live cells using a new generation of quadruplex specific compound, N TASQ, which combined functions of the \"smart\" ligand and \"smart\" fluorescence probe [263] . These compounds behave as intracellular molecular sensors targeting only the preformed G4s. They use G4 quadruplexes as a tem plate for self assembly of the artificial G tetrad, forma tion of which causes fluorescence enhancement. N TASQ exhibits unique properties because, unlike the quadruplex specific antibodies, it does not require fixa tion and permeabilization of the cells. It was shown that under the conditions used the cytoplasmic RNA G4s (in free state and more likely in the form of complex ribonu cleoprotein subcellular ensembles) served as targets of the N TASQ, and they were revealed as intensive discrete loci in human breast cancer and osteosarcoma cells as well as in murine melanoma. Moreover, the cells were not pre treated in the process. It has been suggested that N TASQ penetrates easily through the cytoplasmic membrane, accumulating in the cytoplasm under non denaturing physiological conditions. It was shown [423] that G4 specific BG4 antibody could be used to stain DNA G4 structures in human tis sues using immunohistochemistry. A significantly elevat ed number of G4 positive nuclei in tissues of liver and stomach cancer patients in comparison with healthy tis sues was observed. To identify malignant tissue transfor mation, the G4 binding fluorescent ligand 3,6 bis(1 Fig. 9 . Evidence of formation of DNA-RNA hybrid telomeric G4 in HeLa cells using the alkyne azide cycloaddition reaction. The 12 nt DNA with two telomeric repeats (G residues highlight ed with green color) contained an azidocoumarin residue at the 5\u2032 end, where fluorescence was quenched by the electron rich \u03b1 nitrogen in the azide group, and the 12 nt RNA (G residues marked with red) containing the 5\u2032 alkyne group. Synthesis of a triazole ring on addition of copper catalyst was accompanied by the emergence of strong fluorescence signal due to disappearance of the quenching effect. methyl 4 vinylpyridinium) carbazole diiodate was also used [424] . It was found that the number of signals increased depending on the degree of cell transformation, making this approach promising for early diagnostics of oncological diseases. The G quadruplex structures were identified by immunoelectron microscopy in samples from different organisms: ciliates, flatworms, fruit flies, and mammals [425] . It was found that the loci stained by the 1H6 monoclonal antibodies, which were specific to DNA G4s of various topologies, were present in heterochromatin of all samples. It was found that the sites of 1H6 antibody binding in the polytene chromosomes from drosophila salivary glands were colocalized with heterochromatic proteins. It was also observed that the somatic cells in dif ferent organisms displayed more intensive staining than pluripotent stem cells. These findings indicate a con served role of G4s in nuclear organization and cell differ entiation. It is the authors' opinion that the G quadru plex structures are present in postmitotic cells as well as in mitotic chromosomes. They can exist independently of DNA replication, transcription, or recombination stimu lating genetic instability.\n\nThe studies conducted in recent years have shown that G4s exist in genomic DNA in all phases of the cell cycle. These non canonical structures are diverse. On one hand, they can perform regulatory functions in the cell, inhibit oncogene expression, block undesired elongation of telomeric DNA, control the level of negative supercoil ing in the genome, and serve as targets of antitumor ther apeutics. Recently, the role of G quadruplexes in embryo development, which is the most controlled process in ver tebrate biology, was established [426] . On the other hand, G4 formation causes genome instability (genomic inver sions, recombination, mutations, deletions, and others) associated with oncological diseases and neurological dis orders. In this review, we have presented state of the art knowledge on these amazing structures in all investigated aspects. The most important information on the structure and biological functions of G quadruplexes was obtained using novel research techniques, and their major features were emphasized in this review."}
