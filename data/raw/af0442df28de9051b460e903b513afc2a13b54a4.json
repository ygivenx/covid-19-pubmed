{"title": "Supplemental Information The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus", "body": "For RNA-mediated stimulation of the RLR pathway, HEK 293Ts were maintained in 48-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FBS). The next day, cells were transfected with 10 ng of pFLAG-CMV4 plasmid encoding RIG-I, MDA5, or an empty vector control (Ahmad et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2014) , together with 100 ng of IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Lipofectamine2000, Life Technologies). The medium was changed 4 hours post-transfection with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ. All experiments involving NTZ were performed in this manner in order to reduce the impact of serum proteins on NTZ's function in tissue culture, as NTZ is highly protein-bound (Stockis et al., 1996) FBS. As described above, the next day the medium was changed with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ for 4 hrs, followed by stimulation with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IFN-\u03b2 (PeproTech),. Cells were harvested ~20 hr poststimulation and qPCR was performed as described above. CT values were normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Relative quantification was calculated by the comparative CT method and is shown as fold change of expression\n\nTo test if NTZ induces GADD34 gene expression, A549 cells grown in 10%\n\nFBS/DMEM were switched to 1% FBS/DMEM for 1 hour and then treated with 0, 10, 20, or 30 \u00b5M NTZ for 4 hours, followed by RNA isolation and oligoDT-based cDNA synthesis. CT values were normalized to cyclophilin A as a housekeeping gene and relative quantitation of GADD34 mRNA levels was performed as described above. \n\nTo stably co-express dCas9-KRAB and a guide RNA specific to the promoters of the genes encoding i) PKR, ii) RIG-I, or iii) GADD34, a lentiviral vector was constructed that encoded an EFS promoter-driven dCas9-KRAB-2A-E2Crimson-2A-puroR cassette and a U6 promoter for gRNA transcription (see Supp. Fig. 1 ) based on similar approaches our laboratory has used previously (Chow et al., 2014) . Individual gRNA sequences were obtained from the CRISPR design program at crispr.mit.edu and are shown in Supplemental Figure 1 , along with the sites in the individual gene promoters that they target. As a control, a lentiviral vector encoding a U6 promoter-driven scrambled gRNA that does not match any genomic sequence was also constructed (designated CRISPRcontrol).\n\nTo generate A549 cells with stable knock down of specific genes, cells were transduced with the control or gene-specific lentiviruses, and positively transduced cells were selected with 2 \u00b5g/ml puromycin for 3 weeks as described previously (Chow et al., 2014) . Efficacy of the knockdowns was then evaluated by analyzing gene expression following mock stimulation or stimulation with 100 ng/ml human IFN-\u03b2 for 4 hours for the CRISPR-control, CRISPR-RIG-I, and CRISPR-PKR cells, or with 40 \u00b5M NTZ for 8 hours for the CRISPR-control and CRISPR-GADD34 cells. RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using anchored oligoDT priming and cDNA was measured using standard qPCR methodology and normalized to the housekeeping gene cyclophilin B\n\nwith the primers shown in the legend of Fig. 3 .\n\nThe CRISPR A549 cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 complete media and used for Western blotting. For GADD34 detection, CRISPR-control and CRISPR- \n\nTo assess the ability of NTZ treatment to inhibit replication of authentic EBOV in A549 cells, we infected cells in duplicate with the Zaire ebolavirus Kikwit strain (EBOV). After 1 hour in DMEM+1%FBS cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M or 40 \u00b5M NTZ for 4 hours before EBOV infection. After the 4-hour pre-treatment, the supernatants from the NTZ-treated cells were removed and then used to make up the EBOV inocula per condition. Cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01, which was rocked at 37\u00b0C for one hour. The inocula were left on the cells and had fresh media containing 20 \u00b5M or 40 \u00b5M NTZ added. Supernatants were collected at 1, 48, and 72 hours post infection and analyzed for production of infectious virus by plaque assay analysis.\n\nThe A549 cells with CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB-based knock down of: i) PKR, ii) RIG-I, or iii) GADD34 were used to assess the mechanism of NTZ EBOV inhibition through these genes. For this analysis, we infected cells in duplicate with the Zaire ebolavirus Kikwit strain (EBOV). After 1 hour in DMEM+1%FBS cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M NTZ for 4 hours before EBOV infection. After the 4-hour pre-treatment, the supernatants from the NTZ-treated cells were removed and then used to make up the EBOV inocula per condition. Cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01, which was rocked at 37\u00b0C for one hour. The inocula were left on the cells and had fresh media containing 20 \u00b5M NTZ added. Supernatants were collected at 1, 48, and 72 hours post infection and analyzed for production of infectious virus by plaque assay analysis.\n\nVirus titration was performed on Vero E6 cells from all supernatants collected.\n\nIncreasing ten-fold dilutions of each sample were adsorbed to the cell monolayers in duplicate wells (200 \u00b5l each); the limit of detection of the assay was 25 plaque forming units per milliliter."}
