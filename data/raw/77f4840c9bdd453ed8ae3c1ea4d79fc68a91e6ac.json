{"title": "", "body": "Members of the coronavirus family responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are known to be responsible for severe complications during pregnancy. 2, 3 12 pregnant women were infected with SARS-CoV during the 2002-03 pandemic. 2 Four (57%) of seven women in the first trimester had a miscarriage. In the second to third trimester, two (40%) of five women had fetal growth restriction, and four (80%) of five women had preterm birth (one spontaneous; three induced for maternal condition). Three (25%) women died during pregnancy.\n\nIn a review of 11 pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV, 3 ten (91%) presented with adverse outcomes, six (55%) neonates required admission to the intensive care unit, and three (27%) died. Two neonates were delivered prematurely for severe maternal respiratory failure.\n\nConsidering that the 2019-nCoV seems to have a similar pathogenic potential as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 4 pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infections, there are no specific clinical signs of coronavirus infections preceding severe complications, 5 coronaviruses have the potential to cause severe maternal or perinatal adverse outcomes, or both, 2,3 and the current lack of data on the consequences of a 2019-nCoV infection during pregnancy, we recommend systematic screening of any suspected 2019-nCoV infection during pregnancy. If 2019-nCoV infection during pregnancy is confirmed, extended followup should be recommended for mothers and their fetuses."}
