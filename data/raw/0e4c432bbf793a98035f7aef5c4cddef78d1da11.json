{"title": "Ethics", "body": "Vaccines present a spectrum of novel ethical considerations compared with those associated with other medical interventions. Central to these differences are the role of vaccines in disease prevention rather than treatment, the concurrent interest of vaccination policy in improving the health of both communities and individuals, and the focus on children in many vaccination programs. Formal discussions of ethical issues related to vaccination once concentrated principally on aspects of clinical research and specific topics regarding vaccine safety and financing. Recent events, such as outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, increases in parental vaccine hesitancy and refusal, and the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak, demonstrate the value and importance of a more comprehensive and sustained examination of vaccine ethics. Such an approach offers important insights into all aspects of the vaccine life cycle, from the earliest stages of research through deployment in national and global immunization programs.\n\nUnlike pharmaceuticals and most other medical interventions, vaccines are intended to prevent disease rather than to treat it. The ethics of prevention differ greatly from the ethics of treatment. Chief among these differences are the disparate meanings and interpretations of \"risk\" in each context.\n\nWhen treating disease, risks are largely confined to two broad categories: the risks associated with a particular intervention and the risks of doing nothing. These risks are weighed against the potential benefits of a specific treatment and compared with the risk-to-benefit profiles of potential alternatives. Decision making is invariably complicated by the uncertainty associated with any assessment of risks and benefits. Nevertheless, every treatment decision is made based on the evaluation of all options in light of the risks and potential benefits of each, compared with the consequences of doing nothing.\n\nWhen aiming to prevent disease by means of vaccination, assessing the risk of inaction is more challenging. Here, the physiological consequences of a disease in an individual person must be considered in addition to the specific likelihood of acquiring that disease. As a result of successful vaccination programs, the incidence of many vaccine-preventable diseases is extremely low in the United States and other wealthy countries. This complicates efforts to convey the continued necessity of vaccines to parents, many of whom may have never seen or experienced the diseases being prevented. Globally, the risk of diseases is subject to wide geographical, national, and occupational variability. In all cases, high rates of vaccination among communities are widely credited with preserving the low incidence of many vaccine-preventable diseases. 1 The benefit of high vaccination rates highlights a key difference between the ethics of treatment and the ethics of prevention. Prevention, specifically the prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination, has important implications for individual people and communities. While considerations relative to justice and the allocation of scarce resources have 84 ethical relevance to some treatment decisions, rarely are they primary factors in how care is delivered.\n\nAs a form of prevention, vaccination requires juxtaposing individual autonomy against societal best interests. These values are often in alignment, but for some, they present competing arguments regarding the decision to vaccinate. Central to this debate is herd protection, the indirect benefits that result from high vaccination rates in a community and provide additional protection to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals alike. For some parents or patients, the benefits of vaccination may be seen as being outweighed by the associated risks and costs, however small or unlikely they may be. This is a particularly possible scenario for vaccines against diseases that have virtually disappeared in wealthy countries partly as a result of successful vaccination programs. Those choosing not to be vaccinated would still benefit at least somewhat through herd protection, creating the potential ethical problem of benefiting as a \"free rider.\"\n\nFree riders are those who knowingly share in the benefits of social programs such as vaccination without personally assuming any risks, burdens, or costs, such as the risk of adverse events or the time and expense required to receive vaccines. Numerous vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks among unvaccinated persons suggest that personal reliance on herd protection is often inadequate. 2,3 Such decisions also increase the overall risk of vaccine-preventable disease in communities, particularly for their members too young to receive a vaccine or unable to do so because of medical contraindications. Those who knowingly benefit from the actions of others without sharing in the burden or cost of providing that benefit act in an unethical manner.\n\nThe significance of healthy children as the largest target population for vaccines cannot be overstated. Young children are ethically vulnerable because they cannot exercise their own autonomy to mediate issues of risk and benefit. With a majority of vaccinations in the United States and other countries recommended for children in the first 24 months of life, vaccine recipients are typically among the most ethically vulnerable of populations. Attention by vaccine stakeholders to vaccine-related risks, whether confirmed or alleged, is understandably heightened with respect to children, as is the importance of the potential benefits of routine, on-time vaccination. While striving to make decisions that are in a child's best interests, parents and guardians must navigate a sea of at times conflicting information related not only to vaccines, but also to all aspects of their child's medical care. [4] [5] [6] Widely publicized claims by critics of vaccines questioning the safety and value of vaccinations have added to the challenges faced by parents striving to make responsible and informed decisions about their children's health.\n\nIronically, communication efforts may be hampered as a result of how routine childhood vaccination has become in large parts of the world. Amid competing demands on healthcare providers' time, efforts to explain the continued importance of vaccination to parents may suffer. Absent unique training for local health officials, expertise that could benefit communities long after research has concluded. Meaningful contributions from local officials also create an additional layer of protection to ensure that the generosity of volunteers is not exploited by research that very often would have been deemed unethical had it been proposed for populations in wealthy countries.\n\nNo topic related to vaccine research has generated more controversy on ethical grounds than the designs of clinical trials, particularly those in developing countries. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] As an example, one prominent and ongoing debate for nearly 20 years has centered on HIV vaccine trials in developing countries, particularly the level and duration of care that ought to be provided to research subjects who become infected during trials. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Options range from lifelong treatment with the latest in antiretroviral medications-the norm in many developed countries but highly uncommon elsewhere-to whatever the typical treatment is in the country where the trial took place. Such a level of care is often well below that of the research sponsors' home countries. It may be nothing. Because of the significant consequences of this debate to the feasibility of future research, attempts at reaching consensus on the question of which standards should prevail have largely failed. 13, 15 This longstanding and still unresolved debate provides a useful example of the value of robust discussions of ethical considerations before controversies develop and decisions cannot be undone.\n\nVaccine development can never be immune from the twin pressures of personal advancement and corporate profitability. Nevertheless, the world community is best served by vaccine research programs that match these concerns with a continued acknowledgment of the enormous suffering that can be averted by vaccines and respect for the individual people and communities volunteering to assist in clinical research.\n\nFinally, concern for justice requires that the populations in which a vaccine candidate is studied mirror as closely as possible the groups expected to receive the licensed product. The use of mentally handicapped children as primary sources of vaccine research subjects in the 1950s and 1960s exemplifies how this principle was violated in the past. 19 These children often lived in overcrowded institutions with sanitary conditions that placed them at increased risk for the diseases for which potential vaccines were being tested. New vaccines would have been particularly valuable to these children, who also provided a convenient, accessible study population for researchers.\n\nHowever, mentally handicapped children in state institutions are among the most vulnerable of populations, for whom clinical research is ethically appropriate only in extremely limited circumstances and always with strict oversight. In pursuit of vaccines that would benefit society broadly, the past use of these children as a primary study population often violated this fundamental and timeless tenet of research ethics.\n\nToday, the opposite extreme has become common. Manufacturers have a strong disincentive to include among their research subjects members of potentially high-risk populations, such as pregnant women or children with intellectual disabilities. Without complete data on safety and efficacy in all populations to whom a vaccine will be administered, patients, parents, and policymaking bodies have inadequate information on which to base their decisions regarding vaccination in these groups. The vaccine research and regulatory communities should remain aware of past exploitation of vulnerable research subjects but strive to conduct clinical research in ways that protect subjects while providing as complete a picture as possible of a vaccine's safety and efficacy profile. concerns raised by parents or providers, communication about vaccines may be left instead to a few short questions and answers or reliance on government-required printed information statements. 6 The routinization of vaccines is amplified by state laws in the United States requiring vaccination against many diseases as a condition of school or daycare attendance. This atmosphere of familiarity partially explains the widespread alarm generated by reports of vaccine-related safety concerns, regardless of whether the concerns are confirmed, alleged, or simply a matter of rumor.\n\nWhile the preceding discussion highlights some of the unique attributes of vaccines and vaccine decision making, their research, development, and regulation are similar in form and function to those of pharmaceuticals and other medical interventions. The following sections provide an overview of relevant ethical considerations at various stages of the vaccine life cycle, a period that begins with the earliest basic research and extends through licensure and all dimensions of national and international vaccine production and distribution programs.\n\nThe successful development of new discoveries increasingly relies on collaborations among academic scientists, government researchers, small biotechnology firms, and large, multinational vaccine manufacturers. Although financial support for this work has traditionally come from a combination of commercial investment and government-sponsored research awards, philanthropic groups and public-private partnerships have become increasingly active supporters of vaccine development, particularly for disease targets that lack large potential markets (and thus profitability) in wealthy countries.\n\nSuch a diverse group of research entities and funders all but assures a collection of differing research priorities, objectives, and measures of success. While all contributors share the general aim of developing safe and effective vaccines, conflicts may arise regarding how best to achieve this goal. 7 If unchecked, such conflicts could impede progress toward novel vaccines, waste limited financial resources, and fail to respect the contributions of human research subjects. Large research partnerships have the potential to advance public health in ways that would occur much more slowly, if at all, if attempted by individual entities. While respecting their obligations to shareholders, boards, or other overseers, all contributors to vaccine research and those who invest in their work should remain keenly aware of the morally distinguishing ability of their work to save lives, prevent suffering, and greatly improve global health.\n\nResearch partnerships become even more ethically complex when they include clinical research in developing countries. This is especially important as vaccine development efforts increasingly target diseases common in developing countries, often through collaborations in which Western researchers have a leading role. These activities bring needed expertise and capabilities to countries often lacking robust medical research infrastructures and stable health systems, even before considering the potential direct benefits successful new vaccines may bring. During this research and development process, local researchers and health ministries ought to be involved in a meaningful way in all aspects of clinical research taking place in their countries. The benefits of such relationships are many. For example, they may provide additional knowledge and 84 provides compensation without exposing manufacturers to substantial legal and financial risk.\n\nThis program has faced scrutiny in recent years regarding how claims are resolved and the scope of its coverage. The Omnibus Autism Proceeding and the case of Bruesewitz v Wyeth heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010 represented challenges to aspects of the federal government's system for identifying and compensating vaccine-related injuries. 29, 30 In the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, theories that the measlesmumps-rubella vaccine and the vaccine preservative thimerosal could, individually or in tandem, cause autism in vaccine recipients were extensively examined and unequivocally rejected by the special masters who evaluate claims for compensation. Bruesewitz v Wyeth affirmed the primary role of the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, not state laws or civil proceedings, in assessing vaccine-related adverse events. Given the concomitant challenges of compensating victims fairly, accurately distinguishing correlation from causation regarding adverse events, and ensuring that manufacturers remain committed to developing and manufacturing vaccines, the current design of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a generally fair way of resolving these ethical obligations. 31\n\nThe highly publicized influenza vaccine shortage in 2004 and many other shortages for recommended childhood vaccines underscore the vulnerability of vaccine supply worldwide. 32, 33 With limited manufacturers and often only a single licensed product available in a country, vaccines are highly susceptible to large fluctuations in supply and availability owing to unforeseen events. [34] [35] [36] In the United States, CDC stockpiles of recommended vaccines are maintained to provide a temporary buffer in case of production or supply problems, but these efforts provide only limited protection. 37, 38 A spectrum of economic and business considerations helps explain why many manufacturers have left the vaccine market and why the remaining manufacturers are not eager to develop new products to compete with older vaccines that, in general, are able to meet demand. 34, 35 Finding incentives to increase the number of vaccine manufacturers and to encourage development of new vaccines for common diseases would help ensure a more resilient vaccine supply landscape that is better insulated against the shortages that have become increasingly common.\n\nEven when vaccine supplies are adequate, vaccination rates reflect many of the same racial and ethnic disparities in access present throughout medicine. 39, 40 While the underlying causes of these conditions are debated, several programs seek to eliminate vaccine cost as an obstacle to childhood vaccination in the United States, most notably the Vaccines for Children program for uninsured and underinsured children. 41 Established in 1994, this entitlement program makes vaccines recommended by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices available free of charge to children in these groups. The size and cost of the program has grown with additions to the recommended vaccination schedule, especially since the 1990s; in 2016, its annual budget surpassed $4 billion. 42 With respect to private health insurance in the United States, under the Affordable Care Act, new insurance plans must provide coverage for any vaccine recommended for routine use in children or adults by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 42 No copayment, coinsurance, or deductible can be required from the insured patient. This provision for vaccines is part of a spectrum of preventive services required of new private insurance plans. According to the\n\nVaccines are subject to oversight and regulation by a variety of entities in every country where they are available. 20 It is initially determined whether a new vaccine should be licensed, and if so, the populations for whom it should be recommended. In the United States, these responsibilities belong to groups within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), respectively. For the life of the vaccine thereafter, activities are undertaken by these groups in collaboration with its manufacturer to monitor its safety and efficacy. 20, 21 These processes have generated considerable controversy in recent years, threatening public confidence in vaccination. 22 As the success of vaccination programs depends on earning and maintaining public trust, there are several points in vaccine regulation at which ethical considerations are relevant to public policy. 9, 23 A primary concern of critics of vaccine policy in the United States is the potential for conflicts of interest among government advisors and researchers who have ties, financial or otherwise, to vaccine manufacturers. The very nature of vaccine development presents unique challenges in avoiding even the appearance of a conflict. Any researcher working on novel vaccine candidates must eventually partner at some point with industry owing to the infrastructure needed for large-scale clinical testing and development. To exclude all such researchers for this reason would be to forfeit a wealth of expertise and wisdom on vaccine science and policy, ignoring internationally respected leaders in vaccine science.\n\nHowever, the importance to vaccination programs of maintaining public trust demands that those contributing to policy exercise particular caution and care regarding their professional and financial relationships. Most advisory bodies have clear policies regarding the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. 24, 25 Even when confident that financial relationships would have no impact on their actions, individuals should remain highly attentive to how such interests might affect the manner in which the decisions to which they contribute may be perceived. Transparency, minimization of personal gain, divestiture, and disclosure are crucial principles that work to counteract the perception of conflict of interest influencing decision making.\n\nPublic attention to conflicts of interest among policymakers and their expert advisors is often linked to reports of vaccine safety concerns. The public health and regulatory communities should respond vigorously to reports of vaccineassociated adverse events, even if they initially seem unlikely. Passive surveillance programs, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in the United States, are valuable tools in this effort, but their limitations as hypothesis-generating mechanisms should be clearly and repeatedly conveyed to the public and the media. 26 Emerging patterns of possible safety problems should be explored thoroughly, with the results of these analyses promptly communicated to the public. Even when evidence suggests that a reported safety concern is unfounded, experience shows it is unlikely that any such assurance will allay the worries of all. Nevertheless, open, expeditious, and objective examinations of possible vaccineassociated safety concerns are essential to maintaining overall confidence in vaccination programs and their oversight. 22, 27 It is known that a small number of persons will genuinely be harmed as a result of vaccines. Because vaccination benefits communities, victims are entitled to compensation for their suffering in these rare cases. In the United States, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is the principal mechanism for resolving such issues. 28 By means of a no-fault system with funds collected via a tax on every vaccine dose, the system medical decisions that place one's own health at risk, one may not jeopardize the health of others, a consequence of low vaccination rates within a community. Even in an autonomyoriented culture such as the United States, there are ethical reasons to place some limits on individual choice.\n\nAn ethically preferable scenario would be maintaining current high rates of vaccination without needing the force of mandates to do so. Absent evidence that this is attainable in the United States, the current policy is sound. Mandates serve as a \"safety net,\" a valuable tool to call attention to the importance of vaccines and help direct government and public health resources to vaccination efforts. 47 Exemption policies provide a ready alternative in nearly all states for persons whose personal beliefs do not coincide with protecting their child against vaccine-preventable disease to the greatest extent possible or with promoting public health in their communities. Combined with incomplete enforcement by state health departments or local school districts, current policies fall far short of true compulsion. They are, instead, best understood as presumptive or default approaches to vaccination.\n\nEven though national rates of nonmedical exemptions remain quite low, recent trends-particularly clusters of voluntarily unvaccinated individuals in some communities-are of deep concern to advocates of vaccination. 50 Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly the 2015 measles outbreaks in the United States, prompted calls to reevaluate the compromise reflected in the current approach to vaccination requirements and exemptions. 51 Proposals to eliminate nonmedical exemptions entirely-as has been the case for many years in West Virginia and Mississippi-have been debated in numerous states, and passed in California in 2015. Other proposals have sought to preserve such exemptions but to impose additional administrative burdens to make them more difficult to obtain, an approach shown in states with similarly rigorous procedures to successfully reduce the rate of nonmedical exemptions.\n\nAlthough a principled and persuasive argument can be made for the elimination of all nonmedical exemptions, some advocates of vaccination worry that a potential public backlash and resulting challenges in enforcement might lead to such reforms actually doing more harm than good to vaccination rates and vaccination programs overall. The experiences of states like California that move to eliminate exemptions should be watched closely to assess whether these hypothesized concerns are or are not realized as new policies are approved and implemented.\n\nThese various proposals to restrict or eliminate exemptions all reflect the increasingly clear and ethically defensible assessment that current policies in this area place unvaccinated children and their communities at an unacceptable, elevated risk of preventable disease. At the same time, these legislative approaches to ensuring high vaccination rates must be viewed as part of a comprehensive education and promotional effort that aims to grow and sustain the widespread foundation of public support that remains in the United States. This confidence in the value of vaccination is reflected in high vaccination rates in young children long before they are likely to encounter school or daycare requirements, and it persists despite discouraging trends in vaccine hesitancy and refusal among a small, but growing minority.\n\nA related issue is how physicians and other healthcare providers should respond to parents who desire an alternate approach to vaccination than the evidence-based recommendations developed by public health and medical authorities, such as the schedule in the United States developed by the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other medical professional organizations. 4, 52 At issue has been whether physicians should decline to care for children whose parents wish Institute of Medicine, an estimated 11 million children and 59 million adults had private insurance that did not adequately cover costs related to immunization prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a shortcoming that the law is quickly correcting. 43 In comparison with children and insured adults, uninsured adults in the United States face far greater financial obstacles to vaccination. With an increasing number of vaccines recommended for adults but no program similar to Vaccines for Children, the affordability of vaccines for uninsured adults remains a substantial challenge. Federal funding through the Section 317 program to state and municipal grantees has long provided some assistance in this area, but the available funds have long been outstripped by the needs in this area, all the more so as the adult vaccination schedule has also expanded in recent years. 41 Federal and state governments, in collaboration with vaccine manufacturers, should identify strategies that would reduce these financial obstacles to adult vaccination. The laudable patient assistance programs organized by several vaccine manufacturers may provide a foundation for more expansive efforts in this area.\n\nGovernments worldwide use a variety of approaches to promote high vaccination rates among their citizens. 41, [44] [45] [46] The United States is generally unique in its reliance on federal recommendations coupled with state school-entry vaccination requirements as central contributors to the success of vaccination efforts. While specific requirements vary among states, all require that children receive a series of vaccinations as a condition of attending public schools or state-licensed daycare facilities. 47 Every state allows for exemptions based on medical grounds, and nearly all also accept religious or philosophical reasons, although not every state includes all three types of exemptions. 48 No topic related to vaccine ethics in the United States is the subject of more public scrutiny and, at times, controversy than state vaccination requirements. The debate reflects not only the common tension in public health policy between individual (or parental) autonomy and the public good, but also questions over the role and extent of government intervention to protect the well-being of children. Requirements promote vaccination for individual children, while also striving to limit the potential transmission of diseases among communities to the greatest extent possible. School-entry requirements have long been seen by public health officials as essential to maintaining vaccination rates sufficiently high to preserve herd protection, particularly when other vaccine education and promotion efforts have failed. 49 The high vaccination rates associated with herd protection offer benefits against vaccine-preventable diseases to all members of a community, including those too young to receive vaccines, those unable to do so because of medical contraindications, and those who were vaccinated but did not generate the typical, adequate immune response needed for personal protection.\n\nFor those whose views on medical ethics are guided by the primacy of patient autonomy, it is understandable why U.S. vaccination requirements are so contentious. However, few contemporary ethical models place autonomy absolutely above all other considerations. Instead, respect for autonomy is typically one of several factors that should be examined in light of other relevant considerations as part of ethical deliberation and decision making. There is a compelling argument that the lives saved and suffering prevented by vaccination outweigh the potential infringement on personal autonomy created by school mandates. While one may be free to make severe in those nations but uncommon or mild in developed countries. Owing to the limited profitability of such vaccines, manufacturers are often reluctant to invest in these efforts, with occasional exceptions for diseases relevant to national security or biodefense. 57, 58 Much of the remaining work, at both early and late stages of development, is therefore supported by private philanthropies, nonprofit entities, and public-private partnerships. These efforts should continue to be encouraged so that the benefits of vaccination may be more equitably distributed among all populations. For vaccines developed by corporate manufacturers, work should continue to develop financing arrangements that ensure that existing products are available to populations in developing countries that in many cases stand to benefit most from them.\n\nWhen organizing vaccine distribution programs, particular respect should be paid to cultural traditions and social customs specific to communities in the developing world. In locations where healthcare infrastructures are radically different from those of wealthy countries, successful vaccination efforts depend on embracing these differences, valuing the input of community leaders, and striving to develop programs that gain widespread support.\n\nFinally, efforts should be undertaken to better understand the concept of consent in the context of developing world vaccination programs. Informed consent in the strict Western sense may not always be attainable, nor may it be a reasonable expectation owing to the varying structures of communities and families present throughout the world. However, vaccination efforts should remain faithful to the spirit of informed consent, with those administering vaccines taking steps, as appropriate, to ensure that surrogates offer consent for recipients and that local and international ethics committees closely supervise research when individual informed consent is weak.\n\nThe global eradication of smallpox, certified by the World Health Organization in 1980, remains one of the foremost achievements in the history of public health. 59, 60 By means of a coordinated, extensive vaccination campaign, a disease that had been the cause of untold suffering and death for centuries was effectively eliminated. The successful eradication of smallpox added to the enthusiasm for other eradication campaigns against vaccine-preventable diseases, including those then already underway and others hypothesized at the time. This enthusiasm has continued, despite as yet insurmountable challenges in adding additional diseases to the list of those eradicated.\n\nMeasles and polio have long been among the most prominent targets of eradication efforts, and eradication is now mentioned as a target for malaria, a disease for which a partially effective vaccine recently has been developed. 61, 62 In recent years, most attention has been directed toward the potential eradication of polio, a goal that seems tantalizingly close in light of the limited number of identified cases (considerably below 500/year for several years) and the three countries where the disease remains endemic-Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. 63 The unique characteristics of poliovirus have presented significant challenges for the potential eradication of the disease, despite laudable attention and enormous investment in the effort, much of it supported by philanthropies including The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International. 64 Horrific attacks on polio vaccination workers in both Pakistan and Nigeria have added a human toll to the already considerable costs and challenges of the continued pursuit of polio eradication. 65 A rare but very serious adverse event, vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, associated with the oral polio vaccine that has long been central to to delay or omit some or all recommended vaccines. Advocates of this view believe it would clearly signal physicians' unambiguous position on the importance of on-time vaccination, and it would reduce the theoretical risk unvaccinated children would pose to other patients in waiting rooms. Critics, including the American Academy of Pediatrics in a longstanding policy statement, believe dismissal of patients in this context should be reserved for the very rare circumstance when conflicts between the views of the physician and parents present a profound impediment to the provision of care to the child. 52 In nearly all other circumstances, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends continuing to provide care, in hopes that a growing relationship of dialogue and trust between physicians and parents may lead to a changed position over time. Otherwise, children of parents who delay or decline vaccines may be left without advocacy and find themselves cared for by physicians who are willing to accept any (or no) approach to vaccination, a harmful outcome for those children and their communities alike. 4\n\nHealthcare providers have a twofold role in the success of disease-prevention efforts through vaccination. Considerable evidence points to the importance of recommendations from physicians and other providers as being among the most effective ways to influence the perceptions and decisions of parents regarding vaccines, particularly parents with reservations or questions. 53 Amid conflicting information and contentious debates about the safety, effectiveness, and value of vaccines, healthcare providers can help patients (or parents or guardians) make sense of the science and evidence so often obscured by unproven allegations and anecdotal evidence. Doing so effectively requires sustained attention by providers to new information about vaccines-particularly vaccine safety-and the time and willingness to engage parents with concerns or uncertainty.\n\nHealthcare providers can also demonstrate the value of vaccination by ensuring that they are personally up-to-date on recommended vaccines. Beyond the symbolic value of this action, vaccination of providers protects patients, particularly in hospital settings where diseases like influenza are easily transmitted.\n\nMaintaining high vaccination rates against seasonal influenza among healthcare providers has proven to be a considerable challenge, despite the vaccine being recommended for this group since 1981. 54 A variety of programs, including those involving incentives for compliance and appeals to professional duty, have generally failed to yield adequate vaccination rates, prompting an increasing number of healthcare facilities to mandate annual influenza vaccination as a condition of employment. 55 In light of the consistent failure of voluntary approaches to improve influenza vaccination rates among healthcare workers, mandatory vaccination policies, which now exist in more than 600 hospitals and nursing homes throughout North America, are an appropriate response. 56 This is particularly true in light of the increased susceptibility to infection among many patients in hospitals and related settings.\n\nSpecial ethical considerations related to vaccines in the developing world extend beyond the research issues discussed previously. A particular challenge is ensuring that new vaccines are introduced against diseases that are most prevalent or most well in advance of public health emergencies. In particular, it is necessary to achieve and maintain public consensus on the rules that will govern allocation and rationing. Unless the rules are widely perceived as fair-arrived at by reasonable, open procedures-and just-helping persons at greatest risk while maximizing the public good-response plans are unlikely to gain acceptance.\n\nSimilar evidence of the challenges of debating complex scientific, public health, and ethical aspects in the midst of an unfolding health emergency was shown in the response to the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak concentrated in West Africa. Many of these issues pertained to aspects of the response unrelated to vaccines, such as the quarantines and travel bans endorsed by some elected officials in the United States despite a consensus among the scientific community that they were at best unnecessary, if not outright harmful to the response. 74 However, questions also arose regarding how to strike the appropriate balance between rigorously evaluating the safety and effectiveness of potential Ebola vaccines and urgently responding to what, in late 2014, was an unprecedented and out-of-control health crisis in the affected countries. At issue was how to design trials that would provide valid data regarding those vaccines without imposing undue delays on the availability of vaccines (or, similarly, pharmaceuticals) that had at least some potential to aid in the response.\n\nWith valuable coordination from the World Health Organization, the global community quickly debated the relative merits-both scientific and ethical-of randomized controlled trials versus other designs, as Ebola vaccine candidates that had received limited attention and investment for years were quickly accelerated into clinical testing. 75, 76 Proponents of randomized controlled trials noted that those methods would provide the strongest, clearest evidence of the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. 75 Advocates of alternative designssuch as nonrandomized approaches, stepped-wedge designs, and others-believed that the magnitude of an unfolding public health emergency necessitated novel approaches that would make potentially valuable interventions available as quickly as possible to as many people as possible, goals to which randomized designs may not be best suited. 76, 77 By early 2015, large-scale clinical trials of multiple vaccines were ready to commence, incorporating both randomized trials and alternative approaches. However, the apparent waning of the outbreak in the countries most severely affected by Ebola by spring 2015 made it likely that the trials might not provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines. Such evidence, invaluable to the use of Ebola vaccines to prevent and respond to future outbreaks, may now have to be inferred from other sources such as animal studies or immune response analyses.\n\nWhile the global community should be commended for the frank and highly engaged discussion regarding the testing and use of unlicensed interventions as part of the Ebola response, the experience again underscores the value of proactive deliberation on issues related to research methodology and ethics in response to public health emergencies. Also, that Ebola vaccine development languished for years because of a lack of investment from public or private sources and the absence of an obvious commercial market provides further evidence for the need to pursue novel strategies to accelerate vaccine research for diseases that have been neglected by the traditional development pathways unless and until a crisis emerges. 78 \n\nThe study of ethical issues in vaccination has received increasing attention in recent years, but there still have been relatively polio eradication efforts in developing countries presents still further questions regarding the ethics of eradication.\n\nThe obstacles and risks related to the continued pursuit of polio eradication have prompted some observers to suggest that a better overall strategy for global health is to maintain current levels of control while redirecting the sizable resources (both financial and personnel) currently going toward polio eradication campaigns to the many other causes of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. 66 A necessary and important debate has ensued among scientists, ethicists, and global health scholars. 67, 68 The symbolic significance of disease eradication carries an allure that may not necessarily coincide with evidence-based approaches to global health policy. Because global health resources are limited, policymakers and funding sources should ensure that attention is directed to the prevention and treatment strategies that will prevent the most suffering and thereby do the most good.\n\nConcerns about anthrax or smallpox bioterror attacks in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 ; preparedness efforts in the early 2000s for an avian influenza pandemic and the subsequent pandemic caused by a novel strain of H1N1 influenza in 2009-10; and a series of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola have all called attention to the critical role that the development and deployment of vaccines can play in responding to public health and global health emergencies.\n\nThe 2009-10 H1N1 influenza pandemic provided a realtime test of global preparedness and planning for a potential influenza pandemic. While much of this planning had focused on the threat of H5N1 (avian) influenza, those preliminary activities served as a valuable foundation for the response to H1N1 influenza. Vaccines were central to those planning and response efforts. [69] [70] [71] [72] Within weeks of the identification of a potential pandemic strain of influenza in April 2009, the process of developing seed stocks for an eventual vaccine began. 73 The total time required to produce the first doses of vaccine adhered fairly closely to the long-predicted estimate of 6 months. By the time vaccine was widely available in late 2009, public interest had waned, in part a result of a growing understanding of the relatively modest severity of the virus.\n\nDespite having overall impacts well below some of the most dire forecasts, the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza pandemic was still a significant cause of infection, illness, and death worldwide, particularly among children. It thereby provided valuable knowledge and experience that will inform subsequent planning and response activities for public health emergencies for which vaccines may be available, including potential pandemics and acts of bioterrorism. Among the topics that have received scrutiny are the communication of accurate information about the severity of threats amid uncertainty, the efficiency of vaccine development and the need for greater production capacity and novel technologies, the adequacy of testing and postlicensure safety surveillance, the development of appropriate prioritization strategies, the structure of financing and distribution systems, and the allocation of vaccine to countries in the developing world. As these retrospective analyses are translated into plans for subsequent public health emergencies, public health officials should aim above all to ensure that vaccination programs are designed to maximize benefits and minimize risks fairly among communities, populations, and nations.\n\nAs demonstrated in 2009, the urgency that follows the arrival of public health threats makes thoughtful discussion of these topics in real-time all but impossible, making it all the more important to engage in public deliberation and planning Ultimately, however, the success of vaccination depends on maintaining widespread public trust, without which vaccination programs cannot succeed. 23 Preserving trust requires an unwavering awareness that the remarkable societal benefits of vaccination ultimately involve individual people who are entitled to respect, in a broad sense, that manifests itself at every point in the vaccine life cycle.
