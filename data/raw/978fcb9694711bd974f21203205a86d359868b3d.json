{"title": "PCR for Detection of Oseltamivir Resistance in Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Technical Appendix Samples and Sample Collection", "body": "A total of 11 paired nasopharyngeal swab specimens and sputum specimens were collected from 9 patients who were given a diagnosis of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, Shanghai, China, during April 4-27, 2013 . Sputum samples treated with 4% sodium hydroxide solution and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were placed in virus transport medium (minimum essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 5% penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin B) immediately after collection and subsequently stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All the samples were detected by using a hemagglutinin 7-specific real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to determine viral load, as described by Hu et al. (1) .\n\nTemplate RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swab specimens of patients infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture's instructions. Extracted RNAs were amplified by using primers N9-NA346F and N9-NA925R, which are specific for the neuraminidase (NA) gene of influenza A(H7N9) virus (online Technical Appendix Table 1 ). The PCR products were inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and clones were sequenced by using primers N9-NA697F and N9-NA943R (online Technical Appendix Table 1 ). Clones containing specific fragments with NA R292 or292 Page 2 of 5 K (N2 numbering) were used to generate plasmid standards, which were serially diluted 10-fold (10 1 -10 11 copies) in sterile water and used in assay validation.\n\nAvian Influenza Data database were aligned by using PrimerExpress software version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). One pair of primers and 2 minor groove-binding probes were designed to discriminate the codon for lysine (AAG) at position 292 in the NA gene for the mutant virus strain and the codon for arginine (AGG) at position 292 in the NA gene for the wild-type virus strain (online Technical Appendix Table 1 ). The assay was composed of 2 reactions: 1 contained the FAM-labeled probe specific for the 292K mutant strain and 1 contained the VIC-labeled probe specific for the R292 wild-type strain. and 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 40 s. The assay was performed by using the ABI StepOne Plus System (Applied Biosystems), and data were processed by using\n\nStepOne software version 2.2 (Applied Biosystems).\n\nResults were considered positive if the cycle threshold (C t ) values were <35 cycles and the \u0394Rn values (representing changes in the linear amplification plot of the fluorescent signal) were >30,000 for the FAM-labeled probe and 11,000 for the VIC-labeled probe.\n\nThe baseline and threshold values were set by default. Cross-hybridization was not Page 3 of 5 observed between the 292R probe and the 292K plasmid or the 292K probe and the 292R plasmid.\n\nTo test the ability of the assay to detect the 292K mutant when both variants are present at various ratios and different viral loads, we prepared mixtures containing the 292K plasmid and the R292 plasmid, respectively, at copy numbers of 10 4 at the following Table 2 . The \u0394C t K -R value for the mixture at a ratio of 50:50 was used as the assay-specific normalization value in determining the percentage of 292K mutant in mixed populations as dscribed by Liu et al. (2) . The percentage of the 292K population in the sample was calculated by using the formula of Liu et al. (2): \u0394C t K -R = C t K -C t R -\u0394C t k50, where C t K is the threshold cycle for 292K detection, C t R is the threshold cycle for R292 detection, and \u0394C t k50 is the \u0394C t K -R value of the R:K mixture with 10 4 copies at a ratio of 50:50, which was used for normalization. The percentage of 292K on the population was 1/(2 \u0394C t k -R + 1) \u00d7 100.\n\nPatient 15 was a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre on April 7, 2013, because of fever and cough with white sputum for 10 days and polypnea for 5 days. At admission, he had a temperature of 39\u00b0C, a pulse rate of 96 beats/min, and a respiration rate of 26 breaths/min. He had hypertension as an underlying condition. Influenza A(H7N9) virus was detected in throat swab specimens on the day of admission. The patient had received oseltamivir, 75 mg twice a day, on April 5.\n\nHe was then given oseltamivir, 150 mg twice a day, on April 13-15, and peramivir on April 16, He was also given corticosteroids during April 5-26. Extracorporeal membrane Page 4 of 5 oxygenation was used on June 1 just before the patient died of multiple organ dysfunction.\n\nInfluenza A (H7N9) virus was weakly detected by quantitative PCR in a throat swab specimen obtained 48 days after admission of the patient.
