{"title": "A duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses", "body": "Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes to equines, birds, and humans and causes a febrile disease (including encephalitis) with a significant frequency of fatal outcomes. With an overall case fatality rate of approximately 36% (Deresiewicz et al., 1997) , it is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides. EEEV is a spherical, enveloped virus with an 11.5-kb genome consisting of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA. The 5\u2032 end of the alphavirus genome encodes for the nonstructural proteins (NSP1-4), and the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes for the structural proteins (core and envelope proteins). The E1 and E2 proteins, virally encoded surface glycoproteins, are the target of numerous serological reactions and tests. The E2 protein is the site of most of the neutralizing epitopes (Roehrig, 1986) , and the E1 protein contains more conserved, cross-reactive epitopes (Dalrymple et al., 1976; Wolcott et al., 1984) . Apart from the six C-terminal codons, the E1 gene is largely conserved among alphaviruses (Powers et al., 2001) , although there is sufficient diversity to allow selection of primers and probes that are specific for the EEEV genome.\n\nSt. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is also an arthropod-borne virus. This virus belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex within the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. SLEV is endemic in the United States and circulates in a transmission cycle involving Culex mosquitoes and passerine birds (Tsai and Mitchell, 1989) , with humans and other vertebrates as incidental hosts. Clinical disease caused by SLEV infection can vary from mild symptoms, including febrile illness and headache, to severe disease, including meningitis and encephalitis. Reports of case fatalities range from 5 to 20% (Tsai and Mitchell, 1989) although the numbers are higher still among the elderly population. The virus has a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11-kb. The 5\u2032 end of the viral genome consists of genes for the structural proteins, and the 3\u2032 end consists of genes for the nonstructural proteins. The NS5 gene encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is reported as being the most highly conserved of the flavivirus nonstructural proteins (Iacono-Connors et al., 1992; Scaramozzino et al., 2001) .\n\nSerology is the gold standard for diagnostic testing of arboviruses. However, serological tests have certain limitations; cross-reactivity of flaviviral antibodies is problematic in immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (MAC-ELISA), and plaque reduction neutralization is time-consuming, cumbersome and requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment (Calisher, 1994; Russell and Dwyer, 2000; Martin et al., 2004) . The traditional method of virus isolation also has the latter limitations and in addition, since the period of viremia is generally short, the likelihood of obtaining an isolate is low (Calisher, 1994) . RT-PCR is a rapid and sensitive method that is being used increasingly as an adjunct to serology for the diagnosis of arboviruses. Case in point is the wide-spread use of PCR for the detection of West Nile virus (WNV) (Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001; Briese et al., 2000) .\n\nOur aim was to develop a duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of EEEV and SLEV, to test cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients suspected of having arboviral encephalitis. Since there was not sufficient sequence information on the NS5 region of SLEV strains available in the GenBank database, we determined the sequence of an approximately 1-kb region of the NS5 gene for each of 25 strains. Primers and probes were then selected from conserved sequences in this region.\n\nIn order to construct a positive control for the EEEV assay, conventional RT-PCR was performed using primers EEE-E1-F and EEE-E1-R (Table 1) targeting EEEV strain 69-7836 (a 1969 isolate from New York State). The resultant 146-bp fragment of the E1 gene of EEEV was cloned into the PCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmid (pNT21) was linearized and used to transcribe a control RNA transcript containing the realtime RT-PCR target sequence, utilizing the T7 RiboMax Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, Madison, WI). The transcript RNAs were subjected to two rounds of DNase I digestion and were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and sepharose chromatography. The purified transcript was quantified by measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm. Ten-fold serial dilutions of genomic EEEV strain 69-7836 viral RNA and the transcript were made, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. A standard curve was constructed, allowing quantitation of the genomic viral RNA. Conventional RT-PCR was performed using primers SLE-NS5-F1 and SLE-NS5-R1 (Table 1) targeting SLEV strain MSI-7. A plasmid (pNT26) was constructed that contained the 63-bp NS5 target fragment as described above. The SLEV transcript was made and quantified and, using this transcript, genomic RNA was quantified as described above.\n\nEEEV and SLEV cultures were amplified in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell cultures in a BSL-3 facility. Since EEEV is a CDC Select Agent (SA), the virus and RNA were handled by SA-approved personnel only, in a BSL-3 lab with controlled access, certified under protocol number C2005 0318-0344. Powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) were worn at all times when personnel were working with infectious EEEV.\n\nSixty-nine SLEV strains were cultured in Vero cells (Table 2) . Sixty-six of these strains were received by the Arbovirus Laboratory from the World Reference Center of Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas.\n\nGenomic copy numbers of cell culture-propagated EEEV and SLEV genomic RNAs were determined from a standard curve produced from the assay of 10-fold dilutions of purified and quantified EEEV and SLEV RNA transcripts. The RNA from the cell culture-propagated EEEV and SLEV and the RNA transcripts were assayed with the EEEV E1 and SLEV NS5 primer and probe sets (Table 1) . We quantified genomic SLEV and EEEV RNA by performing real-time RT-PCR on serial dilutions of transcript and genomic RNAs and then constructing a standard curve, using serial dilutions of quantified transcript RNA as standards. In addition, a no RT control was performed at a high transcript RNA concentration in order to ensure that the bulk of the DNA had been digested.\n\nEEEV RNA transcript (500 gene copies/reaction) was used as the positive control. The advantage of using RNA transcript rather than genomic RNA as the positive control is that the RNA transcript, unlike the genomic EEEV RNA, can be handled in a BSL-2 laboratory that is not SA-certified, by non SA-approved personnel; diagnostic testing for EEEV is generally performed in BSL-2 facilities. Genomic MSI-7 RNA (1,100 gene copies/reaction) was used as the positive control for the SLEV assay.\n\nAs an internal nucleic acid extraction control, and for detection of potential PCR inhibition, each clinical specimen was spiked, during the lysis step of the extraction process, with a known quantity of green fluorescent protein (GFP) RNA transcript (2,200 gc/ul). After completion of the extraction, a 1/10 dilution of the extracted nucleic acid was analyzed by a one-step realtime RT-PCR with a primer and probe set specific for GFP (Table 1) . A positive result, with a Ct value falling within the defined range (34-38), from the GFP assay confirmed the successful extraction of nucleic acid. \n\nNucleic acid was extracted from specimens using the NucliSens miniMAG or easyMAG system (bioMerieux, Durham, NC). Two hundred and fifty microliters of each specimen were added to 2 ml of lysis buffer. Five microliters of GFP transcript (2,100 gene copies/\u03bcl) were spiked into the lysed sample. Following miniMAG or easyMAG extraction, the nucleic acid was eluted in 50 or 55 \u03bcl of elution buffer, respectively.\n\nReal-time RT-PCR for the detection of SLEV and EEEV viruses was performed using primers and probe developed in-house (Table 1 ). The EEEV probe was labeled with the reporter 6carboxyfluorescein [6-FAM] at the 5\u2032 end and a black hole quencher [BHQ1] (Operon, Huntsville, AL) at the 3\u2032end. The two SLE probes were each labeled with the reporter VIC \u2122 at the 5\u2032 end and a minor groove binder [MGB] (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the 3\u2032 end. Amplification was carried out in a 25-\u03bcl volume reaction using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.5 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 ROX reference dye, 400 nM each of four SLEV primers, 500 nM each of two EEEV primers, 75 nM each of two SLEV probes, and 200 nM EEEV probe. The reactions were incubated at 48\u00b0 C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0 C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. A separate real-time RT-PCR for the detection of GFP was performed with the primers and probes listed in Table 1 . The GFP probe was labeled with the reporter 6-carboxyfluorescein [6-FAM] at the 5\u2032 end and the quencher 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine [TAMRA] at the 3\u2032 end. The reaction consisted of universal buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the forward and reverse primers at 900 nM each, and 250 nM probe . The reaction conditions were as above. PCR reactions were performed using an ABI 7500 instrument.\n\nNucleic acid from SLEV cultures was extracted with the MasterPure\u2122 Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). RNA was transcribed to cDNA with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). PCR to amplify a portion of the NS5 region of SLEV was performed essentially as reported previously (Fulop et al., 1993;  Table 1 ), except that an initial incubation time of 95\u00b0C for 15 min was used to activate the HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and were stained by ethidium bromide. The PCR products, which were approximately 958-bp in size, were extracted from the gel and spun through an Ultrafree-DA Filter Device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Sequencing reactions of the PCR products were performed with multiple primers shown in Table 1 . The concentration of each primer was 3.2 pmol, and sequencing reactions were performed at the Wadsworth Center Molecular Genetics Core facility on an automated DNA sequencer Model 3100 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The obtained sequences were submitted to the GenBank database (see Table 2 for accession numbers).\n\nSequence information was obtained for approximately 950-bp of the NS5 gene from each of 25 different strains of SLEV (Table 2 ). The sequences were aligned with the MEGA 4 software (Tamura et al., 2007) . Regions that showed minimal sequence variation were chosen as candidate regions for primer/probe target selection. The same process was repeated for the E1 region from sequences from multiple strains of EEEV found in the GenBank database. Primers and probes were selected with the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (Table 1) . For detection of the maximum number of SLE strains, we selected two forward primers, two reverse primers and two probes, since we were unable to find one set of primers and probe that were 100% homologous with all strains. Each of the forward primers, reverse primers, and probes had 1 mismatch.\n\nBecause of the SA status of EEEV, a positive control for the assay was constructed that could be used in a BSL-2 laboratory by non-SA approved personnel, thereby facilitating the assay's diagnostic application. The control was an RNA transcript containing a 146-bp portion of the envelope-coding gene of EEEV. This control was also used for the quantification of genomic EEEV RNA. The SLEV transcript which was used for the quantification of SLEV genomic RNA was prepared from a recombinant plasmid containing a 63-bp portion of the NS5-coding gene of SLEV strain MSI-7.\n\nAfter construction and quantification of the controls for the assay, various real-time PCR kits from several manufacturers were evaluated for the optimization of our duplex assay. These were: TaqMan Primer optimization was performed with primer concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 nM, and probe optimization was performed with probe concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 nM. For a TaqMan assay, optimal performance is achieved by selecting primer/probe concentrations that provide the lowest Ct and the highest \u0394Rn for a fixed amount of target template (Cirino et al., 2007) . The Ct and \u0394Rn data taken together show that the optimal SLEV primer concentrations were 400 nM each, and the optimal SLEV probe concentrations were 75 nM each. Optimal EEEV primer concentrations were 500 nM each, while the optimal EEEV probe concentration was 200 nM.\n\nSerial dilutions of the SLEV and EEEV transcripts were made, and the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was performed. The assay can detect a range between 5 and 5 \u00d7 10 6 gene copies of EEEV, and a range between 10 and 3 \u00d7 10 6 gene copies for SLEV. We were consistently able to detect 5 gene copies of EEEV target (performed 12 times) and 10 gene copies of SLEV target (performed 14 times). The assay range and sensitivity of the duplex assay when compared to the SLE and EEE assays performed separately as singleplex assays gave similar results indicating that there is no negative interference between the primer probe sets of the two assays (data not shown).\n\nIn order to determine the specificity of the assay, we performed the assay using high concentrations (for each virus approximately 10 6 gene copies) of nucleic acid from the following organisms: Cox A9, Cox B12, Echo 9, HCoV 229E, hMPV, FluA H1, FluA H3, FluB, RSV, HRV, SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HSV 1 and 2, VZV, WEE virus, Highlands J virus, DENV1-4, POW virus (representatives of lineage I and II), WNV, YF virus, MVE virus, JE virus, Corynebacterium xerosis, Group A Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria meningitidis groups B, C, and Y, Neisseria subflava, Streptococcus sanguis, and Steptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 10A, 11A and 18F. No cross-reactivity was observed between the EEEV and SLEV primer/ probe sets and any of the organisms selected in the specificity panel. PCR results for the panel were all negative; therefore, the assay was specific upon testing a wide range of pathogens.\n\nEEEV is the sole species in the EEEV antigenic complex and is divided into North American and South American antigenic varieties based on hemagglutination inhibition tests. On the basis of nucleotide sequencing and serological tests, including plaque reduction neutralization tests, four major lineages/clusters (clusters 1-4) with distinct antigenic subtypes have been identified (Brault et al., 1999) . Serial dilutions were made of the RNA from representatives of each cluster (Table 3) . We then performed the singleplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of EEEV on various RNA dilutions in order to determine whether nucleic acid from the 12 different strains would be amplified by the real-time RT-PCR reaction. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the various nucleic acid dilutions in a BSL-3 laboratory. Results showed that all 12 strains were detected and amplified by the EEEV primer/probe set.\n\nNucleic acid was extracted from each strain of amplified SLEV, and dilutions were made and tested in the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay. All strains were detected and amplified. Since we were unable to obtain patient specimens that were positive for either SLEV or EEEV, we spiked SLEV culture and EEEV transcript, at each of three dilutions, into negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. Appropriate dilutions of SLEV strain MSI-7 culture were made to obtain the high (9.9 \u00d7 10 3 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 9,000 gc/reaction), medium (990 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 90 gc/reaction), and low (99 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 9 gc/reaction) concentrations. Similarly, a range of nucleic acid concentrations that included high (5.5 \u00d7 10 3 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 5,000 gc/reaction), medium (5.5 \u00d7 10 2 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 500 gc/reaction), and low (550 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 50 gc/reaction) were selected for the EEEV transcript. These dilutions were then spiked into CSF that had previously tested negative for EEEV and SLEV. Forty negative samples, were either not spiked or spiked with one of three concentrations of SLEV culture, or of EEEV transcript in various combinations (Table 4 ). All 40 blinded samples were also spiked with a known amount of GFP RNA transcript (2,200 gc/\u03bcl), which acts as the internal control. RNA was extracted from the specimens using the NucliSens easyMAG system. GFP was then detected in the sample via real-time RT-PCR in order to determine extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors (Table 4 ).\n\nFor each of the blinded samples, the high, medium, and low gene copy samples could all be detected indicating minimal loss in sensitivity following nucleic acid extraction ( Table 4 ). All of the negative extraction controls had Ct values of >45, indicating that false positives were not detected, and that no cross contamination had occurred during extraction of the samples. Also, all real-time RT-PCR experiments included positive EEEV (500 gc/reaction) and SLEV (1,100 gc/reaction) controls. Both EEEV and SLEV positive controls gave Ct values within the acceptable ranges for each (29-32 and 31-34 respectively). The Ct values for GFP for all the samples were within the acceptable range (34-38), with the exception of one sample (Table  4 , sample with Ct of 38.66) which showed slight inhibition. The EEEV-spike and SLEV-spike were both detected for this sample. In general, if a clinical specimen showed a higher than acceptable GFP Ct value, the recommendation would be to repeat the extraction and real-time RT-PCR.\n\nIn a separate experiment, 30 different negative CSF specimens were spiked with one of three concentrations of EEEV culture (5 \u00d7 10 4 , 5 \u00d7 10 3 , 5 \u00d7 10 2 gc/250 \u03bcl CSF equivalent to 5,000, 500, and 50 gc/reaction). Following nucleic acid extraction with an internal GFP control, we performed real-time RT-PCR for the detection of EEEV. In addition, we performed the singleplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of EEEV on RNA extracts from five uninfected mosquito pools and on RNA extracts from five EEEV-infected mosquito pools (log 10 pfu ranging from 0.4 to 4.4/0.1 ml). The assay correctly identified all specimens, showing that it is suitable for use on vector specimens as well as viral culture.\n\nHuman infections by SLEV and EEEV are relatively rare although EEEV infection of equines occurs regularly. Nevertheless, severe morbidity and mortality associated with these two arboviruses make them important public health concerns. The surveillance of virologic activity in natural hosts, as well as of disease in humans and horses, is essential for early detection of outbreaks and implementation of vector control measures. Molecular detection by RT-PCR is an ideal method for detection of these viruses in hosts, since it is rapid, sensitive, specific, reproducible, and amenable to automation. RT-PCR has been used for the detection of arboviruses at the group level (Sanchez-Seco et al., 2001; Bronzoni et al., 2004; Scaramozzino et al., 2001; Pfeffer et al., 1997) and for specific detection of individual arboviruses (O'Guinn et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2002; Linssen et al., 2000; Lambert et al., 2003; Lanciotti and Kerste, 2001) , as well as for a sequential detection at both levels (Bronzoni et al., 2005) .\n\nIn terms of geographic distribution, EEEV is found mainly in the eastern half of the United States, with most transmissions occurring near freshwater hardwood swamps in states along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf Coast, and in the Great Lakes region. Between 1964 and 2004, the greatest numbers of human cases in the U.S. occurred in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/eeefact.htm). SLEV in contrast, is found throughout the 48 contiguous states, but periodic epidemics have only been documented in the Midwest and the Southeastern U.S. (including Florida) (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/sle/index.html; Wells et al., 1990) . A molecular assay that detects both SLEV and EEEV thus has considerable application for patients suspected of having arboviral encephalitis who reside in these areas, as well as travelers who could have come into contact with infected mosquitoes.\n\nWe report the development of a duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of SLEV and EEEV. The targets for the PCR assay are sited within conserved regions of the genome; namely, the E1 gene of EEEV and the NS5 gene of SLEV. The assay is intended for patient CSF samples but can easily be used for vector surveillance. We found the optimal PCR kit for this assay to be the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System. The linear assay range is 5 to 5 \u00d7 10 6 gc/reaction for EEEV, and 10 to 3 \u00d7 10 6 gc/reaction for SLEV. The sensitivity of the assay is 5 gc/reaction for EEEV and 10 gc/reaction for SLEV. The assay is specific, in that the primers and probes did not cross-react with any of the organisms in the specificity panel that we used. The assay detected all of the strains of SLEV (69 strains) and EEEV (12 strains) that we tested. We compared our assay to a previously published real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay for the detection of SLEV which targets the envelope gene (Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001) . Although the two assays were similar in sensitivity and specificity, the previously published assay did not detect all SLEV strains; four of the 69 SLEV strains in Table 2 (CorAn 9275, CorAn 9124, GML 903797, and GML 903369) were not detected (data not shown). This is not surprising, given that the primers and probe had multiple mismatches when aligned with the genome sequence of these strains; as many as 10 mismatches in total occurred for each of strains CorAn 9275 and CorAn 9124. In our SLEV assay, the primers and probes were selected to enable the detection of a greater variety of strains by targeting the conserved NS5 region.\n\nThe spiking experiments in patient CSF specimens show that our extraction procedure is efficient, i.e. there is little loss of virus or internal control during the process, and that the assay correctly identifies the EEEV or SLEV genome present in the specimen. In addition, many of the samples had both viruses present; in some cases at high concentration. Nevertheless, detection of both viral genomes occurred just as efficiently as if there was no competitor virus present (Table 4 ), indicating that neither assay was inhibited.\n\nThe use of the GFP internal control ensures that an extraction and PCR inhibition control are included in the assay. It should be noted, that in our experience, after having tested well over 1,000 CSF specimens, CSF specimens rarely (<1%) exhibit significant PCR inhibition whereas a larger number of plasma and serum specimens show inhibition. We would therefore recommend that if plasma or serum specimens are tested, the nucleic acid extracts from the specimens are not diluted prior to performing the GFP real-time RT-PCR assay in order to detect inhibition more accurately since the pre-dilution may overcome some of the inhibitory effect.\n\nOur data show that the duplex assay is highly specific, reproducible, and sensitive; furthermore, with a turn-around time of approximately 5 hr (including the nucleic acid extraction step), it is a rapid method of detecting EEEV and SLEV RNA in patient samples. Additionally, it is suitable for high-throughput approaches useful in surveillance activities. Primers and probes used in real-time RT-PCR assays for SLEV and EEEV and for internal control detection and for PCR and sequencing of the NS5 region of genomes of SLEV strains. Average Ct values obtained when the EEEV, SLEV and GFP real-time RT-PCR assays were performed on extracts of cerebrospinal fluid specimens spiked with SLEV culture and EEEV transcript. NTC, no template control; the high, medium and low spikes for SLEV were 9000, 90, 9 gene copies/reaction respectively; the high, medium and low spikes for EEEV were 5000, 500, 50 gene copies/ reaction respectively. The average numbers are from 10 assays performed in duplicate for virus detection and performed singly for GFP detection."}
