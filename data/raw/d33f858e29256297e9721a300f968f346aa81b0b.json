The active site residues are represented in line and the zinc ion is shown as grey 108 sphere. The key residues involved in HsLTA4H's S1 subsite modulation were represented in stick.\n\nImages generated with PyMOL. \n\nThe catalytic zinc ion is shown as grey sphere. Residues involved in S1' plasticity are 121 shown in stick. In blue, residues which reduce the cavity width; in red, residues which 122 modulate the cavity depth.

In the \"Phe-In\" conformation, Phe896 is oriented into the 135 active site inducing a partial closing of the S1 subsite. The active site cavity was computed by\n\nKVFinder. The flexible 891-998 loop was represented in cartoon and the key Phe896 residue involved 137 in S1 subsite modulation was represented in stick. "}
