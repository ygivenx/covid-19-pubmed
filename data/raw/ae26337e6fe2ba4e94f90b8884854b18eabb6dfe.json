The column was washed with (0.16 mg/ml) (Bonilla et al., 1997) .\n\nTo determine membrane binding, plasmid DNAs were 12 column volumes of column buffer and the MBP-3CLpro fusion protein was eluted with column buffer con-transcribed and translated in the presence of microsomes. Following translation, membranes were pelleted taining 10 mM maltose. The concentration of the fusion protein was estimated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u040a (Echeverri and Dasgupta, 1995) and then resuspended in 11 low against known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein.

The p29 protein is therefore specifically expressed from the 3CLpro encoding plasmid, TACAGAACC-3).

This plasmid encodes a precursor protein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 72 kDa that analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In vitro expression of pET21-3C resulted in the production of a protein with an apparent contains the 3CLpro as well as the two QS sites at its junctions with the flanking hydrophobic domains.

This 29-kDa protein (p29) is neither present in translation 3CLpro when the translation reaction was supplemented with microsomes (lane 2). These results suggest a requirement for microsomal membranes for the processing of the MHV-A59 3CLpro from the flanking hydrophobic regions.\n\nThe catalytic residues of the 3CLpro have been previously identified . Amino acid residues His3374 and Cys3478 were shown to be essential for proteinase activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis a mutant of pET21-HD1.3C.HD2 was created in which the catalytic residue Cys3478 was replaced by alanine (C3478A). This C3478A mutant was utilized in order to determine whether or not the observed processing of p29 was dependent on the proteinase activity of the 3CLpro itself. The cysteine proteinase inhibitor, NEM, was also used for this purpose. In vitro transcriptiontranslation of the wild-type pET21-HD1.3C.HD2 in the presence of the inhibitor resulted in a decreased production of the 29-kDa proteinase product (Fig. 3, lane 3) . In translation reactions with the C3478A mutant, p29 production was abolished (lane 4). These results demonstrate that the 29-kDa 3CLpro results from its own autocatalytic processing from the flanking domains.\n\nTranslation of pET21-HD1.3C.HD2 in the absence of after 90 min of translation. In contrast, p29 was detected by 45 min and its levels increased steadily in translation reactions performed in the presence of microsomes.

In the construct pET21-HD1.3C, the entire HD2 was deleted whereas in pET21-3C.HD2, all of HD1 from the parental construct was removed.\n\nThe results obtained from in vitro expression of these constructs are shown in Fig. 5B . In all cases the fulllength translation products detected migrated faster than expected from their predicted molecular weights. pET21-HD1.3C.Hind3, pET21-HD1.3C, and pET21-3C.HD2 gave rise to primary translation products with apparent molecular weights of 46, 43, and 37 kDa, respectively (predicted molecular weights 62, 55, and 51 kDa). The parental construct, pET21-HD1.3C.HD2, is shown in lanes 1 and 2 for comparison. As expected, this construct demonstrated a requirement for microsomal membranes in order for the 29-kDa 3CLpro to be efficiently released from the precursor protein.

The recombinant 3CLpro, we did not detect any processing from this substrate. The precursor protein was then used as a substrate in a posttranslation proteolytic assay with the recombinant 3CLpro. In the absence of microsomal membranes, the precursor generated from pET21-HD1.3C.HD2 C3478A was processed by the recombinant proteinase, albeit inefficiently (lane 9). The addition of microsomal membranes during translation did not enhance the ability of this precursor to be processed by the recombinant 3CLpro (lane 10). This suggests that membranes are not involved in the presentation of the QS cleavage sites to the exogenously added recombinant proteinase. It is clear, however, that the NX.3C C3478A precursor is much more efficiently cleaved by the recombinant proteinase. This suggests that the presence of the hydrophobic regions in the HD1.3C.HD2 precursor contributes to its inefficiency as a substrate for trans cleavage and that this inefficiency is not overcome by the addition of membranes.\n\nWe also used the wild-type precursor HD1.3C.HD2, carrying an active 3CLpro, as a substrate for the recombinant proteinase. This precursor, by itself, is able to undergo autoproteolytic cleavage giving rise to the 29-kDa proteinase even in the absence of microsomes (lane 3), during the 16-hr incubation.

In addition to a full-length translation product of 43 kDa and the 29-kDa 3CLpro, translation of pET21-HD1.3C also yields another major translation product of 35 kDa. p35 is most likely a product of internal initiation since its synthesis is not inhibited by NEM and it contains the carboxy-terminal end of the 3CLpro as evidenced by its immunoprecipitation by UP313 (data not shown). mediately upstream of HD1 in the construct pET21-HD1.3C. The resulting plasmid, pET21-HA.HD1.3C, was used in membrane association assays and compared to pET21-HD1.3C. In translation reactions using both plasmids the 3CLpro was located almost exclusively in the soluble fraction of the reactions (Fig. 8, lanes 1 and 3) . In the pellet fraction, both p22 and p15 were present in each case (lanes 2 and 4) . Immunoprecipitation of the soluble and pellet fractions with the antibody 12CA5 prior to SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the full-length precursor (43 kDa) in the soluble fraction and the 22-kDa protein, as well as the full-length precursor, in the pellet fraction of the pET21-HA.HD1.3C translation reaction (lanes 7 and 8). No proteins were detected upon immunoprecipitation of the soluble and pellet fractions of the pET21-HD1.3C translation reaction with the 12CA5 antibody (lanes 5 and p15 protein may simply represent a degradation product of p22. These observations represent the first demonstration of a physical association between HD1 and mem-on the activity of the 3CLpro. In addition, we were able to detect three other polypeptides with molecular weights of branes for a coronavirus in vitro. approximately 37, 22, and 15 kDa that were present in the pellet fraction of translations with the wild-type construct.\n\nDISCUSSION These bands were not present in the pellet fraction of translations using the C3478A mutant, suggesting that A common strategy adopted by positive-stranded RNA viruses is the expression of a large polyprotein precursor, these are products of processing by the 3CLpro. That these bands are present almost exclusively in the pellet followed by the processing of this precursor polyprotein into individual, mature viral proteins. Responsible for fraction implies that they are associated with the membranes and may therefore represent the fully processed these processing events are several viral-encoded proteinases whose significance in viral genomic expression hydrophobic domains or partially processed products containing either hydrophobic domain. In particular, p37 and replication have been well documented (Dougherty and Semler, 1993) . For the murine coronavirus, two such has an electrophoretic migration identical to the precursor protein encoded by the plasmid pET21-3C.HD2. This viral proteinase activities have been identified. Both the PLP-1 and 3CLpro, whose proteolytic activities have band, therefore, likely represents a partially processed product containing the 3CLpro and the carboxy-terminal been demonstrated in vitro (Baker et al., 1990 (Baker et al., , 1993 Lu et al., 1995) , are encoded as part hydrophobic domain.\n\nWe have also performed membrane association of the large polyprotein precursor that results from the translation of the viral RNA genome. Flanked by hy-assays using our truncated constructs (Fig. 7) . In all cases, centrifugation of the lysates following in vitro drophobic domains, the serine-like proteinase, 3CLpro, is believed to be the principal proteinase responsible for translation led to the distribution of the 3CLpro almost exclusively in the soluble fraction of the reactions (lanes the processing of the large precursor polyprotein into individual, functional replicase proteins. As many as 11 5, 7, and 9). Interestingly, both the p22 and p15 proteins were also detected in the pellet fractions of transcrip-potential 3CLpro cleavage sites have been predicted flanking the potentially important domains encoded in tion-translation reactions using pET21-HD1.3C.Hind3 (lane 6) and pET21-HD1.3C (lane 8), but not pET21-gene 1 (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) . These include cleavage sites that flank the putative polymerase, 3C.HD2 (lane 10). This observation suggests that these two proteins are related to the first hydrophobic domain helicase, and growth factor-like regions as well as cleavage sites surrounding the 3CLpro. Processing at several (HD1) rather than the second (HD2).\n\nIn order to identify HD1 from among the processed of these sites has already been demonstrated in several coronaviruses (Grotzinger et al., 1996; Lu et al., 1995 ; products, we placed the influenza virus HA epitope im- 1 and 3) . This protein, however, is not immunoprecipitated by 12CA5 (lanes 5 and 7) , further supporting the suggestion that this protein is a product of internal initiation (see legend to Fig. 5B ). Tibbles et al., 1996; Ziebuhr et al., 1995) . For MHV-A59, 3C-like proteinase, however, this requirement for membranes is not absolute for the MHV-A59 3CLpro since the QS dipeptide flanking the N-terminus of the proteinase has been demonstrated to be processed by the extended incubations of the in vitro translation of pET21-HD1.3C.HD2 in the absence of microsomal membranes 3CLpro in vitro .\n\nIn this study, we identified the 3CLpro using an anti-produced low levels of p29 processing.

This requirement for membranes suggests an inter-was identified from in vitro translations of several plasmids encoding the proteinase as part of a precursor action between the precursor protein and membranes in order to achieve the proper protein conformation neces-polyprotein, and also from lysates of MHV-A59-infected cells. In both cases, the 3CLpro migrated on SDS-poly-sary for efficient processing at the flanking QS cleavage sites resulting in the release of the 29-kDa proteinase. acrylamide gels as a 29-kDa protein. This is similar in size to, and is presumably the same protein as the pre-Moreover, the inability of microsomal membranes to enhance proteolytic activity posttranslationally suggests viously reported p27 3CLpro . Because the epitope recognized by the UP313 antibody is at the that this interaction occurs cotranslationally and may involve the insertion of the hydrophobic domains into the extreme end of the proteinase domain adjacent to the predicted QS cleavage site at the junction between the membranes. The membrane requirement is directly related to the 3CLpro and HD2, we are confident that this p29 protein represents the full-length 3CLpro.\n\npresence of hydrophobic sequences flanking both termini of the 3CLpro. The translation reactions of pET21-We also demonstrate in this report a requirement for microsomal membranes for the efficient processing of HD1.3C and pET21-3C.HD2, constructs encoding only one of the flanking hydrophobic domains, produced simi-the 3CLpro from the flanking hydrophobic sequences.

The only hydrophobic well as all processed products, partial or complete. It has been our experience that these precursors migrate sequences encoded in this plasmid flank the carboxyterminal end of the 3CLpro and, based on our observa-on SDS -polyacrylamide gels with electrophoretic mobilities faster than that predicted based on their pri-tions, would not be expected to require microsomes for autoproteolysis. Not surprisingly, pGpro did not require mary amino acid sequence. This apparent conflict between the predicted and observed molecular weights the presence of microsomes for in vitro activity (Lu et al., 1996 . We speculate that when both termini of the of the precursor and processed proteins was previously reported in investigations of both the HCV 229E 3CLpro are flanked by hydrophobic sequences, these domains may aggregate together in the absence of mem- (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) and MHV-A59 3C-like proteinases .

The amino acid sequences representing the 3CLpro itself, 29 kDa, is smaller than its predicted molecular weight of 33 kDa. Furthermore, each of the the 3CLpro that lie in the middle of this precursor inevitably become misfolded, resulting in an inefficient protein-3CLpro-encoding plasmids used in our study resulted in primary translation products with electrophoretic ase.

However, such antibodies are not, at This speculation is further supported by the observation that a recombinant 3CLpro supplied in trans is present, available for either of the hydrophobic domains. Instead, we placed an epitope (HA-) tag imme-able to efficiently process a precursor protein generated from the pET21-NX.3C C3478A plasmid which diately upstream of the HD1 in the construct pET21-HA.HD1.3C and used the 12CA5 antibody directed does not encode any hydrophobic sequences. However, the HD1.3C.HD2 C3478A precursor, containing against this epitope to unambiguously identify the precursor protein encoded by this plasmid. This precursor both hydrophobic domains, serves as a very inefficient substrate for the recombinant proteinase. Generating migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 43 kDa, faster than its predicted molecular weight of 55 kDa. the HD1.3C.HD2 C3478A precursor protein in the presence of microsomal membranes, however, does not Using the HA-tag the processing product corresponding to the amino-terminal hydrophobic domain was increase its efficiency as a substrate for the recombinant 3CLpro, demonstrating that membranes have no also identified in association with membranes upon expression of this plasmid in vitro. This is the first in effect on trans processing by the recombinant 3CLpro.

We estimated that approximately 37% of the total translated proteins becomes associated with hanced processing of the 3CLpro observed in the presence of membranes upon coupled transcription -trans-membranes (data not shown). This number is variable and seems to be independent of the hydrophobic con-lation of wild-type precursors, containing both substrate and active enzyme, cannot be attributed to an tent of the precursor protein, that is to say, increasing hydrophobic content of the precursor does not corre-increase in trans cleavage, but rather is due to an enhancement of cis processing by the 3CLpro. It is late with a greater partitioning into the membranes. Instead, this calculation may reflect the capacity of the also clear that the microsomes are not required as a cofactor for enzyme activity since the processing of microsomes to take in proteins or the fact that the microsomes may be a limiting reagent in these in vitro the NX.3C C3478A precursor protein takes place efficiently in the absence of microsomes.
