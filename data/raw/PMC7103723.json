{"title": "Epidemiology, etiology, x-ray features, importance of co-infections and clinical features of viral pneumonia in developing countries", "body": "A major challenge of reviewing published literature on acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children is the lack of a gold standard, universally accepted case definition for pneumonia [14]. The lack of a gold standard definition has hampered a homogenous approach to pneumonia research for decades. Therefore, we decided to use a non-restrictive approach during this systematic literature search to incorporate the wide variety of utilized case definitions for pneumonia (Table 1).\n\nWe defined \u2018developing country\u2019 using the World Bank and International Monetary Found (IMF) classifications and included studies performed in countries in the newly industrialized category as of 2011, including Brazil, People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey (IMF 2011).\n\nWe undertook a systematic literature review using various search terms in Medline and Embase (Appendix 1) as well as hand-searched online journals so as to include the different age ranges, inclusion criteria (ARI, ALRI, severe ALRI, very severe ALRI, influenza-like illness, radiologically confirmed pneumonia and WHO-defined pneumonia), the different detection techniques utilized for viral detection (PCR, immunofluorescent antibody test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, shell-vial and viral culture); the different number of virus studied (from single virus detection studies to multiple-viral detection studies) and finally the different samples studied (nasopharyngeal aspirates [NPA], nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchial aspirates and lung punctures).\n\nA total of 21 studies from South America [16\u201318], Asia [19\u201327] and Africa [25,28\u201335] presented incidence data on ALRI and virus-specific associated ALRI, 4 of which presented incidences in adults [19,22,24,30]. Incidence rates are summarized in Tables 2\u20135. In the pediatric populations from African settings, the incidence of ALRI ranged from 90 to 1029 cases per 1000 children-year-at-risk (CYAR) for all ALRI, and from 13.2 to 560 cases per 1000 CYAR for severe ALRI. In Asian settings, the incidence of ALRI and severe ALRI ranged from 21.7 to 730 and from 16 to 210 cases per 1000 CYAR, respectively. In South America, only incidences of all ALRI cases (and not for severe cases) were available, ranging from 64 to 1710 cases per 1000 CYAR. Discrepancies between the different settings may in part be explained by differences in age groups, year of study and definitions hampering accurate epidemiological comparisons among regions. Children under 1 year of age have the highest incidence of ALRI and severe ALRI. This declines with age and is lowest between 15 and 65 years, increasing again in the elderly although never attaining the figures observed in the under one populations. This trend was observed in influenza and HRV-related ALRI [19,22], but not in RSV-related ALRI [24]. Few studies presented incidence rates for viruses other than RSV and influenza [22,23,33].\n\nBefore 2000, few studies recruited for more than 12 consecutive months and hence seasonality could not always be inferred [36]. Since then, there have been several reports on site-specific virus seasonality, especially for RSV, influenza virus and hMPV (Table 6). RSV and hMPV in particular seem to be more frequently detected during the rainy season in America, Africa and Asia, with the exception of Nigeria and South Africa where RSV showed higher incidence during the dry season [25] and Kenya where several peaks of epidemics occurred without following any clear seasonal pattern. HRV and adenovirus (ADV) were detected throughout the year. Influenza viruses showed different seasonal patterns (throughout the year in Vietnam in 2004\u20132008, or restricted to the cool season in 2007\u20132008; cool season in Chile, and during the rainy season in India, Mozambique and Kenya). Limited data are available for parainfluenza virus (PIV), hCoV and hBoV. Interestingly, seasonality of RSV, hMPV and PIV in Chile differed from that of the other countries, most likely due to its temperate instead of tropical climate with two distinctive seasons.\n\nIn the majority of pediatric studies, the detection of at least one virus among ALRI cases was a common finding. In studies where culture or antigen detection were the only diagnostic methods used, 19\u201335% of the samples were positive for at least one virus [4,7]. However, when PCR methods were utilized, detection rates increased to 35\u201385% in all ALRI cases and to 47\u201360% in severe ALRI [45,48\u201350]. Overall among the 21 studies reviewed, RSV was the most frequently detected virus, especially in children under the age of 2, with detection rates of 15\u201364 and 15\u201334% in all ALRI and severe ALRI, respectively (Table 7)\n[51,52]. Interestingly, 30% of lung samples from 98 fatal pneumonia episodes in children under the age of 2 from Mexico were positive for RSV [53]. HRV was the second more frequently reported virus, although in some studies it ranked first, especially in children over the age of 2 [52]. In all ALRI and in severe ALRI, HRV was detected in 21\u201340 and 20\u201341%, respectively. In studies that further typed HRV, HRV-A was the most frequently identified species in both severe and non-severe ALRI while HRV-B was rarely detected [47,54\u201359]. HRV species distribution was consistent among African, Asian and American settings, although recent reports from non-developing settings, namely Australia, have highlighted the pathogenic role of the newly described HRV-C and its potential impact as a cause of pediatric severe respiratory disease and hospital admissions [60]. ADV, influenza and PIV were recorded in 4\u201337, 3\u201316 and 5\u201323% of ALRI cases, respectively. However, ADV was consistently more frequently identified than RSV in samples from Mozambique in three large studies [33,48,61], two of which were in severe ALRI cases in children under the age of 5. This trend was not confirmed by other studies with the exception of a Malawian study where 16% of the lung puncture samples in radiologically confirmed pneumonia were positive to ADV. In those populations, there is a high burden of HIV and the importance of this condition needs to be further investigated. Of the newly described respiratory viruses, hMPV was recorded in 3\u201327.2% of ALRI cases, hCoV in 0\u20139% and hBoV in 0.7\u20135%. Finally, only two studies reported polyomavirus infection in 3.6 and 25% of ALRI in children under 13 years of age in Philippines, and in children younger than 12 years of age in Thailand, respectively [57,59]. When considering only the most comprehensive studies (detection by PCR of at least 10 viruses in study populations larger than 500 patients over a minimum 12-month period), the general prevalence of viral infections ranged from 47 to 69%, with HRV, RSV, influenza, ADV and hMPV being the most commonly detected pathogens [29,33,42,44,45,48,59,62].\n\nViral etiology can only be inferred if proper case\u2013control studies including healthy and/or asymptomatic children are conducted to compare the prevalence of viral pathogens between both groups and to calculate the attributable fraction. Such a study design, currently being utilized by the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study [63], could help clarify the role of some respiratory viruses such as HRV in viral pneumonia. Eleven studies conducted in countries including the Gambia, Kenya, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam included control groups to compare virus prevalence in patients with either pneumonia, severe pneumonia or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. The only virus indisputably associated with pneumonia was RSV, which was significantly more prevalent in all three pneumonia case definitions and for different age groups. Influenza was related to hospitalized pneumonia in children under the age of 3 [27], but not in children younger than 12 years of age with severe pneumonia. Two studies conducted in Kenya with 810 and 2973 patients with severe pneumonia under the age of 5, respectively, demonstrated variable results with a significant association between influenza and severe pneumonia in the larger study [29,45]. HRV, hMPV and PIV were mostly unrelated to pneumonia in different case\u2013control studies, although a significant association was found between HRV and pneumonia in the 1\u20134 age group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.0\u20135.2) with the exception of one study of infants from Thailand [22]. In this study, HRV genotypes were typed and significance was only attained for species A and C, but not B. Interestingly, hMPV was only related to pneumonia in children older than 5 years of age, but not in those younger than 5 or in those younger than 12 [28]. Only PIV-3 was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (OR: 13; 95% CI: 6.0\u201328.0) in children under the age of 3 [46]. ADV, hCoV and hBoV were not related to pneumonia in any of the case\u2013control studies that included their detection [27\u201329,41,43,45].\n\nPneumonia is a major cause of death and hospital admissions in HIV-infected children [64]. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the pediatric HIV epidemic is essentially circumscribed, studies describe singularities in HIV-associated pneumonia. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a viral pathogen responsible for mononucleosis-like or influenza-like illnesses in immunocompetent children, is a leading cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected children. In a study of children with severe ALRI from South Africa, CMV was identified in 36% of HIV-infected children (and in 15% of uninfected children, most of whom were severely malnourished). Furthermore, CMV was more common than Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (27%) and other viral-associated pneumonia (19%) [65]. In another study, hMPV was indentified as the only infection in 3.7% of HIV-infected and 9.1% of HIV-uninfected children [66]. Other respiratory viruses are also commonly identified among HIV-infected patients with severe ALRI, although less frequently than among HIV-uninfected children. One likely explanation for this is the role of other pathogens in severe pneumonia in such immunocompromised patients. In a large study of children younger than 2 years of age admitted for severe pneumonia, viruses and bacteria were identified in 15.7 and 12.5% of HIV-infected patients compared with 34.8 and 5.8% of HIV-uninfected cases, respectively [67]. P. jirovecii was only detected among HIV-infected children. In this study, CMV and hMPV were not tested for, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the relevance of viral pathogens causing ALRI in HIV-infected patients. In such children, polymicrobial infections were more common than in HIV-uninfected patients and also appeared to be associated with a worse prognosis [68]. Clinical features were similar in hMPV-associated ALRI [66], but not in PIV and influenza-associated ALRI where wheezing was less frequent and alveolar consolidation was more frequent in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected children [69,70]. Fatal outcome was recorded in 0\u201335% of HIV-infected and in 0\u201311% of HIV-uninfected children with viral pneumonia, with CMV causing worse prognosis than any other virus (Table 8)\n[65,67,69,70]. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) is a lymphoproliferative response to HIV and/or Epstein\u2013Barr virus common in HIV-infected children older than 2 years of age without proper antiretroviral treatment [71\u201373]. Although LIP is a chronic lung disease, it may present intermittent episodes of ALRI with fever and tachypnea mostly due to bacterial super-infections [74]. Digital cubbling, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly are common in children with LIP, and the characteristic radiological findings include persistent, diffuse bilateral reticulonodular pattern [74,75].\n\nWe identified 13 studies that included adults, 4 of which reported detection rates for both adults and children (Table 9). Viral detection rates were 20\u201339% [76\u201379] in adult ALRI with the exception of a study in Laos of 34 patients hospitalized with ALRI where 67% of samples were positive to at least one virus [80]. This value must be considered with caution because of the small size of the study. HRV was the most frequently reported virus (6\u201311.5%) and was detected in all studies where it was tested for. Influenza was detected in 3.1\u201313% of ALRI adult cases and was usually the second most commonly identified virus after HRV, with the exception of a study conducted in Vietnam during the H1N1 pandemic where influenza was the most frequently detected virus [81]. RSV was documented in 0\u201313% of cases, hMPV in 0\u201311.5%, ADV in 0.7\u20133% and hBoV in 0.7% of adult ALRI cases [43]. Two studies reported data stratified according to age groups for influenza-related ALRI and HRV-related ALRI, showing a decrease of viral detection with age [22,30].\n\nSince the advent of multiplex-PCR allowing the simultaneous detection of up to 18 respiratory viruses, multiple viruses in the same specimen have been increasingly identified in pneumonia etiological studies. Multiple viral infections were reported in 5.8\u20138% of adults and 11\u201356% of children [80,82\u201386]. Both the lowest and the highest co-infection rates in children were reported from studies using an 18-virus multiplex PCR in similar age groups (<5 years vs <3 years of age), so disparity may be due to epidemiological differences in the various settings. The most frequently detected combination usually included the most prevalent viruses identified in the study (RSV-hMPV, RSV-HRV, RSV-influenza and HRV-ADV). hBoV is frequently detected in association with other respiratory viruses (70\u201389%), followed by polyomavirus (73%), ADV, hCoV and PIV (60% each) and HRV, hMPV and RSV (50% each) [29,50,87]. The clinical relevance of those associations remains unclear and some studies did not find differences in severity due to viral co-detection compared with single virus identification [50,79,88]. However, two studies in Mozambique reported multiple viral infections in 11\u201320% of cases of severe pneumonia and found significant associations with nasal flaring (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1\u20136.5), lower chest indrawing (OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.4\u20139.9) and fatal outcome (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.0\u20134.7) [33,61]. Other studies have reported increased risk of developing ALRI in children with RSV-HRV, RSV-hMPV and RSV-PIV-3 co-infections but not with RSV-influenza co-infection [27], and longer hospitalization length and oxygen requirements in RSV-HRV co-infected toddlers [49]. In a large study of children and adults with radiologically confirmed pneumonia in Thailand, single hBoV infection was not associated with ALRI hospitalization. However, hBoV co-detection with RSV, HRV and PIV was associated with wheezing and signs of respiratory distress more frequently than RSV, HRV and PIV single infections [43].\n\nThe WHO-proposed case definition for pneumonia, part of the integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI) strategy that has saved the lives of millions of children in the developing world [89], is a highly sensitive albeit poorly specific case definition aimed to maximize the detection of potentially life-threatening ALRI episodes and prompt the rapid initiation of life-saving antibiotic therapy. Respiratory and non-respiratory illnesses might both fulfill this all-embracing definition, but not all patients with this clinical presentation may benefit from antibiotic therapy, particularly if the cause of their ALRI is exclusively a viral infection. Furthermore, in malaria-endemic countries, severe malaria might also present with respiratory distress or tachypnea [48]. For these reasons, given the scarcity of antibiotics (particularly wide-spectrum ones such as third-generation cephalosporins) in many developing settings, together with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance to those commonly available [90], it is important to identify features that could reliably distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia, which could clearly have relevant management and public health implications for clinicians and policy makers in developing countries.\n\nIn developed countries, the diagnosis of pneumonia relies on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, radiological results and laboratory tests [91,92]. In developing countries, hospitals outside urban areas rarely have x-ray facilities or access to laboratory tests such as procalcitonin (PCT) or C-reactive protein (CRP) and diagnostic biomarkers are usually limited to clinical research. Thus, in such contexts, diagnosis is often purely clinical, although standardized x-ray-based case definitions have been proposed by WHO for their use in epidemiological studies or clinical trials [93]. A study in Sweden with 346 pediatric cases with confirmed pneumonia who underwent extensive microbiological tests concluded that x-ray features had no relation to etiology [94]. Authors described hyperinflation and interstitial infiltrates more frequently in viral pneumonia and more alveolar infiltrates in bacterial pneumonia, but those descriptions were not specific. However, they found a relation with age and concluded that age might be a confounder in x-ray interpretation. A study carried out in China describing the x-ray features of 210 pediatric cases less than 15 years of age with viral pneumonia reported that 63% of patients had patchy areas of consolidation, 15% had interstitial infiltrates and 7% had lobar consolidation [95]. Bilateral affectation of lower lobes was frequent. The authors found that ADV-related pneumonia was associated with interstitial infiltrates and seasonal influenza A (H1N1) with diffuse areas of air space consolidation. They found no specific features related to influenza B or PIV pneumonia. However, respiratory viruses commonly causing viral pneumonia were not tested for. Another study in Thailand of 1067 children under the age of 2 years described a significant relationship between RSV-associated pneumonia and interstitial infiltrates [26]. Interestingly, 30% of the pneumonia cases showing lobar consolidations were positive for RSV. In a similar study from Brazil, 54% of RSV-positive patients and 51% of RSV-negative patients had identical interstitial infiltrates and no relation could be established between clinical features and etiology [96]. Most of the studies carried out in a large variety of settings have reported similar results; the most frequent pattern of viral pneumonia (with RSV being the most studied virus) includes interstitial or peribronchial infiltrates, but alveolar or lobar consolidation is not a rare finding (7\u201330% of viral pneumonias), and mixed patterns are frequent both in viral and bacterial-confirmed pneumonia episodes [21,97\u2013100]. Thus, it is fair to conclude that etiologic diagnosis (specific respiratory virus or virus vs bacteria) cannot and should not be made on the basis of x-ray features alone in pediatric pneumonia [101,102].\n\nIn adults, radiologic findings in viral pneumonia are variable and highly overlapping [103]. Moreover, the corroboration of a lobar consolidations and/or pleural effusion is not rare in adult viral pneumonia [79,81]. In a series of Kenyan adult patients with viral pneumonia, lobar and multilobar consolidation patterns were seen in 15 patients while patchy consolidation was seen only in one [78]. Although the study was small, it is noteworthy that lung aspirates were performed to rule out bacterial disease. However, 11 patients were HIV-infected and the radiological pattern could have been altered by this condition.\n\nMost clinicians in developing countries rely on their clinical evaluation for an initial orientation of the probable etiology of their patients, despite the poor specificity of clinical symptoms for that purpose. A study carried out at Turku University Hospital (Finland) of 4277 children with laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections compared clinical features of eight different respiratory viruses (HRV, RSV, ADV, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, influenza virus A and influenza virus B), and found that overlapping symptomatology was frequent [13]. Overlapping clinical presentation is also common in developing countries, and more importantly, viral pneumonia signs and symptoms seem to overlap with those of bacterial pneumonia. In a study of 226 children less than 5 years of age with ALRI from Thailand, the authors were unable to identify clinical signs to differentiate viral from bacterial etiology [100]. This was also observed in a study of 214 children under 14 years of age in Sudan [104]. Other studies have compared virus-positive pneumonia versus virus-negative pneumonia and failed to identify significant differences. Low sensitivity of bacterial diagnosis, mostly based on blood cultures, may underestimate viral-bacterial co-infections in the virus-positive group leading to conflicting results [44,105]. However, wheezing has shown significant association with viral pneumonia in some studies, and was present in 17\u201364% of children and 32% of adults [79,106]. RSV-related ALRI usually presents with crackles, wheezing, nasal flaring, lower chest indrawing, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction more frequently than other viruses [96,107\u2013109]. Unfortunately, none of those clinical features are clearly specific of RSV infection and wheezing has also been associated with HRV (particularly to HRV-C), hMPV and hBoV [43,58,60,61,110]. Reactive airway disease as a sequel of previous viral infections leading to repeated wheezing episodes and readmissions has been described in RSV infections, but also after influenza-related ALRI [20,105]. In most studies, RSV has been characterized as having more severe presentation in terms of oxygen requirements, hypoxemia and signs of respiratory distress [50,58,108], but other studies found HRV infections to be more severe in both children and adults [49,79], and finally some studies concluded severity was not associated with any virus [44,111,112]. Case fatality rates have been reported for RSV-associated ALRI (1.9\u20137.5% in children from different settings), severe influenza-associated ALRI (4% in <12 years in rural Kenya), influenza-associated ALRI (0.3\u20130.4% in children and adults series in Kenya) and hMPV-associated ALRI (5.9% in Indonesia) among the most pathogenic respiratory viruses [35,59,106\u2013108]. In addition, avian influenza A (H5N1) may be associated with a case fatality rate as high as 33% with early antiviral treatment or 80\u201393% without treatment [113\u2013116].\n\nIn developed countries, serum biomarkers such as PCT and CRP are used for distinguishing viral from bacterial infections, especially in children. Serum PCT and CRP levels increase in bacterial infections above a cutoff of 1\u20135 ng/ml and 15\u2013100 mg/l, respectively [117]. Other commonly studied biomarkers, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b3, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein or heparin-binding protein have not shown higher sensitivity, specificity or predictive value than PCT or CRP for that purpose [118\u2013120]. In a meta-analysis comparing PCT and CRP for differentiating bacterial from viral infections, PCT was more sensitive and specific and had a higher false discovery rate (Q value) than CRP [117]. In developing countries, affordable, rapid and simple diagnostic tools for that purpose are crucial to assure adequate management of antibiotics, especially in view of the low specificity of clinical features. PCT and CRP have proved to be useful markers for bacterial diagnosis in African settings [121\u2013124]. However, serum levels of PCT and CRP increase in patients with malaria infection and hence may compromise their utility in malaria-endemic settings [125\u2013127]. Further research in this area should be undertaken with the aim of developing a rapid diagnostic test, ideally a point-of-care test that is capable of identifying the underlying etiology of infection in severely ill patients at admission.\n\nAntivirals are rarely used in developing countries, except for avian influenza A (H5N1) cases where oseltaminvir, amantadine, rimantadine and rivabirin have been tested with good results if initiated promptly [116]. Lack of rapid etiologic diagnosis renders this option unsuitable for clinicians from resource-constrained areas. Following WHO recommendations [128], antibiotics are initiated in patients fulfilling the WHO clinical pneumonia case definition.\n\nPassive immunization through the use of specific monoclonal antibodies has been used in developed countries for the management of RSV infections, particularly among highly selected high-risk populations such as extreme preterms and congenital heart defect patients during epidemics. Its prohibitive price, however, makes it an unrealistic option in developing countries. Thus, prevention and control of viral respiratory diseases should primarily be focused on vaccines. Unfortunately, there are no registered vaccines against respiratory viruses suitable for use in children younger than 6 months of age, which is the population at highest risk [31,129]. For older children and adults, the only available vaccine in the market is that against seasonal influenza, although this vaccine has not been included in the expanded program of immunization for children. Immunization of pregnant women relying on the protectiveness of mother-to-child transferred antibodies, and immunization of post-partum mothers and household contacts have been studied as a strategy to reduce influenza virus burden in young children with promising results [130\u2013132]. A polyvalent vaccine against RSV and PIV-3 (MEDI-534) is being evaluated in Phase I trials with good safety profile [133]. Vaccines against hMPV and HRV are still in pre-clinical stages and their widespread availability cannot be expected in the short-term [134,135].\n\nIn developing countries, similar to what occurs in more developed settings, respiratory viruses are an important cause of pneumonia, particularly among young children. However, their real burden is presumably heavily underestimated. The pathogenic role of specific viruses (or viral subtypes) detected in the upper respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia still requires further clarification. Thus, well-designed case\u2013control studies providing robust data and pathogen-specific attributable disease fractions are required, in addition to new diagnostic methods or biomarkers clearly differentiating pathogens which colonize from pathogens which cause disease. Homogenization in clinical and radiological definitions, inclusion criteria and laboratory tests are also necessary to allow comparisons among studies and clearly detect priorities for public health policy makers. Only then, the real and underexposed burden of viral pneumonia in resource-constrained settings will emerge in its true magnitude and significance."}
