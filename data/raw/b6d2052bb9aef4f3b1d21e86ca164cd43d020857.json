{"title": "Transmission of human-associated microbiota along family and social networks 1 2 Authors: 3", "body": "Host-specificity rather than generalist life histories dominate in the colonization of the gut 3 . Thus, 36 colonization likely depends on direct interpersonal interactions where individuals are exposed to other 37 humans' microbiota. Nevertheless, the extent to which regular, repeated bacterial exposures result in 38 transmission is unknown. Mother-to-child transmission can be detected early in life 4, 5, 6 , but these patterns 39 fade, whereas other factors-environment 7 , behaviors and genetics 8 impact the strain-level composition of 40 each adult's microbiome 9, 10 . The human microbiome remains remarkably stable in composition over 41 days 11 and even years, at the level of strains 10, 12 , raising the question: do we exchange oral and gut 42 commensals with our closest family and friends? 43\n\nHere, we take advantage of rich familial and social network data obtained as part of the Fiji 44\n\nCommunity Microbiome Project (FijiCOMP) (Figure 1a , Supplementary Tables 1-2) to explore the role 45 of transmission in human populations with strain-level resolution. Our data consists of shotgun 46 metagenomic sequences from 287 people living in 5 agrarian villages in the Fiji Islands (Supplementary 47 Table 3 , Supplementary Table 4 ). Paired gut and oral microbiome samples were deeply sequenced to 48 enable molecular epidemiological analyses. The presence of locally endemic bacterial disease suggests 49 that commensal bacteria may also spread widely within the community. Due to the relative isolation of 50 these villages and the reliance on local food and water, we hypothesized that with comprehensive 51\n\nsampling of eligible individuals in each village, we could capture all human sources and sinks of human-52 associated bacteria, enabling the tracking of strains within this comparatively 'closed' network. 53\n\nThe bacteria present in the FijiCOMP microbiomes are largely distinct from those in existing 54 databases 13 resulting in poor read alignments to reference genomes (Supplementary Figure 1) . Therefore, 55\n\nwe binned reads derived from oral or gut microbiomes using Latent Strain Analysis 14 , and de novo 56 assembled a set of draft genomes (Supplementary Table 5 ). There were little to no detectable differences 57 in species-level sharing than expected by chance across any relationship type in either the gut or oral 58 microbiome samples (Figure 1b ,c, Supplementary Figure 2) , a finding at odds with that of households in 59\n\nKenya 15 , Israelis 16 or metropolitan Americans 9 , yet one that may reflect the high contact rates between 60 individuals in this cohort. 61\n\nTo achieve strain-level resolution within individuals' microbiomes, we employed two orthogonal 62 approaches, focusing on either polymorphisms in core proteins or the presence/absence of flexible 63 genomic regions. The former involved aligning sequencing reads to sets of core genes from each of the 64 assemblies (Supplementary Table 5 ), similar to several established methods 6, 7, 17 , adjusted for use within 65 the context of a social network. Specifically, we calculated the Manhattan distances between pairs of 66 individual's putative genotypes, inferred by the dominant SNP at each polymorphic position in the 67 alignment. For individuals in the same village, household members or non-nuclear connections, we 68 compared the distances for each genome of all connected pairs and a balanced random subset of 69 unconnected pairs; whereas we simply shuffled the associations of spouses and mother-child pairs. We 70 performed 100 bootstraps of the unconnected pairs or shuffles, each time tallying the number of genomes 71\n\nfor which the median Manhattan distance was lower in connected individuals versus unconnected ( Figure  72 1b,c). We next implemented an alternate strategy, largely based on the previous observation that flexible 73 genomic regions may be highly personalized 18 . Coverage of one kilobase windows of contigs over 10kb 74\n\nwere compared across pairs of individuals. Shared genotypes were defined by the complete lack of 75 outlying 1kb regions present in one individual and absent in the other (Supplementary Figure 3) . We 76 tallied the number of assembled genomes more frequently shared in each relationship type in over 100 77\n\nshuffles or bootstraps, again controlling for class imbalances, resulting in the distributions in Figure 1 . 78 Transmission, loosely defined by shared inferred genotypes, has been observed for strains within 79 the gut microbiomes of mother-child pairs 19 , albeit most notably in the first year of life 4, 5, 6 , in cases where 80 fecal material was used for transplantation 17, 20 , and between twin-pairs 10 . Within the village setting, we 81 are unable to determine whether strain transfer is direct or indirect, or from a common source, nor can we 82 infer its directionality. However, we refer to the presence of shared genotypes as 'transmission' as the 83 putative explanation for the observed patterns. Here, consistent patterns of transmission were revealed 84 across individuals' social networks in both gut and oral microbiomes, independent of the metric used 85 (Figure 1b ,c, distributions of p-values in Supplementary Figure 4) . Household members showed high 86 levels of strain similarities in their gut microbiomes, across mother-child pairs and, most notably, among 87 spouses, who share no genetic relatedness. The length of cohabitation was positively correlated, albeit 88 weakly, with the measure of strain dissimilarities (Supplementary Figure 5) , which may reflect long-term 89 changes in intimacy or lifestyle. 90\n\nThe signal varies across our two metrics, potentially highlighting interactions in which organisms 91\n\nversus mobile genetic elements are transmitted between individuals. Using a set of gut microbiome 92 mobile genes previously identified in the FijiCOMP cohort 13 , we find mobile genes weakly shared 93 between spouses (Supplementary Figure 6) . Using strain-level metrics, the transmission signals are 94\n\nrobust. Transmission within villages in both gut and oral microbiomes was detectable in core gene SNPs 95 even when we rarefied the number of village pairs from over one-thousand down to 10 pairs each of 96 connected and unconnected individuals (Supplementary Figure 7) . Furthermore, our results were 97 consistent even when we reduced the number of genomes considered using only those LSA-informed 98 assemblies with low putative contamination (Supplementary Figure 8) . In all cases, shuffling network 99 relations, while retaining network architecture, ablated observable transmission patterns (Supplementary 100 Figure 9 ). 101\n\nWe next examined the contributions of specific organisms, as familial transmission has been 102 previously observed for certain gut and oral commensals 8, 21, 22, 23 . There was no consistent signal of 103 transmission across any single phyla (Supplementary Figure 10) . Instead, each pair of connected 104\n\nindividuals had a unique signature of shared organisms (Figure 2a ,b, Supplementary Figures 11-18 ) , 105\n\nsuggesting that transmission may be largely driven by chance events and indirect transfer. Interestingly, 106\n\nthe fidelity of our LSA-informed assemblies did not strongly impact our results, as transmission may still 107 be observed even if core genes are shuffled between assemblies (Supplementary Figure 19) , microbiome history. Third, despite our achieved sequencing depth, perhaps longer-read sequencing or a 124 massive increase in sequencing depth is required to achieve greater strain resolution. We reached the limit 125\n\nof detecting transmission when we rarefied samples to 5 million reads (Supplementary Figure 21) . 126\n\nFinally, this community may actually be more prone to transmission with a wide range of community 127 members, even when compared to other non-industrialized populations. This is best illustrated by regular 128\n\ngatherings to drink kava, where a communal vessel and cup are shared. 129\n\nBorrowing from the framework of disease ecology, we sought to test the impact of specific 130\n\nindividuals within the social network on overall network-level transmission. 'Superspreading' is a 131 phenomenon observed for the transmission of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 132\n\nand human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), where the majority of the transmission observed is 133\n\nattributable to a relatively small number of people 24 . Across our cohort, there were detectable differences 134\n\nin transmission per individual of both stool and saliva (Figure 3a -c,e, Supplementary Figure 22 ). Since we 135 cannot determine the direction of transmission, we refer to this phenomenon as 'supersharing' in this 136\n\ncohort. Supersharing was largely agnostic to the individuals' read depth, once a threshold is achieved for 137 obtaining accuracy in Manhattan distances (Supplementary Figure 23) . Interestingly, individuals who 138\n\nwere strong supersharers of gut microbiota were not the same as those of oral microbiota (Figure 3g ), 139\n\nrevealing differences between the transmission routes of commensals. There was also no specific 140 association with individuals' overall sharing and their network positions, either in terms of the number of 141 connections ('degree') or the centrality (measured by 'betweenness') (Supplementary Figure 24) . 142\n\nSurprisingly, sharing of both gut and oral microbiota was more associated with females in the 143 network (p<0.005 for gut microbiomes, p<0.05 for oral microbiomes, Pearson correlation, Figure 3d We next asked whether strain-level information alone could be used to predict specific social 155 relationships. We implemented a machine learning approach that utilized organism abundances, core SNP 156 profiles, flexible region similarity or combinations thereof, without considering demographics. Our on the network structure, as all of the relationships within some households were accurately predicted, in 162 both gut and oral samples. Remarkably, our model reveals that close to 25% of spouses are exceedingly 163 easy to predict with high confidence (Figure 4c ,d). Within the household network, some of these spousal 164 pairs were obscured, highlighting the subtle nature of these transmission signals. Why certain couples are 165 easier to predict than others is unknown, but may reflect shared susceptibilities, specific behaviors, or the 166 relative importance of extra-marital relationships. Interestingly, spouses have been found to share immune 167 repertoires 26 and households display family-specific signatures 27 As part of the survey, each head of household was asked to draw their family trees, including all members 194\n\nof their household, even if they are not related. Individuals were specifically asked to name their spouse, 195\n\nif married, and the number and ages of their children. We inferred the number of years a married couple 196 lived together by the age of their oldest child. We excluded six of the 63 couples from our analysis of the 197 time they lived together because either they did not have any children or their children's ages were 198\n\ninconsistent (for example, if children came from a previous marriage). As houses commonly have names 199\n\nrather than specific addresses in these villages, individuals were asked the name of the house in which 200 they live. Individuals' responses were cross-referenced for consistency and ambiguous links were 201 removed from our analysis. Minor discrepancies, such as slight differences between spouses in the 202\n\nreporting of their children's ages that differed by 1 year, were permitted. Individuals were further asked to 203 provide the names of 5 individuals with whom they spent the most amount of time. Although the 204 individuals mentioned the type of relationship (e.g. mother/child, cousin, sister-in-law, friend, classmate, 205 churchmate etc.), these relationship types were not solely relied upon to define a particular relationship 206\n\ntype. In a small number of examples, individuals cited social interaction with a third party whose identity 207\n\ncould not be verified, and were therefore not included in our analysis. Additionally, some individuals 208 mentioned siblings or parent/child relationships that could not be verified, so these were also counted as family were surveyed, either because the children did not meet the inclusion criteria (they needed to be at 213 least 8 years of age) or because they were inaccessible during the time when we were sampling. Social 214\n\nnetwork was plotted using R package igraph (v.1.0.1). Network metrics (i.e. betweenness, degree) were 215 calculated using igraph standard functions.\n\nAdditional information was obtained from all participants including having individuals name their 218 occupation (of which domestic duties, farmer, and fisherman were all possible answers), whether the 219 individual had cared for a sick family member in the past year, and whether they used soap (with possible 220 answers: always, sometimes and never).\n\nAlignments and identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms 223\n\nWe calculated the Manhattan distances between the dominant SNPs within pairs of individuals' core gene 224\n\nalignments. This involved aligning each individuals' reads to core genes in the assembled LSA partitions, 225 extracting polymorphic loci, and determining the dominant allele at each locus. For each pair of 226 individuals, we computed the Manhattan distance at each locus, averaged this distance across loci, and 227 computed this quantity for every partition/genome. These distances were then used for the network 228\n\ncomparisons described in the 'Network comparisons' section. 229\n\nMore precisely, quality-filtered, dereplicated metagenomic datasets (on average, over 52 million and 10 230 million reads for our gut and oral microbiomes, respectively), devoid of human genetic material (filtered 231 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/540252 doi: bioRxiv preprint as described in Brito et al., 2016 13 ), were partitioned prior to assembly using Latent Strain Analysis 14 232\n\naccording to covarying kmer content across samples. Read partitions were then assembled using Velvet 31 . 233\n\nSets of core genes were identified using AMPHORA2 32 . Core genes were assigned taxonomies using 234 genera-level best hits using BLAST+ against the NCBI NR database. Partitions with complete (31 single-235 copy genes for bacteria) or near-complete gene sets of AMPHORA genes deriving from the same genera 236\n\nwere retained for analysis (Supplementary Tables). If a core gene set contained more than 2 of the same 237 assembled gene, we removed both copies of that gene.\n\nEach individuals' samples were then aligned to the sets of core genes using BWA-MEM 33 . Reads were 240\n\nsubjected to more stringent trimming using TRIMMOMATIC 34 (in addition to trailing low quality bp 241\n\n(quality < 4), we also implemented a sliding window, trimming when the quality < 15). Reads were then 242 aligned to regions that included 1 read-length (100bp) downstream and upstream of each core gene to 243 avoid edge effects within the alignments. 100bp from each end of the alignment, regardless of whether the 244 gene was positioned at the end of the contig, was then trimmed from the final pile-up. Reads were filtered 245\n\nto retain those with greater than 40% of the length aligning at 90, 95, 97 or 99 percent identity. A lower 246 cut-off was chosen to capture a wide variety of strains for each alignment. Setting a lower threshold 247\n\nwould be more inclusive of strains more distantly related to the reference, which would only obfuscate a 248\n\nsignal for a given species should it include too distant strains. Previous work 20 estimated the species 249\n\nboundary at approximately 85-90% identity in core genes (analogous to ~97% in the 16S rRNA gene).\n\n90% identity also resulted in the most consistent coverage across core genes, and it was therefore chosen 251 for all subsequent SNP-level calculations. Reads with soft-or hard-clipping were removed. To further 252 validate our gene sets, we filtered out genes with abnormal coverage relative to the rest of the gene set. 253\n\nWe expected the depth of each gene to be uniform across a genome, and sequencing depth to be Poisson 254 distributed at each locus. To avoid including genes within a species' genomes that recruiting abnormal 255 numbers of reads compared to the remainder of the genome (and thus more likely to be recruiting reads 256 from other species), we computed a chi-squared goodness of fit test for each gene between the empirical 257 coverage distribution and the equivalent Poisson distribution of the same mean. Genes with median p-258 value lower than 0.05 across subjects were discarded from any subsequent analysis. Results were mostly 259 bimodal, where most genes fit the equivalent Poisson distribution very well, giving us confidence that 260 reads were being recruited uniformly across the full length of the considered genes. 261\n\nTo calculate genome-wide statistics (Figure 1, left) , we built a table of the median coverage across the 262 SNP tables within the core genes, across different assemblies. Then, for each pair of people, we counted 263 the number of these genomes that they shared, and compared that between related and a balanced set of 264 unlinked pairs. 265\n\nPolymorphic loci were then identified from the alignment, resulting in a counts matrix for each genome 266\n\ncontaining read counts for each allele at each locus in each individual. We retained the dominant allele for 267 each individual (the allele with the highest number of read counts) at each site, then then computed the 268\n\nManhattan distance between each individual's dominant allele at each site, and averaged these distances 269 across each genome to obtain an average Manhattan distance per SNP for each genome in a given pair of 270\n\nindividuals. For each pair of individuals in a given social network (e.g. same household), this average 271 Manhattan distance per SNP was computed for every genome, and the median distance for a given 272 genome compared to the median distance observed in unrelated pairs of individuals. This calculation is 273 described in more detail in the 'Network comparisons' section. 274\n\nAs a comparison, we also ran the quality-filtered forward metagenomic reads through the MetaPhlan2 36 275\n\npipeline. 276\n\nContigs under 10kb were removed from LSA-assembled draft genomes. Reads were aligned to contigs 278 with 95% identity. Reads with hard and soft clipping were removed, as were Supplementary alignments. 279 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/540252 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe only considered pairs where both individuals had a median coverage of 10 or more across the 280 genome. 1kB regions were considered present in an individual and absent in another if its coverage was 281 greater than the median in the first individual; and lower than one thousandth of the median in the other. 282\n\nPairs of individuals were considered to share the same strain if there were no such 1kB regions across the 283 entire genome (i.e. all regions were either present or absent in both individuals) and that it was present 284\n\nwith a median coverage of 10 or more in both individuals. 285\n\nFor Supplementary Figure 6 , we used the abundances of mobile genes identified in Brito et al. 2016 to 287\n\ndetermine whether there was a transmission signal. We calculated the Jensen-Shannon divergence 288 between all pairs and compared the number of pairs within each group with a balanced, subsampled 289\n\ngroup. 290\n\nGenes in the LSA-assembled genomes were first clustered at 90% identity using CD-HIT 37 . 292\n\nRepresentative genes were then annotated using DIAMOND 38 against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 293\n\nand Genomes (KEGG) database (release 73.0). Abundances for each gene were then calculated as the 294 median read depth across genes with over 85% coverage. Abundances were summed for each functional 295 gene family (represented by a single KO number). For each pair, the Jensen Shannon divergence was 296 calculated.\n\nNetwork comparisons 299\n\nNetwork comparisons on the mean pairwise SNP distance were performed by comparing the median 300 value of the mean pairwise distance per SNP in related pairs with those in unrelated pairs for each 301 genome. If a genome's median pairwise distance was lower in related pairs than in unrelated pairs, it was 302 counted as a positive hit for related, and vice versa. The total number of genomes that fell in favor of 303 related and unrelated were then compared. Similar analyses were performed comparing sharing of 1kB 304 windows in assembled genomes. A genome was assigned a positive hit for related if the number of related 305 pairs sharing the same strain of that genome exceeded the number of unrelated pairs sharing the same 306 strain, and vice versa. To avoid artefacts arising from the fact that the number of unrelated pairs often 307\n\nvastly exceeds the number of related pairs, we downsampled each of the sets of unrelated pairs 100 times, 308 resulting in the p-value distributions observed in Supplementary Figure 4 . 309\n\nNetworks considered were spousal relationships (spouses versus non-spouse), household relationships 310 (same versus different household), mother-child relationships (mother-child versus non-mother child), another. In addition, comparisons were also made between randomized networks of related and unrelated 317 pairs, in which the identity of the network's nodes were shuffled but the connections preserved, thus 318\n\npreserving the structure of the network. 319\n\nFor each pair of individuals, we created feature vectors containing the mean pair-wise SNP distance for 321 each genome, the relative abundance of that genome in each individual, the number of shared genomes 322 using 1kB outlier regions, and True/False values for whether a given genome was considered to be the 323 same strain in both individuals using the 1kB outlier regions. These features were then used to train (e,f) ROC curves for a random forest model predicting household membership based on shared (e) gut or (f) oral microbiome strain-level data are plotted for models using SNP profiles, shared flexible regions, both, or both with organismal abundances.
