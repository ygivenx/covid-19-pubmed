{"title": "SEQUENCE AND ANALYSIS OF BECV F15 MATRIX PROTEIN", "body": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses which infect mammals and birds and are responsible for diseases of clinical and economic importar_ce; in Farticular, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders (Sturman a~d H61mes, 1983) . A member of this Coronaviridae family, the bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV) was identified for the first time in the USA by several studies and was recognized as one of the main causes of severe and often fatal enteritis in neonatal calves (Mebus et al., 1973) . A second strain of BECV was isolated in France in the faeces of diarrhoeic calves and adapted to cell culture (Laporte et al., 1980; Gouet et al., 1978) . These two strains are distinguishable using monoclonal antibodies against E2 (Vautherot and Laporte, 1983) .\n\nElectron microscopy analysis established that, like the other members of the family, BECV is a spherical (120 nm diameter), pleomorphic, enveloped viral particle s,arrounded by a characteristic fringe of \"club-shaped\" spikes. BECV is comprised of 4 major structural proteins, a 50-kDa phosphorylated nucleocapsid N, a 180-kDa peplomeric glycoprotein S or E2 (present on the virion as subunits of 105 and 95 kDa), a 125-kDa haemagglutinin (made up of two disulphide-linked subunits of 65 kDa) and a 28-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein M or El (Laporte and Bobulesco, 1981 ; Vautherot et al., 1984;  King and Brian, 1982).\n\nThe viral genome is a positive-sensed single-stranded polyadenylated RNA of approximately 18 to 20 kb which is transcribed in infected cells into a 3'-coterminal \"nested set\" (Siddell et al., 1982) of 8 subgenomic RNA (Cruci6re and Laporte, personal communication) . It appears that generally only the 5-proximal region which is not present in the next smaller RNA of the set is translated (Holmes et al., 1986) . Furthermore, each RNA contains a common 5'-end leader sequence which is derived from the 5'-end of the genomic RNA (Lai et al., 1984) .\n\nIt was established in both the American and European strains that the smallest RNA encodes the N protein; only the second RNA from the American strain has been studied and has been found to encode the M protein.\n\nIn this paper, we report the cloning and sequencing of the gene coding for the M protein of the French isolate F15 in order to compare its sequence with that of American strain of BECV. This would enable us to localize some BECV \n\nof the antigenic differences between the two strains and to increase the knowledge of the protein structure of the virus with a view to production of a more efficient vaccine by genetic engineering or oligopeptide synthesis.\n\nHRT18 cell (human rectal .umour cell line) culture and BECV FI5 production and purification were performed as previously described by Laporte et aL, 1980 and Cruci~re and Laporte, 1988 .\n\nThe viral genome was purified by two different methods.\n\n(1) Proteinase K/phenol extraction, m Purified viral suspension (500 ~i) was processed by the method previously described by Cruci&e and Laporte, 1988) .\n\n(2) Hot acid~phenol extraction. --Purified viral suspension, 500 t.d in distilled water, was added to 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer (10 mM pH 5.2) containing 0.5 % SDS, and to the same volume of pher:ol saturated with this buffer (Haymerle et aL, 1986) . After 3 min of incubation at 55\u00b0C with vigourous shaking, the solution was quickly chilled on ice while still being shaken, then centrifuged for 10 min at 7,000 rpm. The aqueous phase was reextracted by the same method and recentrifuged. The upper aqueous phase was first phenol/chloroform-extracted at room temperature with 30 min of shaking, then chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, w~shed with 70 07/0 cold ethanol and dissolved in distilled water tc a concentration of I i.tg/l, tl.\n\ncDNA synthesis and cloning.\n\nThe synthesis of cDNA complementary to the 5'-end of the BECV F15 genome was carried out in a volume of 50 ~1 \u2022 2 ~tl of BECV RNA (1 I.tg/~l) extracted according to the previously described methods were added to 51zg of oligodT 12-18 primer (7.5 ~g/I.d Pharmacia) and to 5 ~1 of distilled water, then denatured at 65\u00b0C for 5 rain and quickly chilled on ice. The solution was added to 48 ~I of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 42\u00b0C), 10 mM MgCI2,10 mM dithiotreitol, 110 mM KCI, 4 U RNasin (GenofJt), 1 mM of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 10 IJ.Ci 0t-32p-dCTP (800 Ci/mmol in aqueous solution), 15 U reverse transcriptase (BRL). The incubation was performed for 90 min at 42\u00b0C and the reaction stopped by adding 2 ~tl 500 mM EDTA. Reaction products were extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation.\n\nThe RNA-DNA hybrids were treated by RNase T2, polydC-tailed and annealed to dG-tailed PstI-linearized pBR322 plasmid as previously described by Cruci&e and Laporte. The sizes of hybrids were estimated before cloning by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (NaOH 30 mM, EDTA 2 mM) and autoradiography with iptensifying screen for one night at -80\u00b0C.\n\nCompetent RR1 Escherichia coli were transfected with this material using the CaCI 2 method and tetracycline resistance (Maniatis et al., 1982) .\n\nThe tetracycline-resistant ampicillin-susceptible colonies were selected and treated by alkaline lysis (Birnboim and Doly, 1979) . The sizes of inserts were estimated by digestion of 1 l.tg of plasmidic DNA by 2 U PstI enzyme (BRL) as described by Maniatis et al., 1982 and electrophoretic migration on 1 \u00b070 agarose gel in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA). Inserts longer than i kb were mapped by using a set of restriction enzymes having no or a single site on the pBR322 plasmid, with appropriate buffers and by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nOriented cloning.\n\nViral DNA inserts 160, 174, 216 were extracted from pBR322 plasmid and treated by restriction enzymes having sites on the M I 3 polylinker.\n\nThe DNA fragments ranging between 0.3 and l kb were purified by electrophoresis and electroelution into dialysis bags (Hediger, 1986) .\n\nThe MI3 phage DNA was cleaved by the same enzymes and 5'-dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer-Mannheim) treatment.\n\nAmounts of 50 to 100 ng of DNA were ligated with 20 ng of vector by addition of T4 DNA ligase (Amersham, 1984) and TG1 E. coli were transfected by the CaC12 method.\n\nThe pBR322-plasmid-containing viral insert was sonicated and subcloned into SmaI site of the MI3 mpl0 vector (Deininger, 1983) . TGI E. coli were transfected by the Hanahan method (Hanahan, 1985) .\n\nThe TG1 oriented and random clones were selected in IPTG-and XGal-containing medium. White plaques of random clones were then checked by hybridization with insert radioactive probes as described by Maniatis et al. (1982) .\n\nMI 3 dideoxy sequencing was carried out according to the Sanger technique using a universal primer, u-35S-dATP and buffer gradient gels (Sanger et al., 1977; Amersham, 1984) . Sequence data were analysed and assembled with the aid of the Queen and Korn (1984) program of the \"Beckman Microgenie\" program (March 1985 version, Beckman Instruments Inc.) adapted to the \"IBM-PC-XT\" microcomputer. The program developed by Ralph and Smith (1987) (Bisance, CITI2, Paris) was used to analyse and predict amino acid sequence secondary structure.\n\ncDNA cloning.\n\nThe sizes of cDNA obtained using 2 p~g of starting material and oligodT 12-18 as a primer ranged between 0.3 and 6 kb with hot-phenol-purified BECV F15 A\u00a2A To, , , , .., .rv PROTEIN 4i 5 genomic RNA and between 0.3 and 18 kb with phenol/proteinase-K-purified genomic RNA ( fig. 1 ).\n\nWe obtained 178 TetR-Amp s clones containing 0.3-to 2.2-kb inserts. OpJy 24 inserts longer than 1 kb were studied and mapped ( fig. 2 ). Their 5'-end is supposed to code for a part of the M glycoprotein by analogy with other studies of murine and avian coronaviruses. It is known that the M protein is encoded by a gene about 800 nucleotides long which is localized at approximately 1,500 nucleotides from the 3'-end of the viral geneme.\n\nClones having 2 or 3 restriction sites (SphI, PvuII, XbaI) which correspond to the 5'-end of N gene (Cruci~re and Laporte, !988) and a 5'-end longer than 0.8 kb from SphI site were retained for cloning in MI3 phage. \n\nA simplified map of 7 of the 24 clones obtained is given. The inserts used for sequen~ag are in boxes.\n\nAfter random and oriented cloning in Mi3 phage DNA, the nuc!e~tide sequences of the inserted fragments were determined by multiple sequencing of both strands.\n\nAn open reading frame (ORF) of 690 bp was identified after sequence analysis by Microgenie. It stretched from the first ATG (nucleotides 131 to 133) to nucleotide 822 and had a coding capacity of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. According to its length and position, this ORF comprised the gene of M glycoprotein (fig. 3) . The Y-end of the sequence represents the 5'-end of the nucleocapsid gene.\n\nStudy of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence near each end of the ORF of two consensus sequences ATCCAAAC and ATCTAAAC which were assumed to be the start of the mRNA transcripts encoding M and N, respectively. \n\nComputer predictions of the amino acid sequence of BECV M gene, its secondary structure and study of its hydrophilic profile led to a model in which approximately 10 % of the N-terminal part of the molecule (28 residues) is exposed on the outer surface of the virus membrane. At this extremity, a cluster of residues SSVTT provides a potential attachment site for an O-glycosidica!ly linked carbohydrate chain, as proposed by Niemann et al. (1984) for MHV-A59 with the analogous sequence SSTT.\n\nBetween amino acids 29 and 111, the protein was found to span the membrane three times (amino acids 29 to 43, 49 to 79 and 85 to 111) with each spanning region enriched in hydrophobic residues and separated by short hydrophilic sections at the surface of the membrane (fig. 3 ).\n\nThis structure is very similar to the M protein amino acid sequence of IBV as described by Boursnell et al., 1984 , who concluded that the molecule was buried in the viral membrane with only the hydrophilic COOH-terminal and exposed.\n\nFor the M protein of BECV, the amphiphilic C-terminal end (amino acids 112 to 185) could be associated with the inner face of the viral membrane, and the protruding very terminal end (net charge of + 8) could interact with the negatively charged RNA.\n\nA first analysis of its amino acid sequence by \"Microgenie\" predicted a transmembrane structure of three [3 sheets, which was in contrast with Armstrong et al., 1984 and Spaan et al., 1988 , who proposed three transmem-\n\nbrahe 0t ncu,~c~. Another study by n._ ,~ ,_ __~ msancc preferentially predicted a p-sneer structure; nevertheless, an ~-helix structure was also possible.\n\nThus, it appears that a simple arrangement of the amino acids cannot be established in this transmembrane region. This may be related to very strong structural constraints in the membrane lipid bilayer, which could also explain the limited evolution of the M protein.\n\nThe coronavirus is a largely worldwide family which is divided mainly into four antigenic classes. A net antigenic specificity was found among each class species and, moreover, between two strains of a same species. However, the protein level of this specificity has not been elucidated for all coronaviruses: it is assumed to be linked to the spike and, perhaps, the matrix proteins. (Corpet, 1988) of six species of coronavirus. From Armstrong et al., 1984; Binns et al., 1986; Boursnell et al., 1984; Laude et al., 1987; and Pfleiderer et aL, 1986. The main regions of homology are in boxes. Asterisks correspond to areas of exact homolo-.gy, : represent a conservative change. Amino acids 1 to 21 of TGEV have no counterpart m the other species. Intramembrane segments are underlined. Several studies about the M protein, especially that of MHV v,,hich was the first coronavirus matrix protein to be sequenced (Armstrong et al., !984) , showed that all species share a similar structure with different degrees of homology (Kapke et al., 1988) .\n\nTherefore, it appears that the deduced amino acid sequence of BECV FI 5 M protein has a 100 % homology with that of the Mebus strain. Indeed, the two strains were isolated from each side of Atlantic in very different conditions (Gouet et al., 1978; Mebus et al., 1973) . This remarquable phenomenon led us to reconsider the role of the M protein in the viral antigenic specificity.\n\nComparison by \"Dayoff optimal alignment\" (Multalin program, Corpet, 1988) with other species of coronaviruses and between several strains of each species showed that BECV shares an 87 % amino acid homology with two strains of MHV, 43 % and 34 % homology with TGEV and two strains of IBV respectively ( fig. 4 ).\n\nMoreover, a strong homology was noted between the two strains of MHV (JHM and A59) which differ by only 7 residues (Pfleiderer et al., 1986) and the two strains of IBV with 18 amino acid changes (Binns et al., 1986) . All these changes are conservative.\n\nUnlike BECV, MHV and IBV matrix proteins, TGEV was found to possess a cleavable signal peptide at its N-terminal extremity. However, Boursnell et al. (1984) found a 22 in-frame codon between the consensus sequence and the initiation codon of IBV M gene which may be the remnant of an ancestral signal peptide.\n\nThus, the exposed part of the M protein of mammalian coronaviruses would appear to share with that of avian viruses a hypervariability with respect to size.\n\nWhether the observed high degree of variation in the N terminus of the M protein is of biological significance is not known. These variations are readily tolerated and of little consequence with regard to the function of the protein (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988) .\n\nThe hydrophobic part of the molecule contains an eight-amino-acid section (113 to 120, BECV) which is perfectly conserved among the six strains of viruses. The other main regions of homology are shown in figure 4.\n\nThe first potential membrane-spanning region has a high degree of homology between the four species, the second is well conserved within MHV-IBV pairs and the third with BECV-IBV and TGEV-MHV pairs. This may be indicative of a functional differentiation between the three segments (Laude et al., 1987) . Spaan et al. (1988) reported that although the matrix M protein of MHV, IBV and BECV does not possess an N-terminal signal sequence, it needs the signal recognition particle for membrane insertion. So, the first and/or the third amino-terminal membrane-spanning region may function as a signal sequence (Rottier et al., 1985; Boursnell et al., 1984) .\n\nComparison between the degree of homology of the matrix protein of these four coronaviruses and that of the N protein of the same species shows that there is higher conservation of the matrix protein (Cruci6re and Laporte, 1988; Lapps et al., 1987) .\n\nM proteins possess a similar hydrophilicity profile ( fig. 5 ) and similar membrane topology, most of the amino acid changes being conservative.\n\nConservation of the protein sequence in the hydrophobic N-terminal half of the polypeptide suggests a high degree of selective pressure for the maintenance of the structure of the putative transmembrane protein, resulting in limited evolution of this molecule (Boursnell et al., 1984; Lapps et al., 1987) .\n\nBECV, MHV, TGEV and IBV could have a common evolutionary origin, the strains diverging from a common ancestor and the M gene undergoing minimal variation.\n\nSeveral studies of the MHV and BECV F15 S protein (Luytjes et al., 1987; Boireau et al., 1990) showed the first great divergence between these two species with a deletion of 46 residues in the MHV-A59 E2 protein and 41 residues in that of MHV-JHM. This protein has a higher degree of evolution than the matrix protein. Thus, it appears that the antigenic specificity of BECV, and in general of coronaviruses, could be preferentially localized on the S gene; N protein being an internal molecule and having no role in immunity.\n\nNevertheless, if the M protein is not essential for viral antigenic specificity, it seems to possess the necessary information on its transmembrane region, probably an insertion signal as we reported before, to be an ideal candidate for use in determining the site of intracellular budding; and it is postulated that the M glycoprotein is the determinant for the budding process Rottier and Rose, 1987 Le clonage dans le plasmide pB322 et le s6quen~age (selon la m6thode de Sanger et Coulson) de clones r6alis6s h partir d'une collection d'ADNc du coronavirus F15 de l'ent6rite bovine (BECV) nous ont permis d'identifier une s6quence de 1300 bases contenant une s6quence de lecture ouverte de 690 bases qui engendre une prot6ine dont les propri6t6s sont celles de la prot6ine M de la matrice. Cette prot6ine poss~de 230 acides amin6s et son poids mol6culaire est de 26376 daltons; elle est hydrophobe et sa charge nette est de + 8 h pH neutre. L'analyse de la structure secondaire ne permet pas d'6tablir un arrangement .'ransmembranaire simple des acides amin6s. La cornparaison entre les s6quences nucl6otidiques aff6rentes pour les souches BECV F15 et BECV Mebus a montr6 que le seul changement de 2 bases donne une homologie de 100 % pour les s6quences d'acides amin6s. De plus, la structure de la prot6ine M apparait tr6s conserv6e quand on la compare avec les alignements optimaux de Dayoff pour les s6quences d'acides nucl6iques des virus MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGE pr6sentent quelques diff6rences antig6niques nous conduit/l reconsid6rer le r61e de la prot6ine M dans la sp6cificit6 antig6nique virale. Une hypoth6se est qu'elle paralt poss6der rinformation n6cessaire dans sa r6gion transmembranaire pour ~tre la c~.ndidate id6ale dam le processus de bourgeonnement viral.\n\nMOTS-CLI~S: Coronavirus, Prot6ine, Matrice, S6queneage; Souche BECV-F15, Analyse."}
