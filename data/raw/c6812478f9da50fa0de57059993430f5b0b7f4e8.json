{"title": "Chapter 13 Tourism in the twenty-first century: contemporary tourism in an uncertain world Chapter objectives", "body": "The future, by definition, is unknown. Trying to predict what the future will bring has become an important element in tourism management because of the need to try and bring a degree of control and certain to business management processes as well as providing desired returns for destinations. Yet such processes are extremely difficult because of the possibilities of 'wildcard' -high impact, low probability -events occurring that affects the consumption and production of tourism. Since 2000, there has been a large number of wildcard events that have affected tourism patterns and flows at a global scale. These include:\n\n\u2022 Terrorist attacks such as September 11 or the bombings in Bali.\n\n\u2022 Disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), foot and mouth disease in the UK or avian flu outbreaks.\n\n\u2022 Economic events such as a rapid increase in the price of fuel.\n\n\u2022 Political events such as changes in boarding and passport requirements for travellers as a result of increased concerns over security. This also includes sudden changes in terms of what you can take onto aircraft as hand luggage.\n\nTo wildcard events there are also a number of other trends that contribute to an increasingly complex business environment for tourism. These include:\n\n\u2022 Demographic changes in development countries, such as an aging population and increase in the number of single-parent families.\n\n\u2022 Rapid population growth in the developing world.\n\n\u2022 Increased urbanization on a global scale.\n\n\u2022 Global environmental change (GEC), including climate change and changes in water availability.\n\n\u2022 Increasing costs of energy, particularly with respect to the costs of oil.\n\nAll of these trends affect the production and consumption of tourism. Production is affected because the resource base of tourism is changed. Consumption is impacted both directly and indirectly. An example of a direct impact is changing costs to get to destinations as a result of increases in the price of fuel. Such an example also highlights that the accessibility of a destination is not just determined by the relative travel distance between a generating area and the destination in terms of kilometres TOURISM FUTURES or miles but also in terms of cost. Indirect impacts of the above trends on consumption relate to the overall contribution of these trends to the state of the economy as economic downturns tend to correspond with slowdowns in outbound travel.\n\nUltimately, underlying the health of the economy is the health of the environment, therefore issues of GEC are increasingly influencing consideration of trends in tourism ( Figure 13 .1).\n\nTrying to anticipate the future of tourism may be a particularly fraught task, especially as there is a very large body of research that suggests that experts in various areas seldom generate better predictions than non-experts who have received some training, and that the predictions of experts are completely outperformed by those made by simple statistical models (Hall 2005b) . Furthermore, most experts overestimate their ability to perform accurately in comparison with non-experts, meaning that experts are overconfident in their knowledge and forecasting capacities. In his review of the work of futurists, Sherden (1998) concluded that meteorologists were not always correct, but had by far the best accuracy compared to economists, stock-market analysts, population researchers, management prophets and social-trend spotters. All of this does not mean that trying to predict or anticipate the future is not without value. From a business perspective, examining the future enables firms to anticipate new business conditions and develop new strategies. From a destination perspective, reflections on the future enable consideration of how to maintain or improve the qualities of a destination and work towards desired futures. Importantly, such exercises should always highlight that in terms of wildcards and trends there are opportunities as well as challenges.\n\nWhat may be damaging for one destination or firm may be an opportunity for another (G\u00f6ssling and Hall 2006a) . Similarly, wildcard events in one location will any affect so much of the tourism system and other parts of the system will be unaffected or may even benefit from events elsewhere. Furthermore, as humans make their own futures the future is not set in stone.\n\nIn examining the future of tourism there appears to be almost a paradoxical situation between different scenarios of what directions tourism may take over the next 20 years. WTO's (1997) Tourism 2020 Vision forecast that international arrivals are Figure 13 .1 Trends and influences affecting contemporary tourism expected to reach nearly 1.6 billion by the year 2020. Of these worldwide arrivals in 2020, 1.2 billion are forecast to be intraregional and 378 million long-haul travellers. As the growth of international tourism is predicted to increase substantially so to is the amount of air travel with growth in aviation outstripping growth in surface-bound transport. The two major aircraft manufacturers Boeing (2003) and Airbus (2003) predict that air travel will continue to grow rapidly over the next two decades, with average annual growth rates of 5.0-5.2 per cent to 2022/2023.\n\nBy 2022, the number of aircraft is predicted to increase by 90 per cent to about 20 500, while the number of installed seats will more than double to reach 4.5 million (Airbus 2003) . Boeing (2003) also predicts that competition for markets will be strong, as a result of continued economic growth in key markets and continued deregulation of aviation markets leading to more airline entrants, lower fares and improved networks. As a result of growth in the number of aircraft worldwide and demand for travel, the overall distances of flights are predicted to increase, with the average distance flown growing from 1437 kilometres in 2002 to 1516 kilometres in 2022 (Airbus 2003) . In addition, it is estimated that a large share of the current fleet of aircraft (60 per cent) will still be in operation 20 years from now (Boeing 2003) . The estimated scale of international tourism growth, as well as the enthusiasm of the tourism industry for such expansion is well illustrated in the World Tourism Organization's (WTO) 2020 vision:\n\nBy the year 2020, tourists will have conquered every part of the globe as well as engaging in low orbit space tours, and maybe moon tours. The Tourism 2020 Vision study forecasts that the number of international arrivals worldwide will increase to almost 1.6 billion in 2020. This is 2.5 times the volume recorded in the late 1990s \u2026 Although the pace of growth will slow down to a forecast average 4 per cent a year -which signifies a doubling in 18 years, there are no signs at all of an end to the rapid expansion of tourism\u2026 Despite the great volumes of tourism forecast for 2020, it is important to recognise that international tourism still has much potential to exploit \u2026 the proportion of the world's population engaged in international tourism is calculated at just 3.5 per cent (WTO 2001: 9, 10 ).\n\nYet at the same time that there are predictions of massive growth in international tourism as well as positive comments from the UNWTO with respect to tourism's potential to contribute to poverty alleviation, there is simultaneously increased\n\nconcerns over the impacts of political insecurity, cost and availability of energy, and GEC on tourism (G\u00f6ssling 2002) . Indeed, even though the WTO (2003) has described the interaction of tourism and climate change as a 'two-way relationship' one of the implications of the growth of the global aviation fleet is that there will be longer operation times of aircraft and concomitant high fuel use of the older models that will still be in use (G\u00f6ssling and Hall 2006b; Peeters et al. 2007 ).\n\nTherefore, it seems almost inevitable that if global tourism can grow at the forecast rate then it will only do so at great cost to the environment. These issues are a concern because with respect to climate change alone global warming is destined to have a far more destructive and earlier impact than previously estimated. The\n\nFourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, indicates that (McKie 2007):\n\n\u2022 The frequency of hurricanes and storms will increase dramatically.\n\n\u2022 Sea levels will rise over the century by around half a metre.\n\n\u2022 Snow will disappear from all but the highest mountains.\n\n\u2022 Deserts will spread.\n\n\u2022 Oceans will become acidic, leading to the destruction of coral reefs and atolls.\n\n\u2022 Deadly heat waves will become more prevalent.\n\nSuch changes will undoubtedly have substantial affects on the relative attractiveness of many destinations, an issue which is already being taken seriously by the business community. For example, UK travel insurer Churchill has commissioned two reports on the future of travel. One report (Churchill 2006a) indicated that because of climate change and too many visitors, some certain sites and attractions 'could be in danger of disappearing by 2020'. The destinations that were identified and the reasons why they are regarded as threatened are list below:\n\n\u2022 Puerto de Mazarron (South-East Spain): Outbreaks of malaria as well as increased threats of flash floods, heat stress and forest fires.\n\n\u2022 Everglades (Florida, USA): Increasing hurricane danger.\n\n\u2022 Athens (Greece): Increase in summer temperatures.\n\n\u2022 Crete (Greece): Increase in high temperatures, increased desertification and water scarcity.\n\n\u2022 Cologne Cathedral (Germany): Environmental pollution.\n\n\u2022 Dalmatian coast (Croatia): Increase in visitation.\n\n\u2022 Kathmandu Valley (Nepal): Increase in visitation.\n\n\u2022 Great Barrier Reef (Queensland, Australia): Increase in visitation.\n\n\u2022 Amalfi Coast and Tuscany (Italy): Increase in heat waves.\n\n\u2022 Goa (India): Increase in beach erosion and likelihood of greater hurricane danger.\n\n\u2022 Taj Coral Reef (Maldives): Increased coastal erosion and damage to coral reefs.\n\nPerhaps understandably, not all destinations reacted well to being identified in the Churchill research. For example, the author of the research suggested that there is a conflict between environmental concerns and commercial interests with respect to the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef (Gupta 2006 \u2022 coral loss,\n\n\u2022 world wide bad publicity,\n\n\u2022 development of an algae reef, \u2022 loss of tourists.\n\nIn response, marine operators have identified a number of adaption and mitigation strategies that they can undertake themselves but more particularly they have also identified a series of needs (Table 13 .1). However, while a marketing and public relations strategy may assist with maintaining visitor numbers or satisfaction, it does not solve the underlying problem of climate change.\n\nThe problems facing reef and coastal destinations with respect to their longterm viability are also to be found at other natural resource-based destinations.\n\nFor example, alpine and high latitude destinations are particularly vulnerable (Beniston 2003; G\u00f6ssling and Hall 2006a) . The European Alps are regarded as being particularly sensitive to climate change with recent warming being approxi- warming would halve the number of snow-reliable slopes (Agrawala 2007) .\n\nWinter tourism operators are already adapting to rising snow lines and shorter winter seasons, though most are using technology rather than changing behaviour patterns. Artificial snow-making which is the dominant adaption strategy may be cost effective for ski operators, but increases demand for water and energy and affects the ecology and landscape. The costs of snow-making will increase non-linearly as temperatures warm and making snow will no longer be a viable option if temperatures increase above a certain threshold. Grooming of snow slopes can reduce the mini depth of snow required for skiing by 10-20 centimetres.\n\nHowever, as Agrawala (2007: 2) states, 'no amount of grooming can overcome significant declines or the total absence of snow cover'.\n\nAndermatt, a popular ski resort in central Switzerland has decided to act on the threat to winter sports tourism that climate change represents and has started to experiment with a high-technology protective blanket in order to stop the Gurschen Glacier from melting away (Simonian 2005 ). Yet the amount of area that can be covered remains limited. Changing the terrain by grading the slopes and rerouting natural streams also carries risks to the natural environment and increases chances of natural hazards such as flash floods and rockfalls. 'Insurance, meanwhile, can reduce the financial losses from occasional instances of snow-deficient winters, but cannot protect against systematic long-term trends towards warmer winters' (Agrawala 2007: 2) . Overall Agrawala (2007) concludes that market forces are driving adaptation with more emphasis on preserving the status quo\n\nthan transitions that might be economically and politically expensive in the short term. Nevertheless, such is the potential for changes in patterns of demand that Churchill Insurance (2006b) claim that the effects of climate change will lead to very different ski travel patterns by British skiers in the future as they seek snow-assured holidays with the ski destinations of 2050 potentially being:\n\n\u2022 Valle Nevado, Chile.\n\n\u2022 Mt. Xiling, China.\n\n\u2022 Mt. Hutt, New Zealand.\n\n\u2022 Mt. Hermon, Israel.\n\n\u2022 Manali, India.\n\n\u2022 Oukaimeden, Morocco.\n\n\u2022 Tiffindell, South Africa.\n\nAn online survey of 578 UK skiers by Churchill Insurance (2006b) \n\nFrom a global point of view, transport is the most relevant sector in terms of the long-term environmental sustainability of tourism, accounting for an estimated 75-90 per cent of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by tourism (Peeters et al. 2007 ). Within tourism transport, the share of aviation-related GHG emissions corresponds to about 75 per cent of all transport emissions (G\u00f6ssling and Hall 2006a Otago/Southland (South Island) (11) regions of New Zealand that was a part of a broader study of attitudes and behaviours in relation to GEC. Respondents participated in an annual interview regarding business and environment issues that was conducted either face to face or by phone. Interviews were conducted because of participant preference for interviews over written surveys. All businesses had an accommodation dimension although other tourism activities were also available including hunting, fishing, garden tours, wine and food; all were rural land properties some of which were also diversified commercial farms with others being best described as 'lifestyle' properties. Respondents were selected through a convenience snowball sample developed through personal contact with some respondents who had participated in previous provider research and indicated an interest in being involved in future projects.\n\nIn terms of the profile of the businesses the accommodation component tended to be quite seasonal and was managed by respondents usually with the help of other family members. This also meant that there was a relatively low level of employment of nonfamily staff. There was substantial variation in length of time of family ownership, ranging from 1 to 90 years, with a median of 8 years and a mean of 14 years. Respondents tended to have a low level of formal engagement in the tourism industry, e.g. through association memberships at a regional or national level, although otherwise they did tend to hold a high degree of social capital in their communities through membership of a range of national and local organizations such as chambers of commerce and service clubs. The profile of respondents is consistent with that identified in a previous survey of small accommodation providers in New Zealand (Hall and Rusher 2004) .\n\nThe majority of interviewees did identify climate change as a potential issue that may affect their business and personal well-being, but importantly climate change ranked well below other more immediate business concerns in terms of changes to business behaviour. Many respondents noted that although they were interested in climate change concerns, it was not an immediate or even main priority as they have more day-to-day concerns with running a business. The five most important issues for respondents being:\n\n1 Costs of operating a business.\n\n2 Regulation by government -in terms of costs and time taken by small businesses to meet regulatory requirements.\n\n3 Competition -in terms of too many operators which may then lead to a loss of market share as well as price-cutting.\n\n4 Quality -concern over the entrance of other operators that provided a poor standard of service which could then be seen as affecting their own business viability.\n\n5 Inappropriate rural development and pollution and its impact on the landscape and personal and visitor amenity.\n\nClimate change was seen by some respondents as a potentially significant business and even personal issue. But in comparison with more immediate issues that were identified as more important in terms of business survival (see above), climate change was recognized as a possible medium to long-term issue (5\u03e9 years). Importantly, such comments were consistent over the research period, meaning that climate change was constantly being seen as a problem in the longer term. The comments of one respondent, 'Look, if it doesn't affect my daily business operations then I can't afford to think about it, let alone spend money on it' representing a widespread sentiment among interviewees. The only exception to this attitude being when a storm, flood or other high-impact event had occurred that respondents potentially associated with climate change and which was perceived as potentially damaging to the environment on which the business partly relied and/or on the property of the respondent.\n\nFamiliarity with climate change issues was gained through general media, although interestingly other GEC issues (biosecurity, water security) were understood through more technical media such as that available through government agencies at the national and regional level as well as through agricultural field days operated in part through agricultural and farming associations. The extent to which information regarding different dimensions of environmental change was gained through various media appeared to have substantial influence on the extent such information was seen as trustworthy and reliable. A clear hierarchy existed with respect to trustworthiness of information source across all respondents with Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries information and agricultural field days being regarded as highly trustworthy; Ministry of the Environment, Regional and Local Council sources and other operators and business people were held as moderately trustworthy; and the general media (radio, television and newspapers) and politicians perceived to have a low level of trust with respect to statements regarding climate change and other aspects of GEC.\n\nInnovation and adaption measures were developed by some respondents in relation to environmental change issues with respect to biosecurity and water security concerns but were not necessarily overtly directly to climate change. A number of respondents whose businesses had horticultural or agricultural components in addition to accommodation or other tourism offerings had started to restrict visitor access to parts of their property as a result of biosecurity concerns. However, such restrictions were primarily connected to concerns over visitor health and safety and any breach of law in relation to safety.\n\nWater conservation emerged as a major focus of respondents in terms of making existing use more efficient as well as developing new storage strategies. For many larger properties that also had farm operations, concern over water security was also leading to consideration of new management strategies including irrigation or developing an economic base, i.e. through new crops such as olives or almonds that required less water.\n\nNevertheless, even small accommodation operations were looking at installing dual-flush toilets or other mechanisms to restrict water use. Interestingly, such innovations were often seen as being acceptable to the market as well as having water security and environmental benefits. Several respondents commented that because they had stayed in hotels and motels in the larger New Zealand cities as well as internationally that had dual-flush toilets and statements regarding towel use in bathrooms they felt that they could also adopt such initiatives without affecting the attractiveness of their operation.\n\nOne respondent stated that they made changes shortly after they commenced their farm accommodation business as a result of feedback from German visitors who told them that they felt that water saving measures would 'fit in' better with the image of such rural tourism operations in a country promoting itself as being environmentally friendly as well as being welcomed by environmentally conscious customers.\n\nEven though many respondents commented that they felt that weather patterns were changing and that these may be related to climate change they generally did not associate climate change with potential new seasonal visitor patterns. Many commented that New Zealand always will have 'Four seasons in one day' and that this was just a part of the visitor experience. Overall, if discussed further, respondents felt that seasonal change was 'usually, something they hadn't thought about' but if prompted respondents suggested that official public holidays and institutionalized periods of holiday-taking, such as school holidays, were the most important determinants of seasonality, although some interviewees did also state that they did not believe that climate change would be so substantial as to, according to one respondent, 'completely change tourist patterns'.\n\nAgain, these types of statements were consistently held over the research period with many interviewees consistently stating that seasonal change was not an issue for them.\n\nWhere changes to operator behaviour were expressed as occurring as a result of climate change it was often associated with perceived immediate weather impacts on business operations, e.g. severe storm and flooding events or extended dry periods in relation to farms which are also used for homestays or other guest accommodation. The greatest expressions of concern over climate change and its potential affects at both a personal and national level were from those respondents who had been directly affected by extreme weather events or has seen the effects of such events. Significantly, those respondents who had directly experienced extreme weather events were also those whose responses to questions of climate change were more likely to have shifted over the study period, although certainly not in all cases.\n\nDespite the recognition of a number of respondents of the potential longer-term effects of climate change and the need for 'government to do something', increased regulation or 'green' taxes on carbon or GHG emissions were opposed if it added to business costs. This reflected the prime focus on respondents on managing day-to-day immediate business risk rather than what was seen as a potential future hazerd, even if it was regarded as one that was likely to occur. Responses of businesses whether at the personal (what would they do?) or a national level (what should New Zealand do?) therefore focused on adaption to climate change rather than mitigation. Indeed, concerns were expressed over the potential of 'green' or 'carbon taxes' to increase the cost of aviation or car travel and therefore affect the travel market to the regions in which respondents were located which are away from the main tourist flows in New Zealand as well as any direct cost to the business.\n\nThe results of the New Zealand study were reasonably similar to that of a survey of winter tourism entrepreneurs in Finland (Saarinen and Tervo 2007) . The Finnish entrepreneurs were aware of the issue of global climate change. However, half of the interviewees did not believe that the phenomenon actually exists and will influence tourism in their destinations in the future. Their main source of information on climate change was the general media. However, more than three-quarters of the Finnish respondents criticized the information provided by the media and it was very common for personal observations of climatic phenomena to be used to not only critically evaluate but also reinforce such information. Half of the interviewees had observed events that had strengthened their image of climate change. These included both events that support changing climate but also events that seem to have run counter to such change. Few entrepreneurs gained information from academic or scientific studies on the subject.\n\nAs in New Zealand the issue of climate change was seen only as a minor threat by Finnish tourism operators, if a threat at all, particularly relative to other factors that might have an effect on the industry or their businesses. The Finnish operators were able to rationalize why they had not, or why they were not even considering plans for adaptation strategies and measures to face projected climate change. According to respondents, the most important reason was the slow pace of change. As Saarinen and Tervo (2007) comment, 'A tourism entrepreneur hardly ever plans his future more than five years in advance; in some cases, one year's forethought is sufficient \u2026 Although the\n\nDespite substantial concerns over the impacts of climate change there are enormous difficulties in predicting the effects of such change as it is extremely unrealistic to assume linearity in tourist behaviour change, i.e. that there will be direct causality in the relationship between changes in temperature and destination TOURISM IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY tourism business is often based on taking risks, entrepreneurs were not willing to rush into implementing uncertain actions if they do not know if the climate in the future is going to be warmer, colder, or more unstable in their region, and how it will actually affect their operations'. The scepticism towards the climate change may also help explain why there were almost no adaptation strategies. Nevertheless, the lack of adaptation strategies does not necessary imply that the tourism industry could not cope with a changing climate in the future. As many of the Finnish operators argued, they have been working and also struggling with climatic variability and extreme weather events with moderate or good success during the existence of their business career. Hall, C.M. (2007) . New Zealand tourism entrepreneur attitudes and behaviours with respect to cli- choice and behaviour. Such linearity is dangerous because in addition to temperature, the relationship between tourism and climate also includes factors such as 'rain', 'storms', 'humidity', 'hours of sunshine', 'wind strength' and 'air pollution'; and the role of weather information in decision-making (G\u00f6ssling and Hall 2006b ).\n\nIn addition, destination choice is also predicated on a number of non-climate-related factors such as cost, accessibility, perception and image of destinations, security and other impacting variables, including the travel budget (in time and money) of the consumer.\n\nEven if some climate change does change tourist behaviour this does not necessarily mean that the overall number of visitors to a destination will necessarily decline. For example, rather than travel elsewhere tourists may select a different time of travel. In addition, much will depend on the relative elasticity of demand associated with different types of travel. Leisure travel is probably the most flexible in terms of destination and time of travel but business travel and visiting friends and relations (VFR) are far more inelastic. Some destinations will also benefit from climate change. For example, in the case of the ski industry those resorts that are snow assured will likely increase their market share, while new markets will emerge for other alpine resorts such as year round hiking and mountain biking opportunities. Similarly, even in the case of the predicted dramatic loss of permanent sea ice in the Arctic with the subsequent threats to iconic wildlife such as polar bears it has nevertheless been concluded that there is a likelihood of further expansion of tourism in the Arctic because there will be greater accessibility to the region (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment 2004).\n\nAs serious as climate change and other aspects of GEC are, one of the most significant issues facing tourism is the increased costs of energy and issues of availability. According to the Energy Committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2005: 1) 'It is very likely that the world is now entering a challenging period for energy supply, due to the limited resources and production problems now facing conventional (easily accessible) oil. Nearly 40 per cent of the world's energy is provided by oil, and over 50 per cent of the latter is used in the transport sector'.\n\nAccording to the Committee, mitigation measures must be initiated in the next few years in order to secure a continued adequate supply of liquid fuels, especially for TOURISM FUTURES the transport sector. Aviation will be more fuel efficient in the future as a result of technological innovations but possibilities are limited and although energy use per person per kilometre will fall, the overall predicted increase in the number and distance of people flying will mean that overall fuel use and amount of emissions will continue to grow (Peeters et al. 2007) . However, over the longer term, completely new energy solutions are required given the decline of cheap oil. Key issues with respect to oil supply are detailed in Table 13 .2.\n\nIn the immediate term the impacts of increased oil prices on tourism seem relatively small. According to the UNWTO (2006) , the impact of rising oil prices on international tourism has so far been limited because the effect of price increases as reflected in constant currency rates has been mainly to catch up with inflation and the direct impact of oil prices in 2005 was within a range of less than 5 per cent which was regarded as insufficient to alter consumer behaviour. Although the WTO did not make any comment with respect to the impact of increased real oil prices they did note that 'uncertainty as to price levels is already affecting behaviour, as tour operators find it increasingly difficult to anticipate short-term 5 Immediate action on Improvements in the search for and recovery of conventional supplies oil as well as the production rate of unconventional oil are required to avoid price spikes, which would lead to instability of the world economy over the next few decades.\n\n6 Liquid fuels and the Oil supply is a severe liquid fuels problem and less of a general transport system energy supply problem; 57 per cent of the world's oil is consumed in the transport sector. Alternatives need to be developed to oil in the transport sector otherwise not only will there be increased oil prices but also increased competition between transport and other oil users.\n\n7 Economic considerations In the long run, the price of crude oil will be determined by the price of substitutes. Continued high oil prices are anticipated as long as the pressure from the expanding Asian economies is maintained.\n\n8 Environmental concerns Unconventional oil will significantly extend the length of the hydrocarbon era and its subsequent contributions to GHG emissions. Constraints similar to those imposed on other fossil fuels (e.g. emission controls and CO2 sequestration) will be necessary and provide major challenges for industry. demand. Tourism enterprises unable to make the necessary adjustments in time could therefore find their profitability at risk' (UNWTO 2006: 36) . When domestic and international travel markets are combined, the impacts of increased oil prices are more significant. An Australian study by O'Mahony et al. (2006) found that approximately 25-35 per cent of those that had taken a holiday or were planning one did suggest changes to their plans to negotiate the impact of fuel. As may be expected given consideration of the role of budgets in determining travel patterns (Hall 2005a) and least influence among those on the highest income (A $100 000 plus).\n\nIn examining the impacts of climate change or increases in the cost of oil a key finding is that people will continue to travel but that the relative attractiveness and accessibility of some destinations will likely change in relation to other destinations.\n\nSuch a situation does not mean the end of tourism but instead will provide for new opportunities for destinations and businesses. In such a dynamic environment the provision of positive service and visitor experiences and improved marketing will become even more important. In addition, there will be an even greater onus on destinations and firms to understand key elements of the business environment such as changing consumer lifestyles and the new regulatory frameworks that are implemented by government to manage human mobility at a time of increased concerns over energy and environmental security.\n\nPeople make their own history. They also make their own future. A number of different possible futures for tourism exist that will perhaps be more dependent on factors outside of the industry, such as environmental change, economic conditions and lifestyles, than things within the control of tourism destinations and firms. Therefore, the future of tourism and arguably the study of tourism is embedded as much within concerns over how people get there, i.e. issues of human mobility, as it is over more traditional concerns as what they do when they get there, i.e. a destination and activity focus.\n\nMuch of today's tourism infrastructure is shaped by almost half a century's assumptions that we would have cheap oil and energy, that it was possible to respond to market demand by building more capacity, and that 'predict and provide' assumptions of infrastructure supply would meet transport needs. Not only has infrastructure been shaped by such assumptions but also successive generations of people in development countries who take long-distance mobility as a norm and which lead consumptive lifestyles to which the people of the rapidly emerging economic of Asia seem to aspire too. As the UK Foresight Directorate (2006a) report on Intelligent Infrastructure Systems observed:\n\nEnergy is not cheap, and is most unlikely to be cheaper 50 years hence.\n\nIndeed, most people would anticipate significantly higher prices. The idea that the UK could build new roads at the same pace as it did during the past half-century is simply untenable -'road protests' did not exist 50 years ago.\n\nAs to market forces, the new presumptions of future circumstances -that we have to anticipate and ameliorate the likely impacts of climate change, and that sustainability now deserves as much attention as economic growthmake it hard to see how the private sector alone can make the difficult choices.\n\nThe Foresight Directorate outlined four scenarios set in a post-oil world of personal transport for the future of human mobility, including tourism (2006b). The two main uncertainties which drove the scenarios were:\n\n1 Whether or not we will develop low-environmental impact transport systems.\n\n2 Whether or not people will accept intelligent infrastructure.\n\nFour scenarios were developed which were labelled perpetual motion, urban colonies, tribal trading and good intentions ( \u2022 Traffic volumes have fallen and mass transportation is used more widely.\n\n\u2022 Businesses have adopted energy-efficient practices: they use wireless identification and tracking systems to optimize logistics and distribution.\n\n\u2022 Some rural areas pool community carbon credits for local transport provision, but many are struggling.\n\n\u2022 Airlines continue to exploit loopholes in the carbon enforcement framework.\n\nPerpetual motion \u2022 Society is driven by constant information, consumption and competition. In this world, instant communication and continuing globalization has fuelled growth: demand for travel remains strong.\n\n\u2022 New, cleaner, fuel technologies are increasingly popular. Road use is causing less environmental damage, although the volume and speed of traffic remains high. Aviation still relies on carbon fuels -it remains expensive and is increasingly replaced by 'telepresencing' for business, and rapid trains for travel.\n\nTribal trading \u2022 The world has been through a sharp and savage energy shock. The global economic system is severely damaged and infrastructure is falling into disrepair.\n\n\u2022 Long-distance travel is a luxury that few can afford and for most people, the world has shrunk to their own community.\n\n\u2022 Cities have declined and local food production and services have increased.\n\n\u2022 There are still some cars, but local transport is typically by bike and by horse.\n\n\u2022 There are local conflicts over resources: lawlessness and mistrust are high.\n\nUrban colonies \u2022 Investment in technology primarily focuses on minimizing environmental impact.\n\n\u2022 Good environmental practice is at the heart of the UK's economic and social policies: sustainable buildings, distributed power generation and new urban planning policies have created compact, dense cities.\n\n\u2022 Transport is permitted only if green and clean -car use is energyexpensive and restricted.\n\n\u2022 Public transport (electric and low energy) is efficient and widely used. before, particularly in terms of long-distance travel. Many believe that they have a right to mobility. But at the same time the opportunities for mobility are likely going to become increasingly constrained.\n\nIt is highly probable that tourism itself will have undergone significant change in 50 years time, not only with respect to the products and services that destinations and firms offer but also in terms of how it is conceptualized. To an extent such processes are already taking place as the borders between leisure, tourism and migration become increasingly hazy. These changes will be seen in the working lives of the people who read this text. Yet in all of these the service dimension at the heart of tourism stays a constant.\n\nWe cannot understand the consumption of tourism without also understanding its production, and vice versa. In this book, we have sought to emphasize this dimension of co-creation through an examination of the key elements of tourism.\n\nPeople will continue to travel from their permanent home to visit other places, some of which are even so close that they can be visited in a day, and people will continue to provide services that enable such movement and the opportunity to visit elsewhere. Much of the attention to such provision is on the physical infrastructure yet just as significant, if not more so, is the intellectual capital of tourism.\n\nA contemporary perspective on tourism understands the complex supply and value chains that affects how services are produced and acknowledges that the consumer and the supplier of tourism are interdependent. And it is this intellectual capital that allows not only for a better understanding of tourism as an area of study but also how the future of tourism may be improved for those who work in the industry, those who are affected by the industry and those tourists who 'make' the industry.\n\n1 What is a wildcard event?\n\n2 How accurate is expert knowledge with respect to forecasting?\n\n3 What are the main values of undertaking forecasting exercises?\n\n4 What are the forecast key effects of climate change and their likely affect on destination environments?\n\n5 Why is it difficult to predict the impacts of climate change on travel flows and patterns?\n\n6 What are the key issues for tourism in relation to oil supply?\n\n7 What might be the effects of continued high oil prices on tourism?\n\n8 What values may scenarios have with respect to considering the future of tourism?\n\n9\n\nTo what extent do people believe they have rights of mobility and how might this affect future transport planning?\n\n10 Should we go see the world's major attractions now before they are destroyed? The four different scenarios provide fascinating accounts of potential trends in human mobility. The first book on tourism and climate change that presents chapters from experts in relation to North America, Europe and the Mediterranean. An important study on the environmental, economic and social impacts of climate change on winter destinations in Europe that is also significant as it comes from a conservative economic organization."}
