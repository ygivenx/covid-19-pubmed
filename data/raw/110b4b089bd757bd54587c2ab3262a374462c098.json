{"title": "The permeabilized SecY protein-translocation channel can serve as a nonspecific 1 sugar transporter Running Title: Bacterial nonspecific sugar transport 17 18", "body": "demonstrates that weakening the sealability of the SecY channel allowed free diffusion of 23 sugars, including glucose, fructose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and lactose, into the 24 engineered cells, facilitating its rapid growth on a wide spectrum of monosaccharides and 25 bypassing/reducing stereospecificity, transport saturation, competitive inhibition, and (Cirillo, 1961; Reinhold & Kaplan, 1984; Chen et al, 2015) . Active transport requires 40 metabolic energy to passage molecules across the plasma membrane in the direction 41 against the concentration gradient, whereas passive transport moves molecules down its 42 concentration without needing an energy input, which can be further classified as 43 facilitated diffusion and free diffusion, respectively. Active transport and facilitated 44 diffusion are dependent on the specific molecular binding between cargo and transporter, 45 thereby exhibiting stereospecificity, transport saturation, and competitive inhibition 46 (Cirillo, 1961) . Moreover, numerous sugars are taken up with concomitant 47 phosphorylation via the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase 48 system (PTS), which may cause carbon catabolite repression (CCR), leading to a diauxic 49 cell growth (St\u00fclke & Hillen, 1999) . Fig 1A illustrates the main transporters of glucose, 50 fructose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and lactose in Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative, 51 facultatively anaerobic bacterium. In contrast, free diffusion is a non-mediated transport 52 with a linear rate in proportion to the concentration difference. However, it is believed 53 that only small, non-polar molecules, such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, can freely 54 diffuse through the plasma membrane (Zhao et al, 2011).

In bacteria, this channel is 60 formed by the SecY complex (SecYEG) and is located in the plasma membrane 61 (Brundage et al, 1990; Akimaru et al, 1991; Breyton et al, 2002) . The X-ray crystal 62 structure revealed that the SecY channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow central 63 constriction consisting of six hydrophobic amino acid residues termed the pore ring, and (Kornberg et al, 2000) , these 74 findings prompted us to hypothesize that whether the SecY channel can be designed as a 75 free diffusion passageway for efficient transport of carbohydrates, thus developing an 76 entirely novel paradigm for sugar passage and addressing the problems encountered with 77 the specific transporters. In the present work, we engineered the SecY channel by plug 78 All rights reserved.

In contrast, the limited growth on glucose 91 caused by insufficient import of the sole carbon source was partially rescued. We 92 reasoned that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow glucose to diffuse through the plasma 93 membrane due to its small V A (\u2248 0.178 m 3 /kmol) and large diffusion coefficient (D AB \u2248 94 1.009\u00d710 -9 m 2 /s) in water (Appendix Table S1 ), which was confirmed by a [ 14 C]-labelled 95 glucose transport assay (Fig 2C) . With the purpose of further enhancing the glucose 96 uptake, SCVE was co-expressed with the SecY (\u0394P) channel (Fig 2A and B) . The SCVE 97 has the ability to permeabilize the outer membrane of E. coli by formation of the 98 transmembrane pores as porins (Liao et al, 2004) . The reduced permeation barrier of the 99 outer membrane might increase the glucose gradient across the SecY (\u0394P) channel, thus 100 accelerating the glucose diffusion into the cytoplasm ( Fig 2C) and resulting in a marked 101 All rights reserved.

(Fig 3A and B) , and the growth of the strain without ManXYZ on mannose was 122 even faster than the control (Fig 3D and E) , suggesting that the fructose or mannose 123 imported by the SecY (\u0394P) channel already satisfied the cell demand.

The data of growth kinetics in when compared with the wild-type E. coli (Fig 3G and J) , which was also found in the 143 case of mannose ( Fig 3D) . Interestingly, previous work reported that a mutant glucose 144 facilitator protein (2-RD5) from Zymomonas mobilis allowed rapid transport of xylose in 145 E. coli, but in contrast, 2-RD5 caused an extensive growth delay (Ren et al, 2009) .

The 149 use of the SecY (\u0394P) channel did not seem to facilitate the initiation of the arabinose-150 inducible promoter P BAD (Fig EV3) , which controls the synthesis of the key enzymes 151 (AraBAD) involved in the pathway of arabinose metabolism in E. coli (Schleif, 2000) . 152 Therefore, we suspect that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow E. coli to import not only Table S1 ), resulting in a reduced 167 sugar flux through the pore ring of SecY (\u0394P). We thus replaced the isoleucines 168 (molecular weight Mr \u2248 131.18 g/mol) in the pore ring with glycines (Mr \u2248 75.07 g/mol) 169 to amplify the channel open size (Fig 4B) .

By co-173 expression of SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG) and SCVE, E. coli (\u0394LacY) exhibited a moderate 174 growth on lactose 50 h after cell inoculation (Fig 4A) . 175 The benefits of using the SecY channel mutant for sugar transport 176 Unlike free diffusion which is linear in the concentration difference, the rate of active 177 transport or facilitated diffusion tends to approach saturation as the external sugar content The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/378786 doi: bioRxiv preprint 11 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (CAS), respectively.
