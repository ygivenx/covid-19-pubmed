{"title": "SYNTHESIS AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF SEVERAL MODIFIED 5D-ANDROSTANOLONE DERIVATIVES", "body": "Herein, the antiviral activities of new 3-7 and steroids 9-12 that were prepared by us earlier from pregnenolone 8 [11] are reported. The structures were 3E-hydroxy-1c-p-chlorophenyl- (9) , 3E-hydroxy-1c-p-bromophenyl-(10), 3E-hydroxy-1c-p-methylphenyl-3c-methyl-5D-androstano[17,16-d]pyrazoline (11) , and 5D-preg-16-en-3E-ol-20-one p-nitrophenylhydrazone (12) .\n\nThe structures of 2-7 were confirmed using IR, NMR, and mass spectra. The IR spectrum of ketone 2 showed C=O absorption bands at 1700 and 1750 cm -1 . Singlets for angular 18-and 19-CH 3 protons in the PMR spectrum (in CDCl 3 ) appeared at G 0.86 and 1.27 ppm; a multiplet for the 3D-proton, 4.72; aromatic protons, 7.28-7.33; and phenylacetoxy methylene proton, 3.60. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 2 had resonances for phenyl-ring C atoms in the range 126. The structure of 2 was also confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure analysis (XSA) ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Antiviral activity of 3-7 and 9-12 was studied and showed that hydrazone 4 had high; 5, 10, and 12, moderate; and pyrazoline 9, weak antiviral activity against Polio virus (Vero 76 cell culture, strain Type 3, WM-3) ( Table 2 ). The other steroids were inactive. Hydrazones 4 and 5 were weakly active against Sars corona virus (Vero 76 cell culture, strain Urbani). The other compounds were inactive. Compounds 5, 9, and 12 were weakly active whereas the other steroids were inactive against Rift valley fevervirus (Vero 76 cell culture, strain MP-12). Only hydrazone 5 exhibited weak activity against Takaribe virus (Vero cell culture, strain TRVL-11573). All steroids 3-7 and 9-12 were inactive against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza A virus H 1 N 1 , and Dengue virus (Vero cell culture, MA-104, MDCK; Vero 76; strains TC-83; A-2; California 07.2009; Type 2, New Guinea C, respectively).\n\nPMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded from CDCl 3 and DMSO-d 6 solutions with TMS internal standard on a Bruker Avance 400 instrument (400.13 MHz for 1 H and 100.61 MHz for 13 C). IR spectra were taken from KBr pellets on a Varian 660 FTIR spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained on an HPLC-APCIMS (positive mode)-Agilent 1100 Series with an Inertsil PREP-ODS column (6.0 u 250 mm) and elution of steroids by H 2 O-MeCN (20:80). Melting points were determined on a NAGEMA apparatus. The course of reactions and purity of synthesized compounds were monitored by TLC on Silufol UV-254 plates using C 6 H 6 -Me 2 CO (10:1, 6:1). Chromatograms were detected using phosphomolybdic acid solution (10%) in EtOH followed by heating.\n\n3E-Phenylacetoxy-5D-androstan-17-one (2). A solution of epiandrosterone 1 (0.3 g, 1 mmol) in anhydrous C 6 H 6 (20 mL) and anhydrous Py (0.3 mL) was treated with phenylacetic acid chloride (0.19 g, 1.2 mmol) , refluxed for 6 h, cooled same diffractometer. Absorption corrections for the crystals were made semi-empirically using the SADABS program [14] . Table 1 presents the main XSA and refinement parameters for the structure of 2. The structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program suite and refined using the SHELXL-97 program [15] . All nonhydrogen atoms were refined by full-matrix anisotropic least-squares methods (over F 2 ). Positions of H atoms were found geometrically and refined with fixed isotropic thermal factors U iso = nU eq , where n = 1.5 for methyls and 1.2 for others and U eq is the equivalent isotropic thermal factor of the corresponding C atom.\n\nResults from the XSA were deposited as a CIF-file in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)."}
