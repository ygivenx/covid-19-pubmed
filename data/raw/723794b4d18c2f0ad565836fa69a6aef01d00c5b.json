{"title": "LDH Concentration in Nasal-Wash Fluid as a Biochemical Predictor of Bronchiolitis Severity NIH Public Access", "body": "Bronchiolitis is an acute lower respiratory tract illness that affects the bronchioles of infants and young children. 1 It is predominantly a viral disease, and the number of cases where no agent is identified has decreased over the years with the widespread use of more sensitive diagnostic techniques 2 and the recognition of new viruses. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the chief cause of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness in young children 8, 9 and the most common agent recovered from children with bronchiolitis. 10 There is a need to have a biochemical marker of disease severity to assist the clinician in determining the need for hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be such a biochemical marker because of its relation to tissue injury. LDH is a membrane-associated protein involved in the oxidation of various organic substrates. 11 It is present in all major organ systems, and when found extracellularly, indicates cell damage and inflammation. 12 Measurement of LDH in bronchoalveolar fluid is commonly done as a surrogate for the presence of leukocytes and overall inflammation. In children with RSV bronchiolitis, neutrophils account for over 90% of total cells in nasal washes (NWs) and more than 70% in bronchoalveolar fluid. 13, 14 LDH activity in NW and serum has not been reported for children with bronchiolitis.\n\nWe postulated that LDH would directly correlate with the proinflammatory immune response observed in bronchiolitis, and that it would be a useful biochemical marker of disease severity. We measured LDH in NW and serum specimens from a cohort of children with bronchiolitis that we have reported previously. 15 Our findings indicate that NW LDH levels are greater in children with less severe bronchiolitis; are independently associated with disease outcome, and may constitute a new clinical tool allowing physicians to better establish risk for disease progression. These findings are in direct agreement with our prior observations that reported on the benefits of a robust pro-inflammatory innate response in ameliorating bronchiolitis disease. 15 \n\nAspects of the study have been detailed previously 15 , and consisted of a prospective investigation of children <24 months old presenting to the emergency department (ED) with bronchiolitis from November 1, 2004 to February 28, 2005 . Children presenting with respiratory distress unrelated to a viral-like respiratory illness were excluded. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. Bronchiolitis was defined as an acute lower airway infection (presence of tachypnea, crackles, wheezing, and/or retractions) and a history of a previous upperairway infection (defined as nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea) diagnosed by experienced pediatric ED physicians. The decision to hospitalize a patient was under the discretion of the attending physician following standard clinical pathways. Parameters of disease severity included the need for hospitalization, oxygen supplementation, intravenous fluids and requirement for intubation.\n\nOn arrival to the ED, and after parental consent was obtained, study personnel recorded patient demographic and clinical information and conducted a physical examination. A nasal-wash sample was obtained using a standardize procedure. 15 Viral transport medium was added to a final 1:1 dilution. Aliquots were made, snapped-frozen in a dry ice/alcohol bath, and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C.\n\nViral identification was done in our original report by tissue culture and reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), allowing for viral detection in 80 of 98 enrolled children 15 with a 5% prevalence of viral co-infection. In this report, we improved our detection of viruses by testing all specimens with real-time RT-PCR using specific primers and fluorescent probes for RSV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human rhinovirus,. [16] [17] [18] As a result, 17 new diagnoses of rhinovirus and two of RSV infection (1 for each subtype A and B) were made. No new case of HMPV infection was detected.\n\nRSV concentration was quantified by using 2 methods. Firstly, all RSV-positive samples were titrated by plaque assay in duplicates, and reported as plaque forming units per milliliter (pfu/mL), as previously described. 15, 19, 20 Secondly, all samples were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR blinded to quantitative culture results. Calibrated standards for each target were assayed in parallel to the samples. The number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to reach a threshold level was recorded as the crossing threshold. Therefore, the lower the crossing threshold, the higher the amount of genomic material and vice versa.\n\nNW samples were tested for cytokines and chemokines with the Bioplex Human Cytokine 17-plex panel (Bio-Rad Laboratories [Hercules, CA]) following manufacturer instructions. The lower limit of detection for all cytokines and chemokines was 1 pg/mL. These values have been previously reported. 15\n\nTotal protein was quantified in nasal secretions by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific, Rockford IL) following the manufacturer instructions and expressed as micrograms per milliliter.\n\nTotal LDH activity was tested in NW samples and sera. NW and serum specimens were diluted 1:1 and 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline, respectively, and assayed in duplicates following protocol instructions (Cytotoxic Detection Kit, Roche Applied Science [Indianapolis, IN]). To calculate absolute values, L-LDH (Roche Applied Science) was used to construct a standard curve that demonstrated an ample linear dynamic range (r=.998) at the dilutions tested from 0.8 to 110 U/mL. The concentration of LDH in NW samples were adjusted fourfold for the dilution resulting from specimen collection.\n\nLDH release may be a marker of cell destruction caused by virus or the host cellular immune response, or may be due to apoptosis induced by virus or the innate immune response. To measure apoptosis in nasal secretions, the Caspase-Glo-3/7 kit (Promega [Madison, WI]) was used. The luminescence was measured with a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech [Cary, NC]) and expressed as relative luminescence units.\n\nLDH concentrations (in NW and serum samples) and caspase activity were normalized by log 10 transformation. The statistical evaluation of normally distributed continuous variables was performed with Student's t test or 1-way analysis of variance as appropriate. Differences of proportions of non-parametric data were compared with the \u03c7 2 test. Correlations were calculated by Pearson's or Spearman's coefficients as appropriate. Statistical significance was established with 2-tailed tests and an \u03b1 level of P<.05.\n\nThe association between hospitalization (defined as hospital stay >24 hours) and independent variables was investigated with multivariate logistic regression analyses. Factors identified by univariate analysis were included in the model if the association with the outcome had P value less than .25. The initial model contained the following categorical variables: age (\u22643 or >3 months); fever (yes or no), hypoxia (yes or no), administration of intravenous fluid (yes or no), and detection of a viral pathogen (yes or no). The NW LDH concentration and the caspase 3/7 activity were classified in quartiles for inclusion in the model (\u226575% or <75%). We removed fever, detection of a virus, and caspase 3/7 activity from the final model because they did not contribute to the goodness-of-fit of the model. \n\nAs described in detail in our previous study, 101 children with bronchiolitis were enrolled from the ED at Texas Children's Hospital. Two patients were excluded from the analyses (1 violated inclusion criteria, and another withdrew consent). One specimen was lost in transit to the laboratory although clinical information was retained. NW samples were available for viral diagnosis in 98 subjects. Clinical data was available in 97 patients with known caspase levels and 94 patients with known LDH concentration in NWs. The total numbers of children in the analyses reflect the missing data Median age at presentation was 5.6 months (range: 0.46-23.9), and 64% were boys. 15 Fortysix percent had a family history of asthma, and 22% had a history of eczema. Median duration of illness at the time of presentation to the ED was 4 days (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.2 \u00b1 4.2 days).\n\nA specific viral etiology was determined in 83.6% of the patients (Table 1) . RSV infection was the leading cause of bronchiolitis, present in 66.3% of individuals. Rhinovirus was second in frequency, being detected in 19.4% cases. Of note, 16% of patients had dual infections.\n\nAnalysis of RSV subgroups revealed 52 cases of RSV-A and 13 cases of RSV-B. There were no differences in children with A or B strains with respect to hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, oxygen requirement > 24 hours, IVF requirement >24 hours or mean concentrations of LDH in the NW samples (data not shown). The proportion of RSV infected subjects was comparable between those hospitalized versus those discharged home from the ED (P = .3).\n\nThere were no differences in NW LDH concentrations according to age, gender, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, family history of atopy, environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, day care attendance or exposure to young children ( \n\nNW LDH concentration was determined in the study population (Fig 1) . Levels were not significantly different between children in the following age groups: <3, 3 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 23 months (data not shown). No correlation was observed between concentration of LDH in serum and NW fluid (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.06; P = .6).\n\nWe have observed in vitro that increased RSV replication in respiratory epithelial cells results in greater concentrations of LDH in the supernatant, and that this effect is potentiated by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines. 21 The correlation between NW LDH and infectious RSV measured by plaque assay failed to reach statistical significance (P = .05, Fig 2A) , however, a significant correlation was noticed when the RSV load was quantified by subgroup-specific real-time PCR (RSV-A, r = \u22120.48, P < .001; RSV-B: r = \u22120.62, P = . 015, Fig 2 B and C).\n\nTotal protein content in the NW fluid may be a combination of proteins released during virus-induced epithelial cell injury and the host immune response. As expected, a significant correlation was observed between NW total protein and NW LDH concentration (r = 0.48; P < .001; Fig 2D) .\n\nT helper (Th) 1 cytokines (Interleukin-2 [IL-2], interferon \u03b3, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10), and other proinflammatory cytokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2, monocytes chemoattractant protein 1, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], and granulocyte colonystimulating factor) detected in NW fluid samples were all strongly correlated with LDH in NW samples (Table 3) . A positive linear correlation was observed between NW LDH and NW caspase 3/7, a measure of apoptosis activity (r = 0.75; P < .001) (Fig 3) .\n\nClassic indicators of bronchiolitis severity are shown in Table 4 with their respective levels of NW LDH. Children with bronchiolitis who were discharged home from the hospital from the ED had significantly higher NW LDH concentrations than those who were admitted for supportive care (2.36 vs. 1.85 U/mL; P = .002) (Fig 4) . Hospitalization occurred in 82%, 71%, 50%, and 58% of children aged 0 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to11 and 12 to 23 months, respectively.\n\nApproximately half of the hospitalized patients required supplemental oxygen. Patients receiving oxygen >24 hours had lower NW LDH levels compared to children who received \u2264;24 hours of oxygen, although this difference disappeared when considering only those children who were hospitalized (data not shown). Patients with high levels of NW LDH received shorter duration of oxygen supplementation or none (Wilcoxon rank-sum test z = 2.76; P = .006). Intubation was not associated with differences in NW LDH, but only 6 patients required mechanical ventilation. Collectively, these data indicate that a more severe clinical presentation leading to hospitalization was associated with lower levels of NW LDH concentration.\n\nQuartile distribution of NW LDH was as follows: low-quartile group, <31.2 U/mL; midquartile, 31.2 to 364.8 U/mL; high-quartile, \u2265364.8 U/mL. The univariate analysis identified the following variables for inclusion in the multivariate logistic regression analysis for hospitalization: presence of fever (odds ratio [OR]: 0.48; P = .12), need for intravenous fluids (OR: 13.2; P < .001), detection of a viral pathogen (OR: 0.41; P = .19), age \u22643 months (OR: 3.19; P = .02), NW LDH concentration above 75% percentile (OR: 0.14; P < . 001), NW-caspase activity above 75% percentile (OR: 0.47; P = .13), and presence of hypoxia (OR: 9.80; P = .03). The final multivariate prediction model for hospitalization among children presenting to the ED with bronchiolitis is presented in Table 5 . In this model, age \u22643 months and the presence of hypoxia were associated with ~ 5-and 12-fold increase in hospitalization, respectively. High concentrations of NW LDH (\u2265365 U/mL ) were associated with an 81% reduction in the need for admission (P = .011).\n\nThe final model gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.87, with a Pearson goodness-of-fit test statistic of 12.85 (P = .12) (Fig 5) . Assuming a predicted probability of hospitalization cutoff value of 0.5, the model correctly classified 79.6% of patients when all observations were available for inclusion in the logistic regression. Twelve patients would have been incorrectly sent home (false negative rate, 19%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 81%, 77%, 88% and 66%, respectively.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of LDH in NW specimens of young children with bronchiolitis. NW LDH was found to be a significant independent biochemical marker in reducing the risk for hospitalization. We observed that NW LDH levels were significantly higher in children sent home from the ED compared to those admitted for bronchiolitis (P = .002), and strongly correlated with the apoptosis marker caspase 3/7 and with cytokines and chemokines involved in the innate and adaptive immune response. The detection of viruses was associated with higher NW LDH values. It is important to note that NW LDH did not correlate with serum LDH, implying that NW LDH originated from cellular events that occurred in the respiratory airways.\n\nWe did not observe a correlation between NW and serum LDH. This indicates that LDH in nasal secretions is unlikely to be derived from capillary extravasation of protein into the airways. Supporting this notion, studies evaluating LDH concentration in bronchoalveolar fluid concluded that its source is different from serum. 22, 23 When considering the relation of NW-to-serum LDH as a ratio, a factor \u22650.6 was more likely to be present in children being sent home from the ED compared to those admitted for supportive care (P = .003, data not shown). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that LDH originates from widespread airway epithelial cell injury and apoptosis 21, 22, 24 or from leukocytes (largely polymorphonuclear cells) 25 present in the NW fluid. The strong correlation between NW LDH, IL-8 and GM-CSF supports polymorphonuclear cells and other leukocytes as a source for LDH, while the near linear correlation with caspase 3/7 suggest apoptosis is contributing to NW LDH. A better understanding of the source of the NW LDH may provide additional information on the early innate mechanisms involved in virus-induced bronchiolitis.\n\nRSV is the major etiologic agent of bronchiolitis and our data reflect this fact with 66% of cases attributed to RSV. Intuitively, elevated concentrations of RSV should be closely linked to more severe bronchiolitis disease. Previous studies support this theory. [26] [27] [28] DeVincenzo et al analyzed 141 infants infected with RSV who were hospitalized during 4 winter seasons. Markers of disease severity included requirement for intensive care, respiratory failure, and duration of hospitalization. An increased NW RSV load was a significant independent predictor of all 3 markers of disease severity. 27 Buckingham et al 26 studied with RSV infection who were hospitalized. Mean NW concentrations were significantly higher in patients who required mechanical ventilation (5.06 \u00b1 0.34) compared to those who did not (3.91 \u00b1 0.35). In contrast, Wright et al 29 examined RSV titers in NW samples from 77 infants who were hospitalized with bronchiolitis, and did not find demonstrable correlation between viral titer and severity of illness. Martin et al 30 described patients with respiratory infection attributed to RSV where, after adjusting for age and the presence of comorbidities, the frequency of hospitalization decreased with each log increase in viral load (OR: 0.8 [95% CI: 0.7-0.997]; P = .047). The strong correlation we observed between NW LDH and RSV viral load (as quantified by real-time PCR) was not present when only infectious virus was assessed (P = .05) with the plaque assay (Fig 1A-C) . We attribute this discrepancy to the possible presence of RSV neutralizing antibodies in nasal secretions [disproved by Wright et al 29 ] or an increased precision of PCR over traditional methods [disproved by Bae et al 31 ].\n\nSignificant correlations were observed between NW LDH and various cytokines and chemokines, which may reflect the activation of parallel biological responses related to viral infection and innate and adaptive immune system activation. Aberrant Th2 immune responses 32 and mutations in genes involved in the innate immunity have been linked to RSV bronchiolitis susceptibility and severity. 33, 34 However, recent data suggest that cytokine levels do not necessarily correlate with disease presentation. 35 Welliver et al 24 showed that infants with fatal RSV lower respiratory tract disease succumbed to overwhelming viral infection and epithelial cell apoptosis and not to a cytokine storm. Lung sections were characterized by a paucity of lymphocytes and natural killer cells, unchecked viral replication, and apoptotic crisis. These recent studies support the concept of a protective effect derived from a robust innate immune response during an episode of RSV bronchiolitis, where inflammatory markers inversely correlate with disease severity. 15, 24, 35 To date there is no biochemical marker predictive of disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. In our study, the sensitivity and specificity of NW LDH for predicting hospitalization was 81% and 77%, respectively. These values are comparable to many of the point-of-care tests used in diagnosing a viral infection. The LDH assay is easy to perform, inexpensive, and available in most clinical laboratories. At our institution, the expected turnaround time for serum LDH is 1 hour, and NW samples should not be treated differently. Currently the presence of hypoxemia, significant respiratory distress and clinical judgment are the main consideration for determining the need to hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis. Having a validated biochemical marker predictive for hospitalization can provide another objective parameter to the physician, and would be valuable in difficult-toassess cases.\n\nA limitation of our study was that a single NW sample was obtained from each patient, and severity of disease was determined by the final disposition of the patient and the need for therapeutic interventions. Therefore, disease progression may have occurred in patients who were discharged from the hospital. The data were collected during a single season when RSV was most prevalent (and, therefore, having more weighted impact on the results), and originated from a single center. We recognize that repeat sampling and/or longer follow-up of these patients would strengthen the conclusions. Despite these limitations, our results were consistent for multiple clinical outcomes and support the validity of our conclusions.\n\nThis study is strengthened by our comprehensive effort to characterize viral agents and the assessment of the complex interplay between RSV concentration, the inflammatory response, patient age, and severity of bronchiolitis. In addition, we included children with mild to severe bronchiolitis in the ED setting which was critical for a more comprehensive analysis. Additional evaluation of our hypothesis is warranted and will add to a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of bronchiolitis.\n\nThe determination of LDH in NW has the potential of being a useful clinical biochemical marker of disease severity among children with bronchiolitis. Studies validating our observations will be needed before NW LDH can be incorporated into the clinical decision of whether to safely discharge from the hospital a young child presenting to the ED with mild to moderately severe bronchiolitis.
