The lysate was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 30 min to remove cell debris.\n\nThe supernatant was loaded onto a Ni 2+ -NTA agarose column (Qiagen). After washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl 2 and 20 mM imidazole, the SUMO moiety was cleaved by His-tagged SUMO protease(Ulp) at 16\u00b0C overnight. The elution was concentrated, and then changed into a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mM NaCl, and 4mM MgCl 2 . The sample was further purified using a Hitrap Q column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient from 40mM to 150 mM NaCl with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 4mM\n\nHcoV-EMC 3CL pro -2012.09.19 MgCl 2 . The target proteins were concentrated to 10 mg/mL in a buffer with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 4mM MgCl 2 for storage.\n\nThe N3 inhibitor was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, and then purified to >98% by HPLC. The purified HCoV-EMC 3CL pro and N3 inhibitor were mixed at 1:2 molar ratio and pretreated at 16 \u00b0C for 2 h before crystallization. \n\nThe diffraction data of the HCoV-EMC 3CL pro -N3 complex were collected to 2.27 \u00c5 resolution at 100 K using an ADSC Q270 CCD detector on the beamline BL17A of Photon Factory (PF, Japan) with a wavelength of 1.0000 \u00c5. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package [1]. The crystal belonged to the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with one HCoV-EMC 3CL pro dimer per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 47% [2] . The complex structure was determined using PHASER [3] with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (PDB code: 2AMQ) as the initial searching model. The presence of bound N3 molecules was initially revealed by the difference in the density map. Manual model construction and refinement were performed with COOT [4] and PHENIX HcoV-EMC 3CL pro -2012.09.19 [5] following rigid body refinement, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement. The quality of the final refined model was verified using the program PROCHECK [6] . The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1 .\n\nStructural figures were drawn using the program PyMOL [7] .\n\nThe activity of HCoV-EMC 3CL pro was measured by continuous kinetic "}
