{"title": "Genome-wide Prediction of microRNAs in Zika virus Genomes Reveals Possible Interactions with Human Genes Involved in the Nervous System Development", "body": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae, whose natural transmission cycle involves mainly vectors from the Aedes genus, while humans are occasional hosts [1] . Clinical manifestations of disease caused by ZIKV range from asymptomatic cases to an influenza-like syndrome associated to fever, headache, malaise and cutaneous rash [2] . ZIKV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 10,800 nt in length [3] . Although ZIKV enzootic activity was reported in diverse countries of Africa and Asia, few human cases were reported until 2007, when a large epidemic took place in Micronesia [4] . A large ZIKV outbreak occurred in French Polynesia during 2013-2014 and then spread to other Pacific islands [5] . In early 2015, a ZIKV epidemic outbreak took place in Brazil, currently estimated at 440,000-1,300,000 cases [6] . In November 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak [7] . Due to this global threat, World Health genes associated with microcephaly were downregulated in ZIKV-infected mice brains [14] and NPCs [11] . Multiple approaches will be needed to understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection [12] .\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory non-coding RNAs, ranging from 19 to 24 nucleotides in length, that post-transcriptionally regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the translation of mRNA transcripts or leading to their cleavage [15] . While encoded not only by cellular genomes but also by viral genomes [ \n\nIn this study, we used complete genome sequences of ZIKV strain Natal-RGN (GenBank accession number: KU527068), isolated in 2015, from the brain tissue of a fetus diagnosed with microcephaly [10] . VMir program [30] was used to analyze the ZIKV strain sequences. VMir is an ab initio prediction program specifically designed to identify pre-miRNA in viral genomes. Using this approach, ZIKV sequences were analyzed for possible pre-miRNA hairpin structures, using highly stringent filtering parameters (minimum hairpin size of 60 nucleotides, maximum hairpin size of 120 nucleotides, minimum hairpin score of 160, minimum window count of 25). VMir scores were calculated according to Grundhoof [30] .\n\nTo discriminate real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin structures (pseudo hairpins) we employed iMiRNA-SSF approach [31]. This approach represents an improvement in the performance for accurate identification of miRNA precursors by combining negative sets with different distributions [31].\n\nWith the purpose of extracting mature miRNA: miRNA* duplexes from pre-miRNA hairpins, we employed MiRduplexSVM [32] . This approach uses a novel SVM-based methodology and takes into account several aspects of the biogenesis of miRNAs, whereby a duplex is formed before the mature molecule is selected [32] .

Once downloaded, the sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program Table 1 .\n\nThe RNAfold web server [34] was used to predict the secondary structure of pre-miRNAs. Only default parameters were used.\n\nIn order to identify the regulatory relationships between predicted miRNAs and their putative target gene transcripts we employed miRTar [35] . The parameters assigned for the hybridization were set to \u221214 kcal/mol of minimum free energy (MFE) for all hybridizations as a cut-off value and an alignment score \u2265 140. We studied the relation between predicted miRNAs and their target gene transcripts focusing on human genes involved in microcephaly.

RNA hybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridization of a long and a short RNA and is widely used for miRNA target prediction. Pairing energy or minimum free energy (MFE)\n\nindicates the stability of the hybridization. A stringent condition was employed, with a MFE set at \u221230 kcal/mol for all hybridizations, as a cut-off value.\n\nComputational prediction represents a widely used and effective strategy to identify novel miRNAs that can be further examined and validated by experimental approaches.\n\nIn order to observe whether ZIKV genome could be folded into putative pre-miRNA stem-loop structures, we first analyzed its putative miRNA-encoding capacity using full-length sequences from Natal-RGN ZIKV genome (GenBank accession number: KU527068). We filtered VMir [30] output using stringent custom setting. The results of these studies revealed six pre-miRNA hairpins that were selected as potential hairpins and suggested the potential miRNA-coding capacity of the genome of this ZIKV strain.\n\nThen, in order to confirm the presence of these pre-miRNA structures, we classified them into real or pseudo pre-miRNAs by means of the iMiRNA-SSF approach [31].\n\nFour out of the six pre-miRNA structures (named MD1, MD13, MD17 and MD21)\n\n.

The results of these studies revealed that these predicted pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs sequences are highly conserved among ZIKV strains.\n\nIn order to comprehend the dynamics between viral miRNAs and their targets is The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We used very stringent conditions, with a MFE of -30 kcal/mol as a cut-off value for miRNA-target pairing.\n\nThe results of these studies are shown in Table 3 .\n\n.

All these microcephaly associated genes have been found to be downregulated in an in vivo mice model of ZIKV infection, leading to disruption of neural development and microcephaly [14] .\n\nIn this study, one of the predicted ZIKV miRNA (MD-21) is situated in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the ZIKV genome ( and tertiary structures conserved among members of the genus Flavivirus [45] , which makes it resistant to RNase degradation [46] . One of these SLs, the 3'SL located at the very end of the 3'UTR has been shown to be crucial for viral replication and interacts with a variety of proteins [47] . In order to gain insight into the location and possible functions of MD-21, the secondary structure of the 3'UTR of the consensus sequences obtained for ZIKV genomes included in these studies was established (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, we found that the pre-miRNA-MD21 is identical to flaviviruses 3'SL and contains the short 5'-ACAG-3' sequence in the top loop of the 3'SL, which is conserved among the members of this genus (see Fig. 2 ).\n\nRecent studies revealed the production of a miRNA (KUN-miR-1) from the 3'SL of the 3'UTR of WNV [27, 48] . Production of this miRNA was shown to be required for efficient WNV replication in mosquito cells. These studies also demonstrated that KUN-miR-1\n\nfunctions via up-regulation of the expression of transcription factor GATA4, which in turn is required to facilitate WNV replication in mosquito cells [27] . In order to observe if GATA4 may be a target for ZIKV-miR-MD21, we computationally calculated that hybridization (Table 4 ). The result of this analysis revealed that ZIKV-miR-MD21 has the capability to hybridize Aedes aegypti GATA4 (Table 4) .\n\n.

This is in agreement with the results of this work.\n\nHowever, the details of the mechanisms for the generation of these miRNAs and their potential functions in virus replication in invertebrates hosts will require further investigation\n\nThe results presented here suggest a possible role of miRNAs on the expression of human genes associated with microcephaly. Besides, they hint to candidate miRNAs that should be further confirmed by experimental analysis.\n\nThe results of this work revealed the miRNA coding capacity of the ZIKV genome, in agreement with a recent report [29] . In this study, using highly stringent conditions, four new miRNAs were found in the Natal-RGN ZIKV genome, which was isolated from the brain The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
