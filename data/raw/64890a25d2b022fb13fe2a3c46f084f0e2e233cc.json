{"title": "", "body": "Acute fi brinous and organising pneumonia (AFOP) was recently described as an unusual pattern of diffuse lung disease. Particular characteristics make the differential diagnosis with the well recognised clinical patterns of diffuse alveolar damage, cryptogenic organising pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia. The lack of hyaline membranes, the presence of intra-alveolar fi brin, absence of noticeable eosinophils and patchy distribution suggests that AFOP defi ne a distinct histological pattern. The authors describe the case of a woman diagnosed with AFOP after surgical lung biopsy, in association with primary biliary cirrhosis. The patient presented dyspnoea, fatigue, dry cough and thoracic pain. The CT scan showed bilateral patchy infi ltrates predominantly in the lower lobes. Flexible bronchoscopy and subsidiary techniques were inconclusive and biopsy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery led to anatomopathological diagnosis of AFOP. The patient is having a good clinical response to prednisone.\n\nInitial chest x-ray: right side opacity with alveolar characteristics.\n\nThe CT scan showed multiple bilateral opacities with preferential peribronchial distribution and alveolar characteristics. There were also areas of ground glass opacities ( fi gure 2 ).\n\nShe was a healthcare assistant, non-smoker and medicated for hypothyroidism and dyslipidaemia. No relevant clinical family history was identifi ed.\n\nDuring investigation, there was radiological worsening with enlargement and spread of lung opacifi cations ( fi gure 3 ) and rapid clinical deterioration.\n\nPulmonary auscultation revealed crepitations in bilateral lower zones, otherwise the physical examination was normal.\n\nLaboratory studies showed normal including white cell count, kidney function and urinalyses; sedimentation rate (85 mm/1 a h), C reactive protein (7.8 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (136 U/l) and c-glutamyl transferase (121 U/l) were elevated.\n\nInitial investigation was not diagnostic and further studies were done to confi rm or exclude possible infectious, infl ammatory and neoplastic causes.\n\nLung function tests with spirometry and lung volumes revealed normal and a slight decrease (63% of predicted value) in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. Arterial blood gases were normal.\n\nTumour markers (NSE, CYFRA 21.1, CEA, CA 125, CA 15.3, CA 19.9 e \u03b22), SACE and autoantibodies (ANA, ENA, ANCA) were within normal range except for AMA 640 U/ ml (>20) and anti-M2 67.5 U/ml (>7.0). Flexible bronchoscopy followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (TBB) was performed and revealed no endobronchial lesion. BAL specimen did not show any micro-organisms or malignant cells. The BAL differential cell count contained high levels of lymphocytes 62% (CD4/CD8 1.3), macrophages 20%, eosinophils 12% and neutrophils 5%. TBB histology revealed a 'BOOP-like' pattern.\n\nAs a defi nitive diagnosis was not reached, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed and lead to the pathological diagnosis of acute fi brinous and organising pneumonia (AFOP) with lymphoplasmocitary infl ammatory infi ltrate (no eosinophils) and fi broblast proliferation associated with type II pneumocytes hyperplasia. Oedema was presented in some alveolar spaces whereas others had numerous macrophages and fi brin balls. No evidence of hyaline membranes was observed ( fi gure 3 ).\n\nHepatic biopsy showed no abnormalities.\n\nThe treatment consisted of prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) with clinical, functional and radiological improvement ( fi gures 4 and 5 ). There were no side effects related to prednisone. At this time, nearly 14 months after beginning treatment, the patient is asymptomatic but still under treatment (tapering doses of prednisone). As we assumed, the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis because of the presence of AMA, an antibody highly specifi c, high levels of alkaline phosphatise and clinical association with hyperlipidaemia and hypothyroidism and ursodeoxycholic acid (13 mg/kg/day) was started.\n\nA positive clinical course was observed. The patient remains asymptomatic, 14 months after histological diagnosis, and resolution of CT images was achieved ( fi gure 5 ). She is observed regularly in the Pulmonology outpatient clinic.\n\nAFOP is an extremely rare pathologic entity that was initially described by Beasley et al 1 in 2002, in a review of 17 patients, as a new histological pattern of lung injury. Hwang et al, 2 in 2003, reported autopsy data from the lungs of 20 patients who died with severe acute respiratory syndrome and AFOP was identifi ed as the cause in six cases. In more recent published studies, Prahalad et al, 3 Damas et al, 4 Kobayashi et al 5 and Tzouvelekis et al 6 describe one case report of AFOP each. The fi rst describe an acute presentation in the context of an infl ammatory myopathy, and the others as a subacute presentation in an idiopathic form.\n\nTwo different clinical courses have been observed in AFOP 7 8 : a fulminant presentation often overlapping with acute respiratory distress syndrome and a more subacute Figure 4 Chest x-ray after 2 months of treatment. It has been reported that AFOP 8 may occur in an idiopathic context or in association with a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, including autoimmune disease, more often collagen vascular diseases (infl ammatory myopathy, juvenile dermatomyositis), adverse drug reactions (amiodarone), occupational or environmental exposures (construction work, coal mining, zoological work), as well as infections ( Haemophilus infl uenzae, Acinetobacter lymphomaairspray ). In this case, despite the percutaneous needle biopsies of the liver showed no abnormalities, the presence of AMA and biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on alkaline phosphatase elevation established the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. Hyperlipidaemia and hypothyroidism provided corroborative data. Therefore, it was made the diagnosis of AFOP in association with primary biliary cirrhosis. Although there is no clinical report describing this association, AFOP is a new entity that has only a few clinical cases reported, and autoimmune disease is an important and previously described association.\n\n\u25b6 AFOP is characterised by prominent intra-alveolar fi brin deposition (fi brin balls) resulting in a morphological pattern that may represent an underreported variant of diffuse alveolar damage, cryptogenic organising pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia. Dyspnoea and dry cough are the most common \u25b6 presenting symptoms. Two different outcomes have been observed: an acute \u25b6 form in which the patient rapidly progress to death; and a subacute form where the patient evolutes under treatment to recovery."}
