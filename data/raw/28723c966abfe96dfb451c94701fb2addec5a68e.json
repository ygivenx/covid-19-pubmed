{"title": "Intracellular Processing of the N-Terminal ORF la Proteins of the Coronavirus MHV-A59 Requires Multiple Proteolytic Events", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, contains the largest known viral RNA genome, a 31 -kb, nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA of positive polarity (Pachuk er al., 1989; Lee et a/., 1991) . The replication strategy of MHV includes the transcription of a full-length negative-strand RNA from the input genome RNA, as well as the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. The subgenomic mRNAs form a 3' coterminal (nested) set of seven RNAs (including genome length RNA) which extend varying distances in the 5' direction. It is thought that only the 5' most gene of each RNA is translated into protein. Gene 1 of MHV-JHM, a virus strain closely related to MHV A59, has been sequenced and found to be 2 1,798 nt in length (Lee eta/., 1991) . It contains two open reading frames, ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b, which overlap by 75 nt, with ORF 1 b in the -1 frame with respect to ORF la. A signal sequence present in this overlap region and a downstream pseudoknot formation can direct the ribosome to shift from the ORFl a to the ORFl b coding frame (Breedenbeek et a/., 1990; Lee et al., 1991) . Thus, gene 1 could potentially be translated into a polyprotein of >750 kDa.\n\nGene 1 most likely encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other functions necessary for coronavirus RNA replication. MHV, like other positivestrand RNA viruses, does not contain a polymerase activity within the virion and must translate it from the input genome RNA. It is postulated, also by analogy to other positive-strand RNA viruses, that gene 1 is translated soon after infection into proteins containing various activities necessary for transcription and replication. Consistent with this model, in vitro translation of genome RNA results in only gene 1 products being detected (Leibowitz eta/., 1982; Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Further, gene I of the murine coronaviruses A59 and JHM, as well as of the avian coronavirus, IBV, has been shown to contain sequence motifs predicting polymerase, helicase and nucleotide triphosphate binding activities (Boursnell eta/., 1987; Gorbalenya eT a/., 1989; Breedenbeek et a/., 1990; Lee et al., 1991) .\n\nGenome RNA of MHV has been translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, yielding a variety of polypeptides encoded in ORF I a, including the N-terminal products p28 and ~220, as well as ~250, a precursor of p28 and ~220. P250 is detected only in the presence of protease inhibitors (Leibowitzetal., 1982; Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Cleavage of ~28, the extreme N-terminal ORF la product, is a delayed event in vitro, requiring a precursor of at least 160 kDa to be translated before cleavage occurs (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Soe et al., 1987; Baker et a/., 1989) . The cleavage of p28 in vitro may be autoproteolytic, effected by a protease activity encoded in the first 3.9-5.3 kb of ORF 1 a (Baker et al., 1989) . More recent analyses indicates that this portion of MHV-JHM ORF la contains two distinct regions, predicted to encode papain-like proteases, and it has been suggested that one of these regions may be important in p28 cleavage (Baker et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) .\n\nIdentification of gene 1 products and characterization of their processing and respective functions has been difficult to achieve in MHV-infected cells, probably due to a lack of effective antibodies. None of the protease, polymerase, helicase or metal binding activities predicted by analysis of the gene 1 sequence have been detected in viva (Gorbalenya er a/., 1989; Lee et al., 1991; Denison et a/., 1991) . To this point the only gene I product identified in MHV-A59-infected cells has been ~28, which was detected at late times after infection by two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis (Denison and Perlman, 1987) . The kinetics and cleavage reaction of p28 in viva were not investigated in that report.\n\nIt is important to define the pattern of translation and processing of ORF 1 a, as well as the specificity of any cleavage events which may occur in order to better understand the number and type of proteases which may be active in coronavirus replication, as well as to characterize the polymerase activities. We have used antisera against proteins encoded in ORF 1 a to detect putative polymerase gene products. In this report we describe the intracellular synthesis and processing of p28 and other ORF la polypeptides in MHV-infected cells. We have characterized the kinetics of synthesis of these products, their precursor-product relationships and the sensitivities of the cleavage reactions to protease inhibitors. Our results suggest that the intracellular ORF 1 a products may be substantially different from those identified from in vitro translation of genome RNA, and that more than one protease activity may be necessary for the processing of ORF 1 a translation products.\n\nConfluent monolayers of DBT cells were infected with MHV-A59 in 60-mm petri dishes at an m.o.i. of IO PFU/cell in DMEM 2% FCS for 30 min at 37\". Excess virus and media were removed and the cells were incubated in DMEM without methionine (GIBCO) with 2% FCS for the remainder of the experiment. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was added to the media at 2 hr postinfection (pi) to a final concentration of 10 pg/ml. Polypeptides were labeled with [35S]methionine (Translabel-ICN) at a concentration of 200 $Zi/ml for periods as indicated in individual experiments. Label was added at 7.5 hr pi unless otherwise indicated. The duration of incubation with label varied by experiment, but generally I .5 to 2 hr gave maximum incorporation of label into in viral polypeptides.\n\nInitiation of translation was blocked by increasing the NaCl concentration in the overlying medium by 200 mM above that contained in DMEM (GIBCO), as described by Saborio et al. (1974) . Under usual conditions, the cells were incubated in the hypertonic NaCl for 30 min, before replacing the high salt medium with isotonic medium containing [35S]met.\n\nAt the times indicated in individual experiments, the media was removed and the cells were placed on ice, washed twice with 150 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, and swollen in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, for 30 set on ice. Following removal of the 10 mM Tris, the cells were lysed by the addition of 300 PI/plate (2.5 X 1 O6 cells) of a solution containing 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 150 mM NaCI, and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). Phosphonomethylsulfonylflorone (PMSF, Sigma) (80 pg/ml) was added to the lysis buffer immediately prior to use. After incubation on ice for 3 min and observation for complete lysis, lysates were frozen at -70\" until use.\n\nThe polyclonal anti-peptide serum ((~p28p) was raised in a rabbit against a 14 amino acid synthetic oligopeptide (amino acids 25 to 38 from the initiating methionine of JHM ORF 1 a), which is within the region coding for p28 (Table 1 ). In addition, polyclonal antisera directed against polypeptides encoded in the first 6.5 kb of ORF 1 a (antisera 81043 and 600A) were also utilized. These antisera were raised in rabbits using as an immunogens procaryotic/viral fusion proteins Denison et al., 1991) . The locations of the cDNAs encoding the fusion proteins used to raise these antisera are shown in Table 1 . The hybridoma cell line secreting antibodies against the S protein (JA3.10) was obtained from Dr. John Fleming at the University of Wisconsin. The hybridoma cell line, 1.16.1, secreting antibodies against N (nucleocapsid) was used as previously described (Denison et a/., 1991) . Antibodies were prepared for immunoprecipitation reactions by binding them to Protein A(PrA)-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in 1 ml of an immunoprecipitation buffer, identical to the lysis buffer but containing only 0.1% SDS (buffer B). For individual immunoprecipitation reactions, 5 ~1 of the polyclonal antisera or 50 ~1 of the monoclonal antisera were incubated with 30 ~1 of swollen PrA-Sepharose beads for 2 hr with rocking at 4\", followed by 3 washes in buffer B. lmmunoprecipitation of ORF 1 a translation products from whole cell lysates Whole cell lysates, prepared as described above, were thawed on ice and DNA was sheared by 10 passages through a 23-gauge needle. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\", and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube. Typically, 150 to 300 ~1 (1.25 to 2.5 X 1 O6 cells) was used for each immunoprecipitation reaction. Lysates were diluted to 1 ml in immunoprecipitation buffer, identical to the lysis buffer, but lacking SDS (buffer C), resulting in final SDS concentrations of 0.1%. Lysates were precleared with preimmune serum-armed beads (30 ~1 per reaction) for 2 hr at 4\", the beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube and incubated with PrA-Sepharose beads armed with specific antisera. Following the incubations, the supernatant was discarded and the beads were washed 4 times with alternating high and low salt rinses (buffer B containing either 150 mM or 1 M NaCI). After rinsing, 50 ~1 of 2X Laemmli buffer (Laemmli, 1970) was added to the pelleted beads, which was boiled for 5 min at 100\" prior to electrophoresis of the supernatant, usually on 5-l 8% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (gSDS-PAGE).\n\nln vitro translation of A59 genome RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate\n\nPurification of A59 genome RNA, translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, immunoprecipitation, and electro- a Antisera were directed against fusion proteins encoded by cDNAs from these regions of gene 1 of MHV-A59. The exact 5'end of 600A cDNA has not been determined. phoresis were all performed as previously described (Denison et al., 1991) .\n\nEstimates of molecular mass were derived by a modification of the method described by Lamblin (Lamblin and Fine, 1979; Lamblin, 1978; Lamblin et a/., 1976) . lmmunoprecipitation products were analyzed on 4-100/o polyacrylamide gels in the presence of increased bisacrylamide (30% T/3.80/0 C) using as standards nonreduced a2 macroglobulin, thyroglobulin, fibrinogen, and IgM, as well as high molecular weight standards (SDS-GH, Sigma). A regression curve of log MW vs log %T was derived from standards and used to estimate the molecular weight and error of ORF la products.\n\nlmmunoprecipitation of MHV-A59-infected cells with ORF la antisera A59-infected cells were labeled for 2 hr at late times of infection (6-8 hr). Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera (up28p, 81043, or 600A (see Materials and Methods) and also with monoclonal antibodies to structural proteins N ((YN) and S ((YS) (Fig. 1) . The nucleocapsid and spike proteins were easily detected at this time pi, consistent with the presence of virus-induced syncytia formation in the cell monolayer and increasing titers of MHV-A59 in the supernatant media. The polyclonal antiserum directed against a synthetic oligopeptide within the sequence coding for p28 ((~p28p) ( Table 1 ) precipitated a 28-kDa polypeptide, which migrated with the same mobility as p28 synthesized during in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA. The 28-kDa band which was detected in infected DBT cells was not precipitated by preimmune serum, LYN, or &, nor was any band of similar mobility detected by (-up28p cells. Antisera are as described in Table 1 (01p28p, 81043, and 600A). Controls include preimmune sera (Pre), Protein A-Sepharose beads without antibody (PrA), and anti-N (aN mAb) and anti-S (c&mAb) monoclonal antrbodres. Molecular mass markers are to the left of the gel and sizes of specific precipitation products are to the rrght of the gel, with arrows Indicating these products. long labeling period (2 hr) and the intensity of the label (200 &i/ml of [35S]met), only p28 was detected. No potential precursors to p28 were detected, with all larger bands being nonspecific products also precipitated by preimmune serum from infected and uninfected DBT cells. Neither antiserum 81043 nor 600A detected ~28. This was expected since they were directed against sequences encoded downstream of p28 (Table 1 , see also Fig. 6) , and indicated that none of the downstream ORF la products was a p28 containing precursor. This was in contrast to the results from in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA, in which p28-containing precursors from 160 to 250 kDa were easily detected by ap28p (Denison et al., 1991) . These results suggested that p28 was more rapidly cleaved in viva than in vitro.\n\nAntisera 81043 and 600A both detected major products with molecular masses of approximately 290 kDa (p290) and 240 kDa (~240) as well as a large, heterogeneous accumulation of radioactivity with electrophoretie mobility of greater than 400 kDa (Fig. 1) . The sizes of these proteins were determined as described under Materials and Methods, with a mean error of 10%. Antiserum 81043 detected a variety of smaller bands of approximately 168, 125, and 100 kDa. Neither cup28p nor 600A detected these polypeptides. Finally, anti-serum 81043 precipitated a polypeptide at 50 kDa (~50) which was not precipitated by cup28p. This product was variable in amount and migrated immediately above a nonspecific band between 46 and 50 kDa which was precipitated by all antisera utilized, including 81043 and 600A. P50 could only be detected as a discrete band by 8 1043 as is most clearly delineated in Figs. 3 and 5A. The detection of p50 by 81043 but not 600A suggested that p50 was either located 5'to ~240 or was a N-terminal cleavage product of a larger polyprotein spanned in part by 81043.\n\nTime of appearance of ORF la products DBT cells were infected at a high m.o.i. (50 PFU cell) at 4\" for 1 hr to ensure complete, synchronous, and single cycle infection and were labeled with [35S]Met in the presence of actinomycin D for serial 1.5-hr periods from 0 to 9 hr. Syncytia were first observed on the infected cell monolayer at 6 hr pi and progressed to 90-l 00% confluency by 8 hr pi. The first products specific to ORF la were contained in a diffuse region of increased incorporation at the top of the gel, immunoprecipitated by antiserum 81043 (Fig. 2B ). This heterogeneous band was also detected using antiserum 600A, but was not precipitated by aN, or (up28p (Figs. 2A and 2C) , nor by CUS (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that this was not nonspecific aggregation of structural proteins. By 3-4.5 hr pi, this heterogeneous band of >400 kDa had increased significantly, and ~28, p290, and ~240 were readily detected. One additional polypeptide of approximately 170 kDa was precipitated by c~p28p ( Fig. 2A, 4 .5-6 hr). This band was also precipitated by preimmune rabbit serum in infected cells, at the same time point and from the same lysate (Fig. 2D ), indicating that it was a nonspecifically precipitated product, possibly S, rather than a p28 containing precursor. Additionally, it was not seen at subsequent time points, nor in any other experiments using (up28p antisera. Nucleocapsid was also observed by 3-4.5 hr pi, well before the presence of virus-induced syncytia formation. All of the MHV-specific products increased in amount during subsequent labeling periods, until 7.5-9 hr pi, when the amount of precipitated products was diminished. At this latter labeling period there was decreased cell viability and loss of syncytia from the cell monolayer.\n\nPrecursor-product relationships of ORF 1 a products\n\nIn order to more completely define the precursorproduct relationships among the ORF la products, pulse chase labeling of infected DBT ceils was performed at late times of infection, when synthesis of ORF 1 a products was maximal (50-600/o of monolayer involved in syncytia formation). A59-infected cells were labeled with [35S]met for 20 min and then chased with excess cold methionine for O-l 20 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antisera (~p28p, 81043, or 600A (Fig. 3) . As in Figs. 1 and 2 , ap28p precipitated only p28 with no detectable precursors. The amount of p28 detected remained constant up to 120 min of chase, with no evidence of processing or degradation. All three antisera detected a band migrating at 278 kDa, just below the 290-kDa virus-specific ORF la product (Fig. 3, 15 min, 600A) . This was a nonspecifically precipitated cellular polypeptide, detected in infected and mock-infected cells by all antisera including preimmune serum (see also Fig. 1) . At the end of the 15-min labeling period (0 min lane), a majority of the labeled products precipitated by both 81043 and 600A were in the heterogeneous band of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa band was first detected by both antisera at 15 min of chase. Subsequently, the 240-and 50-kDa products were first detected at 30 min of chase. Antiserum 600A detected the 290-and 240-kDa products, but not the 50-kDa product, consistent with the results in Figs. 1 and 2 . The sizes of these products, as well as the late, simultaneous appearance of the 240-and 50-kDa products, suggested that they were derived from the 290-kDa polypeptide by a delayed cleavage reaction (50-90 min), with p50 as the amino terminal product and ~240 as the carboxy terminal. The 168-, 125-, and lOO-kDa polypeptides detected by 81043 appeared simultaneously at O-l 5 min, suggesting that they were products of premature translation, which were not processed.\n\nSince translation and processing of viral polypeptides were not synchronous at late times pi, intracellular translation of MHV RNA was synchronized with hypertonic NaCI, in order to confirm the kinetic relationship between the 28-, 290-, 240-, and 50-kDa ORFla products, (Fig. 4) . The presence of excess (200-220 mAY) NaCl has been shown to almost entirely block reinitiation of translation on mRNAs, without affecting polypeptide chain elongation or termination (Saborio et a/., 1974) . In both uninfected and A59-infected DBT cells, 200 mM excess NaCl was necessary to completely block incorporation of [35S]Met into cellular or viral polypeptides (Fig. 4A ). This block appeared to be complete within 10 min of addition of excess NaCI. When [35S] Met was added at the time when the hypertonic block was removed and isotonic conditions re- [35S]met was added to cells in an isotonrc media followrng the removal of medra containing 200 mM excess NaCl (Trme 0 min). and samples were taken for TCA-precipitable counts at the times indrcated, erther in the absence orthe presence of continued hypertontc NaCI.

Infected cells lysates were immunopreclprtated with antiserum 01~28~ (C)or 81043 (D). As a control, Infected cells were labeled for 90 min without hypertonic block (no block, -Bl) and rmmunoprecrpitated with erther np28p or 81043 In addrtron, mock-infected cells (mock) were subjected to hypertonic block as above and labeled for 90 min prior to lysis and rmmunopreciprtation wrth ~up28p, 81043. or preimmune rabbrt serum (Pre).

P28 was the only MHV product detected curred (Fig. 4B) . The cells where the hypertonic block by ap28p (Fig. 4C ). It was detected by 15 min after was maintained after addition of label showed no uprestoration of isotonic conditions, well before the much take during the entire labeling period. Based on these larger, 8 1043 precipitated heterogeneous band of initial experiments, 200 mNI NaCl was added to the ~400 kDa, which was first seen after 30 minutes of overlying media for 30 min, after which the hypertonic labeling (Fig. 4D) . Although our preliminary experimedia was removed and the cells were labeled in isoments demonstrated a lag period before incorporation tonic media for Increasing periods of time, prior to lysis, of label recommenced, it was clear that no p28 con-taining precursors were present even in conditions of synchronous translation, supporting the conclusion that p28 was cleaved prior to the synthesis of the downstream ORF la products. This was in marked contrast to our results from immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled in vitro translation products of genome RNA, in which polypeptides of 60-220 kDa accumulated for up to 45 min before the first appearance of p28 (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison et al., 1991) .\n\nFollowing accumulation of label into the heterogeneous band of greater than 400 kDa at 30 min of label, the 290-kDa band appeared abruptly at 60 min, followed by the simultaneous appearance of the 240-and 50-kDa products by 90 min (Fig. 4D) . These data suggested that the 290-kDa product was also a late cleavage product of a larger precursor. p290 then required up to an additional 30 min for secondary cleavage into products of 240 and 50 kDa. The other virus specific polypeptides at 168, 125, and 100 kDa again gradually accumulated during the pulse-labeling period, butdemonstrated no detectable precursor-product relationships, in agreement with the results of the nonsynchronized translation.\n\nThe proteolytic cleavage patterns of ORF la products were assessed by adding the protease inhibitor leupeptin to the infected cells at late times pi, but prior to the addition of [35S]Met label (Fig. 5A) . Leupeptin, a low molecular weight (455 Da) reversible inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, as well as some cysteine proteases, effectively blocks the proteolytic cleavage of p28 during in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA at concentrations of l-2 mM (Denison and Perlman, 1986) . Leupeptin has been shown to penetrate intact cells (Appleyard and Tisdale, 1985) . MHVA59-infected DBT cells were labeled in media containing 2 mM leupeptin followed by immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum, c~p28p, 81043, or 600A. The cleavage of p28 in viva was not inhibited by the presence of up to 2 mM leupeptin in the media. These results differed substantially from those obtained in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in which the cleavage of p28 from its precursors was almost completely inhibited by 2 mM leupeptin (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison et al., 1991) , resulting in increased detection of p28-containing precursors, specifically ~250. In contrast, the 240and 50-kDa bands precipitated by 81043 in the absence of leupeptin were not detected when ORF la products were labeled in the presence of leupeptin. An identical pattern was observed in the products precipi-tated by 600A, with the exception that the 50-kDa product was not detected by this antibody under any circumstances. In addition, the 290-kDa band was significantly more dense in the presence of leupeptin as detected by both antibodies, as would be expected if its cleavage into products of 240 and 50 kDa were prevented. Finally, the 168-, 125-, and 1 00-kDa products were not altered in electrophoretic mobility nor relative amount detected by the addition of leupeptin to the cells, supporting the conclusion that these were minor products derived from premature termination of translation rather than post-translational cleavage. Since the cleavages of p28 and the 290-kDa product were not detectably inhibited by leupeptin, the experiment was repeated, instead using E64 (Sigma), a specific, irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor, and also using ZnCI,, which completely inhibits p28 cleavage in vitro at 1 mM concentrations (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Denison and Perlman, 1987) . E64 had no detectable effect on the proteolytic processing of any of the identified ORF la products (data not shown), even though it is a small MW inhibitor and has been shown to be able to penetrate cells (Gordon and Seglen, 1989) . It is not clear whether this lack of inhibition was the result of insensitivity of the protease activities to E64 or was due to insufficient intracellular concentrations. Zinc chloride had a very low working concentration range in the media, with 0.05 mM producing no inhibition of cleavages of the ORF 1 a products and 0.2 mM causing visible toxicity to the cell monolayer and almost complete inhibition of translation of MHV polypeptides. At a ZnCI, media concentration of 0.1 mM, there was a decrease in detectable ~28, as well as the appearance of a new band of >320 kDa (Fig. 5B) . A polypeptide of identical mobility was also detected by antisera 81043 and 600A in the presence of 0.1 m&I ZnCI,, the only band which was detected by all three antisera, suggesting that ZnCI, to a limited extent inhibited the cleavage of p28 from the growing polyprotein precursor, resulting in a product which contained epitopes recognized by each of the three antisera.\n\nThis report represents the first description of the processing of p28 in MHV-infected cells, as well as the first description of intracellular ORF la products encoded downstream of ~28. ORF 1 a products were easily detectable by 3 hr pi and continued to be synthesized throughout the infectious cycle in increasing amounts until late in infection, when there was a diminution of the amounts detected. Gene 1, ORF 1 a products should be the first proteins synthesized after uncoating of the virion RNA in the cytoplasm, and the failure to detect them prior to 1.5 hr pi was probably due to the low copy number of input genome RNA avail- Preimmune serum (Pre) was used as a control. Predicted molecular masses of specific ORF 1 a products are to the right of the gel, with arrows indicating the respective bands. Molecular mass markers are to the left of the gel. (8) Infected cells were labeled with [%lmet in the absence (-) or presence (+) 0.1 mn/l zinc chloride. Lysates were precrprtated with antisera (~p28p, 81043, or 600A as indicated above groups of lanes. Specific ORF 1 a products are Indicated. Bold arrowheads indicate product of 320-350 kDa seen in the oresence of zinc chloride. able for translation. These data suggest a model in which small amount of ORF la gene products are translated from input genome RNA until 1.5-3 hr pi, when copies of genome RNA begin to be transcribed and become available as templates for translation of ORF 1 a products, allowing much greater quantities to be produced. This model is supported by the fact that nucleocapsid protein, the product of subgenomic mRNA 7, demonstrated similar kinetics of appearance. A model of translation of ORF 1 a products from progeny genome RNA is also supported by studies which have demonstrated that continuous cfe nova protein synthesis is necessary for efficient RNA synthesis during virus replication (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986; Perlman et al., 1987) . It is also possible that the increased detection late in infection of all ORF 1 a products may have been partially the result of intracellular accumulation, since it was demonstrated that all of the polypeptides were stable for at least 2 hr. The terminal diminution in amounts detected probably resulted from loss of cell numbers and viability late in infection, since at that time 100% of cells were involved in syncytia and were beginning to be lost from the plate.\n\nData from in vitro translation of MHV-JHM ORF la transcripts indicate that p28 is cleaved in vitro by a cis-autoproteolytic mechanism (Baker et a/., 1989) . We were unable to analyze the initial cleavage events in infected cells, since at earliest times pi the quantity of ORF 1 a products present was below the level of detection by the available antisera. It is therefore quite possible that the cleavage of p28 in A59-infected cells at very early times pi may occur by an autoproteolytic mechanism similar to that described during in vitro translation. However, the data presented here indicate that intracellular processing of p28 at late times pi may be effected by an additional or alternative mechanism. We detected no p28containing products of 140 to 180 kDa, in viva, which would be necessary to span the predicted papain-like protease regions (Lee et a/., 1991) . The antiserum crp28p detected only p28 under all conditions of labeling and immunoprecipitation utilized, supporting the conclusion that early, rapid cleavage of p28 was the predominant method of genesis late in infection. In contrast, the processing of p28 from larger N-terminal precursors is easily detected in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system, in which p28 is clearly not cleaved in vitro until at least 160 kDa of protein has been synthesized (Denison and Perlman, 1986; Soe et a/., 1987; Baker et al., 1989) . We were able to detect in vitro all p28containing precursors up to 250 kDa utilizing cup28p and thus do not believe that epitope masking could account for the lack of p28 containing-precursors in vivo in our experiments.\n\nAnother difference between the processing of p28 in vitro and in viva was the sensitivity of its cleavage reaction to inhibition by protease inhibitors. During the in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA, the cleavage of p28 is sensitive to inhibition by leupeptin, with essentially complete inhibition of proteolysis occurring at 2-mM concentrations. In contrast, the cleavage of p28 in infected cells was unaffected by leupeptin, even though leupeptin was clearly able to penetrate cells and inhibit the cleavage of other ORF 1 a precursor polypeptides. Both of the predicted papain protease activities, as well as a predicted 3C-like protease in ORF 1 a of JHM, are postulated to be cysteine proteases, which should be inhibited by leupeptin or E64. There is not yet enough data to determine whether this rapid cleavage of p28 resulted from intramolecular self-cleavage of ~28, such as that described in several of the nonstructural proteins of the picornaviruses (Krausslich and Wimmer, 1988; Palmenburg, 1990 ) from one of the described ORF 1 a cis-protease activities (Baker et a/., 1989) which may be acting in Vans within the infected cell, or from an as yet unrecognized viral or cellular transacting protease.\n\nSynthesis and processing of ORF la products downstream from p28\n\nThe products of ORF la in A59-infected DBT cells appear to be derived from a large polyprotein precursor through at least three independent proteolytic events (Fig. 6 ). The first event was the cleavage of p28 from the growing polypeptide chain. Translation on the genome RNA template continued with the synthesis of a variety of products greater than 400 kDa in size. It is not clear whether these large precursors terminated at the end of ORF 1 a or were composed of ORF 1 a-lb fusion polypeptides. It is possible that both were present, based on the demonstrated efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting in the coronaviruses (Brierley et a/., 1987; Breedenbeek et a/., 1990; Lee et a/., 1991) . The probability that ORFl a-l b fusion protein precursors are synthesized is also supported by the fact that up to 60 min of labeling was required for discrete ORFl a products other than p28 to be detected, which was ample time for translation of almost the entirety of ORFl a and ORFl b. The polyprotein was cleaved at 45-60 min into a primary product of 290 kDa. This primary cleavage product was subsequently proteolyzed into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa.\n\nSuch hierarchical proteolytic patterns have been well described both for the alphaviruses (de Groot et a/., 1990) and the picornaviruses. Analysis of the JHM ORF la sequence does not predict any regions with similarity to the conserved alphavirus cleavage sites [G, (A, C, G), (A, G, Y)] which could account for the ORF 1 a products identified. However, there are several regions of the ORF 1 a sequence with similarity to known picornavirus 3C protease substrate sites. One of these sites, the lys-arg (KR) at aa 3160-3161, was previously described as a potential cleavage site for the putative 3C-like protease activity in ORF 1 a (Lee et a/., 1991) . A polypeptide extending from the predicted C terminus of p28 to the KR dipeptide at 3160 would have a mass of approximately 323 kDa. This is substantially larger than the 290-kDa polypeptide actually precipitated by antisera 81,043 and 600A and suggests that either p290 is cleaved at a more 5' cleavage site or that an additional cleavage product exists between p28 and ~50, which cannot be detected by the antisera utilized (Fig. 6 ). This latter possibility is supported by the fact that for p50 to be detected by 8 1043, its carboxy terminus would have to extend beyond aa889, thus leaving a gap of approximately 30-60 kDa between the C terminus of p28 and the N terminus of ~50. We speculate that a product of this size may be the first product cleaved from the polyprotein chain of greater than 400 kDa, after the cleavage of p28 but prior to the cleavage of p290.\n\nThe specific proteases responsible for the intracellular cleavages of ORF la polyprotein precursors have not been identified, but several predictions can be made based on the ORF la sequence, the kinetics of synthesis and processing of ORF la, and the demonstrated sensitivities of the proteolytic events to inhibitors. The cleavage of p290 from a precursor polyprotein was a delayed event even at late times of infection, suggesting that it may have occurred by an intramolecular or cis proteolytic activity. It is reasonable to postulate that cis proteolysis by the predicted 3C-like protease may have been responsible for the cleavage into p290, since it resides between aa and 3652 of ORF 1 a, and since greater than 400 kDa of polypeptide was translated before the cleavage occurs in the infected cell. The same reasoning applies to the late cleavage of p290 into p50 and ~240, with the exception that this cleavage was quite susceptible to inhibition by leupeptin, suggesting that either an entirely different protease may have been responsible for this delayed cleavage, or that a conformational change may have been necessary before cleavage could occur.\n\nIntracellular translation and processing of ORF la products appears to differ from that which occurs during in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, where the major N-terminal ORF la products were ~28, ~220, and ~250 (Denison and Perlman, 1986 6. Suggested model of ORFl a translation and processing in MHV A59-infected cells. The size of ORF 1 a, the sequences spanned by the antisera (8 1043 and 600A), the predicted sizes of the proteins, and the possible cleavage sites are all shown to scale. General alignment of polypeptides is based on antisera specificity and has not been confirmed by protein sequencing, and thus the exact relationships must be considered speculative. The filled triangles and amino acid dipeptides (tyr-gly, lys-arg) indicate previously reported potential ORF 1 a cleavage sites which could account for products of the szes identified. Nonfilled triangles indicate possible cleavage sites for which no dipeptides have been suggested in the literature. None of these cleavage sites has been experimentally confirmed. The times required for the individual cleavages to occur are shown to the left of the diagram. The kinetics of the >320-kDa band, seen by all three anttsera only in the presence of protease inhibltor, has not been determined. The hatched rectangle adjacent to p290 Indicates a postulated product of 30-60 kDa, which was not Identified by the antisera In this study (see Dtscusslon). of poliovirus the difference in intracellular and in vitro synthesis is attributable to internal initiation of translation in the in vitro system (Dorner et al., 1984) . This does not appear to be the case with MHV, since initiation of ORF 1 a translation appears to be primarily N-terminal in vitro. The reason for the difference in the pattern of ORF 1 a polypeptide synthesis in vitro and in viva is not yet clear. In order to more effectively elucidate the differences, we are performing in vitro translation using lysates derived from cells permissive for MHV replication."}
