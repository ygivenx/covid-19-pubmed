{"title": "Masters of manipulation: Viral modulation of the immunological synapse", "body": "The adaptive immune response is essential for the control of pathogen invasion and is regulated by co\u2010ordinated communication between immune cells. This contact is directed either via membrane\u2010bound receptors or via the secretion of cytokines and lytic granules in response to chemokines on the surface of antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs). The interaction has been termed the immunological synapse (IS), a specialised zone of contact between two immune cells to allow the exchange of materials. Synapses can be formed between two cells, T\u2010cell\u2013T\u2010cell (Dustin et al., 1998; Monks, Freiberg, Kupfer, Sciaky, & Kupfer, 1998), T\u2010cell\u2013B\u2010cell (Batista, Iber, & Neuberger, 2001), and APC\u2013T\u2010cell (Grakoui et al., 1999); however, the majority of work has centred on the latter. Numerous viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus, and herpesvirus have evolved to express viral proteins that specifically target components of the IS with particular emphasis on the T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) signalling cascade and lymphocyte function\u2010associated antigen 1 (LFA\u20101) clustering, both essential for IS formation.\n\nClassically, viruses initiate contact with a host cell via attachment to a specific receptor on the target cell surface, initiating viral uptake, viral replication, and the production of progeny virus for onward release. Some T\u2010lymphotropic viruses have developed a strategy to form a stable adhesive junction between an infected cell (effector) and uninfected cell (target), termed a virological synapse (VS). No fusion events take place between the cells; instead, a junction is formed to transfer intact viral particles or genetic material. This process is termed trans\u2010infection (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) and has been found to be significantly more efficient than infection via cell\u2010free virus in vitro (Sourisseau, Sol\u2010Foulon, Porrot, Blanchet, & Schwartz, 2007). HIV\u20101 and human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) are two examples of viruses that trigger the polarisation of cellular machinery and cytoskeleton to form the VS at the cellular interface (Igakura et al., 2003; Jolly, Mitar, & Sattentau, 2007). Transmission of virus from cell to cell in this manner allows the efficient infection of target cells without exposure to the immune system.\n\nIn this review, we discuss the methods used by viruses to modulate host cellular machinery and signalling cascades to create a balance between rapid viral replication and establishment of latency. We go on to detail how HIV\u20101 and HTLV\u20101 use the VS to transfer virus cell to cell and the importance of this in vivo and briefly look at how other viruses may use similar methods of cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread.\n\nHIV\u20101 and primate simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) genomes encode several accessory proteins (nef, vif, vpu, vpr, and, in the case of SIV, vpx). Vif, vpu, vpr, and vpx are linked to the subfamily of ubiquitin ligases and induce the proteosomal degradation of cellular restriction factors, suppressing antiviral activity to allow efficient viral propagation and release. Nef is a key viral protein that is expressed in early infection and determines viral pathogenicity in vivo (Kestler et al., 1991).\n\nNef has been found to regulate several aspects of the host cell including the intracellular trafficking and downregulation of cellular surface proteins. CD4 (Piguet et al., 1999), CCR5 (Michel, Allespach, Venzke, Fackler, & Keppler, 2005), major histocompatibility complex I and II (Piguet et al., 2000), CD28 (Swigut, Shohdy, & Skowronski, 2001), and SERINCs (Rosa et al., 2015; Usami, Wu, & Gottlinger, 2015) are downregulated, whereas dendritic cell\u2010specific ICAM grabbing non\u2010integrin (DC\u2010SIGN) is upregulated (Sol\u2010Foulon et al., 2002). However, LFA\u20101, ICAM\u20101, and ICAM\u20102 appear to remain unaffected (Thoulouze et al., 2006). This approach allows HIV\u20101 to remain hidden in infected cells by controlling how the cell communicates with the rest of the immune system. An additional advantage to the downmodulation of the expression of viral receptors on the cell surface, such as CD4, helps prevent subsequent reinfection with a closely related viral strain, avoiding \u201csuperinfection\u201d of the cell (reviewed in Nethe, Berkhout, & van der Kuyl, 2005).\n\nNef also targets intracellular signalling and protein trafficking pathways by interacting with various components of the TCR signalling cascade such as Vav\u20101 (Fackler, Luo, Geyer, Alberts, & Peterlin, 1999), Erk (Schrager, Der Minassian, & Marsh, 2002), PAK\u20102 (Renkema, Manninen, Mann, Harris, & Saksela, 1999), and PK\u03b8 (Smith, Krushelnycky, Mochly\u2010Rosen, & Berg, 1996). The impeded trafficking of TCR receptor from the cell surface leads to retention in recycling endosomes along with Lck (Thoulouze et al., 2006). In conjunction with downregulation of CD4 and CD28 (Brady, Pennington, Miles, & Dzierzak, 1993; Swigut et al., 2001) and Nef's ability to disassociate CD4 from Lck and target it for degradation (Kim, Chang, Kwon, & Rhee, 1999), the targeted attack on TCR signalling reduces clustering at the IS and results in inefficient IS formation.\n\nNef is also an important regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, through interactions with the GTPase exchange factor Vav1, prompting cytoskeleton rearrangements and activation of c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase/stress\u2010activated protein kinase cascade (Fackler et al., 1999). Furthermore, Nef interacts with PAK\u20102 inhibiting the activity of neural Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome protein and Rac\u20101, both regulators of actin polymerisation and T\u2010cell activation (Haller et al., 2006).\n\nHIV has developed multiple strategies to alter receptor expression, signalling pathways, and cytoskeleton rearrangements resulting in the inefficient formation of the IS. Nonpathogenic SIV is a prime example of how an efficient block to T\u2010cell activation promotes viral persistence through immune evasion. SIV Nef disrupts the formation of IS between APC and T\u2010cells through the efficient downregulation of TCR and CD28, therefore blocking T\u2010cell responses to virally infected cells and avoiding apoptosis. In the case of HIV\u20101, some studies suggest Nef is less efficient at preventing IS formation due to a weaker downregulation of TCR and CD28 resulting in increased levels of T\u2010cell activation and apoptosis (Arhel et al., 2009). Thus, successfully blocking T\u2010cell activation reduces viral replication permitting prolonged viral production and persistence within the host, whereas failure to actively control T\u2010cell activation increases replication ultimately resulting in increased pathogenicity and disease progression.\n\nThe paramyxovirus human respiratory syncytial virus is a causative agent of respiratory infections worldwide. The nonstructural genes carried by the virus control dendritic cell (DC) maturation and reduce antigen presentation to T\u2010cells. The N protein is transported to the cell surface of the APC where it interacts in trans with TCR molecules. This interaction is believed to inhibit T\u2010cell activation by downregulating TCR signalling and pMHC clustering resulting in inhibition of IS formation, reviewed by Canedo\u2010Marroquin et al. (2017).\n\nHTLV\u20101 has the ability to control T\u2010cell activation for its own requirements. The HTLV protein P12I expressed in early infection is capable of inducing T\u2010cell activation by the activating transcription activator nuclear factor of activated T\u2010cells and interleukin\u20102 production (Albrecht et al., 2002; Ding et al., 2002, 2003; Kim, Ding, Albrecht, Green, & Lairmore, 2003). In addition, viral protein Tax is able to bypass TCR signalling and activate CD28, CD69, and CD5 expression (Chlichlia et al., 1995) promoting T\u2010cell activation. Conversely, HTLV\u20101 reduces TCR cell\u2010surface expression via downregulation of TCR genes (de Waal Malefyt et al., 1990) and similarly blocks transcription of Lck (Koga et al., 1989), thus controlling IS formation and activation of T\u2010cells.\n\nHerpes viruses establish lifelong latent infections in host cells. Human herpes virus (HHV) 6 and HHV7 are able to subvert TCR signalling and intracellular trafficking of receptors TCR and CD4 but do not affect levels of Lck (Furukawa, Itoh, Krueger, Streuli, & Saito, 1994; Secchiero et al., 1997). This activity has been attributed to HHV6 U24, which blocks TCR receptors access to recycling endosomes (Sullivan & Coscoy, 2008) and therefore prevents recycling back to the cell surface. Similarly, herpes simplex virus has also developed strategies to remodel TCR signalling to selectively activate TCR pathways. Herpes simplex virus ORF5 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation and able to interact with SH2 signalling proteins including Lck, which in turn activates TCR signal transduction to promote gene expression and persistent infection (Lee et al., 2004).\n\nHerpes samari (HVS) is an oncogenic simian gamma 2 herpesvirus able to immortalise human T\u2010lymphocytes. HVS has multiple viral proteins aimed at TCR signalling inhibition. The viral protein Tip (tyrosine kinase\u2010interacting protein) interacts with Lck and sequesters it along with TCR and LFA\u20101 in vesicular compartments (Cho et al., 2004, 2006; Jung et al., 1995; Park et al., 2003). Moreover, Tip interaction with the lysosomal protein p80 results in the degradation of the sequestered Lck (Park et al., 2002), preventing downstream signalling events. Tip is also responsible for the downregulation of CD4 and TCR at the cell surface (Cho et al., 2006; Park et al., 2003), interfering with TCR signalling cascade and IS formation (Cho et al., 2004).\n\nNumerous other viruses have been reported to modulate the TCR signalling pathway to strike a balance between prompting replication and evading detection in the host. To date, these include measles, hepatitis C, vaccinia virus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). For example, DC infected by measles virus have been found to form unstable IS with T\u2010cells (Shishkova, Harms, Krohne, Avota, & Schneider\u2010Schaulies, 2007). Through the MV and F/H complex, T\u2010cell activation is suppressed (Dubois, Lamy, Chemin, Lachaux, & Kaiserlian, 2001), and actin remodelling, T\u2010cell polarisation, and TCR clustering are inhibited at the IS (Muller et al., 2006; Niewiesk et al., 1999; Shishkova et al., 2007). Similarly, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is reported to downregulate TCR in peripheral T\u2010lymphocytes (Maki et al., 2003), vaccinia virus VH1 protein can block TCR activation of the interleukin\u20102 promoter (Alonso et al., 2002), whereas EBV latent membrane protein LMP2A can bind to Lck, Fyn, and ZAP\u201070 downregulating TCR and attenuated TCR signalling (Katzman & Longnecker, 2004), reviewed in Jerome (2008).\n\nViruses have dedicated multiple specialised proteins to the modulation of TCR signalling showing how integral the IS is in pathogen recognition and killing. For many T\u2010lymphotropic and APC viruses, it is essential to replicate efficiently and rapidly but go undetected by the host immune system. These two requirements have evolved into controlled modulation of components of the IS and downstream T\u2010cell activation. Viruses such as those mentioned strike this perfect balance, increasing T\u2010cell activation at low levels to aid infection and replication while preventing TCR signalling and complete T\u2010cell activation, to prevent overexpression of viral proteins and apoptosis of the host cell.\n\nThe VS is a transient, dynamic structure that forms upon recognition by the HIV glycoprotein gp120 expressed in the effector cell by the surface receptor CD4 on the target T\u2010cell. The interaction results in the recruitment of the viral Gag polyprotein to the contact site (Jolly et al., 2007) potentially through an interaction with the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli protein that directly binds HIV\u20101 Gag, not only regulating the localization of viral components for HIV\u20101 assembly but also enhancing the VS cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of HIV\u20101 (Miyakawa et al., 2017). This in turn triggers the recruitment of the HIV coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 along with cellular adhesion molecules ICAM\u20101 and LFA\u20101 to the VS. Tetraspanins and other surface proteins help form a stable VS to aid viral transmission (Jolly et al., 2004; Jolly & Sattentau, 2007; Starling & Jolly, 2016). The gp120 interaction with CD4 also induces cytoskeleton rearrangements and remodels the actin cytoskeleton, and LFA\u20101 induces the polarisation of the MTOC to the interface in the infected T\u2010cell (Jolly et al., 2007; Starling & Jolly, 2016). Jolly et al. (2004) observed recruitment of CD4, CXCR4, talin, actin, and LFA\u20101 on the target cell when cocultured with infected T\u2010cells. At the same time, the recruitment of viral Env and Gag to the VS in the infected cell with actin concentrated at the intersection was seen (Figure 1b). More recently, a phosphoproteomic approach to analyse mixed populations of infected and uninfected T\u2010cells identified over 200 cellular proteins involved in viral transfer. Despite the lack of antigen stimulation, TCR signalling was identified as the most activated pathway in both infected and uninfected T\u2010cells. It was concluded that activation of TCR, Lck, and Zap70 in infected T\u2010cells mediated by Env was essential for viral transfer to target T\u2010cells (Len, Starling, Shivkumar, & Jolly, 2017).\n\nThe transmission of virus is thought to be instigated by direct budding of virions from infected to uninfected cells in the synaptic cleft and the probable fusion of virions with the plasma membrane of the target cell (Deschambeault et al., 1999; Fais et al., 1995; Pearce\u2010Pratt, Malamud, & Phillips, 1994; Figure 1b). After the transfer to the recipient cell immature virus has been found to accumulate in endocytic compartments of the target T\u2010cells leading to maturation of virions and viral membrane fusion, concealing the virus from detection by neutralising antibodies (Dale et al., 2011).\n\nDCs reside in the mucosal tissues and include several subpopulations, including Langerhans (LC) and myeloid DC. DC's main role is to interact with and present pathogen\u2010derived antigens to the adaptive immune system. These APC cells are perfectly positioned to encounter HIV in early sexual transmission (Zaitseva et al., 1997). Indeed, a subset of vaginal epithelial DCs appear to be important for viral selection during the initial stages of infection as they preferentially replicate CCR5 viruses over CXCR4 and were found to be an important reservoir of infection in vivo (Pena\u2010Cruz et al., 2018). Exposure to pathogens results in stimulus of DCs and their subsequent maturation and migration to lymphoid tissue where they interact with antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cells, leading to T\u2010cell activation.\n\nHIV\u20101 is able to infect DC; however, infection levels are much lower than in CD4+ T\u2010cells. DCs possess several restriction factors to discourage replication, such as dNTP triphosphatase SAMHDI (Berger et al., 2011; Hrecka et al., 2011; Laguette et al., 2011; Ryoo et al., 2014). Interestingly, this is not the case for LC; instead, the cytokine transforming growth factor \u03b2 signalling pathway is able to potently restrict replication at the transcriptional stage (Czubala et al., 2016). Uptake in immature DC (iDC) is mediated via attachment to CD4, coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5 and the c\u2010type lectin DC\u2010SIGN (Arrighi et al., 2004; Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), whereas LCs use alternative c\u2010type lectin, langerin (Hu et al., 2004; Turville et al., 2002). After entry into DC, the transfer to target T\u2010cells can occur by two main routes. Firstly, cis\u2010infection tends to occur in iDC and involves the productive replication and release of progeny virus. The second is trans\u2010infection where DCs capture virions; however, productive infection is absent, and whole intact viral particles are trafficked to T\u2010cells via a VS (Garcia, Nikolic, & Piguet, 2008; Piguet & Steinman, 2007). Trans\u2010infection is associated with mature DC (mDC). Attachment to DC\u2010SIGN allows virus to remain infectious for prolonged periods of time in DC (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000) despite the fact that DCs have a highly developed endolysosomal pathway (Blauvelt et al., 1997; Turville et al., 2004). This may at least in part be attributed to the SNARE\u2010associated protein Snapin downregulating toll\u2010like receptor 8 signalling in infected DC endosomes (Khatamzas et al., 2017). Instead, virus is sequestered in endosomal\u2010derived compartments upon maturation (Garcia et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2017). Compartments are found to be rich in tetraspanins such as CD81, CD82, CD9, and CD63 but absent for lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Garcia et al., 2008, Wang, Eng, et al., 2017). In\u2010depth imaging studies have revealed these to be continuous with the cell membrane (Bennett et al., 2009; Mlcochova, Pelchen\u2010Matthews, & Marsh, 2013; Nkwe, Pelchen\u2010Matthews, Burden, Collinson, & Marsh, 2016), at least in the case of macrophages.\n\nUpon contact of the DC with T\u2010cell, the enrichment of HIV near the cell surface allows formation of VS (McDonald et al., 2003). Engagement of sialoadhesin CD169 (Siglec\u20101) expressed on the surface of mDC with the ganglioside GM\u20103 contained in the viral membrane triggers relocation to the cell periphery to initiate VS formation (Izquierdo\u2010Useros et al., 2012; Izquierdo\u2010Useros et al., 2012; Puryear et al., 2013; Puryear & Gummuluru, 2013; Puryear, Yu, Ramirez, Reinhard, & Gummuluru, 2012). It has been recently reported that the interaction of these molecules alone is enough to initiate VS formation (Yu et al., 2015). In DC, there is an enrichment of tetraspanins, actin, and ICAM\u20101 at the contact site, whereas adhesion molecule LFA1 and HIV receptors CD4 CXCR4/CCR5 concentrate at the surface on the T\u2010cell side (Cavrois, Neidleman, Kreisberg, & Greene, 2007; Felts et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2005; Geijtenbeek et al., 2000; Turville, Aravantinou, Stossel, Romani, & Robbiani, 2008; Yu, Reuter, & McDonald, 2008; Figure 1c). Disruption of actin remodelling and microtubules with inhibitors has been shown to prevent VS formation highlighting the importance of the role of the actin cytoskeleton in VS formation (Felts et al., 2010; Menager & Littman, 2016; Nikolic et al., 2011).\n\nImaging of the VS has revealed the presence of extensive filopodial extensions extending from CD4+ T\u2010cells to mDC and evidence for the formation of sheet\u2010like membrane extensions that extend around T\u2010cells (Do et al., 2014; Felts et al., 2010; Figure 1c). In iDC, the formation of membrane extensions is induced via the interaction of HIV Env with DC\u2010SIGN, which in turn activates the GTPase CDC42 (Nikolic et al., 2011). Furthermore, tetraspanin TSPAN7 and dynamin 2 (DNM2) roles in actin nucleation and cortical stabilisation are essential for maintaining viral particles on dendrites (Menager & Littman, 2016). Membrane extensions are thought to allow contact with the uninfected cell and aid the efficient transfer of virus to promote infection.\n\nTo date, most studies of viral cell\u2010to\u2010cell transfer have been conducted in vitro; therefore, the importance of the VS and the spread of virus in vivo are starting to be addressed. In a recent study, Murooka et al. show HIV\u20101\u2010infected T\u2010cells contribute to the systemic infection in a humanised mouse model where productively infected T\u2010cells were visualised migrating to lymph nodes. A subset of cells were observed forming syncytia and adhering to CD4+ lymph node cells resulting in the formation of membrane tethers that may facilitate cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread (Murooka et al., 2012; Sewald, Motamedi, & Mothes, 2016). It was later shown that murine leukaemia virus and HIV\u20101 are captured by CD169/Siglec\u20101 expressed on the cell surface of macrophages. The macrophages formed synapses between B\u20101 cells that migrate into lymph nodes to continue to spread via VS, showing the importance of CD169 in viral spread (Sewald et al., 2015). In 2016, Law et al. looked at the genetic patterns of HIV\u20101 infection and found the cotransmission of two viral genotypes and the microclustering of infected cells formed, harbouring the same genotype within lymphoid tissue. HIV\u20101\u2010infected cells were able to induce the arrest of the interacting CD4+ T\u2010cells through Env\u2010dependent cell contacts (Law et al., 2016). Understanding cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread in various tissue types will be vital to the development of effective antiviral strategies in the future to block viral transmission to target cells.\n\nInfection with HTLV\u20101 has been implicated in several diseases including adult T\u2010cell lymphoma and a range of inflammatory diseases. The primary target of HTLV\u20101 is CD4+ T\u2010cells; however, there is evidence for infection of a range of immune cells including DC (Knight, Macatonia, Cruickshank, Rudge, & Patterson, 1993; Macatonia, Cruickshank, Rudge, & Knight, 1992), macrophages (Nath, Ruscetti, Petrow\u2010Sadowski, & Jones, 2003), B\u2010cells (Koyanagi et al., 1993), and CD8+ T\u2010cells (Hanon et al., 2000). The virus is taken into T\u2010cells via the receptor GLUT1 (Manel et al., 2003); however, unlike HIV\u20101 transmission, HTLV\u20101 is dependent entirely on cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact. Once infected, viral transmission is initiated via the binding of adhesion molecule ICAM\u20101 on the surface of the infected cell and LFA\u20101 on the surface of the target cell (Kim, Nair, Fernandez, Mathes, & Lairmore, 2006). This is in addition to the interaction of the viral Tax protein with ICAM\u20101 that appears to promote MTOC polarisation to the contact site (Nejmeddine, Barnard, Tanaka, Taylor, & Bangham, 2005). Viral Env glycoprotein, core proteins p19 and p15, and adhesion molecule talin all polarise towards the junction with the virus receptor GLUT\u20101 (Takenouchi et al., 2007), which along with neurophilin 1 (Ghez et al., 2006) and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (Pinon et al., 2003) are thought to strengthen the cell\u2010to\u2010cell adhesion. Interestingly, the HTLV VS appears to have a more ordered structure than HIV\u20101 VS, due to the recruitment of talin that forms a ring\u2010like structure, similar to the pSMAC of IS (Igakura et al., 2003). It has been reported that the HTLV\u20101 protein P8 downregulates TCR signalling (Fukumoto et al., 2007, 2009), increasing cell contact through interaction with LFA\u20101 clustering and controlling membrane extensions between T\u2010cells (Van Prooyen et al., 2010). Additionally, there is evidence for an alternative route of transmission via extracellular biofilms. The biofilm is believed to store virus particles on the cell surface in carbohydrate\u2010rich matrices consisting of collagen, agrin, tetherin, and galectin, which transfer between cells upon contact (Pais\u2010Correia et al., 2010).\n\nTransmission of virus via the VS may provide many advantages to viral survival by evading detection by the host immune system and establishing a latent reservoir of infection between immune cells. This mode of viral transmission has potentially important considerations for existing drug therapies. For example, HIV\u20101 transmitted cell to cell requires greater concentrations of broadly neutralising antibodies to neutralise virus when compared with cell\u2010free virus. In a recent study, several broadly neutralising antibodies were found to have a decreased capacity to neutralise virus isolated from HIV\u20101 patients in a transfer assay compared with cell\u2010free virus (Li, Zony, Chen, & Chen, 2017). Moreover, even though virus transferred via VS is still susceptible to antiretroviral treatment, it is thought to be less sensitive to some commonly used antiretrovirals than cell\u2010free virus (Sigal et al., 2011). This reduction in sensitivity has been attributed to the accumulation of viral particles at the VS reducing the virus's overall susceptibility to treatment (Duncan, Russell, & Sattentau, 2013). Reduced sensitivity to existing treatments could potentially encourage viral immune escape and contribute to viral persistence in patients, which is an important consideration for future vaccine development.\n\nThe formation of the VS provides a powerful and effective route for viral transmission for retroviruses such as HIV\u20101 and HTLV\u20101; however, recent studies are suggesting this maybe a common mode of transmission between immune cells. A good example is the infection of memory B\u2010cells with EBV, which results in the recruitment of adhesion molecules and the transfer of virus to polarised epithelial cells (Shannon\u2010Lowe & Rowe, 2011). Recently, Wang et al. demonstrate that the flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, is taken into DC via DC\u2010SIGN and plays an important role in trans\u2010infection to T\u2010cells. Imaging showed the transfer of JEV viral particles from DC to T\u2010cells via cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact and formation of VS (Wang et al., 2017). Similarly, Yang et al. demonstrate that SARS coronavirus, which also uses DC\u2010SIGN as an attachment receptor, is transferred between DC and target cells via a structure similar to the HIV\u20101 VS (Yang et al., 2004). As DC\u2010SIGN has been reported as an attachment receptor for several other viruses including Ebola (Alvarez et al., 2002), dengue (Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003), human cytomegalovirus (Halary et al., 2002), HIV\u20102 and SIV (Pohlmann et al., 2001), and HCV (Wang, Feng, Nie, & Zhou, 2004), it seems plausible that many more diverse viruses use similar methods for transmission to permissible cells.\n\nIn recent years, the use of nanoparticles in vaccine delivery has become a popular area of research. Drugs, vaccines, and even genes can be encapsulated and delivered to target sites within the body using vehicles such as liposomes, nanospheres/capsules, and micelles (Saravanan et al., 2018; Singh, Kruger, Maguire, Govender, & Parboosing, 2017). In addition, the controlled release, targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues, and greater efficacy produce a potent cell\u2010mediated and humoral response. Advances in vaccine development via ligand delivery or creation of virus\u2010like particles have led to several promising treatments for a range of viral infections including HIV\u20101, HCV, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, and influenza. Several reviews on the topic detail the current advances (Aikins, Bazzill, & Moon, 2017; Singh et al., 2017; Sulczewski, Liszbinski, Romao, & Rodrigues Junior, 2018).\n\nHIV\u20101 vaccine development has demonstrated that coating nanoparticles in the p24 antigen of HIV\u20101 allows targeted delivery into the dermis, eliciting a strong, HIV\u20101\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell response and B\u2010cell antibody production (Caucheteux et al., 2016). Exploiting the mechanics of VS formation has led to the development of ganglioside GM3 membrane\u2010wrapped gold nanoparticles that were found to activate GM3\u2010CD169 trafficking pathway in mDC. The addition of GM3 to the virus\u2010like nanoparticles was enough to deliver the conjugate to CD81+ compartments that accumulated at the junction between mDC and T\u2010cells, resembling the structure of a VS (Yu et al., 2015). Another promising approach incorporates the delivery of CCR5 siRNA encapsulated in liposomes coated in antibodies against LFA\u20101. Mice challenged with HIV after treatment with the CCR5 liposomes maintained CD4+ cell count and a twofold reduction in viral load (Kim et al., 2010). Overall, the targeted delivery to immune cells via LFA\u20101 appears as a promising approach at preventing viral spread (Figure 1d).\n\nIn respect to the IS, targeted control of the upregulation or downregulation of TCR signalling maybe beneficial in a range of diseases such as autoimmune disease or chronic infections and therefore a viable therapeutic target (reviewed in Jerome, 2008). The use of this next\u2010generation drug delivery is a very attractive prospect for the targeted delivery of vaccines exploiting the IS and VS to illicit specific immune responses.\n\nThe modulation of TCR signalling and VS formation appear to be an effective mechanism to disseminate virus to target cells and remain undetected by the host immune system. Viruses have evolved to manipulate these cellular adhesions to create the VS. Whether this is a specific targeted action or simply exploitation of existing pathways within immune cells remains to be determined. Further study into these structures and the viruses that utilise them will hopefully lead to more specific therapeutic targeting of life\u2010limiting infection.\n\nThis study has received funding from the Wellcome Trust Seedcorn Fund Grant/Code AC11900001 and the Department of Medicine University of Toronto.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interests."}
