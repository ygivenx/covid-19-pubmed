A major milestone for plant-based protein production for use in human health was achieved when Protalix BioTherapeutics produced taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso 1 ) in suspension cultures of a transgenic carrot cell line for the treatment of patients with Gaucher's disease, was approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration in 2012. In this review, we are highlighting various approaches for plant-based production of proteins and recent progress in the development of plant-made therapeutics and biologics for the prevention and treatment of human diseases.\n\nInfectious diseases remain as one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in developing countries and are exacerbated by the lack of resources and infrastructure to prevent, treat and control diseases. Therefore, emerging and re-emerging pathogens have frequently resulted in epidemics in these countries. Over the past several decades, production of proteins in plants has been shown to be a promising approach for the manufacture of targets for human health applications. Plants, when compared to other production systems, offer some advantages, including ease of scaling and lack of human and animal pathogens [1] [2] [3] (Table 1) .\n\nThis review focuses on several approaches that have been used to produce proteins in plants for prophylactic and therapeutic applications to combat human disease conditions. The various approaches for plant-based production of proteins are illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\nStable nuclear and chloroplast transformations are the two approaches utilized to express heterologous recombinant proteins in plants. Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation has a long history in plant genetic manipulation, and is achieved by stable integration of T-DNA into plant nuclear genome [4] . However, the approach is time consuming, with a lead time ranging from 12 to 18 months and typically has low levels of the target protein expressed [5] . Stable introduction of target genes into chloroplast genome, that is, chloroplast transformation or transplastomics, however, allows for higher levels of target expression as compared to nuclear transformation, largely due to the lack of gene silencing and high gene copy number [6] , but it is technically difficult, lacks most post-translational modifications and has only been successful in a limited number of plant species.\n\nTransient expression of target proteins in plants using modified plant viruses or viral vectors integrated into binary vectors delivered via Agrobacterium [7, 8 ] is often considered a more robust approach when compared to stable transformation, due to its rapid production capabilities and relatively high protein expression [8 ] . The majority of plant viral vectors used to date are based on single-stranded RNA viruses, such as tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus X and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), which encode for at least three proteins with functions in viral replication (replicase), encapsidation (coat protein) and movement from cell-to-cell (movement protein) [9]. The initial strategy involved production of recombinant proteins using plant viruses by exploiting their natural ability to infect (full virus) plants. However, this approach generally failed due to instability of viral genome modified by the introduction of large target genes [7] . This issue was largely resolved by using Agrobacterium-mediated gene delivery or agroinfiltration. The target gene can either be directly cloned into an Agrobacterium vector or through a modified plant viral vector which has been integrated into an Agrobacterium binary plasmid, and delivered into the plant tissues by infiltration with the transformed Agrobacterium [7, 8 ] . Agroinfiltration allows for high levels of target protein expression with the Table 1 General comparison of expression hosts for the production of heterologous proteins for medical and pharmaceutical applications potential for cost-effective production [5, 10] . The peak protein expression is typically observed in less than 7 days postinfiltration which is significantly faster when compared to the full virus strategy which requires more than 2 weeks in order to generate a systemic infection for expression. The promise of this platform has been evidenced in numerous successful clinical trials, which demonstrated safety and efficacy of plant-made protein therapeutics and biologics [11 ] . For example, in responding to the H1N1 influenza virus pandemic that occurred in 2009, Medicago, a Canadian company, reported producing the vaccine candidate, hemagglutinin in 19 days in Nicotiana benthamiana [10] . As such, agroinfiltration provides a rapid response capability and is currently the preferred approach for the production of proteins in plants.\n\nModified plant viruses for treatment of human diseases Loh, Green and Yusibov 83 Detection of serum IgG in immunized mice (SC) and fecal IgA in immunized mice via oral administration.

Several lead candidates have gone through clinical trials (Table 3) and have been comprehensively reviewed [12,13 ].\n\nVaccines are highly effective tools for the prevention of infections. Over the last three decades, plant-produced antigens targeting various pathogens have been shown to be effective in animal models ( Table 2) . Several of these candidates have progressed into early stage clinical development and were evaluated in Phase 1-2 human clinical trials ( (Table 3) .\n\nPlanet Biotechnology (Hayward, CA) produced the world's first plant-derived clinically tested secretory IgA monoclonal antibody which recognizes the surface antigen I/II of Streptococcus mutans (CaroRx TM ) that predominantly causes dental caries. Following the successful demonstration of safety and efficacy in a Phase 2 clinical trial, CaroRx TM has been licensed in Europe in a medical device category [17, 18] and applied as an oral topical solution to prevent tooth decay.\n\nIn 1986, the recombinant human growth hormone was the first plant-based biopharmaceutical protein produced in plants [19] . Then over two decades later, the FDA in May 2012 approved ELELYSO 1 (human recombinant taliglucerase alfa or glucocerebrosidase), an enzyme produced in genetically engineered carrot cells for treating type 1 Gaucher's disease (GD) by Protalix BioTherapeutics and its partner, Pfizer [20] . GD is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCD). GD is currently treated by enzyme replacement therapy using this recombinant GCD that is administered intravenously every 2 weeks [21] .\n\nIn addition to offering a versatile production platform for numerous plant-made proteins, plant viruses have been engineered to provide medical applications in other ways [22] . VLPs offer advantages over recombinant protein vaccines as they tend to elicit a higher immune response [23] . Virus nanoparticles have also been developed for the targeted delivery for disease treatment and diagnostic purposes. For example, CPMV represents an icosahedral nanoparticle with its capsid surface displaying 300 accessible lysine residues; each of these can be conjugated to various chemical moieties like fluorescent dyes/arrays, polyethylene glycol polymers and subcellular targeting molecules [24, 25] . The use of this technology includes 86 Engineering for viral resistance the construction of CPMV nanoparticles displaying gastrin-releasing peptide receptors that are overexpressed in human prostate cancers [26] . Another example, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus can stably assemble in vitro and package the RNA derived from sindbis virus, a mammalian virus. These hybrid cowpea chlorotic mottle virusbased VLPs were shown to protect against RNA degradation by cellular nucleases and were able to deliver and release their RNA contents within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Moreover, these hybrid VLPs with the fusion of subcellular targeting moieties could be directed toward distinct sites within the cell [27] and potentially applied as a medical targeted delivery tool. Plant viruses have also been engineered to act as adjuvants to elicit an immune response that is more potent and effective. The rodshaped papaya mosaic virus nanoparticles have been engineered to express an influenza epitope on their surface, and mice and ferrets immunized with these recombinant nanoparticles exhibited an increase in robust humoral response to influenza virus infection [28] .\n\nThere is growing evidence that plants are capable of making proteins with desired quality to address a range of human health-related issues. Plant production platforms for protein therapeutics and biologics, in particular the transient agroinfiltration approach, have demonstrated the ability to be used for broad research and development, as well as commercial needs. It has been extensively discussed that the transient agroinfiltration approach is the ideal platform for fast and scalable production in response to new outbreaks of highly infectious diseases and has been demonstrated under various programs. The success of Protalix Biotherapeutics in gaining FDA approval for the therapeutic enzyme, ELELYSO 1 for human use was a significant milestone for the plant molecular pharming field. More importantly, the primary benefits of plant-made protein therapeutics and biologics in terms of product safety and potential cost-effectiveness will further contribute to global public health in both developed and developing nations. \n\nYao J, Weng YQ, Dickey A, Wang YJ: Plants as factories for human pharmaceuticals: applications and challenges.
