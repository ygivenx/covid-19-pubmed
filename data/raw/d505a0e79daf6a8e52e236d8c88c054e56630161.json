Leurs poids mol~culaires sont de 190 000 (VGPI~o), 100 000 (VGPloo), 58 000 (VP58), 25 000 (VP~), 24 000 daltons (VGP~4). L'analyse de sous-particules obtenues apr~s un traitement par une enzyme prot6olytique, la brom61aine, indique que VGPI~o et VGPloo sont les ~l~ments constitutifs des spicules, que VP~5 et VGP~, sont associ~s ~ l'enveloppe virale et que VP~ est le polypeptide constitutif de la ribonuclSoprot6ine virale.\n\nMOTS-CLI~S : Virus 3 de l'h6patite de la souris, Polypeptide; Localisation.\n\nCoronaviruses are morphologically distinctive RNA viruses which have been classified in a separate taxonomic group [13] . While coronaviruses have been extensively studied morphologically, they have not been well-characterized chemically. An analysis of the structural components of murine coronavirus MHV3 is in progress in our laboratory. This report presents preliminary results concerning the analysis and the localisation of the MHV3 polypeptides. G. 0BERT AND COLL.\n\nThe American Type Collection strain of MHV3 was grown and titrated as previously described on cells of the DBT line originating from a murine brain tumour [18, 19] . In order to obtain purified radioactively labelled virus, MHV3 was grown either in the presence of 1 ~Ci/ml laC-L-amino acids (40 mCi/mAt of carbon; CEA, France), or in the presence of 5 ~Ci/ml glucosamine 3H-l-hydrochloride (15 Ci/mmole; CEA, France) and 5 ~Ci/ml 3H-6-fucose (15 Ci/mmole; CEA, France). Fourteen hours after infection, the tissue culture fluid was removed and clarified by low speed centrifugation. Virus in the supernatant was precipitated by incubation with polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) at a concentration of 8 % For sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the purified virus was dissolved in Tris-HC1 0.05 M pH 6.8, SDS 2 ~o, ~-mercaptoethanol 2 %, glycerol 15 % and bromophenol blue 0.001 ~o. The samples were submitted to electrophoresis on slab gels (5 ~o acrylamide stacking, 10 ~o acrylamide resolving gels) according to the techniques described by Laemmli [7] and by Studier [14] . After eleetrophoresis, the labelled protein bands were visualized by the fluorographie method of Bonner and Laskey [2] . Escherichia coli RNApolymerase subunits ~ (165,000 daltons) and ~' (155,000), phosphorylase b (94,000), bovine serum albumin (45,000), chymotrypsinogen (25,700), trypsin inhibitor from soybean (21,500) and cytochrome c (11,700), were used as standards for the molecular weight (MW) estimation of the viral polypeptides.\n\nFor electron microscopical observations, the viral particles were negatively stained by 2 ~o sodium-phosphotungstate at pH 7 and examined in a ~( Philips ~ EM300 electron microscope.\n\nAfter concentration of the tissue culture fluid by PEG 6000, MHV3 was purified successively on a rate zonal sucrose gradient and on a density glycerol/tartrate gradient. In this density gradient, MHV3 sedimented in a homogeneous band at a density of 1.185 (data not shown). Typical coronavirus particles with a diameter in the range of 70 to 120 nm covered with surface projections 15 to 22 nm in length could be observed ( fig. la) . . 2c ). Densitometrie analysis of different fluorographs (data not shown) revealed that in all cases the label of this neoproteins was approximatively the same that the label of VGP=4 and was significantly higher that the label of VP,~. Consequently, the 18,000-dalton protein seems derived mostly from VGP=4 and represents the portion of VGP=~ loealised inside the lipid bilayers of the membrane. Thus VGP24 was partially concealed within the viral envelope, and 25 ~ of this polypeptide was accessible to the enzyme. VP~ which disappears after bromelain treatment has not been localised on the viral membrane. Although, this 18,000-dalton protein appears to be derived in great part from VGP~, it is impossible to determine if it represents a single species of protein or if it also contains a polypeptide of similar MW issued from VP~s. Consequently, our results cannot indicate whether VP~5 is completely, digested by bromelain as in the case for VGPI~o and VGPlo~ and thus appears loealised at the surface of the membrane or whether VP~ as VGP,~ is partially concealed in the viral envelope. The available data on the structural proteins of coronaviruses from different species reveal some variety in number and size [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19., 15, 16, 20] . In general, the particle contains four to seven proteins. All reports indicate the presence of a major non-glycosylated protein of 50 to 60,000 daltons located inside the virion. One or two polypeptides below 50,000 daltons have been found, and at least one of these is glycosylated. A portion of these low MW proteins is localised inside the lipid bilayer. The polypeptides of high MW (2 to 4) are all glycosylated and involved in forming the surface projections.\n\nThe analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified mouse hepatitis virus type 3 revealed the presence of five polypeptides, three of them contained carbohydrate. The moIecular weight of these proteins was 190,000 daltons (VGP19o), 100,000 (VGPloo), 58,000 (VPss), 25,000 (VP~5) and 24,000 (VGP~4). The analysis of particles obtained after limited proteolysis with bromelain suggests that VGP19o and VGP~oo form the spike layer, that VP~ and VGP~4 are membrane-associated and that VP~s represents the inner core polypeptide.
