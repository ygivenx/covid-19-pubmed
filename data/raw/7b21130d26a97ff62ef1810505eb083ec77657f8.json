{"title": "Elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia: A retrospective case-control study", "body": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide since its discovery in December 2019 1, 2 . As of March 14, 2020, over five thousand death from 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported in 43 countries 3 .\n\nEffective strategies to treat this disease are urgently needed, but no drugs have been proven to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia 4 . Antibodies are key components in the immune responses to viral infections 5, 6 . Raised SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients 7 . However, less information is available about their dynamics and role in COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nTherefore, 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and with SARS-CoV-2 specific serum IgM and IgG detected were retrospectively selected between February 23, 2020, and March 11, 2020. The dynamics and role of serum IgM and IgG were investigated in this study.\n\nA total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and with serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 examined between February 23, 2020, and March 11, 2020 in Tongji Hospital were retrospectively investigated. In brief, the patients in mild-moderate group described here were all probable hospitalized subjects in four wards of Tongji hospital with (1) serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 examined, (2) chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia, (3) positive throat swab nucleic acid test by real-time RT-PCR methods or were excluded from this study. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (IRB ID\uff1aTJ-IRB20200343).\n\nInformation collection was accomplished through our hospital's electronic medical record system. Clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters and clinical outcomes were obtained with standardised forms for all subjects involved. Two researchers independently reviewed the data.\n\nSerum IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by the chemiluminescence kit (iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) and iFlash 3000 CLIA System supplied by Yhlo Biotech Co. LTD (Shenzhen, China), of which the chemiluminescence kit had completed the EU CE certification. Threshold of 10 AU/ml was used for both IgM and IgG as manufacturer recommended.\n\nThe statistical software SPSS 23.0 was used in this study. Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were described using mean with interquartile range (IQR). When the data were normal, continuous variables were analysed by t tests, otherwise using the Mann-Whitney test. \n\nThe blood counts of patients on admission showed significantly decrease in lymphocytes, especially in died group than in mild-moderate patients ( Table 2) . Figure 1A , B). We subsequently explored the correlations between IgM levels and clinical outcome, serum IgG levels, blood counts, or other involved parameters.\n\nInterestingly, serum IgM levels were positively correlated with IgG levels (r = 0.251, P = 0.006), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and All rights reserved.

To minimize confounding effects from age, a paired case-control study was further done. Each deceased case was matched with three mild-moderate patients of similar age (age difference within four years). Leucocyte count and neutrophil count of patients on admission were significantly higher in died group than mild-moderate patients ( author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We also explored the correlations between IgM levels and clinical outcome, serum IgG levels, blood counts, or other involved parameters. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041285 doi: medRxiv preprint epidemiological modelization have been well studied, while no effective drugs have been developed [10] [11] [12] . Host immune responses play a key role in virus elimination.\n\nHistological examination of lungs from patients who died of COVID-19 revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular exudates, accompanied by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates 13 . Meanwhile, peripheral T cells counts were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated 13, 14 .

It is a single-centre retrospective study with limited cases. Majority of patients admitted in our hospital were critically ill, so population bias exists. In addition, results of viral load and antibody re-testing were not available.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that dynamics of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was similar with that of SARS-CoV. Differently, elevated serum\n\nIgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nZH, XG and ZC made substantial contributions to the study design.
