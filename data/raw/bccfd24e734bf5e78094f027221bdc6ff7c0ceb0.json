{"title": "Surveillance for foodborne disease outbreaks in China, 2003 to 2008", "body": "Foodborne disease is a significant public health concern in both developed and developing countries. Although the disease is usually mild and self-limiting, due to the high number of individuals affected each year, foodborne disease exerts a substantial socioeconomic burden on the population and healthcare system. In the USA, foodborne disease causes about 47.8 million illnesses, 127839 hospitalizations, and 3037 deaths per year (Scallan, Griffin, Angulo, Tauxe, & Hoekstra, 2011) . In Australia, foodborne gastroenteritis causes an estimated 5.4 million illnesses, 14700 hospitalizations, and 76 deaths each year (Hall et al., 2005) . In England and Wales, foodborne gastroenteritis caused an estimated 2.4 million illnesses, 21138 hospitalizations, and 718 deaths in 1995 (Adak, Long, & O'Brien, 2002) . A study of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) in China estimated 209 million episodes of foodborne disease occurred in 2010e2011, and the relative incidence in China appears to be within the range of incidence reported in the abovementioned countries (Chen et al., 2013) . However, the method used to estimate the burden of foodborne disease in the United States, England and Wales and Australia was different from that in China. In the above-mentioned studies, pathogen-specific data were used to calculate the foodborne proportion of AGI. However, due to the lack of pathogen-specific data used to calculate the foodborne proportion of AGI, the Chinese study only used the foodborne proportions calculated by those studies to roughly estimate the foodborne disease in China.\n\nCases of foodborne disease are typically under-reported by traditional surveillance, which needs cases to present to the healthcare system. Only a small part of foodborne diseases, hospitalizations, and deaths happen as portion of identified outbreaks (Dewey-Mattia, Roberts, Vieira, & Fullerton, 2016) . However, the outbreak report is essential for a better understanding of the epidemiology of foodborne diseases. Although the summary of the outbreaks cannot lead to a clear conclusion of the disease trend, by identifying the implicated food vehicles and contributing factors, the health administration could be encouraged to evaluate and adopt suitable measures to prevent and control outbreaks in the future. Knowledge of implicated food vehicles and contributing factors allows consumers to be educated on decreasing high-risk behaviors, thereby reducing the risk of being affected by foodborne diseases. Up to date outbreak data can help food safety regulatory authorities to identify problems in the existing food supply system. Several countries systematically review foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs) in order to develop strategies to reduce the disease burden (Dalton et al., 2004; Gould et al., 2013; Lindqvist, Andersson, de Jong, & Norberg, 2000; O'Brien, Elson, Gillespie, Adak, & Cowden, 2002) .\n\nThe formation of a set of reporting, investigation and analysis system with high efficiency is essential to the efficient management and minimization of foodborne disease. The primary source of information relating to foodborne disease in China mainly captures information on outbreaks, although occasionally information on sporadic illnesses was collected. Before the establishment of the National Foodborne Diseases Surveillance Network (NFDSN), there had been no systematic collection of detailed and standardized information on FBDO in China. Previous summaries of data reported to the China NFDSN were published for 1992e2001 (Liu, Chen, Wang, & Ji, 2004 ), 2003 (Liu, Chen, Fan, & Wang, 2006 (Chen, Liu, Fan, & Wang, 2008 ), 2005 (Liu, Chen, Guo, & Wang, 2008 , and 2006 (Chen et al., 2010) . The objective of this study was to summarize epidemiologic data on FBDOs reported to the China NFDSN between 2003 and 2008.\n\nA FBDO is defined as the occurrence of 2 cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of the same type of food, or if the food vehicle was undetermined, sharing a common meal or food facility (Wu, Wen, Ma, Ma, & Chen, 2014) . Food poisoning diagnostic criteria are mainly based on epidemiological survey data, the incubation period and the unique clinical features of the patients, while the aim of laboratory diagnosis is to determine the cause of poisoning (Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, 1994) . Outbreaks that did not meet these criteria were not reported to the NFDSN by surveillance provinces.\n\nTo better understand foodborne disease epidemiology in China, China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (previously known as the Food Safety Section of the National Institute for Nutrition and Food Safety, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) established the NFDSN in 2001 in 13 surveillance provinces. Since 2003, surveillance provinces began reporting FBDO data to the NFDSN through the web-based National Food Safety Surveillance Information System. According to the Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China issued in 2009, a national food safety risk surveillance system that includes foodborne disease surveillance was built. Since then, foodborne disease surveillance had expanded to the entire nation, and the work of NFDSN was shifted to the new system. Thus, the research period of this study was limited to 2003e2008.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, outbreak reports were available from 12 surveillance provinces including Beijing, Neimenggu, Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Chongqing. In 2006, the surveillance provinces represent about 43% of the Chinese population (1314 million). Information collected for each outbreak included reporting province, date of illness onset, incubation period, number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, etiology, suspected food vehicle, setting of food preparation or consumption and contributing factors.\n\nFood vehicles were coded into four levels of classification. Level one foods include animal-based foods, plant-based foods, other foods, mixed dishes, multiple foods, and unknown. Level two breaks the foods into a second level, such as animal-based foods, divided into aquatic products, dairy and dairy products, egg and egg products, meat and meat products, and other animal-based foods. Level three breaks the foods into a third level, such as aquatic products, divided into crustacean, fish, molluscs, etc. Level four breaks the foods into a fourth level, such as crustacean, divided into crayfish, lobsters, crabs, etc.\n\nData were entered into Microsoft Access and analysed in Excel 2010. The per capita rate of FBDOs during 2003 and 2008 was calculated for each province by using population data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We used 2006 population as the denominator since it was in the middle of the study period (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2007).\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, a total of 2795 FBDOs were reported, which resulted in 62559 illnesses, 31261 hospitalizations, and 330 deaths ( Table 1) . Reports of outbreaks peaked in 2003 (772 outbreaks), falling to 262 outbreaks in 2008, with an average annual number of 466. The average annual rate of outbreaks and cases was 0.8 and 18.4 per 1 million population, respectively. Outbreaks are markedly seasonal, peaking in warmer months (Fig. 1) . The seasonal trend of microbial outbreaks was similar to that of FBDOs, but other causes of outbreaks did not have such seasonal trend.\n\nProvince-specific rate of outbreaks and cases ranged from 0.2e3.1 and 7.1e51.9 per 1 million population, respectively (Table 2) . Guangxi, Hubei and Zhejiang recorded the highest number of outbreaks during the six-year period; the average number of outbreaks per 1 million population by province for the six-year period was highest in Beijing, Guangxi and Shanghai (Table 2) . No outbreak occurs in multiple provinces was reported.\n\nA total of 2227 (80%) outbreaks had a known etiology and these outbreaks accounted for 79% (49422/62559) of illnesses (Table 3) . Of the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, bacterial disease was responsible for 48% (1051/2176) of outbreaks, 66% (31810/ 48044) of cases and 6% (18/299) of deaths (Table 3) . Of the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, Vibrio parahaemolyticus (322 outbreaks, 15%), non-typhoidal salmonellae (115 outbreaks, 5%), Bacillus cereus (111 outbreaks, 5%), and Proteus spp. (110 outbreaks, 5%) were the most frequent etiologic agents. There was no report of outbreak caused by Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. Vibrio cholera infection is not reported through the foodborne disease reporting system. Burkholderia gladioli was responsible for 17 deaths among 27 cases, much higher case-fatality rate than any other etiologic agent.\n\nOf the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, man-made chemical hazards were responsible for 25% of outbreaks, 14% of cases and 55% of deaths (Table 3) . Of the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, pesticides were responsible for 14% of outbreaks, 7% of cases, but 35% of deaths. Among them, organophosphorus pesticide alone was linked to 9% of outbreaks with a single known etiology and responsible for 4% of cases and 11% of deaths. Rodenticides were linked to 4% of outbreaks with a single known etiology, and 2% of cases, but 23% of deaths. Among them, Tetramine, was found in 4% of outbreaks with a single known etiology, and accountable for 2% of cases, but 22% of deaths. Food additives, mainly Nitrite, were linked to 7% of outbreaks with a single known etiology, 4% of cases, and 10% of deaths.\n\nOf the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, animal and plant toxins were responsible for 25% of outbreaks, 17% of cases and 39% of deaths (Table 3) . Phytohemagglutinin was responsible for 7% of outbreaks with a single known etiology, 8% of cases, but no death reported. Mushroom toxins were linked to 7% of outbreaks with a single known etiology, and responsible for 2% of cases and 20% of deaths.\n\nThe incubation period was reported in 142 (25%) of the 568 outbreaks that had an unknown etiology: <1 h (7 outbreaks, 5%), 1e7 h (60 outbreaks, 42%), 8e14 h (42 outbreaks, 30%), and 15 h (33 outbreaks, 23%).\n\nA food vehicle was reported for 2073 (74%) of the 2795 outbreaks, 1930 (69%) of which were attributed to a single food commodity (Table 4) . Plant-based foods were the most common single commodity reported (930 outbreaks, 48%), followed by animalbased foods (590 outbreaks, 31%), and other foods (283 outbreaks, 15%).\n\nIn the category of plant-based foods, vegetable was the most common commodity reported (339 outbreaks, 36%), followed by cereals (214 outbreaks, 23%) and mushrooms (161 outbreaks, 17%). Among outbreaks associated with vegetable, the most common 2003  772  28  17163  27  11330  36  95  29  2004  569  20  14441  23  7553  24  48  15  2005  454  16  9401  15  3877  12  45  14  2006  432  15  9461  15  5555  18  45  14  2007  306  11  6555  10  1435  5  60  18  2008  262  9  5538  9  1511  5  37  11  Total  2795  100  62559  100  31261  100  330 food vehicle reported was kidney beans (136 outbreaks, 40%).\n\nIn the category of animal-based foods, meats were the most common commodity reported (385 outbreaks, 65%), followed by aquatic products (137 outbreaks, 23%). Among outbreaks associated with aquatic products, the most common food vehicle reported was fish (35 outbreaks, 26%).\n\nSetting of food prepared or consumed was provided in the majority (98%) of the outbreak reports (Table 5) . Outbreaks most frequently occurred in private residences (32%), workplace cafeterias (21%), and restaurants (17%). Workplace cafeteria was responsible for the highest number of cases (15337 cases, 25%), while private residence (254 deaths, 77%) was associated with the majority of deaths. The median number of cases per outbreak was much higher for take-away (27 cases) and school cafeteria (24 cases) than for private residence (6 cases) and food supermarket (5 cases).\n\nAt least one contributing factor was reported for 2190 (78%) of the 2795 outbreaks (Table 6 ). The most common factor reported in the 2190 outbreaks with known contributing factors were improper cooking (510 outbreaks, 23%), contaminated ingredient (503 outbreaks, 23%), cross contamination (475 outbreaks, 22%) and improper storage (295 outbreaks, 13%). \n\nThis is the most comprehensive summary of FBDOs in China since the publication of a summary from 1992 to 2001, which was published in Chinese (Liu et al., 2004) . The annual number of FBDOs reported during 2003e2008 (466 outbreaks) was similar to the average annual number reported during 1992e2001 in the same 12 surveillance provinces (499 outbreaks, data not shown), indicating FBDOs continue to be an important public health problem in China.\n\nThe decrease in the number of outbreaks reported since 2003 might be true but it could also suggest reporter fatigue. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak probably increased effort in the detection, investigation and reporting of outbreaks, thus led to the peak in 2003 (Feng, Li, & Varma, 2011) . It is possible that the a Includes aquatic products in above categories that may be mixed together and aquatic products not in above categories, or where type of aquatic product was unknown. It is the same for other meat and meat products, other animal-based foods, and other plant-based foods. reliability of the data changes over time as, for example, methods or technical skills in the investigating laboratories, improved. Seasonality of microbial foodborne outbreaks was observed in this summary, with a peak in the summer. Summer is associated with increased rates of Salmonella and Vibrio infection in China. The seasons might affect the incidence of infectious foodborne disease, investigating of the reasons for the summer dominance of FBDOs should be the focus of surveillance in the future. However, the seasonal peak of infection attributed to some foodborne pathogens is not in the summer. For instance, norovirus and rotavirus increase in autumn or in winter (Ahmed, Lopman, & Levy, 2013; Zhang et al., 2017) . Seasonality may be related to climate conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity and rainfall), all of which may affect exposure frequency, host immune status, and virulence.\n\nThe number of outbreaks per million population differs greatly across provinces, a finding similar to Australia and the USA (Dalton et al., 2004; Gould et al., 2013) . Such discrepancy may indicate differences in the management of FBDOs in the surveillance provinces rather than true disparities in outbreak event. These differences could also be due to differences in lifestyle, education or public health infrastructure in these provinces. A limitation of this summary is that it relies on the outbreak data reported by surveillance provinces while no supplementary study was carried out to determine how reliable the surveillance systems are between provinces, and how well resourced and how competent the laboratory staff are to unambiguously identify sources of illness in outbreaks. However, the population-based ratio may serve as a useful tool for evaluation the reliability of the surveillance and outbreak investigation systems in each of the provinces for which data are included.\n\nAn additional important factor that will affect reporting is the limitation of laboratory capacity to identify a full range of potential foodborne pathogens. Norovirus is the main cause of foodborne disease in the USA, leading to about 58% of indigenous foodborne disease with known etiology (Scallan, Hoekstra, et al., 2011) . During 2003e2008, the virus replaced the bacterial pathogens as the most common cause of the reported FBDOs in the USA. As the number of outbreaks of viral causes increase, the number of outbreaks of unknown etiology is proportionally reduced (Gould et al., 2013) . During the same period, probably due to lack of molecular biological and immunological techniques by local health sectors, only one rotavirus outbreak was reported to China NFDSN. The percentage of outbreaks with unknown etiology was almost doubled during the period 2003e2008 (20%) compared with that of 1992e2001 (10%). In the present study, about 20% of these outbreaks had an incubation period of equal or greater than 15 h, suggesting that many were of viral causes (Olsen, MacKinnon, Goulding, Bean, & Slutsker, 2000) . It is not enough to rely on routine culture of intestinal bacteria during the outbreak of foodborne disease, and it is necessary to promote the local health sectors to improve the diagnostic capacity for virus detection and enumeration.\n\nV. parahaemolyticus is widely found in estuaries and marine environments around the world and is the leading cause of human gastroenteritis in the USA (Iwamoto, Ayers, Mahon, & Swerdlow, 2010) . It is also a common cause of foodborne diseases in Asian countries (Alam, Tomochika, Miyoshi, & Shinoda, 2002; Raghunath, Acharya, Bhanumathi, & Karunasagar, 2008) . Consistent with the 1992e2001 report, V. parahaemolyticus remains the number one cause of foodborne disease in 2003e2008 in the area covered by the China NFDSN. Consumers can reduce the risk of shellfishrelated infections caused by V. parahaemolyticus by not eating raw or uncooked shellfish; doctors and individuals need to use antibiotics with care, since blind use of antibiotics may increase V. parahaemolyticus infection risk (Yan et al., 2015) .\n\nProteusspecies, which are usually found in soil and water, mostly known as conditioned human pathogens, have often been responsible for both food spoilage and FBDOs . In the present summary, Proteus spp. induced FBDOs represented 10% of microbial FBDOs, which falls within the same range as those reported previously (8%e14%) (Chen et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2008) .\n\nB. gladioli is an 'unexpected' foodborne pathogen. However, due to common consumption of tempeh with which it is associated, and in which it produces bongkrekic acid, it is an important foodborne pathogen in China.\n\nGenerally, the contamination of chemical hazards in food is well regulated and managed in developed countries (Rocourt, Moy, Vierk, & Schlundt, 2003; World Health Organization, 2015) . However, foodborne diseases caused by chemical hazards are still one of the important food safety problems faced by mainland China. In the present study, of the outbreaks with a single known etiology, manmade chemical hazards accounted for 25% of outbreaks, 14% of cases and 55% of deaths. The number of outbreaks and mortality attributed to man-made chemicals is remarkable, and all of these outbreaks are acute poisonings. To guarantee the chemicals such as food additives, pesticides and veterinary drugs are safely used, the Chinese government needs to develop stricter regulations on food and agricultural products, and to improve the administrative law enforcement mechanism.\n\nIn an outbreak situation investigators are more likely to identify a food vehicle, which makes outbreaks a valuable source of data on transmission. Mushrooms led to 6% of outbreaks and 18% of deaths. It is necessary to educate consumers to carefully consider the consumption of wild mushrooms which may contain biological toxins. Kidney beans caused 5% of outbreaks. Ingestion of the phytohemagglutinin present in raw or undercooked kidney beans can lead to AGI (Miyake, Tanaka, & McNeil, 2007) . Private residence led to 32% of outbreaks, 18% of cases and 77% of deaths, suggesting that food safety risk communication and education should be carried out for household food preparation. Company canteen led to 21% of outbreaks and 25% of cases. It is necessary to strengthen the supervision of such food service agencies, and to provide specialized education and training to food handlers working in these facilities.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the number of reported FBDOs summarized in the present study only represents a proportion of all FBDOs that actually occurred during the surveillance period. Underreporting of FBDOs is common in China for many factors, such as the awareness of consumers and physicians, lack of resources and capacity of foodborne disease surveillance in underdeveloped and faraway regions (Olsen et al., 2000; Xue & Zhang, 2012) . Therefore, caution should be exercised before extrapolating the findings of these data for 43% of the Chinese population in 12 provinces to the risk of FBDO to all Chinese people and provinces.\n\nAnalysis of FBDO investigations has highlighted the epidemiological characteristics and the important control regulations of FBDOs in China, which has been useful in the improvement of public health control measures. Continued surveillance for FBDOs is crucial to understand changes in the etiologic agents, the implicated food vehicles, and contributing factors associated with illness."}
