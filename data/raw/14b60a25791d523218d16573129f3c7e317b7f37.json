A8-A10).\n\nThe R software (version 3.5.3, http://cran.r-project.org; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform statistical analyses.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The cumulative confirmed cases varied from one (Tibet) to 33,453 (Hubei), and 74.7% of all confirmed cases occurred in Hubei for the periods (Fig. 1a) . The average AT ranged from \u221216.96\u00b0C to 19.3\u00b0C (Fig.   1b) , and the average ARH ranged from 17.93% to 86.20% (Fig. 1c) . The estimates of regression coefficients of the GAM for Hubei province are listed in Table 1 . There was a significant interaction between AT and ARH (0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.004-0.07), and the effect of the Baidu index was also statistically significant. Significant interactions between AT and ARH were also found in Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei, Jilin, and Gansu (Table A2) . author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the 0.75-0.93), and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.8-1).

We found spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 incidence, as well as its relationship with daily AT and ARH, among provinces in Mainland China.\n\nThe study period \u2212 and hence time series length \u2212 was longer for Hubei province than other provinces. The longer the study period, the more stable the model results are expected to be. Considering the incubation period of COVID-19, we used the 14-day EMA of daily AT and ARH to investigate the effects of ARH and AT on COVID-19. Most of the confirmed cases (and therefore meteorological data) were derived from the period before travel restrictions were enacted for Wuhan city (January 23, 2020); therefore, the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20044099 doi: medRxiv preprint while low temperature can also dry out the mucous membrane, reduce the function of cilia, and support the survival and transmission of the virus and the spread of diseases [6, 8, 14, 19, 20] .\n\nA novel finding of this study is the significant interaction between ARH and AT, and COVID-19 transmission. In Hubei province, the interaction between ARH and AT was found to have a positive effect on transmission (0.04, 95% CI: 0.004-0.07). Increased AT (ARH) led to a decreased effect of ARH (AT) on the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei province. The exact mechanism of the interaction is unclear. One probable reason might be that a combination of low AT and humidity make the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, creating opportunities for virus invasion [21] . A previous study observed an interaction between minimum temperature and humidity on influenza [22, 23] There are some limitations in our study. First, some potential risk factors that could impact the incidence of COVID-19 \u2212 for example, province-specific social-economic status \u2212 were not included in the model. The study period is short, so that it can be assumed that many covariates did not vary substantially during such a short time period. Second, the incidence of COVID-19 in provinces other than Hubei was more likely to be influenced by interventions after the outbreak in Hubei province. In addition, the meteorological data were collected from the Weather Underground for the capital city for each province only, and data accuracy and representativeness can be improved in future studies. Provinces (except for Hubei) had a short study period and included 1 1 many imported cases.\n\nIn conclusion, meteorological factors influence COVID-19 transmission and spread, potentially with an interactive effect between daily temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 incidence. There were spatial and temporal heterogeneities in COVID-19 occurrence, which could be attributed to meteorological factors as well as interventions measures across provinces. The reasons for the inconsistency in the impact of meteorological factors on COVID-19 among provinces needs further study.\n\nWe declare that we have no conflicts of interest. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20044099 doi: medRxiv preprint author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20044099 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 4 province from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020.
