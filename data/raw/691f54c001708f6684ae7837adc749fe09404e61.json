{"title": "Contesting the evidence for -1 frameshifting in immune-functioning C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) -the HIV-1 co-receptor 2", "body": "Efficient -1 frameshifting requires a slippery site together with an appropriately 23 positioned stimulatory RNA structure. The reported CCR5 slip site (U_UUA_AAA where 24 underscores set of the reading frame) has previously been shown to facilitate high 25 levels of -1 frameshifting in vitro when positioned 5' of a known stimulatory pseudoknot 6 . 26 However, frameshifting efficiencies in vivo could be substantially different and further, at 27 least as of 2016, there were no known virus frameshift sites with the reported CCR5 28 shift site 1 .\n\nWe challenge the reported results by showing that frameshifting at the relevant 31 CCR5 sequence cassette does not occur above background levels and that the claimed 32 pertinent sequence is not as distinctively conserved as previously presented. Lastly, we 33 demonstrate that previously published retroelement derived human frameshift signals 34 do indeed harbor frameshift activity.

This analysis showed that the entire CDS, not 45 just the predicted frameshift site, is highly conserved among primates. Thus, the 46 observation that the frameshift site is mostly conserved in primates does not indicate that the (putative) ability to frameshift is subject to purifying selection.\n\nDual-luciferase vectors in which the test cassette is sandwiched between and 50 fused to both Firefly and Renilla luciferase encoding sequences, have been widely used 51 for assaying translational recoding events ( Figure 3A) . The frameshifting efficiency is 52 calculated by dividing Firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity. This ratio is 53 then normalized to an in-frame control vector in which Renilla and Firefly luciferases are 54 both situated in the zero-frame to account for differences in activity between the two 55 enzymes (a ratio of a ratio) ( Figure 3B ). 56 57 In nearly all cases the fused test encoded polypeptide has only a small or no 58 effect on the upstream encoded luciferase activity. However, in one case luciferase 59 activity was anomalously low (unpublished) and we developed a variant vector system 60 (pSGDluc 7 ) containing a StopGo sequence directly 3' of the first and immediately 5' of 61 the second luciferase encoding sequence. Subsequently we made another variant by 62 removing a potential splice site, pSGDlucV3.0 (deposited with Addgene). Thus in earlier 63 constructs, where the insert-encoded peptides were appended to the C-terminus of 64 Renilla luciferase, the Renilla luciferase activity could dropparticularly for the short This problem has been overcome by inserting flanking StopGo sequences that result in 67 co-translational excision of the insert-encoded peptides, thus releasing independent 68 Renilla and Firefly proteins that are identical in sequence for both the test and in-frame 69 control constructs. The publication on CCR5 frameshifting utilized the very first iteration 70 of a dual luciferase vector that we developed in 1998 8 .\n\nWe recloned the same CCR5 frameshift sequence tested in the original article 73 into pSGDlucV3.0. For CCR5 we used negative controls comparable to those in the 74 original article, which include a slip site mutant (UUUAAAA \uf0e0 GCGCGCG for Y.A.K., 75 UUUAAAA \uf0e0 AUUCAAA for G.L.), a 5`-termination control (also known as a premature 76 termination codon control or PTC control) and a 3`-termination control (also known as 77 an out-of-frame stop codon control or OOF control). Lastly, we included measurements The dual luciferase assays were carried out in the same cell line used in the 82 original article, HeLa. Renilla luciferase, the reference luciferase, is stable for all the 83 constructs ( Figure 4A ). Similarly Firefly luciferase activities for the in-frame controls of 84 CCR5 and a HIV-1 control are consistent as well, indicating that when forced to express 85 Firefly luciferase, both constructs produce proteins with similar activity. The Firefly 86 luciferase activity for the WT HIV-1 frameshift construct is >40 fold higher than that of 87 WT CCR5 or any of its negative controls. Furthermore, the Firefly luciferase activity for 88 .

After normalizing the luciferase activities for the test vectors to their respective in-91 frame control vectors, we find that HIV-1 shows frameshift rates that are comparable to 92 previously reported findings in HeLa cells 9 . However, CCR5 WT frameshifting is 93 ~0.15%, indistinguishable from its negative controls, indicating that CCR5 does not 94 frameshift above background at our limit of sensitivity and is certainly far less than the 95 previously reported level of 9-11% 3 . In fact, CCR5 SSM demonstrates slightly higher To ensure that these results were repeatable, the cloning and assaying of CCR5 In conclusion, using an improved reporter assay system, we find no evidence of - The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
