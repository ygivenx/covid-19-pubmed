{"title": "Pathogen screening and prognostic factors in children with severe ARDS of pulmonary origin", "body": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous syndrome with a severe lung inflammation disorder that presents as rapidly progressive hypoxemia and dyspnea. 1 ARDS is principally associated with direct injury to the lung, such as infectious pneumonia, or indirect injury to the lung resulting from systemic inflammation, such as non-pulmonary sepsis, trauma, and surgery. 2 Pneumonia remains the predominant cause of death in children under 5 years of age 3 and it is the most common trigger of ARDS in children. 4 Pediatric ARDS is one of the most lethal diseases in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and is associated with a high rate of mortality. 5 Historically, pediatric ARDS was defined using the adult ARDS criteria based on the American-European Consensus Conference 6 and Berlin Definition in 2012 7 before the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference published a pediatric-specific definition of ARDS in 2015. 8 According to the Berlin Definition, severe ARDS is defined as hypoxemia with \u2264100 mm Hg of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 mm Hg) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) ratio (P/F ratio) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)\n\nWe previously reported that children with H5N1 avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection developed severe ARDS and showed that H5N1 directly infected and injured alveolar epithelial cells, which was correlated with the expression levels of cytokine/ chemokine-mRNAs in lung tissues by pathological and molecular biological examinations of post-mortem biopsied H5N1 infected lung tissues. 9, 10 Other emerging viruses such as H7N9 avian influenza virus (H7N9), 11 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), 12 [16] [17] [18] Several inflammatory mediators were reported to be biomarkers of ARDS and potential predictors of poor outcome. 19 However, few studies have examined the inflammatory response, specifically in severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infections.\n\nThe primary aim of this study was to examine the pathogens contributing to severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children. The secondary aim was to examine the profiles of inflammatory mediators and investigate the prognostic factors for a fatal outcome of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children using multivariate analysis. (HMGB-1) were measured using the HMGB1 ELISA kit II (Shino-test Corp., Tokyo, Japan). HMGB-1 is a late inflammatory mediator of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury. 28 All samples were run in duplicate, and the average concentrations were used for statistical analysis.\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in the clinical data and cytokine/chemokine levels between groups. Fisher's exact test was used for bivariate analysis of categorical data. The associations between cytokine/chemokine levels and clinical data were tested by linear regression analysis. To assess the goodness of fit of the linear regression model, R-squared measure was used. We used logistic regression analysis to analyze the relationship between independent outcome predictors and outcome.\n\nTo assess the goodness of fit of the logistic regression model, the Demographic and clinical data are summarized in Table 1 . The patients (32 boys and 25 girls) ranged in age from 1 month to 9 years (median, 9 months) and 44 (77%) children were less than 1 year old.\n\nTwelve children had a medical history (pneumonia, n = 9; febrile convulsion, n = 1 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, n = 1 and hemosiderosis, n = 1) and two children were positive for human immunodeficiency virus. The median duration from the onset of illness to PICU admission was 9 days, and 21 (37%) patients were admitted to the PICU within 7 days of the onset of illness. The median P/F ratio was 78 mm Hg and 43 (75%) children showed a P/F ratio of \u2264100 mm Hg with a PEEP \u22655 cm H 2 O on the day of PICU admission. All children were intubated and supported on a mechanical ventilator. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score was assessed using parameters obtained during the first 12 h of stay in the PICU. 29 PRISM III scores were 0-23 (median 8.0). Glucocorticoid or high-dose intravascular immunoglobulin were administered to 46 (81%) and 36 (63%) children, respectively, as adjunct treatments depending on the physician's decision. Table 2 . Fifty-three (92%) patients were positive for either ADV-B or MeV or CMV. In addition,\n\ninfections (Table 1) . We screened CMV infection as a possible cause of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin, as we have observed many immunocompetent infants with CMV-associated pneumonia in our hospital. 30 Ninety-two percent (23 of 25) of CMV-positive children were co-infected with other viruses, and most CMV infections were considered to be opportunistic infections that followed infection with another virus or CMV-persistent infection. 31 The most commonly detected bacteria and fungi were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans, which are generally considered to be opportunistic and nosocomial infections (Table 3) . Streptococcus pneumoniae, a representative pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, was detected in two children with measles. Taken together, most cases of severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in the present study developed from viral pneumonia rather than from primary bacterial pneumonia. Only 18 (32%) patients had bacteremia or fungemia (Table 3 ).\n\nThirty-two (56%) children died in the PICU (non-survivors) and nearly half died within the first 7 days after PICU admission. In this study, the survivors were PICU-survivors who were discharged from the PICU alive. As shown in Table 1 , there were no significant differences in According to another classification, IFN-\u03b3 is a type 1 cytokine, produced from T helper type 1 (Th1) lymphocytes and predominantly promotes cellmediated immunity. IL-10 is a type 2 cytokine produced from T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes and predominantly supports humoral immunity and antibody production. 32 Cytokines/chemokines are produced simultaneously and have counteracting effects.\n\nNotably, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 and ratio of IFN-\u03b3 to IL-10 (IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio) in non-survivors was significantly higher than in survivors ( Table 4 ). The levels of IFN-\u03b3 were only associated with a fatal outcome and were not influenced by MeV, ADV-B, or bacterial/ fungal infection (Fig. 1A) . The IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio suggests a relative balance in the type 1 and type 2 cytokines. 32 The IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio was higher in non-survivors, indicating a greater Th1 predominance in non-survivors on the day of PICU admission. The ratio of IL-6 to IL-10 (IL-6/IL-10 ratio), which suggested a relative balance in proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, showed no The data presented as the number (%) or the median (interquartile range). The CRP were available for 31 non-survivors and 24 survivors. Fisher's exact test was employed for the bivariate analysis of the categorical data. The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of continuous data between two groups. *P < 0.05.\n\nwere observed in non-survivors or ADV-B-infected children, and lower levels of IL-10 were observed in MeV-infected children (Fig. 1B ).\n\nIn addition, both the IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio and IL-6/IL-10 ratio were significantly increased in MeV-infected children compared to in uninfected children (Fig. 1C,D) . The higher IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio reflected lower IL-10 levels in MeV-infected patients (Fig. 1A,B) . The higher IL-6/IL-10 ratio reflected higher IL-6 (data not shown) and lower IL-10 levels in MeV-infected patients (Fig. 1B) . Patients with bacterial/fungal co-infections exhibited markedly higher levels of HMGB-1 compared to uninfected patients, but there were no differences in the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 or the IFN-\u03b3/IL10\n\nand IL-6/IL-10 ratios between patients with and without bacterial/ fungal infections (Fig. 1A-E) . \n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae 4\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa 2\n\nStenotrophomonas maltophillia 1\n\nThe data presented as the number of patients whose samples were positive for the microorganisms during their PICU stay. (Table 5A ).\n\nThe only variable that modified the probability of the patient with a high serum IFN-\u03b3 concentration was a fatal outcome (R 2 = 0.248). We Therefore, the frequency of multiple virus infection in this study was not significantly associated with the measles outbreak.\n\nThe most frequently detected virus genome in TLF was AdV-B. In a previous study, we reported that children who died from measlesassociated pneumonia in our PICU during the same measles outbreak were complicated with ADV-B (type 7) pneumonia. 22 PICU-mortality was not associated with the type of causative pathogen, but rather with the inflammatory responses induced by host immunity. We evaluated the differences in serum levels of inflammatory mediators between non-survivors and survivors on the day of PICU admission and examined if they were associated with the type of infected pathogens. We found that the serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 were associated with fatal outcome (Fig. 1 and dengue patients. 37 IFN-\u03b3 has rarely been reported as a prognostic mediator for ARDS, but it was reported as one of the independent outcome predictors in H7N9-infected patients. 17 As shown in this study, particularly for children with severe ARDS of pulmonary origin with respiratory virus infection, we found that the serum level of IFN-\u03b3 was a possible prognostic factor of fatal outcome.\n\nSerum levels of HMGB-1 were reported to be related to poor prognosis of ARDS patients. 38 In this study, the serum levels of HMGB-1\n\nwere higher in children with bacterial and fungal co-infections than in children with only viral infections, although, HMGB-1 levels were not | 1475 associated with a fatal outcome. The serum levels of IL-10 were associated with not only fatal outcome, but also MeV infection and AdV infection (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, IL-10 does not appear to be suitable as an independent prognostic factor of fatal outcome. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio was not associated with fatal outcome. The higher IL-6/IL-10 ratio on the day of PICU admission was thought to reflect measles-specific inflammatory responses. 34 The present study had some limitations. First, our sample size was small. Second, the results, particularly the types of detected virus genomes, may have been affected by a concurrent measles outbreak.\n\nThird, we did not include data from healthy Vietnamese children of the same age as the controls. Thus, we could not compare the serum levels of each inflammatory mediator to those in healthy children. Fourth, PCR-detected virus was not necessarily a causative pathogen of the disease. Persistent ADV and CMV infections can be established after primary infection and may be detected in healthy children. 31, 39 Fifth, if the genomes of RNA viruses were degraded at the time of sample collection and if the primers or probe binding sequences were mutated, these genomes could not be detected. Sixth, other pathogens may have been present but not detected.\n\nIn summary, this is the first report to determine the profiles of pathogens involved in severe ARDS of pulmonary origin in children with respiratory virus infection. We found that IFN-\u03b3 upregulation as detected on the day of PICU admission was one of the possible prognostic factors affecting a fatal outcome, rather than the type of pathogen. This suggests that modulation of the inflammatory response, regardless of the pathogen type, is critical for the clinical management of these patients."}
