{"title": "Number and distribution ofT lymphocytes in the small intestinal mucosa of calves inoculated with rotavirus", "body": "Rotaviruses have been identified as the most important viral enteropathogen of calves in the second week of life in the UK (Reynolds et at., 1986; Snodgrass et at., 1986) and as the major cause of acute viral diarrhoea in infants and young children, causing 5-10 X 106 deaths every year in developing countries (Kapikian and Chanock, 1990 ). An understanding of immune responses to rotavirus is needed to develop effective prophylaxis which would benefit the health and welfare of both species.\n\nSerotype-specific neutralising antibody is one of the immune mechanisms against rotavirus infection (Theil, 1990) , but heterotypic protection was observed in the absence of rotavirus-specific neutralising antibody in infants (Clark et at., 1988) and calves (Bridger and Oldham, 1987 ; Woode et at., *Corresponding author. 1987) , indicating other mechanisms in rotavirus immunity. Cytotoxic T cells contributed to the immune response of mice to rotavirus; after oral or parenteral inoculation with rotavirus, virus-specific cytotoxic activity was detected among splenic and intraepithelial lymphocytes (Offit and Dudzik, 1989) . Subsequently, in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, a chronic rotavirus infection was cleared by adoptive transfer of immune CD8 \u00f7 T lymphocytes (Dharakul et al., 1990) and passive protection against rotavirusinduced diarrhoea was induced in the absence of virus-specific antibodies using the same technique (Offit and Dudzik, 1990) .\n\nIf lymphocytes in the calf small intestinal mucosa are involved in immune mechanisms against rotavirus, a change in the number and distribution of lymphocyte subsets might be expected in response to infection and a study of these changes might indicate the cell types involved in immune responses. Three major T cell populations are found in cattle. The present study establishes the number and distribution of these three lymphocyte subsets in the epithelium and lamina propria of villi in control calves and investigates changes in these subsets in calves inoculated with bovine rotavirus.\n\nTen gnotobiotic calves Hoare et al., 1976) aged 10 days were inoculated orally with 106 TCIDso of rotavirus C3-160 and four controls were given saline. Rotavirus C3-160 is a cloned virus of low virulence, which infects 10-day-old calves without causing diarrhoea (Bridger and Pocock, 1986; Bridger and Oldham, 1987) . Two inoculated and one control calf were killed at 2, 4, 6 and 8 days after inoculation, and two inoculated calves at 10 days after inoculation.\n\nCalves were anaesthetised with pentobarbitone sodium (Sagatal, May and Baker, Dagenham, UK). Lengths of small intestine ( 10 cm) were ligated at nine sites and the sacs filled in situ with formol sublimate (Hall et al., 1985 ) . Samples of tissue were removed from the proximal small intestine at the ligament of Treitz, from the distal small intestine adjacent to the ileocaecal junction and from the mid small intestine. They were immersed in OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Elkhart, USA), frozen in isopentane in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 \u00b0 C. The sacs infused with fixative were removed, immersed in fixative and the animal killed by anaesthetic overdose.\n\nFixed tissue from nine small intestinal sites was processed into paraffin wax. Sections were cut at 5/~m, dewaxed, hydrated and stained for rotavirus antigen using an antiserum to rotavirus in an indirect peroxidase technique (Hall et al., 1993) .\n\nTo assess the distribution of infection in the small intestine, the number of villi on which immunostaining to rotavirus antigen was or was not detected was counted and the percentage of infected villi calculated. Villi were counted in one section from each of the nine small intestinal sites from each of the two calves killed at 2, 4 and 6 days post inoculation.\n\nTo distinguish between lymphocytes expressing different surface marker molecules, frozen tissues from proximal, mid and distal small intestine were cut on a cryostat at 8 #m and stored with silica gel at -20 \u00b0C until they were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) ( Table 1 ). The specificities of these antibodies were defined at the First International Workshop on Leukocyte Antigens in Cattle, Sheep and Goats . Samples were not available from one calf killed at 4 days post inoculation. Cell culture fluid, diluted 1/5 in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.01% sodium azide (Sigma, Pool, UK) or ascitic fluid diluted 1 / 1000 was applied to each section and an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique (Vectorstain ABC, Peterborough, UK) was used with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidene tetrahydrochloride as substrate (Sigma) (Howard et al., 1988 ) .\n\nThe areas of villus epithelium and villus lamina propria that were immunostained using each mAb were measured from five villi from the proximal, mid and distal small intestine. Villi sectioned longitudinally were chosen at random and measurements made with an Optomax V image analyser (Synoptics, Cambridge, UK). Stained areas of epithelium and lamina propria were expressed as the mean percentage area of epithelium and lamina propria per villus. It has been assumed that the area stained by each mAb was proportional to the number of cells present in the tissue which expressed the antigen recognised by the particular mAb as previously reported (Parsons et al., 1989 ) . Statistical analysis of the data was not possible because small groups of gnotobiotic calves were studied.\n\nThe majority of BoCD4 + lymhocytes occurred in the lamina propria, while most BoCD8 + and BoWC1 + lymphocytes were in the epithelium. In the proximal, mid and distal small intestine, the ratio of lamina propria to intraepithelial lymphocytes was 4.6: 1, 3.4:1 and 7.7:1 for BoCD4 cells, 1:4.1, 1:6.4 and 1:4.6 for BoCD8 + cells and 1:2.3, 1:3.1 and 1:4.0 for BoWC1 +cells.\n\nThe majority of cells in the lamina propria were BoCD4 +, while most intraepithelial lymphocytes were BoCD8 + except in the distal small intestine where there were eqivalent numbers of BoCD8 + and BoWC 1 +. In the proximal, mid and distal small intestine, the ratio of BoCD4 + : BoCD8 + :BoWC 1 + cells in the epithelium was 1:4.3: 1.8, 1.1:2.2:1 and 1:6.9:7.1, and in the lamina propria 5.9: 1.3: 1, 15.0: 1.3:1 and 4.8: 1: 1.5.\n\nInfected villi were present throughout the small intestine in calves killed on 2, 4 and 6 days post inoculation. Infected villi were not detected in sections from control calves or from calves killed 8 and 10 days after inoculation. In calves killed 2 days after inoculation, the percentage of infected villi did not exceed 4%. The greatest amount of viral antigen was found in the mid and distal small intestine 4 days after inoculation, where up to 85% of villi were infected (Fig. 1 ) . The percentage of infected villi in calves killed 6 days after inoculation was less than 12% in all small intestinal samples, except for Sites 6 and 7 in one calf where 45% and 42% villi were infected. The number of infected enterocytes per villus were greatest at those intestinal sites where the largest percentage of infected villi were detected. \n\nBoCD4 + lymphocytes The number of intraepithelial BoCD4 + ceils in animals inoculated with rotavirus was increased above the upper limit of control animals in three of nine calves (33%) in the proximal and mid small intestine, and in five of nine calves (56%) in the distal small intestine (Figs. 2 (a)-2 (c)). These increases ranged from 1.68 to 3.77 times the mean of control animals with the levels increasing distally along the intestine and with the majority of increases occurring 6-I 0 days post inoculation.\n\nLamina propria BoCD4 + lymphocytes were increased in number in inoculated calves above the upper limit of control values in four of 27 (15%) measurements (Figs. 3 (a)-3 (c)) with increases ranging between 2.07 and 3.17 times the mean of control animals and occurring 2-6 days post inoculation.\n\nIntraepithelial BoCD8 + cells were increased in number in the proximal small intestine in three of nine (33%) calves, in the mid in six of nine (67%) calves and in the distal small intestine in seven of nine (78%) inoculated calves (Figs. 2(d) -2(f)) . These increases ranged from 1.35 to 5.34 times the mean of control animals with the greatest increases in the mid and distal small intestine and with the majority of increases occurring 6-10 days post inoculation.\n\nThe number of lamina propria BoCD8 + lymphocytes were increased above the upper limit of control animals in the proximal small intestine in six of (Figs. 3 (d)-3 (f) ). These increases were greater than seen elsewhere and ranged from 1.03 to 5.92, 2.20 to 31.84 and 3.30 to 9.27 times the mean of control animals in the proximal, mid and distal small intestine respectively. Three-quarters of these increases occurred 6-10 days post inoculation.\n\nThe most striking increase in the number of BoWC 1 + lymphocytes was observed in the epithelium of the distal small intestine where the numbers in seven of nine calves ( 78% ) exceeded the upper limit of control animals (Fig.  2 (i) ). Increases were observed in the proximal small intestine in five of nine (56%) calves and in the mid in three of nine (33%) calves (Figs. 2(g) and 2 (h) ). Numbers ranged from 1.70 to 3.80 times the mean of control animals and were observed from 2 days post inoculation onwards.\n\nLamina propria BoWC1 + lymphocytes were increased in number in the inoculated calves above the upper limit of control animals in eight of 27 (30%) measurements (Figs. 3 (g)-3 (i)). Numbers ranged from 1.63 to 7.15 times the mean of control calves with the majority of increases occurring 8-10 days post inoculation.\n\nQuantitation of lymphocytes in the mucosa of control calves demonstrated that, as in man, most CD4 + cells are found in the lamina propria and the majority of CD8 + lymphocytes are located in the epithelium (Brandtzaeg et al., 1988; Ernst et al., 1985 ) . Bovine BoWC1 \u00f7 ~/~ T cells were more numerous in the epithelium than lamina propria, providing further evidence that 7/ T lymphocytes associate with mucosal surfaces (Lefrancois, 1991 ) . In addition, this study has shown that while most intraepithelial lymphocytes in the proximal and mid small intestine were CD8 +, equivalent numbers of intraepithelial BoCD8 \u00f7 and BoWC 1 \u00f7 cells were found in the distal small intestine of calves.\n\nMAb CC63, used to detect BoCD8 \u00f7 cells, identifies the o~ chain of the CD8 molecule and recognises both CD8a/a and CD8o~/ fl T cells. The CD8o~ chain has also been detected on a cloned cell line with non-specific killer activity (Goddeeris et al., 1991) and on BoCD2+BoWC 1-7/O'TcR + T cells (Sopp et al., 1991 ) . Natural killer (NK) cells capable of non-specific cytotoxicity are CD8 + in some species (Trinchieri, 1989 ) and non-specific cytotoxicity has been detected in cattle (Cook and Splitter, 1989; Godson et al., 1991 ) , but expression of CD8 was not determined. The CD8 \u00f7 cells which were increased in number in the epithelium and lamina propria in the mid and lower small intestine, the site of most rotavirus infection, were probably cytotoxic T cells because these lymphocytes have been associated with rotavirus infection in mice. It is possible that some or all were other cell types expressing CD8; CD8 + ~/~ TCR + T cells and homodimeric CD8 \u00f7 T cells have been detected by flow cytometry amongst bovine intraepithelial lymphocytes (Parsons et al., 1993a) . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes cleared rotavirus infection in SCID mice (Dharakul et al., 1990 ) and mice were passively protected from rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis by adoptive transfer of immune CD8 \u00f7 lymphocytes (Offit and Dudzik, 1990) . The influx of BoCD8 \u00f7 cells was not immediate and the increase in numbers with time after inoculation was more typical of a specific immune response by cytotoxic lymphocytes than a non-specific response by NK cells (Welsh, 1978) .\n\nMAb CC15 recognises a 215/300 kDa antigen (WC1) present on about 90% of peripheral blood 7/~ TCR + T lymphocytes (Parsons et al., 1993b) .\n\nThree mAbs that appear to identify all bovine 7/~ T cells in peripheral blood by flow cytometry unfortunately do not immunostain cells in cryostat sections (Parsons et al., 1993 ) . In peripheral blood the small population of ~,/~ TCR \u00f7 cells that are WC1-are mostly BoCD2+BoCD6+BoCD8 \u00f7 (Sopp et al., 1991 ) . The function of T lymphocytes expressing the ~/~ T cell receptor (TcR) is unknown. In man and mice, 7/~ T cells are associated with epithelial surfaces and are considered to be MHC-unrestricted, but may recognise antigen presented by other molecules found on epithelial cells (Balk et al., 1991; Wu et al., 1991; Kronenberg et al., 1992) . The timing and location of these increases in T lymphocyte subsets is indicative of a specific immune response involving BoCD8 \u00f7 and BoWC1 \u00f7 lym-phocytes and this response may have been involved in the clearance of primary rotavirus infection."}
