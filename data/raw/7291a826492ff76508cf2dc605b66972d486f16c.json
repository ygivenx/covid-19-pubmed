{"title": "", "body": "Seizures are generated by paroxysmal excessive discharge of thalamocortical neurons which are rendered focally or diffusely hyperexcitable by several mechanisms: \u2022 Structural brain lesions, either active (e.g. encephalitis, tumor) or inactive (e.g. glial scar), irritate the surrounding neurons and transform them into transient or permanent epileptic foci; some areas of the brain are more likely to generate seizures (e.g. frontal and temporal lobes) than others (e.g. occipital lobe).\n\n\u2022 In idiopathic epilepsy, no causes other than a genetic predisposition underlie the intrinsic neuronal disturbances. \u2022 Extracranial causes of seizures (metabolic and toxic) diffusely affect the brain.\n\nThe clinical appearance of seizures varies a great deal, depending on the origin and extent of spreading of the seizure discharge within the brain.\n\nPrimary generalized seizures have a diffuse onset within both cerebral hemispheres.\n\n\u2022 They manifest with a complete loss of consciousness and generalized, symmetrical and usually violent tonic and/or clonic motor activity that results in complete recumbency often with thrashing and limb pad-CAT WITH SIGNS OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE PART 10 798 \u2022 Feline immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy (p 819) Usually asymptomatic, but may cause subtle and non-specific behavioral changes such as depression, social withdrawal and roaming.\n\n\u2022 Toxoplasmosis** (p 815) Focal or multifocal CNS signs are rare signs accompanying the more common systemic signs such as fever, or dyspnea or ocular manifestations (anterior uveitis, chorioretinitis) of the disease.\n\nCerebral signs such as depression, circling and ataxia are often accompanied by chronic nasal discharge, cutaneous nodules or ulcers, or ocular signs including chorioretinitis, retinal detachment and panophthalmitis.\n\nRare in cats and occurs as recurrent generalized motor seizures starting with single seizures at several week intervals in a young adult animal that has no other neurological signs or deficits.\n\nPeracute onset of cerebral signs such as confusion to dementia, pacing, circling or hemiparesis. Immediate onset of seizures and/or post-traumatic epilepsy may occur.\n\nTypically present with signs of depression or stimulation of the CNS (depression, agitation), together with autonomic system signs (miosis, hypersalivation) and neuromuscular signs (weakness, muscle tremors). Occasionally, convulsive status epilepticus. continued dling. This is often accompanied by jaw champing, facial twitching and autonomic signs (e.g. mydriasis, hypersalivation, piloerection, micturition). \u2022 In partial (focal) seizures with secondary generalization, the seizure is preceded by behavioral change (aura) or localized or lateralized motor signs or followed by motor deficits.\n\nPartial (focal) seizures have a focal onset in one cerebral hemisphere and a limited propagation within one or both hemispheres.\n\n\u2022 They manifest with variable degrees of alteration of consciousness ranging from normal to totally absent awareness and responsiveness. \u2022 Partial (focal) seizures have motor signs that may be either lateralized to one side of the body, localized to one part of the body, or may even be generalized but not violent enough to cause complete recumbency (e.g. mild tremors of the whole body).\n\n-Lateralized signs include unilateral facial twitching, tonic or clonic movements of one or both limbs on one side, and spasmodic turning of the head to one side. -Signs localized to one part of the body include hindlimb weakness causing difficulty or inability walking, and bilateral facial twitching with or without spasmodic head bobbing. \u2022 Partial (focal) seizures of cats are often subtle and/or bizarre and may be difficult to recognize as being seizure activity. \u2022 Some partial (focal) seizures previously called psychomotor seizures mainly manifest with bizarre stereotypical and behavioral activities (e.g. hallucinatory prey or predator behavior with running fits). \u2022 Seizures preceded by an aura (behavioral changes within a few seconds or minutes of the ictus onset) or followed by localized post-ictal motor deficits (e.g. hemiparesis) are partial in onset, even if they appear to be generalized from the beginning of the ictus. \u2022 Partial (focal) seizures may secondarily generalize to tonic-clonic generalized seizures and this may occur so quickly that their initial partial phase may not be observed clinically; most generalized seizures of cats are probably within that category. \u2022 The occurrence of partial seizures usually indicates that there is a focal forebrain lesion which excludes the possibility of idiopathic (genetic) epilepsy and extracranial (metabolic and toxic) causes of seizures.\n\nSeizures must be differentiated from seizure-like events such as syncopes, sleep disorders (e.g. excessive dream-like movements), movement disorders (e.g. myoclonia, tremors-tetany), narcolepsy-cataplexy, episodic behavioral disorders (e.g. fly catching, feline hyperesthesia), dysphoric and agitated anesthetic recovery, and paddling associated with decerebration.\n\nCompulsive circling is usually accompanied by mental confusion with either depression or agitation. It is often associated with wandering, pacing and sometimes with an abnormal posture (head and eye deviation or turning, leaning).\n\n\u2022 Compulsive circling must be differentiated from vestibular circling which is due to marked loss of balance.\n\n-The cat with compulsive circling does not have a head tilt (its head may however be turned), loss of balance, nystagmus and other vestibular signs. It usually has a normal gait (no detectable ataxia nor paresis) and often can walk in a straight line when it is motivated to do so (e.g. reach a specific goal such as a food plate).\n\nPersonality and behavioral changes due to forebrain diseases must be differentiated from pure behavioral disorders.\n\nForebrain (thalamocortex) diseases can cause any of the following signs: \u2022 Mentation abnormalities ranging from depression to semi-stupor, or confusion. \u2022 Subtle personality changes (e.g. loss of good or bad habits) to obvious behavioral abnormalities (e.g. dementia, aggression). \u2022 Abnormal activities such as wandering, propulsive pacing, head pressing and compulsive circling. \u2022 Seizures. \u2022 Mild contralateral hemiparesis and proprioceptive loss causes either subtle gait abnormalities (e.g. knuckling) or is only detected as postural reaction deficits (e.g. proprioceptive positioning, hopping, lateral tactile limb placing). \u2022 Central visual loss either causes the cat to bump into things, or is only detected by a deficit in the menace response together with normal pupillary light reflexes in the contralateral eye when the affected eye is tested.\n\n\u2022 Impaired facial sensation is detected by decreased head withdrawal when the contralateral nasal septum, upper lip or whiskers are touched.\n\nLarge or diffuse forebrain lesions (e.g. tumors, edema) may cause signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g. marked depression, bilateral miosis); this may evolve to tentorial herniation with signs of brainstem compression (e.g. coma, unresponsive mydriasis, abnormal respiratory patterns and death by respiratory arrest).\n\nMost cats with seizures have a structural forebrain lesion that may be active (e.g. encephalitis, tumor, ischemic encephalopathy) or inactive (e.g. postischemic glial scar). Extracranial causes of seizures (e.g. metabolic, toxic) and idiopathic epilepsy are rare.\n\nCompulsive circling may be caused by lesions affecting the rostral thalamus or frontal lobe and is usually toward the side of the lesion. Most common causes are neoplasia, trauma and ischemic encephalopathy.\n\nPersonality and behavioral changes result from lesions affecting the limbic system and associated areas of frontal and temporal lobes. Most common causes are neoplasia, trauma, ischemic encephalopathy, feline infectious peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, clinical examinations, CSF analysis (reference values in cats are a protein concentration \u2264 0.36 g/L (0.036 mg/dl) and a leukocyte count \u2264 0.002 cells/10 9 (2/\u03bcl) with the majority of cells being mononuclear cells), brain imaging and other ancillary tests.\n\n\u2022 Recurrent seizures are the only problem.\n\n\u2022 The initial seizure frequency is low but may increase over time. \u2022 Seizures are partial in onset with or without secondary generalization.\n\nLikely symptomatic epilepsy is common in cats.\n\nIt is most often caused by an acquired focal thalamocortical lesion that is no longer active but has transformed into an epileptic focus by irritating the surrounding neurons.\n\n\u2022 Following an insult to the brain such as trauma, encephalitis or ischemia, the glial reaction may result in a persistent glial focus, which irritates the surrounding neurons. \u2022 Seizure onset is usually delayed by a few to several months from an initial brain insult. The insult may have occurred in utero (e.g. porencephalic [cystic] lesions due to fetal encephalitis), at birth (e.g. dystocia-related cerebrovascular accidents) or later in life at any age. Post-natal diseases may have been symptomatic (e.g. encephalitis, ischemic encephalopathy, head trauma) or asymptomatic (e.g. atypical form of ischemic encephalopathy, non-suppurative meningoencephalitis). \u2022 Symptomatic seizures occurring during the active phase of a cerebral disease may or may not lead to likely symptomatic epilepsy, depending on the extent of secondary gliosis.\n\nOther rare congenital or inherited focal cerebral anomalies may also act as epileptic foci. These include lesions associated with surrounding gliosis (e.g. vascular malformations such as angiomas and arteriovenous malformations) or with intrinsic neuronal hyperexcitability (e.g. disorders of neuronal migration such as cortical dysplasia and heterotopias). \u2022 Seizures usually start during adolescence or young adulthood.\n\nThe initial seizure frequency usually is low with single seizures occurring at intervals of several weeks to months. The subsequent seizure frequency often remains low but may progressively increase over months or years due to a self-perpetuating electrical kindling-like phenomenon. This sometimes leads to intractable seizures with frequent and severe cluster seizures and status epilepticus.\n\nSeizures are partial (focal) with or without secondary generalization. Secondary generalization may sometimes occur so quickly that no features of partial seizures may be detected clinically.\n\n\u2022 Seizures preceded by an aura (behavioral changes a few seconds or minutes before the onset of ictus) or followed by localized post-ictal motor deficits (e.g. hemiparesis) are partial, even if they appear to be generalized from their onset.\n\nOther static neurological signs (e.g. personality changes) and/or thalamocortical deficits (e.g. menace, facial sensation, postural reactions) may or may not be present, depending on the size and location of the lesion.\n\nThere may be a history of neurological signs a few to several months before the seizure onset (initial cerebral insult). These signs should have improved or resolved; if not, an active brain disease is likely.\n\nNeurological examination may be normal or reveal thalamocortical deficits that are often subtle; the responses obtained from both sides of the body must be carefully compared.\n\nCSF analysis is usually normal. Mild non-specific degenerative changes such as an increased proportion of macrophages despite a normal leukocyte count may sometimes persist for months after the initial cerebral insult (e.g. trauma, ischemic encephalopathy).\n\nBrain imaging may identify an inactive lesion; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography.\n\nIn many cases with clinical evidence of likely symptomatic epilepsy (e.g. partial seizures, non-progressive focal thalamocortical deficits), the underlying cause remains unknown because the CSF analysis and brain MRI are normal. Such epilepsy previously classified as cryptogenic (hidden cause) is now called \"likely symptomatic\" epilepsy.\n\nExclusion of other causes of seizures is often possible based on the history and clinical examination, even before any ancillary tests are performed.\n\n\u2022 Active brain diseases often cause a higher initial seizure frequency, including cluster seizures and status epilepticus, and a rapid progression toward high-frequency seizures within the first few weeks or months. A regressive course may occur with selflimiting conditions. Other progressive (or regressive) neurological signs and deficits, and abnormal CSF and/or brain imaging findings reflecting an active disease process are also likely to be present. \u2022 Idiopathic (genetic) epilepsy causes primary generalized seizures that begin in young adult cats that have no other neurological signs and deficits (see page 816). \u2022 Intoxications typically cause an acute onset of severe convulsive status epilepticus or cluster seizures that is usually preceded by signs of other body systems (e.g. vomiting) as well as diffuse neurological signs (e.g. mental depression, hyperexcitability, tremors). There are no periods of normalcy in between the seizures, which continue until appropriate treatment is provided or until death occurs (see page 812). \u2022 Metabolic causes produce a high initial seizure frequency. Metabolic causes may be excluded when there are no other signs of metabolic disorders preceding and following the seizures (e.g. severe and classical signs of hepatoencephalopathy, hypocalcemic tremors -tetany, hypoglycemic weakness and confusion). They can also be excluded when there are partial seizures or focal (unilateral, asymmetrical) neurological signs or deficits. Metabolic diseases, like intoxications, produce generalized seizures and bilateral and symmetrical neurological dysfunction.\n\nAggressive but rational anti-epileptic drug therapy is mandatory if there is more than one single seizure every 6-8 weeks.\n\n\u2022 Start phenobarbital 1.5-2.5 mg/kg PO q 12 h.\n\n-Measure serum phenobarbital concentration 14 days after treatment initiation and after any dosage modification. Measure trough level, that is, just prior to next treatment. Adjust the dosage to obtain an optimal phenobarbital concentration of 100-130 \u03bcmol/ml (23-32 \u03bcg/ml) using the formula: optimal dosage = optimal phenobarbital concentration \u00f7 actual phenobarbital concentration \u00d7 actual dosage. \u2022 Add diazepam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg q 12 h) if seizures are not well controlled (if > 1 seizure/6-8 weeks) despite an optimal phenobarbital concentrations 14 days after treatment initiation or change in drug dose.\n\n\u2022 Measure serum benzodiazepine concentration at steady state (reached within 4-5 days) and adjust the dosage to obtain at least 500-700 nmol/L (ng/L); use the same formula as for phenobarbital.\n\n-Also measure liver enzymes to detect rare idiosyncratic acute hepatic necrosis induced by diazepam in cats. \u2022 Add gabapentin 10-40 mg/cat q 8 h if seizures are still not well controlled despite optimal phenobarbital concentrations and benzodiazepine concentrations.\n\n- Anti-epileptic drug therapy is likely to be required for life. Only if the cat remains seizure-free for longer than 6-12 months should slow weaning from drugs be attempted. Weaning should occur over a few months with one drug at a time. If more than one seizure/8 weeks recurs during or after drug withdrawal, resume treatment.\n\n\u2022 Status epilepticus and cluster seizures require emergency treatment.\n\n-First give a diazepam bolus of 0.5 mg/kg IV.\n\nRepeat if the seizure has not stopped within 1-2 minutes or if another one begins. -Immediately start a diazepam constant rate IV infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h to prevent seizure recurrence. -Mix the diazepam in an in-line burette with maintenance fluids. Prepare only 1-2 hour supply at a time as diazepam is rapidly adsorbed into the plastic tubing and is inactivated by exposure to light. -When no seizures have occurred after 4-6 hours, slowly decrease the infusion rate (25% steps every 4-6 hours). -If > 2 seizures occur during the diazepam infusion, either give another diazepam bolus (0.5 mg/kg) and increase the diazepam infu-sion (to 0.75-1.0 mg/kg/h), or give a phenobarbital IV bolus (2-5 mg/kg) and add phenobarbital to the diazepam infusion (0.5-1 mg/kg/h) for at least 4-6 hours before attempting to decrease it. Because it takes at least 20 minutes for a phenobarbital IV bolus to exert its anticonvulsant effect, sustained seizure activity must be controlled with diazepam in the mean time.\n\n-If phenobarbital is to be started as a maintenance anti-epileptic drug, a loading dose of 15-20 mg/kg (slow IV bolus) may be given to immediately achieve a therapeutic serum concentration of 60-110 \u03bcmol/L (15-25 \u03bcg/ml). Maintenance dosing should be continued afterwards (2.5 mg/kg q 12 h PO or IM if the cat is sedated to the point it is unable to safely swallow). Phenobarbital is potentiated by diazepam. Close monitoring of the patient must be done when adding phenobarbital to diazepam. -If the cat is already treated with chronic oral phenobarbital therapy and its phenobarbital concentration is known to be sub-therapeutic, it can be immediately increased by administering an IV bolus; each 1 mg/kg IV bolus will increase the phenobarbital concentrations by 5 \u03bcmol/L (1 \u03bcg/ml). \u2022 If seizures are not adequately controlled, propofol at sub-anesthetic dosage can be administered.\n\nUse an IV bolus of 1.0-3.5 mg/kg plus a continuous IV infusion of 0.01-0.25 mg/kg/min, to effect, for several hours (up to 12-48 hours, if necessary) before attempting weaning. \u2022 If high-frequency or sustained convulsive seizures persist despite the above treatment, proceed to general anesthesia with pentobarbital (5-15 mg/kg slow IV over several minutes, to effect; wait 10 minutes to see maximal effect before giving more).\n\n-Add an IV continuous rate infusion of 5 mg/kg/h for at least 6 hours if other seizures occur afterwards. -Intubation and ventilation are recommended as well as close anesthetic monitoring (temperature, blood pressure, etc.). -Isoflurane anesthesia is the last resort for refractory seizures. It should be done for at least a few hours.\n\nGood seizure control is often obtained with appropriate anti-epileptic drug therapy. Progression toward intractability may however occur despite adequate treatment and indicates a poor prognosis.\n\n\u2022 Focal or multifocal CNS signs.\n\n\u2022 Seizures.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally, generalized tremors (\"shaker cat syndrome\").\n\nA viral infection is suspected even though the condition does not appear to be contagious. Signs are usually confined to a single cat in a household.\n\n\u2022 Several feline (e.g. herpesvirus type I) and nonfeline (e.g. arboviruses) viruses may infect the CNS of cats and produce a subclinical or clinical meningoencephalitis.\n\nAn immune-mediated process is also possible. This can be primary (idiopathic autoimmune) or secondary to various antigenic stimulation such as vaccination, CNS infection with a non-pathogenic virus or infection in another system.\n\nCats of any age and with or without outdoor access may be affected.\n\nThe clinical course is variable with an acute or insidious onset and a static, progressive or regressive course.\n\nThe disease can produce focal or multifocal signs of variable severity attributable to any portion of the CNS; central vestibular (head tilt, balance losses, mental depression, postural reaction deficits), spinal cord (hindlimb proprioceptive ataxia and paresis), cerebellar and cranial nerve signs are most common and may occur alone or in any combination.\n\n\u2022 Seizures may occur alone or with other signs during the active phase of the disease. They may present with the full spectrum of severity. \u2022 Delayed onset post-encephalitic secondary epilepsy may also occur after a symptomatic or an asymptomatic course of the disease.\n\nA steroid-responsive \"shaker cat syndrome\" similar to the \"little white dog shaker syndrome\" has been observed as the only clinical manifestation of the disease in a few cats.\n\nSystemic signs including fever, inappetence, lymphadenopathy and mild hematological abnormalities (e.g. leukopenia, lymphocytosis, anemia) may sometimes precede or accompany the neurological signs. Ocular signs (e.g. chorioretinitis) may also be seen.\n\nCSF analysis may be normal or reveal a mild increase of the protein concentration (< 0.70 g/L) and/or a mononuclear pleocytosis (< 50 cells/\u03bcl) with numerous small lymphocytes and/or large foamy mononuclear cells.\n\nBrain imaging (MRI) may be normal or show inflammatory lesions with contrast uptake. Obstructive or compensatory hydrocephalus and porencephalic (cystic) lesions may sometimes be seen.\n\nOther infectious encephalitis (e.g. FIP, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis) when there are other systemic signs, ocular involvement or a progressive course.\n\n\u2022 CSF analysis is the best test to differentiate the disease from FIP. Cats with FIP usually have a higher CSF protein concentration and cell count with a predominance of neutrophils (see page 844). Toxoplasmosis can however produce similar CSF changes. Rarely, cryptococcosis may produce only mild CSF inflammation but culture and titers help with diagnosis when the organism is not visible in the CSF. Usually signs are rapidly progressive with cryptococcosis.\n\nOther causes of seizures in cats should be considered when seizures are the only sign of the disease (e.g. idiopathic and likely symptomatic epilepsies).\n\nTreatment is generally supportive to ensure fluid, electrolyte and nutritional requirements are met.\n\nSymptomatic anti-epileptic drug therapy should be instituted in cats with seizures (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 802).\n\nGlucocorticosteroids such as dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg q 24 h to be decreased over a few weeks to months) may be beneficial in immune-mediated cases, but could be deleterious if a pathogenic virus is involved.\n\nThe prognosis is often excellent as signs resolve spontaneously over weeks or months. Sometimes it is poor because of progressive deterioration leading to death or euthanasia.\n\n\u2022 Peracute onset unilateral forebrain signs (mental depression/confusion, compulsive circling, hemiparesis) \u00b1 seizures. \u2022 Personality changes and/or post-ischemic epilepsy several months later.\n\nAn ischemic cerebral infarction typically occurs in the parietal-temporal field of one cerebral hemisphere which controls contralateral sensorial (proprioceptive, nociceptive) and motor function as well as behavior. Secondary edema and necrosis lead to atrophy and gliosis.\n\n\u2022 The lesion is usually unilateral, although it can be bilateral but markedly asymmetrical. \u2022 A vasospasm phenomenon of the middle cerebral artery is suspected but its pathogenesis remains unknown. Cuterebra larval migration has been incriminated as a cause.\n\nYoung adults to middle-aged cats are usually affected.\n\nThe classical form of the disease is seen with large ischemic lesions that may involve up to two thirds of an hemisphere.\n\nTypically, there is peracute onset of severe and unilateral forebrain signs usually including mental depression, pacing, circling, hemiparesis, and deficits in the menace response, facial sensation and postural reactions.\n\n\u2022 Rarely, seizures occur and may initially be difficult to control (e.g. cluster seizures or status epilepticus). \u2022 Rapid neurological improvement occurs in the first 24-72 hours. Good recovery and minimal residual signs and deficits occur within a few weeks in most cases.\n\n-Rare complications that lead to neurological deterioration in the first 24 hours and sometimes to death or euthanasia include hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure, tentorial herniation and intractable seizures. -Personality changes, especially a more or less affectionate behavior and tolerant attitude towards other animals, or for grooming, nail cliping, etc., may become apparent as the initial signs resolve. -Persistent seizures or delayed onset of postischemic secondary epilepsy may occur, but appear to be unusual.\n\nThe atypical form of the disease is caused by small and superficial ischemic lesions that often do not cause any clinical signs at the time of the infarction. \u2022 A few seizures and/or personality changes may however occur. \u2022 Delayed onset post-ischemic secondary epilepsy may be the only clinical manifestation. This may be a common cause of seizure disorders in cats.\n\n-The seizures are usually of low to moderate frequency initially and subsequently. \u2022 No or only subtle unilateral or occasionally asymmetric bilateral thalamocortical deficits may be detected in these cats.\n\nCSF analysis may be normal or reveal mild nonspecific degenerative changes (increased proportion of large foamy mononuclear cells) that may persist for several months after the infarction.\n\nBrain imaging (MRI is optimal) is the only means of antemortem diagnosis. It typically reveals the lesion in the parietal-temporal field of one cerebral hemisphere. A similar but much milder lesion may be seen in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe typical form of the disease must be differentiated from the following:\n\n\u2022 Cerebrovascular accidents are rare in cats and older animals are at greater risk. They may be associated with hypertension due to renal insufficiency, hyperthyroidism or blood hyperviscosity due to polycythemia vera. \u2022 Head trauma is differentiated by the history and external signs of trauma to the head and face area. \u2022 Sudden decompensation or hemorrhage associated with a cerebral tumor is usually seen in older cats with other preceding neurological signs, especially mentation and behavioral changes. A progressive rather than a regressive course would be expected afterwards. \u2022 Acute and severe encephalitides (infectious and non-infectious) are more likely to produce initially progressive multifocal or diffuse signs.\n\nIn cats with the atypical form of ischemic encephalopathy with personality changes or seizures as the only sign, behavioral disorders and other intracranial causes of seizures such as idiopathic epilepsy, active brain diseases must be investigated.\n\nTreatment is symptomatic.\n\n\u2022 To reduce cerebral edema and intracranial pressure in the typical form of ischemic encephalopathy, give: -Glucocorticosteroids (methylprednisolone sodium succinate [SoluMedrol\u00ae] 30 mg/kg IV or dexamethasone phosphate 0.25 mg/kg IV). -Furosemide (0.5-2.0 mg/kg IV) may be preferred to or combined with glucocorticosteroids when neurological signs are mild (mental depression/confusion, miotic pupils).\n\n-Mannitol 25% (0.5-2.0 g/kg slow IV over 20-30 minutes) may be indicated in severe cases (semi-stupor, pinpoint pupils). \u2022 To control seizures, give anti-epileptic drugs (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 802).\n\nThe prognosis is excellent in most cases.\n\n\u2022 Persistent personality changes are usually mild, but rarely they may make the animal unsuitable as a pet, for example severe aggression. \u2022 Post-ischemic epilepsy is usually well controlled with adequate anti-epileptic drug therapy.\n\nRecurrences of infarction are not reported to occur.\n\n\u2022 Focal or diffuse forebrain signs (mentation depression and confusion, central visual deficits with normal pupillary light reflexes, proprioceptive positioning and hopping deficits). \u2022 Abnormal development and behavior. \u2022 Occasionally, seizures.\n\nCongenital hydrocephalus is uncommon and rarely symptomatic in cats. It may be primary (e.g. inherited) or secondary, for example obstructive and/or compensatory following fetal encephalitis. Signs are diffuse and mainly due to a lack of formation or loss of cerebral tissue, although intracranial pressure elevation may sometimes contribute to the signs.\n\nLysosomal storage diseases are inherited, progressive and lethal multisystemic degenerative disorders that often involve the CNS of young to adolescent kittens under 1 year of age. Initial signs are often attributable to cerebellar dysfunction.\n\nLissencephaly-pachygyria is due to an abnormal migration of cerebrocortical neurons. It usually causes learning disabilities, sometimes with behavioral abnormalities and seizures.\n\nDermoid cysts and other tumors of embryonic origin, for example teratomas and germ cell tumors, produce progressive focal forebrain signs that often become complicated by an increased intracranial pressure and/or secondary obstructive hydrocephalus.\n\nLikely symptomatic epilepsy may be the only neurological sign in cats with small focal and inactive brain lesions (e.g. cysts, cortical dysplasia) (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 801).\n\nForebrain signs including mentation abnormalities, compulsive pacing or circling, central visual deficits with normal pupillary light reflexes and hemiparesis are present since birth, young kittenhood or early adult life. Neurological deficits and signs can be focal or diffuse, and static or progressive, depending on the underlying pathological process. \u2022 Extensive or diffuse forebrain anomalies such as hydrocephalus or lissencephaly-pachygyria may manifest with retarded development, learning disability, loss of training, mental depression, abnormal behavior and visual deficits.\n\n-Severe hydrocephalus may also cause gait abnormalities as a result of cerebellar and brainstem distortion, as well as pacing and head pressing, especially when the intracranial pressure is elevated.\n\nSymptomatic seizures may occasionally occur but usually are preceded by other signs of the anomaly (e.g. of hydrocephalus, tumors of embryonic origin, lysosomal storage diseases, lissencephaly-pachygyria).\n\nLikely symptomatic epilepsy may occur. Seizures typically are initially of low frequency and are partial in origin, but can secondarily generalize to tonic-clonic seizures (see Secondary epilepsy, page 800).\n\nFacial and head deformities may be apparent with hydrocephalus, for example a domed calvaria with open suture lines and fontanelles.\n\nCSF analysis is likely to be normal or only reveal mild non-specific degenerative changes.\n\nBrain MRI will often show the underlying anomaly, for example porencephalic lesions.\n\nOther specific tests, for example, ultrasonography through open fontanelles for hydrocephalus, enzymatic assays and biopsies of peripheral nerves or other organs for some lysosomal storage diseases are useful for obtaining a definitive diagnosis.\n\nAcquired forebrain diseases affecting young cats such as FIP and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis usually have a subacute onset and a rapidly progressive (or regressive) clinical course.\n\nHepatoencephalopathy due to portosystemic shunting would be distinguished by its episodic nature.\n\nAnti-epileptic drug therapy should be instituted for likely symptomatic epilepsy (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 802).\n\nSymptomatic medical treatment including glucocorticosteroids and surgical shunting for hydrocephalus is poorly documented in cats.\n\nLysosomal storage diseases are currently untreatable.\n\nPrognosis is usually guarded to poor, with the exception of secondary epilepsy, which may be successfully controlled with anti-epileptic drugs.\n\n\u2022 Episodes of hypersalivation, abnormal mentation and bizarre behavior.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy results when endogenous toxins produced by the action of the gut microflora on alimentary proteins are not removed from the systemic circulation by the liver. When a critical toxin level is reached, diffuse cerebral dysfunction ensues.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy is most often due to a congenital portosystemic vascular shunt and signs are usually noticed during the first year of life.\n\nSevere acquired liver diseases also very occasionally cause hepatic encephalopathy in cats of any age. Other signs of liver disease will usually predominate including anorexia, weight loss and sometimes jaundice.\n\nNeurological signs are episodic. They develop then regress progressively over periods of a few to several hours.\n\n\u2022 Episodes may be precipitated by feeding, especially when a high-protein diet is ingested in large amounts. Several (up to 8-10) hours may however elapse between meal times and onset of signs. Signs do not follow each meal, especially early in the course of the disease. Several days and sometimes a few weeks may elapse between episodes.\n\nNeurological signs are of diffuse thalamocortical dysfunction:\n\n\u2022 Mentation abnormalities include depression, confusion, staring into space. \u2022 Bizarre behavioral activities may occur, for example pacing, head pressing, dementia with running fits, frantic vocalization and aggression. \u2022 Profuse salivation is common. This may last for several minutes to hours and may be the first and only sign early in the course of the disease. \u2022 Fine generalized muscle tremors (shivering). \u2022 Central blindness and ultimately stupor and coma may develop in the advanced stage of hepatic encephalopathy. \u2022 Episodes of dementia with frantic behavioral activities such as running fits, attacking inanimate objects and profuse salivation sometimes are misinterpreted as being seizure activity. True seizures are rare and usually occur as clustered seizures after the other classical and severe signs of hepatic encephalopathy have developed.\n\nSystemic signs may include polyuria, polydipsia, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria with hematuria (due to urate calculi) and delayed anesthetic recovery.\n\n\u2022 Cats with congenital portosystemic shunts may be thin and small for their age.\n\nOther physical and laboratory signs of liver failure will be obvious in cats with severe liver pathology.\n\nPre-and post-prandial bile acids are usually markedly increased.\n\nLaboratory abnormalities may include microcytic non-regenerative anemia, low albumin, urea and cholesterol concentrations, and urinary ammonium biurate crystals.\n\nFasting blood ammonia is markedly elevated in most (90%) cats with a portosystemic vascular shunt, especially during episodes of hepatoencephalopathy. This test is however inconvenient in most practices because blood samples must be drawn in cold heparinized tubes and immediately transported to an appropriate laboratory on ice for refrigerated centrifugation and assay, preferably within an hour of collection. False blood ammonia values may occur with hemolysis, prolonged venous occlusion and struggling at the time of venipuncture.\n\n\u2022 An ammonia tolerance test identifies virtually all cats with a portosystemic vascular shunt but may precipitate severe signs of hepatoencephalopathy. Cats with a shunt have a blood ammonia concentration 30 minutes post-challenge that is > three times higher than the fasting values.\n\nAbdominal radiographs may show a small liver in cats with congenital portosystemic shunt.\n\nAbdominal echography may allow visualization of a congenital portosystemic shunt or may detect diffuse liver disease.\n\nCats presented for bouts of hypersalivation are often erroneously diagnosed with a stomatitis, even though they may have no oral lesions. Ingestion of irritant substances or plants is another common misdiagnosis.\n\nSome intoxications may produce signs similar to those of hepatic encephalopathy including depression or agitation, but are not recurrent unless re-exposure to the toxin occurs.\n\nMedical treatment is aimed at reducing the production and absorption of endogenous colonic toxins. Maintenance therapy includes a low-protein diet (e.g. Surgical treatment including ligation or use of an occlusive device offers the best chance for long-term control of clinical signs. This must be performed by an experienced surgeon to decrease the risk of excessive ligation which may cause rapid post-operative death due to portal hypertension and bowel ischemia. Like in dogs, severe seizures may develop in the first few postoperative days, and some cats have remained epileptic for months and years afterwards.\n\nPrognosis is good if surgical treatment is feasible, for example with a single extrahepatic shunt, and is not complicated by portal hypertension. Recurrence of signs appears to be more common in cats than in dogs and occurs in more than 40-50% after a few years. It may be due to the persistence of shunting through a partially ligated vessel or the development of multiple secondary shunts because of chronic portal hypertension.\n\nPrognosis is guarded with medical treatment as the condition often worsens over time. \n\nHistory of feeding all-fish diets (containing thiaminase), diets consisting of entirely cooked meat (thiamine destruction by heating), poor-quality, thiamine-deficient commercial diets, commercial food stored for long periods of time or in excessively hot conditions or, pet meat preserved with sulfur dioxide which destroys thiamine.\n\nDepression and inappetence are initial signs. Later mydriasis with poor pupillary light response, but usually without blindness and central vestibular dysfunction occur with head tilt, loss of balance, spastic gait and tremors. Terminally, semicoma, crying, opisthotonos with limb spasticity and death result.\n\nTrue seizures are uncommon and must be differentiated from periods of opisthotonic posturing with paddling, and from the spasmodic ventroflexion of the neck and body contorsions that may be induced when the cat is picked from the ground. These are likely due to marked spatial disorientation because of the bilateral vestibular dysfunction.\n\nDiagnosis is based on a history of dietary deficiency and response to thiamine supplementation (10-20 mg thiamine IM q 8-12 h, then orally).\n\n\u2022 Peracute and rapidly resolving cerebral signs.\n\nCerebrovascular accidents are rare in cats.\n\nVascular events include spontaneous hemorrhage from coagulopathies, thrombocytopenia and hypertension associated with chronic renal failure and hyperthyroidism. They also include thrombosis (e.g. polycythemia hyperviscosity syndrome) and embolization including septic and metastatic from rapidly growing cell type tumors.\n\nPeracute onset of non-progressive and rapidly regressive focal cerebral signs, including seizures alone or with other signs.\n\n\u2022 Slight deterioration may occur over the first 24 hours as a result of edema or increased intracranial pressure before the condition improves. A rapidly progressive course is expected with septic and metastatic embolization.\n\nDiagnosis is based on a clinical course suggestive of a vascular event, that is, a peracute, onset of signs that improve rapidly.\n\nNeurological signs and deficits are attributable to a focal CNS lesion. Multifocal lesions are however possible, for example, hemorrhage due to coagulation disorders or thrombocytopenia, or multiple metastasis.\n\nEvidence of historical, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings related to the underlying cause such as polycythemia, hypertensive retinal changes, hyperthyroidism, abdominal tumor increase the index of suspicion when neurological findings are consistent with a vascular accident.\n\nThe classical form of the feline ischemic encephalopathy is a cerebrovascular accident that occurs in young adult to middle-aged healthy cats.\n\nAcutely decompensated brain tumor as occurs following spontaneous hemorrhage, or tentorial herniation may appear clinically similar.\n\nTreatment is specific if the cause is known and treatable.\n\nSupportive and symptomatic therapy is indicated to control secondary brain edema and increased intracranial pressure (see Feline ischemic encephalopathy, page 805 and Head trauma, page 818).\n\nThe prognosis depends on the severity of the neurological signs and the underlying cause and whether it is treatable or not.\n\nRecurrences may occur if the underlying cause persists (e.g. hypertension). The lesion localization is however likely to be different from one event to another.\n\nPost-ischemic gliosis may result in epilepsy.\n\n\u2022 Mental alteration, weakness, ataxia, visual loss. \u2022 Seizures.\n\nBecause blood glucose is the primary energy source for the CNS, hypoglycemia causes diffuse CNS dysfunction. The nature and severity of the neurological signs depend on the rate of blood glucose decrease, level of glucose attained and duration of hypoglycemia.\n\nSevere and symptomatic hypoglycemia is rare in cats except as a result of insulin over-dosage in diabetic cats. Rarely reported causes include insulin-secreting tumors, other tumors secreting insulin-like growth factor (IGF), sepsis and terminal hepatic disease.\n\nSigns may be episodic or persistent and include mentation abnormalities (e.g. depression, confusion, stupor), weakness, ataxia, central visual impairment and generalized seizures. Nervousness, muscle fasciculations and tremors may also occur. \u2022 Seizures more often occur when there is a sudden and marked decrease in the glucose concentration, and are usually preceded by other more subtle signs of hypoglycemia such as confusion and weakness.\n\nSevere and sustained hypoglycemia may cause diffuse cerebral anoxic injuries resulting in stupor-coma, decerebrate rigidity and miotic pupils. This may progress to irreversible damage (cortical necrosis) and permanent neurological sequela including blindness and secondary epilepsy.\n\nSerum glucose concentration is usually < 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl).\n\nOther historical, clinical and laboratory abnormalities may be evident, depending on the underlying cause.\n\nMore commonly, there is a history of diabetes mellitus treated with insulin or hypoglycemic drugs.\n\nOther episodic or peracute conditions such as metabolic disturbances, intoxications and encephalomyelitis should be considered depending on the clinical presentation. \n\nPrognosis is good unless the underlying cause is associated with a poor prognosis (e.g. neoplasia) or significant structural cerebral damage has occurred.\n\n\u2022 Progressive forebrain signs (personality changes, circling, pacing) in middle-aged and older cats. \u2022 Seizures.\n\nForebrain neoplasms cause progressive focal neurological signs, the nature and severity of which depend on the tumor location and growth rate. \u2022 Meningiomas are the most common. Other brain tumors of cats include gliomas, pituitary tumors, extension of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus neoplasms and metastatic brain tumors.\n\nInitial signs often include subtle personality and behavioral changes, mental depression, pacing and circling.\n\nSeizures may manifest as the first and only sign, occur concurrently with other signs or develop later. The initial seizure frequency is variable but is inevitably progressive.\n\nFocal signs such as contralateral hemiparesis with postural reaction deficits, visual loss and decreased facial sensation are often detected upon examination.\n\nTumors complicated with obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure cause more diffuse signs (e.g. profound depression, bilateral miosis). This may also lead to tentorial herniation which often develops slowly and remains asymptomatic until an acute decompensation is triggered by further tumor growth, spontaneous hemorrhage in or around the tumor, concomitant disease or stress, anesthesia and CSF collection.\n\n\u2022 Tentorial herniation resulting in brainstem compression produces coma, unresponsive mydriasis, abnormal respiratory patterns and death from respiratory arrest.\n\nSkull radiographs are likely to be unrewarding except for some meningiomas which may result in thinning or thickening of the adjacent calvaria and increased density of adjacent soft tissue, and neoplasms of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus which produce soft tissue density, osteolysis and bone proliferation.\n\nCSF analysis may reveal mild to moderate increase of the protein concentration and/or pleocytosis (elevated leukocyte count); CSF may be normal with small and deeply seated tumors.\n\n\u2022 CSF collection is contraindicated in cats with signs of increased intracranial pressure (marked mental depression, inappropriate miosis) because it may cause or exacerbate a tentorial herniation leading to death.\n\nBrain imaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis and to localize the tumor when surgical or radiation therapy is considered.\n\nOther focal and slowly progressive brain diseases are uncommon in cats (e.g. toxoplasma granuloma, cerebral abscess).\n\nMultiples tumors (e.g. meningiomas, metastases) may cause multifocal signs and must be differentiated from encephalitides.\n\nSurgical excision may be possible if the tumor is surgically accessible. Meningiomas on the dorsal surface of the cerebral hemispheres can be successfully removed.\n\nRadiation therapy is a useful adjunct to surgical debulking, or can be used alone when surgical excision is not possible.\n\nChemotherapy is poorly documented for brain tumors of cats. Lomustine (a nitrosourea) has been safely used in the cat.\n\nPalliative medical treatment using dexamethasone (0.12-0.25 mg/kg q 24-48 h) to decrease peritumoral edema.\n\nSymptomatic anti-epileptic drug therapy should be instituted in cats with seizures (see Secondary epilepsy, page 801).\n\nLong-term prognosis is poor except for convexity meningiomas (located on the dorsal surface of the cerebral hemispheres), which can often be completely excised with good survival, rapid recovery and low incidence of recurrence. Ocular signs are also common (e.g. chorioretinitis, anterior uveitis).\n\nTypically, there is an insidious onset and a slowly progressive course over weeks.\n\nUsually, cats are less than 3 years old and were obtained from a large multiple-cat household, breeder or pet store.\n\nCSF analysis is the most useful test when there are CNS signs; typically, there is a marked increase of the protein concentration (> 1 g/L; 100 mg/dl and often > 2 g/L; 200 mg/dl) and leukocyte count (> 100 cells/\u03bcl) with a large proportion of non-lytic neutrophils.\n\nSerological testing has been of little diagnostic value except that a negative test suggests the disease is unlikely to be FIP. However, negative test results do occur rarely in cats with FIP, especially in the terminal stages.\n\nThe ELISA that detects antibody to the 7B protein, which is specific to the coronavirus strains causing FIP has not been shown to improve accuracy of diagnosis in clinical practice. Newer PCR methods may be useful.\n\nOther infectious and non-infectious encephalitides, for example non-suppurative meningoencephalitis and toxoplasmosis need to be differentiated from FIP. CSF analysis may help to differentiate theses diseases.\n\nNo treatment is effective once neurological signs are present. Glucocorticosteroid may temporarily improve the neurological signs.\n\n\u2022 Chronic nasal discharge, often with nasal distortion. \u2022 Cutaneous lesions -nodules or ulcers. \u2022 Occasionally, ocular and CNS signs.\n\nWith Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease).\n\nInfection is by inhalation of the organism contained in high concentration in soil contaminated by pigeon droppings or eucalyptus tree debris.\n\nCNS infection occurs by direct extension through the cribriform plate or by hematogenous spread. A diffuse or focal granulomatous meningoencephalitis results.\n\nCNS signs can occur alone or with other signs (e.g. rhinitis, cutaneous lesions) and are usually rapidly progressive. \u2022 Most commonly, cats exhibit cerebral signs such as mental depression, behavioral changes, circling, head pressing and ataxia; seizures may occur with forebrain involvement but are unlikely to be the only sign. \u2022 Blindness with dilated and unresponsive pupils may occur due to optic neuritis.\n\nOcular signs including chorioretinitis, panophthalmitis, and retinal detachment are often associated with CNS involvement.\n\nCSF analysis may reveal mild to marked inflammatory changes, often with numerous cryptococcal organisms.\n\nSerology from blood, CSF, aqueous humor and urine is highly specific and sensitive.\n\nIdentification of the organism may be made by cytology, histology or culture of various body fluids and tissues including CSF, nasal discharge and polyp-like masses, skin lesions, enlarged lymph nodes.\n\nOther infectious encephalitides such as FIP and toxoplasmosis need to be differentiated from cryptococcosis. With cryptococcosis the organism is usually evident in CSF, although occasionally culture may be required to demonstrate it.\n\nFluconazole (2.5-10 mg/kg PO q 12 h) is best for CNS infections, or itraconazole (5 mg/kg PO q 12 h). See main reference on page 26 for treatment details.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded once CNS involvement occurs.\n\n\u2022 Signs of CNS, autonomic or neuromuscular stimulation or depression. \u2022 Rarely and terminally, convulsive status epilepticus.\n\nSigns of intoxications usually occur shortly after acute and accidental ingestion or topical contact. Cats' selective eating behavior is protective but their grooming habits may increase exposure.\n\nMost intoxicants cause functional disturbances for example conduction failure or neurotransmitter imbalance in various portions of the nervous system, although others cause structural damage.\n\nIntoxicants that may cause seizures include the following:\n\n\u2022 Pyrethrins and pyrethroids (e.g. fenvalerate, allethrin, tetramethrin, deltamethrin). Signs of intoxication usually occur a few minutes to hours after excessive topical application of anti-flea and tick sprays, powders, foam, dips and shampoos. \u2022 Organochlorines are used for pest control (e.g. lindane, methoxychlor, endosulfan, DDT, aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor, dicofol, endrin, perthane, toxaphen) and may contaminate water or food, or be absorbed through the skin and the mucous membranes. \u2022 Organophosphates (e.g. dichlorvos, malathion, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, parathion, phoxime, cythioate, diazinon, safrotin, phosmet, tetrachlorvinphos, diazinon) and carbamates (e.g. propoxur, carbaryl, bendiocarb, chlorprophane, buphame methomyl) are insecticides used in various formulations to control fleas, ticks and mites on pets, in the house and yard, on crops, stored grains, soils, and have also been used as fly, ant and roach baits. Intoxication occurs by ingestion, dermal exposure and after inhalation. \u2022 Bromethalin is a non-anticoagulant rodenticide available in bait form. Secondary intoxication due to the ingestion of bromethalin-poisoned rodents may occur. \u2022 Strychnine is a rodenticide marketed as pellets or treated seeds. \u2022 Methaldehyde is a molluscicide often mixed with bran flakes or pellets. \u2022 Lead is ingested in old paint flakes or paint dust from sanding, linoleums, roofing materials, plaster board, putty, artist paint, lead objects (drapery and fishing weights, sinkers, bullets), used motor oils from leaded gasoline-burning engines, greases leaded gazoline, eating or drinking from improperly glazed bowls. \u2022 Other intoxicants potentially dangerous for cats include penitrem mycotoxins (produced in spoiled dairy products such as cottage cheese), nicotine (gum and skin patches), caffeine, chocolate (theobromine) and illicit drugs (e.g. cocaine).\n\nMost intoxications are acute and produce diffuse and rapidly progressive neurological signs. These may be accompanied by signs of stimulation of other body systems, for example gastrointestinal with vomiting and/or diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 Neurological signs vary according to the intoxicant and include various combinations of CNS signs (e.g. mental depression to coma, hyperexcitability, tremors, ataxia, paresis), autonomic signs (e.g. hypersalivation, miosis, diarrhea) and neuromuscular signs (e.g. muscle fasciculationstremors, LMN signs). \u2022 True seizures are less common than generally believed and must be differentiated from other seizure-like features of poisoning such as tremors, tetany or hysterical behavior. Seizures usually manifest as convulsive status epilepticus that continues until treatment is provided or until death ensues.\n\n-Pyrethrins and pyrethroids intoxications are usually mild and resolve in most cases within 24-72 hours. Signs include depression, salivation, anorexia, vomiting, muscle tremors (ear flicking, contractions of the cutaneous muscles, paw shaking), hyperexcitability or hyperactivity, disorientation, weakness, ataxia, dyspnea and rarely, seizures and death. -Organochlorines produce progressive or explosive onset of hyperesthesia, nervousness, agitation, hyperexcitability, salivation, vomiting, tremors, ataxia, nystagmus, blindness, opisthotonos, convulsive seizures, depression, coma and death. -Organophosphates and carbamates inactivate acetylcholinesterase resulting in excessive activity and fatigue of cholinergic end-organs and muscles. This includes muscarinic signs (miosis, bradycardia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, lacrimation, dyspnea due to excessive bronchosecretions and bronchoconstriction, anorexia), nicotinic signs (muscle tremors, weakness), as well as CNS signs depression, behavioral changes, ataxia, hyperactivity, seizures). -Strychnine toxicity results in anxiousness and nervousness, extreme sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g. noise, bright light), muscle tremors, intermittent then sustained extensor rigidity with opisthotonos and tetany (pseudo-convulsions), hyperthermia and death by respiratory apnea and hypoxia. -Methaldehyde causes anxiety, restlessness, ataxia, tremors, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, mydriasis, nystagmus, opisthotonos, tetanic convulsions, hyperthermia and death from respiratory muscle spastic paralysis.\n\n-Lead poisoning induces gastrointestinal (anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation), renal (polyuria, polydipsia) and neurological (depression, central blindness, hyperexcitability, running fits, seizures, vocalization, ataxia, head pressing, opisthotonos, paraparesis) signs. Megaesophagus with regurgitation and pharyngeal/laryngeal paresis has been observed with chronic lead poisoning in cats. -Bromethalin acute toxicity causes tremors, hyperexcitability, hyperesthesia, depression, fever, anisocoria, positional nystagmus, extensor rigidity, opisthotonos and seizures (running fits and generalized). Death may sometimes be delayed up to 2-3 weeks in cats. Chronic intoxication with lower dosages causes occasional vomiting, ascending paresis and ataxia with proprioceptive deficits, depressed spinal reflexes (patellar and withdrawal), tremors, depression and lateral recumbency. Recovery is possible after exposure is discontinued. -Penitrem mycotoxins.\n\nDiagnosis is based on a history of exposure to a toxin capable of producing the observed signs within the documented time for exposure. Toxicologic analysis may be diagnostic when performed on the following: \u2022 Tissues (e.g. liver, kidney, fat, brain) for organochlorines, organophosphates, strychnine, lead, etc. \u2022 Vomitus and stomach content (for bromethalin, strychnine, methaldehyde). \u2022 Urine (for strychnine). \u2022 Blood for lead concentration and acethylcholinesterase activity (organophosphate poisoning).\n\nToxicity as a cause of seizures can be excluded when (a) there are no other diffuse neurological signs preceding the seizure onset (e.g. tremors, hyperexcitability), (b) when partial seizures occur, (c) when isolated seizures are interspersed with periods of normalcy, or (d) when focal neurological signs or deficits are present.\n\nMetabolic disturbances that are severe enough to cause obvious neurological signs including seizures in cats are rare. Hypoglycemia is typically associated with insulin overdose in a diabetic patient, hypocalcemia is mainly seen after bilateral thyroidectomy, and hepatoencephalopathy causes episodic signs, which rarely occur in intoxications.\n\nInflammatory conditions (e.g. encephalitides, polyneuropathies) need to be ruled out. Usually history and physical examination findings differentiate these from intoxications.\n\nWith dermal exposure it is important to bath the cat with soap or detergent to remove the toxin from the hair and skin. Intoxication with anti-flea and -tick sprays, dips, and aerosols containing insecticides such as pyrethrins, carbamates, organophosphates often occurs via dermal exposure.\n\nWhen ingestion has occurred within the previous 2 hours, emesis may be indicated or contraindicated, according to the specific toxin and formulation that was ingested. Emesis may be induced with hydrogen peroxide 3% (2 ml/kg PO) or apomorphine (0.03-0.04 mg IV or 0.04-0.08 mg/kg IM). Gastric lavage performed under general anesthesia may be beneficial if emesis is not effective. Enemas also may be useful. Activated charcoal (0.1-1.0 mg/kg q 8-12 h) preferably administered with a cathartic such as magnesium sulfate (250 mg/kg) or 70% sorbitol (3 ml/kg) is also indicated to reduce gastrointestinal absorption.\n\nAtropine sulfate (0.02-0.04 mg/kg IM or SC) will decrease salivation and muscarinic signs associated with organophosphate and other poisoning, but because of the risk of fatal bronchospasm it is only recommended if marked bradycardia is present.\n\nPralidoxime chloride (2-PAM, Protopam chloride) is useful to reactivate cholinesterase (10-15 mg/kg IM or SC q 8-12 h) and control nicotinic signs of organophosphate poisoning. It is most effective if exposure was within the previous 24-48 hours, if exposure was by the dermal route and if a slowly eliminated compound was involved (e.g. fenthion, chlorpyrifos).\n\nDiphenhydramine also has antinicotinic activity.\n\nChelation therapy (e.g. calcium EDTA and/or penicillamine) is indicated for lead poisoning.\n\nTreat cerebral edema (e.g. bromethalin, lead) with mannitol and/or glucorticosteroids, and control seizures or pseudo-seizures with diazepam, phenobarbital, propofol and pentobarbital. See page 801 (Likely symptomatic epilepsy) for treatment details.\n\nProvide supportive care including fluids, which also promote excretion of the toxin.\n\nPrognosis is variable and depends on the severity of the signs and time between intoxication and treatment. \n\nToxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic pathogen. Although subclinical infection is common in cats, clinical disease rarely develops.\n\n\u2022 Clinical toxoplasmosis causing neurological signs in adult cats is believed to be mainly associated with concurrent stress, illness or immunosuppression that reactivate a latent infection acquired at a young age by carnivorism associated with hunting.\n\nToxoplasma gondii causes a non-suppurative encephalomyelitis that may be widely scattered throughout the CNS or localized in one area as a granuloma.\n\nSystemic signs including lethargy, anorexia, fever are most often related to pneumonia, dyspnea, tachypnea. Hepatitis, pancreatitis, myositis and myocarditis may also occur.\n\nThe enteroepithelial cycle with oocyst shedding almost exclusively occurs in young weanling kittens and rarely results in gastrointestinal signs.\n\nSudden death associated with acute Toxoplasma encephalitis may occur in approximately 30% of kittens infected at 6-12 weeks of age.\n\nOcular signs such as anterior uveitis and chorioretinitis are also common.\n\nNeurological signs manifest rarely even though the organism is frequently found in the CNS.\n\n\u2022 Acute to subacute multifocal or focal cerebral signs are more common. Seizures are unlikely to occur as the only sign.\n\nThe antemortem diagnosis of clinical toxoplasmosis is difficult; it relies on serological demonstration of previous exposure and perhaps of recent or active infection, exclusion of other causes, and positive response to treatment.\n\nCSF analysis may reveal a mild to moderate increase of the protein concentration (< 1.0 g/L) with normal or only slightly elevated leukocyte count (<50/\u03bcl).\n\nOrganisms are only rarely seen on cytologic examination of CSF and other body fluids.\n\nDemonstration of the organism in tissue biopsy sections will confirm the diagnosis only if inflammation is present.\n\nFecal examination is likely to be unrewarding because of the short period of oocyst shedding that occurs for only a few weeks after infection. \n\nOther infectious and non-infectious causes of encephalomyelitis including FIP and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis should be considered.\n\nClindamycin 12.5 mg/kg PO q 12 h doses for a minimum of 4 weeks. Clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg PO q 12 h) and azithromycin (7-15 mg/kg q 12 h) are newer macrolides which may be useful.\n\nPrognosis is guarded with CNS involvement. Clinical signs of systemic illness usually begin to resolve within 24-48 h of beginning therapy but neurological signs may take weeks to improve and major neurological abnormalities may remain. Response may be poor, slow, incomplete, and recurrence may occur.\n\n\u2022 Recurrent primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. \u2022 The initial seizure frequency is low (< 1 single seizure every 6-8 weeks) but may later increase. \u2022 Seizures begin in young adult cats (6 months to 5 years of age) that have no other neurological signs and deficits.\n\nThis is believed to result from a diffuse imbalance between neuronal excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms that has no underlying cause other than a genetic predisposition.\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy is rare and poorly documented in cats.\n\nRecurrent primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures should be the only sign. \u2022 There is no aura, no localized or unilateral signs during the ictus and in the post-ictal phase.\n\nThe initial seizure frequency should be low with isolated single seizures at more than 6-8 week intervals.\n\n\u2022 The subsequent seizure frequency could remain low or progressively increase, perhaps to the point of intractability, but this should not occur before several months to a few years from the seizure onset.\n\nOnset of seizures should be during adolescence or young adulthood (probably between 6 months and 5 years).\n\nPhysical and ophthalmological examinations should be normal. Abnormal findings would indicate the presence of another pathological process possibly related to the seizure disorder (e.g. fever, chorioretinitis).\n\nNeurological examination should be normal. Other neurological signs or deficits would indicate that an active or inactive structural brain lesion is present.\n\nCSF analysis should be normal. Abnormalities would reveal the presence of an active or a resolving brain disease.\n\nBrain imaging (MRI) should be normal. Any abnormality could be related to the seizure disorder (e.g. active or inactive lesions).\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy should be excluded when there are partial seizures (including seizures that appear to be generalized from their onset but that are preceded by an aura or followed by localized post-ictal signs), a seizure onset before 6 months or after 5 years of age, an initially high seizure frequency, a rapid increase of the seizure frequency within the first few weeks or months, other neurological signs or deficits, CSF changes or MRI abnormalities.\n\nExtracranial causes of seizures such as metabolic, toxic and hypoxic causes usually produce a sudden onset of high-frequency seizures, often cluster seizures or status epilepticus, and other diffuse neurological and/or systemic signs before and in between the seizures. Active brain diseases often cause a higher seizure frequency, interictal neurological signs and deficits, and abnormal findings upon CSF analysis or brain imaging.\n\nLikely symptomatic epilepsy may sometimes be distinguished from idiopathic epilepsy only by the occurrence of partial seizures and/or the presence of focal neurological deficits because CSF analysis and MRI may also be normal.\n\nSymptomatic anti-epileptic drug therapy for life (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 801).\n\nGood seizure control should be obtained in most cases, although some cats can progress toward refractoriness, despite adequate anti-epileptic drug treatment.\n\nClassical signs \n\nSymptomatic hypocalcemia is rare in cats. It is usually iatrogenic following bilateral thyroidectomy.\n\nSigns are episodic or persistent and include multifocal muscle fasciculations, which often involves the face and ears. This may progress to generalized weakness with stiffness, panting, tremors and tetany. Terminally, convulsive status epilepticus may occur.\n\nDiagnosis is based on finding a total serum calcium concentration < 1.6 mmol/L (6.5 mg/dl) and ionized calcium level < 0.6 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dl).\n\nOther historical, clinical and laboratory abnormalities may reflect the underlying cause, including idiopathic or post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism, puerperal tetany, renal failure and phosphate enema.\n\nOther causes of neuromuscular hyperexcitability such as intoxications should be considered. With organophosphate toxicity, muscarinic signs are usually present (miosis, salivation, vomiting, bradycardia). Fenthion has few muscarinic signs and mainly produces muscle weakness.\n\nTetany must be differentiated from convulsive status epilepticus of hypocalcemia. The cat with tetany is conscious although it is very anxious.\n\nCalcium supplementation and specific treatment of the underlying cause is required. \u2022 Use 0.5-1.5 ml/kg IV of 10% calcium gluconate.\n\nInfuse slowly over 10 minutes while monitoring heart rate. Stop if bradycardia develops. See Hypocalcemia, page 962 in \"The Cat With Generalized Weakness\" for treatment.\n\n\u2022 Peracute onset of cerebral signs \u00b1 seizures. \u2022 Signs of head trauma, including hemorrhage in eyes, ears, nose. \u2022 Delayed onset epilepsy.\n\nConcussion manifests with immediate and brief (a few seconds to minutes) mental confusion or loss of consciousness. Recovery is rapid and complete with no residual neurological signs as there are no parenchymal lesions.\n\nContusions and lacerations produce parenchymal lesions and signs that may worsen over the initial 24 hours because of edema and increased intracranial pressure, but improve afterwards. \u2022 Forebrain signs include mentation abnormalities such as depression to semi-stupor and confusion, behavioral manifestations such as agitation and dementia, compulsive activities including restlessness with propulsive pacing and circling. Hemiparesis and central blindness may also occur.\n\nSeizure onset is often with cluster seizures or status epilepticus occurring immediately or within the first 12-24 hours after trauma. These may initially be difficult to control.\n\nDelayed onset post-traumatic epilepsy (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 800) may occur a few to several months later.\n\nHistory and external signs of severe head trauma as a result of a road accident, fall from several stories or mistreatment by humans.\n\nPost-traumatic epilepsy should be excluded if there were no serious forebrain signs and deficits at the time of a reported trauma, as well as when the seizure onset occurs more than 2 or 3 years after trauma. \u2022 Brain imaging may demonstrate a parenchymal lesion. A skull fracture may or may not be present.\n\nCerebrovascular accident may also manifest with an acute onset of severe focal cerebral signs but there are no history or external signs of trauma.\n\nOnset of seizures with low to moderate frequency a few to several months after major head trauma has occurred is highly suggestive of post-traumatic epilepsy but other causes of seizures must be ruled-out.\n\nRe-establish or maintain adequate cerebral perfusion.\n\n\u2022 First treat hypotension and systemic shock, if present, by giving volume replacement fluids:\n\n-Hetastarch 6%, 10-20 ml/kg to effect, to be given in 5 ml/kg increments over 5-10 minutes to avoid nausea and vomiting, OR -Hypertonic saline (NaCl 7%), 4-5 ml/kg slow IV over 3-5 minutes. \u2022 If volume replacement fluids are not available, give isotonic crystalloid fluids (e.g. NaCl 0.9%, LRS), 40-60 ml/kg/h IV, to effect administering just enough to re-establish euvolemia and mean arterial blood pressure. \u2022 Whole blood transfusion or plasma administration may be indicated when significant blood loss has occurred. \u2022 Administer supplemental oxygen via a nasal or transtracheal catheter. If the cat is unconscious, intubate and ventilate at 10-20 breaths/minute to keep PaCO 2 around 30-35 mmHg.\n\nControl secondary brain edema to prevent or reduce intracranial hypertension.\n\n\u2022 If shock treatment has not sufficiently improved the cat's neurological status, if the cat is mentally very depressed or stuporous, or if its neurological status deteriorates (mental status, pinpoint pupils or progression to mydriatic and non-responsive pupils): -Give furosemide 0.5-2 mg/kg IV.\n\n-A few minutes later, give mannitol 0.5-1.0 g/kg IV slowly over 10-20 minutes. A dramatic decrease of the intracranial pressure and neurological improvement usually occurs within 15 minutes and lasts for 2-5 hours. If neurological deterioration occurs afterwards, mannitol can be repeated for a maximum of three doses over a 24-hour period. Careful monitoring of serum osmolality and electrolytes is mandatory. \u2022 Keep the head elevated at 15-30 degrees, avoid pressure on the jugular veins from IV lines, bandage and bedding, and monitor mental status and pupil size continuously.\n\nGlucocorticosteroid administration in the head trauma patient is controversial because of few documented beneficial effects and potential deleterious effects, etc. If the patient does not respond adequately to appropriate fluid, oxygen and mannitol administration, methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) may be given if hyperglycemia is not already present (30 mg/kg at time 0, and 15 mg/kg at 2 and 6 hours, followed or not with a continuous intravenous infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/h for 24 hours).\n\nControl cluster seizures and status epilepticus with anti-epileptic drugs (see Likely symptomatic epilepsy, page 801).\n\nEmergency craniectomy may be indicated when aggressive medical treatment has not succeeded in stabilizing a patient with a depressed skull fracture, calvarial penetration with contaminated bone fragments or foreign material, and focal hemorrhage as documented by brain imaging (CT scan or MRI). Craniectomy with durotomy solely as a decompressive procedure may also be attempted.\n\n\u2022 Progression from mild behavioral changes, to aggression and vicious behavior, to paralysis and death.\n\nThe development of the disease often follows three stages; an early short prodromal phase (1-2 days) characterized by a non-specific change in mental status; the cat may become shy and withdrawn or affectionate and unpredictable. This progresses into an aggressive and furious form (2-4 days) where the cat may viciously attack anything in sight. This may be accompanied by excessive drooling secondary to dysphagia. Convulsions may also occur. In the later stage (1-4 days) of the illness, the animal develops paralysis, coma and death.\n\nAny cat presented with an acute onset of aggression or with unusually fractious behavior, should be considered as a rabies suspect and handled with caution.\n\nThe diagnosis is made on post-mortem tissue using immunofluorescence antibody (IFA), ELISA and more recently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.\n\nThe strain of rabies can be further diagnosed using monoclonal antibody testing.\n\nRoutine laboratory tests are unrewarding.\n\n\u2022 Mental alterations, abnormal motor function and occasionally, seizures. \u2022 Depression, anorexia. \n\nNeurological signs occur mainly in severely ill patients with advanced stage of acute or chronic renal failure.\n\nSigns are often vague and include mental disturbances such as depression, confusion, restlessness, hyper-reactivity to various stimuli, delirium. Weakness may be evident sometimes with muscle spasms, myoclonia or tremors. Ataxia, head-bobbing and muscle fasciculations may also occur. The signs are likely caused by the debilitating effects of renal failure, uremic encephalopathy and associated metabolic disturbances including hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, acidbase disturbances, anemia. \u2022 Seizures occur in severely ill cats and more often with acute than chronic renal failure.\n\nOther historical, clinical and laboratory abnormalities consistent with severe renal failure and perhaps related to the underlying cause (e.g. ethylene glycol intoxication) are present. There is no correlation between the degree of azotemia and the severity of the neurological signs.\n\n\u2022 Usually asymptomatic.\n\n\u2022 Rarely, behavioral abnormalities.\n\nSubtle and non-specific changes in behavior including depression, social withdrawal, compulsive roaming and psychotic behavior have been attributed to FIV encephalopathy. Signs have mainly been observed in the advanced stage of infection.\n\nOther systemic signs of FIV infection for example, weight loss, fewer immunodeficiency-related infections of the skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts should have manifested by the time neurological signs develop.\n\nCSF analysis may reveal a mild non-specific mononuclear pleocytosis (5-10/\u03bcl) with normal protein concentration. A positive antibody test on a CSF sample not contaminated with blood indicates CNS infection.\n\nUnrelated CNS pathologies and secondary opportunistic infections (e.g. FIP, toxoplasmosis) would likely be responsible for neurological signs other than behavioral changes in FIV-positive cats.\n\nNo effective treatment is known.\n\nCAT WITH SIGNS OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE PART 10 820"}
