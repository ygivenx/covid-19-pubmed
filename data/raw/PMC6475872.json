{"title": "Immunogenicity of Different Forms of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome S Glycoprotein", "body": "\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute inflammatory\nrespiratory infection that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in June 2012.\nThe causative agent of MERS was officially called the Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2013\n[1, 2].\nMERS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, genus\nBetacoro navirus. Dromedary camels are the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV; viral\ntransmission to humans occurs during consumption of unpasteurized camel milk;\nairborne transmission is also possible\n[3-5].\n\n\n\nTo date, a total of 2,260 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have\nbeen reported, including 803 deaths [6,\n7]. Due to its high mortality rate (~\n35.5%) [6], combined with a wide\ndistribution of the reservoir and absence of effective preventive drugs or\ntreatment, WHO experts classify MERS-CoV as a virus with the potential to cause\na pandemic [8]. Therefore, vaccine\ndevelopment is necessary in order to stave off such a pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe main protective MERS-CoV antigen is the S glycoprotein presented as a\ntrimer on the virus surface. The S glycoprotein plays an important role in the\nvirus\u2019 internalization into the cell [9].\nThe S glycoprotein is subdivided into two subunits: the S1\nsubunit containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the S2 subunit\nresponsible for the fusion of the virus and cell membrane\n[10-13].\nThese features make the S protein an important target for MERS-CoV vaccine\ndevelopment [14-17]. The RBD of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein is a key target\nfor the development of preventive and therapeutic means against MERS [18-20],\nbecause the RBD mediates the interaction between MERS-CoV and the receptor DPP4\non the cell surface.\n\n\n\nIn order to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine, it is important to\nunderstand which form of the glycoprotein to include in the vaccine to provide\nprotection against MERS. There are data that demonstrate the immunogenicity of\nvarious forms of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein\n[21-25].\nHowever, the question of which form is preferable for a vaccine remains open, since an\nantigen panel has not been tested under the same conditions. In order to\naddress this knowledge gap, we constructed five recombinant vectors based on\nhuman adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) expressing different forms of the MERS-CoV S\nglycoprotein:\n\n\n\n\u2013 the full-length S glycoprotein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum\n(ER);\n\n\n\n\u2013 two secreted variants of the receptor binding domain of the MERS-CoV S\nglycoprotein containing the alkaline phosphatase leader peptide (the RBD and\nthe RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 to increase stability and immunogenicity\n[18,19]); and\n\n\n\n\u2013 two transmembrane (TM) forms localized in the plasma membrane of the\ncell: either the full-length S or the RBD with the TM domain of the vesicular\nstomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein. Because the full-length S glycoprotein\nis localized in the ER [26], we\nconstructed an S-G variant with a deleted ER localization signal.\n\n\n\nWe chose a platform based on the recombinant viral vectors rAd5 for delivering\nthe S glycoprotein, because such vectors can efficiently deliver the transgene\nto multiple cell types [27, 28], their genome has been fully\ncharacterized, they are able to grow to high titers [29], and they can induce a strong humoral and cellular immune\nresponse [30, 31].\n\n\n\nThe present study compares the humoral and cellular immune responses induced by\nvaccination of mice with rAd5 carrying different forms of the MERS-CoV S\nglycoprotein.\n\n\n\nCell lines\n\n\n\nThe HEK293 and A549 cell lines were obtained from the Russian collection of\nvertebrate cell lines (Russia). The HEK293T and Vero E6 cells were obtained\nfrom ATCC (USA). All cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C with 5%\nCO2.\n\n\n\nConstruction of recombinant adenoviral particles expressing different\nforms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein\n\n\n\nThe MERS-CoV S glycoprotein amino acid sequences of strains (2015\u20132017)\nwere obtained from the NCBI database [32]. The consensus sequence of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein was\nmade on the basis of amino acid sequences using the Geneious\u00ae 10.2.3\nsoftware. The nucleotide sequences of different glycoprotein forms were\noptimized for expression in mammalian cell lines and synthesized by Evrogen JSC\n(Russia). Five recombinant plasmids (pAd5-S, pAd5- S-G, pAd5-RBD, pAd5-RBD-G,\nand pAd5-RBD-Fc) were generated. rAd5 was obtained according to the procedure\ndescribed previously [33].\n\n\n\nGeneration of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S\nglycoprotein (pseudoviruses)\n\n\n\nHEK293T cells were seeded in 15-cm culture Petri dishes and co-transfected with\nthree plasmids (pCMV\u0394R8,2; pLV-CMV-EGFP; pCMV-MERS-CoV-S) to obtain\npseudoviruses. Seventy-two hours later, the supernatants were collected,\nfiltered, divided into aliquots, and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. Vero E6 cells\nwere used for titrating the pseudoviruses. The titer of the pseudotyped virus\nwas determined in terms of focus-forming units (FFUs).\n\n\n\nEvaluating the expression of different forms of the MERS-CoV S\nglycoprotein by western blotting\n\n\n\nHEK293 cells were seeded in 35 mm Petri dishes and incubated overnight to 70%\nconfluence. Then, rAd5 were added to the cells at 100 PFUs/cell. rAd5-null was\nused as a control virus. After 24 h, the expression of different forms of the\nMERS-CoV S glycoprotein was evaluated by western blotting using S-specific\nantibodies (40069-RP02, Sino Biological, China) and antibodies specific to\nrabbit IgG (NA934V, GE, Great Britain). Expression of the membrane-fused forms\nof the glycoprotein (S, S-G, RBD-G) was detected in cell lysates prepared using\nthe Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, USA). Expression of the secreted\nversions of the glycoprotein (RBD, RBD-Fc) was evaluated in the culture medium.\nLysate samples were loaded onto wells (10 \u03bcg of total protein in a volume\nof 10 \u03bcl/well). Samples of the medium were loaded in volume 10\n\u03bcl/well.\n\n\n\nLaboratory animals\n\n\n\nAll animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the\nrecommendations of the National Standard of the Russian Federation (GOST R\n53434\u20132009; Principles of Good Laboratory Practice). Six-week-old female\nC57/BL6 mice (18\u201320 g) were obtained from the Pushchino Breeding Facility\n(Russia). The mice had free access to water and food. The mice were housed in\nan ISOcage system (Tecniplast, Italy).\n\n\n\nImmunization and serum samples collection\n\n\n\nThe mice were randomly distributed into groups (n = 5 per group for the\nanalysis of the humoral immune response and n = 9 per group for the analysis of\nthe T-cell response) and intramuscularly vaccinated with the obtained\nrecombinant adenoviral particles at a dose of 108 v.p./mouse in a total volume\nof 0.1 mL. Serum specimens were collected on day 21 post-vaccination for\ndetection of S-specific IgG antibodies.\n\n\n\nDetermination of antibody titers in mouse serum samples using\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\n\n\nGlycoprotein-specific antibody titers in mouse serum samples were determined by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The following recombinant proteins\nwere used for analysis: the S glycoprotein (40069- V08B; Sino Biological) and\nthe RBD (40071-V08B1; Sino Biological). Non-specific antibody binding sites\nwere blocked with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% fat-free milk\n(A0830; AppliChem, Spain). The serum samples were titrated with two-fold serial\ndilutions in PBST containing 3% fat-free milk. The following anti-mouse IgG\nhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detection:\nfor the total IgG titer, NXA931 (GE Healthcare, USA); for IgG1, ab97240 (Abcam,\nUK); for IgG2a, ab97245 (Abcam, UK); for IgG2b, ab97250 (Abcam, UK); and for\nIgG3, ab97260 (Abcam, UK). A tetramethylbenzidine solution (Research Institute\nof Organic Semiproducts and Dyes, Russia) was used as a visualizing reagent.\nThe reaction was stopped by adding 1M H2SO4, and the\noptical density was measured at 450 nm (OD450) using a Multiscan FC\nspectrophotometric plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The IgG titer was\ndetermined as the maximum serum dilution in which the OD450 value of\na serum sample from an immunized animal exceeded that of the control animal\nserum sample more than twofold.\n\n\n\nPseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PsVNA) \n\n\n\nThe pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PsVNA) was performed as described\npreviously [34]. Briefly,\nheat-inactivated serum samples were diluted 1:10, 1:40, 1:160, and 1:640. These\nsamples were then mixed with an equal volume of DMEM containing 105 FFUs/ml of\nthe pseudovirions. The mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, then\ninoculated onto a Vero E6 cell monolayer and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 42 h.\nThe number of EGFP fluorescent cell focuses was counted. The pseudovirion\nneutralization titer of serum samples from an immunized animal was determined\nas the maximum dilution where 50% reduction of EGFP fluorescent cell focuses\ncompared with the serum samples of intact (non-immunized) animals was\ndetermined.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of T-cell response (lymphocyte proliferation assay) \n\n\n\nMice were euthanized on day 8 post-vaccination, and their spleens were\ncollected. The spleens were homogenized by passage through a 100 \u03bcm sieve\nin sterile PBS. Splenocytes were isolated by Ficoll (1.09 g/mL; PanEco, Russia)\ndensity gradient centrifugation (800 g for 30 min). For T-cell\nproliferation assay, the splenocytes were stained with carboxyfluorescein using\na succinimidyl ester (CFSE) tracer kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the\nprocedure described previously [35]. The\ncells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7 105 cells/well) in a\ncomplete RPMI1640 medium re-stimulated with the recombinant MERS-CoV S protein\n(40071-V08B1; Sino Biological) at 1 \u03bcg/well. After 3 days, the cells were\nharvested, washed with PBS, stained with antibodies specific to CD3, CD4, and\nCD8: allophycocyanin (APC)-labelled anti-CD3, APC\u2013Cy7-labelled anti-CD8,\nand phycoerythrin-labelled anti-CD4 (BD Biosciences, USA), and fixed in 1%\nparaformaldehyde. Proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were determined in\nthe cell mixture using a BD FACS Aria III flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The\nresulting percentage of proliferating cells (X) was determined using the\nformula X = %st \u2013 %, where %st is the percentage of proliferating cells\nafter splenocyte re-stimulation with the recombinant MERS-CoV S glycoprotein,\nand % is the percentage of proliferating cells in the absence of splenocyte\nre-stimulation (intact cells).\n\n\n\nAnalysis of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production \n\n\n\nSplenocytes were isolated on day 15 post-vaccination using the procedure\ndescribed above. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7\n105 cells/well) in a RPMI1640 medium, followed by re-stimulation\nwith recombinant MERS-CoV S (40071-V08B1; Sino Biological) at a concentration\nof 1 \u03bcg/well. Forty-eight h post-treatment, the culture supernatants were\ncollected. The concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatants was measured by\nELISA using a commercial kit (mouse IFN-\u03b3 ELISA kit; Invitrogen) according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The increase in IFN-\u03b3\nconcentration was determined using the formula X = Cst /Cint, where X is the\nfold increase in IFN-\u03b3 concentration, Cst is the IFN-\u03b3 concentration\nin the medium from the stimulated cells (pg/ml), and Cint is the IFN-\u03b3\nconcentration in the medium from the non-stimulated (intact) cells (pg/ml).\n\n\n\nStatistical analysis \n\n\n\nThe statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad 7.0 software\n(GraphPad Software, USA). When analysing data from unpaired samples, either the\nStudent\u2019s t-test for independent samples or the Mann\u2013Whitney\nU-test was used depending on the data distribution normality.\nDistribution normality was determined using the generalized\nD\u2019Agostino\u2013Pearson test.\n\n\n\nGeneration of rAd5 vectors \n\n\n\nIn order to determine and compare the immunogenicities of different forms of\nthe MERS-CoV S protein, we constructed five rAd5 vectors: rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G,\nrAd5-RBD, rAd5-RBD-G, and rAd5-RBD-Fc. The schemes for the target transgenes in\nthe rAd5 genomes are shown\nin Fig. 1A.\nExpression levels of different forms of the MERS-CoV S\nglycoprotein were evaluated by western blot analysis\n(Fig. 1B).\nIn the samples of the full-length glycoprotein (rAd5-S and rAd5-S-G),\nthe S protein was detected as two polypeptides\n(Fig. 1B),\nwith the upper band representing the\nglycosylated form of the S protein (~230\u2013250 kDa), and the lower band\n(~100 kDa) representing the S1 subunit resulting from S-protein cleavage by\nhost-cell proteases. The molecular weights of the bands were higher than those\ncalculated according to the nucleotide sequences, being indicative of tentative\nprotein glycosylation [14, 16, 36,\n37, 38]. A single polypeptide specifically recognized by the\nantibody was detected in the RBD (RBD, RBD-G and RBD-Fc) samples\n(Fig. 1B),\nits molecular weight being ~25 kDa, ~30 kDa, and ~55 kDa, respectively.\nThe molecular weights of the polypeptides based on the RBD corresponded\nto the calculated weights.\n\n\n\nrAd5 expressing different MERS-CoV S glycoprotein variants induce a\nhumoral immune response \n\n\n\nMice were intramuscularly immunized with single doses of rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G,\nrAd5-RBD, rAd5-RBD-G, and rAd5-RBD-Fc (108 v.p. per mouse). Serum samples were\ncollected three weeks after the immunization, and the titers of antibodies\nspecific to S protein and RBD were analyzed\n(Fig. 2).\nNo glycoprotein-specific IgG was detected in the serum samples from mice in the\ncontrol groups (non-immunized mice and those immunized with rAd5-null). The\nhighest titer of IgG specific to S glycoprotein was detected in the group\nimmunized with rAd5-RBD-G [geometric mean titer (GMT) was 356,055; the 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) was 139,042\u2013911,772]. The lowest titer of IgG\nspecific to the S glycoprotein was observed in the group immunized with\nrAd5-RBD-Fc [GMT: 29,407; 95% CI: 11,455\u201375,492]\n(Fig. 2A).\nELISA for RBD-specific IgG antibodies showed that rAd5-RBD-G\n[GMT: 89,144; 95% CI: 60,665\u2013130,994] and rAd5-RBD [GMT: 58,831; 95% CI:\n40,024\u201386,424] were the constructs with the highest immunogenicity, while\nrAd5-RBD-Fc [GMT: 6,400; 95% CI: 2,230\u201318,364] had the lowest\nimmunogenicity. No significant differences in RBD-specific IgG titers were\ndetected between rAd5-RBD and rAd5- RBD-G\n(Fig. 2B).\n\n\n\nThere are four IgG isotypes known in mice to be responsible for identification\nand clearance of many antigens: IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3\n[39]. Determination of the titers of IgG\nisotypes three weeks post-immunization showed that all four IgG isotypes were\ndetected in all vaccinated animals\n(Fig. 3). For the IgG1,\nIgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes in immunized animals, titers were as follows for each\ngroup: rAd5-S (GMT: 409,600, 409,600, and 89,144, respectively); rAd5-S-G (GMT:\n54,0470, 470,506, and 155,209, respectively); rAd5-RBD (GMT: 540,470,713,155,\nand 135,118, respectively); and rAd5-RBD-G (GMT: 356,578, 713,155, and 204,800,\nrespectively). We observed no significant intergroup difference in isotype\ntiters. Following vaccination with rAd5-RBD-Fc, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, the\ntiters were significantly lower than those in the other groups (GMT:102,400,\n89,144, and 12,800, respectively). The IgG3 titers did not differ significantly\nbetween the groups (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, rAd5-RBD, rAd5-RBD-G, and rAd5-RBD-Fc;\nGMT: 33,779, 14,703, 51,200, 33,779, and 5572, respectively). Hence, according\nto these findings, the IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes make the greatest contribution\nto the total titer of glycoprotein-specific IgG.\n\n\n\nrAd5 expressing membrane forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein elicit the\nproduction of neutralizing antibodies in mice \n\n\n\nDetermination of the titers of neutralizing antibodies (in the\npseudovirion-based neutralization assay) showed that all mice immunized with\nrAd5-S, rAd5- S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G generated neutralizing antibodies\n(Fig. 4)\nwith the GMT of 1:121, 1:160 and 1:70, respectively;\nno significant differences in PsVNA titers were observed (p\n> 0.05). In the rAd5-RBD group, neutralizing antibodies were\ndetected only in three mice while no neutralizing antibodies were detected in\nthe rAd5-RBD-Fc group and in intact animals. Hence, the results of the\nconducted experiment showed that only immunization with rAd5 expressing the\nmembrane forms of the glycoprotein (S, S-G, RBD-G) leads to the generation of\nneutralizing antibodies.\n\n\n\nrAd5 expressing the MERS-CoV S protein variants elicit the T-cell\nresponse \n\n\n\nThe post-vaccination cellular immune response was evaluated using two methods:\naccording to the number of proliferating T cells and according to IFN-\u03b3\nproduction by T cells in response to glycoprotein re-stimulation. The\nfull-length MERS-CoV S protein was used for re-stimulation, since it contains\nthe largest number of epitopes and is present in MERS-CoV particles. The\nproliferation assay of CD4+ cells on day 8 post-vaccination\n(Fig. 5,\nleft-side panel) showed that the highest lymphoproliferative\nactivity was observed in the rAd5-S group (2.10%), while the lowest one was\ndetected in the rAd5-RBD-Fc group (0.25%). Significant differences in the\nlymphoproliferative response of CD4+ cells between the groups of immunized and\nintact animals were observed in the rAd5-S (2.10%) and rAd5-S-G (1.63%) groups.\nCD8+ cells proliferation assay\n(Fig. 5, right-side panel)\nshowed that the highest lymphoproliferative response was observed in the rAd5-S\ngroup (1.90%), while the lowest one was detected in the rAd5-RBD-Fc group\n(0.35%). Significant differences in the lymphoproliferative response of CD8+\ncells between the groups of immunized and intact animals were observed in the\nrAd5-S (1.90%), rAd5-S-G (1.15%), and rAd5-RBD (0.55%) groups. An analysis of\nIFN-\u03b3 production by splenocytes after the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein\nre-stimulation also showed that the strongest cellular immune response\ndeveloped in groups of animals immunized with rAd5-S and rAd5-S-G\n(Fig. 6):\nIFN-\u03b3 secretion increased as compared to that for intact\ncells 15.12 \u00b1 0.43-fold and 10.14 \u00b1 0.97-fold, respectively.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are no specific prophylactic or therapeutic agents against the\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome in the world. Intensive research focusing on\nthe development of vaccines against this disease is being conducted in the USA,\nGermany, South Korea, and other countries [40, 41]. Several\ncandidate vaccines based on MERS-CoV glycoprotein are known: recombinant viral\nvectors based on the recombinant vaccinia virus, adenovirus, measles virus and\nothers; DNA vaccines; combined candidate vaccines based on DNA and recombinant\nprotein; and candidate vaccines based on virus-like particles and recombinant\nproteins [22, 38, 41-46].\n\n\n\nThe key in vaccine development is antigen selection. Most of the developed\nvaccines against MERS are based on the application of different forms of the\nMERS-CoV glycoprotein (the full-length S, the S1 subunit, and RBD) [14, 15,\n16, 18, 22, 24, 47-55], which is the\nmain target for neutralizing antibodies. However, the question that still\nremains open is which form to choose for the development of an effective\nvaccine? It is known that the full-length S glycoprotein ensures 100%\nprotection against lethal infection caused by MERS-CoV in animals [44]. However, some authors have expressed\nconcern about the use of full-length MERS-CoV S in the vaccine. Thus, it has\nbeen reported that a vaccine based on a full-length glycoprotein of the severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (which, like MERS-CoV, belongs to\nthe genus Betacoronavirus) induces immunopathology in the lungs of a vaccinated\norganism because of the strong antibody response to the SARS-CoV glycoprotein\nand weak T cell (Th2-skewed) immune response [56, 57].\n\n\n\nGlycoprotein modifications were for the most part based on the fact that the\nreceptor-binding domain of the glycoprotein was included in the antigen.\nVarious studies showed immunogenicity of the S1 subunit, the RBD or the RBD\nfused with Fc of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc) [15, 18, 19, 49,\n58]. Studies focused on protection of\ndrugs based on RBD (subunit vaccines) showed that RBD vaccination protected ~\n80% of animals from MERS-CoV, despite the high titers of neutralizing\nantibodies capable of blocking the interaction between the virus and the DPP4\nreceptor on the cell surface [42, 59]. The lack of 100% protection seems to be\nrelated to the need to develop a cellular immune response, as well as the need\nto block fusion of the viral and cell membranes, which is mediated by the S2\nsubunit. Furthermore, application of subunit-based vaccines, as well as\ninactivated ones, prevents the emergence of a balanced Th1/Th2 response and\noften leads to the development of Th2-skewed immunity [22, 42]. In the case of\nMERS, its development can lead to lung immunopathologies [48]. Therefore, it is important to take into account the fact\nthat the vaccine-induced immunity must be Th1/Th2-balanced when developing an\nanti-MERS vaccine.\n\n\n\nNumerous antigens based on the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein have been studied.\nHowever, these antigens, under the same conditions (using the same antigen\ndelivery platform), have not been compared directly. In the present study,\ndirect comparison of the immunogenicities of five different forms of the\nMERS-CoV S glycoprotein under the same conditions was carried out; rAd5 was\nused for delivery. Strong antibody (mainly IgG1 and IgG2a) and T-cell immune\nresponses developed in animals vaccinated with rAd5 expressing various forms of\nthe MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Each of the rAd5 variants allowed for the\nemergence of a balanced Th1/Th2 response, which is one of the key aspects in\nthe development of an anti-MERS vaccine. In a study focused on the intensity of\nthe humoral immune response, the membrane form of the RBD (rAd5-RBD-G) elicited\na more powerful IgG response than the other studied forms. It was also\ndemonstrated that only the membrane forms of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S,\nrAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies.\nIn the investigation of cellular immune response intensity, the forms of the\nfull-length MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S and rAd5-S-G) were characterized by\nthe strongest immunogenicity.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, the findings obtained in our study suggest that, among all the\nstudied forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein, the full-length S glycoprotein\nand the membrane form of RBD (RBD-G) are the most promising candidates for\ninclusion in a vaccine.\n\n\n\nThe immunogenicities of five forms of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein in mice were\ncompared in this study. A platform based on the recombinant adenoviral vectors\nrAd5 was used for antigen delivery. The studies have yielded the following\nresults:\n\n\n\n\u2013 The most powerful humoral immune response was observed in animals\nimmunized with the membrane-bound form of the RBD (rAd5-RBD-G);\n\n\n\n\u2013 Only the membrane forms of MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G and\nrAd5-RBD-G) induced the generation of neutralizing antibodies in all vaccinated\nmice;\n\n\n\n\u2013 The most significant cellular immune response developed after\nimmunization of animals with the full-length glycoprotein (rAd5-S); and\n\n\n\n\u2013 Vaccination of mice with all developed rAd5 vectors elicited a balanced\nTh1/Th2 response.\n"}
