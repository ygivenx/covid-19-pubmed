{"title": "Public antibodies to malaria antigens generated by two LAIR1\ninsertion modalities", "body": "Kenyan plasma samples were obtained from adults living in a malaria-endemic\nregion within Kilifi County. Tanzanian serum and plasma samples were obtained from healthy\nmale volunteers, malaria negative at study enrolment and during PBMC collection, HIV and\nHepatitis B and C negative, age 25.4 \u00b1 2.8 (mean +/- SD)3. The Mali study was conducted in the rural village of Kalifabougou\nwhere intense P. falciparum transmission occurs from June through\nDecember each year. 610 individuals (310 males and 300 females) were enrolled, age ranging\nfrom 1 to 26 years (mean 9). The cohort has been described in detail elsewhere4. Smaller numbers of sera were also obtained from\nadults in the Fulani and Dogon ethnic groups in Mant\u00e9ourou, Mali. 48 individuals\n(28 males and 20 females) were enrolled, age ranging from 21 to 57 years (mean 39.7).\n\nIn all cases, written informed consent was obtained from the participants (or\nguardians of participating children) before inclusion in the study. The acquisition and\nuse of the Kenyan plasma samples were approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute\nScientific and Ethics Review Unit (protocol number: KEMRI-SERU 3149), as well as the\nOxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. The Tanzanian samples were obtained with\ninformed consent from the trial participants. The clinical trial was conducted according\nto Good Clinical Practices and with authorization from the Institutional Review Boards of\nthe Ifakara Health Institute, the National Institute for Medical Research Tanzania, the\nTanzanian Food and Drugs Authority and the Commission cantonale d'\u00e9thique de\nla recherche sur l'\u00eatre humain du canton de Vaud, Switzerland. The trial is\nregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01949909. The Mali study was approved by\nThe Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry at the University\nof Sciences, Technique and Technology of Bamako, and the Institutional Review Board of the\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from participants or parents or guardians of\nparticipating children prior to inclusion in the Mali study.\n\nP. falciparum parasites were initially obtained from children\nwho were diagnosed with malaria in Kilifi County, Kenya. The parasites were adapted to\nin vitro culture and cultivated using standard protocols17. The P. falciparum laboratory line\n3D7 was also cultured under the same conditions. 3D7D21 is derived by\nenrichment of 3D7 parasites reactive with the LAIR1-containing monoclonal antibody MGD21.\nParasites were cryopreserved at the late trophozoite stage in small aliquots for\nsubsequent use in assays.\n\nSera or plasma were tested for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies using\na two-determinant bead-based immunoassay. Anti-goat IgG microbeads (Spherotech) were\ncoated with goat anti-human LAIR1 (R&D Systems, AF2664) and 40\u00d7 SYBR Green I\n(ThermoFisher Scientific) or with goat anti-human EGF (R&D Systems, AF-259-NA)\nwithout SYBR Green I for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were washed, mixed, and\nincubated with the sera at a 1/30 dilution for 1 h at room temperature under shaking\nconditions. Beads coated with anti-LAIR1 were differentiated from control beads coated\nwith anti-EGF based on SYBR Green staining. Serum antibody binding was detected using 2.5\n\u03bcg ml\u22121 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson\nImmunoResearch, 709-606-098) or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-human IgM (Jackson\nImmunoResearch, 709-606-073). FACS Diva (version 6.2) was used for acquisition of samples\nand Flow-Jo (version 10.1) was used for FACS analysis. Delta MFI (median fluorescence\nintensity) was calculated by subtracting the MFI of the anti-EGF control beads from that\nof the anti-LAIR1 beads in the IgG or IgM channel.\n\nIgM or IgG memory B cells were isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells (PBMCs) by magnetic cell sorting with anti-CD19-PECy7 antibodies (BD, 341113) and\nmouse anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-048-081), followed by FACS sorting using\ngoat Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-170) or\nanti-human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-129) and PE-labeled anti-human IgD (BD,\n555779). As previously described18, sorted B cells\nwere immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and plated in single cell cultures in the\npresence of CpG-DNA (2.5 \u00b5g ml\u22121) and irradiated PBMC-feeder\ncells. Two weeks post-immortalization, the culture supernatants were tested (at a 2/3\ndilution) for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies using the bead-based immunoassay\ndescribed above. For several donors, the culture supernatants were also tested for the\nability to bind to IEs from a mixture of four parasite isolates (3D7-MGD21+,\n9106, 9605 and 11019) by flow cytometry. Briefly, cryopreserved IEs were thawed, stained\nwith 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with the B-cell\nsupernatants for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Detection of antibody binding was done with 2.5\n\u03bcg ml\u22121 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG.\n\ncDNA was synthesized from selected B-cell cultures and both heavy chain and\nlight chain variable regions (VH and VL) were sequenced as previously described19. The usage of VH and VL genes and the number of\nsomatic mutations were determined by analyzing the homology of VH and VL sequences of\nmonoclonal antibodies to known human V, D and J genes in the IMGT database20. Antibody-encoding sequences were amplified and\nsequenced with primers specific for the V and J regions of the given antibody. Sequences\nwere aligned with Clustal Omega21.\n\nThe number of somatic mutations in the LAIR1 inserts was\nobtained by analyzing the homology of the inserts to the original LAIR1\ngenomic sequence (sequence from Ensembl genome database: ENSG00000167613). Amino acid\nsequences of LAIR1 inserts of all the antibodies discovered were grouped\nfor each donor and aligned to the original unmutated LAIR1 sequence using Clustal\nOmega21. The replacement to silent mutation ratio\n(R/S) values were calculated at each codon for each donor. Mean (R/S) values above 2.9,\nindicative of positive selection, were used to highlight hot spots in the LAIR1\nextracellular domain (PDB 3RP1) using the BioLuminate software (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC,\nNew York, NY, 2016 v2.4).\n\nAntibody heavy and light chains were cloned into human IgG1, Ig\u03ba and\nIg\u03bb expression vectors and expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F Cells\n(ThermoFisher Scientific) using polyethylenimine (PEI). Cell lines were routinely tested\nfor mycoplasma contamination. The antibodies were affinity purified by protein A\nchromatography (GE Healthcare). Variants of the GCE536, MGD21, MGM1 and MGJ5 antibodies\nwere produced by inserting or exchanging the mutated or unmutated LAIR1\nsequences or by substituting these sequences with the Ig-like domains of PD1 and SLAM\ngenes (sequences from Ensembl genome database: ENSG00000188389 and ENSG00000117090,\nrespectively). The antibody constructs were tested for staining of 9215 IEs and binding\nvalues (%) at 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 antibody concentration were calculated by\ninterpolation of binding curves fitted to a sigmoidal curve model (Graphpad Prism 7).\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from B-cell clones with a commercial kit (QIAGEN). For\nanalysis of the camel-like antibody MGB47, 3\u2019RACE22 with the CH2-\u03b3-REV1 primer (gagaccttgcacttgtactccttgcc) was used for\namplification of truncated heavy chain mRNAs. Heavy-chain variable to constant gDNA of\nMGB47 was amplified using an upstream 5\u2019 VH3-21 primer\n(gggtccatattgtgatcctgagtctggg) and CH2-\u03b3-REV1 as the reverse primer. After PCR\namplification with LongAmp Taq Polymerase (New England Biolabs), the 6000bp amplicon was\ncloned into a vector using the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit (ThermoFisher) and sequenced by\nplasmid-NGS-sequencing (Microsynth, Switzerland). All other LAIR1 switch and V-DJ inserts\nwere analyzed by PCR amplification of gDNA and Sanger Sequencing using donor-specific\nforward and universal reverse primers: donE_FW (cctggagggtcttctgcttgctggc), donF_FW\n(cctcctgctggtggcagctccc), donJ/M_FW1 (atggagtttgggctgagctgggttttcc), donJ_FW2\n(gtgagtgaacacgagtgagagaaacagtgg), donM_FW2 (gagtgaacatgagtgagaaaaactggatttgtgtgg),\ndonO/Q_FW (atgaaacatctgtggttctt), 3\u2019J6_REV (ggcatcggaaaatccacagaggctcc),\nIgG_CH1_REV1 (tcttgtccaccttggtgttgct), IgG_CH1_REV2 (gtagtccttgaccaggcagc), IgM_CH2_REV1\n(ggacacctgaatctgccggggactgaaaccc), and IgM_CH2_REV2 (ctggtcaccttgtaggtcgtgggcccag).\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from FACS-sorted human na\u00efve\n(CD19+ CD27- IgM+) or memory B cells (CD19+\nCD27+ IgG+/IgA+) using a commercial kit (QIAGEN).\nSwitch region PCRs on memory B cell gDNA were performed using LongAmp Taq Polymerase (New\nEngland Biolabs) in 50 \u00b5l reaction volumes with incubation for 3 min at\n95\u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 40 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s,\n65\u00b0C for 3 min and a final extension for 10 min at 65\u00b0C. The upstream\nswitch-\u00b5 forward primer S-\u00b5-FW (cacccttgaaagtagcccatgccttcc) was combined\nwith different reverse primers. IgG-switched B cell DNA was amplified using S-\u03b3-REV\n(cctgcctcccagtgtcctgcattacttctg)23 , which binds\n3\u2019 of switch-\u03b3-regions, or CH2-\u03b3-REV1, which binds in the IgG-CH2\nconstant region, to allow amplification of alleles carrying a CH1 deletion. DNA deriving\nfrom IgA+ sorted cells was amplified with primer S-\u03b1-REV\n(ctcagtccaacacccaccactcc). All reverse primers mentioned were designed to allow\namplification of various IgG and IgA subclasses. The switch-\u00b5 region of\nna\u00efve B cell gDNA was amplified combining the S-\u00b5-FW primer with\nS-\u00b5-REV (ggaacgcagtgtagactcagctgagg). The PCR reaction was performed using\nHerculase II Fusion DNA Polymerases (Agilent) with 1 M betaine and 3% DMSO in a 50\n\u00b5l volume at 98\u00b0C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 40 s,\n58\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 4 min, with a final extension for 10 min at\n72\u00b0C. Size-selected, purified switch amplicons were sent to GATC Biotech (Germany)\nfor library preparation, barcoding, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing.\n\nOxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was used to generate biological and technical\nreplicates of Illumina MiSeq sequencing runs. For biological replicates, barcodes (BC)\nwere introduced by the addition of recommended BC-sequences to S-\u00b5 and S-\u03b3\nprimers and PCR amplification. The sequencing library was prepared using the Nanopore 2D\nsequencing kit SQK-LSK207, followed by loading onto Nanopore flow cells FLO-MIN106 and\nsequencing with the MinION Mk1B sequencer for up to 20 h.\n\nRecombinant monoclonal antibodies were produced in 293 Expi cells and tested for\nthe ability to stain 3D7-MGD21+ and eight Kenyan parasite isolates2 by flow cytometry. Cryopreserved IEs were thawed,\nstained with 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with\nserial dilutions of the recombinant antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. Antibody\nbinding was detected with 2.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 goat Alexa Fluor\n647-conjugated anti-human IgG.\n\nSelected sera were screened for the presence of LAIR1-containing antibodies that\ncould bind to IEs. A mixture of four parasite isolates (3D7-MGD21+, 9106, 9605\nand 11019) was stained with 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121 DAPI for 30 min at room\ntemperature and incubated with test sera at a 1/30 dilution for 20 min at room\ntemperature. The IEs were then incubated with goat anti-human LAIR1 (R&D Systems,\nAF2664) for 20 min at room temperature. The binding of LAIR1-containing antibodies to the\nIE surface was detected by the simultaneous addition of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey\nanti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-546-147) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey\nanti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 709-606-098).\n\nTotal IgGs were quantified using 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) coated with goat\nanti-human IgG (SouthernBiotech, 2040-01) using Certified Reference Material 470\n(ERMs-DA470, Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. To test specific binding of antibody\nconstructs, ELISA plates were coated with 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of type I\nrecombinant human collagen (Millipore, CC050), 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of an\nanti-human LAIR1 antibody (clone DX26, BD Biosciences 550810), 1 \u03bcg\nml\u22121 of recombinant human GM-CSF (Gentaur), 2 \u03bcg\nml\u22121 of an anti-PD1 or an anti-SLAM antibody (R&D Systems,\nAF1086 and AF164). Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated\nwith titrated antibodies, followed by AP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc\u03b3\nfragment specific (Jackson Immuno Research, 109-056-098). Plates were then washed,\nsubstrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 nm.\n\nB cell supernatants containing secreted antibodies were diluted in\nH2O, 4x sample loading buffer (Life Technologies) and 10x sample reducing agent\n(Life Technologies) and loaded onto precast gels with a 4-12% acrylamide gradient\n(Invitrogen). The iBlot2 apparatus (Life Technologies) was used for protein transfer to\nPVDF membranes followed by blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA in TBS. The\nmembrane was incubated with different combinations of primary and secondary antibodies\ndiluted in TBS/1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature with 2 sequential TBS incubations to\nwash the membrane between incubations. For detection of IgG, anti-human IgG-biotinylated\nantibody (Southern Biotech, 2040-08) was used at 1 \u00b5g ml-1, followed by\n25 ng ml-1 streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson ImmunoResearch,\n016-030-084). IgM isotypes were stained with 10 \u00b5g ml-1 unlabeled goat\nanti-human IgM (Southern Biotech, 2020-01) and 8 ng ml-1 donkey anti-goat HRP\n(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-036-147). To detect LAIR1-containing antibodies, a polyclonal\ngoat anti-human LAIR1 antibody (R&D) at 2 \u00b5g ml-1 was combined\nwith secondary donkey anti-goat HRP. Membranes were developed with ECL-substrate on a\nLas4000 imager (General Electric Company).\n\nEBV immortalized B cells were stained with different fluorescently labeled\nantibodies to detect surface immunoglobulin expression and LAIR1 co-staining (Alexa Fluor\n647-conjugated anti-human IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-606-170; FITC-conjugated\nanti-human kappa, DAKO, F0434, PE-conjugated anti-human lambda, DAKO, R0437; PE-conjugated\nanti-human LAIR1 clone DX26, BD Bioscience, 550811). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry\nand FlowJo software. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by\n4',6-Diamidine-2'-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining. The time\npoint of the analysis was selected for optimal BCR expression levels and for\ndownregulation of the original LAIR1 receptor, because EBV cell lines downregulate the\ninhibitory receptor LAIR1 at an early time point after immortalization but may also\ndecrease surface-Ig levels after certain passages.\n\nWe generated a computational pipeline to analyze targeted amplicons of 300 bp\npaired-end (PE) reads obtained by MiSeq Illumina sequencing methodology (Extended Data Fig. 5). Raw sequences reads were trimmed\nto remove adapter contamination and poor-quality base calls using Trim Galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/, v0.4.2,\nparameters --Illumina --paired -q 20 --length 99). In addition, assessment of the PE reads\nwas performed by average quality score per base position, using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Trimmed reads\nwere aligned in paired-end mode to the GRCh37 human genome assembly using Burrows-Wheeler\nAlignment tool (v0.7.12, parameters: bwa mem)24 .\nThe switch region of the IgH locus was defined on GRCh37, with the following coordinates:\nchr14:106050000-106337000. To find insertions in the IgH switch region locus, we selected\ngenomic ranges when sequence coverage was above 2 reads and/or above 40 reads, thus,\ngenerating two respective and separated workflows, with a sequence length comprises\nbetween 50 bp and 2000 bp. Genome coverage was processed by Bedtools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html, v2.26.0) and a\ndedicated python script using pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam) was written to identify potential\ninsert. Briefly, in both workflows (2 and 40 reads), potential inserts were assigned if\nthey fulfilled the following criteria: (i) one mapping read in 5\u2019 end is chimeric\nwith the switch region (ii) one mapping read in 3\u2019 end is chimeric with the switch\nregion (iii) two discordant reads have their mates read mapped in the switch region.\nAfterwards, inserts coming from 2 and 40 minimum reads coverage were merged according to\nthe following rule: if the difference between two inserts that overlap was equal or below\n10 bp, we kept the shortest one, otherwise the longest one is kept. The list of potential\ninserts was annotated using GENCODE v1925 and\nBEDOPS tools26 and individually validated by a\nde novo assembly of the contig sequence. Non-chimeric, but properly\npaired reads mapping the insert coordinates and chimeric reads corresponding to the\nencompassing mate pairs and spanning mate pairs, were extracted using SAMtools27. Reads mapping to the switch region were extracted\nonly if they were spanning mate pairs related to the insert coordinates. Selected reads\nwere uniquely mapped to the region of interest (no XA tag), with a minimum mapping quality\nof 5. Original reads sequences were retrieved, pull together and used as input files to\nperform a de novo assembly using the Trinity software28. Finally, to validate a contig sequence for each\ninsert, we used BLAST29 (command-line version,\nv2.5.0+). The consensus insert sequences were \u201cblasted\u201d against the switch\nregion and we removed the inserts that had an alignment with at least half of their\nsequence length at a minimum 80 % identity (parameters: -task megablast -dust no\n-perc_identity 80). Then, we blasted each contig sequence against the switch region\nsequence and the consensus insert sequence (parameters: -task blastn -dust no\n-perc_identity 70) to confirm if the contig was made of the complete insert sequence and\nif the contig contained two flanking sequences of at least 50bp that matched the switch\nregion. The shortest contig that fulfilled the criteria mentioned above was selected for\neach insert.\n\nTo analyze targeted amplicon 2-4 kb reads obtained by ONT sequencing\nmethodology, we developed a pipeline (Extended Data Fig.\n6). Raw sequences reads were quality-filtered using Metrichor basecaller\n(https://metrichor.com/s/). 2D reads with a sequence length above 1000bp (or\n2000bp depending on the primers used for the amplification) were aligned against GRCh37\nhuman genome assembly with LAST software30\n(parameters: last-train and lastal -p ONT_fasta_sequences.par last-split -m1e-6). Then we\nparsed LAST output and selected reads that contain an insert (minimum 50 bp length), two\nflanking regions of minimum 100 bp mapping to the switch region (switch locus defined as\nchr14:106050000-106337000) and allowing a gap of 100 bp maximum between the insert and the\nswitch region. Finally, we merged the insert coordinates of the overlapping inserts with\nbedtools and annotated the inserts list with GENCODE v1925 using BEDOPS tool26. Scripts are\navailable at MinION and Illumina inserts coordinates were merged with Bedtools (merge\ncommand with default parameter). The circular genomic representation of the inserts has\nbeen generated using the Circos software31. Switch\ninserts with genic (intron or exon-intron) origin were subjected to an enrichment analysis\nusing EnrichR and the Human Gene Atlas as the gene-set library32,33.\n\nThe number n described in the figure legends refers to the number of independent\nexperiments. The analysis of the relationship between the presence of LAIR1-containing\nantibodies and protection from malaria was performed in the R statistical environment\n(v3.2.5). Two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact tests were performed to investigate the\nassociation between LAIR1-containing antibodies and protection from febrile malaria.\n\nScripts for Illumina and MinION sequence analysis are available at https://bitbucket.org/mathildefog/switchillumina and https://bitbucket.org/mathildefog/switchminion, respectively.\n\nSequence data of the monoclonal antibodies isolated in this study have been\ndeposited in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) with the accession codes indicated in\nSupplementary Table 1. The NGS\ndata for switch region sequencing are deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with\nthe accession code PRJNA382214 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA382214). The analysis of these\nsequences are provided in Supplementary\nTables 2, 3 and 4."}
