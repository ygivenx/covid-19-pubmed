{"title": "Respiratory syncytial virus-associated illness in adults with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure", "body": "obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) affect millions of people worldwide and have been identified as risk factors for severe RSV infection. 2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In addition, these patients may present primarily with symptoms of decompensated heart failure or acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), and the role of viral infection is unappreciated. 11 Although molecular diagnostic testing has markedly improved the recognition of RSV and other respiratory viruses in these settings, adult RSV remains an underrecognized problem.\n\nThe most effective means of preventing infectious diseases is vaccination because this approach can be deployed to protect the largest at-risk group possible. Presently, a successful RSV vaccine remains elusive, while passive immunoprophylaxis with a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, in high-risk infants has been shown to reduce RSV hospitalizations. 12 Although all older adults are at increased risk of more severe RSV infection, certain subgroups such as those with severe COPD or CHF may be at even greater risk and could potentially benefit from passive immunoprophylaxis if infection rates and severity are found to be substantial. There are limited data available on the incidence of RSV infection in adults with Class III or IV COPD and/or CHF. This observational study was designed to collect data in a high-risk population of adults with exposure to children who might exhibit both high rates of infection and severe illness when infected with RSV.\n\nThis was a prospective and observational study conducted across multiple consecutive RSV seasons to determine the incidence rate of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MARI) or events leading to worsening cardiorespiratory status in adults with severe COPD and/or advanced CHF associated with RSV and other viral infections.\n\nFifty-seven sites in nine countries (Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Sweden, and the United States) in the Northern hemisphere participated in the study from fall 2011 through spring 2014. The protocol was approved by independent institutional review boards, and all subjects signed written informed consent at enrollment.\n\nThe study population included adults \u226550 years of age with severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage III/ IV) and/or CHF (New York Heart Association Class III/IV or American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association Stage C/D) and had expected exposure to children (<18 years of age) at least once a month.\n\nAn acute respiratory illness (ARI) was defined as new onset or worsening of at least two of the following respiratory symptoms (sore throat, nasal congestion or discharge, hoarseness, cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain) or one respiratory symptom and \u22651 systemic symptoms (feverishness, fatigue, headache, and myalgia). Worsening cardiorespiratory events were defined as follows: AECOPD: worsening of \u22652 major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence) for \u22652 consecutive days; or worsening of any one major symptom together with anyone minor symptom (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, or increased cough or wheeze) for \u22652 consecutive days. Worsening of CHF was defined as a change in \u22651 symptom or sign (pulmonary edema, dyspnea, weight gain \u22655 pounds, pedal edema, jugular venous distension, and tachycardia and tachypnea) beyond normal day-to-day variation and warranting medication changes. MARI was considered any illness where a subject sought outpatient, inpatient, or over-the-phone medical consultation for ARI or worsening cardiorespiratory status. Subjects were considered to have per protocol RSV-MARI if they had a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the acute phase of illness and/or a \u22654-fold increase in RSV-specific serum antibody in the period surrounding the health care visit. \n\nThree different PCR assays were used to test for RSV in nasal and sputum samples. These included the GenMark respiratory viral panel (www.genmarkdx.com) 13 that tests for 14 common respiratory viruses and subtypes, an M gene-based PCR assay 14 and an assay that detects RSV F and N genes. 15 Serology: RSV-specific antibodies were measured at enrollment, at the time of MARI (acute), approximately 30 days after illness (convalescent) and each October and May. Serum antibodies were measured using an RSV neutralizing antibody assay and a 4-plex RSV F, Ga, Gb, and N-specific IgG electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay on the MesoScale Discovery platform. 16 An RSV seroresponse was defined as >4-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titer or to any RSV antigen in the ECL assay over seasonal baseline or between samples.\n\nContinuous variables were summarized by descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, median, and range. Confidence intervals were two-sided unless otherwise stated. The primary endpoint objective of the study was to determine the incidence rate of inpatient and outpatient RSV-MARI across multiple consecutive RSV seasons. Primary endpoint analysis and secondary outcomes (allcause MARI and death) were performed with adjustment for individual subject follow-up time.\n\nFour hundred fifty-three subjects were enrolled in the study between An inverse relationship between serum RSV antibody levels and incidence of RSV-MARI was observed ( Figure 2 ). Higher antibody levels to each of the RSV antigens were associated with a lower incidence of RSV-MARI, and the relationship was most clearly seen in season 2 possibly due to more subjects with RSV-MARI and available serology in season 2 versus season 3 (20 vs 8, respectively). Season 1 was not included because subjects were being enrolled throughout the year, and preseason blood was not available for many subjects.\n\nIn addition to the 42 subjects with per protocol RSV-MARI, an additional 57 RSV infections were also identified. Of these, 55 had For all viruses, the addition of sputum testing resulted in (11.8%-50.0%) increased viral detections during illness (Table 3) . for severe illness and hospitalizations in prior studies. 6, 7, [18] [19] [20] However, in our population of adults with Class III/IV COPD and CHF, it was surprising that illnesses were not as severe as expected.\n\nIn a previous study of high-risk adults with COPD and CHF of varying stages including mild or moderate disease, the rate of RSV-MARI was 4.40/100 person-seasons, similar to the rate of 4.68 observed in this study. 2 In that study, 16% of high-risk patients were hospitalized and 4% died when infected with RSV. When all RSV infections, including serologic diagnoses in this study, were considered, 17% of RSV-infected subjects were hospitalized and there were no deaths.\n\nNotably, 35% of infected patients either were asymptomatic or had a mild illness that did not require any medical intervention.\n\nRegular exposure to children required for participation in this study may have led to higher infection rates (7%-14.6%) compared with those observed in previous surveillance and vaccine studies (2%-3%). 21, 22 One explanation for lack of severe illness in this very frail population might be that regular exposure to children resulted in recent RSV infections before the study leading to increased protective baseline immunity. 23 attention. Influenza with abrupt illness onset and fever tends to drive patients to seek medical attention within several days. 5 The typical RSV illness begins with a cold and progresses over several days to dyspnea and wheezing. The average time to seek medical attention is 5-6 days by which time virus may no longer be detectable in the upper airways. 33, 34 In addition, because RSV infection in adults represents reinfection, a rapid amnestic antibody response may obscure a rise in antibody if acute sera collection is delayed. Finally, because the analysis of acute and convalescent sera is not possible in patients that die, results may have been biased toward milder illness.\n\nIn summary, RSV, as well as other respiratory viruses, led to significant morbidity in high-risk persons with cardiopulmonary disease. The finding that RSV can result in relatively mild disease in patients with very advanced COPD and CHF highlights the incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis in adults. Given our results, immunoprophylaxis with an RSV monoclonal antibody of a select high-risk adult population may not be practical.\n\nHowever, given the overall burden of RSV in older adults, programs to develop vaccines for active immunization may be a feasible approach.\n\nWe would like to thank the study participants and the site investigators listed as follows: Marc Afilalo/Canada, Andreea"}
