{"title": "Infectious bronchitis virus attaches to lipid rafts and enters cells via clathrin mediated endocytosis", "body": "Most viruses take advantage of cellular endocytic pathways to enter their host 60 cells (1, 2). Once internalized, virus particles move through a dynamic network of 61 endocytic vesicles, which undergoes gradual sorting and complex maturation events. 62 Endosome maturation, in turn, triggers conformational changes and dissociation 63 events in the incoming viruses, which ultimately lead to the delivery of the viral 64 genome and associated proteins into the cytoplasm. In general, while non-enveloped 6 (44); however, the endocytic pathway that IBV hijacks is unclear. 135 The early step in the entry process of IBV into target cells is initiated by 136 engagement of the S glycoprotein with the receptor. Here, using several cell lines 137 permissive to IBV Beaudette strain, we report that IBV virion attaches to lipid rafts in 138 the cell surface and the efficient entry of IBV into cells requires the presence of intact 139 lipid rafts. We also address IBV entry pathway by systematically perturbing the Inhibitors and antibodies.

Viability of drug-treated cells was measured 218 using the WST-1 Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit (Beyotime, Haimen, 219 China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded in 96-well 220 plate and treated with indicated drugs, 10 \u03bcl of WST-1 was added to each well and 221 incubated for 1 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was monitored and the reference 222 wavelength was set at 630 nm. The viability of cells was calculated by comparison to 223 that of untreated cells.\n\nTo assess the effect of NH 4 Cl on the pH change of acidic intracellular vesicles,\n\nVero cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NH 4 Cl for 30 min at 37\u2103, 226 followed by staining with 1 mg/ml acridine orange in serum free medium for 15 min 227 at 37\u2103.

Cells (5 \u00d7 10 7 ) were incubated with IBV (MOI of 5) at 238 4\u2103 for 1 h, or mock-infected. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in 1 ml TNE lysis 239 buffer with 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail.\n\nThe cell lysates were centrifuged at 4000\u00d7g for 5 min at 4\u2103, to remove cell debris 241 and nuclei. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 1 ml of TNE buffer with 242 80% sucrose, placed at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with 6 ml 243 of 30% and 3 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE buffer. The lysates were ultracentrifuged at 244 38000\u00d7rpm for 18 h at 4\u2103 in an SW41 rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, 12 fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top to the bottom of the tube and 246 subjected to 8% or 10% SDS\u2212PAGE, followed by Western blotting using antibodies 247 of anti-Flotillin-1, anti-N protein, or anti-S protein.

Whereas 387 some work states that heparan sulfate is a selective attachment factor for the IBV 388 Beaudette strain (48), another report concludes that sialic acid is a receptor To test this hypothesis, Vero cells were incubated with IBV for 1 h at 4\u2103 and lipid Although previous study demonstrates that IBV strain Beaudette entry is 411 sensitive to drug treatment that neutralize the low pH of endosomes in BHK cells (44), 412 author/funder.

Thus, to dissect the IBV entry pathway, it is necessary to verify whether 414 the low pH dependent entry of IBV is cell type specific. To this end, we increased the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/352898 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nSeveral pH-dependent endocytic pathways are used by various viruses, including 444 CME, CavME, macropinocytosis, and clathrin/caveolin-independent endocytosis (55).\n\nTo identify the endocytic pathway employed by IBV, pharmacological inhibition, 446 siRNA-mediated depletion, and overexpression of dominant negative or constitutive 447 active proteins were carried out to block or strengthen respective endocytic pathway. 448 First, we investigated the effect on IBV entry by diverse pharmacological drugs 449 treatments which have been well known to inhibit CME, CavME, or 450 macropinocytosis. Vero, H1299, and DF-1 cells were exposed to increasing The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/352898 doi: bioRxiv preprint dose dependent manner, while Amiloride and Nystatin pretreatment had no effect ( Fig.   472 5I). Thus, these results reveal that IBV enters cells via CME, but not via 473 macropinocytosis. Whether the CavME is involved in IBV endocytosis may be cell 474 type dependent and is controversial. To explore the involvement of CavME in IBV 475 entry, we utilized Huh7 cell, which lacks functional caveolae (15, 60), to perform The release of progeny virus particle was also determined by TCID 50 . Results in Fig.   516 6C showed that expression of dynamin1-DN significantly reduced progeny virus 517 production by around 0.5-fold, but dynamin1-WT, Eps15-WT, and Eps15-DN had no 518 significant effect on this, compared to those in GFP expressing cells. In all, above 519 results suggest that IBV entry depends on functional dynamin1, but not Eps15. H1299 and Vero cells (Fig. 7A, C) ; however, silence of Eps15 expression had no 527 significant effect on the IBV gRNA internalization (Fig. 7B) . Moreover, although 528 author/funder.

These data further confirmed although IBV 530 entry is dependent on CME, Eps15 is not required. Furthermore, knock down of 531 dynamin1 (by 92%) was accompanied by a significant reduction of the amount of 532 incoming IBV gRNA (by 48%) and IBV protein expression (by 71%) (Fig. 7E-G) . 533 Collectively, these results indicate that dynamin1, but not Eps15, is functionally 534 required for IBV entry. IBV infection (Fig. 9B) . These data reveal that IBV could not infect cells expressing inhibited VSV infection (Fig. 9D) . Collectively, these data indicate that major IBV 658 virions are delivered to early endosomes after CME, followed by transferring to late 659 endosomes.\n\nKnock down of Rab5 or Rab7 was carried out to confirm above conclusion.\n\nH1299 cells were transfected with siRab5 or siRab7, followed with IBV infection.\n\nThe knock down effect of Rabs and IBV N protein expression was examined by 663 Western blot.

Altogether, these data further confirm that after internalized by 673 CME, both early and late endosomes are required for IBV transport. implying that IBV membranes undergo fusion with late endosome/lysosome 696 membranes at 3 h.p.i. or between 2-3 h.p.i.. We also performed above fusion 697 experiment by using well studied VSV labeled with R18/DiOC as control, which has 698 been reported to fuse with early endosomes.

At 20 and 30 701 min.p.i., green spots were detected, co-localized with Rab5 (pink spots with white 702 arrows in third and fourth panels), consistent with previous report (73). In all, we 703 demonstrate that IBV fuses with late endosome/lysosome at 2-3 h.p.i., and its 704 intracellular trafficking is slower than VSV.\n\nOur results so far demonstrate that IBV pass through early and late endosomes. (Fig. 11A) , however, the virus 720 internalization was not increased (Fig. 11B) , indicating VCP plays a role 721 post-internalization. The higher rate of viral gRNA replication associated with VCP 722 expression was also detected with RT-PCR by using primers targeting to negative 723 stranded gRNA (Fig. 11C) . Immunofluorescence in Fig.11D showed that GFP-VCP further confirm our observations, we used inhibitor CPZ to interfere with CME, or 798 knock down of CHC siRNA to specifically block CME, and we found that IBV 799 internalization and gene expression were significantly decreased. This evidence 800 determines the importance of CME in IBV entry, which is widely hijacked by various 801 envelope viruses. Moreover, the importance of dynamin1, a GTPase that helps to snap 802 the vesicle from plasma membrane, was determined during IBV entry. Lipid rafts is 803 often considered to be involved in CavME. To explain these contradictory \n\nIn conclusion, we conduct a systematic study to dissect IBV entry process in 834 susceptible cell lines. The evidence presented here indicates that IBV attaches to lipid 835 rafts, induces actin de-polymerization, internalizes into clathrin coated vesicles via 836 dynamin1 snapping, transports along early/late endosome, and lysosome, finally fuses 837 with late endosome-lysosome membrane, releases genome in to cytoplasm (Fig. 12) .
