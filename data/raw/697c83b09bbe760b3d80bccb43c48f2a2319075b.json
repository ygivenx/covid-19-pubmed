{"title": "", "body": "One use of cytology is to classify lesions so as to assist with the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of a case. Cytologic interpretations are generally classifi ed into one of fi ve cytodiagnostic groups (Box 2-1). A sixth category can be used for nondiagnostic interpretations. Nondiagnostic samples usually result from insuffi cient cellular material or excessive blood contamination.\n\nKEY POINT Interpretation of cytologic material may include more than one category, such as infl ammation along with a response to tissue injury or neoplasia with infl ammation.\n\nNormal and hyperplastic tissues are both composed primarily of mature cell types. Normal cells display uniformity in cellular, nuclear, and nucleolar size and shape. Cytoplasmic volume is usually high relative to the nucleus (Figs. 2-1 and 2-2). Hyperplasia is a nonneoplastic enlargement of tissue that can occur in response to hormonal disturbances or tissue injury. Hyperplastic tissue has a tendency to enlarge symmetrically in comparison to neoplasia. Cytologically, hyperplastic cells have a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio than normal cells. Examples of hyperplastic responses include nodular proliferations within the parenchyma of the prostate (Fig. 2-3) , liver, and pancreas ( Fig. 2-4 ).\n\nCystic lesions contain liquid or semisolid material. The low-protein liquid usually contains a small number of cells. These benign lesions may result from proliferation of lining cells or tissue injury. Examples include seroma , salivary mucocele, apocrine sweat gland cyst, epidermal/follicular cyst, and cysts associated with noncutaneous glands such as the mammary gland or prostate ( Fig. 2-6 \n\nInfl ammatory conditions are classifi ed cytologically by the predominance of the cell type involved. Recognition of the infl ammatory cell type often suggests an etiologic condition. Purulent or suppurative lesions contain greater than 85% neutrophils; they are then classifi ed by the presence or absence of degeneration affecting the neutrophil. Nondegenerate neutrophils are morphologically normal and predominate in relatively nontoxic environments such as immune-mediated conditions, neoplastic lesions ( Fig. 2-7) , and sterile lesions caused by irritants such as urine and bile. Degenerate neutrophils display nuclear swelling and decreased stain intensity termed karyolysis ( Fig. 2-8) , indicating rapid cell death in a toxic environment (Perman et al., 1979) . Increased nuclear staining with coalescence of the nucleus into a single round mass and an intact cellular membrane characterizes pyknosis ( Fig. 2-9 ), a slow, progressive change often within a relatively nontoxic environment. An end stage of cell death, termed karyorrhexis, may be seen cytologically as the result of pyknosis of hypersegmented nuclei ( Fig. 2-10 ). Degenerate neutrophils predominate in bacterial infections, particularly gram-negative types. Under septic conditions, bacteria may be found intracellularly ( Fig. 2-11) .\n\nHistiocytic or macrophagic lesions contain a predominance of macrophages, suggesting chronic infl ammation ( Fig. 2-12 ). In granulomas, activated macrophages that morphologically resemble epithelial cells are termed epithelioid macrophages. These cells may merge to form giant multinucleated forms ( Fig. 2-13 ). The granulomatous lesions are often associated with foreign body reactions and mycobacterial infection.\n\nPyogranulomatous or mixed cell infl ammatory lesions contain a mixture of neutrophils and macrophages ( Fig. 2-14 ) that may include increased numbers of infl ammatory cells (see Fig. 2-14) . A monomorphic population of lymphoid cells without other infl ammatory cells present suggests lymphoid neoplasia.\n\nCytologic samples often contain evidence of tissue injury in addition to cyst formation, infl ammation, or neoplasia. These changes include hemorrhage, proteinaceous debris, cholesterol crystals, necrosis, and fi brosis.\n\nHemorrhage that is pathologic can be distinguished from blood contamination encountered during the cytologic collection. Blood contamination is associated with the presence of numerous erythrocytes and platelets. Acute hemorrhage is associated with engulfment of erythrocytes by macrophages termed erythrophagocytosis ( Fig. 2-16 ). Chronic hemorrhage is associated with active lymphocytes or plasma cells. This type of infl ammation is often associated with foreign body reactions, fungal infections, mycobacterial infections, panniculitis, lick granulomas, and other chronic tissue injuries.\n\nEosinophilic lesions contain greater than 10% eosinophils in addition to other infl ammatory cell types ( Fig. 2-15 ). They are seen with or without mast cell involvement. This infl ammatory response is associated with eosinophilic granuloma, hypersensitivity or allergic conditions, parasitic migrations, fungal infections, mast cell tumors, and other neoplastic conditions that induce eosinophilopoiesis.\n\nLymphocytic or plasmacytic infi ltration is often associated with allergic or immune reactions, early viral infections, and chronic infl ammation. The lymphoid population is heterogeneous, with small or intermediatesized lymphocytes and plasma cells mixed with other \u25a0 FIGURE 2-15. Eosinophilic infl ammation. Transtracheal wash. Cat. Clinical presentation of a chronic cough in this cat with suspected pulmonary allergy. Fluid contains 95% eosinophils. Pictured are several eosinophils that stain pink to blue-green and adhere to pink mucous material. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.) cells, usually lymphocytes, that are discrete, round, lightly basophilic structures (Flanders et al., 1993) . Nuclear streaming refers to linear pink to purple strands of nuclear remnants (Fig. 2-21 ) produced by excessive tissue handling during cytologic preparation or with necrotic material when sampled. Clear to light-pink amorphous strands representing collagen (Fig. 2-22A ) may be admixed with spindle cells and endothelium into a fi brovascular stroma. However, when these collagen fi bers undergo damage (as in the collagenolysis associated with mast cell tumor), degranulating eosinophils release collagenase that produces dense, hyalinized pink collagen bands ( Fig. 2-22B ). Amyloid is an uncommon pathologic protein found between cells. It appears amorphous, eosinophilic, and hyaline and may be associated with chronic infl ammation. macrophages containing degraded blood pigment within their cytoplasm-for example, blue-green to black hemosiderin granules (Figs. 2-17 and 2-18 ) or yellow rhomboid hematoidin crystals (Fig. 2-18) . Hemosiderin represents an excess aggregation of ferritin molecules or micelles. This form of iron storage becomes visible by light microscopy and stains blue with the Prussian blue reaction. Hematoidin crystals do not contain iron although they are formed during anaerobic breakdown of hemoglobin such as may occur within tissues or cavities. Hematomas often contain phagocytized erythrocytes if the lesion is acute, or hemosiderin-laden macrophages if the lesion is chronic.\n\nProteinaceous debris may be seen within the background of the preparation. Mucus stains lightly basophilic and appears amorphous (Fig. 2-19 ). Lymphoglandular bodies (Fig. 2-20 Cholesterol crystals represent evidence of cell membrane damage that is found in the background of some cytologic preparations. These rectangular, plated crystals are transparent unless background staining is enhanced as, for example, with new methylene blue stain (Fig. 2-23) . The crystals are most often associated with epidermal/follicular cysts.\n\nNecrosis and fi brosis may occur together or separately in some cytologic preparations. The death of cells is represented by fuzzy, indistinct cell outlines and defi nition of cell type (Fig. 2-24) . A reparative response accompanying tissue injury involves increased fi broblastic activity. It is common to see very reactive fi brocytes (Fig. 2-25 ) along with severe infl ammation. One must be careful not to overinterpret this reactivity as a neoplastic condition.\n\nNeoplasia is initially diagnosed when a monomorphic cell population is present and signifi cant infl ammation is lacking. Further division into benign and malignant types is based on cytomorphologic characteristics. Benign cells display uniformity in size, nuclear-tocytoplasmic ratio, and other nuclear features. Malignant cells often display three or more criteria (Box 2-2 and Figs. 2-26 to 2-32) of cellular immaturity or atypia, which should be identifi ed before a diagnosis of malignancy is made. In cases of an equivocal diagnosis or severe infl ammation, histopathologic examination is recommended. \n\nNeoplasms may be divided into four general categories to assist in making the cytologic interpretation by restricting the list of differential diagnoses (Perman et al., 1979, Alleman and Bain, 2000) . The categories listed in Table 2 -1 are based not on cell origin or function but rather on their general cytomorphologic characteristics. The fi rst two terms are taken from embryology (Noden and de Lahunta, 1985) .\n\nThis type of neoplasm is associated with a clustered arrangement of cells into ball shapes or monolayer sheets. Cell origin of these neoplasms often involves glandular or parenchymal tissue and lining surfaces. Examples of epithelial neoplasms include lung adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 2-33) , perianal adenoma (hepatoid tumor), basal cell tumor, sebaceous adenoma, transitional cell carcinoma (Fig. 2-34) , and mesothelioma. Specifi c cytologic features of epithelial neoplasms include the following characteristics:\n\n\u2022 Cells exfoliate in tight clumps or sheets \u2022 Cells adhere to each other and may display distinct tight junctions, termed desmosomes ( Fig. 2- \n\nNeoplasms with a mesenchymal appearance resemble the embryonic connective tissue, mesenchyme. This tissue is loosely arranged with usually abundant extracellular matrix (Noden and de Lahunta, 1985) and individualized spindle or stellate cells (Bacha 2000) . Benign and malignant mesenchymal neoplasms often originate from connective tissue elements, such as fi broblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, myocytes, and vascular lining cells. Examples of mesenchymal neoplasms include hemangiosarcoma ( Fig. 2-36) , osteosarcoma ( Fig. 2-37) , hemangiopericytoma, and amelanotic melanoma (Fig. 2-38) . \n\nThese neoplasms have discrete, round cellular shapes and are often associated with hematopoietic cells. Examples of round cell neoplasms include mast cell tumor, histiocytoma, lymphoma ( Fig. 2-39) , plasmacytoma, and transmissible venereal tumor (Fig. 2-40) . Specifi c cytologic characteristics of round cell neoplasms include the following:\n\n\u2022 Cells exfoliate individually, having distinct cytoplasmic borders \u2022 Cell shape is generally round \u2022 Samples are moderately cellular \u2022 Cells are usually smaller compared with epithelial cells \u2022 Nuclei are round to indented\n\nNaked nuclei neoplasms have a loosely adherent cellular arrangement with free nuclei. This cytologic appearance is an artifact related to the fragile nature of these cells. These neoplasms are usually associated with endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors. Examples include thyroid tumors (Fig. 2-41) , islet cell tumors, and paragangliomas ( Fig. 2-42 Round to oval nuclei, anisokaryosis, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, prominent and variably shaped nucleoli, and individualized cells with poorly distinct cytoplasmic borders suggest a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm. This lesion is from a gum mass with a histologically confi rmed diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma. One cell in the center contains small amounts of melanin pigment granules. (Aqueous-based Wright; HP oil.) \u25a0 FIGURE 2-39. Round (discrete) cell neoplasm. Tissue aspirate. Dog. Discrete cells with a round shape, distinct cytoplasmic borders, and a very high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio are characteristic of lymphoid cells. This sample is taken from a lymph node effaced by lymphoma cells. (Wright-Giemsa; HP oil.)\n\n\u2022 Cell shape is generally round to polygonal \u2022 Samples are highly cellular \u2022 Nuclei are round to indented KEY POINT The use of these four cytomorphologic categories may help to classify neoplastic lesions by their general cellular appearance and suggest specifi c tumor types. Remember that these categories may not fi t well for some neoplasms, especially for poorly differentiated tumors. It is recommended that biopsy specimens for histopathologic examination be taken to determine the specifi c tumor type and extent of the lesion. Cervical mass in the area of the thyroid from an animal with a honking cough. Cytologically the sample presents as a syncytium of round nuclei with relatively uniform features. This is characteristic of an endocrine mass. Typically the distinction between hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma is diffi cult cytologically and sometimes histologically.

Magnetic resonance imaging suggested a mass involving the osseous bulla. Surgery found a mass at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Cytologically, the preparation contains mostly loose or free round nuclei against a fi nely granular eosinophilic background. Few intact cells remain with pale cytoplasm at the edges and center. Adjacent to the center intact cell is a nucleated red cell (arrow) suggestive of extramedullary hematopoiesis. The histologic diagnosis is paraganglioma, specifi cally a malignant chemodectoma in this case, since it metastasized and was thought to involve the chemoreceptor organ in that site.
