{"title": "Twentieth anniversary of the European Union health mandate: taking stock of perceived achievements, failures and missed opportunities \u2013 a qualitative study", "body": "The Maastricht Treaty from 1992 marked the beginning of the health mandate of the European Union (EU) as enshrined today in Article 168 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union)\n[1]. The original EU health mandate focused primarily on stimulating cooperation between member states and supporting national actions (Art. 129 (1), Treaty of the European Union (TEU))\n[2]. It embodied the Union with only limited legislative powers on health matters. Although this initial mandate was enhanced through subsequent Treaties, today Article 168, still gives the EU relatively circumscribed power in areas of public health (Art. 168 (4), TFEU). Healthcare continues to remain a national competence and in this regard, the EU \u201cshall respect the responsibilities of the member states for the definition of their health policy and for the organization and delivery of their health services\u201d (Art. 168 (7), TFEU). Despite the restricted Treaty-based mandate for health, the EU has a relevant role to play in national public health and health systems policies and has expanded its remit in areas beyond the Treaty\n[3]. Areas affected by EU provisions are extensively described in the literature\n[4-11]. To illustrate the main developments in the area of what can be called \u201cEU health policy\u201d a timeline is illustrated in Table \n1. However, because of its limited legal mandate, some EU legal initiatives were highly contested\n[12,13].\n\nTherefore, one can pose the question of what has been achieved over the last twenty years. It may be argued that, despite its narrow legislative scope, the health mandate has triggered important European actions in certain public health areas like tobacco control\n[14,15], infectious disease control\n[16,17], European guidelines\n[18-20] and the development of an EU public health infrastructure\n[21]. In recent years, the EC has summarized in annual reports a diverse nature of key public health achievements such as communications and recommendations, health policies, EC co-financed actions and established networks (e.g. high level groups, scientific committees, platforms)\n[22-24]. However, stakeholders in the field provide examples indicating that public health relevant EU policies such as single EU policy assessments on the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)\n[25,26], pharmaceuticals\n[27], or the Health in All Policy (HiAP) approach\n[28] do not always meet the expectations of the public health community. In these papers the authors express concerns about potentially detrimental health effects\n[25,26] or disappointment about the support of the policies and approaches aimed at improving health in Europe\n[27,28]. Also, EU agencies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are described as agencies with a limited legal mandate, competences and resources for EU public health but, at the same time, with promising prospects to develop as a renowned international player in the field\n[29].\n\nIn addition, an evaluation of the EU Health Strategy acknowledges its status as a guiding framework for EC health policies and joint EC and member state actions on health but also identifies the missing impact of the Strategy on other EC policies as well as on member state health policies and actions\n[30]. Evaluations of the EU public health programmes, which are one of the EC\u2019s financial instruments to implement its strategic health goals, criticize missing prioritization of topics, barriers for participation in projects for some member states and ineffective dissemination of project results\n[31,32]. Hence, the available evidence of the impact of EU health policies, infrastructure, and actions is elusive, and the identification of the value of public health relevant EU-level actions across all policies is lacking.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to explore and provide an overview of influential public health relevant EU-level policy outputs and a summary of policy outputs or actions perceived as an achievement, a failure or a missed opportunity by interviewing key experts in the field. By this, we intend to establish a qualitative indication of which EU health policies have contributed to the improvement of population health in Europe.\n\nExperts were purposely selected to ensure heterogeneity of opinions. The selection was based on their individual profile and professional affiliation. We selected experts that were renowned in the field due to their current or former affiliation to specific EU-level bodies and institutions, research institutes with EU focus, or EU-level non- governmental organization. Selected experts were actively involved in public health research, policy-making, policy advice or advocacy performed at EU level, internally or externally. In addition, snowball sampling was applied until data saturation was reached. Data saturation was assumed as soon as no new EU public health policy actions and their perceptions were mentioned during the interviews.\n\nThe potential participants were contacted between December 2011 and March 2012 by a short information email to identify whether they were interested to participate in the interview study. Of 22 contacted experts, twenty participated in this study, one participant could not confirm participation due to time constraints and another did not respond to the invitation. Of those twenty experts nine belonged to the initial purposively selected sample and eleven were identified during the snowball sampling procedure based on recommendations of already interviewed experts. The majority of experts was affiliated to an institution located in Brussels (n = 10). The composition of the study sample in terms of represented professional affiliations is outlined in Table \n2.\n\nUpon agreement by the participant, an appointment for the interview was made and participants received an informative letter with more in-depth information about the goal of the study and an informed consent form in which the voluntary basis of the participation has been clarified and anonymized data handling was assured.\n\nInterviews were conducted either face-to-face (n = 4) or via telephone, or Voice over IP (n = 16) in the period between January and March 2012 and were held in English, Dutch or German by one of the three principal investigators (NR, TC, KS). The interviews lasted from 35 to 90 minutes. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymized.\n\nThe interviews were performed using a specifically designed semi-structured interview guide. The guide was developed on the basis of previous desktop research and an internal brainstorming session of an advisory research group consisting of the three principal investigators, four senior researchers, and one junior researcher of the Department of International Health at Maastricht University to identify items relevant for investigating expert perceptions on European public health policy. During the course of this process, a list of public health relevant EU policy outputs, processes or procedures that were regarded as achievements, failures or missed opportunities were first gathered individually and then, following a group discussion, a common list was compiled. This output was used to construct the interview guide containing six guiding themes from which open-ended questions were formulated. The guiding themes included (1) a description of the individual role of the expert in European public health, (2) the individual definition of European public health, (3) the assessment of public health relevant EU-level actions as being an achievement, missed opportunity or failure, (4) the formulation of five influential European policy outputs, (5) consequences of European health policy, and (6) the policy process at the European level. The semi-structured interview guide was used as a framework for the interviews and allowed the interviewers to address other relevant topics that emerged during the interviews.\n\nAfter completion of interviews the three principal investigators initially performed an internal analysis of each separate interview and an analysis across interviews to identify the scope of EU-level actions and experts\u2019 perceptions of these actions as achievements, failures or missed opportunities\n[34]. Afterwards, a directed (or deductive) content analysis approach\n[35,36] was applied whereby the initially predefined coding scheme with the main categories of interest (achievement, failure, and missed opportunity) was used to summarize the respective topics and the reasoning that appeared during the interviews. Topics that did not fit into one of these main categories were added as new codes and were organized into new categories. The analysis was jointly performed by the principal investigators using NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 9).\n\nFurthermore, the results of the content analysis on achievements, failures and missed opportunities were grouped according to the major common themes in a table to provide an overview of the perceptions of the key informants. Prominent EU-level outputs or actions, which were discussed by almost all respondents, are described in more detail in the results section. Where applicable, we used original quotes to illustrate the views and tendencies of experts\u2019 assessments. The professional profile and study ID of respondents are indicated behind the respective quotes. Quotes which were originally given in Dutch or German were translated into English.\n\nA slightly adapted nominal group technique\n[37] was used for triangulation purposes. During the interviews, the participants were asked for five influential policy outputs of European health policy-making. Following the finalization of all interviews, all participant nominations were compiled in one list and reoccurring topics were removed. To ensure comparability of policy outputs and actions, we grouped the nominations into categories under the following headlines: (a) secondary legislation and court decisions; (b) soft laws, strategies, and programmes; (c) agencies, centres, organizations; (d) networks, policy platforms, cooperation; and (e) others. Participants were asked in an online survey to select three outputs per category which were, according to their opinion, most influential. Based on the participants\u2019 nominations, a ranking in terms of a frequency distribution of selected influential policy outputs for each category was determined. The online survey was completed by 18 out of 20 participants who took part in the interviews.\n\nThe design and analysis of the study was guided by applying Guba and Lincoln\u2019s test for trustworthiness\n[38]. Credibility and dependability have been ensured by enlarging the sample until saturation was reached in terms of the identification of EU policy actions and their perceptions. Moreover, three researchers in the primary research group in combination with an internal advisory research group were involved with the aim of reflecting upon the study design and critically questioning the findings. Additionally, the primary research group met regularly during the interview period to exchange initial findings and experiences on the interview process. The members of the internal advisory research group were experienced in EU public health policy research or qualitative research methodologies. The confirmability was strengthened by the use of several investigators both in the data collection process and in the analysis phase, combined with the use of triangulation, where interview participants were also asked to participate in the ranking exercise.\n\nThe Medical Ethical Committee of the University Hospital Maastricht and University Maastricht declared that no ethical approval was required for this type of research. All participants were informed about their role and rights as study participant prior to their interview participation. All participants provided written or audio-recorded informed consent to be interviewed.\n\nThe ranking of influential policy outputs of EU-level health policy-making is provided in Table \n3.\n\nIn the category \u201csecondary legislation and court decisions\u201d, the patients\u2019 rights decisions made by the European Court of Justice (n = 12) were chosen by most of the respondents as influential policy output, followed by the Directive on the application of patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare\n[39] (n = 10) and the Directive on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products\n[14] (n = 9). In the category entitled \u201csoft laws, strategies, and programmes\u201d, the first and second EU public health programmes\n[40,41] (n = 9) were selected most frequently, followed by the 2008\u20132013 health strategy \u201cTogether for Health\u201d\n[42] (n = 6). The third rank is shared by three policy outputs: the \u201cFramework for action in the field of public health\u201d\n[43] (n = 5) which is the Commission\u2019s first proposal setting out EU-level public health after the introduction of the health mandate in the Maastricht Treaty, the Council conclusions \u201cTowards modern, responsive and sustainable health systems\u201d\n[44] (n = 5), and the current over-arching European strategy \u201cEurope 2020\u201d\n[45] (n = 5). In the third category on \u201cagencies, centres and organizations\u201d, the European Medicines Agency (EMA, n = 15) ranked top, followed by the ECDC (n = 13) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, n = 9). Among \u201cnetworks, policy platforms and collaborations\u201d, the European presidencies (n = 13) were selected most often by the respondents, followed by the collaboration of the European Commission (EC), the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO-EUR) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (n = 8). Moreover, the three entries on the third rank include the EU Health Policy Forum (n = 6), the network on epidemiological surveillance and control of infectious diseases (n = 6), and the network on Health Technology Assessment (n = 6). The fifth category was not topic specific therefore, work on European level health determinants (n = 10), the exchange of best practices (n = 8), and published scientific reports which influenced EU policy-making (n = 7) were ranked on the first three positions.\n\nAt a glance, the label \u201cachievement\u201d was allocated to the public health mandate as it is laid down in the Treaties, the establishment of EU-level agencies dealing with public health topics and successes in smoking prohibition, food safety and infectious disease control. The label \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d was allocated to the insufficient degree to which the HiAP approach is implemented and the ways in which health promotional aspects of alcohol and nutrition were handled. The label \u201cfailure\u201d was less often assigned with the missing integration or link to social policies appearing in some interviews under this heading as well as the strength of the internal market which annulled national protective alcohol legislations in some member states. In Table \n4, we provide the full list of EU-level outputs or actions which, based on the content analysis and the identified thematic categories, were mentioned as achievements, missed opportunities or failures by the key informants. Due to a broad and divergent spectrum of perceptions, topics almost always shared aspects of achievements, missed opportunities or failures. In the following section, we focus on those EU-level outputs or actions which were mentioned by the majority of respondents during the interviews and allowed us to draw a comprehensive picture on the breadth and the diversity of expert perceptions.\n\nAn assessment of the general value of EU-level public health actions over the last twenty years resulted in mainly ambivalent judgments. On the one hand, many relevant activities were performed at an EU-level and the existence of a health mandate contributed to an EU social model. On the other hand, its dependence on political will and economic circumstances influenced the development of EU-level public health policy and led to the perception that more should or could have been achieved within and beyond the possibilities of the current health mandate.\n\nThe establishment of the Directorate General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) in 1999 as an independent, formal structure for EU health policy was generally discussed as an achievement. The formation of DG SANCO, and thus, the political decision to separate the health dossier from DG V, the former DG with the responsibility for health policy as well as a focus on employment and social policies, was controversially perceived. The establishment of DG SANCO led, on the one hand, to a more mature health policy field.\n\n\u201c\u2026the DG V was a big DG and then DG SANCO became separate from that. Health had its own commissioner, its own opportunity to protect itself and public health benefits.\u201d (#15, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nOn the other hand, aspects of failure were mentioned regarding the detachment of health and social policy at EU-level. According to the respondents being separated led to a loss of collaboration for more holistic health policies and actions in health systems and healthcare at EU-level.a\n\nFollowing the formation of DG SANCO, it was seen as a beneficial way forward for the DG to shift its sectorial policy approach from a focus on specific topics such as cancer, drug dependence, health monitoring, accidents and injuries, or pollution-related diseases, to a horizontal one with the formulation of the first health strategy with three cross-cutting objectives: health information, health threats and health determinants\n[46].\n\n\u201cAnd this was an important moment in time where the sectorial approach to AIDS, cancer and other issues has been reduced gradually and that more the integral horizontal approach, which was applied at that time already in all member states \u2013 hence Europe was running behind in that sense, but ultimately was embraced and taken as guideline for the framing of all sorts of public health actions. \u201c(#02, EU/national civil servant)\n\nSince it fostered more visibility of the public health field and closer cooperation by financing projects, joint actions and research across Europe, the Public Health Programme of DG SANCO was commonly discussed as being supportive to the development of European public health and the mobilization of the public health community.\n\nAspects of missed opportunity became relevant when assessing the representation of health in other EU policies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly the reason is, but they [DG SANCO] are not strong enough to push for health in [the other] DGs. The obvious example is the latest EU 2020 strategy, you cannot find reference to health anywhere it\u2019s really a disaster, because of [the] weak DG SANCO. Health is not among the headline targets, it\u2019s not among the flagships.\u201d (#15, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nWhile the cooperation with other DGs was recurrently discussed as problematic, the potential for the \u201cPartnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\u201d under the European Innovation Union appeared as a unique theme and was regarded as an achievement for strengthening health policy on the general EU policy agenda.\n\n\u201c\u2026it is now coordinated under the Innovation Union [of Europe2020], and so Commissioner Neelie Kroes [DG Connect and Vice-Commissioner] is as much in the lead as Commissioner John Dalli [DG SANCO]. And that\u2019s a good sign, if we can get more of those sorts of partnerships on specific policies, then I think, we\u2019ll get a better understanding.\u201d(#04, EU/national politician)\n\nWith regard to assessing the status of DG SANCO cooperation with other international policy actors, respondents had mixed perceptions. Whereas some argued that DG SANCO\u2019s collaboration with international organizations like the WHO-EUR or the OECD is improving and therefore, can be considered as an achievement, others asserted that this collaboration was not sufficiently established and can therefore be categorized as a missed opportunity.\n\nThe establishment and the work of EU public health agencies like the EMA, the ECDC, the EFSA, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) were regarded as an achievement and as an important step forward towards the strengthening of the European dimension in health. The work and the scope of the agency mandates was a recurring topic and subject to diverging perceptions. As an example, in the case of the ECDC, its development was assessed as an achievement whilst its scope was considered a missed opportunity.\n\nThe bioterrorism attacks on the United States of America in 2001 and the SARS crisis led to calls for better international coordination of infectious disease surveillance and the establishment of ECDC in 2004\n[47]. Hence, the setting up of ECDC was commonly perceived as an achievement, since it gave preceding EU actions in infectious disease control a formal structure and maintained actions in the field. Also, the close collaboration with the respective national public health agencies during outbreaks and in negotiating and developing common guidelines for infectious disease control were regarded as an important task of the ECDC.\n\nHowever, a number of respondents were critical of the scope of the ECDC mandate and thus, looked at this as a missed opportunity. Questions were raised on whether the ECDC\u2019s responsibility in surveillance, risk assessment and training are sufficient or if additional responsibilities in risk communication and management were needed to assure full stewardship during and in the prevention of health crises.\n\n\u201cI suppose the flu epidemic [\u2026]. That should be put on the table not only as a missed opportunity, big failure, having put ECDC at the center of the development, but the ECDC is not authorized to risk communicational management as you know. So, in that sense, it is a failure that member states were not able to coordinate in this very important public health area and use the EU institution, either ECDC or WHO to do that.\u201d (#03, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nMoreover, interview participants reported tensions between member states and EU agencies regarding the transfer of responsibilities from national to EU-level.\n\n\u201cAnd the member states are very reluctant to hand over power regarding public health to the Commission, or to Brussels. Now if you focus on infectious diseases, that is much better because they understand that there is a need, but again it is not easy.\u201d (#30, EU/national civil servant)\n\nSince the largest burden of disease in the EU is caused by non-infectious rather than infectious diseases, a call was put forward to further increase the mandate of ECDC to all public health relevant aspects and not focus only on infectious diseases.\n\nThe HiAP approach was generally assessed as an achievement regarding its potential to address health determinants outside the health sector.\n\n\u201c[the article on the health mandate] is very important, because thereby a mandate is created that the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Affairs [\u2026] approaches his colleagues whenever they make new legislation to ensure that the health protection dimension is guaranteed; it gives partly a mandate to break into the policy and law development in sectors which in principle do not have any links with public health. [\u2026] this is very difficult. But its potential is very strong.\u201d (#2, EU/national civil servant)\n\nHowever, in regard to its degree of implementation participants commonly perceived HiAP as a missed opportunity. Health Impact Assessment, the implementing tool to HiAP, was regarded as a \u201ctick box exercise\u201d (#03, #15, both public health advisor/advocate) rather than a thorough consideration of health in other policies areas. Explanations given during the interviews demonstrated that conditions to achieve HiAP seemed not to be established yet and that there seems to be difficulty in bringing DG SANCO interests in line with the interests of other DGs without over-emphasizing the health aspect. Political assertiveness in convincing other Commissioners and DGs about the relevance for intersectoral cooperation was perceived to be lacking, even though an Inter-service group on Public Health with the participation of more than twenty EC departments was established for this purpose.\n\nGenerally, the work regarding tobacco was regarded as an achievement of how European health policy-making effectively addressed a life style risk factor for health.\n\n\u201cThe progress around tobacco [Directive on tobacco advertising, Directive on tobacco products, transparency register], the fact that we have a piece of international law on tobacco [WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control] is massive and that was European led.\u201d (#05, public health advisor/advocate).\n\nThis quote echoed the perception of the majority of respondents who emphasized the leading role of the EU regarding the support and commitment to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Moreover, it was argued that the achievements regarding the regulation of tobacco advertising and smoking prohibition in public places would not have been achieved by single member states independently and thus this was a common achievement initiated and supported by European cooperation. Nevertheless, aspects of a missed opportunity or even failure were mentioned in this regard since some would have appreciated stronger legislative measures to achieve a more harmonized realization of smoke-free legislation across the EU.\n\nIt was considered that the achievements recognized in EU tobacco legislation were missed in the regulation of other health-related life style factors such as nutrition and alcohol. Whilst regulations in the area of food safety were generally acknowledged as an achievement by preventing food-borne health threats; a potential mandate to address the composition of food and thereby, prevent, inter alia obesity or non-communicable diseases seemed to be neglected and was labeled as a missed opportunity.\n\n\u201c\u2026food safety has been majorly put forward over the last twenty years, in the sense that we know that the food will not be contaminated. But then it is a missed opportunity in the sense that beyond food safety there is health promotion and then one wanted the Union to have more powers to regulate issues on the content of saturated fat for instance or the percentages of sugar and so on.\u201d (#03, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nWith regard to governmental activity on these issues, the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was named as an example of an achievement as well as a failure.\n\n\u201cI think the diet platform [\u2026] can be seen as a failure and opportunity. [\u2026] If we had not created that platform then arguably the issue wouldn\u2019t have been tackled at all. And in a way that has been really brought some issues of complexity to the political discussion around issues around marketing of food, around self-regulation, reformulation, some of the initiative like salt in diet has come as a commitment from that platform.\u201d(#05, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nThe failure aspect of the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was related to the perception that a platform is a rather weak policy instrument and that more political will to tackle these issues with stronger EU policy or legal instruments would have had more impact.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of timely cooperation of public health professionals with other sectors such as agriculture was raised as missed opportunity. It was illustrated that agriculture policy has public health relevant links regarding affordability, accessibility, and the availability of food. However, it was also argued that this cooperation has been developed further over the recent years.\n\n\u201cAnd it is correct, that the Common Agriculture Policy has not been taken up health in the beginning, but by now they are doing this very consciously. [\u2026] Thus, I really see an improvement; I actually do not see a situation anymore in which health was influenced really negatively [by the Common Agriculture Policy].\u201d (#26, EU/national civil servant)\n\nInternal market provisions were perceived as ambivalent by the respondents. The EU is based on internal market rules that also affect EU health policy.\n\n\u201cThe engine of European health policies is still the market.\u201d(#23, academia)\n\nHowever, the influence of EU market regulations, for example on alcohol policies, was perceived as a failure when member states had more protective and stricter national legislation as was the case in the Nordic countries. Respondents claimed that EU internal market regulations that are more attentive to health issues would be appreciated in this case. Moreover, the potential given by Articles 36 and 114 of the TFEU, which put limitations on the Single Market, was mentioned and it was perceived as a missed opportunity that this potential had not been fully taken up by public health experts:\n\n\u201c[\u2026] the public health aspect, which is written into Article 95 [now Article 114, TFEU] on the internal market, you can put limits on the internal market on the grounds of public safety, public morality and public health, is almost never used. What if DG Internal Market was turned into our greatest weapon?\u201d (#32, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nThis was positively exemplified by the case of tobacco control which applied internal market rules for public health purposes to assure harmonized labeling, packaging, nicotine content, etc. across the EU. However, the application of the health argument to put limitations on the internal market rules was also perceived as being negatively connoted by non-public health experts:\n\n\u201cIf you just go to the DG Internal Market and grab the first person you see and ask them what public health means, they will tell you it\u2019s the exception member states use to defend local weird monopolies on peculiar alcohol, or something like that. It\u2019s an exception to a rule.\u201d (#19, academia)\n\nThe recent EU patients\u2019 rights Directive in cross-border healthcare\n[39] was mainly regarded as an important achievement. This assessment was not necessarily driven by satisfaction with the scope of the Directive but, instead, because it is the first EU secondary legislation ever enacted specifically on healthcare.\n\n\u201c[\u2026] the cross-border Directive will turn out to be incredibly important. Particularly because it is so symbolic important if you like because it does represent really the first time that the EU has got any concrete in relation to healthcare as opposed to public health. The consequences of this remains to be seen.\u201d (#29, EU/national civil servant)\n\n\u201cTherefore, I see the patients\u2019 Directive as a true success from a legislative perspective\u201d (#23, academia)\n\nThe achievement aspect was supported by perceptions that the Directive will lead to more cross-border cooperation and will have an impact on quality of care as well as on priority setting in healthcare and the packaging of healthcare services. Thereby, it was expected that the Directive will not only influence people who seek healthcare services in other countries but also those who seek services in their home country. In this regard, some expected that the Directive would also ultimately empower patients as consumers of healthcare services.\n\n\u201cThe cross-border Directive [\u2026] will have consequences of more consumer empowerment, consumer rights, patient rights, more consumer participation and more literacy,\u2026\u201d(#03, public health advisor/advocate)\n\nHowever, there were also critical voices that interpreted the Directive, as targeting a limited segment of the European population and hence, potentially increasing health inequalities. These respondents also questioned the willingness of the general population to seek healthcare treatment outside their home country. Furthermore, respondents were critical of the extent to which more EU involvement in healthcare of member states would lead to quality assurance in general:\n\n\u201cIt is positive in the way people can be treated where they want, but it is still my point of view that we [\u2026] want to have our own level of quality and we don\u2019t want others to decide what level it should be. Perhaps, because we have a very high quality [\u2026]. But of course we don\u2019t mind to tell others about it, we don\u2019t mind others to come in, we don\u2019t mind to help others to get the same standard - that is cooperation, so I always say I love cooperation but I do mind the harmonization.\u201d. (#18, EU/national politician)\n\nInterestingly, the study indicated that the Treaty-based tasks such as support of cooperation between member states, development of guidelines and indicators, best practice exchange, and periodic monitoring and evaluation on EU-level public health to ensure \u2018a high level of human health protection\u2019[1] were only partially perceived as fulfilled or acknowledged by the interviewed experts. Thematic discussions on actions or policies related to the development of guidelines and indicators appeared with regard to infectious disease surveillance and management of rare diseases but were not a major theme across interviews. The EU-level task to promote best practice exchange among member states was regarded as influential, which is represented by a top position in one of the rankings presented in this paper. With regard to the task of establishing monitoring and evaluation structures, some respondents perceived the status of the EU health information system rather as a failure. This corresponds to observations in the literature indicating that although ground work such as the development of a common EU health indicator set is acknowledged\n[50,51] further efforts are needed to implement and maintain health indicators\n[51] and to develop a permanent and sustainable EU public health monitoring and reporting infrastructure that supports decision making in public health on EU level\n[50,51]. Respondents agreed that cooperation in the area of public health between member state representatives and experts as well as with other stakeholder groups has increased and has been facilitated by the EU through various projects, networks, forums, and platforms. This trend was mainly positively perceived since it supported EU-level public health policy by accumulating and exchanging knowledge, generating public support and a legitimacy to act on certain fields\n[3]. This finding is corroborated by the literature on the potential of new governance instruments for health- and social policy-making at EU-level\n[11,52-54]. However, these new governance instruments can also be regarded as a rather strategic investment of the EC to keep topics on the agenda until a political window of opportunity opens but as an ineffective policy tool to enforce and implement action in due course\n[6]. The collaboration of a diverse set of stakeholders as it is the case for example in the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health can lead to actions that constitute rather a compromise of various interests. Consequently, the results might be disappointing from the viewpoint of public health experts\n[6,55]. A final judgment on the impact of facilitating collaboration is to be awaited and may only be made in the long term future. It will require different ways of measuring \u2018impact\u2019 compared to the analysis of domestic adaptations when implementing EU hard law\n[56].\n\nThe assessments of EC tasks for public health policy making have been influenced by characteristics like the subsidiarity principle throughout several interviews. On the one hand some participants were in favor of more EU influence on health policies and their implementation. In their view integration and harmonization of health policy did not reach far enough and hence their perception of actions was dominated by the category \u2018missed opportunity\u2019. On the other hand some experts were in favor of keeping certain health issues like health care as national responsibility which led to a perception of too much EU involvement and a negative perception of the evolvement of the health mandate.\n\nPublic health has a cross-cutting nature and cooperation across DG\u2019s often poses difficulties. Therefore, convincing evidence is required to demonstrate the health impact of policies outside the health domain and strong partnerships are needed to counter strong industrial lobbying groups\n[6,57,58]. The ease of cooperation and the potential to achieve policy coherence between DG SANCO and DGs with stronger regulatory competences like the internal market (e.g. regarding tobacco, pharmaceuticals) or agriculture policy (regarding food safety, subsidies of unhealthy versus healthy food products) represented another characteristic that influenced the individual perception of EU public health policies. Experts who assessed the value of EU health policy actions under the reality of a rather weak health mandate were more likely to perceive EU actions as achievements. This was in contrast to others who strove for more appreciation of social and health matters in EU policies and who perceived a lot of missed opportunities or failures in this regard as the power of the EU was too weak to realize change and to fulfill the objective of the health mandate to ensure human health protection for citizens in the EU.\n\nIn summary, underlying themes such as cooperation among European public health professionals, increasing institutionalization, and characteristics such as the issue of subsidiarity or the possibilities to cooperate across EU policy domains influenced experts\u2019 perceptions throughout the topics presented in this paper. These conditions and characteristics are part of what Lamping called the \u201cchaordic dynamics\u201d of European integration in the field of health policies\n[3]. As our study demonstrated EU health policy does not demonstrate a clear-cut success since the logic of action in the field can involve diverging interests. Nevertheless, the EU public health has quite systematically developed in terms of scope and impact beyond the original mandate.\n\nThe ranking of influential policy outputs provided indications on important developments in EU public health policy. However, even though we categorized the outputs, they sometimes differed in character and power which might have led to imbalanced judgments.\n\nAdditionally, we received different reasons for labeling EU-level actions or policies as achievements, missed opportunities or failure for public health. Some were identified because they increased the strength or value of EU-level public health policy, whereas, others were identified because they impacted the health of the European population.\n\nThe findings of the study may not be empirically generalizable since they were closely linked to qualitative individual perceptions and the settings that participants belonged to. However, we are confident that the broad range of profiles of the experts has ensured the diversity of perceptions on the topics varying from achievement to missed opportunity and failure. Moreover, given that participants were generally active in health policy at EU-level and mainly positive about the EU, this could also have influenced the obtained results to some extent.\n\nEU public health policy is subject to divergent perceptions of how successful or unsuccessful specific topics have been tackled and how far European integration in public health policy should go. From the findings, it is unequivocal that the EU has strengthened its role over the past twenty years in supporting, coordinating, and supplementing member states\u2019 actions on public health issues as laid down in Article 168 (2), TFEU. The EU is now a recognized player in public health in Europe. However, when it comes \u201cto the promotion of a high level of [\u2026] protection of human health [\u2026]in defining and implementing its policies and activities\u201d (Article 9, TFEU), further work is needed to achieve the full potential of the EU health mandate.\n\naAlso several EU member states disconnected on national level the Ministry of Health from Social Affairs. At the time of writing only seven out of 28 EU member states organized health and social affairs within one ministry (Spain, France, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Greece, the Netherlands).\n\nASPHER: Association of Schools for Public Health in the European Region; BSE: Boviene spongiforme encefalopathie; DG: Directorate General; DG Connect: Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology; DG SANCO: Directorate General for Health and Consumers; EC: European Commission; ECDC: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; EFSA: European Food Safety Authority; EMA: European Medicines Agency; EMCDDA: European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction; EU: European Union; GATS: General Agreement on Trade in Services; HEIDI: Health in Europe: Information and Data Interface; HIA: Health Impact Assessment; HiAP: Health in All Policies; HTA: Health Technology Assessment; OECD: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SDoH: Social Determinants of Health; TFEU: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; WHO-EUR: World Health Organization- Regional Office for Europe.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nAll authors were involved in setting up the study.
