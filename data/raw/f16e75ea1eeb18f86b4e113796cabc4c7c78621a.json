{"title": "", "body": "The multi-pathogen microarray contains approximately 2.56 million 25-mer DNA probes, synthesized in situ by photolithography (Fodor et al., 1991; Fodor et al., 1993; Pease et al., 1994) . The microarray was designed to detect a large number of viral and bacterial pathogens, as well as key pathogenic determinants, such as antibiotic resistance genes and genes implicated in toxin production and virulence. The pathogen microarray can identify the majority of the bacteria and viruses on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) priority pathogen list, as well as many other major human pathogens, by means of hybridization-based DNA resequencing technology within the context of the overall assay depicted in Fig. S1 .1. Table S1 .1 lists the types of genetic elements tiled on the array, and Table S1 .2 provides a list of the species tiled on the pathogen microarray. Some unusual species, such as Deinococcus radiodurans, were included for array testing purposes.\n\nBriefly, the array contains sequences from conserved genes capable of accurately identifying 42 viruses and over 50 bacterial species, as well as detecting 390 antibiotic resistance and 229 pathogenicity and virulence genes. The assay uses a resequencing-byhybridization technology (described in Chee et al., 1996; Hacia et al., 1999; Cutler et al., 2001; Warrington et al., 2002; Wong et al., 2004; Davignon et al., 2005; Zwick et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2006) , which enables detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a test sample compared to the reference sequence synthesized on the array. Sequence differences are used, for example, to identify viral or bacterial genotypes or to identify bacterial mutations conferring resistance to quinolones or rifampicin.\n\nEach gene incorporates some level of sequence variation that is known to varying degree by its representation in the database. The design accounts for the variation in sequence where it is known through one of five mechanisms: the resequencing property of the chip, overlapping sequences, conserved regions, and diverged regions, and redundancy. The resequencing property mentioned in the previous paragraph naturally detects well-spaced SNPs, so smaller variations in sequence will automatically be characterized. In regions where variation exceeds the chip's resequencing ablity or when the sequence is especially important, we include overlapping sequences representing the sequence variation. For genes in which only a select portion is included, the conserved region is selected when characterizing the variation is not useful. When knowing the variation is important as in the case of strain identification, more divergent regions may be selected. Finally, the chip may not be able to characterize all of the sequence because of low input levels of target or unknown sequence variation, so the design has a significant level of redundancy. For example, even if a large fraction of the bases for a 16S genes do not produce base calls, BLAST may still permit unambiguous identification based on available sequence.\n\nBacterial species identification is achieved through the resequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, rrs, and additional house-keeping genes including gyrB and rpoB. Specific genes involved in virulence and antibiotic resistance have been included in the microarray design. In addition, the array can detect the presence of point mutations in selected housekeeping genes, such as topoisomerase II (gyrA and gyrB), topoisomerase IV (parC and parE), and the \u03b2subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB), which confer antibiotic resistance. The identification of viral pathogens is based on the resequencing of the RNA polymerase gene, which is conserved in all RNA and DNA viruses. Mammalian 18S rDNA sequences from human, chicken, mouse, and rat have also been tiled on the microarray to identify sources of DNA contributed by other species. A portion of the human mitochondrial genome sequence is present to further identify human host DNA.\n\nThe extracted and purified nucleic acids were split into two parts; genomic DNA in the first was randomly amplified with bacteriophage \u03a629 DNA polymerase and random hexamers, using the REPLI-g WGA kit (Qiagen), while the RNA in the second was reversetranscribed and amplified using a method described by D. Wang et al., 2003, which was adapted for resequencing microarray technology for this study. The two products were quantitated and mixed as required. The target mixture was fragmented (GeneChip\u00ae Resequencing Assay Kit, Affymetrix Inc.) and labeled according to the GeneChip\u00ae Mapping 100K Assay Manual (Affymetrix Inc.). Microarray hybridization was conducted at 45\u00b0C and array processing was carried out according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix Inc.). Institute, Hamburg, Germany). Melting peak analysis allowed the specific detection of the four different orthopox genotypes.\n\nUsing specific primers, a fragment of the hemagglutinin gene was amplified by realtime PCR, and the presence of SNPs that distinguish particular orthopoxviruses were inferred from the melting curve peaks ( Figure S1 .2). Using known quantities of plasmid DNA to generate standard curves, the viral load in the scab was determined to be 4.32\u00d710 4 genome copies per \u00b5l. From this result, it was estimated that only 0.025% of the total DNA extracted from the clinical sample was of viral origin.\n\nRespiratory tract washes (RTW) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from healthy subjects were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in order to concentrate the cells present, then, after elimination of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of lysis buffer (Invitrogen). Lysis was carried out by incubation with lysozyme (20 \u00b5l at 10 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C then treated with proteinase K (20 \u00b5l at 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) for 30 min at 60\u00b0C. The lysates from the two samples were purified on a QiAmp column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified DNA was then amplified using a WGA repli-g kit (Qiagen) following the same procedure used for genomic DNA from pathogenic bacteria. The \"Respiratory syndrome\" mixture was composed of 5 \u00b5g of DNA for the three pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis), 500 ng each of DNA for the SARS and influenza B viruses, and 10 \u00b5g of DNA from nasal washes. The \"Encephalitis syndrome\" mixture comprised 5 \u00b5g of DNA from Neisseria meningitidis, 500 ng each of DNA from the rabies (Challenge Virus Strain) and vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV Indiana), and 10 \u00b5g of CSF DNA. The \"Septicemia Syndrome\" mix comprised 5 \u00b5g of S. aureus DNA, 500 ng each for the dengue type II virus and the Rift Valley Fever virus, and 10 \u00b5g of human genome Hela cell DNA. The target preparation of these mixtures for hybridization was done as described in the \"Target Preparation and Hybridization to Microarray\" section above.\n\nAfter scanning, GeneChip\u00ae Operating Software (GCOS) (Affymetrix Inc.) transforms the raw image (.DAT) file to a simplified file format (.CEL), which assigns intensities to each of the corresponding probe positions. Then, GeneChip\u00ae Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ) (Affymetrix Inc.) uses the intensities to call the bases for the tiled genetic fragments and outputs the resulting sequences in a FASTA formatted file.\n\nThe bases are called using a derivative of the ABACUS algorithm (Cutler et al., 2001) contained in the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ). A maximum likelihood model of the probe intensities yields a base call of A, C, G, T, or N, where N indicates that the base could not be called. The call rate is the number of bases called (non-N bases) divided by the total number of bases. The accuracy of the base calls is principally controlled by the Quality Score Threshold (QST) parameter of GSEQ, which represents the minimum difference in the log likelihoods of the most likely model and the first runner up; if the QST cannot be met, the base call is N. QST controls the tradeoff between call rate and accuracy. GSEQ has a default value of 12 for QST, but this value was reduced to 8. This reduction of QST increases the call rate and provides more sequence for input into the BLAST analysis helping with identification. The reduction of QST may also decrease accuracy of the calls, but the BLAST analysis helps to manage the loss in accuracy.\n\nFor each genetic element, the call rate, matching score, and pairwise BLAST results are determined. The call rate is the number of non-N bases divided by the number of bases in the element expressed as a percent. The matching score is the number of bases that match the complement of the reference base divided by the number of bases in the element also expressed as a percent. The pairwise BLAST results compare the called sequence of the target to the complement of the reference sequence. The level of confidence in the identification of a genetic element is a combination of the confidence in the associated base calls and how close other possibilities come to the identification. A global BLAST analysis against the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence database serves to identify the genetic element, if possible.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the top scoring results of the global BLAST, we identify the genetic element as follows:\n\n\u2022 Top scoring result uniquely matches the reference \u2500 identify the element as the reference.\n\n\u2022 Top scoring result uniquely matches another species or genetic element \u2500 identify the element as the new match.\n\n\u2022 Top scoring results are not unique for species \u2500 possibly identify the genus.\n\n\u2022 If the top scoring BLAST results are inconsistent or have low scores \u2500 there is no identification.\n\nFor bacteria, the rrs and conserved genes combine to the level of their consistency (depending on the species) to identify the species; the toxin and antibiotic resistance genes determine their respective profiles. For viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes determine viral identity.\n\nTo establish whether the pathogen microarray could accurately identify given pathogens, either alone or in combination, a series of experiments was conducted to validate its capabilities. These employed probes generated either by whole genome amplification (WGA) or by PCR, and various hybridization protocols to be described below.\n\nA list of the pathogens tested may be found in Table S1 .3 where the housekeeping, antibiotic resistance and virulence genes used for identification and phenotypic prediction are also noted. With the exception of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has the highest GC content of the bacteria tested, all organisms were identified unambiguously under standard hybridization conditions. To illustrate the identification algorithm, WGA probes from a multiresistant S. aureus strain or from Y. pestis were hybridized to the pathogen microarray and the resultant sequences analyzed. The rrs sequence obtained was sufficient to identify S. aureus to the species level, with identification being confirmed by the rpoB and gyrB sequences, whose lack of relevant SNPs indicate the sample has no resistance to rifampicin and quinolone. The 12 antibiotic resistance genes present in this strain have a minimum call rate of 93.79% for ermA and the maximum of 99.44% for vatB (Table S1 .4). The microarray discriminates between the closely related vgaA and vgaC genes without ambiguity (even though they have 82.9% similarity at the nucleotide level).\n\nY. pestis could not be identified from the rrs sequence alone, as Y. pseudotuberculosis has an identical rrs sequence. However, the detection of the pla gene, which is specific for Y. pestis pathovars, allows Y. pestis to be identified with high confidence. The call rate and BLAST score for pla are 98.90% and 534.41, respectively. Other genes involved in Y. pestis pathogenicity were also detected with high confidence having a minimum call rate of 95.38% (Table S1 .4).\n\nDNA titration curves for multiresistant S. aureus and VSV were generated in order to analyse the behavior of the target genes at different concentrations. Genes such as tetM and rrs have a robust call rate which is relatively insensitive to the quantity of DNA hybridized.\n\nFor the other genes, the call rate increases proportionally but then saturates at 0.5 \u00b5g of DNA and above. Global BLAST analysis of the sequences obtained from the array confirms the gene identification except where the call rate is <40%, which occurs when low quantities of DNA (0.05 \u00b5g) are hybridized (Fig. S1.3) . S. aureus and its genetic elements can be successfully identified when of the amount of DNA ranges from 0.1 \u00b5g to 10 \u00b5g. At extremely low concentrations, the results are more gene-dependent. The presence of a fixed quantity of human DNA (10 \u00b5g) had no significant effect on the call rate or on the BLAST score for the various S. aureus genes except when very low quantities of DNA were used (0.05 \u00b5g, data not shown). The titration curves for the VSV polymerase gene are similar except that the threshold is 0.5 \u00b5g, above which the call rate does not vary; in addition, the presence of 10 \u00b5g of S. aureus DNA does not affect the identification of VSV (Fig. S1.4) .\n\nThe hybridization time curves (Fig. S1 .5) for a fixed quantity of DNA vary from 15 min to 18 hours and allow the behavior of each bacterium or virus to be compared across a number of different genes. The call rate for rrs is consistently high, i.e. >95 %, regardless of the hybridization time used. As before, the sequence identification was confirmed by BLAST \n\nThe sensitivity of our identification protocol is determined by the smallest number of input genome copies that we can detect with the microarray. Figure S1 .6 shows the call rates and accuracies for a set of S. aureus genes during a mass titration. The masses are converted to an equivalent genome copy number. The S. aureus was ATCC 700699D-5 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (Mu 50), which has a known sequence, so we could determine the accuracy. The S. aureus genomes are mixed with sufficient human DNA so that a total of 10ng of total DNA is amplified. Although the detection limit varies for different genes, S. aureus can be detected on a background of human DNA with as little as ~3000 genome copies. Figure S1 .7 shows the call rates and accuracies for a set of S. aureus genes during a similar mass titration. In this case, the indicated number of S. aureus genome copies were amplified alone without human DNA. The ability to detect some genes extends down to the single genome copy level, but the results are somewhat stochastic at the lowest masses due to uncertainty in whether a given gene actually is amplified. The microarray requires an approximately picomolar concentration of S. aureus DNA in the hybridization mixture to attain detection using existing analytical methods.\n\nIn order to explore ways to reduce the processing time, we tested the effect of hybridization time on samples containing 10 \u03bcg of S. aureus. We found that hybridization times as short as 15 minutes can provide sufficient signal to identify the genus and species of this organism, and hybridization times of as little as 1 hour can unambiguously identify the antibiotic resistance spectrum (Fig. S1.8) . Organisms with higher G + C content, such as Vibrio vulnificus, require longer hybridization times, due to higher background, but this effect can be improved partially by increasing the amount of target hybridized to the array (data not shown).\n\nOne of the objectives of this work was to determine whether the pathogen microarray could detect one or more pathogens in the presence of human DNA in a mock clinical sample.\n\nMultiple pathogens are important because it is rare to find a clinical specimen where only the agent responsible for the infection is present. A complex mixture containing VSV, Dengue Type 2 virus, a multiresistant strain of S. aureus, and human genomic DNA, was analysed in order to test the discriminatory power of the microarray. The ability to detect these three pathogens and the S. aureus resistance genes had previously been tested individually (data not shown) as well as in the following mixtures: S. aureus and human genome (10 \u00b5g of each); VSV and Dengue Type 2 virus (4 \u00b5g of each); and S. aureus and VSV (10 ug and 4 ug, respectively). In each case, the call rate, matching score, and BLAST results did not differ significantly in the mixture from their individual test. In the mixture, S. aureus and VSV had call rates >95%. The call rate for Dengue virus was only 31.65% (Table S1 .5). The call rate for Dengue virus is low compared to the other pathogens; however, its call rate was also low when tested individually, and the called bases were sufficient for a global BLAST analysis to unambiguously identify the Dengue virus. The presence of human DNA had no influence on the results. The negative controls used (vanA for S. aureus, PV virus for VSV and Yellow Fever virus for Dengue) confirmed that there was no cross hybridization between closely related viruses or between antibiotic resistance genes. The pathogen microarray thus allowed several different pathogens and their genetic elements to be identified from a complex mixture in the presence of human DNA with a very high level of confidence.\n\nUnknown or unsuspected bacterial or viral pathogens may be detected by the pathogen microarray if the reference sequence for a sufficiently closely related species has been tiled.\n\nThe sequence obtained by cross hybridization and analyzed with a global BLAST analysis can confirm the identification of another pathogen or perhaps indicate that the sample pathogen shares a genus with the tiled sequence. Table S1 .6 shows a number of examples of species that were not tiled and the genetic element of another tiled species that was used to make correct identification. rrs, gyrB, rpoB, gyrA, parC, parE; 2: rrs, gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE; 3: rrs, gyrA, gyrB, rpoB; 4: rrs, gyrA, gyrB; 5: rrs, rpoB; 6: rrs, fliC, iroN, thrA, hilA, gyrA, gyrB, hisD, hemD, aroC, tolC, fljB; 7: rrs, gyrA, gyrB, parC; 8: rrs; 9 : rrs, gyrA, rpoB (6), cdt, invA, sigD, vipB, sopE2, vexABCDE, vipC, prgH, vipA, sseC, spiC, sopA, sopD2, sopB, msgA, mgtC, pagC, thrA, hilA, tolC, orgA, agfA,  accuracy (lower plot) of S. aureus genes for a mass titration, where the input genome count represents the amount of S. aureus DNA input into the WGA reaction.
