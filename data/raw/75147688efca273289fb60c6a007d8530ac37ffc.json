{"title": "Daily visibility and mortality: assessment of health benefits from improving visibility in Hong Kong", "body": "In Hong Kong both visibility and air pollution data were available. This allowed us to verify whether the effect estimates for mortality associated with visibility were comparable to those derived from air pollutant data. For the verification, we completed the following steps, excluding accidental deaths:\n\n1. We estimated the excess risk for daily mortality per 1 \u00b5gm -3 change in each pollutant using the same corresponding age-cause specific mortality core models developed for visibility data and denoted it by ER p .\n\n2. We regressed each concentration of pollutants against the visibility adjusted for temperature and humidity using multiple linear regression with all terms at lag 0-1 days (Vajanapoom et al., 2001) . We treated visibility as linear while temperature and humidity were each fitted with natural cubic regression splines with 3 df. The coefficient associated with visibility represented the change of concentration of pollutant per unit change in visibility on average and denoted it by \u03b3.\n\n3. We obtained the estimated excess risk for daily mortality per IQR km change in visibility by multiplying 100%\u00d7ER p \u00d7\u03b3\u00d7IQR and denoted the resulting excess risk by ER vp %. 4. We then compared ER vp % to ER% using the mean square errors defined as the mean of [ER% -ER vp %] 2 (Yaffee and McGee, 2000) .\n\nThe gradients in concentrations of the four pollutants per 1km change in visibility were PM 10 : -3.37, NO 2 : -1.96, O 3 : -2.07 and SO 2 : -1.00 (data not shown). Mean square errors for predicted estimates of visibility on the mortality outcomes, excluding accidental mortality, derived from each pollutant compared to that of direct visibility, ranged from 0.04 to 1.01.\n\nThe smallest mean square errors were found for PM 10 (0.04) followed by NO 2 (0.15), O 3 (0.84) and SO 2 (1.01) (data not shown). The ER% for daily mortality per IQR km decrease in visibility predicted from PM 10 were closest to those derived from visibility directly across all mortality outcomes (Appendices 1 and 2).\n\nTo examine the exposure-response relation between visibility and daily mortality we added a penalized cubic regression splines smoothing function for visibility at lag 0-1 to the core model using 2 degrees of freedom.\n\nThe log-risk for mortality decreased monotonically as a function of the visibility for lag 0-1, indicating a negative association between mortality and the visibility range. The levels of visibility at 5km, 15km and 25km corresponding to concentrations of PM 10 (95% CI) in \u00b5gm -3 were 84 (83 to 85), 50 (49 to 51), and 16 (15 to 18) and of NO 2 (95% CI) in \u00b5gm -3 were 78 (77 to 80), 59 (58 to 60), and 39 (37 to 41) [Appendix 3].\n\nAppendix 1. Estimated excess risks (ER%) for daily mortality and associated 95% confidence intervals per interquartile range decrease in visibility (6.5km) at lag 0-1 days with comparison between ER% derived from visibility data (Viz) and from concentrations of air pollutants data.\n\nAppendix 2. Estimated excess risks (ER%) for daily mortality and associated 95% confidence intervals per interquartile range decrease in visibility (6.5km) at lag 0-1 days with comparison between ER% derived from visibility data (Viz) and from concentrations of air pollutants data.\n\nAppendix 3. Estimated exposure-response relationships for visibility with trends 4 degrees of freedom (df), temperature (3 df) and humidity (3 df) and visibility (2 df) at lag 0-1 days.\n\nAppendix 4. Scatter plots of daily mean visibility in kilometer (km) against particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter \u2264 10\u03bcm (PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in microgram per cubic meter (\u03bcgm -3 ) in Hong Kong, 1996-2006.\n\nEstimated excess risks (ER%) for daily mortality and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) per interquartile range decrease in visibility (6.5km) at lag 0-1days for nonaccidental mortality at ages 65 years and over compared with sensitivity analyses.
