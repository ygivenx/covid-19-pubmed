{"title": "The ORF2 glycoprotein of hepatitis E virus inhibits cellular NF-\u03baB activity by blocking ubiquitination mediated proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in human hepatoma cells", "body": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is a crucial transcription factor regulating multiple cellular pathways leading to survival or death of the cell depending on the stimulus. In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers (p50/p65 heterodimer or p50/p50 homodimer) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B (I\u03baB). Upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 (IL-1), CD40L, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) etc., signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 exposes the p50/p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF-\u03baB dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to \u03baB motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription\n[1].\n\nIn many cases, infection by extra-cellular pathogens has been shown to alter NF-\u03baB activity in order to facilitate the survival of pathogens or host. As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens, NF-\u03baB activation is required for resistance to a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections\n[1]. However, many viruses such as HIV, exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through \u03baB response elements located in their promoters\n[2]. On the contrary, many pathogens such as African swine fever virus, HIV-1 and cowpox virus\n[3-5] have developed strategies to interfere with host NF-\u03baB responses. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity by these pathogens has been shown to be important for pathogenesis.\n\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known open reading frames (ORFs)\n[6]. ORF1 codes for non structural proteins, essential for viral replication; ORF2 codes for the major capsid protein of HEV, called ORF2 protein; and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein which may play a key role in manipulating various host-cell processes during viral infection, and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus\n[7,8]. Although HEV infection is generally self-limiting, it induces fulminant hepatic failure, which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB activity is suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of pregnant fulminant hepatic failure patients\n[9]. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown.\n\nIn the present study, we report the ability of the ORF2 protein to inhibit the cellular NF-\u03baB activity. In human hepatoma cells, ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP and heterologous expression of the ORF2 protein led to reduced recruitment of SKP1 and CUL1 subunits to the SCF\u03b2TRCP ubiquitination complex, resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein. This, in turn, led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent DNA binding of the p65 protein, which is the major subunit of the NF-\u03baB trans-activation complex. Analysis of two NF-\u03baB target genes further confirmed the above observation. The possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of HEV infected hepatocytes is discussed.\n\nIn order to test whether ORF2 or ORF3 protein of HEV inhibit cellular NF-\u03baB activity, a reporter vector with IL-2 receptor promoter region, which contains NF-\u03baB element, cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding sequence (NF-\u03baB CAT;\n[10] was used. This vector was inducible by NF-\u03baB activating agents like TPA or IL-1\u03b2. Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-\u03baB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids. Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF-\u03baB CAT activity (Figure\n1A). However, no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression (Figure\n1A). In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity was an artifact of the experimental system, cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), a known inducer of NF-\u03baB activity\n[11], or transfected with an expression construct of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2, which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF-\u03baB activity\n[12]. TPA treatment increased NF-\u03baB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF-\u03baB activity (Figure\n1A). Similarly, co-expression of ORF2 in IKK\u03b2 transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF-\u03baB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKK\u03b2 (Figure\n1B). These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF-\u03baB activity.\n\nFurther, we examined the turnover of I\u03baB\u03b1 in I\u039aK\u03b2 and ORF2 co-expressing cells since I\u03baB\u03b1 is the major inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activity in unstimulated cells. By performing a pulse chase assay, using 35S]-cys/met labeling mix, the half-life of I\u03baB\u03b1 in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes, whereas in cells expressing both IKK\u03b2 and ORF2, approximately 15% of I\u03baB\u03b1 was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes (Figure\n2A). Notably, the levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the end of the labeling period (0 minute chase) in IKK\u03b2 alone expressing cells were less than that in IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 coexpressing cells, indicating that I\u03baB\u03b1 is a very labile protein in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells. The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100%. To further confirm whether I\u03baB\u03b1 stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in ORF2 expressing cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody. As seen in Figure\n2B, ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction (Figure\n2B, lane 2 and 4; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below). As expected, mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction (Figure\n2B, lane 1 and 3). This is attributed to the fact that basal NF-\u03baB activity is higher in Huh7 cells\n[13]. In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls, equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin and anti-phospho c-Jun antibodies.\n\nIn order to check whether the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was altered in ORF2 expressing cells, the level of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 (ser32) was measured in ORF2 expressing cells. ORF2 expression marginally increased the levels of phospho I\u03baB\u03b1 (Figure\n2C, upper panel, lane 1 and 2; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below) as well as the level of total I\u03baB\u03b1 (middle panel, lane 1 and 2). In IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 co-expressing cells, the level of total as well as phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly higher as compared to only IKK\u03b2 expressing cells (Figure\n2C, lane 3 and 4). In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 hours, resulting in equal I\u03baB\u03b1 protein levels in both the samples (Figure\n2C, lane 5 and 6). Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to check equal loading. Thus, it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. The fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the IKK complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex. ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (ser180/181) levels. As expected, ORF2 expression (2 or 4 \u03bcg plasmid DNA transfection) did not modulate the levels of pIKK \u03b1/\u03b2 (Figure\n2D).\n\nProteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 is preceded by its ubiquitination, which occurs by the association of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 with the SCF\u03b2TRCP complex\n[14]. In order to check whether ORF2 inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination, we checked the level of ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1 in ORF2 expressing cells. Mock or ORF2 transfected cells were treated with MG-132 for 2 hours, I\u03baB\u03b1 was immunoprecipitated, followed by immunblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody. Protein level of ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly decreased in full-length ORF2 expressing cells as compared to control cells (Figure\n3A top panel, lane 1 and 2). A similar effect (lane 3) was observed following expression of a mutant ORF2 protein (\u039435) with ER signal sequence deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm\n[15]. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody to confirm its presence (Figure\n3A, middle panel). A parallel set of samples were labeled with 35S]-cys/met promix, immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full-length and \u039435 ORF2 protein (Figure\n3A, bottom panel).\n\nSubsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interfered with the assembly of I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination machinery. Expression of ORF2 protein inhibited the association of I\u03baB\u03b1 with SKP1 (Figure\n3B, top panel) and CUL1 (Figure\n3B, 2nd panel) in a dose-dependent manner (compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody to check the levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 (3rd panel). A parallel set of samples were labeled with [35S]-cys/met and immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody to check the expression of ORF2 (Figure\n3B, 4th panel). To further check whether the ORF2 expression in these cells inhibited the association of I\u03baB\u03b1 with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP, ORF2 and myc tagged \u03b2TRCP co-expressing cells were labeled with [35S]-cys/met and aliquots of the lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody and immunoblotted using anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody. ORF2 expression led to the inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 association with full-length \u03b2TRCP when compared to control cells (Figure\n3C, lane 3 and 2, respectively). However, I\u03baB\u03b1 association with an F-box deleted mutant \u03b2TRCP (\u0394F-\u03b2TRCP) remains unaffected despite the presence of ORF2 (Figure\n3C, lane 5). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody to check the expression of full-length and \u0394F-\u03b2TRCP (Figure\n3C, lower panel, lane 1\u20135). Lane 1 shows the protein level of total I\u03baB\u03b1. 50% of the sample has been loaded in lane 1 in comparison to other samples. The other half of the blot was autoradiographed to check the expression of the ORF2 protein (Figure\n3C, lower panel, lane 6\u20138).\n\nSince the presence of ORF2 could inhibit I\u03baB\u03b1 association with full-length \u03b2TRCP but not with \u0394F-\u03b2TRCP, we postulated that the ORF2 protein either interacts with I\u03baB\u03b1 and sequesters it away from \u03b2TRCP or interacts with other subunits of the SCF complex thereby modulating \u03b2TRCP binding to I\u03baB\u03b1. Alternatively, it binds to \u03b2TRCP itself and blocks the formation of the SCF complex. We thus checked the association of ORF2 with the above components. No interaction was detected between ORF2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 (Figure\n3C, lane 6) as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay. The possibility that \u03b2TRCP over-expression might be promoting ORF2 association with I\u03baB\u03b1 was ruled out by testing ORF2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 association in full-length or \u0394F- \u03b2TRCP over-expressing cells (Figure\n3D, lane 7 and 8). Lane 1 shows the level of I\u03baB\u03b1 in control cells. Subsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interacts with SKP1 and CUL1. The ORF2 protein did not associate with either SKP1 or CUL1 (Figure\n3D, lane 1 and 2) under conditions, where IKB\u03b1 associated with these proteins (lane 3).\n\nCoimmunoprecipitation assay of cell lysate expressing both ORF2 and myc tagged full-length \u03b2TRCP revealed that ORF2 could efficiently associate with the latter (Figure\n4A, upper panel, lane 2). Exposure of the same blot to X-ray film revealed the band specific to ORF2 in \u03b2TRCP and ORF2 cotransfected cells (Figure\n4A, lower panel, lane 2). 3rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the \u03b2TRCP protein, as judged by immunoprecipitation using anti-myc antibody. Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of ORF2 with another F-box protein, SKP2. We were unable to detect any interaction between ORF2 and SKP2 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay (Figure\n4B, top panel). In order to ensure that SKP2 was indeed functional in these experiments, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody. Endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein (Figure\n4B, middle panel) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein (Figure\n4B, lane 4, upper and middle panels). Bottom panel shows an autoradiogram of ORF2 expression. These experiments proved that ORF2 specifically interacts with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP. Direct interaction between ORF2 and \u03b2TRCP was further confirmed using an in vitro pull-down assay. Full-length ORF2 as well as KDEL ORF2 (ORF2 protein containing \u201cKDEL\u201d amino acids at its C-terminal end, which allows it to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of getting transported through the golgi) and \u039435 ORF2 mutant were able to pull-down \u03b2TRCP (Figure\n4C, lane 3, 4, 5). As negative controls, ORF2 transfected sample was immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum (Figure\n4C, lane 6) or mock translated lysate was incubated with ORF2 protein bound to beads (Figure\n4C, lane 2) or, the ORF3 protein was incubated with \u03b2TRCP protein (Figure\n4C, lane 7).\n\nNF-\u03baB is known to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes during different cellular conditions. One of the most critical events for initiation of immune response against viral antigens is the presentation of viral peptide epitopes over the infected cell surface, which can then be recognized by cytolytic T cells. The viral antigens are presented through their association with the major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). As MHC-I heavy chain is a known target of NF-\u03baB, we checked expression levels of the MHC-I heavy chain in ORF2 expressing cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysacharides (LPS). EGFP (Figure\n5A, lane 1), full-length ORF2 (Figure\n5A, lane 2) or \u039435-ORF2 (Figure\n5A, lane 3) transfected cells were treated with LPS for 45 minutes and total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-MHC-I heavy chain antibody (Figure\n5A, upper panel). Protein level of MHC-I heavy chain was decreased in both full-length and \u039435-ORF2 expressing cells in comparison to EGFP expressing cells. An aliquot of the lysate was immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to ensure equal loading of the sample (lower panel).\n\nFurther, we checked NF-\u03baB recruitment to the MHC I heavy chain promoter in LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of the NF-\u03baB complex. EGFP expression did not alter p65 recruitment to MHC-I heavy chain promoter. However, full-length or \u039435-ORF2 expression decreased p65 recruitment to the MHC-I heavy chain promoter. 10% of the total lysate used for one immuonprecipitation reaction was used as input in each sample (Figure\n5B, upper panel). We also checked p65 recruitment to interleukin 8 (IL-8) proximal promoter region, which showed a similar pattern as observed for the MHC-I heavy chain promoter (Figure\n5B, lower panel). As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for NF-\u03baB, aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 antibody (specific for SP1 transcription factor, which also binds to MHC-I heavy chain promoter) and purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC-I heavy chain promoter specific primer. As expected, SP1 recruitment to the MHC-I heavy chain promoter was not altered in ORF2 expressing cells (Figure\n5C). These experiments confirmed that ORF2 expression specifically prevents p65 NF-\u03baB association with its cognate response element present on natural promoters.\n\nNext, the effect of ORF2 protein on the expression of two TPA inducible cytokines- IL-6 and IL-8 was measured by performing real time quantitative RT-PCR of these cytokine transcripts in ORF2 expressing Huh7 cells, which were treated with TPA for 6 hours prior to RNA isolation. As expected, IL-6 and IL-8 transcript level was decreased in\n\nORF2 expressing TPA treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd TPA treated cells (Figure\n5D). These experiments indicates that ORF2 protein, by virtue of its ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity, suppress TPA induced IL-6 and IL-8 RNA synthesis.\n\nThe ORF2 protein of HEV has traditionally been believed to associate with genomic RNA, multimerize and form the viral capsid. No other function of ORF2 protein has yet been reported. In this article, we present evidence which suggest that the ORF2 protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle. The fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments. First, ORF2 was capable of directly interacting with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP, both in vitro and in vivo. Second, \u039435 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was also capable of inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity, thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact. Third, ORF3 protein of HEV was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments.\n\nHEV infection results in an acute, self-limiting and icteric disease that is prevalent in much of the developing world. Although self-limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate ~1\u20132%, a high 10\u201320% mortality rate is observed during pregnancy\n[6]. Hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which HEV completes its life cycle inside the host. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that NF-\u03baB activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients\n[9]. Our findings that the ORF2 protein has the ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity in human hepatoma cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation.\n\nThe NF-\u03baB inhibitory activity of the ORF2 protein may be mediated by its ability to directly associate with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP and inhibit the assembly of the I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination complex. \u03b2TRCP is a cytoplasmic protein. Hence it is worth speculating that the ORF2 \u03b2TRCP interaction would occur in the cytoplasm. Although ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro-translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm, where it is detected as a non-glycosylated protein. Importantly, in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates, retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm\n[16]. Thus, cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with \u03b2TRCP. Indeed, experiments done using \u039435 ORF2 protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with \u03b2TRCP and inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity. Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism.\n\nExpression of MHC class I heavy chain, which is known to be a transcriptional target of NF-\u03baB, was down-regulated in LPS treated ORF2 expressing cells presumably due to reduced promoter occupancy of p65, which is crucial for NF-\u03baB dependent transcriptional activation. In an infected cell, by default, pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the MHC class I molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells. This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection. Thus, it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step. In fact, downregulation of MHC class I both at transcriptional and post-translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections\n[17-19]. Since NF-\u03baB is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class I molecules in the infected cell, inhibition of the NF-\u03baB activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection.\n\nOwing to its central role in regulating multiple cell signaling pathways, modulation of NFKB activity has been an attractive target of many viral factors in order to allow them to exploit the host cell signaling machinery to their benefit. We have identified the ability of the ORF2 protein of the HEV to inhibit host cell NFKB activity. However, whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects, can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus. Nevertheless, the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event.\n\nCloning of ORF2 and \u039435 ORF2 in pSGI has been described earlier\n[15]. Flag tagged IKK\u03b2\n[12], IL-2 receptor \u03b1 promoter containing NF-\u03baB response element cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl ransferase (CAT) coding sequence (NF-\u03baB CAT)\n[10], Wild-type, \u0394F \u03b2TRCP cDNA in pCDNA3.1\n[20] and pSGI c-myc\n[21] constructs were gifts from Drs.

All DNA constructs used for mammalian cell transfection were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation\n[22].\n\nAll antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (California, USA); TPA and MG-132 were purchased from Calbiochem Chemicals (California, USA). LPS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). [35S]-cysteine/methionine labeling mix was obtained from New England Nuclear (Massachusetts, USA).\n\nHuman Hepatoma (Huh7) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum.
