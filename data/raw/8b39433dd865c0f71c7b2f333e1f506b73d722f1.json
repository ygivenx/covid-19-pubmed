AlC1 3 (21.0 g, 158 mmol) was added in one portion (light exotherm) followed by addition of ester 4a (14.0 g, 60.7 mmol) as a solution in anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (80 ml). The mixture was stirred for 15-20 min to give a clear solution. After being stirred at room temperature for 20 h, the reaction was concentrated and the resultant gummy residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate (500 ml) and cold 5 N HCl (500 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with more ethyl acetate, the combined organic solution was washed with 1 N HCl (300 ml), saturated NaCl (300 ml) and dried over MgS0 4 . Concentration of the solution gave a pale yellow solid; it was triturated with CH 2 C1 2 (200 ml), cooled to 0\u00b0C and then filtered off. Washing with CH 2 Cl 2 (2x50 ml) and drying in vacuo afforded 21.0 g of the desired benzophenone 5a as a white solid. The mother liquor afforded additional 2.1 g of the product. Total yield was 23.1 g (74% \n\nCompound 5b was synthesized by analogy with 5a starting from phthalic anhydride and 5,6,7,13,16-Hexachloro-12,15-dihydroxy-1-oxospiro[3-hydroisobenzofuran- \n\nA solution of 5b (4.8 g, 14 mmol) and resorcinol (6b) (2.3 g, 21 mmol) in 70 ml of TFA was prepared and cooled to 0 o C using ice/water bath. To this solution was slowly added 25 ml of methanesulfonic acid maintaining the temperature at 0-2 o C. The reaction was stirred at 0 o C for 15 h and poured onto 500 g of ice.\n\nPrecipitated material was collected by filtration, re-suspended in water (500 ml) and treated with triethylamine to pH of ~10. The resultant dark-brown solution was heated to boiling point and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. It was then acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to pH of ~2 and extracted with ethyl acetate (5x100 ml). \n\nTrifluoroacetic anhydride (125 ml) was added to a solution of acid 7c (25.0 g, 40 mmol) in 125 ml of trifluoroacetic acid. After being stirred for 10 min, the reaction was concentrated and co-evaporated with CH 2 Cl 2 (2x250 ml) to remove residual TFA. Hydroxyspiro[3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[3,2-b]xanthene-6,3'-3- The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight and treated with Nmethylimidazole (4.52 ml, 56.96 mmol) and trimethylacetic anhydride (11.56 ml, 56.96 mmol). After 20 h, methanol (10 ml) was added to quench excess anhydride. After another 3 h, reaction was concentrated, dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed with saturated NaHCO 3 , brine and dried over Na 2 SO 4 . Solid obtained after solvent evaporation was chromatographed on silica eluting with 1:1 ethyl acetate/hexane. "}
