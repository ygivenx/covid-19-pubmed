{"title": "Effect of acute respiratory infections in infancy on pulmonary function test at 3 years of age: a prospective birth cohort study", "body": "Chronic respiratory disease is a significant cause of morbidity in childhood and later life.1 Epidemiological studies reveal that many of such chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the adults may have their origin in the antenatal period and early childhood.2\u20135 It is a well-known fact that respiratory system continues to grow and develop in the postnatal period, especially during the first 3 years of life making this period exceptionally vulnerable to lung injury.6\u20139\n\nIn the last two decades, several innovative methods for the measurement of infant\u2019s pulmonary function have been developed and these are playing a vital role in the understanding of normal growth and development of lungs, as well as their longitudinal, follow-up from birth through childhood.8 9 Longitudinal studies have revealed that lung function at birth and in the first 4\u20136 years of age tracks the lung function throughout life.3 5 7\n\nAcute respiratory infections (ARIs) during infancy may affect the normal development of the respiratory system which in turn may have an impact on pulmonary function test.5 10\u201312 ARI during early life, especially with viral aetiology, can lead to development of asthma in childhood and COPD in adulthood.2 3 13 14 Although infection with any of the respiratory viruses during infancy may contribute to the development of asthma and COPD in childhood and adulthood, most of the studies have focused on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections.5 10 13 15\u201317\n\nElucidating the effect of ARI on developing pulmonary function in infancy and its tracking in childhood and beyond is an exciting research area. It offers the possibility of identification of infants, who after an ARI episode, maybe at an increased risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases; strategies could then be studied in these infants for the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidity.16 18 However, the majority of the available literature is on RSV and RV infection, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and mainly from the Caucasian and Oriental populations.4 10 13 14 16 19 There is a scarcity of data describing the association of all types of ARIs of any aetiology with the developing pulmonary functions measured by IPFT.\n\nWe hypothesised that ARI during the first year of life might lead to structural changes in the respiratory system, which in turn may be responsible for chronic respiratory morbidity in children. IPFT can objectively document the effect of these structural changes. For this, a prospective study was planned in which, a birth cohort was enrolled and followed up at 6 months\u2019 intervals till 3 years of age; at each visit, IPFTs were performed. The primary objective of this study was to document the effect of ARI during infancy on IPFT indices at 3 years of age.\n\nWe did not involve the participants in the formulation of study design, recruitment or conduction of the study. However, we assured them that the results would not reveal any participant identity.\n\nAll IPFT manoeuvres were performed in the Pediatric Pulmonary Function Lab, which is well equipped with a central supply of oxygen and resuscitation equipment. The equipment was calibrated daily for atmospheric temperature and pressure and volume with a 100 mL calibration syringe (M30.9011) provided by the manufacturer. Weight and length/height were recorded using standard methods.26 IPFT were postponed for 3\u20134 weeks if the child had an ARI.\n\nIPFT at enrolment and at 6 months of age were performed in either awake or natural sleep state after breast feeding. Beyond 6 months of age, syrup Triclofos (25\u201350 mg/kg/dose) was used for sedation whenever required. The manoeuvres were performed in the supine position. Baseline TBFVL was completed within 4 weeks of birth, while RTC and RVRTC were first performed once the child was \u22658 kg as per recommendations of the manufacturer of IPFT equipment. IPFTs were repeated at every follow-up visit. The IPFT indices and their physiological interpretation are described in table 1.\n\nParents were advised to visit the hospital whenever their child developed symptoms suggestive of ARI like fever, cold, cough, fast or difficulty in breathing, noisy breathing or chest retraction. Health status of enrolled children was also enquired telephonically at 2\u20134 weeks interval. If parents expressed difficulty in bringing the child to hospital, the study nurse visited their home and collected the required sample. LRTI was diagnosed during ARI in the presence of fast breathing for age as defined by WHO (respiratory rate:<2 months: \u226560/min; 2\u201312 months: \u226550/ min), and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in the absence of fast breathing for age.27 Wheezing during these ARI episodes were documented by a paediatrician during the hospital visit. They were treated symptomatically during these episodes, and an antibiotic (Amoxicillin) was only used in case of LRTI. Children were hospitalised if they had inadequate oral intake, not responding to supportive measures, stayed far-away from medical facility and in case of parental concerns, these children received intravenous amoxicillin. For this study, ARI episodes only during the first year of life were considered in analysis.\n\nIn every clinically diagnosed ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected to identify the causative respiratory virus(es) using multiplex real-time PCR assay as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (FTD Respiratory pathogens 21; Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg). The respiratory pathogens (20 viruses and 1 atypical bacterium) detected were influenza A, influenza A (H1N1) swl, influenza B; human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1; parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4; human metapneumovirus (HMPV) A and B; RV; RSV A and B; adenovirus; enterovirus; parechovirus; bocavirus; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In cases where multiple viruses were detected from the same sample, the one with the highest CT (threshold cycle) value and amplification in real-time PCR was considered for analysis. For LRTI, apart from NPA, blood for aerobic bacterial culture on sheep blood agar (Biomeriuex) and MacConkey agar (Hi-Media) medium, procalcitonin (PCT) assay using VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S PCT kit (Biomerieux SA, France), antibodies to Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae (EUROIMMUN, Germany) and urine for Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detection (BinaxNOW, Alere, Ireland) were also performed as per the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for the aetiological diagnosis. PCT value >0.5 ng/mL was taken as positive which is suggestive of bacterial infection.\n\nClinical information during each visit was recorded manually into case record form, from where data were entered into Microsoft Access software. IPFT data were automatically stored in software (SPIROWARE, Eco Medics AG) after each procedure; data of each individual were extracted and managed in Microsoft Access software. Data were managed in Microsoft Excel and analysed using Stata 13 software (Stata, College Station, Texas, USA).\n\nQuantitative variables were summarised using mean and SD if normally distributed; for skewed distribution, median (IQR) were used. IPFT indices at 3 years of age were compared between children who had ARI episodes during infancy and those who did not, using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The signed-rank test was used to compare the change in IPFT indices from baseline to 3 years of age in the two groups. For multivariate analysis, separate linear regression models were built using the indices that were significantly associated with ARI in bivariate analysis as the dependent variables. Gender, family history of atopy, presence of smoking in the household, weight and height at 3 years of age and the tidal volume at birth were added as covariates for each regression model. The difference was considered statistically significant at the p-value of <0.05.\n\nAmong the TBFVL indices, children who had suffered from ARI during infancy did not show a significant change in VT and tPTEF/tE (ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory time); other indices, namely TEF10 (tidal expiratory flow at 10% of tidal expiratory volume), TEF25(tidal expiratory flow at 25% of tidal expiratory volume), TEF25/PTEF (peak TEF) and TEF50/PTEF were significantly increased in comparison with children who did not have documented ARI episode during infancy. RTC indices did not show a significant difference between children with or without ARI episode during infancy. In RVRTC, indices for forced timed lung volume, namely FEV0.5 (forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s), FEV0.75(forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s), FEV1.0 (forced expiratory volume in 1.0 s) and FEV (forced expiratory volume) and indices for forced expiratory flow (FEF) rate, namely MEF10 (maximal expiratory flow at 10% of FVC), MEF25 (maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC) and FEF25\u201375 (FEF between 25% and 75% of FVC) were significantly decreased in children who had ARI in infancy (table 5).\n\nOn multivariable analysis using linear regression model, decreased FEV1.0 at 3 years was significantly associated with occurrence of ARI during infancy (p=0.009), female gender (p=0.03) and lower weight at 3 years (p=0.002). Presence of ARI during infancy reduced the FEV1.0 at 3 years by 20.06 mL (95% CI: \u221235.02 to 5.1). Similar results were found in FEV0.75 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221217.99, 95% CI: \u221230.37 to 5.5, p=0.005), FEV0.5 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221214.07, 95% CI: \u221223.84 to 4.29, p=0.005), FEF25\u201375 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221249.46, 95% CI: \u221285.27 to 13.64, p=0.007) and MEF25 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221257.18, 95% CI: \u221293.89 to 20.46, p=0.002).\n\nIn bivariate analysis, recurrent ARI episodes during infancy (\u22652, n=132) were associated with increased tPTEF (0.47 (0.35, 0.65) vs 0.45 (0.36, 0.63) s, p=0.02), TEF50/TIF50 (79% (68%, 87%) vs 74% (68%, 88%), p=0.03) and TEF75/PTEF (89% (85%, 93%) vs 87 (80%, 92%), p=0.04) at 3 years of age as compared with those who did not have any ARI episode during infancy. However, there were no significant changes in RTC and RVRTC indices with recurrent ARI episodes.\n\nTBFVL indices for airway resistance, namely TEF25/PTEF and TEF50/PTEF were significantly increased in children who had documented viral ARI episode during infancy in comparison to children without history of any ARI episode. No significant difference in any RTC indices was observed in the two groups. RVRTC indices for forced timed lung volume, namely FEV0.5, FEV0.75, FEV1.0 and FEV and for forced expiratory flow rate, namely MEF10, MEF25 and FEF25\u201375 were significantly decreased in children at 3 years of age with documented viral ARI episode during infancy (table 6).\n\nOn multivariable analysis, decreased FEV1.0 at 3 years was significantly associated with detection of virus in ARI in infancy (p=0.009) and lower weight at 3 years (p=0.003). Presence of virus in ARI during infancy reduced the FEV1.0 by 20.8 mL (95% CI: \u201335.3 to 5.3). Similar results were found in cases of FEV0.75 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221218.36, 95% CI: \u201331.36 to 5.36, p=0.006), FEV0.5 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221214.51, 95% CI: \u201324.76 to 4.25, p=0.006), FEF25\u201375 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221255.28, 95% CI: \u201389.2 to 21.33, p=0.002) and MEF25 (\u03b2 coefficient=\u221263.25, 95% CI: \u201393.24 to 28.26, p<0.001).\n\nDetection of virus in ARI in infancy was also associated with an increase in TEF50/PTEF (\u03b2 coefficient=1.96, 95% CI: 0.29 to 3.63, p=0.02) and TEF25/PTEF (\u03b2 coefficient=3.0, 95% CI: 0.19 to 5.81, p=0.03), when adjusted for gender, family history of atopy, weight and baseline IPFT indices.\n\nSimilar effects on TBFVL and RVRTC indices were also observed in ARI with RV, RSV, HCoV and HMPV infection during infancy. Only HMPV infection during infancy leads to a significant change in RTC indices V\u02b9max, FRC at 3 years of age, which was higher (\u03b2 coefficient=44.71, 95% CI: 10.83 to 78.58, p=0.01) as compared with those who had no ARI during infancy (see online supplementary file 1, supplementary table 2).\n\nA total of 43 children had a history of LRTI during infancy. TEF50/PTEF (89.5 vs 86.9, p=0.006) was higher in children with LRTI during infancy than children without a history of ARI during infancy. There was no significant difference in other TBFVL, RTC and RVRTC indices between them (data are not shown).\n\nA total of 57 infants with ARI episodes had documented wheezing; there was no significant difference in TBFVL, RTC and RVRTC indices between children with wheezing during ARI episode and those without a history of ARI during infancy (data not shown).\n\nThere was no significant effect of bacterial, mixed bacterial virus and mixed viral infection on IPFT indices. Hospitalisation was required in only 27 (12%) infants with no significant effect on IPFT indices at 3 years. There was no effect of various socioeconomic variables (living accommodation, parents education, history of smoking at home, source of cooking fuel, number of family member) on IPFT indices at 3 years of age in bivariate analysis (data are not shown).\n\nIt was a well-designed, prospective birth cohort study with minimal dropout rates and regular follow-up, including almost all respiratory tract infections during infancy. Effort was made to identify the aetiology of all ARIs in infancy, including virus, chlamydia, mycoplasma and other bacteria. Hence, we could also explore the association of infection with viruses like HMPV and HCoV and IPFT indices at a later stage. Instead of focusing only on LRTI, we have included all ARIs of infancy, majority of which were URIs. State-of-the-art IPFTs were performed by trained personnel in keeping with the standard requirements, thus generating robust, reliable data regarding lung functions.\n\nDocumentation of ARI episodes may be missing for some infants as their parents might not have informed or did not report to the hospital during the episodes. However, we telephonically contacted the parents from time to time to minimise such events. Besides ARI episodes, there might be other associated factors like genetics and environmental factors (indoor or outdoor pollution) which may affect pulmonary functions and these factors had not been considered here. In our study, LRTI was defined as per the WHO definition of pneumonia; chest X-ray of all children suspected of LRTI was not done due to ethical reasons.\n\nARI during infancy can affect the developing respiratory system. At 3 years of age, in our cohort, significantly lower FEV and flow rate indices were associated with ARI episode in infancy, female gender and low current weight. Apart from RSV and RV, other viruses like HMPV and HCoV infections during infancy also had a significant impact on pulmonary function at 3 years."}
