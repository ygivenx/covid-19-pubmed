Lack of SARS-CoV-2 RNA environmental contamination in a tertiary referral hospital for infectious diseases in Northern Italy", "body": "The World Health Organization defined Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus belonging to the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) spread in a similar fashion as Rhinoviruses, by direct contact with infected secretions or large aerosol droplets [1] . Health care workers are at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, possibly due to direct contact with the patients. Indeed, transmission of HCoVs through environmental contamination has been reported in healthcare settings [2] . Understanding which are the potentially contaminated surfaces in a healthcare environment is crucial to protect healthcare workers from this virus showing an unprecedented exponential trend with a doubling time of 3.6-4.1 days [3] . In this regard, studies suggest that surfaces and suspensions can carry HCoVs, increasing the risk of contact transmission that could lead to hospital acquired HCoVs infections [4, 5] Since February 21, 2020, when the first autochthonous case in Italy was confirmed, an overwhelming number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is continuously being detected, exceeding 8,000 cases at the time of writing. Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, is a 1,300-bed tertiary teaching hospital in Northern Italy and a national SARS-CoV-2 referral center. The hospital houses 23 ICU beds and 44 Infectious Diseases (ID) beds, the latter being distributed in two floors.\n\nIn the ID ward, each room has a buffer zone to allow safe donning and disposal of PPE.\n\nHealthcare workers involved in the direct care of patients use the following PPE: liquid-repelling gowns, double gloves, a class 2 filtering face-piece respirator (FFP2) and eye protection (goggles or face shield). Cleaning procedures have been standardized [7], in particular ward surfaces are cleaned with sodium hypochloride at the concentration of 1,000 ppM of free chlorine (0.1%) daily and 5,000 ppM of free chlorine (0.5%) in terminal sanitization.\n\nFrom February 21 to 29, 580 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified by the Virology laboratory, and those with interstitial pneumonia were admitted. Samples were collected on 28 th February; by that day 100% of admitted patients were COVID-19 positive with pneumonia, and were treated with C-PAP or high flux oxygen.\n\nSurfaces in areas considered virus free were swabbed to search for COVID-19 RNA.
