{"title": "Chapter 12 Viral Disease", "body": "1 2 . V I R A L D I S E A S E 427 aggregate, to variable degrees, erythrocytes of other species (Tattersall and Cotmore, 1986) . This property was useful for serotyping viral isolates by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), a method that has been superseded by more modern serodiagnostic tests, discussed below. There is no evidence that strains within a given serogroup are antigenically distinguishable, even though they may differ in nucleic acid sequence, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity. For example, RV-UMass and RV-Y belong to the same serogroup, but RV-UMass appears to replicate faster in vitro and to be more pathogenic in vivo (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2001) .\n\nRV and H-1 virus grow well in primary rat embryo cells and C6 rat glial cells. RV also replicates in continuous cell lines such as 324K (human embryonic kidney) and BHK21 (hamster kidney). H-1 virus also can be propagated in rat nephroma cells (Tattersall and Cotmore, 1986; Paturzo et al., 1987) whereas RPV replicates well in 324K cells (Ball-Goodrich, et al., 1998) . Productively infected cells usually develop cytopathic effects (CPE), beginning with intranuclear inclusions and proceeding rapidly to cytolysis. The kinetics and severity of CPE depend on virus strain and dose and the level of confluence of the cell substrate. High concentrations of input virus can induce intranuclear antigen indicative of replication within 12 hours and CPE within several days, whereas low concentrations may not induce measurable effects for a week or more. Cultures that contain actively dividing cells are more susceptible to viral infection and replication than confluent cultures.\n\nClinical signs. Natural parvoviral infections in rats are usually asymptomatic and first detected by seroconversion or suspected from distorted research results. The prevalence of clinical signs depends on virus strain and dose, host age, and route of exposure. Host genotype is not known to affect susceptibility to infection or disease. In the context of these variables, RV and H-1 serotypes are demonstrably pathogenic after experimental inoculation, whereas RPV is not. Clinical signs of RV or H-1 virus infection are most readily elicited in pregnant or infant rats. Resistance to clinical illness appears to develop by 1 week postpartum (Gaertner et al., 1996) . The onset of resistance has been attributed to a decline in mitotic activity among target tissues and postnatal development of immune competence.\n\nPrenatal infection with pathogenic serotypes can cause fetal deaths resulting in partial or complete loss of litters in dams that appear otherwise clinically normal (Kilham and Ferm, 1964; Kilham and Margolis, 1966; Kilham and Margolis, 1969; Jacoby et al., 1988; Gaertner et al., 1996) . It is unclear whether intrauterine mortality reduces a dam's subsequent reproductive performance. Infection in late pregnancy or within several days after parturition can cause severe or fatal disease in infants, particularly due to hemorrhage and necrosis in the liver and central nervous system Cole et al., 1970; Margolis and Kilham, 1970) . Signs in affected infants can include ataxia, icterus, and diarrhea, or sudden death . Rats that survive acute disease may have locomotion deficits or may die later from chronic active hepatitis and progressive hepatic fibrosis. Although clinical signs are rare in rats exposed to virus beyond 1 week after birth, fatal hemorrhagic lesions have been reported in weanlings and immunosuppressed adults (El Dadah et al., 1967; Coleman et al., 1983) . They also have been elicited in infected rats with induced increases in hepatic mitotic activity (Ruffolo et al., 1966) .\n\nEpidemiology. The relative prevalence of the three known serotypes has been complicated by the use of generic antigens for serologic testing. This raises the possibility that RPV has contributed to seroconversions attributed historically to RV and/or H-1 virus. The recent availability of serotype-specific antigens (see below) should make differentiation of parvoviral infections more precise. Rattus norvegicus is the only known natural host for RV, H-1 virus, and RPV. Based largely on studies with RV, infections should be considered highly contagious, ratto-rat transmission occurring primarily by contact with infectious animals per se or particulate contaminants, such as animal bedding (Jacoby et al., 1988; Yang et al., 1995) . Both RV and RPV (and presumably H-1 virus) infect renal tubular epithelium which facilitates excretion in urine. There is some evidence that RV can infect intestinal mucosa and lead to fecal excretion (Lipton et al., 1973) , but intestine does not appear to be a prominent target tissue. Intestinal infection is prominent with RPV, although affecting predominantly the lamina propria . Therefore, its contribution to fecal excretion of virus is unresolved. Natural postnatal exposure to parvoviruses of rats appears due to inhalation and/or ingestion of virus or virus-contaminated fomites. Prenatal transmission is secondary to maternal infection. However, it appears to require exposure of dams to large doses of virus and/or virulent strains (of RV or H-1 virus) Jacoby et al., 1988; Fig. 12-3 Acute rat virus infection. Intranuclear rat virus antigen (arrows) in renal tubular epithelial cells detected by immunoperoxidase staining. (Modified from Jacoby et al., 1987 with permission from Archives of Virology.) F(~. Acute rat parvovirus infection. Viral DNA in an intestinal villus detected by in situ hybridization (arrow). Gaertner et al., 1996; Kajiwara et al., 1996) . This requirement helps to explain why prenatal infection is uncommon during natural outbreaks in breeding colonies.\n\nThe risk of transmission is prolonged by persistent infection in rats and protracted environmental contamination. These properties have been clearly established for RV but should be assumed for all parvoviruses of rats. Susceptibility to persistent RV infection depends heavily on age and immunologic status. Infection in adult immunocompetent rats is usually eliminated within 4 weeks, whereas pre-or perinatal infection can lead to persistent infection lasting at least 6 months, despite the onset of antiviral humoral immunity (Gaertner et al., 1989 Jacoby et al., 1991) . Persistently infected rats also can excrete virus for up to 3 months, and episodic excretion over longer periods cannot be ruled out (Jacoby et al., 1988) . Passive immunization with RV immune serum protects rats from acute and persistent infection . Similarly, maternally acquired immunity appears to protect rats born to persistently infected dams (Jacoby et al., 1988) . However, passive immunity is most effective if it is established prior to infection. Antibody administered even 1 day after exposure to virus provides only partial protection against infection. Thus, the potential for persistent infection develops soon after virus reaches its cellular targets. Immunodeficient (athymic) rats, unsurprisingly, are susceptible to persistent RV infection at any age (Gaertner et al., 1989) . Administration of RV-immune serum to infected athymic adults suppresses but does not eliminate virus, which can reemerge after immunity decays . The environmental stability of RV has been demonstrated by Yang and co-workers, who found that virus remained infectious on plastic surfaces for at least 5 weeks (Yang et al., 1995) .\n\nPathology and pathogenesis. Pioneering studies by Kilham, Margolis, Toolan, Cole, Nathanson, and others indicated that the predilection of RV and H-1 virus for mitotically active cells was responsible for pathogenic infections in fetal and infant rats, especially in the liver, central nervous system, and lymphopoietic tissues (Toolan et al., 1960; Kilham and Ferm, 1964; Kilham and Margolis, 1966; Margolis et al., 1968; Cole et al., 1970; Novotny and Hetrick, 1970) . Virus infection in these tissues has been documented more recently by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993) , indicating that oronasal exposure leads to viremic dissemination. Lesions caused by pathogenic strains are often widespread but most readily detected in liver, which is both susceptible to infection and mitotically active during infancy. Viral replication causes intranuclear inclusions , followed rapidly by degenerative changes, including ballooning degeneration, intensified cytoplasmic eosinophilia, dissociation of histoarchitecture, nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and cell lysis. Associated lesions may include focal hemorrhage, bile stasis, and formation of blood-filled spaces resembling peliosis hepatis. These changes are reflected by gross lesions that \n\nmay include icterus and yellow-red mottling of the liver accompanied by distorted lobular contours caused by necrosis. Attempts at repair result in increased mitotic activity, which may include the formation of polyploid giant cells. Persistent infection can incite chronic active hepatitis. Portal triads in affected livers may sustain chronic inflammation with infiltration by mononuclear cells, fibrosis, nodular hyperplasia, and biliary hyperplasia ( Fig. 12-7) . Corresponding gross lesions can include fibrosis and nodular distortion of one or more lobes. Necrosis and hemorrhage can occur virtually anywhere in the central nervous system but often affect the cerebellum. Segmental or pancerebellar destruction of the external germinal layer leads to granuloprival cerebellar hypoplasia ( Fig. 12-9 ). Hemorrhage may be significant in the cerebellum or other sites and may result in infarction and malacia. Lymphoreticular lesions also are typified by necrosis, which can affect thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. Intrauterine uterine infection often results in necrosis of fetuses, placentas, and degrees of fetal resorption. Corresponding gross lesions may vary from a reduction to a total loss of viable fetuses and include segmental reddish-black discoloration of the uterus and accumulation of necrotic debris at placentation sites.\n\nThe prevalence of hemorrhagic lesions illustrates the importance of vasculotropism in pathogenic parvovirus infections. Hemorrhage during acute infection appears to result from viral-induced endothelial injury (Cole et al., 1970) . Inclusion bodies, viral DNA, and viral antigens have been demonstrated in endothelium ( Fig. 12-10 ) (Margolis and Kilham, 1970; Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993; Jacoby et al., 2000) . Infection may cause cells to swell or lyse, thereby disrupting vascular integrity. Baringer and Nathanson (1972) found that platelet-fibrin aggregates attached preferentially to RV-infected cells and suggested that endothelial infection activated the clotting mechanism, resulting in infarction and hemorrhage. Additionally, RV infection of megakaryocytes with resulting thrombocytopenia can occur during acute infection (Margolis and Kilham, 1972) . Endothelial infection may also exacerbate viremia and facilitate fetal infection through involvement of placental and fetal vasculature.\n\nRV infects vascular and intestinal smooth muscle cells (SMC), which appear to be major sites of persistent infection ( Fig. 12-11 ) (Jacoby et al., 2000) . Persistent vascular SMC infection may be accompanied by perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, which most often are found in kidney and liver. Viral DNA can be demonstrated in adjacent vessels by in situ hybridization (Jacoby et al., 2000) . The mechanisms of viral persistence are unknown, but recent studies suggest that SMC sequester non-replicating RV. RV replication also may continue among mitotically quiescent SMC (an observation that requires confirmation) (Jacoby et al., 2000) . Persistent infection of SMC does not cause prominent necrosis, but may provoke focal myolysis. Focal SMC infection also could exacerbate mitotic activity in attempts at repair and may provide additional targets for viral infection.\n\nThe role of host immunity in parvoviral infection is only partially understood. Although pre-existing humoral immunity can prevent infection, anti-viral antibody reduces but does not eliminate infection (Robey et al., 1968; Gaertner et al., 1991 Gaertner et al., , 1995 . The increased susceptibility of athymic rats confirms an important role for T lymphocytes in eliminating infection (Gaertner et al., 1989 , whereas mononuclear cell infiltrates that develop during convalescent or persistent infection suggest at least an ancillary role for cell-mediated immunity.\n\nIn contrast to RV and H-1 virus, RPV is non-pathogenic even in infant rats. However, it does express similar tissue tropisms. In particular, it infects vascular endothelium and renal tubular epithelium ( Fig. 12 -4) as well as regional lymph nodes ( Fig. 12-13 ) (Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998) . However, unlike RV and H-1 virus, it also infects the lamina propria of intestinal mucosa ( Fig. 12-5) , a tropism comparable to that of MVM and mouse parvovirus (MPV). Therefore, mechanisms of productive RPV replication and excretion may differ from those of the cytolytic parvoviruses. Further, there is no evidence that RPV is transmitted in utero. The duration of RPV infection and factors that may influence duration have not been studied adequately. Virus has been detected after seroconversion in both infant and adult rats for as long as 8 weeks (Ueno et al., 1997; Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998; Ueno et al., 1998) , a finding consistent with persistent infection.\n\nDiagnosis. The diagnosis of parvovirus infection depends on the complementary use of several methods. Clinical signs can be dramatic, but occur rarely. Standard pathologic examination can be useful, especially to detect inclusions and/or lesions compatible with pathogenic infection. However, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is best achieved with tissue sections by immunostaining or in situ hybridization. Fixation of tissues in fleshly prepared paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate for not more than 16 hours preserves cytoarchitecture and minimizes denaturation of parvoviral antigens and DNA (Jacoby et al., 1987; Gaertner et al., 1993) . Therefore, this method should be used prior to paraffin embedding to permit maximum flexibility in primary and follow-up examination of tissues or cells if parvovirus infection is suspected. Because infections are frequently asymptomatic, serology is essential for primary detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) using virions or infected cells as generic antigens can be used to detect all known serotypes. Alternatively an ELISA using rNS-1 from MPV can detect infection caused by parvoviruses of rats because NS-1 is highly conserved among rodent parvoviruses . Follow-up testing can employ HAI to directly distinguish RV and H-1 virus infection. Additionally, sera positive by ELISA and/or IFA and negative by HAI would suggest RPV infection. However, the sensitivity of the generic assays is higher than that of HAI, so testing of sera with low concentrations of antibody could produce a false-negative HAI result. Neutralization serology also can be used to distinguish among serotypes, as all replicate in at least one established cell line. This option is comparatively expensive, time consuming, and technically more demanding, making it best suited to use in reference laboratories. The most promising emerging strategy for specific, sensitive cost-effective serologic detection employs recombinant, serotype-specific (capsid) ELISA antigens. They have been produced for RV and RPV as recombinant VP-2 (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002) . Addition of a corresponding H-1 antigen should be straightforward.\n\nAlthough serologic testing indicates historical or contemporary exposure to virus, immunostaining and molecular diagnostics may be required to obtain evidence for active infection. Antisera against rat parvoviruses are available and can be applied to snap-frozen or aldehydefixed tissues. Serotype-specific antibodies are not yet generally available, and immunostaining results from experimental studies indicate that antibodies to NS-1 proteins are more sensitive than those against VP2 proteins. Thus, immunostaining alone does not currently provide the means to confirm serotype specificity. In situ hybridization can employ strand-specific probes to detect not only virus genome, but also replicative forms and mRNA indicative of active infection.\n\nThe rat antibody production (RAP) test, adapted from a method developed for detection of mouse viruses, can detect viral antigens in clinical specimens. Test tissues are homogenized and inoculated into non-immune pathogenfree rats to elicit antibodies against suspected viral agents. Testing requires that live rats be held in quarantine for several weeks to allow antibodies to develop, making it relatively laborious and expensive. Although, in practical terms, it also requires that infectious virus be present in the test inoculum, it does not inherently rule out seroconversions elicited by viral antigen that may be present in non-infectious samples.\n\nFour polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are currently available to detect parvoviruses of rats. They are very sensitive and improved primers make them increasingly specific. One assay amplifies a region of the NS-1 gene, thereby detecting all serotypes, but not distinguishing among them. The other three amplify VP region sequences for RV, H-1 virus, or RPV, making them serotype-specific (Besselsen et al. 1995a,b; Yagami et al., 1995) . They can be used to test tissues, excreta, or cells (e.g., tumor lines) for viral DNA.\n\nVirus isolation can be accomplished by inoculation of the cell lines listed above or by explant culture, which is an amplification technique especially conducive to detecting small quantities of infectious virus, such as those occurring during persistent infection (Paturzo et al., 1987) . Briefly, it entails culture of multiple small fragments of suspect tissue for about 3 weeks. Cultures are harvested and aliquots are inoculated into indicator cells, which are examined for viral antigen and/or CPE. Differential diagnosis. Pathogenic parvoviral infections should be differentiated from chemical toxicity, neoplasia, trauma, genetically determined developmental abnormalities, or rotavirus infection. Reproductive failures or reduced litter size also can occur during Sendai virus or coronavirus infection or environmental insults.\n\nControl and prevention. Control and prevention must take into account the ability of parvoviruses to persist in rats and in the environment, and their capacity for both pre-and postnatal transmission. Initial assessment of an outbreak should begin with quarantine of seropositive rooms, extensive serologic testing in each room, in adjacent or regional facilities, and sites to which ROBERT O. JACOBY AND DIANE J. GAERTNER potentially affected rats or rat tissues may have been transported, including research laboratories. Cell lines, transplantable tumors, and other biological products, which may be either a source of or exposed to infection, should be tested rapidly by molecular diagnostics, or the RAP method and contaminated items should be discarded. Strategies to eliminate infection depend on multiple factors, including the value and immunologic status of infected or exposed animals and the ability to replace them from specific pathogen-free sources. Selective culling can be attempted if animals are housed in isolation or individually ventilated cages, but one must consider risks posed by persistent infection and environmental contamination. Attempts to minimize further transmission should include use of barrier caging and change stations, limiting personnel traffic, barrier garb, and strict adherence to room order entry and sanitation during cage changing, including heat sterilization of soiled equipment and supplies. Directional air flow should be tested and affected rooms placed under negative pressure. Rederivation can be accomplished by embryo transfer or cesarean section under stringently aseptic conditions. However, offspring should be tested for prenatal infection by contact transmission (which may include testing of foster dams) or pathologic examination of strategically chosen animals (e.g., at least one per litter). It is important to remember that the prenatal transfer of maternal antibody may render derived progeny at least transiently seropositive, yet protected. Therefore, they should be tested to ensure that antibody titers decay completely by 3 months after birth. A reversal of decreasing titer would suggest active infection.\n\nBecause pre-existing humoral immunity protects rats from infection, it can be exploited to help rederive breeding colonies. For example, progeny weaned from seropositive dams can be segregated from virus-free rats until they lose maternally derived immunity. However their dams should remain segregated if they will be used for further matings or be discarded as suspects for persistent infection. The use of contact sentinels to confirm the absence of infection in rederived rats is an optional step. This immunologically based strategy may take 3-to 4 months to complete, but research \"down time\" can be minimized by re-initiation of breeding among rederived rats while the decay of maternal immunity proceeds. Incremental serologic surveillance of facilities housing or previously housing infected rats is wise until confidence in elimination of infection is secure. Refer to Sections III A. and IV for additional information about the prevention and control of viral agents in rats.\n\nPreviously infected rooms should be evacuated and thoroughly disinfected, including physical removal of any debris or fomites from floors, walls, and ceilings. Detergent washes should be followed by disinfection with an oxidizing agent, such as chlorine dioxide, and a drying period of 2-to 3 days (Saknimit et al., 1988) . Additional checks on the thoroughness of decontamination may include placement of sentinel rats and/or swabbing of surfaces for PCR analysis.\n\nInterference with research. Although infection with pathogenic strains can cause illness and death, the more likely effects of parvovirus infection will be disruption of biological responses that rely on cell proliferation. RV is lymphocytotropic and can induce functional distortions in immune function. These include: interference with T cell responses to transplantable neoplasms (Campbell et al., 1977) , provocation of autoimmune diabetes in diabetesresistant rat strains by disruption of Thl-like T lymphocyte responses (Guberski et al., 1991; Brown et al., 1993; Ellerman et al., 1996) , and diminished proliferative and cytolytic responses to alloantigens in mixed lymphocyte cultures (McKisic et al., 1995) . Further, parvoviruses of rats are oncotropic, raising the possibility for disruption of tumor kinetics (Bergs, 1969) . Finally, contamination of cell cultures or other biological products must be considered (Nicklas et al., 1993) . It can lead to cytopathic effects or inadvertent transmission to rats if such products are used in vivo.\n\nRat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) is the only known herpesvirus of rats. It has physical, chemical, and biological characteristics typical of the Herpesviridae, including the capacity for persistent infection of salivary glands (Priscott and Tyrell, 1982; Bruggeman et al., 1983; Bruggeman et al., 1985) . Virus can be propagated in primary rat embryo fibroblasts, rat kidney cells, and hamster kidney cells. Infection of immunocompetent rats is asymptomatic. Experimental infection of rats immunosuppressed by whole body irradiation induced systemic disease with high mortality, but no studies of infection in naturally immunodeficient rats have been reported. RCMV appears to be infectious only for rats. There is no published evidence for natural cross-infection of rats with cytomegaloviruses of other species or for infection of other species with RCMV. Although infection has been detected in wild rats, the prevalence of RCMV in contemporary rat colonies is believed to be very low. However, epidemiologic data are inadequate to confirm this perception because serologic surveillance is performed sporadically. Nevertheless, prevention of infection in vivaria should focus on exclusion of wild rats, especially from support areas such as those used for supply and equipment storage.\n\nAlthough acute infection may be generalized, persistent infection occurs in the salivary glands and may affect the lacrimal glands (Lyon et al., 1959) . Virus can be excreted\n\nThere is serologic and histologic evidence that rats are susceptible to infection with one or more adenoviruses antigenically related to mouse adenovirus-2 (Ward and Young, 1976) . However, the causative agent(s) has not been isolated. Infection, to the best of available knowledge, is asymptomatic. Histologic changes are minimal and resemble those found in adenoviral infections of mice, with the sporadic development of intranuclear inclusions in enterocytes of the small intestine. virus of mice has been detected in rats. It was found in saliva for at least several months. Typical lesions include cytomegaly with formation of intranuclear inclusions, primarily in ductal epithelium ( Fig. 12-14) , accompanied by mild, non-suppurative interstitial inflammation. Infection can be detected from typical histopathologic changes, which are most apparent during the first few weeks of infection. An ELISA is available for serologic testing (Bruggeman et al., 1983) . Virus can be isolated by inoculation of or cultivation with rat embryo fibroblasts initially in athymic rats that developed a wasting disease accompanied, in a minority of animals, by pneumonia and sialoadenitis (Ward et al., 1984) . Intranuclear inclusions consistent with papovavirus infection occurred in parotid salivary glands, and viral antigen was detected in salivary glands, respiratory airway mucosa, and kidney. Immunocompetent rats did not develop disease. More recent studies in athymic rats have detected intranuclear inclusions in alveolar lining cells and associated with interstitial pneumonia (Percy and Barthold, 2001) . (Rabson et al., 1969) . Effects on research. Reported effects on research include III. I N F E C T I O N A N D DISEASE CAUSED BY altered macrophage function, transient suppression of humoral immunity, transfer of infection during organ transplant studies, and exacerbation of collagen-induced arthritis (Bruggeman et al., 1985) . Latent infection can be activated by immunosuppression. Conversely, RCMV replication can be augmented by allogeneic immune responses (Tamura et al., 1999) . No significant effects on research have been reported from natural infections.\n\nAgents. The Coronaviridae are enveloped, pleomorphic single-stranded RNA viruses with club-like projections (peplomers) radially arranged on their capsids. They replicate in the cytoplasm and are released by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum (Compton et al., 1993) . They are widespread among mammals and birds, including laboratory rats and mice, but individual viruses are largely species-specific. Classification of the coronaviruses An agent called Turkemia rodent poxvirus, distinct of rats has been somewhat confused by the context in from ectromelia virus, has been reported in rats from which the two prototype strains were initially identified. Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (Iftimovici In 1964, Hartley and co-workers detected antibodies in et al., 1976; Marrenikova and Shelukhina, 1976 ; Krikun, rat sera to a common coronavirus of mice, mouse hepa-1977; Marenikovaet al., 1978; Kraftet al., 1982) . Although titis virus (MHV), which suggested that rats were infection can be asymptomatic, if clinical signs occur susceptible to an antigenically related agent (Hartley they resemble mousepox including the development of et al., 1964). Parker and associates subsequently isolated dermal lesions, tail amputation, and high mortality, a coronavirus from lungs of clinically normal rats which Rats also develop lesions of the upper and lower respi-became widely known as Parker's rat coronavirus (Parker ratory tract. The latter can include interstitial pneumonia, et al., 1970) . Within several years, a second coronavirus pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, and pleural effusions, was isolated by Bhatt and co-workers from rats with 436 ROBERT O. JACOBYAND DIANE J. GAERTNER sialodacryoadenitis and was named sialodacrvoadenitis virus (Bhatt et al., 1972) . Subsequent studies showed that RCV and SDAV were similar antigenically and physicochemically, and that both induced sialodacryoadenitis and inflammation of the respiratory tract. Therefore, RCV and SDAV should be perceived as different strains of a coronavirus indigenous to rats and called, most inclusively, RCV (Percy and Williams, 1990) .\n\nReplication of single-stranded RNA viruses is more error-prone than that of DNA viruses and leads to emergence of divergent strains during natural infections. Thus, additional RCV isolates have been reported since the initial isolations by Parker and Bhatt. These include Japanese isolates--CARS (Kojima et al., 1980; Maru and Sato, 1982) hand U.S. isolates RCV-BCMM, RCV-W (Compton et al., 1999a) , and RCV-NJ (Compton et al., 1999b) .\n\nRCV has a non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genome (Compton et al., 1993) . It is sensitive to lipid solvents and relatively stable at acid pH. It can be stored at -6 0 ~ C for at least 7 years, but loses infectivity rapidly if stored at -2 0 ~ C (Bhatt et al., 1972; Jacoby et al., 1979) . It replicates in vitro in primary rat kidney (PRK) cells in which most virus strains form multinucleate syncytia typical of coronaviral CPE (Bhatt et al., 1972) . Virus can be detected antigenically in infected cells within 12 hours and CPE can develop within 24 hours. Established cell lines such as BHK-21, VERO, Hep-2, and NCTC 1469 resist RCV infection, but mouse L2 fibroblasts and sublines, as well as rat LBC cells and intestinal RCV-9 cells, also can be infected (Hirano et al., 1986; Percy et al., 1989; Percy et al., 1990b; Gaertner et al., 1996; Ohsawa et al., 1996) . L2 cell sublines and LBC cells also have been used for plaque assays and plaque purification (Gaertner et al., 1993c) .\n\nRCV antigens appear to be similar among all isolates, although some also have a hemagglutinating surface protein (Gaertner et al., 1996a; Gagneten et al., 1996) . Because RCV is antigenically related to MHV (Barker et al., 1994) , MHV antigens are routinely used in serologic testing to detect RCV infection (Peters and Collins, 1981; Smith and Winograd, 1986; .\n\nClinical signs. Clinical signs may vary with RCV strain, but their overall expression is characteristic of coronavirus infection. Mild infection can be clinically silent and revealed first by seroconversion of sentinel or index rats, but clinical signs are common in many outbreaks. They can occur in non-immune rats of any age, usually last about a week, and occur in various combinations and with varying severity (Jacoby et al., 1975; Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985) . Early signs, especially in sucklings, often include squinting, photophobia, and lacrimation ( Fig. 12-15 ). Older rats frequently develop audible sneezing and palpable enlargement of cervical salivary glands. Closer examination may also reveal serous nasal discharge and pawing at the external nares resulting in wet forefeet. Red-tinged discharges containing porphyrin (chromodacryorrhea) may stain periorbital and perinasal skin ( Fig. 12-16 ). Severe ocular inflammation is expressed initially as keratoconjunctivitis, which may resolve quickly or become chronic. Chronic ocular inflammation can lead to corneal opacities and ulcers, pannus, hypopyon, hyphema, and megaloglobus (Lai et al., 1976) (Figs. 12.17 and 12.18) . Ancillary effects attributable to the discomfort of infection include transient anorexia and weight loss (Sato et al., 2001) and disruption of estrus (Utsumi et al., 1978 (Utsumi et al., , 1980 . Additionally, birth rates and fertility in breeding colonies have been observed to markedly decline during acute epizootics. Although morbidity may be high, RCV infection rarely causes mortality. Most rats recover, with the most frequent long term sequelae associated with ocular disease.\n\nin \"open\" cages and among rooms in conventional facilities. Transmission appears to be primarily by direct contact with infected rats or by aerosol. However, limited tests have shown that RCV can remain infectious for at least 2 days when dried on plastic surfaces (Gaertner et al., 1993a) . This suggests that fomite transmission also may occur. Experimental studies have demonstrated the ease of horizontal transmission of RCV (LaRegina et. al., 1992) , but there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission. Morbidity frequently reaches 100% among conventionally housed rats.\n\nColony infections often occur in either of two patterns: explosive epizootics among non-immune animals or endemic infection in rooms where young rats are protected transiently by maternal antibody. Non-immune, immunocompetent rats excrete virus in oronasal and lacrimal discharges for about 1 week (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985) . The onset of antiviral immunity terminates infection and is most easily detected by seroconversion. Immunity offers protection against recurrence of clinical disease, but protection is relatively short-lived (< 6 months) and does not preclude transient re-infection, virus shedding, and a resultant increase in antibody titer (Percy et al., 1990a; Weir et al., 1990a; Percy and Scott, 1991) . Re-infection of seropositive animals implies exposure to antigenically variant strains. This risk is inherent to coronavirus infections because of spontaneous mutations leading to the emergence of variant strains, especially during endemic infection. Infection of immunodeficient (e.g., athymic) rats is persistent (Weir et al., 1990b; Hajjar et al., 1991) . Such rats can sustain chronic necrosis and inflammation in the salivary and lacrimal glands and the respiratory tract, as described below. Additionally, they can excrete virus for prolonged periods because their capacity for immune elimination of infection is impaired. Apart from oronasal and lacrimal excretion, immunodeficient rats can develop urinary tract infection, which makes transmission by contaminated urine likely. In contrast to the prolonged course of RCV infection in athymic rats, Hanna and co-workers found that immunosuppression with prednisolone had a negligible effect on the course of infection, and treatment with cyclophosphamide resulted in only a modest prolongation.\n\nAlthough there is no firm evidence for genetic resistance and susceptibility to RCV infection , recent studies suggested that Lewis rats developed more severe clinical signs than other rat strains tested (Liang et al., 1995) . There also is evidence that RCV strains may vary in virulence, but corresponding antigenic differences detected by plaque neutralization are not useful to predict the severity of clinical disease (Compton et al., 1999b) .\n\nRats appear to be the sole hosts for naturally occurring infection, although there is experimental evidence that mice develop transient infection and interstitial pneumonia after inoculation with virus or contact exposure to infected rats Barthold et al., 1990; La Regina et al., 1992) . Mice experimentally inoculated with large doses of RCV can transmit infection to mice\n\nin close contact; however, RCV infection does not appear by vascular congestion (Fig. 12-19 ).

Similar changes also affect the vomeronasal organ. The nasal meatus often contains neutrophils, cell debris, and mucus (Jacoby et al., 1975; Bihun and Percy, 1995) . Mild, nonsuppurative tracheitis with focal necrosis of respiratory epithelium also may occur and hyperplastic peribronchial lymphoid nodules may develop. Pulmonary lesions are less frequent and are characterized by focal, interstitial pneumonia presenting as infiltration of alveolar septae by mononuclear cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 12-21 ). More severe lesions may be accompanied by alveolar exudates containing exfoliated pneumocytes, macrophages, and edema fluid. Although such lesions are typically asymptomatic, Parker and colleagues demonstrated that RCV can induce lethal interstitial pneumonia in neonatal rats (Parker et al., 1970) .\n\n9 Fig. 12-19 Rat coronavirus infection. Pale, enlarged salivary glands Fig. 12-20 Rat coronavirus infection. Necrosis of respiratory epitheand interstitial inflammatory edema, lium and inflammation of nasal mucosa. Salivary gland lesions occur in serous or mixed parenchyma and are, therefore, most easily visualized in the submandibular and parotid salivary glands, although smaller serous glands lining the oral cavity also are susceptible. Mucous salivary glands are not affected. Lesions begin as necrosis of ductular epithelium ( Fig. 12-22) , which progresses rapidly to diffuse acinar necrosis. Moderate to severe interstitial inflammatory edema also develops within glandular parenchyma and in periglandular connective tissues. The combined effects of necrosis and inflammation often lead to regional or panacinar effacement of affected glands. Lacrimal gland lesions develop in a similar pattern (Fig. 12-23 ).\n\nHistologic lesions in immunodeficient (athymic) rats are characterized by chronic active inflammation in the respiratory tract, salivary glands ( Fig. 12-24) , and lacrimal glands. They represent chronic tissue damage caused by persistent infection concomitant with ineffective attempts by the host to eliminate virus and effect tissue repair. As noted above, viral antigen has been detected in the urinary tract of athymic rats, indicating that defective immunity leads to altered tissue tropism and the likelihood of prolonged urinary excretion (Fig. 12-25) (Weir et al., 1990b) .\n\nImmunohistochemistry has shown that the foregoing lesions, irrespective of immune status, result from initial metaplasia of ductular epithelium, including the tubuloalveolar epithelium of the Harderian gland, and proliferation of hyperchromatic regenerating acinar cells (Fig. 12.26) . Restoration of cytoarchitecture is substantially complete in 4 to 6 weeks, facilitated by survival of basement membranes, which provide an effective framework for parenchymal regeneration. Residual lesions include focal lymphocytic infiltrates and mild fibrosis.\n\nKeratoconjunctivitis does not result from direct RCV infection of the eye.

Because acute lesions develop within 5 days of exposure to virus and are often reflected in clinical signs, it is best to select animals for pathologic study that have active clinical signs or have been in recent contact with clinically affected animals. Immunohistochemistry to detect RCV antigens in aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is useful to visualize virus in tissues collected during acute infection, as virus is eliminated rapidly with the onset of host immunity. Serology is used routinely to detect or confirm infection. However, it generally takes 7 to 10 days after initial exposure to virus before an individual rat becomes seropositive. The preferred serologic tests are an immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using virus-infected cells or an ELISA (Peters and Collins, 1981; Smith and Winograd, 1986; Machii et al., 1988; , both of which use MHV as antigen to exploit its cross-reactivity with RCV.

Its prevalence has abated owing to improved housing, husbandry, and serologic surveillance. Mice were the primary targets of Sendai virus infection. There are, however, several reports of natural outbreaks in rats. Because Sendai virus also is infectious for hamsters and guinea pigs, infection would place multiple species at risk. Agent. Sendai virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic, spherical, or filamentous virus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It has a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes six proteins including a surface HN glycoprotein with hemagglutinin and neuraminidase moieties that are responsible for adsorption to host cells, and a surface F glycoprotein that facilitates cell fusion important to virus entry, expressed cytologically as syncytia formation (Brownstein, 1986) . Sendai virus is also known as parainfluenza virus 1 and can be serologically differentiated from strains 2, 3 and 4. It grows well in embryonated eggs and in multiple established cell lines, including BHK-21 cells. Other biological and biochemical characteristics of Sendai virus have been described elsewhere (Brownstein, 1986) .\n\nClinical signs. Infection in rats, in contrast to mice, is primarily asymptomatic. However, clinical signs have been observed during natural (Makino et al., 1972) and experimental (Castleman, 1983; Giddens et al., 1987) infection. These include dyspnea, anorexia, and ruffled pelage. Indirect clinical effects have been attributed to the general stress of infection and include fetal resorption, reduced litter size, and retarded growth (Coid and Wardman, 1971 ).\n\nEpidemiology. Rats of all ages are susceptible to infection, but it is acute and self-limiting in immunocompetent animals. Elimination of virus coincides with the onset of antiviral immunity at about 1 week after initial exposure. Because infection is highly contagious and transmitted by aerosol, rapid spread is common. This effect has been documented by Makino and co-workers (et al., 1972) who observed infection in a colony of 500 breeding rats with subsequent outbreaks re-occurring at 8-to 10-month intervals as newly susceptible rats emerged from the breeding program. Signs of respiratory disease and retarded growth among suckling rats occurred during each episode. Endemic infection is punctuated by fresh clinical outbreaks, typical for acute viral infections in which recovery leads to transient maternally derived immunity followed by renewed susceptibility. Antibody responses to virus remain high for at least several months after acute infection, but decline to low or undetectable levels within 9 months. In these contexts, the epidemiologic pattern and risks from Sendai virus infection in rats resemble those described for RCV infection. However, there is no specific evidence regarding long-term risks for re-infection with Sendai virus. Infection has not been described in immunodeficient rats, but one should assume, as for immunodeficient mice, that it would persist in individual animals and that the risks for transmission would be high. There is no evidence for prenatal infection.\n\nPatholog3\" and pathogenesis. Patterns of infection and lesions are similar in infant, weanling, and young adult rats, but viral clearance is slower in infants (Castleman, 1983 : Castleman et al., 1987 Giddens et al., 1987) . Thus, virus can be detected beyond the first week of infection, whereas older rats generally clear virus by 1 week. This difference is reflected in a slower onset of humoral anti-Sendai virus immunity in infant rats. Infection causes rhinitis with subsequent development of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Grossly, affected portions of lung are dark red and consolidated. Otitis media may develop in some rats. Upper respiratory lesions begin within 4 days of exposure to virus, but viral antigen can be detected in respiratory epithelium within l-to 2 days. Early lesions are characterized by epithelial necrosis with mucosal infiltration by neutrophils and lymphoid cells, all of which increase in severity during the ensuing week. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia may begin as early as 2 days after exposure to virus and feature necrosis and inflammation ( Fig. 12-27) . Bronchiolar epithelium undergoes necrosis and erosion, which may be accompanied by epithelial hyperplasia. Viral replication occurs in type I and type II pneumocytes and in macrophages, resulting in necrosis and interstitial infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Pneumonic lesions are most severe at 5 to 8 days, depending on the age of affected rats, with lesions peaking earlier in weanling or young adult rats than in infant rats. Resolution of pneumonia in immunocompetent rats begins within 2 weeks after exposure and is largely complete within 3 weeks. Residual lesions include perivascular and peribronchial accumulations of mononuclear cells, which may last up to several weeks. Some rats may develop interstitial fibrosis.\n\nDiagnosis. Because clinical signs occur sporadically, they are not a reliable indicator of infection. However, Sendai virus infection should be considered if unexpected 12. V I R A L D I S E A S E 443 differential diagnosis and are described in the chapter on bacterial disease by Weisbroth, Kohn, and Boot. Because Sendai virus infection has been associated with fetal resorption and retarded growth, it must be differentiated from parvovirus infection.\n\nprevention are equivalent to those described for RCV infection. Because mice, rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs are susceptible to Sendai virus, precautions should be taken to prevent cross-infection. The essential components of containment are quarantine of infected rooms, strict sanitary measures, and tightly controlled room servicing procedures and schedules. Because Sendai virus is highly labile in the environment, clean up and disinfection should follow recommendations described for RCV. Transport of rats to laboratories should be discouraged. As with RCV, the primary source of infection is likely Fig. 12-27 Sendai virus infection.

The following picture has emerged from Other bacterial pneumonias also can be considered in the anecdotal observations and a brief report of experimental ROBERT O. JACOBYAND DIANE J. GAERTNER infection (Votsberger et al., 1982; Brownstein, 1985) . Although rhinotracheitis may occur, the most prominent lesions are perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, nonsuppurative interstitial pneumonia and hyperplasia of bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue, all of which may last up to several weeks. The vascular orientation is a point of differentiation from pneumonia caused by Sendai virus or rat coronavirus.\n\nControl and prevention. Prevention, control, and elimination follow principles described above for rat coronaviruses.\n\nInterference with research. The risks to research pertain to PVM's potential capacity as a co-pathogen and to transmission to other susceptible species, notably mice. It is worth noting, in these contexts, that PVM can exacerbate pneumocystosis in immunocompromised (SCID) mice (Bray et al., 1993) . It is not known if immunodeficient rats are susceptible to this effect.\n\nAgents. Hantaviruses are tri-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus Hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae (Nichol, 2001) . There are more than 20 known strains, each of which is closely associated with a rodent or insectivorous reservoir host (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997; Simmons and Riley, 2002) . Several hantavirus strains, including Seoul virus, are indigenous to Rattus norvegicus. Black Creek Canal virus, a strain that is highly virulent for humans, has been isolated from cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and implies that extreme caution should be employed if wild-caught cotton rats are used for research. In fact virtually all hantaviruses are known or have the potential to be zoonotic for man with varying pathogenicity ranging from asymptomatic to lethal infection. A newly recognized agent, named rat respiratory virus (RRV), has been detected in laboratory rats with interstitial pneumonia (Simmons and Riley, 2002) . Serologic tests suggest that it is related to the hantaviruses.\n\nClinical signs. Rodent hantavirus infections are typically asymptomatic but persistent, a condition attributed to co-evolution of hantaviruses with their respective hosts.\n\nEpidemiology. Rat-to-rat transmission occurs through direct contact and bite wounds, although indirect contact by fomites contaminated with excreta or secreta is possible. Recent in situ hybridization studies have detected persistent infection in kidney, exocrine pancreas, salivary gland, and skin--sites conducive to secretion/excretion of infectious virus (Compton et al., 2003) . Further, one must consider the possibility for transmission by contaminated transplantable rat tumors. Hantavirus infection should be considered persistent in individual rats despite antiviral immunity (Meyer and Schmaljohn, 2000) . The mechanism(s) of persistence is not well-understood, but prolongs risks for transmission. The distribution of rat-associated infection is virtually worldwide and has included zoonotic infections among laboratory animal workers (Desmyter et al., 1983; Lloyd et al., 1984; Lloyd and Jones, 1986; LeDuc, 1987; Tsai, 1987) . As noted above, human infection has a variety of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to lethal hemorrhagic fevers (Hart and Bennett, 1999) . The prevalence of virulent and/or zoonotic hantaviruses in laboratory rats is extremely low. Early assessments of RRV infection indicate a prevalence of approximately 8% among laboratory rats and more than 20% among laboratory mice (Simmons and Riley, 2002) .\n\nhave utilized experimental infection with Asian isolates such as Seoul virus (Lee et al., 1986; Compton et al., 2003) . Acute hantavirus infection has a widespread tissue distribution and a predilection for endothelial cells, as well as glandular and renal epithelium. Infection does not cause significant tissue damage, but can provoke mononuclear cell infiltrations in affected tissues, including lung, salivary gland, pancreas, and kidney, especially during persistent infection. Pancreatic lesions may include insulitis with at least transient elevations in blood glucose (Compton et al., 2003) . As noted above, RRV infection appears to cause interstitial pneumonia.\n\nDiagnosis. Diagnosis relies primarily on detection of specific anti-hantavirus antibodies by IFA, with an ELISA serving primarily as a back-up test (Lee et al., 1999) . Immunostaining of tissue sections or molecular techniques (in situ hybridization or RT-PCR) also can be used; however, primer sets are not readily available for all strains. Further, RT-PCR is complicated by heterogeneity inherent to hantavirus genomes. Hantaviruses can be propagated in cell culture, with Vero-6 cells being the preferred substrate, but replicate slowly and with low yield.\n\nAttempts at virus isolation should be reserved for only the most experienced and well-equipped laboratories, because of technical and safety concerns. D!fferential diagnosis. Interstitial pneumonia, which may be caused be RRV, must be differentiated from other causes of similar lesions including rat coronavirus, Sendai virus, and PVM.\n\nControl and prevention. Serologic monitoring is the key to prevent entry and spread of hantavirus infection. Infected or exposed rats should be placed under strict quarantine, and attempts to speciate the causative agent by a qualified laboratory should be undertaken as a means to assess zoonotic risk. Thus, the Asian hantaviruses present a clear zoonotic hazard, whereas there is currently no evidence for zoonotic transmission of RRV. Confirmation of a zoonotic strain should provoke depopulation 12 .

Personnel infection or exposure to inert reovirus antigens from working in affected or potentially affected areas should sources such as plant matter. don full protective gear, including ventilated hoods. If the potential for infection has been identified, the safest action is to notify and engage institutional safety officers. It also is prudent to assess rat-derived biological materials obtained from countries where hantavirus infection is endemic.\n\nEffects on research. Zoonotic threats from virulent strains are the major impediment to research. As noted above, infection of rats with Seoul virus can cause insulitis and hyperglycemia. There is no evidence for or against the possibility that interstitial pneumonia associated with RRV alters pulmonary function or susceptibility to opportunistic respiratory infections.\n\nA rotavirus has been incriminated as the cause of infectious diarrhea of infant rats (IDIR), a non-lethal\n\nTwo types of picornavirus infection have been linked to rats. Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a member of the cardiovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae, the natural host for which is the mouse . Anecdotal observations indicate that rats can develop antibodies to TMEV, but no associated disease or lesions have been found. In historical perspective, a TMEV-like agent called MHG virus was isolated from rats and infected intestine, lung, and brain after experimental inoculation. A second type of cardiovirus genetically distinct from TMEV has been isolated from rats and designated rat cardiovirus (Ohsawa et al., 2003) . It does not appear to be pathogenic after experimental inoculation.\n\ncondition that resembles rotavirus-caused epidemic diarrhea of infant mice (EDIM) (Vonderfecht et al., 1984; IV.

The causative agent is an antigenically RISK-ASSESSMENT AND DECISION-MAKING distinct group B rotavirus that may be of human origin.\n\nInfected suckling rats develop clinical signs within a Contemporary biomedical research should use rats day or two after initial exposure. These include diarrhea free of adventitious viruses with the potential to cause for up to 1 week accompanied by cracking and bleeding illness or distort research results. Validation is based of the perineal region, dry, flaky skin, and transient growth retardation. Although rats of all ages are susceptible to infection, resistance to clinical disease develops at about 2 weeks of age. Gross lesions are limited to the gastrointestinal tract. The stomach usually contains milk. The ileum and colon may be distended with yellow-green fluid and gas. Histologic lesions are most prominent in the ileum and are characterized by enterocytic syncytia, which may contain intracytoplasmic inclusions, enterocytic necrosis, and attenuation of villi. Viral antigen and rotaviral particles may be found in affected enterocytes. Diagnosis rests on characteristic clinical and pathologic changes accompanied by detection of rotaviral antigens and/or particles. Serologic assays have not been developed. Differential diagnoses should include clinically apparent infection by pathogenic enterotropic bacteria. The signifi-primarily on the absence of antibodies to common viruses. Broad agreement among experts in the field regarding antigen panels, sampling protocols, and serologic methods has not yet materialized. Therefore, definitions of health status vary and must be established for each set of housing and husbandry conditions. This step is essential to protect the integrity of individual colonies, to reduce risks for spread of infection during transport or exchange of rats among laboratories, and to document the virologic status of rats in research grant applications and in scientific reports.\n\nMonitoring for viral infections should cover at least cance of IDIR pertains primarily to transient growth three venues: animals in established breeding and experiretardation and the possibility that it originated as a mental colonies, animals held in entry quarantine, and human infection, animal tissues and products destined for in vivo use.

Because reovirus Although sampling should utilize index animals, such as antigens are fairly widespread in nature, it is decidedly retired breeders, whenever possible, the most widely ROBERT O. JACOBY AND DIANE J. GAERTNER accepted approach to assess contemporary conditions in a colony is serologic monitoring of strategically placed and exposed sentinels. Sentinels must be immunocompetent, virus-antibody free, and protected from exposure to infectious agents during shipment. The number of sentinels used should reflect assessment of risks to a colony, as illustrated in Chapter 16. Cages of sentinels should be placed, by rack and room, to facilitate controlled exposure to potential sources of infection. One popular configuration for rats housed in conventional wire-top caging is to place sentinels on the lowest shelf of a rack to maximize natural exposure to bedding expelled from overlying cages. Additionally, samples of soiled bedding collected during routine cage changing (e.g., weekly) can be placed in sentinel cages to increase the sensitivity of detection. This strategy also helps to compensate for the use of isolation and individually ventilated caging, which limits airborne transmission of viral agents and by doing so, also may inhibit early detection of infection. However, limited durability of excreted virus in soiled bedding and the potential that small amounts of virus could be diluted to nonimmunogenic levels in pooled bedding samples also must be considered. Targeted selection of soiled bedding samples also can be helpful to trace infection to a sector of a suspect rack or shelf. For this procedure to work satisfactorily, cage positions should not be changed during the testing interval. Sampling intervals for sentinel rats generally range from 30 to 90 days, but, minimally, must be long enough to complete desired exposure and allow opportunity for seroconversion, which typically occurs by 2 weeks after an immunogenic exposure. Sentinel animals can be sampled repeatedly if they remain seronegative, but should be replaced if they develop antibodies. As a general rule, sentinels, regardless of serologic status, should be replaced every 6 to 12 months to permit incremental assessment, such as histopathology.\n\nMolecular techniques can be used selectively to confirm serologic results. For example, PCR testing of excreta, soiled bedding, equipment, or surfaces can be used in lieu of virus isolation to help determine if infection initially detected by serology is currently active. Additionally, there is preliminary evidence from studies with mouse coronavirus that PCR sampling of exhaust air manifolds can provide a rapid, \"realtime\" overview of infection among individually ventilated cage racks (SR Compton, personal communication); however, it remains to be seen whether this technology is applicable to viruses of rats.\n\nSampling of quarantined arrivals, which is likely to increase with the wider use and exchange of genetically altered rats, should be based on the same sampling principles outlined above. Depending on source, age, gender, animal number and behavioral considerations, sentinel exposures can use soiled bedding or direct placement with index animals. Because cohorts of imported rats are generally small, sentinel exposure for 30 days should be adequate to elicit potential seroconversion. Sampling of animal products destined for in vivo use, such as transplantable tumors or blood products, is essential for a sound monitoring program. It also is important, in this regard, to counsel investigators about the hazards of introducing untested biological products into rats. Aliquots can be tested by inoculation of susceptible cell lines or by molecular methods. The aforementioned RAP test, although apparently sensitive, tends to be costly, time consuming, and likely to be replaced by molecular methods.\n\nBecause viral infections of rats can spread insidiously, early detection and epidemiologic \"staging\" should employ a detection matrix that includes clinical observation, appropriate sampling, and sensitive and specific diagnostic testing. The value of serology to detect infection and determine prevalence and incidence is obvious. As noted in previous sections of this chapter, sensitive and specific tests are available for the most common viruses of laboratory rats. We re-emphasize, however, that the number of test animals should be large enough and the duration of exposure long enough to maximize the likelihood of detecting infection in a room or colony. Further, the clinician/pathologist should have high confidence that the testing laboratory has the testing conditions and expertise to produce incontrovertible results.\n\nClinical signs are helpful if they are comparatively specific, such as the cervical and ocular manifestations of coronavirus infection. However, non-specific signs, such as inappetence, altered reproduction, problematic anesthesia, distorted immunity, also may signal underlying viral infection.\n\nExposed rats, and especially those with clinical morbidity, should be subjected to pathologic examination, beginning with a thorough necropsy and including proper preservation of tissues for histopathology, collection of serum for antibody testing, and selection of tissues for potential molecular and/or virologic analysis. Tissue selection and preservation should be guided by a differential diagnosis emerging from clinical and gross pathology examinations complemented by a sound working knowledge of viral infections of rats. Such knowledge should account for the possibility that signs and gross lesions will be absent. Table 12 -1 summarizes current recommendations for tissue collection, preservation, and examination. As noted earlier, aldehyde fixation followed by embedding in paraffin wax is generally suitable for routine histopathology. However, we recommend fixation for approximately 16 hours in freshly prepared paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (McClean and Nakane, 1974) if immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization are contemplated, because it provides improved 12. VIRAL DISEASE 447 stabilization of viral antigens and nucleic acids. We also recommend freezing selected tissues at -60 ~ C. These samples can be used for virus isolation, molecular testing, or antibody production testing, as initial results warrant. Careful attention to minimize contamination during collection of such samples is critical, especially if the option for PCR testing is to be preserved. It also is prudent to complement examinations for potential viral infection with other microbiological testing to assess the possibility for dual infections or emergence of opportunistic bacterial infections secondary to viral infection.\n\nIf evidence of viral infection is obtained, the decision to take corrective action should be based on several key questions: Is the infection a threat to animal or human health? Is the infection a threat to research at the affected or collaborating sites? What are the options for control and elimination? Are the options epidemiologically effective, minimally disruptive to research, and fiscally sound? What are the options to prevent reinfection? These questions are best addressed through a thorough understanding of the biology and pathobiology of the offending agent and the functional and structural characteristics of the affected vivarium. Characteristics such as mode of spread, environmental stability, duration, and virulence in immunocompetent compared with immunodeficient hosts and known effects on research can lead to well-established actions for containment and elimination that have been illustrated for specific agents in this chapter. Further, working knowledge of viral infections can facilitate extrapolation of what is known to what may be conjectural due to lack of specific data. For example, the predilection of parvoviruses for mitotically active cells should be a generic factor in considering the potential impact of parvovirus infection on research. However, decision-making is likely to become more problematic as the use of genetically altered rats increases. Rats with either targeted or serendipitous alterations in resistance to infection may have correspondingly altered responses to viral infections. This potential is illustrated by cryptic immunodeficiencies in laboratory mice that can occur as unintended sequelae of genetic manipulation. Therefore, it will be important to consider phenotype as integral to risk assessment, and to broaden clinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic conception of the \"textbook\" spectra of infection."}
