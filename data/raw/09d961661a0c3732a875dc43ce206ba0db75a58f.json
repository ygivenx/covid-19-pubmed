{"title": "Synthesis of glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethyl ketone group as SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors", "body": "In May 2003, two groups reported that a novel coronavirus (CoV) was the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 1, 2 CoV encodes a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) that plays a pivotal role in the replication of the virus. 3 3CL pro is functionally analogous to the main picornavirus protease 3C pro and both are cysteine proteases with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) in the active site, with Cys as the nucleophile and His as the general base. 4, 5 Although a global SARS crisis was avoided in 2003 and the infection was contained, it is still a matter of necessity to find compounds that can inhibit SARS-CoV in case that the disease might re-emerge.\n\nCompounds containing a trifluoromethyl ketone (CF 3ketone) moiety form an important group of biologically useful fluorinated molecules 6 that can be used as protease inhibitors, as first described by Abeles et al. 7 The CF 3 group next to the carbonyl group thermodynamically stabilizes the hemi-ketal form relative to the ketone form, thus making the carbonyl prone to nucleophilic substitution by water, the active site Ser hydroxyl or Cys thiol group present in serine or cysteine proteases. Nucleophilic attack by the active site thiol in SARS-CoV 3CL pro would convert the CF 3 -ketone A to the tetrahedral adduct B (Scheme 1), which is believed to mimic the substrate-enzyme intermediate formed during substrate peptide-bond hydrolysis. Since adduct B is relatively stable, compound A would behave as a protease inhibitor, 8 suggesting that compounds containing a CF 3 -ketone moiety may play an important role as 3CL pro inhibitors. CF 3 -ketone A also forms a relatively stable hydrate adduct C upon reacting with water. A unique and conservative recognition of the substrate's Gln residue at the P 1 site has been identified in the CoV cysteine protease family. 9 Therefore, a Gln-derived CF 3 -ketone residue would contribute to the activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Based on these considerations, a new synthetic method for forming Gln and Glu derivatives possessing a CF 3 -ketone moiety was developed and this strategy was used in the synthesis of four peptides (compounds [1] [2] [3] [4] Keywords: Trifluoromethyl ketone; Protease inhibitors; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV 3CL pro ).\n\nThe target compounds were envisioned being synthesized in two parts, viz, the peptide part and b-amino alcohol 11 containing the CF 3 unit. These two parts would then be coupled together and further elaborated to the desired target compounds. The synthesis of the key compound 11 started with oxazolidinone acid 6 prepared from Cbz-L-Glu-OH (5) under conditions described by Moore et al. 10 The resulting acid 6 was then converted to tert-butyl ester 7 (45%) that was expediently converted to silyl ether 8 (92% yield) (Scheme 2), which was isolated as a single diastereomer as determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR analyses, by utilizing a literature method. 11, 12 The depicted stereochemistry for compound 8 is based on literature precedence for a very similar compound in which the addition of the CF 3 anion is anti to the side chain. 11 Product 8 was then readily desilylated upon treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) giving alcohol 9 in 77% yield. We observed that compound 8 was partly converted to the desilylated product 9 when exposed to air. The cause of the partial protio-desilylation might be due to the moisture-sensitive nature of compound 8. In the patent literature, there is one report of desilylation occurring upon stirring similar compounds in methanol, 13 most likely caused by water present in the methanol. For our substrate, we found that this method only proceeded when the reaction was carried out on a small scale (20 mg or less). However, by adding water to the methanol [methanol/water (9:1 v/v)], substrate 8 could be fully converted to compound 9 after 3 h stirring at room temperature (Scheme 2).\n\nCompound 7 was also converted to the corresponding alcohol 9 (72% yield) in a one-pot reaction by adding small amount of water to the reaction mixture of intermediate 8 followed by sonication for an additional half hour. Finally, the desired alcohol 10 was obtained by treating compound 9 with NaBH 4 in methanol at room temperature. This gave target compound 10 as a ca. 4.5:1 mixture of diastereomers, as determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR analyses, in 69% yield. Among the different synthetic routes tried, treating a methanol solution of silyl ether 8 with NaBH 4 seems to be an efficient route to synthesize alcohol 10. Under these conditions, we obtained the desired compound 10 in 68% yield (Scheme 2). Finally, the protecting group within substrate 10 could be easily cleaved off by hydrogenation over Pd/C (10%) affording alcohol 11 in quantitative yield. Coupling of peptide 12 with b-amino alcohol 11 gave the expected amide (Scheme 4) that was used directly in the next step affording ketone 16. Peptides 14 and 15 were subjected to the exactly same reaction sequences giving ketones 17 and 18. Treating compound 16 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) resulted in clean removal of the tert-butyl group forming tripeptide 1. Examination of the 13 C NMR spectrum did reveal that inhibitor 1 exists predominantly as the hydrate form in CDCl 3 (containing one drop of DMSO-d 6 ). 19 F NMR analysis of the same sample not only showed that the hydrate form was the dominant tautomer in the sample but that the two other possible tautomeric forms of tripeptide 1 were also present in small amount. 17 The equilibrium between the different tautomeric forms of this compound might shift depending on solvent. Due to the small amount of compound available, it was decided to study this in more detail by using a simpler model compound (vide infra).\n\nCompounds 17 and 18 were subjected to the exactly same reaction conditions as ester 16 affording peptides 19 and 20.\n\nThe remaining crude tripeptide 1 and peptides 19 and 20 were subjected directly to the coupling conditions outlined in Scheme 4 (Method A), thus giving products 2-4 in 8, 5, and 4% yield over the four steps, respectively, after HPLC purification. The low chemical yield for the target compounds is a result of the last reaction sequence that seems to be very inefficient giving rise to many side products. In an effort to improve the yield for the last step, compound 4 was prepared by a mixed anhydride strategy using a slightly modified literature procedure (Method B). 18 By such means, we were able to improve the overall yield of inhibitor 4, from peptide 14, from 4 to 12%. 19 F NMR studies of the three glutamine peptides showed that compounds 2 and 4 only existed in the cyclic form while tripeptide 3 was a ca. 3.3:1 mixture of the cyclic and keto forms in CDCl 3 . 19 Recently, similar observations were reported for glutamine fluoromethyl ketones by Cai et al. 20 Previously, there have also been reports that glutaminal compounds mostly exist as the hemiaminal in organic solvent. 21,22\n\nAs previously noted, target peptide 1 was predominantly present in the hydrate form in CDCl 3 . However, as alluded to in the previous section, this might differ depending on the solvent used for the NMR studies. Therefore, we decided to synthesize acid 22, which is a much simpler molecule than the real system but, nevertheless, thought to be a good model for this study. To this end, alcohol 10 was converted to ketone 21 in 81% yield and as a ca. 2:1 mixture of the keto and hydrate forms as evident from 19 F and 13 C NMR analyses (Scheme 5). Attempts to convert compound 21 to the free acid 22 only resulted in the formation of decomposition products.\n\nThe lack of stability for our desired model compound forced us to use a slightly more complex acid for these studies. Compound 25 was synthesized in a three-step process, as outlined in Scheme 5, by first coupling Cbz-L-Ala-OH with amine 11. This gave the desired alcohol 23, which was directly oxidized to ketone 24 (52% yield over the two steps). From the 13 C and 19 F NMR analyses of this ketone, it became evident that the ketone exists as a ca. 7:3 mixture of the hydrate and keto forms. The rather unstable ketone 24 was then deprotected giving dipeptide 25 in almost quantitative yield in ca. 90% purity as determined by HPLC analysis. The 13 C NMR spectrum suggested that compound 25 exists mostly as the cyclic hemiacetal in CDCl 3 (resonance shifts from >170 to 75 ppm). This was also the case when the 13 C NMR spectrum was obtained for the same sample in CD 3 OD.\n\nNMR studies of model compounds 21, 24, and 25 in the predominant keto, hydrate, and hemiacetal forms, respectively, supported our assignment of compound 1 as existing mainly in the hydrate form in CDCl 3 . This evidence was derived from the 19 F and 13 C NMR spectra of ketones 21 and 24 that were both present as a mixture of the keto and hydrate forms. 23 The work with the model compound also suggests that the form these acids appear in solution is highly solventand concentration-dependent.\n\nThe inhibitory activity of the target compounds against SARS-CoV 3CL pro was tested using a fluorescence-based peptide cleavage assay (Table 1) . 23 We originally thought that the glutamine peptides (compounds 2-4) would be the more potent inhibitors in these assays. However, the glutamate-possessing inhibitor 1 was the most potent of the group. The conformation that these compounds exist in during their interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro is believed to contribute to binding affinity. Cai and co-workers found that their Gln fluoromethyl ketones exhibited low activity in their assays, a fact which they explained by referring to that their inhibitors predominantly exist in the cyclic form as evident from NMR studies. 20 not expected to interact effectively with the active site of SARS-CoV. 20 The Gln compounds synthesized in our study were also found to be mainly in the cyclic form which may explain the low biological activity for these compounds. However, the Glu inhibitor 1 was found to mainly exist in the hydrate form, which is a form that most likely will interact more effectively with the active site.\n\nA simple five-step procedure for the synthesis of b-amino alcohol 11 containing a CF 3 group was developed. This alcohol was further elaborated into four tri-and tetra-Glu and Gln peptides. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to be moderate SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Current work is focused on the co-crystallization of compounds 1 and 4 with SARS-CoV 3CL pro in an attempt to elucidate their mode of action.\n\nMelting points were measured on a Yanagimoto micro hotstage apparatus and are uncorrected.

One-pot synthesis of compound 9 from compound 7. Method C: Cesium fluoride (37.9 mg, 0.25 mmol) and (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (0.31 mL, 2.02 mmol) were added to a solution of oxazolidinone 7 (427.0 mg, 1.72 mmol) in dry THF (9.0 mL) maintained under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then sonicated for 2 h at ambient temperature before water (0.30 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was sonicated for an additional 0.5 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with EtOAc (30 mL) and washed with water (1\u00c210 mL) and brine (1\u00c210 mL) before being dried (MgSO 4 ). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure gave the title alcohol 9 (520.8 mg, 72%), which was identical, in all respects, with the material obtained via the stepwise method.\n\n4.1.6. (4S)-tert-Butyl 4-(benzyloxycarbonyl)amino-6,6,6trifluoro-5-hydroxyhexanoate 10. Sodium borohydride (0.76 g, 20.09 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of alcohol 9 (1.09 g, 2.60 mmol) in THF (70 mL) under an atmosphere of argon. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 23 h before being quenched by addition of water (10 mL). The water phase was then extracted with EtOAc (3\u00c230 mL) and the combined organic fractions were dried (MgSO 4 ). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure gave a light-yellow oil, which was subjected to flash chromatography (silica, hexane/EtOAc 3:1 eluent). Concentration of the relevant fractions (R f 0.2) gave the title alcohol The reaction mixture was then allowed to heat to room temperature and stirred for 16 h before being concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting substrate was dissolved in EtOAc (40 mL) and washed with citric acid (2\u00c220 mL of a 5% aq solution) and brine (1\u00c220 mL) before being dried (Na 2 SO 4 ). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure gave a light-yellow solid, which was recrystallized from hexane/EtOAc to give the title protected peptide 14 27 and EDC$HCl (80.4 mg, 0.42 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of the relevant protected peptide (0.39 mmol) in DMF (6.0 mL) at 0 C. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 15 min before amine 11 (100.0 mg, 0.39 mmol) dissolved in DMF (6.0 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was then allowed to heat to room temperature and stirred for 21 h before DMF was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was diluted with EtOAc (30 mL) and washed with citric acid (2\u00c210 mL of a 5% aq solution), NaHCO 3 (2\u00c210 mL of a 5% aq solution), and brine (2\u00c210 mL) before being dried (Na 2 SO 4 ). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure gave the desired compound in quantitative yield. The crude product, which contained small amounts of impurities, was used in the next step without further purification. All products had satisfactory low-resolution mass spectra. Oxidation: Dess-Martin periodinane (439 mg, 1.04 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of the relevant peptide from the previous step in CH 2 Cl 2 (15.0 mL) at 0 C. The resulting reaction mixture was then allowed to heat to room temperature and stirred for 19 h before being filtered through a plug of Celite \u00d2 and washed afterwards with EtOAc (3\u00c215 mL). Concentration under reduced pressure gave the desired compound as a yellow oil. The material was used in the next step without further purification. All products had satisfactory low-resolution mass spectra. Deprotection: TFA (0.115 mL, 1.55 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of the relevant compound from the previous step in CH 2 Cl 2 (4.0 mL) at 0 C. The reaction mixture was then allowed to heat to room temperature and stirred for 16 h before being concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was used directly in the next step without further purification except for a small amount of the crude peptide 1, which was purified at this stage in order to provide a sample for biological assaying. The reaction mixture was then allowed to heat to room temperature and stirred for 16 h before DMF was removed under reduced pressure. The residue thus obtained was then dissolved in EtOAc (20 mL) and washed with citric acid (2\u00c210 mL of a 5% aq solution), NaHCO 3 (2\u00c210 mL of a 5% aq solution), and brine (2\u00c210 mL) before being dried (Na 2 SO 4 ). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure gave the crude product, which was purified by preparative HPLC. Concentration of the relevant fractions gave the desired compounds in the yields stated below. Dess-Martin periodinane (138.8 mg, 0.33 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of alcohol 23 (66.8 mg) in CH 2 Cl 2 (3.0 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 16 h before being diluted with EtOAc (10 mL) and filtered through a plug of Celite \u00d2 and washed with EtOAc (3\u00c210 mL). Concentration under reduced pressure gave a light-yellow oil, which was subjected to flash chromatography (silica, hexane/EtOAc/Et 3 N 50:49.8:0.2 eluent). Concentration of the relevant fractions (R f 0.2 in hexane/EtOAc 1:1) gave the title compound 24 (45.7 mg, 52% over the two steps) as a clear, colorless oil and as a ca. 7:3 mixture of the hydrate and keto forms (as judged by 1 H and 19 F NMR analyses) and both tautomers exist as a ca. 1:1 mixture of rotamers (as judged by 1 H, 13 25 . TFA (0.10 mL, 1.30 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of ester 24 (40.0 mg, 0.087 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (5 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 24 h before being concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound 25 (34.9 mg, crude yield 99%) as a yellow oil and ca. 90% pure (as judged by HPLC analysis) and as a ca. 6:2:1 mixture of cyclic, keto, and hydrate forms (as judged by 19 F NMR analysis) and the cyclic form existed as a ca. 1:1 mixture of rotamers (as judged by 19 2, 17.9 (signal due to CF 3 group carbon could not be discerned and one signal was obscured or overlapping); 19 F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl 3 ) d \u00c074.6 (2) (cyclic), \u00c074.6 (4) (cyclic), \u00c076.2 (keto), \u00c082.2 (1) (hydrate), \u00c082.2 (3) (hydrate), \u00c082.3 (0) (hydrate), \u00c082.3 (2) (hydrate). (The appearance of four signals for the hydrate form of this compound in 19 F NMR is probably due to partial racemization over time at the a position of this compound. The extent of racemization at the time 19 F NMR was measured was less than 5%. 28 ) MS (ESI\u00c0) m/z 403 (M\u00c0H, 46%), 222 (69), 199 (100).\n\nThe inhibitory assay was performed using a commercially available fluorogenic substrate Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans (Genesis Biotech, Taiwan) corresponding to the N-terminal autocleavage site of SARS 3CL pro . 29 The change in fluorescence intensity was monitored in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) with 355 and 538 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Kinetic measurements were performed at 25 C in buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM TCEP. The inhibition constant, K i , was determined by measuring the apparent kinetic parameters at a constant substrate concentration with varying inhibitor concentrations (0-1 mM). The protease (final concentration of 1 mM) was incubated with inhibitor for 10 min at room temperature and the reaction was initiated by adding the substrate (a volume corresponding to a final concentration of 5 mM in the reaction mixture). The dependence of activity on the inhibitor concentration was analyzed in a manner similar to what was reported earlier. 30 Briefly, the kinetic parameters were determined by global nonlinear regression analysis to the equation.\n\nwhere v I and v 0 are the rate of substrate cleavage in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively. V max is the maximal rate, [S] is the substrate concentration, [I] is the inhibitor concentration, and K m is the Michaelis constant. 31 "}
