{"title": "Identification of a novel compound targeting the nuclear export of influenza A virus nucleoprotein", "body": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important human viral pathogen that is responsible for periodic human pandemics as well as seasonal influenza, resulting in substantial human morbidity and mortality and a worldwide financial burden annually 1, 2, 3. Vaccines are currently available to control infections in humans. However, mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of circulating viruses easily escape the surveillance by the host immune system 4. Specific antiviral drugs are available for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatment for individuals infected with IAV. Two classes of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved anti\u2010influenza drugs are currently used in the treatment of IAV infections including NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir 5, and matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel inhibitors such as amantadine and rimantadine 6, 7. However, resistance development is a serious problem for antiviral drugs, particularly when the target viral proteins continuously undergo a high frequency of antigenic drift 8, 9, 10. Most human influenza viruses, including pandemic 2009 H1N1 and H7N9, are currently resistant to amantadine/rimantadine or oseltamivir 11, 12, 13, 14. Therefore, identification of novel antiviral targets and development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza virus infections are imperative.\n\nThe viral nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A virus has recently been identified as a target for development of antiviral drugs 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Influenza NP is the major component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex and abundantly expressed during infection with multiple functions 20. The vRNP complex utilizes the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within NP for nuclear import through the cellular importin\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2\u2010dependent nuclear import pathway 21, which is also supported by our previous report 22. During the late stage of infection, NP, nuclear export protein (NEP) and matrix protein (M1) mediate the transport of the newly assembled vRNP complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 21. Overall, NP has several conformations and activities that are conserved among all influenza A viruses and has no cellular equivalent 15. Thus, NP is an ideal target for the development of commercial anti\u2010influenza drugs.\n\nThis study aimed to identify new anti\u2010influenza compounds by high\u2010throughput screening of a library consisting of 20,000 compounds using a cell\u2010based infection assay. We identified compound ZBMD\u20101, which inhibited IAV replication and showed low cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo. It was shown that ZBMD\u20101 inhibits the viral polymerase activity of influenza viruses and the nuclear export of NP. Furthermore, docking analysis, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and co\u2010immunoprecipitation assay showed that ZBMD\u20101 binds to a small pocket structure on the NP molecule.\n\nThe chemical library of 20,000 structurally diverse small molecule compounds (Chemdiv) was purchased from J&K Chemical Company (Shanghai, China). ZBDM\u20101 (\u226595% purity) was synthesized by Institute of Medicinal Chemistry (SYSU) and stocked in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Oseltamivir phosphate (Os) was purchased from Selleck Company (Shanghai, China), and a stock solution was prepared in DMSO. Leptomycin B (LMB) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA) and dissolved in ethanol (EtOH). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and a stock solution was prepared in water.\n\nHuman lung carcinoma A549 cells, human embryonic kidney 293T cells and the Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco, Los Angeles, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n\nInfluenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus, A/Guangdong/1/2009 (H1N1) virus and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus were used. The A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, VR\u20101680). Virus stock was prepared as previously described 22.\n\nThe eight fragments of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus and the vRNP gene fragments of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus were synthesized by Invitrogen. All fragments from both H1N1pdm virus and A/PR/8/34 viruses were cloned into pHW2000 vector separately as previously described 22.\n\nThe C\u2010terminal HA\u2010tagged or FLAG\u2010tagged NP\u2010expressing plasmids, and mutant NP\u2010expressing plasmids were derived from influenza A/PR/8/34 virus and cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector separately. The antibodies used in our report included anti\u2010HA (mouse monoclonal, MBL, Japan), anti\u2010FLAG (rabbit polyclonal, MBL), anti\u2010GAPDH (rabbit polyclonal, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL, USA), anti\u2010NP (rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti\u2010Lamin B1 (rabbit polyclonal, Proteintech Group), anti\u2010CRM1 (mouse monoclonal, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and anti\u2010M1 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, Sino biological, China).\n\nThe influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus and A/Guangdong/1/2009 (H1N1) virus were rescued using an eight plasmid\u2010based reverse genetic system as described previously 22.\n\nMadin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded onto 96\u2010well plates and incubated with DMEM containing a synthesized library compounds using a Tecan Freedom EVO150 (Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Schweiz) at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM. Column 12 received only DMSO instead of any of the compounds. The cells were further infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus (H1N1) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005. At 48 hrs post\u2010infection (p.i.), the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent and an electron coupling reagent were added to each well as recommended by the manufacturer. After culturing for 2 hrs, the cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 490 nm. The screening assay was performed twice in the study.\n\nAnti\u2010influenza A virus activity of ZBMD\u20101 was tested according to the previous reports 15. The virus titres were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells as previously described 22. Briefly, cells were infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus at an MOI of 0.001. At 1 hr p.i., the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and 1 \u03bcg/ml of TPCK\u2010trypsin. Supernatants were collected at 48 hrs p.i. for measuring virus titres. The virus titres were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells. MDCK cells were seeded in 12\u2010well plates and used for infection when the cells were grown to 100% confluence. The MDCK cells were washed with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) once and infected with a series of dilutions of viruses for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. After the virus inocula were removed, the cells were washed with PBS, and then overlaid with agarose medium (DMEM containing 0.6% BSA, 2 \u03bcg/ml of TPCK\u2010trypsin, and 1% low\u2010melting\u2010point agarose [Sigma\u2010Aldrich]). The plates were settled at 4\u00b0C for 5\u201310 min. until the agarose medium became solid, followed by culture upside down at 37\u00b0C, and then the cells were cultured for 48\u201372 hrs. Visible plaques were counted, and the 50% inhibitory concentration was determined by counting the number of plaques.\n\nCell toxicity assay was determined by MTS assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described 23. The data are shown as means \u00b1standard deviation (S.D.) from three independent experiments.\n\nInfluenza A virus minigenome system was performed as previously described 22. The data are shown as means \u00b1 S.D. from three independent experiments.\n\nCells were lysed with ice\u2010cold lysis buffer for 30 min. at 4\u00b0C. The lysates were then collected and separated by SDS\u2010PAGE as previously described 22. The bands were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies and IRDye secondary antibodies (LI\u2010COR, Lincoln, NE, USA), and visualized on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI\u2010COR). The relative protein expression level was analysed using the software provided in the Odyssey system.\n\nHuman 293T cells were seeded at 6\u2010cm dishes and transfected with various plasmids as indicated. Cells were then untreated or treated with different amount of ZBMD\u20101 at 12 hrs p.t.. At 48 hrs p.t., cells were lysed with 450 \u03bcl of ice\u2010cold lysis buffer. About 10% (40 \u03bcl) of the lysates was taken as input control. The remaining lysates were incubated with anti\u2010HA agarose bead for 4 hrs at 4\u00b0C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 \u03bcl of ice\u2010cold lysis buffer, followed by Western blotting.\n\nImmunofluorescence assay (IFAs) were performed as previously described 22, 24, 25. Briefly, 293T cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X\u2010100, subsequently blocked with 5% BSA blocking solution and stained with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were stained with 4\u2032, 6\u2010diamidino\u20102\u2010phenylindole (DAPI) reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were obtained by a Leica laser scanning microscope using the Leica software (Wetzlar, Germany).\n\nHuman 293T cells transfected with NP\u2010HA\u2010expressing plasmid were untreated or treated with ZBMD\u20101. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS at 48 hrs p.t. Fractionation of cytoplasmic and nuclear components was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (PARIS, Millipore, MA, USA) as previously described 22, 26.\n\nThe cells transfected with AID\u2010GFP with different treatment were collected and fixed with formaldehyde and then analysed with the BD LSR Fortessa\u2122 cell analyzer according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD) as previously described 24, 27.\n\nThe crystal structure of influenza A virus nucleoprotein was downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 2IQH, resolution: 3.2 \u00c5). ZBMD\u20101 and NP binding was assessed using DOCK 6.7 28, 29. The ligand and receptor structures were constructed using UCSF Chimera 30. The DOCK6 program was then utilized to conduct semi\u2010flexible docking where 1000 different orientations were generated. Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were obtained between the ligand and the binding site, which were then used in calculating the Grid scores. We used a molecular visualization tool PyMOL 31 (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8, Schr\u00f6dinger, Seattle, USA) to generate the surfaces of NP to help spotting the binding sites of ZBMD\u20101 on the interfaces of NP.\n\nThe assays were performed using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) as previously described with some modification 23. A Biacore CM5 Sensor Chip and an amine coupling kit were purchased from GE Healthcare. The optimal pH for NP\u2010His immobilization (pH 4.0) was first determined. The CM5 censor chip was activated and then injected with NP\u2010His (300 mg/ml in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0) for 7 min. The residual activated groups on the surfaces were blocked by injecting ethanolamine HCl (1 M) for 7 min. Different amounts of ZBMD\u20101 were diluted with 1% DMSO and then injected for 30 min.\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by Ethics Committee of Zhongshan School of Medicine (ZSSOM) on Laboratory Animal Care and were carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines and regulations of Laboratory Animal Center of ZSSOM, SYSU, Guangzhou (China) (Assurance Number: 2016\u2010053). Mice in the study were provided via standard pellet feed and water. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia that was induced by isoflurane (RWD Life Science Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) treatment, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Mice were killed if rapid and lasting weight loss (loss of more than 25% of body weight in a few days) was observed.\n\nZBMD\u20101 was dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with corn oil (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. DMSO diluted with corn oil was taken as control. Male 6\u2010week\u2010old BALB/c mice (approximately 20 g) were used in our experiments. Mice were intranasally infected with ten 50% lethal doses (LD50) of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and then intraperitoneally injected with ZBMD\u20101 twice daily (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) for 5 days beginning at 6 hrs after infection, respectively. In the co\u2010administration experiment, mice were intraperitoneally co\u2010administered or given monotherapy with 10 mg/kg of ZBMD\u20101 and 0.2 mg/kg of oseltamivir phosphate twice daily for 5 days beginning at 6 hrs after infection, respectively. Eight mice per treatment group were tested. Body weight and survival rates of each group were measured daily. In parallel experiments, five mice in each group were killed on day 3 p.i., and their lungs were removed for determination of viral titres using the plaque assay. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Differences in body weight or lung viral titre between each group were compared from control using one\u2010way anova analysis, while survival rates were analysed by the log\u2010rank test. Data were considered significant at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.\n\nTotal RNA isolation and qRT\u2010PCR were performed as previously described 26. Specific primers for the target genes TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, CCL\u20102, CXCL1, IL\u20106 and GAPDH (as housekeeping control) of mice were designed using Primer 5.0 based on the corresponding gene sequences of the proteins. The primer sequences were as follows: IL\u20106\u2010F: 5\u2032\u2010CCCCAATTTCCAATGCTCTCC\u20103\u2032; IL\u20106\u2010R: 5\u2032\u2010CGCACTAGGTTTGCCGAGTA\u20103\u2032; IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010F: 5\u2032\u2010TCGCTCAGGGTCACAAGAA\u20103\u2032; IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010R: 5\u2032\u2010GTGCTGCCTAATGTCCCCTT\u20103\u2032; TNF\u03b1\u2010F: 5\u2032\u2010ATGGCTCAGGGTCCAACTCT\u20103\u2032; TNF\u03b1\u2010R: 5\u2032\u2010CGAGGCTCCAGTGAATTCGG\u20103\u2032; CCL2\u2010F: 5\u2032\u2010AACTGCATCTGCCCTAAGGT\u20103\u2032; CCL2\u2010R: 5\u2032\u2010AGGCATCACAGTCCGAGTCA\u20103\u2032; CXCL1\u2010F: 5\u2032\u2010ACTCAAGAATGGTCGCGAGG\u20103\u2032; CXCL1\u2010R: 5\u2032\u2010GTGCCATCAGAGCAGTCTGT\u20103\u2032; HA\u2010F: 5\u2032\u2010TATTTGGAGCCATTGCCGGT\u20103\u2032; HA\u2010R: 5\u2032\u2010GATCCGCTGCATAGCCTGAT\u20103\u2032. The data are shown as means \u00b1 S.D. from three independent experiments.\n\nHalf of the lung (or liver, spleen, kidney, heart) of each mouse was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and then stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis. Slides were randomized, read blindly and examined for tissue damage and inflammatory cellular infiltration. The lung pathology was scored in a range of 0\u20134 as previous report 32.\n\nData were analysed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (La Jolla, CA, USA). The two\u2010tailed Student's t\u2010test, one\u2010way anova and the log\u2010rank test were used to determine the significance of statistical data. Data were considered significant at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.\n\nTo discover novel anti\u2010influenza compounds, an MDCK cell\u2010based influenza A infection high\u2010throughput screening was performed. Briefly, a chemical library of 20,000 structurally diverse small molecule compounds (50 \u03bcM) was applied in our screening after MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.005 PFU). We then performed a dose\u2013response assay among the hit compounds and identified seven compounds that exerted an inhibitory effect by more than 50% at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Among the anti\u2010influenza hits, compound ZBMD\u20101 showed the highest potency against influenza A virus in a plaque reduction assay (PRA) on MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The chemical structure of compound ZBMD\u20101 was shown in Figure 1A. Using a plaque assay, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZBMD\u20101 against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in MDCK cells was lower than 2 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B). ZBMD\u20101 showed a similar level of antiviral activity against different IAV subtypes including A/Guangdong/1/2009 (H1N1) virus (IC50 = 1.14 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus (IC50 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcM) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, ZBMD\u20101 had low toxicity in MDCK, A549 and 293T cells. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the compound was >100 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B). Together, these results show that compound ZBMD\u20101 significantly inhibits the replication of IAVs.\n\nTo further confirm whether NP is a direct molecular target of ZBMD\u20101, we utilized the published crystal structure of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) NP from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for in silico docking studies. For unbiased predictive docking analysis, we searched for potential docking sites within the entire NP monomer. Five potential binding sites were identified (Fig. 5A). Based on the highest binding free energy, binding site 1 of ZBMD\u20101 within NP was selected for further analysis. The configuration with the best binding score (\u0394G of \u221248.37 kcal/mol) was also identified and used in further studies (Fig. 5B). Two amino acid residues (F338 and R267, hydrogen bond) play a major role in ZBMD\u20101 binding to NP (Fig. 5B). To further confirm the accuracy of this binding model, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiment was utilized to examine whether ZBMD\u20101 binds to wild\u2010type and mutant NP proteins harbouring alanine substitutions within potential binding sites (from R267 to 267A and F338 to 338A mutant). The SPR assay indicated that ZBMD\u20101 dose\u2010dependently bound to the wild\u2010type NP\u2010His or mutant NP\u2010His with Kd values of 10.6 or 131.6 \u03bcmol/l, respectively (Fig. 5C and D). Although ZBMD\u20101 remained bind to His\u2010tagged mutant NP protein, its binding affinity was significantly lower than that to wild\u2010type NP protein, thereby indicating that these two residues play critical roles in the interaction between ZBMD\u20101 and NP. These results suggest that ZBMD\u20101 binds to NP mainly through amino acid residues, R267 and F338, which were predicted by in silico docking analysis.\n\nZBMD\u20101 binds to the NES3 region of NP (aa 248\u2010274), which is involved in the nuclear export of NP 40, thereby indicating the mechanism underlying the nuclear export of NP. A previous study has shown that the nuclear export mediated by NES1 or NES2 is CRM1\u2010independent, whereas that by NES3 is CRM1\u2010dependent 40. To further investigate whether the inhibitory effect of ZBMD\u20101 on the nuclear export of NP depends on the CRM1 nuclear transport pathway, we examined the binding of endogenous CRM1 to NP in the presence or absence of ZBMD\u20101. The binding between NP and CRM1 was inhibited by ZBMD\u20101 in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 5E). This result indicates that ZBMD\u20101 inhibits the binding between NP and CRM1 through interacting with NES domain of NP.\n\nIn addition to the NP amino acids involved in NP\u2010CRM1 interactions, the docking model showed that ZBMD\u20101 partially bound to amino acids involving the NP dimer domain 41. To examine whether ZBMD\u20101 induces the dissociation of NP\u2010NP homo\u2010oligomer, we performed a co\u2010IP assay incorporating NP proteins that was fused to different tags as previous report 18. In the absence of ZBMD\u20101, NP\u2010FLAG was able to bind to the HA agarose beads that were coupled with NP\u2010HA (Fig. 5F). However, ZBMD\u20101 inhibited the binding of NP\u2010FLAG to NP\u2010HA in a dose\u2010dependent manner, suggesting that ZBMD\u20101 also inhibits the NP\u2010NP interaction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ZBMD\u20101 inhibits both the function of NES3 domain and oligomerization of NP, but not the NP\u2010RNA interaction.\n\nWe further tested the in vivo efficacy of ZBMD\u20101 against IAV infection. Mice were inoculated with 10 LD50 of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and intraperitoneally injected daily with different doses of ZBMD\u20101 (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg twice per day) for five days beginning at 6 hrs after infection, respectively (Fig. 6A). ZBMD\u20101 treatment apparently protected the mice from influenza\u2010induced morbidity and lethality (Fig. 6B and C). In a parallel experiment, mice were killed from each group at 3d p.i., and the lungs were isolated and used in the determination of virus titre by plaque assay (Fig. 6D and E). The virus load in lungs of ZBMD\u20101\u2010treated mice was significantly lower than that of control group. Moreover, ZBMD\u20101 and oseltamivir phosphate were co\u2010administrated to investigate the antiviral activity of ZBMD\u20101 treated together with oseltamivir phosphate. Although ZBMD\u20101 was less effectively protected the mice from influenza in vivo compared to that of oseltamivir phosphate, the co\u2010administration of ZBMD\u20101 and oseltamivir phosphate resulted in an even lower degree of weight loss and a higher survival rate (up to 75%) than those treated with ZBMD\u20101 or oseltamivir phosphate alone (Fig. 6F and G). These results further support the hypothesis that the mechanisms of ZBMD\u20101 and oseltamivir phosphate are highly variable and better in vivo effect is observed when administered in combination. Co\u2010administration of ZBMD\u20101 and oseltamivir phosphate also significantly reduced the viral load in lung (Fig. 6H). These results show that ZBMD\u20101 effectively protects mice from influenza infection in vivo.\n\nInfluenza virus infection causes severe lung pathology and is associated with acute lung inflammation, which is exacerbated partly through the host immune response to virus infection 42, 43, 44. A down\u2010regulation of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines/chemokines can impede influenza virus\u2010associated pathogenesis 45. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ZBMD\u20101 on influenza virus\u2010induced pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in vivo. Mice were mock infected or infected with 10 LD50 of A/PR/8/33(H1N1) virus, and then untreated or treated with ZBMD\u20101 (20 mg/kg twice daily). Mice were killed at 3 days p.i., and lungs of the mice were collected for total RNA extraction. The mRNA levels of cytokines that are involved in promoting inflammation and reported to play an important role during severe IAV infections in lungs 46, 47, 48 significantly decreased in ZBMD\u20101\u2010treated mice compared with untreated mice (Fig. 7A). However, treated ZBMD\u20101 in mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activation did not alter the expression of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, CXCL1 and CCL2 in lung, indicted that ZBMD\u20101 has no effect on the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines in the absence of infection (Fig. 7B). These results show that ZBMD\u20101 reduces the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines that are associated with influenza virus infection.\n\nIn a parallel experiment, lungs were collected at 3 or 5 days p.i., and stained with H&E for histological evaluation. ZBMD\u20101 treatment alleviated the inflammation and interstitial epithelium thickening that was induced by the IAV infection (Fig. 7C\u2010H). These observations imply that ZBMD\u20101 probably limits further spread of the virus in the lungs, thereby alleviating inflammation. In line with Figure 7, these results also indicate that ZBMD\u20101 inhibits the replication of IAV in vivo, which in turn alleviates the inflammatory levels and pathology induced by IAV. Our overall findings suggest that ZBMD\u20101 has potent anti\u2010inflammatory effects against the host intense immune response induced by IAV.\n\nIn the present study, we identified a novel compound, ZBMD\u20101, which efficiently inhibits the replication of influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo. ZBMD\u20101 efficiently protected cells against different subtypes of influenza A virus. In particular, ZBMD\u20101 was able to inhibit the replication of A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus with a relatively low concentration (IC50 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.09 nM) in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo data indicated that ZBMD\u20101 reduces the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and alleviates the infiltration of inflammation in lungs that is caused by IAV infection. It also increased the survival rate of mice and prevented body weight loss due to IAV infection. These results suggest that ZBMD\u20101 effectively inhibits IAV replication and reduces the viral titres in vitro and in vivo, which in turn further alleviates the pathology induced by IAV. These findings suggest that ZBMD\u20101 has potent anti\u2010inflammatory effects against the host intense immune response induced by IAV, thereby rendering it as a promising lead compound for the treatment of severe influenza.\n\nThe in vivo co\u2010administration of ZBMD\u20101 and oseltamivir phosphate augments the antiviral effect, suggesting that that ZBMD\u20101 inhibited viral replication via a new mechanism that differs from that of oseltamivir phosphate. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD\u20101 blocks the nuclear transport of vRNP complex from the nucleus through targeting the nuclear export of NP. Three NESs were identified within the NP. Export via NES1 and NES2 is independent on the CRM1 transport pathway, whereas export via NES3 is dependent on CRM1 binding 40. Therefore, the nuclear retention of NP that was induced by ZBDM\u20101 may be due to the disruption of the following pathways: (i) ZBMD\u20101 targets the NES1 or NES2 within NP; (ii) ZBMD\u20101 targets the NES3 within NP that further blocks the interaction between NP and CRM1; and (iii) ZBMD\u20101 targets the CRM1 or its associated proteins. To exclude that CRM1 is the direct target of ZBMD\u20101, we utilized an AID\u2010GFP\u2010expressing plasmid in our experiments because AID is a classic host protein that is transported from the nucleus and is mainly mediated by the CRM1 pathway 21. The distribution of AID\u2010GFP was not affected by ZBMD\u20101, whereas the classical small molecule inhibitor LMB blocked the nuclear export of AID. Therefore, ZBMD\u20101 did not directly inhibit the CRM1 transport pathway as LMB did. To further explore the particular binding sites of ZBMD\u20101 within NP, docking analysis that incorporated the structure of ZBMD\u20101 within NP was performed. This result showed that the potential binding site of ZBMD\u20101 within NP is a small pocket that included NES3. In line with the binding model, further investigation proved that ZBMD\u20101 directly binds to NP and disrupts the interaction between NP and CRM1. Moreover, the docking analysis and SPR assay indicated that aa F338 of NP was another important binding site for ZBMD\u20101. In line with these results, ZBMD\u20101 inhibited the NP\u2010NP interaction, which further reduced the polymerase activity and impaired the protein synthesis of IAV. Taken together, these results strongly support our theory that NP is the target of ZBMD\u20101.\n\nDrug resistance is a serious problem that has been associated with influenza treatment and is caused by high antigenic drift and shift rates. The discovery of new target has thus been the focus on the development of new anti\u2010influenza therapeutics. Sequence analysis has indicated that NP is a well\u2010conserved protein among different strains of IAV 15. Furthermore, the target sites of ZBMD\u20101 within the NP (R267 and F338) were highly conserved (>99% conservation) 15, thereby indicating that ZBMD\u20101 has a broadly inhibitory potency against various IAV strains, including the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes and the polymerase activity of H7N9 subtype. An alternative challenge for drug design and development is to avoid the occurrence of serious side effects. Influenza NP protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. The activity, assembly, stability and nuclear transport of vRNP complex all rely on the function of NP 1. Therefore, NP is a highly conserved and functionally restricted protein, thus rendering it a promising specific target for anti\u2010influenza drug design.\n\nNucleoprotein (NP) has recently considered as a novel target for anti\u2010influenza drug design 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Recently, a small compound, RK424, targeting a functional domain within NP has been identified 15. The pocket targeted by this compound was reported to be surrounded by three different domains, namely the RNA binding groove, the NP dimer interface and NES3. In the present study, the binding pocket of ZBMD\u20101 within NP in our study was similar to that of RK424. Based on similar function and different chemical structures, we concluded that the binding pocket of ZBMD\u20101 is an indispensable pocket of NP, which would be an ideal antiviral target sides. In our studies, ZBMD\u20101 was shown to inhibit IAV replication in vitro and in vivo efficiently. Because ZBMD\u20101 is one of the first\u2010generation hit compounds identified via high\u2010throughput screening, it could be further optimized to become more potent inhibitors.\n\nIn summary, a novel compound ZBMD\u20101 was identified with a high potency for inhibition of IAV replication in vitro and in vivo. ZBMD\u20101 disrupts the distribution of influenza NP protein in cells, as well as blocks the nuclear export of NP through impeding the binding between NP and CRM1. Meanwhile, the binding of ZBMD\u20101 affects NP dimer formation, implying that this compound is a multifunctional NP inhibitor. Thus, the findings of the present study suggest that ZBMD\u20101 is a promising anti\u2010influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.\n\nThe authors confirm that there is no conflict of interests."}
