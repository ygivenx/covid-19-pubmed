All manipulation of infectious samples took place in a BSL-3 orf7a luminal domain is extremely small, consisting of only 65 amino acids. For comparison, the average biological safety facility.

A significant number of viral accessory proteins have been found to be critical for the evasion of host-mediated immunity, interfering with diverse processes, including apoptosis, complement activation, cytokine signaling, and innate and adaptive immune surveillance (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Ploegh, 1998). While many of these proteins act at the plasma membrane or are secreted from infected cells, others have been found to operate within \n\nAt 48 hr postinfection, the cells were washed in 50 mM HEPES (pH expression vector pET-21a.
