{"title": "", "body": "Sir, Since a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province in China in December 2019, the number of cases has increased abruptly, with the infection spreading rapidly to other Chinese cities and to more than two dozen countries around the world [1] . As of 23 rd February 2020, 26 cases (16 imported and 10 indigenous) of COVID-19 had been diagnosed in Taiwan [2] . Notably, hospital-associated transmission of the COVID-19 to health-care workers and hospitalized patients has been reported [3] . Furthermore, Zou et al revealed that similar viral loads are seen in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, indicating the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients [4] . Herein, we report a patient who presented to an case is prohibited from entering the hospital, and is directed to the emergency department for isolation in a negatively pressurized room or an outdoor quarantine station ( Figure 1B) [6] . Failure to identification of COVID-19 cases in a timely fashion can paralyze a medical centre, disrupt public health systems and cause huge economic losses [7, 8] . Which interventions will eventually control this global COVID-19 outbreak is unclear, but sharing of experiences and measures to contain COVID-19 in hospitalS are paramount."}
