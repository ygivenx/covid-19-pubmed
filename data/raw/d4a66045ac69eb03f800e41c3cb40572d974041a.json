Many historical controversies similar to that surrounding the cause of Black Death have been resolved by modern science. Genetic analyses terminated the romantic ruminations about the escape of Anastasia Romanov, the daughter of the Russian tsar Nicholas II, and speculations about the survival of the son of Louis XVI in France. Challenging hypotheses with confirmatory or contradictory data is the normal process of science and I am waiting to see such data. Cooperation between archaeologists, dentists, and clinical microbiologists is needed. We are ready for blind tests on teeth from the Middle Ages in this matter. I believe that scientific investigation provides new evidence, not simply new speculations about weak data or ancient anecdotes found in a library. Of course contamination is always a critical question when using PCR. Anybody practising this technique can see that this question was central in our work. 1, 2 In the absence of new evidence, the result is unsubstantiated speculation that does not contribute seriously to the debate on the origins of Black Death. \n\nAs your recent editorial and news report describe, 1,2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has rapidly become a threat to international health and much still needs to be done to limit the spread of infection. SARS has already crossed the borders of 28 countries in five continents since the initial cases became known in late February, 2003, with the most recent cases (as of April 26) being detected in Bulgaria and Mongolia. According to recent WHO briefings, more SARS cases can be expected along the routes of international travel. The widespread international repercussions of similar outbreaks of respiratory disease, such as Spanish influenza (1918), Hong Kong influenza (1968), Russian influenza (1977), and avian influenza (1997), remind us that containing SARS and disrupting international transmission is vital to international public-health security.\n\nGu\u00e9na\u00ebl Rodier, director of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response at WHO, mentioned in a briefing that SARS can become a long-term threat in the developing world where the main burden of infectious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is located. At a time when vital aspects of the disease remain unknown the probability of SARS cases escaping surveillance is much higher in developing than in developed countries. Moreover, poor surveillance, protection against nosocomial infection, and quarantine facilities will add to the risk of SARS spreading in developing countries. Public awareness on the subject is still low and there might be transmission chains that have not yet been recognised and can lead to new local epidemics. All possible steps need to be taken to prevent the spread of SARS in countries with limited means of surveillance. In particularly, importation of goods, international travel, and movement of military troops need to be brought under strict scrutiny. A prevention policy needs to be formulated that is related to the health infrastructure and hospital infection-control capacities of developing countries. Before populations in developing countries are exposed to SARS, national response plans should be prepared that focus on improving coordination and communication between the medical and public health sectors and other agencies such as civil defence, animal health, the military, and the law enforcement community. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms need to be included in the surveillance network that can help contain diseases like SARS."}
