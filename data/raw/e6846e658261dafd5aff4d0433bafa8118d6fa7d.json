{"title": "Macrophage Coordination of the Interferon Lambda Immune Response", "body": "Lambda interferons (IFNL and IFN-\u03bb), also known as type III IFNs, are a family of cytokines comprising four members: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL28A), IFN-\u03bb3 (IL28B), and IFN-\u03bb4. While all IFN-\u03bbs signal through a unique IFNLR1:IL10R\u03b2 receptor complex, they activate a gene signature similar to type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 (1) . Both type I and III IFNs activate the transcription of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (1) that exhibit numerous autocrine and paracrine antiviral roles. Although IFNs are required to clear most viral infections, prolonged expression due to environmental or genetic factors can stimulate sustained immune activation, driving tissue damage, and fibrosis (2, 3) .\n\nElevated IFN-\u03bb3 production has demonstrated a strong association with IFNL genotype and hepatic inflammation, increasing the risk of both viral (HBV and HCV) and nonviral (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) related progressive liver inflammation and fibrosis (4) . Furthermore, these effects appear to be independent of IFN-\u03bb4 activity, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb3 may be a primary mediator of inflammation (5) . While the precise mechanisms remain uncertain, peripheral and hepatic immune cell populations vary according to the IFNL polymorphism in patients with chronic HCV infection, suggesting that IFN-\u03bbs can prompt immune cell migration to tissues (5, 6) .\n\nIFN-\u03bb activity is restricted to specific tissues due to selective IFNLR1 expression. In humans, epithelial cells within the lung, intestine and liver among others, are uniquely IFN-\u03bb sensitive. In particular, IFN-\u03bbs have been shown to protect against pulmonary influenza and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (7, 8) , gastrointestinal rotavirus and norovirus (9, 10) and hepatic HBV and HCV (11, 12) . While the majority of human studies have been performed in vitro, murine studies have shown potent antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bbs against numerous viruses including influenza and SARS coronavirus (13, 14) , rotavirus, norovirus, and reovirus (15) (16) (17) . It should be noted that IFNLR1 expression may differ between humans and mice, as exemplified in murine hepatocytes that do not respond to IFN-\u03bb (18) . Immune cells also demonstrate very restricted IFN-\u03bb responsiveness with myeloid immune cell populations harboring the strongest responses: Human dendritic cells (DC) and neutrophils are highly responsive to IFN-\u03bbs (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , whereas natural killer (NK) and T cells have consistently demonstrated minimal responsiveness (21, 24, 25) . Investigation of monocyte and B cell responsiveness has produced conflicting results (21, 24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) , perhaps confounded by studies utilizing co-culture models in the presence of IFN-\u03bb responsive cells (31) (32) (33) . As such, isolation of pure immune cell subsets is required to unequivocally define IFN-\u03bb sensitivity.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that human macrophages, not monocytes, are a dominant, physiologically relevant IFN\u03bb responsive population capable of orchestrating tissue inflammation. This is achieved through a direct immunostimulatory response to IFN-\u03bb and subsequent NK and T cell chemotaxis and activation. In vivo, macrophages are responsive to IFN-\u03bb3 and accumulate in inflamed human liver. These data suggest a novel role of macrophages as key players in modulating the IFN-\u03bb response in acute infection, as well as chronic disease.\n\nTo address the uncertainty surrounding monocyte and macrophage (M\u03c6) IFN-\u03bb-responsiveness, we measured mRNA expression of the IFN-\u03bb receptor, IFNLR1, in blood leukocytes by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). DdPCR enables the precise quantification of RNA transcripts by performing the PCR reaction within >10,000 oil droplets, and calculating transcript copies using Poisson's law of small numbers (34) . IFNLR1 expression in freshly isolated monocytes and in M\u03c6s cultured for 7 days with GM-CSF was compared to IFN-\u03bb responsive cells (pDCs) and \"unresponsive\" cells (NK and T cells). Similar to NK and T cells, monocytes expressed minimal IFNLR1 transcript. M\u03c6 and pDC IFNLR1 expression was significantly increased compared to other populations, suggesting IFN-\u03bb responsiveness ( Figure 1A) . Increased abundance of IFNLR1 was confirmed following monocyte to macrophage differentiation using seven datasets from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (35) (Figure S1 ). To assess IFNLR1 expression during differentiation, IFNLR1 expression was quantified over 24 h (qPCR, no differentiation stimulus) and 7 days (flow cytometry, GM-CSF differentiation) following monocyte plating. Expression of the IFNLR1 transcript was quickly increased as early as 16 h post-plating, reaching a 30-fold increase at 24 h ( Figure 1B) . IFNLR1 surface expression was significantly increased at day 3 (monocyte IFNLR1 MFI 927 vs. day 3 M\u03c6 3199) and further increased at day 7 (day 7 M\u03c6 IFNLR1 MFI 10,412) ( Figure 1C) .\n\nTo test monocyte and M\u03c6 responsiveness to IFN-\u03bb, cells isolated and cultured as in Figure 1A were treated with 100 ng/ml IFN-\u03bb3 for 8 h. This concentration is not a saturation dose, but is high enough to evoke a strong interferon response in M\u03c6s ( Figure S2 ). Consistent with increased IFNLR1 expression, M\u03c6 and pDC mRNA expression of viperin and ISG15 were markedly increased (Figure 1D) , whereas monocytes and NK cells demonstrated negligible responses.\n\nM\u03c6 differentiation medium containing IFN-\u03b3 and LPS or interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 are often used to generate pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) M\u03c6s, respectively, but do not reflect the spectrum of macrophage activation in vivo (36) . To avoid generating M\u03c6s whose IFN-\u03bb sensitivity is influenced by phenotype skewing, monocytes were differentiated for 7 days with GM-CSF or M-CSF alone, as previously described (37, 38) . The resulting M\u03c6 populations are differentially responsive to inflammatory stimuli, and are thus M1-or M2-shifted while maintaining some baseline characteristics of polarized M\u03c6s ( Figure S3) .When compared to monocyte derived DCs (MDDCs) generated using IL-4 and GM-CSF, the resulting M\u03c6s express elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, reduced CD1C, and unlike MDDCs, adhere strongly to culture dishes ( Figure S4 ). M1-and M2-shifted M\u03c6s will be termed GM-M\u03c6s and M-M\u03c6s for the remainder of the manuscript.\n\nIFN receptor expression and response to type I and III IFNs was examined in monocytes and M\u03c6s. M\u03c6 differentiation increases the abundance of the type I IFN receptor, IFNAR1 transcript (Figure 2A) , and protein ( Figure 2B ) \u223c2-fold as compared to monocytes irrespective of stimulus. IFNLR1 transcript abundance was increased in M-M\u03c6s and GM-M\u03c6s over 30-and 60-fold, respectively. The IFN-\u03bb co-receptor IL10RB was also measured, and was not significantly modulated following macrophage differentiation ( Figure S5 ). Consistent FIGURE 1 | Macrophages but not monocytes are highly IFN-\u03bb3 responsive. To investigate IFN-\u03bb responsiveness, immune cell subsets were magnetically isolated and IFNLR1 expression was quantified by ddPCR (A). M\u03c6 and pDC IFNLR1 expression was significantly higher than monocyte, NK and T cell populations (p < 0.05, n = 8). Time course analysis demonstrated that IFNLR1 expression quickly rises following monocyte plating, reaching a 30\u00d7 increase at 24 h even in the absence of GM-CSF addition (p < 0.001, n \u2265 5) (B). Similarly, IFNLR1 surface expression during macrophage differentiation (MFI) increased at days 3 and 7 (p < 0.001, n \u2265 5) (C). Isolated immune cell subsets were treated with 100 ng/ml IFN-\u03bb3 for 8 h and the expression of ISGs viperin and ISG15 were examined (n \u2265 7) (D). Consistent with IFNLR1 expression, M\u03c6s and pDCs were highly responsive to IFN-\u03bb3, whereas monocytes and NK cells were not (n \u2265 5). Data are representative of two (B,C) and three independent experiments (A,D). One-way ANOVA (A), Mann-Whitney test (B,D), paired t-test (C), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (mean \u00b1 SE).\n\nwith gene expression, IFNLR1 protein was absent in monocytes, and increased in GM-M\u03c6s compared to M-M\u03c6s. The IFNLR1 bands at 70 and 45 kDa represent the full length and soluble isoforms of IFNLR1, respectively (24) .\n\nTo confirm that elevated IFNLR1 expression confers response to IFN-\u03bbs, monocytes and M\u03c6s from three healthy subjects were treated with IFN-\u03bb3 for 15 min and STAT1 phosphorylation (Y701) was examined by Western blot. Monocytes did not phosphorylate STAT1 in response to IFN-\u03bb3, whereas both M-M\u03c6s and GM-M\u03c6s were highly sensitive ( Figure 2C ). All cells demonstrated no STAT1 phosphorylation pre-treatment ( Figure S6 ).\n\nM\u03c6s were subsequently treated with either interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) or IFN-\u03bb3 to determine whether cognate receptor expression defines sensitivity. Following 8 h of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb3, all measured ISGs were significantly increased by both IFNs (Figure 2D ). M-M\u03c6s were more sensitive to IFN-\u03b1, demonstrating stronger induction of all ISGs, particularly CD80 and TRAIL. In contrast, GM-M\u03c6s were more sensitive to IFN-\u03bb3, increasing the expression of both ISG15 and viperin compared to M-M\u03c6s. To confirm that macrophage differentiation and not treatment with M-or GM-CSF specifically induce IFNLR1 expression, monocytes were also differentiated using 10% autologous human serum from healthy individuals. Compared monocytes, human serum differentiated macrophages (HS-M\u03c6s) possess increased IFNLR1 transcript abundance and possessed similar IFN-\u03bb3 responsiveness as MDDCs and GM-M\u03c6s, both of which express high levels of IFNLR1 ( Figure S7 ).\n\nThe robust induction of IFNLR1 following monocyte plating suggests that monocytes quickly become IFN-\u03bb responsive upon differentiation and transmigration into tissues. Consequently, in the context of chronic antigen exposure, IFN-\u03bb expression at sites of inflammation will likely influence monocyte differentiation and subsequent M\u03c6 phenotype due to their prolonged exposure throughout the differentiation process. To test this hypothesis, we differentiated monocytes for 7 days with either M-CSF or GM-CSF alone (differentiation stimulus), or in combination with IFN-\u03bb3 (activation stimulus), followed by transcriptional and functional assessment of M\u03c6 phenotype ( Figure 3A) . FIGURE 2 | M-CSF and GM-CSF differentiated macrophages respond differently to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb3. Following M-and GM-CSF stimulated differentiation, IFN-\u03bb responsiveness of M\u03c6 populations was examined, and compared to IFN-\u03b1. M-CSF and GM-CSF M\u03c6 subsets both increased the expression of IFNAR1 \u223c2-fold following differentiation from monocytes, and IFNLR1 transcripts \u223c30-and 60-fold, respectively (A) (n \u2265 9). Western blot of IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 from four healthy subjects confirmed these findings (B) (n = 7, total). Supporting these findings, phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected by Western blot in both monocytes and macrophages following 15 min of IFN-\u03b1 treatment and macrophages only following IFN-\u03bb3 (C). ISG transcripts for ISG15, viperin, CD80, and TRAIL were examined to measure M\u03c6 sensitivity to IFN-\u03b1 (50 U/ml) and IFN-\u03bb3 (100 ng/ml) (D) (n = 8). M-CSF differentiated M\u03c6s were more responsive to IFN-\u03b1, whereas GM-CSF differentiated M\u03c6s, IFN-\u03bb3. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Paired t-test * /# p < 0.05, ** /## p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (mean \u00b1 SE). *Mock vs. IFN treatments, # M-M\u03c6 vs. GM-M\u03c6.\n\nRNA sequencing of M-M\u03c6s and GM-M\u03c6s from three donors was undertaken followed by paired analysis of transformed gene counts (Log 2) between untreated and IFN-\u03bb3 treated M\u03c6s (Tables S1, S2). The resulting smear plot demonstrates significantly up and down-regulated genes following differentiation of M-M\u03c6s (blue) and GM-M\u03c6s (red) with IFN-\u03bb3 ( Figure 3B ). GM-M\u03c6s were significantly more responsive to IFN-\u03bb3, up-regulating 463 genes \u22652-fold compared to 184 genes in M-M\u03c6s. Similarly, GM-M\u03c6s downregulated 467 genes \u22652-fold compared to 252 genes in M-M\u03c6s. IFN-\u03bb driven ISG induction was also collectively higher in GM-M\u03c6s as demonstrated by the heat map of gene expression LogFC ( Figure 3C ).\n\nFunctional analysis of data from M\u03c6s differentiated with IFN-\u03bb3 revealed numerous well defined ISGs (e.g., IFI27, MX1, and TLR3) and transcription factors (STAT and IRF gene families) responsible for ISG gene transcription ( Figure 3D ). In addition, a Th1 chemokine profile (CCL3, 4, and 5 and CXCL9, 10, and 11) responsible for CCR5 and CXCR3 mediated immune cell chemotaxis (39) was found in response to maturation with IFN-\u03bb3, with stronger induction in GM-M\u03c6s. Up-regulation of immune cell interaction and activation (CD80, CD86, and IL15) as well as antigen presentation [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I HLA genes] was also observed. Using transcriptomic markers of M1 and M2 M\u03c6 differentiation, IFN-\u03bb3 was found to induce the expression of the majority of M1, but not M2 markers, in both M and GM-differentiated M\u03c6s, supporting the movement toward an M1 phenotype (GM-CSF p < 0.001, M-CSF p < 0.05, Sign test null hypothesis of 0.5) ( Figure S8) .\n\nGene induction was confirmed by qPCR from a larger group of donors including individuals used for RNA sequencing data, and compared to the effects of IFN-\u03b1 differentiation. M-M\u03c6s were considerably more sensitive to IFN-\u03b1, whereas \n\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 3 | demonstrated that GM-CSF M\u03c6s were significantly more responsive to IFN-\u03bb3, as demonstrated by smear plot and Venn diagram of genes regulated above 2-fold (B). GM-CSF M\u03c6 ISG induction was significantly stronger, as demonstrated by heat map of gene log 2-fold change (logFC) (C). IFN-\u03bb3 increased transcript abundance of numerous ISGs and transcription factors (TFs) in both M\u03c6 sets, as well as numerous chemokines, cytokines, and genes responsible for antigen (Ag) presentation and co-stimulation, particularly in GM-CSF M\u03c6s (D). IFN-\u03bb3 stimulated genes were confirmed by qPCR, using IFN-\u03b1 differentiated M\u03c6s as a comparison (E) (n = 8). Quantitative PCR data are representative of three independent experiments. Paired t-test * /# p < 0.05, ** /## p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (mean \u00b1 SE). *Mock vs. IFN treatments, # M-M\u03c6 vs. GM-M\u03c6. GM-M\u03c6s responded strongly to IFN-\u03bb ( Figure 3E ). In addition to chemokines identified by RNA sequencing, inflammatory mediators including CCL2, IL1B, and TNF transcripts were increased by IFN-\u03bb in both M\u03c6 subsets. To assess the role of differentiation (M-vs. GM-CSF), interferon treatment (IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03bb3), and their subsequent interaction, a 2-way ANOVA was additionally performed. As expected, all ISGs measured were significantly affected by IFN treatment (p < 0.01), however only CD80 expression was influenced by differentiation (p < 0.01).\n\nIn agreement with RNA-Seq analysis, a significant interaction between IFN treatment and differentiation was observed for all measured genes (CXCL10, CCL8, IL15; p < 0.001, CD80; p < 0.01, TRAIL, TNF; p < 0.05) apart from IL1B and CCL2. Analysis using Metacore functional annotation software demonstrated that similar networks were activated by IFN-\u03bb3 in both M-M\u03c6s and GM-M\u03c6s ( Table 1) . Immune activation was considerably stronger in GM-M\u03c6s, with highly significant pvalues in networks such as antigen presentation and lymphocyte proliferation. Down-regulated gene networks were primarily associated with the cell cycle and protein translation (Table S3) .\n\nThis analysis is consistent with M\u03c6 BrdU assays, which demonstrated a reduction in BrdU incorporation following IFN\u03b1 (p < 0.05) and IFN-\u03bb3 (NS) treatment ( Figure S9 ).\n\nTo determine the extent at which M\u03c6s differentiated with IFN-\u03bb can drive immune cell migration, transwell migration assays were performed using autologous PBMCs. Following 24 h transwell incubation, migrated cells were removed from the lower chamber and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 4A ). IFN-\u03bb stimulated lymphocyte migration solely in GM-M\u03c6s by \u223c25% more than M-M\u03c6s ( Figure 4B) , with NK, T, and NKT cell populations being most affected. Separate measurement of GM-M\u03c6 media demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb3 stimulated a significant increase in CCL2 (1.8\u00d7), CCL3 (3\u00d7), CCL4 (2.75\u00d7), and CXCL10 secretion (\u223c5\u00d7), with minimal effect on M-M\u03c6s ( Figure 4C) .\n\nCo-culture experiments were next performed to assess the capacity of IFN-\u03bb matured M\u03c6s to stimulate NK cells in vitro. NK cells were incubated with M\u03c6s overnight, removed, and cocultured with K562 cells. K562 cells lack MHC class I expression, making them targets for NK cell killing. A significant increase in NK cell degranulation (CD107a), particularly within the CD56 dim population, was observed following co-culture with IFN-\u03bb3 treated GM-M\u03c6s ( Figure 4D ). NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production was also increased following co-culture with IFN-\u03bb3 treated GM-M\u03c6s, but significance was lost within subgroup analysis. Minimal effect on NK cell function was observed following M-M\u03c6 co-culture.\n\nTo examine the effect of IFN-\u03bb3 on M\u03c6 effector function that is not associated with an inflammatory phenotype, phagocytosis was examined by flow cytometry. Tissue resident M\u03c6s that demonstrate an M2 phenotype are highly phagocytic and efficient at presenting antigen (40) , a phenotype that can be replicated in vitro (41, 42) . UV induced apoptotic K562 cells stained with Zombie Yellow viability stain or DAPI labeled E. coli were incubated with M\u03c6s for 1 h at a ratio of 2:1 and 4:1, respectively. The ratio of double-fluorescent (phagocytic, CD14+) cells to mono-fluorescent (non-phagocytic, CD14+) cells, as measured by flow cytometry (Figure 5A ) was calculated to determine the phagocytic M\u03c6 percentage (Figure 5B ). Confocal microscopy was additionally used to confirm cell engulfment. IFN-\u03bb3 increased phagocytosis of K562 cells (30% increase) and E. coli bacteria (10% increase) in M-M\u03c6 alone. M\u03c6 MFI, indicating of the number of engulfed target cells, was consistent among populations when K562 cells were used as targets, likely reflecting \n\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org (Figure S10A ). IFN-\u03bb3 had minimal effect on the expression of most phagocytic receptors, but significantly increased key members of the complement cascade (C1S and C1R) ( Figure S10B) . These data suggest that activation of the complement system by IFN-\u03bb3 may stimulate M-M\u03c6s phagocytosis of both bacterial and apoptotic cells (43, 44) , however further functional analysis is required.\n\nTo quantify the ability of M\u03c6s to kill virus infected cells (cytotoxicity), M\u03c6s were co-cultured with HCV infected (JFH1 strain) Huh-7 cells for 24 h. Following incubation, Huh-7 cells were labeled with Epcam, Annexin V, and propidium iodide (PI) to quantify cells undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 5C) . Additionally, Huh-7 and JFH1 infected Huh-7 cultures were used as controls to confirm HCV mediated Huh-7 cell apoptosis, as previously described (45) . M-and GM-M\u03c6s differentiated with IFN-\u03bb3 stimulated an increase of early apoptotic (Annexin V+, PI \u2212 ) cells, by \u223c20 and 90%, respectively, compared to mock treated controls ( Figure 5D ). GM-M\u03c6s alone increased Annexin V+, PI+ cells, representing late apoptosis by \u223c20% following IFN-\u03bb3 treatment. The cytotoxic mechanism by which M\u03c6s killed infected cells has not been determined, but is likely mediated by soluble factors such as TRAIL that is highly inducible following IFN-\u03bb3 treatment in GM-M\u03c6s in particular ( Figure 5E ). Low expression of TRAIL in untreated M\u03c6s may explain the apparent lack of apoptosis following co-culture. In addition, no nitric oxide production by M-or GM-M\u03c6s was found in response to IFN-\u03bb3, bacterial or infected cell stimulus. To validate Huh-7 cell apoptosis results, qPCR for apoptosis markers Caspase 3 (Casp3), Caspase 7 (Casp7), and Bax were performed ( Figure S11) . Coculture with IFN-\u03bb3 differentiated GM-M\u03c6s increased Casp3 and 7 expression by \u223c6-fold in addition to increasing the antiviral response of Huh-7 cells as demonstrated by strong induction of ISGs viperin and ISG15.\n\nTo assess IFN-\u03bb production in vivo, we measured the expression of IFNL genes in liver biopsies of chronic HBV, HCV, and NAFLD/NASH patients and compared them to normal liver tissue from benign liver resections. IFNLs were increased in both viral (>10-fold IFNL1, IFNL2/3 HCV vs. healthy) and nonviral (e.g., \u223c2-fold IFNL1, IFNL2/3 NAFLD/NASH vs. healthy) liver disease (Figure 6A) , indicating that chronic inflammatory conditions can increase hepatic IFN-\u03bb expression to facilitate the generation of inflammatory macrophages in vivo.\n\nTo demonstrate the presence of IFN-\u03bb responsive M\u03c6s in vivo, we performed immunofluorescent labeling of liver tissue from a patient with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic HCV infection, and normal liver obtained from a cancer resection. Biopsies were labeled with IFNLR1 and CD68 or CD11b antibodies to identify IFN-\u03bb responsive liver M\u03c6s (Kupffer cells) or myeloid populations (monocytes/macrophages/neutrophils), respectively. As demonstrated in Figure 6B , all CD68+ and a fraction of CD11b+ cells were labeled with IFNLR1.\n\nImmuno-labeling was also performed using CD68 or CD11b in combination with CD3 to demonstrate immune cell proximity in inflamed tissue ( Figure S12 ). CD3+ T cells localized in proximity to CD68 M\u03c6s, supporting a role for M\u03c6 derived chemokines as mediators of immune cell trafficking.\n\nTo confirm that liver M\u03c6s are responsive to IFN-\u03bbs, CD68+ M\u03c6s were harvested from liver resection tissue by cell sorting (Figure 6C) , and treated with 100 ng/ml IFN-\u03bb3 ex vivo. Consistent with our in vitro findings, liver M\u03c6s highly express IFNLR1 compared to liver NK (CD3\u2212 and CD56+), NKT (CD3+ and CD56+), and T cells (CD3+ and CD56\u2212) ( Figure 6D ). In addition, M\u03c6 IFNLR1 MFI negatively correlated with blood white blood cell count (r = \u22120.678, p < 0.05) and positively correlated with hepatic T cell enrichment as a percentage of CD45 cells (r = 0.712, p < 0.05).\n\nTo compare IFN-\u03bb3 sensitivity, T cells and M\u03c6s from each individual were cultured for 10 h in media alone or with IFN-\u03bb3, followed by quantification of ISG expression. T cells were unresponsive to IFN-\u03bb3 as demonstrated by a lack of ISG15 and viperin induction ( Figure 6E) . Conversely, IFNLR1 expressing M\u03c6s were highly responsive to IFN-\u03bb3, increasing the abundance of both transcripts \u223c6-fold.\n\nThe cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IFN\u03bb modulates host responses to viral infections and tissue inflammation remains unclear. Here we undertook comprehensive functional characterization to demonstrate both in vitro and ex vivo, that macrophages are likely immune cell drivers of IFN-\u03bb mediated hepatic antiviral and inflammatory activities. Unlike monocytes, macrophages are highly sensitive to IFN-\u03bb through the induction of IFNLR1 Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 6 | infected liver tissue were labeled with monocyte/M\u03c6 markers CD11b and CD68 as well as IFNLR1 antibodies, and examined by confocal microscopy (B).\n\nTo assess the responsiveness of liver M\u03c6s to IFN-\u03bb3, immune cells were isolated from fresh liver tissue, sorted by FACS and cultured in the presence of IFN-\u03bb3. Live CD45+ immune cells were sorted based on the expression of CD3 and CD56 into NK and T cell subsets, and CD14 and CD68 into M\u03c6 subsets (C). IFNLR1 expression, as determined based on IFNLR1 MFI was compared among liver immune cell subsets, and was significantly higher in CD14+, CD68+ liver M\u03c6s, as compared to NK (CD56+), NKT (CD3+, CD56+), and T cells (CD3+, CD56\u2212) (D) (n = 6). Sorted T cells and M\u03c6s were cultured with 100 ng/ml IFN-\u03bb3 for 10 h and ISG mRNA expression was compared to mock treated cells (E) (n = 8). Scale bars represent 100 \u00b5m. Data are representative of one cell sorting experiment. Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 (mean \u00b1 SE). expression. As such, monocytes likely become IFN-\u03bb responsive upon movement into tissue and subsequent differentiation. Upon IFN-\u03bb stimulation, macrophages develop a robust immune-stimulatory gene signature, expressing hundreds of ISGs, cytokines, chemokines, and co-stimulatory molecules to stimulate both autocrine and paracrine immune cell activation (Figure 7) . IFN-\u03bbs are inducible cytokines that drastically increase in abundance upon viral infections, but can also effectively protect against bacterial and fungal insults (46, 47) . Activation of TLRs 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 (48, 49) can drive IFN-\u03bb expression, which is dependent factors including cell type and cellular environment. IFN-\u03bbs are necessary for epithelial barrier protection in the lungs, liver and gastrointestinal tract, however their dysregulation has been associated with a number of diseases that lack an obvious association with microbial infection. These include chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis (50) , systemic lupus erythematosus (51) , and asthma (52) . Consequently, it is important to understand the direct and indirect molecular mechanisms by which IFN-\u03bbs are induced, as well as the responding cellular identities.\n\nThe effectiveness of direct acting antiviral therapy for chronic HCV infection has ultimately overshadowed the antiviral role of IFN-\u03bbs in the liver, however there remains much to be understood regarding the immuno-stimulatory and potentially destructive roles of these unique cytokines. Recent evidence suggests that IFNL genotype influences IFN-\u03bb expression in the liver to facilitate immune cell migration and subsequent inflammation (4, 5) . Unlike IFN-\u03bb4 which is weakly secreted by hepatocytes (53, 54) , IFN-\u03bbs 1-3 are highly expressed, and can exert paracrine effects on surrounding immune cells. This is consistent with reports showing increased M\u03c6 activation in patients possessing the favorable IFNL genotype (55) . The importance of the M\u03c6 response is additionally underscored by the fact that M\u03c6 but not hepatocyte ISG expression is positively associated with both the favorable IFNL genotype that produces increased IFN-\u03bb3 and antiviral response (56, 57) .\n\nBoth PCR and RNA-Seq analysis support the IFN-\u03bb sensitive nature of GM-M\u03c6s and highlight the stimulatory role of IFN-\u03bb3. Increased expression of pattern recognition receptors [TLR3, IFIH1 [MDA5], DDX58 [RIG-I]] in response to IFN-\u03bb can increase antigen recognition, as we have shown in Figure 5 . Numerous pro-inflammatory transcription factors including STATs 1-3, IRFs 1, 7, and 9, AP-1, and NF\u03baB components were activated in response to IFN-\u03bb, as demonstrated by an enrichment of their respective target genes (Table S4) . Inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL1B that are known mediators of hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury were moderately, albeit significantly induced by IFN-\u03bb treatment alone (Figure 3E) , though our data supports additional inflammatory effects of IFN-\u03bb. By strengthening M\u03c6 recognition and response to pathogen associated molecular patterns, IFN-\u03bbs likely sensitize M\u03c6s to inflammatory stimuli, thus amplifying the strength and/or duration of the inflammatory cascade. This has been demonstrated by Liu et al. who showed that IFN-\u03bb1 can promote IL-12 production in TLR7 stimulated M\u03c6s (28) .\n\nIn response to IFN-\u03bb, GM-M\u03c6s potently express Th1 chemokines including CXCL 9, 10, and 11 as well as IL-15 and IL-27, notable drivers of T and NK cell activation and proliferation. In agreement with RNA-Seq gene expression data, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb3 treated GM-M\u03c6s stimulate T and NK cell chemotaxis and subsequent NK cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that IFN-\u03bbs are strong mediators of the Th1 response and provides a rationale for works by Morrow et al. who showed that IFN-\u03bb3 can increase IFN-\u03b3 secretion and degranulation despite T cell insensitivity to IFN-\u03bb (58). A similar phenotype has been observed in tumor model NK cells, where IFN-\u03bb signaling drives NK cell cytotoxicity, suppression of tumor growth and metastases (33, 59) . This Th1 skewing effect has been further validated using murine models of Th2 diseases where IFN-\u03bb alleviated symptoms of airway disease (60), intestinal inflammation (61), and conjunctivitis (62) .\n\nInterestingly, GM-M\u03c6s were significantly more responsive to IFN-\u03bb, whereas M-M\u03c6s where more responsive to IFN-\u03b1. These data suggest that while type I and type III IFNs induce a similar gene signature, their respective response is dependent not only on the cell type, but also, the inflammatory phenotype of the responsive cell. This data is consistent with work by Fleetwood et al. that demonstrate a strong dependence on type I IFN signaling in M-CSF over GM-CSF cultured M\u03c6s (37) . Consistent with an M2 phenotype (63), M-M\u03c6s were not particularly efficient at driving immune cell chemotaxis and activation upon IFN-\u03bb3 stimulation, but were significantly more phagocytic than GM-M\u03c6s both at baseline and in response to IFN-\u03bb3. These data suggest that IFN-\u03bbs are perhaps not inherently inflammatory, but instead promote macrophage effector functions based on location or developmental phenotype.\n\nOur data fills a current gap in knowledge concerning the cellular identities and mechanisms that regulate local IFN\u03bb mediated inflammation. Because IFN-\u03bb signaling is longer lasting and unlike IFN-\u03b1 does not become refractory following chronic exposure (64) , continuous IFN-\u03bb expression from chronic infections can drive prolonged immune activation. While DCs have a strong IFN-\u03bb response, they are a small population in the liver and migrate toward proximal lymph nodes in response to infection (65) . Liver M\u03c6s (Kupffer cells) on the other hand consist of the \u223c3/4 of hepatic immune cells, and remain locally to become crucial drivers of localized tissue inflammation (65) . Neutrophils are the only other immune cell subset with a defined IFN-\u03bb response, and respond with reduced migration and suppression of inflammation (22, 23, 66) .\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a novel concept whereby M\u03c6s gain IFN-\u03bb sensitivity quickly following differentiation from monocytes. These data support a pro-inflammatory role for IFN-\u03bbs, particularly via recruitment of NK and T cells, chief promoters of inflammation in chronic liver disease. M\u03c6s bridge the gap between IFN-\u03bb responsive and non-responsive effector cells, and are likely implicated in the elimination of acute infection and the promotion of tissue damage in chronic disease.\n\nBlood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers at the Westmead Institute of Medical Research. Data points represent individual donors from a cohort of \u223c20 healthy individuals. Different cohorts of donors were used for individual experiments based on availability. Liver tissue was obtained at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, at the time of needle biopsy [chronic HBV/HCV infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH, autoimmune hepatitis] or from patients undergoing liver resections (normal tissue). Ethics approval was obtained from the Sydney West Area Health Service and University of Sydney. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects [HREC2002/12/4.9(1564)].\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from volunteer blood using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). Immune cell isolations were performed using StemCell EasySep Kits, resulting in immune cell purity of >90%. CD14+ monocytes were cultured at 37 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 50 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, Peprotech) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, Peprotech) for 7 days, replacing media and removing non-adherent cells at day 4.

Protein bands were visualized on X-ray film using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies and the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Endogen).\n\nImmune cell chemotaxis assays were performed using 1 \u00d7 10 6 autologous PBMCs placed in 5 \u00b5M pore size transwell inserts. Assays were performed for 24 h at 37 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 . Migrated cells present in the lower chamber were removed by pipetting and characterized by flow cytometry. Zombie Aqua viability stain (BioLegend 423101) and antibodies directed toward CD19 (BioLegend, 302218), CD3 (BioLegend, 300424), CD56 (Becton Dickinson, 335791), and CD14 (Becton Dickinson, 563372) were used to identify immune cell populations. All samples examined by flow cytometry have been treated with Fc block (BD, 564219) prior to staining. ELISAs for CCL2 (R&D Systems, DY279), CCL3 (R&D Systems, DY270), CCL4 (R&D Systems, DY271), CXCL10 (BioLegend, 439904), and TRAIL (Abcam, ab46074) were performed according to the manufacturers' protocols.\n\nTo stimulate apoptosis, K562 cells were exposed to UV light for 15 min. Apoptotic K562 cells were stained with ZombieYellow viability stain (Biolegend), after which apoptosis was confirmed with >90% of cells staining positive. Culture media was removed from M\u03c6 cultures and target cells in RPMI + 10% FCS were added at a ratio of 2:1 (K562). Culture plates were centrifuged at 450 g for 2 min to synchronize phagocytosis. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 \u2022 C, cells were washed and labeled with BV711 mouse anti-human CD14 antibody (BD Biosciences), and analyzed using the BD Biosciences LSR Fortessa cell analyzer.\n\nHuh-7 cells were electroporated with JFH1 RNA, a genotype 2 strain of HCV as previously described (70) . Upon confirming >85% infection rate by HCV NS5A immunofluorescence, Huh-7 cells were plated in 48 well plates. Day 6 M\u03c6s were spun down onto Huh-7 cells at 400\u00d7 g for 5 min at a ratio of 2:1. Following 24 h incubation, macrophages were removed by pipetting, and Huh-7 cells detached using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich). Huh-7 cells were labeled with Annexin V (Becton Dickinson, 550474), Epcam (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091253) and propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich, P4864) in 1\u00d7 Annexin V binding buffer according to the manufacturers protocol. Cells were washed thoroughly, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on the BD Biosciences LSR II cell analyzer.\n\nFollowing 6 days of culture, freshly isolated autologous NK cells were added to M\u03c6s at a ratio of 1:1. Cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min and incubated for 16 h at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 . Following stimulation by M\u03c6s, NK cells were removed by pipetting, and incubated \u00b1 K562 cells (1:1 ratio) with an antibody against the degranulation marker CD107a (BD Biosciences 328620), GolgiStop and GolgiPlug transport inhibitor for 6 h at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 . NK cell degranulation and interferon gamma (BioLegend, 502509) production was examined by flow cytometry, identifying live NK cell populations using Zombie Aqua viability stain (BioLegend 423101), APC-CY7 CD19 (BioLegend, 302218), Alexafluor 700 CD3 (BioLegend, 300424), PE-CY7 CD56 (Becton Dickinson, 335791), and BUV395 CD16 (Becton Dickinson, 563785).\n\nFrozen biopsy tissue sections were fixed with acetone, blocked and labeled with primary antibodies against CD11b (Bio-Rad MCA74A488), CD68 (Abcam, AB955), and IFNLR1 (all 1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexafluor 488/594 anti-rabbit/mouse, Life Technologies, 1:1,000 dilution) and DAPI were applied for 1 h at room temperature, and imaged by confocal microscopy (Olympus FluoView FV1000). The IFNLR1 antibody was validated using siRNA knockdown of IFNLR1 on macrophage cultures, as well as gastrointestinal biopsy tissue to ensure specific labeling ( Figure S13 ).\n\nLiver tissue was diced and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C in a dissociation buffer consisting of RPMI medium containing 1 \u00b5g/ml DNAse, 0.1 mg/ml Collagenase type IV, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were filtered through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 50 g for 5 min to pellet hepatocytes (71) . The supernatant containing liver immune cells was washed, pelleted at 400 g and frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until a sufficient number of samples were obtained. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed using the Becton Dickinson Influx Cell Sorter using the following panel: Zombie Aqua viability stain (BioLegend, 423102), APC CD45 (BioLegend, 304012), BUV395 CD3 (Becton Dickinson, 563546), PE-CY7 CD56 (Becton Dickinson, 335791), BV711 CD14 (Becton Dickinson, 563372), Alexafluor 488 CD68 (BioLegend, 333812), and PE IFNLR1 (BioLegend, 337804). A cell sort purity of >90% was measured during sorting.\n\nStatistics were performed using GraphPad Prism and were chosen based on the normality of the data, with p < 0.05 deemed significant. Student t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests were performed on unpaired samples based on data normality. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test were performed on paired samples based on Gaussian distribution.\n\nRNA sequencing data has been uploaded into the Figshare data repository: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.10324511.v1.\n\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Sydney West Area Health Service.
