Many disease states are\ndifficult to diagnose due to the lack of specific and well-characterized biomarkers\nin an accessible specimen. These generalizations apply in particular to infectious\ndisease diagnostics. The clinical signs of infection are often non-specific (e.g.,\ninflammation or fever) and may originate from many possible sources, yet the\ntreatments are more often specific and require an accurate diagnosis to be\neffective. There are many infectious diseases endemic in LRS where the lack of\nsimple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to effective\ntreatment, in part because of co-morbidities that confound a differential diagnosis.\nThese diseases include malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), tuberculosis\n(TB), influenza, and many others.[1] Millions of lives are lost and a huge morbidity burden\nincurred through inadequate diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.[1] In many cases\nthe need for rapid diagnostics appropriate for these LRS is so severe that mediocre\nperformance tests such as RDT are preferred to less accessible but better performing\nNA tests.[2]\nClearly, any technology that can increase the practicality and availability of NA\nassays in LRS could have a significant impact on global public health.\n\nNucleic acid detection, to date, has mainly been confined to wealthy, developed\ncountries or to the large centralized facilities in the developing world that can\nmarshal the resources required to perform these techniques. Like many molecular\ndiagnostic assays, nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) typically require a\nsignificant investment in equipment, training, and infrastructure. Economic and\ninfrastructural realities dictate that diagnostics for the developing world need to\nbe foremost inexpensive; but also, accurate, reliable, rugged, and suited to the\ncontexts of these low-resource settings (LRS).[3]\u2013[5] Recent guidelines published by\nthe World Health Organization recommend that diagnostic devices for developing\ncountries should be ASSURED: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid\nand robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users.[6] In some diagnostic contexts in\nLRS, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) based on the immunochromatography strip (ICS) fit\nthe ASSURED model, albeit with limited sensitivity and specificity.[7]\u2013[9] NAAT assays that\nuse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification are capable of providing excellent\nsensitivity and specificity but generally fail to meet the ASSURED guidelines for\naffordability, rapidity and robustness, equipment-free operation, and\ndeliverability.[10], [11] Appropriate, low-cost, equipment-free, pathogen-specific\nNA marker assays that characterize medical care in much of the developing world\nremain unavailable in LRS.\n\nOne of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS\nhas been the complexity of PCR amplification. PCR is inherently impractical in LRS\nwhere reliable electrical power, complex equipment, training, reagent storage,\nquality programs and clean water, are intermittent or absent. [1], [12] Recently, there have been\nsignificant developments in a class of NAATs that do not require temperature\ncycling.[13]\u2013[16] A comprehensive review of these techniques, and their\napplication in LRS has recently been published. [17] These isothermal amplification\ntechniques vary in amplification temperature and duration, as well as complexity of\nreagents required\u2014and many are proprietary\u2014but all have the potential to\nbe simpler and require less complex equipment than PCR-based assays. These methods\nuse a variety of reaction principles to specifically amplify NA targets through\nisothermal melting, exponential amplification and intermediate target generation;\nand which, in several cases, can be detected directly without the need for an\ninstrument.[17]\u2013[20] Nevertheless, almost all investigators and manufacturers\ncurrently use some type of electrically powered equipment to achieve and maintain\nthe temperature required for amplification, although this equipment can be much\nsimpler than the typical PCR thermocycler. This inherent simplicity makes isothermal\namplification more appropriate for diagnostics in LRS.\n\nOne of the letters in the acronym ASSURED \u2014 the guideline for providing\ndiagnostics to LRS \u2014 represents \u201cequipment free.\u201d We are currently\ndeveloping a non-instrumented nucleic acid (NINA) platform that requires no\ndetection instrument, no electrical power, no batteries, and no external reagents.\nWe believe this can be achieved by combining isothermal amplification with a novel\nmethod for generating the required temperature profile without electrical power in a\nsimple disposable that contains the lyophilized assay reagents. Our first prototype\nof this platform uses loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) [21] as the model for an isothermal\namplification technique and malaria as a model diagnostic target. The amplification\nprotocol requires incubating the reaction mixture at \u223c65\u00b0C for at least 60\nminutes. This temperature requirement is sufficiently flexible that small excursions\n(+/\u22121.5\u00b0C) around this target are tolerable. [22]\u2013[26] LAMP (and several other\nisothermal techniques) have been shown to far less sensitive to inhibitors than PCR,\nto the point where direct assay of whole blood and other unpurified specimens is\nfeasible.[18],\n[19] In those\ncases, no power or instruments are required for NA purification, as is the case with\nPCR. In addition, recent advances in protein stabilization make it likely that the\nreagents can be dried-down in the reaction tubes with sufficient stability to avoid\nthe need for a cold-chain during delivery and storage. Thus, another power consuming\n\u201cinstrument\u201d is eliminated. We have not yet attempted to package all of\nthese features and advances into a single prototype device; however, the successful\ndemonstration of electricity-free temperature-controlled heating in a disposable\nformat reported here is an important first step toward the long-term goal.\n\nThe prototype NINA platform exploits exothermic chemical heating, as used in\n\u201cready-to-eat\u201d meals and camping hand warmers. Table S1\nsummarizes the prior history of prototype development. Hatano and coworkers recently\ndescribed a crude heater that was able to perform a qualitative LAMP assay for\nanthrax using off-the shelf pocket hand warmers and a Styrofoam box. [27] Dominguez et\nal. used a similar container with an unspecified phase change material to maintain a\nstable incubation temperature for a commercial interferon gamma release assay at 37C\n(although the heat source was conventional). [28] While these interesting\napproaches are compelling in their simplicity, the bulky apparatus displayed slow\nwarm-up (>30 min.); and for LAMP, significant temperature variation within\nincubation time, and a lack of run-to-run repeatability was observed. To meet the\nperformance goals implied in the ASSURED guidelines, an optimized heating unit\nshould be engineered to eliminate or minimize all sources of variation. When\ncombined with the temperature-moderating characteristics of engineered phase change\nmaterials (EPCM), we demonstrate that an engineered exothermal chemical heating unit\ncan produce a consistent constant-temperature incubator for isothermal NA\namplification suitable for a variety of isothermal techniques.\n\nTen replicate runs of the optimized prototype displayed minimal variation in\ntemperature from run to run within the reaction tubes (Figure 1). The heater reached the optimal\nincubation temperature in 15 minutes, and maintained the target temperature with\nminimal drift over 60 minutes. (Drift from minimum to maximum temperature within\nrun, mean over all runs  = 2\u00b0C.) Comparison of the\ntemperature plots for the CaO, EPCM, and reaction tubes in Figure 1 to Figure 1B in Hatano et al.[27] illustrates\nthe beneficial effect of having the EPCM component in the heater. The CaO\ntemperature traces show rapid and poorly controlled heat generation, with\nmaximum temperatures exceeding 100\u00b0C. The traces of the EPCM at the\ninterface with the CaO have a pattern similar to the CaO, but the initial\ntemperature excursions are reduced in magnitude, and the plots are far more\nrepeatable. Finally, the reaction tubes display only a uniform ramping to the\ntarget temperature followed by a prolonged stable isothermal phase. The\ntemperature in the NINA reaction appears more uniform than that shown by Hatano\net al.[27] for\ntheir hand-warmer device.\n\nThese results evince the potential of EPCM in an optimized design for controlling\nexothermic reactions in a simple NINA. This level of temperature control is\nimportant to enable conformance to the \u201csensitive\u201d,\n\u201cspecific\u201d, and \u201crobust\u201d aspects of the ASSURED\nguidelines. Once the abundant heat from the CaO reaction begins to melt the\nEPCM, the additional heat produced by the exothermic reaction is converted into\nthe latent heat of fusion of the EPCM. Thus, the temperature in the EPCM remains\nconstant at the selected melting temperature until the solid to liquid\ntransition is complete (provided heat transfer within the EPCM is rapid). Once\nthe CaO reaction has reached equilibrium, the energy stored as latent heat keeps\nthe two-phase EPCM at the target temperature until complete solidification.\n\nIn our optimization work we observed that the purity of the CaO need not be high,\nalthough it should be consistent to yield consistent heat profiles (data not\nshown). The ability to use less pure CaO is important for minimizing the cost\nper amplification, addressing the \u201caffordable\u201d aspect of the ASSURED\nguidelines. Other key physicochemical parameters of raw CaO (particle size,\nparticle porosity, presence of unoxidized calcium carbonate \u201cgrit\u201d,\netc.) that result from variation in kiln calcination of limestone[29] (the\nindustrial manufacturing process) also must be kept consistent for consistent\nheat profiles. However, we were able to produce precise heat profiles in our\nprototypes with commodity grades of CaO. This makes the only disposable\nmaterials (CaO, water, and PCR tubes) in the device very inexpensive. The\nreaction of CaO and water can be tuned somewhat to control the steepness of the\ntemperature ramp and the maximum temperature for a given reaction chamber,\nalthough flexibility and precision is greatly improved by including the\nEPCM.\n\nThe EPCM used here is tunable for many of its important characteristics (melting\ntemperature range, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, etc.) making\nthis device a flexible incubation platform potentially applicable to a number of\nisothermal amplification techniques. When evaluated by differential scanning\ncalorimetry, the EPCM melts over a range of temperatures around the target\n(\u00b12\u00b0C), and displays some hysteresis in the phase change, presumably\ndue to polydispersity in polymer chain length and supercooling of the EPCM\n(personal communication from Renewable Alternatives). It is unclear at this time\nhow this behavior contributes to variation seen in the results of the LAMP\nassay; however, the manufacturer of the EPCM is confident that further\ndevelopment of the EPCM for this application will mitigate this behavior. The\nEPCM is a fully hydrogenated fat product, so it is resistant to environmental\noxidation and should be very stable. While the EPCM is not currently as readily\navailable as CaO, and is not a commodity product like CaO, similar materials\nhave been used in consumer products in the US. These EPCMs are made mainly from\nbio-based fats \u2014 namely beef tallow, palm oil, coconut oil and soybean oil\n\u2014 so local, low-cost production of the EPCM in the developing world should\nbe feasible.\n\nPortable energy for heat production could, of course, be supplied with\nconventional batteries, so a comparison seems appropriate. A cost analysis\nindicates that on a per calorie per test basis, using CaO as a thermal battery\nis several times less expensive than mass-produced, disposable, dry-cell\nbatteries. Costs are scaled by the projected number of analytical runs possible\nand include both energy source and control hardware. CaO disposables are single\nuse, while dry cells are expected to last five runs based on their energy\ndensity (four D-cells would be required). Two grades of CaO (reagent grade and\nsoap grade), with an EPCM are compared to three possible dry-cell\nimplementations (with an EPCM, with microprocessor closed-loop control, with\nthermostat closed-loop control). With a projected cost per run of\nUS$0.56, the soap-grade CaO/EPCM combination is clearly the\nleast-expensive alternative (compared to $1.40, $1.17,\n$1.21, and $1.16 for reagent-grade CaO/EPCM, D-cell/EPCM,\nD-cell/microprocessor, and D-cell/thermostat, respectively.) Costs were\nestimated from MSRP. Increased value of CaO over the alternatives could be\nrealized at increased production volumes. Any special disposal or recycling\nrequired does not seem any more onerous than what is required for common\nbatteries.\n\nThe data shown here were not gathered under any stringent external environmental\ncontrol; therefore, given that testing was performed in an air-conditioned\nlaboratory, it is likely that the system was not challenged in the same way as\nit would be at its intended point of use. The wide external temperature ranges\nfound in LRS could significantly change the ramp time and/or duration at the\ndesired temperature of the heater, possibly significantly, but the\ncharacteristics of the EPCM will ensure that the desired temperature is held for\nsome period of time, regardless \u2013 without calibration to the\nambient conditions or closed-loop control. First principles of heat\ntransfer dictate that the effects of ambient on ramp time and/or duration should\nbe greatest when the desired temperature is furthest from ambient. Thus, the\nproblem should be appropriately non-dimensionalized to identify states of\nsimilitude. We plan to explore these phenomena and to evaluate their effects\nonce we have improved our understanding of the intrinsic variation in the assay\nchemistry sufficiently to evaluate those effects. This evaluation will include\ntrials under actual field conditions.\n\nRepresentative images of the qualitative results (Figure 2) shows 1) the NINA heater is capable\nof supporting LAMP, 2) that samples incubated in the NINA heater give results\nthat are virtually identical to those incubated in parallel in the GeneAmp\u00ae\n9600. For both incubators the turbidimetric readout method (Figure 2A) is difficult to interpret, but\nturbidity due to accumulating LAMP product is observed (relative to the\nno-template control, or NTC). The fluorescence of the Calcein reagent when\nilluminated with a UV lamp (Figure\n2B) is more easily seen as an increase in intensity (relative to NTC)\nfor the dilutions that are >1 pg/\u00b5L. Note that there is some background\nfluorescence visible in the NTCs with both heaters. These\nobservations conform to those noted by the operator at the actual time of the\nanalysis, so no artifacts have been introduced by the photographic process.\n\nA quantitative comparison of Calcein fluorescence corroborates the qualitative\nstudy. A statistical method comparison by the two most common techniques\nindicates substantial quantitative agreement between samples incubated in the\nNINA heater to those incubated in parallel in the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner. Linear\nregression of the fluorescence intensity units (FIU) observed for samples\nincubated in the NINA heater as a dependant variable of the FIU observed for\nsamples incubated in the ESE-Quant (Figure 3A) results in a slope of 0.98 and a y-intercept of 37.5 FIU,\nwith a coefficient of determination of 0.87. Bland-Altman analysis (Figure 3B) reveals a mean\ndifference (ESE \u2013 NINA) of \u221226 FIU, no dependence of difference on\nmean, and all differences lie within the \u00b12s interval that indicates the\ndifferences are random, not systematic. Although these experiments were intended\nto quickly assess the agreement between heater types and were not designed to\nrigorously define the dose response relationship of a nascent assay, closer\ninspection of the FIU for each concentration (Figure 3A) reveals a general increase in\nresponse with increasing dose, within the experimental noise limits of this\nadmittedly small sample set. As with the qualitative assay demonstration,\nconsiderable background fluorescence was observed in NTC reactions in\nboth heaters (Figure 3A and 3B).\n\nThese results clearly show that the NINA heater can incubate isothermal reactions\npredictably and precisely with no electricity and without any form of\nclosed-loop control. We also demonstrate that it can be used for LAMP assays,\nwith no discernable difference when compared to two reference heaters, the\nGeneAmp\u00ae 9600 and the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner. There is a bias between the\nNINA heater and the ESE-Quant (NINA higher), but this is not a significant\nfinding considering we are comparing FIU without any assay calibration. This\nbias would be easily removed by applying a standard curve. Although we did not\nintend to rigorously qualify the LAMP assay for malaria here, these results\nsuggest that a quantitative assay with a clinically significant lower limit of\ndetection and three decade dynamic range might be possible with further\ndevelopment of the protocol. Planned work will comprehensively compare\nincubation of several isothermal assays with the NINA heater to incubation with\nconventional, electrically-powered instruments by many metrics \u2013\nsensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and other standard figures of\nmerit must all be assessed before equivalence can be rigorously inferred.\nHowever, these prelimary results are very encouraging.\n\nWe have also explored heaters with temperature profiles suitable for other\nisothermal amplification techniques requiring different incubation temperatures,\ne.g., the Exponential Amplification Reaction (EXPAR), Nicking Enzyme\nAmplification Reaction (NEAR), or Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA),\ncould be integrated with this method. These prototypes are not significantly\ndifferent in form, but use different EPCMs, and in one case a different\nexotherm. A CaO heater with a different EPCM formulation has been shown to yield\na temperature profile suitable for EXPAR with a nominal temperature of 55\u00b0C\n(Figure 4A). Evaluation\nwith EXPAR reactions are in process. We have also explored a similar heater\napproach with sodium acetate (NaAc, Figure 4B). Hand warmers based on the crystallization reaction of\nNaAc are common. In a purified form, at typical ambient temperatures, liquid\nNaAc is thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable due to the absence of\nnucleating sites for crystal formation. The application of a mechanical shock\ninitiates the exothermic crystallization, and when mixed as a 25% aqueous\nsolution the phase change occurs repeatably at \u223c37\u00b0C. In this system,\nNaAc acts as both the exothermic reactant and the EPCM. This system has the\nadvantage of being regenerable (immersion of the NaAc in boiling water is\nsufficient). For isothermal amplification methods operating at temperatures\nbelow 45\u00b0C as well as for other diagnostic applications requiring heating\n(e.g., smart-polymer-based analyte pre-concentration[30]), NaAc is the preferred\nexothermic/phase change system. These results establish that the heater is a\nflexible platform for a number of isothermal detection techniques.\n\nWe have shown results for an instrument-free LAMP assay with a simple qualitative\nvisual readout. As operated here, LAMP is an exponential rate assay being\nassessed with an endpoint measurement. Thus, the timing of reaction\ninterrogation and/or a reliable \u201cstop\u201d reaction are required for\nquantitative precision. If quantitative results are required, improvements to\nthe entire assay system to facilitate precise timing will be necessary. This\ncould include, for example, a different heater-lid or incubation-vessels to\nfacilitate access, or a \u201creading window\u201d in the heater to enable\nvisual interrogation while the vessel is still in the heater. An elevated\ntemperature \u201cstop\u201d (>80\u00b0C) is generally used for LAMP. In our\nexperimental work here, we used an electrical heat block for this purpose;\nhowever, this could be accomplished with the electricity-free heater by the\ninclusion of a parallel heating unit at a higher temperature (essentially, by\nincluding a second incubation chamber that uses a different EPCM, or no EPCM at\nall). Alternatively, a chemical \u201cstop\u201d could be developed, or a\nboiling water bath could be kept at hand. Other assays perform best with a\npre-amplification, high-temperature denaturation step (\u201chot start\u201d).\nA second incubator chamber could facilitate this feature even more readily.\n\nThese data were gathered on contrived samples diluted in buffer. It has already\nbeen demonstrated that LAMP assays can be performed on clinically relevant\nspecimens without NA extraction/purification and without a pre-amplification,\nhigh-temperature denaturation step.[31]\u2013[35] Recent results of an HIV\nassay on the NINA platform with clinical samples from HIV-positive infants will\nbe reported elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, neither turbidity nor Calcein reactions are sequence-specific\nsignals\u2014as a result non-specific amplification will also produce a strong\nsignal\u2014a possible cause of the NTC background fluorescence noted above.\nGreater analyte specificity should be possible by incorporating a fluorescent\nmolecular beacon probe specific to an internal region of the target amplicon,\nthus minimizing non-specific signal. [28] Alternatively, the\namplified product could be the input to a lateral flow strip test with a visual\nreadout. [36]\u2013[39]\n\n\nAny of these potential improvements should be approached with a secondary aim of\nminimizing the potential for amplicon contamination from previous tests.\nWherever possible, opening of the amplicon container after amplification should\nbe avoided. This may be challenging if molecular beacon quenchers need to be\nadded, or aliquots for ICS testing need to be removed. Regardless of how the\nsystem and assays are improved, we have clearly demonstrated that the NINA\nheater is an effective device that can facilitate the electricity-free\namplification of NA using an isothermal technique.\n\nThere are several applications of this technology that could have an impact on\ndiagnostics for LRS. One application is as a modular amplification unit where a\nsample and the required reagents would be introduced to the heater and amplified\nproduct withdrawn for subsequent analysis by any simple detector. In this\nembodiment a standard PCR tube can be the reaction chamber and could be used\nlater as a cuvette for fluorometric analysis to resolve the presence of\namplicons. This would free the user from the high power requirements of\nelectrical heating but would still require some sort of detection instrument or\ndevice with its attendant requirements. One could also imagine how a properly\ntuned, stand-alone heater unit could be applicable to any field analytical or\npreparative method that requires a constant heat source; e.g., cell lysis or\ntemperature-responsive polymer mediated concentration. More compelling is the\npotential of the NINA heater as the core component of a stand-alone assay kit,\ncapable of providing a result without external electrical power, a reader\ninstrument, or any complex ancillaries. Such a device might include the NINA\nheater, reaction chambers containing lyophilized reagents, sample metering\ndevices, a readout chamber or lateral flow strip for visible interrogation, and\nan LED \u201cpenlight\u201d for fluorescence excitation (if required). We\nenvisage versions of the kit that are fully disposable (for high-value\napplications in developed countries such as for home testing and for\nfirst-responder biothreat detection) and partially reusable (primarily for LRS\nuse). Most of the components necessary to create such a NINA kit already exist.\nWe are currently working to combine them into a field-ready, instrument- and\nelectricity-free, sample-to-result, molecular diagnostic test system (Figure\nS1).\n\nWe have demonstrated the ability of an optimized NINA heater prototype, based on\nexothermic chemical reactions and EPCM, to support isothermal NA amplification\nassays and established its equivalence to commercially available PCR\ninstruments. The disposable heater described is a component of an\ninstrument-free point of care molecular diagnostics system under development.\nWhen combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power\nrequirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA\nheater will comprise part of a kit that enables electricity-free NA testing for\nmany important analytes. Replicate temperature profiles display minimal\nvariation between runs and far less variation than any similar devices,\nhighlighting the advantages of including an EPCM in the design. Versions of the\nprototype for several isothermal techniques have been presented, clearly\nevincing the potential of the NINA heater.\n\nIn the NINA heater for LAMP, we used the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide\n(CaO, or quicklime; Science Stuff, Inc., Austin, TX, USA, Cat # C1450) and water\nto generate the necessary heat. To keep the isothermal device within the\ntemperature band required for LAMP, the reaction chambers were surrounded with\nan engineered fat-based compound with a high specific heat capacity and specific\nmelting range centered around 65\u00b0C (Renewable Alternatives, Inc., Columbia,\nMO, USA). While several prototype heater designs have been explored, the\noptimized heater uses an off-the-shelf insulated food storage container (a\n\u201cthermos\u201d) to provide an insulated housing with two chambers (Figure 5). The bottom chamber\ncontains the exothermic reaction, and the upper chamber contains the EPCM and\nreaction wells. To facilitate directed heat transfer to the reaction wells, an\naluminum \u201choneycomb\u201d material (Plascore, Inc., Zeeland, MI, USA) was\nadded to the upper chamber prior to introduction of the EPCM. The machined\nreaction wells, sized to closely fit a standard 200-\u00b5L PCR tube, are\nembedded in the EPCM. Three reaction wells were used for most prototypes (one\nfor a positive control, one for a negative control, and one for an unknown\nspecimen); however, the existing prototype could easily be modified to accept\nseveral times this number without significant loss of performance, based on the\navailable space in the EPCM and first principles of heat transfer. An\ninexpensive spring timer (manufacturer's suggested retail price\n[MSRP] \u224810 US$) with an audible \u201cready\u201d\nindicator was affixed to the lid of the heater unit for added electricity-free\nfunctionality.\n\nLoopamp\u00ae DNA LAMP kits were purchased from Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd (Tokyo,\nJapan, Code No.: LMP206). The Eiken Loopamp\u00ae Fluorescence Detection Reagent\n(Code No.: LMP221), a Calcein-based reagent that indirectly indicates the\nprogress of DNA amplification in the LAMP reaction, was used for fluorescence\nexperiments. LAMP primer sequences for P. falciparum\n(Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville, IA, USA) were as described by Poon et\nal.[40]\nGenomic DNA from P. falciparum for preparing contrived samples\nwas obtained from the PATH laboratory specimen collection.\n\nEither an ESE-Quant Tube Scanner (ESE GmbH, Stockach, Germany) or a PE\nGeneAmp\u00ae Thermocycler 9600 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA ) was used\nas a quantitative reference instrument for temperature incubation. The ESE-Quant\nTube Scanner also served as a reference for quantitative fluorescence\nmeasurement. A SpectraMax M2 fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices,\nSunnyvale, CA, USA) was also used (as noted in individual experiments).\nPhysitemp IT-23, T-type thermocouples (Clifton, NJ, USA) and an Omega DaqPRO\n5300 Data Recorder (Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT, USA) were used to monitor\ntemperature.\n\nThermocouples were installed in a reaction well (below its microcentrifuge tube)\nat the bottom of the chamber containing the EPCM and in the exothermic reaction\nchamber for experiments performed to characterize the temperature profiles of\nthe heaters. The temperature acquisition rate was 1 Hz. Initial experiments were\nfocused on refining the dimensions of the heater, optimizing the quantity and\nquality of CaO and water, and testing EPCM formulations\u2014with the goal of\nminimizing initial pre-heating time and variability during the specified\nincubation period. In the optimized device, 20 gm of CaO and 6.8 mL of water\nwere added to the bottom chamber and mixed by rotary stirring for five strokes\nto initiate the heating and then the components were assembled as discussed\nabove.\n\nTo verify that the device could incubate a LAMP assay, the Eiken kits were used\nas per package insert instructions, except where noted below. Clinically\nrelevant dilutions of genomic DNA were made in Eiken kit buffer to yield the DNA\nconcentration and approximate parasite count noted for each experiment. All\ndilutions were prepared as single solutions and then aliquoted across treatment\nconditions to minimize preparation variation. No template controls (NTC) were\nprepared first and immediately sealed to reduce the possibility of\ncontamination. Mineral oil was layered on the tops of the samples to minimize\nevaporation. All reactions were incubated at 63\u00b0C.\n\nQualitative readout experiments were performed both with and without the Calcein\nreagent to determine if turbidimetric readouts were possible. To compare the\nperformance of the NINA heater to a reference heater, these experiments were\nalso performed in parallel with reactions incubated in both the test device and\nin the GeneAmp\u00ae thermocycler, programmed for a constant incubation at\n63\u00b0C.\n\nQuantitative fluorescence experiments were performed in parallel with reactions\nincubated in both the test device and in the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner, programmed\nfor a constant incubation at 63\u00b0C. For NINA incubated reactions, LAMP was\nterminated at the time (\u223c36 min.) when the signal from the parallel\nreactions on the Tube Scanner began to indicate detectable amplification to\navoid signal saturation in all dilutions. Termination was accomplished by flash\nchilling and later inactivating the reaction by heating at 80\u00b0C for 5\nminutes. The fluorescence signals of the NINA incubated samples were then read\non the SpectraMax M2 plate reader with\n\u03bbex = 485 nm and\n\u03bbem = 515 nm."}
