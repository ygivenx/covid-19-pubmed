{"title": "Epidemiological study of influenza virus infections in young adult outpatients from Buenos Aires, Argentina", "body": "(1AE3%) were human metapneumovirus positive by RT PCR. Cell culture detected six additional influenza viruses and one adenovirus positive sample. The sensitivity of immunofluorescence for influenza compared with culture was 70%. Symptoms did not predict etiology.\n\nViral respiratory infections are the most common acute illness worldwide. Influenza (Flu) virus is the most frequent cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) in adults. They usually present as abrupt, self-limited febrile infections that occur in outbreaks almost every winter. The attack rates during such periods have been reported to be as high as 10-40%. 1 Other viruses implicated are respiratory syncycial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus and in a lower frequency, coronavirus and enterovirus. 2 New viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus, the new coronaviruses (NL 63) and polyomavirus (KI, WU) have been recently identified. Limited information is available about their significance and frequency in non-hospitalized adult patients although they can also cause severe respiratory illness. [3] [4] [5] All age groups are affected by Flu infection but serious complications occur more frequently in young children, immunocompromised patients and the elderly. 6 These infections can lead to inadequate antibiotic use, numerous outpatient visits, and increased mortality in elderly nursing home patients. 7 Several studies have reported that other viruses such as RSV 8 and even bacteria can cause similar signs and symptoms. Therefore, rapid viral diagnosis is important to install antiviral treatment and to detect Flu outbreaks.\n\nSurveillance studies have been done mainly in developed countries, and data from Argentina come mainly from pediatric populations. 9 The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of influenza virus in young adult outpatients with ILI and to compare with the frequency of the other common respiratory viruses (RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses as well as hMPV). In addition, we evaluated whether the signs and symptoms predicted viral etiology and whether the use of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) changed the clinical management and infection control measures. Flu strains recovered from this study were compared with those recommended for the annual Flu vaccine.\n\nAdult outpatients with ILI attending the emergency room of a University Hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Centro de Educaci\u00f3 n M\u00e9dica e Investigacion Cl\u00ednica, CEMIC) during two consecutive winters (May-September 2004 and June-September 2005), were included. These periods corresponded to the 18-39 and 24-34 epidemiological weeks, respectively. Influenza-like illness was defined as fever (>38\u00b0C) at least once during the last 72 hours of symptoms and at least one upper respiratory sign \u2044 symptom (cough, nasal discharge, throat sore) and at least one of the following systemic sign \u2044 symptom: headache, myalgias, malaise, chills, prostration. The patients who gathered the inclusion criteria were invited to read and sign the informed consent and those who accepted were included in the study.\n\nThroat and nasal swabs were collected at the emergency room and sent in viral transport media to the Virology Laboratory. Clinical data including age, symptoms, Flu vaccination, presence of immunosupression and clinical management at the end of the visit were recorded in a form specially designed for this study. The attending physician at the emergency room decided whether the patient required symptomatic and \u2044 or antiviral or antibiotic treatment. This study was approved by the local IRB.\n\nSamples were processed by IIF with monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) for Flu A, Flu B, parainfluenza, adenovirus and RSV. All samples (n = 151) were tested by IIF and RT-PCR for hMPV detection. In addition, specimens from year 2004 were retrospectively cultured for Flu and adenovirus detection by inoculation in MDCK and HEp-2 cell lines.\n\nPatients with a positive viral result by IIF were telephoned within 24 hours by the principal investigator to evaluate any complications, evaluate the utility of viral treatment, and suggest infection control measures. When a complication was suspected, the patient was reexamined.\n\nFlu positive samples were sent to the National Center of Influenza (INES-ANLIS Carlos G. Malbr\u00e1n) for characterization of the strains by hemoagglutination-inhibition test.\n\nStudent's t-test was used to analyze continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical ones. Relationship between variables was evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and Pearson's correlation coefficient for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Statistical significance was assumed for P values of less than 0AE05.\n\nLogistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and its respective confidence intervals. \n\nThe mean age of the patients was 36AE6 years (SD 13AE6), predominantly female (60%). There were no statistical differences between the positive and negative groups regarding sex or age (Table 2) .\n\nOf 151 patients, only 12 (10%) had received the annual Flu vaccine. One of them was an immunocompromised HIV-infected patient who was Flu A positive.\n\nNone of the signs and symptoms were significantly associated with positive or negative results ( Table 2) . No complications were reported and none of the patients required hospitalization.\n\nOnly one Flu A positive patient received empirical oseltamivir at the emergency room because she had a renal transplant and was under immunosuppressive treatment. The rest of the patients consulted in an average of 43 hours after the symptoms started. In addition, viral diagnosis by IFI was not always available in the same day. As oseltamivir is effective within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, we could not implement treatment in our patients.\n\nInadequate use of antibiotics was not observed in this study. Only two Flu negative patients were given empirical antibiotics, as they developed bacterial pneumonia and had to be hospitalized.\n\nIn this study, 38% of the young adult outpatients with ILI had a viral etiology, 33% corresponded to Flu virus followed by RSV (3%). Other studies have shown similar or even lower viral detection in young adults. [10] [11] [12] In this study we have only investigated the common respiratory viruses, which are routinely detected by conventional Moreover, the application of molecular methods had revealed the existence of coinfections with two or more respiratory viruses. The clinical significance of these findings has yet to be determined.\n\nNo correlation was observed between specific signs and symptoms and etiology. This reinforces the need for a rapid viral diagnosis in order to define etiology, prevent indiscriminate use of antibiotics, reduce unnecessary interventions and implement infection-control measures including isolation of infected individuals. Lina and Valette. also observed that viral etiology in patients with ILI disease cannot be predicted on the basis of their clinical picture only. 15 Flu virus only responds to the use of antivirals if the treatment is started within the first 2 days of the onset of fever. In our study, most of the patients consulted after 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. In addition, viral diagnosis by IFI was not available in the same day. Therefore, our results were not useful in a timely manner for antiviral treatment. Rapid antigen devices for Flu which can give a result within the hour are useful in these cases. On the other side, viral etiology permitted infection control measures, like patient isolation. This is particularly important in the high-risk population such as immunocompromised patients and their close contacts. In addition, viral etiology contributed to epidemiological data and permitted identification of circulating strains.\n\nMost of Flu strains from our patients were similar to the corresponding vaccine strains for the Southern hemisphere for the correspondent year. Diagnosis and specific characterization of Flu strains is important in order to provide early warning on a potential Flu pandemic or epidemic.\n\nIn conclusion, viral diagnosis was achieved in almost 40% of the patients with ILI. The most frequent virus was Flu A followed by Flu B and RSV. Human metapneumovirus was detected in only 1AE3% of the cases, similar to what was described previously. 16 This study represents the first one evaluating viral etiology in young adult outpatients with ILI in Argentina."}
