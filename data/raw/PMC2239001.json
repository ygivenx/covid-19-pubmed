{"title": "An emerging cyberinfrastructure for biodefense pathogen and pathogen\u2013host data", "body": "Systems approaches are increasingly being used to understand gene/protein functions and complex regulatory processes on a global scale (1). Proteomics addresses identification, profiling and structure/function of proteins at a cellular or organism level (2,3). Transcriptomics is widely used for studying genome-wide gene expression patterns and regulatory networks. Storing, disseminating and integrating these heterogeneous types of data are critical to facilitate data exchange and analysis (4\u20137).\n\nThere are publicly available databases for storing and disseminating proteomics or transcriptomics data, such as ArrayExpress, GEO, PRIDE, PeptideAtlas, Protein Data Bank and Global Proteomics Machine database (8\u201313). Most of these data repositories host individual data types and do not provide organism-wide integration of genomic, transcriptomics and proteomic data, which is essential for developing a pathosystem-centric resource needed for supporting the research community.\n\nTo facilitate community research for discovery of candidates for the next generation of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has funded research to characterize pathogen proteomes and pathogen:host interactions, and mechanisms of pathogenesis, which includes contracts to seven PRCs that generate diverse experiment data sets from multiple pathosystems, and a Biodefense Proteomics Resource Center (RC) to store the data, provide visualization and analysis tools, and make it publicly accessible (for a complete list of organisms under investigation see the RC home page http://www.proteomicsresource.org/).\n\nTowards this goal, the RC is hosted across three institutions (SSS, VBI, PIR) and includes a variety of information and tools covering the organisms, reagents, publications, operating procedures, protein annotations, experiment data and more. These are highly linked to maximize the value to the research community. The remainder of this article will focus on one aspect of the RC, the public proteomics repository system which was developed with the following main objectives: (i) manage and disseminate transcriptomic and proteomic data; (ii) develop a cyberinfrastructure (http://www.nsf.gov/od/oci/reports/toc.jsp) for integration and interoperability of diverse data sets. The RC is a unique publicly available proteomics data resource that hosts a wide range of \u2018omics\u2019 data sets on pathogen and host interactions and integrates all experiment data submitted by PRCs to illustrate gene or protein functions involved in pathogen biology, and host and pathogen interaction.\n\nThe RC database application housing experiment data uses J2EE technologies and a N-tier architecture. The application has been modeled using Unified Modeling Language (UML) methodology.\n\nThe relational database is hosted on Oracle 9i. Data is distributed over three database instances which store experiment, protein and administrative data. Navigation between the experiment and protein databases is enabled by the use of UniProt accession numbers. Within the experiment data instance, query performance is optimized by using materialized views, which pre-join complex queries and reduce query response times.\n\nThe experiment data model includes five topic areas: (i) researcher information; (ii) protocols; (iii) experiment design and technologies; (iv) experiment results; and (v) annotation data. The database model supports multiple data types from transcriptomics, proteomics and genomics experiments. Common features across experiment types, such as experiment metadata and sample attributes, are modeled in generic data structures while experiment specific details, such as mass spectrometry charge and protein interactions, are tracked in specialized data structures. The database schema is available at the web link: http://proteinbank.vbi.vt.edu/ProteinBank/RC_database_schema.pdf.\n\nAt the middle tier, data objects and business logic are implemented using the Struts framework, a Model-View-Controller design pattern. An advantage of this approach is that it provides application developers with an abstract representation of the underlying data model which minimizes dependencies between the data model and application code.\n\nAt the front end, dynamic web pages are created by using Java Server Pages and Java Servlets.\n\nData is integrated in a protein-centric manner by mapping all proteins and genes in the experimental results to UniProtKB (14) or UniParc (15) accession numbers using the id-mapping mechanism provided by the iProClass (16) system. In rare cases, RC created identifiers for gene(s)/protein(s) that could not be mapped to the existing databases. The original IDs used by the research centers are preserved. In this way every gene/protein is assigned a unique accession number which links the experimental results from the biodefense research centers to functional annotation and information from 90 biological databases, including databases for protein families, functions and pathways, interactions, structures and structural classifications, genes and genome data, ontologies, literature and taxonomy. Data integration enhances the search functionality of the system, as protein attributes from all these other sources are made available in addition to those provided by the research centers, allowing complex searches across multiple experiments and data types. Hyperlinks to external data resources are provided.\n\nThe currently available data sets and data types, reagents and the corresponding organisms at the RC are listed in Table 1.\n\n\nBesides the published data described earlier, experimental data sets, including technologies and protocols that are adopted for generating those data, continue to be submitted to the center and are being processed for public dissemination. The predicted complete proteomes of organisms, as well as the annotation data extracted from the iProClass database, are available at the link (http://www.proteomicsresource.org/Resources/Catalog.aspx).\n\nThe RC supports data export at different levels, for instance: (i) summary data at organism level can be exported in different formats (e.g. FASTA), by selecting the relevant organism in the organism field of the annotation pages (http://pir.georgetown.edu/cgi-bin/textsearch_cat.pl). (ii) Data from individual experiments (e.g. identified protein list of Salmonella typhimurium grown under log phase) can be queried from the experiment data pages of mass spectrometry data type, with the experiment ID \u2018PNNL_MS_SAM_05\u2019 (http://proteinbank.vbi.vt.edu/ProteinBank/g/findexpbyid.do?id=PNNL_MS_SAM_05) and exported as a tab delimited file. (iii) Specific individual or group gene(s)/protein(s) in which the user is interested can be searched by entering keyword(s) or UniProtKB ID(s), and the search results can be exported as well. (iv) Experimental results data provided by the PRCs can be downloaded from the FTP site.\n\nThe RC provides a web-based protein-structure visualization and analysis tool (Figure 1). The tool allows visualizing the protein structure and provides the researcher with annotations derived from the features described in the publication for the protein. Multiple scenes have been illustrated for each SARS protein structure using a web-based tool that assists in designing and generating web page annotations (17). The annotations also link to a tool for interactive analysis of a protein structure or protein complexes in real-time 3D. A researcher may analyze SARS protein structures or choose to analyze any of those available from the Protein Data Bank, as well as structure files uploaded through the browser.\n\n\nIn order to support gene ontology (GO) term analysis, the publicly available AmiGO tool has been integrated with the RC system. AmiGO provides an interface to search and browse the ontology and annotation data provided by the GO consortium (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.tools.shtml). A database of GO terms, for organisms listed in Table 1, has been built into the RC system. Experimental data is seamlessly passed to the AmiGO search engine from which a GO hierarchy diagram is generated, and a GO term result frequency diagram, developed by the RC, is returned that provides the user with an overview of the GO terms. For example, the gene group from the experiment ID \u2018UOM_MA_07\u2019, as mentioned in the Data export section earlier, can be submitted for AmiGO analysis using the \u2018GO analysis\u2019 button at the bottom of the page. The frequency diagram is hyperlinked in the table header.\n\nIn the search page, http://pir.georgetown.edu/cgi-bin/textsearch_cat.pl, the user can query the summarized gene/protein information across multiple experiments by entering any recognized gene/protein identifier (e.g. GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ, UniProtKB accession numbers), protein names, gene names or functional keyword(s). Searching over 40 fields across the tables in the database is supported. For example, by entering the text \u2018mitogen-activated\u2019, selecting \u2018protein name\u2019 in the category field and submitting the search, a summary table of mouse \u2018mitogen-activated\u2019 protein information is presented (Figure 2A). The table can be customized with \u2018Display Options\u2019. In the page of summarized mitogen-activated proteins, it is shown that \u2018mitogen-activated protein\u2019 was detected in the mass spectrometry experiment when the macrophage was infected by Bacillus anthracis (Figure 2B) or S. typhimurium (Figure 2C). Gene expression patterns of macrophage grown with different treatments were addressed as well (Figure 2D). By following the hyperlink on the iProClass image located at the left side of Figure 2A, the user can navigate to the comprehensive annotation data of the mitogen-activated protein, such as KEGG pathway description, KEGG ID, literature and so on.\n\n\nFrom the Organisms page (http://proteinbank.vbi.vt.edu/ProteinBank/g/data.dll), selecting \u2018Organism\u2019 from the left navigation panel allows the user to query summarized experiment data that correspond to a specific pathosystem. For instance, all experiments carried out with B. anthracis are listed by selecting that pathosystem and submitting the query. The resulting page shows an overview of each individual experiment and allows the user to navigate all the way down to individual gene/protein information. The user can also start at the individual protein level and navigate to the experiments containing data for them. Starting at http://pir.georgetown.edu/cgi-bin/textsearch_cat.pl and using the \u2018Select an Organism to Show\u2019 drop down menu to choose Bacillus anthracis, all genes/proteins from the organism data will be listed with rich annotation. From there summarized data can be exported, tools such as BLAST can be run on individual or sets of proteins, the user can navigate to \u2018experiment summaries\u2019 by clicking on Experiment ID to find any experiments containing data on that protein, or the user can go directly to the experiment data on that individual protein by clicking on Dir.ID.\n\nThe advent of bioinformatics, genome-sequencing and high-throughput genome-wide experimentation (e.g. proteomics, transcriptomics) has lead to characterization of complex components pathosystems. System-wide studies of interactions between components of biological systems and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system are becoming increasingly possible (23\u201325). The available data in the RC [e.g. transcriptional and proteomics data of pathogen B. anthracis and of host mouse macrophages response (Use case 2)], greatly facilitates the analysis of the host and pathogen interaction using the framework of cyberinfrastructure built at the RC (26\u201330). For example, a researcher can query all proteins that have been experimentally demonstrated to interact with secretion system chaperones and further refine that list by choosing those proteins that have been annotated as having signal peptide characteristics and are conserved among a list of pathogens. This use case is illustrated in Figure 3. After entering the word \u2018chaperone\u2019 combined with the \u2018protein name\u2019 category, and \u2018signal\u2019 combined with the \u2018feature\u2019 category, as shown in the Figure 3A, and submitting the search, the system returns one chaperone protein in which the signal feature is represented (Figure 3A). Following the iProClass image (green at the left side), the user can review this chaperone protein summary information stored in the RC system (Figure 3B). Again clicking the UniProtKB ID hyperlink in Figure 3B, the user will obtain the most comprehensive annotation data regarding this chaperone protein (Figure 3C). More sophisticated search can be carried out by the experienced users.\n\n\nCurrently, several data sets including mass spectrometry, gene expression microarray, protein 3D structure and genomic clone data from several pathosystems are available for public access. As more data are integrated into the resource, it will become an even more valuable tool for the scientific community. We continue to improve the utility and usability of the resource to facilitate the research on the discovery of potential diagnostics, drug targets and vaccines.\n\nExperimental data sets continue to be submitted to the RC and are planned through June 2009. Ongoing development of the RC is driven by feedback from the PRC investigators, the scientific community and a Scientific Working Group http://www.proteomicsresource.org/AdminCenter/SWG.aspx for the project. We invite input from the research community through the Feedback form which can be reached from the top navigation bar on every RC page."}
