{"title": "", "body": "of ovine and bovine C.jejuni abortion-associated isolates. Similarity analysis was performed using the Dice coefficient, and clustering was performed by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages UPGMA (optimization, 1% and position tolerance, 1.5%) (Sanad et al., 2011; Ribot et al., 2001) . Numbers on bootstraps represent Cophenetic correlations. Black boxes indicate resistance to different antimicrobials tested as described previously (Sanad et al., 2011; Sanad et al., 2013) . Antimicrobials; azithromycin (AZ) (Breakpoint for a resistant Campylobacter isolate: \u22658 \u00b5g ml -1 ); ciprofloxacin (CI) (\u22654 \u00b5g ml -1 ); erythromycin (ER) (\u226532 \u00b5g ml -1 ); gentamicin (GE) (\u22658 \u00b5g ml -1 ); tetracycline (TE) (\u226516 \u00b5g ml -1 ); florfenicol (FF) (\u22658 \u00b5g ml -1 ); nalidixic acid (NA) (\u226564 \u00b5g ml -1 ); telithromycin (TL) (\u22658 \u00b5g ml -1 ); and clindamycin (CL) (\u22658 \u00b5g ml -1 ). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2006) . Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was conducted as described previously (Sanad et al., 2011; Dingle et al., 2001) . cells. Invasion and survival assays were performed as described previously (Sanad et al., 2011; Konkel et al., 1992; Prasad et al., 1996) "}
