{"title": "Biomedical Science Original Paper Early Detection of Antibodies against Various Structural Proteins of the SARS-Associated Coronavirus in SARS Patients", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease. The causative agent of SARS has been identified to be a new type of coronavirus, namely SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5, 8, 14] . Shortly after the 1 st reported case in Guangdong, southern China, in late 2002 [2] , outbreaks of SARS spread to Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and other areas, including Taiwan. As of June 30, 2003, 8,447 prob-K A R G E R able SARS cases including 811 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 32 countries or regions worldwide. The 1 st case of SARS in Taiwan, a 54-year-old male who returned from a business trip to Guangdong, was diagnosed and reported in early March 2003 [16] . Subsequently, a large outbreak took place in late April partly due to an unrecognized SARS index patient who made multiple visits to different hospitals and exposed many patients, visitors, and health care workers [9] , resulting in 678 probable cases and 84 deaths in Taiwan by the end of June [3] .\n\nThe genome of the SARS-CoV is positive-sense, singlestranded RNA with sequences distantly related to all known coronaviruses that infect humans and animals [ 1 I, 15] . Like other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing three envelope proteins, namely membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, together with the viral RNA genome, presumably tbrms a helical core located inside the viral envelope. Based on the structure of all known coronaviruses, the M protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is the most abundant protein in the virus particle, while the E protein is present in a minute amount in the viral envelope. In some coronaviruses, the S protein has been shown to bind to cellular receptors on the host cell surface. Generally, the immune response against the S protein is believed to prevent viral attachment and entry into host ceils.\n\nAt the very beginning of the SARS outbreak, the case definition for SARS was merely based on clinical history and symptoms. However, after confirmation that SARS-CoV was the causative agent, laboratory methods, including viral isolation, nucleic acid tests, and serological tests, were quickly developed and were accepted as one of the categories for a SARS diagnosis [ 17] . Even though the RT-PCR or the real-time PCR is currently the most sensitive technique for detecting SARS-CoV, its positive rate for probable SARS cases is around 38% according to data of the Center for Disease Control of Taiwan (CDC-Taiwan). This is likely because specimens might not be obtained at an optimal time point during the course of the SARS-CoV infection, or specimens might be taken improperly, especially for nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat swabs. Thus, it was suggested that multiple and repeated collections of nasopharyngeal, throat, and fecal samples be taken in order to increase the positive rate determined by RT-PCR. In addition to nucleic acid tests, serodiagnosis of SARS is also important. Given that SARS is a new disease in humans, antibodies against SARS-CoV should not be detected in people who have not been exposed to the virus; an antibody occurring in sera would be a useful index for SARS infection. It was reported that IgG against SARS-CoV was detectable in convalescent sera using SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells as antigens in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [ 13] .\n\nTo reduce the risk of infection, bacterially expressed recombinant SARS-CoV proteins instead of whole virus were used as antigens in the Western blotting (WB) assay. The recombinant proteins including the N, E, M, and various truncated forms of the S protein were tested to see whether they reacted with the sera of probable SARS patients collected during the acute and convalescent stages of the illness. Because humoral immunity displays different isotypes of antibodies, including IgA, IgG, and IgM, during the infection, we thus evaluated whether these antibodies could be used as diagnostic indices for SARS infection. The results of WB analyses were summarized and compared with those of IFA and RT-PCR. Overall, the results between the recombinant protein-based WB and whole-virus-based IFA showed a high correlation.\n\nThe coding regions for the SARS-CoV proteins N, M, and E and fragments of S ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, and $7) protein were amplified by 30 cycles of PCR using reverse-transcribed RNA extracted from the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV (GenBank accession No. AY278741). The Urbani strain with 29,727 nucteotides in length was kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-US; Atlanta, Ga., USA). Sequences of the primers used in the PCR are listed in table 1, the amplicons from which carried either BamHI/Sall or BamHI/HindiII restriction sites. The size of the nucleotide sequence of N was 1,269 bp, those of M 666, E 231, S1 429, $2 353, $3 560, $4 725, $5 630, $6 690, and $7 663 bp. The amplified products were purified from the gel and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen, Studio City, Calif., USA). The resulting constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA). All sequences of' inserts were verified using an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nThese proteins were expressed in E. coIi JM109. A colony of E. coli cells was separately inoculated into LB broth in the presence of \n\nHindIII a F denotes tbrward primer. b R denotes reverse primer.\n\ncentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 rain, the pellet was resuspended in an Eppendorf vial containing 1.5\u00b0/0 sarcosine and 10 mM Tris-HC1 buffer, pH 7.0, vortexed at room temperature for 1 h, until the lysate appeared clear, and recentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, and BD TALON TM metal affinity resins (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif., USA) were then added. The vials were mildly agitated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The resins were centrifuged and washed twice with 10 mM Tris-HC1 buffer containing 1 M NaC1. These proteins were examined by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were either stained with Coomassie blue or were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF Immobilon P, pore size 0.45 gin; Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) to determine the recombinant proteins. To eliminate the few bactel-ial contaminants present in the inclusion bodies, these recombinant proteins were eluted with 50-200 mM imidazole solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nAccording to WHO criteria, a person presenting after November 1, 2002, with a history of high fever (> 38 \u00b0 C), coughing, or breathing difficulty and having resided in or traveled to an area with recent local transmission of SARS during the 10 days prior to onset of symptoms was classified as a suspected case. A suspect case with radio-graphic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on a chest X-ray was considered a probable case. In this study, 90 human serum samples from 54 patients, fulfilling WHO criteria for probable SARS cases, were selected from hospitalized patients in northern Taiwan. Of these 18 male and 38 female cases, 36 had paired sera, and 18 had only single serum collected either at the acute stage or in the convalescent stage of the illness. All serum samples had been analyzed for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR, among which 48 were positive and 42 negative. The primers used for the RT-PCR were synthesized according to CDC-US recommendations [8] . The handling of specimens, such as collecting, taking aliquots of, or diluting specimens, and the practice of nucleic acid extraction or the RT-PCR assay were performed in BSL-2 (biosafety level 2) laboratories. Laboratory workers were required to wear protective equipment, including disposable gloves, laboratory coats, and an N-95 mask.\n\nHRP-conjugated goat antihuman immunoglobulins, IgA (c~ chain), IgG (3' chain), and IgM (g chain), were purchased from Savyon Diagnostics (Ashdod, Israel). These products were purified with affinity columns. \n\nVeto E6 cells were grown in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 35\u00b0C. At a density of 80%, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV (106/ml). After cytopathic effects appeared, the cells were washed with 0.025% trypsin and spotted onto slides. These slides were placed in a closed heating container, until they completely dried, then the slides were fixed in acetone for 15 rain. Ten microliters of diluted serum, starting from 1:100, was placed onto each well of the slide and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 rain. After washing twice with PBS for 5 rain each, 10 gl of l:100-diluted specific antihuman gamma globulins labeled with FITC (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, Calif., USA) was added to each well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 rain. After washing twice with PBS, the slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Culture of the virus and preparation of viral antigens for IFA were conducted in a BSL-3 laboratory. After being fixed with acetone, the IFA slides were examined in a BSL-2 laboratory.\n\nEqual amounts of purified recombinant proteins were mixed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk (Difco, Sparks, Md., USA) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and then were sliced into strips (0.5 x 8 cm). Therefore, the loading in each strip was theoretically equal. Serum samples were 1:500 diluted with 5% skim milk. Two milliliters of the diluted serum was added to each strip and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the following day, these strips were washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 three times for 10 min each and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with 2 ml of 1: 1,000diluted goat antihuman IgG, IgA, and IgM HRP conjugate (Savyon Diagnostics) separately. After washing as described above, the strips were incubated in ECL solution (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass., USA) for 1 rain. The strips were then dried and exposed to X-ray film to visualize the reaction.\n\nSensitivity [number of true positives/(number of true positives + number of false negatives)] and specificity [number &true negatives/ (number of true negatives + number of false positives)] were calculated as previously described [1 ] . The antibody response of different immunoglobulin classes to SARS-CoV recombinant proteins was plotted according to the optical density of the WBs which were scanned and quantified using TotalLab software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The value of each band was normalized wkh the control serum. Results were subjected to Sigma Plot for curve plotting and pair-to-pair t-test. For all statistical analyses p < 0.05 was considered significant,\n\nThe encoding regions for the full-length E, M, and N proteins and the truncated forms of S proteins of SARS-CoV are marked in figure 1 . For easy handling, the 1,255 amino acid long open reading frame of the S protein was split into seven consecutive truncated forms of polypeptides, designated S 1-$7. After induction with IPTG, most of the proteins were synthesized and were present in inclusion bodies. They were resolved in buffer containing 1.5 % sarcosine and were purified by metal affinity resins. Samples of the bacterially expressed SARS-CoV N, M, E, $2, $5, and $6 proteins were analyzed and are shown in figure 2 . The molecular masses of N, E, $2, $5, and $6 were 46, 10, 14, 23, and 25 kD, respectively, as expected. However, the apparent molecular mass of recombinant M protein in gel, at 35 kD, was larger than the calculated size (approximately 25 kD), possibly due to the high content of hydrophobic amino acid residues (49%, 109/221) in the M protein. The recombinant proteins of S1, $3, $4, and $7 were poorly expressed in E. coli; therefore, they were not used in the study (data not shown).\n\nA w\n\nThe recombinant proteins were then pooled and tested to see whether they reacted with the antibodies in the serum samples of probable SARS patients by WB analysis. Among them, 14 positive results in our WB and RT-PCR analyses, which also represent various stages of the illness, were selected and are presented in figure 3 . Serum samples of these patients were collected from the 2nd through the 33rd days after the onset of illness and were labeled F-1854-D2, for example, to indicate female patient 1854's day 2 serum. Two serum samples from healthy people were used as negative controls for SARS-CoV-specific antibodies ( fig. 3, lanes 1 and 16) . As shown in figure 3 , the N protein could be recognized by IgA, IgG, or IgM ( fig. 3A, lanes 4-15; fig. 3B , lanes 8-11, 13-16; fig. 3C, lanes 7, 8, 13-15 ). However, the S ($5 or $6) and M proteins were recognized by IgA or IgG, but were barely recognized by IgM ( fig. 3A, lanes 2, 3, 11-15; fig. 3B , lanes 3-5, 8-15; fig. 3C, lanes 5, 7, 11) . Two recombinant proteins, E and $2, were not recognized by IgA, IgG, or IgM in any serum of SARS patients. A protein band with an arrowhead might represent degraded products of M protein or contaminated unknown proteins copurified with the recombinant M protein. Since a specific IgM was found to weakly react with M and S antigens and since positive cases for IgM were all included in that of IgA or IgG, IgM was not further analyzed in the following studies. Taken together, our results demonstrated that recombinant N, M, $5, and $6 proteins could be used as diagnostic markers for SARS-CoV infection.\n\nIn order to elucidate more clearly the antibody response to various antigens of SARS-CoV, line diagrams were drawn according to the WB results ( fig. 3) coli. The proteins were purified with affinity resins and stained with Coomassie blue after SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Lanes 1-6 show individual purified proteins. Lane 7 shows the six pooled proteins used for WB mlalysis.\n\nhealthy volunteers. However, it must be emphasized that this antibody response profile represents pooled data selected from t4 probable SARS patients, not the kinetic change of 1 individual. As shown in figure 4 , N protein possessed major antigenicity to various antibodies (tgA, IgG, and IgM). Noticeably, the antibody response of IgA to N protein was initiated as early as day 2 or 3 after illness onset, with a sevenfold increase which progressively increased to 15-fold within 1 month (fig. 4A ). The increased multiples of antibodies to N protein were significantly higher than those of M proteins and S proteins according to the paired t-test (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The responses of IgM and IgG to N protein were similar to that of IgA. However, they appeared on days 10 and 16, respectively, after the onset of illness. The M protein could be detected by IgA or IgG. The antibody response to M protein was much lower than that to N protein ( fig. 4A-C) . Interestingly, few patients had an IgA antibody response to spike proteins in the early stage (days 2-3), but most other patients had a similar response in the convalescent stage (days 16-21 after illness onset). A I g A expression profile. The antibody response to N protein was higher than those to M and S proteins (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively, by paired t test). B IgG expression profile. The antibody response to N protein was higher than those to M and S proteins (p < 0.05 by paired t test). C IgM expression profile. The antibody response to N protein did not significantly differ from those of M and S proteins (p > 0.1 by paired t-test \n\nTo evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the WB assay using the recombinant proteins in this study, we compared data from WB with the results of whole-virusbased IFA. Table 3 shows sensitivity and specificity of Table 4 shows the results of RT-PCR and WB in the acute and convalescent stages of the illness in 54 probable SARS patients. Throat swab specimens were used for RT-PCR, and cognate serum samples were used for the WB assay, tn the single-serum group, the positive rates of RT-PCR and WB were measured at 500/o (4/8) and 25% (2/8) for specimens collected in the acute stage (days 1-12 after illness onset), and the positive rates for RT-PCR and WB were 400/0 (4/10) and 600/0 (6/10), respectively, in the convalescent stage (days 19-41 after illness onset). In the paired-sera group, the positive rates of RT-PCR and WB were 50% (18/36) and 75% (27/36), respectively. Overall, the positive rate was 48.1\u00b0/0 (26/54) for RT-PCR and 64.8% (35/54) for WB. Combining RT-PCR and WB results, the laboratory confirmation rate for probable SARS patients increased to 72.2% (39/54). a Throat swabs were used for the RT-PCR assay.\n\nA WB assay using recombinant proteins as antigens was developed to detect SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. To evaluate whether the WB could be used, sensitivities and specificities were measured and compared with those of IFA. As shown in table 4, the recombinant-proteinbased WB analysis correlated very well with the wholevirus-based IFA. These findings indicate that the recombinant proteins of N, M, $5, and $6 may be useful as antigens to detect specific antibodies against SARS-CoV. Moreover, large amounts of recombinant proteins can easily be obtained in an E. coli system which offer several advantages over the antigens prepared from virus-infected cells, such as decreasing the risk of infection and ease of performing the assay with standardization.\n\nAs shown in table 2, N-related antigens showed a principal antigenicity of 58.3% for SARS-CoV in RT-PCRpositive patients, and S antigens contributed 14.6% to the overall positive rate of 72.9%. These data are related to those of Krokhin et al. [7] who conducted a WB assay using convalescent sera of SARS patients to detect proteins in the supernatants of cells containing SARS-CoV and identified the predominant protein N and minute quantities of protein S. However, we could not detect antibodies against E protein, and only a few SARS patients (19.2%, 10/54) had antibodies against M protein. These findings are not correlated with the results obtained by Elia et aI. [6] who reported that antibodies against M protein of a canine coronavirus were consistently detected in seropositive dogs.\n\nIn terms of the reactivity of different immunoglobulin classes, we found that specific IgA antibodies already existed 2 or 3 days after illness onset in some cases; however, at the same time, IgM antibodies could not be detected in the same patients ( fig. 3) . The weak signal of IgM might have resulted from the characteristics of IgM itself, since the affinity of IgM to antigens is relatively low as compared with that of IgG or IgA. Therefore, the detectable sensitivity of IgM to SARS-CoV proteins is limited. The human respiratory tract has been proposed to be the major site of SARS-CoV infection in humans, and it is totally covered with mucosal surfaces. Not only do cellular immune responses result from mucosat infection by intracellular pathogens, but also secretory IgAs are produced to function as another important defense mechanism against invasion of deeper tissues by these pathogens [18] . Therefore, the synthesis of specific IgA antibodies in the early stage of a SARS-CoV infection is reasonable, and this phenomenon was also observed in other studies related to coronaviruses [4, I0, 12] . For example, Loa et al. [10] reported that the specific IgA antibodies against a turkey coronavirus were initially detected in serum 1 week after oral inoculation; these gradually increased and reached a peak at week 4 and finally declined at weeks 6-9. Furthermore, we noted that all three classes of immunoglobulins reacted with N and S antigens, but the antibody response of IgM to S antigen was much lower than that of IgA or IgG. Whether this phenomenon is significant for the immunological role of IgA, IgG, or IgM in SARS patients requires more detailed investigation. Table 4 illustrates that RT-PCR was more sensitive than WB during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection. However, WB was more sensitive than RT-PCR, if sera were collected in the convalescent phase of the illness. In general, the combined use of RT-PCR and WB raised the positive rate from 48.1 to 72.2% for probable SARS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that the use of recombinant protein-based WB along with RT-PCR can increase the rate of confirmation of suspected SARS patients."}
