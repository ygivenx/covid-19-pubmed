{"title": "DNA transducer-triggered signal switch for visual colorimetric bioanalysis", "body": "The principle of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of the signal transducer, CHA amplification and DNAzyme signal readout steps. The target T0 (in red) is the part of lytA gene of S. pneumoniae. Domain b and c of the hairpin H0 (in blue), have been designed according to the sequences of H1, serve as a toehold for initiating the amplification reaction. The signal transducer H0 is generated by extending the 3\u2019-end of domain b and c to form a hairpin loop where domain b* of H0 is occluded by domain b. Therefore H0 should be catalytically inactive. The loop a* is the complementary sequence to 24 nt of lytA gene nucleic acid. A pair of hairpins was designed based on our previous research works28. The two hairpins (H1 and H2) do not initially interact with each other but can catalytically form a duplex in the presence of unstructured domain b and c. The unstructured domain e and f of H1 are able to form G-quadruplex. When domain e is hidden in the stem of H1, the G-quadruplex cannot be formed at this time. In the presence of target, the loop can hybridize with the target, forming a rigid duplex and disrupting the stem formed by domain b*and b. The liberated b and c further open H1, leading to the formation of toehold for strand displacement by H2. Then H2 hybridizes with the unfolded H1 and releases the complex of T0 and H0 (T0-H0) into next circulation. As a result, the generated abundant G-quadruplex structures are proportional to targets. The G-quadruplex structure can strongly bind with hemin to form the DNAzyme, displaying peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing oxidation of ABTS2\u2212 to ABTS\u2212.\n\nTo validate whether the detectable signal really derived from the target or not, the comparative experiments were performed to prove feasibility of the proposed method. After incubation with hemin for 40 min, the absorbance of different mixtures was recorded. As shown in Fig. 2A, the system containing H1 exhibited very weak characteristic absorption peak at 418 nm (Fig. 2A, curve a). Compared with curve a, there was almost no change in the mixture of H1 and H2 (Fig. 2A, curve b). Upon the addition of H0 to the H1, H2 system, a slight increase in absorption peak was detected (Fig. 2A, curve c). The results demonstrated that H0 can trigger weak interaction of H1 and H2 to form a small amount of self-assembly product, resulting in background signal. When the mixture of 500 pM T0, H0 and H1 was incubated together, the absorbance increased slightly (Fig. 2A, curve d), indicating that T0 can trigger the self-assembly of H0 and H1, forming a certain amount of G-quadruplex structures. But in the presence of T0 and H2 (Fig. 2A, curve e), the amplified signal was about 282% of that without H2 (Fig. 2A, curve d). Such significant signal enhancement clearly indicates that the cycling amplification strategy can be executed with the aid of hairpin H2. The insets of Fig. 2A show the corresponding photographs of the colorimetric responses.\n\nWe also used native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to characterize the reaction process (Fig. 2B). The base number of H0 (lane 1), H1 (lane 2) and H2 (lane 3) derived from PAGE were in accordance with our design. Significantly, the mixture of H0 and H1 did not cause their self-hybridization reaction (lane 4), neither did the mixture of H1 and H2 (lane 5). T0 hybridized with the partial H0 (lane 6). When we mixed the H0, H1 and H2, there was a barely visual band (lane 7) above H0, H1 and H2, which was H1-H2 complex. Expectedly, adding T0 to the H0 solution followed by incubation with H1 and H2, the H1-H2 band (lane 8) became much brighter compared with H1-H2 of lane 7.\n\nTo achieve the optimal analytical performance, different reaction conditions were optimized. First, the effect of concentration of hairpin H0 and H1 were investigated respectively. High concentration of hairpin structures can increase the self-assembly, but correspondingly increase the noise owing to the potential hybridization of hairpins. To avoid the signal increase induced by nonspecific background amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay. The maximum value of signal-to-noise ratio was achieved at the H0 concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 3A). The concentration of H1 was also critical parameter affecting the analytical performance. As showed in Fig. 3B, 125 nM H1 was chosen for the subsequent experiments according to the maximum signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nTime dependence of the T0-H0 catalyzed hairpin assembly was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 3C, in the absence of target T0, only very weak signal increase was observed (in red). In the presence of target T0 (in black), with the increase of the incubated time, the signal synchronously ascended. The continuously increasing signal also indicated that the T0-H0 catalyzed hairpin assembly was indeed taking place. Beyond the incubation time of 20 min, the absorbance intensity reached a stable value. Therefore, 20 min was selected as the optimal incubation time for CHA. Finally, the incubating temperature was examined from 4 to 55 \u00b0C (Fig. 3D). At 37 \u00b0C, the signal-to-noise ratio reached the top, so 37 \u00b0C was selected as the appropriate temperature.\n\nUnder the optimal experimental conditions, the UV\u2212vis absorption increase with the increasing concentration of target T0. As shown in Fig. 4A, the absorbance intensity enhanced successively with the increasing concentration of target DNA. As expected, the inset showed the color variation of the reaction solution for the increasing amounts of T0, a series of noticeable color change could be visualized from light to deep (inset of Fig. 4A). By analyzing the absorbance with the concentrations of T0 (Fig. 4B), the linear curve of the absorbance intensity (Y) vs the logarithm of the T0 concentration (C) was fitted to a regression equation of Y = 0.1471 lg (C/pM) - 0.1498 (R2 = 0.9994) in the range of 50 pM\u2013200 nM. The detection limit was calculated to be 32 pM according to the responses of the blank tests plus 3 times the standard deviation. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were 3.6% and 5.9%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the developed colorimetric assay has good precision and acceptable reproducibility.\n\nTo evaluate the reliability and practicability of the proposed method, the detection of the PCR products using the developed method was carried out by culturing S. pneumoniae at the concentrations from 0 to 2.4 \u00d7 107 CFU mL\u22121. After a pretreatment step for the samples, PCR was performed using target lytA gene extracted from each concentration of S. pneumoniae, and PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4C). There was no target band of PCR products for S. pneumoniae less than 2.4 \u00d7 105 CFU mL\u22121 owing to the low resolution of gel electrophoresis29. Meanwhile, the denatured PCR products were also detected using the developed colorimetric biosensor. As shown in Fig. 4D, a good linear dependence on absorbance intensity with logarithm of the S. pneumoniae concentration was achieved in the range from 102 to 107 CFU mL\u22121. The calibration curve can be expressed as Y = 0.1126 lg(C/pM) \u20130.1659 (R2 = 0.9926), and the detection limit was calculated to be 156 CFU mL\u22121 (n = 3), which is much lower than previous reported methods (Supplementary Table S1). The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were 4.5% and 6.2%, respectively, demonstrating potential promise in clinical application.\n\nThe specificity of the method was further investigated by exposing hairpins to a series of artificial targets sequences, including perfect complementary target DNA T0, single-base mismatched DNA (T1), two-bases mismatched DNA (T2), and non-complementary DNA (NT) at the same concentration (1 nM). As shown in Fig. 5A, the absorbance for one-base mismatched DNA and two bases mismatched DNA was only about 25.8% and 4.0% of that for perfect target, respectively. The non-complementary target DNA showed almost the same response as the blank solution, indicating high specificity and great potential for single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. This may be attributed to the relatively long stem region of the hairpin structure with thermodynamic stability. In addition, the specificity of the developed method was further explored using other streptococci and major pathogenic bacteria presented in clinical samples. As shown in Fig. 5B, S. pneumoniae and other bacteria at two different concentration levels (107 and 108 CFU mL\u22121) were analyzed. The results show that 7 strains S. pneumoniae have similar high signal responses among all the bacteria tested. The signal responses of other bacteria show no difference to that of the blank solution. Thus, this method displays excellent specificity and conservative for the detection of S. pneumoniae.\n\nThe potential application of the developed colorimetric biosensor was investigated for detection of S. pneumoniae in clinical samples. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, there were good correlation for the assaying results of clinical human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cerebrospinal fluid samples using and bacterial culture method, indicating the feasibility and acceptable accuracy of proposed method for detection of S. pneumoniae in complex clinical samples. In addition, the assaying values of the proposed method were slightly larger than bacterial culture plating count. These results may be attributed to detected DNA from dead bacteria. In the future research, a large number of clinical samples will be applied to further verify the developed method.\n\nIn principle, non-nucleic acid can also be employed as inputs. Previous studies2430 have shown that the aptamer can be used in conjugation with catalyzed hairpin assembly for the detection of non-nucleic-acid analytes. Therefore, based on the developed colorimetric strategy, Salmonella Typhimurium has been successfully detected using transducer with the similar circuit\u2019s module. The principle of detecting Salmonella Typhimurium is illustrated in Fig. 6A. We design an aptamer beacon in which an anti-Salmonella Typhimurium aptamer27, Apt, is inhibited by a complementary strand, Inh. Apt contains the toehold (domain b and c) for initiating the amplification reaction, and Inh can block the catalyst region. When Apt is bound with Inh, it can neither bind Salmonella Typhimurium nor catalyze the hybridization of H1 and H2. In contrast, free Apt can do both. As a result, when the Salmonella Typhimurium binds to and stabilizes Apt, it shifts the equilibrium so that the duplex with Inh is destabilized and the single-stranded toehold is available to activate the amplification reaction. As shown in Fig. 6B, the cultured three Salmonella Typhimurium were inoculated into PBS with different concentrations from 0 to 8 \u00d7 107 CFU mL\u22121 (with 1:4 dilution), respectively. Upon addition of Salmonella Typhimurium with increasing concentration, the intensity of absorbance increased successively. The RSD of the intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were 5.0% and 7.6%, respectively. The results indicate that the developed method possesses the potential as a pragmatic tool for Salmonella Typhimurium direct detection in real samples. Furthermore, the amplification strategy can be used for detection different targets by means of changing the corresponding complementary target DNA or aptamer strands, demonstrating versatile and potential colorimetric sensing platform.\n\nIn summary, this work proposes a DNA nanotechnology-triggered signal switch and combines the transducer with CHA recycling amplification to develop a highly sensitive and selective strategy for homogeneous visual colorimetric bioanalysis. This strategy has been successfully used for detection of oligonucleotide and Salmonella Typhimurium. It can conveniently be extended to a wide range of analytes with available affinity ligands. This developed method shows excellent analytical performance with satisfactory versatility for different analytes. In addition, the proposed strategy possesses good reproducibility and acceptable accuracy for clinical practical sample analysis, and provides a label-free, enzyme-free, low-cost, visual, simple, rapid, sensitive and specific platform for clinical diagnostics.\n\nThe experiments were performed in 100 \u03bcL of solution containing 50 \u03bcL of H0 (400 nM) and 50 \u03bcL of target DNA solution of different concentrations. The mixture was first incubated in TNaK buffer for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to allow the hairpin structure to be opened. After that, 50 \u03bcL of H1 (500 nM) and 50 \u03bcL of H2 (400 nM) was added the above mixture to give the final concentrations of 125 nM and 100 nM, respectively. And further incubation in TNaK buffer for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. Subsequently, 3 \u03bcM of hemin was introduced to the resulted solution and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Finally, 200 uL of ABTS2\u2212 (4 mM) and 1 \u03bcL of 30% H2O2 were added to the mixture and mixed completely. The mixture was added into square quartz cuvettes, and the absorption spectra were collected from 500 to 400 nm on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The rate of the peroxidase-mimicking reaction was monitored at 418 nm. All measurements were conducted at room temperature.\n\nHow to cite this article: Chen, W. et al.
