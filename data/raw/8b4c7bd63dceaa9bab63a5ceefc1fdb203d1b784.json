{"title": "", "body": "Abstract-Topsentin, a bis(indolyl)imidazole marine natural product, inhibited the proliferation of cultured human and murine tumor cells at micromolar concentrations (lcsO values ranged from 4 to 40pM) and was active against in uiuo P388 leukemia (%T/C = 137, 150mg/kg, QDl-5) and B16 melanoma (%T/C = 144, 37.5 mg/kg, QDl-9) tumors. Effects of 30 KM topsentin (l-hr exposures) on incorporation of radiolabeled precursors by P388 cells indicated inhibition of DNA synthesis (91%) and to a lesser extent RNA synthesis (57%), whereas synthesis of protein was unaffected (0%). Fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide indicated ihat topsentin interacted with DNA. No evidence for intercalation was observed in DNA unwinding studies, but competitive binding experiments with Hoechst 33342 and CC-1065 indicated that topsentin bound to DNI\\ in the minorgrobve.\n\nNonintercalative DNA groove-binding drugs exhibit a wide spectrum of antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antiviral, and antitumor activity. Drugs capable of interacting with the minor groove of DNA are structurally diverse compounds, and not surprisingly several distinct modes of binding have been observed. Netropsin and distamycin A reversibly bind to the minor groove of AT regions of B-DNA [l] . Similarly, 4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPIO), bisbenzimide dyes, and the anti-trypanosomal drug, berenil, bind preferentially to AT-rich DNA within the minor groove of the helix [2] . A preference for GC sequences is shown by antitumor antibiotics of the aureolic acid group (mithramycin, olivomycin, and chromomycin), which also bind in the minor groove [3] . In contrast to these reversible physical interactions, CC-1065 and pyrrolo[l,4] benzodiazepines (anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin) bind covalently to DNA and the resulting drug adducts occupy the minor groove [4, 5] . Certain compounds that intercalate may also interact with the minor groove of DNA. Although the chromophore of actinomycin D intercalates between GC base pairs, the cyclic amino acid side chains are located in the minor groove and the carbonyl oxygen of the threonine moiety is hydrogen-bonded to the NH2 of guanine Recently, an X-ray diffraction analysis of the binding of nogalamycin to a thiophospho-containing DNA hexamer indicated an even more complex ligand-DNA interaction. Apparently, local transient melting of the DNA allows intercalation of the nogalamycin chromophore with the nogalose and aminoglucose sugars simultaneously binding in the minor and major grooves at opposite sides of the helix [8] .\n\nMany compounds that bind the minor groove of DNA are potent antitumor agents. These agents change the physical characteristics of DNA and alter its ability to function as a template for DNA and RNA polymerases, but the various modes of interaction with DNA suggest that the biological activity of these drugs may not be mediated by a common mechanism.\n\nCC-1065 inhibits DNA polymerase-a and in vitro synthesis of DNA by L1210 cells, but S-phase cells are the most resistant to the lethal effect of the drug [4]. In addition, concentrations of CC-1065 that block division of tumor cells do not block progression through Sphase; instead an arrest in G2-M was observed. Effects on mitotic events following covalent binding of CC-1065 to DNA suggest that repair-related mechanisms may be important in the cytotoxicity of this agent and other groove binders that form covalent adducts. Distamycin A, bisbenzimide, and DAPI inhibit the DNA relaxing activity of mammalian topoisomerase I and, depending on concentration, stimulate or inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II [9, lo]. However, unlike camptothecin or doxorubicin [ll] , inhibition of the catalytic activity of either topoisomerase I or II in isolated enzyme reactions is not associated with DNA strand breakage. In addition to disrupting the catalytic activity of topoisomerases, minor groove binders also affect other DNA-directed enzymes. For example, the activities of DNA and RNA polymerases, DNAse I, and Sl nuclease have all been reported to be inhibited by compounds that final concentration. Following an additional 96hr bind the minor groove of DNA [2] .\n\nincubation, cells were enumerated using MIT. In this study, the antiproliferative effects of topsentin, a new marine natural product, were quantitated with cells derived from human and murine solid tumors and leukemias, and the antitumor activity of the compound was assessed with in vivo P388 and B16 murine tumor models. Incorporation studies indicated that topsentin inhibited macromolecular synthesis with a pattern similar to known DNA-active agents, and the nature of the interaction between topsentin and DNA was assessed by fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding studies. supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were cultured in plastic tissue culture flasks and kept in an incubator at 37\" in humidified air containing 5% CO,. Antibiotic-free stock cultures of P388, HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells were subcultured to lo5 cells/ml by dilution in fresh growth medium at 2-to S-day intervals. The ability of agents to induce granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 cell cultures was determined as described previously [16) . Antibiotic-free stock cultures of HT-29 and A549 were subcultured (2 x lo5 cells/T-25 flask) at weekly intervals by disas~ciation with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA (15-20min, 37\"). Every 3-4 months, stock cultures were reinitiated from frozen cells [frozen in liquid nitrogen in RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with 20% serum and 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] that were free of Mycoplusma as determined with Hoechst 33258 stain [17] . All experimental cultures were initiated in medium containing gentamicin sulfate (50 pg/mL; Schering Corp., Kenilworth, NJ).\n\nTo quantitate the effects of agents on cell proliferation1 75 yL of warm growth medium containing S mg/mL MTT was added to each well. and cultures were returned to the incubator and left undisturbed for 90 min. To spectrophotometrically quantitate formation of reduced formazan, plates were centrifuged (9OOg, 5 min), culture fluids were removed by aspiration, and 200,nL of acidified isopropanol(2 mL concentrated HCl/L isopropanol) was added per well. The absorbance of the resulting solutions was measured at 570 nm with a plate reader (MR700 Microplate Reader, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). The absorbance of test wells was compared with the absorbance of drug-free wells, and the concentration of agent that resulted in 50% of the absorbance of untreated cultures was determined by linear regression of logit-transformed data [19] . A linear relationship between P388, HL-60, HL-60/AR, HT-29, and A549 cell number and formazan production was found over the range of cell densities observed in this study.\n\nAntitumor eficacy. Compounds were dissolved in 95% ethanol, diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCI, and injected i.p. in a total volume of 0.5 mL. The efficacy of agents was expressed as the median life span of treated mice normalized as a percentage of the life span of untreated tumor-bearing mice (%T/C). The P388 lymphocytic leukemia and B16 melanoma tumor were obtained and passaged as described previously [ 161. Intraperitoneal P388 tumors were inoculated as ascites ( lo6 cells/O. 1 mL) 1 day prior to treatment, into male CD2Fl mice (Charles River, Raleigh, NC), six per group, and compounds were administered daily for 5 days (QDl-5). Time to death (mean rcr: SD, N = 18) for untreated mice was 10.2 +-1.0 days. Fluorouracil (40mg/kg; QDl-9. i.p., N = 6) administration resulted in a %T/C of 230. B16 melanoma was established by i.p. injection of 0.5 mL of a 10% tumor brei into groups of ten female B6D2Fl (Charles River) mice 1 day before therapy began. Mean time to death (*SD. N = 20) for tumor-bearing animals was 17.5 ? 2.5 days. and i.p. cis-platinum(II)diamine dichloride administration (1 mg/kg, QDl-9. N = 10) resulted in a ?/cT/ C of 156.\n\nTo assess the antiproliferative effects of agents against P388, HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells, 2OOpL cultures (96-well tissue culture plates, Nunc, Denmark) were established at 1 X lo5 cells/ml in drug-free medium or medium containing agents at various concentrations.\n\nAfter 48-hr exposures, P388 cells were enumerated using MIT (3-14,5-dimethyithiazoi-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) as described below 1183. After 72-hr exposures, HL-60 and HL-60/AR cells were also enumerated with MTT. To assess the antiproliferative effect of agents against HT-29 and A549 cells, 200 nL cultures were initiated with 4 X lo3 cells/cm* of culture area in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 24 hr, 100 ,nL of the culture fluids was removed and replaced with fresh drug-free growth or medium containing the agent to be tested at twice the Incorporation studies. The effects of topsentin on the apparent rates of protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis were assessed by measuring cellular incorporation of tritiated leucine, uridine, and thymidine from culture fluids. P388 cultures were established in 20-mL plastic viafs (2 x IO5 cells/ml. 10mL cultures), gassed with 5% CO? in air. and incubated at 37\" for 30 min in a shaking waterbath. To initiate incorporations, lo(fpL of PBS (pH 7.0, 0.8% NaCl, 0.22% NalHPOJ.7HZ0, 0.02% KH2P04, 0.02% KCI, w/w) containing [H]leutine (200 #Zi/mL), [\"Hluridine (100 nCi/mL) or [3H]thymidine (lOOnCi/mL) was added. At S-min intervals, 1 mL of the cell suspension was removed and diluted with 10mL of PBS containing the appropriate unlabeled precursor at 100 PM. Cells were collected on O.itS,um nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by vacuum filtration. and macromolecules precipitated by the addition of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Filters were extracted three times with 5 mL of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with 5 mL of water, and rinsed with 5 mL of 70% ethanol. Filters were transferred to 20-mL scintillation vials and 12 mL of scintillation fluor (Aquasol, NEN Research Products, Boston, MA) was added per vial. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Quenching was similar in all samples as determined by the ratio of counts in a narrow tritium channel and a wide 14C channel. Tritiated compounds were obtained from NEN Research Products, and were the highest specific activity available.\n\nDNA binding studies. The fluorescence spectral characteristics of topsentin in the absence or presence of 1 mg/mL DNA were measured with an LS-50 fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). Fluorescence spectra reported are uncorrected. The effects of topsentin on the binding of ethidium bromide to DNA were assessed by measuring the increase in ethidium fluorescence as DNA was added to the cuvette. Volumes of a calf thymus DNA solution (2 mg/mL) were added to solutions of ethidium bromide (1 PM) in the absence or presence of topsentin (100 PM). Slit widths were 10 nm for all experiments, and excitation and emission wavelengths were as indicated in the text. The total increase in volume due to the addition of DNA was less than 7% and increases in fluorescence were not corrected for volume changes. The effects of topsentin (100pM) on the binding of Hoechst 33342 (1 PM) were determined as described for ethidium bromide, except that the excitation wavelength was 310 nm and increases in emission were monitored at 512 nm (IO-nm slit widths). The effects of CC-1065 on topsentin binding to DNA were assessed by adding DNA (final concentration of 1 mg/mL) to solutions of topsentin (100 ,uM) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of CC-1065. The relative amounts of topsentin bound to DNA were assessed by fluorescence spectral changes (excitation = 401 nm, emission = 512 nm, slit widths = 10 nm). CC-1065 was dissolved in DMSO and solvent controls were included in all experiments.\n\nDNA unwinding. The ability of topsentin to unwind supercoiled closed circular DNA was determined as previously described [20] . Reaction mixtures (2OpL total volume) containing 50mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 120mM KCl, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgClz, 50 pg/mL BSA, and 0.2pg ColEl DNA were incubated with various amounts of topsentin or ethidium bromide for 1 hr. DNA topoisomerase I (5 units of calf thymidine enzyme, Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added and the mixture was incubated at 30\" for 30 min before the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2pL of 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. DNA was extracted with phenol, and supercoiled and relaxed forms of DNA were separated by electrophoreses in a 1% horizontal agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination.\n\nExperimental agents. Topsentin (~95% pure) used for this study was obtained from a deep water marine sponge, Spongosorites sp., as previously described Halichondriidae. [21] . The purity of topsentin (Rf= 0.75) was assessed by analytical reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (MKC-18F RP plates, 200 nm, Whatman, Clifton, NJ) with 20% aqueous methanol as the development system. CC-1065 was the gift of Dr. .l. P. McGovern, The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources.\n\nOrganic extracts of Spongosorites sp. sponges collected in the Caribbean showed significant inhibition of cultured P388 cell proliferation and herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) cytopathic effect. This activity was found by TLC HSV-1 and P388 [22] bioautography methods to be associated with a bright yellow compound present in the crude extract. Purification lead to the isolation of a bis-(indolyl)imidazole, designated topsentin (Fig. 1 ). Topsentin and certain synthetic analogs inhibit the growth of P388 cells, HSV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus and corona virus A-59 [23] . Topsentin has also been isolated from a Mediterranean sponge, Topsentia genitrix, and reported to be weakly toxic to fish [23] .\n\nAntitumor activity. Topsentin inhibited the proliferation of cultured murine and human tumor cells and showed modest activity in murine P388 and B16 in uivo tumor models. Of the cell lines tested, murine P388 leukemia cells were most sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of topsentin, while the potency for inhibition of replication of cells derived from human lung and colon tumors or a leukemia was approximately an order of magnitude greater (Table 1) . Over a range of concentrations from nontoxic to lethal, HL-60 cells exposed to topsentin did not differentiate as determined by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (data not shown). Against ascitic P388 tumors, topsentin showed modest activity on a QDl-5 schedule with a best response (150mg/kg) of 137% (Table 2) . Topsentin also showed similar activity with the i.p. B16 model (%T/C = 144, 37.5 mg/kg) with daily administration (QDl-9). Macromolecular biosynthesis. An initial characterization of the toxic effects of topsentin was made by assessing incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of DNA, RNA, and protein into acid-precipitable material of P388 cells. After 1-hr exposures to 30 PM topsentin, incorporation of [3H]thymidine and * Cells were incubated for 48 hr (P388), 72 hr (HL-60, HL-6O/AR), or 96 hr (HT-29, A.549) at 37\" in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% COr in air. Cells were enumerated with M'IT as described in Materials and Methods, and data are expressed as the micromolar concentration of topsentin that resulted in an absorbance equal to 50% of that obtained from an equivalent untreated culture.\n\nResults are the means (*SD) of 3-8 separate experiments. * Intraperitoneal P388 or B16 tumors were established 1 day prior to treatment with topsentin on a daily schedule (QDl-5 or QDl-9) as described in Materials and Methods. Data are expressed as the median time to death of six (P388) or ten (B16) treated animals normalized to the time of death of untreated tumor-bearing animals (%T)C). ND represents not determined.\n\n[3H]uridine were inhibited 91 and 60%, respectively, while incorporation of [3H]leucine was unaffected (Fig. 2) . At a lower concentration of topsentin (3 vM), effects were less, but a similar pattern was observed ( Table 3) . Inhibition of nucleic acid polymerization with less effects on protein synthesis was also observed following exposure of P388 cells to DNA binding agents such as daunomycin or actinomycin D, whereas agents that do not interact with DNA such as Ara-c or emetine show markedly different patterns (Table 3) .\n\nDNA binding studies. Since incorporation experiments suggested that topsentin interacted with DNA, fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding experiments with known DNA active compounds were undertaken. Changes in the fluorescence spectra of topsentin indicate that this agent interacts with DNA. The excitation and emission maxima of topsentin were 273 and 348 nm, respectively, while in the presence of 1 mg/mL DNA a shift in the emission maximum to 512 was observed.\n\nIn the presence of DNA, changes in the excitation spectrum of topsentin were also observed, as the excitation maximum shifted to 401 nm and a local * Cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37\" with concentrations of the agents indicated and then exposed to tritiated thymidine, uridine, or leucine for 5-30 min as described in Fig. 2 . Data are expressed as the percent inhibition of the rate of incorporation of precursor in treated cultures normalized to that incorporated in untreated cultures. maximum was observed at 301 nm. As shown in Fig.  3 , the addition of DNA to topsentin also resulted in an increase in the intensity of emitted light, with maximal changes observed at a molar base pair to topsentin ratio of 95 to 1. Competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide confirmed that topsentin interacted with DNA (Fig. 4) DNA was added to a cuvette containing 10yM topsentin (initial volume), and appropriate volumes of a 2mg/mL stock solution of DNA were added to result in the total amounts of DNA as indicated. Excitation wavelength was 301 nm and emission was measured at 512 (slit widths were 10 nm). topsentin, as described in I$ j. Excitatibn'wavelen'gth was 530 nm and emission was measured at 590 nm (slit widths were 10nm); fluorescence was not corrected for dilution. Virtually identical results were obtained when excitation and emission were monitored at 295 and 590 nm, respectively.\n\nsuggesting that intercalation did not occur (data not shown). More rigorous DNA-unwinding experiments indicated that topsentin did not intercalate (Fig. 5) .\n\nTopsentin reduced the apparent binding of Hoechst 33342 to calf thymus DNA (Fig. 6, top panel) and CC-1065 blocked increases in topsentin fluorescence in the presence of DNA (Fig. 6, bottom panel) . However, DMSO alone did alter the fluorescence spectral characteristics of topsentin. Fig. 5 . DNA unwinding in the presence of ethidium bromide or topsentin. Supercoiled closed circular DNA was treated with agents, relaxed with topoisomerase I, phenol extracted and separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels. Lane 1: supercoiled ColEl DNA standard. Lane2: SupercoiledColElDNArelaxedwithtopoisomerase I. Lanes 3 and 4: supercoiled ColEl DNA standard exposed to 1 and 2.5 ,uM ethidium bromide, respectively, before treatment with topoisomerase 1. Lanes 5-10: supercoiled ColEl DNA exposed to 12, 24, 48, 96, 192 , and 384 PM topsentin, respectively, before treatment with topoisomerase I.\n\nTopsentin is a new cytotoxic bis(indolyl)imidazole marine natural product that possesses modest antitumor activity. Incorporation experiments with whole cells indicated that topsentin interfered with nucleic acid synthesis in a manner similar to agents known to bind DNA. Changes in the fluorescence spectra of topsentin in the presence of DNA and the ability of the compound to inhibit ethidium bromide binding to DNA demonstrated that topsentin interacted with this nucleic acid. Topsentin did not change the electrophoretic mobility of supercoiled circular DNA, suggesting that intercalation did not occur. In addition, when supercoiled DNA was exposed to various concentrations of topsentin, completely relaxed with topoisomerase I, and bound topsentin removed by phenol extraction, no supercoiled DNA became apparent after electrophoresis in agarose gels. After relaxation and removal of bound drug, the final state of supercoiling depends on the number of negative supercoils removed before relaxation. The lack of supercoiled DNA following treatment with topsentin, at concentrations of DNA far in excess of those required for cytotoxicity, indicates that this agent did not intercalate.\n\nInstead, competition binding experiments with Hoechst 33342 and CC-1065 indicate that topsentin interacts with the minor groove of DNA. Direct interaction between topsentin and CC-1065 or Hoechst 33342 could explain the observations made, but results indicating an interaction between topsentin and DNA with structurally unrelated compounds suggest that this possibility is unlikely.\n\nThe marine environment has yielded novel classes of compounds with diverse biological activities [24] , but remains the largest and least chemically investigated source of new chemotherapeutic agents. Bioassay-guided isolation of compounds from a marine Spongosuri~es sp. sponge has resulted in the identification of topsentin, a new antitumor natural product that binds DNA in the minor groove. Further characterjzation of the mechanism of action of topsentin may provide a basis for structural modifications that lead to increased potency and antitumor utility."}
