{"title": "LncRNA PRINS is involved in the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes via interaction with Smad7", "body": "Changes in lifestyle, particularly in developing countries has caused an increase in the incidence of diabetes and it is expected to increase significantly in the future (1) . Diabetes is often accompanied by the development of complications that affect most major organ systems (2) . The most common diabetes-related complications include blindness, renal failure and cardiovascular disease (2) . However, one of the more serious complications associated with diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, can cause long-term kidney disease and end-stage renal disease and is a leading cause of death among patients with diabetes (3) . Although there have been significant improvements in the treatment and prevention of renal damage in patients with diabetes, patient outcomes remain poor (4) . Current treatment is focused on the prevention of disease progression (5) . Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets may improve the survival of patients with diabetic nephropathy.\n\nSmad7, which is associated with apoptosis in kidney (6) , is considered to be a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (7) . Several studies have demonstrated that under certain pathological conditions Smad7 can interact with several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a subgroup of non-coding RNAs whose aberrant expression is closely related to human diseases, to exert its biological functions (8) (9) (10) . LncRNA psoriasis-susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress (PRINS) is associated with several different types of human disease, including kidney ischemia reperfusion injury and psoriasis (11, 12) . In the current study, PRINS may be involved in the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes via interactions with Smad7.\n\nPatients. Blood samples were collected from patients with diabetes, including patients without obvious complications (n=43), patients with diabetic nephropathy (n=33), diabetic retinopathy (n=37), diabetic cardiomyopathy (n=29) and diabetic lung disease (n=38) who were diagnosed and treated at the Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College (Changzhi, China) from January 2015 to January 2018. All patients were diagnosed according to the standard established by the Chinese Medical Association (2014) (13) . All patients were diagnosed and treated for the first time. Patients with other more severe diseases were excluded. In addition, blood samples from 48 healthy control patients were also included as a control group. No significant differences in age and sex were found between the groups (Table I) .\n\nThe current study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College (Changzhi, China), and all the participants provided written informed consent.\n\nBlood sample collection, RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) . Blood samples (20 ml) were collected from each participant 24 h after admission. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol \u00ae reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop\u2122 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and RNA samples with a A260/A280 ratio of 1.8-2.0 were reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) through the following thermocycling conditions: 25\u02daC for 5 min; 50\u02daC for 20 min and 80\u02daC for 20 min. qPCR reaction systems were prepared using SYBR \u00ae Green master mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The following primer pairs were used for the qPCR: lncRNA PRINS forward, 5'-TCC ACA TCC GGA TTT ACC TAA AC-3' and reverse, 5'-CTG ACG CAC CCC TGA CAG TCA G-3'; Smad7 forward, 5'-AAG TGT TCA GGT GGC CGG ATCTCA G-3' and reverse, 5'-ACA GCA TCT GGA CAG CCT GCAGTT G-3'; and \u03b2-actin forward, 5'-GAC CTC TAT GCC AACACA GT-3' and reverse, 5'-AGT ACT TGC GCT CAG GAG GA-3'. The thermocycling conditions used for the qPCR were: Initial denaturation at 95\u02daC for 52 sec; 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 18 sec and 57.5\u02daC for 40 sec. lncRNA PRINS and Smad7 mRNA expression levels were quantified using the 2 -\u0394\u0394Cq method (14) and normalized to the internal control \u03b2-actin.\n\nCell culture and transfection. Mouse podocyte cells were purchased from PrimCells, LLC. (San Diego, CA, USA) and cultured with Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, lnc.) supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin and 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37\u02daC in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The PRINS cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification and cloned into the pEGFPC3 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountainview, CA, USA) to generate a PRINS expression vector. Cells at a cell density of 4x10 3 /ml were cultured in a six-well plate overnight before transfection. Lipofectamine \u00ae 2000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific., Inc.) was initially mixed with expression vectors (10 nM) to form transfection reagent-vector complexes, prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with transfection reagent-vector complexes at 37\u02daC for 6 h. PRINS overexpression was confirmed by RT-qPCR prior to subsequent experimentation. Cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection for subsequent experiments. In cases of D-glucose treatment, mouse podocyte cells were treated with 5 mM (control), 10, 20 and 30 mM D-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 6, 12 and 18 h, respectively, before use.\n\nMTT assay. Cell viability was analyzed using the MTT assay. Briefly, mouse podocoyte cells were collected and single-cell suspensions at a density of 4x10 4 cells/ml were prepared using Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium. Subsequently, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 4x10 3 cells/well and 30 mM D-glucose was added to each well and cells were cultured for 6 h at 37\u02daC. Following incubation, 10 \u00b5l MTT (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to each well and incubated for a further 4 h at 37\u02daC. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the optical density (OD) at a wavelength of 570 nm using a Fisherbrand\u2122 accuSkan\u2122 GO UV/Vis microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific., Inc.) and normalized to control cells (without transfection).\n\nWestern blot analysis. Total protein was extracted from cells using xTractor\u2122 buffer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and total protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay. Proteins were mixed with loading buffer and denatured at 95\u02daC for 5 min. In total, 40 \u00b5g protein/lane was separated via SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel (10%) and the separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% skimmed milk. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti human primary antibodies against Smad7 (1:2,000; cat. no. ab90086) and GAPDH (1:1,000; cat. no. ab9485; both Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4\u02daC. Following primary incubation, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. MBS435036; MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using ECL\u2122 Detection Reagent (cat. no. GERPN2105; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). Smad7 protein expression was quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.47; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and normalized to the internal control, GAPDH.\n\nStatistical analysis. Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). One-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference test was used to analyze comparisons among multiple groups. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.\n\nDifferential gene expression indicates whether a specific gene is involved in a particular biological process or disease. Initially the expression level of PRINS was detected by RT-qPCR in blood samples from patients with diabetes and healthy controls. The expression level of PRINS was significantly increased in all patient groups compared with healthy controls (P<0.05; Fig. 1 ). In addition, the expression level of PRINS was significantly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with other diabetes-related complications (P<0.05).\n\nExpression level of Smad7 increases in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The expression level of Smad7 was detected by RT-qPCR in blood samples from patients with diabetes Serum PRINS and Smad7 levels are significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes. Correlation analysis between the expression level of PRINS and Smad7 in blood samples from patients with diabetes was analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. A significant positive correlation between the relative mRNA expression level of PRINS and Smad7 was observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy (P<0.0001; Fig. 4A ). However, no correlation was observed between the expression level of PRINS and Smad7 mRNA in healthy controls (Fig. 4B) , patients without complications (Fig. 4C) , patients with diabetic retinopathy (Fig. 4D) , diabetic cardiomyopathy (Fig. 4E ) or diabetic lung diseases (Fig. 4F) .\n\nSmad7 expression in mouse podocytes under higher glucose treatment. Overexpression of PRINS in mouse podocyte cells was confirmed by RT-qPCR following transfection with PRINS expression construct (Fig. 5A) . Overexpression of PRINS significantly enhanced the expression of Smad7 protein in mouse podocyte cells (P<0.05; Fig. 5B ). In addition, Mouse podocyte cell viability under 30 mM D-glucose was examined by MTT assay and the viability of mouse podocyte cells significantly decreased following overexpression of PRINS compared with control and negative control (P<0.05; Fig. 5C ).\n\nPrevious findings demonstrated that PRINS is involved in kidney ischemia reperfusion injury (11) and allograft rejection in rat kidney transplantation (15) , and therefore PRINS serves important roles in renal damage. In addition, the current study demonstrated that PRINS may be involved in the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes, and PRINS may exert its biological function by upregulating Smad7 expression. Treatment with high glucose can affect normal metabolism in patients with diabetes, which can directly or indirectly affect the expression of a large number of lncRNAs (16, 17) . Expression patterns of lncRNAs can change depending on whether they accelerate or inhibit disease progression (16, 17) . Circulating lncRNAs can serve as signaling molecules under pathological conditions to induce systemic reactions in patients with diabetes, including insulin resistance and accelerated senescence (18) . Upregulation of PRINS was observed following acute tubule damage in rat kidney transplantation (15) . The current study demonstrated that PRINS was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls. In addition, PRINS expression was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, treatment with high glucose significantly upregulated the expression level of PRINS in a time-and dose-dependent manner in mouse podocyte cells. Therefore, the upregulation of PRINS expression may be induced by both high glucose and renal damage. In addition, the level of serum PRINS may be used to distinguish patients with diabetes with diabetic nephropathy from those without renal damage.\n\nA previous study reported that Smad7 overexpression is involved in the apoptosis of renal cells (6) , and inhibition of renal apoptosis is considered to be a potential therapeutic target in diabetic nephropathy (7) . However, Smad7 can also inhibit renal fibrosis in animal models of chronic kidney disease (19) . Furthermore, Smad7 can serve a protective role in the mouse model of chronic aristolochic acid nephropathy (20) . In the current study, the expression level of Smad7 was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls, and in particular patients with diabetic nephropathy. Previous findings demonstrated that Smad7-deficient mice developed more severe diabetic kidney injury compared with wild-type mice under high glucose conditions, and although renal Smad7 had no effect on blood glucose, it significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis and the development of microalbuminuria in the rat diabetic model (21) , indicating the protective role of Smad7 in diabetic nephropathy. The current study demonstrated that overexpression of PRINS decreased the viability of mouse podocyte cells, which are critical for renal function (22) , and enhanced Smad7 protein expression. In addition, a significantly positive correlation between the expression of PRINS and Smad7 was observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy, however, no correlation was observed in patients with ther diabetes-related complications. PRINS may therefore serve different roles in diabetic nephropathy; it may promote the apoptosis of podocyte cells and upregulate Smad7 protein expression to inhibit GF-\u03b2/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis. However, further studies are required to understand more about this complex regulatory network.\n\nIn conclusion, the expression level of PRINS was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetes, and in particular patients with diabetic nephropathy. PRINS may be involved in diabetic nephropathy by enhancing Smad7 expression and renal apoptosis."}
