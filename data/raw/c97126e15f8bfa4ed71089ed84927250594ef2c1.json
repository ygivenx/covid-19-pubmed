{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Expert consensus on the procedure of interventional diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic Interventional Oncology Branch of China Anti-Cancer Association Expert consensus on the procedure of interventional diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic", "body": "On February 17, the National Health Commission issued a report to guide local governments to strengthen medical service management amid the epidemic, maintain the routine medical order, and meet the basic medical needs of the people. According to the announcement, all areas should maintain routine medical order based on scientific prevention and epidemic control. Medical institutions should perform classified treatments according to the different patients to meet their medical needs [2] .\n\nPatients diagnosed with malignancies are undoubtedly severely affected by COVID-19.\n\nAlthough the time of the surgical procedure can be selected, there is a specific limit, and treatment, such as chemotherapy or embolization of malignant tumors, should not be delayed too long. In addition, in some emergency situations, such as tumor bleeding, surgery should be performed immediately to save the patients' lives. The Interventional Oncology Branch of the China Anti-Cancer Association formed a panel of experts to sort out and summarize the process of interventional diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. They wrote the expert consensus, hoping that the anti-epidemic and interventional tumor treatment will be coordinated and implemented in an orderly manner. Each region can execute this consensus based on their actual situation. [2] 1.1 Screen first, to identify suspected cases as early as possible Besides reviewing symptoms and vital signs (especially body temperature), COVID-19 epidemiological surveys should also be conducted on all patients in interventional clinics, wards, and operating rooms. Before admission, a chest computerized tomography (CT) and blood tests are recommended. New coronavirus nucleic acid tests should also be performed for screening, if applicable. For the suspicious cases identified in the screening process, the corresponding process should be started immediately, which includes isolation and report to a superior department in the hospital. In addition, the contact, droplet and airborne should all be isolated as recommended.\n\nFor critically ill patients, timely and effective treatment should be given following relevant regulations and guidelines. Consider ensuring performing emergency interventional surgeries, patients with rapid tumor progression or urgent treatment needs should be admitted, and surgeries performed in a timely manner following proper infection prevention and control.\n\nFor patients with elective surgeries, it is paramount to strengthen the communication with patients; elective surgeries should be arranged in an orderly manner according to both the epidemic and patients' conditions.\n\nStandard prevention should treat all patients as infectious patients to prevent the spread of both blood-borne and non-blood-borne diseases, to emphasize two-way protection between patients, companion, and medical staff. In addition to standard prevention, corresponding isolation measures should be taken according to the main transmission route of the disease, including contact, droplet, and airborne isolation. All staff, patients, and their companions in interventional clinics, wards, and operating rooms should wear surgical face masks and perform proper hand hygiene.\n\n2.1 Outpatients must make appointments by telephone or other online ways in advance before go to hospitals.. Before entering the outpatient area, patients and companions should have their temperature taken, undergo an epidemiological and symptomatic screening, and sign a legally-binding consent at the triage office. Suspicious cases will be referred to the nearest fever clinic. Patients and companions must wear surgical face masks correctly in the hospital areas at all times.\n\nInterventional radiology personnel should strictly follow the standard precautionary principles, with particular importance to personal protection, hand hygiene, ward management, environmental ventilation, disinfection of equipment, and medical waste management, etc. These measures may prevent nosocomial infections substantially. [3] . All interventional radiology personnel should wear surgical face masks during the diagnosis and treatment activities, strictly follow the outpatient consultation principle of \"one room, one doctor, and one patient,\" and minimize the staff in the consultation room. A certain distance must be kept between doctors, and patients during the consultation and close contact must be avoided as much as possible.\n\nRelevant medical personnel in triage offices should wear medical suits, surgical face masks, and surgical caps.\n\nOncology patients presenting a fever should go to the fever clinic designated by the local health department first. After COVID-19 is ruled out, the patient can go to the interventional outpatient clinic for treatment.\n\nBefore admission, patients should complete a pre-screening process in the outpatient clinic.\n\nRoutine chest CT and blood tests are recommended. New coronavirus nucleic acid tests should be performed at the same time, if applicable. Strictly follow the established admission principles. Patients can request admission to the hospital and sign a legally-binding commitment letter after COVID-19 is ruled out. The attending physician will decide whether the patient can be admitted according to his or her general condition and body temperature.\n\nMeals delivery services from outside of the hospital are prohibited, the meals should be contained in disposable containers and delivered by nursing staff. Family visits are prohibited as well. For those who require caregivers or companions due to their critical condition, this person cannot be replaced by another during the hospitalization period and must undergo the same screening process in conjunction with the same daily temperature monitoring as the patients. In principle, new admission is not allowed into the same room on the day of discharge, the whole room should be properly cleaned and disinfected. As a result, the new patient should be admitted the next day.\n\nWards are strictly managed at all times. In the following cases, entry to the ward is prohibited: \u2460 Fever (body temperature \u2265 37.3\u2103) and COVID-19 has not been ruled out in the fever clinic, or there are other suspicious symptoms, such as a cough and fatigue. If someone is found to have fever during hospitalization, the case should be notified to the fever clinic for an immediate consultation. If COVID-19 is ruled out in the person with fever, routine processes for diagnosis and treatment should be carried out. If the person with fever is suspicious of COVID-19 infection, the corresponding process flow should start immediately, and the case should be reported to the hospital administration. The patient should be transferred to the isolation ward or designated hospital as soon as possible. The ward should be strictly and entirely disinfected. In addition, anyone who had close contact with this person should be under surveillance isolation as well.\n\nStandard preventive measures, such as general ward ventilation management, hand hygiene, and correct usage of surgical face masks and caps, should be vigorously implemented. Latex gloves should be worn if necessary. Adequate protective measures for droplet, contact, and airborne isolation should be stressed. Personal protection may vary on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe consultation area should be well ventilated, with daily cleaning, and final disinfection.\n\nIt is recommended to set up an isolation unit within the interventional ward. If a patient is suspected of having COVID-19, he/she should be transferred to this isolation unit immediately.\n\nIt is recommended that the total number of patients should not exceed half of the usual number. Admitted patients are advised to have one room per person or sufficient isolation space to reduce the possibility of cross-contact.\n\nIt is recommended to adjust the ward rounds system during this particular time period; only attending physicians will attend the ward rounds. \n\n\u2460 Use disposable surgical kits, surgical instruments, auxiliary materials, consumables, etc.\n\nDuring the surgery, have available the required items for the procedure as much as possible to reduce personnel entry and exit. \u2463 Follow the best practices to prevent occupational exposure.\n\nPatients who need emergency surgeries but cannot meet the above screening conditions are considered as suspected cases of COVID-19. [3, 7] .\n\nA special interventional operating room should be set up, and a negative pressure operating room should be used if possible. Centralized air conditioning should be turned off.\n\nTo limit the frequent personnel entry and exit, prepare the necessary instruments, consumables, and medicines as much as possible for the type of surgery. The items can only be taken into the operating room rather than out. All item surfaces should be covered with double layers of disposable plastic films, which include surgical instruments, accessories, consumables, surgical beds, instrument tables, etc. Disposable plastic films should also cover other items, such as infusion racks, ECG monitors, high-pressure syringes, ventilators, etc. \n\nThe janitors must wear isolation suits, disposable hats, N95 masks, and disposable gloves to disinfect and clean the surfaces of items and the floors of the operating room. In addition, air disinfection should be carried out as well.\n\nAll medical waste should be transported in a sealed double-layer medical garbage bag and marked with the special identification of \"COVID-19,\" which will be properly treated according to strict regulations.\n\nThe infection control department must perform sampling of the surfaces and the air after proper disinfection of the surgical room. The operating room can be used again only if the sampling test is passed.\n\nAlthough the new COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic tends to curb, health care professionals should remain alert to prevent cross-infection while treating oncology patients. It is hoped that all health care professionals will fight side by side with our colleagues and work together to win the battle against both the COVID-19 epidemic and cancer."}
