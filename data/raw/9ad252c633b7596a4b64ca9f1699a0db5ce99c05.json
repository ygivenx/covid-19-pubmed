{"title": "The feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID- 19 patients: a pilot study", "body": "showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 days. These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19 while the randomized trial is warranted.\n\nSince December 2019, a pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), named as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO), emerged in Wuhan, China (1-3). The epidemic spread rapidly worldwidewithin three months and was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on March 11,2020.As of March 12, 2020, a total of80,980confirmed cases and 3,173deaths had been reported in China.\n\nMeanwhile, a total of 44,377 confirmed cases and 1,446 deaths was reported in other 108 countries or regions.Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents targeting the novel virus, while some drugs are still under investigation, including remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir (4, 5) . Although remdesivirwas reported to possess potential antiviral effectin one COVID-19 patient from the U.S., randomized controlled trials of this drug are ongoing to determine its safety and efficacy (6) .\n\nMoreover, the corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 lung injury remains controversial, due to delayed clearance of viral infection and complications (7, 8) . Since the effective vaccine and specific antiviral medicines are unavailable, it is an urgent need to look for an alternative strategy for COVID-19 treatment, especially amongsevere patients.\n\nConvalescent plasma (CP) therapy, a classic adaptiveimmunotherapy, has been applied to the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than one century. Over the past two decades,CP therapy was successfully used in the treatment of SARS, MERS, and 2009 H1N1 pandemic with satisfactory efficacy and safety (9) (10) (11) (12) . A meta-analysis from 32 studies of SARS coronavirus infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following CP therapy, compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.45) (13) . However, the CP therapy was unable to significantly improve the survival in the Ebola virus disease, probably due to the absence of data of neutralizing antibodytitrationfor stratified analysis (14) . Since the virological and clinical characteristics share similarity among SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (15) , CP therapy might be a promising treatment option for COVID-19 rescue (16) . Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 with a high neutralizing antibody titermay bea valuable donor source of CP. Nevertheless, the potential clinical benefit and risk of convalescent blood products in COVID-19 remains uncertain. Hence, we performed this pilot study in three participated hospitals to explore the feasibility of CPtreatment in 10 severe COVID-19 patients.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Among the first batch of CP samples from 40 recovered COVID-19 patients, 39 showed high antibody titers of at least 1:160 whereas only one had a antibody titer of 1:32. This result laid the basis for our pilot clinical trial using CP in severe patients.\n\nFrom January 23, 2020, to February 19, 2020, ten severe COVID-19 patients (six males and four females) were enrolled and received CP transfusion. The median age was 52.5 years (IQR, 45.0-59.5 years) ( Table 1) . None of the patients had direct exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission and CP transfusion was 6 days (IQR, 2.5-8.5 days) and 16.5 days (IQR11.0-19.3 days), respectively. Three patients were affected by clustering infection. The most common symptoms at disease onset were fever (seven of ten patients), cough (eight cases), and shortness of breath (eight cases), while less common symptoms included sputum production (five cases), chest pain (two cases), diarrhea (two cases), nausea and vomiting (two cases), headache (one case), and sore throat (one case). Four patients had underlying chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases and essential hypertension. Nine patients received arbidolmonotherapy or combination therapy with remdesivir (in one case not included in the current clinical trial), or ribavirin,or peramivir, while one patient received ribavirin monotherapy (Table 2) . Antibacterial or antifungal treatment was used when patients had co-infection. Six patients received intravenousmethylprednisolone (20 mg every 24 hrs).\n\nOn computer-assisted tomography (CT), all patients presented bilateral ground-glass opacity and/or pulmonary parenchymal consolidation with predominantly subpleural and bronchovascular bundles distribution in the lungs. Seven patients had multiple lobe involvement and four patients had interlobular septal thickening.\n\nImprovement of clinical symptomsAll symptoms inthe 10 patients, especially fever, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain, disappeared or largely improved within 1-3 days upon CP transfusion.

After treatmentwith CP, two patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation to high-flow nasal cannula and one patient discontinued high flow nasal cannula. Besides, in one patient treated with conventional nasal cannula oxygenation, continuous oxygenation was shifted to intermittent one ( Table 2) . Table 3 ). The total bilirubin (median: 12.40 \u03bcmol/L vs. 13.98 \u03bcmol/L) remained unchanged except an obvious increment in patient 1 (Fig. 2 ). An increase of SaO2 (median:93.00% vs. 96.00%), a measurement constantly performed in most patients in our trial, was found, which could indicaterecovering lung function.This temporal relationship was notable despite the provision of maximal supportive care and antiviral agents.\n\nRemarkably, patient 1, a 46-year-old male admitted on 8 dpoi, had a very quick recovery with much improved result of laboratory tests. He received antiviral drugs (arbidol and ribavirin) treatment and high flow nasal cannula on admission. Mechanical ventilation was given on 10 dpoi for critical care support. CP transfusion was performed on 11 dpoi. On 12 dpoi, the SARS-CoV-2test turned to negative, with a sharp decrease of CRP from 65.04 mg/L to 23.57 mg/L and incrementof SaO2 from 86% to 90% (Fig. 3) .

On 15 dpoi, a steady elevation oflymphocyte count and a drop ofaminopherase levelwere observed, indicating improvement ofimmunological and hepatic function.\n\ndetermined neutralizing antibody titers before and after CP transfusion in all patients except one (patient2) ( Table 4 ). The neutralizing antibody titers of five patients increased and four patients remained atthe same level after CP transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 RNA, assayed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), was positive in seven patients and negative in three cases before CP transfusion. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was decreased to anundetectable level in 3 patients on day 2, 3 patients on day 3 and 1 patients on day 6 after CP therapy.These results were in support of anneutralizing effectof CP on serum SARS-CoV-2.\n\ncontrol group was formed by random selection of10 patients from the cohort treated in the same hospitals andmatched by age, gender and severity of the diseases to the 10 cases in our trial.\n\nBaseline characteristics of patients between CP treatment group and control group showed no significant differences, while clinical outcomesof these two groups weredifferent: 3 cases dischargedwhile 7 cases in much improved status and ready for discharge in CP group, as compared to 3 deaths, 6 cases in stablized status and one case in improvement in the control group (p<0.001, Supplementary table 1).\n\nPatient 2 showed an evanescent facial red spot. No serious adverse reactions or safety events were recorded after CP transfusion.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the feasibility of CP therapy in COVID-19. All enrolled severe COVID-19 patients achieved primary and secondary outcomes. One dose of 200 mL CP transfusion was welltolerated, while the clinical symptoms significantly improved with the increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days, accompanied by rapid neutralization of viremia.\n\nSevere pneumonia caused by human coronavirus was characterized by rapid viral replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines or even cytokine storm in alveoli of lungs, resulting in acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress All rights reserved.

Recent studies on COVID-19 demonstrated that the lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood were remarkably decreased and the levels of cytokines in the plasma from patients requiring ICU support, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u0251, GM-CSF, were significantly higher than those who did not require ICU conditions (2, 18) . CP, obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients who had established humoral immunity against the virus, contains a large quantity of neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and eradicating the pathogen from blood circulation and pulmonary tissues (19) . In the present study, all investigated patients achieved serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity after CP transfusion, accompanied by the increase of oxygen saturation and lymphocyte counts, and the improvement of liver function and C-reactive protein.\n\nThe results suggested that the inflammation and overreaction of the immune system were alleviated by antibodies contained in CP. The case-fatality rates (CFRs) in the present study were 0% (0/10), which was comparable to the CFRs in SARS which varied from 0% (0/10) to 12.5% (10/80) in four non-comparative studies using CP treatment (9, (20) (21) (22) . Based on our preliminary results, CP therapy can be an easy-accessible, promising and safe rescue option for severe COVID-19 patients. It is nevertheless worth mentioning that the absorption of pulmonary lesions was often behind the improvement of clinical symptoms, as shown in patients 9 and 10 in this trial.\n\nThe first key factor associated with CP therapy is the neutralizing antibody titer. A small sample study in MERS-CoV infection showed that the neutralizing antibody titer should exceed 1:80 to achieve effective CP therapy (12) . To find eligible donors who have high levels of neutralizing antibody is a prerequisite. Cao (23) et al showed that the level of specific neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV decreased gradually 4 months after the disease process, reaching undetectable levels in 25.6% (IgG) and 16.1% (neutralizing antibodies) of patients at 36 months after disease status. A study from the MERS-CoV infected patients and the exposed healthcare workers showed that the prevalence of MERS-CoVIgGseroreactivity was very low (2.7%), and the antibodies titer decreased rapidly within 3 months (24) . These studies suggested that the neutralizing antibodies represented short-lasting humoral immune response and plasma from recently recovered patients should be more effective. In the present study, recently recovered COVID-19 patients, who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 with neutralizing antibody titer above 1:640and recruited from local hospitals should be considered as suitable donors. The median age of donors was lower than that of recipients (42.0 vs. 52.5 years). Among the nine cases investigated, the neutralizing antibody titers of five patients increased while four patients kept the same level to 1:640 within two days. The antibody titers in CP in COVID-19 seem thus higher than those used in the treatment of MERS patient (1:80) (12) .\n\nThe second key factor associated with efficacy is the treatment time point. A better treatment outcome was observed among SARS patients who were given CP before 14 dpoi (58.3% vs 15.6%; P < 0.01), highlighting the importance of timely rescue therapy (9) . The mean time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. Consistent with previous research, all three patients All rights reserved.

Notably, patients who received CP transfusion after 14 dpoi showed much less significant improvement, such as patient 10. However, the dynamics of the viremia of SARS-CoV-2 was unclear, so the optimal transfusion time point needs to be determined in the future.\n\nIn the present study, no severe adverse effects were observed. One of the risks of plasma transfusion is the transmission of the potential pathogen. Methylene blue photochemistry was applied in this study to inactivate the potential residual virus and to maintain the activity of neutralizing antibodies as much as possible, a method known to be much better than ultraviolet C light (25) . No specific virus was detected before transfusion. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) was reported in an Ebola virus disease woman who received CP therapy (26) . Although uncommon in the general population receiving plasma transfusion, this specific adverse reaction is worth noting, especially among critically illed patients experiencing significant pulmonary injury (27) .\n\nAnother rare risk worth mentioning during CP therapy is antibody-dependent infection enhancement, occurring at sub-neutralizing concentrations, which could suppress innate antiviral systems and thus could allow logarithmic intracellular growth of the virus (28). The special immune enhancement was reportedly more common in Dengue fever, but also could be found in SARS-\n\nour patients, probably owing to high levels of neutralizing antibodies, timely transfusion, and appropriate plasma volume.\n\nThere were some limitations to the present study. First, except for CP transfusion, the patients received other standard cares. All patients received antiviral treatment despite the uncertainty of the efficacy of drugs used. As a result, the possibility thatthese antiviral agents could contribute to the recovery of patients, or synergize with the therapeutic effect of CP, could not be ruled out.\n\nFurthermore, some patients received glucocorticoid therapy, which might interfere with immune response and delay virus clearance. Second, the median time from onset of symptoms to CP transfusion was 16.5 days (IQR11.0-19.3 days). Although the kinetics of viremia during natural history remains unclear, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA reduction and CP therapy, as well asthe optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies and treatment schedule, should be further clarified. Third, the dynamic changes of cytokines during treatment were not investigated.\n\nNevertheless, the preliminary results of this trial seem promising, justifying a randomized controlled clinical trial in a larger patient cohort.\n\nIn conclusion, this pilot study on CP therapy showed a potential therapeutic effect and low risk in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.

One dose of 200 mL inactivated CP with neutralization activity >1:640 was transfused into the patients within 4 hours following the WHO blood transfusion protocol.\n\nThe clinical symptoms were recorded by attending physicians daily. The blood test and biochemical tests were carried out every 1-2 days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected every 2-3 days. CT scan was repeated every 3-5 days. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiological parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The clinical symptoms improvement was defined as temperature normalization, relief of dyspnea, and oxygen saturation normalization, and the radiological improvement was defined as different degrees of absorption of lung lesions.\n\nContinuous variables were presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR).
