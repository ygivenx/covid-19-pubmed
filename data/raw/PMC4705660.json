{"title": "A general strategy to inhibiting viral \u22121 frameshifting based on upstream attenuation duplex formation", "body": "Reading-frame maintenance is crucial for translational fidelity because it ensures that codons are in the correct reading-frame of an mRNA on delivery into the A site of an elongating ribosome. However, functional translational frameshifting is programmed site-specifically into particular mRNA of a variety of mobile elements as well as viruses and a few cellular genes (1\u20137). Specifically programmed sequences and structures in mRNA can cause a fraction of elongating ribosomes to shift 1 nt in the 5\u2032-direction of mRNA, leading to a \u22121 programmed reading-frame shift (PRF), whereas a +1 frameshifting occurs when the ribosome slips toward the 3\u2032-direction by 1 nt (8). In addition to the in-frame translation products, frameshifting events thus allow the synthesis of an extra protein with its N-terminal and C-terminal regions (separated by the shifting site) encoded by the 0-frame and the shifted frames, respectively. Many viruses require \u22121 frameshifting in their decoding of crucial viral genes and rely on \u22121 PRF efficiency to control the ratio between viral proteins for optimal viral propagation.\n\nEfficient eukaryotic \u22121 PRF requires two cis-acting elements in mRNA, a slippery sequence (where frameshifting occurs) and an optimally placed downstream stimulator structure. An X_XXY_YYZ sequence in the slippery site facilitates \u22121 frameshifting by paving codon-anticodon disruption in the P and A sites of the 0-frame (XXY and YYZ codons) and codon-anticodon repairing in the \u22121 frame (XXX and YYY codons). This transition is further enhanced by resistance from the downstream stimulator (usually a pseudoknot or a hairpin) to the duplex unwinding activity of ribosome, leading to interference in the translocation step of an elongation cycle (9\u201313). Additionally, the spacing nucleotide number between the slippery site and downstream stimulator affects \u22121 PRF efficiency because it helps positioning the slippery site in the A and P sites of an elongating ribosome while the downstream stimulator approaches the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome (14). It has been proposed that tension is created between the unwinding stimulator and the codon-anticodon interaction network anchored around the ribosomal P and A sites, and the shift to \u22121 frame relieves the tension and overcomes the ribosomal pause imposed by the stimulator (14\u201316). Interestingly, base-pairing interaction between an internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence upstream of the frameshifting site and anti-SD sequence in 16S ribosomal RNA also acts as a frameshifting regulator in 70S ribosome (17,18). This could be due to the tension or a translation pause mediated by the upstream SD\u00b7anti-SD mediated duplex (19).\n\nMutagenesis in viral \u22121 PRF signals to change \u22121 PRF efficiency has been shown to impair the replication of several viruses, including HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting that viral \u22121 PRF regulation is a potential antiviral means (20\u201322). Given the crucial role of \u22121 PRF for efficient viral replication, different strategies have been developed to target viral \u22121 PRF stimulators to explore potential antiviral applications. Small ligands capable of interfering with viral \u22121 PRF activity by binding with the downstream \u22121 PRF stimulators of HIV and SARS-CoV have been identified either by screening or structure-based design (23\u201325). Alternatively, antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) targeting the viral \u22121 PRF stimulator pseudoknot has been shown to impair the replication of an SARS-CoV replicon (26). For both approaches, the functional characterization of a viral \u22121 PRF stimulator is required and this may represent a bottle-neck in combating emerging epidemic viral pathogens such as the MERS-CoV (27).\n\nRecently, an RNA hairpin upstream of the \u22121 frameshifting site of the SARS-CoV has been shown to attenuate \u22121 PRF depending on hairpin stability and an optimal spacer length between the slippery site and hairpin (28,29). This unique upstream hairpin represents the first cis-element capable of downregulating eukaryotic \u22121 PRF activity and understanding its functional mechanism should provide insight into the mechanism of \u22121 PRF regulation with antiviral application potential. As the upstream attenuation hairpin is unwound by the ribosome before the ribosome encounters the downstream stimulator, it has been proposed that the refolding dynamics of the hairpin is responsible for its \u22121 PRF attenuating activity (29). Here, we found that an RNA\u2013DNA duplex formed by annealing antisense DNA to its complementary mRNA sequence upstream of a \u22121 PRF slippery site could attenuate \u22121 PRF to a similar extent as that of an upstream hairpin attenuator. That the cis-formed upstream hairpin can be replaced by a trans-formed duplex suggests upstream duplex formation is the determining element in \u22121 PRF attenuation. This finding is reminiscent of frameshifting regulation by SD\u00b7anti-SD mediated short upstream duplex in 70S ribosome (17,18), providing insight on the functional mechanisms of upstream \u22121 PRF attenuation in 80S ribosome. Furthermore, we apply this upstream duplex attenuator to counteract several viral \u22121 PRF signals to demonstrate its general application potential as an alternative \u22121 PRF inhibition approach. Thus, inhibiting \u22121 PRF by antisense-mediated upstream duplex provides a potentially quick antiviral solution to the emerging highly pathogenic coronaviruses and an opportunity to sequence-specifically regulate \u22121 PRF related cellular events.\n\nWe used two different \u22121 PRF reporters to analyze frameshifting efficiency in this study. The p2luc recoding reporter (30) was a gift from Professor John Atkins at the University of Utah, and was used in radioactivity based in vitro translation as well as dual-luciferase based measurement in both in vitro translation and 293T cells for frameshifting efficiency calculation. Additionally, a variant of p2luc was engineered to facilitate radioactivity based \u22121 PRF activity analysis in vitro. The variant contains a premature \u22121 frame stop codon 33 nt downstream of the BamHI site of p2luc, and will be translated into a shortened \u22121 frame product in reticulocyte lysate (31).\n\nThe \u22121 PRF elements used in this study, containing different viral downstream \u22121 PRF stimulators and upstream sequences flanking the slippery sites, were constructed by assembling different pieces of chemically synthesized DNA oligonucleotides with partially overlapping sequences via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based ligation approach (32). Forward and reverse DNA primers, respectively carrying SalI and BamHI restriction sites and appropriately designed annealing sequences, were used for PCR amplification of the cDNAs encoding viral \u22121 PRF elements of interest. The amplified inserts encoding distinct viral \u22121 PRF signals were then cloned into the SalI/BamHI sites of appropriate \u22121 PRF reporters. Cloning was performed using standard procedures and the resultant recombinant \u22121 PRF reporters were trans-formed into the DH5\u03b1 strain of Escherichia coli cells for maintenance and selection by ampicillin. Mutagenesis was introduced into the desired position using the quick-change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. Identities of all cloned and mutated \u22121 PRF elements were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis.\n\nSynthetic RNAs used in this study were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase with designed DNA templates using in vitro transcription method (33). The transcribed RNAs were purified by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 M urea and the gels of bands containing desired RNA were cut out and electro-eluted using a BIOTRAP device (Schleicher & Schuell). The eluted RNAs were ethanol precipitated and recovered by centrifugation. Antisense DNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and purchased from Mission Biotech, Taiwan, whereas the 2\u2032 OMe-modified RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from TriLink BioTechnologies, Inc., USA. The concentration of all oligonucleotides was determined by UV absorbance.\n\nThe 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) on 10-cm dishes to 90% confluency. Cells were then transferred to 15-cm dishes, incubated to 90% confluency and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached by trypsinization using trypsin-EDTA (0.05% Trypsin with 2 mM EDTA, Gibco). After stopping trypsinization with medium containing 10% FBS (Corning), the detached cells were centrifuged at 1000 g at 4\u00b0C to pellet the cells. The cell pellet was washed twice with PBS and re-suspended with hypotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH7.5), 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM Magnesium acetate, 2 mM dithiothreiol (DTT) and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Re-suspended cell pellets were incubated on ice for 45 min and homogenized through a 1 ml syringe using 26 G, 3/4-inch needle (34). After centrifugation at 14 000 g for 1 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant containing cell lysate was collected with the contents of protein concentration measured by Bradford assay (Biorad), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nHuman embryonic kidney HEK-293T cells were cultured as described above. One day before the transfection, 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 105 HEK-293T cells per well were plate in a 24-well culture plate with 1000 \u03bcl growth medium. Transfection was carried out, by adding a mixture of 0.5 \u03bcg plasmid DNA and jetPEI\u2122 transfection reagent (Polyplus) into each well, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity measurements for transfected 293T cell lysates were performed as described below.\n\nCapped viral \u22121 PRF reporter mRNAs were prepared using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE high-yield capped RNA transcription kit (Ambion) by following manufacturer's instructions. Reticulocyte lysate (Ambion) as well as human 293T cell lysate was used to generate shifted and non-shifted protein products for frameshifting analysis. For radioactivity-based assay in reticulocyte lysate, a total of 5 \u03bcl reaction containing 100 ng of capped reporter mRNA, 2.5 \u03bcl of translation lysate and 0.2 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcCi/\u03bcl 35S-labeled methionine (NEN) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1.5\u20132 h The in vitro translation samples were resolved by 12% sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to a phosphorimager screen for quantification after drying. Frameshifting efficiencies were calculated, by dividing the counts of the shifted product by the sum of the counts for both shifted and non-shifted products, with calibration of the methionine content in each protein product. We presented all of our radioactivity-based in vitro \u22121 PRF results in term of relative \u22121 PRF activity and the ribosome drop-off effect (30) was removed by this procedure. In vitro dual-luciferase based \u22121 PRF assay was performed in reticulocyte lysate or human 293T cell lysate as described in each experiment. For a 10 \u03bcl in\nvitro translation reaction using 293T cell lysate, the reaction contained \u223c5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl cell lysate and 500 ng of RNA templates in a translation buffer of 20 mM HEPES, pH7.6, 80 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM Magnesium acetate, 1 mM ATP, 0.12 mM GTP, 20 mM creatine-phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 mM DTT, 0.15 mM spermidine and 400 U/ml RNasin (Promega) (35). The reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h. Luciferase activity measurements were performed using the Dual Luciferase\u2122 reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a CHAMELEON\u2122 multi-label plate reader (HIDEX). Frameshifting efficiency was then calculated according to previously described procedures with read-through controls (30).\n\nThe purified RNA transcripts were treated with rAPid alkaline phosphatase (Roche) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (Promega) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to remove the unlabeled 5\u2032-phosphate. After the inactivation of phosphatase by incubation at 75\u00b0C for 2 min, 32P -\u03b3ATP (Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche) were added and the reaction continued for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. The 32P -labeled RNAs were purified by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and recovered by crush and soak procedures. After ethanol precipitation, the labeled RNAs were recovered by centrifugation. To analyze RNA\u2013DNA interactions, labeled RNA probes (10 000 CPM per reaction) were incubated with various amounts of antisense DNA in a final volume of 10 \u03bcl of 1\u00d7 TBE buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA. The RNA\u2013DNA complexes were heated at 80\u00b0C and annealed for 30 min at 30\u00b0C. The reactions were then mixed with 2 \u03bcl of 40% sucrose as the loading buffer and loaded into a 20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acryl:bisacryl ratio) in 0.5\u00d7 TBE (Tris-boric acid-EDTA) run at a constant voltage of 150V at 4\u00b0C for EMSA analysis. The results were visualized by autoradiography using a Typhoon FLA7000 phosphorimager (GE).\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed in triplicate and the relative frameshifting activity was reported as one standard deviation from the mean. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in each set of data (without or with different amounts of antisenses) was performed. Datasets with an F-value bigger than the critical values from a lookup table for \u03b1 = 0.05 and P-value smaller than \u03b1 were then further analyzed by pairwise comparisons to compute the smallest significant difference (LSD) with a t-test. Additionally, extra experimental data sets were obtained for MERS \u22121 PRF assay in human 293T cell lysate with or without 10 \u03bcM of 2\u2032 OMe-modified RNA antisense and compared with those of a read-through control (Supplementary Figure S6) to perform a statistical analysis suggested for dual-luciferase based assay (Figure 6B) (36).\n\nWe have demonstrated that the formation of an upstream attenuator hairpin can be controlled by alternate base-pairing schemes to achieve \u22121 PRF activity regulation (31). Aiming for sequence-specific regulation of \u22121 PRF, we designed DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032-half (6BPGC-5\u2032-DNA) or the 3\u2032-half (6BPGC-3\u2032-DNA) sequences of the stem of a potent \u22121 PRF attenuator hairpin (6BPGC) (29) (Supplementary Figure S1A) to interfere with attenuation hairpin refolding. Each antisense DNA was designed to form either 19 or 20 bp with its complementary upstream RNA target to generate RNA\u2013DNA duplexes of similar stability (37). We then measured the effect of each antisense on attenuation efficiency of a \u22121 PRF reporter (6BPGC-SARSPK) containing the upstream 6BPGC attenuator hairpin and a downstream SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF pseudoknot stimulator (30). The \u22121 PRF attenuation was tracked by decreased \u22121 PRF efficiency, which was observed from decreased \u22121 frame or/and increased 0 frame translation products upon antisense addition in a \u22121 PRF assay. Interestingly, addition of 6BPGC-5\u2032-DNA resulted in a dose-dependent loss of 6BPGC attenuator activity consistent with antisense-mediated attenuation hairpin disruption, whereas addition of 6BPGC-3\u2032-DNA did not suppress attenuator activity of 6BPGC (Figure 1A and B). This means that \u22121 PRF activity can be oppositely controlled in-trans by antisense DNA oligonucleotides designed to target either side of the stem region of an upstream attenuator hairpin, providing a way to sequence-specifically regulate \u22121 PRF.\n\nOne possible explanation of the observed opposite effects in attenuation activity modulation between the two antisense oligonucleotides is that the accessibility for trans-duplex formation is different between the two sides of the refolding hairpin stem in the presence of a nearby ribosome. Alternatively, the opposite effects may have been caused by the difference in spacing from the slippery site between the two antisense-mediated RNA\u2013DNA duplexes, given that proximity plays an important role in the attenuation efficiency of a cis-formed attenuator hairpin (29). Consistent with the later explanation, addition of an antisense DNA (restore DNA), with sequences complementary to the 3\u2032-stem of an impaired attenuator hairpin (6BPGC5\u2032WT) (Supplementary Figure S1B), led to enhanced attenuation of \u22121 PRF efficiency of a reporter (6BPGC5\u2032WT-SARSPK1) containing 6BPGC5\u2032- WT in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C and D). As the impaired attenuator hairpin shares the same 3\u2032-stem sequences to those of 6BPGC, this result also rules out the accessibility issue. Thus, these findings indicate that an upstream duplex needs to be proximal to the slippery site for efficient \u22121 PRF attenuation and suggest that the duplex in a proximal upstream hairpin stem is the functional unit responsible for \u22121 frameshifting attenuation.\n\nTo see if there is a minimal requirement for duplex length of an effective upstream attenuation duplex, three antisense variants (restore DNA23, restore DNA18 and restore DNA13) with the potential of forming RNA\u2013DNA duplex of 23, 18 and 13 bp were designed with spacing to the 0-frame E site being kept as 0 to prevent E-site invasion occurring (38) (Supplementary Figure S1C). The \u22121 PRF attenuation activity of the shortest upstream duplex declined dramatically while being compared with that of the longest upstream duplex (both mediated by 10 \u03bcM of antisenses) (Figure 2A and B). Although the proximity requirement of a functional upstream \u22121 PRF attenuation duplex in Figure 1A and B suggests that the observed \u22121 PRF attenuation is not the result of ribosomal drop-off during translational elongation of a ribosome, the loss of observed \u22121 PRF attenuation activity by a shorter upstream duplex in Figure 2A and B implies that the observed \u2018\u22121 PRF attenuation\u2019 by restore DNA23 could have been caused by drop-off effect mediated by the longer upstream duplex (39). In particular, the gel based assay may not resolve the potential upstream duplex-mediated drop-off product from the 0-frame translation product. Eventually, this could result in the amount of 0-frame product being overestimated, leading to underestimation of \u22121 PRF efficiency. To address this issue, we created a new construct (6BPGC5\u2032WT-SARSPK2) with the 0-frame stop codon being moved further downstream of the slippery site (Supplementary Figure S1D) to help distinguishing 0-frame products from the potential drop-off products that should appear within upstream mRNA sequences targeted by the antisenses. The trend in \u22121 PRF attenuation efficiency for upstream duplexes of different lengths using the 6BPGC5\u2032WT-SARSPK2 construct is similar to that of the one used in Figure 2B in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of antisenses (Figure 2C and D), indicating upstream duplexes of sufficient length do act as a \u22121 PRF attenuator. We noted that the attenuation efficiencies of antisense-mediated upstream duplexes in Figures 1 and 2 were not dramatic (but statistically significant) in the presence of 1 and 10 \u03bcM of antisenses because they were calculated from constructs carrying 6BPGC5\u2032WT hairpin that possesses residual \u22121 PRF attenuation activity. Nevertheless, these results confirm that the \u22121 PRF attenuation effect can be generated in-trans by an antisense DNA-mediated upstream duplex proximal to the slippery site.\n\nPreviously, we have shown that an upstream \u22121 PRF attenuation hairpin could downregulate \u22121 PRF stimulated by distinct downstream stimulators (29). To see if the upstream duplex can be used to attenuate viral \u22121 PRF stimulators other than that of SARS-CoV, we compared the frameshifting efficiencies of several viral \u22121 PRF pseudoknot stimulators, including mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), simian retrovirus (SRV) and a hairpin stimulator derived from SRV pseudoknot (40\u201342) (Supplementary Figure S2), in the presence of different amount of antisense targeting upstream sequences (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Surprisingly, we found that significant \u22121 PRF attenuation was observed in the presence of 1 \u03bcM of antisenses by comparing with those in Figures 1 and 2. It could be explained by the less stable structures formed upstream of the slippery sites in the current reporters. By contrast, the amount of \u22121 frame product translated from a read-through control (p2luci) was not affected. Furthermore, the \u22121 PRF activities can be attenuated to different extents by designed antisense DNA of different complementarities to the sequences upstream of the slippery site. For example, 10 \u03bcM of restore DNA23 was needed to attenuate \u22121PRF to similar extent as that of 0.1 \u03bcM of SRV 5\u2032 as (Figure 3E and F) because restore DNA23 forms less base pairs with the upstream sequences. Taken together, these results indicate that the upstream duplex approach provides a general means of downregulating \u22121 PRF activity stimulated by distinct types of downstream stimulators in vitro.\n\nTo explore the potential of upstream duplex-mediated \u22121 PRF attenuation in anti-viral applications in human coronavirus (hCoV), we analyzed sequences upstream of the slippery sites of six known hCoVs and found a potential hairpin stem upstream of the \u22121 PRF slippery site of 229E-CoV in addition to the one characterized in SARS-CoV (Supplementary Figure S3A and B). However, the \u22121 PRF activity of a shortened p2luc reporter containing the 229E upstream hairpin and an SARS-CoV pseudoknot was not attenuated as efficiently as that by the SARS-CoV attenuator hairpin (Supplementary Figure S4A\u2013C), and could be explained by the less stable free energy of the 229E upstream hairpin predicted by Mfold (43). We then asked if an antisense-mediated duplex can compete with the predicted 229E upstream hairpin to generate a potent \u22121 PRF attenuator in a duplex form. EMSA experiments indicated an isolated 229E upstream RNA hairpin (Supplementary Figure S4D) forming a complex with an antisense DNA (anti-229E) that targets the 3\u2032-side sequences of the hairpin (Supplementary Figure S4E), suggesting the formation of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the addition of anti-229E led to higher \u22121 PRF attenuation activity than the cis-formed 229E viral attenuator hairpin alone in a full-length p2luc-based \u22121 PRF reporter (Supplementary Figure S4E and S4B). Thus, pre-existing local conformations upstream of \u22121 PRF slippery site can be programmed by the antisense approach to generate a functional \u22121 PRF attenuator in the form of a trans-formed duplex.\n\nAn antisense approach has been applied to disrupt the downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator of SARS-CoV (26). However, the success of this approach requires characterization of the boundary of the downstream stimulator. Such information may not be available for a new outbreak pathogen, such as the MERS-CoV (27). Indeed, we found that both a SARS-CoV type 3-stems pseudoknot (28,44\u201346) and a 229E type kissing hairpin pseudoknot (47) might exist downstream of the UUUAAAC \u22121 PRF slippery site of the MERS-CoV (48) (Supplementary Figure S5A and B). Additionally, two \u22121 PRF reporters containing sequence deletions of MERS-CoV \u22121 PRF signal that block the formation of either pseudoknot (Supplementary Figure S6) possessed substantial \u22121 PRF activity both in vitro and in 293T cell (Figure 5 A\u2013D), suggesting that both pseudoknots may function during viral replication although the contribution of either pseudoknot to viral \u22121 PRF activity requires further study. 2\u2032 OMe-modified RNA was used to evaluate the viral \u22121 PRF attenuation activity of the antisense-mediated upstream duplex in human cell lysate because DNA antisense would be digested in crude cellular lysates. We found that a 2\u2032 OMe-modified antisense RNA oligonucleotide capable of mediating upstream duplex formation (Supplementary Figure S6A) efficiently downregulated the in vitro \u22121 PRF activities of the MERS-CoV viral sequence capable of forming alternative downstream stimulators in a dosage-dependent manner in human 293T cell lysate, whereas the attenuation effect was neutralized by the co-existence of an anti-antisense (Supplementary Figure S6A and Figure 6A). A more rigorous statistical analysis recommended for p2-luc based assay (36) using 10 \u03bcM of 2\u2032 OMe-modified antisense RNA and a read-through control led to a similar extent of inhibition (Figure 6B). Therefore, targeting the sequence upstream of the slippery site represents an efficient and straightforward approach to viral \u22121 PRF inhibition because detailed knowledge of the downstream stimulator boundary is not required. This approach should be useful in looking for quick therapeutic solutions to emerging pathogens such as the MERS-CoV.\n\nA stable structure could act as a roadblock to cause ribosomal drop-off in addition to stimulating \u22121 PRF. Accordingly, a frameshifting pseudoknot can prohibit a significant fraction of frameshifted ribosomes that it stimulated from reaching the \u22121 frame stop codon. Eventually, it leads to the compromise of observed \u22121 PRF efficiency (49). By contrast, the trans-formed \u22121 PRF attenuator duplex identified in this work is upstream of the slippery site and the potential ribosomal drop-off effect mediated by the duplex should occur before the ribosome reaches the slippery site. While the drop-off effect could lead to under-estimation of \u22121 PRF efficiency if the drop-off products could not be distinguished from the 0-frame products, the observations from experimental design that moves the 0-frame stop codon away from the location of upstream duplex (in Figure 2C and D) clearly clarified the role of upstream duplexes in \u22121 PRF attenuation. Furthermore, both a cis-formed upstream hairpin (29) and a trans-formed duplex (this work) can act to attenuate \u22121 PRF stimulated by a variety of downstream stimulators in 80S ribosome systems, suggesting both attenuators could share the same \u22121 PRF attenuation mechanism.\n\nPreviously, a ribosomal E site adjacent duplex formed between an internal SD-like element upstream of the slippery site and the anti-SD sequence of 16S rRNA was shown to attenuate prokaryotic \u22121 frameshifting efficiency in E. coli (18). By contrast, internal SD can promote release factor 2 (RF2)-dependent +1 frameshifting when placed adjacent to the ribosomal E site (20). Such an opposite role in \u22121 and +1 frameshifting regulation led to the suggestion of a tension-mediated mechanism in frameshifting stimulation (19). Alternatively, such effects could be caused by the elongation pausing mediated by an internal SD\u00b7anti-SD interaction during the elongation of 70S ribosome (50). Interestingly, we have previously shown that an upstream hairpin can stimulate +1 frameshifting in yeast in addition to attenuating \u22121 PRF in an in vitro 80S translation system (29). The mechanism of in-cis refolding hairpin as well as trans-formed upstream duplex in eukaryotic frameshifting regulation may thus be relevant to that of the duplex formed between internal SD and 16S rRNA in prokaryotic frameshifting regulation, given that formation of a duplex upstream of the slippery site is involved in all these cases. However, moving the attenuator hairpin 5\u2032 further (29) did not enhance \u22121 PRF efficiency in the same manner as SD-like stimulator element did (18). A possible reason for this difference is that the internal SD-mediated duplex involves the 16S ribosomal RNA component of 70S ribosome and is part of the translational machinery, whereas the eukaryotic ribosome lacks an anti-SD sequence. Due to such a difference between 70S and 80S translation systems, the antisense-mediated upstream duplex identified in this work could simply act as a wheel chock to block \u22121 ribosome movement triggered by downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator mediated tension effect (14\u201316).\n\nThe stimulation mechanism of \u22121 PRF was best analyzed in the 70S ribosome system (13,51\u201353) and single-molecule experiments have linked the existences of downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator structures to the modulation of several molecular events within a translocation cycle (51\u201353). Ongoing works will test if a trans-formed upstream duplex can replace the functionality of an internal SD\u00b7anti-SD interaction in the 70S ribosome for frameshifting regulation aimed for establishing a link between 70S and 80S ribosome in frameshifting regulation via upstream duplexes of different forms. The effects triggered by downstream stimulators during translocation cycle (51\u201353) could then be examined in the presence of an upstream duplex to help illustrating the mechanisms of both stimulation and attenuation.\n\nOutbreak of the SARS-CoV at Asia in 2013 was followed by the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 10 years later. Both virologists and epidemiologists predict that there will be more and more novel human coronaviruses emerging due to rapid mutation of viral genomes and the zoonotic features (54\u201355). Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine for SARS or MERS. Therefore, the development of an antiviral strategy for rapid response to the emerging coronavirus infection is important.\n\nAntiviral approaches against viral \u22121 PRF have been targeting on the downstream stimulators (20\u201322). Although small-molecule drugs provide uptake advantage, detailed structural information of the stimulator RNA is needed for this approach. Unfortunately, no high resolution \u22121 PRF stimulator structure of hCoV is available. Recently, three-dimensional RNA structure modeling of SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF stimulator pseudoknot in combination with computer-aided drug library modeling and screening have helped identifying potential leads for the inhibition of SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF (25). However, the proposed binding pocket of the leads seems to be specific for SARS-CoV pseudoknot stimulator (25).\n\nAn alternative approach using complementary PNA to disrupt SARS-CoV \u22121 PRF stimulator pseudoknot has also achieved antiviral effects and suppressed the propagation of SARS-CoV replicon when tagged with a cell-permeable peptide that facilitates cellular delivery (26). However, such an approach still requires information on the viral \u22121 PRF stimulator boundary and may not be deliverable in time. By contrast, the upstream duplex approach provides a more straight-forward means of inhibiting \u22121 PRF dependent viral pathogens than targeting the viral downstream stimulator and should be applicable as soon as the slippery sequence information of an emerging hCoV is available. Furthermore, the finding of antisense DNA-mediated upstream duplex in \u22121 PRF inhibition in in vitro translation systems should make early stage analysis much more affordable and accessible because expensive modified oligonucleotides are not needed.\n\nAlthough nucleic acid-based therapy is still in its infancy, recent positive results in applications of modified oligonucleotides to against expanded trinucleotide repeats in Huntington's disease in vivo (56) and to protect post-exposure of the lethal Ebola virus infection (57) have demonstrated its powerful potential as a therapeutic agent. The processes aimed at facilitating cellular delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutic agents using different oligonucleotide modifications or lipid nanoparticles also show promising results (58\u201359). With doubt over the delivery of safe vaccines against coronaviruses (60\u201361), the ability to attenuate viral \u22121 PRF in-trans by antisense-mediated duplex upstream of a viral slippery site thus provides a general strategy to quickly inhibit viral \u22121 PRF and replication of emerging human coronaviruses."}
