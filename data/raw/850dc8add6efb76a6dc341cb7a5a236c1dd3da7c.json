{"title": "Expanded skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients", "body": "recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility 5 . DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues, such as skin 6 . Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity as compared to healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection. \n\nViruses are a significant and abundant component of the human microbiome 7, 8 . Advances in sequencing purified viral-like particles, shotgun metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics have provided the ability to unearth novel viruses 7, [9] [10] [11] . In previous human skin microbiome studies, healthy skin demonstrated low viral representation [1] [2] [3] , with bacteriophage dominating the skin virome. Known skin-associated eukaryotic DNA viruses include human papillomaviruses (HPV), human polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) 2,12-14 .\n\nWhile landmark studies have shown that microbiota activate and educate host immunity [15] [16] [17] [18] , the role of the immune system in shaping microbial communities and its contribution to disease is less well-characterized. Studying primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients provides a unique perspective on the degree to which altered immunity may influence the human microbiome, and, how in turn, microbiota may interact with the host to drive disease. Skin-associated bacterial and fungal communities of PID patients displayed increased ecological permissiveness with decreased site specificity and temporal stability 19 . We sought to investigate the potential eukaryotic virome composition and stability in a PID patient population with a high frequency of severe, recalcitrant cutaneous and systemic viral infections. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive, combined immunodeficiency within the spectrum of hyper-IgE syndromes 5 . In addition to recurrent cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections, these patients can suffer from severe food allergies with anaphylaxis, eczematous dermatitis with bacterial skin infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and cancer susceptibility. The cutaneous viral-associated manifestations of DOCK8 deficiency include molluscum contagiosum, herpesvirus infections, and warts (HPV infections) along with atopic dermatitis (Fig. 1a and 5 ).\n\nTo explore viral diversity capable of colonizing human skin, we collected 188 total skin samples from multiple body sites of 27 DOCK8-deficient patients ( Table 2 ). These shotgun metagenomics microbial reads were mapped to a multi-kingdom reference database and compared with similar skin metagenomics data from five representative healthy volunteers (3 adults and 2 children 1, 20 ) . Skin microbiome of healthy adults and children is dominated by bacteria with low viral abundance (8.7% mean phage abundance and 6.4% mean eukaryotic viral abundance (Supplementary Table 3) , also in 3, 20 ) . By contrast, DOCK8-deficient patients' skin displayed a significantly higher relative abundance of eukaryotic viruses (mean relative abundance 92.6 \u00b1 9.2, p = 0.00061, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 4 ). Three DOCK8-deficient patients (patients D8_pt23, D8_pt24 and D8_pt27) with >25% of metagenomics reads mapping to the bacterial kingdom also had less severe systemic complications associated with DOCK8 deficiency in the first two decades of life. Skin-associated bacterial and fungal communities of DOCK8-deficient patients demonstrated similar diversity and composition when compared to healthy controls, based upon shotgun metagenomics, bacterial amplicon (V1-V3 of 16S rRNA gene) and fungal amplicon (ITS1 region) datasets ( Supplementary Fig. 1b, 1c and 19 ).\n\nFive viral families were present on the skin of DOCK8-deficient patients with predominance of Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae ( Fig. 1c -d, Supplementary Table 5) . Papillomaviridae (4 HPV genera with 48 species, 149 types) was abundantly observed in a majority of patients; Polyomaviridae (11 of 13 known species from three genera) was highly abundant in 3 subjects and Poxviridae (MCV) in two individuals (Fig. 1c , Supplementary  Fig. 2a , 2b, 2c and Supplementary Table 6 ). Herpesviridae (5 genera, 8 species including cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1)), Anelloviridae (6 genera, 30 species), and bacteriophage were found in low relative abundances with a wide range in prevalence ( Supplementary Fig. 2d , Supplementary Table  7 -8) . In comparison to high relative abundances of viruses on DOCK8-deficient patients' skin, oropharyngeal swabs and stool samples from these patients did not demonstrate high viral abundances (data not shown).\n\nOur reference-based analyses revealed a large, but variable fraction of unmapped reads (10.3%\u221298.8%, mean 46.7%). To explore our hypothesis that unmapped reads represented novel viral genomes, we performed reference-free de novo assembly of filtered reads from each skin sample after subtracting mapped bacterial and fungal reads. From this large dataset, 10,435 contigs were eukaryotic viruses with high coverage; of which 8,631 contigs were from the Papillomaviridae family. To identify novel viral genomes, all (near-complete) papillomavirus genomes (6-8 kb) were screened against the reference Papillomavirus Episteme (PaVe) database and then clustered at 95%, which resulted in 250 non-redundant HPV genomes ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Incorporating these HPV genomes into our reference genome database contributed to a significant increase in mapped reads from 53.3% \u00b1 20.1 to 72.3 \u00b1 18.8% (p<2.2e-16). At one extreme, the percentage of mapped reads increased from 1.2% to 92% with inclusion of new HPV genomes, illuminating skin microbial 'dark matter' (Supplementary Fig. 4a Supplementary Table 9 ). Three additional eukaryotic viral contigs were novel genotypes of ssDNA Torque teno virus, a genus of Anelloviridae ( Supplementary   Fig. 4b) , with 76-82% nucleotide identity with the closest reference genome for the gene used for phylogenetic classification ( Supplementary Fig. 4c) 21 .\n\nCharacterizing HPV diversity on DOCK8-deficient skin HPV genomes are classified based on nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the capsid protein L1, the most conserved protein in the Papillomaviridae family. HPV genomes of the same genera share >60% L1 similarity; same species share >71% L1 similarity; and same types share >90% L1 similarity 22, 23 . Of the 250 assembled and clustered HPV genomes, 205 shared 71-89% identity to a reference HPV L1 sequence, thus representing novel HPV types. 45 genomes showed 60-70% identity to any reference HPV L1 sequence but shared >71% similarity amongst themselves, representing 45 novel types of a new HPV species (Supplementary Table 10 ). 229 of the 250 novel HPV genomes belonged to gamma genus of HPV; 19 HPV genomes belonged to beta genus; and 2 HPV genomes belonged to mu genus ( Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Prior, the mu genus of HPV included only three members with three distinct species, and our genomes supplemented one of the species with two additional types.\n\nWhen mapping skin microbiome reads to previously existing reference HPV genomes, the mean relative abundance of the beta genus was significantly higher than the gamma genus (p = 0.0014, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) on DOCK8-deficient patients' skin. With the addition of the novel HPV genomes, beta and gamma genera were similarly abundant (Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. 6a and 6b) . Overall, novel HPV types outnumbered reference HPV types detected on DOCK8-deficient patients, both in children and adults (Fig. 2c , p = 3.3e-4, 1e-6, respectively). The total number of HPV types detected on each patient increased significantly upon addition of novel HPV genomes (p = 8.2e-10, Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 11 ), regardless of patient's age or site of sampling, with one patient colonized with over 345 different HPV types ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 6c ). Intra-individual (site-tosite) similarity exceeded significantly inter-individual similarity at the same site for DOCK8-deficient patients for both HPV community membership and structure (p = 0.00051, Fig. 2e ). The trend of viral intra-individual similarity rather than site-tropism was similarly observed in healthy volunteers 3 .\n\nTo assess longitudinal stability of viral communities on DOCK8-deficient patients' skin, we collected skin swabs from two body sites (popliteal crease/Pc and retroauricular crease/Ra) of seven patients over time. Time intervals between samplings varied from 1 to 60 months. The vast majority of the shotgun metagenomics reads derived from these samples mapped to Papillomaviridae (Fig. 3a) . Patient D8_Pt04 had a significant increase in the relative abundance of MCV at the second time point on both skin sites (Fig. 3a) , which correlated with clinical findings (Fig. 3b) . Intra-personal similarity between time points was higher than inter-personal similarity, reflecting the overall stability of the virome (p=0.00032) (Fig.  3c) . However, there were notable changes in five of the seven patients who both gained and lost at least five HPV types (Fig. 3d) . Some of these HPV types were at modest levels but decreased from both sites simultaneously; e.g. D8_Pt04 lost HPV9 on both Pc and Ra, decreasing from 0.3 to 0 and 0.8 to 0%, respectively; and D8_Pt21 gained HPV15, with relative abundance increasing from 0.07 to 0.3 and 0 to 0.5% on Pc and Ra, respectively (Supplementary Table 12 ).\n\nWhile severe recalcitrant cutaneous DNA viral infections in DOCK8 deficiency suggested an expanded DNA virome, the increased incidence of viral infections in general prompted us to examine the RNA virome. We overcame the technical hurdle of extracting sufficient biomass for sequencing from non-invasive skin samples and collected a total of 207 skin and nares swabs from DOCK8-deficient patients; within-patient samples were combined based on skin physiology and/or anatomical proximity to achieve sufficient RNA for sequencing (see Methods for details). We generated 31 Gbp of rRNA-subtracted, microbial RNA-Seq data from four combined skin sites of nine DOCK8-deficient patients (Supplementary Table  13 ). The majority of viral RNA reads mapped to DNA viruses, mostly Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae (Supplementary Table 14) , which may indicate active viral replication. The relative abundance of the genera of polyomaviruses and papillomavirus detected in the RNA and DNA datasets were highly similar ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). The nares of DOCK8deficient patients revealed colonization with several RNA viral families, including members of Coronaviridae (Coronavirus species), Picornaviridae (Rhinovirus, Enterovirus and Kobuvirus species), Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza) and Paramyxoviridae (Parainfluenza) (Fig. 4a ). Using reference-free de novo assembly of viral and unmapped RNA reads, we identified contigs with 85-97% identity to distinct reference Human Rhinovirus (HRV) genomes, in multiple samples from three different patients. From these, we constructed two full genomes of putative novel Rhinoviruses variant and genotype (RhinovirusA genome detected in a single patient and a RhinovirusB genome detected in two other patients), with 89% and 80% nucleotide identity to the closest genotype (A60 and B93), respectively, at the VP1 gene used for phylogenetic assignment ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ). One DOCK8-deficient patient exhibited high relative abundances of Rubella virus, whose genome carried signature mutations of the vaccine strain. Among the nine patients who had RNA viruses detected in their nares, five had undergone clinical lab testing for respiratory pathogens with 3/5 positive results directly corresponding with clinical lab results (D8_Pt16, D8_Pt19, D8_Pt21). The other two patients had negative clinical tests and notably lower relative abundances (less than 0.5%) of Rhinovirus (D8_Pt20) and Parainfluenza (D8_Pt20, D8_Pt21).\n\nDOCK8-deficient patients exhibited marked phenotypic heterogeneity. We investigated whether the presence of cutaneous warts or molluscum contagiosum lesions was associated with the relative abundances of HPV and MCV viral reads, respectively. The mean percentages of HPV and MCV reads were statistically significantly higher in the presence of any cutaneous warts (mean 89% HPV reads) and any molluscum contagiosum lesions (mean 8% MCV reads), respectively, as compared to absence of these cutaneous lesions ( Fig. 4b  and 4c ). However, even in the absence of any clinical warts, the DOCK8-deficient patients harbored high relative abundances of HPV reads (mean 52%). In contrast, the mean relative abundances of MCV reads in patients without clinical molluscum contagiosum lesions was quite low (mean 0.4%). The differences in the subclinical presence of HPV versus MCV viruses suggests biological distinctions between these eukaryotic viruses with patient skin demonstrating less susceptibility to MCV carriage than HPV carriage.\n\nThe presence and contribution of viruses to the human microbiome have been underappreciated. This shotgun metagenomics study of a rare patient population has elucidated the selective increases in the diverse viral communities capable of inhabiting human skin, which would not be possible by analyzing healthy individuals due to their low viral abundances. The expansion of the skin virome in this immunodeficient patient cohort underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling host eukaryotic viral colonization and infection. The infectious complications in these immunodeficient patients are similar to the infection risks in immunosuppressed patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). The viral reactivation observed in the setting of HSCT has been described in virome studies in the gut and blood 21, 24, 25 .\n\nOur metagenomics analyses in this unique patient cohort have facilitated our ability to identify novel viruses and investigate microbial dark matter. Previously, studying rare patient populations led to the discovery of the first two Beta HPV members (i.e. HPV5 and HPV8) in patients with the rare disorder of epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a recessive disease with an increased susceptibility to HPV infections and squamous cell carcinoma 26 . Expanding the knowledge of HPV diversity may promote the development of computational tools for predicting and assigning unknown sequences from metagenomics surveys and of molecular assays for rapid identification of viruses with oncogenic potential, like some members of the HPV community. As DOCK8-deficient patients are susceptible to squamous cell cancers, future studies may be able to address whether HPVs detected on DOCK8deficient skin have oncogenic potential.\n\nStudying the microbiome with shotgun metagenomics has enabled transkingdom explorations. In the manner that the Human Microbiome Project has focused attention on the beneficial role played by human-associated bacteria, might there also be commensal or beneficial viruses? Recent elegant studies have elucidated that the virome plays a role in the outcome of an immune response to a vaccine challenge 27 . Some evidence of mutualistic interactions between viruses and plants, insects and even mammalians exists 28 , but the underlying mechanisms of these interactions still need to be explored. This study reveals another aspect of the intricate interactions between the immune system and microbiome, demonstrating how a specific underlying immunodeficiency may affect the transkingdom equilibrium, thus pointing to the role that the immune system plays in shaping the microbial communities in the human body.\n\nTwenty-seven DOCK8-deficient patients (17 adults and 10 children, mean age 16.0 + 6.1 years) were recruited to participate in a study approved by the institutional review board of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT00605878), which complied with all ethical regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all adult patients and parents or guardians of all participating children. Patients were diagnosed with DOCK8-deficiency based on targeted gene sequencing and immuno-blotting 5,6 . Subjects provided medical and medication history and underwent a physical examination. For shotgun metagenomics sequencing, 8 skin sites representing diverse physiological characteristics were sampled: moist (antecubital crease (Ac), inguinal crease (Ic), popliteal crease (Pc), plantar heel (Ph)), dry (hypothenar palm (Hp), volar forearm (Vf)), sebaceous (manubrium (Mb) and retroauricular crease (Ra)). For RNAsequencing, swabs from adjacent anatomical sites or similar physiological characteristics were combined to provide sufficient biomass. The sites sampled and combined were Ra and occiput (Oc) representing the head, Ac/Pc/Ic representing moist creases, Ph and toe web (Tw) representing the foot, and nares (N). Patient metadata is presented in Supplementary  Table 1 . Negative control swabs were collected for each patient visit.\n\nDNA isolation and library preparation to generate shotgun metagenomic sequence data from skin sites were performed as previously described with a target of 15 million to 50 million 2 \u00d7 125-bp reads on an Illumina HiSeq 1 . In total, for DNA metagenomics sequencing from 27 patients sampled at up to eight body sites, we obtained 202 skin swabs and 2.74 billion reads (or 281 Gbp) of non-human, quality-filtered paired end reads (median 2.23 million reads (or 217 Mbp) per sample, Supplementary Table 2) .\n\nSamples for RNA extraction were collected in Yeast Cell Lysis Buffer (Lucigen) and treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Buffer AVL, from QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), was added along with linear acrylamide (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 15 min and processed according to manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was DNAse (Qiagen) treated on column and eluted with 40 \u03bcl of DEPC-treated water. RNA was fluorometrically quantitated on the Qubit (ThermoFisher) and cDNA was synthesized and amplified using Ovation RNA-seq system V2 (Nugen). From 26 patients sampled at nine body sites, we obtained 207 skin swabs, combined according to above description to 116 samples and 329 million reads (or 31 Gbp) of non-human, quality-filtered reads, non rRNA paired end reads (median 717,000 reads (or 65 Mbp), Supplementary Table 13 and  Supplementary Table 15 ) per sample). To remove rRNA reads, all RNA microbial reads were mapped against the SILVA database of bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal rRNA using SortMeRNA 29 (Supplementary Table 15 ) and non-rRNA reads were written out and were used for further taxonomic classification. DNA and RNA preparations varied in biomass and composition. For example, human-derived DNA and RNA accounted for 74 % and 53% of reads on average (respectively, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 14) . For RNA-Seq, 73% of the reads on average represented ribosomal RNA (eukaryotic / bacterial) (Supplementary Table 15 ).\n\nDOCK8-deficient patient sequencing libraries were prepared based on a previously described strategy 30 . The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the modified primers 27F-(5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and 534R-(5' -ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG). The ITS1 region was amplified using the modified primers 18S-F (5\u2032-GTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTC) and 5.8S-1R (5\u2032-GTTCAAAGAYTCGATGATTCAC). 16S and ITS1 amplicons were generated and processed as previously described 30, 31 and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Amplicon sequencing data was processed using the mothur pipeline 32 as previously described 19, 31 . Briefly, 16S sequences were preprocessed to remove primers and barcodes and subsampled to 5,000 sequences per sample. Chimeras from PCR artifacts were identified and removed using VSERACH in Mothur 33, 34 . Remaining sequences were classified down to the genus level using RDP training set 16. ITS1 amplicon sequences were trimmed to 200bp and subsampled to 5,000 reads per sample in Mothur. Sequences were then classified to the genus level using the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier against an updated custom ITS1 database 35 . Phylotype analysis for both 16S and ITS1 amplicon sequences was performed according to Mothur MiSeq SOP (https:// www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP).\n\nTaxonomic classifications were performed as previously described 1 . Quality processed reads not matching human hg19 human reference were mapped against a database of 2349 bacterial, 389 fungal, 4695 viral and 67 archaeal reference genomes using Bowtie2's (version 2.3.2) --very-sensitive parameter 36 . Read hit counts were normalized by genome size. To reduce the effects of low abundance misclassifications, we used a genome coverage cutoff of \u2265 1 for relative abundance and diversity calculations.\n\nMetagenomic reads not mapping to bacterial, fungal or archaeal reference genomes were exported using the --un-conc parameter of Bowtie2 36 . DNA or RNA reads from each sample separately (mean of 6 and 1.2 million reads per sample, respectively, representing 90% of mean microbial DNA reads and 80% of RNA microbial reads per sample), were used in de novo assembly of viral genomes using SPAdes genome assembler (version 3.9) with --meta parameter for DNA data and --rna parameter for RNA designed to handle metagenomics or RNA sequencing data, respectively, with k-mer lengths of 21, 33, 55, 77 37, 38 .\n\nA total of 349,919 contigs were assembled from the filtered DNA reads (Supplementary  Table 16 ). Only contigs larger than 750 nt were selected for further quality filtration using PRINSEQ 39 to discard low entropy contigs (-lc_threshold 70) and extreme GC content (below 25% or above 75%). The filtered 227,924 filtered contigs were assigned to a taxon based on the BLASTN best hit (BLAST+ suite v2.6.0 40, 41 ) against the nt database (requiring that the best hit cover \u2265 25% of the contig). 10,435 contigs were assigned to eukaryotic viruses, 1189 contigs assigned to phage, 125,755 contigs had non-viral assignments (mostly bacteria). 90,545 contigs were unassigned under these parameters but were re-assigned using a more flexible set of parameters (best hit, but without a threshold for query coverage), and were mostly bacterial.\n\nOf the 10,435 viral contigs, 8631 of the contigs belonged to the Papillomaviridae family. To identify divergent Papillomavirus genomes, we eliminated the coverage requirement and identified another 183 contigs as likely Papillomaviridae based on contig size (~7 kb) and L1 typing. A similar search for divergent Polyomaviridae returned no additional contigs. From 8914 Papillomaviridae contigs, we subsetted 3725 contigs that were within a size range of 6-8 kb, which is the similar to the size of an average HPV genome (~7.9 kb). These genomes were masked using an HPV reference downloaded from the PaVe database ( 42 and www.pave.niaid.nih.gov) to remove all regions \u2265500 nt with more than 90% identity by BLASTN. Genomes with \u22654000 nt unmasked were kept, resulting in 2189 genomes. Papillomaviridae have circular genome which is problematic for alignment-based clustering algorithms so the mash algorithm 43 was used instead to build a graph of 95% identical contigs which were then clustered using SPICi 44 . This threshold was set in order to remove redundant genomes but still retain genomes that are distant enough to represent distinct HPV types. This clustering resulted in 208 cluster seeds and 42 singletons genomes, yielding a final pool of 250 non-redundant HPV genomes. Using BLASTN to compare the 250 nonredundant genomes to themselves we verified that their nucleotide identity between cluster representatives did not exceed 90%.\n\nThe remaining 1804 contigs assigned to non-Papillomaviridae eukaryotic viruses were clustered at 99% using CD-HIT 45, 46 , and masked against our viral database (masking parameters as described above). This resulted in 23 Poxviridae contigs which were mostly masked, 6 Herpesviridae contigs (in size range of 750-1800 nt), all assembled from the same sample (patient D8_Pt21) which mapped to Cytomegalovirus genomes not included in our database, and 4 Anelloviridae contigs (Supplementary Fig. 4b) . Three of the Anelloviridae contigs (in the genus Torque teno virus) were assembled from two samples from patient D8_Pt13 with contigs size of 1980, 1270 and 1599 nt. The fourth contig was assembled from a sample from a different patient (contig size 1357 nt, D8_Pt11). These contigs were amplified by PCR using targeted primers from the original DNA extracted from the skin swab and sequences were verified with Sanger sequencing. Due to low coverage of these contigs we were not able to amplify and assemble a complete genome of these putative novel Anelloviruses. A novel anellovirus genotype has been defined as the ORF1 gene having <90% shared nucleotide identity when aligned to any reference genotype, whereas designation as a novel anellovirus species requires <50% sequence identity. Assembled contigs were aligned to reference genomes in our viral database using Muscle 47 v3.8.31 to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses ( Supplementary  Fig. 4c ). The resulting alignment was used to construct a Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, using FastTree 48 v2.1.9 and visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ figtree/). Unassigned contigs (90,545) were assigned to best protein hit using the BLASTX mode against the nr database and most partially matched to bacterial or phage proteins. RNA reads filtered from rRNA, human, bacterial and fungal reads were de novo assembled in the same manner. However, since rRNA reads represented a significant portion of the data, some of the samples had a very low number of reads (with lowest sample having only 35,331 filtered reads). As a consequence, the assembly yielded a large number of contigs (625,306) , with only about one-third of them passing quality filtration (206,371) (Supplementary Table 17 ). Of these, 122,771 were assigned according to our contig analysis pipeline and only 24,217 were a hit to viral genome. Almost all viral contigs were assigned to DNA viruses (mainly Papillomaviridae), in accordance to the high abundance we detected in read mapping both from DNA and RNA data. 1458 contigs were assigned to RNA viruses. We detected several contigs from the Rhinovirus family, in patients D8_Pt16, D8_Pt21 and D8_Pt22. Contigs from patient D8_Pt16 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus A60, and contigs from patients D8_Pt21 and D8_Pt22 were identified as a variant of Rhinovirus B97. The Picronaviridae study group defines novelty of a Rhinovirus genotype by the coding sequence of the conserved VP1 gene, with slight differences of between the species; an HRV type should have at least 13 % (HRV-A) or 12 % (HRV-B) nucleotide divergence from all other HRV types. Nucleotide divergence lower than this threshold have been used to assign new variants of a genotype 49, 50 . With primers designed at terminal contig sequences and cDNA derived from the original patient RNA, we amplified across the gaps, Sanger sequenced and assembled two complete novel Rhinovirus variant and genotype (~7 kb), as classified by the conserved VP1 protein 49, 50 (Supplementary Fig.  7b ). Contigs that were unassigned at first were blasted again with adjusted parameters in Blastn and Blastx modes against the non-redundant databases and predominantly were partially matched to bacterial or eukaryotes genomes and proteins.\n\nTaxonomic classification of papillomaviruses is based on nucleotide similarity of the L1 gene 51 . The family Papillomaviridae contains 49 genera (with 5 genera representing human papillomaviruses), each of them is further divided into several species. To be designated as a new type, a single PV type cannot share >90% similarity to any other known PV type in the L1 sequence. PV types within a species share 71-89% nucleotide identity within the L1 gene and members of the same genus share > 60% L1 sequence identity 22, 23 . Taxonomic classification of the 250 novel HPV genomes assembled from reads and meeting the size criteria described above (6-8 kb) was performed using the L1 taxonomy tool available on PaVe website (https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/#analyze/l1_taxonomy_tool) (Supplementary Table  10 ). 205 out of the 250 novel genomes were depicted as novel types, exhibiting less than 90% identity to any reference HPV genome and 45 genomes were depicted as members of a single novel species, as their L1 sequence shared 60-70% with any reference HPV and 71-89% identity when compared amongst themselves. All 45 members of the novel species were verified by targeted PCR to the L1 region from the original DNA extracted from the skin swabs, as well as additional 10 genomes, classified as novel HPV types, that were not represented in clusters (and were part of the 41 singletons genomes in the clustering process).\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of the HPV L1 gene was extracted from all novel HPV genomes using NCBI's orfFinder tool 52 . All HPV L1 nucleotide sequences of reference HPV genomes (as determined by International Human Papillomavirus Reference Centre) were downloaded from the PaVe database ( 42 and www.pave.niaid.nih.gov). All L1 sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 47 and the resulting alignment was used to construct a Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, using FastTree v2.1.9 48 . The tree was visualized with with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).\n\nMCV abundance, subtype and coverage were determined using Clinical Pathoscope 53 and a database of five complete MCV genomes (U60315, KY040275, KY040276, KY040277, KY040274). MCV-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called against U60315 using Snippy (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) with default parameters on samples with at least 15x coverage of the MCV-1 genome (49 samples, 10 subjects). Core SNPs were called using the snippy-core program (244 core SNP positions). A histogram of SNPs positions identified uneven SNP coverage, indicative of recombination. Gubbins 54 was used to analyze recombination blocks between MCV-1 genomes and identified one block centered on the MC054L gene, which encodes a putative IL-18 binding protein 55, 56 . Of the two DOCK8-deficient patients who do not display clonal carriage, D8_Pt08 showed two distinct MCV-1 strains, each exclusive to distinct body sites and D8_Pt15 exclusively carries MCV-1 at two body sites and MCV-2 at three other body sites, demonstrating the potential for localized skin colonization from distinct subtypes. A phylogenetic tree was built based on SNPs outside these recombinant regions.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed in R software. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean unless otherwise indicated. Spearman correlations of non-zero values were used for all correlation coefficients. For all boxplots, center lines represent the median, lower and upper box limits represent the first and third quartiles, respectively (interquartile range), whiskers represent the maximal values up to 1.5x of interquartile range, and all values beyond this range are defined as outliers. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine statistically significant differences between microbial populations. Unless otherwise indicated, P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni or FDR correction (by applying the p.adjust function in R using method = \"bonferroni\" or \"fdr\"). Statistical significance was ascribed to an alpha level of the adjusted P-values \u2264 0.05. Similarity between samples was assessed using the Yue-Clayton theta similarity index with relative abundances of HPV species. The theta coefficient assesses the similarity between two samples based on (1) number of features in common between two samples, and (2) their relative abundances with \u03b8 = 0 indicating totally dissimilar communities and \u03b8 = 1 identical communities 57 .\n\nDetailed information on experimental design and reagents can also be found on the accompanying Life Sciences Reporting Summary. herpes simplex viral infection on the lips of D8_Pt16; warts on the hand of D8_Pt17; severe eczema behind the knee of D8_Pt12; and large molluscum contagiosum on the knee of D8_Pt18. b, Skin microbiome of DOCK8-deficient patients (n=27) and healthy volunteers (HV) (n=5) classified at the kingdom level. Shotgun metagenomics data presented as mean relative abundance of total mapped microbial reads (normalized to genome length) from all sampled bodysites, per patient. c, Mean relative abundance of viral families identified on a, A total of 405 HPV types on all DOCK8-deficient patients' skin (n=27), categorized as reference (155) or novel (250) types classified by species and genus. Each genus is depicted by a different color; pie slices represent different species within a genus and lighter shades represent new HPV types within the species. Numbers around the pie refer to the HPV type count. b, Skin microbiome of individual DOCK8-deficient patients: the mean relative abundances of HPV types incorporating novel HPV genomes. Relative abundance scale is on the axis of D8_Pt26. Color code as in a. c, Boxplots showing that mapping skin shotgun metagenomics reads to reference database, which includes novel HPV genomes, significantly increases the number of HPV types detected in children (n=10) and adults (n=17) throughout all sampled skin sites (n=188 biologically independent samples, twosided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). d, Number of HPV types classified at the genus level detected in each patient. e, Boxplots showing mean theta similarity index of inter-and intrapersonal pairwise similarity of skin sites of DOCK8-deficient patients (n=188 biologically independent samples from all skin sites, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test), comparing HPV species detected at relative abundance >0.1%. Theta value of 1 indicates identical HPV community structure. All boxplots are the median with the interquartile range, and the error bars are the 1.5-times interquartile range (whiskers). sampled longitudinally. 1 and 2 represent baseline and follow-up timepoints (first and second visit), respectively. Patients are ordered by months (mo.) between samplings (from shortest to longest). b, Absence (baseline) and presence (follow-up, 60 months) of molluscum contagiosum on the face of D8_Pt4. c, Boxplots showing mean theta similarity index of inter-and intra-personal pairwise similarity of patients at baseline and follow-up timepoints (n=28 biologically independent samples, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test), comparing HPV species detected in relative abundances >0.1%. All boxplots are the median with the interquartile range, and the error bars are the 1.5-times interquartile range (whiskers) and outliers (points). d, Longitudinal changes include gain and loss of HPV types (for types with relative abundance > 0.1%) and are patient-specific. Duration of time between sampling timepoints is shown in parentheses next to each patient (measured in months). Numbers on bars represent count of HPV types at first baseline sampling. a, Relative abundance heatmap of human RNA viral species detected in DOCK8-deficient patients' nares. b, Boxplots comparing mean percent of HPV reads and patients that presented with any warts on their skin (n=27 patients, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). c, Boxplots comparing mean percent of MCV reads and patients that presented with any molluscum contagiousum lesions on their skin (n=27 patients, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-"}
