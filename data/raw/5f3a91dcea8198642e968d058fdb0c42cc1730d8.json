{"title": "Czech et al. 1 Octa-repeat domain of the mammalian prion protein mRNA forms stable A-helical hairpin structure rather than G-quadruplexes", "body": "Notations: R g , radius of gyration; D max , maximum size of the particle; V p , excluded volume of the hydrated particle; MM , molecular mass; \uf063 \uf032 ab values for the fit from ab initio models using DAMMIN.\n\nSupplementary Fig. 1 . Native agarose gel electrophoresis of wt and \u0394G4 PrP octa-repeat mRNA.\n\nDifferent salts promote oligomerization of wt and \u0394G4 PrP octa-repeat mRNA. MgCl 2 addition causes fragmentation of RNA."}
