{"title": "GENERAL US POPULATIONS AT RISK", "body": "Diseases caused by waterborne microbial agents continue to be a leading environmental concern, and are responsible for human morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Freshwater microbes annually are responsible for four billion cases of diarrhea (2.2 million deaths), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Poor hygiene that is associated with use of unclean water has resulted in an estimated 200 million schistosomiasis infections, with six million cases of blindness worldwide. 1 Freshwater sources, historically, have been associated with epidemics: during the 1800s in the United States there were eight major cholera outbreaks (caused by Vibrio cholerae) and three typhoid outbreaks (caused by Salmonella typhosa).\n\nThe fear of historically important waterborne infectious diseases like cholera and typhoid fever has been eliminated or substantially reduced in developed countries today, mostly due to sewage treatment and implementation of water treatment and delivery systems. However, even chlorinated drinking water is not sterile, and many people work in occupations with considerable exposure to water containing wastes. In addition, molecular diagnostic methods and DNA-based biodiversity studies are revealing that old pathogens are causing new problems, and novel microbes are being discovered in every setting. Epidemiologic reports have led to the recognition of emerging waterborne pathogens. As part of its regulatory role, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Drinking Water prepares a list of 25 priority pollutants for scrutiny and research. In March of 1998, the agency published its Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List in the Federal Register. 2 It was notable that ten of the 25 pollutants of concern were micro-organisms: Acanthamoeba, Adenoviruses, Aeromonas hydrophila, Caliciviruses (Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses), Coxsackieviruses, Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), Echoviruses, Helicobacter pylori, Microsporidia (e.g., Cyclospora cayetanensis), Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare.\n\nHumans and animals are exposed to microbes throughout their lives in work, home, and recreational environ-ments. To be responsible for disease in humans or other animals, any one of these agents must be present in sufficient concentration to produce disease (infectious dose) and a susceptible host must come into contact with contaminated water. 3 Those that are waterborne are transmitted by drinking/eating, dermal/mucosal contact, or aerosol inhalation. Waterborne pathogens can also become foodborne when food is grown or prepared using water containing pathogenic microbes. Foodborne disease organisms are tracked by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Foodborne and Diarrheal Branch. 4 Eleven of the 16 foodborne diseases under surveillance by the CDC are also waterborne microbes.\n\nWaterborne microbial pathogens belong to three major groups: bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic. These microbes cause a wide variety of diseases, including acute gastrointestinal, upper and lower respiratory, meningitis, myocarditis, dermatitis, cirrhosis, bacteremia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (see also Chapter 22) . Because diseases vary greatly in severity, the US characterizes pathogens as Notifiable, Select, or Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) agents. Notifiable agents require notification of state public health physicians; the specific agents reported may vary from state to state. Waterborne Notifiable disease agents include Cryptosporidium parvum, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Giardia intestinalis, Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, Poliovirus, and agents such as Shigella sonnei, which causes dysentery. 5 have been linked to newly identified pathogens such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli O157, Giardia, hepatitis A, Legionella, Naegleria, Acanthamoeba, Norwalk virus, Pleisiomonas shigelloides, Pseudomonas, and Schistosoma spindale. Improvements in sanitary infrastructure, including waste water treatment and drinking water protection, have drastically reduced the burden of waterborne disease, as well as the number of outbreaks. However, massive waterborne disease outbreaks continue to occur. The largest recent waterborne outbreak involved more than 400,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. 7 Another waterborne outbreak in Washington County, New York, in 1999 8 resulted in 148 cases of E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni infections. Outbreaks of waterborne illness have been associated with drinking water as well as recreational exposure to swimming pools, and natural water (bodies containing fresh and salt water).\n\nAgents posing the greatest waterborne disease potential are transmitted through the fecal-oral route (Table 54.1) . Consequently, prevention from diseases associated with these organisms is accomplished by protecting drinking water sources and recreational waters from contamination with human or animal waste. On the other hand, a limited number of waterborne pathogens (e.g., Legionella spp., Vibrio spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are indigenous to the water environment. Control of these agents and their potential infections is dependent on controlling exposure to water containing these organisms or by treating the water to remove or inactivate the infectious agents.\n\nDuring the period 1991-1998, there were 81 outbreaks of waterborne disease associated with drinking water. 6 Of these, 41 were described as 'acute gastrointestinal illness' (AGI) of unknown etiology. The flagellated protozoan parasite Giardia was the leading causative agent for 15 of the remaining 40 outbreaks. Giardia was the leading cause of waterborne outbreak in the preceding ten-year period as well. Another eukaryotic parasite, Cryptosporidium parvum, was the next leading cause (Table 54. 2), accounting for ten of the 40 outbreaks. However, C. parvum accounted for the largest number of cases due to waterborne pathogens, mainly due to the Milwaukee outbreak that involved more than 400,000 cases. Shigella sonnei and E. coli O157:H7 each was responsible for four outbreaks. Two outbreaks were attributed to Shigella flexneri and the remaining five outbreaks were attributed one each to: Salmonella typhimurium, Pleisiomonas shigelloides, non-O1 Vibrio cholerae, hepatitis A, and a 'small round structured virus'. The low number of waterborne outbreaks of infectious disease is a tribute to the success of water treatment processes, especially the final disinfection and maintenance of residual disinfectant in the distribution systems. It is to be mentioned that while bacterial and viral pathogens are controlled effectively by the current disinfection processes, a successful control regimen for pathogens such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium involves the use of alternative disinfection technologies, such as ozonation and ultraviolet treatment, prolonged contact time with chlorine, and efforts to protect the source waters from resistant pathogens.\n\nThe larger list of agents associated with recreational water outbreaks reflects the higher diversity of organisms present in untreated, natural waters (Table 54. 3). In the period 1990-1998, 14 ,962 cases of disease associated with recreational water exposure were reported to the CDC. [9] [10] [11] [12] Pseudomonas spp. were consistently reported every year during this period as a causative agent in 607 cases. However, the largest number of cases, 10,269, were (Table 54. 3). Microbial hazards associated with marine and estuarine environments are discussed in the next section. The risk associated with recreational exposure to pathogens has been assessed in epidemiologic studies by comparing disease or symptom incidence rates for swimmers versus non-swimmers, or swimmers exposed to recreational waters with varying levels of microbial pollution. Pruss 14 reviewed 22 published epidemiology studies and concluded that there was agreement in a strong association of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and exposure to waters containing enterococci, fecal streptococci, thermotolerant coliforms, and E. coli. Pruss' conclusion, based on evaluating epidemiologic designs, was that enterococci and fecal streptococci were the most reliable indicator organisms for GI symptoms associated with exposure to marine and fresh waters; and that E. coli was a reliable indicator organism in fresh water and nearly as reliable as enterococci in marine waters. The observed illness threshold values described in the studies evaluated by Pruss were low for the enterococci and fecal streptococci and higher for the thermotolerant coliforms. 14-16 As a practical matter, the methodologies for recovery of these indicator organisms are not precise when applied to environmental water samples. Consequently, the higher threshold values for the E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms [17] [18] [19] are a more pragmatic yardstick for predicting the causal relationship between swimming and illness.\n\nSwimming pools are frequently the setting for infectious disease outbreaks. Factors determining microbiologic water quality of swimming pools include the free chlorine concentration and pH, as well as the rate of water filtration and recirculation. Wading pools used by infants and other children prior to toilet training are often the site of disease transmission. The shallow depth and relatively low water volume in these pools leads to faster disinfectant depletion rates (due to the effects of ultraviolet light) and a higher concentration of organic matter following accidental bowel movements. 20 A variety of eukaryotic, viral and bacterial pathogens are transmitted through swimming pools. Cryptosporidium, one of the most important waterborne pathogens of the past decade, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] is a frequent cause of recreational water-borne outbreaks 21 (Table 54. 2). The persistence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in swimming pools is due to the extreme resistance to inactivation by chlorine and inadequate filtration by conventional pool filters. 22 Outbreaks of conjunctivitis due to a variety of Adenovirus serotypes, gastroenteritis due to exposure to Norovirus, Enterovirus, or enterobacteria such as Shigella spp. and Escherichia coli are often linked to inadequately chlorinated pools.\n\nExposure to a diverse group of micro-organisms, including diatoms, dinoflagellates, microalgae, as well as blue-green algae (a bacterial species), has been linked to mild to severe neurologic and gastrointestinal complaints in coastal and estuarine environments throughout the world. Marine micro-organisms may be free-living, or associated with a variety of fish and shellfish species. Clearly, foodborne transmission for these agents is an important means of exposure, but the role of recreational or occupational exposure to these micro-organisms has been suspected and is being evaluated.\n\nScromboid, amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) follow the ingestion of fish or shellfish contaminated with marine micro-organisms. In these diseases, microbial contamination leads to the accumulation of toxic compounds producing a variety of neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms. The diseases are encountered throughout the world, at a low rate. The CDC estimates 30 cases per year and one fatality per four years in the USA. 4 Diagnosis is usually based upon symptoms and history of shellfish consumption. In most cases, treatment is limited to supportive care; however, specific therapies are available for scromboid and CFP.\n\nIndividuals exposed to coastal waters risk contact to marine micro-organisms through recreational or occupational exposure to the environment. Marine micro-organisms or their toxins may be ingested or contact skin and mucous membranes. Air-borne transmission of aerosolized microbes or toxins is also possible. Environmental exposure may play a role in the transmission of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) as well as possible estuary associated syndrome (PEAS).\n\nNSP is primarily thought of as a foodborne illness associated with the consumption of shellfish caught during red tides, which are blooms of a marine dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis (formerly Gymnodinium breve), that regularly occur along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the USA. A K. brevis toxin, brevetoxin, is responsible for NSP symptoms, which include altered sensations in the mouth and extremities, dizziness, loss of co-ordination, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Brevitoxin may also be aerosolized when it is released from cells by lysis or excretion and incorporated into marine aerosol by wind and breaking surf along the coast. 23 Air samples taken during red tide conditions along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of Florida, as well as the Atlantic coast of North Carolina, were measured at 160-180 ng/mm 2 . 23 The CDC is currently conducting a study to assess the health effects of exposure to aerosolized red tide agent. 5 Another disease in which recreational or occupational exposure is thought to be potentially involved is PEAS, which is associated with two species of marine dinoflagellate, Pfiesteria piscicida and P. shumwayae. Pfiesteria has been implicated in massive fish kills occurring in estuaries along the southeastern Atlantic coast of the USA. Fish and shellfish located at the site of Pfiesteria blooms are lethargic, disoriented, and contain ulcers. 24 Although water-soluble Pfiesteria toxins are hypothesized to exist, none have been isolated and characterized in the laboratory, or detected in the environment, and a recent report challenged the notion that P. shumwayae even has the capacity to produce dinoflagellate-like toxin. 25 Studies documenting the effects of Pfiesteria species on humans originated with observations of respiratory, gastrointestinal, optical, and neurologic symptoms following exposure to aerosol in a laboratory. 26 Subsequent retrospective epidemiologic investigations have compared the health status of symptomatic individuals in contact with Pfiesteria blooms to controls. 27, 28 Mild flu-like illness as well as learning and memory difficulties were reported to be associated with exposure, but exposure assessments other than self-report were not possible. A large prospective study was unable to identify health issues in a cohort of individuals with recreational or occupational exposure, 29 and a cross-sectional study comparing the health of watermen working either in estuaries (site of Pfiesteria-associated fish kills) or the ocean failed to find significant differences upon medical, neurologic, neuropsychologic, or neurobehavioral evaluation system 2 (NES-2) evaluation, but did note a significantly reduced visual contrast sensitivity among the estuarian watermen. 30 Further studies, especially those that specifically measure exposure to Pfiesteria or its toxins, are needed to establish PEAS as a human disease. 31\n\nIndividuals are exposed to pathogens by virtue of their occupational responsibilities. A good example is exposure of physicians and allied healthcare professionals to viruses (e.g., hepatitis B, C, D, and human immunodeficiency virus) present in blood and other clinical specimens. Likewise, some workers are routinely exposed to waterborne pathogens present in natural waters, as well as sewage and aerosols.\n\nClosed water management systems, such as those used for water cooling, conditioning, and supply, are difficult to maintain, and often accumulate biofilms. These biofilms provide a protective niche for many waterborne protozoa and bacteria. From a medical perspective, an important inhabitant of biofilms is Legionella spp., the causative agent of legionnaire's disease. This bacterial pathogen may be associated with single-celled protozoa; when growing inside the protozoan, it is unaffected by relatively high levels of biocides. 32 Aerosols containing Legionella bacteria are created when the bacteria are shed into water, which is then sprayed or splashed. In this way, Legionella gains access to the respiratory systems by inhalation. Free-living Legionella spp. have also been isolated directly from waters and soils. Legionella bacteria have been recovered from water samples taken from cooling towers, 33 cooling systems, 34 and hospital water supplies, 35, 36 and inhabit water fittings, pipework, and materials in hospital hotwater systems. 37 Large outbreaks have been associated with these water supplies. [38] [39] [40] \n\nWaste water is a complex mixture of potentially hazardous organisms and chemicals in water, and workers may be exposed to pathogens through ingestion, contact with the skin or mucosal surfaces, or by aerosol inhalation. The purpose of waste water treatment is to protect public health by collecting, transporting, and treating waste water. This treatment has greatly reduced the frequency of water-associated disease in the United States, but continues to have an enormous worldwide impact on populations.\n\nDespite the seemingly high potential for hazardous exposures to waste water treatment workers, many reports suggest that the risk of infection, as measured by pathogen loads or seroprevalence, is similar to other segments of the working population. [41] [42] [43] [44] Questionnaire-based prevalence studies have documented illness rates in waste water treatment workers. For example, Thorn and colleagues found an elevated risk of non-specific respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system symptoms among 1394 Swedish municipal sewage workers, compared to controls that were unexposed, or partially exposed to sewage. 45 Using factor analysis, Douwes and colleagues defined four symptom clusters reported by 147 Dutch sewage workers. 46 Two clusters ('flu-like illness' and 'neurological symptoms') were statistically significantly associated with exposure to sewage. Other studies 47,48 did not find significantly higher illness rates among sewage workers, although Pahren and Jakubowski did find that the rate of gastrointestinal illness in inexperienced waste water workers was 2-4 times higher than in experienced workers or the control group.\n\nAlthough the results of epidemiologic studies are mixed, the potential for exposure to disease agents cannot be discounted. Samples taken from municipal sewage treatment plants or conveyance systems can potentially contain any or all of the pathogenic micro-organisms from the community served by the plant. Waterborne microbial pathogens relevant for sewage treatment workers can be divided into those causing respiratory tract, cutaneous, and enteric diseases. The etiologic agents may be bacteria, viruses, protozoans, or helminths. These organisms typically enter human hosts by ingestion, inhalation, or direct contact with dermal or mucosal surfaces.\n\nAerosolized waste water can transmit viral and bacterial microbes to the lungs of workers. Aerosols may also be deposited on food or the surfaces of objects (fomites). The microbes described below may become etiologic agents of respiratory disease. Legionella species can be found in waste water, but there is little published information about waste water workers' potential risk of infection. One reported outbreak of Pontiac fever (non-pneumonic legionellosis) demonstrates that treated industrial waste water from a food manufacturer may have contributed to their common infections with Legionella based on their antibody titers. 49 Notably, the Legionella serotype isolated from five workers matched that isolated from sewage sludge during the same time period, and a sludge centrifugation process was identified as a potential source of the aerosol.\n\nMycobacterium spp., bacteria which cause tuberculosis and skin ulcerations, have been identified from waters and waste water treatment plants, and aerosols created in those environments may offer a previously unexpected source of infection. 50, 51 Additional waste waterborne organisms cause respiratory disease in other countries. One of these, Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) pseudomallei, causes a pneumonia known as meliodosis in sub-tropical Australia and tropical southeast Asia. 52 As waste water treatment plants modernize and become more enclosed for odor control, aerosols become a more important exposure route.\n\nGram-negative bacilli constitute the largest group of aquatic pathogens causing skin infections. 53 Skin infections and rashes have been reported for a variety of organisms not typically considered to be associated with waste water, but these reports underscore the importance of the combination of exposure, agent, and susceptible host. Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium have a clinical history of causing cutaneous infections, and in some instances, serious tissue necrosis. Mycobacterium ulcerans has been epidemiologically linked to skin ulcerations through contact with waste water. 54 Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and Flavobacter are other bacteria causing non-enteric diseases, typically rashes, but sometimes associated with toxin production and secondary sequelae. 52\n\nEnteric bacteria are the predominant, pathogenic infectious agents in waste water, and a large variety of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria can be detected (Table  54 .4). Enteric bacteria commonly cause gastrointestinal disorders, but some cause health effects beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Over the last 20 years in the USA, pathogenic forms of E. coli (enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enterohemorrhagic, and enteroaggregative) have been found in waste water. [55] [56] [57] Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 causes not only bloody diarrhea, but also hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children, which is characterized by renal failure and a high case fatality rate. In the USA, Salmonella and Shigella bacteria are responsible for infection associated with foods that have been irrigated with waste water. 58 However, the most severe form of salmonellosis, typhoid fever, is rarely seen in the US.\n\nPathogenic species of Leptospira can be acquired from water contaminated with the urine of infected animals, causing vomiting, high fever, severe headache, chills, and muscle aches, and may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae), red eyes, or a rash. Severe infections result in liver and kidney dysfunction and a high mortality rate. 59 Rodents, particularly rats, are common hosts of infection, but a variety of wild and domestic mammals can be infected. The organisms can survive for months in water, and isolation from waste water is not uncommon, particularly in tropical and semi-tropical climates. 60 Fewer than 100 cases of leptospirosis are reported each year in the United States. 8 Other bacteria causing gastrointestinal ailments include Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Arcobacter. 61 The most commonly detected viruses in waste water belong to the Enterovirus group of the Picornaviruses, which consists of small single-stranded RNA viruses and includes Poliovirus, Echovirus, and Coxsackievirus. Other viruses associated with waste water and fecal contamination include Adenovirus, Aichi virus, Astrovirus, hepatitis A and E, Calicivirus, and Reovirus. Rotavirus (a member of the Reoviridae) is the most infectious of all the enteric viruses and should be considered a high risk in waste water. 62 Protozoan parasites such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, and Cryptosporidium parvum are recovered from waste water more frequently than from other environmental sources. These parasites are also recovered from natural fresh and estuarine waters in the USA and worldwide. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] Toxoplasma gondii and Cyclospora are also frequently recovered from waste water. Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis (amebic dysentery), and more serious extraintestinal disease affecting the liver. Giardia intestinalis (lamblia) and Cryptosporidium parvum have been implicated in waterborne cases of diarrhea, with flatulence and greasy stools, primarily from drinking surface water and inadequate treatment systems. Nonhuman animals serve as secondary or carrier hosts. The recurring contamination of water and cycling of these organisms to humans creates an almost endless source of infection. Helminth parasites (worms) found in waste waters include Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Necator americanus (hookworm), Trichuris trichiuria (whipworm), Toxocara canis (canine roundworms), and Strongyloides stercoralis (the agent of strongyloidiasis). These worms all have life cycles that are dependent on a host during part of the reproductive cycle, and produce infective cysts, the form likely to be encountered in waste water. Helminthic eggs/cysts that make it past the waste water treatment process may survive in soils and sludges for up to ten years. 68\n\nIn 2002, people working in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining accounted for 1.8% of the US workforce. 69 These individuals may be exposed to disease sources having natural reservoirs in animals (zoonoses), may be specific for humans, may produce toxins, or may be commensals that have acquired genetic elements that express pathogenic traits. The risk posed by transmission of waterborne disease from the agriculture watershed to the population is substantial. 70 Virulent bacteria and parasites can remain viable in the watershed environment, become amplified by agricultural practices, or contaminate the food supply with toxin (as in the case of algal blooms) or pathogens. Surveillance of farm workers has demonstrated that water quality is a serious occupational hazard. 71,72 Drinking water may be contaminated in the farm environment with pesticides, other agricultural chemicals, and microbes. Agricultural waste containing pathogens such as Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium parvum, and many others, can contaminate surface and ground water that is used as sources for drinking water, or for recreational contacts.\n\nAgricultural workers are exposed to many waterborne organisms through their contact with animals, animal feces, and fecally contaminated soil and water. The principal fecal sources are livestock and poultry, followed by wildlife and companion animals. 70 Manure from cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry is routinely processed and used as farm and commercial fertilizer. An additional source of agricultural exposure to infectious agents is the use of biosolids (sludge) from municipal waste water treatment plants, 73 where pathogens surviving sewage treatment are a potential health threat. Protozoan cysts can survive in water as long as 180 days; helminth (worm) ova can survive in soil seven years; bacteria and viruses may live up to a year. 74, 75 Additionally, fecally contaminated water from animal feeding operations may leach into surface or ground water. On-farm recycling can also release pathogens into the environment. Manure contains numerous eukaryotes (protozoa), as well as anaerobic, aerobic, and facultatively aerobic bacteria that contribute to the decomposition of manure. 76 For this reason, manure is stored and decomposed as an aerated liquid slurry concentrate. Sludge and lagoon water are removed periodically and applied to farmland. Unprocessed sewage may be carried from lagoons and storage ponds into overland flow or subsurface water. Obviously, the occupational hazards of waste water workers would also be applicable in these situations. Waterborne hazards in the agricultural watershed include protozoa, bacteria, viruses, and helminths. Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia spp. are the protozoal pathogens of primary concern. Of lesser concern are Entamoeba histolytica, Toxoplasma gondii, and Balantidium coli. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 70 Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria make up the bulk of the feces. In a study of bacteria obtained from chicken intestines, 70% of the contents of the ileum were related to the Lactobacillus genus, and the rest were related to Clostridia, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus. 77 In the cecum, clostridial relatives comprised 65%, and the remainder were related to Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides. Facultatively aerobic organisms belonging to genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter, among others (fecal coliforms), are used as measures of fecal contamination in the environment because they are easily cultured and nearly always present in fecal matter.\n\nPathogenic bacteria are also transmitted in the feces, and these include Escherichia coli O157:H7, Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., and Leptospira. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Parasitic worms transmitted by feces include platyhelminths and Ascaris spp. 70 Human viruses present in human sewage include Adenovirus, Astrovirus, Hepatitis, Noroviruses, Rotavirus, and Coxsackievirus. 78 However, most viruses, unlike many bacteria, parasites and helminths, are host specific. Viruses present in animal feces having zoonotic potential include hepatitis E, and influenza virus.\n\nOne of the major causes of water-or food-borne outbreaks associated with the agricultural sector is the use of contaminated irrigation water. The use of partially treated or untreated waste water introduces waterborne pathogens into the irrigation system. [79] [80] [81] Additionally, pathogens may enter the watershed through the application of manure or other biosolids to the land. 70, 82, 83 In the USA, use of these biosolids is regulated by the EPA Part 503 Biosolids Rule. However, these regulations may not be stringent enough to remove thermally tolerant viruses. 84, 85 After waste water or biosolids are applied to land, waterborne pathogens may persist and contaminate vegetation and crops. The life cycle of waterborne parasites may be supported by intermediate hosts found in irrigation canals. 86 Pathogens may contaminate crops by adhering to leaf or root surfaces. 87, 88 Additionally, recent studies have shown that E. coli O157:H7 can migrate to internal edible parts of the plant tissue and become inaccessible to disinfectants and surface cleaning. 82, 83 Other occupational hazards\n\nStojek and Dutkiewicz 89 investigated the possibility of Legionella infection among outdoor gardeners in eastern Poland. They found that potting soil as well as the aerosolized water from the sprinklers was contaminated with Legionella, and could pose a threat.\n\nIn healthcare settings Legionella bacteria were found in the water of dental units sampled from 28 dental facilities in six US states. 90 The Legionella spp. levels observed in the dental unit waters was 1000/ml or more in 36% of the samples collected, and 10,000/ml or more in 19% of the samples. In an investigation of Legionella infection in a dental office, Atlas and colleagues identified high levels of Legionella spp., L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae in the dentist's operating area, suggesting that aerosols from dental units were the source of the Legionella infection.\n\nBacteria represent a diverse group of microbes that live in a wide variety of environments. Depending on the taxonomic subgroup, they may produce spores, survive in distilled water, remain alive for centuries in salt deposits, live endosymbiotically in protozoa, fungi, or insects, or synthesize toxins that in tiny amounts can cause substantial human illness or death.\n\nAeromonas species are free-living, facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative rods found in fresh water and sewage. Aeromonas hydrophila causes illness in fish, reptiles, amphibians, ducks and other water birds, and mammals, including humans. 91, 92 Some A. hydrophila strains may produce a toxin that can cause diarrheal symptoms in patients. 93 A. hydrophila cultured from stool specimens grows readily on the differential media used to culture enteric gram-negative rods, and can easily be confused with the enteric bacteria. 94 \n\nTwo distinct types of gastroenteritis have been associated with A. hydrophila: a cholera-like illness with watery diarrhea, and a dysenteric illness characterized by loose stools containing blood and mucus. 91 It also causes cellulitis and other primary or nosocomial infections. 91, 94 A. hydrophila can be found in blood of individuals with seriously impaired host defenses or endocarditis. It is occasionally isolated from the feces of patients with diarrhea. 94\n\nAeromonas hydrophila is a motile rod commonly isolated from water, soil, or food, and occasionally from the human intestinal tract. It can cause freshwater wound infections. 94 Transmission may be via water, food or, more rarely, person to person.\n\nEscherichia coli belongs to a large bacterial family, the Enterobacteriaceae, which lives in the intestinal tracts of animals. E. coli is a facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rod that adheres to mucus overlying the inside of the large intestine. It is acquired orally shortly after birth from other individuals, foods, or water. Many strains are sensitive to antibiotics. E. coli is a consistent inhabitant of the human intestinal tract and so its presence in nature is used as an indicator of fecal pollution and water contamination. Despite its role as a commensal organism in humans, E. coli is sometimes responsible for three types of infections: intestinal diseases (gastroenteritis), urinary tract infections (UTI), and neonatal meningitis.\n\nThe serotype O157:H7 of Escherichia coli has emerged as a significant pathogen from the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) group. Though commonly associated with foodborne illnesses, waterborne occurrence is also observed. Two potent toxins involved in the clinical complications of EHEC infection are Shiga-like toxins I and II. Shiga-like toxin I is identical to the cytotoxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae. 95 Antibiotic resistance genes are also frequently present in pathogenic strains. Drinking unchlorinated well water or accidental swallowing of water while engaging in recreational activities has been responsible for hundreds of cases. 96, 97 Cattle are the primary reservoirs of EHEC. Humans can also act as a reservoir in the cases of human-to-human transmission. The pathogen can be shed for a week or less in adults, though three weeks is the common excretion period observed. A prolonged carriage is comparatively infrequent. 95\n\nPathogenic E. coli strains are classified as localized, diffuse, or aggregative, and typically cause fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is often bloody. The incubation period for the illness ranges from one to ten days, with a median of 3-4 days. The pathogen is typically shed for a week or less in adults, but may be found for up to three weeks. Clinical complications of the illness include hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Uropathogenic E. coli colonize from the feces or perineal region and ascend the urinary tract to the bladder, causing typical urinary tract infection symptoms of dysuria, urgency, and frequency; the urine may be cloudy, foul smelling, and bloody.\n\nCattle are a primary reservoir of EHEC. Consumption of insufficiently cooked meat previously contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 during slaughter is one of the major causes of E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks. Humans can act as reservoirs in human-to-human transmission. A fecal-oral route of transmission is observed, with transmission from the diarrheal stools of an infected person to others, if inadequate personal hygiene is followed. Other common sources of infection include contaminated sprouts, lettuce, salami, unpasteurized milk, juice, sewage-contaminated water, and swimming in water contaminated with E. coli O157:H7.\n\nThe infective dose of E. coli O157:H7 appears to be less than ten organisms. E. coli O157:H7 is susceptible to heat. Thus cooking meat or boiling water will help prevent transmission. Strains that have acquired pathogenicity factors may be resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and amoxicillin/clavulanate.\n\nHelicobacter pylori (formerly Campylobacter pylori) is a spiralshaped bacterium found in the gastric mucous layer or adherent to the epithelial lining of the stomach. H. pylori causes more than 90% of duodenal ulcers and up to 80% of gastric ulcers. It is estimated that over half of the world's population may be infected with H. pylori. In the United States, H. pylori is most prevalent among older adults, African-Americans, Hispanics, and lower socioeconomic groups. 98\n\nH. pylori causes chronic active, persistent, atrophic gastritis, as well as duodenal and gastric ulcers in adults and children. Infected persons have a 2-6-fold increased risk of developing gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoidtype lymphoma compared with uninfected counterparts. The most common ulcer symptom is gnawing or burning pain in the epigastrium, most severe when the stomach is empty, between meals, and in the early morning hours. Other ulcer symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and bleeding; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia, weakness, and fatigue. Bleeding may be associated with hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. 99\n\nIt is not clearly understood how H. pylori is transmitted or why some patients become symptomatic while others do not. The bacteria are most likely spread from person to person through fecal-oral or oral-oral routes. 100 Possible environmental reservoirs include contaminated water sources. 101 Iatrogenic spread through contaminated endoscopes has been documented, but can be prevented by proper cleaning of equipment. 102\n\nTherapy for H. pylori infection consists of ten days to two weeks of a regimen of effective antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, tetracycline (not to be used for children <12 years), metronidazole, or clarithromycin, plus either ranitidine bismuth citrate, bismuth subsalicylate, or a proton pump inhibitor. 103 Acid suppression by the H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor therapy in conjunction with the antibiotics helps alleviate abdominal pain and nausea, heal gastric mucosal inflammation, and enhance antibiotic efficacy against H. pylori at the gastric mucosal surface.\n\nThe research so far has identified more than 30 species and at least 14 serogroups of Legionella pneumophila. The most common strain responsible for more than 90% of known infections is the Pontiac sub-type (MAb2). 104 The Legionella species have often been observed to inhabit soil, rivers, and lakes. These organisms can colonize man-made water handling and storage systems. Legionella are often observed to inhabit cooling towers, evaporative condensers, showers, water storage, distribution systems, and other aquatic systems such as whirlpool spa baths. 104 L. pneumophila was shown to grow intracellularly in amebae, like Acanthamoeba, Hartmannella, Valkampfia, and Naegleria spp., and in other protozoa, like ciliates of the Tetrahymena pyriformis group. [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] Not only do these hosts provide nutrients for Legionella organisms, they also protect them from adverse environmental conditions. 111 Legionellosis has two distinct presentations: legionnaire's disease, the more severe form of infection, which includes severe pneumonia; and Pontiac fever, a flu-like illness without associated pneumonia. 111\n\nCommon symptoms include pneumonia with fever, chills, cough with variable sputum, prominent myalgias, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. 94, 103 Persons with Pontiac fever experience fever and myalgias, but do not have pneumonia. They generally recover in 2-5 days without treatment. Incubation periods for legionnaire's disease and for Pontiac fever are 2-10 days, and 5-66 hours, respectively. 103\n\nLegionella spp. have often been observed to be associated with cold and hot water distribution systems, heaters, pools, and spas. 111 Persons may be exposed to these mists in homes, workplaces, hospitals, or public places. Legionellosis is not passed from person to person, 103 and there is no evidence of persons becoming infected from auto air conditioners or household window air-conditioning units.\n\nHigh dose erythromycin is the antibiotic currently recommended for treating persons with legionnaire's disease. In severe cases, a second drug, rifampin, may be added. Other drugs such as newer macrolides, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are also found to be effective. 103 Pontiac fever typically has a self-limited course, even without treatment. Improved design and maintenance of cooling towers and plumbing systems to limit the growth and spread of Legionella organisms are the foundations of legionellosis prevention.\n\nLeptospires are obligate aerobes that may be stained using carbol fuchsin counterstain. They produce both catalase and oxidase and have an optimum growth temperature of 28-30 degrees C. These tightly coiled, thin, flexible spirochetes are 5-15 \u03bcm long with very fine spirals 0.1-0.2 \u03bcm wide. 94 One end of the microbe is often bent into a distinctive hook and there are two internally located flagellar bundles for translational motility. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of ubiquitous distribution, caused by infection with pathogenic Leptospira species passed in animal urine. The complex taxonomy of leptospires, previously based on serology, has been modified by genotypic classification. 112\n\nLeptospirosis is particularly common in tropical regions. The spectrum of human leptospirosis ranges from subclinical infection to a severe syndrome of multi-organ infection with high mortality (Weil's disease). The incubation period ranges from four to 19 days. 95 Disease can develop in two phases: the first acute phase lasts about a week and includes fever, chills, headache, myalgias, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally skin rash. The second or immune phase produces antibody response and shedding of Leptospira. 113 Other symptoms may include aseptic meningitis, with intense headache, stiff neck, and pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. 114 Uveitis is a well-known late complication of systemic leptospirosis.\n\nRats, mice, wild rodents, dogs, swine, and cattle have been identified as the primary sources of zoonotic Leptospira infection, passing it through urine. Leptospira is ingested with contaminated food or water or can enter through skin lesions and mucous membranes. 114 Transmission can occur through contact with contaminated water, moist soil, vegetation, animals, or urine. 103 US military personnel serving in tropical regions are at risk for infection. 112\n\nThe epidemiology of leptospirosis is influenced by changes in animal husbandry, climate, and human behavior. 112 Once contracted by a person, the treatment of choice is antibiotic therapy (doxycycline, penicillin or tetracycline). 94 Control consists of preventing exposure to potentially contaminated water and reducing contamination by rodent control.\n\nPlesiomonas shigelloides is a ubiquitous, facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rod with a polar flagellum. It is found in wells and unfiltered, untreated surface water. P. shigelloides is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. Most isolates from humans have been from stool cultures of patients with diarrhea. P. shigelloides grows on the differential media used to isolate Salmonella and Shigella from stool specimens. Some Plesiomonas strains share antigens with Shigella sonnei, so cross-reactions with Shigella A and C antisera do occur. 94\n\nSymptoms usually occur within 48 hours of exposure. P. shigelloides produces self-limited diarrhea with blood or mucus, abdominal cramps, and vomiting or fever. 115\n\nPlesiomonas shigelloides is transmitted by drinking or preparing food with untreated water, eating uncooked shellfish, or traveling to developing countries. [116] [117] [118] It has been isolated from freshwater fish and this has been postulated as a source of transmission as well. 119\n\nRoutine testing for total fecal coliform bacteria, turbidity, and chlorine residual may enable early detection of fecal contamination and rapid decontamination. Disinfection with chlorine and filtration of potable water systems have substantially reduced waterborne outbreaks and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Agricultural runoff should not be used for drinking or food preparation.\n\nPseudomonads are gram-negative, motile, aerobic rods, some of which produce water-soluble pigments. They are ubiquitous in soil, water, plants, animals, and moist environments such as hospitals. 94 Of the two million nosocomial infections in the US each year, 10% are caused by P. aeruginosa. 120 It is a common cause of pneumonia in inten-sive care unit (ICU) settings. Pseudomonas infections can be spread within hospitals by healthcare workers, medical equipment, sinks, disinfectant solutions, and food. 120 Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection has been widely described in cystic fibrosis patients; some hospital units have MDR P. aeruginosa rates as high as 40%. 121 MDR P. aeruginosa occurs in isolated outbreaks in intensive care units, hematologic units, and among immunocompromised patients, including oncology and HIV patients. 121 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is both a frank pathogen and an opportunist, dependent almost entirely on the host susceptibility.\n\nP. aeruginosa infects skin, soft tissues, urinary tracts, eyes, ear, central nervous system, bones, joints, heart, and lung. Infection causes a similarly large range of symptoms, consistent with bacteremia: fever, inflammation, rash, myalgias, swelling, and other organ-specific symptoms (e.g., respiratory symptoms of dyspnea and cough). Wounds and burns can give rise to meningitis through hematogenous spread. P. aeruginosa invasion of the blood stream can lead to fatal sepsis. Hemorrhagic necrosis of skin (ecthyma gangrenosum) occurs often in sepsis due to P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa exotoxin A causes tissue necrosis that can be lethal. 94\n\nPseudomonas is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, and it may be passed person to person or environmentally. The organism thrives in moist environments, including sinks, water baths, showers, hot tubs, and other wet areas. 94 It may be indigenous to water supplies or distribution systems if chlorine residuals are inadequate, or if water in long runs of distribution pipe is inadequately circulated.\n\nThe most active antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa isolates is amikacin, in a study of 10,361 isolates at centers in the United States during 1995-2000. 122 It is important to assess sensitivities given the toxicity of aminoglycoside therapy. MDR P. aeruginosa and some other pseudomonads may be non-responsive to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, and piperacillin. 121 Three-drug combinations are sometimes the only effective treatment.\n\nPseudomonas infections should not be treated with singledrug therapy, as the bacteriocidal response rate is low with such therapy, and organisms can rapidly develop resistance for a single drug.\n\nShigella are gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore forming rod-shaped bacteria. Approximately 18,000 cases of shigellosis are reported in the United States every year. 123 Shigella sonnei (serogroup D) accounts for two-thirds of these. Shigella sonnei may be differentiated from the other Shigellae; however, the other species cannot be separated without serotyping, including Shigella dysenteriae (serogroup A), Shigella flexneri (B), and Shigella boydii (C). 124 In the CDC surveillance period 1991-2000, approximately 1700 people in the US developed shigellosis infection; one-third of these were due to contaminated drinking water and the remainder were associated with recreational water sources. Shigellosis accounts for less than 10% of the reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in the USA, and is frequently found in water polluted with human feces.\n\nShigellosis involves the large and distal small intestine, and is characterized by diarrhea, fever, vomiting, stomach cramps, occasional toxemia, and tenesmus. Illness can be self-limited, and in some cases only a watery diarrhea occurs. More frequently, stools contain blood and mucus (dysentery) as a result of mucosal ulceration and confluent colonic crypt microabscesses. The incubation period ranges between 12 hours to one week, and lasts for about 4-7 days. Convulsions are an important complication in young children. 95\n\nDirect or indirect fecal-oral transfer is the primary route of transmission. Flies can facilitate transmission of the pathogen from feces to food. Drinking or swimming in contaminated water is another form of transmission. 95\n\nA recent retrospective study found that most Shigella isolates are susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, but resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. 125 \n\nImproved hygiene in food handling, bathing in hot springs, and chlorine disinfection of potable water systems will reduce person-to-person transmission, outbreaks, and subsequent morbidity and mortality.\n\nThere are numerous pathogenic serotypes of Salmonella, although Salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis are the most common serotypes in the United States. 123 The vast majority of the more than 2500 serovars belong to one species: S. enterica (formerly cholerasuis 124 ). Salmonella infections are common throughout the world. The incidence rate is highest in infants and young children. About 60-80% of cases are sporadic, though large outbreaks can be associated with hospitals, restaurants, and institutional settings, including nursing homes and orphanages. The common reservoirs of salmonellosis are domestic and wild animals, including poultry and fowl (including eggs), swine, cattle, rodents, and pets such as iguanas, tortoises, turtles, terrapins, chicks, dogs, and cats. Mild and asymptomatic human cases can also act as a carrier. 126 \n\nThe typical clinical symptoms include frequent fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Severe dehydration frequently occurs in elderly and infant cases. Anorexia and diarrhea may be experienced for several days. Septicemia and focal infection can develop as the illness progresses beyond the phase of acute enterocolitis, 95 including septic arthritis, cholecystitis, endocarditis, meningitis, pericarditis, pneumonia, pyoderma, pyelonephritis, and tissue abscesses. The incubation period ranges from six to 72 hours, with a median of 12-36 hours. An exposure dose of 100-1000 organisms is generally required, although for some highly virulent strains the infectious dose (ID) is thought to be as few as ten organisms. 95 A temporary carrier state is often observed for months in infants.\n\nSalmonella inhabit the intestinal tracts of humans, animals, and birds, therefore the fecal-oral route is the most common. This is often mediated by water and food.\n\nHIV infected persons are at a higher risk of non-typhoidal Salmonella septicemia.\n\nMeasures that will help reduce the risk of Salmonella transmission include pasteurization of milk, treatment of municipal water supplies, improvements in farm and animal hygiene, and wider use of egg pasteurization. 123\n\nCampylobacter jejuni belongs to the group of spiral shaped bacteria. Ninety-nine percent of the human illnesses of campylobacteriosis are caused by Campylobacter jejuni. 127 The common reservoirs for the pathogen are poultry, cattle, puppies, kittens, other pets, swine, sheep, rodents, and birds. 128 Campylobacter grows best at the body temperature of birds (40-42 degrees C), but some important species (e.g., C. jejuni var. doyle) will not grow at 42 degrees C, but rather at 37 degrees C. 129 Foodborne campylobacteriosis is more common than waterborne campylobacteriosis. A waterborne outbreak at the Washington County Fair in New York in 1999 is one of the significant outbreaks of Camplyobacter jejuni, where a total of 781 cases were identified in conjunction with E. coli O157:H7. 130 Over the period of 1991-2000, a total of five outbreaks affecting 340 people, and one outbreak affecting six people, were reported in association with drinking water and recreational water, respectively. 9-13\n\nCampylobacteriosis is characterized by diarrhea, cramps, abdominal pain, and fever. The stools may be bloody, with mucus and WBCs in diarrheal stools. Occult blood can also be observed in the stools. A typhoid-like syndrome, with reactive arthritis, febrile convulsions, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and meningitis can also occur. 127 Severe gastroenteritis may mimic acute appendicitis. The onset of illness is usually observed between 2-5 days after exposure, though it can range between 1-10 days. Clinical illness usually lasts 2-5 days but in prolonged cases may last up to ten days. 131\n\nBirds, especially chicken flocks, are the most common reservoir of the pathogen. The organism is easily spread from bird to bird through a common water source or contact with the infected feces. 131 Primarily transmission can occur by handling raw poultry, or eating raw or undercooked poultry meat. Previous studies have reported that larger outbreaks are associated with drinking unpasteurized milk or contaminated water. 127 Infection can also be facilitated by contact with stools of an infected animal.\n\nThe organism cannot survive drying, and tolerates poorly an oxygen-rich environment.\n\nSimple prevention measures can help control Campylobacter jejuni transmission, including avoiding consumption of uncooked meat or consumption of unpasteurized milk and untreated surface water.\n\nMycobacteria are rod-shaped, non-spore forming, aerobic bacilli with thick, multi-layered lipid-rich walls. Mycobacteria are fastidious extracellular bacteria requiring special culture conditions, supplemented media, and prolonged incubation time. Nonetheless, they cause disease in a wide variety of vertebrates, including humans, livestock, birds, and fish. A number of Mycobacterium species are waterborne, including but not limited to Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacterium chelonae. Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare grow in natural water sources and drinking water over a temperature range of 10-45 degrees C. 132 Mycobacteria species may be both saprophytic and pathogenic. Their growth rates are much slower than those of most other bacteria.\n\nSymptoms depend on the route of infection. In respiratory infection, symptoms include those associated with pneu-monia as well as wheeze, bronchitis, and asthma. 133 Cutaneous infection results in granulomatous lesions of the skin. 53\n\nCell surface hydrophobicity permits adherence to solid substrates (e.g., pipes or leaves) in aquatic environments, which results in Mycobacteria's persistence and resistance to being washed away. 133 Mycobacteria can colonize dental units and drinking water sources. Pulmonary illness and infection have been a consequence of exposure to aerosols generated by hot tubs, spas, and coolant baths, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis in occupants of waterdamaged buildings, swimming pool attendants, and workers exposed to metal working fluid.\n\nImmunocompromised individuals and the elderly are particularly susceptible to mycobacterial infection.\n\nMycobacterium are very resistant to the disinfectants used in water treatment, including chlorine and ozone. 133 Water filtration removes particulates that carry Mycobacteria; their numbers can be reduced using UV light or high temperatures (e.g., 40 degrees C), surfactants, or detergentlike disinfectants.\n\nVibrio species are among the most common bacteria in surface waters worldwide. They are curved, gram-negative, aerobic rods, and are motile, possessing a polar flagellum. \n\nAfter an incubation period of less than a day to five days, depending on size of the inoculum, 134 there is a sudden onset of nausea and vomiting accompanied by profuse diarrhea with abdominal cramps. The stools resemble 'rice water' and contain mucus, epithelial cells, and large numbers of Vibrio bacteria. There is rapid loss of fluid and electrolytes, which leads to profound volume depletion that can lead to circulatory collapse, and anuria. The mortality rate without treatment is 25-50% in some epidemics. 135, 136 \n\nWorldwide epidemics of cholera occurred in the 1800s and early 1900s. The 'classic' biotype was prevalent through the early 1960s; the El Tor biotype, discovered in 1905, became prevalent in the late 1960s and has caused pandemic disease in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. 94 The disease has been rare in North America since the mid-1800s, but an endemic focus may exist on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas. 94 From the endemic areas, the disease can be carried along shipping lanes, trade routes, and migration routes, and spread by individuals with mild or early illness and by water, food, flies, and person-toperson contact. The carrier state seldom exceeds 3-4 weeks, and true chronic carriers are rare. Vibrio species survive in water for up to three weeks. 94\n\nThe most important part of therapy consists of water and electrolyte replacement to correct the severe volume and electrolyte depletion. Many antimicrobial agents are effective against V. cholerae. Oral tetracycline tends to reduce stool output in cholera and shortens the period of excretion of bacteria. 94\n\nWaterborne viruses are present in large numbers in a variety of marine environments. 137, 138 Exposure to waterborne viruses may occur by drinking or recreational use of contaminated water, or following the consumption of improperly cooked marine or freshwater molluscs, which capture and concentrate viruses and other pathogens. Additionally, contaminated natural water or inadequately treated human or animal sewage can be put to agricultural use, exposing workers, crops and, potentially, consumers to waterborne viral pathogens. The diseases associated with waterborne viruses include acute gastroenteritis, hepatitis, conjunctivitis, acute respiratory disease, and meningitis.\n\nSince viruses are at least an order of magnitude smaller than bacteria or protozoa and many are structurally and biochemically distinct, methods that rely on bacterial indicators, such as the coliform count, do not detect or enumerate viruses in samples of treated water accurately. 139 Newer methods, such as the use of bacteriophage indicators, quantitative PCR, and outgrowth on mammalian cell culture, are considered to be more reliable.\n\nWaterborne viruses have properties that determine their distribution and stability in the environment, as well as the methods required to detect, enumerate, and purify them from contaminated water. First, waterborne viruses possess a capsid consisting primarily of protein subunits fitting together to form a structure with higher order symmetry. The capsid makes these viruses extremely resistant to non-ionic detergents, compared to enveloped viruses, which derive their outer layer from a biologic membrane of their host cell. Second, the genetic material of waterborne viruses, unlike bacteria or protozoa, may consist of single-or double-stranded forms of DNA or RNA. Molecular methods used to detect the presence of viruses in water samples commonly rely on PCR, which utilizes a thermostable DNA polymerase. Because this enzyme amplifies DNA, but not RNA molecules, viruses with RNA genomes must first be converted to a DNA copy. This is often accomplished with an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), although a new polymerase capable of both activities is available commercially.\n\nThis section will focus on six virus families that pose health hazards to humans, and are known to be present in untreated and treated waters. The virology, clinical, and epidemiologic manifestations of the diseases and methods of detection in water are discussed below.\n\nThe Adenovirus (Ad) family includes more than 50 distinct types producing respiratory, ophthalmic, and enteric syndromes in humans. The Ad DNA genome is complex, encoding numerous polypeptides, and variation in gene content may explain the tissue tropism and biologic character distinguishing these Ad types.\n\nWaterborne adenoviruses of medical and public health importance lead to cases of conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis. Human adenovirus of types 3, 4, and 7 are commonly responsible for adenoviral hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), identified by the presence of small subconjunctival hemorrhages, inflammation of the corneal epithelium and upper respiratory disease. AHC appears 4-12 days (average eight days) following exposure. Infections with Ad types 8, 19, or 37 can lead to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) 5-12 days following exposure. Other Ad types have also been linked to both AHC and EKC. Enteric Ads of types 40 and 41 are associated with cases of acute gastrointestinal disease, typically in children less than four years old and immunocompromised individuals. Symptoms typically appear in 8-10 days, and may last 1-2 weeks. Outbreaks are commonly set in daycare centers, hospitals, and nursing homes, and particularly affect immunocompromised individuals. 140\n\nAlthough Ad conjunctivitis is often due to direct or indirect contact with eye discharge, outbreaks have been linked to inadequately chlorinated swimming pools or inadequate disinfection of eye washing stations in work settings, and ophthalmic solutions in physician offices. Enteric Ad infections are typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Enteric Ads are often found in natural and treated water samples, and the presence of Ad is not correlated with bacterial indicator organisms. [141] [142] [143] Detection A variety of diagnostic methods are typically used to detect and type adenovirus infections, including direct visualization by electron microscopy, serum neutralization, immunologic methods (immune fluorescence, enzyme linked immunoassay, and hemagglutination inhibition assay), virus isolation on permissive cell lines and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The latter two methods are useful for detection of Ads in environmental samples.\n\nOutbreaks of AHC and EKC can be prevented by assuring the sterility of instruments and hands contacting the conjunctiva (with systemic sterilization or the use of disposable equipment and gloves). Maintaining the proper concentration of free chlorine in swimming pools will prevent transmission of adenovirus in swimming pools. Adenoviral vaccines are not available in the US.\n\nThe Calicivirus family consists of encapsidated RNA viruses that were once described as 'small, round structured viruses', because of their uniform size and shape when viewed by electron microscopy. Two Calicivirus subgroups are currently believed to infect humans: Sapovirus (formerly 'Sapporo-like virus') and Norovirus (formerly 'Norwalk-like virus').\n\nNoroviruses are a very common cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world. Symptoms, which include acute-onset nausea and vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea with abdominal cramps, fever, myalgias, appear 24-48 hours following exposure and last 24-60 hours.\n\nOutbreaks often occur when large groups are exposed to a common source of infection, which could be contact with an infected individual, contaminated food, or water. Fecal-oral transmission is undoubtedly important, but other routes, such as inhalation of aerosolized virus 144 or ingestion of virus attached to objects or surfaces, are likely. Water plays an important role in the transmission of viruses during outbreaks, as well as sporadic cases. Although few studies have definitively demonstrated the presence of Calicivirus in natural and treated waters, exposure to water has been independently associated with infection during outbreaks, [145] [146] [147] [148] and virus, often having a nucleic acid sequence identical to virus shed by cases, has been isolated from water sources implicated in some outbreaks. 145, 149, 150 The settings for Calicivirus outbreaks have been restaurants, hospitals, cruise ships, vacation resorts, schools, concerts, and nursing homes. 149, [151] [152] [153] Unlike many other gastroenteritis viruses, Calicivirus infects individuals of all ages, and adults are often associated with outbreaks. This suggests that virus-specific immunity is short-lived or unable to cross-neutralize viral variants. 44\n\nThe use of electron microscopy and serology to diagnose Calicivirus infections is being replaced by tests using RT-PCR amplification of viral genomes extracted from stool or environmental samples. The nucleic acid sequence of genes amplified using these tests can be determined and compared to sequences obtained from environmental specimens to link cases and potential sources or vectors.\n\nThe Picornavirus family includes waterborne pathogens of medical and public health importance, including Enteroviruses (including the viruses that cause poliomyelitis), as well as hepatitis A virus. Picornaviruses are characterized by a small proteinaceous capsid enclosing a positive-sense RNA genome. The genetic organization of the picornaviral genome is similar, but nucleic acid sequences can be quite diverse.\n\nImportant waterborne enteroviruses include coxsackieviruses and poliovirus. Multiple Coxsackievirus serotypes are responsible for transient cases of pharyngitis and myalgia as well as diseases with long-lasting sequelae including myocarditis, meningitis, and perhaps insulin-dependent diabetes. Rare cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) are still caused by Poliovirus, although this virus is a target for worldwide eradication. Incubation periods for enterovirus infection range from 3-5 days for Coxsackievirus pharyngitis, to 3-31 days for poliovirus AFP. Enteroviruses may persist in the stool for several weeks following infection. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes significant food-or waterborne outbreaks throughout the world. The disease is characterized by symptoms, including jaundice, dark urine, fever, anorexia, abdominal pain, and malaise, that appear 15-50 days after exposure. Symptoms can last from 1-2 weeks to several months, and virus is shed to the stool for 1-3 weeks after exposure, often before the onset of illness. The HAV mortality rate is very low, but infection can be lethal, especially in the elderly and individuals with chronic liver disease.\n\nWaterborne picornaviruses are commonly identified in samples of natural waters as well as waste water samples, [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] and exposure to recreational water or marine molluscs has been epidemiologically linked to some outbreaks, 161, 162 especially in the case of hepatitis A. 163, 164 Fecal-oral transmission is commonly observed with HAV, and common source outbreaks are often associated with contaminated food or water, or through an infected food handler. Because of the extraordinary heat and pH stability demonstrated by the virus, even cooked items may be a source of infection. For example, HAV infectivity is partially retained in shellfish heated to 60 degrees C for one hour. 165 Other transmission routes may be epidemiologically important, including direct contact (via hands or fomites), sexual contact, and blood transfusion.\n\nPicornaviruses may be detected by isolation in permissive cell culture and suckling mice. Serologic methods (virus neutralization, IgG and IgM ELISA) may be used to diagnose polio or HAV infection in unvaccinated individuals. RT-PCR and sequence analysis of amplified genes may be used to detect virus in the environment and among cases, and is an invaluable tool for tracing outbreaks\n\nGood personal hygiene practices are necessary to prevent fecal-oral transmission, as is access to clean water in developing nations. Food-and waterborne HAV can be destroyed by thorough cooking. Shellfish should be heated to 85-90 degrees C (185-194 degrees F) for four minutes, or steamed for 90 seconds prior to eating. Inactivated and attenuated (oral) poliovirus vaccines form the basis of a worldwide campaign to eradicate this virus. An inactivated HAV vaccine is available and highly effective even after a single dose, but is not routinely recommended for children less than two years of age, or for older children and adults in low-risk populations. HAV immunoglobulin (Ig) can prevent clinical symptoms if given within two weeks of exposure.\n\nThe presence of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in water samples is an important issue in nations that are using OPV to eradicate AFP because OPV is capable of reverting to virulence and, in some documented instances, causing outbreaks. 166, 167 Hepatitis E\n\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is not assigned to a family, but these viruses, which consist of a positive-sense RNA genome enclosed within a compact, proteinaceous capsid, share genetic and morphologic characteristics with Caliciviruses and the Rubella virus family.\n\nInfection leads to a clinical disease similar to that caused by HAV, including a long (15-60 days) incubation period, and the presence of infectious virus in blood and stool prior to the appearance of symptoms. During outbreaks, symptoms are more common among older individuals. Mortality is generally low, except among women in their third trimester of pregnancy, where the case-fatality rate is about 20%.\n\nThe disease is endemic and outbreaks are common in developing countries in South Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and Mexico, and especially in regions with poor sanitation infrastructure. HEV outbreaks are primarily linked to fecally contaminated water, although other transmission routes including food or infected food handlers have been observed. Household-based secondary transmission is rare. 168 In the industrialized nations, infection is usually confined to individuals traveling in endemic regions. Exposure estimates based on serologic surveys may be confounded by cross-reaction, 169 with related virus circulating in swine and other animals. The capacity of these viruses to cause human disease is currently under investigation, but they have not been linked to large disease outbreaks. Fecally contaminated water has been identified as an important HEV transmission route in epidemiologic investigations. [170] [171] [172] This predilection to waterborne transmission is underscored by surveys identifying HEV nucleic acid in samples of sewage, as well as natural and treated water collected throughout the world. 159, 173, 174 The public health significance of sewageborne HEV-like viruses remains to be determined.\n\nHEV infection is usually confirmed by serologic identification of circulating IgM and IgG, or the presence of viral RNA in blood or stool by RT-PCR, tests which are not routinely available in the USA.\n\nTravelers to endemic areas of the world should be educated about precautions to prevent the acquisition of food and waterborne diseases, including HEV. This is especially true for women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Proper sanitation infrastructure is needed to control outbreaks in developing nations. HEV-specific therapy and vaccination are not available.\n\nRotavirus, an encapsidated, multisegmented doublestranded RNA virus belonging to the Reovirus family, is a common cause of severe gastroenteritis in children throughout the world. Rotavirus isolates are serologically distinguished into six groups, three (groups A, B, and C) of which appear to cause human disease. Rotaviruses have been isolated from animals, but zoonotic transmission does not occur.\n\nThe virus induces a typical gastroenteritis, characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and fever, 1-3 days after exposure. Symptoms may last 4-6 days, during which the patient excretes virus into stool. In most cases, prolonged excretion is not observed.\n\nRotavirus transmission is primarily through fecally contaminated food and water or contact with contaminated surfaces, although the presence of virus in respiratory secretions may allow air-borne transmission. Most cases of symptomatic disease are found among children less than five years old. However, a large serogroup B rotavirus outbreak on mainland China affected mostly adults, 175 and there is evidence that adult Rotavirus gastroenteritis, caused by genotype G2 variant of a serogroup A virus, is the cause of some outbreaks in the USA. 176 The presence and stability of Rotavirus in a variety of natural and treated water [177] [178] [179] accounts for the epidemiologic importance of waterborne virus transmission. 160, 180 However, it was not detected in two recent surveys of ground water in the USA. 181, 182 Detection Infected individuals are usually identified by the demonstration of viral antigen in stool using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and may be confirmed with additional tests, including RT-PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid from stool.\n\nSince virus can survive for long periods on contaminated surfaces and in water, hygienic measures designed to prevent fecal-oral transmission may not be effective. Breastfeeding does not prevent infection, but significantly reduces the severity of diarrhea. A Rotavirus vaccine is currently not available in the USA.\n\nAstrovirus are encapsidated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that were first identified in 1975. 183 They have a star-like appearance when viewed by electron microscopy.\n\nAcute gastroenteritis caused by Astrovirus infection has a typical presentation, and is usually found in children throughout the world. [184] [185] [186] Adult infection is rarely observed, although outbreaks have occurred among the elderly residents of nursing homes. The importance of Astrovirus infection is probably under-recognized in the USA due to the lack of diagnostic capacity.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission is probably fecal-oral, although the stability of the virus may allow it to survive on and be transmitted by inanimate objects. 187\n\nThe potential detection methodologies employed include EIA and RT-PCR. 184, 186, 187 \n\nLike Rotavirus, hygienic measures designed to prevent fecal-oral transmission may not be effective.\n\nOther viruses linked to human disease and present in natural or treated waters include Circovirus, Torovirus, Picobirnavirus, and the Aichi virus, a newly identified member of the Picornavirus family. 188 Additionally, Caliciviruses associated with marine mammals are believed to be the source of land-based zoonoses. 189 The epidemiologic strength and public health importance of these associations remain to be determined.\n\nEukaryotes are living cells with organelles, including nuclei that contain the genetic material. They are generally large enough to be easily seen with a light microscope, and include protozoans, helminths, and fungi. The protozoans Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis are notifiable disease agents, requiring the notification of state public health physicians when they are found in patients.\n\nSingle-celled protozoan parasites typically have complex life cycles with specific intermediate host requirements. Most have at least two developmental forms: the vegetative 'trophozoite' and the cyst that can survive under adverse environmental conditions. Humans are host to nearly 300 species of parasitic worm and over 70 species of protozoa. 190 Protozoa come in all sizes; those that are best understood are much larger than bacteria, some even visible without a microscope. Protozoa often live freely in water, although parasites may prefer a host organism or may even be unable to reproduce in the environment.\n\nAcanthamoeba is one of the protozoan Amebae parasites. It is found in most water, including fresh, brackish, sea, tap, bottled mineral, sewage, gastrointestinal washings, contact lens solution, and eyewash station water; it is also found in hot tubs, soil, dust, and air, and in heating, airconditioning, ventilation, humidifiers, dialysis, and dental units. [191] [192] [193] [194] Acanthamoeba has been cultured from the upper airways of apparently healthy people and may be part of the normal flora. It is one of several ameboid eukaryotic lineages that undergoes slow gliding movements (others include Hartmannella, Valkampfia, and Naegleria). 111 Acanthamoeba may be free-living, parasitic, or opportunistic. In response to dry or cold environmental conditions, the motile trophozoite transforms into the cyst, protected and easily distributed throughout the environment. Cysts survive in water, soil, and dust for a year, unaffected by freezing, many chemicals, and some medications used to treat the vegetative forms.\n\nKeratitis and pneumonitis are the principal waterrelated syndromes caused by Acanthamoeba spp. 192, [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] Swimmers and diving activities in natural waters may offer an exposure route. In immunocompromised hosts, Acanthamoeba species also produce granulomatous amebic encephalitis, a chronic central nervous system disease. 200 Some sources cite the lower respiratory tract as one possible route of invasion, through the inhalation of cysts from air, aerosols, or dust. Another route may be via skin infections. 192, 196, 199, 201 Acanthamoeba may serve as a vector for pathogenic bacteria because it is host to Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium avium, and emerging pathogens, such as Parachlamydia and Simkania. 202, 203 These endosymbionts can enhance Acanthamoeba virulence or behave as pathogens on their own. The Parachlamydia strain Hall's coccus, for example, is transmitted by these amebae and was associated with fever in patients who used humidifiers in Vermont. 204, 205 Acanthamoeba hosts L. pneumophila and carries it in the cysts; Mycobacterium avium grows saprozoically on products secreted by Acanthamoeba and is found in the outer walls of the double-walled cysts. 206 Cysts may provide a reservoir for the bacteria when environmental conditions become unfavorable.\n\nWearers of contact lenses (hard, soft, or extended wear lenses) may develop keratitis, which is a sensation of a foreign body in the eye, tearing, blurred vision, photophobia, blepharospasm, and swelling of the upper eyelid. Keratitis can progress to corneal abscess; severe pain may imply a deep, long-standing infection, chronic ulceration of the corneal epithelium, and eventual loss of vision. Non-specific symptoms may be falsely diagnosed as herpes simplex keratitis, herpes zoster, fungal, and bacterial infection. 207\n\nAcanthamoeba has been found in the upper respiratory tract of healthy people as well as people with compromised immune systems. Most episodes of keratitis follow water exposure, such as a history of swimming in lakes and ponds while wearing contact lenses. 196, 199 Acanthamoeba infections are also linked to non-sterile home-made saline solutions for contact lenses. 199 Acanthamoeba enters skin or membranes through a cut or wound, or through the nostrils. Once inside the body, it can travel to the lungs and through the blood stream to other parts of the body, especially the central nervous system.\n\nAcanthamoeba is resistant to most commonly used antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antiviral agents. Some patients have been successfully treated using ketoconazole, miconazole, and propamidine isethionate.\n\nInhalation of cysts in dust or water can be limited by using a respirator or breathing mask. Eye infection can be limited by adhering to strict contact lens hygiene and cleaning regimens and not wearing lenses in pools, hot tubs, lakes, rivers, or oceans. Acanthamoeba is on the Candidate Contaminant List published by USEPA, and is undergoing consideration for regulation.\n\nEntamoeba histolytica is one of the intestinal Amebae parasites. In the US, those at risk for amebiasis due to E. histolytica include travelers, immigrants, migrant workers, immunocompromised individuals, institutionalized individuals, and sexually active homosexual males. 208\n\nThe incubation period varies from one to four months. Four major intestinal syndromes are caused by infection: (1) asymptomatic colonization; (2) acute amebic colitis, presenting with lower abdominal pain, bloody stools, and fever; (3) fulminant colitis in children presenting with diffuse abdominal pain, profuse bloody diarrhea, and fever; and (4) ameboma, an asymptomatic lesion or a tender mass accompanied by symptomatic dysentery. 209 Parasites can become disseminated and cause fatal disease.\n\nE. histolytica infects people worldwide. Transmission in water is common in developing countries, where human feces is sometimes used for fertilizer. 208\n\nCryptosporidium is a coccidian parasite that is present in large numbers in surface waters and that also lives in the intestines of animals and humans. Its outer shell helps it survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it highly resistant to chlorine disinfection. 211 Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of drinking or recreational waterborne disease outbreaks in humans in the United States. 211\n\nDiarrhea, loose or watery stool, and stomach upset caused by Cryptosporidium parvum persists for about two weeks. Illness can be accompanied by fever, and the severity of symptoms may increase or subside in cycles. Asymptomatic cases have also been observed. 211\n\nCryptosporidium is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. It is found in soil, food, water, or surfaces contaminated with feces of infected humans or animals. It is acquired by accidental swallowing of water from swimming pools, hot tubs, jacuzzis, fountains, lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, or streams contaminated with feces from infected humans or animals.\n\nCryptosporidium is highly resistant to chlorine and requires high levels and increased contact time for inactivation. Cryptosporidium can be viable for days in a swimming pool with public health mandated levels of chlorine. 13\n\nPhysical removal of the parasite from water by filtration has become an important component of municipal water treatment systems. 212 Filters must be capable of removing particles <1 \u03bcm to control Cryptosporidium. 212 Cryptosporidium is killed by boiling for one minute. 212\n\nIntroduction Cyclospora cayetanensis is a Coccidia parasite previously known as a 'cyanobacterium-like' or 'coccidia-like' body (CLB). Cyclosporiasis is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. There are many life-cycle variations in the genus Cyclospora, so the complete life cycle of C. cayetanensis has not been fully described. Infected persons excrete the oocyst stage of Cyclospora in their feces. When excreted, oocysts are not infectious and require 5-13 days to sporulate and become infectious. 211, 213 Parasites may be found in the jejunal enterocytes.\n\nCyclosporiasis onset begins with one day of malaise and low-grade fever, followed by rapid onset of diarrhea. 213 Infection is characterized by nausea, anorexia, abdominal cramping, watery diarrhea, constipation, and weight loss. 214 Symptoms last an average of seven weeks. [215] [216] [217] In AIDS patients, infections tend to last up to four months. 218\n\nTransmission of Cyclospora directly from an infected person to someone else is unlikely. Indirect transmission occurs when an infected person contaminates the environment and oocysts have sufficient time in water or food to become infectious. 211\n\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an effective treatment for Cyclospora infection. 211\n\nAvoiding food or water that may be contaminated with stool is the best way to prevent infection. Reinfection can occur.\n\nGiardia is a flagellate parasite that lives in the intestine of infected humans or animals. Giardiasis is the most prevalent waterborne disease in the United States. 219 The causative agent, Giardia intestinalis, was at one time called Giardia lamblia. Giardia is the most commonly diagnosed intestinal parasite in US public health laboratories. 12 From 1976 to 1994 it was found to be the etiologic agent most frequently associated with drinking water in the US. 197 The cyst is the stage found most commonly in non-diarrheal feces. Cysts are hardy, surviving several months in cold water. Animals may serve as a reservoir in the wild.\n\nA wide range of clinical symptoms are observed with Giardia infection, including diarrhea, flatulence, bloating, weight loss, abdominal cramps, nausea, malabsorption, foul smelling stools, steatorrhea, fatigue, anorexia, and chills. 12 The incubation period for giardiasis is 3-25 days. 12 Asymptomatic infections can also be observed. 211 Most children under the age of five have been infected with Giardia at least once. 75\n\nThe organism is transmitted by a fecal-oral route from person to person. Giardia cysts ingested with contaminated food or water develop into trophozoites that attach to the small intestine. 12, 75 Encystation occurs as parasites transit toward the colon.\n\nGiardia is sensitive to metronidazole (Flagyl), quinacrine hydrochloride, and furazolidone. High temperatures decrease the viability of Giardia in the environment. Giardia survives a month at 21 degrees C, but cysts are killed in ten minutes at 54 degrees C. 27\n\nImproved hygiene, with adequate disposal of fecal waste and washing of fruits and vegetables is the most effective control method. Use of granular filters and coagulation are effective against Giardia. Commonly used water disinfectants achieve adequate Giardia inactivation. Boiling water for one minute kills Giardia cysts. 75\n\nIntroduction Isospora belli is a Coccidia parasite related to Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora spp., and Toxoplasma spp. 220 Humans are the only known host. 213 Intestinal involvement and symptoms are usually transient, unless the patient is immunocompromised. 220 I. belli has been associated with outbreaks of diarrhea in institutional settings, daycare centers, World War II veterans from the Pacific, immigrants, and individuals with HIV infection.\n\nSymptoms develop a week after I. belli oocyst ingestion, including diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, cramping, and low-grade fever. 210, 221 The disease is usually selflimiting; however, oocyst shedding may persist for 2-3 weeks after the patient recovers. 210, 221, 222 Chronic illness occurs occasionally in infants or in otherwise healthy adults. 223 Disseminated infection may result from ingestion of large numbers of oocysts. 220, 224 \n\nInfective I. belli sporulated oocysts are spread through ingestion of food and water contaminated with feces. 213, 225 Susceptibility and resistance Several drugs will effectively treat I. belli: trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, co-trimoxazole, pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine, primaquine phosphate-nitrofurantoin, and primaquine phosphate-chloroquine-phosphate. 213\n\nPrevention of disease can be accomplished with improved personal hygiene and sanitation to eliminate possible fecal-oral transmission from food, water, or environmental surfaces. 213\n\nIntestinal Microsporidia includes over 100 genera and 1000 species. They are obligate intracellular parasites found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. 213 At least four genera are implicated in human disease: Encephalitozoon, Enterocytozoon, Pleistophora, and Vittaforma. 226, 227 Enterocytozoon bieneusi is known to have tissue specificity for the human intestinal tract. [228] [229] [230] \n\nBecause the route of human infection has not been fully characterized, the incubation period for microsporidial disease is unknown. Most infections are found in association with HIV infection. Microsporidia can cause chronic diarrhea without blood, dehydration, weight loss greater than 10% of body weight, keratitis, conjunctivitis, hepatitis, peritonitis, myositis, central nervous system infection, renal disease, sinusitis, and disseminated disease. 229, It has been speculated that Microsporidia may be present at low levels in human populations, becoming activated if an individual's immune system is compromised. 228, [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] \n\nE. bieneusi appears to be a zoonotic pathogen. 241 Common environmental sources of Microsporidia include surface water and runoff. It is possible that Microsporidia may undergo human-to-human fecal-oral, urinary-oral, ocular inoculation, sexual, or transplacental transmission. [242] [243] [244] Respiratory transmission occurs by inhalation, aspiration of gastrointestinal contents, or hematogenous dissemina-tion. 228 E. bieneusi can survive in 4 degrees C water for more than one year.\n\nTopical fumagillin appears to be successful against microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis. 245,246 E. intestinalis responds to albendazole therapy, but E. bieneusi does not. No other treatment success has been achieved. 230, 239, 247, 248 \n\nControl can be facilitated with improved hygiene, adequate disposal of fecal waste, and washing of contaminated fruits and vegetables.\n\nNaegleria is one of the Amebae parasites, commonly found in soil and warm fresh water (lakes, rivers, and hot springs, unchlorinated swimming pools, and in warm water discharge pools from industrial plants). 213 In the United States, the disease is generally acquired while swimming and diving in freshwater lakes and ponds. Only Naegleria fowleri has been found to infect humans, causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a rapidly progressing meningoencephalitis that is almost always fatal. Significant numbers of N. fowleri are found in water with high concentrations of iron and manganese and in water layers containing filamentous cyanobacteria and eubacteria, which serve as food sources.\n\nNaegleria fowleri infection is accompanied by headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, encephalopathic symptoms of confusion, apathy, loss of balance and bodily control, seizures, and hallucinations. Infection often results in death within 7-10 days. The incubation period is 2-7 days. Other symptoms include abnormalities of taste and smell, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, nuchal rigidity, photophobia, palsies of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, and increased intracranial pressure and coma. Cardiac abnormalities may also develop. Subclinical infections are possible in healthy people when N. fowleri colonizes the nose and throat. 191, 199, 249, 250 Eye infections may lead to blindness. 91\n\nNaegleria fowleri enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain and spinal cord while the person is swimming underwater or diving. Infection is most common during the dry, hot summer months, when the temperature is above 27 degrees C. The preferred environment for N. fowleri is the soil; however, heavy rains and runoff introduce this organism into lakes, ponds, and surface waters. 251, 252 N. fowleri can also be associated with household washing and bathing. 252\n\nAmphotericin B, an antifungal drug, is the only agent with established clinical efficacy in the treatment of N. fowleri, although therapy with this drug is not always effective and has been associated with adverse effects on the kidneys and other organs.\n\nSchistosoma are flukes (worms/helminths) belonging to the class Trematode. Flukes in infected humans are found in the liver and blood. Schistosomiasis occurs among people living in tropical and subtropical zones, with waterborne transmission from freshwater snails. In the US, schistosomiasis is principally found only in immigrants from endemic areas or Americans returning from endemic areas. 253 It is an occupational disease in people who are unable to avoid contact with untreated water. 254 Adult worms can live 20-30 years in the veins of the human abdominal cavity, with hundreds of eggs each day excreted in feces or urine. Affected occupations include agriculture, fishing, washing and bathing.\n\nSchistosoma symptoms vary with the species of worm and the phase of infection. Initial invasion of skin may cause itching and rash, heavy infestation may cause fever, chills, lymph node enlargement, and liver and spleen enlargement. Urinary symptoms include frequency, dysuria, and hematuria. Intestinal symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea (which may be bloody).\n\nTransmission of the parasites does not occur in the United States because of lack of suitable snail hosts, although dermatitis due to avian schistosomes occurs in the Great Lakes region. There the typical hosts are migratory water birds, including shorebirds, ducks, and geese. 255\n\nSchistosoma infection can be treated with praziquantel.\n\nInfection with Schistosoma can be avoided by eradication of snails and by avoiding swimming or bathing in untreated water from endemic areas."}
