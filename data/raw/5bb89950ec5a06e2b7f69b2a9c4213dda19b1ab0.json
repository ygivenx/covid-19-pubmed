{"title": "Prediction of New Coronavirus Infection Based on a Modified SEIR Model", "body": "At the beginning of the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection, some cases were related to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei. At first, it was diagnosed as \"unexplained pneumonia\", but it quickly spread to all parts of the country and parts of Southeast Asia, North America, and Europe. Wuhan City, Hubei Province, as a place of communication between the nine provinces, the large population movement, the influence of geographical factors, and the transmission characteristics of the new coronavirus have added many difficulties to the prevention and control of the epidemic. As of 13th February 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 46,997 confirmed cases 1 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020. 03 will reach its peak on February 16, 2020, and the number of confirmed patients will be 49,093 7 .\n\nCompared with SARS, the symptoms of latent virus infection in latent patients are not obvious but they are as infectious as the confirmed patients. This feature brings great difficulties to the prevention and control of the epidemic. Because the classical SEIR model assumes that the infected person's incubation period is not infectious, this assumption is quite different from the infection characteristics of the new coronavirus infection. Therefore, this article will use the revised SEIR model to analyze and predict the trend of the epidemic. The revised SEIR model still .

The normal birth rate and mortality during the study period are not considered; 2. The influence of external factors on the model parameters is ignored; 3. The transmission method is person-to-person. The model divides the total population into four categories: susceptible populations (S, not yet infected but at risk of being infected), latent or exposed people (E, including people with mild or asymptomatic but infectious populations), Infected (I, confirmed to be infectious) and removed (R, including those who have been cured and died from neocoronavirus infection). The first case of New Coronavirus infection was found on December 8, 2019. The average incubation period of New Coronavirus infection was 7 days, so this article believes that the first patient infected with New Coronavirus may already exist on December 1, 2019. It has not been diagnosed yet, this article classifies those who have been infected with the new coronavirus but are not diagnosed as latent people; when the latent people are diagnosed as infected people, they will be treated in isolation in the hospital, then I think the infected people will no longer have the possibility of infecting others. Establish models using ordinary differential equations based on model assumptions(1)\n\nWhere N represents the total population. N = S + E + I + R; \u03b2 represents the probability of infection between the susceptible and the latent, and can also be expressed as the product of the average number of daily exposures of the latent (k) and the probability of being infected (b) That is, \u03b2 = k * b, also known as the effective contact rate; \u03b1 indicates the conversion rate of the latent to the infected, which is the reciprocal of the incubation period; \u03b3 indicates the recovery rate, which is the reciprocal of the number of days in the treatment period.\n\nSince the New Coronavirus infected person has a latent period and is also infectious during the incubation period, the state change rate in the SEIR model depends not only on the current state but also on the past state. The current number of infections in I(t) includes two parts. First, it was transformed by the latent person, but because of the incubation period of the new coronavirus infection, the study by Li et al. Estimated that the incubation period is 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7). This article selects the incubation period as 7 days, so at time t The base for converting from a latent person to an infected person is the number of latent persons 7 days ago; the second is the number of infected persons at time t. Models can be built based on the delay difference .

It can be seen from Figure 1 that the epidemic began to concentrate in about 79 days (ie, February 7, 2020). It can be seen that the number of infected people will reach its peak in about 89 days (February 28). In the case of quarantine precautions, the number of infected people may reach 2,384,803, and will eventually come to an end after 103 days (March 13\n\nIn fact, the Wuhan Municipal Government not only implemented the city closure measures on January 23, but also regulated traffic facilities in Wuhan and closed down most public places. We can simulate the intensity of government control by adjusting the average number of people k infected each day. From December 1st to January 23rd, the Wuhan Municipal Government did not take effective isolation measures, so when t <54, k = 5; when t \u2265 54, the government adopted a series of strong measures such as the closure of the city and simulated them separately. The change in the number of infected persons at k = 1 and k = 2 can be obtained in Figures 2 and 3 .\n\nIt can be seen from Figure 2 that when the government takes precautionary measures to control the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 2, it can be seen that the number of infected persons reaches a peak after about 74 days, that is, February 12, 2020, and the number of infected persons is about 106,145 The epidemic situation is expected to come to an end in 90 days; when k = 1, it can be seen from Figure 3 that the number of infected people reached a peak about 70 days later, that is, February 8, 2020, and the number of infected people was about 74,369. It shows that when the government adopts effective quarantine measures, the number of infected people can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe daily increase of newly diagnosed cases shows that the time point for Wuhan to adopt measures such as closing the city is somewhat delayed. Figures 4 and 5 If the Wuhan municipal government lags behind for one day, it can be seen from the simulation results in Figures 6 and 7 that compared with the closure on January 23, the number of .

China's response to the epidemic is mainly divided into three stages: the first stage is to control the source of infection and block transmission around key areas in Hubei Province such as Wuhan; the second stage is to actively treat confirmed patients, reduce mortality, and prevent Export; the third stage is to reduce the epidemic situation, thoroughly control the disease epidemic, and significantly reduce the contact rate between people. In this paper, the trajectory of the curve is Therefore, local governments and public health departments should focus their efforts on controlling the source of infection and cutting off the transmission channels, such as early detection, early isolation, and early treatment, to reduce the gathering of large groups of people, and to regularly and completely kill public toilets and public spaces.\n\n.
