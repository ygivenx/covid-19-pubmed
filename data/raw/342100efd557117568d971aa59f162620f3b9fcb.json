One of the features that may explain why this novel 37 betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been successfully spreading around the globe, is the newly 38 acquired furin-like cleavage site 1 . Furin is ubiquitously expressed at different levels in all 39 tissues 2,3 . However, kinetics of furin-like enzyme activity are different among species -e. g. Table   53   S1 ). Before diving into the new features, we define major domains of SARS-CoV-2 S 54 glycoprotein, based on the available SARS-CoV-1 structure 5 : S1 subunit, that binds to the 55 receptor on the host cell surface 6 , and S2 subunit which plays a role in membrane fusion 7 . In 56 particular, S1 is composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 14-294) and three C-terminal (Figure 1 ). The S2 subunit is located downstream of S1 66 after the S1/S2 cleavage site (residue 667 for SARS-CoV and residue 660 for SARS-CoV-2). The 67 majority of the residues that differentiate human S glycoproteins from bat or pangolin were found 68 within the S1 subunit ( Figure 1a ). The S glycoprotein was under strong negative/purifying 69 selection with 775 out of 1273 sites were under negative/purifying selection (Table S3) , which 70 suggests the protein has reached a peak on the fitness landscape in terms of structure, stability 71 and folding 11 . We detected six amino acid positions within the S1 subunit under \n\n(2X)n-(R/K)* (or RXXR*SA) motif for the S1/S2 cleavage 12,13 , the S glycoprotein of the recently 90 emerged SARS-CoV-2 presents a solvent exposed furin-like cleavage sequence (PRRARS*V) in 91 positions 681-684 1 . We carried out a 90 ns-long simulation to assess the stability of the trimeric 92 structure of SARS-CoV-2 and whether the new gained favorable furin-like cleavage site alters the 93 overall structure of the S glycoprotein.\n\nAs recently reported 14 , the CTD1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein for the pre-fusion 95 conformation rotates outward from center of the triangular head to an \"up\" position, while this 96 conformation for SARS-CoV is \"down\" 5 ( Figure 1f ). One monomer of the SARS-CoV-2 S 97 glycoprotein, in fact, acquired the ability of being already in a pre-fusion conformation pointing the 98 ACE2 binding site in a different angle than its predecessor, thus giving SARS-CoV-2 99 advantageous ability to bind and enter into the cell. To test whether specific evolutionary 100 pressures allowed SARS-CoV-2 to display enhanced binding to the human binding receptor, we (Table S4) . Human SARS-\n\nCoV-2 strains were identified as potential parental sequences recombining with pangolin-SARS-\n\nCoV-2 isolated in 2019 and bat-SARS-CoV-2 strains; with a recombination event involving the 159 region of the S glycoprotein that binds to the cell receptor (Table 1) .

In spite of the frequency of recombination 225 events involving the S glycoprotein, the 5' end of the gene might sit into a recombination coldspot.\n\nWhile mutation/recombination events in the glycoprotein RBD might expand the virus tropism, 227 recombination coldspots and negative/diversifying selective pressure limit its variability to 228 maintain correct structure, and therefore function.
