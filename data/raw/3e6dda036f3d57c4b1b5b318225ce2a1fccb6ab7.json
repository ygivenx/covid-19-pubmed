At the time of writing on March 2 nd 2020, COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in 92 countries, with more than 100,000 cases globally. Wuhan is thought to be the site of earliest COVID-19 occurrence, and cases further afield were infected by SARS-CoV-2 carriers from Wuhan. In particular, the mortality of patients in Wuhan was higher than in any other city in China, at 4.3% compared with 0.8% in the rest of mainland China(updated data available at https://wp.m.163.com/163/page/news/virus_report/index.html?spss=feed&&spssid=a 64bed4d89174914f9792895db5b15e8&spsw=1). The clinical characteristics and outcome of patients seem to be different between Wuhan and other areas. Despite the publication of many articles regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 patients, most of these patients were considered in the context of Wuhan. Daofu, located within the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau at an altitude of more than 3000 m, is a low-income county in Sichuan Province, China. There are more than 3000 Tibetans living here.

When missing or uncertain records were encountered, the researchers communicated directly with patients or their families to collect and clarify the relevant data. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when symptoms were first noticed or the day when the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples from asymptomatic patients was positive. The patients were then divided into two groups based on the presence of clinical symptoms at time of admission. The symptomtic group was defined as those patients with any clinical symptoms such as fever, cough and headache.

Importantly, oxygenation index should be corrected if the local altitude is higher than 1000 m using the corrector formula: PaO2/FiO2*atmospheric pressure/760.\n\nPatient nasal and pharyngeal swabs or blood samples were collected for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid using real-time PCR assay. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by the local CDC as previously described 1 .\n\nCategorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were expressed as median + standard deviation (SD) or inter-quartile range (IQR). Continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney test. The chi-squared and Fisher's tests were used for the frequencies of categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 24, IBM, Armonk, NY). P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nA total of 67 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. All of them were Tibetans living in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau Twenty-six were members of one family ,34 had a history of attending a funeral or temple; however, none had visited Wuhan or had contact with Wuhan residents. The first patient to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection had travelled to Chengdu\uff0cthe city of westchina., 10 days before onset of symptoms but denied any contact with COVID-19 patients.

The youngest patient was 3 years old, with his family all confirmed as SARS-CoV-2-positive. Twenty (29.9%)of the total cohort had chronic diseases. Fever was present in only seven patients (10%) on admission and developed in a further nine (24%) during hospitalization. Thirty-six patients (54%) showed no clinical symptoms when they were admitted to hospital. The remaining 31 patients (46%) presented with clinical symptoms, of which cough was the most common (13/67, 19%). Other symptoms included fatigue, headache, muscle ache and dizziness. Of note, the asymptomatic group was significantly younger than the symptomatic group, with median ages of 34 and 44 years (P=0.02), respectively.

None of these patients had a history of exposure to COVID-19 cases from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan. However, most of them had a history of attending a gathering or contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected family. Isolation of cases and contact tracing has been implemented for COVID-19 2 .\n\nIn our study, most patients did not present with typical clinical symptoms at time of admission. This is inconsistent with recent studies, which have most commonly found fever and cough to be the dominant symptoms 3, 4 . In our study, fever was only found in 10% of patients on admission and increased to13.5% during hospitalization. Cough was only presented by 18% of patients. The absence of fever and cough was frequent in our study. Unlike the other studies that included only the cases who actively sought medical attention 3 , our cohort included sub-or preclinical cases identified by local CDC collection of nasal and pharyngeal secretion samples from most residents to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, even though the majority of residents had no clinical symptoms or any history of exposure to COVID-19 cases. Through active screening, we found 36 virus carriers without clinical symptoms. If surveillance relies on fever detection or on patients actively seeking medical advice due to clinical symptoms, many potential virus carriers may be missed.\n\nLymphocytopenia was common, especially in those with clinical symptoms, which is consistent with the data reported recently. Nearly half of patients showed increased levels of LDH, while one-third of patients suffered liver injury and decreased levels of prealbumin. However, these changes were mild. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may act as a potential intermediate host receptor which transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to human. ACE2 is expressed in liver tissue and an overactive inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause increased ACE2 expression, and thus result in the observed liver tissue injury 5, 6 . Therefore, in addition to the obvious target organ of the lungs, the liver is another important organ that is vulnerable following infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn our study, the condition of most patients was mild, with only 10% of patients developing to severe disease. After antiviral and oxygen therapies, the patients' conditions gradually stabilized, with none succumbing to disease. The fatality rate All rights reserved.

In addition, the altitude at which our cohort lives is higher than 3000 m and so virus viability and virulence may be decreased. The second reason may be that the median age was 39.3 years in our study, which was younger than that reported by Huang et al 7 . Interestingly, the median age of patients with clinical symptoms was older than that of asymptomatic patients (44.9 vs 34.4 years, P=0.02). In general, older persons appear more susceptible to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer severe disease, which may be due to underlying health issues and comorbidities 8 . In our study , the mean age of severe cases were 58.5 years. A further reason for the discrepancy in mortality rates between our study and the national figures may be that because the local CDC actively screened a large number of residents, approximately half of the patients were identified and admitted to hospital before clinical symptoms appeared. Patients therefore received treatment at the earliest stages of disease. Early identification and timely treatment are of crucial importance for effective prevention of severe disease.\n\nOur study has some notable limitations. First, only 67 patients were included, although this study describes the largest cohort of Tibetan patients. With the effective measures taken by the government, the number of new patients has decreased.\n\nSecond, some patients remained in hospital and the outcome is unknown at the time of data cutoff. We will continue to focus on the prognosis of these patients and report outcomes in due course.\n\nIn conclusion, imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tibetan patients were generally mild in this high-altitude area. Absence of fever or radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation was common. Our findings highlight the importance of active screening for residents who live in areas with high incidence rate of COVID-19."}
