{"title": "Profiling of Substrate Specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro\n", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of a lethal pneumonia discovered in 2003 [1], [2]. The single-stranded RNA viral genome encodes two polyproteins consisting of 15 non-structural proteins [3], [4]. Activation of these non-structural proteins requires proteolytic cleavage by papain-like protease and 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Inhibiting 3CLpro proteolysis is a convincing strategy against SARS because it suppresses viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects [5], [6], [7], [8].\n\nNative 3CLpro is a homodimer. Each protomer of 34 kDa is divided into three domains [9], [10], [11]. Domain I (residue 8\u2013101) and II (residue 102\u2013184) form a substrate-binding cleft, while domain III (residue 201\u2013303) is responsible for dimerization. Catalytic mechanism of 3CLpro resembles that of a typical cysteine protease. Cleavage of the peptide bond between P1 and P1' positions is catalyzed by the Cys145 and His41 dyad [12]. Domain III is also essential in the proteolysis, as the protease is active only in dimeric conformation [13].\n\nGln is absolutely conserved at P1 position among the 11 3CLpro cleavage sites in the polyproteins. Previous studies showed that P2 position accommodates hydrophobic residues with large side chains such as Leu and Phe, while P1' position tolerates small-sized residues [14], [15]. Substitutions at P5 to P3' positions were found to affect the 3CLpro activity, but comprehensive studies on substrate specificity at these positions are scarce [16], [17].\n\nChu et al. synthesized peptide substrates with single residue substitution at each of the P4, P3, P2, P1', P2' and P3' positions [18]. The cleavage of these peptide substrates by 3CLpro was detected by mass spectrometry. They showed that cleavage was detected only when Leu and Phe were present at P2 position. Peptide substrates with acidic residues at P1' position and with Ile/Leu at P2' position were not cleavable. All substitutions at P4 and P3' positions resulted in cleavable substrates. Their detection method can only determine qualitatively whether the peptide substrate is cleavable, but not the relative cleavage rate of different substitutions. Goetz et al. profiled the specificity at P4 to P1 positions using a fully degenerate library of tetrapeptides linked with a fluorogenic group at the C-terminus [19]. Contradictory to the common belief that P1 position only takes Gln, they showed that 3CLpro can cleave the peptide substrates containing His at P1 position equally well. However, in their hands, peptide substrates with Phe at P2 position have no observable cleavage, which is inconsistent with the observation that Phe is naturally occurring at this position of the autocleavage sequence of polyproteins. It is, therefore, unknown whether the tetrapeptide is a good model for substrate specificity for 3CLpro.\n\nHere, we report the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro at P5 to P3' positions by using protein substrates. The wild-type (WT) protein substrate consists of the autocleavage sequence (TSAVLQ\u2193SGFRKM) inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP) so that the cleavage can be monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We created a substrate library of 198 variants by saturation mutagenesis at each of P5 to P3' positions, and measured the cleavage rate of 3CLpro against these substrate variants. The results were correlated with various properties of substituting residues including side chain volume, hydrophobicity and \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet propensities [20], [21], [22]. The substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was discussed based on the quantitative correlation obtained.\n\nThe recombinant protein substrate comprised the autocleavage sequence (TSAVLQ\u2193SGFRKM) inserted between CFP and YFP (Figure 1A). After digestion by 3CLpro, the substrate of 58 kDa was cleaved into two fragments of 28 and 30 kDa (Figure 1B). N-terminal sequencing confirmed that 3CLpro cleaved the protein substrate specifically at the peptide bond between P1 and P1' positions. Separation of the two fluorescent proteins caused the reduction in FRET efficiency, and the reaction rate was followed by time-dependent decrease of emitted fluorescence at 530 nm (Figure 1C). The observed rate constants, kobs, were measured at 1 to 4 \u00b5M of 3CLpro. The specific activity, kobs/[3CLpro], for WT autocleavage sequence was determined by the slope of kobs against 3CLpro, which was 71\u00b111 mM\u22121 min\u22121 (Figure 1D).\n\nWe performed saturation mutagenesis at P5 to P3' positions of the autocleavage sequence to create a substrate library of 198 variants. The relative cleavage rate of 3CLpro against these substrate sequences was measured (Figure 2, Table S1). In general, solvent-exposed sites such as P5, P3, and P3' positions were less selective than the others. The most selective site was P1 position \u2013 cleavage was only observable with Gln, His or Met. Substrate sequences with Pro substitutions at P3, P1', P2' positions were not cleavable.\n\nWe also noted that solvent-exposed sites such as P5, P3 and P3' positions preferred positively charged substitutions, as the protease activity on the Arg/Lys-substituting variants was consistently higher than that of the Asp/Glu-substituting variants. The difference was the largest at P3 position, where positively charged substitutions resulted in 12-fold higher in proteolytic activity. P5 and P3' variants with positive charges were also 3-fold higher in activity.\n\nThe preference on charged residues indicated that electrostatic interaction, which is long-range in nature, may play a role in 3CLpro catalysis. One of the possibilities is that the positive charges stabilize the transition state of catalysis. It is expected that the carboxylate group at P1 residue will be converted to an oxyanion during the formation of the transition state. Presence of positive charges near the active site may electrostatically stabilize the oxyanion and thus promote catalysis. Another possibility is a direct electrostatic interaction between positively charged residues of substrate and negatively charged residues of 3CLpro. There is a Glu166 located at substrate binding cleft that can interact with P3 residue. This may explain why P3 position has the strongest preference for positively charged residues.\n\nTo demonstrate the preferred properties of substituting residues, 3CLpro activity was correlated with side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet propensities [20], [21], [22]. The correlation coefficients (r) and p-values were showed in table 1. Significant correlations with p-value<0.01 were observed in a number of cases and the substrate preferences for each of the positions were discussed below.\n\nAll substitutions at P5 position were cleavable, and the relative activity ranged from 0.37 to 1.92. Many substitutions resulted in activity significantly higher than that for WT substrate (Figure 2). S5V (1.92\u00b10.07) was the most preferred substrate variant, followed by S5F (1.62\u00b10.06) and S5T (1.52\u00b10.09). A strong correlation was observed between the relative activity and \u03b2-sheet propensity (r = 0.711, p<0.001) (Table 1, Figure 3A). The relative activity also correlated well with the hydrophobicity of substituting residues (r = 0.573, p = 0.008) (Table 1).\n\nThe best substitutions were Cys and Val, with relative activity of 1.32\u00b10.24 and 1.30\u00b10.15, respectively (Figure 2). The relative activity correlated well with hydrophobicity (r = 0.587, p = 0.006) (Table 1). The correlation was more evident (r = 0.942, p<0.001) when we excluded residues with side chain volume >80 \u00c53 from the analysis (Figure 3B). From the crystal structure of 3CLpro-substrate complex, the side chain of P4 is completely buried inside a small hydrophobic pocket [23]. Our data suggest that for those residues that are small enough to fit into the binding pocket, the relative activity is directly proportional to the hydrophobicity of the substituting residues. No observable cleavage was detected for charged residues (Arg, Asp, Glu and Lys), probably due to the high desolvation penalty for burial of charges inside the hydrophobic pocket.\n\nThe relative activity for P3 variants correlated well with \u03b2-sheet propensity (r = 0.510, p = 0.022) (Table 1). As discussed above, P3 position favors positively charged residues over negatively charged one. After excluding the charged residues, we found that 3CLpro activity was directly proportional to the \u03b2-sheet propensity of substituting residues (r = 0.729, p = 0.001) (Figure 3C). In the crystal structure of 3CLpro-substrate complex, the P3-Val is in \u03b2-sheet conformation, which facilitates the formation of two hydrogen bonds between backbone peptide groups of P3-Val and Glu166 of 3CLpro\n[23]. Residues with high \u03b2-sheet propensity at P3 position may help to maintain these two hydrogen bonds and results in higher protease activity.\n\nDetectable cleavage was only observed for hydrophobic substitutions at P2 position (Figure 2, 3D). When all 20 residues were included in the correlation analysis, the relative activity was found to correlate with hydrophobicity (r = 0.590, p = 0.006) (Table 1). The most favorite residue at P2 position was Leu (1.00\u00b10.08), followed by Met (0.68\u00b10.06) and Phe (0.42\u00b10.05). On the other hand, \u03b2-branched residues like Ile (0.13\u00b10.01) and Val (0.09\u00b10.01) were less preferred, although their hydrophobicity is similar to that of Leu. Taken together, our results suggest that P2 position prefers hydrophobic residues without \u03b2-branch.\n\nThe substrate was cleavable when P1 position was a Gln, His or Met (Figure 2). Other substitutions were not cleavable. The most favorable residue was Gln, which is an invariant residue at P1 position of the 3CLpro substrate sequences. Substitution to His or Met resulted in reduced relative activities of 0.26\u00b10.02 and 0.10\u00b10.01, respectively. Our observation that P1-His was cleavable is consistent with another study by Goetz et al. based on tetrapeptide substrates [19]. However, in their case, the activity of P1-His substrate was even higher than that of the WT sequence of P1-Gln.\n\nIn the crystal structure of 3CLpro-substrate complex, the O\u03b51 and N\u03b52 atoms of P1-Gln form hydrogen-bonds to N\u03b52 atom of His163 and backbone carbonyl group of Phe140, respectively (Figure 4). We modeled how 3CLpro recognizes P1-His using SWISS-PDBViewer [24]. In the modeled structure, although P1-His can fit into substrate binding pocket without steric hindrance, it is no longer in an optimal position to form hydrogen bonds with His163 and Phe140 (Figure 4). Instead, the N\u03b52 atom of P1-His position can form a hydrogen bond with the amide group of Asn142. From this point of view, substitution of His at P1 position should weaken the enzyme-substrate interaction, which justified our observation that the P1-His is a poorer substrate than P1-Gln.\n\nThe relative activity of P1' variants negatively correlated with the side chain volume (r = \u22120.660, p = 0.002) (Table 1). The most preferred residues at P1' position were Ser (1.00\u00b10.08), Ala (0.99\u00b10.06), Cys (0.97\u00b10.18), and Gly (0.78\u00b10.08). Substitutions with residues larger than Cys resulted in dramatic decreases in the relative activity (Figure 3E). Our results suggest that P1' position prefers small residues with side chain volumes less than 50 \u00c53.\n\nNo significant correlation was found for P2' and P3' positions except the preference for positively charged residues discussed above (Table 1). However, it was noted that small residues such as Gly, Ala and Ser tend to have higher relative activity than the other large residues at P2' position.\n\nOur results showed that substitutions to Phe, Thr and Val at P5 position and to Val at P4 position resulted in significant increases in 3CLpro activity (Figure 2). We also showed that P3 position favors positively charged residues. To test if we can generate a \u2018super-active\u2019 substrate sequence by combining the best substitutions at these positions, we created three variants with double-substitution (FVVLQ\u2193SGF, TVVLQ\u2193SGF and VVVLQ\u2193SGF) and three variants with triple-substitution (FVRLQ\u2193SGF, TVRLQ\u2193SGF and VVRLQ\u2193SGF). The relative activity of 3CLpro against these substrate sequences was determined (Figure 5). In general, the relative activity was further increased by introduction of more favorable substitutions. Triple substitution resulted in the best substrate sequence, TVRLQ\u2193SGF, with a relative activity of 2.84\u00b10.25. Noteworthy, docking simulation by Phakthanakanok et al. ranked TVKLQ\u2193AGF and TVRLQ\u2193AGF as the sequences with the lowest docking energy for 3CLpro-substrate interaction [25].\n\nFan et al. introduced a few selected single-substitutions at P5 to P1' positions to an octapeptide substrate, and monitored the 3CLpro activity by high performance liquid chromatography [16]. In general, the protease activity measured using their 28 octapeptide substrate variants agreed with the profile reported in our study. For example, both studies showed that substitutions at P5 position resulted in substrate variants with activity higher than that for WT, suggesting that P5 residue plays an important role in the 3CLpro-substrate interaction. Consistent with our suggestion that positively charged residues are preferred at P3 position, Fan et al. showed that the P3-Lys substrate variant also had a relative activity higher than the WT P3-Val substrate.\n\nGoetz et al. used a fully degenerate tetrapeptide library to study the substrate specificity of 3CLpro at P4 to P1 positions [19]. The library consisted of 204 sub-libraries, each consisted of a mixture of 203 tetrapeptides with one common residue at a particular position and degenerate residues at the other positions. Consistent with our results, they showed that 3CLpro can cleave both His and Gln at P1 position. It is noteworthy that the reported protease activity for P1-His substrates was slightly higher than that for the P1-Gln substrates. In contrast, our data suggested that P1-His is cleavable but with a lower relative activity of 0.26\u00b10.02. Goetz et al. argued that the binding mode of His and Gln to the S1 pocket is similar because the N\u03b52 and N\u03b51 atoms of P1-His can take the approximate positions of N\u03b52 and O\u03b51 atoms of P1-Gln. However, a close inspection of their models revealed that such binding mode of P1-His requires structural changes of the backbone atoms of the P1 residue. The structural changes may be accommodated in their tetrapeptide substrates, which lack residues beyond P1' position that may restrict the backbone conformation of the substrate. In contrast, we argue that for the protein substrate used in our study, it is likely that the backbone conformation of the substrate will be held by extensive interaction of residues from P5 to P3' positions. As discussed above, our model suggests that P1-His should form weaker interaction with the 3CLpro (Figure 4), justifying the observation that P1-Gln is preferred over P1-His in the native cleavage sequences in the SARS-CoV polyproteins.\n\nMoreover, the results of Goetz et al. indicated that substrates containing P2-Phe was not cleavable [19]. This finding is in direct contradiction with the results reported in this study and in the study of Fan et al.\n[16], and with the fact that P2-Phe is naturally occurring in the C-terminal autocleavage sequence of 3CLpro. Considering that the protease activity measured in the study of Goetz et al. represented the ensemble average of a mixture of 203 degenerate peptides, we speculate that their results could be biased by many non-cleavable combinations of sequences within their libraries.\n\nIn this study, the substrate specificity of 3CLpro was profiled using a library of protein substrates. The effect of residue substitution at P5 to P3' positions were investigated (Table 2). The comprehensive data obtained allowed us to quantitatively correlate the substrate specificity in terms of side chain volume, hydrophobicity and secondary structure propensities. Not only our results are consistent with some of the previous observations, novel insights into the substrate specificity were obtained in this study. First, positively charged residues are consistently preferred over negatively charged ones at solvent-exposed positions such as P5, P3, P3'. Second, the 3CLpro activity is directly proportional to hydrophobicity for small residues at P4, and to \u03b2-sheet propensities at P5 and P3 positions. Third, residues larger than Cys are not favored at P1' position. Fourth, the most favorite residue at P1 position is Gln, but P1-His and P1-Met are also cleavable. Our results suggest the existence of a strong structure-activity relationship between 3CLpro and its substrates. The substrate specificity profiled in this study can be used as a benchmark for better computational simulation for 3CLpro-substrate/inhibitor interaction, and may provide a guideline for a rational based design of potent inhibitors.\n\nDNA fragment encoding the protease was amplified by polymerase chain reaction based on strain CUHK-Su10 sequence (GenBank AY282752) [26]. The coding sequence of 3CLpro was cloned into a fusion-protein expression vector so that the 3CLpro is tagged with poly-Histidine-maltose binding protein (His6-MBP) at the N-terminus. A factor Xa cleavage sequence was present between 3CLpro and the tag for subsequent removal of the tag by factor Xa digestion. Expression of recombinant 3CLpro was induced by 0.4 mM of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS during mid-log phase. The cells were grown at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours, followed by sonication in buffer A (20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) with 10mM imidazole. Soluble fraction was subjected to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and the recombinant protein was eluted by buffer A with a gradient of 10 to 300 mM imidazole. The His6-MBP tag was removed by factor Xa digestion in 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4 overnight, and by IMAC. The protease was finally purified by G75 size exclusion column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Elution profile showed that the protease was a dimer in solution.\n\nA pET3a plasmid encoding the recombinant WT substrate (His6-CFP-TSAVLQSGFRKM-YFP) was constructed (Figure 1A). For construction of the protein substrate library, 19\u00d78 mutations were introduced at P5 to P3' positions by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The protein substrate expression was induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by shaking of culture at 22\u00b0C overnight. After sonication, the expressed protein was purified by IMAC and stored in buffer A.\n\n35 \u00b5M of the recombinant substrate was rapidly mixed with 1 to 4 \u00b5M of 3CLpro in 96-well black Optiplate. The cleavage of the protein substrate was monitored by FRET using EnVision 2101 Multilabel Plate Reader. The reaction mixture was excited by light passing though a 430 nm filter (with 8 nm bandwidth), and the intensity of emitted fluorescence passing though a 530 nm filter (with 10 nm bandwidth) was recorded. For Cys variants, 2.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added to prevent disulphide bond formation.\n\nThe observed rate constant, kobs, was obtained by fitting the emitted fluorescence at 530 nm to a single exponential decay. The specific activity of 3CLpro on variant substrates, AVAR, was determined by the slope of kobs/[3CLpro], and was normalized against the value for WT sequence, AWT, to obtain the relative activity:The assay for each substrate was performed in triplicate.\n\nThe relative activity was correlated with various structural properties of substituting residues, including side chain volume [20], hydrophobicity [21], and \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet propensities [22] (Table S2). Coefficients and p-values of the correlations were obtained."}
