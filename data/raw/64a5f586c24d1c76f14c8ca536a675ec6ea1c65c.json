{"title": "", "body": "Despite decreasing TB-associated mortality in Taiwan, in 2008, TB was still ranked the 15 th highest cause of death, with three deaths per 100,000 population. By contrast, the mortality rates in the United States, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and Vietnam in 2006 were 0.5, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 7, respectively. 1 In 2006, the Stop TB Plan 2006-2015 was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), with the goal of halving TB incidence and mortality by 2015. 3 To further TB control efforts, in 2006 the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) additionally launched the \"Program to Halve TB Incidence in Ten Years\", based on the objectives of the WHO. Control efforts included an expanded directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) program for sputum-smearpositive cases in 2006, and a DOTS-plus strategy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients, which consisted of five medical care teams, conducting therapy for latent TB among children < 12 years of age, and the commissioning of academic institutions to administer intervention programs in 2007. 4 The aim of the present study was to describe the epidemiology of TB in Taiwan over the past 7 years (2002-2008) and to evaluate preliminary changes in incidence and mortality rates.\n\nAccording to the Taiwanese Communicable Disease Control Act, suspected or confirmed TB cases must be reported to the CDC upon physician verification. All data of new confirmed TB cases were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Registry System, which was established in 1994. Records were computerized in 1996, and the system has used internet-based case reporting and management since 2002. 5 A total of 109,179 new confirmed TB cases were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Registry System and 6,890 deaths due to TB were obtained from the Office of Statistics, Department of Health. \n\nA patient was diagnosed with TB if one or more of the following criteria were met: sputum or body fluid and tissue that was smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli and/or culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex; clinical and radiographic appearance consistent with TB; or radiographic evidence of improvement or clinical symptom improvement with a course of anti-TB chemotherapy; and excluding nontuberculous Mycobacterium and other non-TB diagnosis. \n\nMidyear population data for Taiwan were obtained from the Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior. 8 The incidence rate was measured as patients diagnosed with TB during a given year divided by the Taiwanese population midyear. Mortality rate was defined as the number of TBcaused deaths in a given year divided by the midyear population of that year. The rate of change was defined as the percent change in incidence or mortality from one year to the next. The age-standard incidence rate was calculated by dividing the number of TB cases in each age group, which measured as the incidence rate of countries via the WHO 2000 age-standardized population, by the total number of the standardized population. Age-specific death rates were calculated in same manner. Excel 2007 was used to calculate all the study data.\n\nDemographic data of verified TB patients from 2002 to 2008 are presented in Table 1 . Between 2002 and 2008, the number of new TB cases declined from 16,758 to 14,265, and the incidence rate declined from 75 per 100,000 population to 62 per 100,000 population, reflecting an 17% decline in TB incident rate and an annual mean rate decrease of 3%.\n\nDuring the 7-year study period, the median age of the cohort increased from 63 years to 66 years, and incidence declined significantly in all age groups except among individuals aged 0-14 years. The incidence rate among men was approximately twice that in women in each year. Incidence declined annually for all age groups; however, the disease burden was felt most acutely in elderly patients, especially in those aged \u2265 65 years. Among incident TB patients, > 50% were elderly. In fact, those aged \u2265 65 years showed the highest TB incidence rate during the study period, whereas the rate of TB in the youngest age group (0-14 years) remained constant over time compared to that of other age groups.\n\nOf all new cases, > 90% were pulmonary TB (PTB); extrapulmonary TB accounted for 10.4% of new cases in 2002 and 4.4% in 2008. With all extrapulmonary TB cases, pleural effusion was predominant (approximately 25%), and approximately 7% of cases had tuberculous meningitis during 2002-2008 (data not shown in Table 1 ). Based on the sputum bacteriology, the rate of smear-or culture-positive PTB increased slightly over the study period.\n\nTB-associated mortality rates and associated factors are presented in Table 2 . TB-associated deaths decreased from 1,277 deaths in 2002 to 762 deaths in 2008, and the mortality rate fell from six per 100,000 population to three per 100,000 population. Among TB-associated deaths, more than three times as many deaths occurred among men than women. We found that TBassociated mortality increased with age. The median age of TB patients was 76-79 years, and > 80% were \u2265 65 years old. The highest burden of TB mortality continues to be among elderly patients.\n\nThe geographical distribution of TB in Taiwan is shown in Table 3 . The eastern area consistently had higher TB incidence rates than the Kao-Ping and southern areas. Age-adjusted incidence rate also revealed that the eastern area had higher TB incidence rates, followed by Kao-Ping area. This was particularly true in Hualien County, where the incidence rate was the highest from 2002 to 2008. However, new cases in the eastern area made up only 4% of all cases, whereas the Taipei area consistently contributed the most cases (27-30%) during each year of the study.\n\nThe case-mortality rate was consistently highest in the eastern and Kao-Ping areas and lowest in the Taipei area. Even after age adjustment, the eastern area still had the highest case-mortality rate. Incidence and mortality rates between 2005 and 2008 declined by 14% and 23%, respectively. Decreasing incidence between 2005 and 2008 was seen in six parts of the eastern area, which showed the greatest decline of 22% during that period. Among the 25 Taiwanese cities/ counties assessed, the greatest decline was seen in Lienchiang County, while cases increased in three jurisdictions. Decreases in mortality rates were seen in all areas except the Taipei area. The central area had the greatest decline during 2005-2008 (34%). For regions with intervention programs started in 2006, Hsinchu County had an 11% increase in incidence in 2006, while in 2007 and 2008, there was an 18% and 19% decline, respectively (Table 4 ).\n\nWe found declining rates of TB-associated incidence (17% decline) and mortality (42% decline) from 2002 to 2008 in Taiwan been associated with the lowest TB case number in that year. Most TB-associated incidence and mortality were seen in the elderly population. Fifty percent of TB cases in Taiwan were seen in people over the age of 65 years. The higher rate of TB in older adults is due in part to reactivation of disease with age. Elderly people, who make up 10% of the total population, 9 are at higher risk for diabetes mellitus or other immunosuppressive disease. 10 Older age (\u2265 60 years) and comorbid conditions are factors that are independently associated with unfavorable outcomes. 11 Consistent with our findings, advanced age was also associated with poor treatment outcomes in a study in Finland. 12 Similar to our findings, the majority of TB patients in other Asian countries were older adults: in Japan, 54.5% were \u2265 65 years, 13 and in Singapore, 55% were \u2265 50 years. 14 Therefore, TB in the elderly population is becoming an important issue for disease control and could influence treatment outcome of TB in Taiwan.\n\nDespite the high rates of TB in the elderly population, incidence rates decreased in every age group in each year of our study, despite the fact that the distribution of patient ages remained constant throughout the study period. The lowest TB incidence was seen in the youngest age group (0-14 years) in each year of the study. The lowest incidence of TB in the youngest group is related to the effectiveness of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccination, 15 or to the shorter exposure period.\n\nThe rate of smear-or culture-positive PTB increased slightly over the study period. Since 2002, Taiwan CDC has followed the WHO recommendations to encourage patients with cough lasting > 3 weeks to seek medical advice, and to implement a sputum examination policy, as well as the national sputum examination network. Therefore, the increased positive rates might reflect the strengthening and implementation of these policies.\n\nBased on WHO data, the expected percentage of new pulmonary cases that are smear-positive is 65-80%; 1 however, in Taiwan we found a lower smear-positive rate (approximately 50% each year) among PTB patients. This might be explained by the tendency of physicians to use radiography as a diagnostic tool rather than sputum examinations, poor patient adherence to sputum collection, In addition to executing the NTP, Hsinchu County started a special program in coordination with the Community Medicine Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, and Human Rights Education Foundation. This program was designed to compile educational materials on TB prevention and human rights, coordinate efforts with local health bureaus, recruit volunteer healthcare workers and organize various community education efforts to help residents learn about signs and symptoms of TB and about treatment options. The program also involves the use of a simple screening method, 16 so that the residents can be made aware of their lung conditions, receive chest X-ray examinations, and discover silent cases at an early stage. As a result of these efforts, the TB incidence in this region increased in 2006, while the mortality declined. In 2007 and 2008, declines in incidence continued, but the mortality rate rose. Continued assessment of the long-term effectiveness of these prevention efforts is warranted. In 1947, there were 18,533 deaths due to TB in Taiwan, accounting for 16.2% of the total deaths that year (a rate of 294 per 100,000 population). In 1985, TB was excluded from the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan for the first time. 5 In 2002, there were < 1,000 TB-associated deaths, and in 2004, TB dropped to 13 th on the list of causes of death. TB prevention efforts seem to be working, based on declining mortality rates year by year. Nonetheless, the 2008 mortality rate was 3.3 per 100,000 population, which was higher than in developed countries, including the United States (< 1 per 100,000 population), Japan (3 per 100,000 population), and Singapore (2 per 100,000 population). 1 Although older age is significantly associated with death, 17 the age distribution of TB patients in Taiwan was similar to that in Japan and Singapore, namely > 50% were aged > 50 years old; however, the mortality, in those countries was lower than that in Taiwan. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic presents a massive challenge to TB control programs worldwide. 18 Although, under the implementation of a harm-reduction program in 2006, the number of HIV cases has declined in Taiwan, 19 it is worth noting that HIV is the main reason for failure to meet TB control targets in countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection. If we fail to control HIV effectively, the decline in incidence and mortality rate might be threatened; therefore, close monitoring of HIV-related TB remains essential in Taiwan. In addition, MDR-TB, a man-made problem, significantly contributes to the TB burden worldwide. 20 Molecular epidemiology studies have suggested that some M. tuberculosis strains are able to disseminate more quickly than others, and can therefore thwart preventive efforts. [21] [22] [23] Thus, close surveillance of MDR-TB prevalence and vigilant treatment are very important. Although the DOTS-Plus program has been promoted by the Taiwan CDC since 2007, special attention must be paid to MDR-TB according to WHO recommendations.\n\nThe purpose of confirming TB-related deaths by physicians of the Taiwan CDC was to improve the accuracy of cause of death, because of overestimates in previous years. However, underestimates of TB-related death might occur due to excessive caution by physicians when cause of death is in doubt, and this might have been a limitation of our study.\n\nIn summary, we found that TB-associated incidence and mortality declined in Taiwan from 2002 to 2008. The NTP was implemented in 2006. The initial evaluation of its effectiveness in its first 3 years suggests that it has been effective in reducing TB-associated incidence and mortality. Sustained monitoring of the effectiveness of the NTP is necessary. Furthermore, in cities and counties that have seen an increase in TB, local health authorities and the CDC need to focus their efforts on controlling TB and investigating the reasons for its increase, with special attention paid to rigorous surveillance of rate fluctuations, especially regarding TB incidence."}
