The SKC Biosampler has been 78 found to have greater viral recovery compared to other commonly used filter-based samplers; 79 however, the differences across samplers were not statistically significant. [13] [14] [15] 80 81 Filters are used frequently as a sampling media in personal samplers in the field of exposure 82 assessment. Filter based samplers have also been used in the collection of aerosolized viruses due 83 to their efficiency in collecting sub-micrometer particles 10, 16 , and ability to be used for longer 84 periods in the field compared to impinger based methods. 17,18 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 85 polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate, and gelatin-containing filters have all been used to 86 collect virus 10,19 , with PTFE and PVC being the most efficient among filter materials tested. 16, 19 87 Nevertheless, the viral recovery from PTFE and PVC filter materials remains inefficient. 10\n\nThere are many other materials that can be used to fabricate filters for collection of bioaerosols. 90 For example, a new filter material made from polystyrene (PS) has been developed to be used in 91 the collection of bioaerosols. PS filters have been fabricated from electrospun fibers, yielding 92 materials with large surface areas and small pore sizes that make them very efficient in filtering 93 applications. 20 The hydrophobicity of the PS filter material may assist the viral capsid attachment 94 proteins and other biomolecules to adsorb to the fiber surfaces. 21 Furthermore, the use of PS as a 95 centrifuge tube material is common in the field of molecular biology, therefore it is hypothesized 96 that PS will perform well as a filter material for sampling aerosolized virus in the field of 97 exposure science.

Airflow was adjusted during the experimental trial to 146 maintain a target 50% relative humidity during the entire experiment. Influenza A plasmid, a standard curve was generated for each RT-qPCR experiment. The anti-203 log (10\u02e3) was then calculated to get total viral copies in the 5 \u00b5L of the isolated RNA PCR 204 reaction. The viral copy data were then volume adjusted to represent the total viral copies per 205 sample. Data were analyzed in R 35 using multiple linear regression at a single comparison type 1 206 error rate of 0.05. A random-effects model was also constructed to evaluate evidence for a batch 207 effect, though no systematic batch-to-batch variation was detected.

PTFE is often considered the optimal filter material in virus 242 collection 10 ; however, the results from this experiment suggest that PS outperforms PTFE for 243 viral recovery. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the RNA viral 244 recovery from PS used as a filter material in field of exposure science.\n\nThe underlying cause for the superior performance of PS relative to PTFE and PVC merits The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

For the Trizol method, a visible RNA \"pellet\" was to be 289 observed after extraction, distinguishable from impurities in the sample. However, several 290 samples did not produce a visible pellet, making it more difficult to distinguish between the viral 291 RNA and the remaining impurities in the sample. Therefore, the Trizol method may have 292 resulted in additional loss of viral RNA. Viral recovery efficiency from each filter type was not 293 measured for each sample; therefore, it is unknown whether the differences in virus recovered 294 from the filter types in each sample had an effect on viral RNA copy variability.\n\nAfter washing the filters with either HBSS or PBS, aliquots for each extraction process were The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Although the optimal 311 comfort level for humans is 40-60% RH 14 , and previous studies have found that higher RHs (i.e., 312 50-56%) have no effect on viral infectivity. 13 Relative humidity was measured using a single real 313 time measurement instrument in the chamber over the course of the experiment. We assumed the 314 experimental chamber was well mixed however, the RH may not have remained at 50% for all 315 sampling locations during the entire 30-minute sampling period.
