{"title": "Emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and nursing college students during COVID-19 outbreak", "body": "In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 on people's emotions, people's coping strategies will also change as a result. Coping is the thoughts and actions that individuals use to deal with stressful events [11] . People have identified two general coping strategies: one is a problem-focused coping, the purpose is to solve the problem or take action to change the status quo; the other is an emotion-focused coping, which aims to reduce the emotional distress associated with stressful situations [12] . Studies have found that emotions lead to specific coping strategies [13] , and vice versa. Emotions are thought to have motivational properties that motivate certain behaviors or behaviors [13, 14] . For example, fear is related to the desire to evade and protect themselves from incidents, anger leads to desire to attack, disgust leads to desire to expel, and happiness leads to desire to entertain [13, 15] .\n\nMoreover, emotions have been linked to the use of specific coping strategies [16] . In particular, adults who report more anger and fear prefer to use active-oriented coping strategies such as asking questions, while those who are sad are more likely to use non-active coping strategies such as avoiding or accepting problems [16] . In turn, the successful use of coping strategies will help individuals manage stressful events [11] and reduce negative emotions [12] . However, the direction of the relationship between emotion responses and coping strategies is not clear, and the relationship is not always constant. Some studies have found that the relationship between them is age-specific during SARS [17] . So, the relationship between nurses' coping strategies and emotional response during a major infectious disease such as COVID-19 needs further research to clarify. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on nurses' emotional responses and coping strategies.\n\nBased on this, the purpose of this study was to explore the current status and relationship of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses at all levels of hospitals in Anhui Province during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to compare them with non-front-line prospective nurses (nursing college students).\n\nA questionnaire survey was conducted on online nurses and nursing college students in Anhui Province from February 1st to 9th, 2020, using a network questionnaire. A total of 850 questionnaires were sent, and 802 valid and complete questionnaires were recovered, with a recovery rate of 94.35%. Population composition: 202 males and 602 females; 298 participants in rural and 506 participants in urban; 374 nurses and 430 nursing college students; 377 participants from cities with severe epidemics (Hefei, Fuyang, Bengbu, the number of confirmed diagnoses is> 100 ), 170 participants from cities with moderate epidemic levels (Anqing, Wuhu, Lu'an, Suzhou, Ma'anshan, with confirmed diagnosis between 30-100), 257 participants from prefecture-level cities (Xuancheng, Huaibei, Huainan, Chizhou, Quzhou and Huangshan, the number of confirmed diagnoses <30).\n\nIt mainly includes the basic information of the participants, such as gender, age, identity, rural or urban, whether there is a confirmed or isolated person in the community or administrative village (in order to evaluate the spatial distance of the COVID-19 from the participants).\n\nParticipants rated the extent that they experienced anxious, fear, sadness and anger in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in An Hui on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (no such emotion) to 5 (the most intense feeling of the emotion). The order of presentation for these items was randomized.\n\nThe tool for measuring the coping strategy during the outbreak of COVID-19 was revised based on the Brief COPE prepared by Carver (1997) [17, 18] . Yeung and Fung (2013) used it to measure residents' response strategies during the SARS outbreak which display a good reliability. The scale consists of problem-focused coping (active coping, planning, and use of instrumental support) and emotion-focused coping (use of emotional support, acceptance, positive reframing, religion, humor, substance use, self-distraction, self-blame, denial, behavior disengagement, and venting) consisting All rights reserved.

We asked participants to report how often they used the strategy described in each project to respond to COVID-19, ranging from 1 (none) to 5 (always) on 5 levels. Higher scores indicated higher levels of coping. In this study, the Cronbach's a coefficients of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping categories are 0.817 and 0.811 respectively.\n\nSPSS 21 software was used for data statistics. Independent sample t analysis, analysis of variance, correlation analysis and regression analysis were mainly used.\n\nFirst, the independent sample t-test were conducted to examine participant identity, gender, urban-rural, and The severity of the urban covid-19 outbreak in each emotional responses, and the results are summarized in Table I . It was found that nurses' anxiety (t (799.33) = 3.05, P = 0.002), fear (t (799.33) = 3.05, P = 0.002), sadness (t (799.33) = 4.59, P = 0.000), and anger (t (802) = 4.56, P = 0.002) was significantly higher than the emotional level of nursing college students. Women were significantly higher than men in terms of anxiety (t (802) =-3.62, P = 0.000) and fear (t (314.44) = 5.17, P = 0.000). The level of sadness (t (584.85) =-3.85, P = 0.000) of participants from rural was significantly higher than that of participants from urban, while the anxiety of participants from urban (t (679.52) = 2.55, P = 0.009) and anger (t (802) = 3.04, P = 0.002) were significantly higher than participants in rural.\n\nOne-way ANOVAs were conducted to examine the severity of COVID-19 in the city in each emotion, and the results are summarized in Table I .

It was found that the main effects of fear (F (2, 801) = 2.66, P = 0.073, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.007) and sadness (F (2, 801) = 1.404, P = 0.246, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.003) were not significant. A significant differences was found in anxiety (F (2, 677) = 9.26, P = 0.000, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.023), multiple comparisons found that anxiety in near space distance is significantly greater than far space distance (P = 0.000) and medium space distance (P = 0.073); the anxiety at medium space distance was significantly greater than that at far space distance (P = 0.008). The main effect of anger is aslo significant (F (2, 801) = 18.78, P = 0.000, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.045). Multiple comparisons found that the anger emotion in near space distance is significantly greater than far space distance (P = 0.000) and medium space distance (P = 0.026), the anger in medium space distance is significantly greater than in far space distance (P = 0.000).\n\nThe independent sample t test found that nurses used problem-focused coping methods significantly higher than nursing college students (t (802) = 4.99, P = 0.000).\n\nWomen were significantly higher than men in problem-focused coping (t (317) =-2.30, P = 0.022), and significantly lower than men in emotional-focused coping (t (264.75) = 4.47, P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in the coping strategies between the participants from urban and rural.\n\nOne-way ANOVAs were conducted to examine the severity of COVID-19 in coping strategies, and the results are summarized in Table I One-way ANOVAs were conducted to examine the spatial distance of COVID-19 from the subject in coping strategies, and the results are summarized in coping between near space and far space distances (P = 0.715), and the emotion-focused coping at medium space distances were significantly higher than All rights reserved.

This result is consistent with the results of a recent study by Xu and Zhang [21] , who found that 85.37% (35 patients) of the first-line nurses fighting COVID-19 had adverse emotional reactions, including 2 nurses with depression, 16 nurses with anxiety, and 21 nurses with terror. During the SARS outbreak, many nurses showed conflicting roles as medical service providers and parents. On the one hand, they felt altruistic and professionally responsible. On the other hand, they were afraid and guilty that they might infect their families [22] .\n\nNickell (2004)'s study found that about 20% of the population suffers from emotional depression during SARS, and the incidence of nurses is as high as 45% in Toronto [23] .\n\nLong-term research has generally found that women have significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness than men. This is considered to be related to gender traits. Women themselves attach more importance to their inner experiences and self-perceptions, their emotions are more fragile and sensitive, and they are more vulnerable to depression, anxiety and Loneliness [24] . Our study support this conclusion, which finds that women show more severe anxiety and fear than men.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak, Gao et al. (2003) found that more women than men call for psychological counseling, and the content of the consultation is mainly emotional issues [24] . This indicates that there are gender differences in psychological characteristics in the face of public health emergencies. This study also found that participants from urban showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. This may be that the city is densely populated and has a large flow of people, and the epidemic situation in urban is more serious. The COVID-19 is more closer to the participants urban than the rural participants. Urban participants are more concerned about whether they may be infected, so they are more anxious and fearful. On the contrary, rural participants pay more attention to the illness of others, and have sadness for patients. In addition, we found that the severity of the epidemic in the city has no difference in individual emotions, which may indicate that the individual is not very All rights reserved.

This study found that participants in the community or administrative village affected by COVID-19 (with diagnosed patients or isolators) had stronger anxiety and anger than those in the community or administrative village where were not affected by Participants in the community or administrative village with diagnosed patients reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and anger than participants in the community or administrative village with isolators. The presence of diagnosed patients in a community or administrative village means a higher probability of being infected. The geographical location of COVID-19 patients and the spatial distance of participants are a reflection of psychological distance. The closer the psychological distance is. The more people feel the danger, the more sexual and threatening, the more intense anxiety and anger. Our results and the research results during the outbreak of SARS support this conclusion, and this change is also in line with the psychological development law of people in response to stressful events [25] .\n\nCollege students often use immature or negative coping strategies instead of positive problem coping when faced with the pressure caused by public health emergencies [26] . As a medical worker with clinical work experience, the nurse has more knowledge and strategies to face similar pressures. This is consistent with our research, which found that nurses are more proactive in using problem-focused coping than nursing college students. This study also found that women are more likely to use problem-focused coping than men, and less likely to use emotional-focused coping. As mentioned earlier, women are more vulnerable and sensitive on emotional issues, so emotional-focused coping is rarely used when dealing with stress. In addition, this study also found that participants in the communities or administrative villages with isolators were more likely to using emotional-focused coping than those in the communities or administrative villages where was not affected or with diagnosed patients. This may be because when the communities or administrative All rights reserved.

When diagnosed patient (that is, the spatial distance is particularly close) appears in the community or administrative village, participants may not use sufficient emotional-focused coping due to the psychological typhoon eye effect [27] .\n\nIn subsequent analysis, it was found that anxiety, fear, and anger were significantly positively related to problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. That is to say, there may be \"the more coping the more panic\" or \"the more panic the more coping\" or the \"coping-panic cycle\" The phenomenon. An analysis of the direction of the relationship between emotion and coping found that problem-focused coping has a significant predictive effect on anxiety and sadness. The explanatory power of anxiety is 3.4%, and the explanatory power of sadness is 0.9%, which indicating that the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious and sadness. Although both problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping have significant predictive effects on fear, the total explanatory power is 6%, but the explanatory power of problem-focused coping is 5.6%, and the explanatory power of emotion-focused coping is only 0.4%. Therefore, the more problem-focused coping, the more fear.\n\nProblem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping both have a significant predictive effect on anger, with a total explanatory power of 2.6% and a problem-focused coping interpretation of 2.2%, but the explanatory power of emotion-focused coping is only 0.4%. This shows that problem-focused coping can predict emotional responses to a certain extent. This shows that there may be a phenomenon that \"the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry , the more sadness\".\n\nSubsequently, our conducted a regression analysis on coping strategies, which found that fear and anger have a predictive effect on Problem-focused coping. The total explanatory power is 6%, the explanatory power of fear is 5.5%, and the explanatory power of anger is only 0.5%. Anger has a predictive effect on Emotion-focused coping, with an explanatory power of 2.2%. It can be seen that people may be the All rights reserved.

Anxiety and sadness have no predictive effect on coping strategies. Combining the two parts of the regression analysis, it can be speculated that there may be a cycle of \"the more fear-the more problem-focused coping\" (forward interpretation power is 5.6%, reverse interpretation power is 5.5%), \"the more angry, the more emotion-focused coping (2.2%) \",\" The more problem-focused coping, the more anxious (3.4%), the more angry (2.2%), the more sadness (0.9%) \".\n\nDuring the outbreak of COVID-19, gender, urban/rural, and spatial distance will affect the anxiety, fear, sadness and anger and coping strategies of nurse and nursing college students. There is also a large emotional difference between nurses and nursing college students. Nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to adopt Problem-focused coping. This study further reveals the direction of the relationship between emotional responses and coping strategies. In the outbreak of COVID-19, we suggest that hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses, providing timely psychological assistance, training in coping strategies, providing adequate medical protective equipment, and taking a variety of interventions to block the spread of infectious diseases to form a medical environment where COVID-19 stops spreading in hospitals. It has created an optimistic environment and guarantees for personal safety for nurses, thereby enabling nurses to carry out ambulance work with high quality, and to provide a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee.
