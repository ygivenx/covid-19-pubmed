{"title": "Assessing hospital emergency management plans: A guide for infection preventionists", "body": "Hospital emergency management plans (hereafter termed the ''Plan'') are an essential component of hospital preparedness for mass casualty events (MCE) and need to address all hazards, including biologic threats such as bioterrorism, emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and pandemics. Plan development and assessment is a multidisciplinary and multidepartmental endeavor that must include the input from an infection preventionist (IP). 1 For most hospitals, the Plan consists of multiple components: the main body of the plan that addresses emergency management tasks/needs that are applicable to all MCEs and a series of appendices or annexes that address specific incidents such as chemical, nuclear, or biologic events. Examples of allhazards components of the Plan include addressing liability issues for health care personnel, providing mental health support for disaster victims and hospital staff, and establishing funding to cover uncompensated costs during an MCE. Although these issues are very important to emergency management and may have an indirect impact on infection transmission during an MCE, ensuring these topics are addressed in a Plan will not fall within the scope of an IP's responsibility at most hospitals. Most IPs will act as a consultant to the hospital emergency management planning committee and will be responsible for assessing the Plan in regards to preventing infection transmission during MCEs. 1 IP involvement will be most important in developing and assessing the Plan's biologic annex.\n\nMany MCE planning guides are available from national organizations, governmental agencies, and academic institutions. However, these documents either address noninfection prevention MCE planning issues or they provide specific recommendations based on a singular disease, such as smallpox, 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 3 or pandemic influenza. 4 In 2002, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) Bioterrorism Working Group created guidelines for IPs to prepare for a biologic event, but that document only addresses bioterrorism and does not include more recent recommendations relevant to SARS or pandemic influenza that must be included in hospital emergency management plans. 5 An all-encompassing planning guide is needed for IPs that addresses all types of biologic incidents, including bioterrorism, emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and pandemics. 1 The purpose of this article is to compile infection prevention recommendations from various planning agencies and researchers into a single planning guide. This should ease IP's process of assessing hospital emergency management plans for infection prevention issues.\n\nThis article addresses only hospital emergency management plan development topics that have infection transmission implications. Plans need to have an appendix or annex that addresses biologic threats. In addition, there are infection prevention issues that must be addressed by the main component of the Plan, such as having infection prevention policies and procedures in place during any type of MCE. This article addresses all components of the Plan of interest to IPs: the biologic annex as well as the infection prevention issues that would be included in the main component of the Plan. IPs should use this article as a resource to assist in developing or assessing a hospital emergency management plan for infection prevention issues. There is no perfect Plan; the best plans are constantly under review and revision. Therefore, this article cannot provide information on best practices related to all aspects of infection prevention during emergency management. In addition, procedures that work in one hospital or region may not be applicable to all facilities. IPs should use this article to identify gaps in their hospital emergency management plan. Guidance on how to implement specific interventions, such as developing a policy on work quarantine or how to allocate limited amounts of respiratory protection, are provided in other documents. 6, 7 METHODS A literature review was conducted in December 2008 using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Healthstar, Psych Info, and Medline databases for years 1966 through 2008. The following terms were utilized as key word searches: infection control, infection prevention, hospital, readiness, disaster plan, mass casualties, bioterrorism, pandemic, and emergency management. Only English language articles in peer-reviewed journals were utilized. An Internet search was also conducted in December 2008 using the same search terms as above to identify existing book chapters, reports from response agencies, published standards and guidelines, and other relevant materials related to the development of hospital emergency management plans to address biologic MCEs that were outside the peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion criteria included articles, planning documents, and published reports that addressed infection prevention issues that need to be included in a Plan. Articles that address community, public health, or personal preparedness were excluded. Also excluded were articles that only addressed noninfection prevention emergency management issues, such as developing policies and procedures for incorporating National Incident Management System (NIMS) terminology into the hospital emergency management plan. US-and non-US-based articles and documents/ reports were included in the analysis.\n\nSeven hundred sixty-four journal articles were identified and reviewed for relevance; many were eliminated based on the title or journal (non-peer reviewed or did not meet inclusion criteria) alone. Two hundred seventy-two references were screened by reading the abstract. Data from the relevant sources identified through the literature review and Internet search were extracted. A spreadsheet was created that delineated Plan components of interest to IPs identified by each source. The primary author conducted the article review, data extraction, data analysis, and determination of domains.\n\nOf the articles and planning documents/reports screened, 49 references were deemed relevant: 35 were journals articles, and 14 were published reports, regulatory standards, and/or planning documents. There was a lot of overlap between sources when summarizing the infection prevention issues that should be addressed by a hospital emergency management plan. Common infection prevention issues mentioned included having policies and procedures related to infection prevention, conducting syndromic surveillance, having infection prevention coverage, and preparing for a surge in potentially contagious patients. Differences identified by the sources tended to be agent-specific interventions, such as developing a SARS response team, 8 identifying hospitals/health care facilities (types C, X, or R) based on whether or not smallpox patients are housed at the facility, 2 or tracking nosocomial transmission of influenza as part of pandemic influenza preparedness. 4 No single document or article identified all of the infection prevention issues that should be addressed by a Plan.\n\nA full list of the infection prevention issues that should be included in a Plan are divided into themes or domains and are outlined in Table 1 and provided online at www.ajicjournal.org. IPs can use this Table as an assessment tool for evaluating their Plans and developing policies and procedures that will decrease the risk of infection transmission during an MCE. It is important to note that information provided in this article consists of compiled published recommendations that are not considered mandates or regulations except for the Joint Commission standards for accredited US hospitals. 9\n\nHospital emergency management plans need to have an appendix or annex that addresses all biologic threats, including bioterrorism, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and pandemics. This plan must be updated regularly based on lessons learned from disaster exercises, actual events, or published evidence of best practices. The Plan needs to be coordinated with local, state, and federal plans, and contact names and information for key response agencies need to be included. The Plan biologic annex needs to define how biologic events are different from other types of MCEs, how interventions will be stratified by pandemic stage/phase or nature of the biologic attack, and the epidemiologic clues of a potential biologic event.\n\nDomain 2: Assessing hospital readiness for mass casualty event Hospitals must assess their readiness for MCEs, including biologic events. The Plan should state how and when a facility assessment, such as a hazard vulnerability assessment, will be performed. The hazard vulnerability assessment should include aspects of hospital readiness that relate to infection prevention, such as the location and amounts of hand hygiene stations or products, isolation rooms/areas, and others. Disaster exercises that utilize a biologic scenario should be performed by the hospital to assess for biologic MCE readiness. Whenever possible, communitywide exercises should be performed to ensure regional coordination for MCEs.\n\nThe Plan needs to outline infection prevention policies and procedures to be implemented during an MCE. These policies and procedures should encompass all aspects of patient care, environmental decontamination, visitor restriction, occupational health practices, and physical plant issues that could contribute to infection spread. There are a number of infection prevention policies and procedures that are needed to prevent infection transmission during patient care. Examples include procedures for when and how to perform patient decontamination, internal and external patient transport, patient placement, isolation, linen management, patient discharge, and postmortem care. Hospitals also need to have around-the-clock infection prevention coverage during a biologic MCE. If the hospital oversees outpatient services or alternate care sites, these facilities and staff will require infection prevention coverage as well. Procedures for conducting and coordinating an epidemiologic investigation with local health officials should be included in the Plan.\n\nIn addition to outlining routine infection prevention policies/procedures, the Plan also needs to address crisis standards of care. Crisis standards of care are needed for times when routine standards cannot be met because of limited or depleted resources. Crisis standards of care that are specific to infection prevention issues include prioritization plans for allocating insufficient or depleted supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene products, anti-infective therapy or vaccine, and other equipment that may contribute to disease spread during an MCE. Whenever possible, hospital or community ethics committees should be involved in the development of crisis standards of care.\n\nThe risk of occupational exposure to infectious diseases/agents increases during a biologic MCE. Therefore, it is essential that infection prevention occupational health issues be addressed in the Plan. Examples include having a respiratory protection program, having a nonpunitive sick leave policy that does not encourage staff to work while ill during a biologic event, having procedures for monitoring and managing personnel who experience occupational exposures, and defining protocols for times when PPE or other resources are limited. Hospital emergency management plans should also outline the hospital immunization policy, including how staff compliance will be monitored for annual influenza vaccination. Staff at high risk from infection (ie, pregnant or immunocompromised individuals) or those who are involved in high-risk procedures (such as aerosolizing procedures during a biologic MCE) should be identified. Protocols should be developed that outline how high-risk staff will be managed during a biologic MCE, such as reassignment or furlough.\n\nSurveillance will be a critical component of emergency management, especially for biologic MCEs. The Plan should outline the hospital's protocols for implementing, coordinating, and evaluating a syndromic surveillance program to identify or detect a bioterrorism attack, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and pandemics. Protocols should be included for implementing a surveillance program that identifies staff, volunteers, visitors, and patients with potentially contagious diseases; different indicators and/or frequency of reporting may be needed for pre-and postevent time periods. The Plan should also outline procedures for tracking admission and discharge of known or suspected contagious patients; monitoring staff absenteeism related to potentially communicable diseases/conditions; calculating the rate of seasonal influenza-like illness among staff, volunteers, and patients; and monitoring health careassociated infection transmission.\n\nThe hospital emergency management plan biologic annex needs to outline procedures for reporting known or suspected biologic MCEs to internal and external departments, facilities, and response agencies. The names and contact information of the persons responsible for internal and external communication during a biologic MCE also need to be identified. This includes internal communication with hospital staff and volunteers regarding activation of the Plan and external communication with public health authorities, community health care facilities, and response agencies. Protocols for monitoring state and federal public health advisories; health alert network communications; and sharing estimates of hospital patient care equipment and PPE with local, regional, state, and tribal planning groups need to be outlined. It is also critical that IPs identify or create pre-event messages about the most likely biologic agents to be involved in an MCE; these materials can be provided or communicated to staff, visitors, patients, and the general public during a biologic MCE. 7 When developing pre-and postevent messages and educational materials, it is important that hospitals use language that is appropriate for individuals with visual, learning, or other disabilities and those who are non-English language speakers.\n\nHospital emergency management plans need to address laboratory infection prevention issues. Examples include having processes to obtain laboratory services around the clock and on weekends; having protocols for collecting, labeling, packaging, processing, and internal and external transport of laboratory specimens believed to be potential bioterrorism agents or emerging infectious diseases; having the ability to track and stratify all patient specimens and results; and having collection and management procedures for potential evidence during a bioterrorism attack. Laboratory services should be coordinated within the framework of the Laboratory Response Network using local, state, and federal government laboratory protocols.\n\nThe hospital emergency management plan biologic annex must include protocols for handling an influx of potentially contagious patients. One aspect of surge capacity is assessing on-hand resources and calculating how much might be needed during an MCE. For biologic MCEs, this could include the need for equipment and supplies that would last up to 8 weeks (the estimated wave of a pandemic). These estimates should also take into account that other health care facilities will be placing strains on the supply system during this period and may not be able to meet normal supply needs. Examples of resources that need to be assessed include intravenous pumps, ventilators, anti-infective therapy, vaccination, diagnostic testing materials, linens, respiratory protection, gowns, gloves, eye protection, hand hygiene products, laboratory supplies, isolation rooms/areas, and morgue beds. The need for extra hospital personnel will likely be greater during a biologic MCE compared with other disasters because staff may be less willing or able to work during a biologic event. 10, 11 Some factors that may influence health care workers' willingness and ability to work during a biologic MCE include personal illness or quarantine, family obligations, and fear of exposure or illness. 10, 11 In addition, worker fatigue may be greater during a biologic MCE because of wearing PPE for extended periods of time or because of psychologic stress. The Plan should include protocols for stockpiling or obtaining additional staff, medical and laboratory equipment/supplies, isolation rooms/areas, and morgue beds.\n\nMedications will be needed for all types of MCEs, but biologic events will require a disproportionate need for anti-infective therapy and vaccines. The Plan should outline on-hand resources and calculations regarding how much will be needed during a biologic event. Protocols should address the establishment and/or maintenance of a medication and vaccine stockpile that is coordinated with regional health care facilities and/or response agencies. The Plan should also define a prioritization plan for staff and their family members regarding who would be the first priority for antiinfective therapy, chemoprophylaxis, and vaccine during times of limited resources. A procedure is needed for identifying the most current recommendations and guidance on the use of anti-infective therapy and chemoprophylaxis needed for a biologic event because these guidelines become outdated quickly. 4 The hospital emergency management Plan biologic annex should outline procedures for administering anti-infective therapy; chemoprophylaxis; or vaccine to staff, patients, visitors, and/or the general public and protocols for follow-up monitoring as needed.\n\nThe Plan should designate a person whose responsibility it is to create, coordinate, and track staff training on emergency management and biologic threats. In addition, the Plan should outline the types of infection prevention training/information that will be provided to patients, visitors, and the general public. Lists of groups requiring infection prevention education related to emergency management have been outlined in the literature. 1, 12 Suggested topics for staff education related to infection prevention during MCEs are outlined in Table 2 . Staff education should be based on identified competencies whenever possible and should be in language and formats that are appropriate for clinical and nonclinical personnel. 13\n\nMost physical plant issues will be planned for and managed by the hospital facilities engineering department. However, some aspects of the physical plant can contribute to infection spread during an MCE and need to have IP input. The Plan should include protocols for safe food and water handling practices, such as monitoring holding temperatures and times to prevent foodborne illness during events when standard utilities may not be available and having sufficient water for drinking, sanitation, and hand hygiene needs. Other needed protocols include procedures for assessing for water, dust, or other contaminate infiltration; ensuring sewer/sanitation system functioning; obtaining sufficient functional or chemical toilets; and handling/managing an increase in regular and regulated medical waste during MCEs, including times when regular waste management pick-up is not possible because of the event.\n\nIPs need to be involved in developing and assessing hospital emergency management plans as they relate to infection transmission during mass casualty events. This article provides IPs guidance on aspects of hospital emergency management plans that have implications for infection spread in hospitals. IPs should use this tool to assess their Plan and develop policies and procedures for emergency management that will decrease the risk of infection transmission. This assessment tool is designed to be used with hospital allhazards emergency management plans, with a special focus on the infection prevention issues that might occur during mass casualty events. Most notably, this article combines information from a variety of national organizations and published articles into 1 tool that can be used to address all types of mass casualty events, including bioterrorism, emerging infectious disease outbreaks, and pandemics.\n\nThe assessment tool outlined in this article provides a starting point for IPs to get involved in hospital emergency management. A full detailing of emergency management best practices, such as describing occupational health respiratory programs, is out of the scope of this article. In addition, many research questions related to infection prevention during emergency management remain unanswered. For example, most national organizations recommend stockpiling of anti-infective therapy, vaccines, and personal protective equipment, but guidelines for how much of a stockpile are needed have not been developed. Researchers agree that surge capacity is needed for all types of mass casualty events, but the exact amount/ number of surge beds that need to be available for any given facility has not been outlined. 11, 16, 18 The number of airborne infection isolation rooms or negative-pressure surge capacity needed by a hospital and the most effective indicators for syndromic surveillance have also not yet been determined. Most researchers state that biologic scenarios should be used in hospital disaster exercises to evaluate hospital preparedness, and the Joint Commission requires hosting disaster exercises at least twice a year, 9 but the frequency with which biologic scenarios must be used in these drills has not been established. Indicators for hospital emergency management preparedness vary by the researcher 8, 10, 14, 15 and by the organization. 3, 5, 11, 16, 17 Until some of these research questions are answered, IPs and their hospital emergency management planning committees are left on their own to determine what is best for their facility given their resources and limitations. IPs should continue to monitor information from national organizations and regulatory agencies regarding recommended practices related to emergency management.
