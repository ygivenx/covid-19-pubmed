{"title": "", "body": "Dear ISAR members, On behalf of our officers and board members, I'm pleased to welcome everyone to La Jolla and the 29 th International Conference on Antiviral Research. I wish you a highly successful meeting, and I hope that when it's over, you'll walk away impressed with the quality of the scientific presentations and with some new additions to your research network.\n\nAs we gather in La Jolla, we're deeply saddened by the loss of Chris McGuigan, a friend and colleague for many years. Chris was a pillar of the antiviral research community, a long-time member and past president of ISAR. For me and many others, he was also a mentor, colleague and good friend. His many accomplishments will be honored at the 29 th ICAR, and we will feel his presence in spirit. His work will live on with the advances he pioneered and the many students and scientists he mentored, many of whom are active members of the Society. On behalf of ISAR, we send our condolences to the McGuigan family and to his many friends and colleagues on this tragic loss.\n\nAs Chris would wish, we will again have a cuttingedge program in La Jolla, offering great science and the all-important time to network and reconnect with friends from around the world. Mark Prichard and his program team have worked hard to attract top speakers, and they've also revamped the abstract submission process and developed a new workshop on Diagnostic Technologies. The meeting will begin with a tribute to Chris and his contributions to science and to our society, followed by two keynote addresses. The first, by Richard H. Scheuermann of the J. Craig Venter Institute, will explore how the availability of whole-genome sequence data, combined with standard representations of phenotypic characteristics from large numbers of viral isolates, is allowing extensive genotype-phenotype association studies that go well beyond traditional phylogenetic lineage tracing. He will illustrate these concepts by focusing on two areas: the use of statistical genomic analysis to predict influenza virus evolution in the face of adaptive immunity and the identification of novel genetic determinants of disease severity in enterovirus D68.\n\nThe second keynote address, by Heinz Feldmann of the NIAID Rocky Mountain Laboratory, will take a very different direction, focusing on the past, present and future of Ebola virus. Heinz did his initial training and research in Marburg, Germany, which was the site of the first filovirus outbreak. He will review the history of Marburg and Ebola viruses from their discovery through the recent West African epidemic. He will then provide a look ahead: what research is needed, where do we go from here? Lessons learned in West Africa are clearly critical to understanding how to prevent such a widespread epidemic in the future and to limit its global spread through air travel.\n\nWe can also look forward to award lectures from two distinguished senior scientists and a promising younger investigator. Doug Richman from UC San Diego will receive the Gertrude Elion Award; Robert Vince of the University of Minnesota will receive the Antonin Hol\u00fd Award; and Jerome Deval of Alios Biopharma will receive the Prusoff Young Investigator Award. Their presentations, reviewing some of their past accomplishments and focusing on priorities for future research, will be high points of the meeting.\n\nThe 29 th ICAR will also feature three symposia, the first of which will cover a variety of topics in structural biology, which has become so important for progress in antiviral research. Speakers from the San Diego/La Jolla area will include Clodagh O'Shea from the Salk Institute and 2015 Prusoff Award winner Erica Ollman Saphire from the Scripps Research Institute.\n\nThe second symposium will examine important aspects of Zika virus, which has been spreading rapidly in Central and South America and causing alarm because of its association with fetal anomalies and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Pei-Yong Shi will lead off with an overview of Zika and its relationship to other flaviviruses, and Justin Julander and Johan Neyts will follow with discussions of animal models, antivirals and vaccine development.\n\nThe third symposium will focus on DNA viruses. Effective antiviral therapies have been developed for some DNA viruses, but unexpected genetic variation, including the discovery of quasispecies within a host, has highlighted the need for new antivirals and combination therapies. Among the speakers and topics will be Thomas Lion on monitoring adenovirus infections, Paul Lambert on new approaches to papillomavirus diseases and David Bernstein on the current status of vaccines against Herpes simplex virus.\n\nIn addition to these excellent symposia, a diagnostic technologies workshop on Tuesday afternoon will showcase new, rapid methods to identify viral infections and ensure that patients benefit from effective antiviral therapy.\n\nImportantly, such new technologies can potentially maximize the power of clinical trials, by identifying patient populations that are infected with the virus of interest, but are free from other common infections that could mask a clinical response. The workshop will also highlight new techniques that can help drive the drug discovery process.\n\nThis will be my final message as ISAR President. Two years have flown by, and as I now turn over the Presidency to Jos\u00e9 Est\u00e9 and the role of President-Elect to Johan Neyts, I'm confident that ISAR is in good hands and our future is bright. During my term as President, I've focused on increasing our membership through the new Ambassador Program, and have explored ways to involve young investigators in the Society and ICAR. In future, I hope to continue to address these goals, which are essential for our continuing success.\n\nI wish everyone a highly successful and enjoyable 29 th ICAR, and look forward to meeting everyone during the conference. Chris was an exceptionally bright medicinal chemist, with a very broad background and insights into widely different fields of human health research. He was best known for inventing a wide variety of phosphoramidate ProTides, which optimize intracellular drug delivery and circumvent metabolic bottlenecks in the activation of nucleoside-based antivirals and anticancer drugs. At least four compounds based on this technology have entered clinical trials, including Acelarin, now in Phase III evaluation for ovarian cancer and NUC3373, which is in Phase I trials for breast and colon cancer. This work inspired the research leading to the prodrugs tenofovir alafenamide and sofosbuvir, the \"backbone\" drugs in the single-tablet regimens which have transformed therapies for HIV and HCV infection.\n\nChris was also the co-inventor of a highly potent and selective anti-VZV drug and of its phosphoramidate prodrug, which originated from a long and close collaboration with our group at the Rega Institute of the KU Leuven. The prodrug is currently in Phase III clinical trials. He also developed INX-189 for the treatment of hepatitis C, which reached Phase II trials, but was not pursued due to unexpected side-effects when trialed in conjunction with another drug. He also co-invented new glucosamine phosphates with potential use in osteoarthritis. In addition to his own achievements, Chris was an outstanding manager of a team of scientists from all over the world. He was quite demanding and extremely \"punctual,\" but a master at motivating his team members. At his annual Laboratory Away Day, when Ph.D. candidates and postdocs presented their results and future plans, he always invited a foreign expert to judge the results, and it was amazing to see how the students and collaborators were inspired by his drive and enthusiasm. He also possessed the art of teaching in a very entertaining manner, and could explain scientific results and their potential implications to an audience of scientists and non-scientists like no one else. Over his career, he trained more than 100 researchers, including more than 45 Ph.D. students.\n\nChris was an exceptionally warm, charming and generous person, with profound social and entertaining abilities. He was often the center of attention at meetings, and always had fun stories to tell. Collaborations with Chris often led to close friendships. It was an enormous privilege for our group in Leuven to collaborate with him for many years.\n\nChris died much too young. He still had many ideas to work out, and so many responsibilities that directly impacted the advancement of science and human health. We owe him our deep gratitude and respect for his achievements and the unforgettable interactions we had on so many occasions. We will miss him.\n\n--Jan Balzarini, Maria-Jos\u00e9 Camarasa, Anna Karlsson and Carlo-Federico Perno, and on behalf of their research teams.\n\nWe are delighted to welcome our colleagues to the 29 th ICAR in La Jolla. It's a pleasure and an honor to share our hometown with lead investigators contributing to exciting and dynamic progress in our field. From the remarkable list of past accomplishments in HIV and HCV, to new scientific developments with herpesviruses, respiratory viruses and emerging global threats such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and Ebola viruses, antiviral research has come a long way since the first ICAR, and promises to make critically important contributions over the next few years.\n\nWe are confident that the venue will match the excellent program and list of participants for this meeting. The La Jolla Mesa co-locates many major institutions, including the University of California San Diego, the Scripps Research Institute, the Salk Institute, the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, the La Jolla Institute, and the J. Craig Venter Institute, as well as a large number of pharma and biotech companies, which participate in this exciting progress. The meeting venue, located centrally on the Mesa, is in a beautiful setting.\n\nWe look forward to interacting with all of you, and hope you have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience at the 29 th ICAR in La Jolla.\n\nThe 29 th ICAR site is located on the Torrey Pines Mesa, home to the University of California, San Diego, the Scripps Research Institute, the Salk Institute, the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute and the J. Craig Venter Institute. The JCVI is a recent addition to our area in a beautiful new building overlooking the Pacific. We are fortunate to have Richard Scheuermann, Director of Informatics at the JCVI, as one of our leadoff speakers. The area is also home to many of the 40+ publically traded biotech companies and innumerable startups.\n\nThe conference hotel is the Hilton La Jolla / Torrey Pines located in one of the most exceptional settings in Southern California. Atop the bluffs of La Jolla and overlooking the legendary Torrey Pines Golf Course, site of the 2008 US Open and San Diego's annual PGA Tour event. With nearly 60,000 square feet of event and meeting space, the hotel provides a setting to inspire, reward and entertain attendees. Unique in San Diego, each of the 394 guestrooms has a private balcony or patio with ocean, gardens or golf course views.\n\nAmenities include access to exclusive guaranteed daily tee times at the highly coveted Torrey Pines Golf Course, guest privileges at the Spa at Torrey Pines and award-winning dining at Torreyana Grille.

With the emergence of HIV in the early 1980s, his laboratory performed pioneering studies of the pathogenesis of AIDS and assessment of the first antiretrovirals [1, 2] . His group was the first to identify HIV drug resistance [3, 4] , and later documented the impact of resistance on treatment failure, the presence of mixtures of different viral phenotypes and genotypes in the same patient and the pre-existence of drugresistant mutants in untreated patients. These studies helped to establish the importance of drug resistance assays in the day-to-day management of HIV infection.\n\nDoug's team at UCSD also joined with others in identifying latently infected CD4 cells as the obstacle to eradication of HIV infection through antiretroviral therapy [5, 6] . Major areas of investigation have included the development of assays to measure the viral reservoir in various body compartments, characterization of various subsets of CD4 lymphocytes as targets of intervention strategies and efforts to reliably measure the impact of such interventions. His research has also focused on virological and host determinants of HIV transmission and their implications for the development of an effective vaccine.\n\nNow that we've developed antivirals to suppress the virus and its consequent transmission, the major issues for antiretroviral therapy are resources and delivery of treatment to all HIV-infected individuals. There are two critical challenges for HIV research: to develop a vaccine for people not yet infected, and for those already infected, we need to find a cure. This is a new opportunity for drug discovery.\n\nThere have been two \"most exciting\" periods. The first was being involved in the clinical development of the first antiretroviral drug (AZT) and identifying the development of drug-resistant mutants, which has turned into a major aspect of both drug development and clinical management. The second was documenting that the latent reservoir was the obstacle to a cure. This has grown into a major objective of current research.\n\nI of course enjoy meeting old friends (some of them are actually getting old) and meeting new ones who are doing interesting things. What is remarkable is that when I first went to an ICAR, our only drugs were amantadine and vidarabine. Now we have more than 50 antivirals and have treated millions infected with HIV and HBV and will cure millions with HCV. He obtained a bachelor's degree in pharmacy at SUNY Buffalo in 1962, then stayed on to join the research group of Howard Schaeffer, receiving his Ph.D in medicinal chemistry for studies of the synthesis and biochemical activity of acyclic nucleoside analogues [1] . Their investigation of acycloadenosine was an early step on the road to the discovery of acyclovir.\n\nSchaeffer then moved to Burroughs Wellcome and began working with Gertrude Elion, while Bob joined the medicinal chemistry faculty at the University of Minnesota. His major focus was the characterization of carbocyclic nucleoside analogues, which appeared to have promising anticancer and antiviral activity [2] . By the early 1980s, he had demonstrated that carbocyclic arabinofuranosyladenine (cyclaradine) was active against herpesvirus infection in guinea pigs [3] . However, the emergence of HIV revealed the true importance of these compounds, as some carbocyclic dideoxynucleoside analogues were found to inhibit reverse transcriptase.\n\nThe initial series of compounds, dubbed \"carbovirs\" were 6-substituted derivatives of the parent compound, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydroguanosine. The molecule with a cyclopropyl group on the 6-amino nitrogen of the adenine ring, which became known as abacavir (below) was selected for commercial development [4] .\n\nAbacavir proved to be rapidly absorbed from the GI tract, and had good CNS penetration. Although Glaxo licensed the carbovirs in 1988, abacavir did not reach the market until 1998, when it was released as \u00aeZiagen.\n\nThe commercial production of abacavir and related molecules was markedly facilitated by Bob's development of the bicyclic molecule \u03b3-lactam 2-azabicyclo [2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This compound, now known in the world of medicinal chemistry as \"Vince lactam,\" is a convenient starting point for the synthesis of a variety of carbocyclic nucleosides [5] , and also provides a scaffold for other therapeutic molecules, such as glycosidase inhibitors.\n\nThe royalties from abacavir enabled the University of Minnesota to establish the Center for Drug Design, which Bob has directed since 2002. Among his many honors, he was inducted into the Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame by the American Chemical Society in 2007 and was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science degree by his alma mater, SUNY-Buffalo, in 2010. The International Society for Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids selected him for the 2010 Imbach Townsend Award.\n\nThe most important challenges are identifying new targets for drug design. Back in the early 70s, the general thinking was that nucleoside analogs were not good candidates for antiviral agents because they would have to act like anticancer agents and would be too toxic to by useful. We know today that that is not true.\n\nThe most exciting part of my career has been director of the Center for Drug Design. The availability of royalty funds from the development of Ziagen has allowed me to initiate new research projects in areas unrelated to those previously funded by my research grants. Thus, in addition to our antiviral and anticancer projects we've established programs in areas such as detection of early Alzheimer's disease, protection of DNA damage and stimulation of DNA repair agents, interferon stimulation, anti-aging, wound healing, etc.\n\nJust spending time in the lab each day with my research group and discussing the results and details of ongoing projects. One of their lead candidates, the novel nucleoside analogue ALS-8176 [1, 2] , entered Phase I trials in early 2013, and is now being evaluated in RSV-infected adults and hospitalized infants. The HCV polymerase inhibitor ALS-2200/VX-135 reached Phase II clinical trials, while their newest anti-HCV nucleotide analog, AL-335, is currently being tested in Phase II combination therapy. Jerome is also a member of the team that discovered a novel class of influenza polymerase inhibitors; one of them, AL-794, is being tested for safety and efficacy in an influenza challenge study.\n\nJerome One of Jerome's main responsibilities at Alios is to develop in vitro methods to identify novel nucleoside analogues aimed against a large spectrum of RNA viruses [3] [4] [5] . Alios became an affiliate of Janssen, the pharmaceutical division of Johnson & Johnson, in 2014, and he became Scientific Director in January, 2015.\n\nWhat are some of the most important challenges for antiviral researchers?\n\nI believe transitioning the focus from chronic to acute viral infections represents an important change, and a tough challenge, in the way we need to think about drug discovery and drug development. There are now a number of ongoing clinical studies, with first-inclass drug candidates, that will soon inform us on the potential to effectively treat acute viral infections in hospital and outpatient settings.\n\nI consider myself a bench scientist, so I really enjoy finding the time to be in the lab to conduct experiments. For example, I still get excited by a SDS PAGE when a novel protein construct is being expressed and purified for the first time. I also love the experience of testing newly synthesized molecules in the first biological assay. Being in a work environment that brings together biologists and chemists, where scientific discoveries translate to new drug candidates with the potential to save lives, is incredibly satisfying. This is also why I really enjoy working on viruses against which no effective therapies are yet available.\n\nWhat new laboratory methods hold the most promise for antiviral drug development?\n\nA lot of the projects in which I am currently involved are limited by the ability to produce large amounts of functional protein target(s). Recent progress in rapid screening and optimization of protein production conditions using modern molecular biology and biochemistry methods has really opened new avenues for drug discovery. This is particularly true for large protein complexes such as influenza and RSV polymerases. Combined with recent breakthroughs in crystallography, these advances in protein biochemistry will further enable structure-based drug design as a method of choice for antiviral research.\n\nHow has ISAR contributed to your career?\n\nMy first ICAR was in 2002 in Prague. Over the years, I have developed friendships with many other ISAR members, some of whom have become collaborators or colleagues. The conference always gives me the opportunity to keep up with academic and industry research that is directly relevant to my work. \n\nThe 4 th Annual Women in Science Roundtable, the first event on the first day of ICAR, will be held on Sunday, April 17, from 11:30-2:00 PM. It is open to both women and men, and will feature discussions on the challenges and opportunities encountered by women scientists while navigating the twists and turns of career progression in today's environment.\n\nKara Carter leads a discussion with roundtable attendees at her table at the 29 th ICAR in Rome.\n\nPlease join us to network with fellow scientists in industry, government, and academia, who conduct all aspects of antiviral research. This roundtable will use a lively 'speed mentoring' approach, in which moderators will move from table to table to facilitate small group conversations on the following topics: The event is free, but it's limited to 80 participants, so register now! Select \"Women in Science Roundtable\" in the Events section when you register for ICAR. Lunch will be provided.\n\nThanks to a generous donation from the Chu family, seven young women with the potential to make significant contributions to the field of antiviral research will receive Chu Family Foundation (CFF) Scholarships in 2016. This year, there were 19 applicants from all over the world: Northern Ireland, Finland, Greece, Italy, Argentina, Hong Kong, Spain, Australia, and the United States. All were highly competitive. Five were chosen to receive $1500 scholarships, and two received $750 honorable-mention awards.\n\nThe scholarship funds may be used to attend a conference, visit a laboratory, take a course or acquire specialized training. The awards also include a 2-year membership in ISAR and a commemorative certificate. To be eligible, an applicant must be working in an area of antiviral research and be an undergraduate or grad student, or have no more than five years of cumulative postdoctoral experience. The CFF and WIS Committees will present the awards at ICAR.\n\nThe Mentoring Program was launched at the 2014 ICAR in Raleigh, NC, when Roundtable participants were asked if they would like to to be mentored or serve as mentors. Mentees and mentors were matched after filling out a questionnaire on their current interests, career goals, and what each of them wanted to achieve.\n\nAfter its start in Raleigh, the program grew significantly at the 28 th ICAR in Rome, when women registrants were asked to fill out the questionnaire before the meeting. The WIS Committee then matched prospective mentors and mentees so that they could have their first face-to-face meeting in Rome. It was a huge success, as many new female ISAR members participated in the program. There was definitely a buzz in the air as mentors and mentees met for the first time! After two years, 14 mentors have been matched with 25 mentees. The mentors are from the USA, Belgium, and Brazil, while the mentees are located around the world, including Germany, Nigeria, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Bosnia and Herzegovina, The Netherlands, Canada, Luxembourg, France, South Korea, India, and the USA.\n\nFollowing their first face-to-face meeting, mentors and mentees have contact either by email, phone, or skype. Mentors provide career advice and scientific expertise in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Significantly, the program has brought together women scientists from all aspects of antiviral research and at different stages of career development, and many new relationships have been forged.\n\nThis year, we hope to increase the numbers of mentors and mentees even more! If you've attended previous Roundtables, please consider joining the mentoring program, and if you've been a mentee, maybe it's time for you to become a mentor! We especially need mentors from Europe, in the same time zone as some of the mentees. If you're interested in joining this program, be sure to attend the WIS Roundtable, where there will be a designated meeting place for mentors and mentees. Look for the \"WIS Mentoring Program\" sign! More information will be provided for additional meeting times at the meeting.\n\nFirst, let's have a huge round of applause for Amy Patick, Chair of the WIS Committee and former ISAR President, for her ideas and limitless energy to create the exciting WIS Program that has brought so many opportunities to ISAR women scientists. Her creativity and passion have left a positive impact on ISAR, as seen by the success of the WIS Roundtable, WIS and CFF Scholarships, and Mentoring program. Amy will soon pass the torch, but not before she has one last hurrah in La Jolla! She will remain an active member of the WIS committee, especially the CFF Scholarship program.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 29 th ICAR, Rhonda Cardin will become WIS Chair. Rhonda has played an important role in leading the Mentoring Program, which will now be led by Jennifer Moffat. Karen Buckheit will take charge of the WIS Roundtable, and she'll be looking for new ideas from ISAR members to make the event even more helpful to women scientists. Finally, many thanks to all the members of the WIS Committee for their hard work and dedication as we move forward. \n\nThe 9th ICAR was held at the Urabandai Nekoma Hotel on 19-24 May, 1996. The meeting was jointly sponsored by the Japanese Association for Antiviral Chemotherapy, with Shiro Shigeta of Fukushima Medical College as the lead local organizer. A number of members of the JAAC are shown in the photo above.\n\nIn 1996, Hugh Field was ISAR President, George Galasso was Past-President and Earl Kern was President-Elect. Koen Andries was secretary, Jack Secrist was treasurer and Rich Whitley chaired the program committee.\n\nMike Ussery and Joe Colacino study posters at the 9 th ICAR. Joe confesses \"I still have that awful tie.\"\n\nThe ISAR award lectures had not yet been instituted. Plenary presentations included David Ho speaking on HIV; Karen Lindsay on therapeutic trials for hepatitis C; Akira Matsuda on SAH hydrolase inhibitors; and John Huggins on therapy of emerging virus infections.\n\nThe 19 th ICAR was held at the Caribe Hilton Hotel. Jack Secrist was ISAR President, John Drach was Past President and Chris McGuigan was President Elect. Amy Patick was secretary, John Morrey was treasurer and John Drach chaired the program committee.\n\nThe Elion Award was presented to Bob Sidwell, who gave a lecture on \"Influenza: Search for a cure.\" Tom\u00e1s Cihlar received the Prusoff Young Investigator Award, and spoke on \"Understanding the biological attributes of nucleoside phosphonates: from the first (cidofovir) to the newest (GS-9131).\" Bob Buckheit recalls that in 2006 \"ISAR was going through some financial issues\u2026 Things were cut back to the bare bones, and we ran out of food at the reception.\" This photo appears to show members discussing possible sources of nutrition, and who should climb the trees in search of coconuts. \n\nMy interest in antiviral drug testing began when I was a student in Venezuela, working in the AIDS lab of the National Institute of Hygiene in Caracas. After finishing our routine work, a colleague and I would spend our afternoons evaluating the antiviral activity of a large collection of compounds, extracts and natural products. I soon found myself applying to study at KU Leuven and to work at the Rega Institute for Medical Research, under the guidance of Erik De Clercq.\n\nAt the Rega, I began studying the mechanism of HIV entry, which was then a focus of intensive research, with great expectations for its potential as a drug target. The chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 had just been identified as inhibitors of HIV-1 replication, and the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 (then termed \"fusin\") were known to be coreceptors for HIV entry into CD4+ cells. This helped to explain HIV tropism, which previously had been thought of as either \"macrophage-tropic\" or \"T-cell-tropic\". CCR5 became the target of drugs now in use (1, 2) , and it's also the center of current gene-editing strategies attempting to cure HIV infection.\n\nThe bicyclams, a class of entry inhibitors with an elusive mode of action, also became part of my research. Bicyclams were finally identified as specific antagonists of CXCR4 (3, 4) . The prototype became a marketed drug for mobilizing stem cells (5, 6) , and also an excellent tool to study virus-coreceptor interactions and entry. Since that time, my research interests have focused on how cellular cofactors affect virus replication and how they might be used to intervene in infection and disease.\n\nWorking for Erik in Leuven also resulted in my first contact with ISAR. I attended ICAR for the first time as a graduate student in the mid-90s, and I've participated continually over the years, but I never expected to be so deeply involved in the management of the Society!\n\nOn completing my Ph.D. studies, I joined the Retrovirology Laboratory of the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol in Badalona (Barcelona), which was later to become the AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa. I was excited to be leading my own research group at a relatively early stage of my career, in a place where fundamental and clinical research combine to provide solutions for patients. I am also a faculty member of the immunology program of the Universitat Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona.\n\nOur clinical unit follows some 2000 patients, many of whom participate in clinical trials and collaborate in our research. During my time at the IrsiCaixa, I've witnessed how HIV infection has been converted from a deadly disease with poor treatment options to a manageable chronic condition, and I'm happy that I'm still seeing patients I first met 19 years ago! We now have the knowledge and the tools to halt AIDS, but political will, full access to medicines and education are needed to control the spread of infection in less fortunate countries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nHIV infection is treatable and manageable, but there is still no cure, and an effective vaccine is nowhere in sight. Despite outstanding advances in deciphering the immunology and pathogenesis of HIV infection, the knowledge and tools to design effective preventive and therapeutic vaccines are still not available, including the unambiguous identification of adequate surrogate markers of protection. Evaluating the efficacy of HIV vaccines therefore requires long and costly clinical trials, just to have a glimpse of their potential use. However, there is now cautious optimism regarding the early clinical development of a number of vaccine candidates and broadly neutralizing antibodies, and the field has come to realize that without a vaccine there won't be an end to HIV.\n\nMy lab's current line of research attempts to understand host-pathogen interactions, how HIV cofactors affect virus replication and the cellular mechanisms that affect virus persistence. HIV integrates into the cellular genome, and cells may become latently infected for life. If antiretroviral treatment is interrupted for any reason, viremia rebounds within days and treatment needs to be resumed. How HIV is reactivated is a subject of intensive research world-wide, as it is perceived as a strategy to purge latently infected cells. Even though this strategy may eventually prove to be wrong, it will certainly represent the basis of future and effective treatments aiming at eradicating HIV from the body.\n\nThe cellular protein SAMHD1 functions as a triphosphohydrolase, reducing intracellular titers of dNTP required for DNA synthesis, cell proliferation or HIV-1 reverse transcription. Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with aberrant DNA synthesis and autoimmune disease. From (7), with permission.\n\nMy group has recently identified the biochemical pathway leading to the activation and deactivation of SAMHD1, a host factor that restricts HIV-1 infection in non-proliferating cells such monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (7) . Intracellular restriction of HIV replication appears to be tightly dependent on and controlled by the cell cycle. A precisely orchestrated system allows cells to proliferate, and any deviation leads either to aberrant cell proliferation and cancer or to DNA damage, apoptosis or cell death.\n\nCell proliferation is also tightly linked to how cells detect incoming pathogens and trigger an innate antiviral response. Thus, this same system in which cellular checkpoints control DNA replication and transcription may provide the basis to understand innate immunity to HIV infection, how and when provirus is awakened and transcribed and importantly, how cell proliferation is affecting the persistence of HIV through, for example, homeostatic cell proliferation of infected cells.\n\nWe are beginning to explore how drugs targeting the cell cycle and cell proliferation (8, 9) may be used to intervene in HIV replication and latency and to block the expansion of infected cells.\n\nThe recent identification of proviral DNA integration into genes associated to cancer and cell-cycle regulation (10) , and the observation that such regulation appears to serve as an important mechanism of viral persistence, may indicate that therapies that target HIV-infected proliferating cells may be implemented to cure HIV infection (11) .\n\nISAR has meant a lot to my scientific career. Many times the conference has served as a perfect platform for me to convey and discuss my group's research and effectively seek the collaboration of others. I've learnt a great deal about drug development and the close collaborations between academia and industry that are required to bring a new drug closer to the patient.\n\nIn a time when many complementary scientific meetings occur simultaneously, and technology has brought us closer together, ICAR still represents an excellent platform with a characteristic multidisciplinary component, that stands out from other meetings focused on virology, drug development or medical science. It provides the perfect stage for students and young researchers to come into contact with scientists and stake-holders in identifying, characterizing and developing new antiviral agents, all the way from the drawing board to the bench to the clinic. ISAR is making great efforts to support and encourage the participation of young researchers, and I invite them to become involved in the Society, as I once did.\n\nIn 2010, I received the William Prusoff Young Investigator Award. I've been a member of the ISAR Board of Directors for a number of years, and was elected President-Elect in 2015, with my term as President beginning at the end of the meeting in La Jolla. As I now prepare to take over the leading role, I can only feel indebted to ISAR.\n\nRecently reelected to the ISAR Executive Board for a second term, Kathie has been a Society member since the early 1990's and has served as Chair of Poster awards for the past four years. She is currently a Professor of Chemistry & Biochemistry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), the UMBC Presidential Research Professor, and also the President of the International Society of Nucleosides, Nucleotides & Nucleic Acids (IS3NA). \n\nIt seems like I've always loved science. Growing up in Erie, PA, I was in a combined high school-college program, and it was genetics I found most attractive. For my first research project, I bought two black-andwhite-spotted mice at a pet shop and bred them until they produced a pure black strain. It took a year and a half, and at one point I had more than 200 mice in my bedroom, which drove my parents (and our cat) crazy! Eventually my interests shifted from mice to chemistry, when I had two wonderful organic chemistry professors at St. Petersburg College in Clearwater, Florida. A few years later I found myself gravitating towards medicinal chemistry, because I wanted to do something applied, and the chance to spend my life looking for ways to cure diseases was very exciting.\n\nStew Schneller was the chair of the chemistry department at the University of South Florida, and I joined his lab as a graduate student in 1990. My initial project focused on synthesizing cyclobutyl nucleosides related to lobucavir, with the goal of inhibiting hepatitis B virus. Two years into my Ph.D., Stew moved to Auburn University to become Dean, and so I moved to Auburn to finish up my research. By then I was working on a series of carbocyclic 5'-nor nucleosides, specifically unnatural L-like nucleosides. After receiving my Ph.D. from Auburn, I stayed on with Stew as a postdoc for another two years, and continued to focus on the design and synthesis of carbocyclic nucleoside analogues as antivirals.\n\nAt the time we were especially interested in the inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, as a way of shutting down viral and parasitic replication pathways. Our compounds were screened against many viruses, so we often changed targets based on the results of drug screening. This work brought me into contact with many long-term collaborators at the Rega Institute, including Erik de Clercq, Jan Balzarini, Johan Neyts, Graciela Andrei, Robert Snoeck and Lieve Naesens, and also with researchers at other institutions, including Brent Korba, Earl Kern and Dale Barnard, all of whom have remained good friends.\n\nAfter I left Stew's group to begin my independent career at Georgia Tech, I continued to work on carbocyclics, but also decided to expand the scope of my projects and the potential viral target landscape. My primary focus turned to the design and synthesis of ribose and 2'-deoxyribose nucleoside analogues. One of my first NIH-funded projects was centered on a series of nucleosides with \"expanded purine\" and \"extended pyrimidine\" nucleobases 1 , related to Nelson Leonard's expanded lin-benzoadenosine analogues. 2 While doing basic chemistry, our main priority remained in development of novel antivirals, and it was from the expanded purine project that the \"fleximers\" that my lab is known for ultimately evolved. Since then we've seen success for these structurally unique nucleosides against a number of viruses, and even some parasites.\n\nSince joining UMBC, my primary focus has been the synthesis and characterization of various classes of flexible nucleosides. 3, 4 As shown in Figure 1 , these molecules have a \"split purine\" heterocyclic base that permits them to turn and rotate, while remaining connected by a single carbon-carbon bond. They therefore retain the key features needed for hydrogenbonding and base-pairing, but are also able to reposition within an enzyme binding site, when faced with steric or electronic clashes. [5] [6] [7] Because viral drug resistance often develops through point mutations in enzyme binding-sites, the fleximers possess advantages over conventional, rigid nucleoside analogues.\n\nSome of our structurally diverse nucleosides. Upper left: 2'-modified thiophene-expanded purine analogue that showed activity against HCV; Upper right: Flex-G, first guanosine analogue reported to inhibit Sadenosylhomocysteine hydrolase -an adenosine metabolizing enzyme; Bottom: double prodrug of Flex-Acyclovir -first nucleoside analogue reported to exhibit potent activity against coronaviruses, specifically MERS-CoV.\n\nMy team at UMBC has pursued several different types of fleximers with various modified sugars, including a series of 2'-modified analogues related to sofosbuvir and gemcitabine, 8, 9 as well as carbocyclic fleximers 10, 11 and 2'-deoxy analogues. 12 Some of these molecules inhibit a variety of viruses and parasites, but our primary focus is now on the recently developed doubly-flexible analogues because of their potent activity against coronaviruses.\n\nLast year we published the first report of a nucleoside analogue (Flex-Acyclovir) that inhibits the MERS coronavirus 13 , and we'll soon be reporting our most recent results with additional analogues, which have exhibited even better selectivity and potency. In the meantime, our colleagues in Leuven and Leiden have been screening several prodrugs of the double fleximers, and the corresponding triphosphate of Flex-Acyclovir is about to enter testing as well. We're also synthesizing a second series of doubly-flexible analogues based on tenofovir.\n\nIn a related project, we've been collaborating with Sina Bavari and Veronica Soloveva at USAMRIID and with Sam Lee, Doug Mayers and others at CoCrystal to develop antivirals against Ebola virus. We hope to report results for that project in the coming months as well.\n\nA third project centers around disrupting the proteinprotein interactions of the HIV nucleocapsid protein, NCp7 with Flex-base analogues. In terms of other heterocylic base inhibitors, we also work closely with two groups in Russia. My collaboration with Mikhail Novikov of Volgograd Medical University have uncovered a number of potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of various viruses, 14 \n\nThis dates back to my first project at Georgia Tech, involving expanded purines and extended pyrimidines. About eight years ago one of my grad students, Kartik Temburnikar, was assigned to tackle the extended pyrimidine part of the project. These were a series of Cnucleosides with thieno-and pyrrolo-pyrimidine bases. Interestingly, we had made the thiophene-expanded purine base back in 2000 1 , and it exhibited some anticancer activity, but it got buried in the excitement over the fleximer project, and was somewhat forgotten. When Kartik came across that paper four years ago, he decided to send both the nucleobases and the nucleosides for screening, and thank goodness he did! To make a long story short -Jan Balzarini did some tox studies, and this gave us our first clue that the compounds might have some value against cancers. Screening by NCI revealed low-nanomolar activity against a number of important cancers. A UMB collaborator observed tumor shrinkage of 50% in 7-14 days in a mouse melanoma xenograft model, with no toxicity (unlike temozolomide, the standard of care, which is fairly toxic). As a result, we then screened against other cancers, and recently obtained funding to test these compounds in animals, targeting leukemia and non-small-cell lung, pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancer. We're encouraged that these compounds may provide a cheaper alternative to some very expensive drugs.\n\nIn 2001, I was recruited by the Department of Defense to collaborate on smallpox research with Russian scientists, as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, and I started going to Russia several times a year. In 2006, I was selected as a Jefferson Science Fellow at the National Academy of Sciences, and spent a year at the State Department in Washington, working with former weapons scientists as well as other Russian virologists and chemists on some projects emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. These efforts were focused on the U.S. nonproliferation efforts to prevent the use of biological pathogens for biowarfare and bioterrorism. Once again I spent a lot of time in Russia, and also in Indonesia.\n\nFollowing my time at the State Department, I went back to Russia for several months each year to help with various scientific issues at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, including the ever-changing political landscape for scientists in Russia. I succeeded in establishing several research collaborations which continue today. One of the most rewarding aspects of science is the opportunity to cross both scientific disciplines and international borders.\n\nAs a medicinal chemist, I've been extremely fortunate to work closely with excellent collaborators, many of whom I met through ISAR! In addition to those mentioned above, for the coronavirus project our group has collaborated with Johan Neyts and Dirk Jochmans in Leuven and most recently with Eric Snijder, Adriaan de Wilde and Clara Posthuma at Leiden Medical University in the Netherlands. When Johan and Dirk first discovered our compounds' anti-coronavirus activity, they introduced me to Eric and his group (see their article in last ISAR News discussing their work on coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and our results with Flex-Acyclovir and related analogues).\n\nNeedless to say, we're very excited about these findings with our doubly flexible nucleosides (one example is shown in the bottom of the figure), as there is still no cure for SARS or MERS. 13 And, given the outbreak last year in South Korea, the finding that a nucleoside can successfully evade the rather vigilant coronavirus proofreading mechanisms is groundbreaking. We recently filed a joint patent on this novel approach and are looking forward to pursuing this very exciting lead. But to bring this full circle, ISAR has definitely played a key role in my success and I look forward to ICAR each year -it is an excellent opportunity to see old friends, catch up on groundbreaking results and of course, meet face to face with our collaborators.\n\nin mind. By 2002, we had determined the first crystal structure of a coronavirus protein, the M pro of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus [1] . The structure revealed a novel helical domain, in addition to the classical chymotrypsin-fold, and the necessity of dimer formation for catalytic activity, which motivated us to synthesize a simple chloromethyl-ketone inhibitor.\n\nIn 2003, during the SARS epidemic, we published the second coronavirus structure, the M pro of human coronavirus 229E, as well as a homology model for the corresponding SARS-CoV enzyme [2] . On the basis of our structure of the TGEV M pro in complex with our chloromethyl-ketone inhibitor and some docking experiments, we proposed that rupintrivir (AG7088), which was under development at that time by Pfizer as an inhibitor of the rhinovirus 3C protease, would \"nearly fit\" the substrate-binding site of the SARS-CoV M pro , and could therefore be a starting point for the design of anti-SARS drugs [2] . This prediction was verified a little later: while rupintrivir is inactive against the SARS CoV, derivatives of this Michael acceptor compound that lack the p-fluorobenzyl group in the P2 position are potent inhibitors [3] .\n\nSubsequent to the on-line publication of our 2003 paper in Science [2] , I was invited by the Chinese government to come to Beijing for an emergency meeting during the peak of the SARS epidemic, when there were more than 3000 cases in the city. At this event, I met Zihe Rao, who invited me to stay with him at Tsinghua University and work on the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV M pro , which we published a few months later [4] . These three M pro structures laid the cornerstones for the design of antiviral drugs against coronaviruses, and were used by many researchers for that purpose [5] .\n\nDuring the years following the SARS outbreak, many structures of other coronavirus proteins were determined, mainly by the groups of Zihe Rao in Beijing; Peter Kuhn, Ray Stevens and Kurt W\u00fcthrich in San Diego; Bruno Canard in Marseille; and my own group in L\u00fcbeck. We focused on nonstructural proteins (Nsp) encoded by open reading frame 1a, in particular the X domain [6] , the SARS-unique domain [7, 8] , Nsp7-8 [9] , and Nsp9 [10] . Unfortunately, the goal of anti-coronavirus drug design got a bit lost in the rush for new structures! One reason was that funding for research on the SARS CoV declined rapidly in many countries after the 2006. This was partly the fault of the virology community itself, as many colleagues believed that the SARS epidemic was a one-time event that would never be repeated.\n\nStructure of the SARS CoV main (3C-like) protease [4] .\n\nAfter 2006, we continued to design and synthesize some peptide aldehydes [11] and a few non-peptidic benzotriazoles [12] as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV M pro , but then even my own group started to change its focus, targeting the enterovirus 3C protease. We created the peptidomimetic Michael acceptor compound SG85 [13] , which had superb activity in cell culture against enterovirus (EV) 68 (the causative agent of the \"summer flu\" that hit the midwest USA in 2014), EV71 (the virus causing hand, foot and mouth disease), and human rhinoviruses [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n\nWe did not re-activate our antiviral design efforts against the coronaviral M pro until the MERS-CoV surfaced in late 2012. Recognizing that a few thousand cases of severe CoV disease would never make the development of an antiviral drug commercially viable, and that serious enterovirus infections are far more common, we now aimed at designing inhibitors that would be (nearly) equipotent against enteroviruses, betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and alphacoronaviruses such as HCoV NL63. However, the goal was difficult to reach, with the most challenging target being the alphacoronavirus M pro , which has a far smaller and less flexible S2 pocket than the corresponding proteases of the enteroviruses and the betacoronaviruses.\n\nIn the course of this study, we synthesized dozens of compounds and determined quite a number of crystal structures, until we finally found some alphaketoamides that fulfilled our design goal. Remarkably, the most potent of these molecules has an EC 50 of 5 nM against MERS-CoV in Huh7 liver cells. In addition to the CoV main protease, we also became interested in the other polyprotein-processing enzyme of coronaviruses, the papain-like protease, and determined would enthusiastically share his experiences and sightseeing recommendations.\n\nIn our last conversation, just a few hours before his death, Kris was the same affectionate and caring person I met 20 years ago, still enthusiastic about hepatitis research and recent advances in the field. I'm grateful for our long association, especially for his guidance during the early years of my career and for our long relationship as friends and colleagues. I also cherished my friendship with his lovely and hospitable wife, Elzbieta. I miss them both very much.\n\nSaleem Kamili, Ph.D. Acting Branch Chief Laboratory Branch, Division of Viral Hepatitis CDC, Atlanta, GA\n\nKathie Seley-Radtke would like ISAR members to know that the XXII International Round Table on Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids will be held on 18-22 July at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
