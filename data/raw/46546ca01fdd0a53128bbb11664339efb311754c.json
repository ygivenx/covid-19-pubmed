{"title": "Toward the identification of viral cap-methyltransferase inhibitors by fluorescence screening assay", "body": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spread in China in 2003 and was responsible for worldwide outbreak causing over 8000 infected people with a fatality rate around 10% (de Wit et al., 2016) . In 2012, a novel human coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula with secondary infection cases reported in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. MERS-CoV infection resulted in more than 1728 confirmed infected patients till April 2016 with a fatality rate of 36% (de Wit et al., 2016) .\n\nCoVs are enveloped viruses possessing a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb in length (Pan et al., 2008; Van Boheemen et al., 2012) . The SARS-CoV initiates its replication cycle after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Kuhn et al., 2004) . After endocytosis, the viral RNA genome is released into the cellular host cytoplasm and translated into two large polyproteins (de Wit et al., 2016; Snijder et al., 2016) . The pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins are next cleaved by viral proteases into 11 and 16 non-structural proteins respectively (nsp1 to 16). These proteins form a large replication transcription complex (RTC) which is associated to host cellular proteins (Van Hemert et al., 2008) . CoV RTC ensures the replication of the viral genome and the transcription of genomic and subgenomic mRNA. These viral RNAs are polyadenylated at their 3 0 end and protected by a 5 0 cap structure, which is synthetized by viral enzymes. The CoV capping pathway is thought to follow four sequential steps implicating several nsps: I) the 5 0 -3 0 helicase/ NTPase nsp13 hydrolyses first the phosphate g from the nascent 5'triphosphorylated RNA (Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004) ; II) a GMP molecule is supposedly transferred to the diphosphorylated RNA by a still unknown guanylyltransferase forming a cap (GpppN) structure; III) the cap is then methylated at N7 position of the guanosine by nsp14 in the presence of methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) yielding to a cap-0 ( 7m GpppN) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) by-product (Chen et al., 2009) ; IV) nsp10/nsp16 complex methylates at the ribose 2 0 OH group of the first transcribed RNA leading to the conversion of the cap-0 ( 7m GpppN) into the cap-1 ( 7m GpppN 2'om ) (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011) . In vitro assays have deciphered the mechanisms driving the RNA cap methylation in SARS-and MERS-CoV. It follows an obligatory order in which N7-methylation by nsp14 is a pre-requisite for 2 0 Omethylation by the nsp10/nsp16 complex (Aouadi et al., 2017; Bouvet et al., 2014 Bouvet et al., , 2010 .\n\nThe guanine N7-MTase activity embedded in the C-terminal domain of SARS-nsp14 has been discovered by yeast transcomplementation assay (Chen et al., 2009 ). In addition, the N-terminus moiety of nsp14 contains a DEDDh exonuclease (ExoN) domain (Minskaia et al., 2006) . The two domains communicate functionally, as truncation experiments showed that the N-terminal region of nsp14 is required for the N7-MTase activity (Chen et al., 2009) . Both N7-MTase and ExoN activities have been confirmed by in vitro assay showing that the association of nsp10 to nsp14 stimulated >35 fold the ExoN activity while the N7-MTase activity does not depend on the nsp10-nsp14 interaction (Bouvet et al., 2012 (Bouvet et al., , 2010 Decroly et al., 2011) .\n\nThe N7-and 2 0 O-methylations of the viral mRNA cap are key events for the viral infection. Indeed reverse genetic experiments revealed first that the N7-methylation of cap structures is essential for the synthesis of viral proteins (Case et al., 2016) . This observation is corroborated by former biochemical data showing that the N7-methyl guanosine of cap structures is recognized by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and participates in the initiation of viral mRNA translation into proteins (Case et al., 2016; Cougot et al., 2004) . Accordingly, inhibitors blocking nsp14 N7-MTase activity have been identified by yeast based screening assay on SARS-CoV, and induced a potent antiviral effect demonstrating that nsp14 MTase activity is an attractive antiviral target (Sun et al., 2014) . Whereas N7-MTase mutants are replication defective, 2 0 O-MTase mutants show limited effect on virus replication in cell culture but have an attenuated phenotype in animal models Menachery et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Z\u00fcst et al., 2013) . The molecular basis of this attenuated phenotype was recently elucidated: incompletely-capped RNAs have been shown to be recognized by immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA-5, which trigger innate immunity pathways Schuberth-Wagner et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) . In turn, RIG-I or MDA-5 induces signalling cascades yielding to the expression of cytokines and type I interferon inducing an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Among the interferon-stimulated gens (ISG), IFIT1 also participates to the restriction of viral replication by sequestrating mis-capped viral RNAs (Pichlmair et al., 2011) . Thus cap structure is now considered as a kind of \"marker of self\" and it is currently admitted that 2 0 O-MTase inhibitors might help virus clearance by stimulation of the immune response Ferron et al., 2012; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011) .\n\nIn this work we first developed an HTRF MTase assay in order to identify compounds inhibiting the N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14. Using this system, we screened a library composed of 2000 compounds containing 1280 FDA approved molecules (Prestwick Chemical Library \u00ae ), 320 natural products and 400 pyridazine-derived compounds. The inhibitory effect of the 20 best compounds was confirmed by a radioactive filter-binding assay, and refined by IC 50 values determination on SARS nsp14 and human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT). In addition, the specificity of each compound was further evaluated using the CoV 2 0 O-MTase (nsp10/ nsp16) and the MTases of Dengue and West-Nile flaviviruses as well as the hRNMT involved in the capping of cellular RNAs.\n\nThe Prestwick Chemical Library \u00ae is a unique collection of 1280 small molecules, mostly approved drugs (FDA, EMA and other agencies) selected for their high chemical and pharmacological diversity as well as for their known bioavailability and safety in humans. The Prestwick Phytochemical Library is a collection of 320 natural products, mostly derived from plants, assembled by medicinal chemists and rich in diverse chemotypes, thus realistic for follow-up chemistry. The Prestwick Pyridazine Library is a collection of 400 innovative pyridazine and pyridazone derivatives, based on a series of carefully selected new original scaffolds. All molecules have been designed to ensure optimal diversity, and are suitable for diverse chemical modification.\n\nThe viral MTases (SARS-CoV nsp14, MERS-CoV nsp14, DENV-3 NS5-MTase, West Nile virus NS5-MTase, DENV-2 NS5-RdRp and human RNA N7-methyltransferase (RNMT) coding sequences were cloned in fusion with a N-terminus hexa-histidine tag in Gateway \u00ae plasmids (pDest14 or pDest17, Life technologies). The proteins were expressed in E. coli cells and purified following previously described protocols (Aouadi et al., 2017; Bouvet et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2015; Milhas et al., 2016; Peyrane et al., 2007; Selisko et al., 2006) . MERS-CoV nsp14 was produced and purified as follows: the protein were expressed in Arctic Express E. coli strain (Agilent) at 13 C during 24 h after addition of 50 mM IPTG. The bacteria were pelleted (13,000\u00c2 g, 4 C, 5 min), and lysed by sonication in appropriate buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mg/ml DNase-I and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme). After clarification (50,000\u00c2 g, 30 min at 4 C) the recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) on 1 ml of HisPurTM Cobalt Resin (Thermo Scientific) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 (GE healthcare) equilibrated in (30 mM HEPES pH (7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol). The purified proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels after Coomassie blue staining ( Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 ).\n\nFor the initial screening, 400 nl of each compound resuspended in 100% DMSO at 1 mM were dispensed in the reaction volume (5% final DMSO, 50 mM compound) using a Mosquito Crystal pipetting robot platform (TTP labtech). DMSO, sinefungin (20 mM) and SAH (2 mM) were used as controls.\n\nThe enzymatic reaction was performed in 8 ml. 3 ml of mix (Buffer \u00fe SARS nsp14 at 5 nM final concentration) were added in the assay wells, containing previously dispensed inhibitors (0.4 ml), using a Biomek NX MC pipetting robot (Beckman). The reaction buffer is composed of (Tris-HCl 40 mM (pH 8.0) and DTT 0.5 mM final concentrations). Reaction was started with 4.6 ml of a mix containing both GpppA (NEB ref S1406) and SAM at 8 mM and 2 mM final concentrations respectively and was incubated 20 min at 30 C. For the detection of released SAH, the EPIgeneous\u2122 methyltransferase kit was purchased from CisBio Bioassays and reconstituted according to the supplier protocols. HTRF assays were performed in white 384 Well Small Volume\u2122 HiBase Polystyrene Microplates (Greiner) with a final volume of 20 ml. 2 ml of EPIgeneous detection buffer one and 2 ml of NaCl 5 M were then added in order to stop the reaction. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, detection reagents were added: 4 ml of a 1/16 dilution of SAH conjugated to the florescent dye d2 in a first place then 4 ml of Anti-SAH antibody-Lumi4-Tb at a 1/150 dilution. HTRF signals were measured, after a 1 h final incubation at room temperature, using a PHERAstarFS (BMG Labtech) with an excitation filter at 337 nm and fluorescence wavelength measurements at 620 and 665 nm, an integration delay of 60 ms and an integration time of 400 ms. Results were analyzed with a two-wavelength signal ratio:\n\n[intensity (665 nm)/intensity (620 nm)]*10 4 (HTRF Ratio). The normalized HTRF ratio is calculated as follow: [(compound signal) -(min signal)]/[(max signal) -(min signal)] * 100, where 'max signal' is the signal ratio without protein and 'min signal' the signal ratio with DMSO in place of compound.\n\nThe Z 0 factor is calculated using the following equation: Z 0 \u00bc 1 e [3(SD of max) \u00fe 3(SD of min)]/[(mean max signal) -(mean min signal)], where SD is the standard deviation. For IC 50 measurements, values were normalized and fitted with Prism (GraphPad software) using the following equation: Y \u00bc 100/(1 \u00fe ((X/IC50)^Hill slope)).\n\nThe initial screening assay was performed once and the hits were then confirmed by determination of IC 50 (HTRF) in quadruplicates. IC 50 (HTRF) is defined as the compound concentration for which the SAH release is decreased by 50%.\n\nThe inhibitor specificity assays were carried out in reaction mixture [40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM SAM, and 0.33 mM 3 H-SAM (Perkin Elmer)] in the presence of 0.7 mM GpppAC 4 or 7m GpppAC 4 synthetic RNAs. Purified SARS-nsp14 (10 nM), MERS-nsp14 (250 nM), SARS-nsp10/nsp16 (1 mM), MERS-nsp10/nsp16 (500 nM), hRNMT (20 nM), DENV-MT (500 nM) and WNV NS5 (500 nM). The enzymes were mixed first with 50 mM inhibitors before the addition of RNA substrate and SAM and then incubated at 30 C. The final concentration of DMSO was 5%, and control reactions were performed in the presence of 5% DMSO.\n\nReaction mixtures were stopped after 30 min by their 10-fold dilution in ice-cold 100 mM SAH. Samples were transferred to \n\nSARS-CoV encodes the bi-functional enzyme nsp14, which contains an N-terminal ExoN domain followed by a N7-MTase domain involved in RNA capping. The recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size exclusion chromatography. The purified nsp14 is detected as a single band migrating at the expected molecular mass (Fig. 1A , z60 kDa) on Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE gels. The purified nsp14 transfers [ 3 H] methyl onto a GpppA cap analogue whereas no MTase activity is detected onto 7m GpppA (Fig. 1B) indicating that nsp14 harbors an N7-MTase activity that can be detected using cost effective commercial cap analogues.\n\nWe miniaturized the EPIgenous MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) (Degorce et al., 2009) to screen a library of 2000 compounds. The principle of the HTRF assay, shown in Fig. S2 , is to follow the MTase activity by indirectly detecting SAH, the by-product of the methyl transfer reaction. Indeed, in the detection system, the released SAH competes with fluorescent SAH-d2, which binds to an anti-SAH antibody coupled to a cryptate fluorophore (see Material and Methods). Thus, increase of SAH leads to decrease of the HTRF signal (Fig. S3D) . The experimental conditions for the enzymatic assay were optimized and adapted for automated screening assay. Briefly, I) the enzyme concentration was set up at 5 nM of nsp14 as titration curves indicated that 80% of the maximal activity after 20 min incubation period is obtained at this enzyme concentration (Fig. S3A) ; II) GpppA substrate concentration was adjusted at 8 mM to robustly and reproducibly detect N7-MTase activity (Fig. S3B) ; III) SAM concentration was adjusted to 2 mM in order to ensure the optimal conversion rate of SAM to SAH according to the manufacture recommendations (z4e11%, Fig. S3C/D) . The SAH detection conditions were optimized and the SAH-d2 and anti-SAH antibody were diluted 1/16 and 1/150 respectively. Fig. 2A shows the time course experiment of nsp14 MTase activity indicating that using our experimental optimized conditions the N7-methylation reaction reached the saturation phase after a 30 min incubation period. The enzymatic reactions were thus incubated during 20 min in the screening. Sinefungin, which has already been reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV N7-MTase (IC 50 z 500 nM) (Bouvet et al., 2010) , was used as positive control for MTase inhibition. The inhibition curve of nsp14 MTase using the optimized HTRF assay revealed an inhibition in a similar range, with IC 50 (HTRF) value of 110 nM (Fig. 2B) . We also assessed that the addition of DMSO up to 5% did not impact the MTase reactions and/ or the HTRF quantification of released SAH. The signal variation was estimated to 2e2.8%. The average of Z 0 value was 0.69.\n\nThe chemical library containing 1280 FDA approved molecules, 320 natural substrates and 400 pyridazine derived compounds was used for initial screening at 50 mM of each compound and the inhibition was determined using HTRF assay. Compounds showing inhibition of the MTase activity higher than 42%, which corresponds to increase of the HTRF signal >20% (Fig. S4) , were first selected (41 compounds, Fig. 3 ). 21 compounds were discarded due to signal interference with the HTRF assay or by visual inspection. The 20 remaining compounds (hit rate 0.1%, Table 1 ) were selected for IC 50 (HTRF) determination by HTRF. The results presented in Table 1 indicate that the IC 50 (HTRF) vary from 0.16 to > 400 mM, among which 4 have an IC 50 (HTRF) higher than 75mM. IC 50 (HTRF) for 1159, 597, 194 were not determined due to intrinsic fluorescence interferences at high concentration. Thus, 13 compounds show IC 50 (HTRF) ranging from 0.16 to 75 mM. \n\nIn order to validate the inhibition observed by HTRF, we next performed a radioactive MTase assay (FBA) using freshly solubilized compounds. In this experiment, the MTase activity was analyzed by measuring the [ 3 H] radiolabeled methyl transferred onto a longer synthetic RNA substrate (GpppAC 4 ). This capped RNA was previously evidenced as a better substrate for nsp14 N7-MTase than the cap analogue GpppA (Bouvet et al., 2010) . The low inhibition of the 4 compounds showing IC 50 (HTRF) > 75 mM by HTRF (1434, 152, 545, 909) , was confirmed by the FBA assay. In addition the fluorescent compounds 194, 597 poorly inhibits the MTase activity in this FBA assay. Finally, eleven compounds display a potent inhibition (>80%) at 50 mM concentration using the radioactive assay (Table 2) .\n\nWhereas we observed some discrepancies between HTRF and FBA assay for a couple of compounds (210 and 909), which could be explained by the difference in RNA substrate length used in both assays; we observed a good correlation between both assays. Table 2 Inhibition specificity of compounds at 50 mM on MTases and DENV-2 polymerase activities using DEAE-filter binding assay.\n\nThe compounds are clustered and framed according to their inhibition specificity from wide range to specific inhibitors. ND: Not determined.\n\nThe specificity of the 20 compounds was then analyzed by measuring their inhibition profile on other viral and cellular MTases (for more details see workflow in Fig. S5 ). We thus produced and purified the SARS-and MERS-CoV nsp14 and the nsp10/nsp16 complex (2 0 O-MTase); the full length NS5 of the West Nile (WNV) and NS5-MTase domain of Dengue 3 (DENV-3) viruses and the human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT) (Fig. S1 ) in order to compare their inhibition profile. The inhibition of each compound (50 mM) was then determined by FBA MTase activity measurements. In addition, we also tested whether the DENV-2-RdRp activity is inhibited in order to address the compound specificity. The results summarized in Table 2 show that among the 11 best SARS-CoV nsp14 inhibitors confirmed by FBA (Table 5) , 5 (925, 1426, 1298, 1305, 1159) show large spectrum inhibition as they inhibit all tested MTases as well as the DENV-2 RdRp. Table 2 also reveals that sinefungin (used as positive control) and compound 1040 exhibit a broad spectrum MTase inhibition profile with no inhibition detected on the RdRp activity of DENV NS5. This broad-spectrum inhibition observed with sinefungin has already been reported and can be related to its structural homology with the SAM/SAH (Dong et al., 2010) . Interestingly, compound 792 inhibits mainly the CoV N7-and 2 0 O-MTase as well as the hRNMT but barely interferes with DENV-3 or WNV NS5 MTase activity. Finally, the four last compounds (312, 1418, 1207, 604) show more specific inhibition profile on MERS-and SARS-CoV nsp14 although they inhibit the hRNMT.\n\nTo further characterize the eleven most potent nsp14 N7-MTase inhibitors, a dose response curve was performed with the compounds showing percentage inhibition higher or equal to 40% against SARS-CoV nsp14 and the hRNMT. After pre-incubation with increasing concentrations of inhibitors, the MTase activity was followed by FBA. The IC 50 of compounds on either nsp14 or hRNMT activities ranged from 19 nM to 23 mM and 50 nM to 5.5 mM, respectively, confirming the observed inhibition potency of these molecules (Table 3 ). In addition, the IC 50 values determined in this assay corroborate with those performed by HTRF assay (Table 1) . The broad spectrum MTase inhibitor (1040) shows IC 50 values of 4.5 and 5.1 mM on SARS nsp14 and human hRNMT respectively and four compounds targeting more specifically SARS, MERS and hRNMT have IC 50 values between 10 and 24 mM, but IC 50 values observed with for hRNMT are lower in each case.\n\nAltogether these results suggest that structural homology between viral and cellular MTases might impair the discovery of inhibitors targeting specifically the CoV N7-MTase (see discussion about homology). Nevertheless, we also observed that the less active inhibitors on SARS-CoV nsp14 barely inhibit the human hRNMT suggesting the possibility to identify more specific MTase inhibitors (Table 2) . A structure activity relationship (SAR) study is required in order to gain in activity and specificity.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of compound 312, analogs were Table 3 Comparison of the IC 50 value of 11 most active compounds on SARS-nsp14 and human RNMT activities using GpppAUAU and GpppAC 4 substrates respectively. searched in the tested libraries. 7 analogs were selected and tested for inhibition of SARS nsp14 and hRNMT MTase activities by FBA (Table 4 ). All the 7 analogs bear the benzhydryl-piperazine group characteristic to this chemical series in the right-hand side of the structure. Four compounds lacking the aromatic moiety in the left part of the molecule show no inhibition of SARS-CoV nsp14 MTase. In contrast, 3 analogs carrying an aromatic terminal ring in the lefthand side inhibit the SARS-CoV N7-MTase activity with IC 50 between 6.2 and 14 mM (457, 278 and 1264) . The substitution of the two phenyl rings in the benzhydryl-piperazine moiety (fluorine or chlorine groups) have no impact on the inhibition profile. These compounds were initially not selected from the original screening but their inhibition was close to the selection cut-off (42% inhibition at 50 mM). The compounds inhibited the hRNMT and SARS-CoV nsp14 to similar levels. Although they did not bring additional specificity compared to compound 312, it might be worth sampling a larger chemical space within this family.\n\nThe identification of molecules inhibiting viral enzymes essential for virus replication is a key point to combat emerging viruses.\n\nMethylations of viral mRNA cap structures are an essential step in the virus life-cycle (Case et al., 2016; Cougot et al., 2004) preventing their identification as foreign RNA markers by the host cell (Diamond, 2014; Li et al., 2013; Z\u00fcst et al., 2013) . Thus, enzymes such as MTases involved in viral RNA capping are now considered as promising antiviral targets . Here, we developed a high-throughput MTase screening assay based on HTRF technology that possesses advantageous features. The HTRF assay allows the minimization of non-specific fluorescence emissions by introducing a time delay (50e150 ms) between the initial light excitation and fluorescence measurement (Degorce et al., 2009) . This time delay limits the interference of fluorescent compounds in the screening assay. Indeed, only 37 out of 2000 compounds interfered with the detection system among which were considered as 17 false positive. In addition, a non-fluorescent enzymatic assay (FBA) was used to confirm the hits obtained from the primary screening. The initial screening was performed using a commercial cap analogue substrate (GpppA), as the availability of high amount of capped RNA substrates is a limiting step. This screening allowed the identification of 20 compounds inhibiting at least 42% of the nsp14 N7-MTase activity. The inhibitory effect (below 25 mM, Table 3 ) of 11 of these compounds was confirmed using a radioactive filterbinding assay performed with longer synthetic RNA substrates (GpppAC 4 ). In contrast, 9 compounds barely inhibited the MTase activity measured with GpppAC 4 substrate. Thus, it is likely that the use of GpppA as substrate may favor the identification of inhibitors that would be less efficient on longer RNA substrates. The weaker inhibition effect observed using longer RNA substrates might suggest that these compounds interfere with the RNA binding site of the enzyme.\n\nOne important issue in the drug discovery process is to identify compounds inhibiting specifically the viral enzymes but barely active on the cognate cellular enzymes in order to limit their cytotoxicity or off-target effects. To determine the compound specificity at the early stage of the screening process, we compared the inhibition activity of the 20 compounds on other viral MTases (SARS-and MERS-CoV 2 0 O MTase, DEN-V and WNV N7/2 0 O MTases) and a cellular MTase hRNMT involved in the methylation of cap structures. In addition, we also tested these compounds on the Dengue virus polymerase in order to control the inhibition specificity on the RdRp activity and eliminate molecules showing unspecific inhibition or frequent hitters. This strategy revealed that 5 out of the 11 best hits identified in the nsp14 N7-MTase activity-screening campaign potently inhibited all MTases tested as well as the Dengue virus polymerase.\n\nWe also observed that most inhibitors identified in this comparative screening potently inhibit the human RNA N7-MTase hRNMT (12 over 20 compounds). These results might be related to structural and functional homologies between CoV N7-MTase and the human hRNMT limiting the possibility to identify inhibitors targeting specifically the CoV N7-MTase. However, we would like to propose that the inhibitors identified here might well be substrate mimicks and bind to conserved substrate pockets since the protein folding of hRNMT and nsp14 are significantly different, the latter deviating from classical Rossman-fold MTases. It is also noteworthy that this work was performed with a highly active truncated construct of hRNMT, which is used at very low concentration (20 nM) for IC 50 determination. Additionally, it is also possible that as our truncated hRNMT is less selective as it lacks the hRNMT activating Miniprotein (RAM) binding domain and the RAM protein. Indeed it was previously demonstrated that RAM stabilizes the structure and positioning of the hRNMT lobe and increases the specific recruitment of SAM (Varshney et al., 2016) . This high inhibition of hRNMT MTase activity may be overcome in the presence of its allosteric activator RAM, which may allow to stringent the specificity of the compounds.\n\nOut of nsp14, the comparative screening using various MTases also reveals that several compounds show a large spectrum of MTase inhibition without any significant activity detected on the Dengue virus polymerase used as a control (compounds 1040 and the positive control sinefungin). The pleiotropic inhibition observed on MTases activities suggests that despite the weak primary sequence conservation, these enzymes do have a common structural organization (Rosmann fold characteristic of most of viral and cellular MTases) and share similar enzymatic properties. This observation is consistent with the common structural organization, with a conserved SAM, RNA and/or cap binding sites, shared by those MTases. The identification of broad-spectrum viral MTases inhibitors may offer a starting point to develop new antiviral compounds. We considered that these molecules could be interesting as we expected that the SAR process will give the opportunity to increase both specificity and inhibition properties. Accordingly, a SAR study previously performed on the flavivirus MTases has demonstrated that chemical analogs of SAH, showed improved activity and selectivity against DENV MTase, but not on the related human enzymes (Lim et al., 2011) . The crystal structure revealed that the most active SAH derivative harbors substitutions accommodated in a specific cavity conserved in Flaviviral MTases. It would be thus relevant to initiate the structural analysis of viral MTases in complex with the best compounds in order to improve selectivity.\n\nViral N7-and 2 0 O-MTase is now considered as promising antiviral target as their inhibition is supposed to impair mRNA translation into viral proteins and to induce the stimulation of the innate immune system of the infected host. Thus it is currently accepted that MTase inhibitors might help virus clearance by stimulation of the immune response Ferron et al., 2012; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011) . In this work we identified 20 molecules inhibiting the N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 from chemical libraries composed of 2000 compounds using an HTRF based inhibition assay. Eleven compounds demonstrated a potent inhibition (>80%) at 50 mM concentration using the radioactive assay. The specificity of each compound was further evaluated using a radioactive assay on CoV 2 0 O-MTase (nsp10/nsp16) and the MTases of Dengue and West-Nile viruses as well as the human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT) involved in the capping of cellular RNAs. This comparative analysis revealed that the selected compounds cluster in 3 classes: 1) barely specific inhibitors, 2) pan-MTases inhibitors inhibiting viral and cellular MTases, 3) inhibitors targeting more specifically one viral MTase but also active against the hRNMT. These latter series of inhibitors may represent a good starting point for the development of antivirals targeting the CoV MTases."}
