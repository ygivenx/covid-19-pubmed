{"title": "New Academic Partnerships in Global Health: Innovations at Mount Sinai School of Medicine NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "Global health has become an increasingly important focus of education, research, and clinical service in North American medical schools and universities. In the past decade, academic global health programs have grown dramatically in size and number. 1 Many of these new programs are interdepartmental and university-wide in scope. Some are generously endowed. These programs have become increasingly interdisciplinary, and today they involve schools of medicine and public health as well as schools of engineering, business, law, the social sciences, theology, and international relations. In medical schools, these programs support educational offerings in global health for medical students as well as master's-level, doctoral, and postdoctoral training. A number of North American academic global health programs have developed formal partnerships with medical schools and healthcare institutions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and are engaged in joint efforts to build professional capacity in their partner countries as well as in student exchanges, provision of medical care, and collaborative research. Global health has also become a focus of intense interest at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and NIH Director Francis Collins has named improvement of global health one of his top priorities. 2 This sharp expansion in academically based global health reflects a convergence of 3 factors:\n\n\u2022 Rapidly growing student and faculty interest in global health. A 2010 survey of incoming first-year medical students at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) conducted under the auspices of the American Association of Medical Colleges found that 74% of students expressed a desire to spend at least some portion of their professional careers working in an LMIC. This represents a more than 10-fold increase in such interest from a decade earlier.\n\n\u2022 Growing societal recognition of the importance of global health. This growth has been catalyzed by a series of factors, including the global epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); the emergence and global spread of other newly recognized infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Nipah virus, and H5N1 and H1N1 influenza; global climate change 3 ; globalization of the economy; faster and cheaper travel leading to significant migration; and unprecedented growth of the world's population. 4 \u2022 Rapid growth in resources for global health. Today, as a result of these trends, there are at least 49 global health programs in academic institutions in the United States and Canada, as compared with only one in 1999. 5 A new academic society, the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH), was established in 2008 to promote, facilitate, and enhance global health as an academic field of study, with the ultimate goal of making \"the university a transforming force in global health.\" 1, 5 This article will examine evolution of the concept of global health over the past century. It will describe the driving forces that have sparked societal and academic interest in global health, trace the recent evolution of global health programs in North American universities and academic health centers, and present a blueprint for development of Mount Sinai Global Health, a new school-wide global health program at MSSM.\n\nGlobal health had its origins more than a century ago in the fields of tropical medicine and hygiene. In that phase, the discipline concerned itself largely with the infectious diseases of \"others\" in warm climates. Tropical medicine enjoyed remarkable successes such as the conquest of yellow fever, which made possible construction of the Panama Canal. In that era, the discipline was driven largely by the concerns of scientists and policy makers in developed countries.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70's, tropical medicine evolved into international health. International health grew beyond a singular focus on tropical diseases to include other infectious diseases such as smallpox, as well as maternal and child health, and immunizations.\n\nInternational health also came gradually to encompass issues beyond infectious diseases, such as nutrition (especially undernutrition), family planning, and reproductive health as well as ecological contributions to disease. International health had a strong focus on the health of populations and thus shared many of the features of public health. In this phase, the field was still driven largely by the concerns of scientists and policy makers in developed countries.\n\nGlobal health in its current iteration arose in the 1980s and 90's and came of age in the early 21st century. It encompasses all the concerns of its predecessor phases, but also incorporates disciplines beyond tropical medicine and public health such as law, engineering, clinical medicine, and the social sciences, and it emphasizes different priorities.\n\nMore than either of its predecessor phases, global health today seeks to build true partnerships between high-income and lower-income countries and institutions, while emphasizing health equity.\n\nReflecting the concerns of developing countries and new realities in patterns of disease, global health focuses increasingly on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), environmental and occupational health, health systems, and the health workforce. Thus, global health is a field of study, practice, and research that transcends borders, engages in multidisciplinary activity, and includes both population-based and clinical foci. 6\n\nAt the heart of today's major issues in global health lie a few basic driving forces. Poverty, educational inequities, population growth, urbanization, growing inadequacy in the size of the health workforce, emerging infections, global spread of the \"Western\" lifestyle, global movement of hazardous industries and toxic chemicals, and climate change are among the most important of these drivers (Table 1) .\n\nPoverty is a powerful determinant of health and disease. The relationship between poverty, ill health, and shortened life expectancy has been recognized for almost 200 years. 7 Stark economic inequities continue to plague the world today, and the richest 10% of the population now owns 85% of the world's assets, 8 \n\nEducational attainment is a second major determinant of health. The links between education and health are well established. 12 Though there has been some improvement in global primary school enrolment over the last decade, regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, remain in which nearly one-quarter of school-age children do not receive school-based education. 9\n\nPopulation growth is a third major determinant of health. World population today is 6.9 billion, including 2.2 billion children. By 2050, world population will be 9 billion. 4, 13 When population growth outstrips basic resources such as food, water, sanitation, and access to healthcare, ill health results.\n\nLack of education is a powerful driver of population growth. Education of girls and young women has repeatedly been shown to be one of the most effective means for slowing population growth and thus improving health. 14,15\n\nRapid urbanization is a fourth major determinant of health and disease. Urbanization creates new opportunities, but also carries with it significant health problems, especially in the new mega-cities of the developing world. Cities often concentrate populations in coastal areas and along tectonic fault lines, places subject to devastating natural disasters. The growth of cities often comes at the loss of prime agricultural land and may lead to water-source vulnerability. The density of city populations places communities at risk for infectiousdisease transmission and massive energy constraints. 16 In 2008 the world's urban population (3.5 billion) exceeded the rural population (3.4 billion) for the first time in recorded history. 4, 17 \n\nInadequacies in the healthcare workforce are a consequence of rapid population growth and urbanization. Massive growth in population has typically not been accompanied by a parallel growth in healthcare resources. It is not only physicians who are in short supply, but also nurses, laboratory technicians, medical officers to staff rural health clinics, community health workers, and health educators. The bulk of healthcare in LMICs is provided by nonphysicians, and it is the entire system that is weak, often made weaker by outmigration of the most highly trained personnel for economic reasons-the \"medical brain drain\" and the \"nurse drain.\" The consequence is a critically small healthcare workforce that is unable to adequately cope with the growing double burden of both communicable diseases and NCDs in the developing world. 18, 19 New Infectious Diseases\n\nNew infectious diseases such as SARS, influenza, and West Nile virus continue to emerge and have become a powerful force in global health. More than 40 infectious diseases have been newly recognized in the past 40 years. New zoonotic sources of emerging infections have been noted as well, and they underscore the importance of collaborations between human and veterinary medicine worldwide. With changes in technology and travel, new infections can now cross borders and even oceans with frightening rapidity. [20] [21] [22] Global Spread of the Western Lifestyle\n\nGlobal spread of the Western lifestyle is another powerful determinant of health and disease. 23 Chronic diseases once seen only in high-income countries are now epidemic in the LMICs. Multinational corporations target the developing world with ad campaigns, persuading young Cambodians, Bolivians, and Malawians that they must have a hamburger, a beer, and a cigarette, and centuries-old diets and traditional behavioral norms erode. Today nearly 20% of schoolchildren in China are now overweight or obese. 24 Heart disease, diabetes, and cancer have become major killers in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 25 And with >50% of the world's population now living in cities, this spread of Western diseases to the developed world will likely continue to accelerate.\n\nFinally, environmental influences are gaining greater recognition as determinants of global health.\n\nhazardous industrial processes no longer tolerated in North America or Western Europe are exported to developing countries, where populations are exposed to lead, 26 highly toxic pesticides, 27 and products made of asbestos 28 in circumstances where protective controls are weak or nonexistent. The consequences include cancer, birth defects, and sterility.\n\nClimate Change-Climate change will have ongoing influences on the spread of disease, as higher temperatures favor the wider extension of habitat for certain disease vectors. 29 Thus certain vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are expected to occupy more extensive ranges in future years than they do today. Global warming will also influence health by provoking shortages of safe drinking water. Waterborne epidemics such as cholera will result. Children will suffer disproportionately the health consequences of global climate change. 30\n\nModern global health came of age in 2005 at Boston University, where Dr. Gerald Keusch (former MSSM faculty) organized a symposium for universities interested in global health. This gathering raised many important issues and interests and raised the prospect of a potential alliance of academic programs. The concept of such an alliance was raised again at a 2007 symposium at the University of California, San Francisco, convened by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and at another planning meeting there in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, as a consequence of the foregoing conversations, the CUGH was formed. 5 The CUGH is committed to reducing health disparities worldwide, exchanging knowledge and experience in global health through true global partnerships, and working with multiple disciplines and in an interdisciplinary manner. Now with >50 members, CUGH has grown rapidly. The 2010 annual scientific meeting in Seattle had >700 participants. It is striking that a wide variety of academic institutions have global health programs-liberal arts colleges without graduate or professional schools, research universities with and without health science professional schools, and all the other variations of higher education in North America.\n\nIn 2010, MSSM created a new academic global health program: Mount Sinai Global Health. This program was designed to be school-wide in its scope, and it was placed under the direction of a newly appointed dean for Global Health who reports directly to the dean of the School of Medicine. It is guided by a Global Health Faculty Council drawn from senior leaders within the Mount Sinai Medical Center and by an external advisory council composed of leaders in global health from beyond Mount Sinai.\n\nThe mission of Mount Sinai Global Health is to enhance global health as an academic discipline within Mount Sinai and to improve the health of people around the world through partnerships in education, research, and medicine.\n\nMount Sinai Global Health has been accepted as a full member of CUGH. In September 2010 it was designated a Collaborating Centre by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nSinai's unique strengths as an independent, deeply altruistic, hospital-based academic health center in the world's most globalized city. Its operational strategy is to build upon the many programs in global health that have been created over the past decade within various departments of MSSM, the Mount Sinai Hospital, and the Mount Sinai Graduate School of Biological Sciences, and from them to create new, synergistic, value-added initiatives. Through campus-wide review of existing programs in global health, Mount Sinai Global Health has identified the following as key areas of initial focus:\n\n\u2022 Education: internal education in global health within Mount Sinai, global capacitybuilding in medicine and public health.\n\n\u2022 Research: emerging infectious diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, environmental and occupational health, cancer.\n\n\u2022 Clinical service: maternal and child health, emergency medicine, surgery (general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology [OB/GYN], ophthalmology), psychiatry, geriatrics.\n\nEducation is a key focus for Mount Sinai Global Health. The program's 2 goals in education are:\n\n\u2022 To educate all Mount Sinai students, house staff, fellows, and faculty about key issues in global health and to train future academic leaders in the field.\n\n\u2022 To build global capacity in public health and medicine in partnership with selected institutions in LMICs.\n\nTo achieve these goals, Mount Sinai Global Health builds on 2 strong education programs that have been built over the past decade:\n\n\u2022 The Mount Sinai Global Health Training Center (GHTC), which is educating the Mount Sinai community in global health and training the next generation of global health leaders.\n\n\u2022 Mount Sinai's international training programs in environmental and occupational health and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, both supported by the Fogarty International Center of NIH. These programs focus on building professional capacity in LMICs, principally in Latin America, and more recently in West Africa.\n\nSinai's GHTC-with the support of the Mulago Foundation and private donors-has been educating medical students, residents, faculty, and fellows in global health. The mission of the GHTC is to improve the health of the underserved by training leaders in global health. The operational goals are to provide all Mount Sinai students, residents, fellows, and faculty with a basic awareness of key issues in global health, and to inspire the most gifted to focus a major portion of their professional careers on issues in global health and to become future leaders in the field. To accomplish these goals, GHTC has developed a 3-tiered curriculum:\n\n\u2022 Tier One, an entry-level curriculum, is now embedded within the curriculum of MSSM and is offered to all medical students. It includes an introductory course in global health that examines such topics as the role of geography and poverty in global health, infectious and tropical diseases, the global spread of noncommunicable diseases, maternal and child health, nutrition, global climate change, and refugee health. This course is intended to give all Mount Sinai medical students an appreciation and basic working knowledge of key issues in global health.\n\n\u2022 Tier Two of the GHTC curriculum provides international training opportunities of weeks to months duration for medical students, house staff, fellows, and faculty. A key element of Tier Two is the Global Health Fieldwork Preparatory Course. This preparatory course is a mandatory prerequisite for all students and other trainees who wish to receive travel support from GHTC and for students who plan to undertake mentored research or clinical field work overseas. Its architecture and content are described in Table 2 .\n\n\u2022 Tier Three of the GHTC curriculum provides more formalized and advanced training in global health for medical students, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals through the Global Health Track in Mount Sinai's fully accredited master's in public health (MPH) program. 31 This is a 42-credit, degreegranting program includes courses in maternal and child health, underserved populations, refugee health and human rights, humanitarian emergencies, and global environmental change.\n\nThe GHTC has sent trainees at all levels to work with partners in developing nations on research projects and public health programs, such as devising strategies for malaria control in rural Tanzania, studying the health impacts of water privatization in Bolivia, creating community health curricula for Native American students in North Dakota, and assessing the health of women and children in the Char islands of Bangladesh.\n\nThe GHTC has been a catalyst for sparking interest in global health throughout MSSM and across the Mount Sinai Medical Center.\n\nGlobal Health Training Center Response to the Haiti Earthquake: The Mount Sinai GHTC responded to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti with an outpouring of support and service. Just 8 days after the quake, the institution mobilized a team of 27 health professionals to deliver care as part of a service mission coordinated by Partners in Health. 32 After this initial response, there was strong and ongoing interest in continuing service opportunities to relieve the suffering of the Haitian people. Recognizing the need to provide meaningful and effective service in a way commensurate with the specific skills and abilities of volunteer personnel, faculty from the Mount Sinai GHTC took on a leadership role in coordinating continuing relief efforts. Rather than developing a new service-delivery model in a chaotic and unfamiliar environment, Global Health faculty sought a partner with longterm experience on the ground that could accept volunteers and integrate them into a system of care. This partner was found in Project Medishare, 33 an organization based at the University of Miami that has been delivering service to Haiti since 1995. Because of its connection with the Haitian people and its proximity to the country, Project Medishare were able to open a tent hospital the day after the earthquake. They have operated this facility in one form or another ever since. Mount Sinai has already sent 2 large teams of volunteers to help staff Medishare's hospital and plans to continue recruiting volunteers for future missions. \u2022 The Recovery Act Supplement to the ITREOH program is funded by the Fogarty International Center and is intended to provide support for developing distancelearning tools and materials that enhance Mount Sinai's current programs in global health.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 Mount Sinai Global Health is building interdisciplinary research capacity in HIV/ AIDS in Cameroon in collaboration with strong new partners, notably the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board. In Cameroon, the Fogarty AITRP will be used as a model to guide the development of training pipelines for midlevel healthcare workers, particularly among those who are already heavily involved in community health development and mental health. This is an example of south-tosouth collaboration.\n\nTranslational research that seeks to generate novel discoveries that translate into strategic blueprints for improving health and preventing disease worldwide is a key component of Mount Sinai Global Health. This research builds on robust research programs in global health already in place at Mount Sinai described in the paragraphs below. Brief applications for funding will be solicited. These applications will be reviewed by the dean for Global Health and members of the Global Health faculty council. The most meritorious will be selected for funding. Progress will be tracked closely through an annual reporting requirement. All publications, presentations, programs, and grants generated through the program will be tallied as return on investment.\n\nKey Research Programs-The following paragraphs describe key research programs in global health already in place at Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai Global health is building upon and creating synergies among these programs. These global studies on infectious diseases are complemented with strong research programs on antivirals and vaccines aimed at diminishing the burden of viral diseases around the world. 36 Cardiovascular Disease, Obesity, and Diabetes: Heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke are all on the rise in developing countries, where rapidly increasing urbanization and Western eating habits have supplanted traditional rural life and fish-and-vegetable-based diets. [23] [24] [25] Mount Sinai Global Health, in partnership with Mount Sinai's Cardiovascular Disease Institute, is leading a multipronged campaign to combat these trends. This campaign includes:\n\n\u2022 Plaza S\u00e9samo, an educational television project involving 6000 Colombian children aged 3-7 years that uses the Spanish-language version of Sesame Street to teach the importance of good health in developing both preventive and treatment strategies to curb the spread of cardiovascular and related illnesses.\n\n\u2022 The Grenada Heart Project, a prospective epidemiologic study in partnership with the World Heart Federation tracking the emergence of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes as well as risk factors for these diseases in this rapidly developing Caribbean nation with the goal of devising effective strategies for disease prevention. 37\n\n\u2022 The PolyPill Study, devising new single-pill strategies that combine multiple cardiac medications into a single pill for ease of administration in LMICs to promote secondary prevention of heart disease and stroke. 38\n\nSinai Global health is deeply involved in efforts to study and prevent disease of toxic environmental origin in countries around the world. [26] [27] [28] This work focuses on diseases of workers and also on chronic disease of environmental origin in children. Children are highly vulnerable to disease of toxic environmental origin because they have proportionately heavier exposures to chemicals in the environment compared with adults. 39 Also, children are highly sensitive to the toxic chemicals they encounter in the environment.\n\nCancer: Like cardiovascular disease, cancer has sharply increased in the developing worldagain, due to urbanization and the rise in Western-style behaviors such as smoking and increased alcohol consumption. Mount Sinai Global Health, in partnership with Mount Sinai's Institute for Translational Epidemiology and the Tisch Cancer Institute, will spearhead efforts to study and combat this devastating and often fatal illness.\n\nMount Sinai Global Health continues and builds upon Mount Sinai's long and proud tradition of providing medical and surgical care in LMICs where need is great and resources few. We do this in partnership with the WHO, country governments, and charitable organizations in a manner that respects local knowledge and traditions, fosters long-term partnerships with Mount Sinai, and educates local doctors so that they are empowered to build professional capacity in their countries. The following are areas of particular clinical focus.\n\nHarlem based on the recognition that concepts of global health apply also to Mount Sinai's own neighboring, often underserved communities. The first project was a community-based school clinic created in partnership with the Children's Aid Society that addressed the medical needs as well as the emotional health and dental health of East Harlem children.\n\nThe GHTC staff have also been involved in international research and public-health projects dealing with pediatric lead poisoning in Uganda; pediatric nutrition in Sri Lanka; adolescent anemia and newborn mortality in India; HIV peer education in rural Tanzania and Uganda; neonatal care, malnutrition, pediatric HIV, and pediatric clinical training in Liberia; prevalence and prevention of STDs and sexual-health education for health workers in Bangladesh; metabolic complications in HIV-infected pregnant women and their children; kidney disease in HIV-infected adults in Africa; 40 developmental assessment evaluation of social barriers to care of HIV+ orphans in Vietnam and Ethiopia, and the training of community health workers to prevent childhood mortality from malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea in Mozambique.\n\nSinai Medical Center's Emergency Medicine Department is involved in efforts to build global partnerships in Liberia, Mozambique, and Haiti and is also undertaking global health work within New York City.\n\n\u2022 In Liberia, Mount Sinai Emergency Medicine has forged a unique interinstitutional partnership with other US academic emergency medicine programs to provide nearcontinuous on-site supervision and teaching of trainees in Liberia's only tertiary care and trauma emergency department. This collaboration has provided a muchneeded clinical service and health-worker training in a country currently in the postconflict reconstruction phase of development.\n\n\u2022 In Mozambique, Mount Sinai Emergency Medicine has worked to build a program of training community health workers surrounding Gorongosa National Park, an area where the survival of the national park is intimately tied to the health of the adjoining communities.\n\n\u2022 In Haiti, Mount Sinai Emergency Medicine deployed a team of nearly 30 doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals to deliver lifesaving emergency care to victims of the devastating January 2010 earthquake. provided resources to combat maternal mortality, increased contraceptive delivery for women without access, and corrected fistulas in women who were destined to lifetimes of exile and ostracism.\n\nTo prepare OB/GYN residents for the challenges of global health delivery, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology has a Global Women's Health course required of all resident volunteers who wish to serve internationally. This course focuses on the biological, environmental, and societal pressures that affect women's health, pregnancy outcomes, reproductive health, and long-term survival. Topics include reproductive and obstetric health, women's rights, gender-based violence, family planning and contraception, female circumcision, obstetric fistula, maternal mortality, and the ethical and societal challenges influencing women's health outcomes. To further enhance academic collaboration, this course is offered annually to residents in all of the New York City-based residency program in obstetrics and gynecology.\n\nTo serve local underserved communities in New York City, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology has been implementing an Obesity and Pregnancy Intervention Program that educates and motivates obese, pregnant patients to achieve healthy weight gain in pregnancy. This program targets the vulnerable populations of women in East Harlem and the Bronx. It has achieved much success over the last 3 years, with >60 obese women enrolled in the program able to successfully minimize weight gain in pregnancy.\n\nSinai's Global Health faculty, students, and residents partner with Virtue Foundation, Surgical Eye Expeditions, and other organizations to provide vital eye care to underserved patients as well as clinical training to local staff and physicians in developing countries across the globe such as Liberia, Tonga, and Cambodia. In addition, during the past 2 years, Mount Sinai medical faculty, students, and residents have performed several hundred ocular and oculoplastic procedures during teaching surgical missions at the First Hospital of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. In addition to surgical procedures, the local health department organized several city-wide didactic sessions.\n\nThe surgical team was struck by Mongolia's lack of basic medical equipment and infrastructure and the need for advanced surgical care. With the assistance and coordination of Mount Sinai medical-student volunteers, the team responded by procuring nearly $50,000 of medical and surgical equipment to support local staff and provide necessary medical care in the country. A multidisciplinary team in partnership with Virtue Foundation plans to return to Mongolia in May 2011 to continue teaching and training local physicians and healthcare providers and to meet with high-level officials to establish long-term, highimpact, evidence-based, sustainable solutions toward advancing global health.\n\nFinally, in 2011, Mount Sinai also plans to partner with Virtue Foundation to provide longterm development and training in El Salvador and Ghana.\n\nSinai's Department of Psychiatry has developed substantial expertise in global mental health, focusing on post-trauma care for survivors of natural and manmade disasters as well as for torture survivors and refugees. The department has also begun to become involved in the development of mental-health systems in underserved regions.\n\nGlobal Geriatric Medicine-Although many are aware that the developed world is aging rapidly, it is underappreciated that the developing world is aging even more rapidly. Within <10 years, for the first time ever, the world's population aged \u226565 years will be greater than the population aged <5 years. 41 Projections indicate that by 2050 there will be >2 billion people older than 60 in the world, 80% of whom will reside in the developing world. Additionally, the percentage of chronic NCDs (compared with communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions) in LMICs is dramatically increasing as their populations age. 42 Global health challenges are too great and too urgent to be left to scattershot attempts at solutions. Every day, immigrants, tourists, and business travelers traverse the globe, some unknowingly carrying communicable diseases and passing them to others. Every week, understaffed city hospitals and village clinics in Africa, Asia, and Latin America-already battling AIDS, malaria, and pneumonia-must also cope with a rise in lung cancer and heart disease. Every month, pesticides and herbicides banned in the United States and Europe are sprayed on plants, trees, and flowers in Third World countries, putting the health of both workers and consumers at risk.\n\nThe purpose of Mount Sinai Global Health is to forcefully address these challenges with a sustained, coordinated, across-the-board plan of action encompassing education, research, and clinical practice that builds on Mount Sinai's unique strengths. By unifying the wide range of global health activities at Mount Sinai under one roof, combining innovative thinking with intellectual rigor, making maximum use of both human and technological resources, and giving equal weight to the demands of the present and the predicted needs of the future, we hope to create a successful model for global health programs around the world that can be sustained for years to come.
