{"title": "Viral Infections and the Development of Disinfection: 100 Years of Progress at I&ECR", "body": "H eadlines worldwide these last several months have been filled with references to COVID-19, the illness resulting from infection with a new strain of coronavirus. Efforts by health officials to control the spread of the virus have led to quarantines and cancellations of large gatherings including sporting events in locations where infections are known to have occurred. Scientific life also is affected with the American Physical Society, World Petrochemical Conference, ACS, and AIChE among those canceling or postponing their recent annual spring conferences. 1 Some local meetings and the recently concluded Pittsburgh Analytical Conference (Pittcon) were held, but with fewer attendees than expected due to travel restrictions and personal and organizational decisions to avoid large gatherings. 2 We remember that about 100 years ago, at the end of the first world war, a virulent strain of influenza virus raced around the world, causing the death of an estimated 30 million people\ue0d5more than were killed in the war itself. At that time, life was different because the war had significantly decreased economic productivity, disinfectants were largely unknown or underutilized, and the only known pain medication was aspirin.\n\nBy 1920, scientific reports began to appear in journals including I&ECR about significantly lower influenza sickness rates near chlorine facilities. Initial reports from the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland\ue0d5where the United States had been producing Cl 2 as a chemical weapon for use in the war\ue0d5were quickly confirmed at other locations where chlorine was used, such as in textile and paper manufacture. 3,4 In one case, at a plant where 15% of the workforce was infected, no cases occurred in workers in the chlorine or bleach (sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl) portion of the factory. In another factory where 75% of the workforce was infected, only one death occurred, and few serious cases were observed. While these observations should raise significant questions about chemical hygiene and fugitive emissions at the plants, this was a time when scientists often carried out experiments on themselves or people they knew and some level of exposure to chemicals was tolerated. 5, 6 When combined with prior discoveries, 7 these observations from industry helped propel the case for chlorine-based disinfection and led to widespread implementation of water chlorination processes with significant reductions in mortality rates. 8, 9 Additional rapid research and technological discoveries led to new preparation methods for NaOCl, 10 and the commercial production of chlorine containing solutions as disinfectants. 11 Subsequent improvements included advanced electrolytic cells for chlorine production, 12 and production of disinfectant and bactericide N-chloramines with fewer drawbacks than Cl 2 . 13, 14 Throughout, process safety has continually increased with time. 15, 16 Research in the field continues today, but with highly sophisticated tools, such that studies of the interaction of Cl 2 with viruses can detail penetration through lipid membranes and reaction with protein cores. 17 We also understand how to synthesize materials incorporating N-chloroamines into polymers to prepare materials with multiple beneficial properties. 18, 19 While we do not yet know what discoveries will come from the many ongoing investigations related to SARS-CoV-2, 20 one constant has remained fixed during a century of progress. \n\n(1) Coronavirus Cancels Chemical Events.
