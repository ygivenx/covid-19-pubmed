{"title": "Cancer Prevalence and Etiology in Wild and Captive Animals", "body": "Despite the evolution of numerous natural cancer suppressor mechanisms (DeGregori, 2011), neoplasia has been recorded in most metazoans (Leroi et al., 2003) . Although, a few exceptional species, such as the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) and sharks have been claimed to be resistant to cancer (Finkelstein, 2005; Tian et al., 2013) . Recent studies have, however, shown that even these species may develop cancer (Delaney et al., 2016; Finkelstein, 2005) strongly suggesting that the vast majority of multicellular organisms are indeed susceptible to cancer. The frequent occurrence of cancer in metazoans suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild (Vittecoq et al., 2013) . This is supported by a recent review of wildlife cancer by McAloose and Newton (2009) demonstrating that high prevalence of cancer in, for example, Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) resulted in concomitant significant increase in levels of mortality and reduction in fitness.\n\nWildlife cancer statistics are, however, highly scattered in the scientific literature and hence challenging to access. Moreover, tumors in wildlife are most commonly detected during postmortem examination and therefore hard to confirm without histopathological examinations. However, even such analyses can be inaccurate because of high levels of autolysis (organ disintegration) (McAloose and Newton, 2009 ). In addition, individuals harboring tumors often display a decrease in body condition frequently resulting in higher levels of parasite/pathogen infections and concomitant increased levels in morbidity and mortality (Vittecoq et al., 2013) further impeding a correct analysis of the ultimate cause of death. The combination of the negative effects of cancer and/or pathogen/parasite infections has also been shown to result in increased levels of predation (Vittecoq et al., 2013) . In our view, the combination of the problems involved in accurately recording wildlife cancer, the increased risk of succumbing to pathogens/ parasites, and/or predation has often led to a somewhat erroneous assumption that although cancer is common in domestic animals, it remains rare in the wild. If, as we suggest, cancer may be a significant determinant of animal fitness it is therefore crucial to determine cancer prevalence in the wild.\n\nThe etiology and prevalence of transmissible cancers are presented and discussed in Chapter 12; this chapter will therefore focus on the prevalence and etiology of nontransmissible cancers.\n\nVia thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence in wild animals ranging from fish to whales. We also provide a list of cancer recorded in captive animals from French zoological parks and compare our findings to that recorded at other zoological parks. Finally we provide an updated list of cancers recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals demonstrating that cancer occurs in nearly every taxonomic order of the animal kingdom.\n\nAlthough cancers are frequently encountered in wild animals (see Table 2 .1 starting on page 13), we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence in 31 wild vertebrate species (Table 2. 2). We were unable to find information on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in wild invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates ranging from fish to mammals. In following sections, we provide a summary of cancer etiology and prevalence in each of the five vertebrate groups (Table 2 .2).\n\nFish FAO (2010) fisheries and aquaculture department published a report showing that the mean contribution of fish to global diets was 17 kg per person/year, supplying over three billion people with 15% of their animal protein intake. About 45% of the fish consumed were farmed but the remaining 55% of fish were caught in the wild clearly demonstrating the importance of wild fish in the human diet. In spite of their importance to humans we have only been able to find information on cancer prevalence in 12 wild fish taxa.\n\nIn walleye (Sander vitreus) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) retroviruses have been found to initiate cancer development (Coffee et al., 2013) . In bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) neurofibromatosis-like tumors are most likely caused by an \"extrachromosomal DNA virus-like agent\" (Coffee et al., 2013) whereas in European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) cancer development have been suggested to be caused by a \"herpesvirus-like agent\" (Coffee et al., 2013) . In northern pike (Esox lucius) a corona virus has been suggested to be the cause for the development of lymphosarcoma (Papas et al., 1976 ). This species also shows substantial seasonal variation in lymphosarcoma prevalence but the underlying etiology is unknown (Papas et al., 1976) . In brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), however, the higher levels of liver neoplasms (15%) recorded on one of the lakes investigated have been suggested to be caused by pollution (Baumann et al., 2008) . Similarly, a study of English sole (Parophrys vetulus) revealed that up to 24% of the fish had developed liver neoplasms of which etiology could be traced to have been caused by pollution/chemical carcinogens (Malins et al., 1987) .\n\nCancer prevalence as high as 20% have been observed in several species, such as gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), northern pike, walleye, bicolor damselfish and in white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) cancer may affect up to 59% of the fish (Coffee et al., 2013) . However, the epidermal papilloma recorded in the latter taxon appears to result in low mortality (Coffee et al., 2013) . In contrast, cancers, such as plasmacytoid leukemia have been shown to result in up to 50% mortality in commercially important taxa, such as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Eaton et al., 1994) and neurofibromatosislike tumors have been shown to result in 100% mortality in bicolor damselfish (Coffee et al., 2013) . Apart from the latter two studies, the remaining studies do not provide any data on the effect of cancer on fish mortality. In spite of this we find it reasonable to suggest that the high tumor frequency observed in several species may have a significant negative impact on fish fitness. Given the importance of fish in the human diet the high cancer prevalence and associated mortality recorded in some fish taxa, clearly demonstrate the need of a substantial increase in research on the effect of cancer on both marine and freshwater fish.\n\nAlthough cancer has been reported in numerous amphibians (Balls and Clothier, 1974) we have only been able to find three studies that incorporated data on cancer prevalence in the wild. In the North American leopard frog (Rana pipiens) McKinnel (1965) found that \n\nCommon name\n\nParalithodes platypus Blue king crab Anaplastic cells on the surface of the antennal gland, probable tegmental gland adenocarcinoma Morado et al.

(2016) up to 9% of the frogs were diagnosed with renal adenocarcinoma in 1965. However, no information about tumor etiology or its possible effects on the frogs was provided. Interestingly, in a later study McKinnell and Martin (1979) observed a gradual temporal decline in tumor prevalence and in 1978 no tumors were observed in 1216 dissected frogs. McKinnell and Martin (1979) suggested that the decline in cancer prevalence was caused by a significant reduction in frog numbers and a concomitant reduction in the release of oncogenic viruses into the breeding ponds. However, the authors could not rule out that a gradual reduction of carcinogenic pollutants into the breeding ponds could have caused the decline in tumor prevalence. Asashima et al. (1982) studied the occurrence of spontaneous skin papillomas in Japanese newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) in northern Japan. The prevalence of papillomas showed a seasonal variation, being highest in autumn, ranging from 1.93% to 5.45%, whereas during the rest of the year the prevalence ranged between 0.16% and 0.50%. A spatial difference in cancer prevalence was also recorded with newts collected from the northern, seaside prefectures having higher papilloma rates (1.00-5.45%) than newts from the southern, Pacific Ocean prefectures (0-0.27%). No intersexual differences in tumor prevalence were recorded. Virus-like bodies, resembling herpestype virus, were found in the cytoplasm of the epitheliomas, suggesting that tumor may have been caused by a viral agent. Unfortunately the study does not provide any information of the underpinning(s) of the temporal and spatial variation in tumor prevalence or whether the tumors affected newt mortality.\n\nIn a recent study skin tumor prevalence was investigated in the Montseny brook newt (Calotriton arnoldi) in Spain (Martinez-Silvestre et al., 2011) . The range of this taxon is restricted to a small geographic area <40 km 2 of the North Eastern Iberian Peninsula. Similar to the Japanese newt a profound spatial population difference in tumor prevalence was observed ranging from 0%, 2% to 29%. The tumors were only observed in adult newts, which led the authors to suggest that the tumors may be caused by increased UV-B exposure. Yet again no data are provided on whether the tumors may affect newt mortality.\n\nAlthough our sample is small, it shows that cancer prevalence may affect a substantial proportion of wild amphibians. Considering the dramatic decline in amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Daszak et al., 1999) makes it even more important to further investigate the possible negative effects of cancer in this group of vertebrates.\n\nThe only reptile taxa for which we have been able to retrieve data on cancer prevalence in the wild are restricted to marine turtles. Although fibropapillomatosis (FP) mainly affects green turtles (Chelonia mydas) it has also been documented in loggerheads (Caretta caretta; Aguirre et al., 1999b) . Green turtles have been subjected to numerous and extensive research projects and here we summarize the major findings from some of these studies. FP in green turtles results in tumor growth on eyes, oral cavity, skin, carapace, plastron, and/or internal organs . Consequently the disease may significantly reduce turtle foraging efficiency. FP shows significant geographic variation not only in prevalence (ranging from 0% to 92%) but also in severity . Moreover, in Brazil the disease is absent in juvenile green turtles but increases in prevalence in older turtles . In contrast in Hawaii, FP affects mainly juvenile turtles (Balazs and Pooley, 1990; Work and Balazs, 1999) . However, the reason(s) for the agespecific increase in FP prevalence in Brazil and the agespecific difference in cancer development in Brazil and Hawaii is unknown. Interestingly, Chaloupka et al. (2009) reported on cases where FP had regressed and even completely disappeared in some individual green turtles in Hawaii, and that the diseases since the mid-1990s has showed a significant decline in prevalence.\n\nAlthough we have not been able to find data on how FP affects green turtle mortality rates, the disease results in high parasite load, immune suppression, increased physiological cost (Work and Balazs, 1999; Work et al., 2001 Work et al., , 2005 and is the most common cause of green turtle stranding on Hawaii (Chaloupka et al., 2008 (Chaloupka et al., , 2009 ). Consequently, we find it highly likely that FP may impose considerable mortality cost on green turtles in the wild. In spite of FP's high prevalence in some areas and its possible severe effects on green turtle fitness the etiology of FP is still not known. Some studies have found an association between herpesviruses and FP (Greenblatt et al., 2005) , whereas others have implicated that pollution and habitat quality may be major factors explaining the presence of FP (Herbst and Klein, 1995) .\n\nThe detrimental impact of cancer on marine turtles and the emergence of a novel fungal disease in squamate reptiles (Guthrie et al., 2015) warrant increased research efforts to investigate how cancer might affect the demography of reptiles in the wild.\n\nWe find it remarkable that although birds are often abundant in both urban and rural habitats we have only been able to find a handful of studies that have recorded cancer prevalence in wild birds. Jennings (1968) estimated the prevalence of neoplasia in wild birds in Great Britain to be between 0.1% and 1.0%. Similar low cancer prevalence was recorded by Gates et al. (1992) in Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior; 2 out of 1272 birds, 0.2%). Both birds were young and emaciated and microscopical analyses suggested that the tumors \"had the typical appearance of spindle cell sarcomas\" (Gates et al., 1992) . Similar results on low cancer prevalence in wild birds were published by Siegfried (1983) who found tumors in only 9 out of more than 18,000 birds examined (0.05%). Although based on a significantly smaller sample size, 3 out of 13 (23%) ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) were diagnosed having tumors (Howerth et al., 1986) . One bird was diagnosed with a lipoma, the second bird a fibroma, while the third bird had developed a renal carcinoma metastatic to the liver (Howerth et al., 1986) . The high prevalence recorded in ruffed grouse should, however, be interpreted with caution as all three birds were delivered for examination because they all suffered from obvious lesions. Reece (1992) reported 383 cases of cancer from a collection of more than 10,000 birds (3.8%) submitted for necroscopy in Victoria, Australia from 1977 to 1987. As the birds examined included both wild and captive birds and no data are provided on the number of birds in each of the two groups, again the data on cancer prevalence should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThe only publication we have found showing that cancer prevalence in birds may reach similar levels as that found among other vertebrates is a study by Daoust et al. (1991) who reported that out of 30 wild white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) killed by hunters 7 (23%) were diagnosed as having developed multicentric mesenchymal tumors. Daoust et al. (1991) suggested that the high prevalence could have been caused by \"a genetically influenced susceptibility to the disease.\" Unfortunately, however, no data are provided to support this statement.\n\nIn their review of wildlife cancer McAloose and Newton (2009) listed the endangered North American Attwater's prairie chicken (Tympanicus cupido attwateri) as an example of a species being further threatened by extinction due to cancer. Although reticuloendotheliosis virus may infect up to 50% of the captive birds, we have not been able to find any publication that relate this high infection level to mortality in the wild.\n\nThe few publications that we have been able to retrieve suggest that cancer prevalence in birds in general appears to be low. Although the sample size in some of the studies were very high, they were often restricted to large-bodied and long-lived species, such as geese. In order to make any robust generalization of cancer prevalence among wild birds, future research should incorporate birds representing a significantly more diverse taxonomic range.\n\nCancer prevalence and its effect on some wild mammal population, such as California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) have been subjected to intensive research (Gulland et al., 1996; Martineau et al., 2002) . Between 1979 and 1994 the prevalence of a metastatic carcinoma of urogenital origin in stranded California sea lions was reported to be 18% (Gulland et al., 1996) . However, between 1998 and 2012 the prevalence of this cancer increased to 26% (Browning et al., 2015) . This metastatic carcinoma appears to result in 100% mortality as all animals died during rehabilitation (Gulland et al., 1996) . The actual prevalence of this cancer is most likely lower as only sick animals are likely to strand, but despite this the cancer represents a significant cause of death (Browning et al., 2015) . Recent studies have found that the etiology of the cancer is associated with individual genotype, persistent organic pollutants, and/or a herpesvirus (Browning et al., 2015) . Similar high cancer prevalence has been recorded in an isolated beluga population living in the St. Lawrence estuary (Martineau et al., 2002) . Although the primary causes of death were respiratory and gastrointestinal infections with metazoan parasites, observed in 22% of the belugas, cancer was the second most common cause of death across all age groups and observed in 18% of the stranded belugas (Martineau et al., 2002) . Cancer prevalence in adults was even higher (27%) and Martineau et al. (2002) estimated the annual rate of all cancer types in belugas to 163 out of 100,000 animals, a rate significantly higher than that reported for any other cetacean populations and similar to that of recorded in humans. Beluga habitat in the St. Lawrence estuary is highly contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by the local aluminum smelters, strongly suggesting that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a major cause of the high cancer prevalence recorded in this population (Martineau et al., 2002) .\n\nHigh cancer prevalence has also been recorded in other marine mammals, such as Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) and Baltic gray seal (Halichoerus grypus). In the former, 18 neoplasms were found during examination of tissues collected from 107 carcasses (17%) from Alaskan subsistence hunting over a 10-year period (Fleetwood et al., 2005) . However, no data regarding cancer etiology or pathogenesis of the walrus examined are presented. Between 1975 and 1997, 53 female Baltic gray seals aged between 15 and 40 years were found dead along the Baltic coast of Sweden, of which 34 (64%) where diagnosed having developed uterine leiomyomas (B\u00e4cklin et al., 2003) . Although little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of leiomyoma in Baltic gray seals, B\u00e4cklin et al. (2003) tentatively suggested an association between cancer prevalence and pollutants, such as organochlorines. However, as mentioned earlier, the actual prevalence of uterine leiomyomas in female Baltic gray seals is most likely lower as only sick animals are likely to strand. Regardless, similar to the California sea lion, this cancer may constitute a significant cause of mortality in this species.\n\nIn contrast to the four marine species mentioned previously, neoplasia in northern sea otters (Enhydra lutris) appears to be rare and Williams and Pulley (1981) only found tumors in 2 females out of 112 otters examined (1.8%). Similar to the female Baltic gray seals, tumors of the female otters were diagnosed as uterine leiomyomas (Williams and Pulley, 1981) .\n\nOur review of the literature also revealed significant geographical species-specific difference in cancer prevalence. For example, of 42 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) carcasses examined in Hungary, 14 (33%) showed macrosopic lesions consistent with skin FP (Erd\u00e9lyi et al., 2009) , whereas out of 985 carcasses examined in Sweden only 19 were diagnosed having neoplasia (2%) and only 1 of the 19 having developed FP (Aguirre et al., 1999a) . Moreover, within the Hungarian study neoplasia was confined to certain geographical areas (Erd\u00e9lyi et al. 2009 ). As FP is caused by the infection of papillomavirus (CcPV1) this led Erd\u00e9lyi et al. (2009) to suggest that genetic factors may underpin roe deer susceptibility to FP.\n\nIn humans increased cancer prevalence has shown to be associated with reduced genetic diversity (Assi\u00e9 et al., 2008; Rudan et al., 2003) . It is therefore interesting to note that some of the highest cancer prevalence's observed in wild mammals (>50%) have been recorded in species/populations with low genetic diversity, such as the Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae; Funk et al., 2016; Vickers et al., 2015) and the South African Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra; Marais and Page, 2011; Marais et al., 2007; Sasidharan et al., 2011) . Vickers et al. (2015) suggested that the high prevalence of ceruminous gland tumors (carcinomas and adenomas) observed in the Santa Catalina Island foxes may have a genetic basis. Similarly, the high cancer prevalence observed in one of the South African Cape mountain zebra populations has also been suggested to be associated with concomitant low genetic diversity (Marais et al., 2007; Sasidharan et al., 2011) . Interestingly, as mentioned earlier, the high prevalence of cancer in California sea lions may also, at least partly, have a genetic basis (Browning et al., 2015) . The possible association between reduced genetic diversity and cancer prevalence is further supported by the high prevalence of cancer observed in both captive and wild western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville), a highly endangered Australian marsupial once widespread across western and southern Australia but now restricted to two small islands off the Western Australian coast (Woolford et al., 2008 (Woolford et al., , 2009 . Captive breeding of this species has been severely hampered by debilitating cutaneous and mucocutaneous papillomatosis and carcinomatosis, associated with infection of papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV1) (Woolford et al., 2008 (Woolford et al., , 2009 .\n\nLow genetic diversity in the wild has been found to result in increased risk of inbreeding depression and concomitant increased risk of extinctions (Madsen et al., 1996 (Madsen et al., , 1999 (Madsen et al., , 2004 . If low genetic diversity results in an increased risk of cancer, as suggested by the examples mentioned previously, this may further imperil the longterm survival of the numerous wild organisms presently suffering from low genetic diversity.\n\nAlthough conditions (and hence associated cancer risks) in zoological parks are often significantly different from those experienced in nature (e.g., altered levels of activity and food and abnormal breeding frequency; Vittecoq et al., 2013) , cancer studies in captive animals are facilitated by the absence of masking variables, such as predation. In addition, because of curative and preventive improvements in veterinary medicine, diseases of captive animals are closely monitored and routine necropsies are performed using microscopy analysis (Hubbard et al., 1983; Lombard and Witte, 1959) .\n\nThe study was conducted from September 2013 to February 2015. Thirty zoological parks were contacted through a partnership with two French animal histopathology laboratories (ONIRIS in Nantes, VetDiagnostic in Lyon) and the French Association of Zoological Park Veterinarians (AFVPZ). Data collection consisted of (1) consultation of veterinarian archives in the zoological parks and (2) analysis of centralized data by veterinarian histopathology laboratories.\n\nAs accurate cancer diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of samples from biopsies, resection, or autopsy/necropsy (Martineau et al., 2002) , we therefore only entered tumor type (benign or malignant) into our database when they had been confirmed by histological analyses. We also recorded the organs affected, and, if any, the presence and the location of metastases. In order to facilitate data presentation, we classified the tumors into 12 anatomical systems.\n\nThe database consisted of 343 tumor references, including 271 cases of cancer in mammals, 46 in birds, and 26 in reptiles representing 27 different orders (Table 2. 3).\n\nThe tumor frequencies observed in the three vertebrate classes revealed remarkable similarities. High frequencies of digestive (18.4-34.8%), hematopoietic (17.6-27.9%), and skin tumors (14.2-18.6%) were observed in mammals, birds, and reptiles whereas tumors in the remaining 9 anatomical systems occurred in similar low frequencies (0-9.5%; Table 2 .4).\n\nThe prevalence of malignant tumors differed among taxa (\u03c7 2 = 8.68, df = 2, P = 0.01; Table 2 .5) and posthoc tests revealed that reptiles had a higher prevalence of malignant tumors than mammals (P = 0.018), while no significant difference in prevalence of malignant tumors were observed between mammals and birds and reptiles and birds (P > 0.17). Accipitriformes (e.g., birds of prey) 2 Afrosoricida (e.g., tenrecs and golden moles) 2\n\nAnseriformes (e.g., ducks and geese) 5 Carnivora (e.g., cats and wolves) 114\n\nBucerotiformes (e.g., hornbills and hoopoes) 3 Cetartiodactyla (e.g., pigs and deer) 49\n\nCiconiiformes (e.g., storks) 1 Chiroptera (e.g., bats and flying foxes) 4\n\nColumbiformes (e.g., pigeons and doves) 3 Cingulata (e.g., armadillos) 2\n\nGalliformes (e.g., turkeys and chickens) 2 Diprotodontia (e.g., kangaroos and koalas) 7\n\nGruiformes (e.g., cranes, coots, and rails) 1 Lagomorpha (e.g., hares and rabbits) 1\n\nPelecaniformes (e.g., pelicans and cormorants) 8 Perissodactyla (e.g., zebras and rhinoceros) 14\n\nPhoenicopteriformes (e.g., flamingos) 2 Pilosa (e.g., anteaters) 2\n\nPsittaciformes (e.g., parrots and parakeets) 10 Primates (e.g., monkeys and apes) 70\n\nRheiformes (e.g., rhea) 2 Rodentia (e.g., rats and capybaras) 6\n\nSphenisciformes (e.g., penguins) 3\n\nStrigiformes (e.g., owls) 4\n\nOrder n\n\nCrocodilia (e.g., crocodiles and alligators) 1\n\nSquamata (e.g., snakes and lizards) 23\n\nTestudines (e.g., turtles and tortoises) 2\n\nThe results from the present study show that the highest tumor prevalence was observed in the carnivores (42.1%, 114 of 271). Similar high cancer prevalence in this group of mammals was observed by Lombard and Witte (1959) and Effron et al. (1977) . Carnivores include both domestic cats and domestic dogs, of which both have been shown to be subjected to high prevalence of tumors (Merlo et al., 2008; Zambelli, 2015) . However, we have not been able to find any information explaining the high prevalence in these two groups of mammals. Our results also revealed similar levels of cancer prevalence in mammal digestive system (18.4%) to that recorded by Lombard and Witte (1959) (20%) . Moreover, the second most common tumors observed in mammals by Effron et al. (1977) was hematopoietic/ lymphosarcoma (8.9%) followed by skin tumors (8.7%). Our results thus again show a remarkable similarity with the results obtained by Effron et al. (1977) as we also found hematopoietic and skin tumors being the second and third most common tumors recorded (17.6 and 14.2%, respectively).\n\nIn contrast Lombard and Witte (1959) found that the second most prevalent tumors were confined to the endocrine system (18.4%) whereas in our study endocrine tumors were only found in 7.9% of mammals. Both Effron et al. (1977) and Lombard and Witte (1959) found that pulmonary tumors were the most prevalent cancer recorded (14 and 16%, respectively) whereas in our study pulmonary tumors were only found in 6.4% of the animal investigated that is, the 7th of the 12 anatomical systems.\n\nComparing our results of tumor prevalence in birds with those obtained by Effron et al. (1977) again revealed some striking similarities. In both studies hematopoietic/lymphosarcoma were the most prevalent tumors recorded (27.9 and 32.4%, respectively). In the studies by both Effron et al. (1977) and Lombard and Witte (1959) , as well as in our study the second most prevalent cancers were confined to the gastric/ digestive system (20.9, 22.2, and 12.6%, respectively). In all three studies the third most prevalent tumors were fibrosarcoma/skin tumors (18.6, 11.1, and 9.9%, respectively). In contrast the second most common tumors recorded by Lombard and Witte (1959) were confined to genital system (20.2%) whereas these tumors were the fourth most common tumors recorded by Effron et al. (1977) (9.9%) and the sixth most common tumors in our study (4.6%).\n\nThe most common cancers recorded by Effron et al. (1977) in reptiles were lymphosarcoma (25%) followed by tumors in the intrahepatic biliary/digestive system (21%). Again our results are quite similar to that recorded by Effron et al. (1977) although the order of the two cancer types was reversed, that is, our results showed a highest prevalence in the digestive system (34.8%) followed by the hematopoietic system (21.7%).\n\nThe high prevalence of cancers observed in our study affecting the digestive, hematopoietic, and skin systems recorded across the three vertebrate classes is remarkable and certainly warrants further studies to investigate whether these high prevalences also occur at other zoological parks. As these animals are kept under quite different conditions, that is, most mammals and birds are kept in outdoor cages whereas reptiles are mostly kept indoors we presently have no explanation for the similarities in tumor prevalences among these three groups of vertebrates.\n\nThe results from the present study suggest that malignant tumors in reptiles were more prevalent than that observed in mammals. However, this is not supported by the study of Effron et al. (1977) who did not find any significant difference in malignant tumors among the three vertebrate classes. As our data on tumor prevalence in reptiles are based on fairly small number of individuals we therefore suggest that our results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nAlthough many of the results from the present study are similar to that observed by Effron et al. (1977) and Lombard and Witte (1959) we do emphasize that the cancer etiology and prevalence were all obtained from animals kept in captivity. Cancer in captive animals has been shown to develop predominantly in older age cohorts. For example, although cancer prevalence in captive black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) has been shown to affect 55% of the ferrets, the cancer almost exclusively affected postreproductive animals (Lair et al., 2002) . The age-specific increase in cancer prevalence recorded in captive animals suggests that the significance of cancers recorded, similar to that recorded in black-footed ferrets, may therefore have limited or in some cases even no fitness effect in the wild. Regardless, cancer statistics recorded in captive animals remain an important source of information for studies in comparative oncology, as well as providing data on cancer etiology."}
