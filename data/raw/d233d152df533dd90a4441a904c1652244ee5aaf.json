{"title": "Clinical predictors of chest radiographic abnor malities in young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis: a single center study", "body": "Acute respiratory tract infection is one of the most common diseases encountered in the outpatient and/or Emergency Department settings in childhood 1) . Of these infections, bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among young children 2, 3) . Ac cording to an epidemiologic study, approximately 100,000 bronchiolitis hospitalizations occur annually in the United States 4) . Another study looking at 1,503,239 children under 18 years of age who visited the Emergency Department in Korea in 2012 found that 18,313 children (1.2%) were diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 6,321 children of them (34.5%) were admitted 5) .\n\nIn a clinical setting, clinicians often perform chest radiography on children with typical manifestations of bronchiolitis in order to rule out other diseases such as pneumonia or cardiopulmonary diseases. For example, a survey of clinical practices in the diagnosis and management of 17,397 children with bronchiolitis reported that 72% of them received chest radiographs 6) . Accordingly, there are several studies demonstrating that the majority of these chest radiographies done on children with bronchiolitis were read as negative and thus of little clinical use 610) . However, there are no studies determining the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings in Korean children admitted with bronchiolitis. Furthermore, there are only 3 studies in the litera ture reporting risk factors for radiographic abnormalities among young children with bronchiolitis 7, 9, 10) . Determining the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic find ings and understanding these risk factors could help clinicians reduce the number of chest Xrays and thus avoid unnecessary radiation exposure for children.\n\nIn the present study, we aimed to determine the proportion of chest radiographs showing pathologic findings inconsistent with bronchiolitis and the clinical predictors of pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with a typical presentation of bronchiolitis to an inpatient Pediatric Unit at a general hospital.\n\nThis was a retrospective chart review study of all young child ren hospitalized in the CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University from January 2011 through December 2012 with typi cal clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis. Young children who met the following criteria were included: (1) children <2 years of age and (2) those presenting with typical clinical manife stations of bronchiolitis: i.e., a constellation of clinical signs and symp toms such as a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by in creased respiratory effort and wheezing 11) . A total of 378 young children were admitted with bronchiolitis during the study period.\n\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (1) young children who were infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, determined as an initial indirect microparticle agglutinin technique (SerodiaMyco II, Fujirebio, Osaka, Japan) (titer of >1:320) or a 4fold increasing titer on repeat specimens and positive results for antiMycoplas ma IgM 12) , (2) young children whose caregivers did not answer questionnaires on the patient's past and parental history at the time of hospitalization, (3) young children who were born <37 weeks gestational age, or (4) young children who had a cardiac problem. Finally, 279 young children were included in the study (Fig. 1) . Clinical factors collected at the time of admission in cluded sex, age, the presence or absence of fever, laboratory data, and previous hospitalization for respiratory illnesses. We reviewed chest Xrays of children with previous admission due to respira tory illnesses and confirmed that their chest Xrays normalized prior to the current illness. On admission, all subjects underwent routine chest Xray; blood samples were taken from subjects, and laboratory assessment such as complete blood count, absolute neutrophil count, total eosinophil count, and highsensitivity Creactive protein (hsCRP) were performed. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University, Seoul, Korea (approval number: GCI1623).\n\nAll radiographs were read at admission by physicians and at a later date by a highly experienced radiologist, who is regarded as an expert in pediatric lung diseases (HKC). A second senior staff radiologist (THK) also read the initial 279 radiographs to confirm the \"expert\" reading. Both study radiologists acknowledged that the children were hospitalized due to respiratory tract illnesses, but were blinded to the details of presentation and the findings of the other participating radiologist.\n\nNasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected at the time of hospitalization by carefully irrigating the young child's nostrils with sterile saline solution. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were analyzed within 24 hours of aspiration for respiratory syn cytial viruses (RSV) (A and B), human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus (A, B, and C), coronavirus (A and B), and adenovirus. Total viral RNA was obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (300 \u03bcL) by utilizing Viral Genespin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kits (iNtRON, Seongnam, Korea) and stocked at -80\u00b0C. incorporated with 5\u00d7 buffer, 0.2mM of each dNTP, 0.5\u03bcM of each primer 1316) , 1 \u03bcL of the enzyme mix, and diethylpyrocarbonate incorporated ultrapure water to a total volume of 25 \u03bcL. After being incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes and at 94\u00b0C for 15 min utes, the reactions underwent 40 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 90 seconds at 60\u00b0C, and extension for 90 seconds at 72\u00b0C, followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The amplified specimens were analyzed on 2% agarose gels comprised of 0.5g/mL ethidium bromide.\n\nThe chest radiographic findings were divided into benign or pathologic groups 17) . Benign chest radiographic findings were defined as those consistent with uncomplicated bronchiolitis: nor mal chest radiographs, symmetric hyperinflation, parahilar peri bronchial infiltrates, and diffuse interstitial markings 17) . Pathologic chest radiographic findings included infiltrates, atelec tasis, cardiac abnormalities, foreign bodies, masses, and congeni tal anomalies 17) .\n\nThe sample size was assessed for a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary outcome. After discussion by the researchers, we assessed the percentage of children with benign chest radiogra phic findings (i.e., bronchiolitis) and pathologic chest radiogra phic findings to be \u22643%\u00b12%, with alpha=0.05 and beta=0.2, which produced a total required number of children with bron chiolitis of 260 18) .\n\nData are expressed as median (interquartile range) or number (%) unless otherwise mentioned. Differences between groups were compared by implementing the MannWhitney U tests or the chi square tests, when appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was incorporated to determine clinical risk factors for pathologic chest radiographic findings; independent variables were sex (male), age under 3 months, the presence of fever, hs CRP>0.3 mg/dL, and a history of admission for respiratory illness. Birth weight, height, and head circumference; gestational age; respiratory rate, heart rate, and body temperature at admission; oxygen saturation at admission; duration of fever; hsCRP; white blood cell count; and total eosinophil count were utilized as con tinuous variables. Sex, age under 3 months, the presence of fever at admission, hsCRP (>0.3 mg/dL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a history of admission for respiratory illnesses, chest retraction, and wheezes were categorical variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). All statistical tests were twosided, with a P value of less than 0.05 showing statistical significance.\n\nThe study population consisted of 279 children. The median age of the children was 8 months. Approximately 41% of the study subjects were male. The numbers of patients that had chest retraction and wheezing were 41 (14.7%) and 149 (53.4%), re spectively. The median hospital stay was 4 days (1-14 days) , and the number of children who received antibiotic therapy was 191 (68.5%). Only 26 of 279 children (9.3%) had pathologic chest radiographic findings on chest radiograph; of them, 24 children had opacities and two children had atelectasis.\n\nThere were no differences between groups with regard to sex; age; birth weight, height, or head circumference; gestational age; respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, or oxygen saturation at admission; the presence of fever prior to admission; duration of fever prior to admission; the presence of chest retraction or wheezes; white blood cell count or total eosinophil count at ad mission; or virus detected. The total duration of fever (3 [ \n\nthologic and those with benign chest radiographic findings Table 2 compares the respiratory viruses identified in the study subjects with pathologic and those with benign chest radiogra phic findings. RSV was identified in 6 subjects (23.1%) in the children with pathologic chest radiographic findings and 57 (22.5 %) in those with benign chest radiographic findings; human rhinovirus in 3 (11.5%) and 12 (4.7%), respectively; and human me tapneumovirus in 1 (3.8%) and 7 (2.8%), respectively. There were no differences in the incidence of each virus between the groups (P>0.05 each).\n\nThe diagnostic performance of hsCRP levels (>0.3 mg/dL) was a sensitivity of 80.8% (95% CI, 60.7-93.5), specificity of 48.5% (95% CI, 42.5-54.6), positive predictive value of 13.0% (95% CI, 8.3-19.2), and negative predictive value of 96.4% (95% CI, 91.7-98.8) for predicting pathologic chest radiographic findings.\n\nWe utilized multivariate logistic regression analysis to deter admission due to respiratory illnesses (Table 3 ).\n\nIn the present study, we aimed to determine the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings and the mine clinical predictors of pathologic chest radiographic findings in children admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses results determined that after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including sex and age, pathologic chest radiographic findings were significantly positively associated with hsCRP (>0.3 mg/dL) and a history of clinical predictors in young children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at a general hospital. We were able to demonstrate that the ma jority of children (90.7%) admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis showed benign chest radiographic findings at admission; however, those with high hsCRP levels at admission or a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the current admission were approximately 1.2 times more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings. Subjects with bronchiolitis may also have pneumonia detected by chest Xray 710) . A previous study analyzing patients less than 24 months of age admitted via the emergency department with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis found that 15 subjects out of 122 patients (12.3%) showed abnormal chest Xray findings such as atelectasis or consolidation 8) . Another study assessing 410 chest radiographs performed on children admitted with bronchio litis through the Emergency Department suggested that 40 (9.7%) were considered abnormal 7) , a number similar to our finding of 9.3%. A previous study determined that young children with oxy gen saturation \u226492% or a Respiratory Disease Assess ment Instrument (RDAI) clinical score \u226510 of 17 points were more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings than their coun terparts 10) . Another study found that body temperature \u226538\u00b0C and oxygen saturation <94% were associated with infiltrates/atelec tasis 9) . Finally, a recent study reported that the presence of fever was the only significant clinical predictor of radiographic abnor malities among their cohort 7) . In contrast to previous studies, we did not find fever or hypoxia to be a risk factor for chest abnor malities. We found that high hsCRP levels at admission or a his tory of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the cur rent admission were clinical factors predicting pathologic radio graphic findings in this cohort. This discrepancy may be ascribed to differences in characteristics of the populations such as age, sea sons during which the tests were performed, or causa tive agents.\n\nhsCRP is a wellestablished biomarker that is used on a regular basis in clinical settings. It is an acutephase serum protein in humans, and its level rises rapidly due to the cytokines released in response to infection and inflammation 19) . However, it has tradi tionally been viewed as inadequately accurate for use in the diagnosis of pneumonia, because almost all infective, autoim mune, metabolic, ischemic, and neoplastic disorders are associat ed with increased serum hsCRP levels 20) . Nonetheless, several previous research works have corroborated the idea that it may have a diagnostic value in detecting pneumonia 21) and disease severity 22) in adults and in children 23) . Similar to previous research, we determined that a high hsCRP level at admission is an inde pendent clinical predictor of pathologic chest radiographic find ings in this cohort of young children with bronchiolitis and has a high negative predictive value of 96.4%, indicating that if the subject's hsCRP is less than 0.3 mg/dL at admission, the prob ability that the subject has a benign chest radiographic finding is high. However, it should be noted that the current practice guide line states that laboratory studies should not be obtained rou tinely on children with bronchiolitis 24) . In this regard, we specu late that hsCRP could be used as a biomarker to help clinicians determine whether a chest Xray should be performed only in cases where blood samples are obtained.\n\nA history of hospitalization due to respiratory illness is an important aspect of the history in children with respiratory pro blems in the outpatient department, as the respiratory signs and symptoms in children with previous respiratory problems tend to worsen, ultimately requiring hospitalization 25) . This may be due to the fact that these subjects have chronic respiratory illnesses such as asthma, thus predisposing them to developing severe respi ratory illness. However, unfortunately, we did not evaluate every patient's asthma history and their family history of asthma.\n\nThere are some limitations to the present study. First, the cur rent study has inherent limitations due to its retrospective study design. Second, the present study is a single center study con ducted at a secondary hospital. Third, lung function measures or objective assessments such as the RDAI clinical score were not available to determine the degree of respiratory difficulty. Fourth, this study lacks a diagnostic \"gold standard\" to prove the absence of bacterial infection in children with chest abnormalities. It would be ideal to perform chest radiography after a complete review of the expected benefits of chest Xray in subjects (e.g., subjects with toxic appearance, unconventional presentations, or protracted clinical course). Furthermore, the current research work had only 2 children with atelectasis on their chest xray, and recognition of any factors predicting this highrisk finding was beyond calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that chest radiographs in young children with a typical presentation of bronchiolitis have limited value; however, those with high hsCRP levels or a history of ad mission due to respiratory illnesses prior to admission were ap proximately 1.2 times more likely to have pathologic chest radio graphic findings. Further studies with larger samples sizes are needed to corroborate this finding before a clear conclusion can be drawn."}
