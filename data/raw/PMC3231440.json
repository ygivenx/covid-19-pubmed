{"title": "Microfluidics-Based Lab-on-Chip Systems in DNA-Based Biosensing: An Overview", "body": "Advances in microfluidics for nanotechnology-based sensing methods have been met with serious challenges in the creation of diagnostic devices that allow for the simultaneous detection of several types of biotargets on a single platform for environmental monitoring. The need to rapidly detect and characterise micro-organisms in environmental samples is imperative in many different industries, among which food and agriculture, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and biodefense are key players [1\u20133]. The inability to cultivate the majority of naturally occurring micro-organisms despite the demonstrated need necessitates a fast, sensitive and reliable platform, such as a microfluidics-based lab-on-chip (LOC) system. In the field of environmental monitoring, serious attention is needed in the evaluation of microbial cells in water, soil and the environment. A list of some biological threat agents compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States [4] includes such notable agents as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Francisella tularensis (tularaemia), Yersinia pestis (plague), Variola major (smallpox), botulinum toxin (botulism), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Brucella spp. (brucellosis), Vibrio cholera (cholera), ricin, Shigella and Salmonella spp. These biological agents are transmitted via food, water, insect vectors, as aerosols or by direct contact (for extensive details, see [5\u20137]). The study of microorganism evolution and populations under conditions, such as during bio-waste composting, also requires highly sensitive devices [8]. Microfabrication technology has led to the miniaturisation of biosensors in response to increased demand for their use in environmental and medical diagnostic applications for environmental monitoring [9].\n\nGlobal Industry Analysts, Inc. [10], have indicated that biosensors provide low-cost, compact, and low-power devices for environmental monitoring and point-of-care (POC) medical applications. Point-of-care testing (POCT), which is commonly described as bedside, near-patient, ancillary, and decentralised laboratory testing used for clinical diagnostics, is considered one of the main driving forces for the future in vitro diagnostic market [11]. The demand for dissolved-oxygen (DO) biosensors will continue to grow with increasingly poor water quality and the desire to preserve natural resources to maintain the health of people and the environment. The October 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad-cow disease), Iraq\u2019s acknowledgement following the Gulf War that it possessed loaded biological weapons, and many other threats and biological \u201cincidents\u201d worldwide have increased global demand for the tools to rapidly identify causative agents and infected individuals before the agents spread beyond control [12]. This need for detection necessitates the development of biodefense devices using a microfluidics approach to monitor and control food sources, water sources, and suspect powders, and to test for decontamination after the treatment of equipment, personnel, and key environments [13]. The advent of microfluidic chips has enabled the application of biosensors in warfare threat detection and security. Microfabrication and newer manufacturing techniques will continue to increase the number of applications for current biosensors in environmental monitoring and health care. The use of inexpensive, transistor-based biosensors has recently transformed the medical research field [14].\n\nMicrofluidics traces its history from the microelectronics industry where researchers attempted to improve silicon-based micromachining processes using photolithography, etching, and bonding techniques. The first silicon-based analysis system was introduced in 1979 by Terry et al. Later, in the 1990s Manz et al. advanced the application of microfluidics [12].\n\nWhereas laboratory-scale samples are measured in millilitre-scale volumes [15], microfluidics involves the measurement of nanolitre- [12] and microlitre-scale volumes [16]. The term microfluidics therefore refers to any technology that moves microscopic and nanoscale volumes of fluid through micro-sized channels on a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). Microfluidics is a concept that combines the disciplines of fluid mechanics, surface science, chemistry, biology, and in many cases, optics, microscopy, electronics, control systems, and microfabrication [17]. Research in this field involves interdisciplinary integration. Programmable microfluidic chips, i.e., LOC systems, can automate biological computations or experiments by integrating a diverse set of biological sensors and manipulating fluids at the picolitre [18,19] and nanolitre scales [20]. Tian et al. first established a micro-solid-phase extraction (SPE) DNA purification system (Figure 1(a,b)) in a capillary packed with silica resin [21].\n\nHealth-care systems would greatly benefit from faster, more accurate and more highly precise diagnostic devices, such as microfluidics-based LOCs, which would significantly reduce health care costs while simultaneously providing better epidemiological data that can be used for infectious-disease modelling [22]. The microchip with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-glass cover and a silicon substrate, shown in Figure 1(a,b), is 2 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm. The silicon substrate contains an etched coiled channel that is 25 cm long, 200 \u03bcm wide and 120 \u03bcm deep, and the cover includes two holes that are drilled in positions according to the silicon substrate [21]. The microfluidic chip shown in Figure 1(a,b) can be used for high-purity DNA extraction.\n\nLOC-based pathogen sensors are competitive with laboratory-scale technologies in the analysis of complex biological samples. The analysis of a biological sample involves various processing steps, such as sample preparation, analyte enrichment, labelling, signal amplification and signal detection, that are performed on the chip. Therefore, only highly integrated micro-devices, or \u201cmicro total analysis systems\u201d (\u03bcTAS), have real-world applications [23].\n\nA variety of materials, including silicon, glass, soft or hard polymers and biomaterials (e.g., calcium alginate, cross-linked gelatine or hydrogels) have been used for microfabrication [24]. The choice of polymeric materials is often limited to solvent-resistant materials, such as Teflon, photopatternable silicon elastomers, thermoset polyesters, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and patterned poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), polyimide and SU-8 (negative photoresist) polymers [25,26].\n\nTwo basic dimensionless numbers are important in the context of fluid mechanics and species transport: the Reynolds number (Re) and the Peclet number (Pe). The Reynolds number is the most important of the dimensionless numbers in force flows because it dictates whether the flow is laminar or turbulent [46]. The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertia to viscous force densities and can be determined from the following equation:\n(1)Re = \u03c1\u03bdDh/\u03bcwhere \u03c1 is the density of the fluid, \u03bd is the characteristic velocity of the fluid, Dh is the hydraulic diameter of the channel and \u03bc is the viscosity of the fluid. In the micro-flow regime, the Re ranges from 10\u22126 to 10.\n\nThe dimensionless number that characterises the nature and strength of the diffusive mixing is referred to as the Peclet number (Pe). The Pe represents the relative strength of convection versus diffusion and can be determined from:\n(2)Pe = vw/Dwhere w is the width of the microchannel, \u03c5 is the characteristic velocity of the fluid and D is the diffusion coefficient of the solute particles. Because of the ineffectiveness of diffusion-dependent mixing, researchers have developed other innovative strategies for mixing by secondary or transverse flow. Unavoidable shear flow and diffusion in the microchannels makes inter-sample and dead volumes difficult to eliminate [47].\n\nOther noteworthy dimensionless numbers in specific appliances include the Knudsen number (Kn), which signifies the ratio of the molecular mean free path with the characteristic system length scale; the capillary number (Ca), which represents the ratio between the viscous and surface tension forces; the Weissenberg number (Wi), which is the ratio between the relaxation time and the shear rate of polymers; and the Deborah number (De), which represents the ratio of the polymer relaxation time to the characteristic flow time. For further reference, detailed discussions on these numbers are available elsewhere [28].\n\nResearchers are shifting from traditional continuous-flow-based systems in microfluidics research to droplet-flow-based systems referred to as digital microfluidics. The circulation flow within the droplet and the high surface-to-volume ratio enhances efficient mixing and provides thermal dissipation with short reaction times [47]. The interfacial stress balance between a droplet and the continuous phase at its interface is preserved [48]:\n(3)(\u03c4d \u2212 \u03c4a) nt \u2212 \u2207y t = 0(pd \u2212 pa) \u2212 \u03b3\u2207n  = 0}where \u03c4 is the deviatoric stress tensor, n is the unit normal of the interface pointing out of the droplet, t is a tangential vector of unit length at the interface, p is hydrodynamic pressure, \u03b3 is the interfacial tension coefficient and \u2207 is the interfacial divergence; the subscripts d and a denote properties of the droplet and the ambient continuous phase, respectively.\n\nIn most electrically controlled digital microfluidic devices [47,49], the droplets are either conductive or highly polarisable. At the droplet surface:\n(4)n (\u2212\u025ba,i \u2207\u03d5a,i) = \u03c3\u03b4\u03c3\u03b4t + \u2207\u03a3 \u03c3v + n k \u2207\u03d5d = 0}where \u03c3 is the surface charge density at the droplet surface, v is the fluid velocity inside the droplet, k is the droplet conductivity, \u2207\u03a3 is the interfacial divergence, \u03d5 is the electric potential and \u025b is the electric permittivity; the subscripts a, d and i denote the continuous phase, droplets and contacting solid phase, respectively.\n\nAn electrochemical detection system for DNA sensing can be achieved by the catalysed reduction and oxidation of DNA bases or through the electrochemical response displayed by redox markers in a specific binding event with the target DNA. An integrated microfluidic electrochemical DNA (IMED) sensor has performed three main biochemical functions: symmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzymatic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation, and sequence-specific electrochemical detection [70]. Electrochemical DNA hybridisation biosensors are based on the ability of ssDNA to match with its counterpart strand of a complementary nucleotide sequence [71], as well as washing steps [72,73] and the immobilisation of the capture probe on the electrode. Nanoparticles, nanogold [74,75], and zirconia [76] have been used to modify the electrode for DNA-probe (ssDNA) immobilisation. Fractal analysis [77] has been used to analyse the hybridisation of different targets (400 nM) in solution to a probe immobilised on the DNA chip surface [78], the hybridisation of various concentrations in nanomoles (nM) of free-DNA in solution to 22-mer strand (bond DNA) immobilised through a phenylene-diisocyanate linker molecule on a glass substrate [79], and the binding (hybridisation) of a complimentary and a non-complimentary (three-base mismatch strand) DNA in a solution to a 30-mer 3\u2032-thiolated DNA strand immobilised on an electrochemical enzymatic genosensor [80]. Fractal analysis may provide a good option for the kinetic analysis of the binding and dissociation of hybridisation in analyte-receptor reactions performed on biosensor surfaces [77].\n\nThe interactions of redox complexes with DNA in solution have been studied through cyclic voltammetry. Voltammetric peak currents generally decrease with the decreased mass diffusion of DNA that results from its binding to metal complexes, and the level of signal reduction is a function of DNA concentration [81]. These effects form the basis for real-time DNA detection. Various methods of enhancing electrochemical DNA biosensor sensitivity using redox markers have been reported. Electroactive redox markers that intercalate their targets produce chemical signals and are mostly products of polymers [73,82]; metal complexes, such as cadmium complex [83]; organic dyes [84]; and ruthenium complex and its derivatives [81,85].\n\nThe extraction of DNA from a sample serves as a useful method for retrieving genetic information about its source. The extractions of DNA from soil samples, especially forest soil, are occasionally contaminated by humic substances. These substances create interferences that arise from their similar chemical and physical characteristics to soil. Researchers have developed a number of strategies to eliminate such contaminants. During the stages of DNA extraction, for example, electrophoresis has been carried out in different pH buffers to eliminate the interfering effects [86]. Recent soil genetic research includes the cry gene resources of Bacillus thuringiensis in soil [87], soil bacteria community composition by 16S rRNA gene clones [88], and the diversity of diazotrophic bacteria in peat soil through the cloning of the nifH gene [89].\n\nWe have presented an overview of the research on microfluidics-based LOC systems for DNA-based biosensors. We first provided an overview of the threat posed by pathogenic micro-organisms that affect the environment, and the new challenges introduced by the advent of microfluidics were highlighted. The fluid mechanics of the systems at the nanoscale were then discussed. The inherent challenges of fluid flow in microchannels were analysed, although issues of using mechanical pumps for fluid transmission still require attention. Basic research in fluid mechanics and the transport phenomena of fluids greater than nanolitre-scale volumes, along with technological advancements in the fabrication and control processes, will indeed play significant roles in the automation of fluid flow in microchannels. The main application of microfluidics in pathogen detection involves DNA-based methods through electrochemical techniques [70,72]. Various methods of electrode modification are needed to improve the results, and the choice of electrode depends on the approach of the researcher; details of this issue were also highlighted in this paper. The environmental threats by pathogenic micro-organisms are real because plants and animals are suffering from the consequences. There is a clear need for devices, such as microfluidics-based LOCs in controlling the effects of pathogens in the environment."}
