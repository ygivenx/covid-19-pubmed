{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection in 86 healthcare workers in two Dutch hospitals in March 2020 Corresponding author", "body": "On February 27, 2020, the first patient with COVID-19 was reported in the Netherlands. During the following weeks, nine healthcare workers (HCWs) were diagnosed with COVID-19 in two Dutch teaching hospitals, eight of whom had no history of travel to China or Northern-Italy. A low-threshold screening regimen was implemented to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs in these two hospitals.\n\nHCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19.\n\nThirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty (93%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. None of the HCWs identified through the screening reported a travel history to China or Northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms.\n\nWithin two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, asks for less stringent use of the currently recommended case-definition for suspected COVID-19.\n\n.

The study was judged to be beyond the scope of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act and a waiver of written informed consent was granted. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 testing, from SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs for data collection. Data were de-identified before analysis.\n\nBetween March 7, 2020 and March 12, 2020, HCWs in both teaching hospitals who suffered from fever or (mild) respiratory symptoms in the last ten days were tested voluntarily for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in accordance with the local infection control policy during outbreaks.\n\nA semi-quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR, 45 cycles) targeting the E-gene was performed on self-collected oropharyngeal samples as described previously (Appendix). 4 Structured interviews were conducted between March 12, 2020 and March 16, 2020 to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19, including those diagnosed before March 7, 2020 (Appendix). Recovery was defined as being without symptoms for more than 24 h.\n\n.

Continuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges.\n\nCategorical variables were summarised as counts and percentages. There were no missing data. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\nThe funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nA total of 1,353 (14%) HCWs were screened, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure  1 ). HCWs with COVID-19 were employed in 52 different hospital departments, including 36 medical wards, had a median age of 49 years (range 22-66 years) and 15 (17%) were male (Table  1) .\n\nMost HCWs with COVID-19 suffered from relatively mild disease. Forty-six (53%) HCWs had fever during the course of illness, another 10 (12%) reported a feverish feeling without having measured their temperature. Eighty (93%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Extending this case definition with severe myalgia and/or general malaise would capture all 86 (100%) HCWs with COVID-19 in this evaluation. Other frequent symptoms were headache, a runny nose, a sore throat, chest pain, diarrhea and loss of appetite. Seven (8%) indicated that they were already symptomatic before February 27, 2020, the day the first Dutch patient with COVID-19 was diagnosed ( Figure  2 ). Four (5%) HCWs had recovered on the day of screening, 19 (22%) on the day of the interview, with a median duration of illness of 8 days (range 1-20 days) ( Table  1) . Two (2%)\n\nHCWs were admitted to the hospital and did not develop critical disease up to the moment of reporting. Coughing, shortness of breath, general malaise, loss of appetite and altered or loss of taste were more frequent in HCWs who were interviewed during the second week of illness. Three (3%) HCWs reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms, and 54 (63%) mentioned to have worked while being symptomatic.\n\nThe median RT-PCR Ct value was 27\u00b70 (range 14\u00b75-38\u00b75). Within the limited resolution in time since the onset of symptoms, Ct values tended to be higher in HCWs who were tested later in the course of disease ( Figure  3) . Ct values were similar for HCWs with and without fever on the day of screening (median 25\u00b71 and 27\u00b76, respectively), and for HCWs with and without any symptoms on the day of screening (median 27\u00b70 and 26\u00b77, respectively).\n\nTwo weeks after the first Dutch patient with COVID-19 was reported, the prevalence of COVID-19 in HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms in two Dutch hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands was 6%. This unexpected high prevalence supported the hypothesis of hidden community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and is considered a minimal estimate of the prevalence in all HCWs at the time of screening. Only HCWs with (recent) symptoms were screened, and .

A limitation of our evaluation is that screening of HCWs was based on the presence of fever or mild respiratory symptoms in the last ten days, and that no data were collected in HCWs without these symptoms. The sensitivity and specificity of the reported symptoms could therefore not be estimated.\n\nIn conclusion, during the containment phase and within two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. This observation confirms the insidious nature of SARS-CoV-2 spread, given the high prevalence of mild clinical presentations that may go undetected. 8 The spectrum of relatively mild symptoms present in HCWs with COVID-19, frequently not including fever, asks for less stringent use of the currently recommended case-definition for suspected COVID-19.\n\nSP, JV and MKo were involved in laboratory testing.
