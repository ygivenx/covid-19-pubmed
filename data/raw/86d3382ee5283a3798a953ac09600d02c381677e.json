{"title": "", "body": "We define infection as a pathogenic interaction of one living system within the terrain of another living system. The term \"infection\" is derived from the Latin inficere meaning to taint. What is tainted is the coherence of the metaself (self + symbiotes-cf. Chapter 5) and the metastable functioning of this terrain. From this unitary definition, we derive the actors in the dyad: the nonself organism (the infector) and the terrain of the aggressed organism(s) (the infected). Infections are the dynamic of the virulence of the infector relative to the adaptive capabilities of the infected. The greater the virulence is, and the less competent adaptive capabilities are, the greater the risk of infection. Since the time of Koch and Pasteur, the exclusive line of evaluation and treatment has been the infector, with no consideration for the terrain of the infected. This is like while having a hole in one's roof and clogged gutters on a rainy day, focusing on dispersing rain clouds rather than fixing the house.\n\nWe must make a distinction between infection and infectious disease. Infection is the presence of an organism within another organism(s) due to insufficient defense capabilities. Virchow (d. 1902 ), physician-pathologist and the founder of cellular pathology, recognized that organisms exist in tissues without causing disease. 1 Infectious disease, then, is the syndrome that results from both the specific virulence of the infector and the adaptive and adaptative responses of the infected organism(s).\n\nThe endobiogenic approach to infectious disorders is rich, combining teleological, anatomical, and functional considerations of each area of the organism. It involves ascertaining the answer to seven queries: (1) why this structure is infected: teleology of structure and function, (2) why this patient is infected: precritical terrain, (3) why this organism infected: the organism and its virulence-absolute and relative to the competency of host defenses, (4) why these symptoms are manifested: critical terrain during an infection, (5) what is the benefit of the infectious symptoms: its adaptive or adaptative role, (6) what is the current net state of the terrain: mechanisms and consequences of endogenous response of the infected, and response of the infector, and (7) how to manage: personalization of treatment based on the reality of both the infected and the infector.\n\nWe discourage a view of seeing potential pathogens as enemies to be eliminated, or the external environment as one needing to become sterile. The world is full of Life. Each living being has its own path of existence and environment for survival. We cannot alter this fact of nature. To make it sterile is to sterilize Life. What can be done is to strengthen the buffering capacity and adaptability of the patient for the fullest expression of their Life and vitality. This allows for the greatest degrees of freedom with respect to where they go, how they live, what they do, and what they eat, without fear of invasion, infection, and disease.\n\nRhinopharyngitis is an infectious disorder of the nasal (rhino-) and pharyngeal (pharynx-) mucosa. A congestive terrain with insufficient peripheral cortico-thyrotropic adaptation of immunity favors infections in this region of the body.\n\nThe nasal cavity consists of folds of mucosal tissue situated inferior to the sinus cavities and superior to the oral cavity ( Fig. 9.1 ). It has a contiguous relationship with the pharynx. It is surrounded by cartilage in the most anterior position and bone in the inferior and superior regions. The posteriorinferior portion has a wall of soft tissue.\n\nThe nasal cavity is the origin of the airways. Respiration is an unceasing and essential function. The integrity, patency, and safety of the nasal cavities are essential to this activity. The nose extends more anterior from the surface of its origin than any other part of the body. It is literally the vanguard of chemical surveillance of the quality of air Chapter 9\n\nand risk of exposure to nonself actors with each inhalation: microorganisms, particulate, and gaseous chemical entities. Due to the constant aggression on the nasal airway, it has a high turnover rate and is subjected to permanent, intermittent relative adaptive congestion, one nostril alternating with the other. 2 The nasal airway has three primary functions: respiration, defense, and olfaction. Respiration is divided into inspiration and expiration. The functions of the mucosa during inspiration are three: (1) determination of air quality, (2) humidification, and (3) filtration of air. The purposes of exhalation are two: (1) egress of carbon dioxide (acid-base balance) and (2) intonation of speech. The requirements of defense arise from the first function of respiration. 3 The purpose of olfaction is to determine information crucial to the survival of the organisms: location and integrity of foods, 4 the presence of organism of the same or different species, and reproduction. 5, 6 ANS Parasympathetic activity is implicated in the passive nutritive congestion of the sinuses. 7 This allows for this tissue to maintain its high rate of turnover. Because it is inefficient to congest both sinuses at the same time, the organism alternates the relative tonus of para and alpha. For example, the right nostril will be congested (para > alpha) for repair and growth, while the left is open (para=alpha). The alternation of ANS function is crucial to maintain a physiologic congestion.\n\nThe induction of rhinopharyngitis occurs when there is a confluence of adaptative congestion and insufficient immunity and the presence of a virulent organism. The pharynx is implicated because of its contiguous anatomical and functional relationships with the nasal airway.\n\nThe precritical ANS state is spasmophilia with elevated histamine. The elevated histamine can be local to the mucosa as a defense mechanism, associated with alpha-sympathetic as an autacoid, or both. 8 The emunctory terrain is oversolicitation of the exocrine pancreas, and, congestion of the gallbladder and intestines. The primum movens of the precritical terrain is a local spasmophilia with para > alpha and beta that is delayed or insufficiency relative to the alpha tone. Related to the nutritive congestive activity of para (and histamines), one finds a hyperinsulinism, which favors congestion, hyperemia, and infections. The excess presence of glucose favors both the growth of tissue and pathogens. Thus, the endocrine pancreas is implicated in rhinopharyngitis.\n\nOversolicitation of the exocrine pancreas favors mucous production (cf. The Theory of Endobiogeny, Volume 3, Chapter 2). 9 Biliary and intestinal congestion favor autointoxication and diminished extracellular communication networks. In our experience, a diet that strains the gallbladder (high fat, fried foods, etc.) or the pancreas (high fat, high glycemic, hard to digest animal proteins) can contribute to nasal congestion. Table 9 .1 summarizes the rhinopharyngitis terrain.\n\nGiven the precritical terrain, the etiology of rhinopharyngitis is in three factors: pathogenic organisms, environmental irritants, and structural factors. These include nasal polyps, deviated septum, and tonsil hypertrophy. The later impairs the flow of nasal secretions through the pharynx. 7\n\nThe critical terrain involves adrenal cortex and peripheral thyroid. Thymus and spleen may also be implicated.\n\nDysregulation of immune activity involves the two catabolic axes. There is peripheral adrenal cortex insufficiency, which exacerbates hyperhistaminemia. Peripheral thyroid activity is insufficient. Because of the importance of thyroid activity in children from 1 to 7 years of age, they are particularly susceptible to ENT disorders, especially when there is a latent hypothyroidism (Chapter 10, Table 10 .4). Finally, one may find insufficiency of thymic response to immune development (children) or acute infection (children and adults). Congestion of the spleen can diminish the filtering of pathogenic organisms as well as the development and function of immunity. When alpha activity is quantitatively elevated in the ENT region, it can congest lymphatics and lymph nodes, compromising local immune defense mechanisms.\n\nThe majority of pathogenic organisms implicated in rhinopharyngitis are viruses. 3 Thus, antibiotics are not applicable unless they are used as a secondary treatment for inflammation, 10 which we do not recommend as routine practice. Our preferred approach to treatment is to address the underlying elements of the pre-and critical terrain noted earlier.\n\nBecause the interior of the nose is directly accessible, essential oils are a particularly efficient treatment. \n\nSinusitis is an infectious disease affecting the sinus cavities. The physiologic factors are similar to rhinopharyngitis but with a more intense active congestion by alpha-sympathetic.\n\nThere are four symmetrical pairs of sinus cavities: frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary. The maxillary sinuses are contiguous with the nasal mucosa via the middle nasal concha ( Fig. 9 .2).\n\nThe activity of the sinuses is closely aligned with that of the rhinopharynx. Sinusitis is implicated as a source of rhinitis and vice versa. The sinuses serve five primary functions: (1) ventilation, (2) information, (3) humidification, (4) structure, and (5) defense. Ventilation allows for air exchange and equilibrium of pressure between the cranium and the general cephalic unit. Information refers to the provision of chemical information about quality of air. The sinuses serve as a secondary source of humidification, which keeps nasal mucous hydrated. The light-weight cavities of the sinuses form a lightweight structural support for the nose and first cranial nerve. Finally, the sinuses are a source of defense and containment: it contains exogenous aggressors to protect the body through its own defense system, which includes macrophages, immunoglobulins, mucous, antimicrobial secretions, etc. 3,15,16\n\nThe precritical terrain is similar to that of rhinopharyngitis. Patients with chronic type 1 allergies are susceptible to sinus congestion for reasons discussed in prior chapters. Local and regional agents that exacerbate the precritical terrain 1 \n\nIn sinusitis, the nature of aggression can either be a single substantial aggression, or prolonged and repetitive aggressions that fragilize the terrain 3 :\n\n1. Allergy flare-up 2. Rhinopharyngitis 3. Adaptive demands that increase alpha 4. Metabolic demands that increase para with a reactive alpha 5. Weather and geographic changes with a sudden increase in hydrostatic pressure 6. Altered ventilation 7. Blocked drainage: that is, nasal endothelial edema and inflammation ( Fig. 9. 3), adenoid hypertrophy ( Fig. 9 .4).\n\nDue to the partially or fully enclosed nature of the sinus cavities, those susceptible to sinusitis are those in whom the alpha-sympathetic activity is quantitatively more elevated than parasympathetic and as compared to those who only experience rhinopharyngitis with the same terrain. Recall that in rhinopharyngitis, para is greater than alpha.\n\n1. ANS a. Para: hyperfunctioning with congestion and hypersecretions b. Alpha: hyperfunctioning to isolate the sinuses and protect the regional tissues c. Beta: hypofunctioning, prolongs:\n\ni. Congestion ii. Obstruction iii. Stagnation of secretions 2. Endocrine: cf. rhinopharyngitis 3. Emunctory: cf. rhinopharyngitis\n\nThere is a potential role for the use of antibiotics in acute sinusitis, though even this is questionable, both in adults and children. A majority of cases resolve without treatment. 17 In chronic sinusitis, or, chronic recurrent sinusitis, antibiotics are not effective in resolving the recidivistic nature of the infection. 18 Considering the long-term risk of cancer in patients correlating with total life-time utilization of antibiotics, [19] [20] [21] we don't recommend antibiotics as an exclusive method of treating chronic recurrent sinusitis. Given the risk of evolution of chronic sinusitis to allergic (extrinsic) asthma (cf. The Theory of Endobiogeny, Volume 3, Chapter 2), it become all the more capital to treat the underlying precritical terrain. 22 According to the theory of endobiogeny, the order of priority and intensity of therapy in sinusitis is at variance with that of rhinopharyngitis due to the location and function and accessibility of the sinuses. The top areas of focus are the sinuses and gallbladder. \n\nTonsillitis is an infectious disorder involving the lymphoid tissue of the naso-oral region-the very tissue designed to protect the ear nose and throat from infections.\n\nThere refers to three sets of lymphoid tissues which are commonly referred to as \"tonsils\": adenoids, palatine, and lingual. 23 As becomes readily apparent ( Fig. 9.4 ): tonsil enlargement, even when noninfected, creates a terrain that favors rhinopharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media (OM), and airway obstruction with all that that implies.\n\nThe tonsils sit at the cross roads of digestion, respiration, and immunity. They serve as the primary immune-protection against respiratory and digestive pathogens. They are a lymphoid tissue containing B and T lymphocytes, and macrophages.\n\nThe precritical terrain develops from adaptative neuroendocrine-emunctory imbalances meant to regulate the structure and function of lymphoid tissue. The endocrine imbalances are different from the upper airway conditions. The follicular nature of lymphoid tissue and implication of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in lymphoid activity implicates gonado-thyrotropic coupling that plays an important role in the growth of lymphoid tissue. The exocrine pancreas and endocrine pancreas are implicated because of their role in the adenoidal tissue growth. \n\nOM is an infectious disorder involving the serosal tissue of the eustachian tube resulting in tympanic pressure, pain, inflammation, and fever.\n\nThe tympanum and inner ear cavity are serosal structures of mesodermal origin, which implicates the gonadotropic axis. The serosal structures produces secretions that act as a defense against infections from the nasopharynx. 24 Ciliary activity moves the fluid and anything trapped within it. It also equalizes ear pressure and allows for appropriate tympanic response to sound. The eustachian tube also allows for passive drainage of serosal fluid and participates in equalization of pressure. 24 It is supported by muscles that can become dysfunctional in spasmophilic states, favoring OM due to stasis of fluid. While there are numerous contributing factors, the diminished angle of drainage in infants and toddlers compared to older children and adults makes them particularly susceptible ( Fig. 9 .5). 25\n\nEustachian tube anatomy in infants vs adults. Infants have a narrower angle to the eustachian tube that is more susceptible to stasis and stagnation, allowing microorganisms to grow in its protein-rich environment. (Courtesy of Netter medical illustration used with permission of Elsevier. All rights reserved.)\n\nThe ANS dysfunction is spasmophilic, as with the other ENT disorders discussed. However, the role of the ANS is not only in congestion of the serosa, but stasis of serosal fluid. \n\nCompromised immunity from lack of, or, insufficient duration of breast feeding, and maternal postnatal diet are correlated with increased risk of OM in infancy and early childhood. 26\n\nThere are two general categories: impaired drainage and increased exposure to potential pathogens: \n\nSerosal fluid is rich in protein. In a precritical terrain, when there is simultaneously substantially diminished or blocked drainage of serosal fluid and establishment of virulent organisms a patient is susceptible to otitis media with effusion (OME). \n\nAdaptative response exacerbates the precritical emunctory imbalances\n\nDrainage of the liver is more imperative in OM than in other ENT disorders\n\nSymptomatic Local treatments Distention of the tympanic membrane can cause significant discomfort for children. As with treatment of the nasal cavity, ready access to the tympanum from the ear canal allows for direct application of therapeutics with rapid onset of action for relief. Local application of symptomatic therapies is preferred because it allows for the regional and systemic response to infections to continue and reach its natural conclusion.\n\na.

This response will determine the type of bronchitis. Viruses are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Noninfectious agents can trigger an acute-on-chronic bronchitis. The four key factors to consider are: (1) pathogens, (2) particulate matter and gasses (allergens, tobacco smoke, etc.), (3) gastric secretions with micro-aspiration, and (4) cold. 33\n\nAcute bronchitis develops as a maladapted response to the local aggression on the airways. It can be divided into two categories: wet or dry ( Fig. 9 .7) based on the ANS response during illness. Dry, inspiratory coughing is related to hyperalpha predominance. Wet, expiratory coughing is related to a hyper-para predominance. The quality and quantity of mucous is further determined by the endocrine and exocrine pancreatic response that predominates in the adaptation response. The treatment must be tailored to the type of bronchitis.\n\nPharmacologic treatment with antibiotics is only modestly effective, and carries the typical short-and long-term risks associated with antibiotics already discussed. 34, 35 Given the self-limited nature of most cases of acute bronchitis, 36 then, a nonpharmacological approach is worth considering. Both symptomatic treatment as well as that of the terrain has been quite effective. 11, 37 Inflammation is the common local histopathology. All forms of acute bronchitis should be treated with antiinflammatory and antiinfectious agents when implicated. Key symptomatic treatments are listed in Table 9 .2 with indication of symptom(s) treated. 11, 12 For more severe symptoms, essential oils can be nebulized in a 5% concentration (3 drops per 3 mL of solution). In our experience, two highly efficient essential oils are Cupressus sempervirens and Lavandula angustafolia. For wet bronchitis, use 3% normal saline, as it helps dissolve inspissated mucous. 38 For dry bronchitis, 0.9% normal saline suffices. Also see The Theory of Endobiogeny, Volume 3, Chapter 2 for additional approaches to nebulization of essential oils.\n\nDrainage is listed in order of importance (Table 9 .3). One will note that many of the medicinal plants listed are the same as those used for symptomatic treatment of the critical terrain. 11, 12 FIG. 9.7 Bronchitis terrain. The precritical terrain (yellow) of bronchitis is shown in the upper 1/4th of the image, where the factors related to global disequilibrium of anabolism are presented. In the second section, around oxygen demand are the fragilizers that allow for the aggressor to lead to the critical terrain. The lower half of the image shows the critical terrain specific to acute vs chronic bronchitis and acute wet vs acute dry bronchitis. Acute dry bronchitis (purple) has an inspiratory cough and a predominance of alpha > para. Acute wet bronchitis is an expiratory cough with a predominance of para > alpha that occurs in vagotonic individuals. The quality of mucous then further differentiates the particularities of the critical terrain in the individual and allows for a personalized approach to treatment.
