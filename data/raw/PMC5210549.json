{"title": "Virus Variation Resource \u2013 improved response to emergent viral outbreaks", "body": "The NCBI Virus Variation Resource provides users with a convenient way in which to search, download, and analyze viral nucleotide and protein sequences. The resource includes data processing pipelines that retrieve sequences from GenBank, provide standardized gene and protein annotation, and map sequence source descriptors (i.e. metadata) to uniform vocabularies. This data processing enables users to select sequences based on standardized gene, protein and metadata terms using a purposely-designed interface. Once selected, sequences can then be downloaded with the standardized metadata in a variety of formats or analyzed using web-based alignment and tree building tools. There are currently seven discrete Virus Variation modules\u2014Dengue virus, Ebolavirus, influenza virus, MERS coronavirus, Rotavirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus\u2014and these include a total of nearly 550 000 nucleotide sequences (see Table 2). Example usages of the resources for dengue virus, Ebolavirus, and rotavirus are Klema et al. (15), Bell et al. (16), Agbemabiese et al. (17), respectively.\n\nCurrent development efforts have focused on expanding the Virus Variation model to include more viruses, enhancing the functionality of the resource and providing rapid support to emergent sequencing efforts. This last point has been particularly relevant over the past several years as emerging viral outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses and others have quickly led to large sequencing efforts. There was a clear need to support these sequencing efforts with bioinformatics resources, but timelines prevented traditional development paths where new virus modules and features were added over the course of months. The first rapid deployment of a Virus Variation module was during the western African Ebola virus outbreak that began in December of 2013. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on August 8, 2014 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/). By September, a Virus Variation Resource specific to Ebolaviruses was available to help access the sequences that had begun to pour into the INSDC databases. Similarly, a Virus Variation Resource module was developed in September 2014 in response to the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most recently, this rapid response model was repeated for the Zika virus module, which was put in place in March 2016. This need-based deployment strategy is likely a model for future efforts, and much of our current development is geared toward harmonizing processes and interfaces among individual data and software modules so as to provide more support for more virus species within the resource and to respond more efficiently to emergent large-scale sequencing efforts.\n\nAccurate gene and protein annotation is necessary both to identify sequences of interest and to analyze them. The Virus Variation Resource employs annotation pipelines that support consistent gene and protein naming. Initial processing for each annotation pipeline is the same: Newly released GenBank records are retrieved hourly based on their listed taxonomy. Retrieved sequences are compared to nucleotide references for that virus group using BLASTN, and the best match is determined (8,13,18). This step confirms species taxonomy, identifies segment assignment if applicable and provides information about the lineage, genotype, type or subtype. The references used are listed in Table 3, and sequences that fail to match a reference within established metrics are pushed to a curation interface where they can be reviewed manually.\n\nOnce a sequence has been matched to a reference, one of three pipelines is employed to determine the span of gene and protein features and to assign standardized names to these features. The first pipeline uses a reference protein guided approach based on the Prosplign tool as described previously (8,13,18). Here, protein reference sequences are aligned with potential translations of the query sequence. The highest scoring translation alignment to any protein reference is then chosen and parsed to determine that it meets specific criteria \u2013 the presence of a start codon, exact matches to mature peptide cleavage sites or premature stop sites. Post transcriptional and translational exceptions can be accounted for by this tool by adjusting parameters and allowing multiple transitions from different open reading frames to be assembled into a single alignment. One advantage of this approach is that new viruses can be incorporated by adding new reference protein sequences and adjusting the criteria used for validating a particular translation. Such was the case for Zika virus annotation where the existing dengue virus pipeline was updated with new Zika virus reference sequences (see Table 3).\n\nA second approach to gene and protein annotation was implemented in the Ebola virus and MERS coronavirus rapid deployment modules. Here, there was a need to quickly develop a pipeline that could validate the annotation on GenBank records and assign consistent gene and protein names so that these could be accurately used as search criteria. To accomplish this, a BLAST-based pipeline was developed that compares genes and proteins as annotated on GenBank records to reference proteins derived from the best reference nucleotide match. If a protein matches the reference sequence with >70% identity as measured by BLASTP then the presence of this protein is stored. Genes are validated in the same manner using BLASTN and reference nucleotide sequences. Sequences with genes and proteins that cannot be validated are pushed to the curation interface where they can be manually examined. Ultimately these approaches support both search and analysis functionality but are not capable of generating standardized annotation across all sequences belonging to a particular virus.\n\nOur experience has emphasized the importance of accurate annotation pipelines that can be applied to new viruses rapidly in response to emergent needs. Though our current pipelines are effective, they are also very specific to particular viruses and application to new viruses requires much work developing reference sequences, defining processing parameters and manually reviewing annotation results. With that in mind we are now implementing a new, third approach to annotation that can be adapted rapidly when needed and is scalable to multiple virus groups. This new approach is built around two important considerations. First, it uses annotations contained within the so-call Reference Sequence records (19) that are created by our group to represent important taxonomic and sequence space groups. The nucleotide and protein sequences within these records can be invaluable for the unambiguous assignment of sequences to defined groups and can also serve as repositories of reference sequence feature annotation maintained by in-house curation efforts often in collaboration with other scientists (20\u201324). Second, this approach includes a comprehensive list of error flags that provide extensive information about sequences and can provide warnings about potential problems. This error coding not only allows staff to quickly sort through thousands of annotations during the development of new pipelines, but also provides potential criteria for the selection or filtering of sequences to resource users.\n\nThis new approach was used to annotate polyprotein and mature peptide genomic intervals in West Nile virus (WNV), and this annotation will be available soon through the Virus Variation Resource. These annotations were calculated as follows: First, GenBank West Nile sequences were classified as one of the two common lineages of WNV (lineage 1 or lineage 2) using a combination of BLASTN (25) against the two RefSeq sequences and expert knowledge. The principal characteristic that distinguishes lineage 1 from lineage 2 is that the additional protein WARF4 occurs only in lineage 1 WNV genomes and is believed to occur in most of them (7). There is some evidence that a small proportion of WNV genomes do not fit neatly into lineage 1 or lineage 2 (7), but these were classified as lineage 2 in our annotations. Second, the annotation pipeline built a covariance model (CM) for each of 16 mature peptides present in the NC_009942 RefSeq annotation and for the 15 mature peptides in the NC_001563 RefSeq. The CMs are built using the cmbuild program of the Infernal homology search software package (26). Infernal is typically used for modeling the sequence and secondary structure of RNAs, and because the sequences we are modeling lack structure (i.e. basepairs between positions), the CMs we created are effectively identical to sequence-only profile hidden Markov models. In the current version of our pipeline, each model was derived from the single RefSeq nucleotide sequence encoding each mature peptide. Third, the CMs built from the RefSeq to which that genome was assigned were used to predict each mature peptide coding sequence using Infernal's cmscan program.\n\nThe annotation software then runs a variety of validation checks and produces error codes that assist in curation of sequences. For example, the pipeline checks for the existence of any in-frame stop codons within the predicted regions. If one or more is found, the prediction boundaries are modified to terminate at the 5\u2032-most stop found. Coding sequence (CDS) coordinates are determined implicitly based on the predicted mature peptide coordinates. Lineage 1 (NC_009942) has three CDSs and lineage 2 (NC_001563) has two CDSs. For each CDS, the predictions for the corresponding mature peptides that make up each CDS are tested for consistency by ensuring that mature peptide coding sequences that are adjacent (separated by 0 nucleotides) in the RefSeq are also adjacent in the predictions. The start position of the first mature peptide and end position of the final mature peptide that comprise each CDS are then used as the start and stop position for that CDS. CDS annotations are not made if the mature peptide consistency check fails. In addition to checking for early stop codons and the adjacency of mature peptide coding sequences, the annotation pipeline identifies other unusual or unexpected features in each sequence and reports those as \u2018error codes\u2019. There are 17 possible error codes, which provide an easy way for users to gauge the quality of each sequence and its annotations, and should facilitate the selection of subsets of the sequence data that meet specific user-defined quality standards. A more detailed description of the new annotation pipeline and error flags will be included in full detail eventually in a separate manuscript, as well as in the help documents available at the Virus Variation Resource.\n\nAnother important aspect of sequence analysis is to place a given sequence within biological, temporal and geospatial contexts. Such associations can provide profound health policy and scientific insights, but unfortunately, descriptors that provide information about the source of nucleotide sequences are notoriously inconsistent. To resolve this issue, the Virus Variation database loading pipeline parses GenBank records, identifies important metadata terms, such as sample isolation host, date, country and source, and maps these to a standardized vocabulary using a hierarchical approach. For example, isolation host terms are first identified in the host field and failing that, then isolate or strain fields, then isolation source, note and finally organism name.\n\nThis vocabulary mapping strategy follows the INSDC practice of separating isolation host from source. In this convention host refers to an organism\u2014and hence has an organism's name that can be mapped to the NCBI taxonomy tree\u2014and isolation source refers to a physical, environmental or local geographic location (1). For human pathogens isolation source often refers to a host tissue or bodily fluid, and the Virus Variation vocabulary mapping strategy attempts to combine similar clinical terms into biologically relevant groups. For example, the parsed terms \u2018serum,\u2019 \u2018plasma\u2019 and \u2018lymphocytes\u2019 are all mapped to the standardized vocabulary term \u2018blood\u2019. To support more efficient data retrieval, host terms are mapped in a hierarchy, and once a species term such as \u2018Accipiter cooperii\u2019 is identified, it is mapped to both the group name \u2018Bird\u2019 and the common name \u2018Accipiter.\u2019\n\nOther metadata terms such as those for disease associations and clinical/laboratory manipulations are more difficult to parse. To this end, laboratory isolates, vaccine strains and environmental samples are identified by searching for key terms, such as \u2018tissue culture\u2019 or \u2018sewage,\u2019 from all fields. Disease terms for dengue virus are also found using a similar strategy. In all cases these strategies require extensive examination of sequence records and documentation of specific terms that can be accurately mapped to controlled vocabulary gleaned from established ontologies such as the Environmental Ontology (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENVO) and the Infectious Disease Ontology (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IDO). This process is supported by a curation interface that lists records where parsing fails to identify expected terms, leading to good old-fashioned manual curation and the identification of new terms, common misspellings, regional spelling differences and the manual incorporation of metadata from relevant literature into the Virus Variation database. In total, these vocabulary remapping strategies can have a profound impact on data usability as large numbers of parsed terms can be mapped to controlled vocabularies (Table 4).\n\nThe Virus Variation annotation and metadata mapping pipelines create standardized terms that can then be leveraged by the resource search interface. A link to this interface can be found on the home page of each virus module, which also includes links to help documents, other NCBI resources, and relevant external resources (for an example, please see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/dengue/). To access the search interface from the module home page, select the link to \u2018Search nucleotide and protein sequences.\u2019 Here, users can select between protein and nucleotide searches (see Figure 1). When searching protein sequences, selecting \u2018Full-length sequences only\u2019 filter, limits retrieved sequences to those with a complete coding region as determined to the relevant reference. The same filter limits nucleotide searches to full-length genomes, where the completeness of a given genome is operationally determined by comparing the genes/proteins present on a given sequence to those on the relevant, full-length reference genome. Currently, non-coding, terminal regions are not included in this determination.\n\nDuring both protein and nucleotide searches, users can define explicitly the genomic regions present on retrieved sequences using drop-down menus that support multiple selections. Additionally, sequences can be filtered using standardized source metadata terms for host, region/country and isolation source using similar pull down menus. The host and country menus are arranged so that aggregate terms are listed in the top portion of the menu and more discrete terms below. In addition to these common filters, there are module-specific filters for species, types, and disease for Ebolaviruses and dengue virus respectively. The influenza virus module also provides some module-specific search options. For example, a user can select \u2018Full length only\u2019 to include sequences with complete coding regions or \u2018Full length plus\u2019 to include sequences with complete coding regions, but no start and/or stop codon. Several other specific filters are also available on the influenza module search interface, such as H and N subtypes, minimum or maximum sequence lengths, and inclusion or exclusion of pandemic H1N1 viruses.\n\nA second set of functions and filters is included within the \u2018Additional filters\u2019 menu. Here users can search for keywords in the GenBank record deflines or strings within sequences. There are also filters to include or exclude laboratory isolates, vaccine strains, and environmental isolates. One can also select specific rotavirus segment types based on assignment by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group (27,28), or by selecting specific sequences by GenBank accession. Once the parameters for a specific search are selected, a user can choose to add the query to the query builder and define another search, or they can go directly to the results. Several searches can be run and added to the query builder where the combination of filters and number of retrieved sequences is displayed for each search. The number of unique sequences can be displayed using the \u2018collapse identical sequences\u2019 checkbox. Individual searches can then be selected and/or combined and sent to the results page for further refinement and analysis.\n\nThe results page supports selection of sequences from the search set for analysis or download. Search parameters are displayed at the top of the results page, and a table displays retrieved sequences and associated metadata. The individual columns within the table can be selected to display specific sets of metadata and hyperlinked GenBank and BioSample accessions (29). BioSample records store an extended set of sample descriptors and are linked to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (30) records, allowing users to easily find sequence read data associated with retrieved GenBank sequences when available. One new feature is the ability to collapse identical retrieved sequences for all viruses as described in the preceding section. When identical sequences are collapsed on the query page, they will be represented by a single sequence on the results page with the number of collapsed sequences shown in the \u2018Identical sequences\u2019 column (see Figure 2). Clicking the arrows in the \u2018Identical sequences\u2019 column displays the individual sequences and makes them selectable. Users can now customize sequence titles including the FASTA defline of downloaded sequences and tree labels using the \u2018Customize label\u2019 tool. The defline can be modified to include various types of data such as the sequence accession number, calculated genomic region, host, isolation source, collection date or country, as well as field-separators such as pipes or slashes. User-selected titles will also be displayed in multi-sequence alignments and trees as described in the following section.\n\nUsers can build multiple sequence alignments or trees from selected sequences, and these in turn can be downloaded in various formats. The influenza module uses previously described tools for these functions (8,13,31), but a new set of tools has been developed for other viruses. Multiple sequence alignments are constructed using an optimized version of MUSCLE, and rooted trees are generated using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with six base nucleotide or amino acid k-mers (32) (see Figure 3). The multiple sequence alignment display includes a navigation map above the alignment, a variation histogram and a consensus sequence. Characters are colored to indicate variable positions. The alignment can be downloaded in FASTA, Clustal, Phylip, NEXUS, or ASN.1 formats. The tree display supports a variety of layouts including rectangular and slanted cladograms, radial trees and circular trees, the image can be downloaded as a PDF, and the tree file can be downloaded in ASN text or binary, Newick, or NEXUS formats. These options are accessible through the \u2018Tools\u2019 menu in the viewer. The data labels on multi-sequence alignments and trees can be customized from the results table before the tree is calculated using the \u2018Customize label\u2019 options, making it easier to identify the distribution of sample/sequence characteristics. When certain download formats are selected, customized labels will be included in the downloaded files (FASTA and ASN.1 for the multiple alignments, and all files for the trees). A URL is also provided to make sharing a tree easy.\n\nThe Virus Variation Resource described here provides a number of features that improve the usability of archival sequence data. The resource now includes more than 20% of the GenBank sequences that are assigned viral taxonomy. Further improvement will be dependent on which viruses are added in the future and on updates to the various pipelines, interfaces and tools so that they can further support user needs. Our plan is to increase the pace at which new virus species are added to the Virus Variation Resource, and we are currently developing layers of data processing \u2013 the least transformative of which could be applied across all viral sequences but still provide basic information about a sequence. The search interface and data displays will be revised so that they better support user-required comparative genomic functions across a much larger number of viral species from the same query page. We also intend to support searches based on author names and more detailed sample information, such as clinical symptoms or laboratory handling. Though we will begin parsing the potentially rich metadata data sets from BioSample records, the success of this effort will ultimately rest on improved community awareness and more consistent submission of metadata to public databases.\n\nGiven the unbridled growth and clear potential of nucleotide sequencing efforts, one must assume the current Virus Variation Resource is just scratching the surface of future bioinformatic needs. The current resource model is suited to viruses that have experimentally validated annotation, and similar modules are in development for additional viral species. However, the vast majority of viruses do not have strong experimental evidence for protein coding regions, making it difficult to build a Virus Variation module including an annotation pipeline. In these cases annotation will need to be inferred from related, experimentally studied viruses, requiring new approaches and better ways of standardizing gene and protein information across multiple groups of viruses. Our current annotation pipeline development is directed toward these goals, and we intend to extend public access to these pipelines beyond our current influenza virus module. We also intend to reveal resource-derived annotation as tracks on multiple sequence alignments, making annotated sequences available for download and improving access to our data sets. This will also enable users to limit downloads and multiple sequence alignments to selected mature peptides for polyprotein sequences, and trees to be built from selected genomic regions.\n\nFinally, there are a variety of enhancements to our tools under development. We are developing improved tree visualizations that support better search and markup functions, similar to those currently used in the influenza virus module. Some limitations of the tree function will be addressed at a later time by giving the user the option of viewing the quick tree which is currently offered, or a more sophisticated combination of MUSCLE-multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. We are also interested in supporting BLAST-based searches within our data sets to support more precise sequence associations. Ultimately, the presumed very large sequencing datasets of the future will ultimately require better ways to evaluate data retrieved from searches which, in turn, will require better integration of search functions with data visualizations such as trees.\n\nMembers of the scientific community are encouraged to contact the NCBI Help Desk (ncbi-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to make suggestions to improve the Virus Variation Resource, or to assist with establishing annotation or metadata standards."}
