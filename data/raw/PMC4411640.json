{"title": "Influence of age, severity of infection, and co-infection on the duration of\nrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shedding", "body": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major viral cause of lower respiratory tract\ninfection in children worldwide [1] with the key\nrisk group being young infants [2]. No vaccine is\ncurrently available for this age group. Development of alternative control strategies\ndepends on the mechanisms of transmission, which are intrinsically related to viral shedding\n[3, 4].\nDetailed data on shedding in individuals in relation to age, infecting subtype (groups A or\nB), infection severity, and gender would help in identifying the source of infant infection.\nSuch data from the natural setting unaffected by sampling bias are limited and absent in\nresource-poor settings. Additionally, this study assesses the impact of the presence of\nother respiratory viruses, prior to or concomitant with RSV, on RSV infection duration. Any\ninteraction might be mediated through direct interference or host immune and physiological\nresponses. These possibilities have received very little attention in the literature.\n\nPrevious studies on RSV shedding have been mainly in the hospital setting limiting the\ngeneralizability of the results [3, 5, 6]. Hospital\nstudies are biased to young children with severe RSV disease and fail to precisely establish\nthe start and, often, the end of shedding, particularly when symptoms do not coincide with\nvirus shedding which is common for RSV [6].\nCommunity-based studies are likely to provide a more complete representation of the RSV\nshedding patterns. Such studies require frequent nasopharyngeal swabbing regardless of\nsymptoms and use of sensitive molecular techniques for viral testing in order to minimize\nthe likelihood of missing infection episodes especially in older age groups.\n\nThe current prospective study utilizes the above approach, with intensive sampling (every\n3\u20134 days), molecular testing, and follow-up of individuals of all ages for one complete RSV\nseason in a rural Kenyan community [7]. This\nprovides for more realistic estimates on duration of and influencing factors on RSV shedding\nwhich are required in designing RSV prevention strategies and to better understand the\nimpact of vaccination on RSV transmission dynamics.\n\nNPS were collected and tested for RSV (groups A and B) and other respiratory viruses\n[adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43)] using real-time\nmultiplex PCR as described previously [7]. In\norder to establish the genetic similarity of the RSV strains in suspected repeat\ninfections, the ectodomains of the RSV attachment (G) protein gene were sequenced and\nanalysed phylogenetically [9].\n\nThe authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical\nstandards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation\nand with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.\n\nData were analysed using Stata version 11.2 (StataCorp, USA). The infection data were\ninterval-censored and three possible durations of viral shedding were estimated, i.e.\nminimum, midpoint and maximum, as described in the Supplementary online material and shown\nin Figure S1. An RSV infection episode was defined as the period within which an\nindividual provided specimens which were PCR positive for the same infecting RSV group\nwith no more than 14 days separating any two positive samples. Episodes where the first\nsample was positive for both RSV groups A and B counted as one infection episode. Episodes\nwhere no samples were collected for >7 days before or after the infection episode\nwere considered left- or right-censored, respectively. Symptomatic infection was defined\nas the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: cough, nasal discharge/blocked\nnose, or difficulty in breathing at any time during the infection episode. Co-infection\nwas assigned when within the RSV episode any sample was PCR positive for another virus,\ni.e. coronavirus, rhinovirus, or adenovirus. Presence of these viruses in the samples\ncollected in the period of 14 days prior to start of RSV episodes was also defined.\nHousehold outbreak was defined as a period within which more than one individual episodes\noccurred in members of the same household without an interval of \u2a7e14 days in which a\nPCR-positive specimen was absent from the household. The proportion of the household\nmembers infected during household outbreaks measured the intensity of the outbreak.\n\nCox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors influencing the rate of\nloss of virus detection (hereafter referred as the recovery rate). The effect of\nleft-censoring was accounted for in the multivariate model by including a dummy variable\nor by excluding the left-censored episodes.\n\nOf the 493 individuals in the 47 households followed, 179 (36\u00b73%) had at least one RSV\ninfection from 40 (85\u00b71%) different households. The median age (interquartile range; IQR)\nat the start of the first observed infection was 6\u00b75 (IQR 2\u00b74\u201314\u00b75) years, and females\nnumbered 96 (53\u00b76%) (Table 1). \n\nA total of 205 infection episodes were observed with 155 individuals experiencing one\nepisode, 22 with two episodes and two individuals experiencing three episodes (Fig. 1). RSV group A was associated with 88 infection\nepisodes, RSV group B with 113 while seven episodes were co-infections. There were 177\n(86\u00b73%) fully observed episodes while 11 and 15 infection episodes were left- and\nright-censored, respectively, and two episodes were both left- and right-censored. Of the\n24 individuals with two or more episodes (suspected repeat infections), 17 (70\u00b78%) were\ninfected with the same RSV group and otherwise all except one group A infection followed\ngroup B. The mean age at the first infection for individuals with RSV group A and group B\nwas 2\u00b73 and 7\u00b72 years, respectively. The duration between the episodes ranged from 17 to\n54 days with median of 28 days. For the 17 homologous infections, sequencing of the RSV G\ngene was successful in 10 (59%) of the 18 possible pairs of samples (one individual had\nthree suspected RSV episodes). The failure to sequence was mainly in samples with a PCR\ncycle threshold (Ct) value of > 28\u00b70, an indicator of low viral load.\nOnly one of the successfully sequenced paired samples showed nucleotide differences: 13\nnucleotide differences associated with three non-synonymous changes and a change in the\nstop codon position. The episodes in this individual (ID no. 1803 in Fig. 2) occurred 54 days apart. For the purposes of estimation of the\nshedding duration, all the episodes were considered distinct. \n\n\nFrom the 205 infection episodes, the mean duration of shedding based on minimum, midpoint\nand maximum estimates were 8\u00b76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7\u00b75\u20139\u00b77], 11\u00b72 (95% CI\n10\u00b71\u201312\u00b73) and 14\u00b70 (95% CI 12\u00b78\u201315\u00b72) days, respectively, for all RSV episodes (Fig. 3). The corresponding mean durations of shedding\nfor the \u2018fully observed\u2019 episodes were 8\u00b72 (95% CI 7\u00b71\u20139\u00b74), 10\u00b79 (95% CI 9\u00b78\u201312\u00b71) and\n13\u00b76 (95% CI 12\u00b74\u201314\u00b78) days, respectively (Table\n2). Twenty-four individuals shed RSV for \u2a7e21 days, and of these 10 (41\u00b77%) were\naged <1 year, six (25\u00b70%) were aged 1\u20134 years, and eight (29\u00b72%) aged 5\u201317 years.\nTwenty-two (91\u00b77%) of these infection episodes were symptomatic throughout or at some time\npoint during the shedding. The prolonged shedders contributed 647\u00b75 days of RSV shedding\nwhich was 29\u00b77% of the cumulative shedding duration for all episodes based on the midpoint\nestimation. \n\n\nIn 14 infected individuals, one or more samples were identified to contain both RSV\ngroups A and B. The timing of these co-detections is shown in Figure 4. In most (12/14) episodes, RSV group A was shed for longer\nduration relative to group B. \n\nThe hazard ratios (HRs) for the various factors from univariate Cox regression were\nsimilar for minimum, midpoint and maximum estimates data (Supplementary Table S1). The\nmidpoint data were taken forward for the multivariate analysis and the final model is\nreported in Table 3. The results were similar\nwithout and with inclusion of the left-censored RSV episodes (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S2, respectively). The\nproportionality assumption in the Cox regression model was not violated based on the test\nof the Schoenfeld residuals (Supplementary Table S3). \n\nThe rate of recovery from RSV infection was age-dependent. The adjusted HR (aHR) were\n1\u00b798 (95% 1\u00b730\u20133\u00b702), 1\u00b782 (95% CI 1\u00b716\u20132\u00b787), 2\u00b710 (95% CI 1\u00b720\u20133\u00b766) and 1\u00b731 (95% CI\n0\u00b736\u20134\u00b781) in the 1\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201339 and \u2a7e40 years age groups, respectively, relative to\ninfants (<1 year). The rate of recovery was lower by 44% in symptomatic infections\nrelative to asymptomatic infections (aHR 0\u00b756, 95% CI 0\u00b740\u20130\u00b779). The presence of one or\nmore additional viruses (rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus) was detected in 86 RSV\ninfection episodes. The rate of RSV recovery was lower (i.e. shedding duration increased)\nby 65% in episodes with co-infection compared to those without (aHR 0\u00b735, 95% CI\n0\u00b723\u20130\u00b751), with a similar result for each virus individually. Detection of infection with\nany one or more of rhinovirus, adenovirus or coronavirus, in the 2 weeks preceding the\nstart of RSV infection, but not during the RSV episode itself, was associated with a 56%\nincrease in the rate of recovery (i.e. reduced shedding duration) from the RSV infection\n(aHR 1\u00b756, 95% CI 1\u00b702\u20132\u00b739). In contrast, RSV episodes associated with detection of other\nviruses in the 2 weeks prior to and also during the RSV infection were associated with a\n52% decrease in the rate of recovery relative to those with no other virus prior to and\nduring the RSV episode (aHR 0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b732\u20130\u00b773). The rate of recovery of RSV episodes\nassociated with spread in the household (outbreaks) was 42% lower than the single\nhousehold episodes (aHR 0\u00b758, 95% CI 0\u00b743\u20130\u00b778). A variable denoting the proportion of\nindividuals infected during the household outbreak improved the model fit and was used in\nthe multivariate analyses (likelihood ratio test P = 0\u00b70229).\n\nThe rate of recovery did not differ significantly by gender and infecting RSV group (aHR\n0\u00b797, 95% CI 0\u00b777\u20131\u00b723 and aHR 1\u00b707, 95% CI 0\u00b783\u20131\u00b739, respectively). Recovery rate was\nsimilar in suspected repeat infections compared to the first observed episodes (aHR 0\u00b791,\n95% CI 0\u00b753\u20131\u00b756).\n\nWe observed 205 infections with RSV during one epidemic with a most realistic estimate of\n11\u00b72 (95% CI 10\u00b71\u201312\u00b73) days of shedding. The most conservative and least conservative\nestimates were 8\u00b76 days and 14\u00b70 days, respectively. The duration of shedding based on the\nmost realistic estimate decreased with age: 18 days in infants and 9 days in adults (aged\n\u2a7e15 years). Symptomatic infections on average had longer virus shedding of 13\u00b75 days\ncompared to 7\u00b78 days in asymptomatic episodes. The presented average durations of virus\nshedding are longer than published estimates of 6\u00b77 days [4], 3\u00b74\u20137\u00b74 days [10], 3\u00b79 days [11], and 4\u00b75 days [12] which could be attributed to differences in study methods. The present study was\ninformed by critical review of the previous studies and it incorporated frequent sampling\nregardless of symptoms and screening by highly sensitive PCR methods. The specimen\ncollection procedure was acceptable, recording a good compliance across all ages [7, 13]. The use\nof the sensitive viral detection method (PCR) results is likely to result in longer\nestimates of shedding.\n\nA community study nested within a birth cohort in coastal Kenya targeting symptomatic RSV\ninfections by Okiro and colleagues reported a mean duration of shedding of 4\u00b75 days [12]. Our corresponding estimate in symptomatic cases\nwas 13\u00b75 days. In a subset of the children whose start of symptoms could be established from\nthe clinic records, the Okiro et al. study reported a longer duration of\n7\u00b77 days [12]. Given that RSV shedding has been\nreported to start before illness [6], the actual\nduration in the symptomatic children would have been an underestimate and our estimate of\n13\u00b75 days is likely to be more accurate. A Rochester family study, in the USA, with similar\ndesign as the present study (collecting samples every 3\u20134 days regardless of symptoms)\nreported lower estimates of duration of shedding of 3\u00b74\u20137\u00b74 days [10]. The Okiro et al. and Rochester study used the\nimmunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and culture, respectively, which are less sensitive\nmethods [14]. As a counter argument, it is not\nknown to what degree PCR positivity equates with shedding of viable and infectious virus.\nThus, while the molecular methods might be more sensitive, the resultant increase in\nduration of shedding over more traditional methods such as culture (which directly measures\nviral infectivity) may not necessarily translate to increased period of infectivity. Further\nwork relating virus infectiousness and detectability is warranted. In the Okiro et\nal. study, sampling started when participants were symptomatic and stopped at the\nfirst negative follow-up sample. The present study revealed instances where negative samples\narose within RSV infection episodes. Even though this observation raises, again, questions\non the relationship between infectivity and shedding duration, accounting for periods of\nRSV-negative samples would still result to longer shedding duration compared to previous\nestimates. Alternative estimation of the shedding patterns by calculating the area under the\nCt (viral load) curve would have some additional advantages and will be\nexplored in future.\n\nProlonged shedders of > 3 weeks' duration have been reported [6, 10]. In the present study,\n24 (13\u00b74%) episodes in the 179 infected individuals involved shedding RSV for >3\nweeks. Most (22, 91\u00b77%) of these episodes were symptomatic, and occurred in young children\n(median age 14\u00b77 months). Individuals with compromised immunity have been known to shed RSV\nfor longer [15] but participants in the current\nstudy were not tested for HIV. The HIV prevalence in women and men aged 15\u201349 years in\ncoastal Kenya was 4\u00b72% according to the Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey of 2008/2009\n[16]. In settings where HIV prevalence is high,\nthe effect of the poor viral clearance might influence the temporal epidemiology as was\nobserved in South Africa [15]. There was no obvious\nmalnourished participant in the study cohort based on mid-upper arm circumference\nmeasurements.\n\nMore than two RSV episodes were observed in 24 (13\u00b74%) individuals. On average, the\nepisodes were 4 weeks apart. Most (70\u00b78%) of the suspected repeat infections were with\nhomologous RSV group. Sequencing of the most variable region of the RSV genome, the\nectodomain of the G gene, did not greatly assist in resolving the infection episodes as most\n(9/10) had identical sequences. It is, thus, not clear whether the two phases of RSV\nshedding were repeat infections with the same variant or were persistent infection with\nperiods of low viral load that was undetectable by the methods used. Using post-mortem lung\ntissue from infants, RSV RNA has been detected even in children dying during inter-epidemic\nperiods suggesting the persistence of RSV in the lungs of these infants [17]. Similar observations have been made in\nexperimental infection with RSV [18] and measles\nviruses [19]. The lack of variability in the virus\nidentified in the two phases of infections suggests virus mutation might not be the primary\nmechanism for virus persistence or re-infection. Regardless of whether it is re-infection\nwithin a short period or persistence, the observation represents an interesting phenomenon\nof RSV which has potential importance on our existing view of acute RSV infection, the\ndevelopment of immunity and effects on viral transmission.\n\nThe age of the individual, infection severity, detection of other viruses before and during\nthe RSV infection, and presence of concurrent RSV infections in the same household were all\nassociated with virus shedding. The rate of recovery increased with increasing age, with\nindividuals in 1\u20134 years, 5\u201315 years and \u2a7e15 years age groups recovering 1\u00b798, 1\u00b782 and 1\u00b797\ntimes faster than the infants, respectively. The Rochester family study reported similar\nfindings where longer shedding was observed for children aged <2 years compared to\nthose aged 2\u201316 years (9 vs. 4 days). The Okiro et al.\nstudy did not find any association with age but found that children with previous RSV\ninfection (using the assumption that those aged >3 years were by default experiencing\na repeat infection) had 1\u00b737 times faster rate of recovery compared to those without a\nhistory of infection [12]. In the present study, a\nsubsequent RSV infection during the same RSV season was not significantly associated with\nreduced shedding duration, but such infections were few (n = 24). The\ncurrent study is for one epidemic only, so age must act as a proxy of exposure to RSV in\nearlier epidemics. Prolonged shedding enhances the possibility of person-to-person\ntransmission and makes young children a potential source of community spread of infection,\nboth of which have important implications in the control and prevention of RSV infection.\n\nA study involving 23 hospitalized children (aged <2 years) with sampling extended\nbeyond discharge reported an association of duration of shedding and symptom severity [4]. Children with lower respiratory tract infection shed\nfor longer than those with upper respiratory tract infection (8\u00b74 vs. 1\u00b74\ndays). Duration of shedding may be related to severity of disease but evidence is\ncontroversial on the link between disease severity and viral load [5, 20\u201322].\n\nAn interaction between detection of other viruses (i.e. coronavirus, rhinovirus,\nadenovirus) in the nasopharynx and rate of recovery from RSV infection was observed.\nRecovery from a viral infection just prior to RSV might have led to up-regulation of innate\nviral immunity or non-specific cross-reactivity that reduced subsequent RSV shedding.\nPresence of co-infections might be a marker of low immunity associated with poor viral\nclearance. RSV episodes with concurrent spread in the household were associated with\nincreased recovery rate. However, any conclusions other than association cannot be made\nsince the extended duration of shedding increases the risk of both co-infection with other\nviruses and multiple RSV infections in the household. A different estimation framework is\nrequired to untangle these results.\n\nThe problems of ascertainment and analysis (i.e. censoring and test sensitivity) are not\ncompletely eliminated by the careful study design, but did not seem to affect the\nassociation of the examined factors with virus shedding (Supplementary Table S1). Short RSV\ninfections occurring between specimen collections particularly in older individuals might\nhave been missed but this is likely to be at random and bias hazard ratios towards null.\n\nIn conclusion, this study defines RSV shedding patterns in the natural setting with\nsignificant potential for improved understanding of the spread of this important virus and\nwith relevance the design of control programmes."}
