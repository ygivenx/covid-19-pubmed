{"title": "Molecular basis for the evolution of species-specific hemoglobin capture by pathogenic 1 Staphylococcus 2", "body": "Animals possess a variety of molecular factors that effectively sequester essential metals from 35 invasive microbes, contributing to an innate immune function termed nutritional immunity (1, 2). Iron, as 36 a critical cofactor for many host and bacterial enzymes, has provided the paradigm for our current 37 understanding of nutritional immunity. Since the discovery of iron limitation by egg white ovotransferrin 38 in the 1940s (3), mechanisms underlying nutritional immunity and bacterial iron scavenging have been 39 the subject of intense study (4). Many vertebrate-associated bacteria encode high affinity uptake systems 40 targeting heme, an abundant iron-containing porphyrin cofactor (5). 41\n\nThe most abundant source of heme-iron in the mammalian host is hemoglobin, which mediates 42 oxygen transport within circulating erythrocytes. The predominant adult hemoglobin consists of a tetramer 43 containing two \u03b1-globin and two \u03b2-globin protein subunits, each of which binds a single heme molecule 44 signatures of positive selection. Because globin genes have been shown to undergo gene conversion 94 which can distort inferred phylogenetic relationships, all analyses were performed using both a well-95 supported species tree as well as gene trees generated using PhyML. All tests detected significant 96 evidence of positive selection acting on both \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin using both species and gene phylogenies 97 (Supplemental Data) . Multiple iterations repeatedly identified two sites in \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin exhibiting strong 98 signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1A) . It was immediately apparent that these rapidly-evolving sites 99 localized to similar regions of the \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin proteins, specifically the N-terminal A helix and the 100 hinge region between the E and F helices ( Figure 1B ). In fact, the two sites exhibiting signatures of 101 selection in the \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin A helices are at homologous positions. These parallel signatures of 102 selection between \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin could indicate that a similar selective pressure has driven this 103 divergence between primate species. To investigate whether bacterial heme scavenging receptors could 104 be one such pressure, rapidly evolving sites were mapped onto a recently solved co-crystal structure 105 between human hemoglobin and the IsdB protein from S. aureus. Notably, all four residues are localized 106 to the IsdB binding interface, in close proximity to the NEAT1 domain ( Figure 1C ). Together these findings 107 indicate that primate globins have undergone rapid divergence at specific sites proximal to the binding 108 interface with Gram-positive bacterial hemoglobin receptors. 109 110 111 All rights reserved.

An established biochemical assay 125 was used to measure binding of hemoglobin by S. aureus, in which S. aureus cells recognize recombinant 126 human hemoglobin as well as hemoglobin purified from blood in an IsdB-dependent manner 127 (Supplemental Figure 1 ). S. aureus exhibited significantly reduced binding of baboon and marmoset 128 hemoglobin to the cell surface ( Figure 2A) . It was noted that binding patterns do not strictly match 129 predictions based on host phylogeny, suggesting discrete large-effect substitutions in hemoglobin may 130 contribute disproportionately to recognition by S. aureus. We next determined the ability of primate 131 hemoglobins to support growth of S. aureus as the sole iron source. Consistent with whole-cell binding 132 data, hemoglobins that were bound by S. aureus with low affinity were unable to support optimal bacterial 133 growth, indicating that the capability to bind hemoglobin is a measure of the ability to utilize hemoglobin 134 as an iron source ( Figure 2B ). \n\nThe identification of rapidly evolving sites at the IsdB binding interface in both \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-149 globin suggest that natural selection in primate globins has been driven by antagonistic evolutionary 150 conflicts with related families of bacterial receptors during primate divergence. Mechanistically, these 151 findings also suggest that both globins contribute to S. aureus species-specific hemoglobin capture. We 152 therefore exploited the enhanced binding of human hemoglobin relative to baboon to examine the role of 153 each globin subunit in this biochemical interaction. The ability of S. aureus to bind chimeric hemoglobins 154 was measured, which revealed that both globins contribute to species-specificity ( Figure 3A ), as chimeras 155 containing either human \u03b1-or \u03b2-globin were bound more effectively than baboon hemoglobin. However, 156\n\n\u03b1-globin appears to have a greater effect on human-specific capture, as the \u03b1-human \u03b2-baboon chimera 157 was bound significantly better than \u03b1-baboon \u03b2-human. Focusing on phylogenetic variation at the protein 158 binding interface, \u03b1-globin T8 and N78 are both proximal to the NEAT1 domain of IsdB ( Figure 3B , 3C). 159\n\nMutagenesis of the N-terminal alpha helix of human \u03b1-globin revealed that substituting the Lys of baboon 160 at position 8 significantly reduced binding by S. aureus ( Figure 3D ). Additionally, substituting A5D, T8K, 161 and N9H in human \u03b1-globin, which converts this 7 amino acid region to that of baboon, leaves S. aureus 162 binding indistinguishable from that of baboon hemoglobin. These results demonstrate that the N-terminal 163 helix of \u03b1-globin makes a major contribution to S. aureus hemoglobin specificity. Next, the relative 164 importance of the rapidly evolving N78 residue in \u03b1-globin was assessed, which lies N-terminal to the 165 sixth alpha helix ( Figure 3B ). Substitution of N78 to glutamine (present in baboon, talapoin, and other Old 166 World primates) or to histidine, reduced binding of human hemoglobin ( Figure 3E ). Thus, substitutions at 167 multiple residues in \u03b1-globin that exhibit signatures of repeated positive selection disrupt the ability of S. 168 aureus to recognize human hemoglobin. 169 9 170 All rights reserved.

Therefore, the contribution of rapidly evolving residues in \u03b2-globin to this 183 binding interaction were investigated ( Figure 4A ). Both S9 and A76 interact closely with the NEAT1 184 domain of IsdB ( Figure 4B ). The effect of substituting human \u03b2-globin S9 and A76 with residues found in 185 other primate species analyzed in this work was systematically tested, which revealed that A76 is 186 particularly important for binding by S. aureus ( Figure 4C ). Notably, baboon hemoglobin displays 187 phylogenetic variation at both position 9 and 76, suggesting that these residues may contribute to the 188 inability of IsdB to bind baboon hemoglobin. This variance might also explain the binding affinity 189 differences between human hemoglobin and the \u03b1-human \u03b2-baboon chimera, observed in Figure 3A . As 190 for \u03b1-globin, no single residue substitution improved binding by S. aureus IsdB, consistent with the idea 191 that IsdB has specifically adapted to bind human hemoglobin. Taken together with earlier data, residues 192 at the IsdB interface of both \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin contribute to recognition of hemoglobin by S. aureus. 193 This is consistent with the NEAT1 domain of multiple IsdB monomers engaging in hemoglobin capture 194 by binding both \u03b1-and \u03b2-globins, as observed in the co-crystal structure (22). 195 All rights reserved.

The IsdB NEAT1 subdomain 206 Q162R-S170T is critical for hemoglobin recognition and is completely conserved among more than three 207 thousand S. aureus clinical isolates (11). Therefore, IsdB variation among congeneric S. argenteus and 208 S. schweitzeri was assessed. These recently diverged taxa ( Figure 5A ) are both primate-associated and, 209 unlike most other staphylococci, encode IsdB. We measured the ability of IsdB from S. argenteus and S. 210 schweitzeri to bind hemoglobin by expressing them ectopically in S. aureus. Consistent with their overall 211 high sequence identity, S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus IsdB bind primate hemoglobin with a similar 212 pattern of species preference as S. aureus ( Figure 5B ). However, both the IsdB of S. schweitzeri and S. 213 argenteus display reduced binding of talapoin hemoglobin, and S. argenteus IsdB does not bind 214 marmoset significantly worse than human. These data indicate that variation among IsdB impacts 215 species-specific hemoglobin capture. 216 All rights reserved.

Closer examination of the Q162R-S170T region of IsdB NEAT1 revealed variation between 227 related staphylococci, but no variation in the critical heme-binding region of NEAT2 ( Figure 6A ). This 228 region of NEAT1 closely interacts with the N-terminal helices of either \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin, in close 229 proximity to both discrete sites bearing signatures of adaptive evolution in \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin ( Figure  230 6B). To determine the functional consequences of variation in this NEAT1 domain, Q162 and S170T 231 were mutagenized in S. aureus IsdB to mimic the sequence of S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus. Variations 232 at both of these positions reduced affinity for human hemoglobin, showing that in the context of S. aureus 233 IsdB, Q162 and S170 are required for high affinity hemoglobin binding ( Figure 6C ). 234 235 All rights reserved.

Most staphylococci are 254 commensal organisms, while S. aureus is uniquely adapted to infect deep tissue and cause disease. As 255 such, the IsdB system is only encoded by S. aureus and closely related primate-associated 256 staphylococci. By narrowing our analysis of hemoglobin evolution to primates, we are thus able to assess 257 specific biological features of primate-associated staphylococci. 258\n\nAn outstanding question in the study of S. aureus evolution has been determining the selective 259 pressures responsible for human-specific virulence factors. S. aureus asymptomatically colonizes the 260 anterior nares of approximately one third of the human population, yet is capable of causing a wide range 261 of invasive diseases. While some bacterial colonization factors have been implicated in pathogenesis, 262 many virulence factors have evolved highly specific targets that are not obviously involved in nasal 263 colonization (41). Additionally, transmission has been proposed to be a selective pressure that enhanced 264 All rights reserved.

As such, we 265 cannot definitively conclude that IsdB evolution has been driven by selection during invasive disease. It 266 is also likely that variation across IsdB of S. aureus, S. argenteus, and S. schweitzeri may be the results 267 of antigenic variation to evade the immune system. By focusing on the hemoglobin binding pocket of 268 IsdB, we have been able to pinpoint critical variation for hemoglobin specificity. Previous studies have illustrated how mutations in hemoglobin coding or regulatory regions can 280 have highly deleterious effects on heme binding, oxygen affinity, and protein stability (43, 44) . In addition 281\n\nto aforementioned sickle-cell alleles, dozens of hemoglobin mutations in humans have been reported 282 that contribute to genetic disease, including anemia and thalassemia (45). Thus, despite identifying 283 particular sites that are highly divergent among primates, much of the globin gene content is constrained 284 due to purifying selection. In future work it would be useful to determine how variation among primate 285 globins impacts other endogenous biochemical functions, such as heme binding and oxygen affinity. 286\n\nSuch insights could improve our fundamental understanding of hemoglobin biology and the mechanisms 287 underlying human hemoglobinopathies. 288 All rights reserved.

These findings provide a fundamental new 290 perspective on vertebrate globin evolution, highlighting nutritional immunity as a selective pressure that 291 could strongly impact divergence and natural selection. Future studies will assist in illuminating how these 292 combinations of adaptive mutations contribute to hemoglobin function and host physiology. 293\n\nUnderstanding the genetic and molecular determinants of bacterial pathogenicity is critical for developing 294 new antimicrobial treatment strategies, particularly as major pathogens like S. aureus continue to develop 295 resistance to existing antibiotics. Combining comparative genetics with molecular experimentation in turn 296 provides not only a historical perspective of host-microbe evolutionary conflict but also mechanistic 297 insights on modern human infectious disease. 298\n\nWe thank members of the Skaar and Barber laboratories for critical evaluation of this manuscript. \n\nThe authors declare no competing interests. 308\n\nAll rights reserved.

Plasmids were transformed into RN4220 by electroporation, re-isolated, and 434 transformed into S. aureus Newman \u0394isdB::erm by electroporation. 435 S. aureus IsdB site-directed mutagenesis 436 pOS1 P lgt isdB aureus was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis by PCR with Q5 Site Directed 437 Mutagenesis (NEB). Primer pairs with desired mutation were used to create Q162R (primers JC315/316), 438 S170T (primers 317/318) and Q162R;S170T (primers JC319/320). PCR products were transformed to 439\n\nDH5\u03b1. Plasmids were isolated and subjected to Sanger sequencing with primers JC228/229 (Genewiz) 440 to identify successful incorporation of the desired mutation. Plasmids were transformed into RN4220 by 441 electroporation, re-isolated, and transformed into S. aureus Newman \u0394isdB::erm by electroporation. 442\n\nSpecific statistical details for each experiment can be found in the corresponding figure legend. 444\n\nData analysis and statistical tests were performed in Prism 6 (Graphpad). 445 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/339705 doi: bioRxiv preprint"}
