During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19.\n\nTo quantify the COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next.\n\nWe assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using direct and total traveller volumes and final destination cities of travellers originating in Iran in February 2019, using data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) (accounting for 90% of global air travel, with the other 10% modeled using market intelligence). As exported cases were identified in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada, we used the methods of Fraser et al (3) to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Iran necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Iran, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are residents of Iran (4) .

We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination countries' ranking on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks.\n\nWe evaluated travellers from Iranian airports (Tehran, Rasht, and Arak) to international destinations in February 2019. While Qom has reported cases, the international airport is currently being built. Global cities receiving the greatest number of total travellers from Iran Given the low rankings for Lebanon and Canada for outbound air travel, it is unexpected that cases should be identified in these countries, but not Iraq, Syria, or Azerbaijan (countries with higher travel volumes but low IDVI scores). Considering traveller volume alone, the odds .

As such, we performed exploratory analyses in which we assumed that an unidentified exported case of COVID-19 was present in Iraq, Syria, Azerbaijan, or all 3 countries, in addition to Lebanon, Canada and UAE and estimated the outbreak size in Iran that would produce these results (Figure 2) . We also evaluated a scenario where we assumed perfect case detection in travelers from Iran, such that disease is truly absent in countries not reporting cases. Under this 'best-case' scenario, the estimated outbreak size in Iran was smaller but still substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases).\n\nGiven the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. Our analysis would be modified by travel restrictions from Iran due to recent political situations, and by variations in the R 0 value. Further, the lack of identified COVID-19 cases in countries with far closer travel ties to Iran suggests that cases in these countries are likely being missed, rather than being truly absent. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics. Supporting capacity for public health initiatives in the region is urgently needed.\n\n.

Vulnerability is measured by the country-level using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index score, with a lower value indicating reduced capacity to respond to outbreaks.
