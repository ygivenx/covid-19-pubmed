{"title": "Discrimination of Kawasaki disease with con comi tant adenoviral detection differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection", "body": "Various studies have been carried out to find out the etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD). Viral infection is thought to be one of the causes of KD, but it is still controversial [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although several potential viral causes of KD are identified, the diagnosis of KD with concomitant viral infection is a little unclear to confirm KD. Adenoviral infection is frequently involved in young children less than 3 years and is characterized with prolonged high fever, upper and lower respiratory tract symptom, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptom with hepatic involvement. Inflammatory biomarker such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are mostly ele vated in patients with adenoviral infection. Because of strong inflammatory response, adeno viral infection closely resembles bacterial infection and KD [5] [6] [7] [8] . Although the majority patients of adenoviral infection presented respiratory condition, extrapulmonary manifestation of conjunctivitis, skin rash, mucous membrane changes, cervical lymphadenopathy and encephalitis can be associated. The various clinical manifestation of adenovirus infections are particularly similar to KD regarding the clinical aspects [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .\n\nA recent study demonstrated the distinction of clinical and virologic characteristics of adenoviral infection differentiating from KD with incidental adenoviral detection 14) . Because of clinical similarities, early and acute diagnosis and intravenous immunoglo bulin (IVIG) therapy are essential to prevent coronary artery abnormalities in KD. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of KD patients with adenovirus detection and those with only adenoviral infection and to identify biomarkers that can differentiate KD from adenovirus infections at the initial hospitalization stage. In addition, we also assessed the clinical and laboratory distinction of KD with adenovirus from KD without adenovirus infection.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective study from August 2012 to June 2016. A total of 129 patients with KD were diagnosed during this period. The diagnosis of KD was established in patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of KD. Typical KD was diagnosed in the presence of fever for at least 5 days combined with at least 4 of the 5 following clinical features; the lip and tongue change, bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, skin rash, erythema and edema of the hands and feet and cervical lymphadenopathy with diameter of \u22651.5 cm. Incomplete KD was diagnosed if the patients had symptoms that were associated with KD met the inflammatory biomarker criteria 15) .\n\nAmong 129 KD patients, respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction was performed in 107 patients. Respiratory virus panel included influenza A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, bocavirus types 1 through 4, coronavirus NL 63, OC 43, and 229E, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus types A, B, and C.\n\nIn addition, we retrospectively analyzed 147 patients with isolated adenoviral infection. The most common symptoms were fever more than 4 days (81.3%), cough (73.2%), sputum (68.8%), rhino rrhea (65.2%). The most common diagnosis at admission was acute pharyn gotonsillitis (57.3%), followed by pneumonia (16.1%), bronchiolitis (12.5%), and gastroenteritis (5.9%). The pharyngoconjunctival fever was initially diagnosed in 12 patients (8.2%).\n\nWe compared 147 patients with adenoviral infection and 11 pa ti ents with KD with adenovirus detection. In addition, we also com pared 11 patients with KD with adenovirus and 87 KD without ade novirus detection. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital (KANGDONG 2018-01-004). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\nAll patients with KD were examined for inflammatory markers such as total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil/ lymphocyte ratio, ESR, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).\n\nIn addition, other laboratory findings such as hemoglobin, serum sodium, serum albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and urinalysis were also assessed. However, BNP was not detected in most patients with isolated adenoviral infection.\n\nRegarding the criteria of typical KD 15) , the acute clinical features such as conjunctival injection, lip and tongue changes, skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, and changes in extremities were also evaluated.\n\nAll of the KD patients were initially treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) for 12 hours and additionally treated with IVIG in case of IVIG resistance. IVIG resistance was defined as a persistent or recrude scent fever for >48 hours after initial IVIG completion. In the case of recurrent or persistent fever with twice IVIG therapy, we managed with the fever with methylprednisolon pulse therapy or infliximab. After the acute phase, all patients have been given low dose aspirin for 8 weeks. Low dose aspirin was discontinued unless the coronary artery abnormalities persisted.\n\nIn all patients with KD, transthoracic echocardiography was performed to define the involvement of the coronary arteries during the acute phase and also at an outpatient clinic at 2-3 weeks and 8 weeks. The coronary abnormalities analysis by echocardiography was performed off-line retrospectively. Echocardiographic recording at 3 different times was reviewed in each patient. Measurement were conducted at the left main coronary artery, the left anterior de scending artery and the right coronary artery. To identify the coronary abnormalities, we assessed the z value of coronary arteries according to the body surface area. We defined the coronary abnormalities as a coronary z score of more than 2.5, the presence of wall irregularity, no acute tapering of the coronary artery branch and saccular or diffuse coronary aneurysm 15) .\n\nContinuous variables were expressed as the median (interquartile range) and categorical variables as either a number or a percentage. For continuous variables, the comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test, or chi-square analysis, as appropriate. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the independent variables as sociated with KD with adenoviral detection using all parameters with a P value<0.05 via univariate analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of KD with adenoviral detection from isolated Korean J Pediatr 2018;61(2):43-48 adenoviral infection and then to derive sensitivity and specificity values for CRP. The cutoff value of CRP parametric variable was determined by ROC curve. A P-value \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nVarious kinds of virus were detected in 42 out of 107 (39.2%) patients in KD. Fig. 1 showed the virus distribution of KD in virus positive patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected (40.5%). Additionally, 12 adenoviruses were identified in KD. Two patients had coinfection: RSV type B and rhinovirus in 1 patient and adenovirus and coronavirus in 1 patient. We excluded 1 adenovirus patient with co-infection of coronavirus.\n\nAmong 129 patients with KD, adenovirus without coinfection was identified in 11 patients. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of KD with adenoviral detection are shown in Table 1 . The median age of these patients was 36 months (range, 5-109 months). Nine patients (81.8%) were diagnosed as typical KD. Most of the KD patients had 4 or more clinical symptoms satisfying the KD criteria, and 2 incomplete KD patients had 3 clinical features of KD accompanied by coronary artery abnormalities. In the laboratory findings, CRP was more than 50 mg/L as a whole. BNP was found to be higher than 100 pg/mL in only 3 patients. AST/ALT elevation more than 45 IU/L was detected in 3 patients and sterile pyuria defined as \u226510 WBC/ high-power field was shown in 6 patients. Four patients had developed coronary artery abnormalities.\n\nWe compared 11 patients with KD with adenovirus and 147 patients with isolated adenoviral infection. Table 2 showed the comparison of clinical and laboratory variables between the 2 groups. In patients with KD with adenovirus detection, the median fever dura tion was 6 days and was not different from isolated adenoviral infec tion group (P=0.356). Regarding the clinical features of KD, lip and tongue changes and skin rash and changes in extremities were more frequently demonstrated in the KD with adenoviral detection group than the adenoviral infection group (81.8% vs. 15.6%, P< 0.001 in lip and tongue changes; 72.7% vs. 36.7%, P=0.007 in skin rash; 63.6% vs. 10.2%, P=0.001 in changes in extremities). We also compared the differences in laboratory parameters between the 2 groups. There were significant differences in CRP (67. 5 Table 3 ).\n\nThe cutoff value of CRP that differentiated adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection was 56 mg/L, which resulted in a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9% (Fig. 2 ). In a total of 129 patients with KD, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with KD who were adenovirus positive (n=11) were compared with those who were adenovirus-negative (n=87). We excluded the patients with other virus isolation (n=31) in the adenovirus-negative group. The age, sex, and fever duration did not differ between patient groups. Fourteen patients (16.1%) in the adenovirus-negative KD group were diagnosed with incomplete KD compared with 2 patients (22.2%) in the adenovirus-positive KD group. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical manifestation of KD and laboratory parameters between the two groups. In addition, coronary artery complications were not different between the 2 groups (36.4% [4 of 11] vs. 33.3% [29 of 87], P=0.868). \n\nOur findings demonstrate that lip and tongue changes, higher serum CRP level and sterile pyuria were significantly related to the adenovirus-positive KD differentiating from isolated adenoviral infection. The cutoff CRP level was 56 mg/L, with 81.8% sensitivity and 75.9% specificity. The development of coronary artery abnormalities was not different between the adenovirus positive group and adenovirus negative group in KD patients.\n\nThis study demonstrated the clinical and laboratory characteristics of KD with incidental adenoviral detection that may help differentiate isolated adenoviral infection. Although the clinical features of adenovirus-positive KD are similar to an isolated adenoviral infection, adenoviral-positive KD usually had frequent lip and tongue change, skin rash and changes in extremities compared to adenoviral infection. However, cervical lymphadenopathy was not differently observed between the 2 groups. In the present study, CRP, hypoalbuminemia and sterile pyuria could be differentiated between the adenovirus-positive KD group and adenoviral infection group. In addition, the cutoff CRP level of 56 mg/L aids in the discrimination of diagnosis of KD from adenoviral infection. This distinct clinical and laboratory pattern was characteristic of adenovirus positive KD. However, high CRP level could also be observed in adenoviral infection with secondary bacterial infection. Although the American Heart Association guidelines suggest that a CRP \u226530 mg/L or ESR \u226540 mm/hr may consider incomplete KD 15) , a recent study demonstrated that a CRP \u226530 mg/L has a lack specificity for KD. Additionally, a higher CRP \u226570 mg/L suggesting the discrimination of KD from adenoviral infection was consistently observed in the KD group 14) .\n\nPrevious studies investigated viral etiology in KD and the role of viral infection associated with KD. Several potential viruses including rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus were detected in KD patients [1] [2] [3] [4] . In contrast, no association of coronavirus and bocavirus with KD was demonstrated in the other study 16) .\n\nAlthough the relationship between virus and KD was not precisely identified, clinical presentation of adenovirus still mimics KD [9] [10] [11] [12] . It remains to be determined whether this virus causes KD with triggering pathophysiology, leading to similar clinical features as adenoviral infection. This study has several important clinical im plications. The early differential diagnosis of KD from adenoviral infection was important to prevent inadvertent coronary artery complications. The suggested clinical features and inflammatory markers could be useful in differentiating KD from isolated adeno viral infection in the early period of disease. In addition, other inflammatory markers such as BNP and procalcitonin should be assessed, because no specific inflammatory biomarker was establish ed during the acute phase.\n\nHowever, there were no significant differences in clinical and laboratory findings between the adenovirus-positive and adenovirusnegative KD groups. The development of coronary artery abnormalities was also not different. Therefore, the adenovirus detection could not be excluded in KD, but might not affect the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of virus associated KD and detection of specific biomarkers of KD are crucial to diagnose and treat without untoward coronary complications.\n\nAlthough we found clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters differentiating adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adeno viral infection, no specific adenoviral type was identified in 11 pati ents with adenovirus-positive KD. In addition, there was no relationship between adenoviral detection and coronary artery abnormality in KD.\n\nIn the study, we did not routinely examine for BNP in the adenoviral infection, so we could not assess the difference between the 2 groups.\n\nThis was a retrospective study and we evaluated a relatively small number of adenovirus-positive KD patients; further prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are warranted to confirm our results.\n\nDespite the similarities between KD and adenoviral infection, clinical and laboratory features can be used to differentiate KD with incidental adenoviral detection from adenoviral infection. Serum CRP can be used as a biomarker to predict KD from isolated adenoviral infection at the early stage of hospitalization."}
