{"title": "Featuring COVID-19 cases via screening symptomatic patients with epidemiologic link during flu season in a medical center of central Taiwan KEYWORDS", "body": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CO-V-2), which is a member of Betacoronavirus. The outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on December 2019, has now rapidly spread over 50 countries. 1, 2 Clinical spectrum of this disease varied from mild to severe. Fever (88%), cough (67%), and fatigue (34%) were the most common symptoms presented by COVID-19 patients 3 which were similar to those with infections caused by other respiratory viruses, such as Influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. 4, 5 For the prevention and control of COVID-19, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons who had a travel history to China and presented fever or any respiratory symptoms within 14 days. Until February 28th, 2105 cases were screened and 34 of them were diagnosed of COVID-19. During this period, 43 suspected patients were admitted to a medical center located in central Taiwan, and two of them were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through multiplex PCR analysis with FilmArray\u00e4 Respiratory Panel, the non-COVID-19 patients were later diagnosed of infections with other respiratory pathogens. Undoubtedly, early screening and diagnosis is crucial for the treatment and control of COVID-19. To establish the diagnostic protocol for this disease, in this report, we comparatively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients with those with other respiratory infections.\n\nDuring January 20th to February 19th 2020, a total of 43 patients who were admitted to China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) met the screening criteria of COVID-19 reported by Taiwan CDC. In the negative pressure isolation room of CMUH emergency room, demographic and travel history data of the patients were collected, and portable chest X-ray and naso-oropharyngeal sampling for viral identification were also completed. For cases reporting of COVID-19 infection, blood tests were performed after their admission to the negative pressure isolation wards.\n\nThe loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the naso-oropharyngeal specimens were performed, using rRT-PCR, upon and 24 h after admission to identify the COVID-19-infected patients. For the purpose of COVID-19 de-isolation, sputum and pharyngeal specimens were examined for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR every 3e7 days based clinical conditions. The specimens collected from each of the admitted patients was incubated with Vero cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium at 37 C for 1 h. Total RNA was extracted from the culture supernatant using MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Manheim, Germany) and subjected to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR. Based on the US CDC guideline, the primers and probes we used for the detection of PdPR, RdRP, and E_Sarbeco genes were RdRP_SARSr-F2-GTG ARA TGG TCA  TGT GTG GCG G, RdRP_SARSr-R1-CAR ATG TTA AAS ACA CTA  TTA GCA TA, RdRP_SARSr-P1-FAM-CCA GGT GGW ACR TCA  TCM GGT GAT GC-BBQ, E_Sarbeco_F1-ACA GGT ACG TTA  ATA GTT AAT AGC GT, E_Sarbeco_R2-ATA TTG CAG CAG TAC  GCA CAC A, and E_Sarbeco_P1-FAM-ACA CTA GCC ATC CTT  ACT GCG CTT CG-BBQ. 6 Respiratory pathogens detection by FilmArray\u00e4 Respiratory Panel\n\nThe nasopharyngeal specimens collected from the non-COVID-19 patients were subjected to the detection of respiratory pathogens using FilmArray\u00e4 Respiratory \n\nThe categorical variable was summarized as n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available data and continuous variable was summarized as mean (SD) or median (IQR). We assessed differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID- 19 \n\nA total of 43 patients suspected with COVID-19 were admitted to CMUH during January 20th to February 19th 2020. Two of them were later confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR. As shown in Table 1 , the ages of patients ranged from 3 to 68 years (mean age of 34.0 years). The male-to-female ratio was 0.65. Of all patients, 23% (n Z 10) came back from Guangdong province, 9% (n Z 4) from Wuhan city, and 2% (n Z 1) from Hubei province areas other than Wuhan city, and 7% (n Z 3) went to other country but transited from Hong Kong airport. Of the 10 patients who had contact history, 4 had close contact with people who visited Guangdong or Hubei province, and 6 had connected to COVID-19 patients. The two COVID-19 patients confirmed in this study had no travel or contact history with people who had been to China but had a family dinner on 27th January with the patient who was the first COVID-19 mortality case (Taiwan NO. 19) confirmed on 15th February. About 44% of the non-COVID19 patients had at least one comorbidity; however, the two confirmed cases, COVID-19 patients A and B, presented no comorbid conditions.\n\nThe first symptom of COVID-19 patient A was sore throat, which developed on the day (28th January, illness day 1; Fig. 1A ) next to his contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient. Productive cough and rhinorrhea appeared on illness day 3. Fever up to 39.1 C and dyspnea developed on illness day 9 and 19, respectively. On 16th February (illness day 20), this patient was admitted to CMUH and diagnosed of COVID-19, as confirmed by positive rRT-PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swab and sputum. Despite of relatively mild symptoms, this patient developed a prolonged and insidious disease course and had gastrointestinal symptoms, presented as upper abdominal dull pain and diarrhea during hospitalization. COVID-19 patient B who also contacted with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January developed fever up to 38 C on 6 days later (3rd February, illness day 1; Fig. 1A ) and had dry cough as the primary manifestation that persisted until illness day 19. During the third sampling on 24th February, the loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the naso-oropharyngeal specimens from COVID-19 patients A and B were both at an undetectable level. However, their sputum was still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient A's sputum remained positive rRT-PCR on illness day 28, and then turned negative on illness day 35. The oropharyngeal specimens rRT-PCR of patient B altered to detectable again on illness day 29 and 33, and sputum rRT-PCR also remained positive at least until illness day 33.\n\nThe most common symptoms reported by both groups included fever (56%) and nonproductive cough (53%), followed by rhinorrhea (37%), sore throat (21%), productive cough (21%), and dyspnea (9%) ( Table 1) . Screening of chest radiographs were abnormal for 55.8% of the 43 patients, mostly interstitial infiltrates. The initial chest radiograph of COVID-19 patient A on hospital admission (illness day 20) was normal without active lesions ( Fig. 2A; left panel) . However, on day 6 of admission (illness day 25), interstitial infiltrates were noted on his right upper lung ( Fig. 2A; right panel) . Left lower lung interstitial infiltrates were revealed by the chest radiograph of COVID-19 patient B on admission (illness day 15; Fig. 2B ; left panel) and persisted for 4 days ( Fig. 2B ; right panel).\n\nBoth the COVID-19 patients had normal white blood cell (WBC) counts without lymphocytopenia and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in the normal range (Table 2 ). Of the non-COVID-19 patients, 83% had normal WBC counts and 29% had lymphocytopenia. The average neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 3.3. No statistically significant differences were found between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups in levels of creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ( \n\nIn comparison with non-COVID-19 patients, no specific symptoms or laboratory data were noted in the early phase of COVID-19 illness. Therefore, the contact and travel history are the main screening criteria for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid detection tools such as FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel can aid in early diagnosis of causative pathogens. As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan. Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended. The confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan belonged to two groups: international migration and locally transmitted. Both COVID-19 patients in this report had no travel history. Upon exposure to Taiwan No. 19 case patient during a family dinner, they were infected. There were two additional family clusters of infections and a cluster of 8 patients infected in a single hospital in Taiwan until 6th March 2020. The reproductive number of COVID-19, ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, 17 was averagely higher than severe acute respiratory symptoms (SARS) in 2003, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 18 Community spread of COVID-19 has occurred in several countries in different continents. China, Hong Kong, Macao, Korea, Italy, and Iran are reported epidemic areas. To prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to expand the exposure risk management to persons who have travel history to epidemic areas, sick or cluster contacts, and to patients who have pneumonia or ARDS without clear explanation.\n\nCOVID-19 is highly contagious. However, 75e80% of patients have mild illness. Patients who have two or more comorbidities, such as COPD, diabetes, and malignancy, are prone to become severely ill or die. 5 Although mild illness without lymphocytopenia was developed in both the COVID-19 patients A and B, who had no comorbid conditions, the loads of SARS-CoV-2 persisted for a long duration (Fig. 1B) . Some COVID-19 patients who were considered recovered after symptoms resolved still carried detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 for 5e13 days. 19 The nasooropharyngeal specimens, collected from the third sampling of COVID-19 patients A and B, showed negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, their sputum specimens collected on the same day were tested positive. Until 6th March, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation room, pending for the latest sputum rRT-PCR results. Despite of mild upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, COVID-19 patient A suffered from diarrhea throughout the illness course. Consistent with the recent study that gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, were developed in some COVID-19 patients. 20 Fecal specimens of these patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Potential fecal-oral transmission in patients with COVID-19 is of concern.\n\nSeasonal viral respiratory pathogens prevalent in Taiwan include Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, 11 which were similar in this study. From the database of Taiwan's CDC (https:// nidss.cdc.gov.tw/ch/), severe influenza infection, in February 2020, had 67 cases, which was a remarkable decrease from, in February 2019, 256 cases. This could be due to the national reinforcement of infection control measures and immigration policy for coping with COVID-19 since the end of January to February 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in the non-endemic patients suspected with COVID-19. All the patients shared similar clinical features and laboratory data. The scope of quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients should be expanded. The application of rapid detection tools, such as FilmArray\u00e4 Respiratory Panel, is highly recommended for the determination of causative pathogens. The long duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the transmission in patients asymptomatic or with mild illness drastically increase the pandemic potential of COVID-19. Owing to the early wave of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Taiwan, our study was limited by the small number of cases for screening and included 2 COVID-19 patients with mild illness. Further studies of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are warranted to illuminate the full spectrum of COVID-19 and the treatment strategy. "}
