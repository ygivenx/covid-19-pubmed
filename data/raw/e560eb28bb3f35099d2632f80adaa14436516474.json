In our study, we also found some cases that had underlying diseases 2 8 8 but without any association with the disease outcome. Age is a risk factor 2 8 9\n\nfor a more severe disease outcome, because of the generally inferior 2 9 0 function of the immune system among older people. Based on the 2 9 1 guideline, the patients who have normal body temperature for more than 2 9 2 three days, mitigation of respiratory symptoms, improvement of 2 9 3 radiological evidences for lesions, and had been tested negative for 2 9 4 specific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at least twice, can be discharged from the 2 9 5\n\nhospital. The average hospitalized time was 17 days (IQR 11.5 -21.5),\n\nand even as long as 23 days for the patients that were released from our 2 9 7 study [5], suggesting the time for SARS-CoV-2 clearance is also around 2 9 8 .
