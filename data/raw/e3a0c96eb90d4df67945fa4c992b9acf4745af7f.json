{"title": "Typing of canine parvovirus strains circulating in Brazil between 2008 and 2010", "body": "Treatment of gastrointestinal diseases comprises a large part of small animal medicine, in which typical clinical signs are vomiting and diarrhoea that can lead to death of the animal (Sellon, 2005) . Among the main viruses that cause diarrhea are the canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV), canine rotavirus (CRV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) (Hoskins, 1997; Tams, 2003) . Since the late 1970s, the CPV-2 strain has been known to be a major etiologic agent of infectious gastroenteritis in young dogs (Appel et al., 1979; Morais and Costa, 2007) . Thus, canine parvovirus, which occurs with high frequency and endures for long periods of time in the environment, has stood out among other diseases because it results in high rates of morbidity and mortality (Hoskins, 1997) . CPV-2 was first isolated in 1978, and since then, it has given rise to new antigenic types that have spread in the dog population (Appel et al., 1979; Morais and Costa, 2007) . Over time, the original CPV-2 has been replaced by its antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b . A strain with an amino acid change, (Asp) -426 to (Glu) -426, in an important antigenic site was recognised in Italy in 2000 and was named CPV-2c (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) . Subsequently, this strain was identified in Vietnam (Nakamura et al., 2004) and Spain . In South America, this new type was first reported in Uruguay (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007) , followed by Brazil (Streck et al., 2009) and Argentina (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2009) . The identification and monitoring of the types of CPV-2 circulating in the canine population are important in the understanding of viral evolution and the development of measures to control its spread. The present study aimed to detect the presence and characterise the types of CPV-2 circulating in Brazil between the years 2008 and 2010.\n\nThe analysis was performed on 144 samples of dog faeces collected in 20 districts of six Brazilian states from April 2008 to July 2010. These animals, which were aged between 1 month and 1 year, included animals with or without symptoms of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), animals with or without a vaccination history and animals from different breeds and both genders.\n\nThe stool samples were diluted to 20% (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4 three times and then centrifuged at 1500 \u00d7 g for 10 min. DNA was extracted from the supernatant using a commercial kit based on guanidine isothiocyanate and silica (Biotechnology Simbios, Canoas-RS, Brazil) as described by Boom et al. (1990) and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until use. A commercial vaccine was used as a positive control and distilled water was used as a negative control.\n\nWe amplified 583 bp of the VP2 gene (position 4003-4585) using the protocol described by Buonavoglia et al. (2001) . The PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels, visualised under UV light and compared with a 100 bp molecular weight ladder (Fermentas, USA).\n\nThe amplification products were purified using GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification (Amersham Bioscience, USA) and sequenced by using the Abi-Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The alignment and analysis were interpreted using the Clustal method with the BioEdit 7.0.0 software (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). The sequences were submitted to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the accession numbers are shown in Table 1 .\n\nFor the phylogenetic analysis, 28 CPV-2 sequences from 14 countries were retrieved from GenBank. Two Brazilian sequences (DQ340434 and DQ340409) (Pereira et al., 2000) and a sequence of feline panleukopenia virus (AB054225), representing the out group, were also included. The Bayesian inference (BI) of phylogeny was performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ). The substitution model for BI analyses was found using MrMODEL-TEST (Nylander, 2002) with the AIC criterion. Four Markov chains, one cold and three heated, were run for 2 \u00d7 10 6 generations, trees were strained every 100 generations and those generated prior to stationary were discarded as \"burn-in\". The posterior probability values for all clades in the final majority rule consensus tree are reported. The support values shown along each branch are Bayesian posterior probabilities (Nodal support values <50% not shown).\n\nSamples were assigned to one CPV-2 type based in the presence of a deduced asparagine (2a), aspartic acid (2b) or a glutamic acid (2c) in the amino acid position 426 (Buonavoglia et al., 2000) .\n\nOf the 144 stool samples analysed by PCR, 29.2% (42/144) were positive for CPV-2 ( Table 1) . Amplification of the partial VP2 gene displayed a single band with the expected 583 bp. Of the dogs examined, 38.8% had haemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), but from the 42 positive samples, 71.4% displayed signs of HGE (Table 2) . From Rio Grande do Sul, 111 samples were analysed, which were from the municipalities of Porto Alegre, Viam\u00e3o, Cachoeirinha, Taquara, Canoas, Caxias do Sul, Passo Fundo, Bag\u00e9, Glorinha, Gravata\u00ed, Santana do Livramento, Lavras do Sul, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Pardo and S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula. The states of Santa Catarina (SC), Paran\u00e1 (PR), S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Rond\u00f4nia (RO) had a total of 33 samples that resulted in nine CPV-2-positive samples. Sequencing the amplification product from the 42 positive samples allowed us to identify nucleotide mutations, although the majority were silent (Table 1) . It was possible to identify 78.6% (33/42) of the samples as type 2c, 19% (8/42) as type 2b and 2.4% (1/42) as type 2a. From the positive animals, 33.3% (14/42) were aged less than 2 months, 47.6% (20/42) had no vaccination history and the 6 animals with a complete immunisation schedule were positive for CPV-2c. Regarding breed, 11 mixed breeds, 6 German Shepherds and 3 Rottweilers were CPV-2c positive and their ages ranged from 2 to 10 months.\n\nIn general, the BI and NJ trees (not shown here) were different because many possible topological resolutions were found, with weak support. Salient features of all trees included that (a) CPV-2 Brazilian variants can be considered to be cosmopolitan, with similar variants in South America, Europe, Africa and Asia and (b) no clear geographic structure was found showing that CPV-2 variants are widely dispersed along the studied area. The BI tree (Fig. 1) showed that the CPV-2 Brazilian variants have clustered into different groups.\n\nSince its emergence in the late 1970s, parvovirus has caused high rates of morbidity and mortality, but the severity was initially attributed to a lack of natural immunity in the canine population against the virus. Therefore, dog vaccination and natural exposure to infection should have improved protection; however, a high incidence of disease continues in animals aged between 6 weeks and 6 months (Morais and Costa, 2007) . This trend was confirmed by data found in the present study, in which 95.2% of the positive animals were between 1 and 6 months of age. Puppies are more prone to the development of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis caused by CPV-2, although dogs of any age, gender or breed may be affected (McCandlish, 1999; Morais and Costa, 2007; Parrish, 1999) . From the 42 positive animals detected in the present study, 12 displayed no signs of HGE, showing that the clinical outcome may depend on the degree of maternal immunity, virulence of the virus strain, infectious virus dose and the host's immune system (Homem et al., 1999; Sellon, 2005; Tams, 2003) .\n\nIt should be noted that in Brazil, canine parvovirus vaccines consist of live attenuated virus (CPV-2 and CPV-2b) and which, although it is rare, may be detected in the faeces of dogs . However, the sequencing analyses of the CPV-2b described in the current study demonstrated that a point mutation at residue position 570 (A-G), which is characteristic of the CPV-2b vaccine strain, was not observed in the present sequences, confirming that the CPV-2b strains detected were not related to vaccination. These data corroborate previous reports that have demonstrated the high stability of the virulence attenuation of the strains used in current vaccines .\n\nGerman Shepherds and Rottweilers were among the breeds of dogs that were CPV positive. These two breeds, as well as other medium and large breeds, are more susceptible and can develop a more severe clinical picture when infected by CPV (Morais and Costa, 2007; Sellon, 2005) . Interestingly, the six animals that had received a complete vaccination protocol were infected by the variant CPV-2c and displayed HGE, which resulted in death for one of them. These data corroborate previous findings in the United States and Uruguay (Kapil et al., 2007; P\u00e9rez et al., 2007) , although it had been shown that vaccination would protect dogs exposed to CPV-2c (Spibey et al., 2008) . However, in field situations, the vaccination protocol and maternal antibody titers are variable and may influence the appropriate response to the vaccine (Sellon, 2005) .\n\nThe Brazilian CPV-2a strain contained the amino acid valine at position 555 of VP2, which has been described by P\u00e9rez et al. (2007) . In the 1980s, CPV-2a strains from many countries displayed the amino acid valine in this position (Cavalli et al., 2008; Decaro et al., 2006) . The Ile555Val change can be considered to be a reversion to the original CPV-2 Pereira et al., 2007) . Comparison of the CPV-2c strains from Europe and Uruguay with those found in Brazil revealed silent mutations in residue 461 (AG) Table 1 Characteristics of the CPV-2 positive dogs in different locations in Brazil, describing the main differences in some nucleotides and amino acids. and 546 (CT) from eleven strains and amino acid mutations in two strains (Pro547Thr and Tyr573Phe). The Brazilian strains did not show the mutation at position 440 (TA) that had been previously described (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2011; Decaro et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2007; Kapil et al., 2007) . The CPV-2c was the main subtype detected in the Brazilian samples, as previously found in the United States (Hong et al., 2007) , Uruguay (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007) and Argentina (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2009) . The detection of CPV-2c in Europe, Asia and the Americas is an indication of the worldwide spread of this new variant in the canine population . Martella et al. (2005) indicated an increasing replacement of subtypes CPV-2a and CPV-2b by CPV-2c that, from 2000 until 2004, increased from 17% to 60% of the samples in Italy. P\u00e9rez et al. (2007) suggested that the rapid spread of subtype 2c was likely associated with an important nucleotide substitution and might lead to the elimination of the other subtypes of CPV-2 over time. In other countries, such as India (Raj et al., 2010) , Belgium and Italy (Decaro et al., 2009) , the predominance of the type 2a strains has been verified. The CPV-2b has a more homogeneous distribution and has been detected in different Brazilian regions and in other European countries, such as France and the UK (Decaro et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2000) . Phylogenetic analysis of the variants circulating in the canine population of some regions of Brazil has shown that they are very similar to those found in other countries and do not indicate a common geographical origin and are thus termed cosmopolitan. In contrast, mutations were detected in two amino acids (547 and 573) from sequences with the accession numbers JF796207 and JF796206, which were not reported in any other country.\n\nThe results of the present study demonstrate that 2c is the main CPV type that circulated in Brazil between the years 2008 and 2010, affecting puppies either with or without a complete vaccination protocol. Most of the positive samples, as identified by PCR, were from dogs with signs of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Phylogenetic analysis of the variants circulating in the canine population of Brazil shows that they are very similar to those from other countries in the Americas.\n\nNo conflicts of interest exist regarding the publication of this paper."}
