{"title": "A Decentralized Molecular Diagnostic Testing Plan for Pandemic Influenza in the Ontario Public Health Laboratory System", "body": "M any Canadian public health laboratories are navigating a comprehensive series of preparations to enable these institutions to effectively detect and diagnose pandemic influenza. The laboratory component of these preparations in Ontario has been guided by the experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1 comments of the members of the Expert Panel on SARS and Infectious Disease Control (i.e., the Walker report), 2 reviews of the published literature on pandemic planning, historic and epidemiologic data from previous pandemics, 1,3-7 and interactions with pandemic preparedness working groups (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cpippclcpi/ann-c_e.html). 8\n\nWithin the next five years, the OPHL will introduce automated molecular diagnostic tools for the diagnosis and characterization of pandemic influenza virus. Appropriate personnel will be trained to use these new tools in four designated OPHL testing facilities chosen based on multiple factors, including: geographic location, population size, and proximity to academic and clinical centres of excellence. Pandemic influenza screening tools will be created to triage specimen testing and to capture the maximum amount of clinical and epidemiologic data. The OPHL will increase pandemic surge capacity through the creation of redundancies in molecular testing capabilities across the province. The resulting system will function not only for the diagnosis of influenza, but also for other pathogens in settings such as sporadic cases, outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. The OPHL is at the start of the second year of a six-year pandemic influenza plan, as described in Table I. The following sections provide the rationale for the OPHL plan.\n\nWhy an automated molecular platform was chosen for pandemic influenza diagnostics Molecular testing was chosen for pandemic influenza diagnostic testing for several reasons. Currently available rapid antigen detection kits have not been validated for avian or pandemic influenza and are not recommended by the World Health Organization for avian or pandemic influenza diagnostics (http://www.who.int/ csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/ labtestsMarch07web.pdf). Culture of all suspect pandemic isolates requires Containment Level (CL)-3 facilities which is not feasible in Ontario (few available approved facilities), whereas molecular methods can be performed in CL-2 facilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/ Section10/Section1027/Section1091_4305 .htm). Molecular tools also allow for the characterization of difficult to culture strains (ProMed-Mail Archive # 20050509.1277) and the detection of drug-resistant viruses as they emerge. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] As of March 2007, OPHL verified a new automated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of influenza A and B. This methodology allows for testing of large numbers of samples with a relatively short turnaround time when compared to culturebased diagnostic methods, 14 (Table II) . These data, and the results of an informal retrospective survey of employee opinion with respect to the concomitant increase in workload during that critical period, indicate that OPHL must develop a testing model and diagnostic capacity to deal with anticipated five-to tenfold surges in testing in the event of a pandemic. Other factors increasing the workload during a pandemic may include multiple sample submissions per patient, 16 and emergence of a pandemic influenza strain in a series of waves or at the same time as seasonal influenza. [17] [18] [19] [20] Why pandemic influenza testing was decentralized to four regions A decentralized testing plan will be effective because a pandemic strain may not affect all regions within a single jurisdiction at the same time. 5, 21, 22 To allow for increased testing capacity and capacity shifting between regions, four molecular diagnostics testing facilities have been created in the OPHL system from distinct regions in Ontario (i.e., Northwestern, Southwestern, Central and Eastern). A key goal is to decrease the transportation time from physicians in the regions to molecular testing facilities across the province. The number of sites was limited to four to prevent over-extension of resources in training of staff and validation of assays, and to limit the amount of work required to ensure competency for the Ontario Laboratory Accreditation (OLA) process. Other criteria for choosing the location of testing sites included accessibility to laboratory staff, proximity to ground and air transportation routes, ability of each individual laboratory to absorb molecular testing, and proximity to a centre of excellence (i.e., a University, College or other institution) for collaboration purposes and continued education of staff.\n\nQuality assurance (QA) in a decentralized system is an achievable goal. Common documentation regarding protocols and policies is maintained by a centralized (Toronto) document information management system. Proficiency of laboratory staff is ensured by continuing education, site visits (audits), a centralized training program, examinations and enrolment into internal and external proficiency testing programs. Since each site is independently licensed, QA documentation must be performed at each site to meet licensing and OLA requirements. Decentralization does incur some additional costs. Redundancy requires additional human resources in multiple locations to verify and validate assays and maintain competency and to ensure clear communications with personnel at geographically distant locations. Travel and shipping costs are also incurred to ensure competency. Year Objectives 1 (near completion) \u2022 four molecular diagnostics laboratories for the OPHL systems will have been established and technologists will be identified and trained \u2022 an automated extraction protocol and a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay will be introduced \u2022 a pandemic influenza pre-analytical screening tool will be created by the OPHL \u2022 one OPHL site will maintain molecular subtyping capability for influenza 2\n\n\u2022 modifications to protocols will be made to increase surge capacity of real time RT-PCR protocols \u2022 automated RT-PCR assays for the determination of antiviral resistance will be introduced into four OPHL laboratories \u2022 commercial respiratory virus panels for the purpose of outbreak investigations will be introduced into one OPHL site for study purposes \u2022 logistic issues surrounding pandemic preparedness will be studied, and yearly pandemic preparedness exercises will be initiated \u2022 communications links will be strengthened with clients 3\n\n\u2022 nucleic acid sequencing for antiviral resistance mutations and virulence determinants will be introduced into one OPHL site \u2022 logistics standard operating procedures (SOPs) will begin to be implemented \u2022 pandemic exercises will be expanded \u2022 functionality of commercial respiratory virus panels will be studied 4\n\n\u2022 molecular subtyping capabilities will be transferred to the remaining three OPHL testing sites \u2022 pandemic exercises will be expanded \u2022 functionality of commercial respiratory panels will be studied \u2022 nucleic acid sequencing for antiviral resistance mutations and virulence determinants will be introduced into one OPHL site \u2022 logistics SOPs will be tested \u2022 yearly pandemic exercises will be expanded \u2022 functionality of commercial respiratory virus panels will be studied 5,6\n\n\u2022 respiratory virus panels for outbreak investigations will have been introduced into all four OPHL testing sites \u2022 pandemic logistics SOPS will be functional \u2022 all four laboratories will have the capacity to identify and characterize influenza strains \u2022 pandemic exercises will be routine \u2022 communications links with clients will be established and resilient ing) sent to CPHL for respiratory virus identification during SARS was two to six times higher than during the pre-SARS period (Table III) . Discussions with OPHL employees working during SARS uncovered the perception that inappropriate preanalytical processes resulted in significant laboratory resources being wasted and may have hampered downstream analytical and postanalytical processes. To prevent this problem from occurring again, the OPHL has compiled guidelines for clients entitled \"Pandemic/avian influenza in suspected cases-specimen collection and transportation guidelines\", available as a \"Labstract\" from the following url: (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/ english/providers/pub/labs/labstracts/ panflu_avian_LAB-SD-015-000.pdf). 23 This communication informs clinicians, public health personnel and other stakeholders of the pre-analytical steps required for a sample to be tested for avian or pandemic influenza (by molecular diagnostics) during the current pandemic alert period. Specimens will only be accepted for pandemic influenza testing if this guideline is followed and all fields of the OPHL laboratory requisition plus additional requested data are supplied and complete.\n\nThe creation of specimen collection and transportation guidelines alone is not sufficient to strengthen communications between the laboratory and its clients. Instead, these tools act as a means of generating discussion with clients, which provide the laboratory with input on preanalytical processes and allow the laboratory to educate the clients on the characteristics of molecular testing.\n\nMolecular technology is highly adaptable, can be effectively scaled-up, and easily transferred, implying that: 1) influenza panels can be utilized as diagnostic tools during the periods of seasonal influenza; 2) trained personnel can undertake molecular testing for other pathogens; and 3) other molecular diagnostic tools can be developed for use in the setting of disease outbreaks, or for a novel non-influenza pandemic or epidemic. The various resources invested now under the umbrella of pandemic planning can be justifiable in highly trained staff and an infrastructure is available for the benefit of patients regardless of whether or not an influenza pandemic arises in the future. 24 Decentralization of molecular testing allows for flexibility within a well-connected laboratory network, and ensures that molecular diagnostic testing continues, even during times of natural or human disasters. 25, 26 \n\nThe expansion of molecular testing capacity to four sites has involved the investment of resources at several levels including: increased human resources funding, increased workspace allotted for molecular testing at all sites, and the restructuring of physical laboratory space at others, purchase of new equipment common to all sites and the development of standardized molecular testing protocols. The ability of the authors to undertake this plan would not have been possible without the support of government, as well as the administrative, financial, technical, scientific and clinical personnel who invested their fiscal resources and time into the development and implementation of the plan.
