All oligonucleotide primers with proper restriction sites were ordered from Invitrogen. The p53dim gene was assembled by overlapping PCR. Synthesis of genes encoding SpyTag, SpyCatcher, and ELP were reported in our previous work. S1-3 The sequence of (GB1) 2 was directly ordered from Genscript Inc. All the genes were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-80L (Qiagen Inc.) by standard restriction digestion and ligation protocols to get recombinant plasmids. Primers for cyclic and linear control mutants were prepared following QuickChange \u00ae Site Directed Mutagenesis Protocol. The following primers were used for mutation to X': 5'-GTTTCGAAGAATTCCGTGAACCGAACGAAGCGCTGGAAC-3' 5'-GTTCCAGCGCTTCGTTCGGTTCACGGAATTCTTCGAAAC-3'.\n\nThe following primers were used for mutation to A': 5'-GCCCATATTGTCATGGTTGCTGCATACAAGCCGACGAAG-3' 5'-CTTCGTCGGCTTGTATGCAGCAACCATGACAATATGGGC-3'.\n\nThe sequences of the genes were verified by direct DNA sequencing.\n\nEscherichia coli strain BL21 for expression. The starter culture was prepared by inoculating 10 mL of 2xYT medium containing 100 \u00b5g/mL of ampicillin with a single colony carrying the recombinant plasmid and allowing it to grow overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a shaker with the speed of 220 rpm. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of 2xYT medium containing 100 \u00b5g/mL of ampicillin and the culture was left to grow at 37 o C until OD 600 nm reached 0.7-1.0. Then, 1 mM of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce the protein expression and the cells were placed in the incubator for another 5 hour at 30 \u00b0C with 200 rpm shaking. Cells were pelleted by spinning at 5000g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cell pellets were lysed by ultrasonication under denaturing conditions (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Tris-HCl, 8 M urea, 10 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0). The protein was purified as described in the Qiagen Expressionist TM using 50% Ni-NTA slurry. The supernatant lysate was mixed with a 50% Ni-NTA slurry S-3 and agitated by the rotator at 4 o C for 1 hr. The mixture was then loaded into an empty column, washed with wash buffer (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Tris-HCl, 8 M urea, 20 mM imidazole, pH = 8.0) for several column volumes and then eluted by elution buffer (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM 8 M urea, 20 mM imidazole, pH = 4.5). Proteins were then purified by SEC. The purified protein solution could be ) and a quadrupole rods SQ Detector 2 mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.). Separations were realized by a protein BEH C4 column (Waters 300 \u212b, 1.7 \u03bcm; 2.1 \u00d750 mm) using ultrapure water (with 0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. For limited proteolysis experiments, digestion was performed with TEV protease at 4 o C for partial digestion and at 37 o C for full digestion, using PBS (pH = 7.4) as the working buffer. The mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and also directly subjected to UPLC-ESIMS analysis.\n\nThe ESI-MS with TWIM separation was recorded with a Waters Synapt G2 mass spectrometer, using 0.7 mg sample in 1 mL of ACN/H 2 O (1:1, v/v) with 0.1% formic acid. The TWIM-MS experiments were performed under the following conditions: ESI capillary voltage, 3 kV; sample cone voltage, 30 V; extraction cone voltage, 3.5 V; source temperature 120 \u00baC; desolvation temperature, 150 \u00baC; cone gas S-4 flow, 10 L/h; desolvation gas flow, 700 L/h (N 2 ); source gas control, 0 mL/min; trap gas control, 2 mL/min; helium cell gas control, 100 mL/min; ion mobility (IM) cell gas control, 30 mL/min; sample flow rate, 5 \u00b5L/min; IM traveling wave height, 25 V; and IM traveling wave velocity, 1000 m/s. Trypsin Digestion. Trypsin powder (Amresco, USP grade) was dissolved in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to prepare a stock solution (10 mg/mL, 0.4 mM). Substrates in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) were mixed with trypsin at a final protease: protein ratio of 1:20 (w/w). Trypsin digestion experiments were performed by incubation at 25 o C for extended time course. After designated times, aliquots were taken and digestion was quenched by adding 5x loading buffer followed by boiling at 100 o C for 10 min. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and further quantified by gel densitometry on Typhoon FLA9500 (GE Healthcare, Inc. In pathway (a), premature cyclization before dimerization gives the cyclic monomer. In pathway (b), the dimerization of X motif entwines the two chains. Depending on the geometry and the linker length/flexibility, four products are then possible, namely (from left to right) the interlocked [2]catenane, the simple cyclic dimer, the knotted cyclic dimer, and the noncovalently associated rings. \n\nFigure S17.
