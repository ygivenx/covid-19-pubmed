(C) Influenza virus replication was examined in NRAV-overexpressing and NRAV knockdown 293T cells by plaque forming assay as described in Figure 2E (F and G) The expression of DYNLL1 in NRAV-overexpression (F) and knockdown cells (G) were determined by qRT-PCR (n=3, means\u00b1s.e.m.). genes (upper) and down-regulated genes (lower) from microarray data indicated that many decreased genes were associated with viral infection or host response to virus.\n\nEnrichment score is calculated as -log 10 (P-value), and P-value is calculated by\n\nFisher's exact test.\n\n(C ) The transient expression of exogenous human IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, MxA or   DDX3X in experiments was determined by RT-PCR at 24 hours post-transfection. For each experiment, 1 \u00b5g expression plasmid is used for transfection (6 well plate).\n\nRepresentative results of three independent experiments are shown.\n\n(D) The DDX3X mRNA levels in NRAV and EV cells were measured by qRT-PCR (n=3, means\u00b1s.e.m.), which was not significantly affected by NRAV overexpression. (G) A549 cells stably expressing NRAV or sh-NRAV or controls were incubated with WSN virus (MOI=100) on ice, and then cultured with warm media for 4 h.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining was performed using an anti-NP antibody to detect entry of NP (red).

(A) Silver staining of input proteins of RNA pulldown assay as described in Figure   6H and From the cDNA microarray data of NRAV-overexpressing cells, 107 differentially expressed ISGs were identified by using the Interferome analysis with parameters human, lung and A549 cell line. 72 down-regulated and 35 up-regulated ISGs are shown.\n\nSequence coverage of ZO-1-associated nucleic acid binding protein (ZONAB) \n\nCells A549, HeLa, K562, 293T, HepG2, SMMC-7721, QGY-7703, BEL-7402, NIH3T3, and Vero were grown in DMEM or RPMI1640 supplemented with 10%\n\n(vol/vol) FBS (Gibco) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) (Invitrogen) at 37 \u2103 in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere as previously described (Guo et al., 2010) . All other antibodies were obtained as previously described (Wei et al., 2014) .\n\nThe reporter plasmid pGL3-MxAP-FF-Luc carrying the firefly luciferase (FFLuc) gene under the control of the human MxA promoter was kindly provided by Prof.\n\nGeorg Kochs, Department of Virology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany (Holzinger et al., 2007) . Primers 5 \u2032 -TTA AAA GGT ACC GAG CCC TGA ACC GGG ACA GTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTT GTC AAG CTT TGG TGT CCA GCG AAG ACC AGC-3\u2032 were used to amplify the IFITM3 promoter from A549 genomic DNA (Shen et al., 2013) . pGL3-IFITM3P carrying the FF-Luc gene under the cont rol of the IFITM3 promoter was constructed by inserting the IFITM3 promoter into the XhoI-HindIII sites of pGL3-basic (Promega). \n\nCell culture supernatant was harvested at 16 hpi or indicated time points. Mouse lungs were collected at 6 dp i and homogenized in 1ml DMEM to prepare tissue suspension.\n\nVirus titers in supernatants were determined by a standard Hemagglutination assay (HA) or a plaque forming assay (PFU) on MDCK cells as described previously (Wang et al., 2012) .\n\nThe microarray experiments were performed as described previously (Guo et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012) . \n\nNon-coding potential is performed through several programs as described previously (Guo et al., 2014) .

Primers were designed according to the sequences in database of UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu) or NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The stable NRAV-overexpressing cells lines were constructed with a retroviral expression system as described previously (Qiu et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2013) .\n\nThe expression construct is modified by inserting a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH-po lyA) sequence from pcDNA3.1 into XhoI-EcoRI sites before the GFP coding sequence in the vector. The stable knockdown cells of NRAV were generated using a shRNA-based lentivector system pSIH-H1 (System Biosciences) as provider's protocol. The shRNA target sequences used in this paper are sh-NRAV-1: GCC CTT CAG AGT TGT TAC T, sh-NRAV-2: CCT CCG AAC AGA GTA ATG T.
