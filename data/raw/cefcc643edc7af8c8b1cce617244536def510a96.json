{"title": "Regulation of Autophagy by Extracellular Signal- Regulated Protein Kinases During 1-Methyl-4- Phenylpyridinium-Induced Cell Death", "body": "zymes are observed in Alzheimer's disease, 18, 19 and increased nigral AVs are observed in Parkinson/Lewy body disease. 8, 20 Autophagy is elicited in several neurodegeneration models, contributing to degradation of mutant \u2423-synuclein and huntingtin. 6, 13, 21 Dysregulated autophagy may also contribute to developmental and pathological cell death, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and autophagic processing of prion and \u2424-amyloid precursor proteins has been implicated in dementia. 31, 32 Thus, a better understanding of autophagy regulation under different stress situations is needed.\n\nAutophagy is classically elicited by nutrient deprivation, and much is known about starvation-induced autophagy. A series of autophagy genes (Atg) have recently been identified. 33 Autophagy is initiated by conjugation of Atg12, Atg5, and Atg8/microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) to the nascent autophagosome membrane. Upstream signals that regulate bulk phase starvation-or trophic deprivation-induced autophagy include Vps34, a class III PI3K, complexed with beclin 1 (Atg6). 34, 35 Less is known about the signaling regulation of autophagic responses during pathological neuronal injuries.\n\nIn this study, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP \u03e9 ) was used to elicit mitochondria-targeted injury. MPP \u03e9 elicited a robust autophagic response in injured SH-SY5Y cells and primary dopaminergic neurons, which was not diminished by pharmacological and RNA interference treatments that inhibited starvation-induced autophagy. In contrast, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases reduced MPP \u03e9 -elicited AVs, indicating that the upstream regulation of autophagic responses is context dependent. Under physiological conditions, limiting amounts of beclin 1 prevents harmful overactivation of autophagy. 36 In this pathological model, stimulation of beclin 1-independent autophagy is associated with neuronal cell death.\n\nThe SH-SY5Y cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), a human neuroblastoma cell line that expresses tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter activities, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkerville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 15 mmol/L HEPES, and 2 mmol/L glutamine (BioWhittaker). SH-SY5Y cells were treated with either medium (vehicle control) or MPP \u03e9 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at the LD 50 concentration (2.5 mmol/L) for 24 to 48 hours. 37, 38 Some cultures also received dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitors UO126 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or PD98059 (Sigma), the c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), the p38 inhibitor SB202190, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), wortmannin (WT), or LY294002 (Sigma). For amino acid deprivation studies, cells were washed three times and incubated in the presence or absence of amino acids in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Cell injury was measured using Alamar Blue (Biosource/Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) or MTS cell viability kits (Promega, Madison, WI), as previously described. 39 \n\nCells grown in 35-mm dishes were fixed for at least 60 minutes in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0C. After fixation, cell monolayers were washed three times in PBS and then postfixed in aqueous 1% OsO 4 and 1% K 3 Fe(CN) 6 for 1 hour. After 3\u03eb PBS washes, the cultures were dehydrated through a graded series of 30 to 100% ethanol, infiltrated, and then embedded in Polybed 812 epoxy resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Ultrathin (60-nm) sections were collected on copper grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol for 10 minutes, followed by 1% lead citrate for 7 minutes. Sections were photographed using a JEOL JEM 1210 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) at 80 kV.\n\nFor LC3 immunofluorescence, SH-SY5Y cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with rabbit anti-LC3 (1:2000) 40 or mouse anti-mitochondrial antigen 60KD (clone 113-1; 1:100; BioGenex, San Ramon, CA), followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After MPP \u03e9 or amino acid starvation, cells grown on coverslips were incubated with 0.05 mmol/L monodansylcadaverine (MDC) in Dulbecco's PBS for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS and mounted on slides. MDC-labeled vacuoles were immediately imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with triple filter cube [4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, fluorescein isothiocyanate, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC), excitation wavelength/emission filter 350 nm/470 nm; 490 nm/520 nm; 541 nm/572 nm, respectively].\n\nMDC images were processed using MetaMorph image analysis software to quantify the size and number of MDC-positive L-AVs in SH-SY5Y cells. Individual cells or small groups of nonoverlapping cells were manually traced with the software. Discrete MDC-positive structures were identified by autothresholding and digitally scored for pixel area, and the number of MDC-positive structures was divided by the number of nuclei to derive the average number of AVs per cell. Based on the observation that each MDC-positive structure closely approximated a circle, the pixel areas were converted to average diameters using the formula: area \u03ed (d/2), 2 where d is diameter, to allow comparison with published diameters of AVs. More than 600 AVs were quantified. In another set of experiments, cells immunostained for mitochondria were analyzed to obtain the pixel area occupied by mitochondria.\n\nCell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail as previously described. 41, 42 Equal amounts of protein, as determined by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), were subjected to electrophoresis through 5 to 15% gradient polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mmol/L potassium phosphate, and 150 mmol/L potassium chloride, pH 7.4 containing 0.3% (w/v) Tween 20 and then probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse anti-phospho-ERK (1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-MAP-LC3 (1:4000), 40 mouse anti-p110 mitochondrial protein (1:500; Oncogen, Boston, MA), mouse anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit (1:2000; Molecular Probes), or mouse anti-beclin 1 (1:500; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep-anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Immunoreaction was detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham). The membranes were stripped as previously described 39, 41 and reprobed with anti-\u2424 actin as a loading control (Sigma; 1:10,000). Densitometric analysis of blots was performed using the electrophoresis documentation and analysis system 120 (Kodak, Rochester, NY). 39, 43 \n\nSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) for human Atg proteins were synthesized by Ambion (Austin, TX), using previously published targeting sequences (5\u0408-CAGTTTGGA-CAATCAATA-3\u0408 for beclin 1 and 5\u0408-GGAGUCACAGCU-CUUCCUU-3\u0408 for Atg7) 26 or by Invitrogen (5\u0408-GCCAGU-GGGUUUGGAUCAA-3\u0408 for Atg7, 5\u0408-GGACGAAUUCCA-ACUUGUU-3\u0408 for Atg5, and 5\u0408-GAAGGCGCUUACAGC-UCAA-3\u0408 for LC3). Using fluorescent RNA oligonucleotides (Invitrogen), we found that 2 l of Lipofectamine 2000 mediates efficient delivery of RNA to SH-SY5Y cells grown in six-well plates, without detectable toxicity. Efficacy and specificity of knockdown was assessed by Western blot, and functional efficacy assessed by LC3 Western blot for all siRNAs except si-LC3, for which MDC fluorescence was used. After optimization experiments, cells were transfected at 50% confluence with 10 nmol/L beclin 1 siRNA, 40 nmol/L LC3 or Atg5 siRNAs, 20 nmol/L Atg7 siRNA, or siControl Nontargeting siRNA Pool (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) 72 hours before amino acid deprivation or treatment with MPP \u03e9 .\n\nAfter buffer or MPP \u03e9 treatment, the cells were incubated with 0.05 mmol/L MDC in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes, washed with PBS, and collected in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Intracellular MDC was measured by fluorescence photometry (excitation wavelength, 335 nm, and emission filter, 525 nm) in a Spectromax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). MDC intensity was normalized to the number of cell nuclei. 44 \n\nThe ventral midbrain was dissected from 15-day C57BL/6 mouse embryos (Hilltop Laboratory Animals, Inc., Scottdale, PA), as described previously. 45 In brief, cultures were plated in poly-L-lysine-coated 16-well chamber slides (Nunc Laboratory-Tek; Fisher Scientific, Agawam, MA) at a density of 2 \u03eb 10 5 cells/cm 2 . After 3 days, fresh medium containing 2 mol/L cytosine arabinoside was applied for 72 hours to inhibit glial proliferation. At 7 days in vitro, MPP \u03e9 was administered at the LD 50 concentration of 5 mol/L, a condition that results in \n\nPrimary cultures from the different treatment conditions were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked using Protein Blocking Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Immunocytochemistry was performed by incubating with mouse anti-TH (1:4000; Calbiochem) and rabbit anti-MAP-LC3 (1:2000) 40 at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes) antibodies. The slides were observed using an Olympus Provis fluorescence microscope (Olympus America Inc.) equipped with the following filter cubes: fluorescein isothiocyanate (excitation 490 nm/emission 520 nm) and TRITC (excitation 541/emission 572 nm). The number of TH neurons was quantified in at least four wells per treatment condition. All TH neurons with a clear nuclear contour and neurites twice the length of the soma were scored as surviving neurons. LC3 immunohistochemistry resulted in two staining patterns: diffuse cytoplasmic staining (basal) and punctate staining (AV-related). The ratio of TH neurons expressing the two LC3 staining patterns was calculated by scoring 100 TH neurons per well.\n\nResults are expressed as mean \u03ee SEM from at least three independent experiments. Two group comparisons were performed using Student's t-test. Multiple group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance and Fisher's least significant difference. Values of P \u03fd 0.05 were defined as statistically significant.\n\nThe ultrastructural features of MPP \u03e9 -treated SH-SY5Y cells were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Compared with media-treated control cells, in which mitochondria represent the prominent cytoplasmic constituent when viewed at low magnification ( Figure 1A ), MPP \u03e9 -treated cells showed few mitochondria. Instead, the toxin-treated cells exhibited abundant AVs at different stages of evolution ( Figure 1 , B and C). Most AVs were in the same size distribution as starvation-induced mammalian autophagosomes (0.5 to 1.5 m in diameter) 33 ; however, larger double-and single-membrane AVs were also occasionally observed ( Figure 1C ). MDC is an autofluorescent dye shown empirically to localize to late AVs/lysosomes (L-AVs) but not endosomes. 46 The dye is trapped in acidic, membrane-rich organelles and also exhibits increased fluorescence quantum yield in response to the compacted lipid bilayers present in L-AVs. 47 MPP \u03e9 treatment increased both the average number of L-AVs per cell and the size distribution of L-AVs ( Figure 2 , A-C; Table 1 ). An increase in average L-AV size has also been reported in Purkinje cells subjected to trophic factor and potassium deprivation. 27 LC3 (Atg8) conjugation to the nascent AV membrane is required for initiation of autophagy. This is a ubiquitin-like reaction involving conjugation of LC3 to phos- phatidylethanolamine. 48 The shift from cytoplasmic (LC3-I) to the membrane-bound (LC3-II) form is accompanied by a shift to a faster migrating band detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 49, 50 MPP \u03e9 treatment elicited significantly increased levels of LC3-II in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 2 , D and E). Increased AVs could also be detected using immunohistochemical staining for LC3. The results derived from MDC staining and LC3 immunohistochemistry were equivalent (for example, see Figure 4 versus Figure 5 ).\n\nBecause a portion of LC3-II remains in L-AVs until degraded, both AV formation and impaired AV degradation can contribute to increased AVs and LC3-II. A method to assess AV induction is to measure LC3-II levels in the presence of an inhibitor of AV fusion/ degradation. 51 MPP \u03e9 caused increased LC3-II compared with control cells in the presence of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of early AV acidification and fusion to lysosomes at doses \u054610 nmol/L 52,53 ( Figure 3A , compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4). The fact that bafilomycin A1 markedly increased LC3-II levels in MPP \u03e9treated cells, compared with MPP \u03e9 treatment alone, also implies that degradation is intact after 24 hours of MPP \u03e9 treatment ( Figure 3A , compare lanes 2 versus 5 and 3 versus 6).\n\nAutophagy is the primary mechanism for organelle degradation. Because the electron micrographs suggest disappearance of mitochondria from MPP \u03e9treated cells (Figure 1 ), we measured mitochondrial content in control and MPP \u03e9 -treated cells using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. These studies show fragmentation of mitochondria and reduction in mitochondrial pixel area in MPP \u03e9 -treated cells ( Figure 3B ; see also Figure 7E for quantitative image analysis). MPP \u03e9 treatment also reduced the levels of the mitochondrial matrix protein pyruvate dehydrogenase and a mitochondrial membrane protein p110 54 relative to \u2424-actin and total protein ( Figure 7D ). Taken together with the bafilomycin data, these experiments indicate that MPP \u03e9 induces autophagic mitochondrial degradation.\n\nPharmacological inhibitors of PI3Ks, including WT and 3-MA, are effective at inhibiting starvation-induced autophagy. 55, 56 However, neither 3-MA nor WT was able to inhibit the increase in AVs/L-AVs induced by MPP \u03e9 treatment ( Figure 4) . Although higher doses of these inhibitors can elicit apoptotic death, the doses used for Figure 7E for quantitative image analysis and Figure 7D for Western blot analysis of mitochondrial matrix and membrane proteins. Scale bar \u03ed 10 m.\n\n3-MA (5 mmol/L) and WT (50 nmol/L to 5 mol/L) had no significant effect on basal SH-SY5Y viability.\n\nIn intestinal cells, it has been shown that class I and class III PI3Ks have differential effects on autophagy. 57 Because lower doses of WT may be more selective at inhibiting autophagy, we tried a range of WT doses. None of these treatments was effective at reducing MPP \u03e9 -elicited AVs/L-AVs ( Figure 4B ). For subsequent studies, 50-to 100-nmol/L doses were used.\n\nBeclin 1 associates with the class III PI3K to induce autophagy. 34 As an alternative method to address the role of the class III PI3K pathway in regulating autophagic responses elicited during MPP \u03e9 injury, we used double-stranded siRNA for human beclin 1 26 to further investigate the potential role of this pathway in MPP \u03e9elicited AVs. Beclin 1 siRNA reduced basal levels of LC3-II ( Figure 5G, left) ; however, neither the negative control siRNA ( Figure 5C ) nor the human beclin 1 siRNA ( Figure 5D ) was able to attenuate the autophagic response elicited by MPP \u03e9 , as assessed by LC3 immunofluorescence (Figure 5B ), MDC staining (not illustrated), or LC3 gel shift ( Figure 5G, right) . Beclin 1 Western blots indicated effective knockdown of beclin 1 protein expression before and during MPP \u03e9 treatment, which was added 72 hours after siRNA transfection ( Figure 5, E and F) .\n\nControl experiments were performed to verify that the beclin 1/PI3K signaling pathway reported for starvationinduced autophagy is intact in SH-SY5Y cells. Deprivation of amino acids resulted in increased autophagy that Figure 6A ). Likewise, RNA interference studies demonstrated that the starvation-induced response required beclin 1 expression (Figure 6 , B and D), whereas control siRNAs had no effect ( Figure 6C) . Thus, the differences in regulation of AVassociated responses probably reflect differences in the initiating stimuli.\n\nIn some cell types, autophagy is regulated by the ERK signaling pathway. 58 Inhibitors of the upstream ERK kinase MEK effectively suppressed the autophagic response to MPP \u03e9 injury as assessed by MDC staining (Figure 7A ), LC3 gel shift ( Figure 7B ), or LC3 immunofluorescence (not illustrated). In addition to reducing the average number of L-AVs per cell, MEK inhibition also reversed the MPP \u03e9 -elicited change in the size distribution of L-AVs ( Figure 7C ; Table 1 ). Moreover, MEK inhibitors effectively blocked the MPP \u03e9 -induced decrease in mitochondrial matrix and membrane proteins ( Figure 7D ) and significantly reduced the MPP \u03e9 -elicited disappearance of mitochondrial immunofluorescence ( Figure 7E ).\n\nThe effect of MEK inhibitors on the MPP \u03e9 -elicited AV response was also studied ultrastructurally. EM studies confirm a decrease in AV-like structures in cells cotreated with MPP \u03e9 and UO126 ( Figure 8C ) compared with those treated with MPP \u03e9 alone ( Figure 8B ). Moreover, swollen mitochondria were prominent in cells cotreated with MPP \u03e9 and UO126, suggesting that the effects of UO126 occurred downstream of the initial phase(s) of mitochondrial injury.\n\nMEK inhibitors conferred significant protection from MPP \u03e9 toxicity ( Figure 9A ; Table 2 ). 59 In contrast, neither , arrows) , cells cotreated with MPP \u03e9 and UO126 contained occasional round, uniformly dense structures (C, asterisks) the significance of which is unclear but could represent highly condensed AVs or early lysosomes. C: Cotreatment with UO126 reduced AV-like structures but did not prevent MPP \u03e9 -induced mitochondrial swelling. Scale bar \u03ed 1 m. pharmacological (3-MA and WT) nor siRNA inhibition of the beclin 1 pathway showed significant effects on cell death in SH-SY5Y cells ( Table 2 ). Low doses of the c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 (Table 2) were partially effective in reducing MPP \u03e9 -induced cell death, LC3-II levels, and degradation of mitochondrial proteins, whereas a p38 inhibitor had no effect on MPP \u03e9 toxicity (not illustrated).\n\nTime course experiments were performed to characterize further the relationship between ERK activation and the AV response in MPP \u03e9 -treated cells. Increased phospho-ERK was observed beginning \u03f38 hours after MPP\u03e9 administration, and increased LC3-II shift was observed by 16 hours (Figure 9B) . Moreover, delayed protection assays revealed that UO126 added up to \u03f312 hours after initiation of MPP \u03e9 injury conferred the same degree of protection as observed when UO126 was present at the beginning of the experiment ( Figure 9C ). However, if the UO126 was added \u03fe20 hours after MPP \u03e9 treatment, cell viability was not significantly different from cells treated with MPP \u03e9 alone. These results implicate AV responses downstream of the ERK pathway.\n\nTo investigate the potential role of AV responses in MPP \u03e9 toxicity, we performed siRNA experiments to knockdown expression of LC3. Cells treated with siRNA for LC3 showed significant protection from MPP \u03e9 toxicity ( Figure  9D ), accompanied by \u03f350% reduction in the levels of LC3-I, inhibition of the MPP \u03e9 -induced LC3-II shift, and a 40% reduction in MPP \u03e9 -induced increases in MDC fluorescence after correcting for siRNA-related suppression of basal MDC fluorescence ( Figure 9E ). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Atg5 and Atg7, two other proteins involved in membrane conjugation necessary for initiating autophagy, also showed significant protection ( Figure 9F ), although to a lesser degree than that seen with UO126. The reduction in cell death was not due to reduction in MPP \u03e9 - Figure 9 . MAP kinase inhibitors and Atg protein knockdown confer protection from MPP \u03e9 toxicity.

MEK inhibition resulted in significant reduction in TH immunoreactive cells displaying LC3-labeled AVs, compared with MPP \u03e9 treatment alone ( Figure 10C ). In contrast, neither 3-MA nor WT decreased the MPP \u03e9 -elicited autophagic response. As observed in SH-SY5Y cells, MEK inhibition conferred protection from MPP \u03e9 in primary midbrain TH neurons ( Figure 10D ).\n\nAlthough autophagy has been most intensively studied in response to limiting nutrient or trophic factor status, a growing body of literature implicates autophagy-related processes in neurological injury and disease mechanisms. Under these circumstances, the AV response may be triggered by damage to proteins or organelles. We found that a robust AV response is elicited in the MPP \u03e9 model of mitochondria-targeted neuronal injury. In both SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in primary mouse dopaminergic midbrain neurons, the MPP \u03e9 -induced AV response was resistant to inhibitors of a major starvationinduced autophagy signaling pathway involving beclin 1 and PI3K. In contrast, MEK inhibition reversed the AV increase and mitochondrial loss elicited by MPP \u03e9 (Figures 7, 8, and 10) , implicating ERK/MAPK signaling in regulating MPP \u03e9 -elicited autophagy. Moreover, Atg protein siRNA data indicate that pathological stimulation of beclin 1-independent autophagy is associated with neuronal cell death. One potential explanation for differences in the effects of PI3K inhibitors on starvation-versus injury-induced autophagy may relate to the relative balance of class I versus class III PI3K activities within a given cell type or in a given context. In intestinal carcinoma cells, class I and class III PI3K have opposing effects on autophagythe class III pathway promotes autophagy, whereas the class I pathway inhibits autophagy. 57 In situations where the class I PI3Ks are not activated, the inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors on autophagy predominate. However, under injury situations involving high class I PI3K activity, effects of inhibiting both pathways may cancel each other out in terms of autophagy induction. Although 3-MA was originally described as a specific inhibitor of autophagy, 56 it also inhibits the class I PI3K pathway (J.-H. Zhu and C.T. Chu, unpublished observation). In HT-29 carcinoma cells, 50 nmol/L WT is more effective at inhibiting autophagy than micromolar doses, perhaps reflecting the contribution of conflicting pathways (P. Codogno, IN-SERM, Ch\u00e2 tenay-Malabry, France, personal communication). In this context, it is interesting to note that the highest WT dose resulted in a slight increase in LC3-II levels ( Figure 4B ).\n\nThe beclin 1 siRNA studies, however, suggest that mechanisms other than simply concurrent inhibition of opposing pathways may also account for the difference in regulation of starvation-and injury-induced autophagy. Direct association between beclin 1 and class III PI3K is essential for the autophagy-promoting effects of this pathway. 34 Haploinsufficiency of beclin 1 expression levels is sufficient to inhibit autophagy in vivo and in vitro. 61, 62 As expected, beclin 1 siRNA effectively reduced starvation-induced autophagy ( Figure 6 ). However, despite effective knockdown of beclin 1 protein expression throughout the duration of MPP \u03e9 treatment, MPP \u03e9 -elicited AVs/L-AVs were unaffected by beclin 1 siRNA treatment, as assessed by MDC staining, LC3 immunofluorescence, and LC3-II gel shift. Together with the wortmannin studies, these results implicate the existence of class III PI3K/beclin 1-independent mechanisms of autophagy.\n\nAlthough starvation-and trophic factor deprivation-associated autophagy mediates nonselective bulk degradation of cytoplasmic constituents, the possibility of organelle-targeted autophagy has been less studied. In yeast, pexophagy, or selective degradation of peroxisomes is orchestrated by both a common set of autophagy genes and exquisitely specific regulatory mechanisms that prevent destruction of the last peroxisome. 63, 64 The yeast Atg 1 kinase has been implicated in selective and nonselective autophagy in yeast, but its substrates are still unknown, and kinases that serve similar roles have not yet been established in mammalian systems. 65 In pathological states, apparently selective destruction of the entire mitochondrial complement occurs after several apoptotic stimuli. 66 Although this was observed in the context of experimentally arrested apoptosis, mechanisms that target organelles for degradation may differ under physiological and pathological situations. In this regard, it is interesting to note that 3-MA/ WT-resistant autophagy has also been observed in another model of organelle-targeted injury (Mar\u00eda Isabel Colombo, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina, personal communication).\n\nThe involvement of the ERK pathway in stimulating MPP \u03e9 -induced AV responses is interesting, because ERK has been reported to localize to mitochondria (reviewed in Ref. 67) , and activated ERK is observed ultrastructurally in abnormal mitochondria and AVs within degenerating substantia nigra neurons. 8 This granular, cytoplasmic pattern of phospho-ERK accumulation is observed not only in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia patient brains (reviewed in Ref. 68 ) but also in asymptomatic individuals showing postmortem pathological evidence of early synucleinopathy. 69 ERK is also involved in promoting autophagy elicited by amino acid deprivation and by soyasaponins in intestinal carcinoma cells, 58, 70 and the JNK subfamily of MAPKs has been implicated in cell death-associated autophagy. 7 Taken together, the data implicate a potential role for MAPKs in regulating autophagic responses and mitochondrial degradation during neuronal cell death.\n\nAlthough autophagy plays beneficial roles in homeostatic maintenance and clearance of aggregate-prone proteins, including those observed in neurodegenerative diseases, 6,12,71 a growing number of studies also implicate autophagy-related processes in mechanisms of cell death. 23, 26, 27, 29, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] The data summarized in Table 2 demonstrate a close relationship between changes in AV content and subsequent cell death. Moreover, time course, ultrastructural, and siRNA studies directed at the core Atg machinery all suggest that the protective effects of MEK/ ERK pathway inhibitors are mediated at least in part by changes in the mitochondrial autophagic response, rather than by preventing the initiating injury. The magnitude of protection conferred by siRNA studies was less than that conferred by UO126, however, suggesting that MEK inhibitors may also play additional roles. This is not surprising because multiple adaptive and death-promoting pathways are activated under pathological situations. On the other hand, it is possible that autophagy was only inhibited in a subset of cells and that stable short hairpin siRNA cell lines are needed to optimize knockdown further. Nevertheless, the data suggest that autophagy contributes to MEK/ERKdependent toxicity in MPP \u03e9 -treated cells.\n\nIt has been proposed that the degree of autophagy elicited may play a role in cell fate decisions, with low levels serving a homeostatic role and high levels promoting cell death, either directly or indirectly. Beclin 1 was originally identified as a Bcl-2-interacting protein, and competition for limiting amounts of beclin 1 has been shown to prevent harmful overactivation of autophagy. 36 It is interesting to note that autophagic responses induced in several pathological contexts including MPP \u03e9 toxicity (Figures 4, 5, and 10; Table 2 ) and viral replication 77 are resistant to inhibitors of this pathway. Thus, either the beclin 1/PI3K pathway is not involved in regulating autophagy in these pathological situations, or alternative mechanisms exist that can complement or bypass this pathway. Furthermore, beclin 1 independence implies the possibility of escape from regulatory feedback mechanisms, contributing to stress/injury when excessive autophagic demand cannot be balanced by cellular reserves. 75 To summarize, increased autophagic stress 75 is observed in aging and many disease states, most likely in response to protein or organelle damage. 78, 79 Although this may initially represent a compensatory response, recent studies also suggest that autophagy can play a pathogenic role, particularly when overstimulated. 14, 15, 66 Whichever the case, the current data indicate that regulation of autophagy elicited by MPP \u03e9 injury differs from that of starvation-induced autophagy. Differences in upstream regulation of autophagic responses in situations of organelle damage versus general deprivation stress, inefficient completion of degradative recycling, and/or loss of feedback mechanisms to prevent excessive activation of degradative systems may underlie divergent effects of autophagy in different contexts."}
