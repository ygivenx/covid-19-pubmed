{"title": "LABORATORY TECHNIQUES OF VETERINARY CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY\" A REVIEW", "body": "Clinical immunology has progressed in both human and veterinary medicine at a fast rate in recent years. Development or improvement of various laboratory techniques enabled the clinicians to diagnose immunologic diseases, for instance, immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders, which could be misdiagnosed without appropriate laboratory tests. There are two groups of laboratory immunologic tests currently used in medicine.\n\nSerologic tests were developed after the discovery that antibody is capable of specific reaction with an antigen. One of the first reviews on serum reactions was published in 1917 [1] . Serologic tests are used successfully for over three-quarters of a century to detect the presence o[antibody in the serum or other body fluids, or the presence of the antigens (bacteria, viruses, etc.) in various biological or laboratory materials. These techniques are described and reviewed in numerous textbooks of microbiology and mycology, and only those will be discussed here, which detect antibody to \"self\" antigens and are used in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases.\n\nImmunoglobulins are the best known and studied immune humoral factors because of their relative stability and specificity. The basic features of immunoglobulins in various species were reviewed in a textbook [2] . Whereas in serology the antibody activity of the immunoglobulins is studied with regards to its specific action with the given antigen, in clinical immunology the ability of the host to produce immunoglobulins (regardless of their antibody specificity) is tested. Immunoglobulins, as any other serum proteins, are known to lead to antibody formation if injected in another species. Consequently, immunoprecipitation is still the most commonly used technique for detection and quantitation of immunoglobulins in the blood serum. The absence of detectable immunoglobulins in colostrum-fed newborn and in adult animals indicates various types of immunodeficiency, usually, but not necessarily, associated with dysfunctions of antibody producing cells of B cell origin. The excess of immunoglobulins indicates either infections or a cancerous disease of immunoglobulin producing cells known as myeloma.\n\nThere is a number of recognized non-specific serum factors of which only the proteins of the complement system are usually tested in connection with clinical cases. The complement system is a system of naturally occurring serum proteins which upon their activation act as enzymes for other complement components, or produce biologically active split factors, or have a \"detergent-like\" action on the cell membranes. The cell membrane damage and destruction of the cell or the microorganism, which cannot be achieved by antibody alone, is probably the most important biological function of the complement system [3] . Though we have only a limited knowledge about complement and complement component levels in domestic animals, various disorders were identified in man and laboratory animals as being associated with the complement system dysfunctions.\n\nThe third group of humoral factors, i.e. the intercellular messengers, is the most recently recognized group of humoral factors functioning as \"activators\", \"stimulators\", \"inhibitors\", etc., of the action of other cells. So far the best known are numerous lymphokines or products of activated lymphocytes which are being identified since 1964 [4] when the amplification of inflammatory reaction by sensitized lymphocytes was described. Similar products produced by monocytes and granulocytes are being identified or may be expected to be discovered. These products are usally studied in connection with the cell-mediated immunity and have no clinical diagnostic value known at the present time.\n\nTo avoid complicated and expensive tests used for detection and quantitation of specific immunoglobulins some simple pre-tests are recommended.\n\nRe/?actometric estimation. A simple refractometric estimation of serum proteins is fast and gives sufficiently accurate results for a screening test. Many types of a refractometer (protometer) may be used. The procedure for total protein estimation is supplied by the producer with the instrument. It is based on the study on refractive indices of protein solutions by Perlman and Longsworth [5] . Many of the refractometers have directly engraved scales for total serum protein estimation. If only the refractive index is given, a nomogram may be used for the protein estimation ( Fig. 1 .) The protein concentration may be determined to the nearest 0.1 g ~o, which is sufficient for evaluations of most clinical cases.\n\nBiuret assay and Lowry method. If more precise estimation is necessary, which happens seldom in clinical immunology, the Biuret assay may be used as described by Cornwall et al. [6] . The sensitivity range of the Biuret method is between 0.25 to 200 mg of protein per ml. A more sensitive method was described by Lowry et al. [7] . It is a modification of the Folin Ciocalteau method and is based on the detection of tyrosine and tryptophane in Ultraviolet absorption analysis. This method was described by Warburg and Christian [8] and is used only with diluted serum protein samples. The amount of protein in mg per ml--1.55 \u00d7 OD2so-0.775 \u00d7 OD26o \u00d7 dilution factor. OD28 o and OD26 o means the optical density readings at 280 and 260 nm wavelengths, respectively.\n\nNormal values of plasma protein in healthy animals are given in the Table 1 . Age is probably the most important factor which has to be taken into account when evaluating the results : newborn and very young animals may have values up to 60% lower, between 3 Table 1 . Normal values of plasma protein in healthy animals (in g/100 ml) (Schalm et al. [9] ).\n\nCow Dog Goat Horse Sheep 6.0 7.5 6.0 8.0 6.07.8 6.0--7.5 5.3 7.8 6.(~7.5 and 5 g/100 ml without being clinically ill. However, serum samples taken after colostrum feeding should be close to the minima indicated in Table 1 . Adult animals usually show values close to the maximum given for normal animals. Additional variation may stem from the breed, sex, and individual differences. Hyperproteinemia could be observed in: (1) various chronic infectious diseases [9] ; (2) dehydration due to extreme heat and insufficient water supply or due to chronic nephritis [9] ; (3) multiple myeloma [10] .\n\nttypoproteinemia could be observed in: (1) newborns and colostrum-deprived animals [9] ; (2) animals with hemorrhages of various origin [9] ; (3) glomerulonephritis and renal amyloidosis [11] ; (4) chronic liver diseases due to insufficient albumin synthesis [9] ; (5) Johne's disease (paratuberculosis) due to the loss of albumin [9] ; (6) protein losing enteropathy [12] .\n\nBecause the changes in antibody are reflected mainly in the gamma and beta 2-globulins of blood serum, their estimation gives an important information about the status of specific humoral immunity and indirectly about the functions of antibody producing B cells.\n\nSerum electrophoresis requires only microliters of serum samples and can assist in the diagnosis of many disorders. It gives a percentage distribution of serum albumin and globulins, and when multiplied by the total serum protein concentration, it gives their absolute concentration values. However, electrophoresis tends to underestimate extremely high concentrations of gammaglobulins [13] which is caused by an \"overflow\" of one globulin into the region of the other with poorly expressed division points between the globulins. The optimal procedures for electrophoresis are given by the producers of the equipment used. Commonly sodium-barbital, Tris-barbital, or Tris-tricine buffers, pH 8.6-8.8 are used for serum electrophoresis. We use commercially prepared Tris-barbitalsodium barbital buffer ofpH 8.8 and ionic strength 0.05 with very good results (Fig 2) . The buffer composition is: Trizma (Tris) 5.077 g, barbital sodium salt 9.81 g, barbituric acid 2.45 g per 1000 ml of distilled H20. Serum electrophoresis requires special equipment not always available to the clinicians. Thus, following simple techniques have been applied for detecting hyper-or hypogammaglobulinemias.\n\nThe reaction is based on detecting of turbidity created by zinc sulfate solution added to the serum sample as described by McEwan et al. [14] . A solution of 208 mg of ZnSO~ per 1 litre of distilled water deprived of COx by boiling is used in the test, in which 6 ml of this solution is added to 0.1 ml of the test serum. After agitation and 1 hr incubation, the absorbance is read at 660 nm in a spectrophotometer. The absorbance reading is translated to milligrams of gammaglobulins per milliliter, using a standard curve prepared from serum dilutions of known gammaglobulin concentration. The results obtained by this method correspond well with the gammaglobulin concentration in the serum [13] in sera without hemolysis. The effect of hemoglobin coloring in the serum sample on the detected gammaglobulin level can be minimized by using a correction equation [13] :\n\nActual gammaglobulin content =Apparent gammaglobulin content (mg/ml)-(Absorbance of 1:20 serum dilution at 540 nm \u00d7 23).\n\nGlutaraldehyde in a low concentration will polymerize practically only gammaglobulins at pH 7.4. This property has been utilized in testing human [15] , bovine [16] , canine [17] and mink sera [18] . Either 6~o (2.4ml glutaraldehyde 25~o, Merck No. 4239+7.6ml distilled water) [17] or 10\u00b0/o solution (4 ml glutaraldehyde 259/o + 6 ml distilled water) [16] were used for dog and calf gammaglobulin estimation, respectively. The concentration of gammaglobulin is proportional to the coagulations time (Fig. 3 ). Samples which do not coagulate within 1 hr are suggested hypogammaglobulinemic. Hypergammaglobulinemia is expressed by coagulation in less than 1.5 rain. The gammaglobulin concentration may be estimated from the graphs presented in literature [18, 19] .\n\nRadial immunodiffusion, also called Mancini's method [20] , is a single diffusion procedure in which the serum sample being tested for presence of an immunoglobulin diffuses through an agarose gel containing specific antiserum against the given immunoglobulin. Commercially prepared plates with agarose containing specific antiserum to given immunoglobulins are available allowing to test the concentration of IgG in most species and IgM, IgA, IgG(Y) in some species. Each kit for detecting the immunoglobulin concentration is supplied with standards of known immunoglobulin concentration and procedure description. The precipitation ring radius developed by the given serum sample (Fig. 4 ) in a given time is compared with the radii obtained with the standards and plotted 500, 1200 and 2400 mg IgG/100 ml serum, respectively, and in two sera \"N\" and \"P\". i38 on semilogarithmic paper (Fig 5) . The diagnostic plates for radial immunodiffusion may also be prepared in the laboratory [20, 21] . It has to be stressed that high specificity antisera have to be used for reproducible results. The technique is relatively accurate, but may give lower than actual reading when higher concentrations of immunoglobulin are present in the serum samples.\n\nRocket immunoelectrophoresis ( Laurell) This relatively new technique was introduced in 1966 by Laurell [22] . It was primarily used to measure strongly negatively charged proteins as is albumin, but may be used for other proteins as well. The method is described in detail in the original Laurell's paper [22] and in a manual [23] . We have used this method for quantitation of immunoglobulins utilizing specific commercially prepared antisera against the given immunoglobulins. In principle, the antigen, e.g. the tested serum (prediluted to 1:10 or 1:20) is placed in constant volumes (5 ~tl) in the wells (2.5 mm diameter) in a layer of agarose containing 1/2 to 1~o concentration of specific antiserum against the given immunoglobulin in question. The plates are then subject to electrophoresis (7-8 V/cm for 3 to 5 hr) during which a precipitating line develops in the region of optimal proportions of the antigen and antibody. After electrophoresis, the plates are washed and stained in a similar way as other immunoelectophoretic slides. After washing out the unprecipitated protein, the precipitates are stained. Figure 6 illustrates \"rockets\" of IgA from dog serum. Because IgG migrates to both poles from the well, the well has to be located close to the center of the agarose plate and the resulting precipitating line has a cigar shape (Fig. 7) . The multiple of the length times average width of the \"rocket\" or \"cigar\" is directly proportional to the concentration of the immunoglobulin in the serum. We have successfully used both the original barbitalsodium barbital-calcium lactate buffer (pH 8.6, ionic strength 0.015 for agarose and 0.025 for vessels) [23] and Tris-tricine-calcium lactate buffer (pH 8.6:0.08 M Tris, 0.024 M Tricine, 0.3 mM calcium lactate, and 0.02\u00b0/0 sodium azide) marketed as QIEP IV buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). A set of controls with known immunoglobulin concentrations is included with each set of samples. The immunoglobulin estimation may be completed in one day. The accuracy is comparable to or better than in radial immunodiffusion.\n\nCrossed immunoelectrophoresis is a combination of two electrophoretic separations: one of the proteins in agarose gel without antibody followed by electrophoresis perpendicular to the first one into antibody-containing gel. The resulting pattern (Fig. 8) is composed of peaks of overlapping precipitating lines. The area enclosed in an individual precipitate is proportional to the antigen/antibody ratio of the system and, therefore, planimetric measurement may quantitate the concentration of the given protein. The procedure was described in detail in the review manual [23] .\n\nBy utilizing specific anti-immunoglobulin serum in the agarose for the second dimension electrophoresis, an estimation of the specific immunoglobulin content is possible. The antiserum used in the case illustrated in Fig. 9 detected 3 subclasses of cat IgG. The cases of hyper-or hypogammaglobulinemia, which cannot be easily detected by normal immunoelectrophoresis, are well noticeable in crossed immunoelectrophoresis.\n\nHypergammaglobulinemia is usually suggested when the gammaglobulin exceeds 2.0 g/100 ml serum and hypogammaglobulinemia when it is below 0.5 g/100 ml serum. However, these values have to be applied cautiously.\n\nNatural hypogammaglobulinemia appears in newborns of all domestic animals [24] . In absolute values, even postcolostral sera may be at the low \"normal\" level of gammaglobulin. Decreased gammaglobulin levels were noticed in many physiologic and pathologic conditions. In cows, for instance, decrease of beta 2-and gamma globulins was noticed before parturition [25] . Also, larger blood loss will lead to lower absolute values of gammaglobulins. Hypogammaglobulinemia appears in many cases of immunodeficiencies, for instance, in Arabian horses [26] , in colostrum deprived animals or animals with failure of absorption of colostral immunoglobulins [27] .\n\nOn the other hand, it has to be emphasized that some young immunodeficient animals need not be hypogammaglobulinemic, if they absorb a high level of colostral gammaglobulins. Because the IgM class of immunoglobulins has substantially shorter halflife than IgG class (approximately by 2/3), and because it is absorbed in smaller amounts from the colostrum, colostral IgM disappears from the blood circulation sooner. Its subnormal levels are used as an indicator of immunodeficiency in young animals, in which the levels of circulating IgG may be normal due to the persistence of absorbed colostral IgG. Thus, these IgM deficiencies may be detected by the last three mentioned tests; i.e. radial immunodiffusion, rocket or crossed immunoelectrophoresis, but not by zinc sulfate precipitation or glutaraldehyde coagulation.\n\nMost infectious diseases, chronic infections in particular, will lead to hypergammaglobulinemias [28] (Fig. 8 ). Very high levels of gammaglobulins (over 25\u00b0~ of total protein) are, for instance, present in cattle naturally infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus [29] , in cats with feline infectious peritonitis [30] , in minks with Aleutian disease [31, 32] and other infections. An extraordinary increase in beta2-and gammaglobulins (up to over 50To of total serum protein) is found in cases of tumors of lymphoid cells causing macroglobulinemia [33] or multiple myeloma [34] , respectively.\n\nFor a veterinary clinician, hypogammaglobulinemia in colostrum-fed young animals and hypergammaglobulinemia in animals with no apparent infectious diseases should be of major concern.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia in young animals may indicate immunodeficiency, or failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies. Hypergammaglobulinemia without concurrent infection may indicate myeloma or autoimmune disorders. All of the above mentioned conditions have guarded on poor prognosis. On the other hand, hypergammaglobulinemia associated with infectious diseases is an important defense feature and will disappear when the infectious agent is eliminated, thus it is a favorable feature. The immunoglobulin concentrations in the serum, colostrum and milk were summarized recently [35] . In general, there are variations in the reported level of immunoglublins due to the species and age, but also due to the variation of techniques and the quality of the reference standards. IgG shows the highest immunoglobulin concentration in the serum and has 2 to 4 subclasses in various species. 1\"he reported levels of IgG in clinically healthy horses and dogs ranges from around 500 to over 1700 mg/100 ml, whereas that for the ruminants and pig generally exceeds 1700 up to over 2500 mg/100 ml. On the other hand chicken has only 300 to 700 mg/ml reported.\n\nIgM levels are higher than IgA levels in ruminants (150 up to 400mg/100 ml) and chicken (230-250 mg/ml), slightly higher in the dog (120-250 mg/100 ml), and about the same as IgA levels in the horse (80-200 mg/100ml) and pig (100-500 ml). IgA levels are the lowest in ruminants (10-50 mg/100 ml) and chicken (30-60 mg/100 ml) and slightly higher in the pig and horse (50-500 mg/100 ml) [35] .\n\nThe complement system is a very important system of serum proteins which augment the immune reactions in the body. The complement components become activated by various ways, most commonly by antigen antibody complexes [36] . Consequently, the decreased level of complement usually reflects an increased formation of immune complexes. The proteins of the complement system are produced by the animal body naturally and are kept at \"physiological\" levels as much as possible. There are known deficiencies of complement components or their inhibitors in man [37] and inbred animals [38] and dozens of new cases are reported every year. Testing of levels of total complement activity in serum, single complement components, or inhibitors assists in diagnosis and prognosis.\n\nThe determination of total complement activity in domestic animals is complicated by the variation in optimal target red blood cells for the complement system of a given species and by variations in optimal test conditions. In addition to this, the complement system is composed of a number of components, some of which are heat labile and the resulting titer reflects both the original levels of complement in the animals and the conditions of handling and storage of the blood and serum sample prior to testing. Thus, in order to obtain reproducible results, the blood handling and storage and the testing conditions must be scrupulously standardized. A control sample tested earlier must be included with each set of tests. We recommend using 45-60 min room temperature clotting time, ice water bath temperature after that time, and harvesting the serum sample no later than 1.5 to 2 hr after blood collection. If a secondary \"white\" clot appears in the serum after storage, the resulting titer is decreased. Samples of horse and sometimes cattle sera are most commonly forming secondary clots. The harvested serum should be tested immediately or quickly frozen on dry ice-methanol or ethanol bath and stored at -70\":C. With the noticeable exception of swine serum, other species complement levels did not change in our laboratory at -7ffC storage for several months. Swine serum should be tested immediatlely. Standard control samples of swine sera slowly decayed in complement activity even at\n\nThe optimal conditions for testing hemolytic complement in various species of domestic animals are summarized from the literature [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] in Table 2 . It may be emphasized that other than conditions listed in Table 2 will also lead to the detection of hemolytic complement activity, usually at lower titers. The most important factors in complement level determinations are: (1) identical handling and storage of the serum samples tested; (2) using of constant concentrations of sensitized red blood cells; we recommend 1 \u00d7 108 cells/ml determined by optical density measurement at 412 nm; (3) using of optimal concentration of sensitizing antibodies against the given red blood cells; we recommend a dose which will give the highest detectable titer of complement, but which will not Table 2 ; (5) using of standard temperature and timing conditions of the test; we recommend a temperature of 37\u00b0C for mammalian complements and 30\u00b0C for chicken complement with a determination of lysis after 90 min. Both tube and microtiter plate techniques may be used. The determination of the degree of lysis is done after centrifuging the cells down in both tube and microtiter plate determination. A skilled laboratory worker may determine the degree of lysis to +5~o just from the size of sedimented cell volume and the color of the supernatant fluid, which is sufficient for clinical testing. More accurate measurement may be done using a spectrophotometer at 412 nm, which is the peak of absorbance for hemoglobulin in aged cells.\n\nFunctional testing of complement component levels is done by supplying 100-fold excess of components not in question. Commercial preparations of sensitized sheep erythrocytes treated with antibodies and early acting components of the complement system and purified components isolated from guinea pig or human sera are available and may be used in testing complement components in a number of species of domestic animals [47] . Only C2, C4 and C3 from herbivorous animals cannot be tested by the available system and no simple or commercially prepared testing system has been published for these components.\n\nImmunochemical quantitations of C3 and some other components may be performed by rocket immunoelectrophoresis with specific antisera to them. These procedures detect the presence of the given complement component regardless of its function. They are used in human but not yet in veterinary medicine at the present time.\n\nThe hemolytic complement levels in CH50 units per ml of serum in clinically healthy adult animals are summarized in Table 2 . Horse serum has the lowest detectable level of hemolytic complement even under optimal conditions, probably due to a quick conversion of the C3b into C3d sites, which favors more conglutination than lysis of red blood cells. Therefore the conglutinating complement titers in horse serum exceed considerably the hemolytic titers. Bovine or other ruminant sera have a similar tendency when tested with sheep erythrocytes, but not when tested with guinea pig or rabbit erythrocytes. Horse, goat, sheep and chicken sera give low hemolytic titers, though they are highly active in complement mediated bactericidal activity [48, 49] .\n\nOnly results of testing done under completely identical serum handling and test conditions may be compared with each other. The best control is to run a standard serum reference sample kept frozen at -70\u00b0C or lower temperature in small aliquots simultaneously with each series of sera from clinical patients. The titers will be usually slightly lower with samples frozen and once defrosted than in fresh samples. Twice frozen and defrosted samples should not be used for testing.\n\nHypocomplementemia is suggested in samples in which the CH50 units are 50% or less of the lowest level detected in clinically healthy animals. Physiological hypocomplementemia is present in newborn animals [44, 50] . Their level of complement reaches the level of adult animals within weeks to months. Pathological hypocomplementemia may be caused by infections, automimmune diseases or inherited defects in complement component production or function [37, 51] . The clinical meaning of complement levels higher than in \"normal\" healthy animals is not clear.\n\nTesting of individual components of the complement system has not been done in clinical patients in veterinary medicine and no interpretation is available. The values detected in clinically healthy animals were published [47] . The defects of individual components production or function in man either caused no clinical symptoms or were associated with various infections [37, 51] .\n\nDetermination of intercellular \"messengers\" such as lymphokines and monokines is used in research, but has not been applied in clinical immunology so far. Indirectly the production of these humoral factors is tested by various tests of cell mediated immunity. It is premature to review this topic in connection with veterinary clinical immunology.\n\nThe functions of two groups of cells are tested in clinical patients: (a) phagocytes and (b) lymphocytes.\n\nThe total white blood cell count and a differential count are often indicative of disorders in cellular immunity [9] . Lymphopenia may be associated with defects of T or T and null cells primarly. Neutropenia is often associated with increased susceptibility to infections, with so-called \"lazy leukocyte syndrome\" and T cell deficiencies [52] . The increased number of immature forms of white blood cells indicates their heavy use or is associated with leukocytosis in numerous tumorous diseases [52] .\n\nThe tests for phagocyte functions are generally still in their development even in human medicine. At the present time, a number of defects can be uncovered. Whether they appropriately explain the symptomatology or measure the in vivo processes is open to question [52] . The problems of neutrophil function tests were discussed recently [53] . Very few tests of phagocyte functions were used so far in veterinary clinical immunology [54] .\n\nMobilization of neutrophils from the body depot is tested by subcutaneous injections of epinephrine (1:1000). The capillary blood samples are taken before and up to 60 rain after the injection. There should be an increase of peripheral polymorphonuclears of over 45~ detected within 1 hr [55] . \n\nNitroblue tetrazolium is directly reduced by superoxide anion to an insoluble purple formazan after phagocytosis by an active polymorphonuclear cell. Therefore its reduction is a measure of superoxide anion generation by the polymorphonuclears. Two modifications were applied in human medicine: one testing the polymorphonuclear oxidative functions in vitro followed by spectrophotometric measurement [56] and the other by staining a blood smear and counting the formazan-containing cells in a blood smear [57] . In verterinary medicine the test was used experimentally [54] and we are starting to use it in testing clinical cases.\n\nThis test was recently used successfully in the study on bovine polymorphonuclear cell function [54] . The iodination test measures the ability of the polymorphonuclears to convert inorganic iodine to a trichloracetic acid precipitable form, i.e., protein-bound. The iodine is covalently bound to a suitable acceptor molecule, such as the tyrosine residues of proteins via the actions of hydrogen peroxide and myeloperoxidase. This system has been found to exhibit a marked toxic activity toward bacteria, fungi, and viruses [58, 59] . The iodination procedure was recently re-evaluated with human polymorphonuclears [60] . The procedure is based on determination of radiolabeled iodine bound to the polymorphonuclears after incubation of the cells with preopsonized zymosan, NaI, and 125I.\n\nVarious modifications of bactericidal tests utilizing Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli or other bacteria were used [54] . The tests are quite laborious and the results are affected by numerous factors. Consequently, they were not tested sufficiently in clinical patients of domestic animals. Similarly, an extensive biochemical analysis of antimicrobial mechanisms of the neutrophils was not utilized in veterinary clinical immunology.\n\nEpinephrine stimulation fails to induce a 45%o or greater increase in peripheral blood neutrophils in patients with \"lazy leukocyte syndrome\" [61] described only in man. Nitroblue tetrazolium is oxidized to formazan in more than 30% neutrophils in healthy individuals but decreased in children with chronic granulomatous disease (CHGD) [57] . The digestion/ingestion (D/I) index for nitroblue tetrazolium is over 2.5 in normal healthy man and was in our laboratory with bovine and canine polymorphonuclears. A decreased D/I index was detected in children with CHGD [56] and in dogs with severe chronic skin infections tested in our laboratory. These dogs might have had a defect similar to CHGD prior to their skin conditions. The preliminary results of phagocyte testing in domestic animals are promising [54] and may lead to the description of immunodeficiences not yet recognized in veterinary medicine.\n\nThree main functionally different goups of lymphocytes are recognized today, each having more specialized subpopulations: (1) T cells, which have various regulatory and cytotoxic functions in the immune response and hypersensitivity; (2) B cells which may mature to become immunoglobulin and antibody producing cells; and (3) null cells, whose functions are still disputed.\n\nThe lymphocytes in animals with \"normal\" immune response can be stimulated by nonspecific mitogens or specific antigens to transform (replicate, undergo blastogensis), whereas lymphocytes of immunodeficient animals will respond in a much lesser degree to the same stimulation. The lymphocyte dysfunction may be caused by lymphocyte defects or serum immunosuppressive factors [62] .\n\nThe in vitro lymphocyte transformation test was developed in the 1960s [63] . Since that time, numerous modifications were made and the test was applied in both research studies and in clinical diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Although there are many variables involved in the test and no absolute values of normal and abnormal transformations are available, the cases of immunodeficiency and immunosuppression may be detected by comparing the results obtained with patient's lymphocytes and those obtained with \"normal\" animal lymphocytes tested simultaneously. The topic has been reviewed in human [64, 65] and veterinary clinical immunology [62] .\n\nIn principle, the lymphocytes from the patient's blood (collected in preservative-free heparin or defibrinated with glass beads) are cultured with additions of various mitogens in media containing 10-20~o serum from the patient, healthy homologous controls, or fetal calf. After 2-3 days of incubation the blastogenesis is determined by adding 3H-thymidine to the cells and culturing them for an additional 18 hr. Then the cells are harvested and washed and the amount of incorporated 3H-thymidine is determined in a scintillation counter [62] .\n\nThe test is quite complex and numerous factors affect the final result. However, when properly performed, a relatively complex and meaningful evaluation of the immune status of the patient's lymphocytes may be obtained. The variables affecting the results are discussed below.\n\nBlood samples should be collected in heparin free of preservatives, or in glass beads containing syringe or dish and defibrinated by shaking. Calcium-free media are necessary for washing cells from heparinized blood. We do not recommend using of whole blood samples for lymphocyte transformation in clinical immunology as has been recommended by some authors [66] , because the defects of lymphocytes cannot be distinguished from the suppression due to serum suppressor factors and because the number of lymphocytes may vary considerably in the whole blood samples.\n\nThe lymphocytes should be cultured in media containing autologous and healthy homologous and/or fetal calf serum. This allows to determine the presence of lymphocyte immunosuppressive factors in the patient's sera and distinguish this mitogenesis suppression from that caused by the dysfunction of lymphocytes per se [62] .\n\nThe most commonly used mitogens are: Concanavalin A (Con A; in most species a broad T cell mitogen), phytohemagglutinin (PHA; primarily a T effector cell mitogen), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM; a broad B cell mitogen) [67] . It is recommended to use both optimal (giving peak thymidine incorporation) and suboptimal mitogen doses, because in some defects only the response to suboptimal doses is affected [68] . Use of specific bacterial or viral mitogens has relatively small importance in clinical immunology, because in most cases simpler techniques may detect infection with the given bacteria or viruses. On the other hand, use of non-specific phytomitogens helps to detect the functional status of lymphocytes regardless of the antigen to which they respond.\n\nOptimal timing for maximal thymidine incorporation ranges usually from 2 to 5 days [62, 66, 69, 70] , and is affected by numerous factors.\n\nIf synthesis of proteins rather than DNA synthesis should be tested, radiolabeled leucine is incorporated into the cells. The major advantages of this technique are its speed, low incidence of contamination, and lack of requirement of serum [71] . However, the latter is also a disadvantage, because this modification does not allow to detect the presence of serum suppressor factors.\n\nThe problem of enumeration of various types and subtypes of lymphocytes in domestic animals is far from being resolved to such a degree that these procedures could be used in veterinary clinical immunology testing. Therefore we suggest it to be premature at this point to discuss this topic in the review. This does not mean that the differentiation and enumeration of lymphocytes may not be included in laboratory evaluation of the clinical disorders, however.\n\nThe potential of lymphocyte transformation test results has not been fully appreciated. The test has to be done in a relatively complex set up with various doses and kinds of mitogens and with additions of various sera to give useful results [62] . For the correct evaluation of results both the background counts per minute (CPM) of unstimulated lymphocytes and the stimulation index or CPM of stimulated lymphocytes must be taken into account. We found the background CPM in clinically healthy dogs varying in considerably smaller range (100-400) than in cattle or horses (200 to over 2000) . A mistake would be made by reporting only stimulation indices (i.e. reciprocal of CPM of stimulated cells divided by CPM of unstimulated cells), as well as by reporting only the CPM of stimulated cells. The stimulation indices may be decreased either by decreasing the stimulated cells' CPM and/or by increasing the background CPM. We have found decreased responsiveness of lyrnphocytes to the phytomitogens in numerous infectious and lymphoreticular diseases caused by either of the following: (1) the presence of serum immunosuppressive factors in the patient serum, (2) the decreased response of lymphocytes per se to the mitogens, or (3) the increased mitogenicity of lymphocytes due to unidentified serum factors in absence of phytomitogens [62] .\n\nOur preliminary data indicate that at least some infectious diseases are preceded by an increase in the background CPM of unstimulated lyrnphocytes, which may indicate recruitment of younger cellular forms from the depot of the hematopoietic tissues, and increased activity and/or numbers of helper or effector cells, all of which are affected by unspecified serum factors in the patient serum. Animals with most infections that we have tested developed in their serum factors suppressing the response of lympocytes to phytomitogens. The specific target cells for those suppressor factors varied with diseases and with the individual animals. Some viral infections (such as distemper) or chronic bacterial infections (such as brucellosis) affected the response of the lymphocytes per se, regardless of the addition of serum to the culture media. Lymphoproliferative tumours (such as bovine enzootic leucosis) caused substantial increase in the proliferation of unstimulated cells and even the serum from infected animals affected blastogenesis of cells from healthy animals.\n\nOur preliminary data indicated that the lymphocyte transformation test results in clinical immunology may detect an incubation period of infectious diseases, a pre-clinical stage of lymphoproliferative diseases, or immunodeficiency of the lymphocytes, which may be either inherited or acquired by infection, but always fatal to the animal. On the other hand, depressed responsiveness of the lymphocytes caused by serum suppressor factors during infections was prognostically favorable and disappeared in relatively short time with the elimination of the infection.\n\nAutoimmune diseases are characterized by (a) presence of antibodies to \"'self' antigens in serum; (b) presence of antibodies against modified immunoglobulins (such as rheumatoid factor); (c) deposits of antibodies or incomplete antibodies on blood cells; (d) deposits of antibodies (immunoglobulins) within various tissues.\n\nAntibodies against nuclear proteins or DNA may appear in the blood stream in many autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and myositis. There are numerous tests used to determine the specificity of these antibodies.\n\nThe fluorescent antinuclear antibody test [72] is probably the most widely accepted. Though many laboratories use cryostat sections of rodent liver or kidney [73] , we had the best results with one of the strains of VERO cell cultures (monkey kidney cells) in testing dog sera (Fig. 10) .\n\nThe test is a relatively simple indirect immunofluorescent staining procedure. First the patient's serum is placed on tissue cell cultures or cryostat tissue sections. After an incubation at room temperature and washing the unbound protein off, the antibodies from the serum bound to the cellular materials are revealed by staining the culture or section with anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate [72] . The most important factor is the specificity and potency of the anti-IgG serum.\n\nBoth the pattern of staining and the titer of the antibodies in patient serum are important. Peripheral staining (Fig. 10a) is typical for active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Diffuse staining (Fig. 10b) appears often with remission of SLE and less often in rheumatoid arthritis. Speckled and nucleolar staining is present in approximately 1/2 of the patients with progessive systemic sclerosis [74] . We suggest titers 40 and above on VERO cell cultures as positive, and titers of 20 as suspect. Lower titers are suggested positive if rodent tissue sections are used [73, 75] . The highest titer of antinuclear antibody detected in our laboratory reached 8000. Dogs with anti-nuclear antibodies at titers 160 and higher were usually severely ill. Peripheral staining with titers 5 on VERO cell cultures was detected in a number of clinically healthy animals in our laboratory.\n\nRheumatoid factor is an antibody characterized by its ability to react with antigenic determinants present on the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule. It appears in the serum of most but not all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and in some patients with other autoimmune diseases [76] .\n\nIn the 1940s Waaler and Rose and co-workers independently described agglutination of sensitized sheep erythrocytes by sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis [77, 78] . Modification of their tests is still used under the name Rose Waaler test in both human and veterinary diagnosis. A test utilizing latex particles as the carrier of immunoglobulin molecules was developed later. These particles were also agglutinated by rheumatoid factor [79] . Unfortunately, this test has not been successfully adapted for testing rheumatoid factor in animals and no commercially prepared latex-IgG particles are available for use in veterinary clinical immunology. From domestic animals, rheumatoid arthritis is most commonly diagnosed in dogs. The topic was recently reviewed [80] .\n\nIn Rose-Waaler test, sheep erythrocytes are covered with rabbit or dog hemolysin (containing IgG class of antibodies) and reacted with various dilutions of patient serum, which has been pre-absorbed with unsensitized sheep erythrocytes to remove natural antibodies to sheep red blood cells. A control is run simultaneously with unsensitized sheep erythrocytes to detect absence of natural antibodies to the carrier (sheep) cells in the absorbed serum. A differential titer between the agglutination of unsensitized and sensitized sheep erythrocytes is the rheumatoid factor titer [76] . The reading is done macroscopically and under a microscope (Fig. 11) . Care has to be taken in the transfer of agglutinated cells, onto the microscopic slide because the agglutinate is relatively weak.\n\nAny differential titer exceeding eight is suggested to be positive for rheumatoid factor [76] . Presence of the rheumatoid factor together with clinical symptoms is pathognomic for rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythemotosus with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAutoimmune hemolytic disease is characterized by the presence of antibodies or C3 (the third component of the complement system) on the patient red blood cells and sometimes even in the patient serum. These antibodies are most often so-called \"incomplete\" antibodies which do not cause agglutination. They and C3 on the erythrocytes may be detected by adding specific anti-IgG or anti-C3 antiserum to the cell suspension.\n\nIn the 1940s Coombs and co-workers [81] developed a test for detecting presence of nonagglutinating antibodies to various erythrocyte antigens which may be detected on the patient's red blood cells or even in blood serum in numerous autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Thus a modification of the original antiglobulin (Coombs) test is used in the diagnosis of autoimmune anemias [82] .\n\nIn principle, red blood cells from blood collected with EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate) are reacted with specific rabbit or goat antiserum against IgG and/or C3 of the species tested for autoantibody. If the cells contain IgG or C3 molecules on their surface, agglutination occurs. A 2% suspension of erythrocytes is usually used, i.e. 4 x l0 s cells/ml. The rabbit or goat anti serum is diluted in two-fold or four-fold dilutions from 1:2 or 1:4 up. The degree of agglutination may be assessed macroscopically with a magnifying glass or under a microscope (Fig. 11) . The critical point is the quality and strength of the antiserum. Care should be exercised in transferring the cells for microscopic observation because the agglutinate is relatively weak.\n\nIn this test the presence of antibodies against erythrocytes is detected in the patient serum by using blood group matched donor erythrocytes as the target cells for the antibody [82] . Donor erythrocytes with \"incomplete\" patient antibody are then treated with the anti-IgG serum as in the direct test to reveal the presence of \"incomplete\" antibodies on their surface. Because blood group determination or cross-matching is a necessity for this test and because only some patients with autoimmune hemolytic diseases do have detectable circulating antibody, this test is less frequently used in veterinary medicine.\n\nA special temperature regime has to be implemented for handling the blood sample to detect so-called \"cold\" agglutinins which appear more frequently in patients with acquired secondary anemias [82, 83] . The \"cold\" agglutinins are able to agglutinate the cells at 20 and 4C but not at 37\u00b0C and are \"complete\" antibody not requiring the use of anti-IgG sera.\n\nBecause the strength of the reaction depends on both the strength of the antiserum and the concentration of non-agglutinating antibodies on the cells, each laboratory has to determine the meaning of the various titers of the given antiserum. With commercially prepared antisera used in our laboratory, healthy animals had no detectable agglutination, animals with hemolytic diseases had either undetectable antibodies on their red blood cells (if the disease was not immunologically mediated) or varying titers from four up, but seldom exceeding 100. It must be emphasized that the titer is a reciprocal of the dilution of the anti-IgG or C3 antiserum which only reflects the density of autoantibodies on the red blood cells tested. The so-called \"Coombs reagent\", which should contain antibodies to both IgG and C3, is commercially prepared for testing dog red blood cells, but may give negative results in some cases when either anti-IgG or anti-C3 sera alone will give agglutination. Thus we recommend using all three types of antisera when autoimmune hemolytic anemia is highly suspected.\n\nIn autoimmune hemolytic anemia usually only anti-IgG serum will agglutinate the cells, whereas in other drug-induced hemolytic anemias, usually only anti-C3 antiserum will agglutinate the cells. In anemias associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, both anti-IgG and anti-C3 antisera usually caused agglutination of patient's erythrocytes. On the other hand, in anemias associated with presence of \"cold\" agglutinins anti-C3, but not anti-IgG, will give agglutination of patient's red blood cells [82] .\n\nMany immunologically mediated diseases are associated with either production of antibodies against the own patient's tissue antigens or deposits of immune complexes of antibodies and antigens in the tissues. Renal [84] and skin [85] biopsies are the most commonly tested tissues by direct immunofluorescence. Donor healthy tissues may be used to detect presence of circulating antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence in a number of autoimmune diseases [86] .\n\nIn the direct staining procedure, the cryostat (frozen) tissue sections from the patients are stained, after thawing at room temperature, with specific anti-IgG, anti-IgM, anti-IgA, or anti-C3 antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) stain. After rinsing and mounting, the sections are observed under a fluorescent microscope and the staining intensity and pattern are recorded [84, 85] (Fig. 12a) .\n\nIn the indirect staining procedures, the cryostat tissue section from healthy donors are first treated with patient's serum and after rinsing stained with specific FITC anti-IgG. The anti-IgG antibody will stain only those locations where the patient's serum sample deposited its specific antibody against the tissue constituents [86] (Fig. 12b) .\n\nAdequate tissue sections, optimal fluorescent antibody reagents, adequate flourescent microscopic equipment, adequate controls, and a good deal of experience in interpreting the results is necessary for satisfactory immunofluorescence study.\n\nThe detailed discussion on the interpretation of results is beyond the scope of this overview. In direct staining, one has to take into account the clinical stage and the development of the disease, the area of sample collection and the results of the control healthy animal samples treated simultaneously.\n\nIn autoimmune glomerulonephritis due to autoantibodies to glomerular basement membrane, linear deposits of IgG and C3 (in approximately 1/3 of the patients) are the most common features [87] . In glomerulonephritis caused by immune complex diseases, the deposits of IgG and C3 are granular and usually on the epithelial side of the membrane [88] . In systemic lupus erythematosus both linear and granular deposits may be detected because both direct antiglomerular antibodies or immune complexes may develop [84] .\n\nIn autoimmmune dermatologic diseases, direct immunoflorescent staining of the skin sections and indirect staining using the patient's serum may differentiate various types of skin disorders [89] [90] [91] . Direct staining of intercellular cement substance and presence of circulating antibodies to these substances (detectable by indirect immunofluorescence) is typical for pemphigus vulgaris. The basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction stains in patients with bullous pemphigoid disease, in which also circulating antibodies to the basement membrane are often detectable (Fig. 12) . Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by more intense staining of the basement membrane with FITC anti-IgA than FITC anti-IgG. The skin basement membranes also stained with FITC anti-lgG in systemic lupus erythematosus, but the staining is usually granular as compared to a linear staining in bullous pemphigoid disease. Neither in dermatitis herpetiformis nor in systemic [89] . Both direct and indirect immunofluorescence of dog skin was used in diagnosis of this disease in veterinary medicine [90, 91] .\n\nAutoantibodies to various other body tissues may be detected in diseases given in Table 3 .\n\nVarious sensitive tests quantitating IgE in man have been developed to detect allergic patients with elevated IgG. Unfortunately, attempts to isolate larger quantities of purified animal IgE molecules and to prepare the necessary specific antisera were unsuccessful so far. Thus there are no commercially prepared tests available to detect IgE levels in animals, as there are none practically used to detect type IV hypersensitivities in animal patients.\n\nFortunately, both hypersensitivities type I and type IV may be tested relatively efficiently in vivo by intradermal administration of various commercially prepared allergens.\n\nBecause hypersensitivity reactions type II are the consequences of autoimmune diseases and type III are consequences of some of the immune reactions, there is no special laboratory testing practical for those types of hypersensitivities."}
