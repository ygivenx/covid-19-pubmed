{"title": "A Prospective Study of Respiratory Viral Infection in Pregnant Women With and Without Asthma", "body": "goosefoot lamb's quarters, prickly saltwort, russian thistle). Subjects were considered atopic if the specific IgE to aeroallergen was 0 35 kUA/L or greater in venous blood. Exhaled carbon monoxide (ECO) was measured at clinical visits using a piCO Smokerlyzer Breath CO Monitor (Bedfont, UK).\n\nICS use was expressed as mCS use was expressed as ECO) was measured at clinical visits using a piCO\n\nBreath CO Monitor (Be1 m S use was expressed as ECO) was measureduticasone dipropionate. Some women used ICS in combination with long acting beta agonist (LABA) eith er as budesonide/e-formoterol or fluticasone/salmeterol.\n\nLoss of control was defined when women reported 3 or more of the following: daytime symptoms >2 days per\n\nweek, any activity limitation, any nocturnal symptoms, reliever medication use >2 times per week and peak expiratory flow or FEV 1 <80% predicted.\n\nWomen were considered current smokers if they self-reported cigarette smoking, or had an elevated exhaled carbon monoxide (ECO\u226510 ppm) and/or urinary cotinine (\u2265 level 5 / 2840 nmol/L, Nicalert, NYMOX, St-Laurent, QC, Canada). ECO was measured at each clinical assessment, while urinary cotinine was measured at the second visit.\n\nNasal symptoms (blocked nose, runny nose, itchy nose or sneezing), gastric reflux symptoms (indigestion, heartburn, burning feeling), cough and asthma symptoms (breathlessness, cough, wheeze, chest tightness) were also assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) 10 cm in length, with subjects asked to mark how bothersome their symptoms were from 0cm (not at all bothersome) to 10cm (extremely bothersome). The CCQ is not a validated questionnaire. We have calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the CCQ for detecting PCR positive respiratory viral infections in pregnancy using 219 data points. The PPV among pregnant women with asthma was 36.8%, and the NPV was 84.4%. Using 86 data points, the PPV among pregnant women without asthma was 40%, while the NPV was 61.3%, giving an overall PPV of 37.6% and NPV of 76.8%. Receiver Operator Curves were constructed (e- Figure 3 ), but these did not allow a CCQ total score cut-off which was associated with PCR positive infection to be determined. The CCQ has good negative predictive value, and is therefore useful in identifying when infections are unlikely to be present. \n\nIn order to detect a significantly higher rate of viral infection among pregnant women with asthma (35% 5 ) compared to pregnant women without asthma (10% 6 ), at a power of 0.9 and a, at a power of 0.9 and Cite><Author>Corne</Author><Year>2002</Year><RecNum>4510</RecNum><Disp 7 ). In order to allow for drop-outs, we aimed to recruit 70 women per group. However, we recruited more asthmatic women than this because we were recruiting for other studies in tandem 1, 8 .\n\nWe analysed the time to first common cold and first PCR positive cold with Kaplan-Meier plots, with analysis of instantaneous risk described with a Cox proportional hazards model. CCQ scores were recorded at the first non-cold event (visit or phone call) in order to obtain a baseline for future comparison. Women with asthma had an elevated baseline CCQ score compared to women without asthma due to overlapping symptoms such as sneezing and cough (e- Table 1 ). At baseline, CCQ scores were significantly different between the asthma and control groups for domains 1, 2 and 4 (e- Table 1 ). \n\nSubject characteristics (e- Table 2 )\n\nStudy participation ended with delivery in the majority of subjects. Completing the study to delivery were 97 control women and 136 asthmatic women. Data from all women commencing the cohort study were included, with adjustments made for follow-up times in each group. There were no differences between the groups in gestational age at recruitment, number of weeks of follow-up, height, marital status, ethnicity, smoking status, or season of recruitment or study end (P>0.05, e- Table 2 ). 8.5% of control women and 9.5% of asthmatic women were vaccinated against influenza during the current influenza season. \n\nWe investigated differences in the time to first cold with Kaplan-Meier survival estimates (e- Figure 4 ). For common colds, the asthma group had a significantly shorter period of study before having their first common cold (hazards ratio 2.27 (1.64, 3.14), P<0.0001), but there was no difference between the groups in the time to first PCR positive cold (hazards ratio 1.14 (0.69, \n\nApproximately 71% of common colds were also considered colds by self-report. Self-reported colds were more likely to be reported by pregnant women with asthma compared to pregnant women without asthma (P<0.0001, relative risk Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus in the asthma (38.5% of viruses) and control (44.8% of viruses) groups, followed by metapneumovirus (manuscript Table 3 ). The odds of having rhinovirus detected was 0.89 (0.33, 2.42 (Odds Ratio (95% CI), p=0.82) in the asthma group compared to the control group.\n\nThere were significantly more asthmatic women with retrospectively self-reported colds in the first and second trimester (62%) compared to women without asthma (41%, P=0.0006, RR 1.53, 95% CI [1.19, 1.96], e- Table 5 ).\n\nWomen with asthma reported more colds than women without asthma (P=0.0002, Mann Whitney test), and the rate of colds was significantly increased among women with asthma when adjusted for follow-up time, atopy, parity and maternal BMI (IRR 1.64, 95% CI [1.16, 2.32], P=0.005). Similarly, among women followed postpartum (e- Total CCQ Score >=10 7 (26.9%) 19 (31.7%) Data is median (IQR) or n(%). * xt reg, adjusted for baseline CCQ total score, atopy, parity and BMI CCQ: common cold questionnaire Impact of colds on asthma Among pregnant women with asthma there were 60 PCR positive respiratory viral infections. One third of these events were associated with exacerbation requiring medical intervention (hospital admission 5% of exacerbations, emergency department presentation 10% of exacerbations, and unscheduled doctor's visit 85% of exacerbations, with oral steroid use in 40% of exacerbations) and a further one third with mild exacerbation/loss of control. The total CCQ score significantly correlated with ACQ score (Spearman r = 0.3187, P=0.0131, Spearman rank correlation, e- Figure 5 ). During 62% of PCR positive cold events, the asthmatic woman had uncontrolled asthma (ACQ > 1.5), with the median ACQ score being 1.8 (1, 2.3) . In 50% of events, women used ICS, or ICS/LABA combination therapy, with a median dose of 800 g/day (IQR 343, 1000, adjusted for self-reported non-adherence).\n\nAmong 49 asthmatic women who had a PCR positive cold and a corresponding baseline clinic visit (first non-cold event), the impact of viral infection on asthma was assessed (e- Table 7 ). There were significantly more exacerbations during PCR positive colds, more uncontrolled asthma, significantly higher ACQ scores and greater symptom burden than during the baseline period. Pre-bronchodilator lung function was significantly lower during PCR positive colds than at baseline for FEV 1 and FVC (e- Table 7 ). Among 20 control women with a PCR positive cold and a corresponding baseline clinic visit, there was no difference in lung function, but a higher FENO during PCR positive colds (16. 2 [12.1, 21 .0] vs 6.7 [5.7, 12 .0], n=14, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, P=0.042).\n\nPCR positive colds with asthma exacerbation were no more severe (assessed by total CCQ score) than PCR positive colds without asthma exacerbation (xtreg, coefficient 1.42, 95% CI [-1.09, 3.93], P=0.268, e- Table 8 ). However, PCR positive colds did result in an increase in asthma symptoms, assessed by the ACQ (e- Table 7 ). e- Figure 5 .
