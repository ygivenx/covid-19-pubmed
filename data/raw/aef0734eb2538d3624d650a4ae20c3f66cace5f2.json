They account for 5-10% of the total cells in the brain and are necessary for maintaining brain homeostasis (Li and Barres, 2018) . Microglia are distributed throughout the CNS and dynamically survey the environment by extending and retracting their highly ramified processes. Upon environmental alterations, microglia quickly modify their activation state and adjust their range of effects which include phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, modulation of neuronal activity, elimination of synapses, production of neuromodulatory factors that support synaptic plasticity as well as release of cytokines to modulate inflammation in the adult brain (Kettenmann et al., 2011; Li and Barres, 2018; Wake et al., 2011) .\n\nIt is increasingly recognized that microglia may be neurotoxic or exert beneficial roles depending on their activation status and release of mediators (Li and Barres, 2018) . Among the multiple signals that operate on microglia to modulate their functional state and coordinate their diverse repertoire of functions are neurotransmitters. Microglia express numerous types of neurotransmitter receptors such as those for glutamate, GABA, serotonin, adrenaline and acetylcholine (Kettenmann et al., 2011; Li and Barres, 2018) .\n\nCholinergic signaling is involved in the modulation of central and peripheral inflammation (Lehner et al., 2019; Pavlov and Tracey, 2015) , however, we still have limited information about how microglia respond to activation of cholinergic receptors in vivo. Microglia have been reported to express the \u03b13, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b17 and \u03b24 nicotinic channel subunits (Liu et al., 2009; Rock et al., 2008; Shytle et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006) . Expression of muscarinic receptors on cultured microglia has also been demonstrated (Pannell et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 1998) . In cultured microglia, acetylcholine seems to exert mainly an anti-inflammatory effect on microglia. For instance, acetylcholine and nicotine inhibited TNF-\u03b1 release in response to LPS stimulation (Shytle et al., 2004) and nicotine reduced free radical production in response to \u03b2-amyloid (Moon et al., 2008) .\n\nHow muscarinic receptors influence microglia function is poorly understood. On BV-2 microglia cells, acute activation of Gq-associated Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) induced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators while activation of Giassociated DREADDs inhibited lipopolysaccharide-and CCL2-induced inflammatory signaling (Grace et al., 2018) . The influence of muscarinic receptors might be more important for the modulation of \"activated microglia\" than \"resting microglia\" as their expression is largely increased in microglia isolated from stroke and Alzheimer's disease mouse models when compared to microglia isolated from healthy mice (Pannell et al., 2016) . To note, most of these studies were done in vitroand microglia have been shown to respond differently when analyzed in vitro or in vivo (Aguzzi et al., 2013; Bohlen et al., 2017; Yamasaki, 2014) .\n\nHere, we took advantage of DREADD technology to investigate the effects of M3 muscarinic Gq-mediated signaling on microglial function in vivo. We used the human modified muscarinic type 3 DREADD (hM3Dq), which is not activated by acetylcholine (Nichols and Roth, 2009 ) but can be activated by clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and its metabolites (Dong et al., 2010; Gomez et al., 2017) , to explore the function of M3 muscarinic Gq-signaling in vivo in these cells.\n\nUsing Cre/lox technology (Parkhurst et al., 2013) we generated a mouse line in which hM3Dq (Zhu et al., 2016) is selectively expressed in microglia. We found that acute activation of the hM3Dq pathway in microglia increased phagocytosis, increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain, but did not cause overt behavioral changes. In contrast, chronic activation of this signaling pathway attenuated the increase in brain cytokine production and sickness behavior triggered by low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected peripherally. Our experiments provide a proof of principle that chronic M3 muscarinic Gq-linked signaling, and possibly other Gq-coupled GPCRs, can trigger immunological memory that helps to decrease inflammatory responses in the brain.\n\nCX3CR1CreER mice (Jackson Laboratory, B6.129P2(Cg)-Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Litt/WganJ) expressing tamoxifen-activated Cre-recombinase in CX3CR1-positive cells (Parkhurst et al., 2013) , were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. R26-hM3Dq/mCitrine mice (Zhu et al., 2016) (B6N;129-Tg(CAG-CHRM3*,-mCitrine)1Ute/J) expressing a CAG promotor-driven HA-tagged hM3Dq with an upstream floxed STOP cassette were a generous gift of Ute Hochgeschwender (Central Michigan University) and Bryan Roth (University of North Carolina). CX3CR1CreER mice were crossed with R26-hM3Dq/mCitrine mice to create CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice, which upon treatment with tamoxifen express hM3Dq in CX3CR1-positive cells (hM3Dq-positive mice).\n\nCX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice treated with vehicle (hM3Dq-negative mice) were used as controls. CX3CR1CreER(+/-) or hM3Dq(+/-) littermate controls were used as additional hM3Dqnegative controls. To avoid expression of h3MDq in circulating myeloid-derived CX3CR1 positive cells, experiments were performed no sooner than 1 month following tamoxifen treatment (P90) to allow turnover of peripheral myeloid-derived cells, as previously described (Parkhurst et al., 2013) .\n\nAll procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Use Subcommittee (protocol 2016-103 and 2016-104) . The study also complied with the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments). Animals were housed maximum of four by cage (28x18 author/funder. All rights reserved.

They were maintained on a 12h/12h light-dark cycle in non-SPF conditions.\n\nExperimental groups consisted of 4-6 month old CNO-treated CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice.\n\nVehicle-treated CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) animals were used as controls. CX3CR1CreER(+/-) littermate males were used as additional controls. Mice were randomly assigned to a treatment group and investigators were blinded during experimental procedures.\n\nTamoxifen (Sigma, cat#T56648) was dissolved at 100 mg/ml in 10% ethanol/90% corn oil. To induce DREADD expression, tamoxifen (75 mg/kg; i.p.) was injected once per day for 5 consecutive days. For cell culture assays, the tamoxifen active metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma, cat#H6278) was used instead of tamoxifen. 4-OHT was dissolved in 100% ethanol and used at concentration of 5 \u00b5M. Clozapine N-Oxide (CNO, Tocris, cat#4936) was dissolved in 0.5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Calcium dye Rhod-2 AM (Abcam, cat#ab142780) was used at a final concentration of 5 \u00b5M in 1% DMSO. Store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOCC) inhibitor SKF-96365 (Santa Cruz, cat#130495-35-1) was diluted in water and used at 20 \u00b5M. E. coli 0111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#L3012, Ec#297-473-0, lot#WI150506) was dissolved in saline and used at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, i.p. This dose of LPS was chosen because it is the minimum effective dose to elicit pro-inflammatory cytokine response and sickness behavior in mice (Berg et al., 2004) . author/funder.

Secondary antibodies used include Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse (1:1000, ThermoFisher, cat#A32727, RRID: AB_2535783) and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit (1:1000, ThermoFisher, cat#A-21070, RRID:AB_10372583).\n\nCX3CR1CreER-hM3Dq mice underwent intracardiac perfusion with 1X PBS for 5 min and 4% PFA in PBS for 5 min. Brains were extracted and postfixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. Brains were then cut into 40-\u00b5m thick sections using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica). Staining for Iba1, HA, NeuN or GFAP was performed as described previously (Kolisnyk et al., 2016) using Alexa Fluor 555/633tagged secondary antibodies and Hoechst. Sections were mounted on glass slides using Fluorescent-G mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat#17984-25) and imaged using an SP8 confocal microscope (Leica) equipped with a 20x/0.75 dry or a 40x/1.3 oil objective. At least 4 sections were imaged for each animal (N=5) for each condition, with at least 6 fields imaged for each section. Images were analyzed using ImageJ Cell Counter plugin. 075-CL) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, cat#10438026) and 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, cat#15140-122) . Cells were plated on 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks coated with poly-D-lysine (10\u00b5g/mL, Sigma Aldrich, cat#P9155) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The culture medium was changed after 3 days and then every 5 days until confluency (12-18 days in vitro).\n\nTo obtain pure microglia cultures, flasks of mixed glial cultures were shaken at 200 rpm for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Floating microglia were collected by centrifugation (380g for 10 min) and seeded at ~1\u00d7105 cells/ml on poly-D-lysine-coated dishes containing 50% old/50% new media. On the following day, culture medium was supplemented with 5 \u00b5M 4-OHT and incubated for 48 h for optimal induction of hM3Dq expression. Approximately 5\u00d7105 cells were obtained per brain used.\n\nImmunocytochemistry was done on microglia plated on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of ~1\u00d7104 cells per well. Cells were obtained from three independent cultures of three different litters to confirm HA expression. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.1% Triton X-100, cultures were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-HA, anti-Iba1, and anti-GFAP) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rabbit, 1:500) and Hoechst (1:2000) . Coverslips were then mounted on glass slides using Immumount (Thermo Fisher) medium and imaged using an FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 20x/0.75, 30x/1.05 or 60x/1.35 objective.

Cultures were washed with Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer (129 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.8 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES) supplied with 1 mM CaCl2, incubated for 45 min with 5 \u00b5M of red spectrum fluorescent dye Rhod-2 AM at 37 \u00b0C, washed again 3 times with calcium-free KRH and incubated in KRH with or without calcium for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. Intracellular Ca2+ was recorded with a FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a 30x/1.05 objective. The imaging field was chosen to contain cells expressing hM3Dq as shown by mCitrine fluorescence (ex488/em505-550). Time kinetics were done with a 2.5-second step. After 100 s of background recording, 3 \u00b5M CNO, 1 mM ATP and 2 \u00b5M ionomycin or 10 \u00b5M thapsigargin (for KRH with or without calcium, respectively) were added consecutively to the dish. Rhod-2 fluorescence was registered using 546 nm excitation laser and 560-660 nm emission filter. ROIs were assigned and quantified for each cell in the imaging field using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Integrated fluorescence was normalized to the average signal during background recording. At least three independent cultures were obtained from three different litters and at least 50 cells were imaged for each condition.\n\nControl cells and 4-OHT-treated cells on poly-D-lysine-coated 35-mm petri dishes were kept in bath solution containing (in mM): 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES and 5 glucose.\n\nFor patch-clamp recordings, KCl in the bath solution was replaced with NaCl (containing 135 mM author/funder.

Patch electrodes were pulled from thin-wall glass tubes (World Precision Instruments, Inc.; Sarasota, FL) using a PP-830 pipette puller (Narishige, Japan). The electrode was filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 140 Cs-gluconate, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Cs-BAPTA, and 10 HEPES following a previously described protocol (Zweifach and Lewis, 1996) with modifications. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH and/or KOH, and the osmolarity was adjusted to ~300 mOsm. Under voltage-clamp conditions, whole-cell patch recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) by a person blinded to the treatment compounds. After measuring membrane capacitance of the test cell, voltage ramps (from -100mV to +50mV over 150 ms) were repeatedly applied to the cell every 10 s, revealing the current-voltage relationship. When stable recordings of baseline transmembrane current were achieved, the test cells were perfused with 3 \u00b5M CNO for 6 min, followed by application of 20 \u00b5M SKF-96365. The recorded electrical signal was digitized at 10kHz, low-pass at filtered (1 kHz), acquired on-line using the program pClamp (Molecular Devices), and saved in a computer for off-line analysis. The current density (pA/pF) at different voltages for each test cell was averaged and plotted for report. At least 15 cells from three different litters were analyzed for each testing condition.\n\nMicroglia were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (~2\u00d7104 cells/glass) and incubated in DMEM/F12 (Multicell, cat#319-075-CL) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, cat#10438026) and 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, cat#15140-122) for 1 day. After approximately 24 hours, 5 \u00b5M 4-OHT was added and incubated for another 2 days.\n\nPhagocytosis assay was performed as described previously (de Jong et al., 2008) .

Microglia cultures were then washed gently with ice cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min.\n\nImmunocytochemistry was then performed for HA and Iba1 as described above. Microglia cultures were prepared from three separate litters, both male and female pups were used for cultures.\n\nNumber of cells, number of FluoSpheres, and number of cells containing FluoSpheres were quantified using ImageJ Cell Counter plugin.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from the hippocampus using Aurum Total RNA mini-kit (Bio-Rad, cat#732-6870) and phenol/chloroform mix (Invitrogen, cat#15593-031). cDNA was synthesized from 2 \u00b5g of RNA using High Capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems, cat#4368814). qPCR was performed in a CFX96 Real-time system (Bio-Rad) using SensiFAST SYBR NO-ROX kit (Invitrogen, cat#BIO-98020) and specific primer sets (shown below) for TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and RPL13a as the reference gene. Experimental groups consisted of at least 7 animals. Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and results were expressed as fold of change from control.

All experiments were completed with 4-6 month old male CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice during the light period (between 10:00 and 16:00). Three cohorts consisting of at least 8 mice per group were tested over three consecutive days. The first cohort was tested for open field and social preference. The second cohort was used for light-dark box, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test. The third cohort was used for social memory. Experimenter was blind to treatment.\n\nOpen field activity was assessed as previously described (Janickova et The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.27.921809 doi: bioRxiv preprint Bonferroni post hoc analysis was used. For all open field experiments assessing LPS-induced neuroinflammatory behavior, student's t-test was used for analysis.\n\nLight-dark test was performed as previously described (Depino et al., 2008) . Mice were automatically recorded with VersaMax Tracking System (X-Y and Z sensors) in an open field box (40.64\u00d740.64 cm2) containing a dark enclosure (Opto-Varimex-5 Light/Dark Box, 0150-LDB) within the top half of the box. Mice were placed under the hole of the dark enclosure and allowed to freely move for 5 min. Data are represented as total time the mice spent in the half without the dark enclosure. The crossover measurementwhich records time spent in one region until the animal's body fully enters the other regionwas used to prevent mice poking their heads out of the dark enclosure from being tracked as light side activity. Student's t-test was used for analysis.\n\nTo assess anxiety-like behavior, the elevated plus maze was performed as previously described (Janickova et al., 2019) . Additional details are as follows. A maze with two open arms and two enclosed arms (open arms: 30\u00d75 cm, surrounded by a 0.5-cm-high border; closed arms: 30\u00d75 cm, surrounded by 19-cm-high walls) (Med Associates Inc., St Albans, USA) was used. Mice were placed on the central platform facing an open arm and were allowed to freely explore for 5 min.\n\nANY-maze tracking software (Stoelting Co.) recorded locomotor activity during the test. Total time mice spent in the open arms of the maze was compared using a Student's t-test.\n\nForced swim test was completed similarly to a previously described procedure (Beraldo et al., 2015) .

Mice were placed in the beaker of water, and immobility/mobility was recorded for 6 min. The first min of the trial was discarded to account for the habituation phase. Data expressed as time of immobility during the last 5 min of the trial were analyzed using Student's t-test.\n\nSociability was assessed as previously described (Kwon et al., 2006) . Briefly, testing was done in a three-chambered apparatus (15\u00d790\u00d718.5 cm divided into three chambers of 15\u00d729 cm and separated by dividers with a central 3.8\u00d73.8 cm door) (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT, USA) that offers the subject a choice between a social stimulus and an object. Mice were first habituated for 10 min to the three-chamber apparatus and two empty metal mesh cylinders at each end (Leite et al., 2016) . Mice were then locked in the center of the chamber for 5 min, during which a novel object (green lego block) was placed under the cylinder at one end, and a juvenile mouse of different background was placed under the cylinder at the other end. During the 10 min task, time spent investigating the object and the juvenile mouse was defined as the time a mouse spent sniffing through the holes of either cylinder and was manually scored by an investigator blind to the treatment. In baseline experiments, data were analyzed using student's t-test. In LPS experiments, data were analyzed using repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis.\n\nSocial memory was completed as previously described (Prado et al., 2006) . Briefly, mice were singly housed 4 days prior to the experiment to establish territorial dominance. Immediately before testing, mice were habituated to an empty metal mesh cylinder for 10 min in their home cage.

Time of investigation was defined as the time a mouse spent sniffing through the holes of the cylinder and was manually recorded by an investigator blind to treatment. The task consisted of five trials, each 5 min long and separated with 15 min intertrial intervals. The same juvenile intruder was used for the first four trials and a new juvenile intruder was introduced in trial five to assess social memory. Time spent investigating the juvenile intruder during each of the 5 trials was compared using repeated measures two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons with Bonferroni post hoc analysis.\n\nIn order to control for potential recognition deficits, an experimental design similar to social memory was used (Prado et al., 2006) . Initially, a 10-min habituation phase was given where the mice explored an empty holed acrylic cylinder in the test cage. Mice then underwent five consecutive 3 min trials with 10 min intertrial intervals. A green rectangular lego block was placed under the cylinder in the first four trials, whereas a red rectangular lego block was used in the last trial. The time spent sniffing the acrylic cylinder (within 5cm; defined by Any-maze software) was measured in each of the five trials. Results are graphed as time (seconds) the mice spent investigating the cylinder during each trial and were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures with Bonferroni post hoc analysis.\n\nOlfaction was assessed as previously described (Prado et al., 2006) . Briefly, to test for olfactory deficits, mice were exposed to the same scent (vanilla extract) for four consecutive trials and were exposed to another scent (caramel extract) on the fifth trial. Each trial was 3 min in duration with 10 min intertrial intervals. A 5\u00d75 cm2 paper towel was soaked with 3 large drops of either vanilla author/funder. All rights reserved.

The paper towel was replaced with a newly soaked one before each trial to maintain a consistent level of scent during each trial. Time of sniffing was manually recorded by an investigator blind to treatment. Time spent sniffing during each trial was compared using two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad software (Prism). For two-group comparisons, Student's unpaired t-test was used when samples displayed a normal distribution. For multiple groups comparisons, one-way ANOVA was used followed by Tukey's post hoc test when appropriate. For multiple factor comparisons, two-way ANOVA was used with Bonferroni's post hoc test.

Specifically, we crossed the tamoxifen inducible Cre mouse line CX3CR1-CreER (Parkhurst et al., 2013) to the R26-hM3Dq/mCitrine mice (Zhu et al., 2016) to generate CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-), which express hM3Dq under control of the strong ubiquitous promoter CAG separated by the DREADD coding sequence by a floxed STOP cassette (Fig. 1A) .\n\nThe hM3Dq carries an HA-tag, which allows detailed spatial localization of the receptor in the cell and is bicistronic, as it is followed by a self-cleaving P2Apeptide and a mCitrine reporter (Zhu et al., 2016) . Tamoxifen-induced Cre expression results in recombination (allowing removal of the STOP cassette) and persistent expression of hM3Dq in long-lived microglia. Conversely, shortlived myeloid cells (monocytes and inflammatory macrophages), which are rapidly replenished by CX3CR1-bone marrow precursors, do not carry Cre-mediated recombination 30 days after tamoxifen injection (Parkhurst et al., 2013) . Thus, to permit Cre-dependent expression of hM3Dq almost exclusively in microglia, all in vivo experiments were conducted at least one month after tamoxifen treatment.\n\nBrain sections co-stained for HA to label hM3Dq and markers of microglia (Iba1), neurons (NeuN) or astrocytes (GFAP, Fig. 1B) showed that hM3Dq was expressed mainly at the cell surface of Iba1-positive microglia, while virtually no co-localization with NeuN or GFAP was observed.\n\nA month after tamoxifen injection, 84.2% of counted cells were positive for both HA and Iba1, while 12.5% of cells were Iba1-positive only and 3.3% of cells were HA-positive only (n= 796 author/funder.

HA expression was not observed in either non-tamoxifen treated CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) nor in CX3CR1CreER(+/-) littermate control mice (data not shown).\n\nTo investigate the effect of hM3Dq activation on microglia, we initially isolated primary microglia from CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice and treated cultures with the active tamoxifen metabolite 4-OHT to drive CreER-dependent hM3Dq expression ( Fig. 2A) . Immunofluorescence analysis showed colocalization of the microglia marker Iba1 with HA-tagged hM3Dq (Fig. 2B ).\n\nCX3CR1CreER(+/-) littermates (Fig. 2B) .\n\nActivation of h3MDq has been shown to increase intracellular Ca2+ signaling in cells (Pei et al., 2008; Urban and Roth, 2015) . We used CNO (3 \u00b5M) to activate hM3Dq in Rhod2-loaded microglia isolated from CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice and test for hM3Dq-mediated changes in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. hM3Dq-positive microglia cells were identified by the expression of mCitrine (Zhu et al., 2016) . Application of CNO increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in the presence (Fig. 2C , green traces) and in the absence (Fig. 2D , green traces) of extracellular Ca2+ in hM3Dq-positive microglia cells, indicating mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Microglia isolated from CX3CR1CreER(+/-) littermate control mice did not show a CNO-induced increase in Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 2C, D; Fig.2E , F, black traces). However, both positive and negative cells responded to ATP and ionomycin or thapsigargin, used as positive controls (Fig. 2C-F) . These experiments indicate that hM3Dq expression in microglia allows selective activation of Ca2+ signaling pathways by CNO. author/funder. All rights reserved.

To test whether CNO-induced Ca2+ signaling activates SOC entry through a specific channel, we made voltage-clamp recordings in primary microglia from CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice in a whole-cell configuration. By applying voltage ramps (from -100mV to +50mV over 150ms) to test cells, we found that activation of h3MDq by CNO evoked a current appearing only at negative membrane potentials (Figs. 2G and 2H; F(2,36)=7.663, p=0.0017, oneway ANOVA), which has been previously related to SOCCs (Michaelis et al., 2015) . This CNO- Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ has been shown to be important for many microglial functions including phagocytosis (Heo et al., 2015; Hoffmann et al., 2003; Toescu et al., 1998 ).\n\nThus, we tested whether in vitro activation of hM3Dq by CNO facilitates phagocytosis ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.27.921809 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nAs alterations in the intracellular calcium concentration have been shown to be important for modulation of cytokine expression by microglia (Goghari et al., 2000; Hoffmann et al., 2003; McLarnon et al., 2001; Tvrdik and Kalani, 2017) , we investigated whether acute activation of hM3Dq alters microglia cytokine expression under normal conditions as well as during LPSinduced neuroinflammation. To test this, we used qPCR to measure mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice that were treated with CNO or vehicle prior to receiving either LPS or saline injection (Fig. 3A) .

To examine whether increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by hM3Dq activation in microglia also leads to behavioral changes we conducted a series of behavioral analyses where over 3 days mice were treated with CNO (1.0 mg/kg; i.p.) or vehicle (0.5% DMSO in saline) 30 min prior to individual behavioral tests (Fig.   4A ). author/funder.

To test the possibility that repetitive activation of hM3Dq could affect the subsequent microglial responses to LPS, we treated CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice for 4 days with vehicle or CNO\n\n(1 mg/kg), then challenged them with LPS 2 hours before collecting brain tissues for evaluation of mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or IL-6 (Fig. 5A ).\n\nInterestingly, with the 4-days CNO treatment, the chronic activation of microglial hM3Dq alone no longer increased mRNA for inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1: Fig mice that do not express hM3Dq (CX3CR1CreER(+/-)) and were submitted to the same protocol CNO had no effect (Fig. 5E-G) , validating our findings that modulation of LPS-induced cytokine mRNA was attributable to hM3Gq signaling.\n\nTo examine whether prior hM3Dq activation in microglia influences LPS-induced behavioral changes, we treated CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice with CNO for 4 consecutive author/funder.

As control groups we used CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice that received vehicle instead of CNO. Weight analysis during the 5 days showed that activation of hM3Dq with CNO alone did not lead to significant change in weight. On the other hand, both CNO-and vehicle-treated mice showed significant weight loss after LPS injection ( Fig. 6B ; time: F(4,80)=51.43, p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA repeated measures).\n\nMice in which hM3Dq was activated by CNO showed longer social interaction in the threechamber social preference task than vehicle-treated mice when examined at 2 hour after LPS indicating that, as expected (Corona et al., 2010) , peripheral LPS injection decreased social interaction. Importantly, exploratory activity of CNO-treated mice injected with LPS (338.00 \uf0b1 20.51; Fig 6C; N=11) was very similar to that of mice that did not receive LPS, with or without CNO (319.8 \uf0b1 18.37; Fig 4G; N=20) . These results suggest that chronic activation of hM3Dq in microglia protects against LPS-induced suppression of social interaction. Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, vehicle-injected mice showed increased social interaction (Fig. 6C) , consistent with the time course of recovery of social interaction following low-dose LPS injection (Corona et al., 2010) . At the 24h time point, there was no difference between vehicle-and CNO-treated groups.\n\nA similar protective effect was observed when we tested mice for locomotor activity in the open author/funder.

Together, these data suggest that chronic activation of hM3Dq in microglia protects against LPS-induced sickness behavior.\n\nUsing the Cre-lox system to drive specific and inducible expression of hM3Dq in microglia, we dissected the action of muscarinic M3 receptor (the hM3Dq progenitor) signaling in these cells in vivo, with implications for other GPCRs that are also Gq-associated. Our results demonstrate that acute activation of microglial hM3Dq-signaling enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. In contrast, chronic activation of this pathway attenuates LPS-mediated cytokine expression and sickness behavior.\n\nTamoxifen-induced Cre expression in CX3CR1-positive cells allowed persistent expression of hM3Dq in long-lived microglia but not in short-lived myeloid cells. Previous validation of the CX3CR1CreER-dependent manipulation of gene expression in microglia using the reporter Rosa26-STOP-DsRed mice showed that in the absence of tamoxifen, very few (~0.3%) CX3CR1-positive cells expressed DsRed. In contrast, 5 days after tamoxifen treatment, the majority of CX3CR1positive cells were positive for DsRed. Also, 30 days following tamoxifen treatment, more than 90% of microglia still expressed DsRed (Parkhurst et al., 2013) , whereas less than 2% of CX3CR1positive monocytes in the blood showed the expression due to their rapid turnover. Importantly, because microglia are long-lived (Fuger et al., 2017) , they continue to express the recombined gene (Parkhurst et al., 2013) . Our results are compatible with these previous observations, as we detected hM3Dq in microglia up to almost a year after tamoxifen treatment (not shown). Also, we did not author/funder.

These results confirm that the mouse model we generated expresses hM3Dq specifically in microglia.\n\nMicroglia express several GPCRs that associate to Gq-signaling heterotrimeric G proteins, such as group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1, mGluR5) (Biber et al., 1999) , purinergic receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11) (Koizumi et al., 2013) , adrenergic (\uf0611AR) (Mori et al., 2002) and the M3 muscarinic receptor (Pannell et al., 2016) . Although these receptors are activated by different ligands, they are all able to elicit Gq pathway activation. Gq proteins are known to mobilize calcium through inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-regulation of intracellular stores and diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C activation (Mizuno and Itoh, 2009 ). Our in vitro experiments showed that CNO was able to elicit an increase in microglial intracellular calcium concentration, only in hM3Dq-positive cells. This increase was seen in both calcium-free media and media containing calcium, indicating that hM3Dq was functional and the source of calcium influx is, at least in part, from intracellular stores. The functionality of hM3Dq and the signaling pathway activated were also confirmed by patch-clamp experiments showing that hM3Dq activation by CNO induced an increase in conductance in microglia that was abolished by the SOCC inhibitor.\n\nOur results also showed that activation of hM3Dq by CNO increased phagocytosis in cultured microglia. Conversely, activation of muscarinic receptors by carbachol led to increased chemotaxis and decreased phagocytosis in microglia (Pannell et al., 2016) . It is possible that the difference in results stems from the fact that while CNO allows for specific activation of M3 muscarinic receptors, carbachol, a non-selective cholinergic agonist, activates all subtypes of muscarinic and also nicotinic receptors.

Accumulating evidence indicate that the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli can be very plastic (Neher and Cunningham, 2019) . Upon previously encountering an inflammatory stimulus, microglia can adjust their activation state and elicit amplified responses to a secondary inflammatory insult, a phenomenon referred to as microglial pre-conditioning or \"priming\" (Neher and Cunningham, 2019) . Microglia can also develop long-lasting molecular reprograming that suppresses microglial activation upon a secondary insult, a phenotype referred to as \"innate immune memory\" or tolerance (Netea et al., 2016; Netea et al., 2011) . Microglia have recently been shown to display immune training and tolerance in response to repeated daily peripheral stimulation with LPS. One low-dose intraperitoneal injection of LPS led to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the brain in response to the second injection. Conversely, upon the fourth daily LPS injection microglia barely responded, showing decreased cytokine levels in the brain, an indication of immune tolerance (Wendeln et al., 2018) . We showed that acute activation of hM3Dq in microglia strongly induced brain TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA expression, however, this \"proinflammatory\" effect was completely lost after repeated (4 days) hM3Dq activation, suggesting that repeated activation of muscarinic M3 receptors in microglia can result in microglial tolerance.\n\nRecurrent hM3Dq activation also diminished LPS-induced cytokine production and prevented LPS-induced sickness behavior, raising an intriguing possibility that hM3Dq-signaling alone could lead to microglial immune memory formation. Remarkably, pharmacological studies using muscarinic M3-knockout mice showed that in the periphery, M3-signaling is important for immune author/funder. All rights reserved.

M3-knockout mice showed reduced CD4+ T cell activation and cytokine production, which resulted in impaired ability to resolve a secondary infection (Darby et al., 2015) .\n\nIt is important to note that neither chronic nor acute activation of hM3Dq in microglia affected normal mouse behavior, indicating that hM3Dq activation per se does not lead to sickness behavior or other deleterious effects. Thus, these results suggest that chemogenetics can be a powerful approach to modulate microglia and modify neuroinflammation.\n\nActivation of microglia using DREADDs has been reported previously using viral constructs (Grace et al., 2016; Grace et al., 2018) . In these studies, hM3Dq or hM4Di DREADDs were expressed in spinal cord microglia by intrathecal administration of AAV9 vector constructs.\n\nWe avoided using this approach because microglia can respond to viral infection (Kunitsyna et al., 2016; Martianova et al., 2019) , which may be a confounder in these types of studies. In virusinfected animals, CNO-induced activation of hM3Dq was able to elicit allodynia in male rats (Grace et al., 2018) . In the present study, CX3CR1CreER(+/-)-hM3Dq(+/-) mice showed no visual signs of pain following either chronic or acute CNO treatment, based on the basal behavioral performance that was not different from controls. However, because we did not specifically test allodynia, we cannot compare our observations to their results. In agreement with our observations with acute CNO treatment, Grace and colleagues also showed increased pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis when activating hM3Dq signaling acutely in BV-2 microglia cells.\n\nOur data suggest that activation of the muscarinic Gq pathway could be involved in inflammatory cytokine production and immune memory formation, which can likely be extended to other Gq-activating GPCRs.
