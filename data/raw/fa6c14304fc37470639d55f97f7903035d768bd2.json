{"title": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB impairs keratinocyte fitness by abrogating growth factor signalling", "body": "Bacteria can employ many different strategies to infect host cells. In all cases the initiation of an infection requires the recognition of specific structures on the host cell plasma membrane. This is often achieved by lectins, which bind to glycosylated residues on proteins or lipids present on the cell surface, mediating the attachment of the bacterium to the cell.\n\nMultivalency is an important feature of most lectins. On one hand, multivalency increases the binding affinity and specificity of the lectin-glycan interaction [1] . On the other hand, the binding of lectins to multiple cell surface receptors can induce receptor clustering and plasma membrane rearrangement, triggering their entry into the host [2] [3] [4] .\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium, ubiquitously spread in nature. It is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals, due to its resistance to most of the available antibiotics and its ability to form impenetrable biofilms. Hence, it has been classified in the \"priority 1/critical\" category of the World Health Organisation (WHO) global priority pathogens list (global PPL) of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to promote the research and development of new antibiotic treatments [5] .\n\nIt is frequently implicated in hospital-acquired infections, where it has been reported to cause different types of infections. Wounded skin, following traumatic injuries, surgery or burns, is one of the preferentially targeted tissue by the bacterium, which has also been associated with the delay and prevention of wound healing. The presence of P. aeruginosa correlates in fact with a bad prognosis of healing and leads to the persistence of the inflammatory stage of the wound healing process [6, 7] . misregulates growth factor receptor signalling and subverts the endocytic system, leading to the impairment of vital keratinocyte functions.\n\nAlthough LecB is enriched in biofilms, which often characterise chronic wounds, no evidence had yet been shown of its presence in wounds. Before we addressed the effects of LecB on human keratinocytes on a molecular level, we first verified the presence of LecB in infected human wounds. To this aim, we collected chronic wounded tissue from patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as shown by wound swabs. We stained the paraffinembedded tissue sections with an antibody against P. aeruginosa to confirm its presence in the wounds. As control, we used normal skin samples. Indeed, we could detect the presence of P. aeruginosa, either as biofilm or in the form of small colonies (Fig. 1A) . We subsequently stained for LecB and strikingly, we found this lectin to be distributed in the wound sections, both in the keratinocyte layers and in the dermis (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, no LecB was found in the normal skin control sample, proving the specificity of the antibody.\n\nThis result provides the first evidence of LecB in chronic human wounds, with the superinfection possibly playing a role in the wound chronicity.\n\nNext, in order to study the mechanism of action of LecB in molecular detail, we moved to normal human keratinocytes (NHKs), the predominant cell type in the epidermis. LecB plays a crucial role in the adhesion of the bacterium to host cells [17] , implying the necessity for the lectin to target plasma membrane receptors via their glycosylated residues. Therefore, we screened for potential LecB interacting proteins via a pull-down assay. Briefly, we cultured NHKs in presence or absence of 5 \u03bcg/ml (106 nM) of biotinylated LecB, lysed them under conditions that preserve protein-protein interactions and incubated with streptavidin agarose beads to precipitate LecB in complex with interacting proteins. We performed on bead digestion and analysed the obtained peptides by protein mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed the presence of important cell growth factor receptors within the enriched proteins in the LecB pull down fractions (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). The mass spectrometry results were verified by western blot, confirming the presence of two of the major keratinocyte growth factor receptors implicated in epidermal keratinocytes proliferation and migration, the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) and the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGF-1R) [20, 21] , in the eluted fractions. In addition to stimulating the cells with biotinylated LecB, an excess of L-fucose (30 mM) was added to clarify whether the interaction with IGF-1R or EGFR-1R was carbohydrate-dependent. As L-fucose saturates the carbohydratebinding pockets of LecB, no binding to cell membranes could be detected when LecB and Lfucose were simultaneously applied to the cells as neither IGF-1R or EGF-1R, nor LecB could be precipitated ( Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A ).\n\nWe further investigated in detail the effect of LecB on insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R), due to its higher fold enrichment. We hypothesised that LecB interaction with IGF-1R, may trigger receptor internalisation. Indeed, surface staining experiments showed that IGF-1R is depleted from the plasma membrane of keratinocytes in a time-dependent manner as a consequence of LecB incubation (Fig. 2B, C) . IGF-1R internalisation from the cell surface was also visible after stimulation with 100 ng/ml of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A, B) . However, while IGF-1 induced a fast autophosphorylation of the receptor on multiple tyrosine residues (Tyr1135, Tyr1131 and 7 Tyr1136), LecB did not (Fig. 2D , E, F). Thus, we concluded that LecB does not lead to the activation of IGF-1R, but rather triggers a \"silent\" receptor internalisation.\n\nGrowth factor receptors activate two major downstream signalling pathways, the MAPK/ERK and the PI3K-AKT pathways, which are responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of protein synthesis and cell proliferation [22, 23] . While the former ultimately results in the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the latter activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In order to check whether these two signalling cascades were affected by LecB, we monitored ERK1/2 and mTOR phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 and Ser2448, respectively. The amounts of phosphorylated proteins were normalised to the respective pan-proteins. Indeed, LecB did not lead to the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and mTOR. ERK1/2 phosphorylation actually significantly decreased 1 h post stimulation ( Fig. 3A-D) . In contrast, LecB activated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy and nutrient status sensor, activated in response to cellular energy depletion (Fig. 3A , E). AMPK phosphorylation significantly increased after 3 h post stimulation and was inhibited by addition of L-fucose, confirming to be LecB-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A , B).\n\nThe activation of AMPK correlates with the inhibition of ERK1/2, since the latter has been reported to negatively regulate the phosphorylation of AMPK via the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) [24, 25] . Furthermore, consistently with the inhibition of ERK1/2 activity, we observed a strong cyclin D1 degradation (Fig. 3F, G) , which led to the arrest of cell cycle and thus to the reduction of cell viability (Fig. 3H) . Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect was preceded by an extensive cytoplasmic vacuolisation (Fig. 3I ). L-fucose supplementation rescued the cells and restored viability (Fig. 3H, I) . Altogether, these observations elucidate that LecB impairs a key mechanism that regulates cell survival and proliferation, resulting in the blockage of cell cycle.\n\nNext, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to further investigate the cellular vacuolisation triggered by LecB treatment. Untreated keratinocytes present several light content vacuoles (Category 1), corresponding to endo-lysosomal compartments (Fig. 4A ), LecB treated cells display numerous degradative vesicles (Category 2) and an additional type of vacuoles (Category 3), with irregular shapes and variable sizes (Fig. 4B) . Surprisingly, these vacuoles contain a large number of clearly defined intraluminal vesicles (Fig. 4B ) and they seem to cluster together to form an intricate network (Fig. 4B', zoom) . To get insights into the origin of these structures, we performed a time-course experiment by collecting cells at different time points, from 30 min to12 h after exposure to LecB (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A -E). The Category 3 vacuoles were detectable after 30 min of LecB incubation, but they were quite rare. However, they became more prominent 3 h post LecB exposure (SI Appendix, Fig. S4D ). Interestingly, specific regions of the plasma membrane of the LecB-treated keratinocytes were extremely irregular and characterised by the presence of ruffle-like structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A-E) . As the number of Category 3 vesicles located at these regions increased over time, we hypothesised that the intraluminal vesicles-containing vacuoles originate from subdomains of the plasma membrane upon LecB interaction with surface proteins. This notion implies that LecB is present in the Category 3 vacuoles. To test this hypothesis, we exposed keratinocytes to biotinylated LecB before performing immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) using anti-biotin antibodies (Fig. 4C-F) . Notably, we specifically detected LecB on both the limiting membrane of the Category 3 vacuoles and to a minor . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Moreover, we also identified biotinylated LecB at the plasma membrane, where it was enriched in the ruffle-like regions (Fig. 4F ), further indicating that LecB drives the formation of a plethora of vesicles originating from the cell plasma membrane.\n\nNext, we proceeded to characterise the intracellular LecB-positive vacuoles detected by IEM in immunofluorescence experiments, where keratinocytes exposed to fluorescently-labelled LecB were stained with antibodies recognising different organelle marker proteins. We found a time-dependent colocalisation of LecB with microtubule-associated proteins 1A/B light chain 3B (LC3) and ras-related protein Rab-9 (RAB9A), which are generally enriched on autophagosomes and late endosomes, respectively (Fig. 5A, B) . Moreover, but to a minor extent, we also observed a time-dependent colocalisation between LecB and lysosomalassociated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A ). In contrast, no colocalisation with the recycling endosome marker protein RAB11 was detected (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ). Endocytosis and internalisation of LecB was also assessed biochemically by analysing the ubiquitination of the proteins associated with LecB, as a large number of growth factor receptors undergo ubiquitination upon endocytosis [26, 27] . In a time-course pull-down experiment we detected a decrease of the total levels of IGF-1R and an increase of the overall cell ubiquitin levels in the eluted fraction, indicating that on one hand IGF-1R is targeted for degradation and on the other hand that LecB interacting partners are ubiquitinated, thus very likely internalised (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A , B).\n\nAs we saw a time-dependent increase in colocalisation between LC3 and LecB structures ( Fig. 5A) , we decided to investigate this further. LC3 is an ubiquitin-like protein that upon autophagy induction is converted from a cytoplasmic form (i.e., LC3-I) to one associated to Fig. S7A , B). However, we did not detect a turnover of this protein since no difference in LC3-II levels could be observed when LecB-treated keratinocytes were incubated with either bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal inhibitor, or cycloheximide to assess LC3-II stability (SI Appendix, Fig. S7C -F).\n\nFinally, we investigated whether IGF-1R also colocalised with LecB-/ LC3-positive vesicles.\n\nNotably, while we found colocalisation between IGF-1R, LecB and LC3, we did not observe LC3 recruitment when cells were treated exclusively with IGF-1 (Fig. 5C , SI Appendix, Fig. S5C ). Taken together these results demonstrate that LecB is trafficked towards degradative compartments, leading to missorting of IGF-1R. They also suggest that LAP participates in targeting LecB-IGF-1R complexes to degradation.\n\nBacterial lectins have predominantly been described as adhesion proteins, which promote the attachment of the bacterium to cell plasma membrane through their interaction with host cell [41, 42] , via the transcription factors c-Fos [43] and Myc [44] . Cells entering into the S phase show low levels of cyclin D1, which is again induced and reaches high levels to ensure the progression . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/629972 doi: bioRxiv preprint into the G2 phase [45] . LecB stimulation mediates a strong reduction of cyclin D1, whose levels are not restored over time, resulting in the arrest of the cell cycle and subsequently in the induction of cell death. Therefore, we speculate that LecB, despite devoid of catalytic activity, may contribute in promoting tissue damage to facilitate bacterial dissemination and extracellular multiplication during wound infections. Furthermore, it is possible that LecB induces a similar fate to other cell types, including immune cells, thus promoting the infection. Nonetheless, future work will provide new insights on the impact of LecB on the immune response during chronic wound infections.\n\nInterestingly, the cytotoxic effect of LecB was preceded by an extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation. Electron microscopy inspection of LecB-treated cells revealed the peculiar nature of these vacuoles that over time accumulate and display an increased number of intraluminal vesicles. We also show that these vacuoles originate from ruffle-like plasma membrane regions where LecB was also found to be enriched. In the case of other bacterial lectins, such as the B-subunit of Shiga toxin (StxB) from Shigella dysenteriae and LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the sole interaction with the glycosphingolipid receptor globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3) is sufficient to drive membrane shape changes leading to their subsequent uptake [3, 46] . In the case of LecB, however, pull-down experiments point to the existence of several receptors, also attributable to the fact that fucosylation is a very common modification. Additionally, LecB exists as a tetramer and each monomer possesses a binding pocket with the highest affinity to L-fucose and its derivatives [8, 47] . Although the L-fucose dissociation constant is in the micromolar range (2.9 \u03bcM), an increase in avidity can be achieved by a higher degree of interactions. This implies that LecB might crosslink several different surface receptors, thus inducing a higher degree of membrane rearrangements that could explain the extensive alterations at the plasma membrane. Moreover, multiple . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Therefore, our data indicate that LC3 is recruited on LecB containing late endosomes, which may further favour their lysosomal degradation through a process that may be similar or identical to LAP. LAP can be triggered by several receptors. In addition to toll-like receptors (TLRs), whose signalling during phagocytosis rapidly recruits LC3 to phagosomes, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4 or the C-type lectin Dectin-1 can also induce LAP to efficiently clear dead cells and to facilitate antigen presentation, respectively[29, 48, 49] . LC3 can associate with single-membrane phagosomes even in absence of pathogens or dead cells, such in the case of phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium or during the secretion of mucins in goblet cells [50, 51] . Our data indicate that IGF-1R colocalises with LecB and LC3, suggesting that LAP is involved in IGF-1R sorting for degradation, following LecBmediated receptor internalisation.\n\nThe current model describes that tyrosine kinase receptors, upon ligand binding, are internalised and trafficked to early endosomes. From here, they can either be sorted to lysosomal degradation via MVBs or they can be recycled back to the plasma membrane. The equilibrium between IGF-1R degradation and recycling is essential to modulate receptor signalling [52, 53] . Our data demonstrate that IGF-1R trafficking is subverted upon LecB, which preferentially sorts the receptor towards degradative routes, without activating it. We do not know yet whether there is a direct or indirect interaction between LecB and IGF-1R, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, since IGF-1R is not the sole protein interacting with LecB in keratinocytes, we speculate that this \"targeting by degradation\" strategy can be valid for other membrane receptors as well (e.g., EGF-1R) and that it can be employed by P. aeruginosa to silence host cell receptors to favour tissue colonisation in wounds.\n\nWound infections represent a socio-economic burden for the healthcare system and, given that P. aeruginosa is very hard to eliminate with the available antibiotics, there is urgent need for the development of alternative therapeutic strategies [54, 55] . Taken together, our findings shed new light on the P. aeruginosa lectin LecB, showing that it is capable of inducing a succession of cellular events, despite being devoid of catalytic activity and by virtue of its sole capability to bind to sugar moieties on the plasma membrane, and can set the basis for a better understanding of P. aeruginosa wound infections.
