{"title": "27 Diarrhea in the foal Foal heat diarrhea Salmonellosis in the foal", "body": "Foal heat diarrhea is experienced by 75-80 per cent of normal foals. Foal heat diarrhea, as the term implies, occurs in foals from 6-14 days of age and coincides with the first estrus cycle in the post-partum mare. This appears to be coincidental as foals separated from their dams and fed a controlled diet will still develop diarrhea at the same age. The cause of foal heat diarrhea has been widely debated with strongyloidosis and changes in milk composition largely eliminated as possible causes. From the work of Masri et at. (1986) it appears that the diarrhea results from a physiological change within the gastrointestinal tract as the foal develops a normal bacterial flora.\n\nFoal heat diarrhea is most commonly a mild diarrhea that is malodorous and self limiting over a 7-day period. In a small number of foals the diarrhea may be profuse and may be prolonged, or it may initially resolve and then reoccur for an additional 2-3 days. The odor of diarrhea caused by rotavirus can often be distinguished from that of foal heat diarrhea. Foals show no adverse clinical signs with foal heat diarrhea, and remain bright, alert and responsive, afebrile, and they continue to suckle. The diarrhea 'scalds' the perineal area resulting in hair loss.\n\nThe diagnosis of foal heat diarrhea relies on the clinical signs presented by the foal. Routine hematology and biochemistry is normal. Foal heat diarrhea needs to be differentiated from other infectious causes of diarrhea including nutritional causes, viral diseases, and salmonellosis. On a large Thoroughbred stud the most likely differential diagnosis is rotavirus diarrhea. A good rule of thumb is to monitor the foal's nursing behavior and the size of the mare's mammary glands -foals with foal heat diarrhea will rarely go 'off suck' in contrast to foals with infectious causes of diarrhea.\n\nThere is no treatment necessary for foal heat diarrhea as the condition is self limiting. The foal's perineal area can be cleaned and protected from scalding with the application of petroleum jelly or zinc oxide. If the foal deteriorates or the diarrhea is prolonged another cause for the diarrhea should be considered and the use of anti-ulcer medications, intestinal protectants, antibiotics, and fluid therapy considered.\n\nFoals are most susceptible to viral diarrheas during the neonatal, perinatal, and suckling periods by virtue of being immunologically naive. The causative or associated viruses include \u2022 equine herpesvirus Type-I (EHV-l) \u2022 adenovirus \u2022 coronavirus \u2022 equine viral arteritis (EVA) \u2022 rotavirus \u2022 parvovi rus \u2022 viral infections that have not been completely identified but noted on fecal electron microscopy.\n\nMost viral diarrheas are considered to be highly infectious and are rarely diagnosed at the time the symptoms are present. The exception is rotavirus, the most commonly recognized viral gastroenteritis in foals that is readily diagnosed by ELISA testing. Viral diarrheas should be suspected whenever an outbreak of foal diarrhea is present and routine microbiology is nondiagnostic. Viral diarrhea can be diagnosed by \u2022 ELISA (rotavirus A) \u2022 electron microscopy of tissues and feces \u2022 polymerase chain reaction testing and immunoperoxidase (EHV-l) \u2022 virus isolation from fecal or tissue samples obtained at post-mortem examination.\n\nUnlike food animals where sacrifice to confirm a diagnosis may be elected, foals represent a population of companion animals where viral infections may be suspected but not confirmed, since the time involved in treatment can compromise ante-mortem diagnosis and post-mortem viral isolation. Koch's postulates are rarely documented in identifying viral causes of enteritis in the equine species.\n\nOften viral diarrheas can not be differentiated from bacterial diarrheas since incubation periods may be similar and the clinical presentation can vary from acute to moderate severity, dependent upon the degree of insult and age of the foal. Clinical signs can vary from slight -a febrile foal that is not nursing, to profoundprofuse watery to lightly hemorrhagic diarrhea accompanied by colic. The diarrhea can be fetid, and vary in color and consistency. In some cases atypical enteritis may be present in that the clinical assessment and blood values are consistent with enteritis but diarrhea is not present at the time of examination. Colic caused by enteritis may be difficult to differentiate from a surgical colic if blood values are reasonably normal and fever is not present (see Chapter 22). Abdominal pain associated with the early stages of viral enteritis can be severe, 494 with tympany and occasionally gastric reflux. Further clinical diagnostic procedures are indicated in these cases with ultrasound examination being the diagnostic method most useful to rule out intussusception, volvulus, torsion, or peritonitis. A percentage of enteritic foals are unresponsive to analgesics and cannot be differentiated from surgical cases until tympany has been relieved by the use of prokinetics or, more rarely, percutaneous trocarization. Trocarization is usually contraindicated wherever surgical options are available since foals should be considered more susceptible to secondary peritonitis than adults.\n\nTreatments for viral diarrheas are generally empirical and symptomatic \u2022 fluid and electrolyte therapy \u2022 plasma \u2022 antibiotics \u2022 anti-ulcer therapy \u2022 anti-diarrheal medications \u2022 analgesics \u2022 antipyretics Precautionary antibiotics and anti-ulcer medications (see Chapter 23) should be prescribed. Fluid therapy, oral or parenteral, for maintenance of normal hydration is the main objective of treatment. Fluid therapy is necessary to correct dehydration, shock, and electrolyte imbalances. In some cases colloids (plasma, albumin, or hetastarch) may assist in the intravascular retention of crystalloid (fluid) therapy. Other treatments include the use of antidiarrheal medications, analgesics, and antipyretics. The fluids and colloids selected are based on laboratory findings, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and clinical signs. Oral supplementation should include access to fresh and electrolyte water, and a salt block. Potassium deficits can be corrected in intravenous fluids at a rate of 0.5 mEq kg-1 h' or orally as potassium chloride in the form of 'lite' salt mixed with yogurt. Patients with reflux, ileus, or extreme cachexia may benefit from the initiation of total parenteral nutrition (with or without lipids). Antidiarrheal medications are rarely effective in altering the course of the diarrhea but medications such as bismuth subsalicylate and kaolin may help reduce bowel inflammation and provide for secondary toxin absorption and resorption when combined with activated charcoal. Oral plasma from adult donors has been used in cases of viral diarrhea in foals with questionable efficacy. Analgesic use in viral diarrheas should emphasize the discriminating use of ulcerogenic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAlDs). Dipyrone is not currently available commercially but has provided excellent analgesia in mild colic, along with its anti-pyretic activity, in foals with diarrhea of various causes. Intravenous and intramuscular butorphanol (in small animal dilutions) is useful in the control of colic without cardiovascular or ulcerogenic side effects. Xylazine may also be used to control colic but temporarily affects cardiovascular function and potentiates ileus.\n\nRotavirus diarrhea is considered to be species specific but may involve variant strains in foals. Exposure is from carrier adults, infected foals, and mechanical transmission by humans and fomites. The incubation period is 1-2 days and it is highly infectious to suckling foals of any age. The pathogenesis of infection primarily involves the intestinal epithelial cells. Villi become shortened or denuded, crypts become hyperplastic, and the ensuing diarrhea is combined secretory and malabsorptive enteritis. Additionally carbohydrate enzymes and lactose become deficient. The diarrhea, if present, is usually watery and distinctly fetid. Diagnosis is by ELISA testing or electron microscopy of feces for viral particle identification. Treatment is non-specific and the virus can be shed for approximately 5-7 days after the diarrhea has resolved. Medications containing lactase have been used to improve digestion of milk lactose, but the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven. A commercial modified live virus vaccine is currently available for use in mares prior to foaling to accentuate colostral antibodies. Foals from vaccinated mares can still become infected with rotavirus although the clinical signs may be attenuated.\n\nIn Ireland and central Kentucky a unique cyclic epizootic of a suspected form of rotavirus diarrhea was noted in 1987 and 1995, nicknamed the 'pink-rosewater diarrhea' or '36-hour scours'. The disease was highly infectious with virtually every foal at respective farms being clinically affected within 36 hours of birth. The clinical signs include a pinkish watery diarrhea, relatively non-fetid, usually complicated by dehydration and colic associated with abdominal tympany. Colics were often severe and unresponsive to analgesics. Neostigmine used to relieve tympany was most effective in the resolution of colic. Often treatments were empirical or symptomatic. Routine sanitation procedures, including pressure washings and disinfection, were ineffective. Washings and disinfection of the mares' udders were also ineffective. Foaling in paddocks or pens outside the barn environment resulted in a dramatic cessa-tion of new clinical cases. Viral particles were noted on fecal electron microscopy without a definitive identification of the causative viral etiology.\n\nThe prognosis for foals with viral diarrhea is usually favorable with fluid therapy and supportive care. Secondary complications with bacterial infections or the gastric ulcer syndrome can reduce the number of favorable outcomes. Foals having survived viral diarrhea are usually immune to subsequent infections, although rotavirus is known to recur occasionally, albeit with reduced clinical severity.\n\nSalmonella spp. are the most commonly diagnosed causative agents of bacterial enterocolitis in the adult equine, and has been reported as the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in the foal. In foals less than 14 days of age, Salmonella infections can lead to bacteremia, septicemia, septic shock, and death, with diarrhea occurring secondarily. Other bacteria, including Actinobacillus equuli, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. may also cause diarrhea secondarily to septicemia.\n\nYoung and immunocompromised animals are more susceptible to Salmonella infections, in that exposure to a lower dose of the organism can result in infection. This increased susceptibility of the young may in part be because of a less sophisticated or less well established microflora within the gastrointestinal tract. Experimental data have shown the significance of normal gastrointestinal flora in restricting the ability of the Salmonella organism to establish and proliferate within the intestine.\n\nThe most common source of exposure and infection in the foal is another horse. Often the mare herself is an asymptomatic carrier, shedding the organism during the stress of parturition and exposing the foal to the pathogen in utero or in the post-foaling environment.\n\nSalmonella spp. are gram-negative, facultative, anaerobic bacteria, which usually gain access to the gastrointesti-nal tract via the fecal-oral route. The bacteria must combat a number of non-specific host defense mechanisms -gastric acidity, normal intestinal flora, peristalsis, intestinal mucus, lactoferrin and lysozyme secretions within the gastrointestinal tract -in order to establish infection. Salmonella organisms have many virulent properties enabling them to establish infection within the host. Among these are flagellar and chemotactically directed motility, capsular and surface antigens, macrophage-induced proteins, endotoxin, enterotoxin, cytotoxin, plasmids, and iron-chelating enzymes. Once Salmonella organisms come in close proximity to, or possibly in contact with, the brush border of enterocytes, the microvilli and tight junctions undergo degeneration. Flagellar motility may enable the organism to approach enterocytes close enough for adhesion to occur. Surface 0 antigens and fimbriae may then facilitate adherence of the bacteria to the host receptor cells.\n\nThe bacteria migrate through the enterocyte and access the lamina propria where their presence stimulates an inflammatory response. The macrophages and neutrophils recruited will phagocytize the bacteria, and it is within these phagocytic cells that Salmonella organisms survive and multiply, while remaining protected from antibiotics, antibodies, and complement. Flagella are thought to protect the organism from intracellular killing, while macrophage-induced proteins produced by Salmonella spp. have been shown to block fusion of the phagosome and lysosome, allowing intracellular survival and multiplication.\n\nBoth phagocytized and free Salmonella organisms travel via the lymphatics to regional lymph nodes where they persist in stimulating an inflammatory response. From here the bacteria continue via efferent lymphatics to drain into the blood circulation. Once in the circulation, the bacteria are generally cleared via the reticuloendothelial system, primarily through the liver and the spleen. Septicemia and its sequelae (more common in the neonate than the adult) can occur if the infection is not contained by the mononuclear phagocytic system. Immunity against Salmonella spp. requires both cellmediated and humoral immunity as the bacteria are intracellular pathogens. The neonate's predisposition toward bacteremia and septicemia may be because of factors such as delayed gut closure at birth, immature cellular immune response, and decreased complement activity.\n\nInflammation within the bowel wall results in villus blunting and degeneration and abnormal extrusion of enterocvtes. Cytotoxins may in part be responsible for cellular destruction by inhibiting protein synthesis. The diarrhea in the disease process of Salmonella infections is a result of malabsorption because of this destruction 496 of epithelial cells. Additionally, enterotoxins may induce secretion of fluid from intact intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, and contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of salmonellosis. Endotoxin activates a variety of host cells (platelets, macrophages, endothelial cells, leukocytes) and host tissues to release inflammatory mediators such as arachidonic acid metabolites, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, granulocyte and macrophage stimulating factor, and reactive oxygen radicals. LPS can also stimulate both the intrinsic and extrinsic clotting cascades and activate complement by the classical and alternative pathways. Endotoxemia leads to alterations in hemodynamics, homeostasis, metabolism, and endothelial integrity, resulting in tissue injury, vascular collapse, and multiple-organ system failure (see Chapter 11).\n\nClinical signs of salmonellosis are variable and can range from mild enteritis to fulminating septicemia (Table 27 .1).\n\nManifestations are attributed to enterocolitis, septicemia, and endotoxemia. Early in the course of the disease, fever, decreased nursing, and depression are commonly found. Neonates can present with hypothermia. Foals frequently show signs of moderate to marked abdominal pain and can have associated abdominal distension. Other differential diagnoses must be considered in the neonate as colic symptoms may accompany mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction, for example meconium impaction, intussusception, volvulus, and colon torsion (see Chapter 22). Ileus often occurs, contributing not only to colic and distension, but also to decreased or absent normal progressive motility Pyrexia Depression Decreased nursing Abdominal pain Abdominal distension Ileus Dehydration Congested mucous membranes Prolonged capillary refill time Diarrhea sounds. Fluid and gas sounds are frequently appreciated when auscultating the abdomen. Dehydration, as evidenced by decreased skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, and sunken eyes, can become severe with ongoing fluid losses that may lead to poor tissue perfusion. Endotoxemia contributes to decreased perfusion by stimulation of various inflammatory mediators (thromboxanes, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and catecholamines) which can cause both vasoconstriction and hypotension. Clinically, vasoconstriction is seen early in the course of endotoxemia and is represented by pale mucous membranes, whereas decreased vascular tone appears as muddy, dark-red, congested mucous membranes with a toxic line along the gingiva. Additional findings associated with poor perfusion include tachycardia, elevated pulse rate and intensity, prolonged capillary refill time, cold extremities, and depressed mentation.\n\nClinical signs of bacteremia may manifest as infections evident in other organ systems such as \u2022 pneumonia \u2022 septic arthritis \u2022 uveitis \u2022 osteomyelitis \u2022 skin abscesses \u2022 meningitis \u2022 nephritis.\n\nSevere septicemia can lead to septic shock, multiple organ system failure, and circulatory collapse.\n\nDiarrhea may not be present initially and neonates may die rapidly from severe septic shock before diarrhea develops. Diarrhea associated with acute Salmonella enterocolitis is most often profuse and liquid with little solid material present. Flecks of blood may rarely be present. Foals will defecate in increased frequency and volume. Colic and straining during defecation are common features associated with the high volume of diarrhea produced, while rectal prolapse can occur.\n\nAlthough not diagnostic for the disease, the most consistent hematological abnormalities found with severe Salmonella diarrhea infections are \u2022 leukopenia \u2022 neutropenia with a degenerative left shift \u2022 toxic changes (cytoplasmic vacuolation and toxic granules) seen in granulocytes.\n\nAn inversion of the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio can indicate sepsis. A rebound neutrophilic leukocytosis may occur later in the course of disease, sometimes indicating recovery. Thrombocytopenia can be found in some cases. Fibrinogen can be variable, with low \u00ab 100 mg/dl) values being attributed to coagulopathy and elevated (> 1000 mg/dl) values being attributed to inflammation. Hematocrit is generally markedly increased because of hemoconcentration and splenic contraction. Total plasma protein is initially quite elevated because of hemoconcentration, but will decrease, along with serum albumin levels, with ongoing enteric losses secondary to mucosal damage or generalized endothelial damage. Many neonates will have decreased serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels because of protein catabolism commonly associated with septicemia. Foals that experience a failure of passive transfer (FPT) are predisposed to septicemia, and it can be hard to differentiate if the low IgG led to septicemia or if it was a result of septicemia.\n\nElectrolyte and acid-base imbalances can be profound with Salmonella enterocolitis and commonly include\n\nHypoglycemia in foals may be marked as a consequence of decreased glycogen stores in the liver and bacterial depletion due to sepsis. Azotemia is usually prerenal in origin, but can be caused by acute renal failure or bacterial nephritis in profoundly dehydrated, endotoxemic, or septicemic animals. Hepatic enzymes may be mild to moderately increased as a consequence of absorption of bacterial toxins (endotoxins). Endotoxin-mediated lactic acidosis can result from poor perfusion. Mediators of inflammation stimulated by endotoxemia can lead to a hypercoagulable state followed rarely by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as evidenced by prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, depletion of antithrombin III and increased fibrin degradation products.\n\nDiagnosis of Salmonella spp. as the causative agent of diarrhea is demonstrated by a positive fecal culture, while a positive blood culture is needed to diagnosis Salmonella septicemia. Isolation of the organism from fecal material is variable as Salmonella spp. may be intermittently shed in the feces. With acute enteritis, the feces can have little solid material and the chance of culturing the bacteria is diminished (although better than in adult horses). A minimum of three to five consecutive 1 gram fecal cultures taken 24 hours apart are recommended to increase the chance of isolating the organism. Fecal cultures from the mare should also be submitted to assist in determining the source of infection.\n\nTherapy for salmonellosis is aimed at maintammg hydration and electrolyte balance in the face of ongoing losses, reducing the effects of endotoxemia, preventing or treating bacteremia, and gastroprotectant therapy (Table 27 .2).\n\nAggressive intravenous fluid therapy may be required as dehydration can rapidly become severe in the foal with enterocolitis, and effects of decreased intravascular volume can be profound. Electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities can be marked and serum parameters should be monitored frequently to maintain balance. Isotonic fluids are routinely used to restore and maintain hydration status, with additional electrolytes, for example potassium and bicarbonate, added as indicated by deficits found in serum chemistry analysis. Potassium chloride should not be administered at a rate greater than 0.5 mEq kg-I h-I in the foal. In the severely affected foal with poor perfusion, signs of septic shock or reduced plasma oncotic pressure (hypoproteinemic: <4.0 mg/dl or 40 gil; hypoalbuminemic: < 1.8 mg/dl or 18 gil; and hemoconcentrated with ventral or distal limb edema), colloids such as hydroxyethyl starch, at a dose of 10 ml/kg, can be beneficial. Intravascular volume can be expanded, and vascular perfusion and oncotic pressure improved with a decrease in interstitial fluid accumulation. Colloids are generally followed by continued crystalloid fluid therapy. When used in conjunction with colloids, a decreased amount of crystalloid fluids are required. Plasma is recommended in the hypoproteinemic foal with hypoalbuminemia and/or low IgG levels. In addition, plasma contains coagulation factors and antithrombin III, which could benefit the endotoxemic patient.\n\nHyperimmune plasma containing immunoglobulin-recognizing LPS core antigen has been recommended in horses with Salmonella infections at a dose of 0.4 ml/kg. Fluids containing dextrose (5% solution) or oral supplementation via a nasogastric tube may be required in the foal that has stopped nursing. Alternatively, the catabolic patient may benefit from oral supplementation with high-nitrogen oral solutions (osmolite), partial parental nutrition (PPN) or total parental nutrition (TPN).\n\nAlthough antibiotic therapy will not alter the course of the diarrhea or reduce the incidence of shedding of the Salmonella organism, it is recommended that foals with Salmonella infections be treated with antibiotics in the hope of preventing bacteremia and to treat any sites of secondary infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be established based on sensitivity results of fecal or blood cultures. Ideally lipid-soluble antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfonamides and chloramphenicol, should be used as the Salmonella organism survives intracellularly. Often the Salmonella spp. isolated, especially in nosocomial infections, will be resistant to the aforementioned antibiotics, and other broad-spectrum choices such as third generation cephalosporins or penicillin and aminoglycoside combinations are found to be more effective. Antibiotics may contribute to the release of endotoxins in cases of rapid bacterial death. For this reason patients can be treated with medications that decrease the effects of circulating endotoxin prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Polymyxin B, at a low dose of 6000 IU /kg, binds and removes endotoxin from circulation. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg i.v, t.i.d.) will both ameliorate the effects of endotoxemia by decreasing synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and decrease the secretory component of diarrhea by blocking prostaglandin-mediated hypersecretion of enterocytes. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously in foals because of the greater risk of gastroduodenal ulcers. Pentoxifylline (7.5 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) has been shown to reduce endotoxin-induced synthesis of tumor necrosis factor, a contributor to endotoxemia associated with sepsis. In addition, pentoxifylline increases red blood cell deformability, decreases blood viscosity, decreases platelet aggregation, and decreases thrombus formation, thereby combating conditions contributing to impairment of regional blood flow.\n\nBismuth subsalicylate is commonly used as an intestinal protectant. The bismuth is thought to have antiendotoxic and weak antibacterial properties while the salicylate has antiprostaglandin activity which may decrease enterocyte hypersecretion. Activated charcoal and/or mineral oil can be used to decrease absorption of endotoxin. Yogurt or other lactobacillus-containing products can be used to help reintroduce beneficial flora to the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nAnti-ulcer medication is routinely recommended and administered prophylactically and therapeutically to ill foals because of their predisposition to gastric ulcer syndrome. Omeprazole (a gastric acid (proton) pump inhibitor), or famotidine, ranitidine, cimetidine (H~antagonists), and sucralfate (a cytoprotective agent) are commonly used medications. It is interesting to recall that one important host barrier to Salmonella infections is the ability of acidic pH in the stomach to prevent live bacteria from gaining access to the intestine. Changing gastric pH with anti-ulcer medication may in fact enhance infection.\n\nThe Salmonella organism is relatively prevalent within the environment and can be shed in the feces of clinically normal horses. The most common route of infection is fecal-oral. The mare is often found to be shedding the organism and the foal has probably contracted it from her. Neonates are at greater risk during the first 24 hours of life as the organism may gain access via the gastrointestinal tract prior to gut closure. Overcrowding, improper sanitation, and inadequate umbilical care all put the neonate at risk for Salmonella bacteremia and consequent septicemia.\n\nAdequate colostral antibody absorption is important to develop the foal's immune defense system. A serum IgG concentration of more than 800 mg/dl at 24 hours of age is recognized as optimal passive conference of immunity in the neonatal foal. This immunity is especially important in the neonate at risk for sepsis. Plasma transfusions with hyperimmune plasma from donors vaccinated against mutant strains of]-5 Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium have been reported to provide IgG protection against gram-negative core antigens, but clinical response to this therapy is variable. In addition, plasma provides opsonins which improve the foal's immune function. Sick neonates can experience increased immunoglobulin consumption, possibly because of sequestering of IgG within the intravascular space or at sites of inflammation, and can benefit from plasma transfusions even if initial colostral absorption is adequate. Autogenous vaccines have been used to stimulate immunity against Salmonella spp., but approved and proper preparation is difficult.\n\nAnimals identified as infected with Salmonella spp. should be kept isolated from the general population until they culture negative. Both mares and foals should be cultured. Infected animals can continue to shed organisms in their feces intermittently for several days to weeks. Daily fecal cultures should be taken beginning at 4 weeks after the cessation of clinical signs, and three to five negative cultures are needed before putting the animal in contact with other foals can be considered.\n\nClostridial diarrhea has been diagnosed in foals at an increasing rate over the past 5 years. It is unclear if this is a result of increased prevalence of the disease or increased use of more sensitive diagnostic tests for intestinal clostridial toxins.\n\nClostridium perfringens type C is a well-proven cause of colic and diarrhea (often hemorrhagic) in young foals. The disease almost always occurs in foals less than 5 days of age that have received sufficient colostrum. Pancreatic trypsin is inhibited by a trypsin inhibitor in colostrum, which undoubtedly plays a role in the potential for C. perfringens colonization and increased toxin concentration in the foal's small intestine during the first week of life. C. perfringens type C produces a beta toxin which causes severe intestinal necrosis and hemorrhagic diarrhea. As the intestinal wall becomes damaged the organism can be found in the blood of many affected cases. In later stages of the disease the organism can be found in the peritoneal fluid. C. perfringens type C diarrhea can be either a farm problem or it can present as an isolated case. Foals, such as orphan foals, that may be given both colostrum and milk in unusually large amounts via a nasogastric tube may be at increased risk. Although unconfirmed, exposure to the organism may be via the mare rather than environmental contamination.\n\nClostridium peifringens type A has been incriminated as a cause of diarrhea in foals of all ages. Proof of the relationship between C. perfringens type A in the foal's stool, and diarrhea in foals has been difficult. As in adult horses, C. peifringens type A organisms are more common in foals with diarrhea than in healthy foals, but no toxin marker has been found in the foal that distinguishes a pathogenic strain of C. perfringens type A from non-pathogenic strains. C. perfringens type A enterotoxin and/or its enterotoxin gene can be found in both normal and diseased foals. C. perfringens type A may cause diarrhea in foals, but more research is needed to prove cause and effect. A similar situation exists with C. diJjicile and its relationship to foal diarrhea. C. diJjicile has been reported, and has frequently been incriminated as causing outbreaks of diarrhea in young foals (generally < 3 weeks of age). In these outbreaks there has been no history of prior antibiotic treatment to predispose the animals to the proposed C. diJjicile diarrhea. Proving cause and effect has been difficult since normal foals may have both C. diJjicile and its toxin in their stool. This situation is also well-known in children. It may be that C. diJjicile is a primary pathogen in some cases of foal diarrhea, or it may be present in the stool in greater numbers because of the diarrhea, or it may be acting with another pathogen to cause diarrhea. Other pathogens that may be present simultaneously include Cryptosporidium spp., Bacteroides fragilis, rotavirus type A, or a virus similar to rotavirus but smaller than type A.\n\nColic often precedes the diarrhea by a few hours and can be severe. Mild to moderate abdominal distension generally precede the diarrhea. There may be some reflux after passage of a soft nasogastric tube, but more commonly reflux is absent or minimal. Fever is often present. Clostridium perfringens type C generally causes a hemorrhagic enteritis with blood-stained diarrhea (Plate 27.1). Diarrhea associated with C. diJjicile or C. perfringens type A is more commonly brown and fetid.\n\nThe diagnosis of clostridial enteritis, or any enteritis in foals, should be based on signalment and historical information, for example age of the foal, clinical findings, fever, leukopenia, low serum sodium and chloride, liquid gut sounds on auscultation, in addition to fecal cultures and toxin assays. Radiographic examination, performed using 85 kVp and 20 rnA with rare earth 500 screen cassettes, is useful in distinguishing enterius from surgical conditions, for example intussusception, in the colicky foal. Small intestinal obstructive lesions have a few distinct inverted U-shaped loops of bowel and there is less intestinal gas distension than with enteritis. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen using a 5-mHz probe is most helpful in differentiating between surgical disorders and enteritis as causes of abdominal pain. The small intestine of foals with enteritis is generally more hypoechoic than normal (Figure 27 .1) and the motility may be increased. With strangulating diseases of the small intestine, motility of the distended intestine is usually absent. The ultrasound examination should be performed with the foal standing if possible.\n\nFecal cultures should be submitted for Clostridium spp. culture (anaerobic media) and toxin assay (c. difficile toxin A and B, and C. peifringens alpha and enterotoxin). For toxin assays, the sample should ideally be delivered immediately to the laboratory or the feces frozen and sent by overnight mail. An estimate of the number of C. peifringens organisms in the feces may be helpful in determining significance, but quantitative cultures require that a fresh sample (ideally taken from the rectum) be kept under anaerobic conditions and delivered immediately to the laboratory. Large numbers of C. perfringens (> 10 3 colony-forming units/ml of feces) would be supportive of the diagnosis. A gram stain of the feces is helpful in the diagnosis if there are Spores are more commonly seen with C. difficile and the organism can often be more curved in appearance and have a darker gram-positive stain than C. perfringens. Genotyping would be needed to determine C. perfringens type (A-E). Blood cultures should be performed on young foals \u00ab I week of age) with diarrhea as C. perfringens type C can often be found in the blood or peritoneal fluid in the later stages of the disease.\n\nTreatments that can be helpful for clostridial diarrhea are shown in Table 27 .3.\n\nSigns of abdominal pain should be controlled to minimize injury to the foal. Dipyrone (22-33 mg/kg i.v.) or butorphanol (4-6 mg/kg i.m.) can be used initially. Low doses of flunixin meglumine can be used sparingly. Foals with colic, ileus, and severe or progressive 'gaseous' abdominal distension that have been unresponsive to appropriate medical treatment and are believed not to have an obstructive disorder, can be given neostigmine (0.2-0.4 mg/foal s.c.) after sedation with xylazine in an attempt to evacuate the gas.\n\nLactated Ringer's solution should be given to reduce fluid deficits. Potassium chloride (20 mEq/l) should be added if the foal is hypokalemic, or if sodium bicarbonate and dextrose have been administered, and if the foal has been seen to urinate. Additional potassium is generally needed in foals having diarrhea for more than 2 days or in foals receiving large volumes of intravenous fluids. If the foal appears weak add 10 g dextrose/l unless the blood glucose concentration is normal. If the Two liters of plasma should be given intravenously (preferably the plasma should have antibodies against endotoxin, although the LPS antibodies may not be as important as some naturally occurring factors in plasma, e.g. anti-thrombin III). Clostridium perfringens type C and D antiserum can be given orally to affected foals. If the foal is in hypotensive shock and the plasma and polyionic fluids do not improve the condition (as determined by monitoring the blood pressure or by clinical impressions, e.g. poor capillary refill, severe and persistent tachycardia, and cold extremities), dobutamine (5-10 I-lg kg-J min-I) should be administered via a slow intravenous drip.\n\nAntimicrobial therapy should include intravenous penicillin, 44000 IV/kg i.v, q. 6 h, and amikacin, 18 mg/kg q. 24 h, (carefully monitor urine production, serum creatinine, and amikacin trough levels). Metronidazole, 10 mg/kg p.o. q. 12 h, may also be administered. Broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated as bacterial translocation to other organs can occur.\n\nRanitidine 1.5-2.2 mg/kg i.v, q. 8 h or famotidine 0.7-1.4 mg/kg i.v. once daily should be used in the hope of preventing gastric ulcers. Once the colic subsides, these or other H 2-blockers or proton pump blockers can be given per os.\n\nPepto bismol (56-112 g (2-4 oz) p.o. q. 4-6 h) with 28-56 g (1-20z) yogurt may be of some benefit in reducing toxin absorption and re-establishing normal intestinal flora. The foal can be allowed to nurse but should not be force-fed milk.\n\nThe prognosis with Clostridium perfringens type C is variable, intestinal necrosis rapidly occurs in a few cases with large numbers of the organism being identified in both blood and peritoneal fluid. Less severely affected cases respond dramatically to treatment and may appear normal within 2-3 days. C. difficileand C. perfringens type A-associated disease seems to produce a more protracted diarrhea. The prognosis for either infection is generally good if the foal is nursing at recognition of the disease, or if nursing is strong after 24 hours of treatment. Gastric ulceration, electrolyte imbalances, and cachexia may be significant problems in a few foals.\n\nClostridium perfringens type C diarrhea is often an isolated event on a farm requiring few control measures.\n\nCleaning the mare's udder prior to the foal nursing may be the most appropriate control measure and should be routinely recommended. C. perfringens type C toxoids are available but would not routinely be recommended for the pregnant mare unless the farm has a proven problem with C. perfringens type C. A more significant problem exists with farm outbreaks of foal diarrhea presumed to be associated with either C. difficile or C. perfringens type A. It may help to ensure cleanliness of the mare at parturition, disinfect the foaling area, and avoid using a common foaling stall. Prophylactic use of metronidazole, 10 mg/kg q. 12 or 24 h, from day 1 (do not administer prior to colostrum) to day 5 appears to be helpful in stopping outbreaks on some farms. Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotics may be administered for either prophylaxis or treatment but their efficacy is not proven. Hospitalized foals, either with or without diarrhea may be shedding C. difficile in the greatest numbers. Their stalls should be disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant (hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, or phenolics), and all personnel entering and leaving the stall should wash hands and wear protective clothing and boots.\n\nRhodococcus equiis a gram-positive, facultative intracellular aerobe, it is known primarily as a pathogen of the respiratory tract of the juvenile horse. The organism is a saprophytic inhabitant of the soil, favoring soils in warm climates where the manure of herbivores is present. Such soils promote survival and amplification of R. equi populations because molecules produced by fermentative digestion in the equine hindgut are growth factors for the organism. The typical manifestation of disease caused by this bacterium is an abscessing, pyogenic, granulomatous bronchopneumonia in foals aged 1-6 months, but many extrapulmonary manifestations of infection, including colitis and abdominallymphadenitis, have been described.\n\nOriginally classed taxonomically in the genus Corynebacterium, the organism was reclassified as Rhodococcus spp. on the basis of genetics, chemistry, and ecology. Members of this genus are soil inhabitants, having in common the production of red pigment, but only R. equihas been reported as a pathogen in animals 502 or humans. The organism IS III the same taxonomic order (Actinomycetales) as mycobacteria. Mycobacteria, like R. equi, are primarily pathogens of the respiratory and intestinal tracts, causing pulmonary and intestinal tuberculosis in humans (M. avium, M. boois, and M. tuberculosis) andJohne's disease, a chronic, granulomatous inflammation of the intestinal tract of ungulates (M. paratuberculosis). The tuberculous, pyogenic granulomas of mycobacteria infections are histologically similar to rhodococcal abscesses in their composition of infected macrophages and multinucleate giant cells with neutrophilic infiltration.\n\nBecause the bacterium resides endemically in types of soils which support populations of horses, it is an agent to which most, if not all, horses are exposed. The incidence of disease associated with Rhodococcus equi, however, varies. On some farms R. equi pneumonia is rare, while on others clinical disease occurs enzootically, even though the organism can be cultured from the soil of both. This incongruity is likely to be a result of differences in the type of soil, climate, prevalence of dusty conditions, stocking rate, and intensity of management that exist between farms, as well as differences in virulence among resident strains of the organism. Virulent strains of R. equi are characterized by the presence of a 15 or 17.5 kDa virulence-associated protein (VapA) on the cell membrane. Farms which have clinical disease due to R. equi are usually endemic premises for VapA strains of the organism, while farms having little incidence of disease are infected less heavily with the virulent organism. This protein is encoded for by an 85 or 90-kilobase plasmid. Though long recognized as an identifying marker for virulent strains, it has recently been shown conclusively that this plasmid is in fact a virulence factor for the organism. The presence of the plasmid is essential for intracellular replication within macrophages and subsequent development of disease. The organism dwells and replicates within phagosomes after being phagocytized by macrophages, preventing (by an unknown mechanism) the usual fusion of the phagosome with a lysosome. Macrophages thus infected do not undergo the respiratory burst associated with the lysosomal enzymatic activation which mediates intracellular killing. Infection of macrophage cells by R. equi eventually causes the degeneration and death of the immune cell, possibly by inappropriate lysosomal rupture and degranulation into the cytoplasm. Neutrophil cells of both foals and adult horses function as effective phagocytes, and can effectively process and destroy R. equi.\n\nInoculation of foals occurs via either the respiratory route, following inhalation of aerosolized particles, or the oral route, via ingestion. In dusty conditions, bacteria present in the soil and feces become aerosolized, serving as the direct source of exposure and pulmonary infection for foals. Colonization of the bowel by Rhodococcus. equi occurs when foals ingest infected soil or forage, are coprophagous, or swallow expectorated, bacteria-laden sputum. R. equi pneumonia is also prevalent in areas with grass pasture and little or no dust or exposed soil. In these circumstances, feces from adult horses serving as passive carriers may be an important source of exposure for foals. In adult horses, ingestion results in passive passage of the organism through the intestinal tract, with resultant deposition of the bacterium back into the environment. In immunologically naive foals, however, the organism thrives and replicates, resulting in significant amplification of bacterial numbers in the environment and enhanced risk to other young stock if manure produced by infected foals is not promptly removed. During the optimal environmental conditions that prevail during summer months, R. equi numbers in contaminated soil can multiply by ten-thousand-fold in 2 weeks, such that 1 gram of soil could theoretically contain millions of virulent organisms.\n\nThe clinical picture of pulmonary disease mediated by Rhodococcus equi has been well described. Young foals aged 1-6 months are typically affected. Foals in this age category are particularly susceptible to infection because they are in an immunologic stage of waning maternal antibody. Most foals reach this age with its characteristic antibody 'trough' when warmer temperatures and dusty conditions are beginning to prevail, increasing the aerosolization of bacteria. Foals often present with an apparently acute onset of clinical disease characterized by \u2022 fever \u2022 tachypnea \u2022 depression.\n\nHowever the actual onset and early development of lesions in lung tissue is insidious and clinically silent. The disease process and degree of pulmonary involvement are typically well advanced by the time clinical signs are evident and a diagnosis is made. The incubation period may vary. In one study virulent organisms sprayed into the trachea of healthy foals resulted in the development of fever in 11-16 days. Evaluation of the thorax with radiography or ultrasound usually demonstrates the presence of cavitary lesions representing a multifocal, abscessing pattern of bronchopneumonia. The perihilar regions, and the cranial and cranioventral areas of the lungs tend to be most severely affected, and the hilar lymph nodes are often involved. In some cases a more atypical interstitial pneumonia may occur.\n\nIn addition to pulmonary disease, extrapulmonary manifestations of infection may be observed, including \u2022 mesenteric lymphadenitis \u2022 ulcerative colitis \u2022 immune-mediated polysynovitis \u2022 uveitis and keratoconjunctivitis \u2022 osteomyelitis \u2022 septic synovitis \u2022 cutaneous pyogranulomas.\n\nOf these extrapulmonary lesions, enteric disease (ulcerative colitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis) is the most common. Ulcerative colitis and/or mesenteric lymphadenitis were present concurrently with pneumonia in 50 per cent of foals with Rhodococcus equi infection in one survey. Any of the extrapulmonary manifestations of disease may precede signs of pneumonia, but once such clinical signs are observed, further evaluation will usually document the presence of underlying and concurrent pulmonary disease.\n\nIntestinal colonization by Rhodococcus equi may include several manifestations. Enterocolitis in the form of diffuse infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosa by infected macrophages and multinucleate giant cells occurs. Affected segments have grossly thickened, corrugated mucosa with multiple, irregularly shaped, well-demarcated foci of necrosis and crateriform ulcers, from 0.5-4 em in diameter. Histologically, the granulomatous infiltrate can be seen to fill the lamina propria, distort villi, and displace intestinal glands and crypts. These areas of granulomatous infiltrate are associated with those areas of the lamina propria and submucosa that are associated with lymphoid follicles. Cecal, colonic, and mesenteric lymph nodes may also become enlarged and firm. Foals with enteric infections commonly demonstrate the following clinical signs \u2022 diarrhea \u2022 fever \u2022 variable weight loss.\n\nIn some cases cellular obstruction of the lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels leads to ascites; affected foals will show chronic weight loss and appear unthrifty and potbellied in addition to producing diarrhea. Although R. equi can be cultured from the stool of many foals or horses, documentation of increasing R. equi numbers in the feces, over the normal background numbers present, may be helpful in identifying clinically affected foals.\n\nRhodococcus equi utilizes the specialized microfold cells in the intestinal wall as a route of entry to macrophages in Peyer's patches and discrete lymphoid follicles diffusely distributed along the intestinal tract. These microfold cells, or M-eells, are interspersed among the villous enterocytes, and function as antigen-presenting cells, delivering lumenal antigen to immune cells in the submucosa and lamina propria for processing. Once the bacteria are ensconced within the phagosomes, they travel with the macrophage and may subsequently access lymph nodes in the mesentery of the small intestine, cecum, and large colon, causing enlargement and abscessation of these nodes. They may also enter the lacteal and lymph vessels, eventually gaining access to the circulation via the thoracic duct. The bacteria can then become hematogenously distributed, resulting in abscessation at random sites. Such abscesses often develop in the peritoneal cavity, but in horses and in other species, including humans, R. equi abscesses have been reported in a variety of locations. In humans, the organism has caused disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, though it occurs more commonly in patients with dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity such as HIV patients and transplant recipients. Respiratory tract disease, including chronic, granulomatous pneumonia and extrapulmonary infections such as mediastinitis, is the most common disease manifestation in humans, but thyroid abscesses, post-injection gluteal abscesses, renal abscesses, and a variety of other affected body sites have all been reported. Only about 30 per cent of humans with R. equi infections report any contact with herbivores or soil where herbivores have been.\n\nDiarrhea is the primary presenting sign in foals with abdominal lymphadenitis or colitis. Diarrhea may also develop as a complication of antimicrobial treatment with erythromycin and rifampin. The erythromycin/ rifampin combination is the anti-rhodococcal treatment regimen of choice, because of \u2022 the drugs' lipophilic properties, permitting good penetration across abscess walls and into the intracellular space of macrophages \u2022 the synergistic action of the two agents combined.\n\nDisruption of colon microflora is thought to cause the diarrhea in affected foals, necessitating (in some cases) adjustment of erythromycin doses to a lower rate in the recommended dose range or temporary dis-504 continuation of the drugs for 24-48 hours. In some cases the diarrhea will be self-limiting and will not necessitate any alteration in dosing. Occasionally treatment with different antimicrobial drugs is necessary. Hyperthermia is another complication occasionally encountered in foals being administered erythromycin. The problem occurs most frequently in very hot weather when the thermoregulatory mechanisms are already challenged to a maximum in a pneumonic foal.\n\nSuccessful management of farms with an enzootic Rhodococcus equipresence must address the issues of prophylactic measures for the disease, early identification of affected foals, and effective therapy of ill foals. Immune prophylaxis is an active area of research, and much remains to be elucidated and understood. For instance, administration of hyperimmune serum to young foals has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia on enzootic premises but is not effective at treating established disease. Vaccination of mares and their foals with a preparation of VapA protein extract was not protective for clinical disease and may have enhanced the likelihood of R. equi pneumonia in the foals. Preventative measures that are known to be effective, however, include \u2022 prompt removal and composting of manure from infected foals \u2022 rotating pastures to decrease erosion of pasture into dusty paddocks \u2022 segregation of ill foals from the general population.\n\nThese measures effectively reduce the numbers of the infective organism in the environment, reducing the immune challenge to the at-risk population of foals in their immunologically vulnerable phase.\n\nDiarrhea is a common and often serious disease of foals. Protozoal diarrhea in foals caused by the coccidian parasite Cryptosporidium parvum is being increasingly recognized. The purpose of this chapter is to review the epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of C. parvum infection in horses.\n\nInfection of foals occurs by ingestion of the infective, sporulated oocysts. These excyst in the small intestine and attach to the epithelium in a location described as intracellular but extracytoplasmic. Amplification occurs both through asexual and sexual multiplication. Oocysts are formed that are capable of autoinfection prior to excretion (thin-walled oocysts) or that are immediately infectious when shed in feces (thickwalled oocysts). Transmission occurs either via the fecal-oral route or by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Sources of infection for horses are unknown but, as for people, contaminated municipal water may be important. Conflicting evidence exists as to whether mares are the source of infection for foals, however, in the author's experience mares are not the source of infection for foals. In Texas cattle do not appear to be an important source of infection for horses.\n\nPrevalence varies with the method of detection used and the population studied. Infection among clinically normal, mature horses is rare (approximately 0-5%). Prevalence at breeding farms may be higher, particularly among foals. Prevalence is higher among foals with diarrhea than among clinically normal foals, and prevalence may approach 100 per cent among diarrheic foals at farms during an outbreak.\n\nFoals are at increased risk of infection, particularly those from 1-4 weeks of age, however diarrhea associated with Cryptosporidium parvum may be seen in foals younger or older than this.\n\nThe time from infection to shedding oocysts for cryptosporidial diarrhea in foals is unknown. Most foals shedding cryptosporidial oocysts have been older than 5 days of age. Although cryptosporidial diarrhea has been described in foals with diarrhea observed at 2 days of age, cryptosporidial infection should be ranked lower in the differential diagnosis for diarrhea of a 2day-old foal than in that of a foal aged 5-10 days. Cryptosporidial infection and diarrhea are rare in mature horses. Evidence of predisposition by sex or breed does not exist, although most epidemiological studies of equine cryptosporidiosis have been conducted in groups of mares and foals.\n\n1mmunocompromised foals, such as those with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, are at increased risk. However, immunocompetent foals can also develop cryptosporidial diarrhea. Although the disease will generally be more severe among immunocompromised foals, severe or fatal diarrhea can occur in immunocompetent foals.\n\nSome farms experience epidemics of cryptosporidial diarrhea. Recurrence during ensuing years is rare. A high density of foals, a municipal water source, foaling in stalls (versus pasture), and poor hygiene may be risk factors for infection and disease.\n\nClinical signs in foals vary with age and immune status and are usually limited to the gastrointestinal tract and related organs. Diarrhea associated with cryptosporidial infection is more prevalent during the first 3-4 weeks of life, but older foals, weanlings, and yearlings can be affected. Among immunocompromised foals with combined immunodeficiency, signs are often severe and can progress rapidly. In these foals sites other than the small intestine may be infected including the stomach, common bile duct, colon, and major pancreatic ducts. Among immunocompetent foals, clinical signs associated with cryptosporidial infection will vary from absent to fatal diarrhea. Inapparently infected foals may represent a source of infection for other foals. The severity of signs may be related to agent factors (inoculum size, virulence), host factors (age, immunocompetence), and environmental factors (water source, housing practices). In older foals (i.e. 3-6 months) the diarrhea may be more chronic and can persist until foals are 9-12 months of age. In all infected foals concurrent infection with other putative enteropathogens (Salmonella spp., rotavirus, coronavirus, adenovirus) may be observed.\n\nAnte-mortem diagnosis of cryptosporidial infection is generally based on detection of oocysts in the feces. Fecal samples should be submitted as fresh material or in recommended preservative (10% formalin or sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin). Oocysts can be detected using either concentration or staining techniques. Concentration of oocysts may be accomplished by flotation or sedimentation. Regardless of technique, distinguishing oocysts from yeast is an important diagnostic issue.\n\nIn veterinary diagnostic laboratories, three techniques are commonly used \u2022 flotation of oocysts \u2022 acid-fast staining of oocysts \u2022 detection of oocysts using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA).\n\nSedimentation techniques are rarely used in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Of the flotation techniques used, flotation in Sheather's sugar solution is most common. Prompt processing is important because oocysts collapse and lose their spherical shape when left in Sheather's sugar solution.\n\nAcid-fast staining of fecal specimens is widely used for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum. The technique is simple and staining kits are commercially available. The organisms appear as red spheres (4-6 mm in diameter) against a dark, counter-stained background, while yeast generally do not appear red (Plate 27.2). The technique has relatively poor specificity making it a poor choice for a screening test. However, it is useful clinically as a diagnostic test because of its good sensitivity, availability, and low cost.\n\nThe IFA test has relatively low sensitivity but excellent specificity. A commercial immunofluorescence assay is available (Meridian Diagnostics Inc., Cincinnati, OH) that simultaneously detects cryptosporidial and giardial organisms. The high cost relative to staining techniques and specialized microscopic equipment needed are limitations of the IFA. To date, reliable enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have not been developed and validated for detecting Cryptosporidium parvum in samples from horses. Flow cytometric methods are more sensitive than IFA or acid-fast staining, but are not widely available.\n\nThe pattern of oocyst shedding by foals is variable in duration (from days to many weeks) and can be intermittent. Shedding may be antecedent, concurrent, or subsequent to the onset of diarrhea. Because of the variable duration and the intermittent pattern of shedding, multiple samples (at least three) should be submitted for detecting Cryptosporidium parvum in feces from foals. It may be easier to detect oocysts in unformed feces than in formed feces.\n\nAlthough over 120 different treatments have been tested in a variety of animals, to date no specific chemotherapy or immunotherapy has been proven to be convincingly effective for treating Cryptosporidium parvum in people and other mammals, and none has been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial among foals. Those treatments that may have greatest potential for use in foals include paromomycin and bovine colostrum.\n\nParomomycin is an expensive aminoglycoside antibiotic that is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Paromomycin reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea and eliminated oocyst shedding in neonatal calves experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. Paromomycin was effective in treating a cat with cryptosporidiosis. Doses used in calves have ranged from 50-100 mg/kg administered orally once or twice daily. No data exist for the use of this drug in foals. Adverse effects of paromomycin in humans include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps. As for all other agents used to treat cryptosporidial infection, experimental and clinical evidence also exists indicating a lack of effectiveness of paromomycin. No antibiotic approved for use in horses has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of cryptosporidial diarrhea.\n\nHyperimmune bovine colostrum has been used with varying success as a means of prophylaxis and therapy of cryptosporidiosis in animals and patients with AIDS. A factor limiting the use of hyperimmune bovine colostrum is its availability. Pooled bovine colostrum, however, is more readily available. Pooled bovine colostrum from non-immunized animals also may be protective in controlling cryptosporidiosis; nonimmunoglobulin factors in the colostrum may provide protection. Use of hyperimmune or pooled bovine colostrum has not been uniformly successful. The benefits of administration of colostrum or hyperimmune colostrum to foals, regardless of their age, with cryptosporidiosis is unknown.\n\nTreatment of foals with severe combined immunodeficiency is likely to be unsuccessful. In immunocompetent foals, infection is often subclinical or mild and self-limiting; in these foals no treatment or supportive care is needed. In more severely affected foals further treatment may be necessary.\n\nThe prevention and control of cryptosporidiosis can be difficult. Currently, immunization effective at preventing cryptosporidiosis in horses and foals is lacking. Although some chemotherapeutic agents have shown preventive potential, the cost-effectiveness of such prophylaxis is often a limiting factor. Oocysts shed in feces are infective, extremely resistant to environmental factors, and can survive for months if not exposed to extremes of temperature or desiccation. Oocysts can be killed by steam, 10% formalin, 5% ammonia, and undiluted commercial bleach, although prolonged exposure is necessary which can be difficult to achieve. Good sanitation may help by decreasing the oocyst burden in the foals' environment. Specific sanitation strategies would include providing uncontaminated water, rigorous cleaning (preferably with steam) and disinfecting foaling stalls, removing all the bedding, and isolating diarrheic foals.\n\nIngestion of oocysts in people can cause gastrointestinal disease in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people. People working with animals, including farmers and veterinarians, are considered to be at increased risk. Cryptosporidiosis has occurred in veterinary students exposed to infected calves and foals. Efforts to minimize transmission in persons handling infected foals should include instruction regarding, and rigorous attention to, hygiene, protective clothing (possibly to include face mask, gloves, gown or coveralls, and boots), and efforts to disinfect contaminated areas. Persons with primary or acquired immunodeficiency should not be exposed to foals with diarrhea in which a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is possible. Because of the low prevalence of infection, mature horses do not appear to be an important source of environmental contamination.\n\nAntibiotic-induced diarrhea occurs because of the inhibition of the normal anaerobic bacterial flora and the secondary proliferation of pathological bacteria. In adult horses antibiotic-induced colitis is generally severe and can rapidly be fatal. In foals antibioticinduced diarrhea is generally mild and will often resolve quickly once the antibiotics are discontinued. Diarrhea can be induced by a number of antibiotics. Some antibiotics will cause a problem only in certain regions and this is probably a reflection of differences in the normal intestinal bacterial flora. In foals the antibiotic most commonly associated with diarrhea is erythromycin. Erythromycin is widely used in combina-tion with rifampin for the treatment of Rhodococcus equi infections. Diarrhea that develops in a foal on erythromycin will generally resolve 48 hours after the antibiotic is discontinued. Often the foal needs to continue receiving antibiotics for the R equi infection. Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and rifampin can be used when problems of either hyperthermia or diarrhea have developed secondary to the use of erythromycin. R equi infections have resolved in response to this antibiotic combination.\n\nDiarrhea is a common clinical sign in the septicemic foal. Septicemia usually develops in the first 7 days of life. Foals may be normal at birth, become infected and then deteriorate, or be born septicemic with weakness and inability to stand and nurse. The common clinical signs in the septicemic foal initially are lethargy, depression, and failure to nurse, followed by diarrhea. The common bacteria implicated in neonatal septicemia are Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus spp. The basis for treatment of these foals is antibiotics to kill the infectious agent with supporting medical therapy and nursing care for the neonate.\n\nAnother foal diarrhea syndrome which has not been widely reported has been termed 'fetal diarrhea'. The newborn foal with fetal diarrhea will be born covered in liquid yellow-brown feces. These foals are infected in utero, and there may be an accompanying placentitis. The amniotic fluid is contaminated with feces and the foal is subject to aspiration pneumonia. These foals are generally septicemic and may appear healthy and robust at birth but will often be unable to stand and will then rapidly deteriorate. Other foals born with fetal diarrhea will progress normally and it is assumed these foals develop diarrhea shortly prior to birth and have limited exposure to the severely contaminated environment. All foals born with evidence of fetal diarrhea should be treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and closely monitored for signs of deterioration.\n\nNutritional causes of diarrhea in foals have been associated with overfeeding, use of milk replacers, and a rapid change in diet from mare's milk to milk replacers (e.g. orphaned foals). In foals deprived of mares colostrum and milk for 48 hours because of the possibility of neonatal isoerythrolysis, and supplemented with milk replacer, it is common for a self-limiting diarrhea to develop. Foals with these forms of diarrhea remain clinically normal.\n\nLactase deficiency and lactose intolerance have both been reported in foals. These are both are unusual causes of diarrhea. Lactase deficiency can be evaluated by use of an oral lactose tolerance test.\n\nIngestion of sand and dirt by foals can also cause diarrhea secondary to local irritation of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis can be made by examining the feces for sand or in severe cases using abdominal radiography. Treatment with orally administered methyl cellulose may be effective in removing the sand and dirt.\n\n_ _~_~_J&ilI!i~I%ilI**WA\"'~\u00bblIi!lfW\"_;{'\"\",;~~%\"\"%1:_'lli Foals infected in utero with equine herpesvirus may develop diarrhea although it is not the predominant clinical sign in these foals. Often the infected foal will appear normal at birth but will fail to stand and nurse and then progressively deteriorate, developing severe respiratory distress terminally. These foals are treated and supported as septicemic foals, although treatment is generally unsuccessful. A definitive diagnosis is made on histopathological changes in the lung, liver, and the Iymphoreticular tissues at necropsy.\n\nCandida albicans is a commensal organism of the mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract. Superficial infections have been reported in foals. Systemic candidiasis is rare and generally occurs in foals treated with prolonged broad spectrum antibiotics for septicemia. Immunocompromised foals are also predisposed to candidiasis.\n\nDiarrhea has been reported in foals with systemic candidiasis, but this is considered an unusual cause. As these foals are often immunocompromised or have been treated long term with antibiotics, the diarrhea may not be directly due to the Candida infection.\n\nStrongyloides toesteri is a questionable cause of diarrhea in young foals. Transmission occurs by ingestion of infective larvae from the mare's milk or via skin penetration. The pre-patent period is 8-14 days. Attempts to estab-508 lish a clear association between infective larvae and the induction of diarrhea have been unsuccessful. Treatment of mares on the day of parturition with ivermectin was unsuccessful in blocking vertical transmission. Treating foals with ivermectin or oxibendazole is effective.\n\nEquine strongylosis occurs secondary to mixed infections with large strongyles and cyathostomes (small strongyles). These mixed infections cause gastrointestinal tract irritation and clinical signs of intermittent soft feces, but can also cause persistent diarrhea in foals. The severity of the clinical signs is related to the parasite load. Foals grazing pasture containing high levels of strongyle eggs, or immunologically naive foals with a good worming history that are subsequently exposed to strongyle infections are at risk of developing clinical signs of strongyle parasitism. These clinical signs include lethargy, depression, decreased weight gain, a rough hair coat, and diarrhea. Treatment with ivermectin is effective in controlling these mixed infections.\n\nProliferative enteropathy is a transmissible enteric disease affecting a number of mammalian species, notably pigs. It has a worldwide distribution and its causal agent has been recently identified and classified as Lawsonia intracellularis, an obligate intracellular bacterium.\n\nThe disease has been described sporadically in horses, either as isolated cases or as outbreaks in breeding farms. Foals 4-7 months of age appear most susceptible to the disease. Common clinical signs include depression, rapid and severe weight loss, subcutaneous edema, diarrhea, and colic. Extremely poor body condition with a rough hair-coat and a pot-bellied appearance are common findings in affected foals. The disease may lead to death within a few days or cause chronic growth retardation. Concomitant respiratory tract infection and intestinal parasitism are also found in some foals.\n\nHypoproteinemia is the most consistent laboratory finding. Other commonly observed abnormalities include transient leukocytosis, anemia, increased creatine kinase, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia.\n\nThe clinical signs presented by foals with proliferative enteropathy resemble those associated with common gastrointestinal diseases caused by parasites, infections caused by Salmonella spp., Clostridium spp., and Rhodococcus equi, or sand impactions. However, these conditions are unlikely to cause outbreaks of disease characterized by weight loss, diarrhea, colic, and severe hypoproteinemia in foals of this age group.\n\nPost-mortem diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy is based on identifying the characteristic intracellular bacteria within the apical cytoplasm of proliferating crypt epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa, using a silver stain (Figure 27 .2). The severe hyperplasia of the intestinal crypts often causes a grossly detectable thickening of the mucosa of the distal small intestine. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry confirm the presence of Lawsonia intracellularisin intestinal tissue. Isolation of the organism is not a practical means of diagnosis as it cannot yet be cultivated in conventional cell-free media and the technique is available in only a few research institutions.\n\nAnte-mortem diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy is based on clinical signs, hypoproteinemia, and the exclusion of common enteric infections. The presence of the organisms can be detected using polymerase chain reaction analysis of fecal samples. Although specific, to date this technique has revealed a low sensitivity in horses. The use of serology for the diagnosis of Lawsonia intracellularis infection in a small number of foals suggests that this technique may be promising.\n\nErythromycin estolate (25 mg/kg p.o. q. 6-8 h) alone or combined with rifampin (7 mg/kg p.o. q. 12 h) for a minimum of 21 days is effective in controlling the disease. Additional symptomatic treatment such as antimicrobial, anti-ulcer therapy and parenteral feeding may be required in some foals. Foals with severe hypoproteinemia may benefit from administration of plasma intravenously.\n\nWithout appropriate antimicrobial therapy the disease may lead to death. However a rapid improvement \u00ab24-48 h) in attitude, appetite, weight gain, and colic signs or diarrhea may be observed in foals following administration of erythromycin and/or rifampin. The increase in plasma protein concentration lags compared to the improvement noted on other parameters during therapy. "}
