{"title": "Practical Fluid Therapy and Treatment Modalities for Field Conditions for Horses and Foals with Gastrointestinal Problems", "body": "When multiple perfusion parameters are abnormal, fluid therapy is likely to be warranted. However, similar to dehydration parameters, fluid therapy should not be based on these examination findings alone. In many cases, even when referral to a hospital is planned, some degree of stabilization with fluids before transport is indicated.\n\nHistorical factors that may influence the decision to begin fluid therapy include the duration of illness, decreased water intake (if noted by owner), or excessive fluid losses (sweating, diarrhea, and so forth). A history of chronic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use or previous episode of renal failure may also influence decisions about fluid therapy. Given the limitations of the physical examination to accurately detect dehydration, these historical factors are often important in decision making.\n\nFinally, owner preferences may play a large role in the decision to initiate fluid therapy in the field. An owner may have had a previous sick animal that they perceived was saved by fluid treatment in the field or conversely an animal that was lost in transport because they thought treatment was delayed. There may be financial reasons for postponing treatment or refusing hospital or referral care.\n\nUltimately, the recommendation to initiate fluid therapy in the field should first be made based on the clinical examination and historical factors on an individual case basis. However, consideration of the facilities and personnel available as well as the owner preferences must also be taken into account. A treatment plan that considers all of these factors will be most likely to lead to success and owner satisfaction, as opposed to forcing a plan that is not practical or not desired by the client. When owners elect field treatment instead of hospital referral, equine practitioners should carefully note this decision in the medical record.\n\nOnce the decision has been made to begin fluid therapy, there are 2 main choices that must be made:\n\nThere have been several excellent research studies evaluating the benefits of enteral fluids to treat many forms of equine GI disease. [3] [4] [5] [6] However, a near universal requirement for this mode of treatment is a functioning GI system that can manage and use enteral fluid administration. Although this concept seems incredibly simple, the importance of a functional GI tract cannot be emphasized enough.\n\nThe presence of significant net gastric reflux (>4 mL/kg) would be an indication that enteral fluid therapy may not be effective or even detrimental. However, the lack of net reflux when a nasogastric tube is placed does not guarantee that the horse will tolerate significant volumes of enteral fluids. It is not uncommon to administer enteral fluids to a horse without net reflux, only to return hours later and find a similar volume of fluid waiting in the stomach when a nasogastric tube is placed again. Such fluids would have had limited beneficial effect for the horse.\n\nIndications that enteral fluid therapy may not be appropriate:\n\na. Net gastric reflux >4 mL/kg b. Disease process likely to be associated with ileus c. Ultrasound examination consistent with ileus or gastric distention ( Fig. 1 )\n\nIV fluids effectively bypass the GI system, and this attribute can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. In a horse with a poor ability to absorb enteral fluid, IV fluids can be life saving. However, conditions in which high fluid volumes are desired within the GI system (ie, impactions), IV fluids may be less effective than enterally administered fluids. [3] [4] [5] IV fluids typically take a longer time to administer than enteral fluids (particularly in bolus administration), and this is another important factor to consider for treatment in the field.\n\nMost equine practitioners carry only one type of IV fluid on their truck in the larger 3-to 5-L bags that are appropriate for horses. Ideally, this fluid would be appropriate for as many different types of equine emergencies as possible. For equine GI disease, an isotonic crystalloid is usually appropriate, and the author prefers one of the commercially available acetated fluids ( Table 1) . These fluids typically have a lower chloride concentration than lactated Ringer solutions or 0.9% saline solution, which may be advantageous. 7 Hypertonic saline (7.2%) is also used in critical cases of equine GI disease, but should be followed with an isotonic IV fluid.\n\nAn important point to note, a combination of IV and enteral fluid administration is appropriate in horses with a functioning GI system. Conversely, in horses with enteritis and/or reflux, IV fluids should be used alone.\n\nThe author's practice frequently manages foals with GI disease in the field with IV fluid therapy. Enteral fluid therapy in foals is common in patients that are not able to nurse; however, this is used less frequently as a primary means for hydrating neonatal Fielding patients with GI disease. In neonatal foals, the GI system is often not functioning, the cost of IV fluids is minimal, and the time for administration of IV fluids is short. For all of these reasons, the IV route may be preferred over the oral route.\n\nAfter deciding whether to use the oral or IV route for fluid administration, the practitioner must next decide the rate of administration. Bolus administration has 2 distinct advantages:\n\n1. Hypovolemia/dehydration is corrected more rapidly. 2. Less time is required for administering fluids.\n\nContinuous fluid infusion (or smaller intermittent bolus administration over a prolonged period of time) could be less likely to cause fluid overload and may be more effective in rehydrating the animal. However, it will be slower to correct hypovolemia and will require more of the practitioner's time.\n\nA. Practical recommendations for the bolus administration of IV fluids to a moderately dehydrated/hypovolemic horse include the following: 1. Use a 12-to 14-gauge IV catheter (larger catheters may have a higher rate of complications) 8 2. Use large-bore IV sets 9 3. Raise the fluids as high as possible if trying to achieve rapid rates 4. Use a volume of 20 to 40 mL/kg bolus of an isotonic crystalloid over 1 to 2 hours B. Practical recommendations for the bolus administration of enteral fluids to a moderately dehydrated/hypovolemic horse would include the following: 1. 10 to 15 mL/kg bolus of water through a nasogastric tube 2. Electrolytes may be added to the administered fluids 3. Larger volumes are possible, but more conservative amounts may prevent associated signs of colic 4. An additional 10 to 15 mL/kg bolus can be administered every 30 to 60 minutes if the horse is tolerating the enteral fluids well\n\nThere are many options for the electrolyte composition of enterally administered fluids. The following combination has been recommended to create an enteral fluid that is similar to the electrolyte concentrations in equine plasma and has been safe to administer to horses in large volumes 10 :\n\n1. 5.27 g/L of NaCl 2. 0.37 g/L of KCl 3. 3.78 g/L of NaHCO 3 As a practical approximation, a practitioner could start with a 10-L bucket of drinking water, add 50 g of NaCl (regular table salt), 4 g of KCl (a sodium-free salt alternative), and 40 g of NaHCO 3 (baking soda) and create an appropriate fluid for administration.\n\nMany variations of this combination are possible. Fluids with a very low sodium concentration should not be repeatedly administered in large volumes because hyponatremia may develop.\n\nC. Practical recommendations for the continuous infusion of IV fluids to a moderately dehydrated/hypovolemic horse include the following: 1. 2 to 4 mL/kg/h of an isotonic crystalloid is typically appropriate for patients without significant ongoing losses. Foals with GI disease are often treated with initial bolus fluid administration (20 mL/kg) of an acetated, isotonic IV crystalloid because this can be a very practical and effective means to stabilize these hypovolemic patients. The author finds continuous administration of IV fluids to foals in the field to be quite challenging particularly with inexperienced clients. Smaller volume (eg, 10 mL/kg) fluid boluses can be repeated every 3 to 6 hours, depending on the amount of fluids being lost (ie, diarrhea or reflux) and the volume of milk that the foal is ingesting. Fluid balance is critically important in foals, and clients and practitioners should carefully monitor for signs of fluid overload with repeated fluid bolus administration.\n\nPain control is essential for effective field management of GI disease. Without adequate pain management, fluid therapy and diagnostic testing can be extremely difficult to carry out in a horse that is trying to roll or lay down. Many cases of equine GI disease are referred to hospital facilities because of an inability to adequately control the patient's discomfort as opposed to a specific requirement for surgery. In the author's opinion, the immediate cessation of pain is one of the single most important contributions that a veterinarian can make on arrival to evaluate and treat a horse with GI disease. With analgesia, the horse is more easily handled and the owners quickly feel that the situation is under control. Numerous treatments for pain management are available to the equine practitioner in the field setting, and some of the more common options are discussed later. Similar to fluid therapy, pain management options can be separated into both intermittent and continuous dosing. Some practical notes about the use of continuous infusions in the field should be considered:\n\n1. Pain medications can be added to the bags of IV fluids, but it is important that dosing is calculated carefully and the rate of administration is tightly controlled. Changes in fluid rate will also affect changes in medication administration rate! 2. If owners are assisting with fluid administration wherein medications are included, very detailed instructions are required and the risks need to be explained.\n\nchanges or if they have concerns. 4. Infusions can also be given through infusion pumps, but the costs and training to use these devices may make them impractical in many field situations.\n\nIf adding continuous pain medications to the IV fluids, the following should be followed: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are used very commonly in cases of equine GI disease. In some instances, before the arrival of the veterinarian, the owner may have administered these medications. These medications have many reported advantages and disadvantages [11] [12] [13] (Table 2) .\n\nEach case of GI disease should be considered individually when considering whether to administer an NSAID at the start of treatment. Unless there is specific knowledge of renal disease or severe dehydration, a half to full-labeled dose of an NSAID administered to horses exhibiting pain associated with GI disease is a reasonable treatment protocol. IV administration will provide more immediate relief, but oral administration is an option as well. Two frequently used NSAIDs for horses with GI disease include the following:\n\n1. Flunixin meglumine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) 2. Firocoxib (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) Firocoxib may be preferred in cases with small intestinal ischemic injury. 14 The use of NSAIDs in neonatal foals with GI disease should be carefully considered. Renal function may already be compromised in these patients, and the chronic administration of flunixin meglumine has been associated with gastric ulceration in foals. 15 However, pain management in foals with enteritis can often be achieved with low doses of flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg IV). In the author's opinion, there are selected cases wherein this class of medications can be appropriate to resolve discomfort while other treatments are initiated.\n\nAlpha-2 agonists are commonly used to provide both pain relief and sedation for horses with GI disease. They are often considered for use when rectal examinations and nasogastric intubation will be performed, because they can help to prevent injury to the horse, handler, and veterinarian. However, the analgesic effects of these medications are significant and should not be underestimated 16 (Table 3) . The negative effects of alpha-2 agonists in horses with GI disease are frequently emphasized, including inhibition of GI motility and gastric emptying. 17, 18 Some practitioners also feel that these medications may mask the animal's true degree of pain, thereby potentially delaying surgery. However, the ability to immediately halt signs of discomfort and provide safety for those handling the horse makes these drugs invaluable.\n\nThe alpha-2 agonists can be used as intermittent bolus medications or as continuous infusions. Intermittent bolus administration is a safe way to administer this class of drugs because it allows the veterinarian to observe the horse as each dose wears off. Improvement or deterioration in clinical signs can be evaluated and additional doses considered at each time point.\n\nContinuous infusions are appealing because they smooth out the \"ups and downs\" associated with intermittent bolus administrations. Client satisfaction is often higher with continuous infusions, but it can be difficult to assess changes in the horse's condition. In the author's experience, intermittent bolus injections are best used at the beginning of treatment and during the evaluation period. Once a treatment plan has been decided (ie, management at the farm instead of referral), continuous infusions can be used to provide relief to the horse and owner while treatment continues. It is extremely important that the veterinarian takes the time to educate the owner on the clinical signs indicating that the infusion dose is too high or low.\n\nDetomidine can be a particularly effective drug to use as a continuous infusion to manage painful horses that do not require surgery or do not have a surgical option. The author has used continuous infusions over a 12-hour period to provide relief to horses with GI pain while waiting for the beneficial effects of rehydration and time. In cases where there is not a definitive need for euthanasia and surgery is not indicated, an infusion of this medication can be invaluable to relieve suffering and provide comfort to the owner. Infusion doses of 2 alpha-2 agonists for use in horses are the following:\n\n1. Detomidine: 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg/h 2. Xylazine: 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg/h An initial bolus dose of the medication can be given before starting the infusion (see dosages above).\n\nIn addition to IV bolus administration and continuous infusions, alpha-2 agonists can also be given intramuscularly (IM). Detomidine can be used IM for longer-term pain Fielding management but the effects will be less pronounced than IV administration. 19 Dose titration will be easier with IV administration or infusion, however. The author has not used continuous infusions of alpha-2 agonists in neonatal foals. These medications can provide profound analgesia and sedation in foals, but cardiovascular and respiratory depression can also be significant.\n\nOpioids represent an additional class of analgesic medication that can be used for field management of pain in equine GI disease. There continues to be debate about the visceral analgesia provided by opioids in horses. 20, 21 Butorphanol is an agonistantagonist opioid analgesic that is often used in combination with alpha-2 agonists. Similar to the alpha-2 agonists, its primary use can be sedation for completion of procedures or for pain control ( Table 4) .\n\nButorphanol can be administered as intermittent bolus doses or as a continuous infusion. 22 Butorphanol is often given as an initial IV bolus dose (0.01-0.02 mg/kg) for procedures in the field combined with alpha-2 agonists. If continuous pain control is needed, an infusion (0.013 mg/kg/h) can be started and has several benefits over intermittent bolus dosing, including smoother pain control and decreased negative effects of the medication. 22 Intermittent bolus administration of butorphanol can be given IV or IM.\n\nButorphanol (0.05 mg/kg IV) has been shown to have analgesic effects in healthy foals. 23 The author typically uses a dose of 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg of butorphanol IV often combined with midazolam (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV) in foals. There is less information available regarding its use in sick foals. The author has not used continuous infusions of butorphanol in neonatal foals.\n\nLidocaine is a class 1B sodium channel blocker. Lidocaine has several potential benefits that directly relate to the management of GI disease in horses ( Table 5) . 24, 25 Lidocaine is typically administered with a loading dose of 1.3 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min (3 mg/kg/h). Some practices do not use the loading dose and simply begin the infusion recognizing that there will be a longer time to reach steady state and the full effect of the infusion. Lidocaine has some additional benefits in that it may diminish some of the negative effects of NSAIDs on the GI system. 26 For this reason, the author incorporates lidocaine in pain management for GI disease whenever it is practical. The author does not use lidocaine as commonly for field management, because it requires continuous infusion and the analgesic effects may be inadequate for horses with more severe discomfort. In addition, side effects are not uncommon and may be difficult for owners to recognize.\n\nTo the author's knowledge, lidocaine infusions have not been evaluated in neonatal foals. However, the author has used these infusions (2-3 mg/kg/h) in foals with enteritis in a hospital setting. Close supervision is required to use these infusions with foals in the field, because an accidental bolus administration could be life threatening.\n\nThe third major category of therapeutics for consideration in field management of GI cases is the use of antimicrobials for horses with GI disease. For the purposes of this article, foals (less than 2-3 months of age) will be considered separately because the disease conditions and negative effects of antimicrobial administration are different between these age groups.\n\nAntimicrobial Use in Horses with Gastrointestinal Disease that Are greater than 2 to 3 months of Age\n\nThe decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy in horses over 2 to 3 months of age with suspected GI disease is complex. Abdominal sepsis is one of the major indications for antimicrobial use. This can be due to septic peritonitis, which can often be associated with an internal abscess or GI perforation. Infectious enteritis caused by specific bacteria such as Neoricketsia risticii, Rhodococcus equi, Lawsonia intracellularis, Clostridium difficile, or Clostridium perfringens are additional indications for early initiation of antimicrobial therapy. 27 However, there are other causes of enteritis such as equine coronavirus, salmonellosis, and other undiagnosed causes that are less likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial therapy itself can cause GI disease through changes in the GI microbiome. 28 In cases of enteritis, concerns over bacterial translocation are often considered an additional reason for antimicrobial treatment whereby there may be intestinal inflammation and compromise of the mucosal barrier. A low white cell count (specifically a low neutrophil count) may also be considered an indication for antimicrobial use in this patient population.\n\nWhen evaluating the evidence for the use of antimicrobials in adult horses with GI disease (other than septic peritonitis), it is difficult to find strong support for this practice. 29 Studies have shown the presence of bacteremia in some horses with colitis; however, a similar investigation into horses with colic is warranted. 30 Previous treatment with antimicrobials does not affect the incidence of bacteremia. 30 Likewise, the presence of bacteremia does not necessarily mean that antimicrobials will reduce later complications associated with infections.\n\nEven more importantly, there is evidence that antimicrobial use is associated with the development of colitis due to C difficile. 28 Given the potentially negative effects of antimicrobial administration and the lack of proven beneficial effects, the author thinks that these medications should be restricted to cases in which a suspected and/or proven infection is likely to respond to antimicrobials. Diagnosis of a specific Fielding pathogen is unlikely to take place on the first visit to the farm, and therefore, antimicrobial use at initial treatment of adult horses is not routinely indicated unless there is a high suspicion for a specific bacterial focus. As further research is completed, these recommendations may change for specific diseases. Likewise, if septic complications (ie, septic thrombophlebitis) develop, then appropriate antimicrobial use would be warranted.\n\nAntimicrobial use in neonatal foals with GI disease has many similar considerations as in adult horses. However, there is less evidence of negative effects of antimicrobial use on the GI system of newborn foals. In addition, bacteremia and subsequent septic foci are more frequently identified in newborn foals (joints, lungs, umbilical structures) than in adult horses.\n\nA clinical trial evaluating routine antimicrobial coverage for foals with a variety of GI disease (meconium impaction, enteritis, and so forth) is greatly needed. Until such time, it is prudent to continue to cover these patients with broad-spectrum antimicrobials to minimize the chances for sepsis secondary to GI disease. However, continued consideration of responsible antimicrobial stewardship is important.\n\nNumerous medications can be considered for the management of a wide variety of GI diseases in horses. This article focuses on 3 key areas of decision making for the equine field practitioner. Treatments for gastric ulceration are considered in Pilar Camacho-Luna and colleagues' article, \"Advances in Diagnostics and Treatments in Horses and Foals with Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers,\" in this issue. Although not specifically fitting into the 3 categories of this article, N-butylscopolammonium bromide (0.3 mg/kg IV or IM) can be an effective addition to field management of the horse with GI disease. This medication can decrease the signs of colic in many horses, but may not be effective for horses with more severe clinical signs.\n\nCLINICAL PROTOCOLS FOR FIELD MANAGEMENT OF EQUINE GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE Example 1: Prolonged and Significant Gastric Reflux (>4 mL/kg/h) Horses can develop intestinal ileus with infectious enteritis, peritonitis, exerciseassociated exhaustion, or for unknown reasons. Regardless of the cause, horses with ileus often have extensive and ongoing fluid losses, abdominal discomfort, and a GI system that is unlikely to handle oral fluid administration.\n\nPractical plan for field management:\n\n1. IV fluid administration of an isotonic crystalloid a. Fluid rate 5 Rate of gastric reflux (L/h) 1 2 to 4 mL/kg/h 2. Additional supplementation of dextrose (1 mg/kg/min) in the IV fluids if prolonged anorexia is present (over 24-48 hours in adult horses; immediately in neonatal foals) 3. Placement of nasogastric tube to remove and quantify reflux 4. Administration of NSAID initially if well hydrated 5. Administration of an initial bolus dose of alpha-2 agonist to facilitate nasogastric intubation and to control pain 6. Continuous infusion of lidocaine to manage pain 4. Administration of an initial bolus dose of an alpha-2 agonist and butorphanol to facilitate diagnostic procedures and to control pain 5. Continuous infusion of alpha-2 agonist to manage pain (if needed and referral/surgery is not an option)"}
