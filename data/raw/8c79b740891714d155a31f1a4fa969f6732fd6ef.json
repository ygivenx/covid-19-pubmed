{"title": "Effects of temperature on COVID-19 transmission", "body": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . Ever since, the disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has spread worldwide quickly. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of March 20, 2020, more than 240,000 cases have been reported, and more 10,000 people have lost their lives [2] . When the SARS outbreak happened in 2002-2003, SARS-CoV spread to approximately 30 countries only [3] . However, the current outbreak of COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 176 countries or territories which suggests the enhanced ability of viruses to be aerosolized [2] . Environmental factors such as atmospheric temperature modulates the survival and spread of virus aerosols. It was shown that survival of influenza viral aerosols is reduced at higher temperatures [4] . In this study, we aimed to ascertain the relation between atmospheric temperatures and the COVID-19 disease recovery rates across the globe.\n\nThe data used in this study comes from Chinese medical community website DXY reporting COVID-19 cases at the province level in China [5] . The data for countries and regions outside mainland China is collected from an interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time [6] . DXY updates case counts every 15 minutes in all provinces in China while other countries' case counts are manually updated in a web-based dashboard from centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of Taiwan, Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO), the government of Canada, and the Australian government [6] .\n\nThe location of confirmed, death and recovered cases was obtained from the coordinate points through NGS coordinate conversion and transformation tool (NCAT) [7] . The respective temperature information for each location was obtained from Raspisaniye Pogodi (RP) temperature channel, Petersburg, Russia having license for the activity in hydrometeorology and adjacent fields. The website provides six day temperature forecasts and information on the actual temperature, observed at ground stations where the forecasts are completely updated twice a day (05:30 and 17:30 UTC) [8] . Temperature reports were downloaded for each location for the day range of 01/22/2020-03/16/2020 which were correlated with the number of confirmed positive cases, deaths and recoveries. The ggpairs() function from the GGally package was used to create a plot matrix to see how the variables relate to each other [9] . The coefficient errors provide a variation of the estimated coefficients from the actual average while the t-value measures how many standard deviations the estimated coefficient is from zero. Residuals describe how well does the model fit the data and a bell curve distribution is an ideal for any linear fit [10] . Residuals, coefficients, degrees of freedom, R-squared and F-statistic values are provided in Table 1 . ii. Changes in temperature shows no significant correlation with cases transmitted, deaths or recovered:\n\nLinear regression describes the relationship between a response variable of interest and one or more predictor variables by separating the signal from the noise [11] . Correlation analysis between temperatures, cases confirmed positive, dead and recovered was performed separately for overall countries in the month of January, February and March of 2020. For cases confirmed positive, dead and recovered, a total number of cases was used as a variable value while an average of temperature (degree celsius (\u00b0C)) for each of the months was used as a variable temperature value. Comparing overall cases for temperature, no significant correlation between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed ( Figure 5A ), however, a strong correlation (~0.9) was observed between cases confirmed and deaths for each of the three months. To further investigate effects of temperature, country (Australia) with highest average temperature (January~18\u00b0C, February~17\u00b0C, March~16\u00b0C) was compared separately with the country (Canada) with lowest average temperature (January~-3\u00b0C, February~-5\u00b0C, March~-2\u00b0C) for the month of March 2020 ( Figure 5B : Top Left and Top Right). Again, no significant correlation between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed, however, an interesting correlation pattern was seen where a drop in correlation (~0.5) was found between cases confirmed and recovered in Australia and a drop in correlation (~0.3) was found between cases confirmed and deaths in Canada. China being the earliest and highly affected country with COVID-19 transmission, separate correlation plots were generated between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered for the months January-March 2020 ( Figure 5B : Bottom Left, Bottom Right; Figure 5C : Left). While no significant correlation between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed, a strong correlation between cases confirmed and recovered (~0.9), and cases confirmed and deaths (~1) was recorded. Finally, a correlation matrix ( Figure 5C : Right) for the month of March 2020 for the US was generated and again no significant correlations were observed between any of the selected variables.\n\nAll rights reserved.

A strong correlation between cases confirmed with deaths and cases confirmed with recovered was observed, so a robust regression model was expected. Although, we found insignificant correlations between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered, considering it as one of the variables in multiple regression model won't make a significant difference. A significant P value and F score was obtained (Table 1 \n\nData analyzed from 01/22/2020-03/16/2020 for COVID-19 confirmed positive, death and recovered cases identify an increasing number of cases being recovered (~83%) especially in China, while Iran and Italy showed a slow recovery with 30% and 37% recovery rates respectively. China reported the highest percent deaths (~3.96%) in the world. Although a strong correlation between cases confirmed with recovered, and cases confirmed with deaths was observed, changes in temperature showed no significant correlation with cases transmitted, deaths or recovered for the period 01/22/2020-03/16/2020. However, an interesting finding was observed wherein a drop in correlation was found between cases confirmed with recovered in Australia (average temperature ~16\u00b0C) and cases confirmed with deaths in Canada (average temperature ~-2\u00b0C). Finally, a multiple regression model was generated using predicted April 2020 temperatures with confirmed positive cases for March 2020 for Australia, Canada, China, and the US to predict the number of deaths in April 2020. The generated model predicted ~14, 16, 3972 and 223 more deaths for countries Australia, Canada, China, and the US respectively. This data and model signifies urgency of confining COVID-19's pandemic spread with the predicted rise in number of deaths.\n\nSP and AS conceived the concepts, planned and designed the article.
