{"title": "Savage Nature and Ecologic Exchange", "body": "\u201cThere are neither carnivores nor reptiles in Tahiti,\u201d wrote Paul Gauguin in his journal Noa Noa. \u201cThe only \u2018wild game\u2019 on the island are the pigs which have escaped into the forest, where they have multiplied and become entirely wild.\u201d\n\nThe artist\u2019s first impression after the long voyage, \u201csixty-three days of feverish expectancy,\u201d was \u201cnothing very extraordinary; nothing, for instance, that could be compared with the magnificent bay of Rio de Janeiro.\u201d A native Parisian, Gauguin had spent his childhood in South America, where his family had ties to Spanish nobility in Peru. His mother collected pre-Columbian pottery. These early life experiences he mythologized into a complex persona, often referring to himself as part savage. \u201cYou know that I have Indian blood, Inca blood in me, and it\u2019s reflected in everything I do\u2026. I try to confront rotten civilization with something more natural, based on savagery.\u201d\n\nThis desire to escape his own times and the vestiges of a civilization he considered corrupt and dehumanizing guided Gauguin\u2019s work. He came to art late in life, first cautiously as a collector; then for pleasure, as friend of Edgar Degas, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Camille Pissarro. He became entirely consumed by art when he worked for a time with Vincent van Gogh. \u201cI am a great artist and I know it.\u201d After the stock market crash in 1882, he left Paris to travel and seek the authentic life he believed would lead him to greatness. \u201cYou must remember,\u201d he wrote to his wife, \u201cthat I have a dual nature, [that of] the Indian and [that of] the sensitive man.\u201d\n\nHe moved to the French coast. \u201cI love Brittany; I find the wild and the primitive here. When my clogs resonate on this granite ground, I hear the muffled and powerful thud that I\u2019m looking for in painting.\u201d Then he settled in Martinique \u201cto live as a savage,\u201d but soon he left France altogether. \u201cThere in Tahiti,\u201d he wrote to his wife, \u201cin the silence of the tropical night, I shall be able to listen to the sweet murmuring music of my heart\u2019s movements in loving harmony with the beings around me. Free at last with no money troubles and able to love, sing, and die.\u201d He painted his best work during his first of two trips to Tahiti. He died of syphilis nearly penniless in the Marquesas.\n\nDuring his travels to the South Sea Islands, Gauguin found that many of his expectations for a life of wildness filled with savages and untamed nature existed only in myths and fables. \u201cThe Tahitian soil is becoming completely French.\u201d Unable to find the world he dreamed about, he sought his own. This preferred world he created in his art. From the exotic islands he extracted magical colors he then placed side by side in unconventional combinations and clearly outlined. Despite his admiration for and friendship with the impressionists, he shunned their work in favor of the flat planes that anticipated modern art.\n\nBlack Pigs, on this month\u2019s cover, was painted the first year Gauguin was in Tahiti. Although he had not yet entirely abandoned perspective, spatial relationships are secondary to color and form. Traces of impressionist technique appear in the brushwork of the foliage and thatched roof of the hut. But the human and animal figures, including the namesake pigs, are simplified, almost archaic in their peacefulness, and entirely at ease with the surroundings.\n\nIn island culture, the sacred pig was the bond between gods and humans, facilitating their intermarriages or mitigating their disputes. \u201cFood for gods and men\u201d and the backbone of household prosperity, pigs were mentioned in Gauguin\u2019s writings again and again, his cordial interactions with island neighbors sprinkled with \u201cdaintily prepared little pig\u201d or \u201clittle pigs roasted on hot stones.\u201d\n\nTahiti \u201cIs the summit of a mountain submerged at the time of one of the ancient deluges,\u201d the artist wrote. \u201cOnly the very point rose above the waters. A family fled thither and founded a new race\u2014and then the corals climbed up and along it, surrounding the peak, and in the course of centuries builded a new land. It is still extending, but retains its original character of solitude and isolation, which is only accentuated by the immense expanse of the ocean.\u201d Yet even this isolation that Gauguin sensed so acutely was an illusion. During a period of exotic introductions, local animals were modified along with the political, economic, spiritual, social, and physical landscape.\n\nAnimal movement and trade around the globe, which already had altered the island fauna in Gauguin\u2019s diminishing paradise, now have eliminated even the possibility of zoonotic isolation. As animals and the viruses, bacteria, and internal and external parasites that travel with them find themselves evolving independently from their forbearers in new ecologic niches with new pressures and pathogenic tools, genetic changes occur in them. These changes facilitate emergence of new pathogens that can then start the process over again as the pathogens continue to span the globe.\n\nIsland people, Gauguin believed, \u201cHad been richly endowed with an instinctive feeling for the harmony necessary between human creations and the animal and plant life which formed the setting and decoration of their existence.\u201d This harmony, which included the savage element he sought and captured in garish tones, he viewed as a main ingredient of great art, along with the unity of humans with nature. This oneness in nature, with its inherent intimacy of all the macroscopic and microscopic players, requires concurrent attention to human health, animal health, and environmental health. For in this cauldron, as full participants and hosts of the wild microbes, which inhabit and kill us, we remain, like Gauguin, part savages."}
