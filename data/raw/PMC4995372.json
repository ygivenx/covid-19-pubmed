{"title": "TGEV infection up-regulates FcRn expression via activation of NF-\u03baB signaling", "body": "To determine whether TGEV is capable of modulating pFcRn expression in IPEC-J2 cells, infectious TGEV or UV-inactivated virus was adsorbed to confluent monolayers of IPEC-J2 cells at an MOI of 1 and pFcRn mRNA was measured 8, 12, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h post-virus exposure by real-time RT-PCR. We found that the level of pFcRn mRNA expression was 2-fold higher at 30, 36 and 48 h post-infection, compared to mock-infected cells (Fig. 1A). However UV-inactivated virus treatment only caused a 1.4-fold up-regulation in pFcRn expression, compared to mock-infected cells (Fig. 1A). Replicating virus had a more pronounced effect than UV-inactivated virus.\n\nTo determine whether the increased mRNA levels resulted in increased pFcRn protein production, IPEC-J2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of infectious virus at an MOI of 1 and pFcRn protein was measured in cell lysates by Western blot (Fig. 1B). Increased levels of pFcRn were detected by 36 h and 48 h TGEV exposure (Fig. 1B). Thus, the elevation in protein levels correlated with the increased mRNA levels by 30 h.\n\nIPEC-J2 cells were transiently transfected with p65-EGFP fusion expression plasmid and the subcellular localization of the fusion protein was analyzed using confocal laser microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2A, p65-EGFP was located exclusively in the cytoplasm in mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells (top panels), but it rapidly translocated to the nucleus when those cells were infected with TGEV (bottom panels).\n\nCells were cotransfected with 450 ng/well of NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter plasmid pNF-\u03baB-Luc and 50 ng/well of the Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK which was served as an internal control. Twenty-four hours later, cells were infected or control-infected with TGEV. Cells were harvested at the indicated times and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase Assay System. Data represent relative firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. NF-\u03baB-regulated luciferase expression was significantly enhanced during TGEV infection at 24, 30, 36 and 48 h, compared to mock-infected samples (Fig. 2B).\n\nThese two results demonstrated that the classical pathway of NF-\u03baB was activated in IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV infection.\n\nInhibition of pFcRn induction by BAY 11-7082, a small molecule that blocks the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, suggested that the early proinflammatory response involved activation of the classical NF-\u03baB pathway. IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with BAY 11-7082 (10 \u03bcM) for 30 min and subsequently infected by TGEV. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 significantly reduced TGEV infected pFcRn mRNA levels to that of the TGEV infected cells without BAY 11-7082 treatment as assessed by real-time RT-PCR at 48 h (Fig. 3). Therefore inhibition of pFcRn induction by BAY 11-7082 suggested that early activation of the classical pathway of NF-\u03baB activation was critical for subsequent up-regulation of pFcRn mRNA.\n\nNeural Network Promoter Prediction software was used for searching putative transcription start sites in the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pFcRn gene (minimum promoter score: 0.8). Computational analysis revealed that the pFcRn gene contains two transcription start sites (Fig. S1). Transcription start site-2 has a higher score than the transcription start site-1. Furthermore, the alignment of pFcRn and human FcRn (hFcRn) upstream sequences of the start codon showed that regions near transcription start site-2 of pFcRn gene have a high homology with the transcription start site nucleotide sequence of hFcRn gene (Fig. S2). In the study, the transcription start site-2 was considered as the transcription start site of pFcRn gene (Fig. S1).\n\nTo study whether NF-\u03baB regulates pFcRn expression through a mechanism that involves direct binding to a putative regulatory NF-\u03baB binding sequence located in the pFcRn gene, we utilized luciferase reporter constructs of the pFcRn promoter that contained NF-\u03baB p65 binding sites.\n\nWe created four luciferase reporter gene constructs with sequentially shortened fragments of the promoter region: pFcRn-luc-1 (\u22121381~+596), pFcRn-luc-2 (\u22121150~+596), pFcRn-luc-3 (\u2212577~+596) and pFcRn-luc-4 (\u2212208~+596). Furthermore, transient transfection of the four luciferase reporter plasmids in IPEC-J2 cells revealed that these plasmids significantly increased the basal promoter activity above that of the empty vector (Fig. 4A). Next, we tested whether pFcRn promoter activity could be up-regulated by TGEV infection. The results showed that luciferase activity was significantly enhanced using the pFcRn-luc-1, pFcRn-luc-2 and pFcRn-luc-3 constructs during TGEV infection compared with mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells, while the luciferase reporter construct harboring the shortest fragment of pFcRn-luc-4 had not significant differences comparing with mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 4B).\n\nTo directly assess the involvement of NF-\u03baB in pFcRn expression, we investigated whether overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 affects the promoter activity of pFcRn. We transiently transfected IPEC-J2 cells with the p65-Tag2B plasmid. We found that pFcRn-luc-1, pFcRn-luc-2 and pFcRn-luc-3 constructs were induced in the presence of p65, while pFcRn-luc-4 had not significant differences comparing with mock group (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 is sufficient to up-regulate pFcRn expression. Meanwhile the NF-\u03baB sensitive region is located in the sequence between \u22121381 and \u2212208 of the pFcRn promoter.\n\nThe canonical NF-\u03baB DNA binding sequence is a common 10-bp consensus DNA element that has been identified as 5\u2032-GGGRNNYYCC-3\u2032 (where R is an A or G; N is any nucleotide; Y is C or T)22. We searched for putative NF-\u03baB-binding sequence(s) along this promoter region (\u22121381~\u2212208). Computational inspection revealed that the promoter of the pFcRn gene contained sequences with a similarity to the NF-\u03baB consensus sequence (Fig. 5A). We used a ChIP assay to verify that these putative NF-\u03baB binding sequences had the capability to directly bind NF-\u03baB proteins in living cells. First, cross-linking the DNA with bound NF-\u03baB proteins in situ in TGEV infection verus mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells, NF-\u03baB-DNA complexes were co-incubated with p65 specific antibody. Then, the purified DNA fragments were measured by PCR. As shown in Fig. 5B, PCR with specific primers (Table 1) produced a band from DNA coprecipitated with p65 (Fig. 5B, \u22121286, \u22121128, \u2212642 and \u2212563), however the sequence (\u2212894) failed to produced a band. In a negative control, immunoprecipitation with normal mouse IgG did not generate any corresponding PCR products (Fig. 5B, lane 3). The results suggest that p65 transcription factor interacted with the four NF-\u03baB binding sequences of pFcRn gene in IPEC-J2 cells.\n\nEMSA and supershift assays further confirmed the four NF-\u03baB binding sites that were identified from the ChIP assay. Nuclear extracts co-incubated with oligonucleotides containing NF-\u03baB binding sequences (Fig. 6A, \u22121286, \u22121128, \u2212642 and \u2212563). As shown in Fig. 6A, a higher amount of complexes formed when bound to nuclear extracts from TGEV-infected cells than when bound to nuclear extracts from mock-infected cells. These complexes were further shifted by anti-p65 monoclonal antibody, indicating that the complexes contained p65 transcription factor (Fig. 6A, upper arrow, supershifted NF-\u03baB-specific complex, lane 4). To verify the binding specificity, a competition assay was performed. Although the specific band could not be significantly inhibited by unlabeled oligonucleotides in \u22121128, \u2212642 and \u2212563 NF-\u03baB binding sequences (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Nonlabeled oligonucleotide was added to a 100-fold excess, the specific band was inhibited by unlabeled oligonucleotides in \u22121128, \u2212642 and \u2212563 NF-\u03baB binding sequences (Fig. 6B, lanes 2, 4, 6).\n\nFcRn has more recently been shown to express in a variety of mammalian species12. Meanwhile, several studies have reported the distribution, function, and regulation of human and rodent FcRn expression9242930. Our study demonstrated that pFcRn mediated bidirectional IgG transport across polarized IPEC-J2 cells that potentially provide the mucosal protection31. Some studies have showed that up-regulation of FcRn expression can augment the IgG transport across the polarized epithelial cells24. FcRn overexpression boosts humoral immune response in transgenic mice20.\n\nTGEV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus32. The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome encodes viral structural and accessory proteins, including the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and three accessory proteins 3a, 3b, and 7, meanwhile 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the genome encode the viral replicase33. Our study is the first to show that TGEV infection up-regulates pFcRn mRNA and protein in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 1). Levels of pFcRn mRNA in UV-inactivated virus treatments are only 1.4-fold lower compared to replicating virus infection. These results show that TGEV-mediated FcRn up-regulation is mainly related to the replication of virus, meanwhile UV-inactivated TGEV-mediated FcRn up-regulation maybe related to viral structural and accessory proteins.\n\nSome researchers have shown that FasL- and mitochondria-mediated pathways were activated by TGEV infection, which induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells34. Moreover, TGEV infection promoted the activation of p53 signaling to induce cell apoptosis35. Our results show that TGEV infection activates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, determined by a p65 nuclear translocation assay and NF-\u03baB luciferase report system assay (Fig. 2). Furthermore, pFcRn expression induced by TGEV infection was strongly reduced by the NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 3). This was corroborated by the overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65, which up-regulated the activation of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids. This complementary experiment lessens the concern of specificity or toxicity of the chemical inhibitor.\n\nThe promoter regions for human and bovine FcRn have been analyzed, and the regulation of expression has been shown to be mediated with p65 transcription factors2324. In this study, we analyzed the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pFcRn gene by TESS and TFSEARCH programs, and found there are five potential NF-\u03baB transcription factor p65 binding sites between position \u22121381 and \u2212208. Therefore, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids with sequentially shortened fragments of the FcRn promoter region. Transient transfection of the pFcRn promoter luciferase reporter plasmids revealed that pFcRn-luc-(1\u20133) plasmids resulted in increased promoter activity in the presence of TGEV infection (Fig. 4B), further demonstrating that TGEV up-regulates pFcRn expression in IPEC-J2 cells. pFcRn-luc-(1\u20133) plasmids were also activated by overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 plasmid (Fig. 4C). These results showed that the NF-\u03baB sensitive region of FcRn promoter is located in the sequence between \u22121381 and \u2212208.\n\nWe mapped four NF-\u03baB binding sequences in our ChIP experiment (Fig. 5). This result was further confirmed by EMSA and supershift analysis (Fig. 6). These results indicated strong and effective molecular interactions between NF-\u03baB p65 and the selected transcription binding sites of the pFcRn promoter.\n\nNF-\u03baB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates the transcription of genes such as chemokines, cytokines, proinflammatory enzymes, adhesion molecules, proinflammatory transcription factors and so on. Based on previous studies, NF-\u03baB is activated via two distinct kinase-dependent pathways, the classical NF-\u03baB pathway and the alternative NF-\u03baB pathway. While our research mainly concentrated on the classical NF-\u03baB pathway, its activity can be modulated significantly by additional factors that transfer into the nucleus and bind to NF-\u03baB binding sequences. In this regard, we analyzed the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pFcRn gene. and found there are several other transcriptional factors in this region, such as AP-1 and Sp1. Some studies have suggested that NF-\u03baB dimers can act synergistically with AP-1 and Sp1 transcriptional factors to influence gene regulation363738. These protein-protein interactions may be involved in mediating transcriptional regulation of the pFcRn gene in response to stimuli and can functionally cooperate to elicit maximal activation of the promoter.\n\nIn summary, TGEV infection up-regulates pFcRn expression in IPEC-J2 cells, and activates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Furthermore, pFcRn expression was strongly reduced by inhibitor BAY 11-7082 treatment after TGEV infection. This result deduced that the up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV infection may be related to NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. We constructed FcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids by computational inspection. According to the analysis of the activation of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids by TGEV infection and overexpression p65 plasmid, the NF-\u03baB sensitive region of FcRn promoter is located in the sequence between \u22121381 and \u2212208. There are four NF-\u03baB binding sites confirmed by ChIP and EMSA experiments. In the study, upregulation of pFcRn expression following virus infection may play an important role in effectively protecting the mucosal surface from the pathogens invasion.\n\nIPEC-J2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Media (DMEM)/Ham\u2019s F-12 (1:1) (Hyclone, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. TGEV strain WH-1 (GenBank accession no. HQ462571), which was isolated in China, was propagated in PK-15 cells.\n\nAffinity-purified rabbit anti-cytoplasmic tail of porcine FcRn (anti-pFcRn-CT) polyclonal antibody was prepared in our laboratory. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Thermo Scientific Pierce (USA). Mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody was purchased from BOSTER (China).\n\np65-EGFP fusion expression plasmid was prepared in our laboratory, p65 gene was PCR subcloned into pEGFP-C2 vector. p65-Tag2B plasmid encoding p65 was prepared in our laboratory, p65 gene was PCR subcloned into pCMV-Tag 2B vector.\n\nConfluent monolayers of IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 8, 12, 24, 30, 36, and 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. Total RNA was extracted from IPEC-J2 cells with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Then, total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, China). Real-time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate in three separate experiments using pFcRn primers (5\u2032-GGCGACGAGCACCACTACTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGCCGACCATGATTCCAACC-3\u2032) and GAPDH primers (5\u2032-ACATGGCCTCCAAGGAGTAAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATCGAGTTGGGGCTGTGACT-3\u2032) and the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, China). All reactions were performed for 40 cycles: 5s at 95 \u00b0C and 30s at 60 \u00b0C. pFcRn expression was calculated following normalization to GAPDH levels by the comparative delta delta threshold cycle (\u0394\u0394CT) method. The specific amplification reactions were confirmed by melt curve analysis.\n\nLysates from IPEC-J2 cells were prepared as described previously39. The total proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, USA). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-pFcRn-CT polyclonal antibody and mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody were used as primary antibodies, then HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously31.\n\nIPEC-J2 cells were grown to approximately 60\u201370% confluency on coverslips placed in 24-well plates. After transfection with 1.0 \u03bcg of p65-EGFP fusion expression plasmid per well, cells were mock-infected or infected with TGEV at a MOI = 1. 36 h after stimulation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, USA) to detect nuclei.\n\nFour fragments of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the pFcRn were PCR subcloned into the luciferase expression vector pGL3 (Promega, USA) through Sac I and Hind III digestion. pFcRn-luc-1, containing sequences from \u22121381 to +596 of the pFcRn gene promoter was amplified by the PCR primer pairs (5\u2032-GCGAGCTCGCTATAG CTCTGATTCGACC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAAGCTTCTGAGCGGGAGACCTGGGG-3\u2032); pFcRn-luc-2, which contains the segment from \u22121150 to+596 of the pFcRn gene promoter was amplified using the reverse primers described above and a forward primer (5\u2032-GCGAGCTCGCTTCAGCTGGACCCGTAGC-3\u2032). Plasmid pFcRn-luc-3, which contains the segment from \u2212577 to +596 of the pFcRn gene promoter, was generated using the reverse primers described above for PCR amplification and a forward primer (5\u2032-GCGAGCTCTACTTAAAGGGGTACGGGGT-3\u2032). Plasmid pFcRn-luc-4, which contains the segment from \u2212208 to +596 of the pFcRn gene promoter and was generated using the reverse primers described above for PCR amplification and a forward primer (5\u2032-GCGAGCTCGGGGGTGCTGACGAGGTAAGAA-3\u2032).\n\nIPEC-J2 cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA). Cells were transfected with 950 ng of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids and 50 ng of a Renilla luciferase pRL-TK control plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, cells were infected with or without TGEV (MOI = 1). Cells were harvested at the indicated time and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase Assay System (Promega, USA). The values for firefly luciferase were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity and expressed as fold activation over the mock-infected group.\n\nIn order to detect whether TGEV infection activates NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, IPEC-J2 cells were cotransfected with 450 ng/well of NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter plasmid pNF-\u03baB-Luc and 50 ng/well of the Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK. Cells were infected or control-infected with TGEV and were harvested at the indicated times and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase Assay System.\n\nChIP was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Epigentek, USA). In brief, IPEC-J2 cells were infected with or without TGEV (MOI = 1) for 30 h. The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde. The nuclei were isolated and DNA was sheared by sonication. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 1 \u03bcg of Ab specific for p65 or with 1 \u03bcg of normal IgG as negative control for 2 h at room temperature by an orbital shaker (50\u2013100 rpm). The DNA samples were amplified by PCR primers (Table 1) in optimized conditions.\n\nNuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (CWBIO, China). The single-strand oligonucleotides was labeled with biotin on the 3\u2032 end DNA, annealed to form double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the tested NF-\u03baB sequences from the pFcRn promoter: pFcRn \u03baB-1286 (5\u2032-AAAAATGGGA GTTTCCATTTCCG-3\u2032), pFcRn \u03baB-1128 (5\u2032-GTAGCCTGGGAACTTCCAGAT GCC-3\u2032), pFcRn \u03baB-642 (5\u2032-CCAGAAGAGGCAAATTCCTAGAGAC-3\u2032) and pFcRn \u03baB-563 (5\u2032-AAGGGGTACGGGGTCTCCTTGGGG-3\u2032). For competition assays, a 50-fold excess of nonlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated during the preincubation time. For the supershift assays, 1 \u03bcg anti-p65 monoclonal antibody directed against NF-\u03baB p65 was preincubated with the nuclear extracts. The complexes were run on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. EMSA experiments were performed according to the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce, USA).\n\nData from three independent studies were analyzed using ANOVA to identify significant changes between TGEV-infected and mock-infected cells. All results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM from three independent experiments. P values < 0.05 were considered significant (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01).\n\nHow to cite this article: Guo, J. et al.
