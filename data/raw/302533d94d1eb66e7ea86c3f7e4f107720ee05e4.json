{"title": "", "body": "We are living in an era in which the world has become a \"global village,\" with \"shrinking\" national borders and liberalization of trade between countries. The populace of discrete countries can no longer consider themselves remote from the risk of incursion of a wide variety of infectious diseases of public health and veterinary significance. 1, 2 It is widely acknowledged that increasing globalization, whether with respect to movement of people or trade in animals or animal products, provides greater opportunities for the rapid and widespread dissemination of a variety of diseases from country to country and within countries, a situation that is historically unprecedented. The ever-increasing volume of international movement has given rise to a major paradigm shift in the geographic distribution of many diseases. Fewer and fewer diseases can now be regarded as \"geographically restricted\" or \"compartmentalized\" to certain areas of the world.\n\nThe list of human and animal pathogens that have been accidentally introduced or reintroduced into regions or countries where they were never previously known to occur or from which they were eradicated in the past is expanding. 3 Examples of the more important human diseases and disease agents spread through international travel include tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS virus), influenza, malaria, cholera, Lassa fever, and Ebola virus. The roster of animal diseases with convincing evidence of spread through international movement or trade in animal products is also extensive and includes foot-and-mouth disease, hog cholera, exotic Newcastle disease, equine influenza, glanders, canine parvovirus, West Nile virus (WNV), and more recently, highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 virus). Some animal disease pathogens (e.g., WNV, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis [VEE] virus, and Burkholderia mallei) are important zoonoses and can give rise to significant morbidity and mortality in humans, as well as in various animal species.\n\nMany transboundary animal disease incursions are relatively transient in duration; the diseases are effectively controlled and eradicated within a limited time after their introduction. However, this is not always the case. Some disease pathogens are highly adaptable and very successful in establishing themselves in a new geographic environment. This is well illustrated by the behavior of WNV over the past 10 to 15 years both in Europe and in the Western Hemisphere. The virus has been confirmed in an increasing number of European countries, including but not necessarily limited to Hungary, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal; in some of these countries there is evidence of overwintering of the virus. An analogous situation exists in various countries in the Western Hemisphere in which WNV has adapted itself remarkably well and become endemic since its first known introduction into North America (United States) in 1999 and now has resurged again in 2012 in humans in the United States. 4 It took only 5 years for WNV to become established in 48 of the 50 states in the United States.\n\nThe horse is unique not only because of the longevity of the species and significant financial value of individual animals, but also, more importantly, because of the frequency with which horses are shipped between countries and between continents for various commercial purposes. Frequently taken for granted, the advent of commercial jet aircraft transportation has been the single most important factor in facilitating the unparalleled growth in international trade in equids, semen, and embryos that has taken place over the past 50 years or so. 5 Air travel has revolutionized the speed and ease with which horses can be shipped between or within countries and has largely replaced other means of transporting horses over considerable distances by land or by sea. In today's world, the horse can truly be considered no less an \"international jetsetter\" than its human counterpart.\n\nChanging trends in the equine industry worldwide have contributed significantly to the evolving nature of the international trade in equids, semen, and embryos. In the process, however, such changes have inevitably increased the risk of spread of various equine diseases. Before elaborating on specific factors involved in the international dissemination of equine diseases in detail, it is important to appreciate the transformation that the equine industry in many countries has undergone over the past 50 to 60 years. Since the 1960s, there has been an unprecedented upsurge in the growth of the horse industry in many countries, both for commercial and recreational purposes. Consideration of the increased prominence of the equine industry worldwide must acknowledge the resurgence of interest in the horse through leisure activities. The 2005 Economic Impact Study carried out in the United States identified recreation as the single largest equine-related activity, involving 3.9 million horses of an estimated national equid population of 9.2 million animals. 6 The most significant factor in this development was the favorable economic climate enjoyed by these countries over this period. National economics flourished from changes in the global market structure under various multinational trade agreements. 7 Among the industries to benefit has been the equine industry, with a resultant increase in the volume of international trade in equids and semen. The trend toward globalization of the equine industry received further impetus after establishment of the World Trade Organization 63 Infectious Diseases and International Movement of Horses Peter J. Timoney C H A P T E R estimated 6.9 million in the mid-1990s to 9.2 million in 2005. Both impact studies dramatically demonstrated the major contribution of the horse industry to the national economy. In the 2005 study, the combined contributions of the direct, indirect, and induced effects of the industry (in terms of Gross Domestic Product) were assessed at more than $102 billion. 6 The industry provides considerable employment, estimated at 1.4 million full-time equivalent jobs annually. Until the widespread financial recession in the last few years, revenue from the sale of equids had risen steadily, grossing in excess of $2 billion at its peak.\n\nNot surprisingly, changing trends in the horse industry over the past 40 to 50 years, most of them commercially driven, have been a major influence on the evolving nature of international trade in equids, semen, and embryos. 7 As already mentioned, horses are most frequently transported between countries to compete in various performance events, racing, show jumping, and other types of equestrian sports. The number of highly prestigious and lucrative equine competitive events has proliferated around the world in the past 15 to 20 years. 3 This is well illustrated by the increase in number of major equestrian events held under the aegis of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI); these events have nearly doubled over the past 8 years alone. Attracted by the considerable prize monies involved, owners are shipping their horses many thousands of miles, sometimes from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, or vice versa, to compete in international equestrian or racing events. Transporting horses over significant distances for competition purposes has inherent risks (e.g., traumatic injuries, shipping fever). Nonetheless, the number of prestigious international events will likely continue to increase, with escalation in the volume of movement of horses, despite the inherent health risks involved.\n\nAnother important economic trend that has grown in volume, especially over the past 20 years, is the practice of dual-hemisphere breeding of stallions, in which a stallion fulfills a breeding season in both hemispheres in the same calendar year. 10 This is more popular and economically more advantageous, for both stallion and mare owner alike, than transporting mares between hemispheres for breeding purposes (e.g., shipping a mare from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere to be bred in Southern Hemisphere time). The vast majority of \"shuttle stallions\" are shipped from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere. While many of them are Thoroughbreds, Standardbred stallions are also shuttled. They originate principally in Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Canada, and Japan and travel primarily to Australia and to a lesser extent, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, Venezuela, and South Africa.\n\nAs noted, acceptance of AI by an increasing number of breed registries has been another major development in the horse industry in recent years. 11 Technical advances in preserving the fertilizing capability of equine sperm and the viability of equine embryos have provided the basis for the expanding trade in fresh-cooled and especially frozen semen being shipped internationally. There is greater demand among breeders for access to particular preeminent bloodlines among those breeds in which AI is permitted.\n\nIn summary, continued proliferation in the number of prestigious equestrian and racing events, dual-hemisphere breeding of stallions, and the legalized use of AI in all the major horse breeds, except the Thoroughbred, are the principal, economically driven trends in the equine industry, and these trends are responsible for the sustained growth in international trade in equids, semen, and embryos worldwide.\n\n(WTO) in January 1995. 8 The primary goal of the WTO is to promote freer economic exchange between member countries through reduction or elimination of protectionist barriers to trade. 9 Regrettably, continued growth in the horse industry worldwide has slowed in the last several years as a consequence of the recession that has significantly impacted the national economies of many countries. Notwithstanding the current economic downturn, emergent equine industries are being developed in the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.\n\nAn appreciation of the nature of international movement of equids is fundamental to understanding how trade in horses, semen, and embryos can contribute to the spread of equine diseases. 5 Horses are shipped internationally for various reasons. Some are intended for permanent entry and others for temporary entry into the importing country. Most frequently, horse travel between countries is for the purpose of competing in a particular performance event. Among the more prominent and better known performance activities are racing, show jumping, dressage, eventing, driving, polo vaulting, reining, and endurance riding.\n\nShipment of stallions and mares for breeding purposes is another important facet of the international movement of equids. This is especially significant in the case of the Thoroughbred industry worldwide, which does not allow the use of artificial insemination (AI) or embryo transfer in the breed. Over the years, significant growth has occurred in the practice of \"shuttling\" stallions, Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds between countries in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 10 Horses are also shipped internationally to be sold at a commercial sale or in the case of a change in ownership.\n\nA final category of horse movement that applies primarily to countries other than the United States is the shipment of horses for processing, primarily for human consumption. Several hundred thousand horses are shipped annually from Eastern Europe, Northern Africa, and certain countries in South America to various countries in Western Europe, including but not exclusive of Italy, Germany, France, and Belgium, for this purpose. 3 As with live animal movements, the international trade in equine semen and embryos has expanded significantly in recent years. 5 This is largely the result of the acceptance of AI in all the major horse breeds except Thoroughbreds. 11\n\nA major factor contributing to the importance of international trade in equids, semen, and embryos has been the increased socioeconomic significance of the equine industry in a growing number of countries worldwide. The horse has joined the list of animal and plant commodities that are traded globally. 3 To date, relatively few countries have attempted to assess the impact of their respective industries on their national economies. Limited studies have been done in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Mexico, all of which underscore the important cultural and economic value of the horse in these countries. 12 Australia and the United States have carried out comprehensive studies of their respective equine industries. 6, [13] [14] [15] The American Horse Council Foundation commissioned an economic impact study of the horse industry in the United States in the mid-1990s 6 and again 10 years later. 14 Comparison of the findings of the two studies revealed that the U.S. equid population had increased considerably over the intervening period, from an which are primarily vector-borne infections but can also be transmitted iatrogenically. Besides the potential for many equine diseases to be introduced and effectively spread by respiratory, venereal, or vector-borne routes, agents can be transferred between countries by other means, which, although less frequently encountered, should not be overlooked. A limited number of pathogens (e.g., EHV-1 and EHV-4, T. equigenitalis) can be introduced into a country through the importation of a pregnant mare that is harboring these organisms in utero. In such cases, the potential for spread of these pathogens is at the time of foaling. 3 A final means of introduction of a disease agent is through importation of an equid infested with the intermediate state of a parasite such as the larvae of the botfly, Cochliomyia hominivorax, the cause of screwworm myiasis. 3 In sporadic but repeated cases, horses imported into the United States from certain South American countries (e.g., Argentina, Venezuela) have been found infested with these larvae on postentry inspection.\n\nEven though most of the international spread of equine diseases results from the movement of equids, usually horses, trade in semen is also of proven importance in the global dissemination of certain equine pathogens, including EAV, T. equigenitalis, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. 3, 16, 17 Imported virus-infective semen, primarily from Warmblood stallions in Europe, was responsible for extensive and economically significant outbreaks of EVA in the United States and in Argentina in 2010, in some cases associated with abortion and the death of young foals. 16, 18 Over the past 40 years, numerous outbreaks or epidemics of particular equine diseases have resulted from the importation of an infected animal(s) or infective semen 3 (Table 63-2) . African horse sickness (AHS) and VEE are the two most dreaded equine diseases, and both have been responsible for devastating epidemics. The most recent epidemics of AHS outside the endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa occurred during 1987-1991 in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, causing\n\nA diversity of related and unrelated factors have been identified with the potential to influence the global distribution of equine infectious diseases. 3, 5, 10 These include the international trade in equids, semen, and embryos; multinational trade agreements; emergent diseases; variants of established equine pathogens; climatic disturbances; availability of new vectors; migration of amplifying/reservoir hosts or vectors of specific pathogens; disease spread from feral equids; reliability of preexport laboratory testing; and acts of agroterrorism.\n\nMovement of equids and trade in semen represent the most important factors responsible for the spread of equine diseases. 3, [16] [17] [18] [19] With the progressive growth in international trade in equids, semen, and embryos, the risk of dissemination of a variety of equine diseases, both within and between countries, has increased commensurately. This has been amply borne out by the significant number of times that specific diseases have been introduced or reintroduced into countries or geographic regions of the world through the importation of equids or semen. Most vulnerable to the risk of disease incursions are countries with a significant import trade in equids, semen, and embryos such as the United States.\n\nThe risk of incursion of transboundary equine diseases can be influenced in part by whether the equids being imported are approved for temporary or permanent entry into a country. 3 An exception would be those diseases transmitted primarily by the respiratory route, such as equine influenza, equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and -4 (EHV-4)-related diseases, strangles, and glanders. Spread of respiratory infections can occur irrespective of whether importation is temporary or permanent. On the other hand, in the case of equine diseases characterized by the carrier state, the risk of transfer of these diseases is much greater in horses taking up permanent residence in a country. This applies to vector-borne diseases, such as equine infectious anemia (EIA) and equine piroplasmosis (EP), as well as infections transmitted by the venereal route such as contagious equine metritis (CEM), equine viral arteritis (EVA), and dourine (Trypanosoma equiperdum).\n\nClearly, the mode(s) of transmission of individual equine diseases has an important influence on how successfully they can be transmitted to and spread within a na\u00efve or unprotected equine population in an importing country. Any shipment of equids may include one or more animals incubating or subclinically infected with a particular agent or that are asymptomatic carriers of a specific pathogen. Examples include equine herpesviruses (EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV-4), equine arteritis virus, EIA virus, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, Taylorella equigenitalis, Burkholderia mallei, Salmonella spp., T. equiperdum, Theileria equi, and Babesia caballi. 3, 7 Respiratory transmission by an acutely infected equid is widely considered one of the most efficient means of disease transfer. Respiratory-borne diseases, such as equine influenza virus (EIV), equine rhinopneumonitis caused by EHV-1 or EHV-4, and strangles, have been spread repeatedly between countries through international movement of horses (Table  63-1) . Venereal transmission is also of major significance with respect to imported breeding animals, both stallions and mares, which may be carriers of specific pathogens (e.g., EAV, EHV-3, T. equigenitalis, T. equiperdum, and certain serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).\n\nA further category of carriers are equids persistently infected with disease agents such as EIA virus, T. equi, and B. caballi, season and an estimated financial loss to the state's Thoroughbred breeding industry of at least $4 million. More recently, there was a second major CEM event in the United States that was first discovered in late 2008. 24 The source of T. equigenitalis was believed to have been a carrier stallion imported from Denmark in 2000. Approximately 1100 stallions and mares were exposed during the occurrence, with the cost to the industry and the government of several million dollars. Experience over the years has repeatedly reaffirmed the ease with which various equine diseases have been disseminated globally through the international trade in equids and semen. 5 Such incursions have had major financial repercussions for the horse industry in affected countries. Aside from significant disruption to racing or other equine performance events and perhaps to a country's breeding industry, occurrences of transboundary diseases can have a long-term effect on international trade. This can best be illustrated by the restrictions on importation of equids that many countries impose on any country or region thereof affected with AHS. In addition to equine health and economic consequences, the introduction of certain transboundary equine diseases (e.g., VEE, glanders) can have a major impact on public health.\n\nIn an era of increasing globalization, facilitation of trade between countries through the reduction or elimination of restrictive trade practices has been the goal of various bilateral and multinational trade agreements. The European Union Free Trade Area, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) are among the major world trading groups, markets, and agreements. 3 Formation of the WTO at the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations in 1994 marked a significant change in how its member significant economic losses and having a major impact on international trade in equids from affected countries. 19 The source of the original outbreak in Spain in 1987 was traced to the importation of 10 zebras from Namibia, which transited through Portugal en route to a safari park near Madrid. Equine influenza has frequently been spread through international movement and has occasionally been responsible for widespread epidemics of disease in immunologically na\u00efve or inadequately protected horses. Such occurrences have had a major economic impact on the racing industries in affected countries. The first recorded introduction of EIV into the racing population in Hong Kong in 1986 resulted in the cancellation of seven race meetings and financial losses totaling almost $1 billion. 20 Similarly, the disease had a major impact on the racing industry in South Africa after it was first introduced in 1992 21 and reintroduced in 2003. 22 The latter epidemic affected an estimated 3700 horses in training (40% of the country's racehorse population) at Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Port Elizabeth and approximately 3000 other equids. Loss in revenue to the equine industry from this epidemic was estimated at more than 60 million rand. The most recent major epidemic of EIV occurred in Australia in 2007. 23 This was traced to the importation of a number of subclinically infected shuttle stallions from Japan. Breaches in biosecurity at a postentry quarantine station led to escape of the virus and very extensive spread of the disease among the horse populations in southern Queensland and New South Wales. Estimated economic impact of this epidemic exceeded 1 billion dollars.\n\nThe widespread occurrence of CEM in Kentucky in 1978 exemplifies the major economic impact that introduction of a transboundary equine disease can have on a previously unexposed na\u00efve breeding population. 3 The disease was traced to the importation of two carrier stallions from Europe in the fall of 1977 and resulted in major disruption to the 1978 breeding equids. Clearly, similar variants of this subtype of VEE virus may reemerge in the future and spread to other geographic areas, which could include Central America and the United States.\n\nThe most recently recognized example of emergence of a variant of an established equine pathogen is the identification of strains of EHV-1 with enhanced neuropathogenicity for the horse. These neuropathogenic strains of the virus appear to have evolved as a result of a single-point mutation in the viral DNA polymerase gene. 27 Such strains have been shown to cause higher clinical attack rates and greater case-fatality rates than virus strains lacking this mutation. Available evidence from outbreaks of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States indicates that the frequency of this disease is increasing in these countries. Because of the high percentage of horses that can become latent carriers of this infection, these neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1 will inevitably become more widely disseminated through the international movement of equids and there is evidence to indicate this is already occurring.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that climate-related phenomena, such as El Ni\u00f1o-southern oscillation and global warming, can have an influence on the occurrence and distribution of certain diseases, especially vector-borne diseases such as AHS, equine encephalosis, and the equine viral encephalomyelitides. 28, 29 The increased temperatures and altered rainfall directly linked to such phenomena are likely to affect the range and biologic behavior of arthropod vectors and intermediate, amplifying/ reservoir hosts, as well as the viability and maturation rates of infective agents in those vectors. 30 African horse sickness, equine encephalosis, and vesicular stomatitis are diseases affecting the horse that can be spread through windborne carriage of infected insect vectors such as Culicoides spp. Study of the climatic patterns for the western region of South Africa, where most epidemics of AHS have occurred, has shown that all but 1 of the 14 epidemics of the disease recorded since 1803 have been in El Ni\u00f1o years. 31 Such years were characterized by an earlier period of drought followed by heavier rainfall than usual. The higher-than-normal temperatures customary of the drought period lead to significant increases in the vector population and favor the transmission of AHS.\n\nAlthough not yet conclusively proved, climate phenomena can and will have an influence on the global distribution and incidence of various vector-borne diseases of equids and other species.\n\nThe inadvertent introduction of a particular arthropod vector (e.g., species of mosquito, midge, or tick) into a country or geographic region for the first time can have significant consequences if the arthropod becomes successfully established in its new environment and is shown to be competent to transmit specific vector-borne diseases present in the country or region. In the past 20 to 30 years, the United States has been the recipient of two mosquito species, Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta) or Asian tiger mosquito and Ochlerotatus japonicus, neither of which was previously known to occur in the country. 32, 33 Both mosquito species have been found to be competent vectors of certain equine viral encephalomyelitides, especially Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and West Nile encephalitis. 7 Since their known introduction, the two mosquito species have established themselves and are currently becoming widely distributed in an increasing number of states. countries could regulate for the control of infectious diseases of plants and animals under the organization's Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. 8 The key provisions of that agreement are aimed at facilitating international trade in animals, including animal germplasm, by reducing preimport and postimport health requirements among participating countries. 7 It could be rightly argued that easing trade restrictions and related testing requirements enhances the risk of introducing transboundary diseases while limiting a country's ability to protect its equine industry from the incursion of various equine pathogens. Currently, there is no compelling justification for reducing existing preentry and postentry health requirements for equids imported into the United States on the pretext of furthering international trade. To do so would undoubtedly heighten the risk of introducing a range of equine diseases, some transboundary and others presently endemic in the United States equid population. An example in point is the number of stallions and mares imported from Europe over the past 15 years that turned out to be carriers of CEM on postentry quarantine and testing. All had been tested in their respective countries of origin and were certified negative for the carrier state prior to export. The potential economic consequences for the domestic horse industry from any such incursions could far outweigh the financial benefits to be gained from facilitating international trade.\n\nOver the past 40 to 50 years, several previously unrecognized diseases have been described that can affect horses and other members of the family Equidae. 2, 5, 7 The list of \"new\" or emergent equine pathogens continues to grow, as it does for humans and other animal species. It currently includes several bacterial diseases, such as CEM, Potomac horse fever, equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis, equine proliferative enteropathy, and nocardioform placentitis and abortion, and a number of viral diseases, including equine encephalosis, Getah virus infection, Hendra virus infection, Nipah virus infection, and Salem virus infection. The geographic distribution of most of these diseases has remained essentially the same as when they were originally identified. A notable exception is CEM, which has been spread to various countries worldwide through the international movement of carrier stallions and mares. 3 Additional equine diseases will undoubtedly be discovered. Containing these diseases and preventing their dissemination globally will require the cooperation and combined efforts of horse industries and animal health officials in the country or countries in which they are initially recognized.\n\nNatural mutation of certain equine pathogens has given rise to variants and strains of enhanced virulence for the horse, as illustrated by several examples in the past 20 years. In 1989 a novel strain of EIV (H3N8), the Jilin'89 strain of equine-2 influenza A virus, emerged in China. 25 Thought to be of avian origin, this particular virus strain was responsible for tens of thousands of cases and numerous deaths in the indigenous equid population. If it had spread outside China, this strain of H3N8 could have had devastating consequences for other unprotected equine populations.\n\nSignificant outbreaks of equine encephalomyelitis in southwestern Mexico in 1993 and again in 1996 provided the first confirmed evidence of the emergence of a strain of VEE virus subtype IE with the capability to cause illness and associated mortality not only in humans but also in equids. 26 Before these outbreaks, the endemic IE virus subtype was not considered to have the potential to cause widespread disease in Iberian peninsula in 1987, where the source of virus was a group of zebra imported into Portugal from Namibia en route to Spain.\n\nBefore the terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001 and the subsequent anthrax letter incidents, little consideration was given to the need to prevent and respond to a bioterrorist attack against the U.S. agricultural industry and equine population in particular. 38 Regretfully, past events serve to underscore the reality of the threat posed to agricultural industries. Whereas the transfer of diseases between countries occurs most often accidentally or inadvertently, such incursions could also be deliberate, the consequence of an act of bioterrorism.\n\nIn view of the major economic importance of the U.S. equine industry, certain transboundary diseases could have a huge financial impact if deliberately introduced into the unprotected equine population. Of the entire array of equine infectious diseases, AHS and VEE have the potential to cause the most serious and devastating epidemics of disease among all categories of horses. Neither causal agent would require to be \"weaponized\" to achieve such an outcome. Were they to occur, such disease events would also cripple the ability of the United States to export equids or semen throughout the world.\n\nClearly, the potential threat of agroterrorism should neither be underappreciated nor oversensationalized. Widespread acceptance of the reality of the threat is the important issue, as well as the awareness that a national emerging response plan has been developed to deal with any bioterrorist-related health emergency involving the horse or other livestock industries.\n\nHistorically, veterinary regulatory authorities worldwide have responded to the threat of infectious disease spread inherent in international trade by formulating import policies that maximize disease prevention safeguards but minimize facilitation of trade. It has become increasingly difficult, however, for countries to uphold policies based on overly restrictive import controls in today's global economic climate. They are perceived in conflict with the overall goal of the WTO, which is to eliminate or reduce unjustified protectionist barriers to trade among member countries. 9 It is freely accepted that the economic viability and success of the horse industry worldwide is critically dependent on the ability to ship horses within a state, a country, or internationally, without excessive restrictions on movement. With the aim of reducing the level of risk of disease spread from such movements, regulatory authorities have developed specific control measures to prevent the introduction and potential dissemination of a range of equine diseases into the importing country. To assist in formulation of their animal health import policies, the Office International des Epizootics (OIE), now the World Organization for Animal Health as recognized by the WTO, has developed a Terrestrial Animal Health Code that provides countries worldwide with principal control standards for preventing the spread of specific diseases listed by the OIE, including those of equids. 39 Regardless of country of origin or destination, horses are shipped internationally under license/ permit issued by the appropriate regulatory agent in the exporting country. This documentation serves as a means of individual animal identification, certification of health and freedom from contact with various equine diseases, and a The United States is not unique in respect to the availability of new vectors. Other countries in both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere have had similar experiences. 3 Such incursions, mostly of species of mosquito, have been short-lived in some cases, whereas in other cases the new vector has become permanently established in its new habitat as exemplified by Aedes albopictus in northeastern Italy.\n\nMigration of amplifying/reservoir hosts or vectors of specific pathogens can influence the geographic distribution and occurrence of particular diseases of humans, equids, and other livestock species and wildlife. Evidence indicates that migrating birds can be responsible for infrequent cases or reintroduction of certain diseases into countries in which they did not previously occur. [34] [35] [36] This has been starkly illustrated by the recent rapid global spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1). Birds are also thought to be responsible for the occasional reintroduction of WNV into various countries in southern Europe and the Middle East from the African continent. 37 There is little doubt that migratory birds have been primarily responsible for the spread of this virus from the United States into Mexico, Central America, and certain Caribbean countries over the past several years. Birds have also been implicated in the transfer of EEE and Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) viruses between southern and northern hemispheres of the Americas, and vice versa.\n\nThe distribution and occurrence of other equine arthropodborne diseases can be influenced by the migration of the relevant vectors. 3 African horse sickness, equine encephalosis, and vesicular stomatitis are diseases that can be spread over considerable distances through wind-borne carriage of infected Culicoides spp. Wind-borne carriage of infected mosquitoes may similarly account for the periodic incursions of Japanese encephalitis virus into the Cape York Peninsula of northeastern Queensland, Australia, from Papua, New Guinea (P.M. Ellis, personal communication, 2000).\n\nWithout detracting from the value of preexport testing that involves laboratory tests required by the importing country, as well as live animal inspection, it must be acknowledged that the certifications of health and freedom from contact with various infectious diseases accompanying horses being shipped are not always reliable. Of continuing concern is the need for a greater harmonization between the laboratory testing conducted prior to export and that carried out in the importing country. There have been repeated instances where CEM carrier stallions and mares and equine arteritis virus carrier stallions and infective semen were only detected on postentry laboratory examination. The importance of a thorough clinical examination performed on all horses prior to shipment cannot be overemphasized. Horses should not arrive after a transatlantic flight with overt signs of strangles or other respiratory diseases. The consequences of such disease introductions can be significant as was amply demonstrated by the series of outbreaks of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy that occurred in 2006 and which were traced back to a shipment of infected horses from Germany.\n\nIn countries with feral equid populations, there is the potential risk of spread of certain diseases to domestic horses. This was well exemplified by the reintroduction of AHS into the any of these importations, it could have had major economic repercussions for the horse breeding industry. Another example of the existing federal postimport inspection and testing program successfully preventing the introduction of a transboundary disease is screwworm myiasis. In repeated but infrequent cases, horses imported from certain South American countries and certified free from this parasite were confirmed infested with the larvae of Cochliomyia hominivorax in postentry quarantine.\n\nIn addition, horses shipped from various European countries have occasionally been found to be clinically affected with diseases, such as strangles or EHV-1 and EHV-4-related diseases, on arrival in the United States. Collectively, these incidents bring into question the reliability of preimport laboratory testing and clinical veterinary inspection conducted by the exporting country. Also, they reaffirm the importance of maintaining the current system of postentry safeguards that has served the horse industry well over the years and has helped to minimize the risk of introduction of various transboundary diseases.\n\nClearly, a balance must be struck between allowing movement of equids and providing the necessary safeguards to prevent the spread of various equine diseases. In light of the risks associated with international trade in horses and semen, countries need to have in place adequate postentry risk management strategies. Countries can no longer be passive to the health risks involved.\n\nSurveillance of equine diseases at a national level and prompt reporting to the relevant authorities and industry organizations are critical to the effectiveness of national and international equine health control programs. Essential to any disease or early-warning monitoring program is the availability of adequate diagnostic capability for the disease(s) under surveillance. Accuracy and timeliness of a laboratory diagnosis of the suspected disease are of paramount importance.\n\nIn any national reporting system, primary consideration should be given to the equine diseases listed by the OIE, together with a number of those listed as multispecies diseases. In addition to OIE notification of occurrences of listed diseases and any newly emergent disease problem, an informal diseasereporting system is supported by a growing number of countries worldwide. It requires that each participating country provide interim and quarterly reports of any confirmed occurrences of a range of equine diseases, many but not all listed by the OIE, to the International Collating Center at the Animal Health Trust in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe value of timely exchange of accurate, up-to-date information on occurrences of specific equine diseases at an international level cannot be overemphasized. Such sharing of information facilitates the process of risk assessment analysis between countries and enhances opportunities for reduction or elimination of unjustified restrictions on international trade in equids, semen, and embryos. At a national level, monitoring, surveillance, and reporting serves as a means of early detection of a disease that has already gained entry, whether a transboundary or endemic disease. It cannot be overemphasized how important a role the practicing veterinarian and the horse owner play in ensuring the success of any surveillance and reporting system and in helping to monitor the health integrity of their equine industry.\n\nNo program for the national or international control of equine infectious diseases can expect to be successful if it lacks the declaration that the exporting country or its region/zone has been confirmed free of evidence of certain diseases within a particular time frame.\n\nIn addition to certification of freedom of the exporting country or region/zone from specified equine diseases (e.g., AHS, VEE, glanders), current regulations governing the import of equids into the United States and most other countries require similar certification with respect to the premises of origin of the horse(s) being exported, other premises within a stated radius of that location, and most importantly, the individual animal(s) being exported. Horses must be held in preexport quarantine for a specified period, during which they are subjected to the necessary clinical examination and laboratory tests prescribed by the importing country. Of critical importance to ensuring the integrity of sampling and testing of horses for export is the need for some form of permanent individual identification such as a unique animal identification number (microchip) or alternative system of permanent identification (iris scanning, retinal scanning). Poor or inferior systems of animal identification increase the potential for willful substitution of horses before shipment and enhance the disease risks involved.\n\nAssuming all the preexport certification and testing meet the requirements of the importing country, the horse(s) being shipped are approved for temporary or permanent entry into that country. Where the United States is the country of destination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires that all horses imported from non-AHS-affected countries are, transported immediately after arrival in a federally sealed conveyance to a USDA-approved quarantine station closest to the port of entry. The animals are held in isolation for up to 42 hours, during which they are clinically monitored and serologically tested for evidence of dourine, glanders, EIA, and EP. Subject to a satisfactory health report and negative serologic findings for these diseases, horses are released from quarantine and shipped to their state(s) of destination.\n\nIntact male or female horses over 731 days of age originating in a CEM-affected country and approved for permanent entry into the United States are required to undergo additional testing to confirm their freedom from T. equigenitalis, the causal agent of CEM. To accomplish this, such individuals are shipped in a sealed conveyance to a state that is federally approved to accept and quarantine stallions and mares from CEM-affected countries. They are quarantined on a premises approved for that purpose in accordance with federal and state guidelines and subjected to the necessary testing for CEM. They are released from quarantine once they have been confirmed not to be carriers of T. equigenitalis.\n\nSome in the international community advocate that the importing country accept the reliability of laboratory testing conducted in the exporting country, thereby obviating the need for a period of postentry quarantine and repeat laboratory testing in the country of destination. However, experience has shown that failure to provide adequate post-entry screening of equids for specific infections can pose an unacceptable disease risk for the horse industry in the importing country such as the United States. For example, over the past 15 years alone, a total of 36 stallions and mares imported into the United States from Europe were confirmed carriers of T. equigenitalis on postentry quarantine and testing. All the animals involved were tested in the countries of origin and certified free of evidence of this bacterium. If this transboundary disease had been reintroduced into the United States breeding population through horses during transportation; and (3) educate government regulatory authorities, industry, and stakeholders on OIE standards and biosecurity requirements relating to the international movement of performance horses.\n\nYet, another example of an industry initiative is the concept of establishing an \"equine disease-free zone\" in countries wishing to host an internationally recognized performance event but are unable to do so because of the disease status of their resident equine population. The aims of developing such a facility are twofold: (1) to enable equine athletes from other countries to compete in an international event without the risk of being exposed to a disease or diseases endemic in the host country and (2) to protect the host country's equine population from a disease introduced by a competing country's horses. Proof of concept that this was achievable was the \"Equine Disease-Free Facility\" that was developed in Guangdong Province in PR China. It enabled the country to host the equine program of the 2010 Asian Games. The detailed advance planning, discussions, and negotiations that took place between the relevant international agencies and ruling bodies and the national and provincial animal health authorities in China were crucial to ensuring the success of this unique initiative. Under similar circumstances in the future, other countries may adopt the same approach if intent on hosting international performance events.\n\nGreater control over the international spread of equine diseases is an achievable goal. However, attaining it is only possible if horse industries and animal health regulatory authorities worldwide work cooperatively together toward that end.\n\nThe complete reference list is available online at www. equineinfectiousdiseases.com. participation and support of the horse industry. With this in mind, several international groups have been formed over the years that represent the racing, equestrian sports, and breeding sectors of the industry. They include the Federation of Horseracing Authorities Permanent Liaison Committee on the International Movement of Horses, the FEI, and an International Thoroughbred Breeders' Federation. These respective organizations or groups are broadly representative of the international community of countries with significant horse-breeding/performance industries. Their overall goal is to enlist industry involvement in identifying specific equine health or related issues that adversely affect international movement of horses and to seek ways to resolve them.\n\nWithin the realm of industry initiatives, the FEI has recently sought the support of the OIE in seeking to obtain a more equitable balance between facilitation of international movement of high-value performance horses and meeting the testing requirements of importing countries. It has been recognized for many years that the risk of disease transfer is not necessarily equivalent among different categories of horses. For several reasons, high-value performance horses can be considered a lower risk category. Because of the frequency with which they travel internationally, they are tested more often and monitored more closely for a range of the most important diseases. Additionally, their vaccination status for diseases of significance is likely to be current. The goal of this initiative is to establish a strategic framework for countries and regions to harmonize their approach to sanitary conditions for the international movement of performance horses. Objectives are to (1) maintain the high health status of performance horses and minimize the risk of transboundary disease transmission while removing unjustified health requirements; (2) ensure the welfare of the"}
