{"title": "Investigation of the influence of EPs \u00ae 7630, a herbal drug preparation from Pelargonium sidoides, on replication of a broad panel of respiratory viruses", "body": "In southern Africa, the roots of Pelargonium sidoides have been used for centuries for the treatment of different aliments including infections of the airways (Conrad et al. 2007; Brendler and van Wyk 2008; Kolodziej 2008) . In Germany, a standardised extract of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs \u00ae 7630) was registered in 2005 by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) for the indication \"acute bronchitis\" (Conrad et al. 2007) . A couple of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials support the efficacy and safety of EPs \u00ae 7630 for the treatment of acute bronchitis in adults and children (Conrad et al. 2007; Agbabiaka et al. 2008; Matthys and Funk 2008; Timmer et al. 2008; Kamin et al. 2010a,b; Matthys et al. 2010) . The postulated mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of EPs \u00ae 7630 in bronchitis patients include immunomodulatory and cytoprotective effects, inhibition of interaction between bacteria and host cells, and increase of cilliary beat frequency on respiratory cells (Conrad et al. 2007; Kolodziej 2008) .\n\nNotably, bacteria are estimated to cause <10% of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis while >90% of cases are estimated to be caused by respiratory viruses (Gonzales and Sande 2000) . Therefore, effects of EPs \u00ae 7630 on replication of respiratory viruses are of interest in the context acute bronchitis. An aqueous extract of Pelargonium sidoides had been already tested for antiviral effects against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) * Corresponding author.

(Schnitzler et al. 2008 ) common viruses that cause recurrent orofacial or genital lesions (Cernik et al. 2008) . The extract inhibited replication of both viruses through interference with virus surface resulting in virus inactivation (Schnitzler et al. 2008) .\n\nHere, we investigated the effects of EPs \u00ae 7630 on virus replication of a broad panel of respiratory viruses including Influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, coxsackie virus, and rhinovirus.\n\nEPs \u00ae 7630 was provided by the Phytochemistry Section of the Department of Preclinical Research, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals (Karlsruhe, Germany).\n\nThe following viruses were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA): respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain A2 (ATCC-No. VR-1540), adenovirus 3 strain GB (adeno 3, ATCC-No. VR-3), adenovirus 7 strain Gomen (adeno 7, ATCC-No. VR-7), parainfluenza virus type 3 strain C243 (parainfluenza 3, ATCC-No. VR-93), human rhinovirus 16 strain 11757 (rhino 16, ATCC-No. VR-283).\n\nThe influenza virus strains A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and A/California/7/2004 (H3N2) were received from the World (Cinatl et al. 1994 ); coxsackie A9). All cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FSC).\n\nVirus stocks were prepared by infecting cells with the respective viruses. Aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. Virus titres were determined as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 /ml) in 96-well microtiter plates. The infectious titre was determined by the method of Spearman and K\u00e4rber (Spearman 1908; K\u00e4rber 1931) . The maintenance medium during infection was for influenza viruses serum-free MEM supplemented with 2 g/ml trypsine and for all other viruses MEM supplemented with 2% FCS.\n\nThe cytopathogenic effect (CPE) reduction assay was performed as described before (Michaelis et al. 2010) . Confluent cell monolayers grown in 96-well microtitre plates were infected with respective viruses in the presence or absence of EPs \u00ae 7630. The following multiplicities of infection (MOIs) were used: H1N1, 0.005; H3N2, 0.005; influenza B, 0.01; coxsackie A9, 0.005; RSV, 0.01; adeno 3, 0.01; adeno 7, 0.02, HCo-229E, 0.01; parainfluenza 3; 0.01; rhino 16, 0.005; H5N1, 0.001.\n\nThe virus-induced CPE were recorded using an inverted light microscope at 24 h (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, influenza B, coxsackie A9, coxsackie B5), 48 h (coxsackie B4, rhino 16), 72 h (RSV, HCo-229E, parainfluenza 3), or 96 h (adeno 3, adeno 7, parainfluenza 2) post infection (p.i.). EPs \u00ae 7630 was continuously present starting with a 1 h pre-incubation period.\n\nThe effect of EPs \u00ae 7630 on cell viability was investigated in non-infected cells that were treated in the same way with EPs \u00ae 7630 like the virus-infected cells in the CPE reduction assay. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay as described before (Michaelis et al. 2004 ).\n\nInfectious virus titres were determined as described before at \"Cells and viruses\". Cells were infected with the respective viruses in the absence or presence of EPs \u00ae 7630 at the following MOIs: H1N1, 0.005 (titres were determined 24 h post infection); H3N2, 0.005 (24 h); coxsackie B5, 0.005 (24 h); coxsackie A9, MOI 0.005 (24 h); parainfluenza 3, 0.01 (72 h); RSV, 0.01 (72 h); HCo-229E, 0.01 (72 h).\n\nEPs \u00ae 7630 did not decrease viability of all investigated cell types in concentrations up to 100 g/ml. Moreover, EPs \u00ae 7630 did not affect CPE formation induced by H5N1, adeno 3, adeno 7, or rhino 16 in the examined concentrations up to 100 g/ml. However, EPs \u00ae 7630 interfered with CPE formation caused by H1N1, H3N2, RSV, HCo-229E, parainfluenza 3, or coxsackie A9 (Table 1) .\n\nInhibition of virus-induced CPE formation may be a consequence of inhibition of virus replication, of cytoprotective effects without influence on virus replication, or of a combination of both. Therefore, the influence of EPs \u00ae 7630 was investigated on H1N1, H3N2, RSV, HCo-229E, parainfluenza 3, or coxsackie A9 virus titres. EPs \u00ae 7630 decreased titres of all susceptible viruses in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1 ).\n\nHere, we investigated the effect of EPs \u00ae 7630 on replication of a panel of respiratory viruses. EPs \u00ae 7630 inhibited the replication of the respiratory viruses H1N1, H3N2, RSV, HCo-229E, parainfluenza 3, and coxsackie A9.\n\nThe magnitude of EPs \u00ae 7630-induced antiviral effects differed between the sensitive viruses. EPs \u00ae 7630 at a concentration of 100 g/ml completely suppressed replication of the seasonal influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2) and of RSV. Virus titres of coxsackie A9 were reduced by about 10,000-fold, of parainfluenza 3 by about 150-fold, and of HCo-229E by about 10-fold. A 10-fold decrease of virus titres may be sufficient to prevent viral disease, especially in a pre-emptive setting. All viruses that were inhibited by EPs \u00ae 7630 are enveloped viruses (H1N1, H3N2, HCo-229E, RSV, parainfluenza 3) except coxsackie A9 while all non-sensitive viruses were non-enveloped viruses (adeno 3, adeno 7, rhino 16) with the exemption of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus H5N1 (Knipe and Howley 2007) . Therefore, EPs \u00ae 7630 appears to primary target enveloped viruses. In accordance, an aqueous extract of Pelargonium sidoides had been found to inhibit replication of the enveloped viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2 through interference with the virus surface resulting in virus inactivation (Schnitzler et al. 2008 ). However, since EPs \u00ae 7630 inhibited replication of the non-enveloped coxsackie A9 other mechanisms may also play a role.\n\nThe varying sensitivities to EPs \u00ae 7630 of the seasonal influenza A strains H1N1 and H3N2 in comparison to H5N1 cannot be explained by our data. H5N1 viruses are generally known to be less sensitive to antiviral treatment than seasonal strains (Michaelis et al. 2009 ). Moreover, the influenza A virus haemagglutinin proteins that bind to the sialic acids on the target cell's surface as a first step in the viral infection process significantly vary between the seasonal strains and H5N1 (Michaelis et al. 2009 ) and may therefore be differently affected by agents that interact with the virus surface.\n\nIn conclusion, we show that the Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs \u00ae 7630 that is approved for the treatment of acute bronchitis interferes with replication of different respiratory viruses includ-ing seasonal influenza A virus strains, RSV, human coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackie virus. Since respiratory viruses are estimated to cause >90% of cases of acute bronchitis (Gonzales and Sande 2000) antiviral effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of EPs \u00ae 7630 described in human acute bronchitis patients (Conrad et al. 2007; Agbabiaka et al. 2008; Matthys and Funk 2008; Timmer et al. 2008; Kamin et al. 2010a,b; Matthys et al. 2010 ).\n\nThe work was financially supported by Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals (Karlsruhe, Germany)."}
