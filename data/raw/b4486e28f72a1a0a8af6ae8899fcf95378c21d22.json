{"title": "Highly convergent synthesis and antiviral activity of (E)-but-2-enyl nucleoside phosphonoamidates", "body": "Modified nucleosides represent a major class of therapeutics for cancer and viral diseases [1] . Among them, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) pioneered with (S)-9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine ((S)-HPMPA) [2] in 1986 by Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd and Erik De Clercq, forms a key class of drugs active against various DNA viruses as well as against retroviruses. However, those compounds suffer from limitations such as their reduced cell penetration (the free phosphonic acid form is negatively charged at physiological pH) as well as from nephrotoxicity. This has led to extensive search for new ANPs as well as to the development of prodrug approaches [3, 4] for enhanced bioavailability and cell internalisation [5e8] . Several ANP prodrugs were marketed, such as adevofir dipivoxyl (bis-POM PMEA) [9, 10] for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), tenefovir disoproxyl (bis-POC PMPA) [11] or the newly tenofovir alafenamide [12e14] for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV [15, 16] .\n\nOver the last decade, our group has developed a new family of ANPs based on a trans-but-2-enyl phosphonate scaffold [17] . Compounds were directly obtained as prodrugs by a highly convergent and modular approach based on the powerful olefin acyclic cross metathesis (CM) between various allylphosphonate synthons bearing biolabile groups and N1-(or N9) crotyl (or allyl) pyrimidines or purines. This approach showed a remarkable breakthrough for the synthesis of nucleoside prodrugs compared to the known linear approaches, which suffer from low yields. It is also clear from the literature that the choice of a prodrug has a direct impact on its targeting and cell release and greatly influences the overall outcome and efficiency of the parent drug [18e20]. Thus, following this synthetic pathway, we have obtained several prodrugs [21e25] including the most commonly used carbonyloxymethyl pronucleotides (pivaloyloxymethyl-or POM, isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl-or POC), but also the alkoxyalkyl monoester (hexadecyloxypropyl or HDP, octadecyloxyethyl or ODE) [26] . Several of these (E)-but-2-enyl ANPs prodrugs exhibited remarkable antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses in submicromolar concentrations. The bis-(POM)-(E)-TbutP (1) and the prodrugs 2e4 were all very active against several herpesviruses [i.e. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)], representing a new potential antiviral lead.\n\nDespite a significant amount of research and development on aryl phosphoramidate prodrugs reported by McGuigan [27, 28] , the development of aryl phosphonoamidates, especially in the field of ANPs, has been very sparely investigated [29] . Thus, in this article, we describe the in-water ultrasound promoted synthesis and antiviral evaluation of hitherto unknown (E)-but-2-enyl nucleoside phosphonoamidates with high yields, (Fig. 1 ).\n\nAryl phosphonoamidates are generally obtained by treatment of the parent dimethylphosphonate nucleoside with TMSBr into the corresponding silyl esters, followed by a subsequent treatment with an excess of phenol and L-alanine-O-alkyl ester in the presence of triphenylphosphine and Aldrithiol. The desired products are often isolated with poor yields (<3%) to traces as stated for the preparation of phosphonoamidate prodrug of tenofovir (TAF) [30, 31] In order to avoid these low yields, our strategy to the targeted phenyl phosphonoamidate of (E)-but-2-enyl ANPs, was to react the allyl phenylphosphonoamidate with a N1-crotylated nucleobase under acyclic cross metathesis (CM), which is quite challenging taking into account the poisoning effect of nitrogens on CM ruthenium catalysts [32] . Any attempt to obtain the desired allylic phosphonoamidates, by the shortest strategy involving the introduction of allyl group on the phosphorodichloridate 5 to give the desired monoalkenylated compound 6, failed. In our hands as, despite several conditions, only the product of dialkylation was obtained, when observed (Scheme 1). Therefore, we decided to turn our attention to the H-phosphonate chemistry. The dimethylphosphite 7 was reacted with allyl bromide under Michaelis-Becker conditions to give the dimethylallylphosphonate 8 with 78% yield. It is important to quote than this reaction was scaled-up to 50 g. After substitution of a OMe group of 8 by a chlorine in presence of oxalyl chloride, this position was then substituted by a phenolate generated in situ to give 9 (as a mixture of enantiomers) in 65% yield. Compound 9 was treated by bromotrimethylsilane in dichloromethane for 24 h at room temperature, to give the phosphonic acid monoester derivative 10 in excellent 91% yield (Scheme 2).\n\nFollowing a procedure described by Gajda et al. [33] , phosphonate 10 was then converted to various methyl-, isopropyl-and benzyl-L-alanine esters 11e15, in order to compare the influence of the ester group or the phosphorus chirality, on the activity and toxicity of final ANPs. Compounds 11,14 and 15 were obtained as a mixture of diastereomers (from 6:4 to 1:1). Only the diastereomers of compound 11 (R \u00bc Bn) were separated by careful column chromatography on silica gel (twice) and compounds 12 and 13 were isolated as single isomers, respectively. 31 P NMR spectroscopy confirmed the isolation of each products with the presence of single peak, while a mixture of isomers provide two peaks. The sitting drop crystallization allows to obtain a crystal of both molecules and their structures were unambiguously determined by Xray to be P (R) for 12 and P (S) for 13, respectively, (Fig. 2) .\n\nNext, the silylation of thymine was obtained in 5 min at room temperature in presence of bistrimethylsilylacetamide BSA. The intermediate was directly engaged in nucleophilic substitution reaction with crotyl bromide, chlorotrimethylsilane and sodium iodide [34] . This reaction is performed under ultrasonic activation to afford after seven hours the desired compound 16 in quantitative yield. 16 was then converted to the N3-Boc thymine derivative 17 in quantitative yield, (Scheme 3) [35] .\n\nWith all partners in hand (16, 17 and 11e15), we turned our attention to the olefin CM reaction using either the 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst [36] (G-II), the more reactive Hoveyda-Grubbs (HG-II) catalyst [37] or its derivative, the Zhan catalyst-1B, (Table 1) .\n\nThis specific CM reaction with a phosphonoamidate is challenging and needs optimization since, as stated previously, it is well established in the literature that compounds containing basic nitrogen atoms can poison the CM ruthenium catalysts and are thus problematic substrates for olefin metathesis. It was shown that the presence of electron withdrawing groups next to the nitrogen decreases the electron density and the deactivation of the catalyst can be attenuated as well as the use of microwave irradiations [38] . It was shown also that the presence of Lewis acid or Cu(I) salt can improved the yields of RCM of amino acids [39] . The influence of ultrasonication was also tested. For this optimization, we used the allylphosphonoamidate 11 and the crotylthymine 16 or 17, taken as model.\n\nWhen N1 alkylated thymines 16 or 17 were reacted in DCM with diastereomeric mixture of phosphonoamidate synthon 11 under classical heat activation (D) (entries 1e3), no desired compounds were found in all conditions tested (equivalents, substrate, Ru catalyst, co-catalyst (Lewis acid, entry thymine derivatives). The use of microwaves irradiation (MW) (entries 4, 5) and sonication ()))) (entries 6 to 10) failed also. Only the use of water on sonication led the expected phosphonoamidate ANP 18 in moderate 41% yield (entry 11) [40] . The modulation of the conditions in a sealed tube and with an addition of a surfactant (2.5% of polyoxyethanyl-atocopheryl sebacate) (entries 12 and 13) does not improve significantly the yield of the reaction [41] .\n\nThanks to this breakthrough approach, some (E)-but-2-enyl C5substituted thymidine phosphonoamidates 19e22 were obtained in yields ranging from 38% to 44%, (Scheme 4). Based on our previous data [22] , the 5-fluoro-(23) and 5-chloro-(24) analogs, which are bioisosteres of methyl group, were obtained, in 35% and 36% yield, respectively.\n\nAmong all the tested compounds, bearing different biolabile group (POM, POC, HDP, phosphonoamidate), the diastereomeric single phosphonoamidate forms 19 and 20 were the most potent and selective against both wild-type (TK \u00fe ) and thymidine kinase deficient (TK \u00c0 ) varicella-zoster (VZV) strains with EC 50 (50% effective concentration) values in the range of 0.3e0.6 mM ( Table 2 ).\n\nThe cytostatic activity (CC 50 ) decreased by a factor 2 when comparing compound 19 with the bis-(POM)-(E)-TbutP (1) resulting in a selectivity index (SI, ratio CC 50 to EC 50 ) superior to 200. The selectivity of 20 against VZV was about half of that calculated for 19. These prodrugs showed also activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), TK \u00c0 HSV-1 and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) strains (EC 50 in the range of 3e12 mM), which was comparable to the EC 50 's obtained for cidofovir ( Table 3 ). The diastereomeric single phosphonoamidate forms 19 and 20 had weak activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or no activity at the higher concentration tested (100 mM) against vaccinia virus and adenovirus.\n\nThe (E)-but-2-enyl C5-substituted pyrimidine phosphonoamidates 21 and 22 inhibited VZV replication with EC 50 's in the range of 1e8 mM and did not affect cell growth or morphology at the highest tested concentration (100 mM). In contrast to 22, compound 21 had some anti-HSV activity while both were able to reduce HCMV Scheme 2.

Several hypotheses can support these results, as a better bioavailability of these molecules under the phosphonoamidate form compared to the other prodrug forms. The activity can also be increased by a better half-life and less toxic side-products. However, the newly synthesized prodrugs did not showed activity against vaccinia virus in contrast to bis-(POM)-(E)-TbutP (1).\n\nThe phosphonamidate ANPs 23 and 24 were not active against various viral strains; only the chlorine analog 24 shown a moderate activity against human coronavirus (EC 50 8.9 mM).\n\nThe compounds were also evaluated against different RNA viruses, but no activity was found.\n\nWe have described herein the synthesis of (E)-but-2-enyl nucleoside phosphonoamidates using the cross-metathesis in water-under ultrasound irradiation. The overall yield obtained from commercial dimethylallylphosphonate is >15%, well above the datas reported in the literature for the preparation of phosphonoamidates (~3%). Two diastereoisomers were formally identified by X-ray diffraction. All those compounds were evaluated against various DNA viruses for their antiviral properties. Among them, the thymine analogue 19 showed to be the best prodrug tested against VZV with an EC 50 \u00bc 0.33e0.39 mM and a selectivity index increased up to !200, compared to its other prodrugs 1e4. This breakthrough approach paves the way for new purine and pyrimidine (E)-but-2enyl phosphonoamidates.\n\nGeneral. Commercially available chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received.

The reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis using silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60F254, E. Merck). Column chromatography was performed on Silica Gel 60 M (0.040e0.063 mm, E. Merck). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance DPX 250 or Bruker Avance 400 Spectrometers using deuterated solvents as internal standard. Chemical shifts are given in ppm and multiplicities are reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), bs (broad signal) and m (multiplet). High Resolution Mass spectra were performed on a Bruker Q-TOF MaXis mass spectrometer by the \"F ed eration de Recherche\" ICOA/CBM (FR2708) platform. LC-MS data was acquired on a Thermo-Fisher UHPLC-MSQ system equipped with an electron spray ionization source (ESI). The temperature of the source was maintained at 350 C. Initially, the cone voltage was set at 35 V and after 5 min was increased to 75V. In full scan mode, data was acquired between 100 and 1000 m/z in the positive mode with a 1.00 S scan time. In addition a UV detection was performed with a Diode array detector at three wavelengths 273, 254 and 290 nm, respectively. A water/methanol (70%/30%) solution mixture with 0.1% formic acid was used as mobile phase. The composition of the mobile phase was increased to 100% methanol with 0.1% formic acid with a 7% ramp. The flow rate was set at 0.300 mL.min-1.\n\nSamples diluted in the mobile phase were injected (3 mL) on a C18\n\ncolumn (X-terra, Waters), 2.1 mm internal diameter, 100 mm length placed into an oven at 40 C. The conversion of compound 11 is equal to 67%. LC-MS analysis of allylphosphonoamidate 11 was optimized in terms of separation and identification. The reaction with crotylthymine was followed by LC-MS in Electron Spray Ionization (ESI), in positive mode. After 20h, three compounds were observed the allylphosphonoamidate 11, ((M \u00fe H)\u00fe,360), its homodimer form ((M \u00fe H)\u00fe,690), and phosphonoamidate ANP 18 product ((M \u00fe H)\u00fe,498). Electronic extraction of ions was performed and the subsequent areas under the corresponding chromatographic peaks determined. The conversion yield was determined as the ratio of the concentration of the allylphosphonoamidate 11 transformed to its initial concentration. \n\nUnder inert atmosphere, allyl bromide (51 mL, 1.25 eq.,0.57 mol) was dissolved in THF (400 mL). To this mixture potassium carbonate (94 g, 1.5 eq., 0.68mol), tert-butylammonium bromide (2.9 g, 2 mol%, 9.1 mmol) and finally dimethylphosphite 7 (41.2 mL, 1 eq., 0.45 mol) were added. The resulting solution was stirred for 36 h at room temperature, followed by the filtration of all solids present in the flask. The filtrate was then evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was then distilled at 130 C under 40 mm/ Hg. After collection of the different fractions, the clean product 8 was obtained as a colorless liquid. (53 g, 75%) . 1 \n\nTo a mixture of dimethylallylphosphonate 8 (4.9 g, 1 eq., 32.5 mmol) and DCM (150 mL), oxalyl chloride (8.6 mL, 3 eq., 97.5 mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred 24 h at reflux, followed by the removal of the volatiles in vacuo to obtain the methyl allylphosphonochloridate. In another flask, a solution of phenol (6.12 g, 2 eq., 65 mmol), triethylamine (8.8 mL, 2 eq., 65 mmol) and DCM (0.2 M) was stirred at room temperature. The phosphonate residue was then dissolved in DCM (0.2 M), and slowly added to this solution, and refluxed during 48h. After evaporation of all volatiles, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography, eluting Petroleum ether/Ethyl acetate 8/2, to afford 9 as a colorless oil. (4.5 g, 65%). 1 \n\nBromotrimethylsilane (8.9 mL, 6 eq.,61.8 mmol) was slowly added to a solution of 9 (2.2 g, 1 eq., 10.3 mmol) in DCM (110 mL). After 24 h at room temperature and evaporation of all volatiles, the crude product was co-evaporated 5 times with methanol (5 \u00c2 15 mL). The residue was then purified by flash column chromatography (DCM/MeOH 95/5) to obtain desired product 10 as an amorphous white solid. (1.85 g, 91%). 1 \n\nUnder inert atmosphere, phenyloxy allylphosphonic acid (10) (1 eq.) was dissolved in DCM. A catalytical amount of DMF (0.3 eq.) was then introduced, followed by the addition of oxalyl chloride (2 eq.). After 30 min. at 0 C and 1.5 h at room temperature, the volatiles were removed, and the residue diluted with 20 mL of DCM to afford solution A. A second solution was prepared with a L-alanine ester chlorhydrate (1.2 eq.), freshly distilled triethylamine (8 eq.) and DCM. To this mixture, the solution A was slowly added at 0 C, and stirred 24 h at room temperature. For 1 g of starting phosphonate, the solution was successively washed with 10 mL of water, 10 mL NaOH 1 M, 10 mL water, 10 mL HCl 10%, 10 mL NaHCO 3 and 10 mL water. After this work-up, the aqueous phase was extracted with 4 \u00c2 10 mL with ethyl acetate, the organic phases were washed with brine (20 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. The residue was purified twice by flash column chromatography to afford the desired allylphosphonoamidates 11, 14 and 15 as diastereomeric mixture. Diastereomers of compound 11 were separated as single diastereomers 12 and 13, respectively.\n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure starting from compound 10 (1 g, 1 eq., 5.05 mmol). The residue was purified twice by flash column chromatography, first eluting PE/EA (7/3) and then pentane/diethyl ether (55/45); the 6:4 diastereomeric mixture of 11 was obtained as a white powder (1.14 g, 63%). Each diastereoisomers were crystallized from a toluene/pentane mixture, as colorless needles, respectively, and their structures were established by X-ray. \n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure 1, starting from compound 10 (1.3 g, 1 eq., 6.56 mmol). The obtained residue was purified twice by flash column chromatography, eluting PE/EA (55:45 to 5:5) to afford a non-separable 6:4 mixture of diastereoisomers 14 as a colorless oil, (960 mg, 52%). 1 (15) Titled compound was obtained following general procedure 1, starting from compound 10 (1.3 g, 1 eq., 6.56 mmol). The obtained residue was purified by flash column chromatography, eluting PE/ EA (65:35) to afford a non-separable 6:4 mixture of two diastereoisomers 15 as a colorless oil. (1.16 g, 57%) . 1 \n\nTo a 2.5% Polyoxyethanyl-a-tocopheryl Sebacate (PTS) solution of water (0.5 M) of phosphonoamidate (1 eq.) and crotylnucleobase (2 eq.), second generation Grubbs catalyst (6 mol%) was added. The reaction was irradiated under ultrasound activation (55 C, 80 KHz) (two additional portions of 6 mol% Grubbs catalyst were respectively added at 2h and 4h). The progress of the reaction was followed by LC/MS and reaction was stopped after 20 h of ultrasouns activation. A maximum of 67% of phosphonoamidate conversion was observed. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was submitted twice to flash chromatography purification, firstly DCM/MeOH 95/5 followed by a second one eluting toluene/acetone 6/4.\n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure, starting from single diastereomer phosphonoamidate 12 (68 mg, 1 eq., 0.19 mmol) and crotylthymine (68 mg, 0.38 mmol, 2 eq.). The \n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure, starting from phosphonoamidate 13 (125 mg, 1 eq., 0.35 mmol) and crotylthymine (125 mg, 2 eq., 0.70 mmol). The obtained residue was purified by twice flash chromatography (DCM/MeOH 95/5 and toluene/acetone 6/4), to afford 20 as a white solid (70 mg, 41%). 1 \n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure, starting from phosphonoamidate 14 (50 mg, 1 eq., 0.18 mmol) and crotylthymine (64 mg, 2 eq., 0.35 mmol). The (22) Titled compound was obtained following general procedure, starting from phosphonoamidate 15 (50 mg, 1 eq., 0.16 mmol) and crotylthymine (58 mg, 2 eq., 0.32 mmol). The \n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure, starting from phosphonoamidate 11 (64 mg, 1 eq., 0.18 mmol) and N1-crotyl-5-fluorouracile (66 mg, 2 eq., 0.36 mmol). The obtained residue was purified by twice flash chromatography (DCM/MeOH 95/5 and toluene/acetone 6/4), to afford 23 as a white solid (32 mg, 36%). 1 \n\nTitled compound was obtained following general procedure 2, starting from phosphonoamidate 13* (50 mg, 1 eq., 0.14 mmol) and N1-crotyl-5-chlorouracile (56 mg, 2 eq., 0.28 mmol). The obtained residue was purified by twice flash chromatography (DCM/MeOH 95/5 and toluene/acetone 6/4), to afford compound 24* as a white \n\nThe antiviral assays, other than the anti-HIV assays, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in HEL [herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Human Coronavirus (229E)], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus and Coxsackie B4), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus) or MDCK [influenza A (H1N1; H3N2) and influenza B] cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, \u2026mM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced CPE or viral plaque (VZV) plaque formation by 50%. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, the cytostatic activity of the test compounds was measured based on inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls.\n\nThe antiviral activity of the compounds was evaluated against HIV-1 in activated primary human PBM cells [42] . Cytotoxicity was evaluated in normal PBM cells, along with CEM and Vero cells [43] ."}
