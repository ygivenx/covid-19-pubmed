{"title": "Rapid NK-cell activation in chicken after infection with infectious bronchitis virus M41", "body": "Infectious bronchitis virus is a coronavirus that is a major cause of economic losses in the poultry industry and can be involved in respiratory disease, nephritis, and poor egg production and quality. As well as being an economically relevant pathogen in poultry, IBV also bears close resemblance to the human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Cavanagh, 2003) .\n\nOne of the most efficient and rapid host response against viruses consists of the production of type I interferons (IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424), an essential part of the antiviral innate immune system (reviewed by Kawai and Akira, 2006) . Many if not most nucleated cells are capable of producing type I IFNs, though differences in the production of IFN-\u2423 or IFN-\u2424 between cells have been described (reviewed by Thiel and Weber, 2008) . Secreted IFNs stimulate adjacent cells to express potent antiviral proteins and stimulate macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to elicit antiviral responses. IFN-\u2425, a type II IFN, is predominantly produced by NK, NKT cells, dendritic cells and Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes once antigen specific immunity develops. IFN-\u2425 increases antigen presentation on macrophages and expression of MHC class I molecules, promotes NK cell activity and leukocyte adhesion and binding required for migration. Thus interferon production triggered by the first contact with the viral intruder slows down the virus multiplication, allowing the host's immune system to respond, and helps to establish an adaptive immune response. In a previous study, we showed that IFN-\u2425 production was not only significantly increased in splenocytes of IBV-infected chickens after in vitro restimulation with IBV, but also in splenocytes of IBV-uninfected chickens after 24 h incubation with IBV-M41 (Ariaans et al., 2009) . Based on these findings, we investigated whether chicken NK cells are activated upon infection with IBV, which might suggest that this cell population might be the possible producers of the IFN-\u2425.\n\nAvian NK cells have been described as a population of cells in the chicken embryonic spleen at a developmental stage where T cells have not yet migrated to the periphery. These cells express surface CD8\u2423\u2423 homodimers, but no T (CD3) or B-cell specific antigens and are able to kill the NK-susceptible cell-line LSCC-RP9 (G\u00f6bel et al., 1994) . In adult chickens, these cells have been reported in the intestinal epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001) . The frequency of avian NK cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and spleen was very low, ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001) . This is in sharp contrast to NK cell frequencies in mammals, which have approximately around 10% NK cells in blood and in spleen. One explanation for this difference in NK cells frequencies between chickens and mammals can be that the current markers used to detect chicken NK cells are based on NK cell populations in embryonic spleen and the gut and do not necessarily recognize all NK cells in blood and spleen of adult chickens. Recently, we identified additional markers that are expressed on splenic NK cells and developed an assay in which surface expression of CD107 (LAMP-1) is analyzed as a measure NK cell activation (Jansen et al., 2010) .\n\nIn this study we investigated if NK cells in lung and blood are activated after IBV-M41 infection using an assay based on degranulation (CD107 assay) to study NK cell activation (Jansen et al., 2010) , and we measured the production of type I IFNs (IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424) and IFN-\u2425 ex vivo at mRNA and at protein level using an IFN-\u2423/\u2424 reporter assay (Schwarz et al., 2004) and an IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT assay (Ariaans et al., 2008a) .\n\nOne-day-old SPF layer chickens were housed in isolators. The chickens were given commercially available food according to the manufacturer's instructions. Drinking water was supplied ad libitum.\n\nAt 5 weeks of age chickens were given 10 5 EID 50 /ml of IBV-M41 via the intratracheal (100 l) and nasal route (100 l). Control chickens were given the same volume PBS. At 1, 2 or 4 days post inoculation (dpi) with IBV-M41, 6 birds per time point were euthanized by cervical dislocation and bleeding. PBS inoculated control birds were euthanized at 4 dpi only. Peripheral blood and lung were collected and leukocytes were isolated as described previously by Jansen et al. (2010) . Briefly, lung tissue was cut into small pieces and digested in RPMI containing collagenase and DNAse for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C and subsequently squeezed through a 70 m mesh to prepare a single cell suspension. PBMC and lung leukocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using FICOLL-Paque (GE Healthcare).\n\nThe IFN\u2425-ELISPOT assay has been described by Ariaans et al. (2008a) , minor modifications are described here. Briefly, MultiScreen TM -IP 96-well plates (Millipore) were treated with 70% ethanol for 1 min, washed and coated with mouse-anti-chIFN-\u2425 (Biosource), blocked and lung leukocytes or PBMC were seeded at 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in triplicate in culture medium (RPMI-1640, 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (P/S)). Cells were incubated with culture medium to measure spontaneous release of IFN-\u2425. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 41 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 . IFN-\u2425 was detected by incubation with biotinylated mouse-anti-ChIFN-\u2425 (Biosource) and poly-HRP streptavidin (Sanquin). The assay was developed using TMB substrate (Sanquin) and analyzed using the A\u00b7EL\u00b7VIS machine and the Eli.Analyse software (Version 4.0) that allows for automated counting of the number of spots based on size and intensity.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit and DNase treated using the RNase-free DNase Set following manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Benelux B.V.).\n\ncDNA was generated with reverse transcription using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad). Real-time qRT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, AB). Detection of IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, and 28 S mRNA was described by Ariaans et al. (2008b) and detection of a product in the 5 -UTR of the IBV genome was described by Callison et al. (2006) . Primers were used at 600 nM and probes at 100 nM concentration. Corrections for variation in RNA preparation and sampling were performed according to Eldaghayes et al. (2006) .\n\nThe CD107 assay has been described previously by Jansen et al. (2010) . Briefly, lung cells were resuspended in IMDM medium supplemented with 2% heat inactivated FCS; 8% heat inactivated chicken serum, P/S and 2 mM glutamax at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 in the presence of 1 l/ml Golgistop (Becton Dickinson) and anti-chCD107 mAb (mouse-anti Lep-100, DSHB). After incubation, cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA, stained with mouse anti-CD3 mAb and mouse anti-CD8\u2423 (Southern Biotechnology) and flowcytometry was performed. Data were analysed using the software program FlowJO (Threestar Inc.).\n\nThe quail fibroblast cell line CEC-32 carrying a luciferase gene controlled by a short fragment of the chicken Mx promoter was kindly provided by Dr. S. H\u00e4rtle (LMU, Munich). Cells were seeded at 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well and after o/n incubation medium was replaced by serially diluted recombinant IFN (Schwarz et al., 2004) , medium control or supernatant from lung leukocytes or PBMC ex vivo cultured in medium only for 24 or 48 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was removed, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. \n\nThe assumption of normally distributed data was met and to determine the statistical significance in CD107 expression between the time points a one way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test was used. The assumption of normally distributed data was not met for the Elispot data and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the statistical differences between time points. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the software program SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., Illinois).\n\nA subpopulation of cells that can be rapidly activated and recruited upon viral invasion are NK cells. In most farm animals, the definition of NK cells is difficult due to the lack of specific markers (Evans and Jaso-Friedmann, 1993; Boysen and Storset, 2009; Gerner et al., 2009) . Chicken NK cells express surface CD8\u2423\u2423 homodimers, but lack surface CD3, T cell receptors, and immunoglobulin (G\u00f6bel et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2012) . More recently it was shown that upon activation, the CD8\u2423\u2423 homodimers were downregulated on the surface of NK cells (Jansen et al., 2010) .\n\nIn this study, SPF birds were inoculated with IBV-M41 by the nasal-tracheal route and lungs and blood was collected at 0, 1, 2, and 4 dpi. The presence of IBV in the lung at different time points post inoculation was confirmed by qRT-PCR. IBV was detected at 1 and 2 dpi and slightly decreased at 4 dpi (Supplement 1).\n\nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10. 1016/ j.vetimm.2012.11.012. To measure whether the NK cells were present and activated, a CD107 assay was performed using lung cells of infected and uninfected control birds. Cytotoxic cells contain cytolytic vesicles with proteins like granzyme and perforin. Lining the membrane of these vesicles is CD107 and upon activation the vesicles degranulate and merge with the surface membrane resulting in relocation of CD107 to the surface membrane (Alter et al., 2004) . Activation of NK cells was measured by determining the surface expression of CD107 combined with staining for CD3 to discriminate between CD3\u2212 NK cells and CD3+ cytotoxic T cells. Upon infection with IBV-M41, CD107 expression was significantly up regulated on CD3\u2212 cells at 1 dpi in the lungs (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that NK cells were activated. Thereafter, NK cell activity in lung was decreased to background level. In contrast, the percentage activated NK cells in PBMC (Fig. 1B) was much higher compared to the lung and showed a biphasic pattern, with a significant increase at 1 dpi, a decrease to background level at 2 dpi similar to the lung, followed by a significant increase at 4 dpi. The high percentage of activated NK cells in blood might indicate a rapid systemic spread of IBV-M41 (Smith et al., 1985) . Transcriptome analysis of pooled tracheas at 3 dpi with an attenuated IBV Massachusetts strain revealed induction of genes involved in cytotoxicity such as Granzyme-A precursor, Fas, CD3 \u2426 and \u2425 chain, MHC II, and TLR2. This expression pattern could be due to cytotoxic T cell responses as suggested by the authors (Wang et al., 2006) , but these molecules are also playing a major role in NK-cell cytotoxicity (Zhang et al., 2012) . Based on our study a contribution of NK cells at 3 dpi seems very likely and confirms the transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, newly entered but not yet antigen-specific CTLs might be present though not yet cytotoxic, whereas the IBV-M41 specific CTLs can be detected after 9 dpi (Liu et al., 2012) .\n\nThe interferon production triggered by the first contact with the viral intruder slows down the virus multiplication, however, many viruses including coronaviruses are capable to cope with and evade the IFN system. Changes in IFN mRNA were measured using qRT-PCR (IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, and IFN-\u2425), and IFN proteins were measured using an IFN-\u2423/\u2424 reporter assay and an IFN-\u2425 Elispot assay. The amount of IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 mRNA in the lung of IBV-M41 infected birds did not change during the first 4 days after infection compared to uninfected control birds ( Fig. 2A) . These findings were confirmed at protein level, no difference in IFN-\u2423/\u2424 activity was detected in the supernatants The number of IFN-\u2425 producing cells per 10 6 cells (mean of triplicate wells per bird +SEM) from uninfected (white) and IBV infected (gray shades) was measured using an Elispot assay (n = 6 per time point). Cells were isolated from lung and blood at 1-4 dpi and incubated with medium only to measure spontaneous release of IFN-\u2425 due to infection. Asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05) between uninfected and IBV infected birds.\n\nof ex vivo lung leukocytes isolated 1-4 days after IBV-M41 infection and cultured without restimulation in vitro for 24 h compared to uninfected birds (Supplement 2). The potential of IBV to induce IFN-\u2423/\u2424 after infection and its sensitivity to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 seems to be IBV strain dependent. IBV-M41 induced low levels of acid stabile IFNs in chick embryo and chick kidney cells (CKCs) and no IFNs after inoculation in embryonated eggs (Otsuki et al., 1979) , whereas for example the tissue culture adapted IBV Beaudette strain induced IFNs in embryonated eggs (Otsuki et al., 1979) . In contrast, Holmes and Darbyshire (1978) showed that IBV-M41 and IBV-Beaudette failed to yield IFN in primary CKC and in tracheal organ cultures using Semliki Forest Virus inhibition assays. In the latter study these strains were not susceptible to the inhibitory effects of IFN, whereas Pei et al. (2001) treated CKC with recombinant ChIFN-\u2423 which inhibited replication of IBV-Beaudette and Gray strain. Repeated in vivo administration of recombinant ChIFN-\u2423 before and after inoculation with IBV-Gray strain reduced the clinical respiratory illness.\n\nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10. 1016/ j.vetimm.2012.11.012. In contrast to IFN-\u2423/\u2424, the amount of IFN-\u2425 mRNA in the lung of IBV-M41 infected birds was significantly increased at 2 and 4 dpi compared to the uninfected birds ( Fig. 2A) . IFN-\u2425 protein production by lung leukocytes also significantly increased at 2 and 4 dpi and coincided with mRNA up regulation (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, highest IFN-\u2425 protein production in PBMC was detected at 1 dpi and decreased thereafter. Infection of human PBMC with SARScoronavirus induced both IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 which peaked within 2 dpi and remained rather stable for 5 days, although individual differences between human subjects were found (Castilletti et al., 2005) .\n\nCoronaviruses are capable to cope with and evade the IFN system. It has been described that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, type 2a and 2b coronoviruses, respectively, can passively escape from getting sensed by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This occurs through formation of double membrane vesicles at perinuclear sites within the cytoplasm where RNA synthesis takes place and actively escape by ORF3b, ORF6, and N protein that are able to inhibit interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3; reviewed by Thiel and Weber, 2008) . Whether evolutionary conserved IFN antagonists are encoded by all coronaviruses, including IBV, remains to be confirmed.\n\nIn future experiments we will investigate whether different IBV pathotypes induce a different activation of the local and systemic NK cells and by performing depletion studies we will investigate if the NK cells are responsible for the rapid secretion of IFN-\u2425."}
