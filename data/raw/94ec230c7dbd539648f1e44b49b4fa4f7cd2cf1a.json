A comparison of the GP73 cDNA sequence with the GenBank The cells were maintained in serum-free media for the first hour of infection. Viral replication, a feature of late expressed sequence tags (EST ) data base showed extensive areas of identity at the cDNA level with the tentative infection, was inhibited by the addition of Ara C human clone 168297 ( THC 168297) that has been localized to BAC WI-6758 on chromosome 9. Compared with the full-length cDNA, the THC lacks crucial 5\u221e coding information. BLAST and FASTA analyses of the GP73 cDNA revealed an additional human EST sequence with significant homology but not identity at the cDNA level (gb AC003976, p=10\u221223). This putative homolog has so far not been characterized. The predicted GP73 protein is predominantly hydrophilic but has a hydrophobic N-terminus, as determined by Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis ( Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) (Fig. 1B) . The N-terminus is predicted to encode a single membrane-spanning domain (underlined in Fig. 1A) , with a potential signal peptidase cleavage site Five potential glycosylation sites are present in the that the retarded migration of these proteins may be C-terminus of the protein (Fig. 1A ,^symbol ) (Hansen due to their unusually acidic nature, which might et al., 1995, 1998) .

We hypothesized that this molecular size shift might be due to the glycosylation of the protein in the 3.2. In vitro transcription-translation of GP73 microsomes.

The identical size to be translocated, glycosylated, and to have signal of the proteins in lanes 3 and 6 argues against the peptides cleaved (Blobel et al., 1985) . Translation in the proteolytic removal of a leader peptide, which would absence of microsomes yielded a predominant protein have resulted in a 2-3 kDa reduction of their apparent band of approximately 53 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3) .

This This indicates that both putative translation start sites treatment will extract vesicle contents (e.g. secreted are being used (see Fig. 1A ). The molecular size of GP73 proteins) and dissociate peripheral membrane proteins, is larger than would be expected from the size of its but will not dissociate integral membrane proteins ORF. A similar electrophoretic behavior has previously (Gilmore and Blobel, 1985) . As shown in lane 5, alkaline been reported for other highly acidic proteins, including presenilin (Daigle and Li, 1993). It has been suggested treatment (pH 11.5) of the microsomes did not remove the GP73 protein, although this treatment did completely remove the control secretory protein, b-lactamase ( lane 1: b-lactamase cDNA translated in the presence of microsomes, molecular weight 29 kDa; lane 2: alkaline treatment of an aliquot of material from lane 1). We conclude that GP73 is an integral membrane protein with a type II topology.\n\nGP73 immunoreactivity in transfected cells was present in tubulo-vesicular structures with a diameter of approximately 2-3 mm and a length of 3-5 mm (Fig. 3A) . A comparison of the GP73 immunoreactivity pattern with the transmission microscopic images of the same cells demonstrated a juxtanuclear distribution (Fig. 3C ) . Occasionally, the stained structures encircled the nucleus without overlapping with the nuclear membrane. This pattern is characteristic of a Golgi distribution in many cultured cells (Louvard et al., 1982) . The signal for GP73 colocalized with that for giantin, a type II Golgi membrane protein that is located in the cis-and medial-Golgi subcompartments (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) ( Fig. 3B) . The localization of was not affected by cycloheximide treatment or by varying the ponasterone A blots: mRNA from 50 normal human tissues was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a cDNA probe directed against GP73 as described in Section 2. The samples are arranged as follows: A1-8 (whole brain, amygdala, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, frontal lobe, hippocampus, medulla oblongata); B1-7 (occipital lobe, putamen, substantia nigra, temporal lobe, thalamus, nucleus acumbens, spinal cord ); C1-8 (heart, aorta, skeletal muscle, colon, bladder, uterus, prostate, stomach); D1-8 (testis, ovary, pancreas, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, salivary gland, mammary gland); E1-8 (kidney, liver, small intestine, spleen, thymus, peripheral leukocyte, lymph node, bone marrow); F1-4 (appendix, lung, trachea, placenta); G1-7 (fetal brain, fetal heart, fetal kidney, fetal liver, fetal spleen, fetal thymus, fetal lung).

Low levels on its cDNA sequence, most likely due to a combination of glycosylation and abnormal migration of this highly were present in testis and spleen. Of note, placenta and liver tissues did not reveal any signal above background. acidic protein. The GP73 signal was markedly upregulated in 293 cells after ponasterone A induction, a In order to analyze the expression pattern of GP73 mRNA in normal human tissues in detail, we probed a finding that confirms the specificity of the GP73 antisera. panel of mRNA samples from 50 normal human tissues (Fig. 5A) . A wide range of mRNA steady-state levels 3.6. Immunohistochemical localization of GP73 protein was observed (Fig. 5B) . Particularly high levels were in human tissues present in the colon, stomach, prostate, and trachea. In contrast, no or minimal expression was present in Immunohistochemical staining of human autopsy tismuscle, lymphoid tissues, and white blood cells. A small sues revealed that GP73 was predominantly expressed but reproducible signal was present in normal liver. A by cells of the epithelial lineage ( Fig. 7) . In the colon, 20-fold difference in expression levels was observed GP73 immunoreactivity was confined to the columnar between tissues with the lowest (skeletal muscle) and epithelial cells of the intestinal glands. The staining was highest (colon) expression. The wide range of mRNA particularly strong in cells located at the surface of the levels suggests that GP73 expression may be regulated glands, which contains the most highly differentiated in a tissue-and/or cell-specific manner. colonocytes (Fig. 7A ). In the lung, a distinct GP73 signal was found in the ciliated columnar epithelium of 3.5. GP73 polyclonal antibodies the bronchioles (Fig. 7B ). In the kidney, a strong signal was present in simple cuboidal epithelial cells of the The rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against recombiproximal and distable tubules and in collecting ducts, nant GP73 specifically recognized a major protein band whereas little or no immunoreactivity was found in the with an estimated molecular size of approximately glomeruli ( Fig. 7C ).

Similar to the in vitro transcriptionwas restricted to the glandular epithelial cells ( Fig. 7D ). translation studies, the apparent size of the GP73 protein In normal liver, GP73 was consistently expressed in was substantially larger than would be expected based biliary epithelial cell ( Fig. 7E) . Expression in hepatocytes was either absent or weak, and was limited to scattered cells in the periportal area. In liver tissues from patients with GCH, GP73 was strongly expressed in hepatocyte-derived syncitial giant cells ( Fig. 7F ). This signal was much stronger than that observed in normal biliary epithelial cells or hepatocytes. Taken together, these studies suggest that GP73 is predominantly expressed by cells of the epithelial lineage, and that GCH is characterized by the upregulation of GP73 expression in diseased hepatocytes.\n\nThe finding of GP73 expression in GCH raised the question whether GP73 expression could be induced in hepatocyte-derived cell lines by virus infection in vitro. In normal liver, GP73 is expressed in biliary epithelial cells (arrow) and in occasional hepatocytes (arrowhead ) ( E ). In GCH, strong staining is present in heptocyte-derived multinucleated syncitia (arrow). that GP73 expression is a feature of early adenovirus 4. Discussion infection. The absence of GP73 protein in adenovirus-GP73 displays the typical features of a type II transinfected cells in the absence of Ara C (despite the membrane protein: a short cytoplasmic N-terminus folpresence of GP73 mRNA) is most likely due to lowed by a single transmembrane domain and a longer, the suppression of cellular protein synthesis in late lumenal C-terminal domain (Munro, 1998) . Our infection. Our data suggest that GP73 expression is an immunocytochemical data demonstrate that GP73 localauthentic feature of the cellular response to adenovirus infection.\n\nizes to the Golgi apparatus, as evidenced by its colocali-coiled coil domain. Golgi proteins with acidic pK A values have been postulated to play a role in calcium sequestration. Coiled coil domains may provide interactions with other proteins in the Golgi lumen, including homo-or hetero-dimerizations ( Farquhar and Hauri, 1997) . The identification of such interacting proteins in future experiments may provide clues about the function of GP73.\n\nGP73 is expressed in most normal human tissues, suggesting that it may have housekeeping functions. However, the striking variability of its mRNA and protein levels in normal human tissues suggests the presence of regulatory controls and, possibly, multiple functions. In support of a cell-specific role of GP73, we found that the protein was preferentially expressed in cells of the epithelial lineage, including colonic, bronchial, renal, prostate, and hepatic biliary epithelial cells. Our data raise a number of questions regarding the etiology of GCH. Based on indirect morphological and serological evidence, a paramyxoviral infection has been zation with the Golgi marker protein giantin (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) . In view of the known distribution of implicated as the etiological agent in many cases of the disease (Phillips et al., 1991 , Fimmel et al., 1998 , but giantin in the cis-and medial-Golgi cisternae, we postulate that GP73 is contained in the same subcompart-no specific viral agent has been identified to date. Many of the morphological alterations of human GCH are ments. Based on our initial sequence information, we considered alternative cellular localizations of GP73. In reminiscent of the changes observed in models of murine coronavirus hepatitis. Morphologically, this infection is particular, the presence of a putative signal peptidase cleavage site adjacent to the transmembrane domain characterized by the disruption of the normal intracellular vesicle targeting process through the interaction of raised the possibility that GP73 might be a secreted protein (Nielsen et al., 1997) . However, our in vitro viral proteins with resident Golgi proteins (Lavi et al., 1996; Opstelten et al., 1996) . Interestingly, mice rendered translation data clearly demonstrate that GP73 becomes alkali-resistant upon incorporation into microsomal immunodeficient by homozygous deficiency of the transcription factor STAT1 develop syncitial GCH upon membranes, a feature that is typical for integral membrane proteins and incompatible with secreted or peri-infection with coronavirus (Durbin et al., 1996) , suggesting that the distinct phenotype of human GCH may be pheral membrane proteins. The possibility that GP73 might be targeted to the plasma membrane was also due to the combination of an impaired immunological response and a viral infection. Based on the similarities considered. However, our immunocytochemical data consistently demonstrated the absence of any plasma between human and murine GCH, we speculate that the Golgi apparatus may be an important target for the membrane staining, suggesting that GP73 is not localized to this membrane. Unlike many of the known Golgi putative viral agent in this disease. Our data provide a rationale for a search for viral proteins that might type II membrane proteins, GP73 is not predicted to have any oligosaccharide-modifying properties, and a interact with GP73 in this disease. Our in vitro data obtained in adenovirus-infected computer-based motif analysis failed to predict any specific enzymatic properties of the molecule (Paulson HepG2 cells demonstrate that the de novo expression of GP73 is a feature of the cellular response to viral and Colley, 1989) . In this regard, GP73 resembles another recently described type II Golgi protein, infection. This response may not be limited to one particular virus, since a partial GP73 cDNA was first GPP130/GIMPc (Linstedt et al., 1997) .
