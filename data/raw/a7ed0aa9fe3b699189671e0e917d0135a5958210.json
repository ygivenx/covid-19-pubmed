{"title": "A COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline Health Care Workers", "body": "Health care workers work in the frontlines across the world unceasingly, running the greatest risk of getting infected and infecting others in their immediate environment -in the hospital, at home -or wherever they go. In the Philippine context, health care system can be described as a twotiered [5] . There is a huge disparity in the capacity between the public and private health sectors [5] . As of 2016, there are a total of 101,688 hospital beds, with a ratio of 23 beds for 10,000 people in the National Capital Region, and more than half (53.4%) of these are in private hospitals [5] .\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing exponentially [6] . Therefore, given that the health system is likely to be overwhelmed [5, 7] , these frontline health care workers (frontliners) are faced with unimaginable risks of getting infected.\n\nEvery doctor, nurse, medical technologist, radiation technologist, nursing assistant, hospital janitor and security guard will inevitably face the risk of COVID-19 infection. Here, we formulate a model to investigate how many frontliners are expected to be infected under certain scenarios [8] . We use this expected number of possible new infections as a measure of the risk.\n\nThe formulated risk model (see Appendix: Methods) aims to examine the risk factors of virus transmission per day, quantify these risks, estimate the number of new infections, and suggest ways to minimize these risks. There are several factors that determine the risk of infection:\n\n\u2022 Average number of COVID-19 patients (or, in other settings, number of susceptible persons) entering a given location at a given time, whether they are confirmed to be positive or not;\n\n\u2022 Average number of encounters with a patient (or, in other settings, any susceptible person) at a given time, whether COVID-19 infected or not, where an encounter is defined to be less than or equal to 30 seconds;\n\n\u2022 Duration of interaction of each of these encounters;\n\n\u2022 Work shift duration of each frontliner (or, in other settings, can be equivalent to the exposure time for any person in public transportation, offices, classrooms, and mass gatherings);\n\n\u2022 Crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location, the presence of compartments or dividers in a room, and how frequent cleaning is done in the environment as the density of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles present on surfaces limits the safe space available; and\n\n\u2022 Level of protection present (e.g., isolation booths, N95 masks, face and eye shields) including level of protection to reduce exposure to aerosolized particles (e.g., for those tasked to do intubation either via direct or via video laryngoscopy, to do nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs).\n\nIn the following discussion, the parameters will be discussed in terms of the frontliner setting, but the parameters can likewise be applied in other settings, such as in crowded places, classrooms, public vehicles, and markets.\n\nThe average number of encounters per hour can be defined as the average number of patients a frontliner has interacted in an hour given that an interaction is less than or equal to 30 seconds.\n\nWe can convert number of patients per minute to number of encounters using the following formula:\n\nFor example, a 10-15 minute interview with a patient is equivalent to 20-30 encounters. A doctor doing brief rounds on 10 patients (where each patient is looked upon in at most 30 seconds) or the situation of having 5 patients per minute are equivalent to 10 encounters.\n\nAccording to our simulation results, the expected number of infected frontliners increases as the average number of encounters between the frontliner and COVID-19 patients increases as well as when work shift duration or exposure time increases ( Figure 1A & 1B) . If there is highly interacting population (e.g., the average number of encounters per hour is 120, which means that the frontliners and the patients are interacting every 30 seconds) or a series of long interactions (e.g., 4 patient interviews per hour where each interview takes 15 minutes), then there is a high chance that one person will be infected. If there is low interaction rate (e.g., seeing one patient only for less than or equal to 30 seconds once per hour), then the chance of getting infected is low but the risk is not zero.\n\nIt should be noted that if the number of possible infected frontliners is greater than or equal to one, then there is high risk of infection; if the number of possible infected frontliners is less than one but not equal to zero, then there is still some level of risk (low or moderate risk of infection). In a 7-hour work shift duration, there is high chance a frontliner will be infected if the interaction rate is around 12 encounters per hour ( Figure 1B ). This can be imagined as a triage nurse seeing 1 patient for at most 30 seconds every 5 minutes during the duration of his or her 7-hour work shift.\n\nThe number of newly infected frontliners is directly proportional to the average number of encounters per hour ( Table 1) . Regardless of work shift duration, a hospital security guard or a triage nurse entertaining 120 persons per hour (1 patient every 30 seconds) is at least 12 times more likely to get infected than a medical or radiation technologist encountering 10 patients per .

A doctor conducting long duration interviews and examinations on patients (20-80 persons per hour) is 2 to 8 times more likely to get infected than for example, a radiation technologist.\n\nRegardless of the type of frontliner, a work shift duration of at least 10 hours is at least 1.25 times more likely to be infected than that of 8 hours. The longer the work shift duration or exposure time, the higher the infection risk (Table 2 ). .

We can also define it as the average proportion of COVID-19 infected entities present within a 2-meter radius (minimum radius for social distancing) from the health care worker. The entity may be an infected patient (confirmed or not confirmed), or any object or surface in the immediate environment that contains SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. There is evidence that the virus particles stay as long as 3 hours as aerosols and 72 hours on plastic surfaces [9] .\n\nLooking at the following figure ( Figure 2 ), crowd density acts as a fraction that modifies the risk of getting infected at all levels of encounter rates, from the laboratory (low encounter rate per hour)\n\nto the triage area (high encounter rate per hour). A crowded place where social distancing is not highly implemented can initiate transmission of the disease. Having more space available for each patient, putting dividers between infected patients, and cleaning the workspaces more often lead to a lower crowd density. A lower crowd density implies that the frontliner is receiving a lesser fraction of the risk of infection. A higher crowd density increases the chance of being infected.\n\n.

For example, a health care worker in a room with crowd density of 10% is at least 95% less likely to be infected than a health care worker in a room with crowd density of 100%. Moreover, as expected, the number of newly infected patients in a room is directly proportional to the infection risk faced by the frontliners (Figure 3) . \n\nProtection level is defined as the fraction of the risk being removed or mitigated by measures done by the health care worker or any other person. It has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. It can be observed in Figure 4 that a 95% or better protection level significantly reduces infection risk. We can assign values which may be additive as shown in Table 3 .\n\nRegardless of the number of COVID-19 patients entering a given location at the same time, regardless of the average number of encounters per hour, and regardless of the work shift duration or exposure time, the protection level removes a substantial fraction of the risk faced by the health care worker (Figure 4 ). In general, having PPEs confers protection towards the health care worker, but certain procedures, especially doing an endotracheal intubation for critically-ill COVID-19 patients, exposes the health care worker to aerosolized particles. Number of new infecteds (secondary cases)\n\nCrowd density = 100%\n\nCrowd density = 50% Crowd density = 25%\n\nCrowd density = 10%\n\n.

For even an hour of exposure, when ten COVID-19 patients enter at the same time in the same place, the risk of getting infected with 70% level of protection is the same as the risk of getting infected when there is no PPE worn in a room with at most three COVID-19 patients. .

The maximum overall risk score is 10 (where The proposed formula is defined as: Table 4 .

The overall risk score can be used to compare practices. Moreover, as the number of days the health care worker is doing his or her regular job related to a COVID-19 task, the risk of infection increases. The number of days can be scaled accordingly as exposure time.\n\nAll in all, based on the simulations, the following recommendations can be made:\n\n\u2022 Decreasing the rate of patient encounters per frontliner, such as having multiple frontline triage nurses, multiple queues, multiple entrances, and proper referral systems, mitigates the risk of infection. Crowd density factor should always be considered. Having many COVID-19 patients in a room can render a protective measure relatively inadequate. It is .

We use the software (Berkeley Madonna for Mac ver.9.1.19). The differential equations are based on an S-E-I compartment model of disease transmission.\n\n.

An S-E-I compartment model of disease transmission.\n\nThe model is described by the following system of differential equations:\n\nwhere S, E, I are the number of susceptible, exposed, and infected persons (in this case, frontliners); F is the force of infection; is the rate of an exposed individual becoming not infected (e.g., through handwashing or other protective measures); and 1 \u2212 is the rate of getting infected.\n\nThe force of infection F is defined as:\n\nwhere is the effective transmission rate, and , is the initial number of infected persons (or \"the inoculum\"), where the effective transmission rate is defined as:\n\nwhere is the transmission risk or probability, and p is the total contact rate.

Instead, we note that p is in terms of the fraction of the initial number of susceptibles ( , ) over the maximum number of susceptibles that a given area can accommodate ( -). ), multiplied by the encounter ratio ( Exposed Infected F \u03b1 1-\u03b1 .
