{"title": "Detection of Ascitic Feline Coronavirus RNA from Cats with Clinically\nSuspected Feline Infectious Peritonitis", "body": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated progressive infectious disease of\ndomestic cats and wild felids caused by infection with feline coronavirus (FCoV), a\nsingle-stranded RNA virus classified as Alphacoronavirus [1, 28]. It is divided\ninto effusive FIP, in which exudate is observed in the body cavity, and non-effusive FIP, in\nwhich multiple pyogranuloma lesions are formed, but differences in lesions are influenced by\nthe immunity of individuals [3]. This disease is\nconsidered to be induced by a mutant of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), FIP virus (FIPV)\n[8, 26]. The\nincidence is generally about 1% in FCoV-infected cats, but it varies depending on the age,\nbreed, environment and superinfection with other viruses [7, 8, 17, 23]. There are 2 genotypes of FCoV, and\nFCoV type II is considered to arise by recombination between FCoV type I and canine\ncoronavirus (CCoV) [9, 27]. Based on serological and genetic investigations, FCoV type I is overwhelmingly\ndominant over FCoV type II, and mixed infection with both types is not rare [6, 11, 14, 15]. Since FIPV\nand FECV cannot be distinguished serologically or genetically, it is generally difficult to\ndiagnose FIP [1], but it has been stated that the\ndemonstration of FCoV RNA in ascites is one of most reliable diagnostic indicators of FIP\n[3, 10].\nSeveral results concerning the state of FIP incidence have been reported overseas [6, 15, 16, 18, 29]. In Japan, there have been several reports on the\nprevalence of FCoV infection [11, 13, 20, 24], but, to our knowledge, no studies on FIP prevalence have been\nreported. Thus, in this study, to investigate the state of FIP incidence in Japan, we examined\nFCoV RNA in ascites of domestic cats suspected of having FIP using RT-PCR and investigated the\ngenotype of detected FCoV RNA.\n\nAscites was obtained from a total of 854 privately owned domestic cats that were clinically\nsuspected of having FIP from veterinary clinics throughout Japan in the period of June 2008 to\nOctober 2012. Viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo,\nJapan). Detection of FCoV RNA was performed using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) with\nthe P205-P211 primer pair providing a 223 bp amplicon of the 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR) gene\nof FCoV [10], according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. FIPV strain 79-1146 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.)\nwas used as a positive reference virus. Furthermore, for samples in which the 3\u2019-UTR gene was\ndetected, genotyping was performed with the nested RT-PCR reported by Addie et\nal. [4], providing 360 and 218 bp amplicons\nof FCoV types I and II, respectively. FIPV strain UCD1 (kindly provided by Azabu University)\nand FIPV strain 79-1146 (same as above) were used as positive reference viruses for the types\nI and II, respectively. Gene positivity was analyzed by chi-square test (StatView, Adept\nScientific, Herts, U.K.), and a P value of <0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\n\nThe 3\u2019-UTR gene was detected in 377 of 854 cats (44.1%). Grouped by breed, the gene\npositivity was significantly higher in purebreds (62.2%; 181 of 291) than in crossbreds\n(34.8%; 196 of 563) (P<0.0001, \u03c72=58.4). Thus, age-related\nchanges in positivity were investigated in purebreds and crossbreds. As shown in Fig. 1, the highest positivity was noted in cats younger than 1 year of age in both breeds and\ndecreased with aging after 1 year of age. The positivity was higher in the purebreds than in\nthe crossbreds until 5 years of age, and a significant difference was noted between the\npurebreds and crossbreds at 1 year of age and younger (P=0.0001,\n\u03c72=14.6 and P=0.0119, \u03c72=6.3, respectively). Then,\nthe positivity was investigated in various purebreds. As shown in Table 1, the positivities in the Norwegian forest cat (92.3%) and Scottish fold (77.6%)\nwere significantly higher than the average for purebreds (62.2%) (P=0.0274,\n\u03c72=4.9 and P=0.0251, \u03c72=5.0, respectively), whereas\nthat in the American shorthair (30.0%) was significantly lower than the average for purebreds\n(P<0.0001, \u03c72=26.3); the positivity in the American shorthair\nwas also lower than that in crossbreds, although the difference was not significant. The\npositivity was low in spring-summer and high in fall-winter, although no significant\ndifferences were observed (38.8, 40.9, 47.3 and 49.5% in spring, summer, fall and winter,\nrespectively). Grouped by gender, the positivity was significantly higher in males (51.5%; 235\nof 456) than in females (35.7%; 142 of 398) (P<0.0001,\n\u03c72=21.7). The positivity was investigated in 10 regions of Japan (Hokkaido, Tohoku,\nShinetsu, Kanto, Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu), but no marked regional\ndifference was noted (data not shown).\n\nFurthermore, the genotype was investigated in 377 specimens positive for the 3\u2019-UTR gene. As\nshown in Table 2, FCoV type I (83.3%) was more predominantly detected than FCoV type II (10.6%)\n(P<0.0001, \u03c72=399.8), and both types were detected in 3.4% of\nspecimens. In 36 specimens, no amplicons were observed; therefore, their genotypes could not\nbe identified. There were no significant differences in the positivity of either type between\nthe purebreds and crossbreds older than 1 year of age. But, at younger than 1 year of age, the\npositivity of FCoV type I was significantly higher in the crossbreds (94.9%) than in the\npurebreds (75.0%) (P=0.0003, \u03c72=13.3), whereas that of FCoV type\nII was significantly higher in the purebreds (23.5%) than in the crossbreds (3.8%)\n(P=0.0002, \u03c72=13.9). Of 40 cats in which FCoV type II was\ndetected, 31 (77.5%) were purebreds younger than 1 year of age.\n\nSince demonstration of FCoV RNA in ascites of FIP-suspected cats using RT-PCR was a useful\nindicator to diagnose FIP [3, 10], the results of this study likely represent the epidemiology of\neffusive FIP in domestic cats in Japan. However, whether or not cats negative for the 3\u2019-UTR\ngene were infected with FCoV was unknown. This status needs to be investigated further, such\nas by antibody test and quantitative RT-PCR.\n\nIn previous surveys, the incidence of FIP was higher in purebreds than in crossbreds, and it\nwas particularly high in specific breeds [16,17,18,19, 29]. Similarly,\nin this study, the positivity of the 3\u2019-UTR gene was significantly higher in purebreds than in\ncrossbreds, particularly in the Norwegian forest cat and Scottish fold, whereas the positivity\nwas lower in the American shorthair. However, in previous reports from the U.S.A. and\nAustralia, the incidence of FIP was high in the Abyssinian, Bengal, Birman, Himalayan, Ragdoll\nand Rex and the Australian mist, British shorthair, Burmese and Rex, respectively, and low in\nthe Burmese, Exotic shorthair, Manx, Persian, Russian blue and Siamese and the Persian,\nrespectively [16, 18]. These breeds are inconsistent with our findings. The breeds that had high and\nlow positivity in this study are consistent with FCoV antibody prevalence in Japan [24]. These findings indicate that countries and regions\nvary in the incidence of FIP by breed, and the prevalence of FCoV in breeding colonies seems\nto be closely related to the incidence, rather than bloodlines.\n\nThe positivity was highest in cats younger than 1 year of age and markedly decreased with\naging. These findings are consistent with the incidence of FIP in previous reports [2, 6, 16, 17, 19, 29]. At younger\nthan 1 year of age, the positivity was significantly higher in purebreds than in crossbreds,\nindicating high prevalence of FCoV in multi-cat households, such as pet shops and breeding\ncatteries [8]. The positivity was also significantly\nhigher in males than in females, as previously reported [6, 16, 17, 29]. However, no gender difference has\ngenerally been noted in the antibody prevalence in previous studies [5, 12, 20, 24], indicating that FIP more\nfrequently develops in males among FCoV-infected cats, although no serological data were shown\nin this study. This may be due to the influences of the stress of fighting and infectious\ndiseases, such as feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus infections, since\nthese viruses more frequently infect males than females [22]. On investigation by season, the positivity tended to increase in fall-winter. A\nsimilar tendency has been reported in the U.S.A. [19],\nsuggesting the seasonality of FIP development. This may be related to weather and the estrus\ncycle.\n\nFCoV type I was far more predominant than FCoV type II, and this is consistent with previous\nserological and genetic surveys [6, 11, 14, 15]. However, most of the FCoV type II cases (77.5%) were\ndetected in purebreds younger than 1 year of age. Most purebred cats were likely to have been\nclosely maintained with dogs in pet shops. Considering the fact that the CCoV infection rate\nis very high in dogs maintained in multi-dog households [21, 25], this finding epidemiologically may\nindicate the possibility that FCoV type II is a recombinant of FCoV type I and CCoV [9, 27], although\nfurther detailed analyses are necessary for clarifying this relationship.\n\nThe above findings may help to clarify the state of FIP incidence in pet cats in Japan. But,\nthe results were from cats with effusive FIP and are not necessarily applicable to the\nnon-effusive FIP. Moreover, genotype-associated differences in the pathogenicity could not be\ninvestigated, because the severity and course of symptoms of the cats from which the test\nspecimens were collected were unclear. It may be necessary to perform epidemiological surveys\nbased on further detailed information and to investigate specimens from cats with non-effusive\nFIP."}
