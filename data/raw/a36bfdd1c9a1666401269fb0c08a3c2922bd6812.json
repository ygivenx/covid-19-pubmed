{"title": "Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China School of Public Health (", "body": "Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.\n\nEpidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed.\n\nNone of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All rights reserved.

Genetic analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7 . Unlike SARS-CoV, transmission of COVID-19 occurs during the prodromal period when those infected are mildly ill, and carry on usual activities, which contributes to the spread of infection 8, 9 . According to the report on \"Diamond Princess\", among the 1,723 tested travelers, 189 asymptomatic individuals were positive for the COVID-19 virus as of 17 February 2020 10 , which indicated that a large number of asymptomatic carriers and mild patients remain undiscovered in the community. It is crucial to identify and isolate asymptomatic carriers and mild patients in order to contain the outbreaks in later stages.\n\nHere, we conducted an epidemiological investigation among close contacts of COVID-19 patients in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China and identified 24 asymptomatic carriers. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics and the transmission potential of asymptomatic infections.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We retrospectively reviewed documents on epidemiological investigation and medical records. Asymptomatic carriers were screened from close contacts both in clinic and in community. Close contacts were defined as: 1) cohabiting family members of the COVID-19 patient or suspected patient; or 2) individuals who were exposed to the COVID-19 patient within 2 meters for more than 1 hour within 2 days before the symptom onset of the patient. Nucleic acid test was performed on the same day when the contacts were tracked. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Second Hospital of Nanjing (approval number 2020-LS-ky003). Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.\n\nUpon admission, detailed contact history of each case was collected, including their travel history in Hubei, the date/time of suspected contact, the symptom onset after contacting with the confirmed patient, and information of other family members.\n\nHistory of smoking and coexisting disorders was also collected.\n\nFor each case, computed tomography (CT) was performed upon admission.\n\nLaboratory assessments include whole blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected on admission day and every other day thereafter for the COVID-19 virus test. All samples were processed simultaneously at the Department of Clinical Laboratory of Second Hospital of Nanjing. The symptoms presented on each case during their hospitalization were recorded in this study, including fever, cough, nasal congestion, dizziness, fatigue, arthralgia, etc. The virus clearance was defined as 2 continuous All rights reserved.

Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical findings of chest CT images of ground-glass or patchy shadows in the lungs ( Figure   S2 ). Five (20.8%) cases showed stripe shadows in lungs, an atypical image finding.\n\nCT scans of the rest 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal images. Four (16.7%) of the 24 cases had lymphopenia (<0.8 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) on admission. Leukopenia was also observed in 4 cases. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer were uncommon (Table S1 ). During hospitalization, Case 2 and Case 5 developed leukopenia. Seven cases presented an elevated level of serum lactose dehydrogenase, among whom 3 were accompanied with an increased level of C-reactive protein (Figure S3 ).\n\nAntiviral therapy was given to 21 cases (87.5%) as initiated therapy, in which, one case also received antibiotics therapy, antifungal therapy plus immunoglobin therapy;\n\nand immunoglobin therapy was also given to 2 cases. All these cases were treated with interferon atomization. None of the cases developed severe pneumonia, requiring systemic corticosteroids treatment, mechanical ventilation, or admission to ICU, and none died ( Table S1 ). As of Feb 18, 2020, a total of 18 cases (75.0%) had the virus cleared (2 continuous negatives of nucleic acid tests), among whom 9 cases were discharged from the hospital while the rest 9 were kept in hospital for further observation. Six cases (Case 3, 8, 13, 16, 19 and 23) had nucleic acid tests reversed to positive after one negative result. Of particular concern, Case18 showed positive again even after the continuous negative of nucleic acid tests. Five cases (Case 7, 9, 11, 14 and 24) had the virus cleared within a short time. The communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, ranged from 1 to 21 days (median: 9.5 days, IQR, All rights reserved.

Due to the censored data of 6 cases and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection, the communicable period was underestimated.\n\nWe found that 7 (29.2%) cases had normal CT images and no symptoms during hospitalization. As compared with other cases, these 7 cases were younger (median, 14.0; P = 0.012) ( Table S2 ). There were no differences in other characteristics between these 2 groups, possibly due to the limited sample size. The blood test of these 7 cases showed no obvious abnormity. The median communicable period of the 7 patients was 4.0 days (IQR, 2.0-15.0).\n\nWe reviewed the medical records and epidemiological history of each case and of their family members if they were admitted in hospital for confirmed or suspected author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619 doi: medRxiv preprint 10 Case 13 had no symptoms but remained positive for the COVID-19 virus till Feb 18, 2020, which indicated that the communicable period could be as long as 29 days (from 21 Jan to 18 Feb, 2020). Among the 3 infected family members, Relative 1 developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU on Feb 6, 2020. Relative 2 and 3 demonstrated clearance of the virus on Feb 18, 2020. In brief, Case 13, an asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers transmitted the virus to his cohabiting family members, and 1 of the infected individuals developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was admitted to ICU.\n\nIn the present study, we provided epidemiological and clinical data of 24 asymptomatic COVID-19 infections identified from the screening of close contacts in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. These asymptomatic cases were mildly ill as compared to those previously reported in Wuhan, Hubei 5, 12, 13 . None of the 24 cases developed severe pneumonia as of Feb18, 2020, and only 5 cases showed typical symptoms during hospitalization. Similar to previous studies 13, 14 , fever, cough and fatigue were the main symptoms. Lymphopenia and leukopenia, previously associated with disease severity 5, 13, 15 , were uncommon in the asymptomatic cases of the present study.\n\nInterestingly, we found that young cases (< 15 years old) were prone to be asymptomatic even during hospitalization and to have a normal CT image, which partially suggested that nucleic acid testing would be crucial to identify asymptomatic infections in young close contacts.\n\nNotably, we provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to close contacts that led to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings indicate that asymptomatic carriers can result in person-to-person transmission and should be considered a source of COVID-19 infection. It is also implicated by the report of the \"Diamond Princess\" that large numbers of asymptomatic or mild patients might have been hiding in the community. Therefore, it is of great public health significance to All rights reserved.

Of particular, since massive movement returning to the work place and the school is in progress, active contact tracing and strict health monitoring should remain an important strategy in China, or worldwide. Guidance of self-protection, active isolation of close contacts (either at home or centralized) should be continuously highlighted. Isolation and multiple virus nucleic acid detections are also recommended for discharged COVID-19 patients.\n\nOur study was conducted in Nanjing, a city with adequate medications and public health interventions. The included cases were identified from systematic screening of the close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) both in clinic and in community. All asymptomatic carriers were admitted to and treated in the Second Hospital of Nanjing, and therefore the study population has strong representativeness of the whole city. We collected the contact history and followed longitudinal nucleic acid tests of the close contacts during their hospitalization, which provided a relatively reliable communicable period of asymptomatic cases. However, it is notable that the real communicable period was longer than was calculated, due to the censored data of 6 patients and the indeterminate date of the exact first infection. This study is limited by the small sample size and lack of data on nucleic acid tests before the diagnosis date. Large-scale multicenter studies are needed to verify our findings.\n\nAll rights reserved.
