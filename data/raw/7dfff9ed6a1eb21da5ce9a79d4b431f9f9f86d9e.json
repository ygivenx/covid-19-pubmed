{"title": "", "body": "H ospital emergency preparedness remains at the forefront of disaster planning after the catastrophic events that marked the past decade. On September 11, 2001 , the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon demonstrated the important role hospitals play in the frontline response to sudden, unexpected incidents. Saint Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan (New York) and Virginia Hospital Center-Arlington activated their emergency operations, becoming vital elements of the organized medical response (Jurkovich, 2003; Kirschenbaum, Keene, O'Neil, Westfal, & Astiz, 2005) . The subsequent anthrax attacks in 2002 demonstrated the need for hospital personnel to know how to safely respond to victims of bioterrorism while maintaining a secure environment for other patients and sta\u00a1. Likewise, the events following the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exposed the necessity of a resilient hospital infrastructure with the sustainability to care for vulnerable populations days following a widespread community disaster.\n\nAmong the most vulnerable populations in the aftermath the 2005 hurricanes were pregnant women and newborns. The unexpected levee system failure in New Orleans following the passage of Hurricane Katrina required that mothers and newborns be sustained in deteriorating conditions without back-up power, limited food and water, and sometimes insecure settings (Giarratano, Orlando, & Savage, 2008) . Through the heroic e\u00a1orts of many, all mothers and newborns were eventually rescued and survived. Yet the evacuation process was riddled with complications and took more than 4 days to fully accomplish (Orlando, Bernard, & Mathews, 2008) . Meanwhile, the surge in mother/ newborn services in receiving hospitals, such as Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge 70 miles northwest of New Orleans, was enormous as they received and stabilized more than 122 infants and high-risk obstetric patients (Spedale, 2006) . These events sparked renewed attention to disaster planning in mother/newborn hospital settings, motivating work that resulted in the 2007 National Working Group for Women and Infant's Needs in Emergencies in the United States (Women and Infants Service Package, 2007) and the State Emergency Planning and Preparedness Recommendations for Maternal and Child Populations in 2008 (Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs) that guide disaster management in acute care and community settings. In addition, a plethora of information on disaster planning from governmental agencies such as the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and varied health care organizations provides a foundation for developing guidelines aimed at The authors and planners for this activity report no conflict of interest or relevant financial relationships. The article includes no discussion of off-label drug or devise use. No commercial support was received for this educational activity.\n\n(Continued) JOGNN I N F O C U S minimizing the impact of disaster or pandemics on women and mother/newborn patients.\n\nWhether caused by natural forces, technological failures, or intentional violence, disasters are destructive events that result in property damage, mass casualties, injuries, or illness that can overwhelm the community and the health care system. Pregnant women and newborns are most a\u00a1ected by environmental and social changes in the community with the disruption of housing, routine medical care, the food and water supply and increased exposure to violence or toxins (Pfei\u00a1er et al., 2008) . Pregnancy and childbirth place women at higher risk for health complications from disasters including obstetrical complications, such as low birth weight and preterm birth (Xiong et al., 2008) .\n\nThe purpose of this article is to review the basic phases of emergency management that include mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery in relation to managing the special needs of hospitalized women and newborns in situations of emergencies or disasters. Additionally, governmental and organizational policies with recommendations or guidelines that regulate hospital and community disaster preparation are described.\n\nFederal, state, and local governments have de\u00a2ned roles and responsibilities in working with nongovernment organizations and the private sector to implement a shared and coordinated approach to disaster management in the United States. The National Response Framework (NRF) provides guidance to all levels of government in operational planning to prepare and respond to disasters (U.S. Department of Homeland Security [DHS], 2008) . Each disaster response is carefully evaluated to identify areas needing improvement. The NRF is based on action plans incorporating key disaster response principles and replaces the National Response Plan (NRP) (DHS, 2004) .\n\nAlthough state and local governments handle most emergency events, federal resources may be deployed in advance of an impending disaster. When local and state resources are overwhelmed, the governor can request assistance from the federal government through the Department of Homeland Security. Local governments rely on state resources such as emergency management, police, transportation, health agencies, and the National Guard.\n\nThe NRF provides a master plan for predisaster collaboration among local government, nongovernment, and private agencies (DHS, 2008) . Hospitals represent only one stakeholder at the local level within the overall health care system needed for disaster preparedness. Pharmacies, home care services, health centers, public health departments, and the overall community must integrate their efforts to build community-wide and regional networks that can respond in a coordinated manner (Knebel & Phillips, 2009) . Figure 1 outlines the organizational chart for disaster management.\n\nThere have been a number of recent Congressional acts aimed at supporting state and local coordination e\u00a1orts among all stakeholders. The passage of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act in 2002 provided funding and guidance to improve local and state hospital preparedness for public health emergencies. This was followed in 2006 with the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA). This act set up the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as the lead agency for coordinating public health and medical emergencies and an assistant secretary for preparedness and response (ASPR) to oversee the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). The HPP funding is administrated through state health departments to promote community emergency preparedness where local hospitals partner with state and community agencies to strengthen local responses. Outcomes of the HPP include benchmark initiatives to improve responses such as the National Hospital Available Beds for Emergencies and Disasters (HAvBED) system which includes a bed-tracking system to better measure response capabilities (Cantrill et al., 2005; Sauer, McCarthy, Knebel, & Brewster, 2009 ). The DHHS is also developing a single national veri\u00a2cation system that will improve coordination of volunteers resulting from integration of the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals and Medical Reserve Corps.\n\nSince 2001,The Joint Commission (TJC), the not-for-pro\u00a2t agency for voluntary accreditation of hospitals, expects the inclusion of comprehensive emergency management using an all-hazards approach. For the \u00a2rst time hospitals were required Emergency preparedness is essential to manage the special needs of hospitalized women and newborns in times of disaster.\n\nOrlando, S., Danna, D., Giarratano, G., Prepas, R. and Johnson, C. B. I N F O C U S CNE to conduct a hazards vulnerability analysis to prioritize and plan responses to incident speci\u00a2c threats that they were likely to face. Hospitals were required to set up an incident command system to be used during an emergency to coordinate the hospital's responses from a central location and authority. In 2008 standards were revised to plan for resilience and assess surge capabilities. Thus hospitals are expected to plan critical resources for at least 96 hours of self-reliance; have plans for management of utilities, safety and security, and communication systems; and prepare sta\u00a1 to focus on teamwork and collaboration in rapidly changing situations (Danna, Bernard, Jones, & Mathews, 2009 \n\nprograms are designing introductory disaster nursing courses based on the competencies to help undergraduate students gain the required knowledge and skills to respond to disasters (Pang, Chan, & Cheng, 2009 ).\n\nThe disaster management process includes four basic phases: mitigation, preparation, response and recovery (TJC, 2005) and is used to address all facets related to a disaster. Minor variations in the labels and number of phases in the disaster management process may be seen in various government and agency documents; however TJC publications re\u00a3ect terminology most commonly used in the National Response Plan (TJC, 2005) . Figure 2 displays the disaster management process used by hospitals in developing and maintaining a state of readiness. Each phase of the process is associated with speci\u00a2c activities along the disaster continuum. The disaster management process can create challenges that are complex and overwhelming where actions in each phase are needed to minimize or decrease the impact of a disaster (WHO & ICN, 2009 ). The process is continuous and involves using what is learned from one disaster to assist in preparing for future events.\n\nMitigation includes ''measures taken to reduce the harmful e\u00a1ects of a disaster by attempting to limit its impact on human health, community function, and economic infrastructure'' (Veevema, 2007, p. 6 ). The goal is to minimize the impact of a disaster or, if possible, prevent the disaster. Mitigation should focus on long-term measures for minimizing or eliminating structural risks such as maintaining compliance with safety and building codes and zoning requirements, ensuring adequate \u00a3ood levee protection, installing \u00a3ame-retardant shingles in a \u00a2re prone area, as well as focusing on potential nonstructural risks such as legislation that addresses insurance coverage for disasters. In a perinatal hospital setting, mitigation includes identifying additional safe space to which mothers and infants can be relocated (i.e., away from windows, lower \u00a3oors in case of evacuation) by nurses who are knowledgeable about this patient population. Nurses play an active role in the planning and design of new perinatal units.\n\nProactive measures during hospital renovation projects, such as installation of hurricane shutters in a renovated Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with a large number of windows, can potentially reduce signi\u00a2cant wind and water damage. Long-term infrastructure planning for adequate back-up power sources to supply electrical needs of obstetrical settings is also critical for operating rooms for emergency Cesarean deliveries, infant respiratory or incubator support, and monitoring of laboring highrisk patients. Alternate water sources should also be considered in sites prone to extreme \u00a3ooding or earthquakes (Mitchell et al., 2009 ).\n\nDuring the mitigation phase hospitals are expected to perform a hazard vulnerability assessment (HVA). An HVA is conducted to identify conditions caused by either physical, cultural, social, or economic factors that can increase the exposure of a community to hazards. An HVA involves examining and forecasting the probability and severity of harm, the impact on the facility and community, and the level of preparedness of the facility to manage the disaster (TJC, 2005) . A prioritization of the hazards identi\u00a2ed in the HVA assessment will enable the hospital to make decisions and develop speci\u00a2c goals and objectives that are in the best interest of the facility. An agency providing obstetrical services needs to have an estimate of the number of childbearing women in the community who may need services. Additionally, the agency should be aware of the social and economic issues that might a\u00a1ect the population and make them more vulnerable to health care complications after a disaster. The mitigation phase is a continual process, and an analysis of hazards should be conducted routinely.\n\nPreparedness refers to the ''proactive planning e\u00a1orts to structure the disaster response prior to Active involvement of perinatal nurses in disaster management is essential to minimize risk to women and newborns. Figure 2 . The disaster management process.\n\nOrlando, S., Danna, D., Giarratano, G., Prepas, R. and Johnson, C. B. (Veevema, 2007, p. 6) . Planning remains the cornerstone for preparing health care responders and institutions to anticipate the needs of the community and plan actions to reduce the impact of disasters on the a\u00a1ected population. Lack of adequate preparedness can create an environment of disorganization and anarchy with the potential of increasing injuries and loss of life (WHO & ICN, 2009 ). For a hospital, an emergency operations plan that is straightforward, comprehensive, simple to implement, and developed in collaboration with government agencies, emergency responders, other health care professionals, and community representatives is an essential component of disaster preparedness (Counts & Prowant, 2001) . The emergency operations plan must address such issues as the chain of command; preparing and training hospital sta\u00a1; activities to reduce the hospital's vulnerability; securing adequate inventory of supplies and equipment; promoting community awareness through collaboration, coordination, and communication methods ; testing the plan by conducting drills and exercises, and evaluating drills and exercises to assess the hospital's preparedness capabilities; thereby identifying areas for improvement. The hospital's emergency operations plan must be coordinated with federal, state, and local agencies to ensure alignment and compliance. A strong example is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Incident Management System (NIMS).\n\nPreparedness begins by understanding the community's risks and vulnerabilities and initiating multilevel planning at national, state, and local levels, including the role of health care institutions. Disaster management focuses on an all-hazards approach whereby mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery address various types of potential disasters\u00e7environmental (i.e., hurricane, tornado, earthquake), hazardous materials (i.e., radiation, toxic chemicals), terrorism and weapons of mass destruction (i.e., bombs, chemical agents), and public health emergencies (i.e., in\u00a3uenza pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) (Lindell & Perry, 2008; TJC, 2005) . This all-hazards approach provides a comprehensive level of preparedness that addresses a full range of emergencies (TJC, 2005) and addresses six critical areas of emergency management that includes communication, resources and assets, safety and security, sta\u00a1 responsibilities, utilities management, and patient clinical and support activities (TJC, 2007) .\n\nEach nurse should begin the disaster preparedness process by developing a personal disaster plan that takes into consideration her or his work obligations that might include reporting to work and remaining onsite for several days. Each nurse needs to identify family options for care of dependent family members and animals in cases of emergency. Those institutions who choose to provide shelter for sta\u00a1s' family members or pets need a plan that considers the additional resources required to provide for safety, food, water, and space. Lessons learned from the Hurricane Katrina disaster indicated advantages and disadvantages to having family members shelter within the hospital complex . Although evacuation of family members from the disaster risk area is usually considered best when natural disasters can be anticipated, a protocol that considers sheltering sta\u00a1's family members in cases when disaster strikes without warning may be warranted.\n\nSta\u00a1 who respond and work in a disaster need targeted education and training that provides them with the knowledge, skills, and competencies to provide quality care to victims in need of services. Sta\u00a1 education must include, but is not limited to, the triage process, hospital-speci\u00a2c policies and procedures relating to care of patients during a disaster, incident command structure, evacuation procedures, transportation methods, and the decontamination process. Table 1 provides examples of external sites for continuing education. Emergency management drills and exercises should be conducted at least twice a year, with one drill focusing on a community-wide exercise (TJC, 2003) . The purposes of conducting emergency management drills are to train sta\u00a1, identify weaknesses, and make corrections and improvements to the emergency operations plan (TJC, 2003) .\n\nThe unit-speci\u00a2c emergency operations plan is expected to be thoroughly articulated during new hire orientation and annually thereafter. This would include information such as the unit's emergency sta\u2044ng plan and what essential items to bring when reporting for work during a disaster. Preparations might include appropriate changes of clothing for work in harsh conditions (heat or cold) and bringing one's own food, water, \u00a3ashlights, batteries, and radio. If the hospital uses a rotating schedule of sta\u00a1 teams assigned to work either during or after a disaster, nurses should know the expectations. Sta\u00a1 must be prepared to be \u00a3exible, patient, and self-reliant, keeping themselves nourished and hydrated (Slepski, 2007) . Sta\u00a1 must know how changing information will be disseminated. A clear channel of communication using websites, e-mail, or hotlines must be planned for sta\u00a1 to know when and where to report.\n\nThe families of hospitalized women and infants need to be included in the communication chain. Written instructions should be developed and shared with each family on the perinatal units and contact information for family members should be updated. Family members should be prepared for what to expect if they choose to remain with the hospitalized mother or infant. Resources are available to assist nurses in developing disaster preparation teaching tools for families (Giarratano et al., in press; March of Dimes, 2006) . The hospital needs to collaborate with civil authorities to develop community public service announcements to instruct childbearing families on where to seek shelter or evacuate and under what conditions to access limited hospital services.\n\nHospital-wide evacuation plans are also a major component of preparedness planning. Evacuation planning identi\u00a2es the conditions under which the facility would evacuate, including deciding on which patients will be \u00a2rst to evacuate and who would receive them. Procedures are needed to disseminate information about evacuation routes and available shelters to those patients and their families being discharged or not requiring medical care. It is essential that hospitals maintain a log documenting essential information about patient evacuation (i.e., evacuation site, time and date of evacuation).\n\nSurge capacity and triage of patients (admission and discharge) are two areas of special focus in hospital preparedness. According to TJC (2003), de\u00a2ning the hospital's surge capacity is one of the most essential parts of an emergency operations plan. Surge capacity is de\u00a2ned as ''the ability to expand capabilities in response to sudden or more prolonged demand'' (TJC, 2003, p. 19) . Hospital surge capacity refers to the sudden and unexpected increase in patients needing services that would severely challenge the capabilities and resources of the institution (Hick, Barbera, & Kelen, 2009) . Disasters have the potential to stress every aspect of the health care delivery system. Consider what would happen if the patient admissions doubled over a few hours. This increase in census may represent surge of patients with multiple needs crossing over many departments, such as seen in an in\u00a3uenza pandemic or can be limited to speci\u00a2c needs such as adult or neonatal critical care beds.\n\nAbility to respond to surge is based on the management of space, available beds, sta\u00a1 and supplies, equipment and medications, and legal capacity to provide care when the hospital's capacity has exceeded its limit (TJC). Hospitals should consider all options in addressing surge capacity potential with a goal to be self-su\u2044cient with ample supplies for at least 96 hours. Strategies to assist hospitals in becoming self-su\u2044cient during surge periods include standardizing equipment, supplies, and medication doses. Critical supplies for obstetrical and newborn care such as peripads, blankets, diapers, pediatric needles, bottles, special formula, and medications need to be identi\u00a2ed and alternate suppliers planned. During a disaster, the usual resources for securing additional incubators, radiant warmers, Orlando, S., Danna, D., Giarratano, G., Prepas, R. and Johnson, C. B.\n\nCNE ventilators, and infusion pumps from outside vendors may not be available.\n\nEstablished agreements with nearby health care facilities for the purpose of transferring patients or obtaining additional critical equipment and supplies should be included as part of the hospital surge capacity plan (TJC, 2006) . There should be prearranged agreements for transport of high-risk mothers and newborns under speci\u00a2ed conditions. Clear communication between referral and receiving hospitals is necessary to determine the level of patient acuity and equipment needs. All e\u00a1orts should be made to keep lactating mothers and their newborn infants together. For high-risk infants, special consideration should be given in planning for the transport and handling of human milk. Hospitals transferring high-risk neonates to a surge hospital should plan to bring equipment as well as sta\u00a1 for each infant. There should be a mechanism to ensure proper identi\u00a2cation of each piece of equipment including hospital name and asset number, whereas the receiving hospital should document receipt of loaned equipment upon admission of the infant. This process assists evacuated hospitals in recovering valuable equipment needed for reopening.\n\nIn times of disaster it is common for people to go to a hospital to seek shelter or safety. This is especially true for pregnant women who see the hospital as a safe haven. During a disaster or emergency situation this would not be the case, however, as room is needed for women requiring medical intervention. Surge capacity in obstetrical areas mandates preplanning and evaluating space that can be reserved for normal labor and births, for complications of pregnancy, surgery space, and for isolation of patients for birth and care in case of an in\u00a3uenza outbreak. Large rooms such as recovery rooms, waiting rooms, clinic space, and conference rooms can be converted to patient care areas. Elective surgeries and inductions are immediately cancelled, leaving only essential services. Discharge of patients who are ready or near ready for discharge is also an important strategy to address surge. Criteria for early and immediate discharge of patients can be used to guide decisions. Early discharge of postpartal women and normal newborns can be carried out using assessment criteria, assuming there is a safe place for discharge, such as an appropriate shelter if home is not an option. Initiation of breastfeeding would be one key factor in determining discharge readiness, because bottle feeding may not be sustainable.\n\nSurge capacity planning is part of the daily routine in many obstetrical and NICUs. In hospitals with a busy high-risk antepartum service, delivery of several high-risk women with multiple fetuses within a short period of time can result in a sudden increase in the labor and delivery and NICU census that may exceed the normal unit capacity. A proactive approach is required to secure the necessary equipment and sta\u00a1 before the expected deliveries, especially when the unit census is already at capacity. Obstetrical and neonatal nurse managers can use a similar on-call system when planning for an expected increase in unit census following a disaster. The same principles used in management of sudden census spikes can be modi\u00a2ed and applied to disaster planning.\n\nSurge capacity planning for the high-risk neonatal population requires critical evaluation of all available alternate physical spaces outside the NICU. Patient acuity and level of care determine the physical environment and equipment needs for each infant. National design standards specify the minimum number of square feet per bedspace and requirements for electrical, oxygen, air and vacuum outlets, as well as evacuation routes and exits in the NICU (White, 2007) . However, few hospitals can meet these standards when forced to use an alternate location within the main facility. When a decision is made to shelter in place, it may be necessary to relocate NICU patients to another area of the hospital. Oxygen, air, and vacuum outlets are critical needs in an alternate physical space. Postanesthesia care units can often be used as an alternate space for relocating the NICU population or planning for neonatal admissions from a hospital under evacuation.\n\nThe National Response Plan de\u00a2nes response as ''those activities that address the short-term, direct e\u00a1ects of an incident. These activities include immediate actions to preserve life, property, and the environment; meet basic human needs ; and maintain the social, economic, and political structure of the a\u00a1ected community'' (DHS, 2004, pp. 53^54) . The National Response Framework describes how to implement response activities at all levels of Perinatal nurses need education and training to apply disaster management principles that guide care of hospitalized women and newborns during extreme conditions. government (DHS, 2008) . Hospitals are expected to implement the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS). HICS is the standard for health care disaster response and is a response infrastructure under the NIMS. The HICS provides the organization with a predictable chain of command, as well as a de\u00a2ned scope of supervision and job duties, and allows for \u00a3exible and rapid response to events before, during and after the event. HICS utilizes \u00a2ve functional areas (command, operations, planning, logistics, and \u00a2nance-administration).\n\nIt is during this response phase that collaboration and communication is critical between local, state, and national levels for an e\u00a1ective disaster response to occur. During this phase the urgent needs of survivors are met. Nurses must have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently assess, triage, and monitor survivors for physical and mental health issues, and provide appropriate care in an environment with limited resources (WHO & ICN, 2009 ). Evacuation of the hospital and relocation of patients, visitors, and sta\u00a1 usually occurs during the response phase of the disaster. Nurses should be trained on evacuation procedures such as developing a process for infallible identi\u00a2cation of infants, identifying evacuation sites for mothers and infants, identifying proper evacuation equipment (i.e., vests), and establishing back-up or alternate evacuation routes (Schultz, Pouletsos, & Combs, 2008) . At one hospital after Hurricane Katrina, well newborn babies and their mothers had to be evacuated by boats to access ambulances several miles away. Family members should be kept together whenever possible to provide support to each other. If it becomes necessary to separate mothers from sick babies or family, there should be a system in place to assist in reconnecting families as soon as possible.\n\nLarge-scale disasters that overwhelm the system also disrupt the usual standards and expectations that guide health care delivery. Situations resulting in scarce equipment and supplies, limited sta\u00a1 and support services (dietary, laundry, sterilization, pharmacy), and infrastructure losses (electricity, water, plumbing, sanitation) will change nursing care delivery. Priorities shift to providing only essential care. During the time of disaster, the expected goal of providing the best, complete nursing care based on the individualized needs of the patient may change to a utilitarian framework of care in which the objective is to provide the greatest good for the greatest number of individuals. When this shift is called for by an incident command structure in the institution, there needs to be guidance on what conditions of care will change. TJC requires that hospitals predetermine what routine activities would be delayed or omitted, such as vital signs, baths, extensive charting, and nonessential medications (TJC, 2006 \n\nAmong the most challenging issues for nurses is disaster triage whereby decisions are made on who Orlando, S., Danna, D., Giarratano, G., Prepas, R. and Johnson, C. B. I N F O C U S CNE will receive care based on the likelihood of survival, commonly referred to as \u00a2eld triage. Triage is a skill that combines an assessment of the status and prognosis of the patient with knowledge of the medical resources available for treatment. Advanced practice nurses including nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse practitioners with expertise in advanced assessment of mothers and infants can \u00a2ll critical disaster response roles in triage, transfer, and discharge (Cole, 2005) . A shift to a utilitarian ethical framework necessitates that scarce resources be used to provide immediate care for those most likely to recover without extraordinary means. This also includes deciding which patients have priority for transfer from the disaster area to a full-care facility. These decisions are best made by a designated triage o\u2044cer or those trained to use established criteria or algorithms to categorize, score, or rank patients based on who will bene\u00a2t most from immediate emergency care (Qureshi & Veenema, 2007) . Table 2 lists an example of triage criteria commonly used in disaster situations. Patients are categorized based on type and severity of illness or injury, and assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, vital signs, level of consciousness, and by visual inspection. Although nurses working on hospital units may not be directly involved in the triage process, they care for patients based on triage decisions, providing speci\u00a2c interventions to support those who are likely to recover, and palliative care to those not expected to survive. Nurses need to understand the triage decisions made and be prepared to care for patients in this complex situation, using competencies that support worker and patient safety and the basics of airway, breathing, circulation, control of blood loss, and infection control (Gebbie, Peterson, Subbarao, & White, 2009) .\n\nIt is essential that the in-patient birth center and neonatal units develop a triage plan for all mothers and neonates entering the units for care following a disaster or during a pandemic. This plan should include the resources of the obstetrical unit and the special needs of pregnant women and newborns (Woodson, 2009 ). The triage process will serve as a critical tool to assess the pregnant patients that present at the obstetrical units and to prioritize their most immediate concerns. Criteria for prioritizing obstetrical patients that require hospitalization versus those who can be discharged home or to community shelters should be preestablished and ready for use by sta\u00a1.\n\nAssessment of resources required for essential care for pregnant women include considering needs of laboring patients (uncomplicated and previous Cesarean delivery), breech presentations or fetal distress in labor requiring operative interventions, prolonged rupture of membranes, multiple births, diabetics, severe pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and placenta previa or abruption. Availability of resources is an important element in applying disaster-level triage in care of obstetrical patients. For example, if blood products are scarce, the supply might be reserved for emergency use in laboring patients and not released for use on a woman experiencing acute HELLP syndrome, with multiple health complications.\n\nResources in the NICU, as well, might be channeled to the neonates with the greatest chance of survival. Extremely low-birth-weight neonates in need of ventilator support would have little chance of survival without continuous care and resources. The degree of prematurity may be one consideration in triage of high-risk neonates. However, full-term neonates may have life-threatening multisystem medical or surgical conditions that may not be treatable during a disaster with limited resources. Education and understanding of disaster triage as it relates to mothers and high-risk newborns are essential for nurses because decisions and subsequent actions taken during a disaster may be considerably di\u00a1erent from care provided under ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe recovery phase can be considered a shortterm and long-term activity. The National Response Framework describes recovery as ''the actions taken to help individuals, communities, and the Nation return to normal'' (DHS, 2008, p. 45) . After a disaster, recovery focuses on setting up temporary housing, providing medical care, supplying the public with current information and health and safety education, and implementing counseling programs. Hospitals that reopen postdisaster need to anticipate women and their newborn infants using medical emergency services for routine care due to disrupted clinics and pediatric services in the community. Mental health clinics may need to be expanded to address long-term stress in the community. Hospital-based social services will need referrals for women who lack housing, food and infant supplies, or are in need of day care services. The long-term goal of the recovery phase is to restore the a\u00a1ected area to its previous state as much as possible. This phase involves rebuilding, reemployment, and repairing the infrastructure. It is crucial that coordination and collaboration with the community occurs. During this phase, a postdisaster evaluation should be conducted within the organization to identify areas for improvement.\n\nA series of major disasters in the past 10 years has highlighted the need for nurses and other health care workers in hospitals and other health care settings to know and understand their role in the disaster management process. Nurses have a vital role in participating in all phases of the disaster process at the federal, state, and local level. Hospitals have an obligation to maintain a state of readiness for unexpected or expected extreme emergencies. Optimal hospital emergency planning requires input from expert nurses with knowledge and experience with speci\u00a2c patient populations such as new mothers and high-risk infants. Disaster education and practice drills are essential for all hospital care providers. When disaster strikes and resources are limited, nurses have a duty to provide care using their skills, knowledge, and best professional judgment.\n\n6.
