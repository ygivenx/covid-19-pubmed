{"title": "CORRESPONDENCE Imported cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome: An update KEYWORDS", "body": "In a recent paper published in Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, Al-Tawfiq and colleagues state with reason that despite a great concern regarding the potential for the Hajj to cause a global epidemic of Middle East Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV); only a limited number of travelassociated cases were reported with no major event related to the Hajj [1] . Screening for MERS-CoV carriage was conducted among cohorts of Hajj pilgrims in 2012 and 2013 and resulted negative [2e4] . Up to 1 November 2014, 21 cases of travel-associated MERS have been reported from various sources including ProMED (http://www. promedmail.org/), WHO (http://www.who.int/csr/ outbreaknetwork/en/), ECDC (http://www.ecdc.europa. eu/en/Pages/home.aspx) and USCDC (http://www.cdc. gov/) updates, some of which were also reported in the medical literature as summarized recently by Pavli and colleagues [5] .\n\nIn Table 1 , we are describing the MERS cases identified out of the Middle Eastern countries among individuals who traveled to and/or from the Middle Eastern countries. All cases but two were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction on at least two specific genomic targets. The majority of cases were in Europe (10 cases), North Africa (5 cases) and Asia (4) . Two cases were imported to the US. Likely place of exposure was in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in the majority of cases. Three patients were Middle East nationals transferred to European hospitals for medical care.\n\nSeven cases were among expatriates living in the Middle East and traveling back to their country of origin, including one patient living in Qatar who participated to the Umrah in KSA (a shorter pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undergone at any time). Ten cases were among short-term travelers with a mean time of stay in the Middle East of 18 days (range 3 he40 days). Among short-travelers, 7 participated to the Umrah, one traveled for holidays, one was in transit in Abu Dhabi airport and the information is missing in one case. Nine patients died, nine recovered, one was asymptomatic and the information missing in two cases. Possible source of infection was identified in some patients including exposure to camels or their products (four cases) or bats (one case), exposure to MERS patients (six cases of which three were health care workers) and visit to Saudi hospitals (two cases).\n\nFrom this figure, it is notable that 8 out of 21 travelassociated cases were in patients who participated to the Umrah (38%), a proportion which culminate to 70% among short-term travelers. Among the 8 patients participating to the Umrah, two were exposed to MERS patients, one was hospitalized in Saudi Arabia prior contracting MERS and one drank camel milk in KSA. No risk factor was identified in two patients and the information was missing in two cases.\n\nThese 8 Umrah-associated MERS cases over an estimated 20 million pilgrims who visited Mecca from 2012 through 2014 are not significant in terms of public health. The high prevalence of participation to Umrah among the few travelassociated MERS cases in short-term travelers likely reflects the fact that tourism in the region is significantly dependent on religious tourism. According to the Saudi Tourism and Antiquities Committee (SCTA) data, of the 17 million international tourists who visited Saudi Arabia in 2013, 6.9 million (40.6%) did so for religious reasons. From a clinical perspective, physicians should have a high degree of suspicion for MERS in patients with severe respiratory symptoms following pilgrimage to Mecca; however, surveillance data in England and France showed that a diagnostic of influenza was most likely in such travelers [3, 6, 7] .\n\nNone.
