{"title": "New Isoxazolidine-Conjugates of Quinazolinones\u2014Synthesis, Antiviral and Cytostatic Activity", "body": "Nitrogen-containing heterocycles form the core of natural products (e.g., alkaloids) and they are also present in many pharmacophores as well as in numerous marketed drugs. Among them, quinazolines and quinazolinones have drawn special attention due to the broad spectrum of biological activities of their derivatives, including sedative [1,2,3], anticancer [4,5,6,7], antiviral [8,9,10,11,12], antibacterial [13,14,15], antifungal [15,16], anti-inflamatory [15,17,18,19] and antifibrotic [20,21] activities. Several reviews focused on the synthetic strategies and biological activities of these compounds have been published [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. The significant impact of various functional groups installed into quinazoline/quinazolinone frameworks on pharmacological properties have been proven.\n\nIn the last decades several compounds containing the quinazolin-4-one framework, which exhibited promising anticancer as well as antiviral properties, have been obtained (Figure 1). Furthermore, some biologically active substituted quinazolin-4(3H)-ones were isolated from various fungi and bacteria species. For example, 2-(4-hydroxybenzyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1) was found in an entomopathogenic fungus Isaria farinosa and its strong inhibitory properties on the replication of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [30] were recognised, whereas its 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) analogue 2 present in fungus from Penicillium genus appeared only slightly active toward TMV [30]. Moreover, compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxicity toward various cancer cell lines [31,32]. Quinazolinone 3 isolated from Streptomyces sp. appeared cytotoxic against Vero cells [33]. Very recently synthetic pyridine-containing analogue 4 and its 3-substituted derivatives 5 and 6 have been obtained and their slight activity against influenza A virus was revealed [34]. On the other hand, various 2,3-disubstitued quinazolin-4(3H)-ones, including compounds 7\u201310, have been found to possess antitumor activity [35].\n\nIn continuation of our studies on antiviral and cytostatic activity of isoxazolidine analogues of C-nucleoside analogues, we designed a new series of compounds of the general formula 11 containing a substituted quinazolinone moiety as a false nucleobase at C5 in the isoxazolidine ring and the diethoxyphosphoryl function attached at C3. Our synthetic strategy to compounds trans-11/cis-11 relies on the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of N-methyl-C-(diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrone 12 [36] with 2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-ones 13 substituted at N3 (Scheme 1).\n\n2-Vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-ones 13 modified at N3 with substituted benzyl groups were synthesized from commercially available 2-aminobenzamide (14) by acylation with 3-chloro-propionyl chloride followed by cyclization and dehydrohalogenation to prepare 2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (13a) as a key intermediate [37] and a subsequent reaction with substituted benzyl bromides 13b\u2013i [38] (Scheme 2). Moreover, compounds 13j (R = Me) and 13k (R = Et) were also obtained with intention to determine the influence of the benzyl substituent on biological activity of the designed isoxazolidines trans-11/cis-11. In the 1H-NMR spectra of compounds 13a\u2013k characteristic signals for vinyl protons were observed in the 6.94\u20135.59 ppm (three doublets of doublets).\n\nThe 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a nitrone 12 with 2-vinylquinazolinones 13a\u2013k led to the formation of diastereoisomeric mixtures of 5-substituted (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines trans-11 and cis-11 with good (80%\u201388%) diastereoselectivities (Scheme 3, Table 1). Ratios of cis/trans diastereoisomers were calculated from 31P-NMR spectra of crude reaction mixtures and confirmed by the analysis of 1H-NMR spectral data. Crude mixtures of isoxazolidine cycloadducts were then subjected to purification on silica gel columns. However, attempts to isolate pure diastereoisomers were fruitful for trans-11a (R = H), trans-11c (R = 2-NO2-C6H4-CH2), trans-11g (R = 3-F-C6H4-CH2), trans-11h (R = 4-F-C6H4-CH2) and trans-11j (R = Me) only.\n\nThe relative configurations of isoxazolidines trans-11a and cis-11a were established based on our previous studies on stereochemistry of cycloaddition of N-methyl-C-(diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrone (12) with various vinyl aryls [39,40] since similar 1H-NMR spectral patters for the respective series of trans- and cis-isoxazolidines were observed. Since for compound trans-11a all necessary coupling constants were successfully extracted from the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra, detailed conformational analysis was performed based on these data {J(H3-H4\u03b1) = 9.3 Hz [41], J(H3-H4\u03b2) = 8.3 Hz, J(H4\u03b1-P) = 9.9 Hz [42,43], J(H4\u03b2-P) = 16.9 Hz, J(H4\u03b1-H5) = 6.2 Hz, J(H4\u03b2-H5) = 8.3 Hz, J(CCCP) = 8.5 Hz [44,45]} and revealed that isoxazolidine ring in trans-11a adopts a 3E conformation in which the diethoxyphosphoryl group resides in the equatorial position of the isoxazolidine ring while a quinazolinone substituent is located pseudoequatorially (Figure 2). On the other hand, cis configuration of the minor isomer was established from the corresponding couplings [J(H3-H4\u03b1) = 9.0 Hz, J(H3-H4\u03b2) = 6.5 Hz, J(H4\u03b1-P) = 11.2 Hz, J(H4\u03b2-P) = 20.0 Hz, J(H4\u03b1-H5) = 9.1 Hz, J(H4\u03b2-H5) = 3.9 Hz, J(CCCP) = 7.3 Hz] indicating the 2E conformation of the isoxazolidine ring (Figure 2). The additional arguments to support our assignments follow from shielding of the CH3CH2OP protons observed for the cis isomer (\u0394\u03b4 ca. 0.1 ppm) when compared with the trans-11a. Furthermore, it was found that on a 1H-NMR spectrum taken on the 83:17 mixture of cis- and trans-11a, the H-N proton in the quinazolinone ring of cis-11a was significantly deshielded (\u0394\u03b4 = 0.7 ppm) when compared with the trans isomer, highly likely, as a result of the hydrogen bond formation with the phosphoryl oxygen amide, a phenomenon spatially achievable in the cis isomer only.\n\nSince introduction of various substituents at N3 of quinazolinone moiety has no influence on the stereochemical outcome of the cycloaddition therefore configuration of the all major isoxazolidines 11 were assigned as trans, thereby minor ones as cis.\n\nAll obtained phosphonates trans-11a, trans-11c, trans-11g, trans-11h and trans-11j as well as mixtures of diastereoisomeric phosphonates trans-11b/cis-11b (90:10), trans-11d/cis-11d (90:10), trans-11e/cis-11e (90:10), trans-11f/cis-11f (90:10), trans-11i/cis-11i (97:3) and trans-11k/cis-11k (97:3) were evaluated for inhibitory activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses, using the following cell-based assays: (a) human embryonic lung (HEL) cells: herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G), thymidine kinase deficient (acyclovir resistant) herpes simplex virus-1 (TK\u2212 KOS ACVr), vaccinia virus, adeno virus-2, vesicular stomatitis virus, cytomegalovirus (AD-169 strain -1 and Davis strain), varicella-zoster virus (TK+ VZV Oka strain and TK\u2212 VZV 07-1 strain); (b) HeLa cell cultures: vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4 and respiratory syncytial virus; (c) Vero cell cultures: para-influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, yellow fever virus; (e) CRFK cell cultures: feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus (FHV) and (d) MDCK cell cultures: influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) and influenza B virus. Ganciclovir, cidofovir, acyclovir, brivudin, zalcitabine, zanamivir, alovudine, amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, dextran sulfate (molecular weight 10,000, DS-10000), mycophenolic acid, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50: the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaque formation (VZV) by 50% or to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (other viruses).\n\nSeveral isoxazolidines trans-11/cis-11 were able to weakly inhibit the replication of TK+ and TK\u2212 VZV strains with EC50 values in the range of 6.84\u2013100 \u03bcM (Table 2). Among them, phosphonates trans-11f/cis-11f (90:10) (R = 2-F-C6H4-CH2) (EC50 = 6.84 \u03bcM), trans-11h (R = 4-F-C6H4-CH2) (EC50 = 15.29 \u03bcM), trans-11i/cis-11i (97:3) (R = 2,4-diF-C6H3-CH2) (EC50 = 9.44 \u03bcM) were the most active toward TK+ VZV Oka strain, while exhibiting no activity toward TK\u2212 VZV strain. The activity of these isoxazolidines trans-11/cis-11 against TK+ VZV Oka strain was 8- to 22-folds lower than that of the reference drug acyclovir.\n\nOn the other hand, the EC50 values for the TK\u2212 VZV 07-1 strain (which is an acyclovir resistant strain) of the phosphonates trans-11e/cis-11e (90:10) (R = 4-NO2-C6H4-CH2) (EC50 = 42.87 \u03bcM) and trans-11k/cis-11k (97:3) (R = Et) (EC50 = 41.57 \u03bcM) were comparable to that of acyclovir (EC50 = 39.69 \u03bcM). These derivatives showed similar EC50\u2019s for TK+ and TK\u2212 VZV strains and therefore their potency against TK+ VZV was approximately 50-fold lower compared to acyclovir.\n\nFurthermore, compounds trans-11b/cis-11b (90:10) (R = C6H5-CH2), trans-11c (R = 2-NO2-C6H4-CH2), trans-11e/cis-11e (90:10) (R = 4-NO2-C6H4-CH2) and trans-11g (R = 3-F-C6H4-CH2) showed some activity against human cytomegalovirus (EC50 = 27\u201345 \u03bcM), although they were less active than ganciclovir and cidofovir used as the reference compounds (Table 3). None of the phosphonate derivatives here described showed activity against the other tested DNA and RNA viruses.\n\nThe 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC50) causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation was determined against murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM, human cervix carcinoma HeLa and immortalized human dermal microvacsular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Isoxazolidines trans-11a (R = H) and trans-11j (R = Me) did not inhibit cell proliferation at the highest tested concentration (i.e., 250 \u03bcM), whereas trans-11k/cis-11k (97:3) (R = Et) appeared slightly cytostatic towards the tested cell lines (IC50 = 85\u2013101 \u03bcM). On the other hand (Table 4, entries b to i), compounds having benzyl substituents at N3 in the quinazolinone moiety showed lower IC50 values (IC50 = 21\u2013102 \u03bcM) thereby indicating that installation of functionalized benzyl groups was profitable for inhibitory properties.\n\n1H-NMR spectra were taken in CDCl3 on the following spectrometers: Gemini 2000BB (200 MHz Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and Avance III (600 MHz, Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany) with TMS as internal standard. 13C-NMR spectra were recorded for CDCl3 solution on the Bruker Avance III at 151.0 MHz. 31P-NMR spectra were performed in CDCl3 solution on the Varian Gemini 2000 BB at 81.0 MHz or on Bruker Avance III at 243.0 MHz. IR spectra were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer (ATI Instruments North America-Mattson, Madison, WI, USA). Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus (VEB Kombinat NAGEMA, Dresden, Germany) and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalytical Laboratory of this Faculty on Perkin-Elmer PE 2400 CHNS analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT, USA). The following adsorbents were used: column chromatography, Merck silica gel 60 (70\u2013230 mesh); analytical TLC, Merck (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) TLC plastic sheets silica gel 60 F254. N-methyl-C-(diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrone (12) [36], 2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (13a) [37] and 3-methyl-2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (13j) [38] were obtained according to the literature procedures.\n\n1H-, 13C- and 31P-NMR spectra of all new synthesised compounds are provided in Supplementary Materials (Figures S1\u2013S54).\n\nTo the solution of 2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one (13a, 1.00 mmol) in acetonitrile (15 mL) potassium carbonate (3.00 mmol) was added. After 15 min the respective benzyl bromide (1.10 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred under reflux for 4 h. A solvent was removed and the residue was extracted with water (3 \u00d7 10 mL). An organic layer was dried (MgSO4), concentrated and the crude product was purified on a silica gel column with a methylene chloride: hexane mixture (7:3, v/v) followed by crystallisation (chloroform-petroleum ether) to give pure quinazolinones 13b\u2013e and 13g\u2013i.\n\n3-Benzyl-2-vinylquinazolin-4(3H)-one (13b).

The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. Cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.\n\nMurine leukemia (L1210), human T-lymphocyte (CEM), human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) and immortalized human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were suspended at 300,000\u2013500,000 cells/mL of culture medium, and 100 \u03bcL of a cell suspension was added to 100 \u03bcL of an appropriate dilution of the test compounds in 200 \u03bcL-wells of 96-well microtiter plates. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for two (L1210), three (CEM) or four (HeLa) days, the cell number was determined using a Coulter counter. The IC50 was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nA series of isoxazolidine-containing quinazolinones trans-11 and cis-11 have been synthesised from N-methyl-C-diethoxyphosphorylnitrone (12) and the respective N3-substituted 2-vinyl-quinazolin-ones 13 via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The obtained isoxazolidine phosphonates trans-11 or the respective mixtures of trans-11/cis-11 were evaluated against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Among all tested compounds, isoxazolidines trans-11f/cis-11f (90:10), trans-11h and trans-11i/cis-11i were slightly active toward TK+VZV strain (EC50 = 6.84, 15.29 and 9.44 \u03bcM) without exhibiting cytotoxicity toward uninfected cells at concentration up to 100 \u03bcM. On the other hand, phosphonates trans-11b/cis-11b (90:10), trans-11c, trans-11e/cis-11e (90:10) and trans-11g showed weak antiviral properties against cytomegalovirus (EC50 = 27\u201345 \u03bcM).\n\nCompounds equipped with benzyl substituents at N3 in the quinazolinone skeleton exhibited some antiproliferative activity toward the tested immortalized cells (IC50 = 21\u2013102 \u03bcM), while analogues lacking substituent or having alkyl group at N3 were inactive. These results encourage us to continue the search for more active compounds with special focus on modification the quinazoline-4-one unit especially at N3."}
