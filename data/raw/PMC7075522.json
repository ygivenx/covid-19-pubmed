{"title": "Immunodominant SARS Coronavirus Epitopes in Humans\nElicited both Enhancing and Neutralizing Effects on Infection in Non-human\nPrimates", "body": "First, we observed\nthe ADE of SARS-CoV infection in lungs after immunization with the\ninactivated virus vaccine in macaques. The monkeys with or without\nthe immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine were infected by\nnasal cavity inoculation of live SARS-CoV virions (Figure 1). Infected macaques showed\nlungs with broadened interval and visible macrophage infiltration\nwith alveolar epithelial hyperplasia. However, ADE macaques after\nvaccination showed lungs with broadened interval, lung interval fractured\nwith large amounts of macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, visible\nfibrin, and protein-rich edema in the alveolar cavity. Protected macaques\nshowed lungs with slightly broadened intervals without visible abnormalities.\nThe results implied that the simple vaccination with inactivated whole\nSARS-CoV virions might be ineffective for protection of virus infection.\n\nMapping highly immunoreactive human B-cell peptides\nby employing SARS patient antisera was carried out by a number of\nresearch groups. Consistent with previous reports, Jiang\u2019s\nlaboratory reported that the M1\u2013131 and M132\u2013162 peptides32 from the membrane protein and the N153\u2013178\nand N362\u2013412 peptides from the N protein33 were highly reactive with all convalescent-phase test sera\nfrom SARS patients. The laboratories of Wu and Che collaboratively\nidentified three conformational (amino acids 1\u201369, 68\u2013213,\nand 337\u2013422) and three linear (amino acids 1\u201369, 121\u2013213,\nand 337\u2013422) epitopes on the full-length N protein that were\nimmunodominant.34 Using a \u201csplit\nand mix\u201d combinatorial strategy, we synthesized an overlapping\npeptide library spanning all four structural proteins of the SARS-CoV\nBJ01 strain, including the envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid\n(N), and spike (S). We screened this peptide library with antisera\nfrom convalescent SARS patients and identified dominant peptide epitopes\nrecognized by anti-SARS IgG.35 Further\nexperiments in this paper indicate that three peptides in the S protein\n(S471\u2013503, S604\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191) were strongly bound by SARS-CoV-specific\nhuman IgG from 12.8, 32.6, and 13.9%, respectively, of the 470 SARS\npatients (Table 1).\nExtension of the peptides (Table S2) to\nfurther characterize the epitopes\u2019 N- and C-termini identified\na new immunodominant peptide (S597\u2013625), which was\nrecognized by antisera from 64% of the patients (Table 1). The S597\u2013625 peptide specifically reduced the titer of human IgG in convalescent\nsera from SARS patients who reacted with SARS-CoV viral lysates (Figure 2A). We studied sequentially\ncollected sera from 21 convalescent SARS patients whose sera (obtained\n3 months after onset of infection) strongly reacted with the S597\u2013625 peptide. The antisera from these patients continued\nto recognize the S597\u2013625 at 12 months [12/21 (57.1%)],\n18 months [7/21 (33.3%)], and 24 months [6/21 (28.6%)] after the onset\nof SARS (Figure 2B),\nimplying that the S597\u2013625 peptide is a major immunodominant\npeptide in humans and elicits a long-term B-cell memory response after\nnatural infection with SARS-CoV.\n\nTo study the functional significance of immunodominant peptides\nof the S glycoprotein, we generated 23 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs, Table S3) by immunization of mice. Ten of these\nstrongly bound to the SARS-CoV virion (Figure 3A). Among them, five blocked SARS-CoV infection\nof Vero E6 cells (Figure 3B), including mAb4E5, mAb4A10, and mAb6G5 against S471\u2013503, mAb11B1 against S604\u2013625, and mAb126\u201310\nagainst S1164\u20131191.\n\nIn contrast, two mAbs (mAb43-3-14 and mAb219-10-28) against\nS597\u2013625, despite sharing some of the same isotypes\nand constant region configurations with neutralizing antipeptide antibodies\n(IgG1/\u03ba, IgG2a/\u03ba, and IgG2b/\u03ba; Table 1), markedly enhanced SARS-CoV\ninfection of Vero E6 cells (Figure 3B). This was particularly striking given that Vero\nE6 cells lack Fc\u03b3R, and the best-understood mechanism for ADE\ninvolves Fc-mediated internalization and replication of virus. mAb43-3-14-\nand mAb219-10-28-enhanced Vero E6 cell infection was reduced in a\ndose-dependent manner by S597\u2013625, but not by an\nunrelated HBV peptide (Figure 4A,B), whereas ADE of human antisera from SARS-CoV-infected\npatients was also specifically blocked by the same peptide (Figure 4C,D), implying that\npeptide-based ADE occurred during the epidemic period of a SARS outbreak.\n\nAn antibody-peptide binding ELISA\nindicated that mAb11B1 against S604\u2013625 reacts with\nboth S597\u2013625 and S604\u2013625, whereas\nmAb43-3-14 against S597\u2013625 only bound to S597\u2013625 (Figure 4E). The data suggest that mAb11B1 was induced by S604\u2013625 and is a consensus peptide of S597\u2013625 and S604\u2013625, whereas mAb43-3-14 was from the N-terminal\npeptide S597\u2013603 (LYQDVNC) immunizing antigen.\nSynthesized peptides LYQDVN (S597\u2013602), LYQDVNC\n(S597\u2013603), and LYQDVNCT (S597\u2013604) were all immunoreactive with the tested sera of 24 SARS-positive\npatients, further confirming that the S597\u2013603 peptide\nis an immunodominant one in humans (Figure S1). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the S597\u2013604 peptide demonstrated that L597, Y598, Q599, D600, and C603 are critical\namino acid residues for interaction with mAb43-3-14 (Figure 4E; Table S4). The S597\u2013603 peptide lies close to the\nC-terminus of the SARS-CoV major receptor (ACE2)-binding domain (RBD).8 We speculate that mAb43-3-14 may expose specific\nconformations that catalyze SARS-CoV attachment to and/or membrane\nfusion with target cells.\n\nLow-molecular-weight peptides behave like haptens, with relatively\nlow immunogenicity. To make them more immunogenic, we chemically ligated\nfour copies of each peptide to a lysine core [BrCH2CO-Lys2-(Lys)-\u03b2-Ala-CONH2(BrK2KA), Scheme 1] to prepare a multiple\nantigen peptide system (MAP)36 and purified\nthem by preparative HPLC (Figure 5A; Table S7). Molecular\nweight was confirmed by LC-MS/MS (Figure 5B).\n\nWe used these synthetic MAPs to\nvaccinate rhesus monkeys (Table S4) as\nfollows: Vac1, control group (received 0.9% NaCl) of four macaques\nrandomly assigned to two groups for day 2 or day 6 postinfection sacrifice;\nVac2, MAP-S597\u2013625 given to six macaques randomly\nassigned to two groups for day 2 or day 6 postinfection sacrifice;\nVac3, a mixture of MAP-S471\u2013503, MAP-S604\u2013625, and MAP-S1164\u20131191 given to six macaques randomly\nassigned to two groups for day 2 or day 6 postinfection sacrifice;\nand Vac4, a mixture of MAP-S471\u2013503, MAP-S597\u2013625, and MAP-S1164\u20131191 given to six macaques randomly\nassigned to two groups for day 2 or day 6 postinfection sacrifice.\nThe immunization protocol included one priming injection followed\nby three boosts at 2-week intervals (Chart S1). Antipeptide polyclonal Abs (monkey IgG) monitored by ELISA showed\nhigh-level responses to all immunized peptides after three boosts\n(Figure 6, left).\n\nAntibodies (Figure 6A) against the four peptides in sera from\nVac1-immunized animals were at background level on all blood collection\ndays. Vac2 gradually induced anti-S597\u2013625 peptide\nantibodies after three boosts. Not surprisingly, both Vac2 and Vac4\nimmunizations elicited high levels of IgG against the S604\u2013625 peptide because the vaccine components consisted of the S597\u2013625 or S604\u2013625 epitopes in these two animal groups.\nAnti-S604\u2013625 and -S1164\u20131191 antibodies\nin the Vac3-immunized animal group reached their highest levels before\nthe second boost (28 days after the first injection). The average\ntiter of anti-S604\u2013625 IgG was greater than 1:106 in Vac3-immunized monkeys before SARS-CoV challenge and was\n3- or 2-fold times that of Vac2 or Vac4, respectively. Interestingly,\nwhen Vac3-vaccinated animals were challenged by SARS-CoV, the IgG\nlevel against S604\u2013625 gradually decreased (Figure 6B) on days 2 and\n6 postinfection. This is different from the Vac2 and Vac4 immunizations,\nafter which IgG levels inexplicably increased on day 2 postinfection\nand subsequently decreased on day 6 postinfection. This observation\nimplies that anti-S604\u2013625 antibodies are strongly\ninvolved in the neutralization of SARS-CoV in monkeys and that the\nexisting S597\u2013603 epitope (in Vac2 and Vac4) may\nreduce the total titer of anti-S604\u2013625 antibodies.\n\nAll immunized macaques were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV\n(PUMC01 strain) via nasal inhalation on the 14th day after the last\nboost, as described.37 At 2 and 6 days\npostinfection (DPI), the macaques were sacrificed (Chart S1; Table S7). The data for lung damage and viral burden\nin these macaques are summarized in Table 2.\n\nGross lung pathology was evident at both 2 and 6 DPI in all groups.\nIn mock-immunized macaques (Vac1), the average pathology grade was\ngrade IV (Figure 7A,B; Table S5), with severe diffuse alveolar damage,\nincluding alveolar shrinking and rupture of elastic fibers. Massive\nmacrophage infiltration was associated with fusion of alveolar septa.\nPulmonary edema, fibrin, hemorrhage, and cellular debris contributed\nto the severe interstitial pneumonitis. Damage was similar (grade\nIV) for Vac2, somewhat reduced (grade II\u2013III) for Vac4, and\nmarkedly diminished (grade I\u2013II) for Vac3. Immunohistochemistry\nusing mAbs against the viral peptides revealed a large number of SARS-CoV-infected\nmacrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in the Vac1 group (Figure 7C), averaging 13.5\n\u00b1 2.6 infected cells per 10 high-power fields (HPF) and 10.0\n\u00b1 3.0 infected cells per 10 HPF at 2 and 6 DPI, respectively.\nQuantitative viral burden analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed an\naverage of 141,000 copies/mg lung tissue (2 DPI) and 136,000 copies/mg\nlung tissue (6 DPI) of SARS-CoV in the lungs of the Vac1 group.\n\nCompared with the Vac1 group, the Vac2 group showed similar\nhistology at 2 DPI, but the interstitial pneumonia was far worse at\n6 DPI, characterized by massive numbers of inflammatory cells in hemorrhagic\nsepta, with extensive exudation. SARS-CoV-infected cells in the lungs\naveraged 13.8 \u00b1 2.1 per 10 HPF at 2 DPI and 9.8 \u00b1 3.0 per\n10 HPF at 6 DPI, whereas viral copies were 116,000/mg lung tissue\nand 143,000/mg lung tissue, respectively. Thus, even though S597\u2013625 was immunodominant in patients, antigenic in\nmonkeys, and reactive with the neutralizing mAb 11B1, it was nonprotective\nand even harmful when used as a vaccine.\n\nIn contrast, the immunized\nmonkeys in the Vac3 group had a strongly increased ability to control\nSARS-CoV infection in association with induction of high levels of\nanti-S604\u2013625 antibodies (Figure 7E). At 2 DPI, hemorrhage in septa and elastic\nfibers of the alveolar wall were indicated by apparent inflammation\nin silver staining results. Alveolus septa broadening with increasing\ninfiltration of inflammatory cells were recorded by 6 DPI, indicating\nthat only early, acute diffuse alveolar damage occurred. SARS-CoV-infected\nlung cells in the Vac3 group averaged 7.4 \u00b1 3.2 per 10 HPF (vs\nVac1 group: p < 0.01) and 7.0 \u00b1 2.9 per 10\nHPF (vs Vac1 group: p < 0.01) at 2 and 6 DPI,\nrespectively. The SARS-CoV burden averaged 6,200 copies/mg lung tissue\nat 2 DPI and 7,300 copies/mg lung tissue at 6 DPI. This represents\na ratio of \u223c19 and \u223c20 between the number of SARS-CoV\ncopies in the Vac3 and Vac1 groups at 2 and 6 DPI, respectively.\n\nFor animals that received Vac4, symptoms of acute diffuse alveolar\ndamage were visible, including fusion of thick septa and ruptured\nelastic fibers of the alveoli. The average number of SARS-CoV infected\ncells in the lung tissues was 8.14 \u00b1 3.32 per 10 HPF at 2 DPI\n(vs Vac1 group: p < 0.01) and 7.8 \u00b1 2.91\nper 10 HPF at 6 DPI (vs Vac1 group: p < 0.01).\nThe SARS-CoV burden averaged 31,254 copies/mg lung tissue at 6 DPI,\nthat is, 4.5 times the burden of 6,835 copies/mg lung tissue at 2\nDPI. The Vac4 group also showed a 4.3-fold increase to Vac3 group\n(31,254 copies/mg vs 7,300 copies/mg) of viral burden at 6 DPI, suggesting\nthat the presence of IgG against S597\u2013603 facilitated\nSARS-CoV infection of immunized macaques.\n\nIn a separate experiment\nfocused on the phenomenon of ADE in macaques, rhesus monkeys were\ndivided into six groups (n = 3 per group, Table S9). Three groups were separately sacrificed\nat 2 or 6 DPI; each time point included a control group and two groups\nthat received the enhancing mAb43-3-14 at doses of 0.2 mg/kg or 1.8\nmg/kg 1 day prior to challenge with the SARS-CoV PUMC01 strain. Gross\npathologic changes were again recorded in the control group at a grade\nIV level (Figure 8A,B).\nAlthough clear pathologic changes were observed in one of the three\nmonkeys in the 0.2 mg/kg group, we concluded that previous treatment\nwith a dose of 0.2 mg/kg mAb43-3-14 did not, on average, significantly\nreduce or facilitate SARS-CoV infection. However, macaques treated\nwith 1.8 mg/kg mAb43-3-14 showed a marked increase in lung lesions.\nThe lung lesion area in macaque D4-060060 (4.0 \u00d7 2.5 cm2) at 6 DPI was the largest in all dic experimental groups. At 6 DPI,\nall lungs from the 1.8 mg/kg group showed larger areas of necrosis,\nsevere sheets of septa fusion, necrotic lesions at the hemorrhagic\nsepta, and massive macrophage infiltration in the alveoli, indicating\nthat the interstitial pneumonia was much more severe in the mAb43-3-14-treated\ngroup than in the control group (Figure 8C). There were more SARS-CoV-infected cells\nin the lung tissue (12.5 \u00b1 2.3 per 10 HPF at 2 DPI and 13.4 \u00b1\n2.6 per 10 HPF at 6 DPI, p < 0.01 vs control group).\nThe average SARS-CoV burden in the lungs was 911,000 copies/mg lung\ntissue at 2 DPI and 944,000 copies/mg lung tissue at 6 DPI, a 10-fold\nenhancement compared with the control group at 2 DPI and a 14-fold\nenhancement at 6 DPI (Figure 8D). This result further confirmed that enhancement of the\nSARS-CoV infection in macaques was directly related to antibodies\nagainst S597\u2013603.\n\nIn\nthis study, we reported for the first time that a SARS-CoV inactivated\nvaccine could induce ADE and lung pathology in experimental rhesus\nmonkeys. Four antigenic peptides (S471\u2013503, S604\u2013625, S597\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191) from the spike protein of SARS-CoV were identified by high cross-reactivity\nwith a large number of antisera from convalescent SARS patients. Ten\nof 23 mAbs generated against these four peptides bound to the SARS-CoV\nvirion (Figure 3A),\nindicating that each peptide is exposed on the SARS-CoV surface. Among\nthem, five mAbs against S471\u2013503, S604\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191 blocked SARS-CoV infection of\nVero E6 cells (Figure 3B), and two mAbs (mAb43-3-14 and mAb219-10-28) markedly enhanced\nSARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells. mAb43-3-14 alone significantly\nenhanced SARS-CoV infection at the tested high dose of 1.8 mg/kg in\nexperimental rhesus monkeys, whereas Vac3 (consisting of S471\u2013503, S604\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191 MAPs)\nsuccessfully protected animals from SARS-CoV challenge and lung pathology.\nAlanine scanning mutagenesis indicated that L597, Y598, Q599, D600,\nand/or C603 are critical amino acid residues and that S597\u2013603 is responsible for mAb43-3-14-induced enhancement, which may catalyze\nSARS-CoV attachment and/or membrane fusion with target cells by exposing\nspecific conformations of the spike protein.\n\nS471\u2013503 is located at the virus RBD8 and can\nblock SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro,35 probably by interfering with high-affinity attachment of\nSARS virions to the human ACE2 receptor at residues T487 and N497\nof the RBD.38,39 The coronavirus spike proteins\nhave been characterized as class I fusion proteins containing highly\nconserved heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2).40 Thus, interfering with HR1 binding to HR2 has become a\nrecent target for prevention of viral fusion and entry into target\ncells. S1164\u20131191 overlaps HR2 (1145\u20131184\naa) in the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. The mechanism by which anti-S1164\u20131191 antibodies reduce the efficiency of SARS-CoV\nfusion is likely to be associated with an exposed five-turn \u03b1-helix\nconformation via HR2 binding to HR1 and an extended conformation formed\nby residues 1160\u20131177 and 1178\u20131184 of three antiparallel\nHR2 helices in an oblique orientation surrounding a parallel, trimeric\ncoiled-coil of three HR1 helices.41 Binding\nof mAb581-39 to the SARS-CoV virion was the strongest among the mAbs\n(Figure 3A), which\nimplies that S1164\u20131191 peptide may act as a major\nimmunoantigen.\n\nSevere lung injury occurred in one challenged\nrhesus monkey that had been immunized with an inactivated SARS-CoV\nvaccine (Figure 1).\nVery strong serologic reactivity of S597\u2013625 with\nantisera from 64.4% of convalescent SARS patients was observed; the\nresponse was to two tandem epitopes (S597\u2013603 and\nS604\u2013625), but each epitope generated antibodies\nwith disparate functions regarding neutralization or enhancement of\nSARS-CoV infection. Thus, in persons infected by SARS-CoV, enhancing\nantibodies and neutralizing antibodies may partly counteract each\nother\u2019s functions.\n\nSARS-CoV\u2019s ADE was also reported\nby other research laboratories. Using an HL-CZ human promonocyte cell\nline, Chen and Huang found that higher concentrations of antisera\ncollected from SARS-CoV-infected patients facilitated SARS-CoV infection\nand induced higher levels of virus-induced apoptosis. They further\ndemonstrated that this phenomenon occurred via antispike protein antibodies\nthat mediated ADE, but not via anti-N protein antibodies.42 Bruzzone and Jaume\u2019s laboratory showed\nthat antispike immune serum increased infection of human monocyte-derived\nmacrophages by replication-competent SARS-CoV as well as by spike-pseudotyped\nlentiviral particles (SARS-CoVpp), although they did not clarify whether\nthis enhancement was through the Fc\u03b3RII pathway.43 Jaume et al. reported that a recombinant, full-length\nspike protein trimer potentiated infection of human B cell lines,\ndespite eliciting a neutralizing and protective immune response in\nrodents. The study demonstrated that antispike immune serum, while\ninhibiting viral entry in a permissive cell line, potentiated infection\nof immune cells by SARS-CoV spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles,\nas well as by replication-competent SARS coronavirus. Jaume and collaborators\nproposed that ADE of SARS-CoV utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism\ninto immune cells.44\n\nThis study demonstrates\nfor the first time that an antibody (mAb43-3-14) targeting a specific\nlinear epitope (S597\u2013603) of the SARS-CoV spike\nprotein can mediate enhancement of virus infection both in vitro and\nin non-human primates via an epitope sequence-dependent mechanism.\nWe also demonstrate that the viral peptides that induce protection\nfrom pathogenesis can be identified and distinguished from those inducing\nenhancement in primates. These findings reveal a new mechanism of\nvirus evasion of host defense that potentially provides an alternative\nstrategy to prepare safe and effective vaccines against ADE of virus\ninfections.\n\nNew\npeptides from the spike glycoprotein were designed on the basis of\nthe information gained in the first round of immunopeptide discovery.32\n\nPeptides were synthesized manually by\nstandard Fmoc chemistry protocols on Rink-amide MBHA resin (NovaBiochem,\nSan Diego, CA, USA; 0.44 mmol/g). All of the l-\u03b1-Fmoc-protected\namino acids and coupling reagents (DIC and HOBt) were obtained from\nGL Biochem (Shanghai, China). All solvents were of analytical grade\nand used without further purification. Each amino acid assembly was\ncompleted by using 3 equiv of l-\u03b1-Fmoc-protected amino\nacids and coupling reagents, and the ninhydrin colorimetric test after\neach coupling was carried out to ensure no detectable amino remaining.\nIn the case that the peptide-bearing beads were colorized (positive)\nby ninhydrin test, the free amino group was then blocked by reacting\nwith 15% acetic anhydride in dichloromethane (DCM) (v/v) for 30 min.\nCrude peptides without Cys, Met, Arg, and Trp residues were cleaved\nusing a one-step TFA cleavage method under the following conditions:\nTFA (1.9 mL), deionized water (50 \u03bcL), and triethyl silane (50\n\u03bcL). For peptides containing Cys, Met, Arg, or Trp residues,\nthe following conditions were used: TFA (1.63 mL), thioanisole (0.1\nmL), phenol (0.1 g), deionized water (0.1 mL), EDT (50 \u03bcL),\nand triethylsilane (20 \u03bcL). TFA solution was treated with ice-cooled\ndiethyl ether to precipitate the peptide. The crude peptide was washed\ntwice by ice-cooled diethyl ether and dried in the N2 flow\ncondition.\n\nIn particular, peptide S471\u2013503 was synthesized on SynPhase PA RAM d-series lanterns (loading\n8 \u03bcmol/lantern, Mimotopes, Raleigh, NC, USA). The lanterns were\ntreated with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 15 min\nfor deprotection. The general coupling conditions for lanterns utilized\na solution of 80% DMF and 20% DCM, with reagents at the following\nconcentrations: AA, 120 mM; HOBt, 144 mM; DIC, 120 mM. For each lantern\na minimum of 500 \u03bcL of the activated amino acid solution was\nrequired. Alternatively, bromophenol blue (5 \u03bcL/mL coupling\nsolution, 5M) was used as an indicator to monitor the reaction. Simultaneous\nside-chain deprotection and cleavage were carried out using 2.5 mL\nper lantern of a solution of 82.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/5% thioanisole/5%\nanisole/5% water/2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol for 2 h.\n\nAll crude peptides\nwere purified by HPLC to >95% purity on a semipreparative RP C18\ncolumn (Zorbax, 300SB-C18, 9.4 \u00d7 250 mm. Agilent, Colorado Springs,\nCO, USA) eluting at 4 mL/min with a 0\u201320% CH3CN\n(buffer B) gradient in water (buffer A) containing 0.1% TFA over 5\nmin followed by a 20\u201365% CH3CN over 30 min. Pure\npeptides were identified by an Shimadzu LC-10AT analytic HPLC system\nwith a C8 column (4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) and Agilent LC-MSD\nTOF (Figure S4; S604\u2013625, calculated 2505.83 Da, observed 2505.19 Da; S1164\u20131191, calculated 3439.87 Da, observed 3438.70 Da; S597\u2013625, calculated 3238.62 Da, observed 3238.54 Da; S471\u2013503, calculated 3863.45 Da, observed 3864.20 Da). The molecular weight\nof peptides was calculated by a Peptide Molecular Weight Calculator\nof Biopeptide Co., Inc. (https://www.biopeptide.com/PepCalc/).\n\nThe branched lysine core\n(BrCH2CO-Lys2-(Lys)-\u03b2-Ala-CONH2) scaffold was synthesized manually by standard Fmoc chemistry protocols\non 0.22 mmol (500 mg) of Rink-amide MBHA resin (NovaBiochem, 0.44\nmmol/g) as described above. N-\u03b1-Fmoc-Lys (Fmoc)\nwas used at the branch points. The Fmoc-protected amino acids (5.0\nequiv) were assembled by using 5.0 equiv of DIC coupling reagent and\nHOBt additive. The N-termini of the four branches of the lysine core\nwere bromoacetylated on the resin with 10 equiv of bromoacetic acid\nand DIC in DMF for 2 h. The bromoacetylated lysine core was cleaved\nfrom the resin after treatment with 5% H2O/95% TFA for\n2 h. It was then precipitated with cold diethyl ether, lyophilized,\nand purified by HPLC on a semipreparative RP C18 column (Zorbax, 300SB-C18,\n9.4 \u00d7 250 mm) eluting at 4 mL/min with a 0\u201320% CH3CN gradient in water containing 0.1% TFA over 5 min followed\nby 20\u201340% CH3CN over 20 min. Pure lysine core (25%\nyield) was identified by Agilent LC-MSD TOF: calculated (MH+) 957.03 Da, observed 957.05 Da.\n\nMAPs were prepared for immunizations\nusing a modified chemical ligation protocol.45 Ligation was achieved by mixing the lysine core and peptide in 500\n\u03bcL of solvent at certain pH value. The reaction was monitored\nby an analytical RP C8 column (Kromasil C8, The Nest Group, Inc.,\nSouthborough, MA, USA) under UV214 nm wavelength. After it appeared\ncomplete, the reaction was quenched by adding 0.05% TFA to adjust\nthe pH to 7.0. The final product was then purified by semipreparative\nHPLC at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. The ligated peptide was lyophilized\nand characterized by an Agilent LC-MSD TOF. The preparative conditions\nof MAPs are listed in Table S10.\n\nDetailed conditions of each MAPs peptide are summarized: MAP-S471\u2013597 (0.3 mg of BrK2KA reacted with 5.0\nmg of S471\u2013503 peptide), MeCN/H2O/DMSO\n(40:50:10 v/v/v) as mixture solvent, Na2CO3 adjusting\npH 8.0, sonication assisting reaction, 30% yield, HPLC preparation\nby a gradient of 0\u201325% MeCN against water for 5 min, 25\u201340%\nMeCN for 50 min; MAP-S604\u2013625 (0.4 mg BrK2KA reacted with 5.1 mg of S604\u2013625 peptide), MeCN/H2O (25:75, v/v), Na2CO3 adjusting pH\n7.8, 40% yield, HPLC preparation by a gradient of 0\u201325% MeCN\nagainst water for 5 min, 25\u201340% MeCN for 50 min; MAP-S597\u2013625 (0.35 mg of BrK2KA reacted with 5.0\nmg of S597\u2013625 peptide), MeCN/H2O (50:50,\nv/v), Na2CO3 adjusting pH 8.5, 50% yield, HPLC\npreparation by a gradient of 0\u201325% MeCN against water for 5\nmin, 25\u201340% MeCN for 50 min; MAP-S1164\u20131191(0.35 mg of BrK2KA reacted with 5.0 mg of S1164\u20131191 peptide), MeCN/H2O (50:50, v/v), Na2CO3 adjusting pH 8.5, 42% yield, HPLC preparation by a gradient\nof 0\u201335% MeCN against water for 5 min, 35\u201340% MeCN for\n50 min. Water and MeCN containing 0.1% TFA used for HPLC preparation\nwere preprepared. The column and flow rate were a Vydac 208TP510 and\n4 mL/min, respectively.\n\nThe studies of human sera to evaluate their levels\nof anti-SARS-CoV IgG that recognized the peptides were approved with\nan Expedited Review of Research Plan by the Institutional Review Board\nof Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy Medical\nSciences & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC). More\nthan 500 antisera of SARS patients and 27 sera of healthy volunteers\nwere involved in this study, which was conducted according to the\nguidelines for treatment of human subjects of the National Institutes\nof Health, USA. Written informed consent was obtained from all study\nparticipants.\n\nThe PEPscan was carried out as described by Hu\net al.35 without major modification. The\noptical density was read at 450 and 630 nm in an optical density reader\n(Labsystem, Franklin, MA, USA). The cutoff value was determined as\ntwice the average value of the negative controls.\n\nThe SARS-CoV\nPUMC01 strain46 was diluted with coating\nbuffer to 4 \u00d7 10\u20135 TCID50/mL (bicarbonate/carbonate\ncoating buffer, 0.05 M, pH 9.6). The virus was then coated on 96-well\nplates with 100 \u03bcL (4 \u00d7 10\u20134 of TCID50) of virus per well for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C. The coating buffer\nwas removed from the wells, and 100 \u03bcL of blocking buffer was\nadded per well and incubated for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C (2% BSA in PBS,\npH 7.4; GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The plates were washed twice with\nPBS (pH 7.2). The mouse monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV and\ncontrol mAb against HIV-P27 were diluted to 0.001 \u03bcg/\u03bcL\nin the blocking buffer, added to the wells separately, and incubated\nfor 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were washed twice with PBS and the\nsecondary antibody (HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, (GeneTex,\nIrvine, CA, USA) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer) was added to each\nwell and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The secondary antibody was\nremoved, the plate was washed three times with PBS, and then 100 \u03bcL\nof TMB substrate solution (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to\neach well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance\nof the test wells was read at 450 nm (A450).\n\nMAbs were serially diluted in DMEM culture medium.\nHuman polyclonal antisera from convalescent SARS patients were diluted\nto 1:500 (v/v). The SARS-CoV PUMC01 strain was diluted with DMEM to\n4 \u00d7 10\u20134 TCID50. The NRS neutralization\nassay was performed in 96-well flat-bottom plates. The setup is similar\nto that of the cytopathic effect (CPE)-based neutralization assay.\nAfter incubation of 50 \u03bcL (4 \u00d7 10\u20134 TCID50) of virus with 50 \u03bcL of antibodies or antisera in\na total of 100 \u03bcL of DMEM medium per well for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C,\nVero E6 cells (2 \u00d7 105 cells in 100 \u03bcL, from\nCell Culture Center of PUMC) were added to each well. On day 5 of\ninfection, when >70% of the cells showed CPE in the viral control\nwells (with DMEM instead of antibody or antisera), the culture medium\nwas removed from the test wells and 100 \u03bcL of 0.15% neutral\nred (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in DMEM was added to each well. After\nincubation for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, the neutral red medium was removed,\nthe plates were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.2), and then 100 \u03bcL\nof acidified alcohol (1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol) was added to\neach well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance\nof neutral red stained plates was read at 450 nm (A450).\n\nPercent neutralization was determined by the\nfollowing formula: % neutralization = (A450 of antibody test wells \u2013 A450 of viral control wells)/(A450 of cell\ncontrol wells \u2013 A450 of viral control\nwells) \u00d7 100.\n\nGanp-transgenic\nmice were originally established in a C57BL/6 strain as described\npreviously.47 The mice were backcrossed\nwith BALB/c mice for at least eight generations and used for immunization\nto establish mAbs. All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free\nconditions by the Center for Animal Resources and Development (CARD),\nKumamoto University.\n\nAs immunogens, four peptides of S471\u2013503, S604\u2013625, S597\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191 were synthesized and conjugated with keyhole\nlimpet hemocyanin (KLH) by Operon Biotechnologies (Tokyo, Japan).\nOne hundred micrograms of peptide\u2013KLH emulsified in complete\nFreund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) was injected subcutaneously as a primary\nimmunization and boosted after 2 weeks with incomplete Freund\u2019s\nadjuvant (IFA). Sera of immunized mice were measured by ELISA using\nplates coated with free peptides. The mice with highest serum Ab titers\nwere further immunized, and 4 days later the spleen cells were obtained\nfor polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion with mouse myeloma cell\nline X63 using standard procedures.48 The\nfused cells were selected with HAT medium in microculture plates at\na concentration of 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well in the presence\nof IL-6 (5 units/mL).\n\nThe mAbs binding to the immunizing peptide\nAgs were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab (Zymed,\nSouth San Francisco, CA, USA) with the substrate OPD (Wako Chemicals,\nOsaka, Japan). The positive signals (A490 > 1.0) were selected, and hybridomas were cloned by a limiting\ndilution method, adapted to serum-free media, and purified by protein\nG-Sepharose affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire,\nUK). The purity of the antibodies was examined by SDS-PAGE and protein\nstaining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The heavy and light chain\nisotypes were determined using an isotyping kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin\nLakes, NJ, USA).\n\nThe affinity of the mAbs for peptides was determined\nby the BIAcore assay.49 The on- and off-rate\nconstants (kon and koff) for binding of the mAbs to S471\u2013503,\nS604\u2013625, S597\u2013625, and S1164\u20131191 peptides (Table 1) were determined using the BIAcore system\n(BIAcore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The carboxyl-methylated\ndextran surface of the sensor chip was activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dietylaminopropyl)carbodiimide\nand N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC\u2013EHS).50 Each peptide was immobilized through the free\nthiol group of a cysteine residue that was deliberately placed at\nthe N-terminus, by injection of 35 \u03bcL of a 20 \u03bcg/mL solution\nin 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer\n(pH 6) to the EDC\u2013NHS-activated surface that had been reacted\nwith 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine. The excess disulfide groups\nwere deactivated by the addition of cysteine. The mAbs were diluted\nin 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v)\nBIAcore surfactant P20 and injected over the immobilized antigen at\na flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min. The association was monitored by the\nincrease in the refractive index of the sensor chip surface per unit\ntime. The dissociation of the mAbs was monitored after the end of\nthe association phase with a flow rate of 50 \u03bcL/min. Kinetic\nrate constants were calculated from the collected data using the Pharmacia\nKinetics Evaluation software.51 The kon was determined by measuring the rate of binding\nto the antigen at different protein concentrations.\n\nRhesus monkeys (3\u20134 years old, Tables S4 and S6, from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science)\nwere examined according to the national microbiologic and parasite\nSPF standard and were determined free of anti-SARS antibody. The SPF\nmonkeys were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility before infection\nwith SARS-CoV. The monkeys were then housed in a biosafety level 3\n(BSL-3) facility for infection experiments. All procedures were approved\nby the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Institute of Laboratory\nAnimal Science, Peking Union Medical College (Animal Welfare Assurance\nNo. A5655-01, IACUC approval date September 24, 2007).\n\nMonkey challenges were performed in a BSL-3\nfacility.37 Briefly, the animals were anesthetized\nwith ketamine (0.5 mL/kg, im). The TCID50 10\u20136 (4.0 mL/monkey) of the stock PUMC01 strain virus was sprayed into\nthe nasal cavity of the animals.\n\nThe lung tissues were sampled from the euthanized animals. Organs\nwere examined grossly, and photographs were taken to record the lung\ndamage.\n\nSamples of 5\u201310 g of lung tissues were collected\nfrom each lung and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. The remaining tissues\nwere fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 1 week in the BSL-3 laboratory.\nThe tissues were then processed in the regular pathology laboratory\nby dehydration, embedding, and sectioning.\n\nFor hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) staining, the sections were sequentially treated with\nxylene I, 10 min; xylene II, 10 min; 100% alcohol, 5 min; 95% alcohol,\n5 min; 90% alcohol, 5 min; 80% alcohol, 5 min; 70% alcohol, 5 min;\nand PBS, 5 min. The sections were then stained in hematoxylin for\n5 min; washed with tap water and double-distilled water for 5 s, with\nPBS for 5 min, with 95% alcohol for 30 s, with eosin for 30 s, with\n95% alcohol for 5 s, with 100% alcohol I for 5 s, with 100% alcohol\nII for 5 s, with xylene I for 5 min, with xylene II for 5 min, and\nwith xylene III for 5 min; and mounted with mounting buffer (ZhongShan\nInc., Guangzhou, China).\n\nA mixture of the mouse monoclonal antibodies\nmAb-4E5 (0.01 \u03bcg/mL), mAb-11B1 (0.01 \u03bcg/mL), and mAb-9A6\n(0.01 \u03bcg/mL) was used as primary antibody for the immunohistochemical\nanalysis of the infected lung tissues. Briefly, tissue sections were\ntreated with the primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight, washed three\ntimes with PBS, incubated with HRP\u2013goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:1000,\nZhongShan Inc., PRC) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, and then washed three\ntimes with PBS. The DAB substrate (1:50) was added and incubated at\n37 \u00b0C for 30 min and then stained with hematoxylin for 3 min.\n\nThe tissues from\ncranial and caudal lobes of the left lung and cranial, middle, and\ncaudal lobes of the right lung from each animal were sampled and pooled\ntogether, and the total RNA was isolated from the lung tissues using\nTrizol (Invitrogen, USA). One hundred milligrams of lung tissue was\nmixed with 1 mL of Trizol extraction buffer and homogenized for 60\ns (Homogenizer, IKA, Germany). The RNA wan then extracted with chloroform\nand precipitated with isopropanol. RNA was dissolved in 50 \u03bcL\nof DEPC water, and the RNA quality was verified by electrophoresis\non agarose gel.\n\nFor the reverse transcription, 5 \u03bcg of\ntotal RNA was reverse transcribed with a high-capacity cDNA kit (RecertAid\nFirst Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA)\nwith random hexamer primers. The reaction was performed at 42 \u00b0C\nfor 60 min and terminated at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min.\n\nTwo microliters\nof reverse transcription mixture was used as template. The primers\nfor SARS-CoV were 5\u2032-ATGAATTACCAAGTCAATGGTTAC-3\u2032\nand 5\u2032-CATAACCAGTCGGTACAGCTAC-3\u2032.\nThe PCR was normalized against monkey glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase\n(GAPDH) (NM002046). The GAPDH primers were 5\u2032-TCAACAGCGACACCCACTC-3\u2032\nand 5\u2032-CTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTG-3\u2032\n(product size = 201 bp). The PCR was performed with a PCR kit (Taq DNA polymerase, Fermentas). The PCR products were detected\nby 1.6% agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nReaction conditions were\nas follows: 10\u00d7 Taq buffer (2 \u03bcL), 2 mM\ndNTP (2 \u03bcL), forward primer (20 \u03bcM, 0.4 \u03bcL), reverse\nprimer (20 \u03bcM, 0.4 \u03bcL), Taq DNA polymerase\n(0.8 \u03bcL), 25 mM MgCl2 (2 \u03bcL), template DNA\n(cDNA, 2 \u03bcL), H2O (9.4 \u03bcL); step 1, 94 \u00b0C\nfor 3 min; step 2, 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C\nfor 30 s, for 26 cycles, then 72 \u00b0C for 10 min.\n\nThe SARS-CoV fragment was\nprepared by RT-PCR. A 240 bp fragment of SARS-CoV was amplified and\nseparated by 1.6% agarose electrophoresis. The DNA fragment was recovered\nfrom the gel with a gel extraction kit (MinElute Gel Extraction Kit,\nQIAGEN Stanford, Valencia, CA, USA). The recovered DNA was measured\nand adjusted to concentrations of 1 \u00d7 106, 1 \u00d7\n105, 1 \u00d7 104, 1 \u00d7 103,\n1 \u00d7 102, and 1 \u00d7 101 copies/\u03bcL,\nwhich were used to generate a standard curve. This known copy number\nstandard curve was used to calculate the copy number of SARS-CoV mRNA\nin the infected lung tissues.\n\nRT-PCR for the infected samples\nwas performed under the same conditions used for standard curves with\nthe Roche Light Cycler following the instructions for the SYBR Green\nRealtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan).\n\nThe copy number\nof the virus was detected as follows. Briefly, 2 \u03bcL of the reverse\ntranscription mixture from step 1 was used as template. The primers\nfor SARS-CoV were 5\u2032-ATGAATTACCAAGTCAATGGTTAC-3\u2032\nand 5\u2032-CATAACCAGTCGGTACAGCTAC-3\u2032.\nThe reaction was continued for 40 cycles under the conditions: 2 \u00d7\nQuantiTect SYBR Green PCR (10 \u03bcL), gorward primer (10 \u03bcM,\n1 \u03bcL), teverse primer (10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcL), RNase-free\nwater (3 \u03bcL), yemplate DNA (cDNA, 5 \u03bcL), total volume\n(20 \u03bcL); step 1, 94 \u00b0C for 3 min; step 2, 94 \u00b0C for\n15 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 20 s, for 40 cycles and\nthen move to the melt curve procedure.\n\nThe peptide and/or peptide mixtures were dissolved as 480 \u03bcg/mL\nof each peptide in 0.9% NaCl and then formulated with an equal volume\nof Freund\u2019s Complete Adjuvant (FCA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,\nUSA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The injected\ndose of vaccine was 0.5 mL/4 kg/monkey (120 \u03bcg/4 kg/monkey)\ngiven through intramuscular (im) injections at four sites on the arms\nand legs.\n\nRhesus monkeys were boosted at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after\nthe first injection with the same dose of peptides and volume of vaccine\nas for the first injection, but formulated in an equal volume of Freund\u2019s\nincomplete adjuvant (IFA) (Sigma).\n\nVenous blood samples (2 mL/each)\nwere collected every 7 days from each monkey. The sera were isolated\nby centrifugation at 2000 rpm and immediately stored at \u221280\n\u00b0C.\n\nAntipeptidic IgG was detected by ELISA. Free peptides\nwere diluted in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) to a final concentration\nof 10 \u03bcg/mL. One hundred microliters of the peptide solution\nwas added to 96-well polystyrene high BIND microplates (Corning Life\nScience, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for coating overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nThe wells of plates were then washed three times with PBS-Tween buffer\n(10 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.2) and\nsubsequently blocked with 3% BSA in PBS-Tween buffer for an additional\n1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After three thorough washings of the wells with\nPBS-Tween buffer, the antigen-coated microplates were incubated with\ndiluted monkey sera at room temperature for 1 h. After three washings\nwith PBS-Tween buffer, bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated\ngoat anti-monkey IgG (1:2000 v/v, Gene Tex). After three washings\nwith PBS-Tween, a TMB substrate solution (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)\nwas added and the color developed for 20 min before the reaction was\nstopped with 100 \u03bcL of 0.2 M H2SO4. The\nabsorbance at 450 nm was read using a microtiter plate reader.\n\nEighteen rhesus monkeys in six groups\n(Table S6, 3\u20134 years old) were examined\naccording to the national microbiologic and parasite SPF standard\nand were verified free of anti-SARS antibody. mAb43-3-14 was adjusted\nto concentrations of 0.4 and 3.6 mg/mL with 0.9% NaCl, respectively.\nA dose of 0.2 or 1.8 mg/kg of the antibody given by intravenous (iv)\ninjection was used to treat the different groups. The same volume\nof 0.9% NaCl was used for the control group. The procedures were approved\nby the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Institute of Laboratory\nAnimal Science, Peking Union Medical College (Animal Welfare Assurance\nNo. A5655-01, IACUC approval date September 24, 2007).\n\nAll data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad\nsoftware). For neutralization assays and ELISA, mean and standard\ndeviation were used to determine significance. For qRT-PCR, geometric\nmean and standard deviation were used to determine virus burden."}
