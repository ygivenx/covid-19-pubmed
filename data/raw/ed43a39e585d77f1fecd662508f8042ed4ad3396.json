{"title": "Title: Modeling the Corona Virus Outbreak in IRAN", "body": "early April by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further actions are implemented, the spread of COVID-19 is expected to continue slowly, reaching 21,000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed cases, deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days; a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Year's celebration, Farvardin, first month of spring (30 th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the number of reported deaths of COVDI-19 to be between 3,000-5,000 and the number of recovered cases between 5,000 -30,000 from the total confirmed cases in the range of 35,000-70,000 infected cases.\n\nConclusions: The Modeling of Covid-19 outbreak shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing.

This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition, many factors are effective in stopping the disease.

WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chosen by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January. (1) During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom (2) . As of 17 March 2020, according to Iranian health authorities, there had been 988 COVID-19 deaths in Iran with more than 16,000 confirmed infections(3,4,5) This respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for serious illnesses in people all over the world. According to the global statistics of fatalities caused by coronavirus, and its spread in Iran, it is vital and essential to forecast its outbreak by a model. As the outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), is a worldwide pandemic, it is rapidly expanding in Iran, real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. However, official individual patient data rarely become publicly available, when the information is most needed. This is an analysis of the COVID-19 out-break in Iran. In this population-level observational study, I used the Iranian Ministry of Health reports downloaded from GitHub, an online data-sharing platform. This dataset is updated on a daily basis with a 24 hour delay. The dataset includes time-stamped counts of the daily cases and deaths within each province in Iran.\n\nIn this study, we will build a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. I will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases, deaths and recovered for the whole country.\n\n.

This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree -more recent values are given a greater weight.\n\nDue to the lack of historical data, seasonality analysis has been removed from the modeling and the trends are analyzed based on the daily timeframe. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. The trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time.\n\nThe predictive model will be tested against four regression model evaluations for robustness. They are as follow:\n\n\u2022 MAE -mean absolute error, this gives less weight to the outliers \u2022 MAPE -similar to MSE, but normalized by true observation. The downside is when the true observation is zero, this metric could be problematic.\n\n\u2022 MSE -mean squared error, it is like a combination measurement of bias ad variance of the prediction. For example, bias squared add variance. .

The purpose of this test is to see how well the model fits the dataset without over-fitting it. The AIC score rewards models that achieve a high goodness-of-fit score ad penalizes them if they become over complex. A low AIC score indicates a better fit.\n\nSince the outbreak has begun in early February 2020, the rate of infection and number of deaths has been increased significantly as seen in the illustration below. On the 19 th February, the first 2 deaths were reported, on the 23 rd February, 4 other provinces reported COVID-19 deaths, and within the space 28 days the virus has spreaded across the whole country (see illustration 2), by 20 th March 2020, Tehran, the capital city of Iran reported approximately to 4000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\n.

The top 10 most affected provinces are Tehran, Esfahan, Mazandaran, Qom, Alborz, Gilan, Markazi, Razavi-Khorasan, East Azerbaijan and Semon, which can be reviewed in illustration 3, province ranked by confirmed cases from the highest number to the least.\n\n.

If no control measures are put in place, it is expected that over 40,000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However, if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success, one would expect the spread of the COV-19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID-19 to continue on a gentle incline, reaching 21,000 by mid-June.\n\n.

The base model shown in Illustration 5 is the simple forecast model, without trend or seasonality built-in. It has the highest AIC out of the three models across the 5 sampled provinces, although it has a low MAPE, when compared to the other three statistical metrics like RMSE, MAE, MASE it yields the highest margin of error in the group.\n\nThe quality of the predictive model for Tehran is acceptable because the dataset is more robust compared to one integrated with seasonality. The Mean Absolute Scaled Error, MASE is less than 1 for the projected 90 days period which is a positive score for the model. The RMSE, unbiased forecast score is slightly higher than the MAE, which gives a median future distribution of 84. The MAPE is over 100% which means the errors are \"much greater\" then the actual values.

This article strived to analyze the growth trend of the number of patients, deaths and patients recovered in some provinces of Iran. The knowledge gained can help health planners and planners. Combining the findings of this study with other countries' studies can help to extract a global pattern for the virus outbreak process analysis. We believe that there are still many factors that can be included in the study. Adding these factors helps to validate and consolidate the .
