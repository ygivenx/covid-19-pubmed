{"title": "Detection of respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR in children with clinical suspicion of pertussis", "body": "\nBordetella pertussis is a major etiological agent of pertussis (whooping cough). The disease can be atypical and pertussis-like coughing can be caused by other respiratory pathogens [4]. The diagnosis of pertussis is usually suspected clinically, but only proven by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture.\n\nPCR methods are more sensitive for B. pertussis identification and other respiratory pathogens. Multiplex real-time PCR could be applied as broad-range respiratory PCR.\n\nAll patients in whom a diagnostic test for B. pertussis was requested from April 2001 to February 2002 were included. The records of the patients were analyzed retrospectively and the patients were assigned to two groups as described in Table 1 [6]. \n\n\n\nNasopharyngeal swabs (15 samples), throat swabs (39 samples), sputum (three samples) and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) (five samples) were received. The PCR assay was performed by a single extraction. The extracted nucleic acid was thereafter added to a four-tube multiplex RNA real-time PCR for 11 RNA respiratory viruses [4] and a four-tube DNA real-time PCR [4, 5]. All PCR products were detected by specific fluorophore-labelled probes that can be distinguished without post-PCR analysis.\n\nSixty-two patients were seen in the study period from which a diagnostic test for B. pertussis was requested. Sufficient clinical information could be obtained on 59/62 (95%) patients and assigned Group I or Group II. The clinical information for 59 patients is shown in Table 2, the symptoms of paroxysmal cough and whoops were significantly associated with Group I. \n\n\n\nAnalysis of the samples by real-time PCR showed that B. pertussis was detected in 17 of the 38 patients in Group I and none of the patients in Group II (P < 0.005). Using the WHO definition for suspected pertussis used in surveillance as the \u2019gold standard\u2019 for B. pertussis, the PCR has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 45, 100, 100 and 48%, respectively. Other pathogens were detected in group I as shown in Table 3. Some respiratory viruses were detected in Group II. All other respiratory pathogens had sensitivity and specificity lower than B. pertussis. Pathogens were detected by PCR in 31 out of 38 (82%) cases and 10 out of 21 (48%) cases in Group I and Group II, respectively. This difference was significant (p = 0.01). \n\n\n\nDetection of B. pertussis by PCR was indicated on the basis of clinical presentation and PPV of 100% was obtained. However, 21 out of 38 cases that met the clinical definition of pertussis were negative for B. pertussis. Therefore, either the B. pertussis PCR gave false-negative results or the definition gave a false-positive result. Different sample types have different sensitivities, with NPAs being the most sensitive. PCR can also give false-negative results and fewer diagnoses in those patients with pertussis could be due to the quality of the sample.\n\nOther pathogens were detected in 31 out of 38 patients with clinical diagnosis of pertussis. Other pathogens that cause a pertussis-like disease have previously been described using serological assays and Cherry et al. describe that pertussis can be misdiagnosed, as there are a number of viral and bacterial pathogens other than B. pertussis that can cause a paroxysmal cough [1, 2]. It has been well described that PCR is more sensitive than culture at detecting B. pertussis in the acute phase [3]. The use of PCR for diagnosis would help improve microbiological diagnosis, improve the speed of results, and reduce the need for the reliance on imperfect clinical criteria for diagnosis. This would prompt more appropriate treatment of B. pertussis and other atypical bacteria, differentiating them from viral infections as well as use of vaccination to prevent spread of pertussis.\n\nIn conclusion, multiplex PCR in a combined approach identifies B. pertussis and other pathogens causing pertussis-like symptoms and use of this form of diagnosis might help in treatment and improve management of patients."}
