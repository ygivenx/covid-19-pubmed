{"title": "Triterpenoids from the stems of Tripterygium regelii", "body": "Triterpenoids naturally occurring in the plant kingdom are one of the largest groups of natural products [1] . Until now, it has been reported that some of them exhibited a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as antitumor, antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, cardiotonic, gastroprotective and analgesic effects, etc. [2] [3] [4] . More importantly, some triterpenoids or their derivatives are promising candidates or lead compounds for the development of future drugs due to their therapeutic potential [3, 5, 6] .\n\nThe plants in Tripterygium genus of family Celastraceae are well known for a rich source of triterpenoids. Many triterpenes isolated from this genus, showed various promising bioactivities. Celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene isolated from Tripterygium plants [7] [8] [9] , exhibited potent anticancer activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines [4] , anti-inflammatory [10] and neuroprotective effects [10, 11] . Recently, it has been reported to be used as a powerful anti-obesity agent [12] . In addition, celastrol, pristimerin, tingenone, iguesterin and dihydrocelastrol showed SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory activity [13] .\n\nTripterygium regelii, which is distributed throughout northeast China, Korea and Japan [14] , has been used as a folk medicine in China for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, jaundice, swelling, etc. [15] . A few previous studies [9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] have shown that terpenoids were the principal constituents of T. regelii. Recently, we have reported the isolation of twelve new dihydro-\u03b2-agarofuran sesquiterpenoids from its stems [21] . As a part of our ongoing phytochemical investigation, three new triterpenoids and twenty known analogues were isolated and characterized from the stems of T. regelii. Herein, we reported the isolation and characterization of three novel triterpenoids (1-3) and (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , as well as a cytotoxic evaluation of nine selected triterpenes against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.\n\nOptical rotations and ultraviolet (UV) spectra were measured using a Rudolph Research Analytical Autopol I automatic polarimeter and a Beckman Coulter DU\u00ae 800 spectrophotometer (USA), respectively. HRMS spectra were performed on an Agilent 6230 electrospray ionization (ESI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (USA). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired with a Bruker Ascend 600 NMR spectrometer in CDCl 3 and pyridine-d 5 using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. Chemical shifts were given in \u03b4 (ppm), and coupling constants (J) were expressed in hertz (Hz). Preparative HPLC was carried out on a Waters liquid chromatography system equipped with 1525 Binary HPLC Pump and 2489 UV/ Visible detector using a Waters Xbridge Prep C 8 column (10 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm). Semi-preparative HPLC was conducted on an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system coupled with a quaternary pump and a diode array detector (DAD) using a Waters Xbridge Prep C 18 column (10 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm). Silica gel (40-60 \u03bcm, Grace, USA) and Bondapak Waters ODS (40-63 \u03bcm, Waters, USA) were used for column chromatographies. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) used to monitor fractions was performed on precoated silica gel 60 F 254 plates and TLC silica gel 60 RP-18 F 254S plates (200 \u03bcm thick, Merck KGaA, Germany). Spots on the TLC were visualized by UV light (254 nm) or heating after spraying with 5% H 2 SO 4 in ethanol. \n\nThe dried and ground stems of T. regelii (8.0 kg) were extracted with methanol (64 L \u00d7 3) under ultrasonic assistance at room temperature for 1 h. After evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, a dark brown residue was suspended in H 2 O, and then sequentially partitioned with n-hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol. The EtOAc-soluble extract (150.0 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel eluting with PE-acetone (100:0-35:65, v/v) to yield thirteen fractions (Fr.1-Fr.13).\n\nThe fraction Fr.5 (5.0 g) was separated by a silica gel column using a gradient of n-hexane-EtOAc (100:0-50:50, v/v) to produce eight fractions (Fr.5-1 \u2212 Fr.5-8). The fraction Fr.5-7 (71.1 mg) was chromatographed over an ODS column with a gradient of CH 3 OH \u2212 H 2 O (60:40-100:0, v/v) to afford compound 8 (5.0 mg). The fraction Fr.7 (5.4 g) was subjected to an ODS column using a gradient system of CH 3 OH \u2212 H 2 O (50:50-100:0, v/v) to afford nine fractions (Fr.7-1 \u2212 Fr.7-9). The fraction Fr.7-5 (120.5 mg) was further separated by preparative HPLC using an isocratic solvent system of CH 3 CN \u2212 H 2 O (70: 30 , v/v) as mobile phase to yield compound 7 (1.5 mg). The fraction Fr.8 (5.0 g) was subjected to an ODS column with a gradient condition of CH 3 OH \u2212 H 2 O (50:50-100:0) to product nine fractions (Fr.8-1-Fr.8-9). The fraction Fr.8-3 (264.9 mg) was purified by semi-preparative HPLC using CH 3 CN \u2212 H 2 O (68:32, v/v) as mobile phase to give compound 6 (4.3 mg). The fraction Fr.8-4 (500.9 mg) was isolated by preparative HPLC using CH 3 (425.1 mg) was subjected to a silica gel column with a solvent system of PE \u2212 EtOAc (90:10-65: 35 , v/v), and purified using an ODS column with a gradient of MeOH \u2212 H 2 O (70:30-100:0, v/v) to give compound 5 (60.0 mg). Compound 21 (28.3 mg) was obtained from fraction Fr.8-8 (80.5 mg) by using a silica gel column eluted sequentially with PE \u2212 EtOAc (90:10-60:40) solvent system. The fraction Fr.11 (5.5 g) was fractionated over an ODS column with a gradient system of CH 3 \n\nHuman breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium-F12 medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Exponentially growing cells were plated in a 96-well microplate at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 3 cells per well in 100 \u03bcL of culture medium and were allowed to adhere for 24 h before drug treatment. Then, the cells were treated with either fresh medium containing 0.1% DMSO or fresh medium containing 10 \u03bcM of triterpenes or paclitaxel (Taxol\u00ae), and incubated for another 24 h in a 5% CO 2 humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. A volume of 10 \u03bcL MTT saline solution (5 mg/mL) was added into each well for further 4 h of incubation. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcL of lysing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were added into each well, and the 96-well microplate was kept overnight at room temperature. The absorbance of resulting solution in each well was colorimetrically determined at 570 nm by using a microplate reader (Infinite 200 PRO, Tecan). The inhibitory rate of compounds on cell proliferation was defined as (1 -absorbance of the drug-treated cells/ absorbance of the vehicle control cells) \u00d7 100%.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 16.0 for Windows. The significance of difference among the experimental groups and controls was assessed by one-way ANOVA and Post hoc Bonferroni test. The results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments. Significance was accepted at a level of p b 0.05.\n\nThe EtOAc-soluble fraction of methanolic extract of the stems of T. regelii was repeatedly subjected to silica gel and ODS columns, and then purified by preparative and/or semi-preparative HPLC to yield three new triterpenoids (1-3 (Table 1 ) displayed 29 carbon signals, including signals of a carboxylic carbon (\u03b4c 182.7, C-29), a conjugated ester carbonyl carbon (\u03b4c 163.8, C-2), three double bonds, six quaternary carbons (including a ketal one), one methine, seven methylenes, and seven methyl groups (including an oxygenated one), which were accounted for five degrees of unsaturation. These characteristic data suggested 1 to be a dinor-friedelene derivative with five rings [22] [23] [24] . Comparison of the 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 1 with those of dzununcanone [22, 24] , a 3,24-dinor-2,4-seco-friedelene triterpene, indicated both compounds bearing similar B-, C-, D-and E-rings. The downfield shift of C-29 (\u03b4c 182.7) in 1 relative to that (\u03b4c 179.1) in dzununcanone [22, 24] implied a carboxylic acid group present at C-29 in 1 instead of the methyl ester in dzununcanone. The remaining signals of 1 showed a olefinic carbon (\u03b4c 110.3, C-1), a conjugated carbonyl carbon (\u03b4c 163.8, C-2), a ketal carbon (\u03b4c 103.8, C-4), a tertiary methyl (\u03b4c 24.8, C-23) and a methoxyl (\u03b4c 50.5) groups. The upfield shift of the C-2 carbonyl (\u03b4c 163.8) in 1 relative to that (\u03b4c 166.1) in dzununcanone revealed that an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated \u03b4-lactone ring was formed between C-2 and C-4 in 1, accounting for the remaining one degree of unsaturation. Both the methoxyl and the tertiary methyl groups were assigned at C-4, as deduced from HMBC correlations from their protons to C-4 (\u03b4 C 103.8) in 1. Thus, the planar structure of 1 was established as a 2, 4-esterified derivative of dzununcanone, which was further confirmed by 1 H \u2212 1 H COSY and HMBC correlations ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nThe relative configuration of 1 was determined by analysis of ROESY spectrum (Fig. 2B) . The observed key correlation between C-4 methoxy protons and H 3 -25\u03b2 indicated that the methoxyl group at C-4 was \u03b2oriented. The remaining stereogenic centers in 1 were assigned as the same relative configurations with those in dzununcanone, as evidenced from the important ROESY correlations of H 3 -25/H 3 -26, H 3 -26/H 3 -28, and H 3 -28/H 3 -30. Therefore, the structure of 1 was characterized as shown in Fig. 1, and (Table 1) of 2 are closely similar to those of 1 except for the downfield shifts of C-4 and C-23 (\u03b4 C 105.6 and 28.2) relative to those (\u03b4 C 103.8 and 24.8) in 1. These data were indicative of different configuration of the C-4 stereogenic center of both compounds. Moreover, a key ROESY correlation between H 3 -23 and H 3 -25\u03b2 was observed, revealing an \u03b1-orientation of the methoxy group at C-4. Therefore, the structure of 2 was elucidated as a 4-epimer of 1, and given a trivial name of triregelolide B.\n\nCompound 3 was obtained as amorphous powder. The molecular formula was determined as C 30 (Table 1 ) of 3 showed 30 carbon signals, which were ascribed to a carboxylic group (\u03b4 C 182.2, C-29), two olefinic carbons [\u03b4 C 158.4 (C-14) and 117.1 (C-15)], five methines (including two oxygenated ones), six quaternary carbons, nine methylenes, and seven methyl carbons by DEPT and HMBC experiments. These characteristic signals indicated that 3 was a taraxerene-type triterpene [25] [26] [27] . The 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 3 were very similar to those of esculentoic acid A [26] isolated from Manihot esculenta, except for the presence of an additional oxygenated methine [\u03b4 H 4.13 (1H, td, J = 9.6, 4.2 Hz, H-2); \u03b4 C 68.6] and the absence of a methylene signals (\u03b4 H 1.78 and 1.60; \u03b4 C 25.3) in esculentoic acid A [26] . The downfield shift of H-2 at \u03b4 H 4.13 suggested hydroxylation of C-2 in 3 compared to those (\u03b4 H 1.78 and 1.60) in esculentoic acid A [26] . The coupling constant of 9.6 Hz between H-2 and H-3 (J 2, 3 ) indicated a 2,3-trans diaxial relationship of the above two protons in 3, whereas the H-3 was in a equatorial bond in esculentoic acid due to a smaller J 2, 3 of 2.8 Hz. The key NOESY correlations of H-2/H 3 -25\u03b2, and H-3/H-5\u03b1 suggested an \u03b1oriented hydroxyl group at C-2 and a \u03b2-oriented hydroxyl group at C-3 in 3. Thus, the structure of 3 was determined as 2\u03b1, 3\u03b2dihydroxytaraxer-14-ene-29-oic acid, and named triregeloic acid.\n\nIn addition, twenty known triterpenoids were also isolated and identified as NST6A (4) [28] , celastrol (5) [29, 30] , 22\u03b2-hydroxytingenone (6) [31] , triptocalline A (7) [32] , polpunonic acid (8) [33] , orthophenic acid (9) [31] , demethylzeylasteral (10) [30] , wilforol A (11) [31] , regelin D (12) [19] , triptotriterpenic acid B (13) [34, 35] , \u204e All compounds except for 21, showed significant (p b 0.05) inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells compared to the vehicle control group. The value of p b 0.001 when statistical comparison was conducted between either compound 5 or 6 with taxol. a Other triterpenes were not evaluated for cytotoxicity due to the limited amount obtained. b The inhibitory rate (%) on MCF-7 cells was determined at a drug concentration of 10 \u03bcM."}
