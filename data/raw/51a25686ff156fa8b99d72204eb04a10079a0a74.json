{"title": "", "body": "Pancreatic disease has been associated with primary endocrine conditions in several animal species, but is uncommonly identified in horses, possibly due to non-specific clinical signs and a lack of specific biochemical markers. The objective of this prospective study was to assess whether plasmatic DGGR-Lipase activity could detect pancreatic disease secondary to equine endocrine conditions. Fifty four cases presenting or two endocrine diseases (PPID*, n 5 24; EMS**, n 5 9; and/or hypertriglyceridaemia, n 5 23) and 99 healthy control horses were included between 2015 and 2017. Results were compared using a Mann and Whitney test with a level of significance set at 0.05.\n\nThe reference range for plasmatic DGGR-Lipase activity in the control group was 3-22 U/L. The median plasmatic DGGR-Lipase activity was 15 [6-539] in PPID, in U/L in hypertriglyceridaemic horses, respectively. Nine horses had an increased activity of the DGGR-Lipase (> 22 U/L) and concurrently presented digestive conditions.\n\nLipase activity was statistically different between diseased horses and controls, in hypertriglyceridaemic horses compared to controls, in PPID horses versus controls and in diseased horses with digestive signs compared to diseased horses without digestive signs. Excluding cases also affected with a digestive condition (n 5 21), plasmatic lipase concentration was still significantly higher, but within the reference range in the diseased horses compared to controls.\n\nPancreatic disease may not be significant in the studied population. Further studies with a larger number of cases are warranted to assess the reliability of plasmatic-Lipase activity in confirming and/or ruling out pancreatitis in association with primary endocrine diseases.\n\nObjectives: To describe the physicochemical parameters of diarrheic horses with an apparently normal acid-base state (based on normal venous pH, pCO 2 and Base excess) and to determine the prevalence of mixed metabolic acid-base (AB) disorders in these patients.\n\nMethods: Complete computerized heparinized venous blood gases, electrolytes and total proteins [TP] (g/L) of 30 diarrheic horses with normal pH (7.41 6 0.03), PCO 2 (42 6 4.5 mmHg), and Base excess (BE) (1-7 mM/L) were recorded. AB disorders in horses were defined when variables were outside of the following reference ranges: Base excess (1-7 mM/L), [HCO 3 ] (24-34 mM/L), AG (<16 mM/L); strong ion difference (SID) 5 [(Na 1 1 K 1 ) 2 (Cl 2 1 L-Lactate 2 )] (38-47 mM/L), total concentration of non-volatile buffers (A tot ) 5 0.22 3 TP (g/L) (11-16 mM/L), and Unmeasured Strong Anions (USA) 5 A tot /1 1 10 (6.65-pH) 2 SID 2 HCO 2 3 (22 to 3 mM/L). Results: Of the 30 horses included, 47% (14/30) had SID AB disorders. Single metabolic AB disorders identified in diarrheic horses included strong ion acidosis (6/14; 43%) and USA acidosis (1/14; 7%). Detected mixed metabolic AB disorders were SID acidosis and A tot alkalosis (5/14; 36%), and USA acidosis and A tot alkalosis (1/14; 7%).\n\nDiscussion: Hidden mixed metabolic AB disorders in horses were characterized by the acidifying effect of low SID, with concurrent alkalinizing effect of hypoproteinemia (hypoproteinemic alkalosis and low SID acidosis classically and concurrently seen in diarrheic horses).\n\nConclusion: Physicochemical approach can detect underlying mixed metabolic disorders in horses with apparently normal AB balance.\n\nSignificance: In addition to venous pH, PCO 2 , HCO 3 and BE, clinicians should use the physicochemical approach to identified hidden AB disorders in diarrheic horses.\n\nKey words: Bicarbonate; pH; Physicochemical approach; SID; Strong ions. Methods: Faecal samples from two groups of adult horses, foals and donkeys were tested for equine coronavirus RNA using quantitative PCR. Group one consisted of 156 faecal samples for which the submitting vet requested ECoV testing while the second group was comprised of 225 faecal samples from horses with no clinical suspicion of ECoV infection. The N protein gene from one positive case was sequenced.\n\nResults: Equine coronavirus was detected in samples from three yearlings and one adult horse from group one, all other faecal samples tested qPCR-negative. The three Thoroughbred yearlings, from the same premises, were diagnosed with and successfully treated for concurrent larval cyathostomiasis. The adult horse, a cob from a different premises, presented with inappetence, lethargy, pyrexia and leucopaenia and made a full recovery with supportive care. Partial sequencing of viral RNA from the adult horse showed 99% homology with previously reported ECoV strains from the USA and Japan.\n\nDiscussion: ECoV was detected in small numbers of horses in which there was clinical suspicion of disease. The clinical signs in the adult horse were similar to reported cases in other countries. In the three younger horses, coronavirus may have played a role as a coinfection or been an incidental finding.\n\nConclusions: This is the first reported molecular detection of ECoV from horses in the UK.\n\nSignificance: ECoV is present in the UK and should be considered as a potential pathogen. Magnesium is used as a food supplement in human diabetes patients and may be beneficial in horses with insulin resistance as well.\n\nSo far, magnesium supplementation (30 mg/kg) is routinely used in high performance horses but dose-effect relations have not been determined.\n\nTherefore in this study the magnesium concentration in blood lymphocytes, serum, urine and the fractional excretion in the urine were measured in five horses before and after oral supplementation for seven days with 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg magnesium as magnesiumaspartatehydrochloride (MAH). All horses were exclusively fed with hay, its magnesium concentration was measured each week. All horses were examined daily, including signs of colic and soft feces.\n\nThere were no significant changes in the magnesium concentration in the diet. Signs of colic, soft feces or other side effects were not observed. The serum magnesium concentration after supplementation with 60 mg/kg magnesium as MAH was significantly higher than the baseline (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and exceeded the reference range in four of five horses. After 15 and 30 mg/kg magnesium as MAH the serum magnesium concentration showed a significant increase over time (Friedman test). Neither a significant increase of the intracellular magnesium concentration nor significant changes in urine magnesium concentration and fractional excretion were observed.\n\nThe dosages of 15 and 30 mg/kg magnesium as MAH require a longer supplementation and observation period but seem so far effective to raise the serum magnesium concentration and safe to use. 60 mg/kg magnesium as MAH could lead to side effects after long-term supplementation.\n\nKey words: Food supplementation; Magnesiumaspartatehydrochloride; Magnesium supplementation.\n\nThe objective of this study was to validate the use of an acoustic ECG monitor (AudicorV R ) in healthy horses. The device provides an inexpensive, non-invasive, examiner-independent method combining a Holter ECG and a phonocardiogram to record ECG variables and indices of mechanical activity and hemodynamics of the heart. We aimed to establish device usability, test-retest reliability and normal reference intervals.\n\nA 10-second snapshot and a 12-hour overnight recording were obtained in 123 healthy Warmbloods. The following variables were measured: Electromechanical activating time (EMAT, ms), ratecorrected EMATc (%), left ventricular systolic time (LVST, ms), ratecorrected LVSTc (%), intensity and persistence of the third and fourth heart sound (S3, S4), QRS duration, and rate-corrected QTc interval. The association with age and sex was investigated. Triplicate recordings in 10 horses were used to assess test-retest variability.\n\nAudicorV R recordings were feasible in all horses and reference intervals were calculated. Age and sex did not significantly influence variables. Test-retest variability was very low to low (CV: 0.7-7.7%) for overnight recordings but varied between very low and high for snapshots (CV: 3.5-43.1%).\n\nIn conclusion, this study shows that overnight AudicorV R recordings are feasible and provide potentially useful indices of cardiac performance. Snapshots representing the point-of-care application of the method are highly variable and may be of limited clinical value, whereas 12 hours overnight recordings provide reliable data. Future studies will need to focus on horses with heart disease to establish the clinical value of the AudicorV R method to assess cardiac performance and to diagnose cardiac disease. Objectives: To examine for possible associations between outbreaks of liver disease and presence of mycotoxins in forage.\n\nMethods: Forage samples were subject to analysis for 37 different mycotoxins. Forage sources were either from CASE premises where at least 3 horses had been confirmed to be suffering from hepatic disease based on increased hepatic enzymes and/or liver biopsy; or from CON-TROL premises where at least 3 horses had been subject to blood testing which revealed no increase in hepatic enzymes.\n\nResults: Forage samples were analysed from 29 CASE premises and 12 CONTROL premises. Mycotoxins were found in 21/29 (72%) CASE samples and 9/12 (75%) CONTROL samples. Mycotoxins found only in CASE and not CONTROL samples comprised single CASES (3%) with aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin G1, methylergonovine, verruculogen, wortmannin, zearalenone, 2-bromo-alpha-ergocryptine and nivalenol; 2 CASES (7%) with 15 AcDon and deoxynivalenol; and 9 CASES (31%) with fumonisin B1. Aflatoxins B2 and G2 were found in both case and control samples.\n\nDiscussion: Previous publications have associated hepatic disease with aflatoxin and fumonisin consumption. In this study there was no clear association between aflatoxin contamination of forage with liver disease, but fumonisin B1 was seen in 9/29 (31%) CASE premises at between 81.4 and 3,175 microg/kg forage.\n\nConclusions: Examination of hay samples from CASE and CON-TROL premises raises suspicions of fumonisin B1 as a possible cause of some outbreaks of hepatopathy.\n\nSignificance: Changes of forage or even mycotoxin adsorbants might be helpful in the management of some outbreaks of hepatic disease in horses.\n\nKey words: Liver outbreak forage mycotoxins. Objectives: Recently, equine hepacivirus (EqHV) was identified in donkey serum samples. The objective was to prove that equine hepacivirus harvested from infected horse serum was able to infect adult donkeys and to characterize the course of infection.\n\nMethods: In a prospective study two adult female donkeys and one control horse were inoculated intravenously with purified EqHV from a naturally infected horse. Animals underwent daily clinical examinations and blood was drawn at weekly intervals for 15 weeks. Haematological data, GLDH, GGT, AST and fibrinogen were evaluated. In serum anti-NS3-EqHV antibodies were analysed by luciferase immunoprecipitation assay and viral load was quantified using real-time PCR. Liver biopsies were taken before inoculation and after EqHV PCR positivity in serum.\n\nResults: All animals were EqHV PCR positive from 3 days post inoculation (maximal viral load 9.9 3 10 5 to 3.5 3 10 6 /mL). Both donkeys cleared the virus from the blood by week 12. Antibodies against EqHV NS3 were detectable in all animals from week 5, 6, or 7, respectively, until week 9 (horse) or 15 (donkeys). Histopathologically no significant differences were observed in the liver tissue before and one to two weeks after infection. Infection did not have an impact on the clinical findings of the animals. Blood biochemistry revealed a mild increase in GLDH at the time of seroconversion in both donkeys.\n\nDiscussion, Conclusions and Significance: EqHV is capable of infecting distinct hosts within the genus equus. In the two donkeys studied, the course of infection was similar to the infection pattern observed in horses. Objects: PON-1 is a negative acute phase protein already used in human and veterinary medicine and mainly produced in the liver. Recently, a paraoxon-based method for the measurement of PON-1 in horses has been validated and references intervals (RIs) in healthy horses and foals have been established (38.1-80.8 U/mL). In other species, PON-1 activity is low in newborns. No information on PON-1 activity in newborn foals, which are often affected by inflammatory conditions, is available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate PON-1 activity in newborn healthy foals and to verify age related variations.\n\nMethods: To this aim, we measured PON-1 in serum collected from 12 healthy foals at day 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 with the already validated paraoxon-based method.\n\nResults: PON-1 activity is low at birth (22.8 6 8.4 U/mL), and increases at day 1 (26.2 6 8.4 U/mL), day 2 (31.2 6 8.3 U/mL), day 3 (41.6 6 9.1 U/mL), day 7 (72.6 6 17.6 U/mL) and day 14 (80.7 6 20.8 U/mL), with significant differences (P < 0.05) among each age group.\n\nDiscussion: These results confirm that PON-1 activity is low in the first days of life and increases with aging.\n\nConclusions: This information is important to not overdiagnose sepsis in newborns only based on low PON-1 activity, if compared with reference intervals of adults or foals Significance: The next steps will be to establish reference intervals for the first days of life and to evaluate PON-1 activity in foals with sepsis in order to assess whether PON-1 may be used as diagnostic marker of sepsis.\n\nKey words: Age; Newborn foal; Serum paraoxonase-1.\n\nObjectives: To examine the diagnostic value of a novel qPCR assay designed to detect equine dermatophyte infections Methods: A qPCR assay was designed to detect targets within chitin sythetase and beta-tubulin genes considered to be specific for dermatophyte species including those known to affect equids. The assay was used on stored frozen hair/skin samples which had previously been subject to culture using Saboraud's agar (SAB) and also prospectively in freshly submitted samples of hair/skin that were also subject to culture on SAB. Six different DNA extraction methods were used over time.\n\nResults: A total of 265 samples (61 stored, 204 fresh) were examined. Of 53 culture1 samples, 52 were PCR1. The single culture1/ PCR-sample was stored sample where insufficient sample remained to reexamine with subsequent improved extraction methods. Of 82 PCR1 samples, 30 were culture1. Of 182 samples negative by culture and PCR, 173 were clinical specimens and 9 were from horses with no signs of skin disease.\n\nDiscussion: Compared to culture, PCR was found to have a sensitivity of at least 98.1%. PCR applied to normal hair revealed specificity of 100%. Compared to PCR, culture on SAB had a sensitivity of 36.6%.\n\nConclusions: The qPCR assay was found to have very high sensitivity and specificity for dermatophytosis in horses. Culture on SAB may fail to identify approximately 63% of dermatophytosis cases. The DNA extraction method was found to be a crucial step.\n\nSignificance: The qPCR assay offers a rapid and accurate means of identifying dermatophyte infections in horses. Objectives: Recent studies have shown the diagnostic value of miRNA fingerprints in whole blood of human patients with cancer. In this study we investigated the use of whole blood miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for monitoring of disease dynamics in equine sarcoid (ES) affected horses.\n\nMethods: 5 horses with spontaneous regression, 5 horses with progression of ES disease and 5 control horses were included in this longitudinal study. Whole blood samples taken at the initial presentation were used as input material for high throughput sequencing (HiSeq3000, Illumina). Clinical outcome was reevaluated after 5-7 years.\n\nResults: 14 differentially expressed miRNAs which are accounted for control condition were identified with an adjusted P-value <0.05 and a fold change of >2 and up to 6 in either direction in the regression vs. progression group. 4 miRNAs (28.6%) were upregulated and 10 miRNAs (71.4%) were downregulated in whole blood of horses with regression of ES disease.\n\nDiscussion: miRNA deregulation seems to be associated with phenotype aggressiveness of ES disease. The direct targets of downregulated genes are top sarcoma biomarker-disease associations according to GeneGo disease Ontology (MetaCore TM software suite). The direct targets of upregulated genes show enrichment in network processes like Cell cycle_G0-G1, DNA damage_Core and DNA damage_MMR repair.\n\nConclusion: Whole blood miRNA fingerprints may allow to predict prognosis in ES-affected horses.\n\nSignificance: Non-invasive prognostic biomarkers for ES disease might be promising for prepurchase exams of ES-affected horses and decision-making whether or not treatment should be initiated.\n\nKey words: Biomarker; Equine oncology; Equine sarcoid; microRNA. Objectives: To characterize faecal microbiota of horses with atypical myopathy (AM) compared with healthy co-grazers (HcG).\n\nMethods: Fresh faecal samples were obtained from 6 horses (1 stallion, 3 geldings and 2 females; mean age of 11.8 6 10 years) with confirmed AM and 6 HcG (4 geldings and 2 females; mean age of 13.6 6 8 years) during autumn-2016 and spring-2017 AM outbreaks in Belgium.\n\nBacterial taxonomy profiling obtained by 16S amplicon sequencing of faeces was used to identify differentially distributed bacterial taxa between AM and HcG. Results were statistically compared using Welch's t-test with STAMP software.\n\nResults: A total of 90,407 sequences were analysed and clustered to 8,066 operational taxonomic units. Bacterial populations were distributed between 17 phylas, although 20% of sequences could not be attributed to an existing phylum.\n\nHorses with AM harboured a significantly higher relative abundance of Ruminococcaeae family with a significantly lower Lachnospiraceae when compared to HcG.\n\nDiscussion: AM is caused by hypoglycin A intoxication, but only a part of horses pasturing in the same toxic environment develops the pathology, suggesting that there may be protective factors at the horse level. The results of this study show significant differences in faecal microbiota between AM cases and HcG, which could suggest that microbiota could play a role in the development or prevention of clinical disease.\n\nConclusions: Results demonstrate that microbiota of AM affected horses is significantly different compared to HcG.\n\nSignificance: Microbiome could influence the development of AM, but this role deserves further investigation. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a method for the recovery of respiratory secretion from the lower airways and alveoli. It is used primarily for cytological evaluation of non-septic conditions, and is especially helpful when severe equine asthma, mild equine asthma or exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) is suspected. Some clinicians have observed by endoscopy that in some horses the sampled bronchus collapses when vacuum is applied to retrieve the BAL fluid, and thereby reducing the amount of recovered fluid. Poor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) recovery has been observed in horses with moderate to severe inflammation. The objective of this study was to investigate if the administration of a single dose of a bronchodilator in equine patients with a suspicion of severe equine asthma could help in improving recovery of BALF. A total of 15 horses with severe equine asthma were evaluated: 6 horses were once pretreated 30 minutes before BAL with 0.001 mg/kg of inhaled salbutamol, while 9 horses was not treated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with BAL-catheter by instilling 300-350 mL of warm sterile saline, using 60 mL syringes. Amount of recovered fluid was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed Student T-test using Excel. Mean BALF recovery in treated group was 53.9%, while in not-treated group 35.61% (P < 0.05). We can conclude that single pretreatment with salbutamol in horses with severe equine asthma improve the volume of recovered fluid after BAL, therefore clinicians should consider such procedure before performing BAL on horses with suspicion of bronchoconstriction. Strangles is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (S. equi) and is a highly contagious disease with numerous outbreaks every year. Questions remain after an outbreak; what is the optimal duration of quarantine? How and when should stables and materials be cleaned and disinfected in an ideal situation? The purpose of this study was 1) obtain knowledge about how S. equi survives on various materials and 2) identify efficient methods to disinfect contaminated equipment.\n\nThis study was divided into two parts; in the first, stables' equipment was contaminated with S. equi and samples were obtained in intervals or after using different cleaning protocols. In the second part, in stables with strangles outbreak, samples were obtained from the environment approximately three weeks after the horses were clinically healthy and analysed for S. equi with culture and q-PCR.\n\nResults showed that S. equi survives about three weeks in filled water buckets indoors, but dies within four days on wooden posts outdoors in summer weather. Contaminated plastic \"twitches\" needed rigorous disinfection to ensure negative results on both culture and q-PCR. The results from stables showed that bacteria can exist in horses' environment even weeks after they are clinically healthy.\n\nThis results confirm that S. equi can survive a substantial time outside the host animal and the indirect route therefore has an import and role in the infectivity. Findings from this study can help decrease the number of future outbreaks.\n\nKey words: Strangles contamination; Twitches; Wooden posts. Reason for performing study: Endoscopic examinations are essential for diagnostics and treatment of strangles (S. equi infection) in horses. However practitioners are often reluctant to use their endoscopes for this purpose, due to concern that, even after cleaning and disinfection, their endoscopes may retain both live S. equi bacteria and bacterial DNA.\n\nObjectives: This study evaluated the efficacy of four different disinfectant methods to eliminate S. equi from videoendoscopes.\n\nMethods: Videoendoscopes were contaminated with standardized S. equi broth solutions then disinfected following four different protocols. Three field situation protocols using various disinfectants for manual cleaning (Group A: ethanol, Group B: 2-aminoethanol and didecyldimethylammoniumchloride, Group C: isopropyl alcohol, an enzyme-based solution then disinfected with orthophtaldehyde. Group D used a commercial endoscope washing machine (Getinge). After each protocol 50 mL of distillated water was flushed through the endoscopes biopsy channel and analyzed by bacterial culture and qPCR for S. equi. Each group had six replicates.\n\nResults: Only a single positive bacterial culture was detected, being in group A (1/6). Regarding qPCR all samples in group A (6/6) were positive, whereas for group B, C and D 5/6, 2/6 and 1/6, respectively, were positive.\n\nConclusions: While most disinfection methods eliminate live S. equi, none, including commercial endoscope washers ensured complete removal of S. equi DNA as detected by qPCR. Thus, while the risk of retention of live S. equi following endoscope cleaning appears low, even with machine washing these instruments can contribute to false positives on qPCR when screening horses for strangles. Methods: Live cultures of Strep equi were inoculated onto various sites and equipment comprising an outdoor fence post, a piece of plain wood (indoors), the sole of a shoe, cotton overalls, inside a nasogastric tube, a dental rasp and the bottom of a wet plastic bucket. Repeated sampling from each site was then conducted followed by attempts to culture Strep equi from the collected samples. The study was performed initially during the summer and then repeated in the winter.\n\nResults: The longest recorded survival time was 34 days in a wet bucket in winter. Survival was not recorded beyond 9 days in the summer (in a stomach tube).\n\nDiscussion: Maximum bacterial survival times and growth scores varied markedly depending on the inoculation site and time of year. Bacterial survival was clearly favoured by a wet environment and by the winter.\n\nConclusions: The study confirms that Strep equi is generally a fragile organism that does not survive well outside the horse. However, given protection by wet and cold conditions there is the potential for more prolonged environmental survival with the possibility of contagion to susceptible horses.\n\nSignificance: Disinfection protocols during and following a strangles outbreak should be particularly vigilant towards wet sites, especially during cold weather.\n\nKey words: Strangles environment survival Streptococcus equi. Objectives: Equine Atypical Myopathy can be caused by consumption of seedlings of Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore) trees, which are widespread in pastures in Europe. However, optimal pasture management to avoid toxicity is unclear. Here we evaluated the effect of mowing and herbicidal spraying on hypoglycin A (HGA) concentration in dying sycamore seedlings.\n\nMethods: Seedlings from 6 locations were assigned to 2 groups: mowing (n 5 4) and herbicidal (dimethylamine) treatment (n 5 2). Seedlings were collected before intervention and at 48 hours, 1 and 2 weeks later. Mowed seedlings were cut at mid-stem length with surrounding grass and left on pasture. Seedlings in the herbicide experiment were sprayed according to the manufacturer's instructions and left to wither. HGA concentrations were measured by a validated LC-MS method and expressed on a dry matter basis.\n\nResults: There were no significant differences in HGA concentration between time points in either group: HGA concentration remained high: 272 (199-2,110) ug/g [median (range) ]. HGA concentration increased significantly in grass cuttings from undetectable (time zero) to 17.4 (1.6) ug/g [mean 1/-SD] (P 5 0.0002), after 1 week in the mowing group.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion: Neither mowing nor herbicidal spraying reduces HGA concentration in sycamore seedlings up to 2 weeks after intervention. Cross contamination is possible between grass and sycamore seedlings when mowed together.\n\nSignificance: Mowing and collection of sycamore seedlings seems necessary to avoid possible HGA toxicity in horses grazing pasture contaminated with sycamore seedlings. Seedlings and/or grass cuttings from affected pastures should not be fed to horses, even if they have dried or been sprayed with herbicide.\n\nKey words: Atypical myopathy; Hypoglycin; Pasture management; Seedlings.\n\nCo-oximetry is the gold standard method of measurement of hemoglobin species and is useful in the determination of the oxygenation status in different species.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of time after sampling on co-oximetry measurements of equine blood samples and the effects of adding ascorbic acid and methylene blue to samples with in-vitro induced methemoglobinemia.\n\nA total of 30 healthy horses were sampled. Co-oximetry was measured repeatedly on venous and arterial blood samples stored in ice water up to 48 hours after sampling. Sodium nitrite was added to 17 blood samples to produce methemoglobin. Six samples were used as controls, 6 had ascorbic acid (AscAc.) added and 5 had methylene blue (MetBlue) added. Parameters measured included total hemoglobin (TotHb), oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2 ), carboxyhemoglobin (CO 2 Hb), metahemoglobin (MetHb), oxygen carrying capacity (O 2 Cap), oxygen content (O 2 Ct) and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SO 2 ).\n\nOxyhemoglobin and SO 2 increased over time from 69.8 6 10.2% and 90 6 3 to 82.8 6 7.9% and 99 6 3, respectively, after 8 hours (mean 6 SD, P < 0.001). There was an effect of treatment (P 5 0.032) and of time (interaction P 5 0.003) on % MetHb. In samples with %MetHb ranging from 4 to 73% at time 0, changes in %MetHb were as follows: 9.8 6 6.51%, 20.12 6 0.96% and 24.86 6 1.55% at 48 hours in Control, AscAc. and MetBlue groups, respectively (P < 0.05). There was no effect of time on %MetHb in the AscAc. group (34.23 6 32.16% at time 0 to 34.12 6 33.91% after 48 hours).\n\nStorage of blood in ice water to determine HbO 2 and SO 2 using a cooximeter should not exceed 4 hours. Measurement of %MetHb could be delayed by up to 48 hours if ascorbic acid is added to the sample. Methylene blue significantly decreased %MetHb over time compared to untreated control samples.\n\nKey words: Blood gases; Carboxyhemoglobin; Dyshemoglobinemia; Methemoglobinemia; Reduced hemoglobin. Objectives: Circulating, cell-free miRNAs have been proposed as a new promising class of cancer biomarkers due to their high stability in plasma and serum. The goal of the study was to identify equine sarcoid (ES) disease-specific serum profiles.\n\nMethods: A case-control study was conducted to identify differences in serum miRNA expression profiles between 6 ES-affected and 5 control horses using high throughput sequencing (HiSeq3000, Illumina).\n\nResults: 121 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified with an adjusted P-value <0.05 and a fold change of >2 and up to 6 in either direction. 42 miRNAs (34.7%) were upregulated and 79 miRNAs (65.3%) were downregulated in serum of ES-horses. Among the most significantly deregulated miRNAs are novel equine miRNA 13_4442, the eca-let-7 family and eca-miR-221/222.\n\nDiscussion: Despite their obvious potential as disease biomarkers, there is still no common opinion regarding the biological function of circulating, extracellular miRNAs. Some studies suggest their ability to manipulate the tumor environment in order to make it more permissive to tumor growth and invasion. When the top 3 known differentially regulated miRNAs were analyzed with miRPath tool, the union of predicted or experimentally validated targets showed an enrichment for pathways involved in cancer and transcriptional misregulation in cancer.\n\nConclusion: Serum miRNA expression profiles differ between ES affected and control horses. The role of circulating miRNAs in the molecular pathways of equine sarcoid needs to be further investigated.\n\nSignificance: Non-invasive diagnosis of ES disease may be possible by the identification of miRNA fingerprints in serum.\n\nKey words: Biomarker; Equine oncology; Equine sarcoid; miRNA. Objectives: Inhalation of immunostimulatory bacterial DNA segments (cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-oligodeoxynucleotides, CpG-ODN) has been shown to normalize clinical and cytologic parameters in severe equine asthma (recurrent airway obstruction, RAO). We hypothesized that CpG-ODN inhalation reduces the misbalance of elastinolytic activity in horses affected by RAO.\n\nMethods: 20 horses diagnosed as RAO by clinical examinations using a scoring system were included. All horses were treated with inhalative CpG-ODN for 14 days in 2-day intervals. Matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP-2/-9) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2) concentrations were measured in tracheal aspirates using equine ELISA kits (USCN Life Science Inc.) before, immediately and 6 weeks after CpG-ODN inhalation.\n\nResults: MMP and TIMP concentrations correlated with the results of clinical scoring in all stages of equine asthma. Inhalation therapy led to significant reductions in clinical scores. MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 concentrations were reduced significantly immediately, and all MMP and TIMP concentrations 6 weeks after therapy.\n\nDiscussion: In equine asthma, overexpression of MMPs contributes to pathological tissue destruction, while TIMPs counteract MMPs with overexpression leading to fibrosis formation. The results of this study show that CpG-ODN inhalation is an effective therapy to address a misbalance in equine asthma.\n\nConclusions: Misbalance of elastinolytic activity was positively influenced by CpG-ODN inhalation for at least 6 post therapy, which may reduce the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Further studies should evaluate this effect in comparison to glucocorticoid inhalation therapy.\n\nSignificance: CpG-ODN inhalation may be an effective therapy in prevention of pulmonary fibrosis formation in equine asthma.\n\nKey words: CpG-ODN; Equine asthma; Horse; Inhalation; MMP; RAO; Respiratory; TIMP. Objectives: In this study, the effect of TTs was evaluated in 30 Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses in a prospective, cross-over blinded clinical study.\n\nMethods: 22 Thoroughbred and 8 Standardbred racehorses were examined using overground endoscopy under full-intensity exercise on their training race tracks with and without fixation of the tongue by use of TTs. Equivalent exercise intensity was ensured by measuring heart rate (bpm), speed (GPS) and venous lactate. Pharyngeal diameter was expressed as pharyngeal-epiglottis-ratios as described in former studies and laryngeal abduction accordingly as laryngeal-median-ratios.\n\nResults: The pharyngeal diameter increased significantly in all horses between rest and full-intensity exercise (P < 0.01). Multivariable-analysis revealed that this effect was significantly decreased by the application of tongue ties (P < 0.01). No significant effects of TTs on laryngeal parameters were found. DDSP was found in 4/30 examinations with TT (13.3%) and in 1/30 examinations without TT (3.3%).\n\nDiscussion: There is contradictory published evidence on the potential efficacy of 'tongue ties' (TTs) on upper airway function and for treatment of intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP) in racehorses. A positive effect on pharyngeal or laryngeal diameters was not found in this study. Further studies should focus on animal welfare.\n\nConclusions: The results of this study do not support the use of TTs to support upper airway function and to prevent the occurrence of DDSP.\n\nSignificance: The results of our study might provide objective evidence for future decisions of equine sports organizations concerning the regulations on TTs.\n\nKey words: DDSP; Overground endoscopy; Tongue tie. Objectives: Determining whether high quality 24 -hour continuous ambulatory telemetric EEG recordings can be made using a prefab horse-cap. Secondly, to determine whether such recordings are helpful in determining (sub) clinical epileptic pathology.\n\nMethods: 24-Hour ambulatory telemetric electroencephalograms were recorded from 7 adult control horses and 7 adult patients with abnormals behaviour of unknown origin or epileptic-like insults and with absence of extra cranial disease. An EEG-cap developed for horses, an amplifier and recording software (Lifelines) were used. A commercial video camera was connected to the recording laptop. For analysis the sensitivity was set at 70 microvolt/cm with a time-base of 10 s/page as starting point. The low-cut filter was set at 0.500 Hz and the high-cut at 35-70 Hz. The notch filter was 50 Hz. Abnormal activity was defined as a spike or sharp wave, a period of generalized slow wave rhythmical activity, or a generalized fast rhythmical discharge. The recording time ranged from 20.35 to 20.10 hours.\n\nResults: There were no clinical nor technical problems and the recordings were of good quality. One control horse (14%) showed abnormal brain activity. Six out of 7 patients (86%) showed abnormal brain activity. The simultaneous video surveillance proved essential in recognizing artefacts due to ear, lip or eye movements and shaking or headrubbing.\n\nConclusion and Clinical relevance: The use of the horse-cap is facilitating the application process and results in good quality recordings. The telemetric ambulatory EEG using simultaneous video recordings is a helpful asset in the neurological diagnostic workup. Objectives: To determine whether horses treated with corticosteroids are at an increased risk of laminitis and whether there an association with corticosteroid type.\n\nMethods: A retrospective case-control study was undertaken in which all horses treated with corticosteroids by the Royal Veterinary College equine first opinion practice and referral hospital in 2014 were included. For each case, one time-matched control that was seen by the same veterinarian but not treated with corticosteroids was identified. The prevalence of laminitis was compared between groups and association with corticosteroid type assessed.\n\nResults: Of the 205 cases, 2 (1%) developed laminitis within 14 days of corticosteroid therapy and 2/205 controls developed laminitis within the same time period. Neither of the two cases that developed laminitis had any relevant laminitis risk factors, however both controls had a history of previous laminitis and one had an underlying endocrinopathy. There was no association between laminitis occurrence and the type of corticosteroid prescribed.\n\nDiscussion: The perceived risk of laminitis associated with medium and long-term corticosteroid preparations is greater than that associated with short-term preparations, but reports of laminitis following use of corticosteroids other than oral prednisolone are limited to case reports. This is the first case-control study evaluating the risk.\n\nConclusions: Use of various corticosteroid preparations including oral perdnisolone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, intravenous and oral dexamethasone and inhaled corticosteroids was not associated with an increased prevalence of laminitis.\n\nSignificance: Administration of corticosteroids did not increase the prevalence of laminitis. Objectives: This study aimed to validate a clinical score system that could be used by practitioners to improve the detection of acute/subacute EGS cases in the field based on simple epidemiological and clinical variables.\n\nMethods: Two studies, were performed to create and validate a scoring system for suspected EGS cases. For each group, a ROC curve was created and area under the ROC curve was calculated, and a cut-off score with the highest sensitivity for each group was selected. Using the cut-off scores calculated for the 3 groups, a range of scores was determined to try discriminate between probable, suspect and negative cases.\n\nResults: A clinical score greater than 26 would make the animal highly probable to be a positive EGS case, while a score between 19 and 26 would make the animal a suspected case, a score less than 19 would be unlikely to have EGS. With this range, the scoring system has sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 67-73%, and 80% of animals would be correctly classified.\n\nDiscussion: Pre-mortem diagnosis of EGS is a challenge as definitive diagnosis requires a laparotomy/laparoscopy-assisted ileal/myenteric lymph nodes biopsies. There is a need to improve the detection of the disease in countries (like France) where the incidence is unknown, but presumed low.\n\nConclusion: The score developed represents an inexpensive and useful tool for the identification of suspected EGS cases in the field situation.\n\nSignificance: The score is easy to calculate, and could help field veterinarians to more easily identify potential cases of EGS.\n\nKey words: Dysautonomia; Equine grass sickness. ANALYSIS  OUTCOME  AND  COMPLICATIONS  AFTER  LARGE  INTESTINAL  TRANSABDOMINAL AND TRANSRECTAL TROCHARISATION  IN HORSES (2004 HORSES ( -2015 . Angelika Schoster 1 , Nicole Altermatt 2 , Andrea Bischofberger 1 . 1 Equine Department, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 2 Swiss Institute of Equine Medicine, University of Bern and Agroscope, Bern, Switzerland\n\nObjective: To describe the outcome of trocharisation and to identify factors associated with occurrence of peritonitis Methods: 228 horses with colic that underwent percutaneous or trans rectal trocharisation were included. Odds ratios and chi square tests were used to identify factors associated with outcome and occurrence of peritonitis (>5,000 3 10 9 cells/L). Factors evaluated were site and number of trocharisations, presence of a ping on auscultation, gas distension on rectal examination, complications during the procedure and rolling under general anesthesia. Clinical signs of peritonitis were defined as 2 of: anorexia, lethargy, fever, abnormal mucus membranes hyperfibrinogenemia and leukocytosis.\n\nResults: Between one and four trocharisations were performed per horse, 190/228 (83%) were transabdominal, 17/228 (8%) transrectal and 21/228 (9%) both. Of the 173 medically treated horses 127 (73%) survived, none were euthanized related to trocharisation. Horses with three procedures were more likely euthanized compared to one (OR 5.1, CI 1.68-15.69, P 5 0.004). Horses undergoing both procedures were more likely euthanized compared to solely transabdominal trocharisation (P 5 0.0007). Peritonitis was present in 52/55 (95%), none of the factors tested were associated with occurrence of peritonitis. Clinical signs and peritonitis were present in 7/55 (13%) of horses, 3/7 (42%) were rolled under general anesthesia following trocharisation.\n\nDiscussion: Peritonitis was common, but clinical signs associated with it were uncommon. Rolling after trocharisation resulted in clinically relevant peritonitis in 40%\n\nSignificance: Trocharisation is a safe procedure in horses. Clinical signs of peritonitis are rare, however a higher complication rates should be anticipated when rolling horses after trocharisation. While Coastal Bermuda hay is strongly associated with ileal impaction in the southeastern United States, stabling on flax bedding has anecdotally been associated with this condition in Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ileal impactions and the use of flax shives opposed to straw as bedding. Medical records of 2,337 referral cases evaluated for abdominal pain between January 2008 and May 2017 were reviewed. Diagnosis, date of admission, age, breed, gender, weight, stall bedding and outcome were recorded. The association between bedding and ileal impaction was evaluated by a Chi square test; the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The proportion of cases stabled on flax bedding was 11.4%. The overall prevalence of ileal impactions was 4.2%. In the flax group, the prevalence of ileal impaction was 9.4% as opposed to 3.6% in the straw group. The OR (2.83; 95% CI, 1.83-4.40; P < 0.001) indicated that horses stabled on flax bedding were approximately 3 times more likely to have ileal impaction compared to horses stabled on straw. No significant association for date of admission, age, breed, gender and weight was found in a multivariate model. Survival to discharge was 72.5% in the medically treated group compared to 76.7% in the surgically treated group. No significant association was found between survival to discharge and type of bedding. These results suggest that horses housed on flax bedding were more likely to develop ileal impaction compared to horses on straw. Objectives: We recently showed that moderate/severe Equine Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD) is associated with an exaggerated cortisol release following ACTH stimulation. The aim of the present study was to determine the best time point for salivary cortisol measurement after stimulation.\n\nMethods: Twenty-six endurance and eventing horses (Sport Horses (S)) without clinical complaints and an independent population of 62 patients (Patients (P)) were grouped by gastroscopic findings (no/mild vs. moderate/severe EGGD, grade 0/1 vs. 2-4 Equine Squamous Gastric Disease (ESGD), respectively) and underwent an ACTH stimulation test. Salivary cortisol was analyzed before and 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 minutes after intravenous injection of 1 ug/kg synthetic ACTH1-24 (Synacthen, Novartis). Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analyses of all time points and of the AUC (corrected for the baseline) were performed.\n\nResults: Salivary cortisol values 60 minutes after ACTH injection showed best agreement with moderate/severe EGGD, based on sensitivity (S: 100%/P: 75%), specificity (S: 75%/P: 52%) and 1-sided P-value (S: P 0.001/P: P 5 0.0064). In comparison, AUC showed inferior sensitivity (S: 100%/P: 56%; specificity: S: 70%/P: 76%; 1-sided P-value: S: P 0.001, P: P 5 0.0231). There were no significant associations with ESGD.\n\nDiscussion: The initial release of cortisol rather than its peak or total increase (AUC) appears to be relevant regarding EGGD.\n\nConclusion: Salivary cortisol measurement 60 minutes after ACTH administration shows best performance, but diagnostic accuracy does not presently support clinical use.\n\nSignificance: Characterization of the adrenal response to an ACTH stimulus may improve the understanding of EGGD pathophysiology and its relation to stress.\n\nKey words: ACTH challenge; Gastric ulcers; Stress. Aortic regurgitation (AR) and mitral regurgitation (MR) are common in horses. The purpose of this study was to investigate non-invasively measured pulse pressure (PP) in horses with AR and MR and to propose PP cutoff values to identify AR and to assess severity of AR.\n\nMedical records of horses presented between April 2013 and June 2017 for cardiac examination were retrospectively analyzed. Horses with arrhythmias, chronic heart failure, unclear primary diagnosis, <1 y of age or <300 kg bodyweight were excluded. All horses had noninvasive blood pressures recorded (average of 5 measurements; Medtronic Lifepak 15) and diagnoses and disease severity had been confirmed by echocardiography.\n\nCases were categorized based on primary diagnosis (AR, n 5 43; MR, n 5 39; healthy controls, n 5 13) and regurgitation severity (mild, moderate, severe) by color-flow mapping. PP was compared between groups using one-way ANOVA and cutoff values were determined with ROC analysis.\n\nPP was significantly increased with AR compared to MR (mean difference [95% CI]: 119 [11-26] mmHg) and controls (118 [7-28] mmHg). Sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and likelihood ratio (LR) of PP to distinguish AR from MR and controls were 82%, 73% and 3.1 at cutoff 48 mmHg and 49%, 98% and 25.4 at cutoff 58 mmHg. Sn, Sp and LR to differentiate severe from mild-moderate AR were 70%, 83% and 4.0 at cutoff 62 mmHg and 55%, 96% and 12.7 at cutoff 67 mmHg, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, PP is increased in horses with AR and non-invasive PP measurements can aid clinicians in staging severity of AR in horses.\n\nKey words: Aortic regurgitation; Non-invasive blood pressure; Pulse pressure.
