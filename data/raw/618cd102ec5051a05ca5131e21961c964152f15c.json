Specific bat characteristics like their ability to fly, unique among mammals, or their 60 migratory capacity [7] , increase their potential role as vectors of diseases. Bats are natural 61 reservoirs for many viruses, such as Coronavirus, Nipah virus and Ebola related to new emerging 62 diseases that have received attention in the last years due to the potential risk they pose for 63 human pandemic events [8] [9] [10] or with important health and economic consequences world-64 wide, such as rabies outbreaks [11, 12] . The capacity to coexist with viruses (in the absence of 65 disease) is probably linked to the bats' immune-system which seems be different to that of other focusing not only on the analysis of fecal samples and internal tissues -as in previous studies-89 but also on the analysis of the oropharyngeal swabs. AdVs are detected in almost half of the 90 Iberian bat species studied, in both feces and in the upper respiratory tract (for the first time in 91 bats), establishing a possible fecal-oral transmission route in two Pipistrellus pygmaeus. 92 Moreover, they found a surprisingly high prevalence in this species together with the co-generic 93 P. kuhlii and the closely related giant noctule, Nyctalus lasiopterus, which accounted for the vast 94 majority of viruses detected in the study. These results have presented us with the opportunity to 95 analyze the abiotic factors or biotic traits determining prevalence of AdVs in European bats at 96 two levels: across-species and among individuals within a species.\n\nThe analysis of morphological and behavioral traits and presence of AdVs in bats is also 98 useful for the understanding of viral transmission dynamics. In fact, little is known about the 99 transmission mechanisms of AdVs and no study has focused on transmission in bats. A handful 100 of studies in humans suggest that transmission may need direct contact or at least a droplet 101 spraying (such as those produced by coughing or sneezing) or aerosol [27] [28] [29] . The strong host 102 specificity and the parallelism between host and AdVs phylogenies found for bats [16, 30] No study has focused so far on the analyses of the determinant factors influencing 106 prevalence of viruses on bats at both species and individual levels. Across species, Webber et al. 107 [32] found that viral richness was positively correlated with group size as predicted by the 108 contact-rate hypothesis. In turn, at the intra-specific level Dietrich et al. presented in S1 Table) . Moreover, the same result was recovered when using AdVs presence as a 166 binomial dependent variable (S2 Table) , indicating a significantly higher AdVs presence in bat 167 species not engaging in swarming for mating.\n\nAt individual level and for the three species considered, the complete models were used 169 since no model was selected by AIC (\u2206AIC < 3). The GLMM analysis revealed a significantly 170 higher AdVs presence for males (z= 2.067, p=0.039) in N. lasiopterus (Fig 3A) , and a trend 171 towards higher AdVs prevalence for individuals with smaller forearm (Fig 3B) When analyzing the effect on the AdVs presence of within-species variance in traits, we 229 found that the site of capture explains an important part of the variance of all models suggesting 230 an underlying general pattern across species and supporting the contact-rate hypothesis. This 231 trend is particularly clear for Pipistrellus pygmaeus, whose sampling localities are more 232 widespread along the Iberian Peninsula than those for Nyctalus lasiopterus and P. kuhlii (Fig 4) . Species with fewer than 10 samples were eliminated from the matrix and from the phylogeny.\n\nThe analyses were also run considering presence/absence of AdVs as a dependent variable and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/626309 doi: bioRxiv preprint The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/626309 doi: bioRxiv preprint"}
