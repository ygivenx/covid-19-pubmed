{"title": "Chitosan Nanoparticle Encapsulated Hemagglutinin-Split Influenza Virus Mucosal Vaccine", "body": "Influenza is a highly contagious devastating respiratory disease which causes public health and socio-economic problems worldwide (1) . Currently available influenza vaccines are made of either inactivated whole viruses or the virus subunit/ split products (2) . The former vaccine is highly immunogenic but often causes adverse reactions particularly in infants and children (3, 4) . Therefore many countries prefer the subunit/ split vaccines for their people (5, 6) . However, the less reactogenic vaccines confer limited immunogenicity and require either high antigenic dose or, in the case of naive subjects, a booster dose (7, 8) . Co-administration of an immunological adjuvant with the vaccine components improved immunogenicity leading to antigen sparing and adequate protective immune response after a single dose (9, 10) . Immunogenicity of the vaccine was enhanced better by emulsion adjuvants, i.e., AS03 (oil-in-water preparation) or MF59 (a squalene-based oil-in-water preparation), than alum due probably to recruitment of more inflammatory cells, lymphocytes, and antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) (11) . Nevertheless, the emulsion adjuvants also increase adverse reactions, both local and systemic (12, 13) .\n\nInfluenza vaccines are administered mostly by intramuscular route which has some limitations. Systemic immune response is induced but low, if there would be any, the respiratory mucosal response. Usually muscles have little antigenpresenting cells including dendritic cells and macrophages. The skeletal muscles do not express MHC molecules under normal conditions. Besides, human muscle cells express B7-H3, a B7 homolog, which functions as a co-inhibitory molecule of T cells for local immune regulatory processes (14) . Intranasal route for influenza vaccine administration, on the contrary, offers several advantages. Besides this route that is needleand painless, evidences have indicated also that the antigen activated immune cells at the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue commonly home at the respiratory immune effector sites including larynx-and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (15) and exert their defensive activities at the prime sites of influenza virus infection. Moreover, the vaccine components applied intranasally may reach the macrophages which roam about in the trachea and lungs. These cells may engulf the vaccine, become mature during their drainage to local lymph nodes (acquire ability to express co-signaling and MHC molecules and secrete cytokines), and present antigen to the T cells for induction of local immune response (16) . The vaccine antigen applied intranasally may also reach the blood circulation and the systemic immune response is stimulated in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes (17) . Thus, both mucosal and systemic immune responses can be expected after the intranasal immunization of appropriate vaccine formulation that could overcome the normal mucosal tolerance and breach the nasal epithelium tight junction (18) .\n\nIn recent decades, chitosan (CS), which is a nontoxic, bioadhesive, -degradable, and -compatible material, has been used widely as a carrier for peptide, protein, and DNA-based vaccines (19) (20) (21) . CS is an attractive intranasal vaccine delivery vehicle. Its mucoadhesive property could overcome the mucociliary clearance, thus increasing the resident time of the vaccine component in the nasal passage. CS promotes paracellular transportation of the cargo antigen through the nasal mucosa (22) . It served as an immunopotentiating agent to augment vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness (23) . Besides, annotated data have demonstrated that the CS nanoparticles induced both mucosal and systemic immune responses to the entrapped antigen after intranasal administration (24, 25) . In this study, a split influenza vaccine containing hemagglutinin of H1N1 virus formulated with CS nanoparticles was administered intranasally. The vaccine innocuousness, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in a mouse model of influenza are reported herein.\n\nLow viscous CS and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) were from Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA. Sodium acetate trihydrate and acetic acid were from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Purified rat monoclonal anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3, rat anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3-biotin conjugate, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate, and BD OptEIA TM assay diluent were from Becton-Dickinson (BD) Biosciences, CA, USA. HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and IgA were from Southern Biotech, AL, USA. TMB-E and TMB-H substrates were from Moss, MD, USA.\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (NIBIO), Osaka, Japan. Animal manipulation was performed according to the NIBIO Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female BALB/c mice, 5-7 weeks old, were from Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan. They were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in an animal room at the NIBIO. (26) was used for animal challenge when testing the vaccine protective efficacy. The virus was propagated in Mardin-Darby canine kidney cells grown in complete Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, and 2 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin. The viruses harvested from the culture supernatant were inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility at the NIBIO.\n\nThe CS/TPP nanoparticles were prepared as described previously (27) with modifications. A 0.5% (w/v) CS stock solution was prepared by dissolving the CS powder in 1%v/v aqueous acetic acid under magnetic stirring with gentle heating until a transparent solution was obtained. The preparation was adjusted to pH 5.4 and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm membrane. Working CS solutions of different concentrations, i.e., 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3%, were prepared by diluting the stock solution with 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4. TPP working solutions (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%) were prepared in ultrapure distilled water. Plain CS/TPP nanoparticles were obtained by ionic cross-linking of positively charged nitrogen groups in CS and negatively charged phosphate groups in TPP. Preliminary screenings for the optimal concentrations of CS and TPP in forming colloidal solution(s) were done by mixing various working concentrations of CS (5 ml) and solutions of TPP (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 ml). Thereafter, a selected CS concentration was mixed with varying amounts of TPP to yield different CS/TPP mass ratios, i.e., 1:0.2 to 1:5.0 (w/w), for selection of the CS/TPP ratio that formed the desired CS/TPP nanoparticles. The mixing time was varied from 1 to 5 h to investigate the effect on the nanoparticle sizes.\n\nEncapsulation of the HA-split influenza product into CS/ TPP nanoparticles was performed by mixing 0.7 ml containing 1 \u03bcg of HA-split virus component in acetate buffer, pH 5.4, with 3.3 ml of 0.05%w/v CS solution; then 1 ml of 0.1% TPP solution was admixed. The preparation was kept stirring at 25\u00b0C for 2 h. The CS/TPP-HA nanoparticles were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000\u00d7g for 20 min; the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml sterile PBS.\n\nMorphology of CS-encapsulated HA-split virus nanoparticles (CS/TPP-HA) was examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (HT7700; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The sizes and surface charges were determined by using the automated measurement program of Zetasizer-nano series instrument (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). In order to estimate percent antigen encapsulation efficiency (% EE), the CS/TPP-HA preparation was centrifuged at 14,000\u00d7g for 20 min. The % EE was calculated: [(total amount of HA-split virus added \u2212 amount of HA-split virus in the supernatant)/ amount of HA-split virus in supernatant]\u00d7100. Measurement was performed in triplicate.\n\nThe CS/TPP-HA were centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of PBS (1 \u03bcl contained 0.05 \u03bcg of HAsplit virus product). Mice were divided into four groups of five mice each. Group 1 mice were immunized intranasally (i.n.) twice at a 3-week interval with 20 \u03bcl of CS/TPP-HA (contained 1 \u03bcg of the antigen). Mice of groups 2-4 (controls) received individually two doses at a 3-week interval of 20 \u03bcl of HA-split virus alone (1 \u03bcg), plain CS/TPP nanoparticles, and PBS, respectively. Two weeks after the booster, all mice were bled and antigen-specific IgG antibodies in their sera were determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After bleeding, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was harvested from each mouse by flushing 1 ml of PBS containing gentamycin via a Surflo \u00ae Teflon I.V. catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) inserted through a hole made in proximal trachea into the lower respiratory tract; then the fluid was drawn back through the catheter. Another catheter was used to flush 1 ml of PBS upward from the tracheal hole through nasal passage in order to collect the nasal wash fluid (NW). The BALF and NW were centrifuged to remove tissue or cell debris. The supernatants were collected separately and concentrated 4\u00d7 by using 30K membrane Amicon \u00ae Ultrafiltration before use in antigen-specific IgA antibody determination by indirect ELISA. Spleen was aseptically excised from the mouse and single cells were prepared in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS for enumeration of the antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells by ELISPOT assay.\n\nIndirect ELISA (28) was used for determining antigenspecific serum IgG and IgA in mouse sera and BALF and NW, respectively. Briefly, Microtest TM 96-well ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with 50 \u03bcl of 1 \u03bcg/ml HA-split vaccine and kept overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with 0.1% PBS-T, all wells were blocked with BD OptEIA TM assay diluent. Serial twofold dilutions of sera (started from 1:128), BALF, and NW (started from 1:2) from all mouse groups were added appropriately to the antigen-coated wells, and the plates were kept at 25\u00b0C for 2 h. For serum IgG detection, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (diluted 1:4,000) were added to the wells. Goat anti-mouse IgA-HRP conjugate (diluted 1:8,000) was used for specific IgA detection in BALF and NW. The plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h, washed, and TMB-E substrate was used for color development. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 25 \u03bcl of 1 N HCl. OD 450nm of the content in each well was determined against blank (wells to which PBS was added instead of the mouse sample). The specific antibody titer was the highest dilution of the sample that the OD 450nm was \u22650.05.\n\nThe number of IFN-\u03b3-secreting splenocytes was determined by using IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT procedure (29) . Briefly, Multiscreen \u00ae HTS HA 96-well filtration plates (Millipore, Ireland) were coated with 100 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcg/ml purified rat monoclonal anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 antibody and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The plates were washed and each well was blocked with 300 \u03bcl of 5% FBS in RPMI-1640 medium at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. Single spleen cells of the vaccinated/control mice were added to appropriate wells (10 6 cells/well) followed by UV-inactivated A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) (10 6 pfu/well; optimal amount from titration) in 5% complete RPMI-1640 medium, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 incubator for 48 h. The content in each well was discarded and the wells were washed before adding 1 \u03bcg/ml of rat anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3-biotin conjugate (100 \u03bcl/well) and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h. Streptavidin-HRP conjugate (100 \u03bcl of 1:800 dilution) and TMB-H substrate were used for spot revelation. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by rinsing the wells with distilled water. Automatic KS-ELISPOT reader (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used for spot enumeration. Data were expressed as the number of spots per 10 6 splenocytes. Three independent experiments were performed.\n\nTwo sets of four mouse groups (five mice per group) were prepared. Groups 1 of both sets were immunized intranasally with the CS/TPP-HA for the vaccine immunogenicity study while groups 2-4 of each set served as respective controls. Two weeks after the booster dose, mice of set 1 were challenged intranasally with 5 LD 50 of the mouse-adapted A/Brisbane/59/ 2007(H1N1) and set 2 animals received individually 20 LD 50 of the virus intranasally. The animals were observed daily for morbidity (body weight loss) and mortality. Experiments were terminated at day 14 post-challenge.\n\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, CA, USA). Differences among mouse groups were compared by unpaired t test. A Mann-Whitney t test was used when the normality was not obtained. The p value of <0.05 was statistically different.\n\nOptimum proportion of CS and TPP in forming ionic cross-linked nanoparticles was screened randomly from a total of 144 CS/TPP formulations including six CS working solutions (0.05-0.3%) and 6 vol (0.5-3 ml) of four concentrations of TPP working solutions (0.05-0.3%). The CS/TPP colloidal solutions (with turbidity) were obtained when 0.05%w/v CS was used (final concentration 0.333 mg/ml) to mix with variable volumes of various TPP solutions (data not shown). When the CS final concentration was deviated from 0.333 mg/ ml, either a clear solution, suspension, or precipitation was obtained.\n\nThe formulations containing CS at 0.333 mg/ml that yielded colloidal solutions were investigated further to find out the optimal TPP concentration for CS/TPP nanoparticle formation which was performed by setting up CS/TPP ratios (w/w) from 1:0.2 to 1:5.0. For this experiment, 3.3 ml of 0.05% w/v CS (final concentration at 0.333 mg/ml) were mixed with 1 ml of various TPP concentrations (0.007-0.167%w/v equivalent to final concentrations at 0.067-1.665 mg/ml, respectively). The final volume of the preparations was adjusted with acetate buffer, pH 5.4, to 5 ml. It was found that only CS/TPP ratio of 1:0.6 ( Table I, Table I) . The CS/TPP ratio 1:0.6 colloid was then prepared by varying the CS/TPP mixing times for 2, 3, 4, and 5 h. The results indicated that the particle sizes increased in a time-dependent manner, i.e., the longer the mixing period, the larger the particle sizes (Table II) . Taken together, the optimal condition for producing the CS/TPP nanoparticles was 0.333 mg/ml CS solution, 0.200 mg/ml TPP solution (CS/TPP mass ratio was 1:0.6), and 2 h mixing time. The C1 formulation (Table II) which produced the nanoparticles of 302.88\u00b16.20 nm was used as the HA-split influenza vaccine delivery vehicle.\n\nThe CS/TPP-HA nanoparticles revealed a spherical shape by TEM (Fig. 1) . The physicochemical characteristics of the CS/TPP-HA vaccine are shown in Table III . The zeta potential of the CS-formulated HA-split vaccine nanoparticles was cathodic (ranged from 21.93 to 21.97 mV). The sizes of the vaccine particles (351.00\u00b12.00 nm in the prime preparation and 358.67\u00b15.13 nm in the booster preparation) were larger than those of the respective plain CS/TPP preparations (315.67\u00b15.13 and 300.50\u00b18.50 nm, respectively) (p<0.05). Both CS/TPP-HA and plain CS/TPP revealed rather uniformed nano-sizes. The CS/TPP-HA had 78.13-78.54% encapsulation efficiencies (% EE).\n\nMice immunized intranasally with two doses of the CSencapsulated HA-split virus vaccine and vaccine controls did not show any sign and symptoms of adverse effects. The CSencapsulated HA-split virus vaccinated mice had both systemic and mucosal immune responses. The levels of HA-specific serum IgG and secretory IgA in BALF and NW of mice vaccinated with CS/TPP-HA vaccine, HA alone, plain CS/ TPP, and PBS are shown in Fig 2. The HA-specific IgG antibody titers in sera of mice immunized with CS/TPP-HA vaccine were significantly higher than those stimulated with HA-split vaccine alone, plain CS/TPP, and PBS (Fig. 2a) (p< 0.05). The HA-specific IgA levels in BALF (Fig. 2b ) as well as NW (Fig. 2c ) of mice vaccinated with CS/TPP-HA were also higher than the control groups.\n\nThe intranasally administered CS/TPP-HA-split influenza vaccine could induce also specific cell-mediated immune response. Significant numbers of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells were found in spleens of CS/TPP-HA vaccinated mice and were Nanoparticles were prepared using formulation C (ratio of CS/TPP was 1:0.6) absent in the control mice including HA-split virus alone, CS/ TPP, and PBS stimulated groups (Fig. 3) .\n\nAfter being challenged intranasally with 5 LD 50 of the mouse adapted A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) virus, mice that received CS/TPP-HA, HA-split vaccine alone, CS/TPP, and PBS had 100, 60, 0, and 0% survival, respectively (Fig. 4a) . When the challenge dose was increased to 20 LD 50 , all mice vaccinated with the CS/TPP-HA survived until the end of the experiments (day 14) while mice of the other groups died within day 9 post-infection (Fig. 4c) . Figure 4b shows body weights of all mouse groups after receiving the 5 LD 50 virus challenge. All mice of the group that received CS/TPP-HA-split vaccine and 60% of the HA-split vaccine group lose their body weights during the first 4 and 7 days after challenge, respectively; their body weights were regained thereafter. Mice of the CS/TPP and PBS groups had steady body weight loss until death within day 6 post-infection. Morbidity of the mice that received the 20 LD 50 challenge is shown in Fig. 4d . CS/TPP-HA vaccinated mice had their weight loss during the first 4 days and then regained while all mice of the other groups continued to loss their weights, became moribund, and died.\n\nVaccination is an effective measure for prevention of influenza (30) . The first prerequisite step of the influenza virus infection occurs at the respiratory epithelium. Thus, immunological factor that operates at the infection prime site is highly important for prevention of the virus replication in the epithelial cells and further systemic spread. Intramuscular vaccines rarely induce the local immune response. Also, the antibody induced systemically by the parenteral vaccine usually do not reach the mucosal surface except by passive transudation which would occur only when the circulating IgG level is high and sustained or in the situation of pathotopic potentiation. Vaccine administration by intranasal route, on the other hand, stimulates both systemic and mucosal immune responses, particularly specific secretory IgA which are mucophilic and protease resistant, and therefore functions well as the first-line defense at the mucosa (31, 32) . However, immunogenicity acquired from the mucosal vaccine per se may be inadequate and thus effective adjuvant and/or vaccine delivery vehicle is required to improve the magnitude of the immune response (28, 33, 34) . Among various developing adjuvant/delivery systems, CS is favorable for intranasal vaccine due to its mucoadhesive property and ability to overcome the formidable nasal epithelial barrier (23, 35) . Several studies have demonstrated success in using CS nanoparticles as delivery systems for intranasal protein and DNA vaccines (36) (37) (38) .\n\nIn this study, CS nanoparticles were used to encapsulate HA-split influenza virus vaccine. The ionic cross-linking technique is a shear force-, organic solvent-, and heat-free procedure; thus, it is suitable for vulnerable molecules such as the vaccine antigen of this study (39) . There are many factors to be considered in formulating suitable CS nanoparticles for the vaccine. These include concentrations of the CS and the TPP, the CS/TPP mass ratio, and the reagent mixing time. Therefore, the preliminary experiments were performed to screen and select the best CS and TPP combination in formation of the CS/TPP colloid. The ionic cross-linking between the CS cationic amine groups and the polyanion of TPP phosphate groups was used for preparing the CS/TPP nanoparticles. Data in the literature have demonstrated that spontaneous particle formation in the ionic cross-linkage occurred only at suitable concentrations of CS and TPP (40) . In this study, the nanoparticulate system of CS/TPP with good physicochemical properties, i.e., nanometer range in size, positive charge, and relatively high encapsulation efficiency, was achieved at CS/ TPP ratio of 1:0.6 by using 2 h mixing time However, physicochemical properties of CS nanoparticles product formed by ionic-cross-linking are affected by chemical properties of CS (molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, and chemical modification) and condition of preparation (pH, volume, and mixing time) (41) (42) (43) . Therefore, the characteristic of the CS/ TPP nanoparticles produced in one study may not be similar to that of another (38, 44) .\n\nIncorporation of the HA-split influenza virus into CS/ TPP nanoparticles was done at pH 5.4. At this acidic pH, the amine groups of CS were positively charged because each (45) . In addition, HA-split virus product had pI 4.8; thus, at pH 5.4 it was negatively charged. Therefore, the antigen could be entrapped into the CS/TPP nanoparticles with relatively high percentage of encapsulation efficiency. According to the TEM image, the HA-split virus component might be condensed by the CS polymer chains along with the TPP to form the encapsulated nanoparticles. The CS/TPP-HA might be linked together through two different bonds. One possible association mechanism of the vaccine component with the nanoparticles besides the entrapment of the HA-split influenza virus product in the CS/TPP nanoparticles was the electrostatic interaction between the cathodic CS and the anodic vaccine component (46) .\n\nThe bioadhesive cationic polymeric CS was used to prolong residence time in the nasal passage and promote absorption of CS vaccine via nasal mucosa (47, 48) . The established CS/TPP-HA nanoparticles in this study possessed positive surface charge (21.93-21.97 mV) indicating a suitable property for intranasal vaccine delivery (49) . The positively charged CS/TPP-HA should bind with the negatively charged mucus glycoproteins (50) and also dendrites of some dendritic cells (DCs) that protruded through the paracellular junction of the epithelial cells (51) . The intimate contact between the vaccine formulation and the mucus/mucosa should increase retention time of CS/TPP-HA vaccine and increased absorption opportunity through the nasal mucosa (35) . The binding of the nanoparticles to dendritic cells should allow antigen delivery into the cytoplasm for antigen processing via the cytosolic pathway (MHC class I) and followed by Th1/cell-mediated immune response stimulation. The phagocytosed component can be processed and the peptides are presented via the MHC class II pathways which the humoral immune response should be induced (52) . Moreover, cross-antigen presentation could be expected also (53) .\n\nSizes are known to influence the mucosal uptake of the particulate delivery system (54) . However, the optimal size for nasal vaccine delivery vehicles is still controversial. Many studies revealed that stronger and more robust immune responses were induced by submicron sizes of CS nanoparticles because the particles of this size range are readily phagocytosed by the antigen-presenting cells (55) (56) (57) . Data from mucus adsorption studies revealed that mucoadhesive particles, which are fine nanoparticles (230-320 nm), increased in penetration through the mucus layer. On the other hand, larger particles (2 \u03bcm) were adsorbed on the surface of mucosa (Langmuir-type adsorption) (58). CS ionic cross-linking-HA nanoparticles of this study had appropriate sizes of 351.00-358.67 nm as measured by using the Zetasizer. The particles when applied intranasally should be engulfed by the microfold (M) cell overlying the nasal associated lymphoid tissue and the intact antigen should be delivered appropriately to the follicular dendritic cells for local immune response stimulation. The antigen may be carried by the DCs to the local draining lymph nodes or distant lymphoid tissues where immune responses can be incited therein (59, 60) . The ability of the CS/TPP-HA in inducing systemic and mucosal immune responses has been demonstrated in this study by the high levels of HA-specific serum IgG antibodies and IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in spleen and specific IgA antibodies in BALF and NW, respectively.\n\nNot only the immunogenicity of the CS/TPP-HA split vaccine over the HA-split vaccine alone was demonstrated but also the former vaccine formulation could provide higher protective efficacies than the latter against both low and high lethal challenges (5 and 20 LD 50 , respectively) with highly virulent influenza virus. All mice vaccinated intranasally with the CS nanoparticleentrapped HA-split vaccine survived the lethal infections while only partial (60%) and no protection (0%) were observed for mice that received HA-split vaccine alone against the low and the high doses, respectively. Overall results indicated that CS nanoparticle preparation produced in this study is a suitable delivery vehicle/adjuvant that not only enhanced the influenza vaccine immunogenicity but also increased the encapsulated vaccine protective efficacy. Unfortunately, experiments comparing the adjuvanticity of the CS nanoparticles and other approved human vaccine adjuvants such as alum and water-in-oil/oil-in-water/water-in-oil-in water emulsions have not been done for this HA-split influenza vaccine.\n\nA suitable condition for production of CS/TPP nanoparticles by means of ionic cross-linking was studied. The nanoparticles were used as a successful delivery vehicle of HA-split influenza virus vaccine for intranasal immunization. Mice that received the CS/TPP nanoparticle-encapsulated HA-split influenza vaccine intranasally developed higher systemic and mucosal antibody responses than the vaccine made of the HA-split influenza virus alone. The nanoparticle-encapsulated vaccine could induce also a cell-mediated immune response shown as high numbers of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in spleens while the HA vaccine alone could not do so. Besides, the CS nanoparticle-encapsulated HA-split vaccine reduced markedly the influenza morbidity and conferred 100% protective rate to the vaccinated mice against lethal influenza virus challenges. Taken together, CS nanoparticles invented in this study is an effective and safe delivery vehicle/adjuvant for the monovalent HA-split influenza vaccine tested. They should be investigated further for multivalent HA-split vaccine or universal influenza vaccine made of other influenza virus conserved proteins such as matrix protein-1 (M1), ion channel protein (M2), nucleoprotein (NP), and multifunctional non-structural protein-1 (NS1)."}
