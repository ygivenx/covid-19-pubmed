{"title": "A Case-Control Study Assessing the Impact of Nonventilated Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia on Patient Outcomes", "body": "Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a frequent and severe infection in hospitalized patients, with most reports focusing on HAP acquired in ICUs in the form of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). [1] [2] [3] Increasingly, antibiotic-resistant pathogens including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) are associated with HAP. 4 Respiratory viruses have also recently been identified as potentially important causative pathogens for HAP. 5 Antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as respiratory viruses pose an ongoing challenge to hospitals, both in patient treatment and in the prevention of transmission of these pathogens from patient to patient. Unfortunately, most clinical studies assessing the impact of HAP on patient outcomes [6] [7] [8] and guidelines for the prevention of HAP 1, [9] [10] [11] are directed at VAP, with little attention focused on nonventilated HAP (NVHAP). This is likely the result of the greater severity of illness in patients in the ICU setting, as well as the ability to more precisely define the presence of true infection in ventilated patients with pneumonia using diagnostic techniques such as BAL with quantitative cultures.\n\nAvailable studies suggest that NVHAP appears to have causative microorganisms and outcomes that are similar to those in VAP. [12] [13] [14] [15] However, there is a lack of controlled studies focusing on NVHAP to quantitatively determine the impact of this nosocomial infection on patient outcomes. The availability of such data could influence hospitals and physicians to increase the efforts aimed at preventing NVHAP, as well as improve the treatment of this nosocomial infection. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to describe the causative pathogens associated with NVHAP and to determine the influence of NVHAP on patient outcomes.\n\nThis was a single-center retrospective case-control study of patients with NVHAP performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (a 1,300-bed urban academic medical center in St. Louis, Missouri) between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014. The study protocol was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 201409001), and informed consent was waived. Adult patients ($ 19 years of age) admitted to the hospital for more than 48 h were eligible for participation. Patients were excluded if they were transferred from an outside hospital.\n\nWe defined NVHAP cases in accordance with the American Thoracic Society's position statement on nosocomial pneumonia. 1 All patients with a respiratory culture specimen obtained during the study period were screened for study entry. NVHAP was defined as a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate developing more than 48 h after hospital admission plus at least two of the following clinical features: fever > 38 C, leukocytosis (> 10 \u00c2 10 9 cells/L), leukopenia (# 4 \u00c2 10 9 cells/L), or purulent secretions. The Charlson comorbidity index was used as a summative score of underlying disease states. 16 The presence of a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate was based on the interpretation of the chest radiograph by board-certified radiologists blinded to the study. All patient charts identified as having new or progressive infiltrates were reviewed by one of the investigators (M. H. K.) to confirm the radiographic findings and by two other investigators (S. T. M., B. C.) to identify patients meeting the case definition for NVHAP. Pneumonia was classified as pathogen-negative if all respiratory culture results and applied molecular techniques failed to identify a pathogen. Pathogenpositive pneumonia was defined as growth of a pathogenic organism from sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoscopic or blind BAL fluid when tracheal aspirates and bronchoscopic or blind BAL fluid were obtained in patients with NVHAP within 24 h after respiratory failure developed. Additionally, a positive urinary antigen test result for Legionella qualified as a positive culture result, as did positive qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test results for respiratory viruses, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (FilmArray Respiratory Panel, BioFire Diagnostics).\n\nWe selected control subjects by using a risk set sampling scheme. Four control subjects were selected for each case, matched on age, sex, race, and hospital admission date within 1 month of the case patient admission date. A random sample of matched control patients was selected for each case of NVHAP using a random number generator.\n\nThe main end point evaluated was hospital mortality. Secondary measures included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and 30-day readmission after the index hospitalization.\n\nThe primary data analysis compared patients with NVHAP to those without NVHAP. Categorical variables were compared using the c 2 or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Data from the matched case-control study were analyzed using conditional fixed-effect logistic analysis. Model goodness of fit was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. All tests were two-tailed, and P values < .05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22.0 (SPSS).\n\njournal.publications.chestnet.org\n\nA total of 174 cases of NVHAP were identified, and 696 control subjects were selected (Fig 1) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 1 each for Moraxella catarrhalis, Citrobacter koseri, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans), and gram-positive bacteria were found in 20 patients (11.5%) (17 S aureus, two beta-hemolytic streptococci group F, and 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae). Among S aureus isolates, nine were methicillin resistant (52.9%), whereas 12 of the gram-negative isolates (48.0%) were resistant to ceftriaxone (representing an antibiotic typically prescribed for pneumonia in patients without risk factors for antibiotic resistance).\n\nThe mean duration to occurrence of NVHAP was on hospital day 4.2 AE 3.8. Characteristics of case patients and control subjects are listed in Table 1 . Patients with NVHAP were more likely to have higher baseline comorbidity on admission based on the Charlson comorbidity index and to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patient outcomes are shown in Table 2 . Patients with NVHAP were statistically more likely to die during their hospital stay compared with patients without NVHAP (15.5% vs 1.6%; P < .01). Similarly, patients with NVHAP were more likely to require transfer to an ICU (56.3% vs 22.8%; P < .01) and mechanical ventilation (19.0% vs 3.9%; P < .01) and to have a longer hospital length of stay (median, 15.9 vs 4.4 days; P < .01). Thirty-day hospital readmission rates were similar between the two study groups.\n\nAdjusted odds ratios by conditional logistic regression for variables evaluated for their association with hospital mortality are presented in Table 3 . NVHAP with an adjusted OR of 8.4 (95% CI, 5.6-2.5) along with mechanical ventilation and increasing Charlson comorbidity scores were associated with a greater risk of hospital mortality. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggests that our model fit the data (P \u00bc .76). Mortality was greater for patients with NVHAP stratified by Charlson comorbidity index (Fig 2) .\n\nThis study found that the occurrence of NVHAP was associated with adverse outcomes, including a greater risk of hospital mortality. Hospital resource use was also found to be greater for patients in whom NVHAP developed, as evidenced by greater ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and longer length of stay. Thirty-day hospital readmission was not found to be different between patients with and those without NVHAP. We also found that a viral cause for NVHAP was common, accounting for 24.4% of all cases. The case-control study identified a strong association between hospital mortality and NVHAP. More recently, with the routine application of commercially available viral multiplex testing, Crotty 14 Despite a lower proportion of identified pathogens in the patients with NVHAP compared with those with VAP, the type of microbiological isolates and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of whether pneumonia was acquired during or without mechanical ventilation. This finding would suggest that patient-specific findings, such as severity of illness and immune function, may be more important factors predisposing to nosocomial pneumonia than previous intubation. Moreover, both types of patients should receive similar empirical antibiotic treatment and benefit from preventive measures that are preferentially directed at intubated individuals. Hospital-based quality-improvement initiatives have primarily focused on preventing the occurrence of VAP and not NVHAP. 19, 20 However, it has been difficult to demonstrate attributable mortality from VAP because of the overall severity of illness in the \"at risk\" ventilated patient population. 6 This may account for the inability of the majority of VAP prevention studies to demonstrate reductions in mortality. Our data suggest that NVHAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality excess and that the prevention of NVHAP could potentially improve patient outcomes.\n\nThe emergence of MDR pathogens as a cause of HAP has also resulted in greater administration of inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy, which is associated with excess patient mortality. 21 MDR infection in NVHAP is increasingly common in many parts of the world, resulting in the delayed administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy. [22] [23] [24] Moreover, attributable mortality from HAP may be greater than that associated with VAP because of the lower severity of illness existing at baseline in patients with HAP compared with those with VAP. 25 Several limitations of our study should be recognized. First, the retrospective design did not allow for determination of the cause of mortality. Furthermore, it is possible that we did not identify all cases of NVHAP given that we used respiratory culture results and not International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to screen for study entry. This was purposely done to obtain a patient cohort for whom the treating physicians had a high enough suspicion for pneumonia to obtain microbiological cultures. Second, the data are derived from a single center, and this necessarily limits the generalizability of our findings. As such, our results may not reflect what one might see at other institutions. For example, Barnes-Jewish Hospital has a regional referral pattern that includes community hospitals, regional long-term acute care hospitals, nursing homes, and chronic wound, dialysis, and infusion clinics. Patients transferred from these settings are more likely to be infected with potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This may explain the relatively high rates of infection with potentially antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and S aureus. Third, given our sample size, we may have lacked power to identify all important confounders that could affect our mortality end point. Fourth, we did not use a protocol for obtaining specific types of culture samples in all patients, rather deferring this evaluation to the treating physicians. This may have contributed to sampling errors in identifying cases of NVHAP. Fifth, we limited the number of matching variables to maximize the number of patients with NVHAP in our study analysis. This may have contributed to unidentified differences in the case and control populations, such as severity of illness or admission diagnoses, which may have contributed to the outcome differences observed. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that bacterial coinfection was present among patients with a viral cause of NVHAP. Antibiotic administration may have limited the ability of conventional culture methods to identify antibiotic-susceptible bacteria in that setting.\n\nIn summary, our data suggest that the occurrence of NVHAP is associated with adverse patient outcomes and can be caused by both bacterial and viral pathogens.\n\nInterventional studies aimed at the prevention of NVHAP are required to determine whether the consequences of NVHAP can be avoided and patient outcomes improved."}
