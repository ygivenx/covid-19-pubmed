The interface between these two components forms the 157 tRNA binding sites of the small subunit. The head of the 40S subunit is 158 a dynamic component, modifying its relative orientation respect the body. 159 This dynamic is of critical importance in two aspects of translation: the po- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/606236 doi: bioRxiv preprint sition respects the 40S body ( Fig. 3A and B) . The IAPV-IRES seems to follow the movement of the 40S head, pivoting around the anchored PKI and 190 SL-IV which are exceptionally stabilized by ribosomal elements from both 191 head and body, effectively \"clamping\" the IRES to the 40S subunit ( Fig. 3D   192 and E).\n\nThe three-way helical junction modeled in the PKI of the IAPV-IRES resem-194 bles a \"hammer\" shape, with SL-III coaxially stacked on top of the ASL-like The binary IAPV-IRES/80S complex populates three mayor conformations, 218 with limited differences between them (Fig. 1E ). The majority of particles 219 were assigned to a class where the 40S subunit exhibit a small degree of 220 intersubunit rotation (aprox. 1 \u2022 ) compared to the unrotated, canonical con- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/606236 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Fig. 6C, left) .\n\nThe SL-III seems to play an important role in orienting the IRES unit formed 295 by the ASL/SL-III to a position that perfectly matches that of a canonical P 296 site tRNA (Fig. 6D) . Nucleotides belonging to the SL-III establish contacts 297 with several residues of ribosomal proteins uL5 and uL16 as well as with the 298 28S rRNA nucleotide A4255, all components of the large ribosomal subunit 299 (60S) (Fig. 6C, right) . 300 In canonical translocation, the movement of tRNAs and mRNA has to be 301 coordinated in order to vacate the ribosomal A site for the next incom- icking a pre-translocation state of the ribosome with tRNAs (Fig. 7, top) .

The picked particles 77 were binned 4 times and subjected to a 2D classification to separate the 40S 78 and 80S particles. We then employed 3D Refine to generate initial consensus 79 models from both the 40S and 80S particle sets (Fig. S1 ).
