Regardless of cause, treatment with receptor antagonists of HI histaminergic (meclizine, diphenhydramine) or M 1 cholinergic (scopolamine) receptors helps to alleviate nausea.\n\n14. How can nutrition be addressed in a vomiting patient?\n\nEnteral nutrition can be given to a vomiting patient only through a jejunostomy feeding tube. Nasogastric, pharyngostomy, esophagostomy, and gastrostomy feeding tubes aggravate vomiting by stimulating gastric secretions and motility. Although jejunostomy feeding stimulates some pancreatic activity, there is no risk of tube aspiration or direct gastric stimulation as with other feeding tubes. Radiographic confirmation of tube position is mandatory after emesis to prevent iatrogenic aspiration pneumonia. Parenteral nutrition is another means of providing calories while bypassing the 01 tract. 15 . What is the significance of nonproductive vomiting?\n\nNonproductive vomiting is a symptom of gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV). GDV primarily affects large-breed dogs and results in abdominal distention and circulatory shock.\n\nA client telephones about her vomiting dog. What is your first concern?\n\nIn talking to clients over the telephone, it is imperative to rule out possible GDV before suggesting conservative management of the vomiting dog. When the stomach twists on its axis, it may cut off blood supply to the gastric walls and spleen. The sooner the animal is treated for shock and the GDV surgically corrected, the better the prognosis for recovery. Diarrhea may result in dramatic loss of fluids. Patients often present with severe dehydration. Primary gastrointestinal (01) disease may result in loss of electrolytes and inability to absorb nutrients, especially proteins. Many causes of diarrhea damage the mucosal integrity of the bowel, allowing normal intestinal flora to cross into the bloodstream. Animals with diarrhea may present in shock from blood loss, fluid loss, and sepsis.\n\n2. What is the most important treatment for patients with severe diarrhea?\n\nPatients with diarrhea may be unable to maintain hydration. Common causes of diarrhea leave the patient weak and anorectic. Even if an animal drinks, intestinal pathology may prevent adequate absorption of water. Parenteral fluid therapy is necessary to prevent dehydration and to support the patient until normal intestinal function is restored. Hospitalized patients receiving intravenous fluids may become dehydrated if 01 losses of fluid are not quantified and returned to the patient. Fluid volumes should be based on maintenance volumes plus dehydration plus ongoing losses. Daily body weight can be used to determine precisely whether fluid therapy is adequate.\n\nAcute diarrhea may result from a change in diet, dietary indiscretion, or intolerance to a type of food or medicine. Dietary indiscretions include overeating and ingestion of spoiled garbage, decomposing carrion, and abrasive or other nondigestible foreign material. Intestinal parasites, viruses, bacteria, and rickettsia are potential causes of infectious diarrhea. New sources of stress or metabolic disturbances also may cause acute diarrhea. 4 . How should an animal presenting with diarrhea be managed?\n\nAll diarrhea, acute or chronic, should be considered infectious until proved otherwise. Young animals, debilitated animals, and animals from shelters or kennels are most likely to have infectious diarrhea. Hospital staff should plan to isolate such animals immediately. If possible, they should be treated as outpatients. Systemically ill and dehydrated patients should be hospitalized away from other animals. Feces should be removed and kept away from other animals. Personnel should wear protective clothing and wash hands, stethoscopes, and thermometers before handling other patients.\n\nDiarrhea is often classified as either small bowel or large bowel. A large volume of stool usually without increased frequency or urgency characterizes small-bowel diarrhea. Small-bowel diarrhea results from small intestine dysfunction due either to primary GI disease or diseases of other digestive organs such as the liver and pancreas. Large-bowel diarrhea refers to cecal, colonic, or rectal etiologies. Large-bowel diarrhea is characteristically small in volume, is associated with blood and mucus, and usually presents with signs of tenesmus.\n\n6. What steps should be taken to identify the cause of acute diarrhea?\n\nThe diarrhea should be classified as either small bowel or large bowel. Clients should be questioned about duration of signs, possible exposure to other animals, travel history, vaccination status, and new stress in the animal's life. A complete physical exam should be followed by fecal examination to look for parasites and, when indicated, to test for canine parvovirus. Animals with signs of systemic illness should be checked for other primary problems. A minimal database includes complete blood count, electrolytes, and serum chemistries. Fecal cultures for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni. Yersinia enterocolitica. and Shigella spp. are indicated when an infectious cause is strongly suggested.\n\nIntestinal disease may cause diarrhea through decreased absorption, hypersecretion, increased permeability, and abnormal motility. Poor absorption (osmotic diarrhea) results in accumulation of nonabsorbable solutes in the gut. These solutes draw water into the lumen of the gut and result in bulky, fluid diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea occurs when the mucosal lining of the bowel is stimulated to secrete fluid and electrolytes without compensatory changes in absorption, permeability, or osmotic gradients. Increased permeability (exudative diarrhea) is usually accompanied by increased transmural hydrostastic pressure. The result is loss of protein-rich fluid into the intestinal lumen.\n\nWhen confronted with a young animal with diarrhea, viral enteritis is usually a top differential diagnosis. Coronavirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus are among the agents identified in the stools of diarrhetic dogs and cats. Bacterial pathogens include enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Clostridium spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, and Bacillus piliformis (Tyzzer's disease). Systemic mycoses such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Aspergillus spp., and Candida albicans may affect GI function and result in diarrhea. 9. What are the potential zoonotic causes of diarrhea in small animals? Several important bacterial and parasitic zoonoses are seen in small animals with diarrhea. The enteric bacteria of zoonotic significance include Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica. Giardia spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum. Toxocara canis. Toxascaris leonina, Uncinaria stenocephala. Ancylostoma caninum. Strongyloides stercoralis. Echinococcus multilocularis. and Echinococcus granulosa are the most significant enteric parasite zoonoses in small animals and often cause clinical disease.\n\n10. Is it common to find zoonotic agents in dog feces?\n\nIdentifying infectious and potentially zoonotic agents requires appropriate testing. In a survey of 131 fecal samples from diarrhetic and normal dogs, subjected to fecal analysis, bacterial culture, viral screening, and immune fluorescent testing for Giardia spp. and C. jejuni, potentially zoonotic agents were detected in 16%.\n\n11. What are the common iatrogenic causes of diarrhea?\n\nSudden changes in an animal's diet may cause diarrhea. A gradual transition in diet is recommended to prevent this problem. Osmotic diarrhea is a common complication of enteral feeding in critically ill patients with esophagostomy, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy feeding tubes. Many drugs may cause acute intestinal upset resulting in diarrhea.\n\nWith any injury to intestinal mucosa, nemorrhage and melena are often noted. The presence of blood, either fresh or digested, implies damage to the lining of the bowel. Normal enteric bacteria may become pathogenic if allowed to cross the mucosal barrier and enter the circulation. Antibiotic therapy is indicated.\n\nAcute diarrhea may be managed conservatively by withholding food for 12-24 hours to allow the GI tract time to heal. Small, bland, low-fat meals are then started. Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis should be monitored closely. Parenteral fluid replacement and oral supplementation with glucose-electrolyte solutions may be used to maintain hydration.\n\n14. What are some nonspecific drug therapies for diarrhea? How do they work?\n\nOpiate agonists (diphenoxylate, loperamide, and paregoric) work by stimulating circular smooth muscle contraction and absorption while inhibiting secretion of fluid and electrolytes. Ondansetron and dolasetron are 5-HT 3 serotonin antagonists that inhibit chloride and water secretion. Sulfasalazine, prednisone, and 5-arninosalicylate are prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. Examples of intraluminal absorbents and protectants include kaolin-pectin, bismuth, and barium sulfate. Bismuth subsalicylate is a protectant and also has antisecretory and antiendotoxin effects. It should be used with caution in patients sensitive to salicylates. Antibiotics are indicated only for bacterial diarrhea and animals with significant disruption of intestinal mucosa.\n\n15. When should a detailed diagnostic work-up be recommended? Any animal that does not respond to routine supportive care and whose condition is deteriorating should be evaluated more completely. Intestinal biopsy is usually required for diagnosis in animals with chronic, unresponsive diarrhea. Increasing clinical signs and owner frustration may result from prolonged symptomatic care. Infiltrative and inflammatory diseases of the bowel should be pursued when a patient continues to have diarrhea despite dietary and medical intervention. "}
