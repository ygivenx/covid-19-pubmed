{"title": "/6 AVIAN IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DISEASES AND IMMUNE EVASION", "body": "Control of infectious diseases is essential for the production of healthy poultry flocks and this is generally achieved by extensive vaccination programmes in combination with good management practices including biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of infection. The success of vaccination programmes depends on the ability of the birds to mount a vigorous immune response after vaccination. In addition to the innate ability of a particular bird to mount an immune response to a vaccine or an infection there are numerous external factors influencing the level of protective immunity. The purpose of this chapter is to review the mechanisms, and impact of immunosuppression, which can have multiple causes, and the ability of pathogens to counteract immune responses by immunoevasion. Immunosuppression is defined as \"A state of temporary or permanent dysfunction of the immune response resulting from insults to the immune system and leading to increased susceptibility to disease\" as originally proposed by Dohms and Sail (1984) with the addition of \"and often a suboptimal antibody response\" as suggested by Liitticken (1997) . Such dysfunction often results from infection of cells of the immune system, leading to their impaired function against the primary and subsequent infections, in a non-specific manner. For this chapter, we define immunoevasion as \"Pathogeninitiated responses counteracting the immune responses to the specific pathogen\". The major difference is that immunosuppression is the consequence of the overall replicative strategy of the causative agent, resulting in increased susceptibility to other pathogens but not necessarily to the causative agent, while immunoevasion is achieved by specific pathogen-encoded determinants, primarily favouring replication of the causative agent. In some instances, infections can result in immunosuppression and immunoevasion, e.g. infection with Marek's disease virus (MDV) .\n\nImmunosuppression is a major problem for the poultry industry but actual figures indicating the scale of the problem are hard to find. Infection with pathogens and/or environmental factors, including management errors, can result in immunosuppression and interactions between the two usually exacerbate the problem. Any infection causing clinical disease may result in immunosuppression, but the focus will be on pathogen-induced immunosuppression in the absence of clinical disease. Viruses causing immunosuppression and/or clinical disease at any age include MDV, reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), reovirus, and, although controversial, avian leukosis virus (ALV). Other pathogens, e.g. chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV), may cause clinical disease in young chicks but the major damage consists of subclinical infection causing immunosuppression. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) also causes clinical disease in young chicks, but this acute infection results in damage to immune tissue, particularly the bursa of Fabricius and bursa-derived lymphocytes, compromising the host's ability to mount effective responses upon subsequent infection by other pathogens. Caution is needed, however, in the interpretation of the immunosuppressive effects caused by reovirus, MDV, REV, and IBDV especially with older studies, because it is not always clear if these viruses were free of CIAV. For example, Jakowski et al. (1970) reported haematopoietic tissue destruction in chickens with Marek's disease (MD), but it was later learned that tumour material harvested from these birds was positive for CIAV (Wellenstein, personal communication, cited by Schat, 2003) . In addition to viral infections, coccidial infections have been linked to immunosuppression.\n\nMost environmental factors causing immunosuppression are related to management problems such as inadequate water or food supply, ammonia in the houses, temperature stress, \"social interactions within a flock\", etc. In addition, the presence of fungal toxins in feed is an environmental stressor. Most of these stressors enhance the production of corticosterone. Selection for high versus low corticosterone concentration in blood plasma can influence the degree of stressinduced immunosuppresion.\n\nIt has been recognized for a long time that social stress can exacerbate disease. A classic example is the study by Gross (1972) in which MDV-exposed chickens were kept in a socially stressful environment by moving every day one chicken from one cage into another cage. These chickens developed a higher incidence of tumours than the MDV-infected chickens kept in a low stress environment. The effects of social stress on MD were especially enhanced in birds selected for high plasma corticosterone concentrations. Inoculation with chemicals blocking 11-13 hydroxylase, which mediates the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone in the adrenal glands, reduced the impact of social stress on MD and other diseases (Gross, 1972 (Gross, , 1989 . Inoculation of chickens with corticosterone using pharmacological doses resulted in a rapid lymphoid depletion in thymus, bursa, and spleen (Dohms and Metz, 1991) . These authors suggested that bacterial infections (e.g. Escherichia coli) may cause stress-type lesions in the bursa similar to corticosterone-induced lymphoid depletion.\n\nThe importance of fungal stressors has been reviewed by Bondy and Pestka (2000) . Aflatoxin is the best known fungal stressor for poultry but fumonisins and ochratoxins have also been implicated as immunotoxicants in chickens and turkeys. Bondy and Pestka (2000) suggested that the effects are more immunomodulatory than immunosuppressive but the molecular basis for the immunomodulation is poorly understood. Ingestion of aflatoxins can result in decreased antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens, decreased macrophage functions, and decreased cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, but these effects are dose-dependent (Bondy and Pestka, 2000) . Chicks hatched from hens fed on diets containing aflatoxins also showed impaired immune functions when tested between 2 and 3 weeks of age (Qureshi et al., 1998) , but it is not known how long after hatching the effects last. These results have important implications and can confound the interpretation of immune dysfunctions in commercial flocks as a confounding factor when virally induced immunosuppression occurs in young birds. Feed contaminated with fumonisins and ochratoxins also impairs antibody responses and macrophage functions, but it is not clear if immunosuppression occurs in chicks hatched from hens fed contaminated diets (Bondy and Pestka, 2000) .\n\nTwo groups of coccidian species have been linked to immunosuppression, Cryptosporidium baileyi and Eimeria spp., although the evidence is rather limited in both cases. Infection with the latter has been linked to decreased mitogen stimulation responses (Rose and Hesketh, 1984) , but antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens were not affected (Bhanushali and Long, 1985) . C. baileyi replicates in the epithelial cells of the bursa of Fabricius and respiratory tract of chickens and is probably more prevalent than diagnostic cases indicate (McDougald, 2003) . Oral inoculation of young chickens with high doses of C. baileyi caused histopathological lesions in the epithelium and lamina propia of the bursa (Rhee et al., 1997) and decreased antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens (Rhee et al., 1998b (Rhee et al., , 1998c . Titres to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were also decreased after inoculation of 2-day-old chicks with C. baileyi. (Rhee et al., 1998a (Rhee et al., , 1998d . On the other hand, Abbassi et al. (2000a Abbassi et al. ( , 2000b found that infection with C. baileyi neither increased MD nor did it reduce the efficacy of the MDV vaccine strain CVI988. Interestingly, MDV infection before or after challenge with C. baileyi aggravated the latter. Likewise, MDV vaccination followed 4 days later with C. baileyi challenge caused respiratory lesions within 6 days (see also section MDV).\n\nAs mentioned before we will only discuss viruses that may cause immunosuppression independently of clinical symptoms, although the independence may be a temporal feature, as is the case for the tumour-inducing viruses and, depending on the age of challenge, CIAV, and IBDV. The following viruses and their effects on the immune responses will be discussed: IBDV, CIAV, reovirus, and the three tumour-inducing viruses ALV, REV, and MDV. Detailed information on virus replication, pathogenesis, pathology and immune responses for these viruses can be found in several chapters in Diseases of Poultry, 11th edition and other textbooks on avian diseases.\n\nIBDV, belonging to the Birnaviridae, has been divided into two serotypes, of which only serotype 1 causes immunosuppression and disease in chickens. Several pathotypes are recognized within serotype i varying from mild to very virulent. More recently, strains within group 1 have been further subdivided into genetic groups based on restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. It has been recognized for a long time that serotype 1 strains can cause severe immunosuppression with impaired antibody responses and increased susceptibility to other pathogens, especially when birds are infected before 3 weeks of age (reviewed by Sharma et al., 1994 Sharma et al., , 2000 Lukert and Saif, 2003) .\n\nThe genome of IBDV is characterized by a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome consisting of segments A and B. Segment B codes for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and segment A codes for two structural proteins, VP2 and VP3, an autoprotease, VP4, and a small non-structural peptide, VP5, which partly overlaps with the open reading frame (ORF) coding for VP234 (Lukert and Saif, 2003) . The polyprotein VP234, but not the mature VP2, VP3 or VP4, arrests B cell division probably by interfering with the cell cycle, because it does not affect cell viability (Peters et al., 2004) . Using a reverse genetics approach, Yao et al. (1998) showed that deletion of VP5 did not prevent virus replication in vivo but did prevent the development of bursal lesions suggesting a role for VP5 in the pathogenesis. Interestingly, in vitro studies suggest that very early after infection VP5 is anti-apoptotic (Liu and Vakharia, 2006) , but during later stages VP5 accumulates in the plasma membrane (Lombardo et al., 2000) and causes apoptosis (Yao and Vakharia, 2001) . VP2 has also been linked to apoptosis when expressed alone from transfected RNA (Rodriguez-Lecompte et al., 2005) . In summary, the molecular basis for IBDV-induced suppression of the immune response is the result of a complex set of interactions between the different viral proteins and infected B cells.\n\nIt has been known since the 1970s that IBDV infection in chicks younger than 3 weeks of age causes severe damage to the bursa of Fabricius with depletion of B cells expressing surface immunoglobulin (Ig)M affecting mostly primary antibody responses. Infection, especially at 1 day of age, also results in a significant decrease of surface Ig-expressing B cells in spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes but does not affect circulating CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 \u00a7 T cells (Hirai et al., 1981; Rodenberg et al., 1994) . The damage to the bursa is transient, follicles become repopulated with lymphocytes and tissue architecture is restored, but primary antibody responses remain depressed until at least 7 weeks post-infection (pi), but ultimately also recover. The duration of the recovery process depends on the age of infection and the virulence of the strain (Vervelde and Davison, 1997; Kim et al., 1999) . Recently, Withers et al. (2005 described two t~cpes of follicles emerging after recovery from IBDV infection in neonatal chicks: small follicles lacking a distinct cortex and medulla and large follicles with rapidly proliferating B cells and a normal structure. B cells in the large follicles were still capable of undergoing gene conversion and may have been derived from small numbers of surviving bursal stem cells. In contrast, the B cells in the small follicles were considered to be derived from more mature B cells that had already undergone gene conversion. These data suggest that the ability to recover from IBDV-induced suppression of antibody production and diversity is based on the proportion of small versus large follicles developing after infection.\n\nIn addition to replication in B cells, IBDV can also infect and replicate in macrophages. Khatri et al. (2005) found viral RNA and proteins by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, in bursal macrophages between 1 and 7 days pi. The absolute number of macrophages in the bursa was decreased significantly at 3 and 5 days pi. The actual impact on the immune response of this observation is not clear. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1~3, and IL-8 are increased at the transcriptional level in the bursa and spleen, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-~34 is decreased (Kim et al., 1998; Khatri et al., 2005; Eldaghayes et al., 2006) . These different groups of authors reported somewhat conflicting results for the production of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-~ transcription, but these differences could be the result of using different virus strains and/or infecting different age groups. In addition, the production of nitric oxide synthase II -NOS II, previously known as inducible NOS (iNOS) (Bruckdorfer, 2005) -mRNA was also increased in bursal macrophages. Khatri and Sharma (2006) showed that the activation of macrophages is through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF~3) pathway, but it is not clear whether these pathways are activated through specific viral proteins. The alterations in cytokine transcription are compatible with the inflammation in the bursa during the acute infection. However, it is less clear how these changes play a role in IBDV-associated immunosuppression. It will also be important to determine if the changes occur in IBDV-infected macrophages before they undergo lysis or that infection and cytokine deregulation occur in different subpopulations.\n\nAlthough T cells are not susceptible to infection with IBDV, these cells form an important component of the overall immunopathogenesis of IBDV. There is an influx of CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 + cells into the bursa between 1 and 10 days pi (Vervelde and Davison, 1997; Sharma et al., 2000) . In addition to the proposed role of CD8 + cells in lysing virus-infected cells, bursal CD8 + and CD4 + cells may also contribute to the production of NOS II by IFN-~ production or other soluble factors stimulating NOS II transcription in macrophages and subsequent nitric oxide (NO) production. NO can contribute to the inflammatory lesion development but may also be involved in downregulation of splenic T cell responses to mitogens, which is associated with the acute phase of IBDV infection .\n\nIn conclusion, IBDV infection causes a complex set of interactions between B cells, macrophages, and T cells leading to destruction and subsequent partial recovery of the bursa and long-lasting suppression of primary antibody responses. Recent studies by several groups have provided a better insight in the immunopathogenesis of IBDV in young birds. However important questions remain. For example, how can we explain the recovery from infection in the face of suppression of primary antibody responses, if neutralizing antibodies are key to recovery? Do we have to postulate that cell-mediated immunity is far more important than previously believed? Another unresolved question is why young birds mostly develop subclinical disease, while infection of older, antibody-negative birds results in clear-cut pathology including haemorrhages. There may be similarities between the situation in birds with IBDV and in mice with influenza virus, where the immune response is responsible for most tissue damage and in which case the damage can be reduced by treatment with TGF-3 (Williams et al., 2005) .\n\nCIAV is a small DNA virus of approximately 25 nm belonging to the Circoviridae, genus Gyrovirus. It has a single-stranded covalently closed DNA genome of 2.3 kb, which produces one polycistronic transcript coding for 3 proteins. The virus is extremely resistant to disinfectants and can resist heat treatment at 80~ for 15 min. Due to its ubiquitous presence in chicken flocks, small size, and resistance to physical and chemical treatments, it can be present as a contaminant in other viruses especially if these agents are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. As such it can become a confounding factor in studies on immunosuppressive properties of other pathogens.\n\nThe pathogenesis and immunosuppression caused by CIAV have been reviewed recently (Adair, 2000; Schat, 2003; Miller and Schat, 2004 and additional references within these reviews). Infection of chicks may result in clinical disease by vertical transmission, which occurs when hens first become infected during egg production or horizontal transmission during the first few weeks of age. However, most chicks are protected against early infection by maternal antibodies and clinical disease is not frequently seen. Infection after 3 weeks of age is mostly subclinical but may result in significant immunosuppression. The development of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies is essential to curtail virus replication, and immunosuppression caused by IBDV, e.g., has been implicated in prolonged replication of CIAV.\n\nThe small genome coding for only 3 proteins requires the infection of dividing cells in order to use the cellular machinery for viral DNA replication. Dividing cells that are susceptible to infection are haemocytoblasts in the bone marrow, T cell precursors in the thymus or dividing T cells in response to antigenic stimulation. VP3 or apoptin is the most important protein for immunosuppression by causing apoptosis of infected haemocytoblasts, resulting in a decrease in erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and granulocytes. The loss of the latter two cell types is important because thrombocytes and granulocytes are both important effector cells during bacterial infections and secondary bacterial infections (e.g. \"blue-wing disease\") are frequently associated with CIAV-induced immunosuppression. AcJair et al. (1993) reported that CD3+CD8+TCR(~3 spleen cells constitute the major CIAV-infected population in the spleen. The effect of virus replication in these cells is especially important when replication of CIAV occurs at the same time that cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are generated in response to vaccination or infection with a second pathogen. Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat (2003) reported the absence of REV-specific CTL 7 days after birds were co-infected with REV and CIAV, at which time point CIAV was actively replicating, based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Because there was no effect of CIAV infection on transcription of IL-2 or IFN-'~ at 7 days pi it was suggested that the lack of pathogen-specific CTL was caused by CIAV-induced apoptosis of CD8 + cells during the generation of CTL. In contrast to the effect on CTL, natural killer (NK) cells were not affected by CIAV infection . Based on the studies in MSB-1 cells, Peters et al. (2006) recently suggested that VP2 may also play a role in immunosuppression through downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. The importance of this observation for immunosuppression is difficult to evaluate because the assumption is that CIAV-infected cells will become apoptotic.\n\nThe impact of CIAV infection on cytokines has not been well studied and early investigations relied on bio-assays representing the state-of-the-art at the time (reviewed by Miller and Schat, 2004) . More recently quantitative RT-assays have been used to investigate the effects of CIAV infection on cytokines in relation to virus replication. Unfortunately, the few published studies have not included the effect of virus replication prior to 7 days pi, when high levels of virus replication occur (Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2003; van Santen et al., 2004) . At that time, immunosuppressive effects are already evident with impairment of macrophages and CTL (Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2003) , but IFN-% IL-2 and IL-I~ mRNA levels were not affected (Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2003) . Clearly, additional studies using quantitative RT-PCR assays or enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) are needed to determine the impact of CIAV infection on cytokines starting at 2-3 days pi, because viral antigens can be detected in lymphoid tissues and bone marrow as early as 3-4 days pi (Smyth et al., 1993) . Interestingly, the damage to the thymus and bone marrow was quite extensive between 3 and 12 days pi though relatively few cells in these organs were positive for viral antigens. The collapse of the thymus is probably the result of damage to the cytokine network needed for T cell maturation. Detailed studies on early cytokine changes during CIAV infection are essential to gain an understanding of the subsequent immunosuppression.\n\nAvian reoviruses belong to the orthoreovirus genus of the Reoviridae, which have a genome consisting of 10 dsRNA fragments. Avian reovirus infections can cause tenosynovitis in chickens and other diseases, or result in a subclinical infection. Although horizontal transmission is the main route for infection, egg transmission may occur infrequently (Menendez et al., 1975) . Infections with pathogenic, but not non-pathogenic, strains have been associated with depletion of lymphoid cells in the bursa and thymus and decreased serological responses to inactivated NDV (Sharma and Fredericksen, 1987) . However, Montgomery et al. (1986) were unable to find a significant impact of reovirus infection on antibody responses to NDV, sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and Brucella abortus antigen, although a decrease in relative bursa weight and some lymphocyte depletion in the bursa were noted. Reovirus infection decreased the responses of peripheral blood monocytes and splenocytes to mitogens at 7 days pi but not afterwards (Montgomery et al., 1986; Sharma et al., 1994; Pertile et al., 1995 Pertile et al., , 1996 . The latter group showed that removal of plastic-adherent cells primed to produce NO restored mitogen responsiveness of T lymphocytes to some degree and suggested that suppressor macrophages were responsible for the immuno-suppression. Recent work with mammalian species suggests that the regulation of macrophage activation is rather complex. For example, IL-13 may be responsible for the induction of macrophages producing NO (Sinha and Garg, 2000) while IL-10, through the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), may downregulate the inflammatory responses of macrophages (Qasimi et al., 2006) . The $1 genome segment of avian and mammalian reovirus, which has been linked to immunosuppression (Garzelli et al., 1985) , codes for 3 open reading frames (ORF) two of which are non-structural proteins. These two proteins have pleiotropic functions, many of which interfere with cellular signaling pathways (Liu et al., 2005) . Additional research on the interactions of these proteins with cytokine pathways will be important to more fully understand reovirus-induced immunosuppression in chickens.\n\nThe three tumour viruses associated with lymphoid tumours, MDV, ALV, and REV, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 19. In this chapter, only the immunosuppressive aspects are reviewed. Extensive reviews on the diseases caused by these viruses are available (Fadly and Payne, 2003; Witter and Fadly, 2003; Witter and Schat, 2003) .\n\nMDV, an alphaherpesvirus causing tumours of T lymphocytes in chickens, has attracted the attention of virologists and immunologists, since highly successful vaccines protecting against the disease became available during the early 1970s. Since then, the virus has evolved from virulent to very virulent (vv) and more recently to vv+ pathotypes (Witter, 1997) . The increase in pathogenicity not only increased the incidence of tumours but was also linked to some new neurological syndromes (Gimeno et al., 2002) . In addition, the vv+ strains caused more severe damage to the lymphoid organs than virulent and vv pathotypes (Calnek et al., 1998) probably leading to increased immunosuppression.\n\nImmunosuppression caused by MDV has recently been reviewed by Schat and Markowski-Grimsrud (2001) and Schat (2004) and in this chapter we will only present the most important aspects of MDV immunosuppression and immunoevasion (see section immunoevasion). MDVassociated immunosuppression is often divided into an early immunosuppression phase during the cytolytic infection and a late immunosuppression phase, when virus is reactivated and tumours develop. One of the key characteristics of the early immunosuppression is the destruction of lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs during the first 2 weeks of infection causing severe atrophy of the thymus and bursa of Fabricius; this may be permanent or transient depending on the pathotype of MDV. The model for the pathogenesis of MD, as originally outlined by Calnek (1986) and Schat (1987) and recently reviewed by Calnek (2001) , provides the basis for the understanding how MDV causes both B and T cell depletion. Briefly, chickens become infected through cell-free virus present in feather-follicle dander. Virus is transferred to the lymphoid organs probably through macrophages and replicates first in B lymphocytes causing a productive-restrictive infection in which cell-associated but not cell-free MDV is produced and the infected cells are destined to die. This phase is often referred to as the cytolytic phase. As a consequence of the production of viral antigens and subsequent immune responses, T cells become activated expressing MHC class II antigens and other activation markers. In contrast to resting T cells, activated T cells are susceptible to MDV infection and become infected. Normally, MDV establishes a latent infection in activated T cells through poorly understood mechanisms (Morgan et al., 2001b) , although cytokines most likely play a role in the process . Depending on the pathotype of MDV and the genetic resistance of the host, latency may be permanent, temporarily followed by a secondary cytolytic cycle, additional immunosuppression and tumour development, or absent with continuous virus replication and, frequently, early mortality.\n\nAs early as 3 days pi, the expression of IFN-~ is upregulated (Xing and Schat, 2000) , which led Schat and Markowski-Grimsrud (2001) to suggest that this may upregulate the expression of IL-8 receptors. The upregulation of IL-8 receptors is likely an essential step in the transfer of cellassociated MDV from B cells to activated T cells, allowing viral IL-8 (VIL-8) produced during the lytic infection to attract activated T cells. The increased cytolytic infection, and thus increased damage to the lymphoid organs associated with some of the vv+ pathotypes, may be caused by a more effective transfer of MDV from B to T cells due to increased levels of vlL-8 production combined with the inability to establish latency after 7 days pi. Jarosinski et al. (2003) reported that vv+ strains produced higher levels of vlL-8 than less virulent strains, but this is likely the consequence of increased virus replication (Yunis et al., 2004) rather than an intrinsic ability to enhance vlL-8 production. The importance of vlL-8 for the cytolytic infection is further shown by the fact that tissue culture-attenuated strains have no or very low vlL-8 transcript levels (Jarosinski et al., 2003) and that deletion of vlL-8 (Cortes and Cardona, 2004; Cui et al., 2005) or deletion of exon 1 of vlL-8 (Jarosinski and Schat, 2007) result in attenuation of the cytolytic infection. The reasons for the continued replication of vv+ MDV instead of establishment of latency have not been elucidated. It is of interest to note that vv+ MDV causes a highly significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines as early as 4 days pi in spleen and brain tissues (Jarosinski et al., 2005; Careem et al., 2006) . It is certainly feasible that the distortion in cytokine profile impacts on the production of cytokines involved in the induction and/or maintenance of latency (Volpini et al., 1995) with the consequence of a prolonged cytolytic infection leading to more profound immunosuppression.\n\nApoptosis is the most likely mechanism responsible for cell death during the cytolytic infection in the lymphoid organs (Morimura et al., 1996 (Morimura et al., , 1997 affecting CD4*CD8 \u00a7 thymocytes. What needs to be resolved is: do MDV-infected thymocytes become apoptotic or does MDVinduced cytokine deregulation affecting thymocyte maturation cause apoptosis of non-infected cells and a collapse of thymus architecture (Schat, 2004 )? The latter is certainly possible, based on the recent evidence that cytokines can be deregulated especially after infection with vv+ strains. MDV infection can also cause apoptosis in CD4 \u00a7 peripheral T cells, but CD8 \u00a7 T cells are apparently not affected (Morimura et al., 1995) . The reasons for the latter are not clear because CD8 \u00a7 T cells can be infected with and transformed by MDV (Baigent et al., 1998; Calnek et al., 1989) . Thus far, it has not been resolved which MDV gene products are responsible for the immunsuppression. It is likely that the SORF2 gene plays a role, based on two studies using opposing experimental strategies. Deletion mutants lacking several ORF, including SORF2, caused decreased cytolytic infection without preventing tumour formation (Parcells et al., 1995) . Upregulation of SORF2 expression through the insertion of the REV long terminal repeat (LTR) resulted in enhanced cytolytic infection in the absence of tumour development .\n\nIn addition to the destruction of lymphoid tissues, MDV also induces immune suppression through activation of macrophages. These macrophages were able to inhibit mitogen stimulation of T cells obtained from non-infected chickens (Lee et al., 1978) . Schat and Markowski-Grimsrud (2001) suggested that this inhibition was likely the consequence of MDV-induced NO production by the macrophages and was protective rather than immunosuppressive by reducing the pool of activated T cells. The concept of immunosuppression around 7 day pi is conflicting because on the one hand there is destruction of lymphoid tissue, potential immunoevasion and the activation Of \"suppressor\" macrophages, while at the same time CTL against several MDV proteins are present Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2002) . In contrast with the more classical strains, vv+ strains may actually infect macrophages (Barrow et al., 2003a) and macrophages have been associated with MDV lesions in the brain (Barrow et al., 2003b ; B.L Njaa, K.W. Jarosinski and K.A. Schat, unpublished data) . The importance of these observations for immunosuppression is not clear; more likely it will be part of the enhanced proinflammatory response in the brain (Jarosinski et al., 2005) .\n\nLate immunosuppression can be caused by lytic infection of lymphoid cells upon reactivation of MDV from latency, causing similar effects on the immune system as during the early lytic infection. In addition, tumour cells may cause immunosuppression (reviewed by Schat, 2004) . However, tumour-induced immunosuppression is directly the consequence of a clinical disease and will not be discussed here.\n\nMDV vaccine strains can also cause immunosuppression. Friedman et al. (1992) showed that vaccination with SB-1 (a serotype 2 MDV strain) together with herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) or CVI988 (a serotype 1 vaccine strain) caused a significant decrease in B lymphocyte activation and antibody production after in vitro stimulation with Salmonella typhimurium or bovine serum albumin (BSA) inoculation, respectively. E. coli-caused mortality was increased in vaccinated chicks independently of the MDV vaccine used, when challenged at 11 or 14 days post-vaccination, but only occurred in chicks vaccinated with CVI988 when these were challenged at 21 days post-vaccination. Islam et al. (2002) also reported that HVT did not cause increased mortality when chickens were challenged with E. coli at 28 days post-vaccination, although between 3 and 10 days HVT caused a significant decrease in B and T lymphocyte numbers. Vaccination with CVI988 also precipitated lesions when chicks were challenged with C. baileyi 4 days post-vaccination (see section Coccidia-Induced Immunosuppression). The importance of vaccine-induced immunosuppression is not clear in commercial flocks and is far less important than the protection against MD challenge. The possibility that in ovo vaccination with HVT might induce tolerance was investigated by Zhang and Sharma (2003) . Inoculation between 0 and 14 days of embryonation-induced tolerance to HVT but not to BSA. In contrast vaccination at 18 days of embryonation, which is the approximate time for in ovo vaccination, did not induce tolerance to HVT.\n\nALV and REV belong to the Retroviridae. ALV are classified as exogenous or endogenous (or subgroup E) viruses and the former are further divided in subgroups A, B, C, D, and J. Subgroups A-D are associated with infection of Leghorn type chickens, but subgroups C and D are of little practical importance for the poultry industry. ALV-J was first described during the late 1980s and is mostly associated with meat-type birds. ALV and REV can also be divided into defective viruses and non-defective (nd) or helper viruses. The defective viruses have often acquired cellular onc genes and cause a rapid onset of tumours and death. These viruses have little importance for immunosuppression due to the rapid mortality. The nd viruses can also cause tumours, but the transformation occurs through activation of cellular onc genes by the viral LTR.\n\nREV and exogenous ALV can be transmitted congenitally or horizontally. Chicks hatched from congenitally-infected eggs are tolerant and unable to produce VN antibodies to the virus. These chickens will be viraemic, antibody negative (V+A-) and are likely to develop tumours or in the case of REV tumours and/or runting and stunting. Horizontal transmission during, or shortly after, hatching can also result in tolerance. This risk is enhanced in chicks when subgroup E or glycoprotein (gp)85 of subgroup E is expressed during embryonal development (Smith et al., 1991) or after IBDV infection at 1 day or 6 weeks of age. IBDV infection decreased the frequency of VN antibody-positive chickens, and increased virus shedding and viraemia levels significantly, although these effects were dependent on the genetic background of the birds. In contrast infection with REV at 1 day of age or MDV at 2 weeks of age had no significant impact on ALV shedding, viraemia, and antibody development (Fadly et al., 1985) . The induction of tolerance after congenital infection is virus specific and is not a general inability to produce antibodies against other pathogens than ALV or REV. For example, chickens congenitally infected with a specific strain of ALV-A were able to produce antibodies to other subgroup A strains (Meyers, 1976) and influenza virus, but were partly tolerant to ALV-B (Meyers and Dougherty, 1971) .\n\nThe importance of ALV as an immunosuppressive virus is not clear and probably depends on the subgroup. Fadly et al. (1982) reported that congenital infection with RAV-1, a subgroup A virus, did not suppress antibody responses, mitogen stimulation, or the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) skin test, even in birds developing tumours. Rup et al. (1982) also reported that subgroup A viruses did not affect mitogen responsiveness of spleen lymphocytes. Likewise, several groups have shown that ALV-J infection does not affect cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to a significant degree. However, most assays for immune responses and resistance to other diseases were marginally lower in ALV-J infected than in control chickens (Stedman et al., 2001; Landman et al., 2002; Spackman et al., 2003) , suggesting, but not proving, that immunosuppression may be associated with ALV-J infection.\n\nIn contrast to ALV-A and -J, subgroup B viruses have been linked to suppression of CMI responses. In ovo infection with MAV-2(O) resulted in severe damage to lymphoid organs, suppressed antibody responses and mitogenic responsiveness (Hirota et al., 1980) . Rup et al. (1982) and Cummins and Smith (1987) showed that MAV-2(O) caused a temporary dysfunction of macrophages suppressing the responses of spleen cells to mitogens. The depressed responses were present as early as 3 days pi and lasted until 21 days pi. Macrophage dysfunction reduced the ability to clear bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes (Cummins et al., 1988) . A second subgroup B virus, avian erythroblastosis virus, an acute transforming, defective virus, and its associated helper virus, also suppressed T cell responses to mitogens, but in this case the suppression was directly related to T cells and not macrophages (Rao et al., 1990) .\n\nREV infections have frequently been linked to depressed humoral and CMI responses. At least theoretically, this could have important practical consequences, because REV infection has often been linked to the use of contaminated MD vaccines (Koyama et al., 1976; Jackson et al., 1977) . Fowlpox viruses (FPV) can carry replication competent REV genomes, which may be expressed in vivo (Diallo et al., 1998) potentially causing immunosuppression. REV infection decreased antibody responses to HVT, MDV, and NDV (e.g. von Biilow, 1977; Yoshida et al., 1981) . In contrast, Fadly et al. (1985) and Witter et al. (1979 Witter et al. ( , 1981 found only decreased primary antibody responses to SRBC and Brucella abortus, and no effect on MDV antibodies, although protective immunity to MD was decreased and ALV infection levels were increased in a commercial line. Embryo inoculation with the T strain, but not with the Cornell C strain (CS) strain, impaired also the secondary immune responses to SRBC and Brucella abortus. The effect of REV infection on MDV was questioned by Buscaglia et al. (1989) because REV infection did not impair the establishment of MDV latency or reactivation from latency. These authors suggested that REV may actually reduce the pool of susceptible cells for MDV replication, which would be compatible with the REV-associated atrophy of the lymphoid organs (Witter et al., 1981) . The lymphoid atrophy is strain specific and is caused by a combination of env and gag genes (Filardo et al., 1994) .\n\nThe effects of REV infection on cell-mediated immunity have been studied by several groups mostly using mitogen stimulation assays (e.g. Witter et al., 1979; Walker et al., 1983; Buscaglia et al., 1989) . The immunosuppressive effects were linked to the development of suppressor cells by Rup et al. (1982 Rup et al. ( , 1979 . Unfortunately, there are no recent reports characterizing these cells or their mode of action. The importance of this type of cell-mediated suppression needs to be further analyzed especially in view of the development of REV-specific CD8 \u00a7 CTL starting at 6 days pi with n.d. REV (Lillehoj et al., 1988; Weinstock et al., 1989) .\n\nIn the previous section, three broad categories causing immunosuppression were identified: corticosteroids in relation to stress, apoptosis and/or necrosis of lymphoid cells and virus-induced changes in the regulation of immune responses. In many instances, the actual molecular interactions between virus proteins and host cells are poorly identified. In order to use cytokines as adjuvants to improve vaccines as suggested by Asif et al. (2004) , future research needs to be focused on a better understanding of the interactions between viruses and cytokine regulation. Dohms and Metz (1991) indicated that the mechanisms of stress-induced immunosuppression were poorly understood especially in birds. The common pathway for stressors involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and results in the release of glucocorticoids, which are immunosuppressive for many species including chickens. Treatment of chickens with corticosterone or related glucocorticoids results in lymphopenia and atrophy of the lymphoid organs. Pruett (2001) suggested that the interactions between glucocorticoids and the immune system are more complex and, depending on the duration of the stress, can enhance or suppress or have no effect on immunological variables in mammalian species. Measuring several immunological parameters, E1-Lethey et al. (2003) compared the effects of treating chickens with corticosteroids with the effects of lack of foraging materials. Interestingly, antibody titres against SRBC and tetanus toxoid were decreased after both treatments, but antibodies to human serum albumin were not influenced by either treatment. In addition, CMI responses such as cutaneous response to PHA and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to mycobacterium antigen were decreased with both treatments. It is also noteworthy that the lack of foraging materials did not enhance plasma corticosterone levels significantly. In conclusion, stress may result in immunosuppression but the actual mechanisms remain elusive.\n\nVirus replication in lymphoid cells is the major cause of cell death for IBDV, CIAV, reovirus, MDV and to some degree REV. In most of these infections, apoptosis is the cause of cell death although necrotic lesions have been reported for MDV (Witter and Schat, 2003) . The induction of apoptosis by VP5 and VP2 of IBDV was mentioned before, but it is not clear how these proteins actually interact with the apoptotic pathway. Liu and Vakharia (2006) showed that IBDV infection in vitro activates effector caspase 3 and the initiation caspase 9 as well as NF~B resulting in apoptosis late in the infective cycle. These authors suggested that NF~B may be activated through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species as has been shown for reovirus-induced apoptosis.\n\nCIAV provides another example for viral induction of apoptosis (Noteborn, 2004) . VP3 (or apoptin) is the major viral protein inducing apoptosis although VP2 may also be a minor cause of apoptosis. Early after transfection of MSB-1 cells with a VP3-expressing plasmid, VP3 is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as fine granular structures. At the time that cells become apoptotic VP3 forms discrete nuclear structures. The carboxy terminus is positively charged and, based on work with deletion mutants, it is suggested that the positive charge is important for the interaction with the nuclear DNA. Noteborn (2004) suggested that this may lead to alterations in the supercoiled organization of the cellular DNA causing apoptosis or alternatively that VP3 acts a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in the apoptotic process.\n\nAlthough MDV induces apoptosis, little is known about the viral proteins and mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis. Thus far, no proteins preventing or inducing apoptosis have been found in MDV, although Kingham et al. (2001) identified in the related HVT an ORF coding for a protein with significant similarity to the putative quail anti-apoptotic gene NR-13. Ross (1999) speculated that the phosphorylated polypeptide pp38 was responsible for apoptosis in MDV. However, Li et al. (2006) showed that induction of pp38 expression under control of an inducible promoter did not induce apoptosis in the quail cell line QT35.\n\nThus far, there are few studies describing quantitative changes in cytokine production as a consequence of virus infections in chickens. It is not clear how many of the changes are actually related to immunosuppression rather than changes associated with the induction of immune responses. It is clear from the work by Jarosinski et al. (2005) using vv+ MDV strains that strong proinflammatory responses may cause pathology. This observation has important consequences for genetic selection for MD resistance, because the resistant N2a line had a very strong proinflammatory response causing neurological disease with significantly higher levels of cytokine and NO production in the brain than in susceptible P2a chickens. Additional studies on cytokine deregulation leading to immunosuppression are urgently needed using real-time RT-PCR assays and preferably ELISA to examine the impact on transcription and actual production of cytokines.\n\nOne of the common immunosuppressive effects described for MDV, reovirus, IBDV, and REV infections is the generation of \"suppressor\" macrophages. These cells suppress T lymphocyte blastogenesis using mitogen responses and are frequently detected between approximately 3 and 15 days pi. Removal of these cells restores the responsiveness of the T cells (e.g. Lee et al., 1978; Rup et al., 1979; Pertile et al., 1995) . Interestingly, this immunosuppression has been linked to NO production by macrophages. NO is a highly versatile molecule with immunosuppressive as well as anti-tumour, anti-bacterial, and antiviral activity. NO can influence gene expression probably through the NF~B pathway and, at high levels, can be part of proinflammatory pathology (reviewed by Bruckdorfer, 2005) .\n\nAs we have learnt more about the molecular interactions between viruses and their hosts, it has become apparent that most, if not all, viruses have to employ immunoevasion mechanisms to survive even the innate immune responses of the host. Those viruses with a persistent lifestyle also have to deploy a spectrum of subtle, refined mechanisms to survive in the face of potential acquired immune responses. The factors involved in immunoevasion were most easily identified in the large DNA viruses (poxviruses and herpesviruses). With the exception of the molluscipoxviruses, which have no direct relatives in birds but which have some similarities with the avian poxviruses, poxviruses cause acute infections and so their immunoevasion mechanisms only need to counter (or are only capable of countering) the innate immune responses, and possibly delay the acquired responses. The herpesviruses are able to become latent, a state that requires the expression of very few genes. They do, however, appear to be able to prevent the induction of acquired responses, even though the immune system is regularly open to stimulation by episodic, localized reactivation of latent virus. The recognition that large complicated viruses needed to evolve specific mechanisms to counter innate immune responses arguably drove the suspicion that the smaller, \"simple\" viruses (often with an RNA genome) must have evolved equivalent mechanisms to survive the same pressures. There are now several examples, particularly in the paramyxoviruses, of small accessory proteins of RNA viruses, or of multifaceted proteins, playing a role in immunoevasion, particularly in suppressing the type-I IFN pathway. The relative dearth of reagents available for many aspects of avian biology means that detailed study of the mode of action of many of the immunoevasion mechanisms of avian viruses remains woefully behind that of mammalian viruses. Indeed many of the mechanisms remain presumptive, but the situation should improve with the recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence. Recognition of the importance of avian viruses as emerging zoonotic agents, for instance West Nile virus and H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV), is also likely to drive much more work in this area. We will consider immunoevasion mechanisms, both known and postulated, of avian herpesviruses, poxviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and reoviruses, as well as reviewing prospects for future work on avian adenoviruses and coronaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses.\n\nStudy of the biology of MDV teaches us that it uses at least two strategies of immunoevasion, though no specific mechanisms have as yet been attributed to these observations. Morimura et al. (1997) showed that MDV infection downregulates transcription of CD8. Hunt et al. (2001) reported that MHC class I expression was downregulated in two cell lines, MDVinfected OU2 cells and in MDV-transformed MSB-1 cells treated with 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine, most likely through a block in the transport of the MHC molecules to the cell surface. Morgan et al. (2001a) , using microarray analysis, found that MDV upregulated MHC class I, but this is likely to be IFN driven. A mechanism that may favour survival of MDV in its latent state is promotion of the survival of MDV-transformed tumour cells. Whether this is achieved directly by enhanced expression of chicken CD30, previously identified as the AV37 antigen (Burgess et al., 2004) , or by the downregulation of CD28 seen in cells over-expressing CD30 (Burgess and Davison, 2002) is not clear, nor is the actual viral mechanism of achieving these perturbations in cell surface marker expression.\n\nThe herpesviruses have proved a rich hunting ground for those seeking the mediators of immunoevasion, hereafter referred to as immunomodulators, and the avian herpesviruses, such as MDV, prove no exception. The most interesting immunomodulator found in MDV is the IL-8 mimic (vIL-8), identified initially by its sequence homology with host IL-8. More informatively referred by its synonym, eotaxin, IL-8 is a chemokine capable of attracting eosinophils. Deletion of vIL-8 (Cortes and Cardona, 2004; Cui et al., 2005) or exon 1 of vIL-8 (Jarosinski and Schat, 2007) from the RB-1B strain of MDV resulted in a lower frequency of birds with tumours and smaller, less invasive tumours. This suggests that vIL-8 affects virus replication rather than tumorigenesis. The possibility of immunomodulatory functions for vIL-8 cannot be eliminated but the discovery that it can also be expressed as a fusion protein with the MDV oncoprotein Meq presents the likelihood of a more complicated situation (Anobile et al., 2006) .\n\nThe avian poxviruses comprise one genus (the Avipoxvirus genus) of the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily. The other seven genera comprise only mammalian poxviruses. Recent phylogenetic studies, based on only a couple of conserved genes, reveal that the avipoxviruses show considerable diversity, equivalent to that observed between the Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, Yatapoxvirus, and Leporipoxvirus genera of the mammalian poxviruses. They appear to form three major clusters (or clades) of related viruses, one broadly related to FPV, one to canarypox virus (CNPV) and the other comprising the psittacine poxviruses (Jarmin et al., 2006) . Various phylogenetic studies have indicated that the mammalian poxvirus most closely related to the avipoxviruses is the human molluscum contagiosum virus, with which avipoxviruses share many common features of molecular biology, including key aspects of gene complement and organization, as well as aspects of pathogenesis.\n\nThe avipoxviruses have some of the largest DNA viral genomes, up to more than 300 kbp and encoding up to 300 genes. The complete genome sequences of pathogenic and attenuated vaccine strains of FPV Laidlaw and Skinner, 2004) and of a pathogenic strain of CNPV have been determined (Tulman et al., 2004) . Avipoxviruses cause diseases ranging in severity and mortality from relatively mild cutaneous infections, e.g. fowlpox in chickens, through the more severe diphtheritic infections (also seen in some cases of fowlpox) to disseminated systemic or pneumonia-like infections with high mortality, such as in CNPV infections. The nature of the infection is probably related to host-virus adaptation, in which immunoevasion mechanisms and especially immunomodulators play an important role. The less severe infections probably reflect long-standing adaptations of virus and host, whereas the more severe infections probably reflect more recent introductions of viruses to novel hosts.\n\nThe derivation of the first sequences brought with it the surprise that FPV encoded no obvious candidates for modulators of the type I IFN or IFN-~ pathways, nor of the antiviral effectors which these pathways induce (Tulman et al., , 2004 Laidlaw and Skinner, 2004) . This was in contrast to the mammalian poxviruses, which encode: dsRNA binding proteins (e.g. E3 of vaccinia virus); mimics of eIF2% the substrate for activated dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR (e.g. vaccinia virus K3) and secreted, soluble binding proteins for IFN-I and IFN-~. However, FPV and CNPV appear to encode mimics of TGF-~; and CNPV encodes an IL-10like protein. Assuming they act as agonists, both of these candidate immunomodulators are predicted to downgrade the host's inflammatory responses by stimulation of T regulator cells, thereby protecting the virus-infected cell.\n\nTwo groups independently predicted that two different FPV genes (fpv073 and fpv214) would encode candidate IL-18 binding proteins Laidlaw and Skinner, 2004) . Only one of the predicted genes (fpv214) encoded a protein with a conserved IL-18 binding motif and, interestingly, a knockout of this gene in a recombinant FPV expressing IBDV VP2 resulted in an enhanced CMI response against IBDV, when chickens vaccinated with the recombinant were challenged with IBDV. The enhancement was comparable to, but less dramatic than, the enhancement observed when the VP2 recombinant FPV co-expressed chicken ILl8, whether fpv214 was intact or not (Eldaghayes et al., 2008) .\n\nThe avipoxviruses also encode multiple chemokine-like molecules (e.g. fpv060, fpv061, fpv116, and fpv121). These appear to be secreted, although as yet no biochemical activity has yet been attributed to any of them, partly due to the lack of identified chicken chemokine and chemokine receptor reagents (Jeshtadi et al., 2005) . It is therefore unclear whether they will behave as agonists or antagonists and whether they will target bona fide chemokine receptors or similar receptors for other host ligands. Avipoxviruses also encode serpentine molecules with seven transmembrane segments resembling G-protein-coupled receptors. These proteins, such as fpv021, fpv027, and fpv206 are candidate chemokine receptors . Whether they actually bind host chemokines or other host ligands, and whether they are signaling-competent, or merely decoy receptors remains to be tested when chicken chemokine reagents become available.\n\nAlthough no gene encoding IFN-'~-binding protein was predicted from the sequence, a binding protein was identified biochemically by its interaction with recombinant tagged IFN-~. It proved to be the product of fpv016 (Puehler et al., 2003) . Type I IFN-binding proteins are not predicted and it remains to be seen if alternative approaches will identify genes encoding such proteins. The lack of obvious mechanisms for evasion of the type I IFN responses is intriguing, particularly as we have evidence that FPV is resistant to recombinant chicken type I IFN at a concentration over 1000-fold higher than is required to inhibit vaccinia virus strain MVA (Pollitt, 1997; M. Skinner, unpublished data) .\n\nThe avipoxvirus genomes encode many as yet unassigned proteins, which might function in immunoevasion. For instance, one feature that distinguishes avipoxviruses from mammalian poxviruses is that the former encode several families of related proteins. Most notable is the family of proteins containing multiple ankyrin repeats. These repeats are found in many types of host proteins and their presence normally denotes a protein-protein interaction. Up to 30 proteins of this family are encoded by the avipoxviruses -we have no idea of their targets but presume they are likely to be host proteins and that some at least will probably play a role in immunoevasion.\n\nViruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family are enveloped viruses enclosing eight segments of negative strand RNA. The best known are members of the Influenzavirus A genus, mostly as a consequence of their role in human pandemics. As is now widely appreciated since the emergence of the H5N1 strain, influenza A viruses are primarily an infection of birds, originating in waterfowl, and readily passing to a wide range of wild and domestic birds.\n\nIt was using influenza virus infection that IFN was discovered in 1957 (Lindenmann et al., 1957) . Subsequently, it was one of the first viruses for which a resistance mechanism to IFN (activation of host protein p58) was elucidated (Lee et al., 1990) . Since 1997 and the emergence of the highly pathogenic HSN1 AIV capable of causing high mortality in humans, NS1 has been identified as the major viral IFN-resistance protein (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998; Hatada et al., 1999; Bergmann et al., 2000; Talon et al., 2000) . Moreover, a determinant of virulence of H5N1 (D92E) has been located on NS1 (Seo et al., 2004) . These studies have been performed in the context of mammalian IFN responses, this being appropriate because of the clinical threat and also practical because the avian IFN response is not fully understood and there is a lack of avian reagents.\n\nPerhaps because of the lack of biochemical assays and reagents, one of the few direct studies of the interaction between AIV and avian IFN was performed with live virus (Marcus et al., 2005) . The study concluded that there was considerable heterogeneity within and between virus populations in their ability to induce and resist avian IFN I. The heterogeneity was ascribed to the presence in the population of subpopulations that had packaged multiple genome segments. It was presumed that those particles which had packaged multiple segments encoding IFN resistance protein(s) displayed higher resistance, although this characteristic was not necessarily inherited. Such heterogeneity illustrates one of the potential complications of using live-recombinant influenza viruses to dissect out the role of particular molecular determinants of IFN resistance.\n\nStudies with the mammalian system have revealed that NS1 is a very complex, multifunctional protein. It has at least three different major roles: (i) binding dsRNA to block the IFN response, (ii) inhibiting host gene expression by preventing mRNA splicing and nuclear export and (iii) enhancing viral mRNA translation. All of these roles merit further investigation in mammalian and avian hosts.\n\nResistance of influenza virus (influenza A virus unless otherwise specified) to IFN was initially believed to be primarily due to activation of a cellular inhibitor, p58(IPK), of PKR (Lee et al., 1990) . The mechanism of activation is still not known. Another mode of action involved the ubiquitin-like host protein, ISG15, which is one of the most predominant proteins induced by type I IFN (Bazzigher et al., 1992) . Influenza B virus induces ISG15 strongly but a specific region of the influenza B virus NS1 protein (NSIB), which includes part of its effector domain, blocks the ability of ISG15 to become covalently linked to its target proteins by inhibiting its UBEIL-mediated activation. The influenza A virus NS1 protein does not bind ISG15, but inhibits its synthesis (Yuan and Krug, 2001) . Subsequently, however, NS1 was shown to play a major role in resistance to IFN. Specifically, NS1 mutants were able to replicate only in IFN-defective cell lines (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998) . NS1, normally 230 amino acids long in influenza A virus, is encoded by virus RNA segment 8. The amino terminus (73 residues) of NS1, which dimerizes (Wang and Krug, 1996) , is capable of binding dsRNA (Hatada and Fukuda, 1992) , albeit at relatively low affinity (Yuan and Krug, 2001) , thereby preventing activation of the dsRNAdependent protein kinase, PKR (Lu et al., 1995) . NS1 also binds polyadenylated RNA, inhibiting nuclear export of mRNAs (Qiu and Krug, 1994) , and a stem bulge in U6 snRNA, inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and in vivo (Qiu et al., 1995) . Both of these activities can downregulate expression of cellular genes. It can also prevent IFN production both by binding to IRF-3, blocking its kinase-mediated activation (Talon et al., 2000) , and by blocking NF~B activation (Wang et al., 2000) . Although expression of NS1 alone was reported to induce apoptosis in MDCK and HeLa cells (Schultz-Cherry et al., 2001) , in the context of a viral infection of mammalian or avian cells, its IFN-regulatory activity makes it anti-apoptotic (Zhirnov et al., 2002) . NS1 selectively enhances translation of viral but not cellular mRNAs by binding eIF4GI, PABP1, and the 5' UTRs of vmRNAs (Aragon et al., 2000; Burgui et al., 2003) . It is interesting that the region of NS1 (aa 81-131) binding eIF4GI spans the location of the known virulence mutation (aa 92) and that the region of PABP1 to which NS1 binds is not conserved evolutionarily. The C terminus, or effector domain, downregulates formation and export of cellular mRNAs, by binding to the 30kDa subunit of CPSF and to PABII (Nemeroff et al., 1998; Krug, 1999, 2000) . The dsRNA-binding activity of NS1 can be abrogated by mutating 2 basic residues (R38 and K41 to A). In MDCK cells, virus thus mutated (Donelan et al., 2003) failed to inhibit IFN-~3 and replicated to lower titres. On passage, a better replicating virus emerged with an $42G mutation that did not improve dsRNA binding, but which had intermediate virulence in mice.\n\nThe Paramyxoviridae family of negative sense RNA viruses, which includes measles virus, has two well-known avian members: NDV (member of the Avulavirus genus) and turkey rhinotracheitis virus or avian metapneumovirus (member of the Metapneumovirus genus).\n\nThere has recently been considerable study of the mechanism by which paramyxoviruses modulate IFN I, demonstrating the importance of the V proteins in blocking IFN induction and signalling (Horvath, 2004) . These proteins are expressed following RNA editing of the mRNA that encodes P protein. Due to the lack of reagents for the avian IFN I system, this work has barely extended to avian paramyxoviruses. The likely role of the NDV V protein has, however, been demonstrated using genetically modified viruses (Park et al., 2003a) . Thus mutant viruses, defective for V protein expression (V-NDV), replicate poorly in embryonated eggs and chicken embryo fibroblasts. This defect can be complemented by transfection of a plasmid expressing cDNA encoding the V protein into V-NDV-infected cells (Park et al., 2003b) or by insertion of the influenza virus NS1 gene into the V-NDV. The NS1 gene allows the modified NDV to replicate better in human cells than does the parental NDV, suggesting the NDV V protein is more effective in modulating the chicken IFN system than the mammalian IFN system (unlike influenza NS1 which modulates both systems effectively). These differences are likely to be important for the host range specificities of the two viruses. IFN-sensitive NDV can also be rescued by transfection of a plasmid expressing cDNA encoding NDV V protein (Park et al., 2003b) . Although all examined V proteins of mammalian paramyxoviruses appear to be involved in modulating the mammalian IFN response, the actual detailed mechanism by which they do so varies from virus to virus. Elucidation of the mode of action of the NDV V protein will, therefore, require the availability of a full panoply of reagents specific for the avian IFN I system.\n\nIt is clear that dsRNA is a powerful inducer of the antiviral type I IFN system. Although the positive-strand RNA viruses, and even poxviruses, generate some dsRNA during their replication and transcription, the dsRNA viruses must be able to prevent recognition of their dsRNA genome by the cell. This is probably largely achieved by ensuring that the genome is never exposed outside of the capsid within the cytoplasm. However, the avian reoviruses, in common with mammalian reoviruses, appear to encode a dsRNA-binding protein aA that can mask dsRNA from cellular dsRNA binding proteins such as the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. Thus aA functions like poxvirus E3, and can actually replace E3 in Vaccinia virus (Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2003) .\n\nImmunosuppression as a consequence of (subclinical) virus infections is a common occurrence with important consequences for the poultry industry. Thus far, most studies describe the effects on immune responses without addressing the mechanistic aspects of the immunosuppression, which is the consequence of the lack of reagents and appropriate techniques. However, during the last few years, and especially since the chicken genome has been sequenced, research has started to focus on the interactions between virus infection and the effects on the (de)regulation of the immune responses. It is expected that rapid progress will be made in the next 5-10 years in this area of research.\n\nThere has also been a burgeoning interest in the mechanisms by which viruses evade or modulate the innate resistance mechanisms of the host, in particular the IFN-I system. This interest has so far had little impact on the study of avian viruses because of the lack of essential reagents. The recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence has opened up easier access to such reagents and it is likely that the coming years will see a rapid increase in the number of studies, and hence our knowledge of the intricacies of avian virus-host systems. Recent developments allowing manipulation of the large and complicated genome of IBV (Casais et al., 2001) , a coronavirus like the SARS virus, may also help identify additional viral immunomodulators, and hopefully elucidate their mode of action (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006) . Such technology has been available for some time for avian adenoviruses but the divergence between mammalian and avian adenoviruses has made it difficult to predict candidate immunomodulators. Hopefully reannotation of the genome, which identified three putative surface glycoproteins with immunoglobulin-like folds, will be useful for further analysis (Washietl and Eisenhaber, 2003) . That this type of study is likely to elucidate new paradigms, which may even be relevant beyond the avian host, is illustrated by the relative dearth in avian herpesviruses and poxviruses of obvious immunomodulators of the type observed in their mammalian cousins. The emergence of West Nile virus and of H5N1 AIV as threats to wild birds, farmed poultry, mammalian livestock and companion animals and to humans, may lead to provision of resources needed to understand the complexity of the interactions of these and other viruses with their avian hosts. Hopefully as a consequence, we will be better equipped to control and treat, or possibly even eradicate, such viruses."}
