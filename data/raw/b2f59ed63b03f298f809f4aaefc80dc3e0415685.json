{"title": "Review Antiviral combinations for severe infl uenza", "body": "Infl uenza virus infection causes substantial morbidity and mortality, despite the availability of antiviral drugs and vaccines. WHO estimates that annual epidemics cause 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250 000-500 000 deaths worldwide. 1 After the 2009 pandemic, outbreaks of that strain have continued to cause serious illness and increased mortality, particularly in young adults and children. 2,3 The increase of zoonotic infections with avian infl uenza viruses is also of concern.\n\nA second wave of avian infl uenza H7N9 occurred in China in late 2013 to early 2014, with high rates of severe illness and death in patients with confi rmed infection, and the virus continues to circulate in poultry. 4 For the fi rst time, 5 severe avian infl uenza A H10N8 infection in human beings has been described, and cases of avian infl uenza A H5N1 continue to be reported, including the fi rst case of imported infection in North America. 6 Various observational studies in seasonal, pandemic or avian infl uenza H5N1 infections show that timely oseltamivir monotherapy can reduce the risk of severe infl uenza outcomes such as pneumonia and admission to hospital and lower mortality in hospital inpatients, including risk groups such as pregnant women and immuno compromised hosts. 7-15 However, monotherapy has not prevented death in many patients with severe pandemic H1N1, 16 H5N1, 15 or H7N9 illness. 17 Although various factors might account for these deaths, oseltamivir treatment is associated with incomplete antiviral responses in severely ill patients, in whom viral detection can persist in the upper and, more often, the lower respiratory tract for days to sometimes weeks during otreatment. [17] [18] [19] [20] Furthermore, emergence of resistance during monotherapy has been a drawback in severe infl uenza, particularly in immuno compromised hosts 21 and in avian H5N1 22 and H7N9 infections. 17, 23 Variants with highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir in vitro have sometimes emerged within several days of initiation of therapy in severe infl uenza caused by by pandemic H1N1 21 or avian viruses. 17, 23 Modelling studies based on human viral kinetics show that all possible single nucleotide mutations and a sizeable proportion of double ones are generated during an uncomplicated infl uenza infection. 24 Whereas most of these mutations sustain a fi tness cost, some variants show reduced inhibition and be selected during drug therapy. Therapeutic use of infl uenza antiviral combinations could increase antiviral potency and reduce resistance emergence; both of these eff ects could increase clinical eff ectiveness, especially in seriously ill or immunocompromised hosts. Additionally, combinations might allow dose-sparing in the event of drug shortages and possibly reduce risks of adverse drug eff ects.\n\nThe broad range of responses to infection, as seen by the high rates of clinically inapparent infections reported by seroepidemiological studies, 25 shows that the severity of infl uenza is at least, in part, determined by host factors. Death in many cases is a result of irreversible lung injury related to both host infl ammatory responses and direct cellular eff ects of viral infection (cytopathology and apoptosis). Hence, modulation of the host proinfl ammatory response might be a tractable complementary therapeutic strategy and off ers an advantage compared with antivirals in avoiding emergence of drug-resistant variants. Furthermore, some host-cell pathways are essential for viral replication, so that some host-directed inhibitors have the potential to diminish both viral replication and harmful infl ammatory responses. 26 The well established therapeutic approach of antiviral combinations has received only limited clinical testing in infl uenza infections so far, and very little information is available from studies in hospitalised or severely ill patients with infl uenza. Consequently, no combinations of proven value for treatment of severe human infl uenza are now available. In this Review, we summarise published information regarding infl uenza antiviral combinations Review and comment on antiviral and immunomodulator combin ations that have received preclinical and, in some instances, clinical investigation. The details of representative studies of antiviral combinations and of antiviral and immunomodulator combinations are listed in the appendix. Several of these regimens would be candidates for controlled studies in hospital inpatients with serious infl uenza infections, including patients infected with avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus, or in patients who are immunocompromised with an increase in the risk of severe disease and resistance emergence.\n\nAs previously reviewed, 27, 28 in-vitro studies showing enhanced antiviral activity against infl uenza A virus with dual drug regimens of amantadine and interferon date to 1968 29 and ofrimantadine and ribavirin date to 1977. 30 Combinations of amantadine and ribavirin were reported to increase survival in murine models of infl uenza A virus infection, 30 although not of infl uenza B. 31 Reduction in adamantane resistance emergence in vitro by combination of rimantadine and ribavirin was reported in 1980, 32 a principle subsequently supported with amantadine and oseltamivir for many infl uenza A subtypes, including avian H5N1. 33 The fi rst triple infl uenza drug regimen (interferon alfa, rimantadine, and ribavirin) showing enhanced in-vitro activity against infl uenza A was described in 1984; 34 the investigators also noted enhanced activity with combinations of ribavirin and interferon alfa for an infl uenza B virus. Once neuraminidase inhibitors became available, preclinical studies showed additive or synergistic in-vitro activity and increased survival in murine models with combinations of an adamantane with a neuraminidase inhibitor. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] The fi rst randomised controlled trial of combination therapy in hospital inpatients, done by the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group in the late 1990s, showed that a regimen of oral rimantadine and nebulised zanamivir seemed to exert a slightly greater antiviral eff ect and prevent emergence of adamantane resistance compared with one of rimantadine and nebulised saline. 41 A subsequent randomised controlled trial in outpatients reported evidence for possible antagonism with a combination of oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, 42 an observation that emphasised the importance of detailed preclinical studies before embarking on clinical trials. Subsequent studies have led to several randomised controlled trials testing the safety and effi cacy of various combinations of infl uenza antivirals (table 1) .\n\nAt present, circulating infl uenza viruses including avian infl uenzas H7N9 and H5N1 are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and ovesrvational clinical data show reduced mortality with timely oseltamivir therapy in H5N1 disease. 15 Most preclinical studies show at least additive and often synergistic interactions between neuraminidase inhibitors and antiviral drugs with diff erent mechanisms of action. Consequently, oseltamivir or, if available, intravenous zanamivir or peramivir would be a logical choice for use as a foundation drug in testing of an antiviral combination.\n\nSeveral issues emerge when the possibility of dual neuraminidase inhibitor therapy is considered. The use of dual neuraminidase inhibitors combinations might off er the possibility of reduced resistance emergence because of diff ering antiviral resistance profi les among these drugs. 47 However, data have not substantiated this potential advantage. Combinations of oseltamivir and zanamivir or peramivir show concentration-dependent additive to antagonistic antiviral eff ects for H1N1 viruses in vitro, 48 whereas another study reported that combinations of oseltamivir and peramivir show mainly additive activities in vitro and in mice. 49 Review the similarities in chemical structure of oseltamivir and peramivir. In either instance, no greater antiviral eff ects than the more potent drug of the two would be expected. Infl uenza A neuraminidases form two groups on phylogenetic analysis: group 1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8) and group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9). Each group has distinctive structural features, including a protein loop, the 150-loop, that has an open active-site conformation in group 1 neuraminidases and a closed active-site conformation in group 2 neuraminidases. 50 Although both oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit both groups to a similar degree, some oseltamivir-resistant viruses show neuraminidase group specifi city that is mediated by specifi c aminoacid changes. 47, 51 N9 aminoacid substitutions selected in vitro by oseltamivir include several also seen in H3N2 viruses in patients given oseltamivir (eg, Arg292Lys and Glu119Val in N2 numbering). 52, 53 Although the catalytic site Arg292Lys substitution causes a marked fi tness loss in H3N2, it also confers highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (>1000-fold reduction) in enzyme inhibition assays and reduced inhibition by zanamivir and to greater extent by peramivir. 52 This substitution (Arg294Lys in N9 numbering) also causes highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir and reduced inhibition by zanamivir in avian infl uenza H7N9 in vitro, 54 and absence of inhibition in mice given neuraminidase inhibitors. 55 Of note, emergence of the Arg292Lys substitution has been reported as early as 2 days after initiation of oseltamivir in patients infected with iH7N9 and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. 17,56 H7N9 variants with Arg292Lys replicate at least as well in Madin-Darby canine kidney-SIAT1 cells and primary human respiratory cells as susceptible virus 54 and show similar virulence in mice and transmissibility in guineapigs. 57 Such fi ndings show that the fi tness eff ects of Arg292Lys in the N9 background are much less than those reported for H3N2 viruses and that this substitution might render all available neuraminidase inhibitors clinically ineff ective.\n\nIn healthy volunteers, the combined administration of intravenous zanamivir and oral oseltamivir 44 or of intra venous peramivir and oral oseltamivir 43 shows no important pharmacokinetic interactions. One randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial identifi ed slower virological and clinical responses in patients given combined therapy with oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir compared with oseltamivir alone in treatment of uncomplicated, mostly H3N2 infl uenza in adults, 42 although the combination might have been more eff ective in reducing secondary transmission. 58 A small randomised controlled trial in outpatients infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus did not show obvious diff erences in antiviral eff ects with the combination compared with oseltamivir alone. 59 However, an observational study in oseltamivir-pretreated, severely ill patients with pandemic H1N1 virus showed that late switch to intravenous zanamivir was associated with sustained viral-load reductions in three of three patients given zanamivir monotherapy but in only three of ten given combined therapy with oseltamivir. 60 Another open-label trial in critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1 virus reported persistent viral detection, with 75% still RNA positive for infl uenza at 7 days after the start of treatment, despite administration of a combination of higher dose oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir. 61 Consequently, these results raise concerns about adverse interactions for combinations of zanamivir and oseltamivir; further preclinical assessment, including enzyme inhibition studies, is warranted before use in clinical practice.\n\nMost circulating or threatening infl uenza viruses at present are adamantane-resistant, including avian A H7N9, pandemic H1N1, avian H10N8, and seasonal H3N2 viruses. However, adamantane resistance is variable in avian H5N1 viruses, and many isolates have been susceptible. 62 In preclinical studies with adamantanesusceptible infl uenza A virus, the combined use of an adamantane with a neuraminidase inhibitor or ribavirin generally shows additive or synergistic interactions in vitro 30, 37, 63, 64 and increased survival in murine models of infl uenza, including avian H5N1 virus. 30, 33, 35, 65 However, if an infl uenza virus is adamantane-resistant, no additional survival benefi t or antiviral eff ect has been shown when adamantane has also been given compared with oseltamivir or ribavirin monotherapy, although one study reported increased survival with dual combinations of amantadine and oseltamivir or ribavirin for an adamantane-resistant 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in mice. 66 Human studies of combinations of oral oseltamivir and amantadine 67 and of oral rimantadine and intravenous peramivir 43 have shown no important pharmacokinetic interactions. One placebo-controlled but underpowered trial of nebulised zanamivir in patients with infl uenza A who had been admitted to hospital, all of whom were given rimantadine, showed trends towards faster cough resolution and lesser risk of adamantane resistance emergence. 41 Consequently, a dual regimen of an adamantane and neuraminidase inhibitor would be a reasonable initial treatment regimen for serious infl uenza when the infecting strain is probably susceptible to both drug classes.\n\nCombinations of ribavirin with neuraminidase inhibitors have shown variable interactions. Peramivir and ribavirin showed synergistic activity for an H1N1 virus in vitro and enhanced survival eff ects when given orally in combination compared with suboptimum doses of either agent. 68 Several oseltamivir and ribavirin dose combinations increased survival, reduced lung consolidation, and Review reduced lung viral titres in infl uenza B compared with suboptimum doses of single agents, whereas one dosing regimen of oseltamivir and ribavirin showed no greater eff ects than ribavirin alone for mice injected with A/New Caledonia/20/99 H1N1. 69 Ribavirin and oseltamivir have shown mainly additive interactions in preclinical assays with H5N1. 40, 65, 70, 71 In mice infected with avian H5N1 virus, oseltamivir and ribavirin also showed exceptions of marginal synergy or slight antagonism at some dose combinations. 6 In uncomplicated seasonal infl uenza, randomised controlled trials show that ribavirin monotherapy is ineff ective at doses of 1 g per day 72 and only marginally benefi ts clinical manifestations at higher doses of 8\u00b74 g given over 2 days. 73 Aerosolised and intravenous ribavirin preparations have been used with possible benefi t in severely ill patients with infl uenza, 74,75 and a combination of oral ribavirin and amantadine was used in the treatment of infl uenza pneumonia in a pregnant patient who survived. 76 However, an assessment by US Food and Drug Administration experts concluded that the data from compassionate use reports of intravenous ribavirin in infl uenza were inconclusive in terms of clinical benefi ts and also pointed out the potential safety issues associated with ribavirin, such as haemolytic anaemia and teratogeniocity. 77\n\nA TCAD regimen (Adamas, Emeryville, CA, USA) of three available agents (amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir) shows synergistic activity in vitro against not only infl uenza A viruses that are susceptible, 78 but also those resistant to the adamantanes or oseltamivir at baseline, including adamantane-resistant 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. 48 TCAD was more inhibitory than any of the dual combinations and was also more eff ective at preventing resistance emergence during in-vitro passage. 79 Murine model studies reported greater survival than with dual combinations for an adamantanesusceptible H5N1 virus and also for an adamantaneresistant pandemic H1N1 virus. 66 However, virological data were not provided to establish whether the improved survival was associated with greater antiviral eff ects or possibly reduced resistance emergence in vivo.\n\nIn a small cohort of highly immunocompromised patients infected with infl uenza, TCAD recipients did not have emergence of resistance-associated substitutions; the regimen was reasonably well tolerated over 10 days and provided the target blood concentrations of the individual drugs. 80 A retrospective observational study of critically ill adults infected with pandemic H1N1 virus suggest non-signifi cant trends towards reduced 14 day (17% vs 35%; p=0\u00b708) and 90 day (46% vs 59%; p=0\u00b723) mortality in TCAD recipients compared with those receiving oseltamivir monotherapy. 81 A randomised controlled trial trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease comparing TCAD with oseltamivir monotherapy for ambulatory high-risk patients is in progress (NCT01227967), and controlled studies in hospital inpatients seem to be warranted.\n\nFavipiravir or T-705 (Toyama Chemical Co, Tokyo, Japan) is a novel infl uenza polymerase inhibitor that is active against infl uenza A, B, and C viruses including adamantane-resistant or oseltamivir-resistant variants. 82 Favipiravir and oseltamivir show concentration-related additive or synergistic eff ects for infl uenza A viruses in vitro and, depending on dose and timing, on survival in mice infected with various infl uenza viruses. 83 Combination of suboptimum doses of favipiravir and oseltamivir aff orded 60-80% protection and improved bodyweights during infection in a lethal H5N1 model (one designed to give an infectious dose that is predictably associated with 100% mortality, and combinations of favipiravir and peramivir also showed synergy in survival and enhanced antiviral eff ects compared with suboptimum doses of each compound alone for the treatment of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in mice. 84 Limited testing has recorded no pharmacokinetic interactions of oral favipiravir and oseltamivir in healthy participants. However, dose adjustments in the setting of renal insuffi ciency are still to be identifi ed, and the recommended dose regimen varies with the target population (Asian and white). In Japan, where favipiravir has been approved for treatment of novel or re-emerging infl uenza virus infections (limited to cases in which other anti-infl uenza virus drugs are ineff ective or not suffi ciently eff ective), 85 a phase 3 study in uncomplicated infl uenza showed similar antiviral eff ects as oseltamivir. 86 A phase 2 treatment study completed in adults reported evidence for symptom alleviation, 87 and a large phase 3 randomised controlled trial in uncomplicated disease was initiated during the 2013-14 season (NCT02008344). In view of the available preclinical data, oral favipiravir would be an especially interesting candidate for study of combination therapy with a neuraminidase inhibitor in serious infl uenza viral infection.\n\nplasma containing virus-specifi c neutralising antibodies has been used with apparent benefi t in neuraminidase inhibitor-treated patients with severe H5N1 infection. 88 In a cohort study in neuraminidase inhibitor-treated, critically ill patients infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, crude mortality was reduced from 55% in non-treated patients to 20% in 20 patients receiving convalescent plasma (p=0\u00b7011), and substantial reductions in nasopharyngeal viral load (quantity of viral RNA copy number in volume of sample) on treatment days 3-7 and in plasma cytokines and chemokines were recorded compared with controls. 45 In a similar critically ill group of patients receiving neuraminidase inhibitor therapy, a small double-blind Review randomised controlled trial of hyperimmune globulin containing high neutralising antibody titres to infl uenza pandemic H1N1 virus was associated with no mortality when treatment was given within 5 days of illness onset compared with 40% in those receiving pre-2009 intravenous immunoglobulin (p=0\u00b704), 89 although overall mortality did not diff er between the groups when those with delayed administration were included (fi ve of 17 treated and four of 17 untreated). These fi ndings suggest that the combination of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy with neutralising antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globin would be an appropriate choice for study in patients with severe H7N9 illness once available.\n\nBroad-spectrum neutralising monoclonal antibodies that target conserved epitopes on the stem of viral haemagglutinin and inhibit fusion have therapeutic activity in animal models of infl uenza for group 1 haemagglutinins (including H1, H2, H5, and H9), 90 group 2 haemagglutinins (including H3 and H7), 91 or both group 1 and 2 haemagglutinins. 92 One pan-infl uenza anti haemag glutinin stem monoclonal antibody (designated 39.29) increased survival in mice infected with A/PR/8/34 H1N1] virus when combined with oseltamivir compared with either single agent. 93 These antibodies are just entering clinical trials at present but might off er broad-spectrum activity, especially if they possess suffi cient avidity and can be delivered in suffi cient quantity.\n\nSeveral antivirals that possess novel mechanisms of action and show anti-infl uenza activity in initial clinical studies would also be options for potential combination regimens with neuraminidase inhibitors or other approved drugs. 28, 94 Nitazoxanide is an approved oral antiparasitic agent with a well defi ned safety profi le and human pharma cology. In vitro, nitazoxanide and its active metabolite tizoxanide inhibit infl uenza virus replication at submicromolar concentrations. 95, 96 Nitazoxanide is reportedly both an interferon inducer and an inhibitor of infl uenza antihaemagglutinin maturation through a novel mechanism of action. 97 Scarce in-vitro testing shows evidence for synergy with combinations of tizoxanide and neuraminidase inhibitors in preclinical testing. 96 A placebo-controlled phase 2 randomised controlled trial in uncomplicated infl uenza showed great antiviral eff ects and clinical benefi t (roughly a 21 h reduction in illness duration) at a dose of 600 mg twice a day compared with placebo. 98 Under the sponsorship of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a large phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled trial has been initiated to compare nitazoxanide mono therapy, oseltamivir monotherapy, and the combination of oseltamivir and nitazoxanide for the treatment of uncomplicated infl uenza (NCT01610245).\n\nInhaled DAS181 (Ansun Biopharma, San Diego, CA, USA) is a conjugated sialidase that destroys the sialic acidbearing receptors on host cells that are used by infl uenza A and B and parainfl uenza viruses, to initiate infection. Topically applied DAS181 is active in murine and ferret models of infl uenza including H5N1, H7N9, and other infl uenza viruses. 55, 99, 100 Because of its novel host-directed mechanism of action, DAS181 is active against viruses resistant to existing agents 99,101 and has a low risk of resistance emergence. Longlasting in-vitro passage of infl uenza viruses in the presence of DAS181 leads to emergence of unstable variants with three to 18-fold reductions in susceptibility that contain substitutions in antihaemagglutinin and neuroaminidase. 102 Inhaled DAS181 showed great antiviral eff ects in a phase 2 randomised controlled trial in uncomplicated infl uenza, although no demonstrable eff ects on illness resolution. 103 The inhalation route might prove diffi cult in severe illness, but several case reports have shown apparent clinical benefi t and no serious adverse events when used for treatment of serious parainfl uenza virus in immunocompromised hosts. 104, 105 Further studies in uncomplicated infl uenza are in progress (NCT01740063).\n\nArbidol is an oral antiviral available used for infl uenza treatment in Russia (where it has been available over-thecounter since 1990) and some other countries. 106 It has broad spectrum inhibitory eff ects for many enveloped RNA viruses, but also specifi cally targets infl uenza antihaemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion. Arbidol-resistant variants selected in vitro have substitutions in the antihaemagglutinin 2 subunit. 107 Arbidol shows dose-related antiviral eff ects and survival in murine model studies, 108 and experiments in cell culture have shown synergistic eff ects when combined with adamantanes, ribavirin, or neuraminidase inhibitors. 106, 109 Few randomised controlled trial data on its clinical and antiviral effi cacy are available, but it seems to be generally well tolerated when used for infl uenza prophylaxis or treatment in Russian studies, and further studies are in progress. Arbidol would be an interesting candidate for combination studies, particularly in countries where it is already being used as monotherapy.\n\nOral VX-787 (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA, USA) has a novel mechanism of action selective for infl uenza A viruses and is active against neuraminidaseinhibitor variants and adamantane-resistant variants and would probably show enhanced activity in combination with neuroaminidase inhibitors. Oral VX-787 is reported to have positive antiviral and clinical eff ects in a phase 2 experimental infection study in human beings at highest dose tested of 1200 mg once, followed by 600 mg daily for 4 days. 110 AVI-7100 (Serepta, Cambridge, MA) is a smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) construct designed to inhibit the translation of both the matrix protein and the M2 ion channel by targeting their shared translation initiation start site. 111, 112 This modifi ed phosphorodiamidate Review morpholino oligomer has enhanced resistance to enzymatic degradation, improves pharmacological properties, and limits the potential for non-specifi c immuno modulatory eff ects. Ferret studies with an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 virus have shown disease moderation and reduced viral titres after topical or intraperitoneal administration, including reduced transmission in ferrets after intranasal administration. 111, 112 Although oseltamivir was not inhibitory in this model, the combination of intranasal or intraperitoneal AVI-7100 with oral oseltamivir tended to reduce nasal viral titres to greater extent than AVI-7100 alone. 111 The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease is conducting a phase 1, randomised placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of intravenous AVI-7100 in healthy participants (NCT01747148).\n\nSeveral potential immunomodulatory agents have been proposed for adjunctive infl uenza treatment, mainly those directed against excessive proinfl ammatory host responses to infection. 27, 28, 113, 114 Many of these have shown activity in animal models and new candidates, such as the agonist of human complement component 5a (C5a) termed EP67, 115 the retinoic acidinducible gene 1 (RIG-I) agonist 5\u02b9triphosphate RNA, 116 and the Toll-like receptor 4 antagonist Eritoran (EisaiCo, Tokyo, Japan) 117 continue to be reported. For example, studies suggest that the endogenous lipid mediator protectin D1 is downregulated during severe infl uenza and that exogenous administration exerts antiviral eff ects and improves outcome from severe infl uenza in a mouse model. 118 Agents with dual mechanisms of action have also been described: the cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor naproxen was shown to inhibit infl uenza nucleoprotein and exert antiviral eff ects in a murine model. 119 Depending on the particular model, drugs with either proinfl ammatory or anti-infl ammatory eff ects have shown benefi ts in animal models. However, few immunomodulators have been studied in combination with infl uenza antivirals in preclinical studies, and none have been studied in adequately powered randomised controlled trials in serious human infl uenza (appendix). Furthermore, the unclear relation of disease pathogenesis in animal models, especially murine ones, with human infl uenza, and the heterogeneity of factors contributing to severe human infl uenza, 120 means that the predictive value of immunomodulator activity in animal models of infl uenza studies is unclear. One obvious concern is that downregulation of important innate immune responses could contribute to inadequate control of viral replication and be associated with worsened clinical outcomes.\n\nHowever, some immunomodulatory agents such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors 121 or inhibitors of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway 122 seem to target host cell pathways essential for viral replication. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus shows antiviral eff ects and disease mitigation in a lethal murine model of infl uenza. 121 A small, open-label randomised controlled trial in critically ill adults infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus pjp who were all given oral oseltamivir and systemic corticosteroids showed both more rapid improvements in respiratory function (as shown in parameters of gas exchange and need for mechanical ventilation) and reduced viral detection on day 7 in recipients of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus compared with no treatment, although there was no overall diff erence in mortality. 46 The potential value of mTOR inhibitors in severe infl uenza warrants further study. Immunomodulatory agents that have increased survival in combination with infl uenza antivirals in murine models include N-acetylcysteine, 123,124 a topical sphingosine analogue designated AAL-R that inhibits various proinfl ammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, 125 the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib with mesalazine, 126 thymosin, 127 topical surfactant, 128 and probenecid. 129 In addition to the enhanced antiviral activity reported with combined probenecid and oseltamivir treatment in a mouse model of infl uenza, 129 this combination is particularly interesting since probenecid inhibits oseltamivir carboxylate excretion and potentially enables either boosting of blood concentrations or dosing-sparing. 130\n\nThe use of widely available, low cost drugs with immunomodulatory activity has been promoted as a possible treatment strategy, 114 but so far no prospective randomised controlled trials of such agents have been completed in patients with severe infl uenza illness. In mice infected with avian H5N1 virus, simvastatin given with oseltamivir did not improve the effi cacy of oseltamivir monotherapy, 131 whereas a preliminary study reported some disease-modifying eff ects with a triple regimen of osetltamivir, simvastatin, and fenofi brate compared with oseltamivir alone. 132 Observational studies from the 2009 pandemic did not fi nd improved outcomes in severely ill patients given neuraminidase inhibitors and various immunomodulatory therapies including macrolides and statins. 133 One retrospective analysis in uncomplicated infl uenza did not fi nd that the addition of clarithromycin to oseltamivir improved clinical outcomes. 134 In a prospective observational study of critically ill patients with infl uenza without evidence of bacterial co-infection, treatment with macrolides was not associated with improved survival. 135 However, several retrospective studies have reported substantial mortality benefi ts in patients taking statins who were subsequently admitted to hospital for seasonal infl uenza 136 or pneumonia. 137, 138 Other studies have not shown such results, and the possible benefi t of starting statins at the time of infl uenza onset or treatment in Review hospital has not been reported. One randomised controlled trial in an intensive care unit suggested reduced risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality with addition of pravastatin therapy in patients needing mechanical ventilation; 139 further studies are warranted.\n\nInterferon alfa shows enhanced anti-infl uenza activity in vitro with other antivirals, 29, 34 in addition to its immunomodulatory properties. Some evidence shows that severely ill patients with infl uenza have defi cient endogenous interferon responses. 140, 141 Systemic interferon is active in a murine model of H5N1 virus infection 142 and in a macaque model of H1N1 virus infection. 143 Systemic interferon-alfacon-1 in combination with systemic glucocorticoids showed possible benefi t and adequate tolerance in treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, (SARS) infection 144 but systemic interferon has not been studied in serious infl uenza until now.\n\nSystemic glucocorticoids have been frequently used for treatment of infl uenza-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including up to 60% of hospital inpatients with avian infl uenza A H7N9 illness. 23 Almost all of these patients have been given concurrent antiviral therapy. However, extension of viral replication has been identifi ed in patients with seasonal infl uenza given systemic glucocorticoids for management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, 145 and large observational studies from the 2009 pandemic reported that systemic glucocorticoid administration for pneumonia or ARDS was associated with increases in secondary bacterial and fungal infections, prolongation of intensive care unit stay, and sometimes higher mortality in intensive care unit patients. [146] [147] [148] [149] Reports of patients infected with H7N9 virus suggest that glucocorticoid use might also be a risk factor for antiviral resistance emergence. 17, 56 Consequently, their use for infl uenzaassociated pneumonia or ARDS should best be limited to controlled clinical studies.\n\nThe use of CTMs in the treatment of seasonal infl uenza has a history of several thousands of years. 150 The mechanisms of CTMs in the treatment of infl uenza are complex and incompletely understood. Maxingshigan, one formulation of CTM, directly inactivates infl uenza A virus, idisrupting adsorption, and protecting cells from becoming infected. The administration of Chinese herbs might also have benefi cial immunomodulatory eff ects, but few clinical trials have been reported about the eff ects of combination therapy in infl uenza. One multicentre, prospective nonblinded randomised controlled trial compared the effi cacy and safety of oseltamivir, maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, and the combination of both in treatment of outpatients with 2009 pandemic infl uenza A. 151 \n\nThe primary searches for relevant studies for inclusion were done through PubMed between Jan 1, 1994 and May 1, 2014, in English with the following disease terms: \"infl uenza\" or \"infl uenza, human\". The results of these searches were crossed with the drug terms \"interferons\" or \"oseltamivir\" or \"zanamivir\" or \"neuraminidase inhibitor\" or \"amantadine\" or \"peramivir\" or \"rimantadine\" or \"ribavirin\" or \"vaccines, combined\" or \"drug therapy, combination\" or \"combined drug therapy\" or \"combined antiviral therapy\" or \"antiviral therapy\", and the identifi ed abstracts were screened by one or more researchers. Earlier studies were also identifi ed from the fi les of the senior author. We focused on studies of approved drugs and those in active clinical development that might be considered for near-term clinical study or use in combinations. Articles that studied investigational drugs that had not progressed in development (eg, in-vitro studies of plant extracts) or were inaccessible because of language barriers were not included. In addition, we searched three Chinese databases: Sinomed (former Chinese Biomedical Literature Database); China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database; and the WANFANG Database.\n\nObservational clinical studies with no control groups or those without laboratoryconfi rmed infl uenza virus detection were not included.\n\ninvolving CTMs (appendix) have had limitations with respect to clarity on study methods (ie, randomisation procedures, blinding, and placebo controls) and adequacy of adverse-event reporting.\n\nBecause of the many potential combinations that might be considered for study, various criteria need to be thought about to select the most appropriate interventions to take forward into clinical testing (table 2) . For example, based on the availability in China at present, antiviral combinations of oseltamivir or intravenous peramivir with ribavirin, convalescent plasma, or some other form of neutralising antibody, or perhaps with nitazoxanide would be candidates for testing in serious infl uenza illness including that caused by avian H7N9. 56 Likewise, the strategies for clinical testing will need careful consideration. Since doing randomised controlled trials in seriously ill hospital inpatients is particularly diffi cult and resource intensive, 120 initial proof-of-concept studies might be done in alternative populations such experimentally infected volunteers 152 or outpatients with infl uenza. For antiviral combinations, the initial goal is to show tolerability and greater antiviral eff ects than with monotherapy. Consequently, smaller clinical studies that examine virological endpoints (quantitative virology and resistance emergence) might suffi ce to fi nd out which combinations to take forward into large studies in risk groups or hospital inpatients. For combinations involving immunomodulatory interventions, the challenges are great because the goal is disease amelioration through modulation of host responses. Unfortunately, our understanding of the heterogeneity and dynamics of immune responses in serious human infl uenza and their relation to disease pathogenesis is limited. The possibility of using immunomodulatory interventions will need to consider the particular target population and disease stage, the goa l of either suppressing adverse host responses or supplementing defi cient ones, and the timing of initiating and ceasing the intervention in relation to the course of illness. Adaptive clinical trial designs off er greater fl exibility and effi ciency through planned modifi cations, such as changes to sample size and treatment arms based on statistical analysis of data generated in the early stages of a trial. 153 By incorporating objective endpoints, such designs would enable the study of several diff erent combinations simultaneously.\n\nFGH conceived the Review and wrote the fi rst draft. JD reviewed the scientifi c literature on combination antiviral therapy, developed the associated appendix, and provided key revisions to the text. JKB reviewed the scientifi c literature on combination antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy, developed the associated appendix, and provided key revisions to the text. BC reviewed the scientifi c literature on combinations involving traditional Chinese medicine and provided associated updates to the appendices and text. All authors contributed to editing the fi nal draft of the Review and all authors approved the fi nal version."}
