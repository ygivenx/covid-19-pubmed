{"title": "Cryo-electron microscopy structure of a coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer", "body": "A human codon-optimized gene encoding the MHV spike gene (UniProt: P11224) was synthesized with a R717S amino acid mutation to abolish the furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction (S2 cleavage site). From this gene, the fragment encoding the MHV ectodomain (residues 15-1231) was PCR-amplified and ligated to a gene fragment encoding a GCN4 trimerization motif (IKRMKQIEDKIEEIESKQKKIENEIARIKKIK)3,31, a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGSLE), an 8-residue long Strep-Tag (WSHPQFEK) and a stop codon. This construct results in fusing the GCN4 trimerization motif in register with the HR2 helix at the C-terminal end of the MHV S encoding sequence. This gene was cloned into the pMT\\BiP\\V5\\His expression vector (Invitrogen) in frame with the Drosophila BiP secretion signal downstream the metallothionein promoter. The D1 domain of murine CEACAM1a (residues 35-142; gb NP_001034274.1) was amplified by PCR and cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid32, in frame with a CD5 signal sequence at the 5\u2019end, and with a sequence encoding a thrombin cleavage site, a glycine linker and the Fc domain of human IgG1 at the 3\u2019-end, creating the pCD5-MHVR-T-Fc vector.\n\n293-F cells were grown in suspension using FreeStyle\u2122 293 Expression Medium (Life technologies) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator on a Celltron shaker platform (Infors HT) rotating at 130 rpm (for 1 L culture flasks). Twenty-four hours before transfection, cell density was adjusted at 1.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml, and culture grown overnight in the same conditions as mentioned above to reach ~ 2.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml the day of transfection. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1250 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh FreeStyle\u2122 293 Expression Medium (Life technologies) without antibiotics at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml.\n\nTo produce recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain, 400 \u03bcg of pCD5-MHVR-T-Fc vector (purified using EndoFree plasmid kit from Qiagen) were added to 200 ml of suspension cells. The cultures were swirled 5 min on shaker in the culture incubator before adding 9 \u03bcg/ml of Linear polyethylenimine (PEI) solution (25 kDa, Polysciences). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were diluted 1:1 with FreeStyle\u2122 293 Expression Medium and the transfected cells were cultivated for 6 days. Clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 10-fold using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10 kDa cutoff) before affinity purification using a Protein A column (GE LifeSciences) followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The Fc tag was removed by trypsin cleavage in a reaction mixture containing 7 mg of recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain and 5 \u03bcg of trypsin in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 20 mM CaCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight and re-loaded in a Protein A column to remove uncleaved protein and the FC tag. The cleaved protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column 10/300 GL (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The purified protein was quantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 10 mg/mL.\n\nTo generate a stable Drosophila S2 cell line expressing recombinant MHV spike ectodomain, we used Effectene (Qiagen) and 2 \u03bcg of the plasmid encoding the MHV S protein ectodomain. A second plasmid, encoding Blasticidin S deaminase was cotransfected as dominant selectable marker. Stable MHV S ectodomain expressing cell lines were selected by addition of 10 \u03bcg/ml Blasticidin S (Invivogen) to the culture medium 48 h after transfection.\n\nFor large-scale production of MHV S ectodomain the cells were cultured in spinner flasks and induced by 5 \u03bcM of CdCl2 at a density of approximately 107 cells per mL. After a week at 28 \u00b0C clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 40-fold using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10 kDa cutoff) and adjusted to pH 8.0, before affinity purification using StrepTactin Superflow column (IBA) followed by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. The purified protein was quantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 4 mg/mL.\n\nFor size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis, samples (0.2 mL at 1mg/mL) were loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences, 0.4 mL/min in gel filtration buffer) and passed through a Wyatt DAWN Heleos II EOS 18-angle laser photometer coupled to a Wyatt Optilab TrEX differential refractive index detector. Data were analyzed using Astra 6 software (Wyatt Technology Corp., CA, USA).\n\nSolution MST binding studies were performed using standard protocols on a Monolith NT.115 (Nanotemper Technologies). Briefly, recombinant CEACAM1a ectodomain protein was labeled using the RED-NHS (Amine Reactive) Protein Labelling Kit (Nanotemper Technologies). The MHV S ectodomain protein was serially diluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and the labeled recombinant CEACAM1a was added to a final concentration of 500 nM before overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. The CEACAM1a concentration was chosen such that the observed fluorescence was approximately 1000 units at 40% LED power. The samples were loaded into standard-treated Monolith TM capillaries and were measured by standard protocols using a Monolith NT.115, NanoTemper (Munich, Germany). The changes of the fluorescent thermophoresis signal were plotted against the concentration of the serially diluted MHV spike protein and KD values were determined using the NanoTemper analysis software.\n\nThree microliters of MHV spike at 1.85 mg/mL were applied to a 1.2/1.3 C-flat grid (Protochips), which had been glow-discharged for 30s at 20mA. Thereafter, grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Gatan CP3 and a blotting time of 3.5 s. Data was acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector. Coma-free alignment was performed using the Leginon software33. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon34 to control both the FEI Titan Krios (used in microprobe mode at a nominal magnification of 22,500 \u00d7) and the Gatan K2 Summit operated in counted mode (pixel size: 1.315 \u00c5) at a dose rate of ~9 counts/physical pixel/s which corresponds to ~12 electrons/physical pixels/s (when accounting for coincidence loss35). Each movie had a total accumulated exposure of 53 e/\u00c52 fractionated in 38 frames of 200 ms (yielding movies of 7.6 s). A dataset of ~1600 micrographs was acquired in a single session using a defocus range comprised between 2.0 and 5.0 \u03bcm.\n\nWhole frame alignment was carried out using the software developed by Li et al35, which is integrated into the Appion pipeline36, to account for stage drift and beam-induced motion. The parameters of the microscope contrast transfer function were estimated for each micrograph using ctffind337. Micrographs were manually masked using Appion to exclude the visible carbon supporting film for further processing. Particles were automatically picked in a reference-free manner using DogPicker38. Extraction of particle images was performed using Relion 1.4 with a box size of 320 pixels2 and applying a windowing operation in Fourier space to yield a final box size of 288 pixels2 (corresponding to a pixel size of 1.46 \u00c5). From the 1.2 million particles initially picked, a subset of 50,000 particles were randomly selected to generate class averages using RELION39. An initial 3D model was generated using OPTIMOD40 within the Appion pipeline. The entire data set was subjected to 2D alignment and clustering using RELION and particles belonging to the best-defined class averages were retained (~500,000 particles). These ~500,000 particles were then subjected to RELION 3D classification with 4 classes (using c1 symmetry) starting with our initial model low-pass filtered to 40\u00c5 resolution. We subsequently used the ~230,000 best particles (selected from the 3D classification) and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) to run Relion 3D auto-refine (c3 symmetry) which led to a reconstruction at 4.4 \u00c5 resolution. We utilized the particle polishing procedure in RELION 1.4 to correct for individual particle movement and radiation damage41,42. A second round of 3D classification with 6 classes (c3 symmetry) was performed using the polished particles resulting in the selection of 82,000 particles. A new 3D auto-refine run (c3 symmetry) using the selected 82,000 particles and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) yielded a map at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution following post processing in RELION. The final map was sharpened with an empirically determined B factor of \u2212220 \u00c52 using Relion post processing. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC=0.143 criterion43 and Fourier shell correction curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution44. The soft mask used for FSC calculation had a 10 pixel cosine edge fall-off. The overall shape and dimensions of our reconstruction agree with previous data although the HR2 stem connecting to the membrane is not resolved15.\n\nFitting of atomic models into cryoEM maps was performed using UCSF Chimera45 and Coot18,46. We initially docked the MHV domain A structure (PDB 3R4D) and used a crystal structure of a bovine coronavirus domain A (PDB 4H14) to model the three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and the \u03b1-helix present on the viral membrane proximal side of the galectin-like domain. Next, the MERS-CoV domain B crystal structure (PDB 4KQZ) was also fit into the density, and rebuilt and refined using RosettaCM47. Although we could accurately align the sequences corresponding to the core \u03b2-sheet of the MHV and MERS-CoV B domains, the ~100 residues forming the \u03b2-motif extension (residues 453-535, MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV receptor-binding moiety) could not be aligned with confidence. We used RosettaCM to build models of each of the 945 possible disulfide patterns into the density for domain B. For each disulfide arrangement, 50 models were generated, and there was a very clear energy signal for a single such arrangement (ED Fig.3k). Then, 1000 models with this disulfide arrangement were sampled, and the lowest energy model (using the Rosetta force field augmented with a fit-to-density score term) was selected. Due to the poor quality of the reconstruction at the apex of the S trimer, the confidence of the model is lowest for the segment corresponding to residues 453-535, as homology-modeling was used to fill in details missing in the map.\n\nA backbone model was then manually built for the rest of the S polypeptide using Coot. Sequence register was assigned by visual inspection where side chain density was clearly visible. This initial hand built model was used as an initial model for Rosetta de novo20. The Rosetta-derived model largely agreed with the hand-built model. Rosetta de novo successfully identified fragments allowing to anchor the sequence register for domains C and D as well as for helices \u03b121-\u03b125. Given these anchoring positions, RosettaCM47 augmented with a novel density-guided model-growing protocol was able to rebuild domains C and D in full. The final model was refined by applying strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints using Rosetta19. Model refinement was performed using a training map corresponding to one of the two maps generated by the gold-standard refinement procedure in Relion. The second map (testing map) was used only for calculation of the FSC compared to the atomic model and preventing overfitting48. The quality of the final model was analyzed with Molprobity49. Structure analysis was assisted by the PISA50 and DALI51 servers. The sequence alignment was generated using MultAlin52 and colored with ESPript53. All figures were generated with UCSF Chimera45."}
