{"title": "Synthesis of the Putative Red Clover Necrotic Mosaic Virus RNA Polymerase by Ribosomal Frameshifting in Vitro", "body": "Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a member of the dianthovirus group, is characterized by a genome split between two single-stranded RNAs of 3.9 kb (RNA-1) and 1.45 kb (RNA-2) The RNAs are encapsidated together in 30-32 nm icosahedral virions by t 80 copies of a 37-kDa capsid protein (CP) (Hollings and Stone, 1977) .\n\nThe monocistronic RNA-2 contains a single open reading frame (ORF) capable of encoding a 35-kDa polypeptide which has been observed both in vitro (Lommel et af., 1988) and in vivo (Osman and Buck, 1991) . The RCNMV cell-to-cell movement activity has been genetically mapped to RNA-2 (Osman and Buck, 1987; Paje-Manalo and Lommel, 1989) .\n\nThe polycistronic RNA-1 contains three ORFs capable of encoding polypeptides of 27, 57, and 37 kDa (Xiong and Lommel, 1989) (Fig. 1) . Capsid protein synthesis and replication functions have been genetically mapped to RNA-1 (Osman and Buck, 1987; Paje-Manalo and Lommel, 1989) . Amino acid sequence alignment with a number of related spherical RNA plant viruses within the tombus-, carmo-, and luteovirus groups and identification of conserved RNA-depen-1 Current address: Department of Plant Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson, I'\\Z 85721. 2 To whom reprint requests should be addressed. 213 dent RNA polymerase motifs suggest that the polypeptides encoded by the RNA-1 p27 and p57 ORFs constitute the viral polymerase (Koonin, 1991) . Most of these related plant viruses have polycistronic genomic RNAs and, with the notable exception of barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDVl, the 5' proximally located 88-92 kDa polymerase ORF is interrupted by an inframe amber termination codon (Beier et et., 1984; Carrington et af., 1989; Guilley et el., 1985; Hearne et af., 1990; Miller et af., 1988; Nutter et af., 1989) . Periodic suppression of the amber terrnination codon with an amber suppressor tRNA during translation results in the attenuated expression of the polymerase fusion protein (Beier et af., 1984) . Unlike these other viruses, the polymerases of RCNMV, BYDV (Brault and Miller, 1992) , and potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) appear to be encoded by two adjacent out of frame ORFs (Mayo et al., 1989) .\n\nPreviously, Morris-Krsinich et af. (1983) , reported that the capsid protein and a 36-kDa polypeptide were synthesized in vitro from RNA-1 and a 34-kDa polypeptide from RNA-2. The number and size of RNA-1-programmed proteins do not account for the RNA-1 coding capacity. Consequently, we have reinvestigated the in vitro expression of RCNMV RNA-1. In this report, we present the in vitro translation profile of the RCNMV genome and relate it to the genetic map of the virus.\n\nRetrovirus RNA genomes are also polycistronic and the internally located polymerase (pol) ORF is expressed as a fusion protein with gag or pro (Varmus, 1988) . Retrovirus-like frameshifting requires a heptanucleotide sequence element which is often adjacent to a secondary structure which may involve pseudoknot formation (Atkins et al., 1990) . We have identified a nucleotide sequence element and a potential secondary structure at the termination of the RNA-l 5' proximal p27 ORF which is predicted to facilitate ribosomal frameshifting. Furthermore, we present in vitro translation studies that illustrate that RCNMV produces a putative polymerase of 88 kDa by a -1 ribosomal frameshifting event mechamstically similar to retrovirus and coronavirus polymerase expression.\n\nGenomic RNA isolation RCNMV (Australian isolate) was propagated and maintained in Nicotiene ctevetendii. Virus was purified and virion RNA phenol extracted as previously described (Lommel et et., 1988) . Preparative separation of the two genomic RNA components was achieved by electrophoresis of heat denatured virion RNA in 1% agarose gels containing 1x TBE buffer (89 mM Trisborate, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 1 hr at 60 V. Ethidium bromide-stained RNA bands were visualized by long-wave uv transillumination and excised from the gel. RNA was electroeluted from the agarose into a 5 M NaCI salt bridge at 100 V for 2 hr in sterile 0.5x TBE. RNA was ethanol-precipitated from the salt bridge solution and resuspended in sterile water. Electroelution was repeated to eliminate trace contamination of the RNA with the other component.\n\nThe synthesis of the full-length RNA-1 (pRC1) and RNA-2 (pRC2) eDNA and cloning within the transcription vector, pBS(+) (Stratagene) have been described previously Lommel, 1989, 1991) . The numerical designations for specific nucleotides were assigned according to Lommel et al. (1 988) for RNA-2 and Xiong and Lommel (1989) for RNA-1. A series of 5' terminal deletion subclones were constructed by selective restriction of pRC1 at unique restriction sites except for pRC1Ba which required a partial digestion with BamHI. After diges1ion, overhangs were filled in with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment followed by recircularization of the plasmid by blunt-end ligation (Maniatis et aI., 1982) CP polymerase fusion constructs were prepared by restriction fragment deletion. An internal BamHI fragment was deleted from pRC1 to generate a fusion between the amino-half of p57 and the carboxyl-half of the CPo Mutagenesis of the ribosomal frameshifting element Several point and frameshift mutations in and around the RCNMV ribosomal frameshift site were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis of ssDNA templates using synthetic oligonucleotides as described by Kunkel et al. (1987) . The RCNMV frameshift heptanucleotide element was changed to a BYDV frameshift heptanucleotide element using the oligonucleotide 5'-CCCTIGAGGGTTTTAGGCG-3' in the clone pRC1 BYDV. The frameshift region was also changed to an amber termination codon by addition of a G residue after the p27 ORF termination codon using the oligonucleotide 5'-AmTTAGGGCGGCCCACTC-3' forming pRC1Amb. A single p88 ORF was generated by changing the amber termination codon to a tyrosine residue using the oligonucleotide 5'-ATInTACGGCG-GCCCACTC-3' (pRC1p88). The putative p57 ORF initiation codon was destroyed with 5'-CCAGTAGAGTCGA-CAAAAGTAAG-3' (pRC1Met1) and a second downstream inframe methionine codon was eliminated with 5'-ACATAATATIATAGTIAGT-3'(pRC1 Met2). Two mutations were constructed that were predicted to prevent p88 expression. The frameshift heptanucleotide was destroyed with 5'-AATCCCTIGAGGACTICTAGG-CGG-3' (pRC1NoFS) and a termination codon was incorporated in the -1 frame after the frameshift heptanucleotide sequence with 5'-CTIGAGGATInTAGT-AGGCTAACTCAGCTTICCGGT-3' (pRC1-1 Stop). All site-directed mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.\n\nIn vitro transcription, translation, and immunoprecipitation Positive polarity run-off transcripts of RCNMV RNA-1 cDNA clones were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase following linearization of pBS(+) plasmids with Hind III or Sphl (Xiong and Lommel, 1991) Transcription reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (BRL). RNA was ethanol-precipitated together with the templates and translated in\n\nRabbit reticulocyte lysates (Green Hectares, Oregon Wisconsin) were used to translate viral RNAs and in vitro transcripts as described by Lommel et al. (1988) .\n\nThe [ 35S]methionine-labeled translation products were analyzed by discontinuous SDS 12.5%-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (80S-PAGE) (Laemmli, 1970) . After electrophoresis, gels were fixed and processed by fluorography. lmmunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products was carried out as described by Hiebert and Purcifull (1981) with Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan strain) cell walls and either non-immune or immune serum. \n\nAntibodies to CP were raised in rabbits by injecting SDS-PAGE-purified RCNMV CP subunits intramuscularly. Two synthetic oligopeptides, IRENKAVAGFKS-LEDF representing the carboxyl terminus of p27 and PTHYSRIHKDLlKAR representing the carboxyl terminus of p57 and p88, were synthesized (Xiong and Lommel, 1989) . For each peptide an additional aminoterminal non-viral cysteine residue was included to facilitate coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester linkage (Harlow and Lane, 1988) . Oligopeptides coupled to KLH were then injected intramuscularly into rabbits. Antibodies were purified from antisera byaffinity column chromatography with epoxy-activated Sepharose 68 (Pharmacia) coupled with the corresponding synthetic oligopeptide.\n\nElectrophoretically separated RCNMV RNA-1 directed the synthesis of four polypeptides, p88, p57, p37, and p27, in addition to several minor components ranging in size from 20 to 23 kDa, in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system (Fig. 1) .The p27 protein was the major RNA-l translation product while p57 and p37 were produced in significant but lower quantities. The p88 was synthesized at barely detectable levels in comparison to p27 or the RNA-2 encoded p35. Consequently, the detection of p57 and p88 required overexposure of the fluorographs relative to p27 and p35. No amino acid sequence similarity was observed between p27 and p57 by V8 protease cleavage analysis (data not shown). The low level of p88 synthesis in vitro prevented protease cleavage comparisons with p27 and p57. Translation of separated RNA-2 yielded a single major polypeptide, p35 (Fig. 1) . A few minor low molecular weight protein bands, presumably products of degradation, internal initiation, or premature termination were also visible.\n\nTranslational mapping of RNA-t encoded products A series of 3' co-terminal subclones were generated from pRC1 by incremental 5' deletions of approximately 500 nucleotides using convenient restriction sites (Fig. 2) . Uncapped, positive polarity run-off transcripts from each deletion clone were synthesized and equirnolar amounts translated in vitro. Transcripts from the two smallest RNA-1 deletion constructs, pRC1Aci (03 kb) and pRCfBa (1.1 kb), did not direct the synthesis of a detectable protein (Fig. 2, left panel) . The next largest construct, pRC1Xb (1.5 kb), produced a large quantity of p37 CP relative to the other transcripts and viral RNA-1. Transcripts from construct pRC1Hi (2.6 kb) directed the synthesis of a reduced amount of p37 relative to pRC1Xb, but no larger polypeptides. In addition to p37, pRC1Ps (2.8 kb) yielded polypeptide species similar in mobility to p57. The pRC1Ac transcript, lacking approximately the 5' terminal 400 bases of RNA-1, directed the synthesis of proteins comigrating with viral RNA-l encoded p57 and p37. The p27 major tated by CP antiserum . Carboxyl-term inal oligopeptide ant ibodies were generated to both the predicted p27 and p57/p8 8 non-struct ural proteins. The p27 antibody immunoprecipitat ed p27 as well as p88 (Fig. 3) . In addition , the p27 antibody imrnunoprecipitated the series of minor bands ranging in size from 20 to 23 kOa, establishi ng them as subsets of p27. The p88 antibody immunoprecipitate d p57 , p88 . and smaller amoun ts of several minor prote ins, presumably p57 and or p88 degradation produ ct s. This result clearly showed that p88 is co mposed of both p27 and p57 sequ ences. The p35 , as well as all the oth er smaller products encod ed by RNA-2, were only immunoprecipitated by the p35 carboxyl-termin al oligo peptide antibody (Fig. 3 ). CP report er system to obse rve ri bosom al frames hifting\n\nNucleotide sequ ence analysis suggested that p88 may arise by a ribosomal frameshifting event near the Jj p37 CP r--pBB Ab p37 c P Ab translati on product from viral RNA-1 was not synthesized from the pRC1Ac transcript. Howe ver. the transcript from the full-length clone , pRC1. produced a large amount of p27 , as well as small amounts of p57 and p37 in vitro. The synthesis of p88 directed by pRC1 transcripts was not observed at the exposure illustrated (Fig. 2) , but was detected upon longer exposure (data not shown). Thus , the genome organization of RNA-1 is from 5' to 3': p27, p57, and p37 CP, in agreement with the nucleot ide sequ ence of RNA-1 (Xiong and Lommel , 1989) . termination codon of th e p27 ORF, allow ing translation to cont inue into and through th e p57 ORF (Xiong and Lom mel, 1989) . To investigate th is possibil ity, a p57 -CP fusion construct was made . Deletion of an internal BamH! fragment from pRe 1 ge nerates an inframe fusion between the amino-terminal porti on of p57 and the carboxyl-terminal portion of p37 CP, Th e construct (pRC1BCP) was predicted to enco de a CP fusion peptid e of 37.4 kOa, and assumin g ribosomal frameshifting, a 67-kDa fusion polypeptide (Fig. 4) . Run-off RNA tran scripts were prep ared from pRC 1BCP after Smal linearizat ion. Analysis of the in vitro translation product s directed by the pRC 1BCP tran scr ipt showed that it directed the synthesis of a major 27 -kDa product with a small amount of a 37.4-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 4) . The predicted 68-kD a fusion polypeptid e was produced at an extremely low level and was only detectable after co ncentration by immunoprecipitation with CP antiserum (Fig. 4) , In addition to the 68-kDa polypeptide, the 37A -kDa polypept ide w as also irnrnuno precioirated , as wa s expected, since both of these polypeptides w ere co mposed of th e carb oxyl-terminal portion of CP.\n\nA fram eshift heptanucleotide defined by the ability to fac ilitate ribos omal fram eshittinp in accordance with the -1 simultaneous slippa ge mod el (Jacks et al., 1988a) wa s identified in RNA-1 imm ediately 5' to th e p27 ORF amb er termin ation co don (see below ). To determ ine th e role of this pot ential frameshifting element in pBB synthesis, several point and frameshift mutations were introduced into this region of RNA1 (Fig. 5) . Nucleot ide 826 w as c hanged from an A to a G residue generating th e frame shift heptanucleotide sequen ce GGGUUUU predicted in BYDV (pRCl BYDV). Insertion of a G residue after the p27 ORF termination codon (mutant pRC1Amb) sh ifts the downstream -1 frame into the same frame as the p27 ORF generating a p88 ORF pun ctuated by an in-frame ambe r term ination codon. An additional mutation in pRC 1Amb, c hanging nucl eotide number 833 from a G to a C residue altered the p27 ORF amber termination codon to a tyrosine enc odi ng codon. T his mut ant , termed pRC1 p88 , generated a single uninterru pted p88 ORF, eliminating the p27 ORF. Tw o mutants were generated that w ere predicted to prevent pBB expression in vitro. Mutant pRC1-1Stop incorporated a termination cod on imm ediately 3' of the predict ed frameshift heptanucleotide.\n\nMutant pRC 1NoFS destroyed the frameshift heptanucleotid e prevent ing ribosomal fram eshifting in accordance with the simultaneous slippage model.\n\nAll the mutant in vitro transcripts exc ept pRC1p88 directed the synthesis of a large quantity of p27 in addition to smaller quantities of p37 CP (Fig. 5) . The p88 fusion prot ein from pRC 1BYDV and pRC 1Amb w as synth esized in approximately th e sam e quantity as from the wild-type transcript pRC 1. Synthesis of p88 from pRC1Amb indicated that an amber term inator readthrough event occurred. The major translation product from the pRC1p88 transcript was p88, with smaller amounts of p37 CP and p57 and no p27 protein synthesis.\n\nThe internal p57 ORF identified by sequence analysis is apparently expressed directly from RNA-1 in vitro FIG. 5.

Exclud ing p88 , the relative locat ion and size of th e observed RNA-1 directed in vitro produ cts correlates with the thr ee ORFs deduce d from the nucl eotide sequence analysis (Fig. 1) . Only p37 is immunoprecipitated by CP antiserum (Figs . 2   and 3) . indicat ing that the other observed products are not related to CPo No amino acid sequence similarity was observed between p27 and p57 by V8 prot ease cleavage map analysis (data not shown) . Togeth er the serol ogical and mapp ing evidence suggest that the cod ing sequence for p88 overlaps and is composed of th e p27 and p57 ORFs.\n\nThe p37 CP has been mapped to the 3' proximal p37 ORF and appears to be relatively inaccessible for translation from full-length virion RNA as eviden ced by its low level synthesis in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2 ). In contrast, a large amount of CP is synthesized from the 1.5-kb 3' co-terminal in vitro transc ript pRC1Xb, which has only 20 nucleotides 5' to the CP initiatio n codon .\n\nThese observations are consistent with the conc lusion by Osman and Buck (1990) that the CP ORF is expresse d in vivo from a 3' co-terminal 1.5-kb subgenomic RNA.\n\n( Fig. 1) . To estab lish that the p57 ORF resulted in the express ion of p57. the predicted p57 ORF initiation codon at nucleotide 926 was changed to an aspartic acid codon . Th is mutant, pRC1Met1 , directed the synthesis of a protein slightly sma ller than p57 (Fig. 5) . The smaller protein w as presumably produ ced by initiation at the second AUG co don, 80 nucleotides downstream from the first AUG codo n in the p57 ORF. This second methion ine codon was changed to an isol eucine codon in the mutant pRCl Met2 . This muta nt did not direct the expression of p57 or a small er product in vitro.\n\nA small amount of an 88 -kDa polypeptide which reacts to both p27 and p57 carboxyl-terminal peptide antibodies but not the capsid prot ein antib ody is synthesized in vitro (Fig . 3) . Thes e data suggest that p88 is a fus ion prote in resulting from translational framesh ift of the p2 7 ORF into the p57 ORF. It is unli kely that p88 is a cleavage precurs or of p57 and p27 because p27 is produ ced in much greater quantities than p57 . The fact that only a minor amount of p88 is produced in vitro is consistent w ith a readthrough event (Beier et el., 1984) or a ribosomal frameshifting event (Atkins et ei., 1990; Jacks et al., 1988a) . The RCNMV RNA-1 nu-XIONG ET AL. ...... cleotide sequence reveals that the p27 ORF and p57 ORF are in different reading frames (Xiong and Lommel, 1989) , excluding the possibility of a readthrough, and further suggesting the role of a ribosomal trarneshifting event in the synthesis of p88. For -1 ribosomal frameshifting in most eukaryotic genes studied to date, a heptanucleotide sequence is required, as defined by the ability to facilitate ribosomal frameshifting in accordance with the simultaneous slippage model. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV. This element is immediately upstream from the p27 ORF termination codon and is ve/y similarto those of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), RSV, and BYDV ( Fig.   5A ) as well as to those of the coronaviruses (Brierley et al., 1987) . The simultaneous slippage model can be applied to the RCNMV frameshift heptanucleotide (Fig.  5B) . tRNAAsp with attached nearly complete p27 and tRNNh' can base pair to the last two p27 ORF codons GAU and UUU in the ribosome P and A sites, respectively. Simultaneous slippage of the ribosome tRNA complex one nucleotide in the 5' (-1) direction results in their complexing with the p27 ORF -1 frame codons, GGA and UUU. This results in incomplete codon anticodon base pairing in the first and second position of tRNN\" and complete base pairing with tRNA Pho .\n\nNormal peptide transfer and three nucleotide translocation bring the codon UUA in the p57 ORF into the A site where it pairs with tRNN'\".\n\nIn addition to the heptanucleotide sequence, stable stem-loop structures often involving pseudoknot formation are thought to facilitate the ribosomal frameshifting event in eukaryotic systems (Jacks et al., 1988a,b; Hizi et el., 1987; Le et al., 1989; Ten Dam et al., 1990) . These secondary structures are typically found adjacent to the frameshift heptanucleotide. A stable stem-loop structure is predicted immediately downstream of the putative frameshifting heptanucleotide sequence in RCNMV (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981;  Fig. 5B ). The proposed RCNMV stem-loop structure is similar to the established structures in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Jacks et al., 1988b) , RSV (Jacks et al., 1988a) and to the predicted stemloop structure of BYDV (Brault and Miller, 1992) and PLRV (Prufer et al., 1992) .\n\nThe RCNMV p88 is predicted to be the viral polymerase based on its amino acid sequence similarity to the putative carmo-, tombus-, and luteovirus polymerases (Koonin, 199t) . For the carmo-and tombusviruses the greatest sequence similarity occurs in the region of the polymerase expressed as an amber terminator readthrough product. By amino acid sequence alignment, it appears that RCNMV utilizes a ribosomal trameshifting event in place of an amber terminator readthrough to achieve the modulated expression of the polymerase. This situation is parallel to the retroviruses, where some produce gag-pol fusions by an amber terminator readthrough mechanism while most use a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Yoshinaka et ai, 19S5a, b) .\n\nWe have mutated the predicted RCNMV RNA-t frameshift element such that pSS expression would require amber termination codon readthrough. This construct yielded a limited amount of pSS in vitro (Fig. 5) , illustrating that pSS is expressed regardless of whether a frameshift element or an inframe amber terminator is inserted within the RCNMV polymerase gene. This result suggests that the two polymerase expression modulation mechanisms are interchangeable, at least in vitro within the context of the RCNMV genome.\n\nThe suspected BYDV frameshift heptanucleotide sequence differs in one nucleotide from that of RCNMV. According to the simultaneous slippage model, the BYDV frameshift heptanucleotide should form a more stable codon anticodon base pairing when shifted to the -1 position. Given this, we predicted that mutation of the RCNMV frameshift heptanucleotide to a BYDV heptanuc/eotide would increase the efficiency of pSS synthesis in vitro. However, no striking difference in pSS accumulation was observed. Factors determining frameshifting efficiency are likely to be more complex than codon-anticodon base-pairing."}
