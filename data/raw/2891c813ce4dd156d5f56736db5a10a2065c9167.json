Bacteria, virus and fungi are the critical reasons to infectious diseases [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Bacteria served many diseases by the food route [12] . In Germany, Escherichia coli in Fenugreek sprouts exported from Egypt caused 48 deaths from 2011 to 2012 [13] . Virus could cause various diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [14, 15] and influenza [16, 17] . Fungi like Cryptococcus neoformans could lead to chronic liver disease [18] . Luckily, with the development of safe vaccines and antibiotics, the infectious diseases seemed to be totally cured by these therapies [19] . However, there are some adverse drug effects if patients take these drugs at common dose or overdose such as insomnia [20] , osteoporosis [21] , headache [22] and liver failure [23] . Furthermore, these pathogens with a very fast doubling cycle develop a mechanism for becoming resistant to a specific drug at a glance [24] . In hence, scientists are trying to find new approachs to solve aforementioned problem urgently.\n\nThe nanotechnology is an emerging science [25, 26] and the nano-carriers have been used for medical applications for a long time [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Nano-carriers containing drug have emerged as an innovative and promising alternative for drug delivery to the targeted site [35] . They also greatly improve free drug safety and drug efficacy [36] . Drug-laden nanocarriers could be designed and tailored to reach the intended site. Thus, the pathogenic area could be precisely cured by the drug, elevating the therapeutic effectiveness [37] . There is a lot of significant proof that nano-carriers are superior in biocompatibility, targeting, and tissue penetration [38] .\n\n*Address correspondence to this author at the The School of Chinese Medicine for Post-Baccalaureate, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Tel: +886-7-6151100 ext. 7063; Fax: +886-7-6155150; E-mail: huangks@isu.edu.tw Compared to a free drug, the advantages of a nano-scale drug delivery system include increasing bioavailability, reduced drug amount and frequency and reduced systemic side effects [39] . In hence, active targeted drug delivery combined nano-technological carrier platforms is a better way to prolong, localize, target with the pathogenic sites and reduction of drug side-effects [40] .\n\nOne of the important prerequisites of a drug delivery system is to send a therapeutic agent effectively to the pathologic site as soon as it can [41] . Active targeted strategy is the prospective approach for drug delivery [32, 40] . Active strategies have introduced by Paul Ehrlich and known for 'magic bullet' to describe this system [42] . This system can reach the intended site in higher concentrations in the short period of time. Active targeted delivery is believed that it can improve efficacy while reducing unpleased side-effects. Some certain bacteria, fungi and all viruses are intracellular parasites [43] . As they are growing and reproducing inside the special host cells, scientists could create an active targeted drug delivery system that copied cells infected by those parasites [44] . Active targeted strategies used curtained ligands such as antibodies, peptides, nano-bodies, sugar molecules and aptamers on surface of nano-carriers to improve therapeutic efficacy [45, 46] . Most common seen nano-carriers are liposomes [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] , nanoparticles [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] , dendrimers [57] [58] [59] and carbon nanotubes [60] [61] [62] , and the others.. core frequently used as platforms in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics for drug release [63] [64] [65] . This unique dual release capability makes the delivery of two types of substances in the same time [66] . The first FDA-approved liposomal drug, doxorubicin-encapsulated PEGylated liposomes for curing AIDS connected Kaposi's sarcoma, begun production in 1995 [67] . Composed of natural lipids, liposomes are low toxicity, ease of preparation and high biodegradability [68] . In hence, it works well with a wide range of agents to facilitate a targeted delivery by means of abovementioned characteristics from liposomes [69] . Liposomes binding different specific ligands on their surface such as glycerolipids of Archaea (Archaeosomes) or virus glycoprotein/antigens (virosomes) could display immunoadjuvant potential for a vaccine and higher affinity to the targeted sites than the free drug [66] . The details of references connected with binding ligands for treatment of diseases resulted from microbes are summarized in (Table 1 ).\n\nNanoparticles including metal and non-metal nanoparticle were systematized by our previous review [80] . Both of them have many unique physicochemical properties including extremely small size [81, 82] , huge surface to mass ratio [83] , high reactivity and a distinctive interaction with biological systems [84] . Nanoparticles have been demonstrated to elevate drug stability, bioavailability, targeting and uptake [85] . Particles less than 5 nm are rapidly expelled from the circulation by extravasation and larger particles have limited diffusion in the extracellular space [86] . In hence, the development of nanoparticles containing medicines has made it possible to increase the therapeutic index of many compo-nents using suited ligand to arrive the intention site [87] . Nanoparticles binding ligands could enhance antiviral activity and improve cytotoxicity, low water solubility, and rapid clearance from circulation of the free drug [88] . The details of studies to treat microbes by nanoparticles with binding ligands are summarized in (Table 2 ).\n\nDendrimers were synthesized by Buhleier et al. and Tomalia et al. during 1970 Tomalia et al. during -1990 . Dendrimers are synthetic, highly branched, spherical polymers [97, 98] . Compared to traditional linear polymers, dendrimers are much superior as a drug carrier [99] . Also, they have different kinds of dendrimers; polyamidoamine dendrimer is the first one to be created [80] . There are many outstanding properties of dendrimers such as monodispersity, nano-sizes and shapes, biocompatibility, low toxicity, good pharmacokinetics and can easily provide the active targeted drug delivery [96] . Dendrimers binding ligands result in reducing cytotoxicity, hemolytic bioactives and increasing biocompatibility than the free drug [96] . The details of references related to binding ligands to treat diseases caused by microbes are summarized in (Table 3) .\n\nCarbon nanotubes are cylindrical nanostructures consisted of pure carbon atoms covalently bonded in hexagonal arrays [108] . They have two kinds of nanotube such as single-walled carbon nanotubes or multi-walled carbon nanotubes [109] . Carbon nanotubes showed the efficacy as drug delivery vehicles since they can be easily internalized into cells [110] . Moreover, single-walled carbon nanotubes have high chemical stability and easy functionalization than multiwalled carbon nanotubes [80] . single-atomic layer walled carbon nanotubes through surface modification have been continuously used in active targeted drug delivery [111] . Because of its large surface area, they have been bound numerous ligands on their surface to the targeted sites [111] .\n\nAlthough the carbon nanotubes are widely used for treatments of cancer, they are still few publications used in curing diseases caused by microbes. Compared to the free drug, carbon nanotubes binding different ligands provide promising outcomes like reducing adverse effects, controlling drug delivery and improving patient compliance [112] . The details of references associated with binding ligands to inhibit microbes are summarized in (Table 4) .\n\nAlthough the active targeted strategy using nano-carriers has been solved many concerns from the conventional drug strategy, there is still a challenge reported by some researches [117] . Active targeted strategy was a notable and efficient approach to send drug toward the pathogenic organs, however, Kunjachan et al. reported active targeted strategy should not be overestimated because the drug retention time using the active targeted approach would be diminished easily in the animal model [46] . Besides, active targeted delivery needs highly specific target recognition and great deal of target binding affinity. In hence, length of branches carrying a ligand and the number of ligands per siRNA HIV(CXCR4 co-receptor) Blocking HIV viral entry and reducing infection [113] siRNA HIV(CXCR4 co-receptors) Reducing 60% expression levels of CXCR4 [114] FMDV peptides FMDV (Protein VP1) Showing immunogenicity and eliciting antibody response [115] FMDV peptides FMDV(B cell epitope) Enhancing significantly the virus neutralizing antibody titers [116] *HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus; FMDV: Foot-and-mouth disease virus nano-carriers should be considered [112] . Besides, the most of papers about active targeted drug delivery for microbes we collected are in vitro, scientists could further use in vivo model to determine the efficacy of active targeted strategy in the future.\n\nBecause of the site specific targeting of drugs and lots of other advantages, active targeted drug delivery system is gaining popularity in present scenario. By specific targeted ligands, drugs can be directly targeted to their site of action to prevent toxicity and undesired effects to other sites. These can be used for bioavailability enhancement of the drugs, having poor bioavailability, to reduce the dose of drug administered. Consequently, active targeted drug delivery using nano-carriers provide a guarantee to cure infectious diseases precisely and efficiently.\n\nThe authors confirm that this article content has no conflict of interest."}
