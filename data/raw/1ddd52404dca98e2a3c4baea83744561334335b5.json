{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Labor and Delivery Guidance for COVID-19 Expert Review Labor and Delivery Guidance for COVID-19", "body": "Suggested outpatient management of pregnant women without and with symptoms of COVID-19 has already been described. 6 Inpatient management of pregnant women is similar to outpatient recommendations with regards to minimizing and eliminating all unnecessary contact of the patient with the hospital or birth center to optimize social distancing. Most if not all patient necessary patient-provider contacts should be telehealth / remotely unless the patient describes an urgent problem. 6 Phone calls to labor and delivery (L&D) should be triaged according to Labor presents a unique scenario in the COVID-19 pandemic, as all hospital admissions are anticipated and the timing of many admissions to the hospital are planned. In anticipation of hospital admission, women should be instructed to discontinue work or begin working from home a minimum of 2 weeks prior to anticipated delivery, and to practice strict social isolation during this time. This is to limit the risk of exposure. For the majority of women, this should be initiated at 37 weeks. L&D units should prepare simulations for COVID-19 pandemic, including for PPE donning, etc. They should appropriate designate rooms and operating rooms (ORs). For women with planned admissions for induction of labor or cesarean section, consider screening each individual and her birthing partner by phone the day before admission. When women arrive to L&D, a designated staff member at the front of the unit (e.g., patient access coordinator, unit coordinator, etc.) should verbally screen each individual for upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. Any woman reporting fever, cough, or respiratory symptoms should be given a surgical mask, and evaluated by RN or OB provider. See Figure 2 for recommended flow.\n\nAll birthing partners should be screened; if screen positive, they should not be permitted on L&D and should be directed to appropriate testing or medical care as indicated.\n\nImportant considerations in the care of patients who screen positive:\n\n\u2022 All health care providers should be following CDC PPE recommendations until COVID-19 has been ruled out.\n\n\u2022 Current CDC recommendations include a surgical mask, protective eyewear, gown, and gloves. N-95 mask should be utilized if available for any women with confirmed or suspected \u2022 Aerosolization should in general be avoided because it increases the spread of the virus. If absolutely necessary, N-95 masks should be used in setting of aerosolization, including if patient on bi-pap, has a tracheostomy, requires high flow nasal cannula O2, or when administering nebulized medications. Second stage of labor is likely high risk for aerosolization and N-95 mask should be used. The CDC has indicated that N-95 masks are as effective as PAPR equipment and should be used for protection in the event of short term exposure. 8\n\n\u2022 Practice vigilant hand hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Acute complaint requiring evaluation (severe symptoms, labor complaint, etc.):\n\no A special room should be reserved as space allows for patients who screen positive (e.g., URI symptoms, fever), both for triage and labor.\n\no Ideally this should be picked up when screening the patient by phone the day prior to admission to avoid travel to the hospital (as suggested above).\n\no Evaluation to determine if rescheduling in 2-3 days is feasible to allow for results of COVID-19 testing.\n\no For COVID-19 positive patients with mild or moderate symptoms not requiring immediate care, it is important to recognize that the severity of disease peaks in the second week, so planning delivery prior to that time is optimal. \n\nGiven the risk of asymptomatic carriers and transmission, it should be the goal of every unit that every patient wear a surgical mask and every provider have a surgical mask for each patient encounter. [9] [10] The ability to execute this recommendation is obviously limited by supply, but that should be the goal. For any patients with respiratory symptoms full droplet precautions should be utilized including gloves, gown, surgical mask with a face shield. N95 mask should be worn in addition to droplet precaution PPE for any patients with suspected or confirmed COVID, and for any patient, regardless of respiratory symptoms, during indispensable aerosolizing procedures, including second stage of labor. 8, 11 As much as possible, oxygen should not be given aerosolized. In addition, hand hygiene with alcohol based rub after every patient contact and appropriate donning and doffing of PPE are critical. 8-12 Finally, rooms that are exposed need to be wiped down as respiratory viruses may spread from surface contact. 13 These aggressive measures can help limit transmission throughout providers in a healthcare setting. Table 1 summarizes our recommendations. \n\nGiven the significant risk of COVID-19 transmission between patient/family/healthcare providers, there should be strict restrictions on visitor policy.\n\n\u2022 Labor and Delivery:\n\nVisitation should be limited to one support person, in-person. Preference is for support via video, if patient agrees. All in-person support people should be screened as per Section 2. The support person should be easily identifiable by L&D staff; one suggestion would be to provide them with a special colored wrist band that must be worn at all times. Switching of visitors will not be permitted. Given public health emergency, no additional in-person support people should be allowed, including doulas.\n\n\u2022 Antepartum and postpartum:\n\nThere should be designated support person for the entire admission. This should be the same designated person as for delivery.\n\n\u2022 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: Parents may visit in the neonatal ICU -one at a time \n\nIn general, all efforts should be made to limit the movement of women from one care area to another (e.g., triage room to antepartum room to labor and delivery room). Admissions for delivery should remain on L&D; consider admitting stable admissions for antepartum monitoring directly to antepartum floor. For example, consider holding a woman with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes in triage for continuous monitoring and observation for a longer period of time than might typically occur, and then transferring her directly to the antepartum unit rather than moving her to a labor and delivery room as an intermediary stop.\n\nIn order to limit multiple visits to a healthcare setting, women should have routine preoperative labs (e.g., complete blood count, type and screen) the day of their CD.\n\nInductions of labor with medical indications in asymptomatic women should NOT be postponed or rescheduled. This includes 39 week inductions, after patient counseling. 14 However, in cases of \n\nManagement of the first stage should not be altered, unless specified below. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for GBS positive patients; immersion in water in the first stage of labor can be considered; oral restriction of fluid or solid food in the first stage of labor is not recommended; oral water and clear fluids can be encouraged as tolerated in labor. In the setting of oral restriction, IVF at a rate of 250ml/hr containing dextrose, is recommended; upright positions in the first stage of labor are recommended in women without regional anesthesia; women with regional anesthesia in the first stage can take up whatever position they find most comfortable;\n\nwalking should be recommended in the first stage of labor in women without regional anesthesia, but in the delivery room. Women with regional anesthesia can walk or not walk in the first stage;\n\ncontinuous bladder catheterization cannot be recommended in labor; the routine use of the peanut ball cannot be recommended in labor, as it has not been shown to be beneficial, and may be a way to transmit infection; oxytocin augmentation is recommended to shorten the time to delivery for women making slow progress in the first stage of spontaneous labor; higher doses of oxytocin can be considered; early intervention with oxytocin and amniotomy for the prevention and treatment of dysfunctional or slow labor is recommended; cesarean for arrest in the first stage of labor should not be performed unless labor has arrested for a minimum of 4 hours with adequate uterine activity, or 6\n\nhours with inadequate uterine activity in a woman with ROM, adequate oxytocin, and \u2265 6 cm dilated cervix. 15 Oxygen therapy\n\nAlthough oxygen via nasal cannula is not considered an aerosolizing procedure, the fact that nasal cannula/face mask are in contact with maternal respiratory tract and secretions makes handling of such equipment (taking on/off/adjusting) higher risk for chance of contamination/exposure between patient and provider. Recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that intrapartum oxygen has no fetal benefit, and may cause harm. 16, 17 In the current setting where reducing risk of COVID-19 spread among healthcare providers and patient is paramount, there is even more reason to not utilize oxygen therapy for fetal resuscitation. Given the likely high rate of asymptomatic carriers, 18 this principle applies regardless of patient's COVID-19 status.\n\nUse of nitrous oxide is the procedure that involves risk of aerosolization and involves respiratory contamination includes use of nitrous oxide. Recommend eliminating nitrous oxide use during COVID-19 pandemic. 19\n\nManagement of the second stage should not be altered, unless specified above or below. See general and specific guidance for first stage, much of which applies to the second stage as well. Pushing\n\nshould not be delayed, as it prolongs time to delivery, and increases chorioamnionitis and postpartum hemorrhage. [20] [21] Perineal massage 22 and warm packs 23 are each associated with decrease in 3 rd and 4 th degree lacerations.\n\nThere are concerns regarding limited resources for blood transfusion due to inability to run blood drives. Given this situation, all care should be taken to reduce need for blood transfusion including by optimizing antenatal hemoglobin prior to delivery. In addition to standard oxytocin, consideration should be made for prophylactic tranexamic acid and misoprostol (400 mcg buccally). 24 Use of cell-saver during cesarean delivery should be considered after stratification of risk of postpartum hemorrhage as well as institutional capabilities. If blood transfusion is indicated and hemorrhage is not ongoing, begin with transfusion of 1 unit rather than the typical 2 units of packed red blood cells, then reassess the clinical need for the second unit.\n\nSome have advocated for avoiding delayed cord clamping, even if vertical transmission has not been confirmed at the time of the submission of this manuscript.\n\nThe Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology has published interim guidelines based on expert opinion. As with other COVID-19 guidelines these are rapidly evolving. 19\n\n\u2022 Early epidural to minimize need for general anesthesia in the event of emergent cesarean section\n\n\u2022 COVID-19 is not a contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia\n\n\u2022 Consider stopping nitrous oxide use due to potential risk of aerosolization.\n\nWomen should be notified that in order to limit the risk of infection to themselves, staff, and other patients, they will be discharged in an expedited and safe fashion.\n\n\u2022 All vaginal deliveries should have a goal of discharge on postpartum day 1, or even same day if possible for selected women.\n\n\u2022 All cesarean deliveries should have a goal of discharge on postoperative day 2, with consideration of postpartum day 1 discharge if meeting milestones.\n\n\u2022 Discuss anticipated maternal discharge with pediatrics/neonatology to determine timing of infant discharge.\n\n\u2022 Home care with supplies for blood pressure follow up will be critical to expediting discharge of patients with a hypertensive disorder.\n\n\u2022 All postpartum visits, including wound checks, should be arranged for telehealth.\n\nPostpartum evaluation of cesarean wound healing or mastitis concerns may be optimized through use of photo upload options available in many electronic medical record patient portal programs. Encourage either long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) placement or Depo-provera injection prior to discharge for patients planning to use these to eliminate need for additional in person postpartum visits.\n\nTwo commonly used medications in obstetrics have been the source of study and controversy in the setting of COVID-19; NSAIDS, in particular indomethacin, is commonly used for tocolysis, and steroids, specifically betamethasone or dexamethasone used for fetal lung maturity. Additionally, we will also address the use of magnesium given respiratory morbidity of COVID-19 (Table 2 ).\n\nThere were early reports postulating NSAIDS may worsen the course of COVID-19. The virus binds to cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor; thus it was postulated that NSAIDS, which increase ACE-2 expression, may result in worsening disease. 25 However, this has not been substantiated, and multiple organizations, including WHO and the FDA have advocated there should not be a restriction on NSAID use. 26 In the setting of tocolysis, nifedipine may be considered as an alternative given the uncertainty regarding NSAID impact on COVID-19. These recommendations may change as additional data emerges.\n\nThe routine use of systemic corticosteroids in the setting of a viral pneumonia has been associated with increased morbidity. 27, 28 One study showed delayed viral clearance with use of corticosteroids with MERS. 29 Specifically with COVID-19 there is an association between steroid use and mortality, although these studies do not control for baseline morbidity. [30] [31] Generally, steroid use evaluated in these studies is higher than a two day course of steroids, however given the association between steroids and worsening morbidity of viral pneumonia and specifically COVID-19, steroids for fetal lung maturity should be used judiciously. Consider the following TABLE for steroid use for fetal lung maturity balancing benefit by risk of delivery within the next 7 days, gestational age, and potential risk based on maternal presentation. These recommendations are supported by the WHO. 5\n\nMagnesium sulfate is indicated for neuroprotection when delivery is anticipated <32 weeks or for eclampsia prophylaxis. [32] [33] There is no reported data regarding the impact of magnesium sulfate in setting of COVID-19. However, given potential respiratory complications with magnesium sulfate, it should be used judiciously in setting of severe respiratory symptoms.\n\nMagnesium sulfate may be used as indicated in patients with mild/moderate symptoms. B.\n\nThere are some changes noted with COVID-19 that have important implications in care for the pregnant patient. Specifically, COVID-19 may be associated with a transaminitis and thrombocytopenia. 30 This is an important consideration in a patient presenting with a hypertensive disorder in assessing whether she has severe features of preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome.\n\n\u2022 Delivery timing:\n\no COVID-19 severity peaks in the second week, it may be prudent to expedite delivery of the term COVID-19 positive patient with only mild symptoms. (Table) .\n\no Refer to intrapartum oxygen use guideline, given lack of fetal benefit, and risk of contamination/transmission with using an intranasal device, we do not recommend use of oxygen for fetal resuscitation in any patient, suspected COVID-19 or otherwise o Fluid restriction (total fluids <75cc/hour) unless concern for sepsis/hemodynamic o Before expressing breast milk, women should practice appropriate hand/skin hygiene washing not just hands but also breast prior to pumping.\n\no After pumping, all parts of the pump that come into contact with breast milk should be thoroughly washed, and the entire pump should be appropriately disinfected per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\no Expressed breast milk should be fed to the newborn by a healthy caregiver.\n\no For women and infants who are not separated, the CDC recommends that if a woman and newborn do room-in and the woman wishes to feed at the breast, she should put on a mask and practice hand hygiene before each feeding. 36\n\n\u2022 Pain control: current FDA and WHO guidelines are not to restrict NSAID use. We support continued use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain control and do NOT suggest increased narcotic use to replace ibuprofen/NSAIDs. These general recommendations may be modified depending on patient specific morbidity and as we have more information regarding the interaction between NSAIDs and COVID-19 severity. 26\n\nAll critically-ill COVID-19 patients should be in isolation as per hospital protocol.\n\nPPE equipment should be outside the patient's room or unit if it is a dedicated COVID-19 unit.\n\n\u2022 Corticosteroids: Given the potential risks of systemic steroids in the setting of COVID-19, steroids for fetal maturity should be used judiciously balancing benefit by gestational age with potential risks of worsening maternal morbidity. Decisions regarding use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity should be made in concert with critical care team and neonatology.\n\n\u2022 For patients > 24 weeks, electronic fetal monitoring for antenatal surveillance should be performed at least daily and with any change in maternal status if a cesarean at bedside is feasible. The fetus can be a \"sixth\" vital sign reflecting early deterioration in maternal status.\n\n\u2022 As per usual obstetric care, goal for saturations should be maintained >95%.\n\nSpecial consideration should be given to normal maternal respiratory physiology and how this impacts management of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):\n\n\u2022 Pregnancy involves a natural respiratory alkalosis with a normal PCO 2 of 28-32. 37 Therapy for ARDS involves low tidal volumes and permissive hypercapnia (PCO2>60). 38 Data on permissive hypercapnia in pregnancy are limited but there do not appear to adverse fetal affects. 39 \u2022 In the third trimester increased positive end expiratory pressures may be required.\n\n\u2022 Goal blood pressure should be <160/110 mmHg.\n\n\u2022 Patient should be positioned with left lateral tilt (if no other position is mandated for their treatment, for example, prone position) to relieve pressure from gravid uterus on venous return. o An assisted second stage is likely to be necessary.\n\no A dedicated obstetrician should be assigned to the patient with minimal change in providers, as the situation allows.\n\no The neonatology team should be present at the time of delivery, the infant should be placed in isolation after delivery, given the unknown risks of transmission.\n\no Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage should occur as detailed above.\n\n\u2022 The infant should be separated as soon as possible, and transferred to an isolation room appropriately.\n\n\u2022 Breastpumping is encouraged, after review of maternal medications, see Section 6 above."}
