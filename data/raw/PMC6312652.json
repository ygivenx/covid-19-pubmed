Cytochalasin D was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). Blocker of lipid transport 1 (BLT\u20101) was purchased from Calbiochem (Torrey Pines, CA). Sodium cholate, cholesteryl oleate, fucoidan, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 1\u2010Palmitoyl\u20102\u2010oleoyl\u2010sn\u2010glycero\u20103\u2010phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2\u2010dimyristoyl\u2010sn\u2010glycero\u20103\u2010phosphoethanolamine\u2010N\u2010(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (rho B), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).\n\nThe following synthetic peptides were ordered from Bachem (Torrance, CA): one 9\u2010mer peptide, GFLSKSLVF (human TREM\u20101213\u2010221, GF9); two 22\u2010mer methionine sulfoxidized peptides, PYLDDFQKKWQEEM(O)ELYRQKVE (H4) and PLGEEM(O)RDRARAHVDALRTHLA (H6), which correspond to human apo A\u2010I helices 4 (apo A\u2010I123\u2010144) and 6 (apo A\u2010I167\u2010188), respectively; and two 31\u2010mer methionine sulfoxidized peptides, GFLSKSLVFPYLDDFQKKWQEEM(O)ELYRQKVE (GE31) and GFLSKSLVFPLGEEM(O)RDRARAHVDALRTHLA (GA31).\n\nHDL\u2010mimicking lipopeptide complexes of spherical morphology that contained either GF9 and an equimolar mixture of PE22 and PA22 (GF9\u2010HDL) or an equimolar mixture of GA31 and GE31 (GA/E31\u2010HDL) were synthesized using the sodium cholate dialysis procedure, purified, and characterized as described.16, 17, 18, 22 For GF9\u2010HDL, the initial molar ratio was 125:6:2:3:1:210, corresponding to POPC:cholesterol:cholesteryl oleate:GF9:apo A\u2010I:sodium cholate, respectively, where apo A\u2010I was an equimolar mixture of PE22 and PA22. For GA/E31\u2010HDL, the initial molar ratio was 125:6:2:1:210, corresponding to POPC:cholesterol:cholesteryl oleate:GA/E31:sodium cholate, respectively, where GA/E31 was an equimolar mixture of GA31 and GE31.\n\nA quantitative in vitro macrophage assay of endocytosis of rho B\u2010labeled HDL\u2010mimicking lipopeptide complexes by J774 macrophage was performed as described.18, 19, 20 Briefly, BALB/c murine macrophage J774A.1 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Cellgro Mediatech, Manassas, VA) with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% heat\u2010inactivated fetal bovine serum (Cellgro Mediatech) and grown to approximately 90% confluency in 12\u2010well tissue culture plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY). After reaching target confluency, cells were incubated for 1 hour in medium with or without fucoidan (400 \u03bcg/mL), BLT\u20101 (10 \u03bcM), or cytochalasin D (40 \u03bcM). Cells were subsequently incubated for 4 hours and 22 hours at 37\u00b0C in medium containing 2 \u03bcM of rho B\u2010labeled GF9\u2010HDL or GA/E31\u2010HDL (as calculated for rho B). Cells were washed twice using phosphate\u2010buffered saline and lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Rho B fluorescence was measured in the lysates with 544\u2010nm excitation and 590\u2010nm emission filters, using a Fluoroscan Ascent CF fluorescence microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland). Protein concentrations in the lysates were measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) and an MRX microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocol.\n\nC57BL/6 female mice (10\u2010 to 12\u2010week\u2010old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) animal facility. All animals received humane care in accordance with protocols approved by the UMMS Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Mice (n = 6\u20109/group) were acclimated to a Lieber\u2010DeCarli liquid diet of 5% ethanol (EtOH) (volume [vol]/vol) over a period of 1 week, then maintained on the 5% diet for 4 weeks. Pair\u2010fed (PF) control mice were fed a calorie\u2010matched dextran\u2010maltose diet. All animals had unrestricted access to water throughout the entire experimental period. In treated groups, mice were intraperitoneally treated 5 days/week with vehicle (empty HDL) or the TREM\u20101 inhibitory formulations GF9\u2010HDL (2.5 mg of GF9/kg) or GA/E31\u2010HDL (4 mg equivalent of GF9/kg) (SignaBlok, Shrewsbury, MA) from the first day on a 5% EtOH diet. At the end of all animal experiments, cheek blood samples were collected in serum collection tubes (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and processed within an hour. After blood collections, mice were euthanized and liver samples were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis.\n\nTotal protein was extracted from liver samples using radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (BP\u2010115; Boston BioProducts) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (11836153001; Roche) and Phospho Stop phosphatase inhibitor (04906837001; Roche). Cell debris was removed from cell lysates by 10 minutes centrifugation at 12,000 rpm.\n\nSerum ALT levels were determined by the kinetic method using commercially available reagents from Teco Diagnostics (Anaheim, CA). Cytokine levels were measured in serum samples, and whole\u2010liver lysates were diluted in assay diluent following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Specific anti\u2010mouse enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used for the quantification of MCP\u20101, TNF\u2010\u03b1 (BioLegend Inc., San Diego, CA), and IL\u20101\u03b2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) levels. For normalization, the total protein concentration of the whole\u2010liver lysate was determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay.\n\nWhole\u2010liver proteins were boiled in Laemmli\u2019s buffer. Samples were resolved in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel under reducing conditions, using a Tris\u2010glycine buffer system; resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. SYK proteins were detected by specific primary antibodies (SYK, 2712 [Cell Signaling]; phospho\u2010SYKY525/526, ab58575 [Abcam]) followed by an appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase\u2010conjugated immunoglobulin G antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. \u03b2\u2010actin, detected by an ab49900 antibody (Abcam), was used as a loading control. The specific immunoreactive bands of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories) using the Fujifilm LAS\u20104000 luminescent image analyzer.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with on\u2010column deoxyribonuclease treatment. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and complementary DNA synthesis was performed using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories) and 1 \u00b5g total RNA. Real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using Bio\u2010Rad iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix and a CFX96 real\u2010time detection system (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories). Relative gene expression was calculated by the comparative \u2206\u2206Ct method. The expression level of target genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S ribosomal RNA in each sample, and the fold change in the target gene expression among experimental groups was expressed as a ratio. Primers were synthesized by IDT, Inc.; the sequences are listed in Table 1.\n\nSections of formalin\u2010fixed paraffin\u2010embedded liver specimens from mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or F4/80 (MF48000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and MPO (ab9535; Abcam) antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The fresh\u2010frozen samples were stained with Oil Red O at the UMMS Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center histology core facility.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Significance levels were determined using one\u2010way analysis of variance followed by a post\u2010hoc test for multiple comparisons. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM, and differences were considered statistically significant when P \u2264 0.05.\n\nPrevious reports showed that TREM\u20101 activation leads to the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines through nuclear factor \u03baB activation, which also regulates the expression of TREM\u20101, providing a positive feedback loop on the expression of the receptor.4 Proinflammatory cytokine expression is increased in ALD1, 2, 3, 23, 24; therefore, we hypothesized that TREM\u20101 signaling contributes to the amplification of proinflammatory pathways in ALD. To evaluate this hypothesis, first we tested whole\u2010liver mRNAs of EtOH\u2010fed and PF mice with or without treatment with two different TREM\u20101 inhibitory formulations and a vehicle control in a 5\u2010week alcohol administration model of ALD in mice.25 We found that mRNA levels of TREM\u20101 and MCP\u20101 were significantly increased in livers of alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls (Fig. 1A,B). In contrast, in mice treated with the TREM\u20101 inhibitors, both GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL inhibited alcohol\u2010related changes in TREM\u20101; in addition, MCP\u20101 mRNA levels corresponded to those of the PF controls (Fig. 1A,B). Although induction of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u00df in alcohol\u2010fed mice did not reach statistical significance compared to PF controls, TREM\u20101 blockade by GF9\u2010HDL resulted in a significant inhibition of TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA in the alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to vehicle treatment (Fig. 1C), while IL\u20101\u00df mRNA expression was also significantly attenuated by both the GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL formulations in the alcohol\u2010fed as well as in the PF groups (Fig. 1D). MIP\u20101\u03b1 mRNA levels were increased in alcohol\u2010fed mice, but TREM\u20101 blockade with GF9\u2010HDL or GA/E31\u2010HDL significantly attenuated this increase compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 1E). Regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES) mRNA levels did not change regardless of alcohol feeding or TREM\u20101 treatment (Fig. 1 F).\n\nNext, we used specific ELISA kits to assess the protein levels of cytokines in the serum and in whole\u2010liver lysates (Fig. 2). We found a significant increase in MCP\u20101 level in the serum and liver and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in the liver of alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls (Fig. 2A\u2010D). All these alcohol\u2010induced increases were prevented both in the serum and liver by administration of either TREM\u20101 inhibitor. Interestingly, we found attenuation of alcohol\u2010induced liver MCP\u20101 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 induction even in the vehicle\u2010treated (HDL only) groups (Fig. 2A\u2010C). The increase in total IL\u20101\u00df levels after alcohol feeding and its attenuation by TREM\u20101 inhibition did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2D).\n\nBecause TREM\u20101 is a membrane\u2010associated molecule that triggers SYK activation as one of its proximal signaling molecules and we previously found increased SYK phosphorylation in liver in ALD,24 we tested the levels of total and activated phospho\u2010SYK (p\u2010SYKY525/526) in the livers. We found significantly increased total and p\u2010SYKY525/526 levels after alcohol feeding (Fig. 2E\u2010G). Treatment with GA/E31\u2010HDL significantly decreased the p\u2010SYKY525/526 levels in alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to the untreated and vehicle\u2010treated alcohol\u2010fed groups, while GF9\u2010HDL decreased p\u2010SYKY525/526 levels compared to the vehicle\u2010treated group. (Fig. 2E,F).\n\nIn agreement with previous studies indicating that chronic alcohol use causes hepatic macrophage infiltration and activation,1, 3, 26 we found increased expression of the Kupffer cell/macrophage markers F4/80 and CD68 at the mRNA level. Treatment with the TREM\u20101 inhibitors significantly attenuated alcohol\u2010induced expression of both F4/80 and CD68 in the liver, indicating anti\u2010inflammatory effects (Fig. 3A,B). We also found a significant decrease in F4/80 expression on paraffin\u2010embedded liver sections by IHC in alcohol\u2010fed mice treated with either GF9\u2010HDL or GA/E31\u2010HDL compared to the EtOH\u2010fed vehicle\u2010treated group (Fig. 3C,D).\n\nNeutrophil infiltration of the liver is a characteristic of alcoholic hepatitis; therefore, we investigated markers associated with this cell population. Expression of the neutrophil markers Ly6G and MPO were significantly increased in livers of alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls. This was fully prevented by TREM\u20101 blockade (Fig. 3E,F). Interestingly, the HDL vehicle alone also resulted in a decreasing trend of Ly6G and MPO expression in alcohol\u2010fed mice; however, the GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL TREM\u20101 inhibitors significantly attenuated Ly6G and MPO levels even when compared to the vehicle\u2010treated alcohol\u2010fed mice (Fig. 3E,F). MPO staining on IHC confirmed that both TREM\u20101 inhibitors significantly reduced MPO\u2010positive cell numbers compared to the untreated alcohol\u2010fed control group (Fig. 3G,H).\n\nNext, we evaluated the impact of the TREM\u20101 inhibitors on hepatocyte damage and steatosis in liver. Serum ALT levels obtained during week 5 of the alcohol feeding showed significant increases in alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls. This ALT increase was attenuated in both TREM\u20101 inhibitor\u2010treated groups, indicating attenuation of liver injury (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, vehicle treatment (HDL) also showed a similar protective effect (Fig. 4A).\n\nConsistent with steatosis, we found a significant increase in Oil Red O staining in livers of alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls (Fig. 4C). Oil Red O (Fig. 4B\u2010D) and H&E (Fig. 4D) staining revealed attenuation of steatosis in the alcohol\u2010fed TREM\u20101 inhibitor\u2010treated mice compared to both untreated and vehicle (HDL)\u2010treated alcohol\u2010fed groups (Fig. 4B\u2010D).\n\nTo further assess the effects of the TREM\u20101 inhibitors on mechanisms of lipid metabolism, we tested genes involved in lipid synthesis (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 [SREBF1] and acetyl\u2010coenzyme A carboxylase 1 [ACC1]) along with the lipid accumulation marker perilipin\u20102 (ADRP) (Fig. 5A\u2010C). Both TREM\u20101 inhibitors but not vehicle treatment prevented alcohol\u2010induced up\u2010regulation of SREBF1, ACC1, and ADRP at the mRNA level (Fig. 5A\u2010C). To assess lipid oxidation, we tested peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A), and medium\u2010chain acyl\u2010coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) mRNA levels in whole\u2010liver samples (Fig. 5D\u2010F). Alcohol feeding significantly reduced mRNA expression of PPAR\u03b1 and CPT1A, while MCAD had a decreasing trend. Both TREM\u20101 inhibitors as well as the vehicle treatment significantly increased PPAR\u03b1 and MCAD levels compared to the untreated alcohol\u2010fed controls (Fig. 5D\u2010F).\n\nThe clinical progression of ALD is associated with liver fibrosis.27 Our mouse model of ALD mimics the early phase of the human disease, yet mRNA levels of early fibrosis markers Pro\u2010Col1\u03b1 and \u03b1\u2010SMA were significantly increased in alcohol\u2010fed mice compared to PF controls in the whole\u2010liver samples (Fig. 6A,B). Induction of these makers was remarkably attenuated in the vehicle\u2010treated group and, importantly, further decreased by the TREM\u20101 inhibitory formulations used (Fig. 6A,B).\n\nWe studied the uptake of GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL in vitro in order to evaluate potential mechanisms of targeted delivery of GF9 (GA/E31). Kupffer cells and recruited hepatic macrophages express high levels of SRs, including SR\u2010A, that are involved in phagocytosis and removal of oxidatively damaged lipoproteins and cells from the blood circulation.28, 29 We previously demonstrated intracellular macrophage delivery of GF9, GA31, and GE31 by macrophage\u2010targeted GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL, respectively, and hypothesized that the observed macrophage endocytosis of these complexes is SR mediated.16, 17 To further investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process, we used J774 macrophages as a model for Kupffer cells and incubated them with rho B\u2010labeled GF9\u2010HDL or GA/E31\u2010HDL in the presence or absence of cytochalasin D, fucoidan, or BLT\u20101, which are known to inhibit all SRs,30 SR\u2010A,31 or SR\u2010BI,32 respectively.\n\nIn the presence of cytochalasin D, which inhibits both SR\u2010A and SR\u2010BI, the macrophage uptake of both TREM\u20101 inhibitor complexes was significantly inhibited, suggesting that this uptake is SR mediated. Fucoidan, an SR\u2010A inhibitor, substantially suppressed endocytosis of TREM\u20101 inhibitor complexes at 22 hours but not at 4 hours, indicating time\u2010dependent mechanisms of SR\u2010A\u2010mediated endocytosis (Fig. 7B). In contrast, BLT\u20101, which inhibits SR\u2010BI, similarly inhibited the uptake of the complexes at both time points but to a lesser extent compared with that of fucoidan (Fig. 7C), presumably because of lower expression of SR\u2010BI on J774 macrophages.33 These findings suggest that SR\u2010A is the main contributor in SR\u2010mediated endocytosis of both GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL.\n\nInterestingly, quantitatively determined macrophage uptake levels in the presence or absence of fucoidan or BLT\u20101 were similar for GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL (Fig. 7). This importantly suggests that the combination of GF9 and apo A\u2010I peptide sequences in GA31 and GE31 sequences does not change the level and mechanisms of macrophage endocytosis of GA/E31\u2010HDL compared with those of GF9\u2010HDL.\n\nIn this study, we report for the first time an important role for TREM\u20101 in ALD. Using a mouse model, we found a significant up\u2010regulation of TREM\u20101 in livers of mice following chronic alcohol feeding. Treatment with novel ligand\u2010independent TREM\u20101 inhibitors reduced the expression of the TREM\u20101 molecule itself, attenuated or fully prevented alcohol\u2010induced increases in proinflammatory cytokines at the mRNA level, and inhibited SYK activation. We demonstrated that TREM\u20101 blockade results in reduced macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation indicated by reduced F4/80, CD68, Ly6G, and MPO expression in the liver. These findings complement our previous data demonstrating that TREM\u20101 blockade using GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL suppresses macrophage infiltration of the tumor in cancer mice.17 The TREM\u20101 inhibitors attenuated alcohol\u2010induced liver steatosis. HDL and the TREM\u20101 inhibitors also attenuated liver injury and markers of early fibrosis in alcohol\u2010fed mice. Interestingly, the HDL vehicle control showed similar efficiency as the inhibitory formulations at the protein level of the proinflammatory cytokines. We discovered that HDL has some protective effects on ALD at the level of ALT and lipid oxidation.\n\nWhile the ligand of TREM\u20101 is still unknown, it has been shown that TREM\u20101 activation amplifies inflammation and synergizes with TLR signaling pathways.34 It was also observed that bacterial infection and challenge with LPS or lipoteichoic acid increase TREM\u20101 expression,7 indicating a positive feedback loop among PAMP exposure, TREM\u20101 expression, and inflammatory cytokine induction. Different DAMPs, such as high\u2010mobility group box protein 1 [Correction made 31 October, 2018. The correct protein was noted.] and heat shock protein 70, have been suggested to stimulate TREM\u20101,35 while other studies found cell (granulocyte and platelet)\u2010surface\u2010associated activators as well.35, 36 Both PAMPs and DAMPs are present in ALD, providing potential mechanisms for TREM\u20101 up\u2010regulation in this disease. Alcohol induces changes in the gut microbiome and disrupts the gut barrier function, resulting in increased levels of endotoxin and microbial PAMPs in circulation.1, 37 Alcohol also causes hepatocyte damage that leads to the release of DAMPs,23 and all these processes contribute to TREM\u20101 activation.\n\nTREM\u20101 signaling leads to phosphorylation and activation of SYK, which has been indicated as a major regulator in inflammatory processes in ALD.38 TREM\u20101 also amplifies TLR4 signaling that involves downstream SYK activation and phosphorylation.38 Indeed, we found increased total and phosphorylated SYK levels in the livers of alcohol\u2010fed mice that was attenuated by TREM\u20101 inhibitor administration. A previous study showed that inhibition of SYK activation attenuates alcohol\u2010induced liver inflammation, cell death, and steatosis, suggesting that the SYK pathway could be a feasible therapeutic target in ALD.24 SYK is expressed in a wild spectrum of cells, while TREM\u20101 inhibition may specifically modulate macrophages, neutrophils, and stellate cells that each play a role in ALD. Another advantage of TREM\u20101 inhibition is that it likely attenuates signaling from a broader spectrum of TLRs, not only TLR4.\n\nTREM\u20101 activation alone has been shown to increase the production of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines.39 Furthermore, simultaneous stimulation of TREM\u20101 and TLRs by an agonistic anti\u2010TREM\u20101 antibody and different TLR ligands synergized in the induction of these proinflammatory molecules. TREM\u20101 and TLR4 costimulated monocytes showed increased production of MCP\u20101, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20108. In contrast, the level of the anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u201010 decreased when anti\u2010TREM\u20101 antibody and the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or the TLR4 ligand LPS simultaneously attached to their receptors.40 Because self\u2010perpetuating proinflammatory pathways are present in alcoholic hepatitis, interruption of these pathways using TREM\u20101 inhibition seems attractive.\n\nBy inducing TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, MCP\u20101, IL\u20108, and granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor and inhibiting IL\u201010 production, TREM\u20101 is involved in activation and recruitment of monocytes and modulation of inflammatory responses.40 Furthermore, TREM\u20101 expression was highly up\u2010regulated on the surface of infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils in human tissues infected by bacteria, highlighting the importance of this receptor in these processes.7 In alcoholic hepatitis, neutrophils infiltrate the liver, inducing oxidative stress and cytotoxicity that contributes to the high mortality of the disease.2 We showed that these processes can be attenuated by TREM\u20101 inhibitors. Mechanistically, the GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL formulations target the liver more efficiently than only the peptides alone and release the TREM\u20101 inhibitory sequences inside the target cells where these peptides likely inhibit TREM\u20101 signaling by disrupting the intramembrane interactions of the TREM\u20101 receptor and its signaling adaptor molecule DNAX activation protein of 12kDa [Correction made 31 October, 2018. The correct protein was noted.] (Fig. 7).15, 16, 17\n\n\nWe previously hypothesized that the observed preferential endocytosis of GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL by macrophages and hepatic clearance of these complexes are mediated by SR recognition of putative epitopes in the modified apo A\u2010I peptide constituents of GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL.16, 17, 19 Our current findings indicate that GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL are largely recognized by SR\u2010A on macrophages (Fig. 7). We also observed SR\u2010BI\u2010mediated uptake, which likely explains the previously observed hepatic clearance for these complexes in another animal model.19 While these data confirm our hypothesis, future studies are needed to determine the clearance properties for GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL in ALD.\n\nFurther, our present study demonstrates that GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL exhibit not only similar macrophage uptake in vitro largely driven by SR\u2010A (Fig. 7) but also similar therapeutic effect in a mouse model of ALD (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). This is in line with our previous studies where GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL exhibited similar therapeutic activities in cancer and arthritic mice.16, 17 We suggest that SR\u2010A epitopes are similarly exposed on GA31 and GE31 in GA/E31\u2010HDL and on PA22 and PE22 in GF9\u2010HDL, providing similar uptake of these complexes and as a result delivery of TREM\u20101 inhibitory GF9 peptide sequences in vivo. The use of GA/E31\u2010HDL in the further development of effective and low\u2010toxicity therapy for ALD is advantageous because it makes the entire manufacturing process easier and less expensive. We also suggest that the in vitro macrophage uptake assay can be potentially used to predict the outcomes for macrophage\u2010targeted TREM\u20101 therapy in vivo.\n\nIn addition to attenuating inflammatory processes, the TREM\u20101 inhibitory formulations also ameliorated hepatocyte damage and steatosis. Serum ALT and liver triglyceride levels were both decreased in the GF9\u2010HDL, GA/E31\u2010HDL, and HDL\u2010vehicle treated groups. The vehicle also had an inhibitory effect on TNF\u2010\u03b1 and MCP\u20101 protein levels as well as on mRNA expression of neutrophil and fibrosis markers, indicating that the HDL vehicle formulation can attenuate inflammation to a moderate extent. A previous study found evidence that HDL can protect hepatocytes from endoplasmic reticulum stress,41 while other publications reported a scavenger function of HDL for LPS and lipoteichoic acid42, 43 that could prevent immune cells from being activated by those molecules.42, 43 Further, the observed moderate beneficial effect of HDL treatment alone on fatty acid oxidation markers in alcohol\u2010exposed mice (Fig. 5A\u2010C) is in line with data that demonstrate infusion of reconstituted HDL reduces fatty acid oxidation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.44 In human and rat plasma, apo A\u2010I, the major protein of HDL, has been shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation.45 These data might provide an explanation for our findings of the hepatoprotective effects of HDL.\n\nOur study shows that TREM\u20101 inhibitors with HDL formulation exerted significant inhibition on early signaling events of proinflammatory processes at the level of cytokine mRNA and the activated p\u2010SYK protein levels compared to the HDL vehicle alone in a mouse model of ALD. This effect presumably would be even more obvious at the protein level of cytokines in a more severe liver injury. However, in mice, the most commonly used 5\u2010week alcohol feeding that we used resulted in moderate liver damage and minimal inflammation,25 which is a limitation of our study. Importantly, as shown on the stained liver sections, the GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL formulations significantly inhibited immune cell infiltration and steatosis compared to the HDL vehicle only group [Correction made 31 October, 2018. The word group was added.] in mice with ALD. Thus, exploration of TREM\u20101 inhibitors in decreasing inflammation deserves further investigation in ALD.\n\nDr. Sigalov and Dr. Shen are employed by SignaBlok.
