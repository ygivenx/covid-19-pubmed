{"title": "Correction to: Simultaneous detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and related bat coronaviruses by real-time reverse transcription PCR", "body": "Unfortunately, the concentration unit of plasmids was published incorrectly in the original publication of the article. The concentration unit, \u2018copies/ml\u2019 should be corrected to \u2018copies/\u03bcl\u2019. This changes do not affect to the analytic sensitivity of the method because the detection limits of 50\u2013100 copies/\u03bcL and 5\u2013100 copies/\u03bcL using pUC57-SARS-pS2 (a template for SARS-CoV) and pGEM-MERS-S2 (a template for MERS-CoV), respectively, were as sensitive as other real-time PCR methods [1].\n\n\nReference\nParker J, Fowler N, Walmsley ML, Schmidt T, Scharrer J, Kowaleski J, Grimes T, Hoyos S, Chen J (2015) Analytical sensitivity comparison between singleplex real-time PCR and a multiplex PCR platform for detecting respiratory viruses.
