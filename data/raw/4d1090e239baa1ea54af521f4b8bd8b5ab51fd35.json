{"title": "A Generalized Discrete Dynamic Model for Human Epidemics", "body": "So far a lot of dynamic models have been developed and used in the mechanic analysis and prediction of animal epidemics. Among them the differential equations based models are the mainstream methods, including SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) , Anderson-May model (Anderson and May, 1981) , the models of Zhang et al. (1997 , 2011 ), etc. Zhang et al. (1997 model was a group of differential-integral equations mainly treating susceptible and infected insect populations. The improved model (Zhang et al., 2011) was composed of nearly twenty differential equations supplemented by other equations. In these models, both susceptible and infected populations were treated as population density, and susceptible population interacts with infected population mainly through feeding on virus on the leaves spread by insects that died from virus infection. Serving as both explanatory and simulation models, they have demonstrated the better performance. Both SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) and Anderson-May model (Anderson and May, 1981) include differential equations (correspondingly, difference equations) for susceptible (s) and infected (i) populations rather than population density, and the two populations interact with each other through the interaction term, ps(t)i(t) (Fuxa and Tanada, 1987) . Nevertheless, numerous simulation results showed that both of their models are extremely sensitive to some of the key parameters and initial population sizes, especially the infection coefficient, p. Given true parameters and initial conditions, it was so difficult to synchronously obtain realistic results for population size and key time points (such as the peak time) although both of them are better explanatory models for the epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, the important parameters such as incubation period, hospitalization term, etc., were not included in such explanatory models and most of the other models (Chen et al., 2020a) . In present paper we developed a generalized discrete dynamic model for human epidemics, and sensitivity analysis and scenario prediction was made, aiming to provide a novel simulation tool for future uses.\n\nSuppose the susceptible population is infinite compared to the infected population, i.e, the susceptible population is approximately a constant. The susceptible population can thus be ignored. In addition, the hospital acts as a \"black hole\". The hospital accommodates infected cases, and the later recovered .

Some of the representative functions include\n\nr(t) = u n t n + u n-1 t n-1 + \u2026 + u 1 t + q (polynomial function)\n\nA method to find r(t) is based on the concept of reproduction number.

Ignoring the parameters b, a, and p, the epidemics will limitlessly increase if R 0 >1, will maintain at a certain level if R 0 =1, and will gradually disappear if R 0 <1.\n\nIn addition, we can set the parameters, p, a, and b in equations (1) Dynamics of non-hospitalization new cases will be diverse, which is dependent upon the specific .

Among them, the dynamic change of transmission strength (equivalently, the dynamic change of R 0 ) is one of the most important and controllable factor. The human epidemics can be deterministically weakened by reducing transmission strength. In addition, the results demonstrated that reducing the delay for hospitalization is much effective in weakening disease epidemic. Sensitivity analysis on non-hospitalization recovery rate reminds us the importance for enhancing immunity to recover from the disease. Mean incubation period is another key factor in determining disease epidemics. In a certain range, a short incubation period may lead to the rapid development and serious outcome of epidemic disease.\n\nAs shown in sensitivity analysis, the model performance depends upon the exact parametrical values. How to obtain the exact parametrical values for the disease is the basis for the better . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

On the other hand, some parameter, e.g., incubation period falls in an interval rather than a deterministic value. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis based on scenario prediction is necessary to obtain the most reliable prediction.\n\nIn present model, both asymptomatic infection and nosocomial infection were ignored due to their general insignificance in most epidemic diseases. For some diseases, however, these infections would play an important role and should be included in the model. Further, more complex models that include other factors or processes, e.g., network properties, can be developed for specific uses (Shams and Khansari, 2019; Chen et al., 2020a) ."}
