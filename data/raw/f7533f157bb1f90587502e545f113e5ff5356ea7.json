{"title": "Innate immune responses to influenza A H5N1: friend or foe?", "body": "Type A and B influenza viruses cause regular seasonal influenza e pidemics but only type A influenza viruses are associated with influenza pandemics. The virus haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the major surface proteins of the virus which induce protective host antibody responses and they are classified into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes by antigenic analysis. Influenza virus is a single stranded RNA virus with an 8-segmented genome. As with other RNA viruses, mutations generate genetic and antigenic diversity (\"genetic drift\"). The segmented RNA genome allows the virus an additional mechanism for generating diversity through genetic reassortment. The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 arose by the prevailing human H1N1 influenza virus acquiring a novel HA and the polymerase basic 1 (PB1) gene (and in 1957 also the NA) from an avian source to generate a virus with a novel subtype; H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968 1 . The origin of the H1N1 virus in 1918 remains controversial, with some arguing that it arose from an avian virus directly (i.e. all 8 gene segments) adapting to efficient transmission in humans 2 while others contend that it is also derived by reassortment 3 .\n\nAvian influenza H5N1 continues to zoonotically transmit to humans causing severe disease and poses a pandemic threat 4 . However, this virus has so far not adapted to efficient humanto-human transmission. In early 2009, a novel H1N1 variant (H1N1v) virus of swine origin emerged and has now become pandemic 5 . This confounded the previously held dogma that an influenza pandemic is associated with the emergence of a virus with a novel HA subtype. The novel H1N1 virus is antigenically distant from the prevailing human H1N1 virus and there is little prior cross-reacting humoral immunity in the population with the exception of those inviduals older than 60 years or so 6 . Thus we now have a pandemic virus of an influenza subtype (H1N1) that is already endemic in the human population. It remains to be seen whether the novel pandemic H1N1 2009 virus will replace or co-circulate with the previously endemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Although the infection appears to be comparatively mild, some patients have developed fatal pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 7 but information on the pathogenesis of pandemic H1N1 is still emerging 8 . In this review we will focus on innate immune responses in the pathogenesis of lung disease caused by influenza, with a particular emphasis on human H5N1 disease.\n\nInfluenza is typically a self limiting upper respiratory disease but may range from an asymptomatic illness to (rarely) a severe illness with potentially fatal complications, especially in those with a pre-existing underlying disease. Complications of influenza include pneumonia, exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 9 . Influenza is also associated with febrile seizures in children, encephalopathy which is particularly notable in Japan, and also with increased risk of myocardial infarction and strokes [10] [11] [12] . Since there is little evidence of systemic spread of the seasonal influenza virus, the systemic manifestations (e.g. myalgia) as well as some of these complications of seasonal influenza have been attributed to cytokines and other inflammatory mediators 10, 13 .\n\nThe pneumonia following influenza is generally a rare complication and may be a primary viral pneumonia, or more commonly, secondary to bacterial infection. In contrast, a primary viral pneumonia is a major manifestation of human H5N1 disease 14, 15 . Primary viral pneumonia was seen in the severe pandemic of 1918. A similar diffuse alveolar pattern of disease was also seen in a minority of young patients dying in the 1957 pandemic. Virus antigen has been detected in alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. There continues to be controversy over whether the lung pathology of primary influenza viral pneumonia is solely due to a direct viral cytopathic effect or whether it is contributed to by innate immune responses [16] [17] [18] . Primary viral pneumonia is also now being reported in those with severe pandemic H1N1v disease 8 .\n\nThe current lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus derives from a group of H5N1 viruses first recognised in geese in Guangdong province, China in 1996 19, 20 . These viruses have undergone a series of genetic reassortments with other avian influenza viruses to give rise to a number of different virus \"genotypes\" (constellation of 8 genes). The virus HA has also undergone genetic mutation over the last 14 years to give rise to a number of recognised virus clades and sub-clades which are antigenically and genetically diverse 21 . However only limited numbers of the H5N1 genotypes and clades are known to have caused human disease 15 .\n\nA number of viral mutations are recognised as potential virulence factors for humans. The non-structural 1(NS1) gene segment is an interferon (IFN) antagonist and plays a key role in evading host innate immune responses 22 . NS1 binds double stranded RNA thereby preventing the activation of 2'5'oligo(A) synthetase and the downstream consequences of its activation. NS1 interacts with RIG-1 RNA helicase and suppresses its normal function as a cytosolic innate immune sensor of viral infection 23 . The four carboxy-terminal amino acids of NS1 form a PDZ ligand domain motif which is relevant in mouse virulence 24 . The PB1 gene segment of most human and avian influenza viruses encode a second open-reading frame, PB1-F2. Via its interaction with mitochondrial proteins, PB1-F2 is believed to induce apoptosis 25 , enhance inflammation in mice and synergistically enhance the severity of secondary bacterial infections 26 . In addition, influenza virus infection blocks many features of dendritic cell (DC) maturation (e.g. co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86) that are key to T-cell stimulation 27 .\n\nWhile the basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site is clearly an important virulence factor for chicken and turkeys and also for mice, its contribution to virulence in humans is less clear. The PB2 Lys627 is associated with virulence in mice 28 and contributes to replication competence in mammalian cells at lower temperatures 29 . However, humans infected with clade 2.2 H5N1 viruses that consistently carry PB2 Lys627 do not manifest more severe disease; in fact the reverse may be true (see below) 30 . Other known viral determinants of pathogenicity include PB2 Asp701Asn, PB1-F2 Asn66Ser, NS1 Asp92Glu (reviewed elsewhere 31, 32 ) .\n\nAvian influenza H5N1 is inefficiently and rarely transmitted to humans in spite of repeated and substantial exposure to the virus 33, 34 . Underlying immunocompromising factors or other diseases associated with increased risk for seasonal influenza are not commonly observed in patients with H5N1 disease. Thus, exposure to virus is necessary but is not a sufficient explanation for the observed epidemiology -other factors such as host genetic or immunological susceptibility or unusual routes of exposure are likely to play a role. Interestingly, H5N1 disease is less common in those over 40 years of age, an observation not explainable by the population age-structure or risk behaviour of affected populations 35, 36 . It is possible that cumulative hetero-subtypic immunity through repeated exposure to seasonal influenza may contribute to this age distribution. There is increasing evidence of antigenic epitopes that can mediate such cross-subtype immunity 37 .\n\nThe overall mortality of patients with virologically confirmed H5N1 disease is over 60% 15 . While this observation may be skewed by the selective investigation and diagnosis of patients who are more severely ill, there is no doubt that H5N1 disease in humans is overall associated with a markedly worse clinical outcome. A proportion of patients appear to have a milder disease presentation and these have been most notably reported in Hong Kong in 1997 (clade 0 virus) and more recently in Egypt (clade 2.2 virus) although even then, overall case mortality was >30%. In these two instances, young children had a milder disease presentation than adults 30, 38 . Whether this reflects increased case detection of milder cases in Hong Kong and Egypt or is a reflection of differences of virulence of different virus clades remains unclear. Patients with severe H5N1 disease have a rapidly progressive primary viral pneumonia associated with leukopenia (a finding also documented in the 1918 outbreak), gastro-intestinal symptoms and mild liver and renal dysfunction 15, 38 . The key autopsy findings are diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, i.e. the pathology of ARDS. Patchy interstitial infiltrates and pulmonary congestion is seen with varying degrees of haemorrhage ( Figure 1A ). The cellular infiltrate predominantly comprises of macrophages, neutrophils and activated lymphocytes ( Figure 1B ). Apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells is noted. Lymphocyte depletion is seen in the spleen and lymph nodes [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .\n\nThe severe disease associated with H5N1 disease in humans may possibly arise through different mechanisms (or combinations thereof). These include a) dissemination of virus beyond the respiratory tract (in contrast with seasonal flu), b) higher and prolonged viral replication leading to direct viral cytolytic damage, c) differences in the tissue tropism of the avian H5N1 virus (in contrast to the human seasonal influenza viruses) and d) differences in host responses induced by H5N1 virus (Figure 2 ). While H5N1 virus appears to have the ability to spread beyond the respiratory tract, i.e. the virus can be isolated from the faeces 45 , serum 46,47 and very rarely from the central nervous system 46 , the lung pathology (ARDS) remains the major cause of mortality in human H5N1 disease. However, at the time of death, immune-histochemistry rarely shows overwhelming viral infection of the lungs and often very few if any virus infected cells are demonstrable 39, 41, 43, 44 . Since the limited autopsy data arises from patients who have died after prolonged periods of illness and assisted ventilation, the paucity of virus at autopsy does not of course preclude a major role for virus in initiating the lung injury.\n\nThe mechanism for ARDS is not fully defined, but cytokine-induced inflammatory responses are believed to play a significant role (reviewed in 48, 49 ) . Scientific approaches to address the pathogenesis of ARDS in human H5N1 disease includes clinical studies, investigations in relevant animal models and in vitro investigations. While each has advantages and limitations, a synthesis of knowledge from all three approaches would be informative.\n\nH5N1 virus load in the respiratory tract remains elevated for much longer than is usually seen with seasonal influenza 50 . This is not surprising because, in contrast to seasonal influenza which infects most of us repeatedly, leading to development of cross-reacting immune responses, most humans (perhaps with the exception of older individuals, see discussion above) are unlikely to have prior immunity against H5N1. The H5N1 polymerase complex is associated with its virulence in ferrets 51 . The Glu627Lys in the viral gene PB2 determines virulence in mice as well as efficiency of viral replication in mouse cells 52 .\n\nIt has been proposed that the avian H5N1, which binds sialic acids (SA) with \u03b1 2-3 linkages (typically found in avian cells) preferentially infects cells of the human lower respiratory tract. The alveolar epithelial cells express \u03b1 2-3 SA-Gal-GlcNAc while the upper respiratory tract has a paucity of these receptors. In contrast the human upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx, trachea) has an abundance of \u03b1 2-6 SA which preferentially binds the human seasonal influenza viruses H3N2 and H1N1. They also have O-linked \u03b1 2-3 SA which bind both avian and human influenza viruses [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Furthermore, within the lung, H5N1 viruses preferentially attach to type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages. These findings led to the hypothesis that the lung pathology of H5N1 is caused by differential targeting of the virus to the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, if the H5N1 virus is unable to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract, it would explain why the virus is not readily transmitted to humans. However, there are some key observations that do not fit in with such a hypothesis. H5N1 viruses readily infect ex vivo cultures of upper respiratory tissues e.g. nasopharyngeal and tonsillar tissue 54 and immunohistochemistry for viral antigen and virus receptors in tracheal tissue of a patient with fatal H5N1 disease demonstrated that the virus can be found infecting tracheal epithelium 58 . Conversely, some seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 can readily infect the ex vivo cultures of lung (lower respiratory tissues) 53,54 but they are not commonly associated with severe lung pathology. There are also patients with H5N 1 disease who had mild self-limited upper respiratory illness without lower respiratory involvement. As part of rapid diagnostic procedures, influenza antigen was detected in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal aspirates of these patients suggesting that H5N1 virus can in fact infect the upper respiratory tract 38 . While tissue tropism may well play a role, we contend that other mechanisms also contribute to the unusual severity of human H5N1 disease (discussed below).\n\nHost responses to influenza are clearly complex and involve humoral and cell mediated immune responses as well as innate immune responses. While specific antibodies are the best established correlate of protection against infection, cell mediated immune responses play a key role in recovery from disease 59 . Adoptive transfer experiments have shown that CD8 + T memory cells can crossprotect across different subtypes 60 . Furthermore, memory T cells induced in response to seasonal human influenza can cross-react even with avian influenza H5N1 61 . There is however, limited data on cell mediated immune responses in H5N1 disease. For the purpose of this review, we will therefore focus on innate immune responses, while remaining fully cognizant of the importance of the contribution of adaptive immune responses in the clinical outcome of H5N1 disease. \n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nAuthor Manuscript\n\nWhen compared with seasonal influenza, patients with H5N1 disease have higher serum levels of macrophage and neutrophil chemoattractant chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL2, IL-8) and both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3) 50, 62 . Patients who died had higher serum levels of these mediators than those who survived. However, the levels of these mediators also correlated with viral load in the nasopharynx and may simply be a reflection of increased virus replication and increased pathology 50 .\n\nFerrets, mice, macaques and other mammals have been used as experimental models for influenza pathogenesis, each with their own advantages and limitations 63, 64 . The most appropriate animal model for use depends on the purpose, i.e. vaccine evaluation, antiviral testing, transmission or pathogenesis. The most challenging of these is the choice of an animal model to study transmission and pathogenesis. While guinea-pigs are being used to study virus transmission, influenza causes minimal pathology or disease in this animal model 65 . Relevant features of available animal models for the study of pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 and human seasonal influenza are summarised in the table. Ferrets most closely mimic humans in the distribution of putative SA receptors in the respiratory tract while mice and macaques do not 57 . For instance, ferrets can be infected with human influenza viruses without prior adaptation while mice typically cannot. There is however a paucity of immunological reagents and genomic data on ferrets, an issue that currently imposes major limitations on the detailed immunological study of this animal model. While mice have been widely used for studies on influenza virulence and pathogenesis, particularly because of the availability of reagents, inbred mouse strains and mice with defined gene defects still have a number of caveats. Firstly, there is sometimes poor correlation between lethality of viruses for mice and for ferrets 63 . For instance, some H5N1 viruses are highly neurotropic in mice and fatality is therefore more likely related to virus dissemination to the brain rather than related to the lung pathology. Many investigators use H5N1 viruses with rapid lethality for mice because they provide a clear end-point, although such lethality may in fact reflect neurotropism rather than the ARDS-like lung pathology which is the cause of death in humans.\n\nIn general, in comparison with seasonal influenza viruses, HPAI H5N1 viruses show increased virulence in mice, ferrets and macaques with evidence of increased viral replication and dysregulated host responses. Mice infected with H5N1 had cytokine and chemokine responses including the IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-6 and MIP-2, MCP-1, KC (equivalent to human IL-8), IL-1 \u03b1, at day 3-5 post-infection [66] [67] [68] . This was associated with recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs causing acute lung inflammation 68 had more intense and more protracted expression of type I IFN responses, IFN-induced genes IL-1 and 6, TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL10 than was seen in H1N1 infected macaques. Similarly, H5N1 virus infection was associated with higher and more prolonged viral replication in the lung, more severe lung pathology as well as a dramatic depletion of CD4 + and CD8+ T cells and premature apoptosis of DCs 70 . Surprisingly, although the H5N1 virus induced a more potent IFN response, virus replication remained poorly controlled.\n\nThe aberrant host responses induced by H5N1 virus in mice and macaques is reminiscent of those induced by the 1918 H1N1 virus in these animals. In mice, the 1918 virus differentially activated apoptosis pathways, IL-6, type I IFN and Toll-like receptor (TLR) response genes and these findings were associated with severe pulmonary pathology 71 . Similarly further studies found higher viral titres in the lung and increased lung macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6 and IFN in association with the 1918 virus 68 .\n\nIn macaques, the 1918 virus led to dysregulated immune responses with higher IL-6 and lower type 1 IFN titres 72 . A recombinant seasonal influenza H1N1 virus with the 1918 HA and NA with or without the NS gene segment were studied for their pathogenicity in macaques 70 . While these recombinant viruses did not have the virulence associated with the full 1918 H1N1 virus reported by Kobasa and colleagues 72 , the 1918 HA and NA appeared to increase the virulence of the seasonal influenza H1 N1 virus and was also associated with changes in gene expression profile.\n\nWhen challenged with H5N1 viruses, mice deficient in IL-6 or MIP-1\u03b1 had comparable morbidity and mortality in comparison to wild type controls although this is not surprising since most cytokines and chemokines have some redundancy in their effector pathways. Mice with defects in genes for the IL-1 receptor, the type I interferons IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 had a worse outcome following H5N1 infection suggesting that these pathways are protective 67, 73 . Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 deficient mice as well as mice treated with anti-TNF antibody had less weight loss following infection when compared with controls although survival was no different 67 . This may reflect a role for TNF receptor signalling in the pathogenesis of influenza-induced lung disease although mortality (which in these mice was associated with neuro-invasion) was unaffected. In a study where a number of immunomodulators currently in clinical use were investigated together with an antiviral agent (zanamivir) in a mouse model of H5N1 disease, zanamivir in combination with a COX2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) and mesalazine led to improved survival when compared to the antiviral alone 74 . The hyper-induction of chemokines by H5N1 virus led to the accumulation of a particular subset of DC described as TNF-\u03b1/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) producing DCs (tipDCs) in the lung airways. These tipDCs are important for proliferation of influenza specific CD8 + T-cells in the lung. CCR2 defective mice who lack this chemokine attraction have markedly reduced accumulation of tipDCs in the lung leading to delayed virus clearance. However, modulation of the tipDC trafficking by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist pioglitazone moderated the deleterious effects of tipDC recruitment without losing its beneficial effects of cytotoxic T cell recruitment 75 .\n\nStudies with seasonal influenza viruses have suggested that defects in TLR-3 or COX2 are beneficial to mice challenged with seasonal H3N2 virus 76, 77 suggesting that innate immune responses may sometimes be deleterious. On the other hand, ferrets infected with a higher virulence influenza virus induced weaker type I and II IFNs and IL-8 mRNA but more IL-6 mRNA in the nasal fluid washes compared to animals infected with a lower virulence virus. The authors of this study speculated that the lack of an IFN response allowed the virus to spread to the lung leading to the increase in virus virulence. However, the lung cytokine levels were not measured 78 . These findings would support the therapeutic use of IFN to correct this weaker induction of IFN by the more virulent seasonal influenza virus.\n\nIt has been found that mice with inactivating mutations in TLR-4 or TRIF (but not MyD88) were protected from acute lung injury by chemicals as well as inactivated H5N1 virus administered intra-tracheally 79 . IL-6 deficient mice were also protected from lung pathology in this model. Inactivated H5N1 virus was shown to induce oxidized phopholipids which triggered an inflammatory response leading to acute lung injury (ALI) via TLR-4 and the TRIF / TRAF6 signalling pathway. Deletion of the Ncf1 gene, which controls reactive oxygen species production, reduced the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI. Collectively this suggests that oxidative stress and innate immunity are key lung injury pathways that control the severity of ALI. It remains to be seen if these pathways are relevant to infection with the live H5N1 virus.\n\nProtease-activated receptors (PAR) are activated by extracellular proteases that are abundantly found in the lung. PAR 2 was shown to be induced by seasonal influenza virus infection and appears to inhibit virus replication via an IFN-\u03b3 dependent pathway. PAR 2 agonists increase survival of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus infected mice. The increased survival was associated with reduced viral titres in the lung, reduced neutrophil infiltrates, reduced RANTES and increased IFN-\u03b3 secretion 80 .\n\nThe studies in humans with H5N1 disease as well those from animals experimentally infected with H5N1 and seasonal influenza viruses demonstrate that the increased pathology of the H5N1 virus is associated with increased viral replication and enhanced host responses. As these observations reflect the outcome of multiple cycles of virus replication and associated tissue damage in the human or animal, it is not possible to differentiate whether the aberrant host responses are merely secondary to the enhanced pathology caused by H5N1 virus, whether they reflect increased cumulative viral load, or whether there are intrinsic differences between viruses in their ability to induce these host responses. including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, IL-1 \u03b2, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCl5 and CCXL10 from primary human macrophages 68, 81 . Similarly, H5N1 viruses differentially upregulated CXCL10, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL5, and IFN-\u03b2 from alveolar epithelial cells 82 . Thus, many of the cytokines and chemokines found to be differentially elevated in the sera of patients with H5N1 disease (compared to seasonal influenza) were also more strongly induced in vitro using comparable challenge doses of the virus (Figure 3 ). This differential gene expression occurred within the first few hours of virus infection and was dependent on infection with live virus. Furthermore, increasing the infecting dose of H1N1 (low cytokine phenotype) virus to 10 times that of H5N1 virus could still not result in a comparable host response.\n\nCytokine responses are induced directly by the stimulus but are also amplified by autocrine and paracrine mediator cascades. The primary mediators directly and differentially induced by H5N1 virus are TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1, the other mediators being the result of autocrine and paracrine responses 83 (Figure 3 ). The induction of the primary mediators occurred, at least in part, by the virus differentially activating interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and p38MAPK pathways 83, 84 . In an intact organ, there are interactions between different cell types and we have tried to mimic such interactions between virus infected macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in vitro 85 . The virus-free supernatants of H5N1infected macrophages induce mediator cascades in alveolar epithelial cells and these lead to amplification and broadening of the host responses. For example, TNF-\u03b1 is not induced directly by the H5N1 virus infection of alveolar epithelial cells but virus-free supernatants from H5N1 infected macrophages do. COX-2 was found to be a key controller of this amplifying cytokine cascade and COX2 inhibitors could dampen these amplifying mediator cascades 85 (summarised in Figures 3 and 4) . Some of these cytokines (e.g. IFNs) are expected to have an antiviral effect (see above), but the overall effects of these cytokine cascades may well contribute to pathogenesis. While we had reported that H5N1 more strongly induced type 1 IFNs from alveolar epithelial cells 82 , others reported that H5N1 induced a weaker type 1 IFN response from differentiated bronchial epithelium than seasonal influenza H3N2 86 .\n\nTaken together these findings support the contention that the differences in host responses seen in animal models and in humans with H5N1 infection at least in part reflect intrinsic differences in the virus-induced host response. Interestingly, in contrast with H5N1 viruses, the 1918 H1N1 and seasonal influenza H1N1 viruses induced comparable levels of cytokines in macrophages infected in vitro 68 . Thus the differential host responses seen in animals with 1918 H1N1 infection (see above) might not reflect differential host response at the individual cell level, although further work needs to be done on other cell types (e.g. alveolar epithelium).\n\nIt is important to understand the virus genetic factors that determine the high-cytokine phenotype of H5N1 viruses. Using virus reverse genetics, we have established that the H5N1 virus HA and NA are not essential to the high cytokine phenotype. Rather, the constellation of internal genes, in particular the polymerase genes and NS gene segments play key roles in this 87 . Interestingly not all H5N1 virus genotypes manifest the high cytokine phenotype but those that are associated with human disease appear to do so 87, 88 .\n\nCytokine induction is not the only host response pathway that is differentially modulated by H5N1 viruses. Seasonal influenza virus H1N1 induces apoptosis pathways faster than H5N1 viruses 89 . Induction of early apoptosis is potentially a host defense mechanism to limit viral replication and these differences may therefore have pathogenic relevance. On the other hand, H5N1 viruses appear to enhance expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and lead to more potent bystander apoptosis of T cells 90 \n\nThe world is currently in the throes of a pandemic caused by a novel H1N1v virus. The disease remains relatively mild although a small minority of patients appear to manifest with a primary viral pneumonia which may progress to an ALI or ARDS-like clinical presentation. Most of these patients have been healthy young adults and some of them had no underlying illnesses that would predispose to severe influenza disease. While the clinical presentation in these patients with severe respiratory disease is reminiscent of human H5N1 disease 7 , the underlying disease pathogenesis remains to be explored.\n\nNotwithstanding the current H1N1v pandemic, H5N1 remains endemic in poultry in Asia and parts of Africa and continues to pose a major threat to public health. Its morbidity and mortality in humans not contained very effectively by antiviral therapy alone. For example, in Indonesia, while earlier commencement of oseltamivir treatment is associated with improved survival, even treatment within the first 4 days of disease is not a guarantee of survival and is still associated with a 42% mortality 94 . Alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. The first step towards this is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the lung pathology associated with human H5N1 disease and how it differs from seasonal influenza. Here, we have reviewed data that suggests that the innate immune response may be both friend and foe. This points to possibilities of novel therapeutic interventions that deserve further investigation. Preliminary data suggests that the differences in host responses induced by H5N1 appear to be similar to those of seasonal H1N1, albeit of greater intensity 83 but more systematic studies using gene expression profiling and proteomic studies to address this question are warranted. It is relevant to also investigate whether biomarkers that provide early indication of a poor prognosis can be identified to guide such immunomodulatory interventions. It is particularly interesting that targeting some signalling pathways that are associated with inflammation (e.g. the RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, NF-\u03baB activation) can also block viral replication 95 . Thus, such therapeutic interventions may potentially combine antiviral effects with beneficial immunomodulatory effects.\n\nAs the pandemic H1N1 virus arose from swine, its spread globally may possibly be associated with a panzootic of this novel H1N1 virus in swine. This enhances the opportunity for reassortments between the pandemic virus and other viruses including with H5N1 virus which has been reported in pigs 96 . The internal gene \"cassette\" of these swine viruses from which the H1N1 pandemic viruses arises appears to have unusual propensity for reassortment. Given the unprecedented severity of H5N1 disease and its continued threat to human health, it is important that we better understand the biological basis of its virulence and pathogenesis. This would also provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ALI and ARDS caused by influenza as well as other causes. ALI and ADRS arising from many diverse causes continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality 97 . Mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Arrows indicate the factors contributing to outcome. Higher levels of viral replication, the binding of the H5N1 virus to receptors in alveolar epithelial cells, and the spread of the virus beyond the respiratory tract could all contribute to the severity of human H5N1 disease. In this review, we argue that the H5N1 virus differentially activates host responses in macrophages and primary lung alveolar epithelia and such differences in host responses contribute to disease pathogenesis. This figure is modified from reference 3. Cytokine and chemokine induction in macrophages infected with H5N1 virus. Virus infection activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the p38-MAPK signaling pathways as well as others. Activation of these pathways leads to the expression of primary mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), the type I interferons (IFN)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 which in turn trigger release of other cytokines and chemokines through autocrine and paracrine effects. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in regulating cytokine expression within the infected cell, as well as those activated by secreted mediators in adjacent uninfected cells. (2), which trigger autocrine and paracrine proinflammatory cascades involving both cell types and infected as well as uninfected cells. These host responses are more potently induced by H5N1 virus compared to seasonal influenza viruses. Some of these cytokines (e.g. interferons) are expected to have an antiviral effect, but the overall effects of these cytokine cascades may well contribute to pathogenesis. The amplification cascade involving adjacent uninfected cells leads to a faster and broader "}
