{"title": "SENTINEL EVENT SURVEILLANCE TO ESTIMATE TOTAL SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS, UNITED STATES A PREPRINT", "body": "To date, testing for COVID-19 cases (clinical and otherwise) has been limited in the US. Hospitals and healthcare facilities that do have tests have limited the testing criteria to those with highest potential risk, to optimize the use of scarce resources [1] . Where widespread testing has occurred, increased prevalences in high-risk groups have been found [2, 3] .\n\nEvidence-based public health programming depends on data-driven estimates of disease burden to develop interventions. As such, accurate estimate of the underlying burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the US can provide critical information for hospital administrators, county-and state-level Departments of Health, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to optimize and prioritize resource allocation.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), that took place Feb. 26-29, 2020 outside Washington DC is a large annual event that draws approximately 20,000 participants from across the entire US, thus serving as a representative national sample. A single person was reported as 'presumptive positive' for COVID-19 on Mar 7, 2020, and exposure was reported to be prior to the CPAC event [4] .\n\nThe point incidence of COVID-19 in this defined cohort was used to estimate the national incidence during this period, and subsequent forecasting of current SARS-CoV-2 infections across the entire US. The number of attendees and number of confirmed cases were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total COVID-19 infections per day throughout the United States up to March 15th, 2020.\n\nThis analysis proceeded in three stages. Firstly, the point incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated for the CPAC cohort. Secondly, With an assumption that this group was a near-random sample of Americans, this proportion (daily incidence rate) was then extrapolated to the entire US population (329 million persons) to provide an estimated national daily incidence on March 1, 2020. Finally, this estimate with appropriate error structures, was projected forward in time using epidemiological parameters from the epidemic in Wuhan, PRC to forecast cumulative infections on March 12, 2020.\n\nData for this analysis were complied from routine sources; press reports from CPAC; and parameters estimated from modeling studies for the early (exponential growth phase) of the epidemic in China. The number of attendees and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at CPAC was collected from press reporting. The epidemic doubling time was taken from previous work which estimated from data on the outbreak in Wuhan, China. This doubling time from the Wuhan data was estimated to be 6.4 days, (95 CrI 5.8-7.1), and we used a lognormal distribution for D following literature values for other doubling times [5, 6] .\n\nProjecting this total infection burden forward (Fig. 1) This forecasted cumulative number of infections is consistent with those of Perkins et al., from independent data sources and with entirely different modeling frameworks, and greatly strengthens the validity of both sets of estimates [7] . The large number of predicted infections compared against the currently reported total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States suggest an important proportion of infections may be currently undetected, while entering a phase of potentially very rapid growth of the epidemic.\n\nThis analysis is not without limitations. Our forecasts are based on parameter estimates using best-available data at the time of analysis to inform public health policy (coined \"outbreak science\" [8] ). Demographic data for CPAC attendees was not available, so we are unable to assess how representative this sentinel event may be for the entire US population. This analysis also relies on simplistic models that assumes a well-mixed population, and uses data derived from transmission scenarios that may not represent transmission within the US. The upper limit of total infections should be interpreted with caution, as small uncertainties early in the projections also accumulate exponentially. Finally, this analysis does not account for spatial heterogeneity and diverse population mixing patterns throughout the United States, which are a critical driver of observed transmission.\n\nWe assumed that cumulative infections up to day t, denoted by I t , followed an exponential growth model:\n\nwhere I 0 is the number of initial infections, t is the time, in days, since March 1, 2020, and D is the doubling time (in days). Estimates of I 0 and D are needed to forecast the cumulative number of infections at time t.\n\nWe estimated total incidence among the US population on March 1st, denoted by I 0 , as follows,\n\nwhere P denotes the size of the US population (329M, [9] ), I (CPAC) 0 the incidence among CPAC attendees and P (CPAC) the number of CPAC attendees. The parameter I 0 represents the assumed fraction of the US population that is infected with COVID19. The incidence estimated from CPAC was extrapolated to the US population based on the assumption of equal incidence in CPAC attendees and the US population.\n\nThe initial relative incidence I (s) 0 /P was assumed to follow a beta distribution\n\nwith a prior over \u03b8, the probability of infection, equal to a B I\n\n. The prior is generated by having observed one sample from the general population with incidence \"as observed in the CPAC population\"\n\nThe doubling time of the disease was taken from previous work using data on the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and was estimated to be 6.4 days, (95 CrI 5.8-7.1) and lognormally distributed [5, 6] log D (s) \u223c N log(6.4), (1.3/4) 2 .\n\n3 .

Uncertainty in the number of infections was obtained by taking 30, 000 Monte Carlo samples of I 0 and D according to their probability densities, and constructing a probability mass function for trajectories, I t ,\n\nSpecifically, the 80% projection interval for I t is given by the 10 th and 90 th percentiles of samples {I Analysis was performed using R [10] for a 16-day window after March 1, in 1-day intervals. Standard 95% and 80% confidence intervals were constructed across the forecast period.\n\nAuthor(s) Description .
