{"title": "A novel semisynthesized small molecule icaritin reduces incidence of steroid-associated osteonecrosis with inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid-deposition in a dose-dependent manner", "body": "Pulsed steroids are frequently prescribed as life-saving agents for serious infectious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), or disease modifying drug for chronic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Steroidassociated osteonecrosis (ON) is a serious side effect of high dose steroid treatment. As patients with steroid-associated ON have generally poor surgical prognosis [1, 2] , it is highly desirable to develop pharmacological agents which may prevent its occurrence [3] .\n\nA consensus etiopathogenesis of steroid-associated ON has been recently unified on both intravascular thrombosis induced occlusion and extravascular lipid-deposition induced pressure, leading to impairment of intra-osseous blood supply [1, 3, 4 ]. An imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis resulting from endothelium injury induced by activated oxidative stress, which predisposes to both hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis, has consistently presented itself in the intravascular events [5, 6] ; while predominant lipid transportation to peripheral tissue and elevated adipogenesis via upregulated proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) expression is involved in the extravascular events [7, 8] . Although it has been experimentally confirmed that a combined administration of an anticoagulant with a lipid-lowering agent may help prevent steroid-associated ON [9] , the ideal strategy would be to simultaneously target both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid deposition to prevent steroid-associated ON development [4] .\n\nEpidemiological data showed that there was a lower prevalence (5-6%) of ON in patients recovered from SARS who were frequently prescribed a crude flavonoid extract of \"Bone Strengthening Chinese Herb\" Epimedium during their rehabilitation in southern China [10] , whereas there was a higher prevalence (32.7%) of ON in patients who were seldom prescribed a crude flavonoid extract of Epimedium in northern China [11] . Our previously published studies showed that, using our established rabbit model [12] , Epimedium-derived flavonoids (EF, composed of seven flavonoid compounds with parent ring) (Fig. 1A ) demonstrated beneficial effects in the prevention of steroidassociated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition in a dose-dependent manner [13, 14] . Our more recent study on intestinal metabolism of EF has shown that a single molecule Icaritin (ICT) (Fig. 1B ) may be involved in intestinal metabolism of those seven flavonoid compounds with parent ring in EF, which corresponds to the recent consensus that diversiform isoflavones with a parent ring may be intestinally metabolized to a single Equal for acting on pharmacological targets [15, 16] and Icaritin may be involved in enzymatic hydrolysis of prenylated flavonols [17] . As there were no available studies addressing the dose-dependent effect as well as the underlying mechanism of Icaritin in preventing steroid-associated ON development, the present study was accordingly designed to use our established rabbit model to examine the dose-dependent effect of Icaritin by evaluation on molecular, cytological, and haematological indices for intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based perfusion function indices, micro-CT based angiography, histopathological indices for ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition, and local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.\n\nEighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits with body weight of 4-5 kg were housed at the Laboratary Animal Service Center of Prince of Wales Hospital, the affiliated hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The animals received a standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref No.04/038/MIS). Based on our established protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON [12] , all rabbits were intravenously injected with 10 \u00b5g. kg \u2212 1 of lipolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. USA) on day 0 (week 0). 24 h later, three injections of 20 mg. kg \u2212 1 of methylprednisolone (MPS; Pharmacia & Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 h. Thereafter, the rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups: low dose Icaritin group (L-ICT; n = 28; 5 mg. kg \u2212 1 . day \u2212 1 ), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT; n = 28; 10 mg. kg \u2212 1 . day \u2212 1 ), and control vehicle group (CON; n = 28).\n\nBased on our standardized procedure (acid hydrolysis and then purification), 30 g Epimedium-derived flavonoids were taken in 1 N HCl-40% ethanol solution (v/v) at 20 times concentration (v/w) and heated to reflux in a water bath at 70\u00b0C for 10 h to hydrolyze sugars bonded to aglycone. The reaction was concentrated under pressure to remove the solvent. The residue was added to 300 ml ethanol, stirred 3 times and filtrated to remove precipitated salts. The filtrate was concentrated under pressure to obtain a crude product, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography, charged with silica 150 g gel. Chloroform and methanol were used as eluting solvents. Fractions were obtained by increasing the ratio of chloroform and methanol from 10:1 to 2:1, such that 4.2 g of Icaritin was produced. Icaritin was structurally identified by ESI-MS and NMR, and purity was confirmed at 98.6% by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nAt week 0 (immediately before LPS injection), 1 and 2 postinduction, blood sample was taken for examination on coagulation index (APTT, i.e. activated partial thromboplatin time) [12, 13] , fibrinolysis index (t-PA/PAI-I, i.e. ratio of tissue type plasminogen activator to plasminogen activator inhibitor) [12, 13] , lipidtransportation index (LDL/HDL, i.e. ratio of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol) [12, 13] , endothelium injury index (TM, i.e. thrombomodulin) [39, 40] , oxidative stress index (GSH/LPO, i.e. ratio of glutathione to lipid peroxide) [6] , and hepatocyte injury index (GPT, i.e. glutamate-pyruvate transaminase). Marrow samples from iliac crest were obtained for evaluation on adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell (adipocyte In ON + rabbits, thrombi were predominantly found in small marrow vessels in ON + rabbits, and marrow was mainly occupied by numerous fat cells with increased size in ON + rabbits (D) compared to normal rabbits (C). Strong immunoreactivity was found in both marrow cells (E) and endothelium (G) in the CON group at week 1 and 2 post-induction. Weak immunoreactivity was found in both marrow cells (F) and endothelium (H) in either the baseline or H-ICT group at week 1 and 2 post-induction. Baseline information not shown here. Arrow pointed particles in G and H were angiographic substance. positvie colonies) and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression at baseline (immediately before LPS injection, i.e. week 0), week 1 and week 2 post-induction [41] . Dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index (vascularization index-PEP, i.e. 'peak enhancement percentage'; permeability index-PS\u03c1, i.e. 'permeability surface area product per unit volume of tissue') before sacrifice at baseline, week 1, and week 2 post-induction, using a bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) [12, 13, 42] .\n\nFour, eight and sixteen rabbits in each group were sacrificed with overdose sodium pentobarbitone at baseline, week 1 and 2 postinduction. Under general and deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, the abdomen cavity was opened for perfusion with a confected radiopaque silicone rubber, using our previously established protocol [13] . Then, the bilateral proximal femora were dissected for micro-CT-based three-dimensional (3-D) angiography after specimen decalcification, including a histogram generated to display size (thickness) distribution of angiographic structural units and a color-coded scale mapped to the surface of the 3-D images to provide a visual representation of size distribution of angiographic structural units [12, 13] . Histopathological examination was performed to identify local ON lesion by established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow [43] . Each rabbit that had at least one ON lesion in the areas was considered as ON + , while that without ON lesion was considered as ON \u2212 . ON incidence was defined as numbers of ON + rabbits divided by numbers of total rabbits in each group, and ON extent was defined as numbers of ON lesions per ON + rabbit [12, 13] . Intravascular thrombosis index (thrombotic vessle counts), extravascular lipid-deposition index (fat cell area fraction) [41] and size distribution of extravascular leakage particles during angiography were also quantified histomorphometrically [14, 44] . Local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was graded by a semi-quantitative estimation of immunoreactivity: negative (\u2212), weak (+), moderate (++), strong (+++) [45] . The body weight of each rabbit before sacrifice was documented and survival condition throughout the experiment period in each group was recorded.\n\nCategorial data, i.e. ON incidence, was analyzed using Fisher's exact probability test. Numeric data in each group was expressed as Mean \u00b1 SD. Hisopathological data was examined using Analysis of Covariance (ANOVA), using LSD' s post hoc multiple comparisons. Longitudinal numeric data, i.e. dynamic perfusion MRI data, marrow molecular, cytological, and haematological data, were analyzed using 'ANOVA of Repeated Measures', using LSD's post hoc multiple comparisons. All statistical analysis were performed using SPSS 10.0. Statistical significance for compaison was set at p b 0.05.\n\nGPT, as an index of hepatocyte injury, did not significantly change from baseline among all groups throughout the experimental period (data not shown here). No organ bleeding or death occurred in any group throughout the experimental period. ON lesion was not found until week 2 post-induction in any group. ON lesion was histopathologically characterized with trabecular bone containing empty lacunae with increased marrow fat cell size (Figs. 2A-D). The ON incidence was 93% (15/16) in the CON group, 56% (9/16) in the L-ICTgroup and 6% (1/16) in the H-ICT group. Fisher's exact probability test showed that the ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the CON group (pb 0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (pb 0.05). There was no significant difference in the ON extent among the CON group (2.8\u00b10.8), L-ICT group (2.6\u00b10.5), and H-ICT group (2.3\u00b10.6) (Figs. 3A, B).\n\nHistopathologically, thrombi were predominantly found in small marrow vessels in the CON group from week 1 post-induction ( Figs. 2A, B) . The thrombotic vessel count in the CON group peaked at week 1 post induciton, and maintained until week 2 post indcution. There was a signficant difference in the changing pattern of the thrombotic vessel counts between the CON group and two Icaritin groups. The increased thrombotic vessel count in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group throughout the experimental period. The mangnitude of the thrombotic vessel count at week 1 post induction was similar to those at week 2 post indctuion, i.e. CON N L-ICT N H-ICT (Fig. 3D) .\n\nBoth TM and APTT in the CON group increased significantly at week 1 post-induction (p b 0.00 for both), then both declined toward baseline. There was a signficant difference in the changing pattern post-induction between the CON group and two Icaritin groups (p b 0.05 for L-ICT vs CON and p b 0.01 for H-ICT vs CON in both TM and APTT). In particular, the significant increase in both TM and APTT in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 4A, B) .\n\nBoth tPA/PAI-I and GSH/LPO in the CON group significantly decreased at week 1 post-induction (p b 0.01 for both), then returned toward baseline. There was a signficant difference in the changing pattern post-induction between the CON group and two Icaritin groups for both tPA/PAI-I and GSH/LPO (p b 0.05 for L-ICT vs CON and p b 0.01 for H-ICT vs CON in both tPA/PAI-I and GSH/). In particular, the significant decrease in both tPA/PAI-I and GSH/LPO in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 4C, D).\n\nHistopathologically, marrow was predominantly occupied by numerous fat cells in the CON group after induction (Figs. 2C, D). The fat cell area fraction in the CON group increased signficantly at week 1 post induciton, and this fraction maintained until week 2 post induction (p b 0.05 for both). There was a signficant difference in the changing pattern post-induction between the CON group and two Icaritin groups. The significantly increased fat cell area fraction in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group throughout the experimental period. The magnitude of fat cell area fraction at week 1 post indctuion was smilar to that at week 2 post indctuion, i.e. CON N L-ICT N H-ICT (Fig. 3C) .\n\nThe adipocyte positive colonies, LDL/HDL and PPARgamma2 expression in the CON group increased significantly at week 1 postinduction (p b 0.01 for all indices), thereafter moderately restored toward baseline for both the adipocyte positive colonies and PPARgamma2 expression, or returned to baseline for LDL/HDL. There was a significant difference in the changing pattern over time between the CON group and two Icaritin groups for the adipocyte positive colonies, LDL/HDL and PPARgamma2 expression (p b 0.05 for L-ICT vs CON and p b 0.01 for H-ICT vs CON in all indices). In particular, the significant increase in the adipocyte positive colonies, PPARgamma expression and LDL/HDL in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 postinduction (Figs. 4E-H).\n\nThe PEP in the CON group decreased significantly at week 1 postinduction (p b 0.01), then significantly increased over baseline at week 2 post-induction (p b 0.01). There was a significant difference in the changing pattern of the PEP over time between the CON group and two Icaritin groups (p b 0.01 for L-ICT vs CON and p b 0.01 for H-ICT vs CON). In particular, the significant decrease in the PEP in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A-C) .\n\nThe PS\u03c1 in the CON group increased significantly at week 1 postinduction (p b 0.01), further significantly increased at week 2 postinduction (p b 0.01). There was a significant difference in the changing pattern of the PS\u03c1 over time between the CON group and two Icaritin groups (p b 0.05 for CON group vs CON, and p b 0.01 for H-ICT vs CON). In particular, the significant increase in the PS\u03c1 in the CON group was The angiograms in the CON group at week 1 post-induction showed dilated vessel-like structural units (N 600 \u00b5m) surrounded by both numerous medium size widespread leakage-particle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) and few vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m or 400-600 \u00b5m), when compared to those at baseline (Fig. 7A) . The dilated vessel-like structural units ( N 600 \u00b5m) could be due to occlusion of downstream vessels (400-600 \u00b5m). The few vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m or 400-600 \u00b5m) could be explained by vessel occlusion. Relative to those in the CON group at week 1 postinduction, no typical dilated vessel-like structural units surrounded by numerous medium-sized widespread leakage-particle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) (also confirmed histologically below by histogram of leakage particle size) were found in the H-ICT group except for a few in the L-ICT group, and reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m or 400-600 \u00b5m) was rarely found in the H-ICT group but occasionally found in the L-ICT group (Figs. 7B, C).\n\nAt week 2 post-induction, the angiograms in the CON group demonstrated dilated vessel-like structural units ( N 600 \u00b5m) surrounded by both numerous small size vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m) and numerous medium-sized widespread leakageparticle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m), when compared to those at baseline (Fig. 7D) . The increased small size vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m) could be explained by angiogenesis under local hypoxia. Relative to those in the CON group at week 2 post-induction, dilated vessel-like structural units surrounded by many small size vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m) and numerous medium-sized widespread leakage-particle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) were not found in the H-ICT group but moderate in the L-ICT group, and reduced perfusions to vessel-like structural units (400-600 \u00b5m) were rarely found in the H-ICT group but occasionally found in the L-ICT group (Figs. 7E, F) .\n\nExtravascular leakage particles during perfusion for micro-CT-based angiography were more common in the CON group after induction, whereas these were rarely found in the H-ICT group and very occasionally found in the L-ICT group after induction (Figs. 6D, E). All histograms showed the size of the leakage particles ranged between 200 \u00b5m and 400 \u00b5m (Figs. 7G, H) . \n\nWeak (+) or absent (\u2212) immunoreactivity was found at baseline before induction. In the CON group, moderate (++) immunoreactivity located in both marrow cells and endothelium (confirmed by CD31) was found at week 1 post-induction, with strong immunoreactivity (+++) being found until week 2 post-induction. In the L-ICT group, immunoreactivity was found weak (+) or moderate (++) at week 1 post-induction, and weak (+) at week 2 post-induction. In the H-ICT group, immunoreactivity was weak (+) at week 1 postinduction, and weak (+) or absent (\u2212) at week 2 post-induction. Representative changes in graded estimation for local VEGF-A expression in each group for bone marrow (Figs. 2E, F) and endothelium is shown (Figs. 2G, H) .\n\nThis was the first experimental study that demonstrated dosedependent effect of a novel semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON in rabbits with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipiddeposition for maintaining integrity of intraosseous vasculature.\n\nThe results of the calculated ON incidence indicates that the semisynthesized Icaritin is potentially an effective agent for reducing risk of steroid-associated ON in dose-dependent manner at the employed dosages (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) ( Figs. 2A and 3A) . This is comparable to the prevention effect of Epimedium-derived flavonoids at employed dosages (10 mg/kg and 20-40 mg/kg) shown in our previous studies [13, 14] . This study also provides experimental explanation for the previously noted clinical observation that ON prevalence was lower in SARS patients frequently prescribed crude extract of Epimedium in southern China than those seldom prescribed crude extract of Epimedium in northern China [10, 11, 18 ]. On the other hand, no significant difference in the ON extent among the three groups (Fig. 3B) was observed suggesting that a threshold exists beyond which ON is initiated, which is consistent with the findings in our recent study [13] and other researchers' study [9] . It also indicated that Icaritin was able to modulate the ON threshold. However, once the threshold was reached, Icaritin had little effect on occurrence of ON.\n\nRecently, toxicity, in the form of organ bleeding, is a major concern following administration of a combination of an anticoagulant and a lipid-lowering agent for prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis development even though the efficacy of such a pharmaceutical combination strategy was experimentally confirmed [9] . In this study, Icaritin was safe throughout the observation period, with no evidence by any hepatocyte injury, bleeding or accidental death when using the two different Icaritin dosages.\n\nIcaritin was able to dose-dependently inhibit intravascular thrombosis (Fig. 3C) , as evidenced by the increased thrombotic vessel count in the CON group which was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group (Figs. 2B, C) .\n\nEndothelium injury is recognized to be an important initial contributor to intravascular thrombosis. Soluble TM in plasma is an index of endothelial injury. Endothelium TM is a cell surface glycoprotein that is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and, along with protein C, plays a role in counteracting both hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis after endothelial cell injury, which maintain balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis [19] . In the present study, a significant increase in TM in the CON group at week 1 postinduction was found (Fig. 4A) , consistent with other study [20] . Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to prevent endothelium from injury in a dose-dependent manner, as seen by the significantly increased TM in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction.\n\nOxidative stress has been identified as an important mechanism contributing to endothelium injury during steroid-associated ON occurrence [6, 21] . GSH/LPO in plasma is a biochemical marker indicating level of oxidation stress [22] . GSH stabilizes lysosomal membrane suppressing vascular endothelium injury by inhibiting increase in lipoperoxides and maintaining cellular oxidation balance in favor of reduction [23] [24] [25] . LPO is generated by hyperoxidation of lipids, a biochemical indicator of tissue injury by active oxygens, closely associated with vascular injury [26, 27] . In the present study, a significant decrease in GSH/LPO in CON group at week 1 postinduction was found (Fig. 4D) , which was consistent with the findings of an experimental study of steroid-induced ON in rabbits [6] . The close correlation between GSH/LPO and TM (R 2 = 0.78) at 1 week postinduction strongly suggested that activated oxidative stress was involved in endothelium injury at an early stage during steroidassociated ON development. Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to protect the endothelium from oxidative stress in a dosedependent manner, as shown by a significant decrease in GSH/LPO in the CON group which was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost negated in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. This implied a protective effect of Icaritin on intravascular endothelium injury resulting from activated oxidative stress. This is not unexpected given that several flavonoids family agents derived from herbs have been identified as potential therapeutic antioxidants in different animal models [28] [29] [30] .\n\nRegarding coagulation and fibrinolysis secondary to endothelium injury, APTT is an index of coagulation, and tPA/PAI-I is an index of fibrinolysis. Imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis may predispose intravascular thrombosis. In the present study, a significant decrease in APTT level and tPA/PAI-I level in the CON group at week 1 post-induction was found (Fig. 4B) , which was in accordance with clinical findings in steroid-associated ON patients [5] . This study also indicated that Icaritin was able to dose-dependently counteract both hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis at an early stage during steroid-associated ON development, as evidenced by the significantly decreased level of APTT and tPA/-I in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction.\n\nThe specific histopathological examination suggested that Icaritin was able to inhibit extravascular lipid deposition in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D) , as evidenced by the significantly increased fat cell area fraction in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group (Figs. 2C, D) .\n\nRegarding pathogenesis of extravascular lipid deposition during the early stage of steroid-associated ON development, the imbalance between local adipogenesis and lipid transportation from peripheral tissue is regarded as an important contributory event [4, 7, 31] , as characterized by both elevated adipogenesis and lowered lipid transportation from peripheral tissue.\n\nIn this study, a high level of adipocyte positive colonies (an adipogenic potential index) and LDL/HDL (a lipid-transportation index) was used to reflect excessive adipogenesis and increased lipid transport to peripheral tissue, respectively [7] . It was shown that both excessive adipogenesis and lowered lipid transportation from peripheral tissue occurred at the early stage of steroid-associated ON development (Figs. 4E, F) , as evidenced by the significantly increased level of adipocyte positive colonies and LDL/HDL in the CON group at week 1 post-induction. These findings were consistent with our previously published data [12, 13] and with another recently reported study [31] . The results also indicated that Icaritin was able to counteract both elevated adipogenesis and lowered lipid transportation from peripheral tissue in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by the significant increase in adipocyte positive colonies and LDL/HDL in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction.\n\nPPARgamma, as a transcription factor, has been proposed to play a central role in steroid-associated adipogenesis, which is support by both in vitro [8] and in vivo studies [32] . In the present study, a significant increase in PPARgamma protein expression in the CON group at week 1 post-induction was found (Figs. 4G, H) , corresponding to an up-regulated PPARgamma expression at mRNA level during steroid-associated ON development in our published animal studies [13, 14] . The close correlation between the up-regulated PPARgamma expression and increased adipocyte positive colonies (R 2 = 0.86) at week 1 post-induction in the present study strongly indicated that adipogenic protein PPARgamma was involved in the pathogenic mechanism of excessive extravascular adipogenesis at early stage of steroid-associated ON development. Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to dose-dependently down-regulate PPARgamma protein expression, as evidenced by the significantly up-regulated PPARgamma protein expression in the CON group which was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction, suggesting that suppression of PPARgamma protein expression contributes to the inhibitory effect of Icaritin on extravascular adipogenesis for lipid deposition. This is not surprising given that a series of herb-derived flavonoid/isoflavone family agents have been shown to be potential down-regulators of PPARgamma for anti-adipogenic [33] .\n\nTheoretically, vascularization insufficiency may not be sufficient to meet the oxygen and nutrient requirements of homeostatic tissue metabolism. Alternatively, excessive permeability, i.e. hyperpermeability, may induce high interstitial fluid pressure minimizing tissue perfusion and hindering local oxygen and nutrient delivery [34] .\n\nDynamic contrast-enhanced MRI indicated insufficient vascular perfusion at an early stage, as evidenced by the significantly decreased PEP in the CON group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A, B, D) . Structurally, micro-CT based angiography suggested a prominent decrease in perfused vessels, as evidenced by few vessel-like structural units (36-200 \u00b5m or 400-600 \u00b5m) excluding leakageparticle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) at week 1 post-induction compared to those at baseline (Figs. 6A,B, and 7A) . The consistency in \"vascular quantity\" between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based functional evidence and micro-CT based structural evidence at an early stage indicated impairment of local arterial supply, which was reflected by the up-regulated VEGF expression in situ at week 1 postinduction (Figs. 2E-H) . VEGF is an important signaling protein for physiological and pathological angiogenesis under hypoxia condition [35] . The results also indicated that Icaritin was able to dose-dependently maintain \"vascular quantity\" at an early stage, as evidenced by the following three functional-, structural-, and molecular-level evidences. First, the significantly decreased PEP in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A-C). Second, the reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units \u00b5m or 400-600 \u00b5m) was hardly observed in the H-ICT group but was occasionally in the L-ICT group at week 1 postinduction (Figs. 7B, 5C) . Third, the moderate (++) immunoreactivity in the CON group was attenuated to (+/++) in the L-ICT group and prevented to (+) in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction, suggesting that local hypoxia was relieved by Icaritin (Figs. 2E-H) .\n\nAt week 2 post-induction, considerable neovasculature was seen in the CON group, as evidenced by the significantly increased PEP over baseline (Figs. 5A-C) and the presence of numerous small size vessellike structural units \u00b5m) compared to baseline (Fig. 7D ). This could be explained by local hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, as evidenced by local VEGF expression which was maintained at high level in the CON group throughout the experimental period. Icaritin was able to continuously relieve local hypoxia condition during steroid-associated ON development, as reflected by the continuously maintained high expression of VEGF in the CON group being attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group throughout the experimental period (Figs. 2E-H) .\n\nDynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based permeability index suggested the presence of hyperpermeability in the CON group at an early stage, as evidenced by the significantly increased PS\u03c1 in the CON group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A, B, D) . Micro-CT based angio-graphy indicated the presence of many medium-sized disseminated leakageparticle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) at week 1 post-induction compared to baseline (Fig. 7A ). This consistency in \"vascular permeability\" between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based functional evidence and micro-CT based structural evidence suggested that local impairment of local blood supply in the CON group at an early stage could be secondary to endothelium injury, a likelihood that was supported by a significant increase in serum TM in the CON group at week 1 post-induction. These findings also concur with a recent work reporting an increase in vascular permeability in steroid-induced ON model [6] . Our results also indicated that Icaritin was able to control \"vascular permeability\" at an early stage in a dose-dependent manner, as supported by the following two functional-and structural-level evidences: 1) the significantly increased PS\u03c1 in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 5A, B, D); and 2) nu-merous mediumsized disseminated leakage-particle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m, and confirmed histologically as by leakage particles) (Figs. 7G, 7H) in the CON group were not found in the H-ICT group but found only occasionally in the L-ICT group at week 1 post-induction (Figs. 7B, C).\n\nAt week 2 post-induction, worsening hyperpermeability was apparent, as shown by the significantly increased PS\u03c1 and the presence of more small-sized vessel-like structural units \u00b5m) compared to week 1 post-induction in the CON group (Figs. 5A, B, D) . The worsening hyperpermeability could be explained by continuous high level of VEGF expression, which was attributed to VEGF-induced angiogenesis accompanied by a vascular permeability response [36] [37] [38] , also reflecting unrelieved local hypoxia during steroidassociated ON development. Icaritin was able to continuously control \"vascular permeability\" in a dose-dependent manner at week 1 postinduction, as shown by a significant increase in PS\u03c1 from week 1 to week 2 post-induction in the CON group being prevented among the L-ICT and H-ICT group (Figs. 5A, B, D) , and numerous medium-sized disseminated leakage-particle-like structural units (200-400 \u00b5m) (Figs. 7G, H) in the CON group were not shown in the H-ICT group but only occasionally in the L-ICT group at week 2 post-induction (Figs. 7E, F) .\n\nThe semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin exerted a dosedependent effect on inhibition of intravascular thromboses by counteracting hypercoagulation-hypofibrinolysis and extravascular lipid-deposition by counteracting excessive adipogenesis and prominent lipid transport to peripheral tissue, thereby helping to maintain intraosseous vascular integrity, and reduce incidence of steroidassociated ON. Icaritin seemed to act by suppression of up-regulated proliferator-activated receptor-gamma expression to counteract extravascular adipogenesis and protection of endothelium from injury of activated oxidative stress."}
