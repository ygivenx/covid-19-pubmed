{"title": "Clinical Features of COVID-19-Related Liver Damage", "body": "Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the pathogen to cause pneumonia in Wuhan, China , which was temporarily named as 2019-nCoV by WHO. 2, 3 On 11 February 2020, based on the phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, 2019-nCoV was officially named as SARS-CoV-2, 4 and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19 . 5 Evidence has proven that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact , posing a huge challenge on the public health. 6 Up to now, there were more than seventy thousand confirmed cases and two thousand death case in 30 countries around the world. 7 The main manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, dry cough, weakness, and breathing difficulty. Abnormal liver functions were frequently reported extrapulmonary clinical feature and almost one half of patients experienced different degrees of liver function damage. 8, 9 .According to the recent study of single-cell RNAseq , angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)2 was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in bile duct cells. 10 Importantly, recent study confirmed that the cell entry receptor of 2019-nCoV, like SARS-CoV, is ACE2 receptor. 11 All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the bile duct cells and cause the abnormal liver function in these patients. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the bile duct injury related index, was not specific in COVID-19 patients . 8, 9 .A recent pathological finding reported that moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were present in liver biopsy specimens, indicating that the liver injury could be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 12 Currently, however, there is no any clinical research to analyze whether abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients is due to the drugs used or not. Given the high contagious and pathogenic capacities of SARS-CoV-2 and high incidence of liver damage, an analysis with liver function in COVID patients is urgently warranted.\n\nIn this study, we retrospectively investigated the liver function change in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from a single center study in Shanghai, China, and compared the clinical features, medications and length of stay of COVID-19 patients with/without liver damage. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage, evaluate the association between current medications and liver damage, and therefore provide a reference for clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19.\n\n.

The clinical criteria of diagnosis and discharge refer to the standards for \"Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia\" (trial version 6). 13 All cases had a history of related epidemiology, most of them had clinical manifestations, such as fever or respiratory symptoms. All patients were diagnosed after examination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR and chest CT scanning. By February 19, 93 of the 148 cases were discharged from the hospital, and 1 died during this period. The average length of hospitalization of discharged cases was 12 days (6-21 days). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (2019-S047-02, Review date: Jan 13, 2020) and was exempted from the need for informed consent from patients.\n\nThe medical records of 148 patients were collected and analyzed by the research team from the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were acquired by the hospitalization management system.\n\n.

The medications of COVID-19 patients before admission included antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Azithromycin, Cephalosporin), antiviral drugs (Arbidol, Oseltamivir, Acyclovir)and conventional febrifuge (Ibuprofen). There was no statistical difference in prehospital treatment between two groups (Table 3) .\n\nThe number of lymphocytes in abnormal liver function group was significantly lower than that in normal liver function group, as shown in Table 4 . The numbers of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were lower in abnormal liver function group when compared with those in normal liver function group. Moreover, the levels of PCT and CRP were also observed to be increased in abnormal liver function group than in normal liver function group.\n\nWe observed that 41 patients with normal liver function had liver injury around 7 (\u00b13) days after admission, with a probability of 56.16%. During the stay in hospitalization, the patients received treatment with antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Meropenem, Moxifloxacin, Cephalosporin), interferon and antiviral drugs (Arbidol, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Dnrunavir). There was no statistical difference in hospital treatment between two groups in terms of antibiotics and interferon used in clinical practice. However, we found that there are more patients with abnormal liver function (56.1%) received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with those with normal liver function (25%) (p = 0.009)( Table 5) .\n\n.

Of note, we found that liver function related index before admission had little effect on the hospital stays of COVID19 patients, while the emerging abnormal liver function after admission did prolong a length of stay (Table   6 ).\n\n.

There are even 5 cases of asymptomatic patients in our study, who were actively hospitalized after close contact with the confirmed cases, and then diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a case reported an asymptomatic carrier without any symptoms and signs transmitted the coronavirus to other five persons. 17 Undoubtably, the asymptomatic patients increase the challenge in the prevention of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we should pay close attention to asymptomatic high-risk groups in clinical diagnosis and treatment. 15 Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanism whereby the asymptomatic patients could exist.\n\nNotably, more than half of patients at admission are presented with abnormal liver functions, which seems to have nothing to do with clinical medication. The proportion of increased ALP was the lowest in patients with liver function injury, and the incidence of increased ALP was also the lowest in all patients admitted to hospital, which is similar to the previous studies. 18 Although ACE2 is highly expressed in bile duct cells , recent works suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause an increase in the marker of bile duct injury, ALP exclusively. 10 Relatively speaking, elevated markers of .

Approximately, one in five patients in this study have elevated ALT or AST, which is slightly lower than that in the earlier studies. 3, 16 Moverever, the levels of elevated ALT and AST are generally not high on admission in our study, indicating the COVID-19 -related liver injury is not serious at the initial stage of infection. These findings are consistent with previous research. 8 Studies have found liver damage is more common in patients with severe pneumonia, which is suspected to be associated with inflammatory factor storm. 3, 8 But it cannot explain the fact that there is also liver damage in mild patients. There are many similarities between the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. By literature review, we refer to the autopsy analysis about patients died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 19, 20 In addition to lungs and immune systems severe damage, fatty degeneration, central lobular necrosis and SARS-CoV were detected in the liver. So there is a reason to believe that SARS-CoV-2 can also attack the human liver.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting that LDH is the most frequently increased in this study (35.1%). According to the existing studies, the proportion of increased LDH in cases from Wuhan is 39.9% -76%. 3, 8, 16 According to previous research, the levels of LDH in the patients with SARS and MERS are also increased. 21, 22 The level of LDH in the patients is an independent risk factor for SARS. 21 Due to the poor specificity, LDH may be related to lung, skeletal muscle and myocardium , so it does not fully represent the liver function. 23 We compared the relationship between LDH level and heat degree in patients, and found that the LDH in patients with moderate/high fever significantly higher in comparation with that in patients with low fever and normal temperature (data .

Whether LDH can be used as an early alarm factor for COVID-19 or not needs further analysis.\n\nAlthough there are also serious liver injuries in some reports , the concomitant chronic liver diseases couldn't be excluded. 16 There were 8 cases with chronic hepatitis B or C in our study, but there was no statistical difference in the proportion of chronic liver disease between the abnormal liver function group and normal liver function group.\n\nBecause of no effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 available, symptomatic and supportive treatments are rather crucial. Many patients were applied with other antiviral and antipyretic drugs. However, both antiviral drugs and acetaminophen have adverse reactions, such as liver function injury. [24] [25] [26] Previous studies have not further analyzed whether these patients with abnormal liver function are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or by the drugs used. In this study, the drugs used by patients before admission are mainly antibacterial drugs (including moxifloxacin, cephalosporins), antiviral drugs (abidol, oseltamivir, acyclovir), and antipyretic drugs with acetaminophen. We analyzed the prehospital medications of the two groups and found that there is no statistical difference between the two groups. Therefore, we speculated that the liver function damage of COVID-19 patients is closely related to virus infection. In addition, the proportion of male patients with liver damage was large, and the specific mechanism was unclear. The body temperature of patients with liver damage was significantly higher than that of the control group, which may be related to the immune response after virus infection.\n\nPatients with liver damage had higher inflammatory indexes, such as elevated CRP and .

Comparing with the medication of these patients during hospitalization, our study found that the application rate of lopinavir/ritonavir in liver damage group was significantly higher than that in patients with normal liver function. What's more, the length of stay in patients with liver damage after admission was significantly longer than that in cases with normal liver function. In view of another article on antiviral effect in our hospital, lopinavir/ritonavir has no effect on the negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. 28 For this reason, we tend not to recommend lopinavir/ritonavir as a common clinical treatment drug for COVID-19, even in mild patients with normal liver function. More studies are needed to further evaluate the risks and benefits that lopinavir/ritonavir may bring.\n\nHowever, there are also deficiencies in our research. This study was retrospective, and some cases had incomplete documentation for the history of present illness. Moreover, all data were collected from a single center at a certain timepoint. So the sample size is relatively limited. Furthermore, the direct evidence of abnormal liver function caused by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been verified. Further studies are needed to corroborate the pathogenic mechanism.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the first time to analyze the clinical features of COVID-19-related .

SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage, and the emerging liver injury after admission has some connection with the application of lopinavir/ritonavir and the extend length of hospital stay. The finding is expected to provide some references for the clinical treatment of the current epidemic. .
