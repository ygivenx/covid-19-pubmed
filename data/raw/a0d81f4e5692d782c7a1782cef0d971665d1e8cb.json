{"title": "Cloning the Structure Genes and Expression the N Gene of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus DX *", "body": "several subgenomic mRNAs for the production of structure and non-structure proteins (6, 18) . (1, 5) . The M and sM proteins are essential for viral envelope formation and release, the M protein also can stimulate the production of interferon (IFN) (1, 7) . The N protein participates in transcription of the viral genome, the formation of the viral core, and packaging of viral RNA. In the early stage of PEDV infection, the pig produces high levels of antibodies against the protein N. Since the N protein is highly conservative in the coronaviruses, it has a good response and immunogenicity, so it is the best candidate protein for early diagnosis reagents and vaccine development.\n\nAlthough some nucleotides sequences of PEDV isolated from China has been reported, the data of DX structure genes are useful for furthering the study of the molecular biology of PEDV strains that are prevalent in China, especially in the north-west. In this study, the structure genes have been cloned and the N protein has been expressed.\n\nThe PEDV DX strain was collected from the feces of piglets suffering from severe diarrhea in Gansu north-west China. Total RNA was isolated from purified feces samples and extracted using a RNA extraction kit (Qiagene, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe RT-PCR amplifications were carried out using five primer sets (Table 1) and an RT-PCR amplification Kit (Toyobo, Japan). The products were ligated with the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and transformed into the competent E. coli JM109. Positive clones were sequenced by the TaKaRa Biotechology (Dalian) Co.Ltd.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was performed for the amino acids sequence of PEEV DX strain structure genes and compared to the PEDV reference strains retrieved from GenBank. The sequence data were aligned using \n\nTwo PCR primers of PEDV N, which contain specific restriction enzyme digestion sites depending on the multiple cloning sites contained in the expression vector pET30a were used. The sense primer \n\nThe positive recombinant transformant was grown in LB media containing 100\u03bcg/mL Amp while shaking at 220 r/min at 37\u2103 and then induced with IPTG.\n\nCells were harvested by centrifugation at 12000 r/min for 1 min. Total cellular pellets were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.\n\nUsing RT-PCR, two overlapping products of the S gene of approximately 4.2 kb were amplified ( Fig.1 \n\nTo analyze the phylogenetic relationships between DX and other PEDV strains isolated in various parts of the world, we constructed 3 neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees (Fig.2, Fig.3, Fig.4) \n\nThe recombinant plasmid pET30-PN was digested with Ncol I and BamH I producing two fragments of 5 400bp (pET30a) and 1 400bp. PCR identification confirmed the presence of the 1 400bp fragment (Fig.6) .\n\nTo obtain the expressed recombinant protein, the time course expression of recombinant plasmid pET-PN was induced by IPTG with ranging from 0.5-1 mmol/L at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h respectively. SDS-PAGE revealed that the best condition was the IPTG with 1 mmol/L at 6 h. The expressed proteins had a molecular weight of 55kDa as expected (Fig.7) . Western blot showed the The N protein is a RNA binding protein, it contains basic amino acids such as Arginine and lysine and shows a high degree of alkalinity, it is also the only phosphorylated structure protein in the coronavirus.\n\nThe Serine residue is a potential phosphorylation site\n\n(2). TheDX N protein contained 37 Arginine, 33\n\nlysine and 36 Serine. The N protein is the most highly expressed protein in coronavirus infected cells and is about 45kDa-60kDa (12) . The PEDV N protein is about 49kDa-58kDa in different expression systems\n\n(2). In this study, an N protein of about 50kDa (the expressed vector was abou 5kDa) was obtained using the E. coli system, the result is consistent with other E.\n\ncoli expression system, although there are differences in the observed weights (16) . Western blot results showed the expressed N protein reacted with the antibodies, which indicated that the expressed N protein has the biological activity. Our results provide a basis for further development of a diagnosis method."}
