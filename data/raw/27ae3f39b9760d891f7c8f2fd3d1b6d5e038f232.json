{"title": "Comparison data of a two-target real-time PCR assay with and without an internal control in detecting Salmonella enterica from cattle lymph nodes", "body": "A real-time PCR (qPCR) assay targeting on invA and pagC genes was developed and validated for the detection and quantification of Salmonella enterica strains (Bai et al., 2018) [1] . A host gene, normally an endogenous housekeeping gene (Beer-Davidson et al., 2018; Poon et al., 2004) [2, 3] , or an irrelevant exogenous gene (Cheng et al., 2015; Sedlak et al., 2014) [4, 5] has been widely used as an internal control to monitor nucleic acid extraction efficiencies and potential PCR inhibitions in PCR-based detection assays. An endogenous internal control designed based on the 18S rRNA gene was used in the above-mentioned qPCR assay. This 18S rRNA internal control amplifies the target gene in multiple species including bovine, swine, ovine, caprine and cervine. Data was generated by the duplex qPCR assay on 138 enriched cattle lymph node samples without the internal control, and compared with data on the same samples tested by the triplex qPCR assay that has Similar threshold cycle (Ct) data were generated with and without the use of the 18S rRNA gene as internal control.\n\nAlthough an internal control is strongly recommended for real-time PCR assays in diagnostic settings, it may be optional to use for certain research projects like the one reported here.\n\nReal-time PCR (qPCR) test data on 138 culture-enriched cattle lymph node samples for Salmonella enterica detections is shown in Table 1 . Data were generated by: 1) A duplex qPCR assay using invA and pagC genes; and 2) A triplex qPCR assay using invA, pagC, and 18S rRNA gene as an internal control. The Ct differences between the duplex and triplex qPCR assays are also presented in the last two columns in Table 1 .\n\nA total of 647 subiliac lymph nodes were collected from cattle procured from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and South Dakota [6] and transported in cold storage to the Kansas State University for processing within 24 h. Each lymph node was manually trimmed to remove fat and fascia tissues. Trimmed lymph nodes were surface sterilized by a 5 sec submersion in boiling water, placed in a sterile bag, then manually pulverized with a rubber mallet. Eighty milliliters of TSB was added to each bag and sterilized lymph nodes were then homogenized for 30 s in a Stomacher 80 Biomaster (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) prior to culture-enrichment. The enrichment procedure has been described [6, 7] . Briefly, the homogenate was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 h then at 42\u00b0C for 12 h.

One hundred microliters of PBS was added to the final immunomagnetic separation step. The bead suspension was then transferred into 3 mL RV broth and incubated at 42\u00b0C for 18-20 h. One hundred microliters of enriched homogenate was streaked onto HE agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Six dark-colored colonies with morphology consistent with Salmonella were re-streaked onto BAPs and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18-20 h. The resulting cultures was used for DNA extraction by boiling 1 ml of culture for 10 min and centrifuging at 9300 g for 5 min; the supernatant was used as template for the qPCR reactions with the duplex qPCR assay using both invA and pagC genes as molecular targets. Endogenous housekeeping genes [2, 3] , or irrelevant exogenous gene [4, 5] have been widely used as internal controls to monitor nucleic acid extraction efficiencies and potential PCR inhibitions in PCR-based detection assays. We have selected an endogenous housekeepig gene, 18S rRNA gene, as internal control in this study. Randomly selected 138 duplex qPCR-positive samples were proceed with the triplex qPCR assay using the same molecular targets, and with an 18S rRNA gene as internal control [1] . Comparison data using the duplex and triplex assays is presented in Table 1 .\n\nSupplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at http://dx.doi. org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.04.051.
