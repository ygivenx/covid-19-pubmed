{"title": "De Novo Design\nof \u03b1-Helical Lipopeptides\nTargeting Viral Fusion Proteins: A Promising Strategy for Relatively\nBroad-Spectrum Antiviral Drug Discovery", "body": "The traditional \u201cone\nbug\u2013one drug\u201d paradigm\nfor the development of antiviral therapeutics has yielded laudable\nsuccesses to control the emerging and re-emerging threat of viral\npathogens.1\u22123 However, a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that\naffords timely and effective pharmacological agents that can respond\nto an increasing diversity of highly pathogenic viruses remains elusive.4 A commonality in the viral life cycle, i.e.,\nthe fusion of enveloped viruses with the host cell membrane, represents\na viable target for the discovery of broad-spectrum therapeutics.5,6 In this fusion process, the triggered formation of a leucine zipper-like\n\u03b1-helical hexamer,7,8 either at the cell surface\nor within some later endosomes, is the typical structural feature\nof class I fusion glycoproteins used by enveloped viruses such as\nhuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),9\u221211 influenza A\nviruses (IAVs),12 Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),13 and\nEbola virus (EboV)14 (Figure 1A).\n\nDuring the coiled-coil six-helix\nbundle (6HB) assembly, three N-terminal\nheptad repeat (NHR) regions of viral fusion proteins initially form\na central trimeric helix scaffold that becomes temporarily exposed,\ncreating a metastable prehairpin conformation; three C-terminal heptad\nrepeat (CHR) regions then pack onto the periphery of the trimeric\nNHR inner core in an antiparallel orientation.15 Bioactive peptides derived from the CHR motif of class\nI viral fusion proteins, designated as C-peptides, act as decoy \u03b1-helices\nand are able to bind to their corresponding NHR helical trimers to\nform a heterologous nonfunctional 6HB structure in a virus-specific\nmanner, thereby antagonizing the refolding of the endogenous CHR region\nand competitively inhibiting virus\u2013host cell membrane fusion.16 In 1993, Jiang and colleagues discovered a highly\npotent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory peptides derived from the CHR region\nof HIV-1 gp41, designated SJ-2176; in 1994, Wild et al. reported another\nCHR-peptide, DP-178 (also named T20 later).17,18 T20 (brand name, Fuzeon; generic name, enfuvirtide) was finally\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 for clinical\nuse as the first fusion inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug. The discovery\nof these anti-HIV peptides spurred the identification of antiviral\npeptides against other viruses that utilize class I fusion proteins,\nincluding the recently identified MERS-CoV. After the emergence of\nMERS-CoV infection, Gao\u2019s group and Jiang\u2019s group independently\nsolved the crystal structure of MERS-CoV\u2019s 6HB fusion core.13,19 On the basis of the 6HB structure, Jiang\u2019s group reported\nthe highly effective anti-MERS-CoV peptide HR2PM2. Most recently,\nwe identified a hydrocarbon-stapled short \u03b1-helical peptide\nthat could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the low micromolar level.20 Considering the universal 6HB fusion mechanism\nemployed by class I enveloped viruses, inhibition of NHR/CHR coiled\ncoil-mediated interactions has significant potential for the development\nof broad-spectrum therapeutic interventions.\n\nCoiled coils are\nubiquitous protein folding motifs found in nature,\nand they orchestrate the association of numerous complexes implicated\nin biological processes.21 A wealth of\nstructural information has provided a relatively detailed understanding\nof the sequence-to-structure relationships for this supercoiled scaffold.22 In structural terms, amphipathic \u03b1-helices\nencode canonical coiled coils via burial of their hydrophobic faces\nto drive the multimerization of constituent helices.23 The hexameric coiled-coil assembly present in HIV-1 is\narguably the best characterized class I viral fusion apparatus,24,25 in which the C-helices are divided into a hydrophobic buried binding\ninterface and hydrophilic solvent-accessible sites (Figure 1B). Structural analysis has\ndemonstrated that a high variability in the primary sequence of CHR\nmotifs within the HIV-1 6HB is allowed as long as the driving force\nfor coiled-coil assembly, i.e., amphiphilic characteristics of the\nindividual helices, is maintained.26,27 Accordingly,\n\u03b1-helix-constrained HIV-neutralizing C-peptides, engineered\nby strategies such as salt bridges,28,29 helix-favoring\namino acids,30 and hydrophobic mutations\nin buried residues,31 can significantly\nenhance the bundle stability compared with their corresponding wild-type\nligands despite the substitution of approximately half of the parent\nresidues.\n\nIncorporation of an alkyl hydrocarbon tail onto a\npeptide represents\nanother promising \u03b1-helix-promoting technique. Recent studies\non HIV-1 fusion inhibitors have revealed that lipid-conjugated C-peptides\nhave a greatly increased \u03b1-helicity and NHR-binding capability.32,33 Moreover, for viruses that fuse at the cell surface, lipidation\nalso provides the critical advantage of endowing C-peptides with the\nmembrane-tropic feature. Enrichment of the local concentration of\nhelical peptides at the membrane level further facilitates their assembly\nwith the intermediate-stage NHR-helical trimers.34 For intracellularly fusing viruses, lipidation allows antiviral\npeptides to internalize along with viruses into host cells, thereby\narresting 6HB formation in the endosomes.12\n\nTaking advantage of the adjustability and tractability of\n\u03b1-helix-mediated\ninteractions in the 6HB core structure typical of class I viral fusion\nproteins, we herein describe a rational approach for the design of\nrelatively broad-spectrum inhibitors against infection of MERS-CoV,\nof the family Coronaviridae, that primarily employs\nthe cell surface pathway,13,35 and IAV, of the family Orthomyxoviridae, that uses the endocytic route,6,7 based on replicating the topography of CHR helices by using de novo\ndesigned amphiphilic \u03b1-helical peptides with the addition of\na fatty acid tail.\n\nIn terms of the sequence,\ncoiled-coil domains share a characteristic\nheptad repeat, usually denoted as a-b-c-d-e-f-g, with hydrophobic\nresidues at the core a-d positions\nand hydrophilic residues at the other sites.20,21 In the helix wheel model of the NHR/CHR 6HB structure, the residues\nat the a-d-e sites\non the C-helices face the inner N-helices and are largely buried;\nthese residues are primarily responsible for CHR\u2013NHR interaction.\nMeanwhile, the residues at the b-c-f-g sites are located away from\nthe interaction center. Therefore, we adopted the heptad repeat approach\nto design amphiphilic peptides based on the sequence Ac-(XaEbEcXdZeKfKg)5-\u03b2Ala-K(C16)-NH2. In the\nrepeated heptapeptide sequence, we placed hydrophobic residues at\nthe \u201cX\u201d positions and polar/charged residues at the\n\u201cZ\u201d positions. With the foregrounda-d and e positions of\nthe model sequence set, the backgroundb-c-f-g sites were\npopulated with combinations of glutamic acid and lysine to form double\nGlu-Lys intrastrand salt bridges at the i to i + 4 positions to favor the overall \u03b1-helicity and\nsolubility of the heptad repeat peptides. Seminal work investigating\nthe structural characterization of coiled coils suggests that the\nstability of helical bundles is directly proportional to the number\nof heptad repeats. Combined with the optimal peptide length paradigm\nestablished by current peptidic fusion inhibitors, the designed sequence\nwas made with five heptads, i.e., 35 residues, and an \u03b2-alanine\n(\u03b2Ala) was additionally appended outside of the heptad repeat\nregion in order to link an extra lysine residue,36,37 which was capped by a palmitoyl group (C16), thus providing its\nmembrane-tropic feature and favorable safety profile for drug development\n(Figure 1C).\n\nInitially, we aimed to establish combinations\nof foregrounda-d residues in the heptad repeat\nmoiety. As previous experiments have indicated that alanine residues\nare strongly biased toward helix formation in peptides,38 the design of the novel lipopeptide began with\nthe peptide named AAS (Table 1), in which hydrophobic alanine residues were placed at the a and d positions of the heptad, and a\nsmall helix-favoring polar residue, i.e., serine, which has been widely\nutilized in protein functional scanning strategies,39 was populated at the e positions. To explore\nthe influence of hydrophobic residue contact at \u03b1-helix-mediated\ncoiled-coil interaction sites on antiviral activity, substitutions\nat the a-d positions of the peptide\nAAS were made with different hydrophobic residues, including Val,\nPhe, Tyr, Leu, and Ile. We used our previously developed MERS-CoV\nS protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion assay to test the biological\nactivity of these peptides.40 As shown\nin Table 1, all of\nthe lipopeptides potently inhibited cell\u2013cell fusion mediated\nby MERS-CoV S protein, with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 0.1 to >10.0 \u03bcM. Of the six lipopeptides\nwe designed, both LLS and IIS were found to be potent MERS-CoV fusion\ninhibitors, with EC50 values of 0.24 and 0.10 \u03bcM,\nrespectively. The possible reasons for this activity include the evolutionary\npreference for Leu and Ile in the heptad positions a-d for viral fusion glycoprotein sequences and the\nsignificance of creating enough hydrophobicity/amphiphilicity to yield\na stable coiled-coil structure.41 Compared\nto LLS, IIS possessed obviously lower cytotoxicity in Huh-7 cells,\nwhich were used as target cells in the cell\u2013cell fusion assay.\nTherefore, in the next round of analogues, we further mutated residues\nat the e position of the heptad of IIS with different\ntypes of polar residues, including cationic Lys, anionic Glu, and\nuncharged Gln, as well as aromatic/heterocyclic amino acids such as\nTyr, Trp, and His, expecting that these optimizations would provide\nfurther improvement in potency and cytotoxicity. Strikingly, Gln-containing\nIIQ and Tyr-containing IIY had EC50 values of 0.11 and\n0.52 \u03bcM, respectively, even reaching the potencies of the MERS-CoV-specific\nfusion inhibitor HR2PM2 peptide.42 In addition,\nboth IIQ and IIY possessed lower cytotoxicity values than the selected\nlead IIS, with a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50)\nvalue of >100 \u03bcM. Subsequently, we tested the inhibitory\nactivity\nof the peptide IIQ on the entry of pseudovirus carrying the wild-type\nMERS-CoV S protein. As shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1, IIQ was effective against MERS-CoV\npseudovirus infection, with an EC50 value of 0.13 \u03bcM;\nthis finding was in close agreement with the cell\u2013cell fusion\nassay results. These data imply that the de novo designed peptides\nthat are nonhomologous with the naturally occurring MERS-CoV S protein\nsequence could effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting\nvirus\u2013host cell membrane fusion. Moreover, we explored the\nstructural properties of these lipopeptides by circular dichroism\n(CD) spectroscopy to determine if their propensities to adopt \u03b1-helical\nstructure were correlated with anti-MERS-CoV activity. The relationships\nbetween the EC50s of lipopeptides and their \u03b1-helical\ncontent are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting\nInformation. We found that the potency was not strictly dependent\non their \u03b1-helicity (r2 = 0.2439),\nsuggesting that other factors, such as solubility and target binding\naffinity and kinetics, may be involved in their biological activity.\nThis phenomena has also been observed in the studies on HIV-1 fusion\ninhibitors, where several C-peptides exhibited no anti-HIV-1 potency\ndespite they have fully \u03b1-helical structure in solution.29,43\n\nThe ongoing threat of the emergence\nof resistant variants that\ndiminish or ablate the effectiveness of the currently available anti-IAV\ndrugs underscores the demand for new antiviral strategies targeting\nother proteins in the influenza virus life cycle.44 Therefore, we employed a cytopathic effect inhibition assay\nto evaluate the inhibition effect of compounds IIS, IIY, and IIQ,\nwhich exhibited promising potency in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection,\nagainst IAVs. Surprisingly, one of the lipopeptides, IIQ, displayed\npotent inhibitory activity toward both strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34\n(H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2), with EC50 values of\n1.73 and 0.70 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 2). Furthermore, none of these peptides displayed\na cytotoxic effect against Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK)\ncells at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. The selective index of\nIIQ was larger than 143, indicating a safe profile for further exploration.\nThe data presented in Table S1 in the Supporting\nInformation show that IIQ was also potent against oseltamivir-resistant\nstrains, including LN/1109 (H1N1) and TJ/15 (H1N1), with EC50 values of 4.36 and 3.03 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas oseltamivir\nwas much less effective (EC50 = 21.7 \u03bcM) against\nLN/1109 (H1N1) and inactive against TJ/15 (H1N1) at concentrations\nup to 100 \u03bcM. In addition, IIQ also exerted remarkable inhibitory\nactivity against B/Lee/40 strain infection with an EC50 value of 1.87 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcM. As expected, MERS-CoV HR2PM2\ndisplayed no inhibition effect against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and\nA/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) infection at the concentration up to 20 \u03bcM.\nThe life cycle of influenza virus is divided into three steps, i.e.,\nvirus entry, viral genome replication, and progeny virion release.45 Currently, several anti-influenza drugs have\nbeen developed for interruption of specific processes in influenza\ninfection. Among them, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) targets neuraminidase\n(NA) protein, thus preventing release of tethered progeny virus from\nits host cells.46 Favipiravir that selectively\ninhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been approved in Japan as\nan inhibitor of influenza virus replication for the treatment of influenza\nvirus infection in 2014.47 We then asked\nif the IIQ peptide acts by inhibiting the entry step of IAV into host\ncells. To address this question, a viral replicon assay and a neuraminidase\ninhibition assay were performed to rule out any effect of IIQ on viral\nreplication and progeny virion release, respectively. In the mini-replicon\nsystem, viral RNA polymerase protein expression plasmids mediate the\nexpression of a reporter genome encoding firefly luciferase. Through\ndetermination of the normalized firefly luminescence/Renilla luminescence ratio, we found that favipiravir\ncould inhibit influenza replicon activity in a dose-dependent manner,\nwith a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 26.2\n\u00b1 3.7 \u03bcM, whereas IIQ and the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir\nexhibited no significant inhibition at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM\n(Figure 2A). As shown\nin Figure 2B,C, neither\nIIQ nor favipiravir was able to disturb cleavage of the substrate\nby neuraminidase from the two IAV strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)\nand A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) in the test range. In contrast, oseltamivir\ncould inhibit neuraminidase of these two viruses, with IC50 values of 1.71 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 nM, respectively.\nTaken together, these results suggest IIQ may affect the entry stage\nof viral life cycle to block virus infection. Moreover, using a time-of-addition\nassay, we found that the viral load at intervals of 0\u201310 h\n(covering the whole life cycle) and 0\u20132 h (covering the entry\nstep) was reduced by approximately 60%, with the addition of 10 \u03bcM\nIIQ, as compared with the PBS control, and no antiviral activity was\nobserved for the remaining three time intervals (2\u20135, 5\u20138,\nand 8\u201310 h). However, favipiravir continued to exert its full\neffect, even at the interval of 5\u20138 h. These results further\nconfirmed that IIQ targets the entry step in the IAV life cycle (Figure 2D\u2013F). Hemagglutination\ninhibition (HI) assay is well-established to determine whether the\nsialic acid-binding site on HA1 subunit acts as potential drug target;\nmeanwhile, hemolysis inhibition assay is commonly used to determine\nwhether the HA2 subunit can be a possible target.48 Thus, an HI assay was first performed to determine the\npotential effect of IIQ peptide on the HA1 subunit sialic acid-binding\nsite. The result showed that no apparent inhibition of influenza virus-induced\naggregation of chicken erythrocytes was observed in the test range,\nindicating IIQ has no effect on the interaction of HA1 subunit with\nits sialic acid receptor (Supporting Information, Figure S3A). Moreover, the hemolysis inhibition assay showed\nthat the lysis of erythrocytes caused by the conformational rearrangements\nof HA2 subunit under acidic condition was decreased compared with\nthe hemolytic effect of virus only (Supporting Information, Figure S3B). The combined results indicate that\nIIQ may bind to the HA2 subunit to interrupt the conformational changes\nin HA2 rather than interacting with HA1 subunit via inhibiting the\nabsorption of viruses into host cells, consistent with our design\nrationale.\n\nAfter identifying that the entry/fusion\nprocess phase of the life\ncycle of MERS-CoV and IAV was the point of interference, we explored\nwhether the IIQ peptide would interact with the corresponding NHR\nregion of viral fusion proteins with a mechanism of action similar\nto virus-specific C-peptides. The first piece of evidence came from\nnative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) of equimolar mixtures\nof IIQ plus synthetic peptides containing the NHR segments of the\nMERS-CoV spike (S) protein S2 subunit, designated as HR1P,13 and the postfusion structure of the H3N2 hemagglutinin\n(HA) HA2 subunit, namely N66,49 respectively.\nThe mixtures of IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 showed new bands at the upper\npositions in the gel, demonstrating that tightly associated complexes\nwere formed (Figure 3A). These findings are consistent with the results obtained from\ncircular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, in which the signal of these\nmixtures was dramatically greater than that of the mathematical sum\nof the corresponding isolated peptides, suggesting induction of a\nlarge \u03b1-helical structure resulting from their interaction (Figure 3B,C).50 Moreover, data from CD analysis indicated that\nthe IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 helical bundles showed strong thermal stability,\nwith melting temperature values of >90 and 83.1 \u00b0C, respectively\n(Figure 3D and Supporting\nInformation, Table S2). In CD analysis,\nN36/C34 6HB,31 which has an available crystal\nstructure and is widely used to represent the HIV-1 fusion core, was\nused as a positive control (Supporting Information, Figure S4). Finally, sedimentation velocity analysis demonstrated\nthe heterogeneous 6HB states of the IIQ/HR1P complex and the IIQ/N66\ncomplex (Supporting Information, Table S3 and Figure S5). Together, these data\nsuggest that the active IIQ peptide does indeed associate with a site\nin the NHR region and forms heterogeneous 6HB structures that interfere\nwith the fusion between virus and target cell membrane.\n\nWe used the palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospholcholine\nlarge unilamellar vesicle (POPC LUV) liposome system to examine the\nability of IIQ to interact with a lipid bilayer by measuring the heat\ngenerated during the peptide\u2013lipid binding in an isothermal\ntitration calorimetry assay.51 As shown\nin Figure 4, a huge\namount of released heat was observed after the titration of POPC LUVs\ninto solutions containing IIQ peptide, with a binding constant of\n1.04 \u00d7 105 M\u20131. In comparison, the\nunconjugated peptide IIQ\u0394, which exhibited no significant inhibitory\nactivity at the concentration up to 40 \u03bcM on both MERS-CoV pseudovirus\nand A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) infection, did not show lipid vesicle\nbinding. These observations indicate that IIQ can bind to a lipid\nbilayer. Although HIV-1-neutralizing CHR peptides provide a classic\nparadigm for the rational design of fusion inhibitors that interfere\nwith the interaction between the heptad-repeat regions of class I\nviral fusion proteins, the development of such drugs with novel modes\nof action against IAV remains a challenge, mainly by the inaccessibility\nof exogenously added C-peptides to the endocytic compartment, where\nfusogenic 6HB formation takes place. Thus, we next appended the fluorescent\nprobe nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) to the N-terminus of IIQ via a \u03b2-alanine\nspacer to generate IIQNBD and monitored its cellular uptake.\nIIQNBD was found to be similar to IIQ in terms of its \u03b1-helicity\nand inhibitory potency against IAV infection, indicating that the\naddition of the fluorophore did not dramatically affect the biophysical/biological\nproperties of IIQ (Supporting Information, Table S4). To demonstrate cellular uptake, MDCK cells treated with\nIIQNBD were observed after incubation for 0.5, 1, and 4\nh by confocal microscopy. The lysotracker probe specifically fluoresces\nin acidic vesicles.52 As shown in Figure 5, MDCK cells exposed\nto IIQNBD for 0.5 h showed that the lipopeptides were distributed\non the periphery of the cell membrane. After 1 h, the accumulation\nof IIQNBD within the MDCK cells was detected in the acidic\nintracellular compartments, colocalized with LysoTracker Red. Moreover,\nafter 4 h, an increasing amount of IIQNBD was internalized\nand colocalized extensively with LysoTracker Red. Taken together,\nthese results suggest that the \u03b1-helical lipopeptide could cross\nthe plasma membrane efficiently via endocytosis and trap IAV fusion\nproteins in their prehairpin intermediate state, thereby blocking\nmembrane fusion.\n\nSubsequently, IIQ peptide was assessed for essential druglike\nproperties,\nincluding water solubility and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties.\nIIQ showed solubility value of 8.87 \u00b1 0.4 mg/mL in pure water.\nThe pharmacokinetic behavior of IIQ was evaluated in rats (Figure 6 and Table 3). Sprague\u2013Dawley rats\nwere injected intravenously with 5 mg/kg of IIQ peptide, and blood\nwas withdrawn after 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8\nh 12 h, and 24 h, respectively (three animals at each time point).\nThe LC/MS/MS method showed satisfactory results for the determination\nof IIQ in rat plasma and was used for the pharmacokinetic study. Inspection\nof the plasma concentration\u2013time profile for IIQ revealed that\nthe mean value of the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) obtained 2 min after dosing was 97.6 \u03bcg/mL\nand the area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve extrapolated\nto the last time point (AUC0\u2013t)\nwas 234.7 (\u03bcg/mL)\u00b7h. The elimination kinetics of IIQ demonstrated\ndurable plasma half-life of 6.6 h, and the concentration of IIQ in\nplasma remained well above the 0.1 \u03bcg/mL limit of quantitation\nof the analytical method at 24 h. Furthermore, IIQ peptide has a low\nrate of clearance of 20.7 mL\u00b7h\u20131\u00b7kg\u20131. Together, the favorable pharmacokinetic of IIQ,\nincluding the efficacious exposure level, the low clearance, and the\nrelatively extended half-life in vivo, suggest IIQ is suitable for\nfurther study as a drug candidate.\n\nTo investigate whether our\nengineered lipopeptides exert broad\nantiviral spectrum beyond Coronaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families, IIQ peptide was further evaluated\nagainst HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-mediated cell\u2013cell\nfusion and Ebola virus (EboV) envelope glycoprotein (GP)-mediated\ncell entry. We found that IIQ inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion\nwith an EC50 of 3.63 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcM and exhibited\nlow cytotoxicity, with CC50 > 100 \u03bcM, on the TZM-b1\ncell that was used for the fusion assay. Encouragingly, IIQ also inhibited\nthe entry of pseudovirus carrying the GP of the EboV Sudan species,\nwith EC50 value of 1.02 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcM. To our knowledge,\nthe formation of a hexameric coiled-coil complex is believed to be\na common element in type I fusion events. However, the fusion rates\nvary significantly between viruses from different families, between\nviruses within a family, and even between isolates of the same species,\nthus leading to the different window periods during which inhibitory\npeptides access to the target fusion protein and thereby impacting\nentry inhibitor efficacy.5 Furthermore,\nthe stability of the corresponding fusogenic 6HB of different type\nI viral fusion proteins was also correlated with the inhibitory potency\nof peptides.7 Therefore, the engineered\nlipopeptides with simple repeating units of the heptad in our study\ncould not be effective against all of the class I viruses entry, but\nfirst provide a proof-of-concept prototype for broad-spectrum antiviral\nagents design. Moreover, these lipopeptides may also be used as lead\ncompounds for further optimization to design inhibitors with a broader\nantiviral spectrum.\n\nOn the basis of common\nfeatures of the fusogenic 6HB structure\nformed between the CHR and NHR regions of the class I viral fusion\nglycoproteins, we report an effective strategy to expedite the development\nof relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Our study reveals that\nthe de novo designed \u03b1-helical lipopeptides, which are nonhomologous\nwith naturally occurring protein sequences, can interact with both\nMERS-CoV and IAV NHR trimeric coiled coils to prevent virus\u2013cell\nmembrane fusion. One of the designed peptides showed a high potency\nagainst MERS-CoV infection and effectively neutralized H1N1 A/Puerto\nRico/8/34 (influenza A group 1), H3N2 A/Hong Kong/8/68 (influenza\nA group 2), and even the influenza B virus (B/Lee/40). The relatively\nbroad-spectrum antiviral peptides were designed based on the secondary\nstructure at the hexameric coiled-coil complex interface. We anticipate\nthat this approach could also be extended to other pathogenic viruses\nwith class I fusion proteins because they undergo fusion catalysis\nin a manner similar to that of MERS-CoV and IAVs.\n\nPeptides\nwere synthesized\nby using standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis techniques with a CS\nBio polypeptide synthesizer. Rink amide resin, with a resin loading\nof 0.44 mmol/g, was selected as the solid support. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), methanol, piperidine, and\nother reagents used in the reaction process were anhydrous reagents\nor dried prior to use. The synthetic steps were as follows: (1) The\nresin was first swelled in a reaction vessel by the addition of 5\nmL of DMF and 5 mL of DCM, followed by stirring for 20 min. (2) The\nFmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine/DMF. The deprotection\nreaction was performed twice; the first reaction was 5 min, and the\nsecond reaction was 2 min. (3) The next amino acid was coupled with\nthe addition of 5 mL of amino acid solution (0.25 M), 5 mL of condensing\nreagents [0.2 M O-benzotriazole-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU)/DMF\nand 0.2 M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)/DMF], and 5 mL of active base\nsolution [0.4 M N,N-diisopropylethylamine\n(DIEA)/DMF] to the reactor; the reaction was stirred at room temperature\nfor 60 min. After completion of the coupling reaction or Fmoc removal,\nthe resin was washed with DMF (5 \u00d7 1 min) and DCM (3 \u00d7 1\nmin). For lipopeptides, the template peptides containing a Dde-protected\nlysine residue at their C-terminus required a special deprotection\nstep (four 3 min washes of 2% hydrazinehydrate in DMF). This enabled\nthe conjugation of a palmityl moiety, which was performed by the addition\nof 3 equiv of palmic acid, 3 equiv of HBTU, and 6 equiv of DIEA in\nDMF to the resin, followed by stirring for 2 h. Conjugation of a fluoride\n[4-fluoro-7- nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)] fluorescent probe to the N-terminus\nof the peptide was performed by the addition of 6 equiv of NBD-Cl\ndissolved in DMF together with 6 equiv of DIEA to the peptide resin,\nfollowed by stirring for 12 h. The peptides were cleaved from the\nresin and deprotected with reagent K, which contained 85% trifluoroacetic\nacid, 5% thioanisole, 5% m-cresol, and 5% water.\nThe carboxyl termini were amidated upon cleavage from the resin, and\nthe amino termini were capped with acetic acid anhydride, except NBD-conjugated\npeptides. All lyophilized crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; Shimadzu preparative\nHPLC system), and the purity of each peptide was confirmed to be \u226595%\nby analytical RP-HPLC (Shimadzu analytical HPLC system). Such information\nis provided in the Supporting Information (Table S5\u2013S6). The molecular weight of the peptides was characterized\nby matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time-of-flight\nmass spectrometry (Autoflex III, Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica,\nMA).\n\nThe target cells were Huh-7 cells expressing the MERS-CoV receptor\ndipeptidyl peptidase 4. The effector cells were 293T/MERS/enhanced\nGFP protein (EGFP) cells.13 The 293T/MERS/EGPF\ncells contained the MERS-CoV S protein gene and the EGFP gene transfected\nwith plasmid. The 293T/EGFP cells expressing only EGFP were employed\nas negative control cells. Huh-7 cells were plated in 96-well plates\n(5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h. Then,\nserially diluted peptide samples were added, followed by the addition\nof 293T/MERS/EGPF cells or 293T/EGFP cells (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well). After coculturing at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, the 293T/MERS/EGFP\ncells and 293T/EGFP cells, either fused or unfused, with Huh-7 cells\nwere counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse\nTi-S).\n\nInhibition\nof MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection was assessed using a previously\ndescribed method.42 Briefly, the serially\ndiluted tested peptides were added to a 96-well plate and incubated\nwith MERS-CoV pseudovirus for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the pseudovirus/peptide\nmixture was added to the Huh-7 cells. Cultures were refed with fresh\nmedium at 12 h postinfection and incubated for an additional 48 h\nat 37 \u00b0C. Fluorescence was determined using a luciferase kit\n(Promega) and an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan).\n\nMadin\u2013Darby\ncanine kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Nunc MicroWell)\nat a density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in Dulbecco\u2019s\nModified Eagle\u2019s Medium/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (DF-12) and\nwere incubated overnight to adhere to the plate.53 A 3-fold dilution series of tested compounds in DF-12 with\ntosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin was\nadded to cells infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934\n(H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) at a final multiplicity of infection\n(MOI) of 0.003 Pfu/cell suspended in DF-12 medium with TPCK-trypsin.\nAfter incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, the antiviral effect of the\ntested compounds was measured using a CellTiter-Glo cell viability\nassay (Promega, USA), as described by the manufacturer. The plates\nwere read by a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices,\nUSA).\n\nBriefly, 100\n\u03bcL of a Huh-7 cell suspension (1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL)\nwere added to each well of a 96-well culture plate. The plate was\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 12 h. Next, 5 \u03bcL\nof serially diluted peptide solution were added. At the same time,\na blank control group without peptide and a positive control group\nwith 5 \u03bcL of 10% Triton X-100 were cultured for 48 h under the\nconditions of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. To each well were added\n10 \u03bcL of Cell Counting Kit 8 solution, and the plate was incubated\nfor an additional 2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined by\na microplate reader.\n\nMDCK cells\nwere seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in DF-12 medium and incubated overnight before a 3-fold\ndilution series of tested compounds in DF-12 medium with TPCK-trypsin\nwas added to the cells. At 72 h after treatment, the cytotoxicity\nwas measured by a CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay (Promega, USA).\nThe 50% cytotoxicity concentration data were fit and determined by\nOrigin 8 software.\n\nHuman embryonic kidney\n293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Nunc MicroWell) at a density\nof 2.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in DF-12 medium and were incubated\novernight. The plasmid encoding the influenza replication complex\ncomponent (NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) and that encoding the luciferase\nreporter (polI-NS-Luc and pRLSV40) were transfected into\nthe cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, USA). At 6 h post-transfection,\nserially diluted oseltamivir or favipiravir or IIQ was added at the\nindicated concentration. After 30 h, the luciferase activities were\nmeasured using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices,\nUSA) and a Dual-Glo luciferase assay kit (Promega, USA), according\nto the standard protocol. The replicon activities were represented\nby the ratio of firefly luciferase activity relative to Renilla luciferase activity. The replicon activity\ninhibition of the tested compounds was calculated using the following\nformula: Inhibition of replicon activity (%) = (experimental sample\nratio \u2013 negative control ratio)/(positive control ratio \u2013\nnegative control ratio) \u00d7 100%. Curve fitting was performed by\nOrigin 8.0 software.\n\nThe\nNA-Star Influenza\nNeuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit (Applied Biosystems,\nUSA) was used to measure the inhibition of neuraminidase activity\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Neuraminidase\nfrom influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) and neuraminidase from influenza\nA/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus were used for this assay. The chemiluminescent\nsignal intensity of the assay plate was measured immediately after\naccelerator injection, and the read time was set to 1 s. The inhibitory\nactivity of oseltamivir or favipiravir or IIQ was calculated using\nthe following formula: inhibitory activity (%) = (fluorescence of\nvirus control \u2013 fluorescence of sample)/(fluorescence of virus\ncontrol \u2013 fluorescence of substrate control) \u00d7 100%. Curve\nfitting and IC50 calculation were accomplished by Origin\n8.0 software.\n\nMDCK cells were seeded in a 12-well\nplate at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells/well and incubated\novernight. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) prior to virus (MOI of 0.05 PFU/mL) adsorption at 4 \u00b0C\nfor 60 min. After adsorption, the cells were washed with PBS, treated\nwith favipiravir or IIQ at different time intervals (0\u201310 h,\n0\u20132 h, 2\u20135 h, 5\u20138 h, 8\u201310 h postinfection,\nrespectively), harvested, and then applied to qPCR for viral load\nanalysis. Cells were continuously cultured in fresh medium after removal\nof test compounds at 37 \u00b0C until 10 h postinfection, and then\nviral load was analyzed. Total RNA of the cell samples was extracted\nusing an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Absolute RT-qPCR was performed\nusing the ABI Step One Plus platform by using a One-Step PrimeScript\nRT-PCR Kit (Takara). All samples were run in triplicate. The details\nof the primers, probe sequences, and reaction system can be found\nin the Supporting Information. The mRNA\nexpression profiles at different time intervals of IIQ or favipiravir\nor PBS treatment were analyzed, and the mRNA expression profiles under\nIIQ or favipiravir treatment were presented relative to the PBS control.\nStatistical significance of the data was determined by MANOVA method\nusing SPSS 20.0 software.\n\nCD spectra were\nacquired on a MOS-450 system (BioLogic, Claix, France) with the following\nparameters: bandwidth, 4.0 nm; resolution, 0.1 nm; path length, 0.1\ncm; response time, 4.0 s; and scanning speed, 50 nm/min. HR1P was\nincubated with IIQ at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min in 10 mM phosphate buffer\n(pH 7.4). N66 was incubated with IIQ at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min in 10\nmM sodium acetate buffer (containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and 150\nmM sodium chloride, pH 5.0). All samples were prepared with the buffer\nsolution at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and cooled to 25\n\u00b0C for measurement. The CD data were presented as the mean residue\nellipticity. The \u03b1-helical content for these peptides was calculated\nby assuming that 100% helicity corresponds to \u221233000 degrees\ncm2 dmol\u20131. For the thermal unfolding\nexperiments, the CD absorbance was monitored at 222 nm with the temperature\nfor the peptide solutions ranging from 10 to 90 \u00b0C at a scan\nspeed of 2 \u00b0C/min. Samples at pH 5.0 contained 10 \u03bcM peptide\nin 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (containing 10 mM sodium phosphate\nand 150 mM sodium chloride). Samples at pH 7.4 contained 10 \u03bcM\npeptide in 10 mM phosphate buffer.\n\nAn equimolar\nmixture of IIQ and HR1P in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated\nat 25 \u00b0C for 30 min (final concentration of each peptide: 150\n\u03bcM). After the addition of 2\u00d7 \u03b2-alanine\u2013formic\nacid native sample buffer to samples at a ratio of 1:1, all samples\nwere loaded on a 15% \u03b2-alanine\u2013formic acid gel with a\n\u03b2-alanine\u2013formic acid running buffer (pH 3.4). After\nsample loading, the samples were concentrated at a constant voltage\nof 90 V. When the samples reached the boundary of the two gels, the\nvoltage was raised to 150 V, and the samples were electrophoresed\nfor 2.5 h until the indicator was within 1\u20132 cm of the leading\nedge. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue R250. An\nequimolar mixture of IIQ and N66 in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (containing\n10 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.0) was incubated\nat 30 \u00b0C for 30 min (final concentration of each peptide: 150\n\u03bcM). After incubation, the solutions were equilibrated at room\ntemperature, and the pH was neutralized by the addition of 200 mM\nTris buffer (pH 8.5). After the addition of 2\u00d7 Tris-glycine native\nsample buffer (Invitrogen, USA) to the samples at a ratio of 1:1,\nall samples were loaded onto a 15% Tris-glycine gel with Tris\u2212glycine\nrunning buffer (pH 8.8). After sample loading, the samples were concentrated\nat a constant voltage of 90 V. When the samples reached the boundary\nof the two gels, the voltage was raised to 150 V and the samples were\nelectrophoresed for 2.5 h until the indicator was within 1\u20132\ncm of the leading edge. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie\nBlue R250.\n\nA Beckman XL-A-type\nultracentrifuge was used for the SVA experiments.

All samples were prepared at a final concentration of 150\n\u03bcM, which was measured by a UV absorption experiment. Data were\ncollected at 280 nm at a rotor speed of 3000 rpm initially and then\n60000 rpm in continuous mode at 25 \u00b0C. The sedimentation coefficient\ndistribution, c(s), was measured, and the molecular\nweight distribution was calculated by SEDFIT software.\n\nITC was performed\nto detect the IIQ and lipid-binding activity, as described previously.51 The solutions were degassed under vacuum prior\nto use. To detect the IIQ and lipid-binding activity, large unilamellar\nvesicles (LUVs) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine\n(POPC) liposomes were used. LUVs of POPC (13 mM) were injected into\nthe cell containing peptide solution (15 \u03bcM, 300 \u03bcL).\nThe experiments used a MicroCal ITC200 system (GE, Alpharetta, GA\nUSA) for titration, with the following experimental parameters: total\ninjection, 20 drops; drop volume, 2 \u03bcL; syringe concentration,\n13 mM; cell concentration, 15 \u03bcM; cell temperature, 25 \u00b0C;\nenergy reference, 3 \u03bcCal/s; titration delay, 60 s; stirring\nspeed, 750 rpm; drop volume, 2 \u03bcL; titration time, 4 s; two-drop\ninterval, 120 s; data collection interval, 5 s.

LysoTracker solution (1 \u03bcL,\n1 mM) was added to 10 mL of growth medium to obtain a working solution\nof 100 nM. Cells in a 96-well plate were incubated with 50 \u03bcL\nof 100 nM LysoTracker working solution for 1.5 h, and then they were\nwashed twice with PBS. DF-12 medium without phenol red containing\n5 \u03bcM IIQNBD was added to the cells (time point of\n0 h), and then the cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. At time points of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h, the\ncells were scanned with the Operetta confocal imaging system (provided\nby PerkinElmer) with a 20\u00d7 objective lens.
