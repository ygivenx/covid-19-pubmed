{"title": "Adaptive immune cells temper initial innate responses NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "MHV-A59 is an RNA virus that can target TLR3, and RNA virus-related poly(I:C) is a noninfectious ligand for TLR3 (ref. 7) . To analyze susceptibility to TLR3 stimulation independent of infectious particles, we used the poly(I:C) compound to ensure that both wildtype and immunocompromised mice were exposed to similar levels of TLR3 stimulation. Notably, all nude mice rapidly died in 12-24 h after receiving a sublethal dose of poly(I:C) (Fig. 2a) . As seen in MHV-A59 infection, various proinflammatory cytokine levels were much higher in nude mice than wild-type mice at 2 and 6 h after treatment ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary  Fig. 3a) . It is likely that this rapid death of the mice could be attributable to cytokine storm, similar to that caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or superantigens [8] [9] [10] . To study whether other immunocompromised mice have similar sensitivity to poly(I:C), we used Rag-1 knockout mice, which lack functional lymphocytes. Like nude mice, Rag-1 knockout mice also showed hypersensitivity to poly(I:C) and died within 12-24 h after treatment with a sublethal dose of the compound (Fig. 2c) . Again, cytokine levels were much higher in the Rag-1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). To further determine whether T cells are essential to control the early innate response, we depleted wild-type mice with antibodies to CD4 and CD8 before poly(I:C) treatment, and found that the depleted mice produced more inflammatory cytokines than the control mice (Fig. 2e) . To assess whether T cells are sufficient to control the overzealous cytokine response, we adoptively transferred lymphocytes to Rag-1 knockout mice, and after 2 d treated them with poly(I:C). The reconstituted mice produced lower levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in 2 h, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in 6 h, than control mice (Fig. 2f) . It is possible that low-grade infection in these immunodeficient mice might cause more activation of innate cells. To examine whether T cells are sufficient to temper the initial cytokine surge of innate cells from the same source, we divided splenocytes from wild-type mice into non-T and T cell populations. Non-T cells in culture responded vigorously to MHV-A59 or poly(I:C) to produce high levels of cytokines, whereas T cells did not. Notably, addition of T cells to non-T cells efficiently prevented this cytokine surge ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This suggests that constant monitoring by T cells is required to temper the innate response. To further test which subset of T cells is more important, we separated T cells into CD4 + and CD8 + populations. When either population of T cells was mixed with non-T cells, cytokine production was reduced (Fig. 3b ).\n\nTo study whether T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement by specific antigen is required, we used unprimed T cells from OTI (CD8 + T cells for ovalbumin (OVA)) or OTII (CD4 + T cells for OVA) mice (Fig. 3c) . Either cellular population could control the cytokine surge, suggesting that the tempering of the innate response is likely to be antigen independent. Because cell-cell contact could still be important in this process, we used a Transwell system, with non-T cells stimulated with poly(I:C) in the lower well and T cells in the upper well, and found that the inhibitory effect was greatly reduced (Fig. 3d) . Therefore, T cell-mediated inhibition of the innate response is dependent on cell-cell contact. To determine whether contact-dependent functions of T cells are mediated by TCR-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recognition, CD4 + cells were added into non-T cells from MHC class II knockout mice and the cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) overnight. These class II-deficient non-T cells were only weakly inhibited by CD4 + T cells, whereas CD4 + T cells from the same source robustly inhibited wild-type non-T cells ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The impaired inhibition of class IIdeficient non-T cells by CD4 + cells is consistent with the similarly weak inhibition seen in the Transwell study. Therefore, the inhibition by T cells is mainly mediated by cell-cell contact and is MHC dependent.\n\nThere is increasing evidence implicating regulatory T cells (Treg) in the regulation not only of other T cells, but also of innate cells 11,12 . To study whether natural Treg (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ) are essential for the inhibition, we added CD25 + or CD25 \u2212 T cells into non-T cells (Fig. 3e) . The Treg-depleted T cell population still efficiently inhibited the cytokine surge, much as the whole population of T cells did. Next, we tested the effect of depleting Foxp3 + cells by using FoxP3(GFP) knock-in mice 13 , whose Foxp3 + cells have bright green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence and can be readily removed by sorting. We isolated GFP-negative (non-Treg) T cells and GFP-positive (Treg) T cells from the FoxP3(GFP) knockin mice and found that both populations were capable of inhibiting innate responses (Fig. 3f) . It is conceivable that a large number of T cells is needed to contend with the vast number of innate cells inside and outside lymphoid tissues, and both naive and regulatory T cells might be required to render efficient suppression at all times.\n\nCross-talk between innate cells, such as dendritic cells and NK cells, could be an important component in amplification of the innate response 14-18 . To further refine our understanding of the cellular mechanism of T cell mediated inhibition of the innate response, we stimulated innate cells with poly(I:C) and analyzed cytokine production by NK1.1 + , CD11b + or CD11c + cells, with or without T cells. The presence of co-cultured T cells led to a decrease in TNF production by CD11b + or CD11c + cells and decreased IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells after poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 4a) . To determine which cells are sufficient to respond to poly(I:C), we further separated non-T cells into CD11b + and NK 1.1 + cell populations and stimulated them with poly(I:C). Upon direct stimulation, CD11b + cells produced TNF, but NK cells alone did not produce IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, the addition of NK cells to the CD11b + culture enhanced TNF production, suggesting that once NK cells are activated, they can in turn further activate CD11b + cells in a positive feedback loop. Under these conditions, the addition of T cells attenuated the production of TNF and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4b) . Therefore, it is likely that poly(I:C) stimulates CD11b + and CD11c + cells, which subsequently stimulate NK cells; T cells primarily inhibit antigen-presenting cells, which then block the positive loop of NK-cell activation.\n\nTo determine which cytokine is essential for poly(I:C)-mediated death, we treated nude or Rag-1 knockout mice with TNF receptor-human immunoglobulin (TNFR-hIg) or antibody to IFN-\u03b3 (anti-IFN-\u03b3) before poly(I:C) injection to neutralize TNF and IFN-\u03b3, respectively. TNF seems to be more essential for cytokine-induced death, as TNFR-hIg treatment rescued these mice, whereas anti-IFN-\u03b3 did not protect them (Fig. 4c-e and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Because NK cells can enhance TNF production by innate cells, we sought to determine the necessity of NK cells in the poly(I:C) response. Rag-1 knockout mice were treated with anti-NK1.1 or anti-asialo-GM-1 antibodies before poly(I:C) injection. After NK-cell depletion, the survival rate of Rag-1 knockout mice was increased to 72%, and their levels of proinflammatory cytokines were corresponding lower (Fig. 4f,g) . TNF and NK cells seem to have essential roles in poly(I:C)-induced sudden death of Rag-1 knockout mice. To test whether T cells also inhibit other TLR-mediated stimulation on innate cells, we stimulated non-T cells with LPS, a potent stimulator of TLR4, and determined their cytokine levels. Cytokine production by non-T cells was also controlled by addition of T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7) . Therefore, T cells control innate cells under various conditions.\n\nTo test whether human T cells could also inhibit TNF production of human non-T cells stimulated by poly(I:C) and LPS in vitro, we stimulated non-T cells with poly(I:C) or LPS for 30 min. After washing them with PBS, we cocultured these innate cells with or without pan-T cells, CD45RO + T cells or CD45RO \u2212 T cells for 20 h. TNF production was reproducibly suppressed by naive T cells from various healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. 8) . Therefore, T cell-mediated inhibition of the innate response may be important for the pathogenesis of acute infection-a finding that suggests a potentially new treatment for human diseases.\n\nContrary to the principle that lymphocytes might provide positive reinforcement to the ongoing innate response 19 , our study implicates lymphocytes as negative regulators in the very early response to acute infection. The unrestrained innate immune response itself, owing to the lack of supervision by T cells, can be the direct cause of death from acute infection. In addition to natural regulatory T cells, large numbers of naive T cells might be needed to efficiently temper the deadly TLR response at the initial phase of infection. These studies confirm our hypothesis that the adaptive immune system suppresses the innate system in the early phase of viral and nonviral challenges and that lack of T cells might result in excessive innate responses to TLR stimulation. The concept of an unleashed innate response in the absence of adaptive modulation may also lead to new diagnosis and treatment for individuals with congenital or acquired immune deficiency.\n\nBALB/c mice and nude mice of BALB/c background were purchased from Vital River, and C57BL/6 Rag-1 knockout mice, C57BL/6J and MHC class II knockout mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. FoxP3 (GFP) knock-in mice were a gift (see Acknowledgments). Animal care and experiments were performed in accordance with institutional and US National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the animal use committee of the University of Chicago. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects for the use of human blood samples.\n\nMHV-A59 virus and cell line were gifts (see Acknowledgments). Mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 4 \u00d7 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) live virus. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in 17Cl-1 cells.\n\nWild-type BALB/c mice and nude mice were injected i.p. with 700 \u03bcg poly(I:C) and C57BL6 and Rag-1 knockout mice were injected i.p. with 400 \u03bcg poly(I:C) (InvivoGen). Serum was collected at indicated time after injection. Two groups of nude or Rag-1 knockout mice were injected i.p. with 300 \u03bcg control hIgG and TNFR-hIg, respectively, 2 d and 2 h before poly (I:C) injection. For depletion of NK cells, anti-NK1.1 or anti-asialo-GM-1 was injected in Rag-1 knockout mice i.p. at day 4 and day 1 before poly(I:C) injection.\n\nNon-T, pan-T, CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells were isolated by MACS (Miltenyi Biotec). To deplete CD25 + T cells, the isolated pan-T cells were negatively selected after ligation with anti-CD25phycoerythrin and anti-phycoerythrin microbeads. Pan-T cells were isolated from splenocytes of FoxP3(GFP) knock-in mice and then GFP-negative cells (non-Treg) and GFP-positive cells (Treg) were harvested by usingMoFlow. Splenocytes and lymph node cells were harvested from wild-type C57BL6 mice and were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The suspended cells were harvested and 300 \u00d7 10 6 cells transferred into knockout mice.\n\nSplenocytes or purified cells were stained with B220-fluorescein isothiocyanate (B220-FITC), DX5-biotin, CD11b-biotin, CD4-FITC and CD8-FITC (BD Pharmingen). To stain intracellular IFN-\u03b3 and TNF, non-T cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) in the presence or absence of T cells and Golgi stop (BD Pharmingen) was added after 4 h of culture at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were incubated for 16 h under these condition and then stained with NK1.1allophycocyanin or CD11b and fixed. The fixed, permeabilized cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies to mouse IFN-\u03b3 or TNF. FACS data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Becton Dickinson).\n\nSplenocytes from adult or neonatal mice, or T cell-depleted splenocytes, were stimulated with 50 or 100 \u03bcg/ml poly(I:C), 5 \u00d7 10 5 PFU MHV-A59, or 100 or 500 ng/ml LPS in the presence or absence of different subsets of T cells. After coculture in a 96-well round-bottom plate in MEM medium for 20 h, supernatants were collected for cytokine analysis. A Transwell plate system (Costar; pore size 0.4 \u03bcm) was used to prevent close contact between non-T cells and T cells.\n\nThe amount of cytokines was quantified using the cytometric bead array kit for mouse inflammatory cytokines (CBA; BD Biosciences) on a FACSCalibur cytometer equipped with CellQuestPro and CBA software (Becton Dickinson).\n\nThe Mann-Whitney test (for survival) and Student's t-test (for cytokines) were used.
