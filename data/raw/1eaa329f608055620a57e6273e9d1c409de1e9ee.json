{"title": "Structure of the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1 bound to a ubiquitinylated nucleosome", "body": "The extended family of ATPases related to the yeast Snf2 protein act to alter DNA protein interactions (Flaus et al., 2006; Narlikar et al., 2013) . They act on a diverse range of substrates. For example, while the Mot1 protein acts on complexes between the TATA box binding protein BP and DNA (Wollmann et al., 2011) , the Snf2 protein carries out ATP dependent nucleosome disruption (Cote et al., 1994) . At the heart of all these proteins are paired domains capable of rearranging during the ATP hydrolysis cycle to create a ratchet like motion along DNA in single base increments (Clapier et al., 2017; Gu & Rice, 2010; Velankar et al., 1999) .\n\nThe yeast Chd1 protein is a member of this protein family and acts to organise nucleosomes over coding regions (Gkikopoulos et al., 2011; Ocampo et al., 2016; Pointner et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2000) . Consistent with this Chd1 is known to interact with elongation factors including the Spt4-Spt5 proteins, Paf1 and FACT (Kelley et al., 1999; Krogan et al., 2002; Simic et al., 2003) .The partially redundant functions of Chd1 and Isw1 in organising nucleosomes over coding regions are in turn required to prevent histone exchange and non-coding transcription (Hennig et al., 2012; Radman-Livaja et al., 2012; Smolle et al., 2012) .\n\nIn addition to the positioning of nucleosomes, the distribution of many histone modifications is ordered with respect to promoters (Liu et al., 2005; Mayer et al., 2010) . For example histone H3 K4 methylation is frequently observed at promoters, while histone H3 K79 and K36 trimethylation are detected in coding regions (Kizer et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003; Pokholok et al., 2005) .\n\nHistone H2B is also observed to be ubiquitinylated within coding regions (Fleming et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2005) . Ubiquitinylation of histone H2B at lysine 123 in budding yeast, H2B K120 (H2BK120ub) in mammals, is dependent on the E2 ligase Rad6 (Robzyk et al., 2000) and the E3 ligase Bre1 (Hwang et al., 2003; Wood et al., 2003) and removed by the deubiquitinases Ubp8 and Ubp10 (Bonnet et al., 2014; Schulze et al., 2011; Wyce et al., 2007) . A specific reader of H2BK120ub has not been identified.\n\nHowever, H2BK120ub does assist the histone chaperone FACT in enabling transcription through chromatin (Pavri et al., 2006) , and has been found to be required for methylation of histone H3 K4 and K79 (Sun & Allis, 2002 ). An intriguing aspect of H2BK120ub is that while mutation of the writer enzymes or K120 itself disrupts nucleosome organisation, deletion of the deubiquitinylases increases chromatin organisation (Batta et al., 2011) . One way in which H2BK120 may influence nucleosome organisation is via effects on enzymes responsible for chromatin organisation. Consistent with this H2BK120 increases nucleosome repositioning mediated by Chd1 (Levendosky et al., 2016) .\n\nYeast Chd1 serves as a useful paradigm in that it functions predominantly as a single polypetide. In addition, the catalytic core of the enzyme has been crystallised in association with the adjacent tandem chromodomains (Hauk et al., 2010) . Similarly the C-terminal region of the protein has been crystalized revealing that this region includes SANT and SLIDE domains that comprise the DNA binding domain (DNABD) (Ryan et al., 2011b; Sharma et al., 2011) and are also present in ISWI proteins (Grune et al., 2003) . Chd1 enzyme engages nucleosomes in a conformation in which the SANT and SLIDE domains bind linker DNA, while the ATPase domains engage DNA at super helical location (SHL) 2 (Nodelman et al., 2017; Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) .\n\nHigher resolution structures of both Chd1 (Farnung et al., 2017) and Snf2 (Liu et al., 2017) show that the ATPase domains make contacts with DNA via residues that are conserved in ancestral single stranded ATPases and some unique to Snf2 related ATPases. The binding of the Chd1 DNABD unravels two turns of DNA from the surface of nucleosomes in a nucleotide stimulated reaction (Farnung et al., 2017; Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . Here we report a structure for the yeast Chd1 protein in association with a nucleosome, bearing modifications that are found to occur within coding regions, where Chd1 is known to act. Interestingly, nucleosomal epitopes are observed to be reconfigured specifically on the side of the nucleosome on which DNA is unwrapped. This indicates the potential for changes to nucleosome structure to reconfigure the way in which histone epitopes are presented.\n\nThe structure of Chd1 nucleosome complexes As Chd1 functions on transcribed genes, it is of interest to understand the interplay between Chd1 and histone modifications observed in coding region chromatin. As a result nucleosomes were prepared in which histone H3 K36 was alkylated to mimic trimethylation ( The overall organisation of Chd1 is similar to that observed previously by cryo EM (Farnung et al., 2017; Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) and directed crosslinking (Nodelman et al., 2017) . The ATPase domains are bound at the SHL-2 location. Of the two SHL2 locations within nucleosomes, the bound site is in closest proximity to SANT-SLIDE domain bound linker DNA in physical space, but distal on the unwrapped linear DNA sequence (Figure 1 ). Chd1 predominantly contacts the nucleosome via contacts with DNA, via the DNABD in the linker and ATPase lobes at SHL2, contacts with histones are limited to the histone H3 and H4 N-terminal regions discussed below.\n\nWe previously showed that Chd1 binding results in nucleotide-dependent unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA resulting from the interaction of the DNABD with linker DNA (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . The higher resolution of the current structure shows that precisely two turns of nucleosomal DNA are . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

The extent of DNA unwrapping observed here when Chd1 is bound to nucleosomes flanked by a 14 base pair linker DNA is identical to that observed when Chd1 is bound to the opposite surface of the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence with a 63 base pair linker (Farnung et al., 2017) . As the interaction of histones with the two sides of the 601 positioning sequence differ quite dramatically (Chua et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2009; Levendosky et al., 2016; Ngo et al., 2015) , this suggests that the extent of unwrapping is dominated by the properties of Chd1 rather than the affinity of DNA for the octamer. The path of this unwrapped DNA is oriented away from the plane of the wrapped DNA gyre and is kinked at the location where contacts are made with the SANT-SLIDE domains ( Figure 1 ). Other than DNA unwrapping we do not detect additional changes in the organisation of DNA on Chd1 bound nucleosomes at this resolution.\n\nThe orientation of the DNABD is critical in determining the extent of DNA unwrapping. The only contacts detected between the DNABD and the remainder of Chd1 are contacts with the chromodomains (Figure 2 ). The first of these is the interaction between K329 of chromodomain II and D1201 off two turns of nucleosomal DNA, a process that likely requires substantial force (Hall et al., 2009; Meng et al., 2015) . As a result it is somewhat surprising that the area of contact between the chromodomains and DNABD is so small. It is possible that additional regions of Chd1 including the Nterminus that is not resolved in the density map also contribute to this interaction as suggested by previous studies of Chd1 proteins (Liu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018 )(Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017 .\n\n.

When not bound to nucleosomes, the tandem chromodomains of Chd1 are observed to impede DNA binding to the ATPase domains (Hauk et al., 2010) . This gave rise to the prediction that these domains would be rearranged in the nucleosome bound state (Hauk et al., 2010) . This is indeed the case as the chromodomains undergo an 18 degree rotation when compared to the orientation observed in The repositioning of ATPase lobe II enables contacts to be made with nucleosomal DNA (see below), the histone H4 tail and the histone H3 alpha 1 helix ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4) .These are the only direct contacts with histone components of the nucleosome. The contact with the H4 tails is conserved in mtISWI and Snf2 (Liu et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2016) . D729 and E669 are conserved across all classes of remodelling enzyme but D725 is not as well conserved in Snf2 related enzymes (Figure 2 -figure supplement 4B ).\n\nThe conservation of this contact in Chd1 enzymes is consistent with the H4 tail playing an important role in regulating Chd1 activity; deletion or mutation of the H4 tail has been shown to reduce nucleosome sliding and ATPase activity (Ferreira et al., 2007) . The additional helices that make up the protrusion 2 region of ATPase lobe 2 in Chd1 are conserved in chromatin remodeling ATPases, but not within all SF2 DNA translocases. Within this region residues 638-642 interact with the alpha 1 helix of histone H3 ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4A). The residues participating in the interaction are progressively less well conserved in ISWI and SNF2 related proteins ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4C). A loop from Phe1033 to Leu 1045 in an equivalent region of the yeast Snf2 protein is not assigned in the Snf2-nucleosome structure, but this region is positioned such that a related contact with histone H3 could be made.\n\nThe structure, also provides clues as to how these conformational changes are driven. A central event is likely to be the closure of the cleft between The partial repositioning of the chromodomains observed in free Chd1 is likely to be stabilised by additional favourable interactions formed when this repositioning occurs within the context of nucleosome bound Chd1. These include the formation of contacts between chromodomain I and DNA at SHL1, between ATPase lobe II and the H3 alpha 1 helix, between ATPase lobe II and the histone H4 tail and most significantly the formation of a substantial interaction interface between ATPase lobe II and nucleosomal DNA at SHL2.\n\nThe repositioning of the chromodomains in turn acts as a lever to reposition the DNA binding domain. In the context of nucleosomes this results in nucleotide dependent unwrapping of two turns of nucleosomal DNA (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . Conversely, the interaction of the DNABD requires linker DNA to be accessible.\n\nIn order to investigate how the ability of the DNABD to interact with linker DNA is affected by the presence of an adjacent nucleosome, interactions between dinucleosomes with different separations were modelled. With a linker length of 19 bp Chd1 can be modelled binding the linker between adjacent nucleosomes ( Figure 5 ). However, as the linker between nucleosomes is reduced, steric clashes become increasingly prohibitive. The requirement for a 19bp linker is likely to provide a limit below which engagement of the DNABD will be less stable. As this lower limit is set by clashes between the DNABD and the adjacent nucleosome, it is different from the length of linker required to occupy the DNA binding surface of the SANT and SLIDE domains on a mononucleosome with a free DNA linker. In this latter case 7 base pairs of DNA make contact with the DNABD (Figure 1 ). The c19 bp separation below which access of the DNABD to linker becomes progressively more difficult resonates with the average inter-nucleosome spacing of 19 bp observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tsankov et al., 2010) . As the conformation of the DNABD is connected via the chromodomains to the ATPase domains, the structure of Chd1 provides molecular connectivity between the availability of nucleosomal linker DNA in excess of 19bp and the generation of closed nucleotide bound motor domains. This potentially provides a mechanism via which linker DNA length regulates the rate of nucleosome movement (Yang et al., 2006) .\n\n. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

This has been observed directly for several Snf2 family proteins (Deindl et al., 2013; Lia et al., 2006; Sirinakis et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006) and is conserved within a wider family of superfamily II ATPases (Singleton et al., 2007) NS3 (Durr et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2017; Thoma et al., 2005) . As a result the alignment is restricted to conserved helices. In the case of lobe I and II the RMSD of the fit is 4.9 \u00c5 and 6.5 \u00c5 respectively (Figure 6 -figure supplement 1A). In the closed state alignment of both domains with the structure of NS3 in the ADP.BeF bound state results in an RMSD of 9.8 \u00c5. Using this alignment the ssDNA bound by NS3 can be docked into the Chd1-Nucleosome structure ( Figure 6A ). This ssDNA aligns with the top strand of nucleosomal DNA ( Figure 6 ). Conserved motif Ia in ATPase lobe 1 and motifs IV and V from ATPase lobe 2 contact this strand.\n\nThese residues undergo a ratcheting motion during the course of ATP hydrolysis that drives the ssDNA through NS3 (Gu & Rice, 2010) . Similar motion between these residues would be anticipated to drive nucleosomal DNA across the nucleosome dyad in the direction of the longer linker ( Figure   6B ).\n\nIt is notable that within Chd1 additional DNA contacts are made that differ from those observed in NS3. Firstly, motifs II and III within lobe 1 contact the opposite DNA strand ( Figure 6A ). As these motifs are intimately associated with motif Ia they would be anticipated to undergo a similar ratcheting motion with respect to the contacts made by lobe 2. Secondly, the ATPase lobes of Chd1 like those of Snf2 contain additional helices including the protrusions to . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

As Chd1 binds to one side of the nucleosome, no steric clashes are anticipated should a second Chd1 bind linker DNA on the opposite side of the nucleosome. To investigate this further, complexes consisting of two Chd1 molecules bound to one nucleosome were prepared using nucleosomal DNA \n\nOn the fully wrapped side of the nucleosome the H3 tail can be traced to proline 38, emerging between the DNA gyres at SHL1. In contrast, on the unwrapped side of the nucleosome the H3 tail can be traced to alanine 26 indicating that on this side of the nucleosome the H3 tail is better ordered. In addition, the trajectory of the tail is different to that observed in previous structures ( Figure 8A ). This altered trajectory was also not observed in a previous structure of a Chd1 bound nucleosome, however, this structure was made in the presence of PAF1 and FACT which may result in some noise in this region that is not apparent in our structure (Farnung et al., 2017) . A potential explanation for the defined and altered trajectory of the histone H3 tail on the unwrapped side of the nucleosome is that amino acids within extreme N-terminal region, that are not resolved in our structure, interact with .

The 25 N-terminal residues include eight lysine and arginine residues that could interact with DNA at different locations along the unravelled linker.\n\nThe electron density for ubiquitin molecules is not as well defined as other components of the complex, and limiting for the overall resolution ( Figure 1 ). This is likely to reflect mobility of the ubiquitin peptides. Consistent with this the electron density determined from X-ray diffraction on crystallised nucleosomes with ubiquitin conjugated at this location resulted in no density attributable to ubiquitin (Machida et al., 2016) . On the wrapped side of the nucleosome, ubiquitin is located adjacent to the acidic patch that is widely used as an interface for nucleosome binding proteins (McGinty & Tan, 2016) ( Figure 8B ). This is also the location that ubiquitin conjugated to H2A K15 has been observed to occupy on unbound nucleosomes ( \n\n. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

The two direct contacts with histones are with the H3 alpha one helix and with the histone H4 tail (Figure 2 -Figure supplement 4 ).\n\nThe contact is with the H4 tail is required for efficient remodelling by Chd1 (Ferreira et al., 2007) as it is for ISWI subfamily enzymes (Clapier et al., 2001; Hamiche et al., 2001) . Aside from these two contacts, the interaction of Chd1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/290874 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nThe Chd1 enzyme has the ability to organise spaced arrays of nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo (Gkikopoulos et al., 2011; Lusser et al., 2005; Robinson & Schultz, 2003) . Enzymes that exhibit this organising activity typically reposition nucleosomes away from the ends of short DNA fragments. This is also true for Chd1 (McKnight et al., 2011; Stockdale et al., 2006) . As a result we would anticipate that Chd1 would be most likely to reposition nucleosomes away from the short (exit) linker, encroaching into the long Inferring the mechanism of Chd1 from NS3 is complicated by the fact these enzymes are not so closely related. Conserved motifs are difficult to align based on sequence alone. In addition some aspects of nucleic acid binding by both Snf2 and Chd1 profoundly differ from NS3. Notably, motifs II and III within lobe 1 contact the opposite, 3'-5' stand, which is not present in NS3. In addition, Snf2 related chromatin remodelling enzymes contain features that extend the nucleic acid binding cleft between the two ATPase lobes and make contacts with both strands ( Figure 6 ). As a result of the extensive contacts with both strands, it is possible that the assignment of guide and tracking strands within remodelling ATPases is not absolute as tracking may be coupled to both strands. Consistent with this experiments that have probed the action of remodelling enzymes using short gaps in either strand of nucleosomal DNA have found them to be sensitive to lesions in either strand (Saha et al., 2005; Zofall et al., 2006) .\n\nThe introduction of gaps in nucleosomal DNA has also been used to infer the directionality with which ATPases's move along DNA. Introduction of gaps distal to the SHL 2 location closest to the entry linker DNA has been observed to impede the action of Snf2, Iswi and Chd1 enzymes (McKnight et al., 2011; Saha et al., 2005; Zofall et al., 2006) .

As a consequence it has been proposed that Chd1 bound in the cross gyres conformation, that we and others observe, represents an inactive state in which the interaction of the DNABD with linker DNA is inhibitory (Farnung et al., 2017; Nodelman et al., 2017) . If this were the case, then Chd1 directed repositioning might be expected to be limited once a nucleosome has moved far enough from a DNA end to enable the DNABD to contact linker DNA. On Chd1 bound nucleosomes the DNABD contacts extend to 7bp from the nucleosomes edge. A stall to repositioning after 7bp is not observed, instead Chd1 repositions nucleosomes 23-39 base pairs into a 54 base pair linker in a very similar way to Isw1a and Isw2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/290874 doi: bioRxiv preprint Both budding yeast Chd1 and human Chd2 are found to be enriched within coding regions (de Dieuleveult et al., 2016; Gkikopoulos et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2017) . Histone H3 K36me3 is a hallmark of coding region nucleosomes, so we prepared nucleosomes alkylated to mimic trimethylation at this position.\n\nAlkylation modestly stimulates Chd1 activity (Figure 1 -Figure supplement 1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/290874 doi: bioRxiv preprint H2BK120 ubiquitination is also enriched in coding region chromatin, and has previously been observed to stimulate Chd1 activity (Levendosky et al., 2016) .\n\nAlthough the level of Chd1 stimulation is only 2-fold, we have previously observed that mutations exerting a 2-fold effect on Chd1 activity in vitro affect nucleosome organisation in vivo (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . It has also been observed that H2BK120Ub negatively affects the activity of some ISWI containing enzymes (Fierz et al., 2011) . As organisation of coding region nucleosomes involves these and other enzymes (Krietenstein et al., 2016; Ocampo et al., 2016; Parnell et al., 2015) , H2BK120Ub has the potential to regulate interplay between different enzymes.

All processes that generate local DNA unwrapping would be anticipated to result in similar repositioning of histone tail epitopes. In particular, where combinations of modifications are recognised bivalently, the spatial alignment of epitopes will be important for recognition by coupled reader domains.

The gel shift was scanned on Fujifilm FLA-5100 imaging system at 532nm.\n\nMTSL was conjugated to introduce cysteines immediately following size exclusion purification as described in Hammond et al (Hammond et al., 2016) .\n\nExcess unreacted labels were removed from the sample by dialysis. PELDOR experiments were conducted at Q-band (34 GHz) operating on a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer with a probe head supporting a cylindrical resonator ER 5106QT-2w and a Bruker 400 U second microwave source unit as described previously (Hammond et al., 2016) . All measurements reported here were made at 50K. Data analysis was carried out using the DeerAnalysis 2013 package (Jeschke and Polyhach, 2007) . The dipolar coupling evolution data were first corrected to remove background decay. Tikhonov regularisation was then used to determine distance distributions from each dataset. bound to nucleosome in the presence of ADP.BeFx described in this study was used as a model. For each structure, R1 spin labels were added and the distribution simulated for each position using MTSSL wizard in Pymol. Also the average distance from the distribution from a pair of spin labels were calculated using MTSSL wizard in Pymol.\n\nThe appropriate ratio of ScChd1(1-1305\u220657-88) to nucleosome for 1:1 and the 2:1 complex formation in the presence of 5-fold molar excess of ADP-BeFx was determined by titration and native PAGE analysis. The formed complex was then purified by size exclusion gel filtration using a PC 3.2/30 superdex 200 analytical column in 20mM Tris, 50mM NaCl and 250 \u00b5M ADP.BeFx . In a typical run 50uLs of 20 \u00b5M of sample was injected using Dionex autoloader. 50uLs fractions were collected and analysed in 6% Native PAGE gel and appropriate fractions containing ScChd1-nucleosome complexes were pooled together. A 4 \u00b5l drop of sample was then applied to C-flat Holey carbon foil (400 mesh R1.2/1.3 uM) pre-cleaned with glow discharge (Quorum technologies). After 15 second incubation, grids were double side blotted for 4 s in a FEI cryo-plunger (FEI Mark III) at 90% humidity and plunge frozen into \u2212172 \u00b0C liquefied ethane. Standard vitrobot filter paper \u00d8 55/20 mm, Grade 595 was used for blotting.\n\nThe prepared grids are initially checked for its ice quality and the particle distribution using a JEOL 2010 microscope with side-entry cryo-holder operated at 200 keV and equipped with a gatan 4k \u00d7 4k CCD camera. Cryogrids were then stored in liquid nitrogen and dry-shipped to respective centre for data collection. For the 1:1 complex the data was acquired on a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 300 keV, equipped with a K2 summit direct detector (Gatan). Automated data .

CTF correction was then performed on the motion corrected summed image using Gctf. Subsequent image processing was performed with RELION 2.0.4. About 5000 particles from 50 micrographs were first handpicked in RELION, extracted and 2D classes were generated. These 2D classes were then used as a reference in RELION autopick routine and particles were picked from respective number of micrographs from each dataset. The autopicked particles were subsequently extracted and sorted. An iterative round of two-dimensional classification was performed to discard poorly averaging particles, contamination and exploded particles. On the resultant cleaned up particle stack a hierarchical three-dimensional classification and refinement was performed as described in the results. A low pass filtered low resolution chd1 engaged nucleosome structure was used as an initial model in the 3D classification. At the three-dimensional refinement stages a mask that encompasses the entire Chd1-nucleosome complex was applied. Post processing of refined models was performed with automatic B factor determination in RELION. Local resolution estimates were determined using Resmap-1.4.\n\nFor model building X.laevis nucleosome with Widom 601 sequence (PDB 3LZ0), the S.cerevisiae Chd1 DNA-binding domain (PDB 3TED) and the ATPase core with tandem chromo domain (3MWY) were used. The domains were individually placed into the electron density using UCSF chimera and fitted as a rigid body. The path of the unwrapped DNA, H4 tail region and H3 tail region were manually built in Coot. Protein back bone restraints and DNA base pair, and parallel pair restraints were generated using ProSMART and LibG modules. The generated restraints were then used as constraint in jelly .

ADP\u00b7BeF3 was built by superpositioning ATP-gamma-S from the inactive Chd1 structure (PDB code 3MWY) onto our model, inspected in COOT and replacing the ATP analogue with ADP\u00b7BeFx. Sequence alignments were generated using JALVIEW (Waterhouse et al., 2009) Ubiquitin was cross-linked to H2BK120C as described previously (Long et al., 2014; Morgan et al., 2016) . Ubiquitin modified H2B was purified by ion exchange chromatography and the extent of coupling confirmed by SDS PAGE (A). Nucleosomes were assembled on DNA including an asymmetric The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/290874 doi: bioRxiv preprint Residues coming into proximity with the H4 tail, D275, D279 and E669 are indicated by surface charge. The contact between ATPase lobe 2 and the histone H3 alpha 1 helix is also shown. B and C, Sequence alignments show that the sequences participating in these interactions are conserved in Chd1 proteins and to some extent in Iswi and Snf2 proteins as well. Pulsed electron paramagnetic measurements were used to measure the distance between nitroxyl reporter groups attached to Chd1 at ATPase lobe 1 (S524) and chromodomain I (V256). A) The probability distribution P(r ) at different separations was measured in the presence (purple) and absence (blue) of ADP.BeF. The distance corresponding to the major distance is shown for both measurements, for the ADP.BeF sample the distance corresponding to the shoulder is also indicated. Modelled distances between these labelling sites in the open state (3MWY), and the closed state observed in the Chd1 bound nucleosome are indicated in B and C respectively.

B) Schematic indicating directionality in context of a nucleosome. The directionality of NS3 translocation inferred from docking the ssDNA is 3'-5' away from the nucleosome dyad. Assuming movement of Chd1 around the nucleosome is constrained (for example via contact with linker DNA, the H4 tail and histone H3) translocation of Chd1 with this directionality is anticipated to drive DNA in the opposite direction towards the long linker as indicated.
