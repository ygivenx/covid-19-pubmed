{"title": "CEACAM1 regulates TIM-3-mediated tolerance and exhaustion", "body": "We examined the role of CEACAM1 in ovalbumin (OVA)-specific peripheral T-cell tolerance 11 . OVA protein administration (Extended Data Fig. 1a ) resulted intolerance induction in wild-type OVA-specific T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.  1a ), but not in transgenic OT-II Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1b) . Transfer of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled naive CD4 + V\u03b12 + T cells from transgenic OT-II Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice into Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c) was associated with increased OVA induced proliferation (Fig. 1c) and TIM-3 expression uniformly restricted to proliferating CEACAM1 + T cells ( Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig.  1d ).\n\nCD4 + T-cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b28 + T cells in Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 , but not wild-type, mice lacked TIM-3 expression after Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) administration, suggesting CEACAM1 and TIM-3 co-expression on tolerized T cells (Extended Data Fig.  1e , f). Flag-tagged human (h) CEACAM1 enhanced cell surface expression of co-transfected haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hTIM-3 in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells, with virtually all hTIM-3-positive HEK293T cells notably CEACAM1-positive (Fig. 1e) . Human T cells co-expressed TIM-3 and CEACAM1 after in vitro activation with decreased CEACAM1 expression after TIM3 (also known as HAVCR2) silencing ( Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g , h). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, but not uninfected, subjects exhibited increased CEACAM1 + TIM-3 + (double-positive) CD4 + T cells, which were poor producers of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), as were double-positive CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1g , h and Extended Data Fig. 1i-l) . In situ proximity ligation analysis 12 of hCEACAM1 and hTIM-3 co-transfected HEK293T cells ( Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig.  1m-o) , and co-cultures of activated primary human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1p, q) confirmed the nearness of both molecules on the cell surface of HEK293T cells and colocalization within the immune synapse of activated T cells, respectively.\n\nTIM-3 has been proposed to engage an unknown ligand 13 (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c) , and we considered CEACAM1 a possible candidate that is known to homodimerize 14 Fig. 2h , i). hCEACAM1, but not integrin \u03b15 (ITGA5) (Extended Data Fig. 3a) , was co-immunoprecipitated with hTIM-3 and vice-versa from co-transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 2a, b) . Co-immunoprecipitation of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 was confirmed with activated primary human T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b ) and primary mouse T cells from either Ceacam1-4L Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 6 or Ceacam1-4S Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 10 (transgenic mice in which CEACAM1 isoforms containing a long (L) or short (S) cytoplasmic tail, respectively, are conditionally overexpressed in T cells) 7 (Extended Data Fig. 3c ).\n\nAlthough tunicamycin treatment had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 3d ), mutation of amino acid residues including natural human allelic variants anticipated to be involved in these interactions disrupted the co-immunoprecipitation of hCEACAM1 and hTIM-3 in cotransfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 2c, A single-chain of the hCEACAM1 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-107) joined to the hTIM-3 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-105) by a linker (GGGGS) 4 with a hexahistidine tag appended to the carboxy terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli (Extended Data Fig.  4a) , and shown to interact specifically with the N-terminal domain of hTIM-3 by surface plasmon resonance (Extended Data Fig. 4b-e ). This single-chain protein was crystallized and a structural model built from X-ray diffraction data (Extended Data Table 2 ). This revealed two similar copies of a hCEACAM1 (IgV domain)-hTIM-3 (IgV domain) heterodimer interacting along each of the respective FG-CC\u2032 faces (Fig. 2e ) and at amino acid contact points demonstrated to be involved in biochemical interactions between hCEACAM1 and hTIM-3 ( Metabolic labelling ( Fig. 2h-j) showed overall enhancement of hTIM-3 biosynthesis after hCEACAM1 co-expression with decreased cell surface display, intracellular accumulation and hypoglycosylation of hTIM-3 when mutant, hypomorphic forms of hTIM-3 or hCEACAM1 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a-e) . Especially profound was a natural hTIM-3 variant (rs147827860 (Thr101Ile)) that although exhibiting normal core protein association with hCEACAM1 (Extended Data Fig. 5f ) could not be rescued by hCEACAM1 co-expression and remained hypoglycosylated with increased intracellular retention and a near absence of cell surface expression (Fig. 2h , i, Extended Data Fig. 5a , b, e and Supplementary Information).\n\nCD4 + T cells from SEB-treated Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 miceormice with transgenic overexpression of Tim3 (also known as Havcr2) in T cells 16 lacking CEACAM1 expression (Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 ) exhibited diminished expression of all mTIM-3 forms (fully glycosylated, hypoglycosylated and core protein) (Fig. 2k) , decreased upregulation of TIM-3 expression on the cell surface ( Fig. 2l ) and blunted deletion of CD4 + V\u03b28 + T cells (Extended Data Fig.  5g ) relative to wild-type or transgenic Tim3 Tg mice expressing endogenous CEACAM1. Thelper 1 (T H 1) polarized cells from Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212\u2212 mice were resistant to galectin-9induced apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 5h ), which is dependent on TIM-3 expression as a glycoprotein 15 .\n\nThe hTIM-3 N-terminal domain bound hCEACAM1 and stained the cell surface of human CEACAM1-4L-transfected Jurkat T cells ( Fig. 2m and Extended Data Fig. 5i, j) . Transligation of wild-type mouse CD4 + T cells with a mCEACAM1 N-terminal domain-Fc fusion protein (NFc) rendered them unresponsive to in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 ( Fig. 2n and Extended Data Fig. 5k ). CD4 + T cells from SEB-treated Tim3 Tg or Tim3 Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited similar levels of TIM-3 associated BAT3, a repressor of TIM-3 cytoplasmic tail signalling 17 , at the time of T-cell isolation (Fig. 2o) . However, only T cells from SEB-tolerized Tim3 Tg mice, but not SEB-treated Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that were resistant to SEB-induced tolerance, exhibited BAT3 dissociation from mTIM-3 after NFc fusion protein ligation with further release observed after addition of anti-CD3 ( Fig. 2o and Extended Data Fig. 5l , m). We observed similar levels of NFc fusion protein staining of primary T cells from Tim3 Tg and Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, relative to that observed with Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which was blocked by a TIM-3-specific antibody (Extended Data Fig.  5n ), implicating heterophilic ligation of TIM-3 as the major factor responsible for T-cell inhibition and BAT3 release.\n\nHighly activated CD4 + T cells from wild-type and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were transduced with a retrovirus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) plus mTIM-3. Anti-CD3 induced proliferation and TNF-\u03b1 secretion was inhibited by NFc fusion protein ligation in transduced wild-type but not Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells or all groups transduced with GFP alone (Fig. 2p , q and Extended Data Fig. 5o, p) . Both wild-type and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 T-cell transductants with a mTIM-3 cytoplasmic tail deletion construct (TIM-3 \u0394252-281 ) 17, 18 were unresponsive to anti-CD3 stimulation or NFc fusion protein ligation (Fig. 2p , q and Extended Data Fig. 5o, p) .\n\nTolerance pathways are important in T-cell regulation 19 . We detected homozygous rs147827860 (Thr101Ile) carriage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but not controls (Extended Data Table 3a -c). We thus transferred naive CD4 + CD62L high CD44 \u2212 T cells from wild-type mice into Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 recipients and observed colon-infiltrating CEACAM1 + TIM-3 + T cells expressing markedly decreased intracellular levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-17A relative to other lamina propria T cells (Fig. 3a, b) . Colon-infiltrating lamina propria T cells from adoptive transfer of naive Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells into Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 recipients expressed reduced cell surface levels of TIM-3 (Fig. 3c) and increased intracellular levels of TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 3d ) in association with a severe progressive colitis with increased mortality (Fig. 3e, dagger symbol) , and histopathological evidence of injury (Fig. 3f ) characterized by acute and chronic inflammation (Extended Data Fig. 6a ). Reestablishment of T-cell-specific mCEACAM1-4L expression using CeaCAM1-4L Tg CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 6 , restored TIM-3 display and decreased intracellular TNF-\u03b1 expression by the infiltrating lamina propria T cells together with decreased disease severity ( Fig. 3c-f and Extended Data Fig. 6b ), reflective of CEACAM1 + TIM-3 + T-cell restoration.\n\nCD4 + T cells from Tim3 Tg CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, in contrast to those from CEACAM1proficient Tim3 Tg mice, were hyper-inflammatory after transfer into CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 recipients and caused significant weight loss and severe colitis with increased expression of T H 17 signature genes (Fig. 3g -i and Extended Data Fig. 6c, d) . Nanostring (Extended Data Fig. 6e ) and quantitative PCR (Fig. 3j) analysis of lamina propria mononuclear cells demonstrated increased transcripts for Ebi3, IL-27p28 (also known as Il27) and IL-12p35 (also known as Il12a) encoding the regulatory cytokines IL-27 and IL- 35 (refs 20, 21) in CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 recipients of CD4 + T cells from Tim3 Tg relative to wild-type mice, and their absence in recipients of CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 or Tim3 Tg CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 T cells.\n\nAnti-tumour immunity is hindered by T-cell expression of inhibitory molecules associated with an exhausted phenotype 22 . We observed high levels of CEACAM1 + TIM-3 + , relative to PD-1 + TIM-3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells at the tumour site of wild-type mice in the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) model of colitis-associated colon cancer (Extended Data Fig. 6f -j). At 2.5% DSS, Tim3 Tg mice exhibited 100% fatality, significantly greater than all other genotypes (Fig. 4a) . Tumour quantification at a lower DSS dose (1.5%) showed that the polyp numbers, polyp size, high-grade dysplasia and frank carcinoma were significantly higher in Tim3 Tg than in wild-type mice with decreased neoplasia observed in Tim3 Tg CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 and CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4b-d and Extended Data Fig. 6k ).\n\nAfter implantation of colorectal cancer cells (CT26) subcutaneously in BALB/c mice, a significant fraction of CD8 + tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was triple-positive T cells (TIM-3 + PD-1 + CEACAM1 + ), with the relative cell surface levels of TIM-3 correlating with CEACAM1 (Fig. 4e) . PD-1 + TIM-3 bright CEACAM1 + T cells were characterized by extremely low intracellular IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression consistent with exhaustion (Fig. 4f ). Co-administration of an anti-mCEACAM1 and anti-mTIM-3 antibody delayed subcutaneous tumour growth in a preventative model ( Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 7a) , and was able to exceed protection with co-blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c) . In a therapeutic model, blockade of CEACAM1 synergized with PD-1 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 7d , e). CEACAM1 and TIM-3 co-blockade was associated with increased CD8 + (Fig.  4h ) and CD4 + (Fig. 4i ) TILs with enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 4j) and decreased IL-10 production (Extended Data Fig. 7f ) by the infiltrating CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, respectively. Increased tumour antigen-specific CD8 + T cells defined by AH1-tetramer staining 23 , relative to the total CD8 + T-cell population ( Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 7g ) was observed in the draining lymph nodes that correlated with tumour growth inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 7h ). CT26 tumour growth was impeded in CeaCAM1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4l) in association with increased AH-1 tetramer + CD8 + T cells in draining lymph nodes ( Fig.  4m and Extended Data Fig. 7i ) and decreased TIM-3 expression on tumour-associated TILs (Fig. 4n ).\n\nIn conclusion, we show that CEACAM1 and TIM-3 form a new heterodimeric complex that is determined by interactions between their structurally similar membrane-distal IgV-like, N-terminal domains. This association is evident during early biosynthesis and crucial for proper maturation, cell surface display and function of TIM-3 and probably CEACAM1 when expressed together. CEACAM1 also functions as an essential trans-heterophilic ligand for TIM-3 with the tolerance-inducing functions of TIM-3 requiring interactions with CEACAM1 in both cis and trans configurations. CEACAM1 expression with TIM-3 is further characteristic of T cells with an exhausted phenotype such that in the absence of these interactions inflammatory responses are unrestrained and anti-tumour immunity enhanced. Together, these studies describe a novel class of heterodimeric protein interactions that function in tolerance induction with broad implications for many types of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic conditions.

Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c backcrosses) were generated by N. Beauchemin 24 . Transgenic OT-II Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice were generated by first crossing Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice to Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 (Taconic) for >6 generations to obtain Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 double-knockout mice on aC57BL/6 background, followed by crossing these mice to transgenic OT-II Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Taconic) for >9 generations.Tim3 Tg (ref. 16) and Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice on a C57BL/6 background were intercrossed to generate Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Ceacam1-4L Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 and Ceacam1-4S Tg Ceacam1 \u2212\u2212 mice have been previously described 6, 10 . All studies were performed in mice with a C57BL/6 genetic background except for CT26 tumour experiments that were in a BALB/c genetic background. Animal studies were conducted in a gender and age-matched manner for all experiments. Both male and female mice were used and were 6-8 weeks of age at the time of experiments or 6-10 weeks for the adoptive transfer colitis experiments. The number of animals used per group was based on previous experimental results and observed variability. Histopathology analysis was performed in a blinded manner by an expert pathologist (J.N.G.). For all other in vitro and in vivo analyses, investigators were not blinded to treatment allocation. All experiments were approved and conducted according to the guidelines set forth by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals.\n\nMouse tails were digested in tail lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2%SDS, 200 mM NaCl and proteinase K (Roche)) overnight at 55 \u00b0C. Genomic DNA was phenol-extracted and isopropanol precipitated. DNA was dissolved in TE buffer. The primer sequences for genotyping are available on request.\n\nFor SEB tolerance induction model, animals of the indicated genotypes were injected intraperitoneally with 25 \u00b5g of SEB (Millipore) on days 0 and 4, and euthanized at day 8 after the first injection. Peripheral lymph node cells were isolated and stained for T-cell receptor V\u03b26, V\u03b28 and CD4, and analysed for TIM-3 and CEACAM1 expression on CD4 + V\u03b28 + cells. Cells were also re-stimulated in vitro at 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells per ml with anti-CD3 (0.1-10.0 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) and assessed for proliferation by [ 3 H]-thymidine (1 \u00b5Ci ml \u22121 ) uptake or production of IL-2 by ELISA. For OVA antigen-specific T-cell tolerance induction, highdose OVA antigen was used and modified according to previous studies 11, 25, 26 . In brief, transgenic OT-II Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice were injected intraperitonally with 500 \u00b5g of OVA peptide (323-339, 323-ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR-329, AnaSpec) in an equal volume a mount of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or PBS alone at day 0 (activation of immune response) and at day 4 (tolerance induction). At day 10, CD4 + T cells were isolated from spleens and pooled peripheral lymphocytes from each experimentally treated mouse as indicated above. The pooled lymphocytes from each mouse were restimulated in vitro with various concentrations of OVA 323-339 peptide (0.1, 1, 2.5 and 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ). The 96-well cultures were set up with a total cell number of 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 in 200 \u00b5l RPMI complete medium pulsed with 1 \u00b5Ci [ 3 H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the final 8h of the 72h assay, and collected with a Packard Micromate cell harvester. Counts per minute (c.p.m.) were determined using a Packard Matrix 96 direct counter (Packard Biosciences) and data expressed as median values. For in vivo tracking of OVA-specific antigen-specific T-cell responses, adoptive transfer experiments were performed on the basis of previous studies 27 . In brief, CD4 + V\u03b12 + T cells were isolated from spleens and pooled peripheral lymphocytes of transgenic OT-II Ceacam1 +/+ (wild-type) Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice and the cells were pre-incubated for 10 min with 4 mM CFSE in PBS plus 0.1% FBS. CFSElabelled cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 ) were injected intravenously by tail vein into syngeneic C57BL/6 wild-type or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients. After 18h to allow the adoptively transferred T cells to establish themselves in vivo, and which showed no differences in parking of the T cells among the various genotypes, the mice were then immunized with OVA 323-339 (50 \u00b5g) in an equal volume of CFA. On day 3, cells were collected from spleen, mesenteric lymph and peripheral lymph node of individual mice and stained with DAPI to exclude dead cells, and concurrently stained with anti-CD4-PerCp, anti-CEACAM1-allophycocyanin and anti-TIM-3-phycoerythrin. Total lymphocytes were gated and the CFSE subset representing the transgenic OT-II, adoptively transferred CD4 + T cells analysed and CEACAM1-and TIM-3-expression assessed on the CFSE-positive cells.\n\n3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, the TK-1 mouse T cell lymphoma cell line, the HEK293T cell line, and CT26 mouse colorectal cancer cell lines were all purchased from ATCC as mycoplasma-free cell lines and culture conditions were all followed according to ATCC instructions. Human CEACAM1-4L transfected human Jurkat T-cell line and human CEACAM1-4L transfected HeLa cells have been previously described (provided by J. Shively and S. G. Owen) 28, 29 .\n\nAn anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the C-C\u2032 loop of mCEACAM1 (ref. 30) (cc1, provided by K.V. Holmes and J. Shively) and isotype control (mouse IgG1) antibodies for the in vivo injection experiments were purchased from Bio X Cell. An Fc fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal domain of mouse CEACAM1 together with human IgG1, N-CEACAM1-Fc 31 was provided by T. Gallagher. The following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were purchased from BioLegend: anti-IFN-\u03b3 (XMG1.2), anti-IL-2 (JES6-5H4), anti-IL-17A (TC11-18H10.1), anti-IL-10 (JES5-16E3) and PD-L1 (10F.9G2); and other antibodies were purchased from eBioscience: anti-CD3 (clone, 145-2C11), anti-CD28 (clone 37.51), anti-CD8\u03b1 (clone, 53-6.7), anti-CD4 (clone, RM4-5), anti-TNF-\u03b1 (clone, MP6-XT22) and anti-TIM-3 (clone, 8B.2C12). The BAT3 antibody (clone AB10517) was purchased from Millipore. Brefeldin A and monensin were from eBioscience. The anti-TIM-3 5D12, 2C12, 2E2, 2E12 and 3F9 antibodies were generated in V.K.K.'s laboratory and 5D12 was conjugated to phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin by BioLegend. The anti-human CEACAM1 antibodies specific for the Nterminal domain (34B1, 26H7 and 5F4) have been previously described and characterized in R.S.B.'s laboratory 32, 33 . All the antibodies used for biochemical experiments if otherwise indicated, were purchased from Cell Signaling. Tunicamycin was purchased from Sigma.\n\nHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats from healthy anonymous donors according to an Institutional Review Board approved protocol from Brigham and Women's Hospital. CD4 + T cells were purified from PBMC using CD4 Microbeads (Miltenyi) and cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 20 mM HEPES and 100 IU ml \u22121 recombinant human IL-2 (R&D Systems). The T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-CD28 (CD28.2) antibodies (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 each, eBioscience).\n\nIn the analysis of HIV-infected individuals, informed consent was obtained in accordance with the guidelines for conduction of clinical research at the University of Toronto and Maple Leaf Clinic institutional ethics boards. Written informed consent was provided for this study, which was reviewed by research ethics board of the University of Toronto, Canada and of St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada. Individuals were recruited from a Toronto-based cohort (Maple Leaf Clinic and St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada). Samples were obtained from HIV-positive chronically infected antiretroviral treatment naive individuals (infected >1 year, with detectable viral load) and demographically matched HIVseronegative individuals. Whole blood was collected in anti-coagulant treated tubes and PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and stored at \u221215 \u00b0Cuntil future use. PBMCs from healthy HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals were stained with CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody (clone 26H7), detected with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to CD4, CD8 and CD3 (BioLegend), and TIM-3 (R & D Systems) to determine phenotype assessment. An Aqua amine dye (Invitrogen) was used to discriminate live and dead cells. For functional experiments, cells were stimulated after thawing with 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 of overlapping HIV-1 Clade B Gag peptide pool (National Institutes of Health AIDS Reagent Program), or 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 SEB (Sigma Aldrich) in the presence of brefeldin A (Sigma) for 6h. Surface staining was followed by a fixation and per-meabilization step. Intracellular staining for cytokines was performed using anti-IFN-\u03b3 (Biolegend). Cells were fixed in 2% formalin/PBS and acquired with a modified LSRII system (BD Biosciences). A total of 100,000 events were collected and analysed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).\n\nProximity ligation assay was performed using Duolink in situ PLA reagents on HEK293T cells co-transfected with human CEACAM1-Flag-tagged and human TIM-3-HA-tagged vectors. Primary antibodies used were anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies and followed by secondary antibodies. Cells on slides were blocked with Duolink Blocking stock followed by the application of two PLA probes in 1\u00d7 antibody diluent. The slides were washed in a wash buffer (1\u00d7 TBS-T) for 5 min twice and processed for hybridization using Duolink Hybridization stock 1:5 in high purity water and followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. Duolink Ligation was performed with ligase and the slides were incubated in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. Amplification was then achieved using Duolink Amplification stock containing the polymerase and the slides were incubated again in a preheated humidity chamber for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. DNA was stained with DAPI. A proximity ligation assay probe generates a fluorescent signal only when it binds to two primary antibodies (anti-HA and anti-Flag) attached to two proteins that are in maximum distance of 30-40 nm (ref. 12) to each other. One individual dot represents the close proximity of two interacting proteins within the cells.\n\nCD4 + and CD8 + T cells were isolated from human PBMCs by negative selection (EasySep, StemCell Technologies) and expanded by incubation with 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; BioLegend), 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (clone 28.8; BioLegend) with 50 U ml \u22121 of recombinant IL-2 (National Institutes of Health) in complete RPMI media for 5 days to upregulate CEACAM1 and TIM-3. After overnigh trest, T cells were mixed in a 2:1 ratio with Cell Tracker Blue CMAC (Invitrogen)-labelled human EBV-transformed B cells pre-loaded with SEB (Sigma-Aldrich), and brought into contact by centrifugation at 200g for 5 min. Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min and deposited onto poly-L-lysine coated coverslips for an additional 15 min. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized, blocked and stained with primary antibodies against CD3-\u03b5 (Abcam), CEACAM1 (clone5F4) and TIM-3 (R&D Systems) and appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibody. After immunofluorescent labelling, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and cured in the dark at room temperature for 24h. Imaging was performed on an Olympus IX81 confocal microscope. Z-stack images (0.15 \u00b5m) of conjugates were acquired with a \u00d760 Plan-Apochromat oil objective, numerical aperture 1.42.\n\nAll fluorescence images were background subtracted, annotated and exported using Olympus Fluoview FV100 image viewer. Colocalization analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated from corresponding interface regions from two channels using Volocity. For presentation in figures, images were adjusted and cropped equally across related groups.\n\nPoint mutations were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis, using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). The mutant oligonucleotides are listed in Extended Data Table 1a, b. Previously described vectors containing the human CEACAM1-3L variant 34 and human TIM-3 in the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen) 35 were used as the template for all mutations. PCR reactions for single amino acid mutations were run for 16 cycles of 30s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 55 \u00b0C, followed by 6 min at 68 \u00b0C. The resulting mutant plasmids were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing. TIM-3 amino acid residues were numbered according to National Center for Biotechnology Information database.\n\nHEK293T cells transfected with the 1,200 ng of Flag-tagged human CEACAM1 wild-type or mutant vectors or 1,200 ng of Flag-tagged ITGA5 (NM_002205; Origene) and 1,200 ng of HA-tagged human TIM-3 wild-type or mutant vectors or 1,200 ng of vector controls when mono-transfections were performed and cells transfected for 48 h. In some experiments, 6 h after transfection, transfected cells were treated with 2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 or 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 tunicamyin provided in DMSO for the last 24 h of transfection. Transfected cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed on ice with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH7.6, with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) and 1.0% digitonin (Sigma). After 60 min, the cell lysates were spun at 14,000 r.p.m. for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The lysate was subsequently incubated with 5 \u00b5l of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) that had been pre-adsorbed with an equal volume of immunoprecipitation buffer followed by three 1-h incubations with protein A-Sepharose. The pre-cleared lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with 10 \u00b5l of protein A-Sepharose beads bound to the specific antibodies. Some immunoprecipitates were incubated with agarose-HA antibody. The control and specific immunoprecipitates were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer and re-suspended in 30 \u00b5l of Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agents. After boiling for 5 min, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in regular Tris-glycine buffer on a 4-20% Tris-Glycine Gel (Novex). The proteins were electrically transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in 0.05% PBS-Tween (PBS-T), the membranes were incubated for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies. The membranes were further incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and visualized by Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare). The specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting in this assay were anti-Flag antibody produced in rabbit (Sigma), HA.11 (16B12) (Covance), anti-HA-Tag-agarose (MBL, Medical & Biological Laboratories Co), anti-HA antibody produced in rabbit and in mouse (Sigma) and anti-human CEACAM1 antibody, 5F4. Unsaturated films were digitally scanned and band intensities (densitometric analysis) were quantified using ImageJ (NIH).\n\nPrimary human CD4 + T cells were purified and activated with plate bound anti-CD3 (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) and anti-CD28 (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) in the presence of recombinant (r) IL-2 (10 ng ml \u22121 ; NIH) for 5 days. Cells were then rested in rIL-2 containing (10 ng ml \u22121 ) complete medium for 3 days and re-stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) for 2 days. Cell lysates were prepared as above and treated with N-glycanase by the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Promega). N-glycanase treated lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-human TIM-3 antibodies (2E2, 2E12 and 3F9) or mouse IgG1 as control and the immunoprecipitates subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes followed by immunoblotting with the mouse anti-human CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody, 5F4, as described above. Primary mouse splenocytes were prepared from Ceacam1-4L Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 and Ceacam1-4S Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) or anti-CD3 (1 \u00b5g/ml \u22121 ) plus anti-CD28 (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) or medium only for 96 h. Cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with cc1 (anti-mCEACAM1) and immunblotted with 5D12 (anti-mTIM-3) monoclonal antibodies as described above.\n\nCells were transfected as above with wild-type human HA-tagged hTIM-3 or Thr101Ile variant of HA-tagged hTIM-3 with or without co-transfection with Flag-tagged human CEACAM1 vector. All transfections included a co-transfection with Flag-tagged influenza virus M2 protein (M2) encoding vector as a non-binding control. After 48h, transfected HEK293T cells were incubated with methionine-and cysteine-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were labelled with 10 mCi ml \u22121 [ 35 S]-methionine/cysteine (1,175 Ci mmol \u22121 ; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 \u00b0C for the indicated times and chased with DMEM at 37 \u00b0C for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 150 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 30 \u00b5l of anti-HA agarose (Roche) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with gentle agitation. For enzymatic digestions, immunoprecipitates were denatured in glycoprotein denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by addition of sodium citrate (pH 5.5) to a final concentration of 50 mM, and incubated with endoglycosidaseH (New England Biolabs) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Immune complexes were eluted by boiling in reducing sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%), and visualized by autoradiography. Densitometric quantification of radioactivity was performed on a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm BAS-2500) using Image Reader BAS-2500 V1.8 software (Fujifilm) and Multi Gauge V2.2 (Fujifilm) software for analysis. Quantification of human TIM-3 in pulse-chase metabolic labelling was calculated by the following formula representing the average of 2-4 data sets: (human TIM-3 signal intensity -M2 protein signal intensity/M2 protein signal intensity).\n\nLentiviral vectors encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (pLKO.1) targeting human TIM3 and a control shRNA targeting lacZ were obtained from the Dana Farber DNA Resource Core. Lentiviral particles were produced as previously described 36 . Primary human CD4 + T cells were transduced 3 days after stimulation and selected with 2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 puromycin (Sigma) for 5 days followed by gradual increases of puromycin (5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) for the next 5 days and re-stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 for an additional 5 days. TIM3 shRNA1 (TRCN0000158033, 5\u2032-C GTGGACCAAACTGAAGCTAT-3\u2032); TIM3 shRNA 2 (TRCN0000154618, 5\u2032-G CACTGAACTTAAACAGGCAT-3\u2032); TIM3 shRNA 3 (TRCN0000157816, 5\u2032-C AAATGCAGTAGCAGAGGGAA-3\u2032); lacZ control knockdown (TRCN0000072225; 5\u2032-CTCTGGCTAACGGTACGCGTA-3\u2032).\n\nFor transduction of mouse primary CD4 + T cells, previously described mouse TIM-3 and its mutant expressing retroviruses were prepared in HEK293T cells using eco and gag/pol viral envelope constructs (Clontech Inc.) 17, 37, 38 . Viral supernatants were collected 48h after transfection and centrifuged and filtered with a 0.45-\u00b5m filters. CD4 + T cells were prepared at 10 6 cells per ml in the presence of polybrene (Sigma; 8 mg ml \u22121 ). Viral particles and CD4 + T cells were co-incubated by spin inoculation at 2,000g for 60 min on two sequential days. To detect ectopic expression of the constructs in T cells, cells were allowed to rest for 3 days in 2 ng ml \u22121 IL-2 and sorted to obtain cells with the highest (45%) GFP expression. Sorted cells were titrated into in vitro T-cell assays.\n\nNaive CD4 + T cells were polarized under T H 1 inducing conditions. In brief, naive CD4 + T cells (2 \u00d7 10 6 per ml) were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 specific antibodies (10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) for 48 h. Soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ), recombinant (r) IL-2 (10 ng ml \u22121 , NIH) and blocking antibodies to IL-4 (10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) and rIL-12 (5 ng ml \u22121 ) were added and the cells cultured for 7 days. Cells were washed and treated with galectin-9 (2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ; eBioscience) for 8 h to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using apoptosis staining kit (Roche) that stains for annexin V and propidium idodide.\n\nProtein purification, crystallization, X-ray data collection and model determination Competent E. coli BL21 DE3 cells were transformed with a pET9a vector carrying a gene insert coding for a single-chain of a protein consisting of the human CEACAM1 IgV domain (residues 1-107), a 20 amino acid linker (4 repeats of a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser motif), and the human IgV domain of TIM-3 (residues 1-105) with a hexa-histidine tag appended to the C terminus. To express the protein, trans-formants were grown in 1 litre of LB broth under antibiotic selection and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) after reaching an absorbance at 600 nm (A 600 nm ) of approximately 0.8. Cells were grown for an additional 16 hat 18 \u00b0C and collected by centrifugation. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies, which were solubilized in a chaotropic buffer and refolded in a buffer containing 200 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 0.4 M arginine-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM cysteamine and 0.5 mM cystamine, as reported previously 39 . Refolded protein was loaded onto a Ni-NTA affinity column and washed several times with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2, 10% glycerol and 10-30 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.2, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2, 10% glycerol and 300 mM imidazole. Eluted protein fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated and further purified with a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 and 10% glycerol. Circular dichroism was conducted to confirm proper protein folding. Purified protein (purity >95%, estimated by SDS-PAGE) was concentrated to 2.5 mg ml \u22121 for crystallization.\n\nThe initial crystal growth trials were performed by vapour diffusion using a Phoenix robotic system (Art Robbins) with Index Screens 1 and 2 (Hampton Research) and optimized using an additive screen (Hampton Research). Optimized crystals were formed in 4 \u00b5l drops (2 \u00b5l protein, 2 \u00b5l mother liquor), equilibrated against a mother liquor containing 100 mM Tris 8.0 and 25% PEG 3350, at room temperature in a sitting drop setup. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected in solution containing 25% PEG 3350 and 12% glycerol. X-ray data were collected using the X25 beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The data were processed with Mosflm 40 and the CCP4 software suite 41 .\n\nA crystallographic model of the single-chain human CEACAM1-TIM-3 protein was built by a molecular replacement strategy using a search model made by modifying published structures of the IgV (N) domain of human CEACAM1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2GK2) and mouse TIM-3 (PDB code 2OYP). Specifically, all residues were changed to alanine to reduce model bias and all small molecule ligands, water and metals were removed. Molecular replacement was performed with the program Molrep. Model building and structural refinement were performed with the PHENIX software 42 and COOT 43 , respectively. Five per cent of the total reflection data were excluded from the refinement cycles and used to calculate the free R factor (R free ) for monitoring refinement progress. Repeated rounds of model building and refinement with group B-factors refinement strategy and Torsion-NCS restraints resulted in a final crystallographic R work /R free of 34.5%/37.3% using all data to 3.4 \u00c5 resolution. The X-ray data and refinement statistics are shown in Extended Data Table 2 . Most of the residues were well defined and verified by PDB validation report (data not shown). However, the \u03b2-strands associated with the hTIM-3 AB-ED (ref. 13) face did not show the secondary structure of \u03b2-sheet formation, and two disulphide bonds (Cys 32-Cys 110 and Cys 53-Cys 62) observed in the mouse TIM-3 structure were missing from the resolved structure. A 2F o -F c electron density map of the human CEACAM1 (IgV)-TIM-3 (IgV) single chain was calculated using PHENIX. All the figures were drawn using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC) and labels were added using Adobe Photoshop.\n\nProtein purification, crystallization, data collection and structure determination of CEACAM1 (IgV) Competent E. coli BL21 DE3 cells were transformed with a pET9a vector carrying the human CEACAM1 IgV domain gene insert with a N-terminal GST tag. To express the protein, transformants were grown in 1 litre of LB broth under antibiotic selection and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG after reaching an A 600 nm of approximately 0.8. Cells were grown for an additional 16 h at 18 \u00b0C and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatant was loaded onto a GST column (GE Healthcare) and washed several times with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. After on-column removal of the GST affinity tag with thrombin, protein was eluted with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH7.5, containing 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 and 10% glycerol. Eluted protein fractions, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were concentrated and purified through a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) by FPLC system with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 and 10% glycerol. A single peak for human CEACAM1 IgV domain was collected and the protein was concentrated to 5 mg ml \u22121 for crystallization. A purity of >95%, was verified by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe initial crystal growth trials were performed in a 96-well format using a Phoenix robotic system (Art Robbins) with Index Screens 1 and 2 (Hampton Research) at room temperature. Optimized crystals were formed in well solution containing 60% Tascimate, pH8, and 1% \u03b2octyl glucoside at room temperature. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected in solution containing 60% Tascimate, pH8 and 18% glycerol. X-ray data were collected using beamline X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The data were processed with Mosflm 40 and the CCP4 software suite 41 . The structure of the human CEACAM1 N (IgV) domain was determined by the molecular replacement method using a modified Nterminal domain of human CEACAM1 as a search model (PDB code 2GK2) as the starting model, with all residues changed to alanine to reduce model bias and all small molecule ligands, water and metals were removed. Molecular replacement was performed with Molrep, refinements were performed with PHENIX 42 and intermittent model building was performed with COOT 43 , as described above. Subsequent refinements cycles and model building with individual B-factors and Torsion-NCS restraints strategy led to the final crystallographic R work /R free of 20.3%/24.2% using all data to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. Electron densities were also identified for bound molecules of beta-octyl glucoside and malonic acid. The X-ray data and structure refinement statistics are shown in Extended Data Table 2 . All residues were well defined and verified by PDB validation report (data not shown). A 2F o -F c electron density map was calculated using PHENIX 42 .\n\nTo model potential interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3, superimposition data as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2d , e, of previously described immunoglobulin-variable (IgV) domains of mouse CEACAM1 14 (PDB code 1L62) and mouse TIM-3 (PDB 2OYP) 13 was generated in Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC), which revealed structural similarity as shown by a score of 2.42 by root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) analysis as calculated by Pymol 44 . In addition, multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW 45 . From this analysis, we considered mouse CEACAM1 and TIM-3 as structurally similar proteins. Furthermore, as previous structural data for mouse CEACAM1 supported the formation of CEACAM1 homodimers between its N-terminal domains 14 , and given our evidence that mouse CEACAM1 and TIM-3 are highly similar, we further reasoned that mouse TIM-3 and its human orthologue might heterodimerize with CEACAM1 through their membrane-distal N-terminal domains. This hypothesis was modelled by us in the following manner. We aligned CEACAM1 symmetrically for cis modelling and asymmetrically for trans modelling along the five amino acid residues within the FG-CC\u2032 loops of mTIM-3 as reported previously 13 that describe putative docking sites for an unknown ligand for mouse TIM-3. The ROSIE Docking Server was used to analyse the docking (http://rosettadock.graylab.jhu.edu/documentation/docking) 46, 47 . We identified the ten best scoring structures from the run in rank order by energy. The top two in cis and the best in trans are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2g . The score (y axis) indicates the energy of the models (the lower the better). The r.m.s. (x axis) indicates the RMS values between the input and output docking models. The docking models identified were further assessed in PyMOL to determine whether the models identified predicted hydrogen bonding within the putative mouse CEACAM1-TIM-3 interface. On the basis of this we identified potential amino acids that may have an important role in mouse CEACAM1-TIM-3 binding, which is summarized in the table associated with Extended Data Fig. 2g .\n\nWe used the amino acids of mouse CEACAM1 and mouse TIM-3 modelled at the interface between these two proteins to predict potential contact sites for the human orthologues of CEACAM1 and TIM-3. Furthermore, we searched human exomic databases for allelic variants in these predicted human amino acids. Finally, we used all of this information to make structural modifications of human CEACAM1 and TIM-3 by site-directed mutagenesis to biochemically examine our hypothesis and confirm this by X-ray crystallographic analysis of a human CEACAM1-TIM-3 single-chain protein.\n\nGerman Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients were recruited at the Department of General Internal Medicine of the Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, or nationwide with the support of the German Crohn and Colitis Foundation and the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) competence network 'IBD' (Extended Data Table 3a ). The patients were classified according to clinical, radiological, histological and endoscopic (that is, type and distribution of lesions) according to accepted criteria 48, 49 . Healthy control individuals were obtained from the popgen biobank 50 . All controls were drawn from a population-representative sample. Given the low prevalence of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and the fact that all control individuals self-reported to have neither Crohn's disease nor ulcerative colitis, control individuals were designated 'healthy'. Written, informed consent was obtained from all study participants and all protocols were approved by the institutional ethical review committees of the participating centres. The variants described in Extended Data Table 3b were genotyped using the Sequenom iPlex and the Life Technologies Taqman system. rs147827860, the single nucleotide polymorphism encoding the hypomorphic Thr101Ile allele of TIM3, is a rare variant with a minor allele frequency of 0.004 in individuals of European descent predicting homozygous carriage with a frequency of 0.000016 (or 1:62,500). None of the publicly accessible databases lists any homozygous occurrences of this variant. Association in the case-control data was tested with Haploview 4.2 (ref. 51 ). An exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was performed using the DeFinetti program (Strom, T. M. & Wienker, T. F., http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl).\n\nThe TIM-3 IgV domain was expressed with a C-terminal GST tag as inclusion bodies from pET9a in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells. Inclusion bodies were refolded as described previously in refolding buffer containing 200 mM Tris, pH8.5, 0.4M arginine-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM cysteamine and 0.5 mM cystamine 39 . Refolded proteins were purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. The proteins were maintained in a solution containing 25 mM HEPES buffer, pH7.2, containing 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 and 5% glycerol. Circular dichroism was conducted to ascertain proper protein folding. A purity of >95%, was verified by SDS-PAGE.\n\nGlutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down analyses 52 of the interaction between IgV domains of human TIM-3 and human CEACAM1 were performed in the following manner. The GST-hTIM-3 protein was stored in refolding buffer, and buffer-exchanged with PBS before performing the assay. The IgV domain of GST-hTIM-3 proteins were coupled to the glutathione-agarose column following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo scientific) and in-column-incubated with HEK293T cell lysates derived from cells transfected with Flag-tagged human CEACAM1. The columns were washed extensively and bound proteins were eluted by glutathione. Eluted protein complexes were immunoblotted for the detection of CEACAM1 (immunoblot with anti-Flag) and TIM-3 (immunoblot with anti-GST).\n\nExtracellular membrane-associated proteins on live TK-1 cells were labelled with biotin (EZ-LinkSulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce). Whole-cell lysates were prepared and were incubated with 5 \u00b5g human IgG, full length TIM-3-Ig or soluble(s) TIM-3-Ig in the presence of protein G-agarose beads (Roche). Beads were washed and boiled with 1\u00d7SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and half of each was digested with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and the TIM-3-Ig fusion protein-specific binding proteins were detected by immunoblot or sliver staining.\n\nSplenic mononuclear cells were obtained from female wild-type, Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 , Ceacam-4L Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 , Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 , Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 +/+ (Tim3 Tg /wild-type) mice and CD4 + T cells were isolated using anti-CD4 (L3T4) MACS magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enriched CD4 + T cells (94-97% pure as estimated by FACS) were then labelled with PerCP-conjugated anti-CD4, allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD44, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD62L and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-TIM-3 (5D12 or 2C12). Subpopulations of CD4 + T cells were identified by three-colour sorting on a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson). All populations were defined as naive and 98.0% pure on re-analysis. To induce chronic colitis in animals, 5 \u00d7 10 5 CD4 + CD44 lo CD62L high (naive) T cells were adoptively transferred intraperitoneally into 6-10-week-old Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice. Weights were measured every week, and mice were euthanized by CO 2 for histological evaluation of colitis and lamina propria mononuclear cells. Owing to the severity of colitis associated with adoptive transfer of naive Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 CD4 + T cells, significant mortality was observed resulting in unequal group size at the at the time of culling necessitating post-hoc correction in the statistical analysis (see 'statistical methods').\n\nTo examine the effect of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 on tumour incidence and multiplicity in an inflammation induced colorectal cancer model, mice were intraperitoneally injected at 6 weeks of age with the carcinogen AOM (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 mg kg \u22121 body weight as previously reported 54, 55 . One week later, the mice were started on the first of two 21-day DSS cycles, consisting of a period of 7 days with the tumour promoter DSS at 2.5% or 1.5% in the drinking water followed by 7 days of receiving regular water. Mice showing signs of morbidity were culled. Colons were removed and flushed with PBS buffer and cut longitudinally. Colon tissue sections were either paraffin-embedded for immunohistochemistry or analysis of lamina propria mononuclear cells associated with the tumours. CT26 colorectal carcinoma cells were diluted into 10 \u00d7 10 6 cells per ml of PBS. After shaving, either wild-type or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice received 200 \u00b5l of the CT26 cell suspension subcutaneously in the left flank. All antibody treatments were applied intraperitoneally into the right flank according to the schedules described in Extended Data. Two-hundred micrograms of each antibody or its isotype control were administered according to the schedules described (CEACAM1, cc1 clone; TIM-3 5D12 clone; PDL1, 10F.9G2) Tumour growth was assessed three times per week at 7 days after tumour inoculation by measuring the width and length of the tumours (mm) using calipers and the areas defined (mm 2 ; width \u00d7 length). Mice were euthanized on the basis of the extent of tumour growth observed in the isotype antibody treated control animals to minimize animal suffering in accordance with the approved animal protocol.\n\nColons were removed from mice after termination and dissected free from the anus to the caecum. Colonic contents were removed and colons cleaned with PBS before fixation in 4% paraformaldyhyde or 10% neutral buffered formalin followed by routine paraffin embedding. After paraffin embedding, 0.5-mm sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Sections were examined and colitis was scored in a blinded fashion (with respect to genotype and experimental protocol) by one of the authors (J.N.G.). Each of four histological parameters for the severity of colitis was scored as absent (0), mild to severe (1-6): mononuclear cell infiltration, polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia, epithelial injury and extent of inflammation, modified from a previous study 56 . For AOM/DSS, colitis-associated colorectal cancer studies, an expert pathologist (J.N.G.) examined all tissues for dysplasia, adenoma, low-to-high-grade adenoma and adenocarcinoma in a blinded fashion.\n\nRNA was isolated from whole cells using the Qiagen microRNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and complementary DNA was reverse-transcribed using the cDNA archival kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's guidelines. All primers were obtained from Applied Biosystem. The cDNA samples were subjected to 40 cycles of amplification in an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification of relative messenger RNA expression was determined by the comparative C t (critical threshold) method as described whereby the amount of target mRNA, normalized to endogenous cycles of amplification was determined by the formula 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct .\n\nNaive T cells from wild-type, Tim3 Tg and Tim3 Tg Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were transferred into Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 recipients to induce colitis. For the analyses of transcriptional regulation, colonic infiltrating lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated at 6 weeks after T-cell transfer and immediately lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen). For RNA analysis, 100 ng of total RNA was used and hybridized to a custom designed gene CodeSet (nonenzymatic RNA profiling using bar-coded fluorescent probes) according to the manufacturers protocol (Nanostring Technologies). Barcodes were counted (1,150 fields of view per sample) on an nCounter Digital Analyzer following the manufacturer's protocol (NanoString Technologies, Inc.).\n\nTo measure cytokine production by ELISA, 1 \u00d7 10 5 CD4 + T cells were cultured in 200 \u00b5l RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 500 U ml \u22121 penicillin, 100 \u00b5g ml \u22121 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES, 1% nonessential amino acids and 50 \u00b5M 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies Invitrogen), which was termed complete RPMI 1640, in the presence of 5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 plate-bound anti-CD3 and 2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies on flat-bottom 96-well plates (Costar), at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere incubator containing 5% CO 2 for 48 h or otherwise indicated. Culture supernatants were removed and analysed for the production of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1. Cytokine concentrations were determined using specific ELISAs (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To measure cytokine production by intracellular cytokine staining on colitis-associated CD4 + T cells obtained from the dissection of mesenteric lymph nodes, lymph nodes or lamina propria were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4-6 h incomplete RPMI 1640 medium with 50 ng ml \u22121 PMA (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 ng ml \u22121 ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 \u00b5l ml \u22121 GolgiPlug (BD). Surface staining was performed for 30 min, after which the cells were resuspended in fixation/permeabilization solution (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD). Intracellular cytokine staining using antibodies as described earlier was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure cytokine production by intracellular cytokine staining in draining lymph node CD4 + or CD8 + T cells derived from CT26-tumour bearing mice, cells were stimulated with 5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 AH1-peptide (SPSYVYHQF) or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 plate-bound monoclonal antibody (mouse anti-CD3 antibody for 48 h). The cells were counterstained with monoclonal antibody against CD8-FITC with or without AH1-tetramer (Medical Biological Laboratories) which detects the MuLV gp70 peptide (SPSYVYHQF) in the context of H-2L d and analysed by flow cytometry.\n\nStudies were performed on Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare). GST-hTIM-3 protein, or GST alone as control, was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry as per the manufacturer's instructions. The coupling was performed by injecting 30 \u00b5g ml \u22121 of protein into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH5.0 (GE Healthcare). HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20; GE Healthcare) was used as running buffer and dilution buffer. Serial dilutions of analytes in HBS-EP were injected at 25 \u00b0C with a 25 \u00b5l min \u22121 flow rate and data collected over time. The surface was regenerated between different dilutions with 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH2.5 (GE Healthcare). For blockade of single-chain binding to GST-hTIM-3, single-chain hCEACAM1-hTIM-3 protein was injected alone or together with antibody (anti-human CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody, 26H7) or TIM-3-specific peptide (residues 58-77, 58-CPV FECGNVVLRTDERDVNY-77) with IgG1 mouse antibody or scrambled peptide (TLCVCFVNPYDVRVNDEREG) used as controls, respectively. All data were zero adjusted, and the reference cell value was subtracted.\n\nColonic lamina propria mononuclear cells, colonic polyp-derived TILs and subcutaneous CT26 derived TILs were isolated as follows. Total colons from each group were longitudinally cut and washed with HBSS (free of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) to remove faeces and debris. Subcutaneous CT26 tumours were dissected and dissociated in a gentle MACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Tumours, tumour-free colon pieces and CT26 tumour pieces were further finely minced and incubated in HBSS containing5 mM EDTA, 0.145 mg ml \u22121 dithiothreitol, 1 M HEPES, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min for two cycles to dissociate the epithelial monolayers. EDTA was then removed by three washes in HBSS. The colon tissue and tumour specimens then were digested in RPMI 1640 containing 0.4 mg ml \u22121 collagenase D (Roche) and 0.01 mg ml \u22121 DNase I (Roche) for 20 min (tumour-free colon pieces) or 30 min (tumour pieces) at 37 \u00b0C on a shaking platform and further digested with collagenase IV (Roche) at 0.01 mg ml \u22121 DNase I (Roche) for 20 min (tumour-free colon pieces) or 30 min (tumour pieces) at 37 \u00b0C on a shaking platform. After enzymatic treatment, digested tissue was passed through a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer and the flow-through medium containing the mononuclear cells was collected and centrifuged at 400g for10 min and pelleted and subjected to a 40:80% Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 2,500 r.p.m. at room temperature. Lamina propria mononuclear cells or TILs were collected at the interphase of the gradient, washed once, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 complete medium for further analyses.\n\nStandard two-tailed t-test was applied throughout except for the following exceptions. A Welch t-test was applied in the setting of unequal variance. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied when data were demonstrated to not follow a Gaussian distribution. In experiments where more than two groups were compared, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed followed by application of post-hoc correction using Bonferroni's multiple comparison test or Dunnett's correction followed by Friedman test. Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn's correction was used in making multiple comparisons of groups with unequal size. Comparisons of mortality were made by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis with log-rank test to assess differences in cancer survival. Pearson's coefficient for correlation (r) test was performed for comparison of variables. GraphPad Prism version 5.0b was used for calculations. P values of 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nExtended Data Figure 1 .
