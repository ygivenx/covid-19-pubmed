{"title": "Supplementary information", "body": "mosquitoes/pool at 10 dpi followed by RT-PCR analysis and ApaI digest. The relative fitness (RF) was determined as a geometric mean of the ratio between mutant and wt bands in the sample, divided by the starting ratio in the bloodmeal. RNA was extracted from the BM or 4 pools of 10 mosquitoes/pool at 10 dpi followed by RT-PCR analysis and ApaI digest. The relative fitness (RF) was determined as a geometric mean of ratio between mutant and wt bands in the sample, divided by the starting ratio of mutant and wt bands in the BM. Blue color corresponds to authentic amino acid at indicated position of strain SL07, red color corresponds to sl1 specific amino acids. Blue color corresponds to authentic amino acid at indicated position of strain SL07, red color corresponds to mutated amino acids. Blue color corresponds to authentic amino acid at indicated position of strain SL07, red color corresponds to mutated amino acids. "}
