{"title": "Genetic Variation of the Human \u03b1-2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein\n(AHSG) Gene Associated with the Risk of SARS-CoV Infection", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease resulting\nfrom the infection of a previously undescribed coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that spreads\nthrough airborne transmission [1]\u2013[3]. Rapid transmission, high infectivity and unpredictable\nclinical progression with a fatality ratio of approximately 9.6% made SARS a\nglobal threat in 2003. However, the pathogenesis of this infectious agent is still\nnot fully understood. Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV infections, which\nrepresent more than 10% of all SARS-CoV infections, have been reported in\nmany places, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Guangdong Province of China, and\nSingapore[4]\u2013[8]. Clinical and laboratory\ninvestigations have shown that the host genetic background is an important factor\nthat determines the susceptibility to and pathogenicity of SARS infection. We have\ndemonstrated that genetic haplotypes associated with low serum mannose-binding\nlectin (MBL) are also associated with SARS, and our findings were\nconfirmed by other independent studies [9], [10]. Other susceptible genes, including\nchemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) [11], interferon gamma (IFN\n\u03b3) [12], 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase 1\n(OAS) and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [13], have also been\nreported. The involvement of the major histocompatibility complex class I gene\n(HLA) [14]\u2013[16] and the L-SIGN gene (CLEC4M) [17]\u2013[19] are still\ndisputed.\n\nSeveral reports have suggested that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, which is\nexpressed at the early stage of viral infection and detectable in the serum [20], is associated\nwith severe pulmonary inflammation by inducing massive pro-inflammatory cytokine\nproduction [21]\u2013[23]. In an effort to elucidate this mechanism, human cellular\nproteins that interact with the nucleocapsid protein were screened by a yeast\ntwo-hybrid assay in our laboratory. The translation elongation factor 1\u03b1 (EEF1A)\n[24], cytochrome\np450 subfamily 4F polypeptide 3 (CYP4F3, Gene ID 4051, GenBank ID NG_007964.1) and\nalpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG, Gene ID 197, GenBank ID NG_011436.1) were found to\ninteract with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (Unpublished\ndata).\n\nAHSG is required for macrophage deactivation by endogenous cations. Low serum AHSG\nlevels may cause the uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines [25], [26]. Mice\ndeficient in AHSG showed hypersensitivity to LPS-induced inflammation [27]. Cytochrome P450\nFamily 3A (CYP4F3A) is an \u03c9-oxidase that inactivates the\npotent inflammatory factor Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human neutrophils and the liver\n[28]. LTB4 is\nlikely a major determining factor in tissue damage because it can amplify the\ninflammatory reaction by recruiting leukocytes and inducing their degranulation,\nwhich makes the removal of excess LTB4 important for the prevention of immunologic\ndamage [29].\nConsidering that CYP4F3 and AHSG are involved in innate immunity and inflammatory\nprocesses, we investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these\ngenes were associated with susceptibility to viral infection.\n\nWe previously noted in a yeast two-hybrid analysis that SARS-Cov nucleocapsid\nprotein associates with CYP4F3A, EEF1A and AHSG (data not shown).\nTo substantiate the interaction between SARS-Cov N and AHSG, human serum was\nincubated with GST or GST-N fusion proteins. The adsorbates were analyzed by\nimmunoblotting with anti-AHSG antibody. It was demonstrated that AHSG binds to\nGST-N, but not GST (\nFigure\n1\n).\n\nWe obtained peripheral blood or serum samples from SARS patients who were\ndiagnosed by WHO standards from two different cities in China. Of the SARS\npatients, 67 were from the Eighth People's Hospital in southern China City,\nGuangzhou, and 624 were from Xiaotangshan Hospital (a hospital temporarily set\nup to fight SARS in Beijing, China) or Ditan Hospital (Beijing, China). All of\nthe SARS samples were collected during the 2003 SARS epidemic. Analysis by ELISA\nand IFA confirmed all SARS patients to be seropositive for anti-SARS antibodies,\nand the specificity of the ELISA assay was higher than 99% [20], [30], [31]. For\ncomparison, we obtained two groups of control samples from Guangzhou (192\npeople) and Beijing (791 people). The Guangzhou control samples were collected\nduring the 2003 SARS epidemic while the Beijing control samples were collected\nafter the epidemic. All samples were collected from people who had never\ndeveloped SARS. To assess the influence of the exposure, blood samples from\nhealth care workers (HCW) that worked in SARS wards in the Second Affiliated\nHospital of Senyaxian Medical School in 2003 were obtained. Of these samples, 40\nwere from HCW who developed SARS during the course of hospital duty and 122 were\nfrom health care workers free of the disease. DNA was extracted from all the\nsamples selected. All cases and controls were Han Chinese. We selected enough\nsamples to perform three progressive case-control studies.\n\nChi-square tests were carried out to evaluate whether the cases and controls of\nthe three studies were matched. We found that the cases and controls from\nBeijing were well matched for sex and age, while there were more females in the\ncase cohort of the Guangzhou non-HCW population. Most of the HCW population was\ncomposed of female nurses between the ages of 16 and 30 (\nTable 1\n).\n\nWe downloaded the SNP genotype data for CHB+JPT (version 2) from the HapMap\ndatabase and built a linkage disequilibrium (LD) map of AHSG\nwith the Haploview software (version 4.0). The pairwise tagging algorithm\nimplemented in the Tagger program of Haploview (r2 threshold was 0.8)\nwas used to select the tag SNPs for assessment. SNPs that were reported to\naffect the AHSG level or that had been associated with other diseases were also\nselected. Finally, we chose to genotype rs2248690 (5\u2032-flanking region),\nrs2077119 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs4917 (exon 6), rs2593813 (intron 1) and\nrs4918 (exon 7) in the AHSG gene. The genotyping and statistical results are\npresented in Table S1 and Table\nS2 under the dominant and additive models, respectively.\nThe genotyping and statistical analyses of the Guangzhou non-HCW population\nrevealed that two tag SNPs were associated with SARS. The rs2248690\nTT/AT genotype was more associated with increased\nsusceptibility to SARS than the AA genotype\n(OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.30\u20134.51; \nTable 2\n\nand Table\nS1). The TT/CT genotype of rs4917 was\nassociated with an increased possibility of developing clinically apparent SARS\n(OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.02\u20133.34; \nTable 3\n\n\nand Table\nS1). In the validation study (Beijing population), only\nthe rs2248690 polymorphism was significantly associated with SARS development\n(relative to the TT/AT genotype, 1.63; 95% CI,\n1.30\u20132.04; \nTable\n2\n\n and Table S1). Because the Beijing and\nGuangzhou sample groups had homogenous demographic and genetic parameters (Han\nChinese), a joint analysis was performed. The combined analysis of the two\nstudies under the dominant model is presented in Table\nS3. After combining data from the two cohorts, the\nTT/AT genotype of rs2248690 had a frequency of 27.5%\nin the control population and a significantly higher frequency of 39.1%\nin the SARS patients (OR = 1.70; 95% CI,\n1.37\u20132.09; \nTable\n2\n\n and Table S3). After adjusting for sex\nand age, a non-significant association was observed between rs4917 and SARS\nsusceptibility (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02\u20131.54;\nP = 0.08). Because rs4917 and\nrs2248690 are in high linkage disequilibrium (0.62), the association between\nrs4917 and SARS can be easily understood. A logistic regression analysis was\napplied to adjust the linkage between rs4917 and rs2248690. The result showed\nthat rs2248690 was associated with SARS development\n(OR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16\u20132.17;\np = 0.004), while rs4917 was not\nassociated with SARS (p = 0.54). To remove\nthe influence of the exposure factor to SARS infection and risk, cases and\ncontrols from the HCW population were genotyped at rs2248690. Though the\nP-value is higher than 0.05, the distribution of different\ngenotypes between the HCW cases and HCW controls is similar to the distribution\nbetween the non-HCW cases and non-HCW controls with a difference of\napproximately 10%. The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype\ndata from all cases and HCW controls confirmed this finding\n(OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.38\u20132.06; \nTable 4\n). We\ntested the deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and\ncontrols, within each cohort and within the overall study population; we found\nthat there was no statistically significant deviation from equilibrium for any\nSNP.\n\nBased on these results, we conclude that the TT/AT genotype of\nrs2248690 is associated with the increased likelihood of developing SARS, while\nthe AA genotype is associated with protection against SARS.\n\nAHSG is a serum protein, and it has been reported that there is an association\nbetween AHSG polymorphisms (rs4917 and rs4918) and AHSG serum\nconcentration levels [32], [33]. However, no convincing multivariate analysis has\nbeen performed to identify the most associated variants. To uncover potential\nfunctional changes associated with the AHSG rs2248690\npolymorphism, 192 healthy subjects from Beijing were genotyped, and their AHSG\nserum concentrations were determined. As expected, there was an association\nbetween the rs2248690 genotype and the AHSG serum concentrations (\nTable 5\n). The\norder of the average AHSG serum concentrations was as follows:\n\u2212799AA >\u2212799AT\n>\u2212799TT. Consistently, rs4917 and rs4918 were\nassociated with different serum levels of AHSG. Furthermore, a stepwise\nregression analysis clearly showed that rs2248690 was an independent contributor\nto the variability in AHSG serum concentration (\nTable 5\n). These results show\nthat LD with rs2248690 causes the association of rs4917 with AHSG serum\nconcentration.\n\nBecause rs2248690 is located in the promoter region of the AHSG gene (\u2212799\nbp upstream of the transcription start site), various alleles of this SNP may\nyield phenotypic differences in AHSG transcription levels. It\nhas been reported that the A allele of rs2248690 has a reduced binding affinity\nfor transcription factor AP1 [34], which is a repressor of AHSG expression [35], [36]. We\nobserved allele-associated differences in the AHSG\npromoter's transcriptional activity in two different cell lines using a\nluciferase assay. The sequence that contained \u2212799T,\nwhich is overrepresented in SARS patients, showed significantly lower promoter\nactivity (\nFigure\n2\n).\n\nWe also built an LD map of CYP4F3 and selected five tag SNPs for\nassessment (Table S1, Table\nS2 and Table S3). In the non-HCW\nGuangzhou population, the rs3794987 GG/AG genotype was\nassociated with an increased susceptibility to SARS\n(OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.10\u20133.68). However, the\nresults of this association were not replicated in the Beijing population. The\ncombined analysis of the two studies does not show any association of the\nCYP4F3 SNPs analyzed with SARS susceptibility.\n\nAfter the interaction between AHSG and the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was\nidentified and validated, we chose AHSG as a candidate gene in\nsubsequent case-control analyses. We found an association between one SNP in\nAHSG (rs2248690) and the development of SARS in two separate\ncase-control studies as well as in the combined analysis of both studies after\nadjusting for age and sex. Considering the exposure factor, the intercomparison of\nthe HCW-controls and the other cases validated the association we observed between\nrs2248690 and SARS disease because the HCW-controls, who had worked in SARS wards,\nwere exposed to SARS-CoV at least as much as the other cases. Additionally, this\npolymorphism, which was located in the promoter of AHSG, affects\nAHSG serum levels by altering the transcriptional activity. The genotype that\nconferred protection against SARS, rs2248690 AA, is associated with\nhigher AHSG serum levels.\n\nOur case-control studies included 1833 individuals and revealed a significant\nassociation between rs2248690 and the SARS disease. More specifically, individuals\nwith the AA genotype have a 41% lower risk of developing\nSARS than those with the TT/AT genotype. The rs2248690 SNP is\nlocated in the 5\u2032 flanking region of AHSG at position\n\u2212799 within the promoter region. We have shown that this variant affects AHSG\nserum levels by altering transcriptional activity. Other SNPs in the\nAHSG, such as rs4917 and rs4918, have also been shown to be\nassociated with AHSG serum levels and diseases affected by AHSG serum levels [33]. In this study,\nwe demonstrated that rs2248690 is the dominant factor affecting AHSG\nconcentration.\n\nAHSG is a circulating negative inflammatory acute-phase glycoprotein. The\npathophysiological sequence of infection is mediated by macrophage-derived\npro-inflammatory cytokines. The current literature suggests that the availability of\nAHSG to macrophages is critical in regulating the innate immune response in tissue\ninjury and infection because AHSG is required for macrophage deactivation by\nendogenous cations [37]. Decreased levels of human fetuin have been observed in\npatients with acute lymphocytic Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,\nrheumatoid arthritis, acute alcoholic hepatitis and trauma [28], [38]\u2013[41]. Under conditions where\nmacrophage-associated fetuin levels are decreased, macrophage deactivation by\nendogenous counter-regulators may be impaired, leading to the uncontrolled\noverproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [29], [38]. A recent work showed that\nmice deficient in AHSG are hypersensitive to LPS-induced inflammation [27]. Because the\ndevelopment of SARS is always associated with a severe inflammatory reaction, low\nAHSG serum levels could result in severe symptoms after a SARS-CoV infection.\nConsidering that there might be many asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections in the control\ngroup, it is plausible that relatively higher serum concentrations of AHSG can\norchestrate an unimpaired counter-regulation between macrophage deactivation and\nendogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, viruses can be cleared without\nsevere inflammation and obvious symptoms. However, we observed that AHSG interacts\nwith the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (\nFigure 1\n), which may induce massive pro-inflammatory\ncytokine production upon infection [21]. AHSG may neutralize the pro-inflammatory effect of the\nSARS nucleocapsid protein because AHSG is so abundant in the serum (0.2\u20130.55\nmg/ml). Considering that AHSG is a circulating glycoprotein synthesized in human\nliver tissue and the nucleocapsid protein is \u201cwrapped\u201d by membrane\nproteins in the SARS-CoV virion, interactions between AHSG and the nucleocapsid\nprotein are less likely to affect the viral infectivity and replication of the\nSARS-CoV.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study reporting an association of\nAHSG polymorphisms with SARS. Individuals with polymorphisms\nthat contribute to high concentrations of AHSG may be less likely to develop SARS.\nThese findings improve our understanding of SARS pathogenesis and provide a genetic\nbasis for SARS prognosis. Future studies should further investigate the mechanisms\nof AHSG-based resistance to SARS and other infectious diseases.\n\nWritten, informed consent was obtained from all of the participants or their\nguardians; genetic analysis was covered in the consent. This study was performed\nwith the approval of the Ethics Committees of all the hospitals from which\nsamples were obtained and it was also approved by the the Ethics Committees of\nChinese National Human Genome Center, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and\nBeijing Proteome Research Center. The study was conducted according to the\nprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nThe first case-control study was performed to evaluate potential associations\nbetween AHSG and CYP4F3 polymorphisms with\nSARS. The second case-control study was performed to confirm the findings from\nthe first study. The HCW case-control study was used to evaluate the influence\nof the exposure rate and to reconfirm the findings of positively associated\nSNPs. The association of the AHSG genotype and AHSG serum\nconcentrations was evaluated in 192 healthy Beijing Han Chinese.\n\nSerum samples from 67 SARS patients diagnosed by WHO standards were collected\nfrom the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou in 2003. Analysis by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent assay (IFA)\nconfirmed that all of the SARS patients were seropositive for SARS antibodies.\nThe specificity of the ELISA assay was higher than 99% [20], [30], [31]. Serum samples\nfrom 192 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls were collected from healthy\npeople in Guangzhou during the same period. All cases and controls were Han\nChinese.\n\nBlood samples from 624 patients diagnosed by WHO standards were collected from\nXiaotangshan Hospital (a hospital temporarily set up to fight SARS in Beijing,\nChina) and Ditan Hospital (Beijing, China) during the SARS epidemic in 2003. All\nSARS patients selected were confirmed to be seropositive by both an\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescent assay (IFA)\n[20], [30], [31]. Information\nregarding sex, ethnic status, and age at SARS diagnosis was recorded. A total of\n791 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched adults were recruited as control subjects\nafter the 2003 SARS epidemic, and none of these control subjects ever developed\nSARS (\nTable\n1\n). Of these samples, 352 infected patients (from Xiaotangshan\nHospital) and 410 controls were from the BPRC (Beijing Proteome Research Center)\nof China and were previously employed in a study that showed no association\nbetween CLEC4M homozygosity and protection against SARS\ncoronavirus [18].\nAll cases and controls were Han Chinese. The remaining 272 samples of SARS\npatients were collected from the Ditan Hospital.\n\nBlood samples were obtained from 40 health care workers that developed SARS\nduring the course of hospital duty and 122 health care workers who had worked in\nSARS wards but remained free of the disease. All of these HCW workers worked in\nSARS wards in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Senyaxian Medical School in\n2003. Information regarding sex and age was recorded. The HCW cases and controls\nwere Han Chinese.\n\nBlood samples from 192 healthy Beijing Chinese were collected from the 307\nHospital of PLA (People's Liberation Army) in Beijing, and sera were\ncollected. Serum AHSG levels were assessed by ELISA, and the rs2248690 loci were\ngenotyped as described below.\n\nPeripheral blood samples were obtained from Guangzhou HCW and Beijing cohorts. A\ntotal of 200 \u00b5l of each blood sample was mixed and incubated with\n1\u00d7RBC lysis buffer (1.5 M ammonium chloride, 100 mM potassium bicarbonate\nand 10 mM EDTA). Subsequently, the lymphocytes were obtained by centrifugation.\nSerum samples were obtained from the Guangzhou non-HCW cases and controls.\nGenomic DNA from all the peripheral blood leukocytes and plasma samples was\nextracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored\nat \u221220\u00b0C. The resulting DNA was quantified using a standard\nspectrophotometric reading on a DU 650 spectrophotometer (Beckman\nCoulter,Fullerton, CA). Each sample was diluted to a final concentration of 10\nng/ml.\n\nFor the association study, we downloaded the SNP genotype data for CHB+JPT\n(version 2) from the HapMap database and built LD maps of these two genes with\nthe Haploview software. A pairwise tagging algorithm implemented in the Tagger\nprogram of Haploview (with an r2 threshold of 0.8) was used to select\nthe tag SNPs. SNPs that were reported to affect AHSG/CYP4F3 levels or had been\nassociated with other diseases were also selected. Finally, we chose to genotype\nrs2248690 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs2077119 (5\u2032-flanking region),\nrs4917 (exon 6), rs2593813 (intron 1), and rs4918 (exon 7) in the AHSG gene. The\nCYP4F3 gene has more than 30 SNPs in three linkage\ndisequilibrium blocks. We chose rs3794987 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs1159776\n(5\u2032-flanking region), rs4646519 (intron 11), and rs1290625 (intron 2) for\ngenotyping.\n\nGenotyping was completed using the SNPstream ultra-high throughput genotyping\nsystem (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Briefly, the method combines solution-phase multiplex single\nnucleotide extension (SNE) with a solid-phase sorting of labeled SNE primers by\nhybridization to a chip that contains 384 4\u00d74 arrays of 12 oligonucleotide\ntags and 4 oligonucleotides for positive and negative controls. Each SNE primer\ncontained 1 of the 20 oligonucleotide tags at its 5\u2032 end, and the SNE\nreactions were performed in 12-plex. The microarray plate was imaged using a SNP\nscope reader (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The two-color system allowed the\ndetection of the SNP by comparing the signals from the two fluorescent dyes. The\nimage signals were subsequently transferred to genotyping software that\ntranslated the images of the arrays into genotype calls. The error rate\n(0\u20131.2%) was determined by DNA sequencing (3730, Applied Biosystem\nInc) for 10% of the SNPs examined in the present study.\n\nChi-square tests were used to compare the genotypic frequencies and demographic\ndistributions between the cases and controls. The exact test was applied to\nevaluate whether the population was in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium by the\nMarkov chain method; P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant. The tag SNPs were chosen on a pairwise basis, and the linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) calculation was performed on a confidence interval (CI)\nbasis using the Haploview 4.0 software.\n\nFisher's exact test and multivariate unconditional logistic regression were\nused to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios for each sex and age\ncategory. The odds ratio and a 95% CI were used to measure the strength\nof association in the genetic risk association study. The additive and dominant\nmodels were used for this analysis. In the additive model, each SNP was\ngenotyped and separated into three categories with the homozygous major allele\ngenotype chosen as the reference group. For the dominant model, each SNP was\nmodeled as a dichotomous variable with the homozygous major allele genotype as\nthe reference group and the other two genotypes combined into one category.\n\nANOVA and stepwise multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify\nthe SNPs associated with AHSG serum levels. These statistical analyses were\nperformed using SAS (version 8.0).\n\nSerum AHSG concentrations were measured in 192 subjects by ELISA. Briefly, the\nsera were diluted 10,000-fold and pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate\nwhose surfaces were coated with polyclonal anti-human AHSG antibodies (R&D).\nAfter incubation, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated polyclonal anti-human\nAHSG antibodies were added to the wells. Following the incubation and washing\nsteps, the absorbance was measured using an automated plate reader at 450 nm.\nThe concentrations of the diluted sera were read from the standard curve of\nhuman AHSG, and the concentrations of the experimental samples were calculated.\nAll samples were measured in parallel and in duplicate. The intra- and\ninter-assay coefficients of variations were below 10%. The statistical\nanalyses were done using ANOVA.\n\nTwo reporter plasmids encompassing \u22121091 to +22 bp of the human AHSG\npromoter were generated by PCR from two genomic DNA samples with either\n\u2212799A OR -799T, using the primers P1:\n5\u2032-cgcagatctGGTCTCCATGAGAGGGCTTC-3\u2032 and P2:\n5\u2032-cgcaagcttCAGGCGTGCAGGTGGTTG-3\u2032, respectively. The PCR product was\ndigested with BglII and HindIII and ligated into a pGL3-basic promoter-probing\nvector (Promega) containing the firefly luciferase gene as a reporter. The\nconstructs were sequenced to ensure correct cloning.\n\nHepG2 and HL7702 cells were seeded at 1\u00d7105 cells per well,\nrespectively, in 12-well plates and transfected with pGL3-basic (a promoterless\ncontrol) or pGL3-basic containing a particular allele of the\nAHSG promoter. The pRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega) was\ncotransfected as a normalizing control. All transfections were carried out in\ntriplicate. At 24 h post-incubation, the cells were collected and analyzed for\nluciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).\nThe data shown represent three independent experiments performed in triplicate.\nThe statistical analyses were performed using the Student's\nt-test.\n\nFor the GST pull-down experiments, human serum were incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C\nwith 5 \u00b5g of purified GST or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione\nbeads (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The adsorbates were\nwashed with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.\nPurified AHSG protein was included as a loading control."}
