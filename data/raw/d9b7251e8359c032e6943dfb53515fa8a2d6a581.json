The specificity of these two types of sulfation as TGN modifications has been exploited to selectively label marker molecules for both the constitutive and regulated pathway of secretion as they pass through the TGN, and to detect their exit from the TGN . Cells of the neuroendocrine line PC 12 contain two major tyrosinesulfated proteins, chromogranin B (secretogranin I) and secretogranin II (Sgll) that have been shown to be efficiently targeted to secretory granules (Lee and Huttner, 1983; Rosa et al., 1985; Rosa et al. } 1989; Gerdes et al, 1989) . These characteristics make chromogranin B and Sgll ideal markers for the regulated secretory pathway. PC 12 cells also synthesize one major heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hsPg) (Schubert et al., 1988; Gowda et al., 1989) , that can be used as a marker for the constitutive pathway of secretion: it is excluded from secretory granules and its secretion is blocked at 20\u00b0C . The latter property has been shown to be a hallmark for proteins traveling by the constitutive pathway (Matlin and Simons, 1983) . Furthermore, sulfate labeling of secretogranins and the hsPg can be used to selectively monitor their post-TGN transport via the regulated and constitutive pathway, respectively. For this purpose, however, it is essential to separate ISGs and CSVs from the TGN and from each other, for instance, by physical separation of these cellular compartments. An outline for a method to achieve this follows.\n\nTo biochemically identify ISGs and CSVs, and to separate them from their donor compartment, the TGN, the following method has been designed Tooze and Huttner, 1992) . PC 12 cells are pulselabeled for 5 min with [ 35 S]sulfate, with or without subsequent chase, and then homogenized. Given the time needed for sulfate uptake and activation, plus translocation of activated sulfate (approximately 2 min; Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) , this allows for an effective labeling time of about 3 min. With the use of velocity-controlled sucrose gradient centrifugation, organelles in the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) prepared from the [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled cells are then fractionated to separate the TGN from post-TGN secretory vesicles, and the distribution of the sulfate-labeled marker proteins across the gradient is analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in conjunction with fluorography.\n\nWhen no chase has been performed, this procedure yields a single peak of labeled proteins, including Sgll and hsPg, in the bottom half of the gradient, coinciding with the peak of the TGN marker enzyme, sialyl transferase . [In general, chromogranin B is not analyzed as a marker for the regulated pathway because its migration on SDS-PAGE partly overlaps with that of the constitutively secreted hsPg .] This shows that after a 5-min [ 35 S]sulfate pulse, the marker proteins are still present in the TGN. After a 15-min chase, however, most of the labeled Sgll and hsPg is found in the top half of the gradient. Apparently, the labeled proteins leave the TGN during this period and are then present in vesicles which, due to their smaller size, sediment more slowly than the TGN. The formation of post-TGN vesicles occurs rapidly, with a half-time of approximately 5 min .\n\nOn exit from the TGN, sulfate-labeled Sgll and hsPg are packaged directly in two distinct classes of post-TGN vesicles, the ISGs and CSVs . These two populations can be separated from one another on the basis of their different buoyant densities in sucrose. For this purpose, vesicle-containing fractions from the velocity gradient just described are subjected to a second, equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation. Because ISGs (characterized by dense cores) have a significantly greater density than CSVs, this procedure yields two distinct peaks of labeled proteins: one higher in the gradient, containing the sulfate-labeled hsPg in CSVs, and one lower in the gradient, containing the sulfate-labeled Sgll in ISGs .\n\nTo allow detailed investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying post-TGN vesicle formation, a cell-free system has been developed . This system is based on the ability to monitor bio-chemically the transport and sorting of Sgll and hsPg from the TGN to ISGs and CSVs, respectively. Protein sorting to the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways is reconstituted in vitro when a PNS, derived from PC 12 cells pulse-labeled with [ 35 S]sulfate, is prepared in an iso-osmotic, low-ionic strength, sucrose-containing buffer at neutral pH and then supplemented with ATP and an ATP-regenerating system . The two types of post-TGN vesicles formed in the cell-free system were found to have similar properties to CSVs and ISGs formed in vivo. Unlike most existing cell-free transport assays (for review, see Goda and Pfeffer, 1989) , this system measures only the formation of vesicles and not the transfer of a defined marker protein from a donor to an acceptor compartment, which is a multistep process involving both vesicle formation and vesicle fusion.\n\nProteins that bind GTP fulfill a wide range of regulatory functions in all cell types (Bourne et al., 1990) . A feature that many of these proteins share is the ability to undergo a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis, during which they switch from an inactive (GDP-bound) to an active (GTP-bound) conformational state (Wittinghofer and Pai, 1991) . In the case of the small ras-like GTP-binding proteins of the mammalian rab family, which have been implicated in vesicle fusion, it has been postulated that they form part of a proofreading machinery that ensures the correct targeting of vesicles to the appropriate acceptor membrane (for reviews, see Bourne, 1988; Balch, 1990; Goud and McCaffrey, 1991; Pfeffer, 1992) . As will be discussed in detail, recent work indicates that GTP-binding proteins are also involved in vesicle formation, and that, in fact, several distinct classes of such proteins participate in this process.\n\nAn important finding obtained with the cell-free system derived from PC 12 cells described in the previous section was that the formation of secretory vesicles from the TGN was inhibited by nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP , implying that GTP hydrolysis is required for this pro-cess. It was shown that the formation of both ISGs and CSVs is inhibited by GTP7S. Another nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMP-PMP, also inhibited the formation of post-Golgi vesicles, albeit much less effectively than GTP7S on a molar basis. This is in agreement with previous findings on the relative effects of GMP-PNP and GTP7S on cell-free intra-Golgi vesicle traffic (Melan\u00e7on et al., 1987) . The inhibition of post-TGN vesicle formation by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs was largely prevented by the addition of excess GTP and was specific with respect to the guanine moiety, as a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATP7S did not affect the formation of either class of post-TGN vesicles .\n\nWith regard to the kinetics of cell-free vesicle formation in the presence of GTP7S, the following observations were made. After 60 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of GTP7S, formation of ISGs was inhibited by approximately 40% and that of CSVs by approximately 80%. After 120 min, the inhibition of formation of both vesicle classes was about 50% . For CSVs, this is in agreement with data on the kinetics of inhibition by GTP7S of vesicle formation from other donor membranes (see Section II,C).\n\nTrimeric G proteins, unlike the small ras-like GTPases (Kahn, 1991) , are known to be affected by [AIF 4 ]~ (Higashijima et al., 1991) . In the presence of GDP, this compound activates both inhibitory and stimulatory G proteins by mimicking the 7-phosphate group of GTP (Higashijima et al., 1991) . Using the cell-free system derived from PC 12 cells, it was found that 40 \u03bc\u039c [AIF 4 ] -, but not A1C1 3 or KF, inhibited the formation of ISGs and CSVs to the same extent as 10 \u03bc\u039c GTP7S (Barr et al., 1991) . Given the specificity of [AIF 4 ] ~, this was interpreted as being indicative of a role for trimeric G proteins in the regulation of post-TGN vesicle formation. Moreover, as both GTP7S and [AIF 4 ]~ activate trimeric G proteins, it was inferred that such proteins exert, directly or indirectly, an inhibitory effect on vesicle formation.\n\nTo test this putative role of trimeric G proteins, the effect of purified G protein \u00df7 subunits on cell-free vesicle formation has been investigated (Barr et al., 1991) . The rationale for these experiments was based on the observations that \u00df7 subunits exert the opposite effect to nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues on the activation state of G protein a subunits (for reviews, see Gilman, 1987; Taylor, 1990; Birnbaumer et al., 1990) . This is presumably the result of a shift in the association equilibrium between the a and \u00df7 subunits toward the trimeric, inactive form. Indeed, it was found that \u00df7 subunits stimulated the exit of the constitutive and regulated secretory marker proteins from the TGN in a manner that was directly proportional to the amount of subunits added (Barr et al., 1991) . Interestingly, the fold stimulation of exit from the TGN was greater for the hsPg, the constitutive secretory marker (4fold at 400 nM \u00df7), than for Sgll, the regulated secretory marker (2.5-fold at 400 nM \u00df7). In addition, it was found that the sorting of Sgll into ISGs is perturbed by \u00df7 subunits (400 nM), resulting in the packaging of approximately 40% of Sgll into vesicles with a buoyant density characteristic of CSVs. The packaging of hsPg into CSVs was not altered under these conditions. These findings may reflect differences in the mechanisms by which these two classes of vesicles form, or in the way in which their formation is regulated by trimeric G proteins.\n\nThe ADP-ribosylating toxins of Vibrio cholerae and Bordetella pertussis have been extensively used to characterize and distinguish trimeric G proteins. Cholera toxin is known to specifically ribosylate the a subunit of G s (Cassel and Pfeuffer, 1978) , while pertussis toxin acts on the a subunit of G i and G 0 (for review, see Kaziro et al., 1991) . Accordingly, these toxins were employed to identify the G protein(s) regulating post-TGN vesicle formation. The approach used was to carry out toxin-dependent ADP ribosylation in a PC12-derived PNS under the conditions of cell-free vesicle formation, and then to analyse the distribution of ADP-ribosylated proteins using velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation (Barr et al., 1991 ) . In the presence of pertussis toxin, an approximately 40 kDa protein was ADP-ribosylated, which on velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation was detected in two peaks; one in the top three fractions of the gradient, which are known to contain various subcellular organelles including post-TGN vesicles and plasma membrane (R\u00e9gnier-Vigouroux et al, 1991) , and the other in the lower part of the gradient known to contain TGN membranes . The latter material was found to colocalize with the TGN on subsequent equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation. No ADP-ribosylated a subunit comigrating with the TGN was observed when cholera toxin was used (Barr et al., 1991) . The conclusion drawn from these data was that a Gctj or Ga 0 , or both, is present on TGN membranes of PC 12 cells. In line with previous reports by other investigators (Ercolani et al., 1990; Stow et al., 1991) , the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein on PC 12 cell TGN membranes is likely to be G i3 .\n\nIf pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins regulate vesicle formation, one might expect that pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation prior to cell-free vesicle formation reduces the inhibition by GTP7S of this process. It has been shown that after ADP ribosylation by pertussis toxin, G protein a subunits are unable to interact with receptors, and thus are able to only undergo the basal, but not the receptor-mediated, GDP/GTP exchange (Birnbaumer et al, 1990) . ADP ribosylation by pertussis toxin therefore reduces the activation of a subunits. Preliminary experiments indeed showed that pertussis toxincatalyzed ADP ribosylation partially prevents the inhibition of post-TGN vesicle formation by GTP7S (Barr et al., 1991) .\n\nWork by other investigators also shows that heterotrimeric G proteins regulate secretory protein traffic through the Golgi complex and is consistent with the notion that this regulation occurs, at least in part, at the level of secretory vesicle formation. Thus, the G protein a subunit a i3 , which is present in virtually all cell types (Kaziro et al., 1991) , has been localized to the Golgi complex (Ercolani et al., 1990; Stow et al., 1991) . Overexpression of this a subunit was found to inhibit the constitutive secretion of an hsPg in LLC-PK1 cells (Stow et al., 1991) . In addition, a stimulation of hsPg secretion was observed after exposure of the cells to pertussis toxin, the conclusion being that G i3 had become inactivated (Stow et al., 1991) . Taken together, it appears that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins function as part of a signal transducing machinery in the Golgi, mediating an inhibition of vesicle formation.\n\nTrimeric G protein-mediated signal transduction pathways need not be restricted to Golgi membranes, but may operate on other endomembranes as well, and may involve other G proteins in addition to the pertussis toxinsensitive ones. 1 Possibly, endomembrane signal transduction, in analogy to signal transduction at the plasma membrane (for review, see Gilman, 1987) , involves a receptor of the seven transmembrane domain type. At present, we can only speculate on the function of signal transduction processes in vesicle formation; they could, for example, pass information about the lumenal content of an organelle to a cytoplasmic effector system, or they could function in the retention of organelle-specific resident proteins (Machamer, 1991) .\n\nThe conclusion that GTP hydrolysis is required for vesicle formation has been confirmed and extended by a more recent report that indicates that GTP hydrolysis plays a role in the formation of transport vesi-cles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In a cell-free system derived from yeast, this process has been found to be inhibited by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues (Rexach and Schekman, 1991) . The kinetics of inhibition by GTP7S of post-ER vesicle formation in the yeast cell-free system were similar to those observed for the formation of CVSs . In the yeast system, too, the degree of inhibition decreased at longer times of incubation. The similarity between the effects of GTP7S in the two cell-free systems supports the idea that GTP-binding proteins carry out a similar role in vesicle formation throughout the secretory pathway.\n\nFurther work in the yeast cell-free system revealed that at least part of the requirement for GTP hydrolysis reflected the involvement of the small ras-like GTP-binding protein Sari (d 'Enfert et al., 1991) . Moreover, small ras-like GTP-binding proteins of the mammalian ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) family have been found to be among the components of the nonclathrin coat of intra-Golgi transport vesicles, referred to as coat proteins (Serafini et al., 1991) . Although no direct link between nonclathrin coat assembly and vesicle formation has yet to be reported, the interaction of two coat proteins, ARF and \u00df-COP (Duden et al., 1991) , with Golgi membranes is affected under conditions known to inhibit vesicle formation, such as the presence of GTP7S (Donaldson et al, 1991a,b; Serafini et al., 1991) . This points toward an involvement of ARF in vesicle formation, a suggestion consistent with the observation that a yeast mutant for ARF is defective in invertase secretion (Steams et al., 1990) . Since the yeast GTP-binding protein Sari is homologous to mammalian ARF (Nakano and Muramatsu, 1989) , it is tempting to speculate that in general, small ras-like GTP-binding proteins of the ARF/Sari family are involved in vesicle formation by regulating coat assembly at the level of the donor membrane, and that this regulation is mediated via GTP binding and hydrolysis.\n\nStudies on the shibire mutant of Drosophila melanogaster led to the identification of another class of GTP-binding proteins that may be involved in vesicle formation. The shibire mutant was originally identified as a mutant with alterations in the structure of the neuromuscular junction leading to paralysis (Poodry and Edgar, 1979) . In this mutant the primary defect is at the level of endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, which are unable to bud from the plasma membrane (Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983) . The shibire gene has recently been cloned and sequenced (van der Bliek and Meyerowitz, 1991) . The corre-sponding protein was found to be a homologue of rat dynamin (Chen et al., 1991) , a 100 kDa microtubule-binding protein with GTPase activity able to induce microtubule mobility in vitro (Shpetner and Vall\u00e9e, 1989) . Together, these findings raise the possibility that GTP-binding motor proteins such as dynamin may be involved in the scission of endocytotic vesicles from the plasma membrane.\n\nSeveral observations suggest that such a role for these proteins need not be restricted to vesicle formation from the plasma membrane. Dynamin as well as the shibire gene product show homology to the yeast Vpsl protein, which is involved in protein sorting from the TGN to the vacuole and is a putative GTPase (Rothman et al., 1990) . Clathrin is thought to be involved not only in endocytosis, but also in the formation of vesicles from the TGN, which deliver lysosomal enzymes bound to mannose-6-phosphate receptors to endosomes (Kornfeld, 1987) . In addition, patches of clathrin have been found on ISGs (Tooze and Tooze, 1986) , and a species of clathrin light chain (LC b ) is enriched in cells and tissues with the regulated secretory pathway (Acton and Brodsky, 1990) . If there indeed exists a clathrin-dependent mechanism for vesicle formation from the TGN, it is conceivable that this mechanism would employ a motor protein like dynamin, and therefore, GTP hydrolysis in the final scission event. By analogy, one may speculate on the existence of a similar GTP-binding protein as part of the \"scission machinery\" that operates in the nonclathrin-dependent mechanism of vesicle formation.\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the formation of vesicles from a donor compartment is a complex cascade of events. Given the distinct classes of GTP-binding proteins that appear to be involved in the overall process of vesicle formation, it is likely, but not proven, that these proteins exert functions in several of the individual steps in vesicle formation. In which step and how do these proteins act? In the following sections, various possibilities are discussed concerning secretory vesicle formation from the TGN.\n\nFrom the data previously described (Barr et al., 1991 ; Stow et al., 1991 ; see also footnote 1 and Leyte et al., 1992) , it appears that secretory vesicle formation from Golgi membranes is under negative control mediated by G i3 .\n\nAn inhibitory mechanism for the exit of constitutive and regulated secretory proteins from the TGN might be related to the obvious requirement for a regulatory system that prevents vesicles forming from the TGN unless appropriate cargo is available. Such a system might regulate the rate of vesicle formation to ensure, for example, (1) that secretory proteins destined to undergo post-translational modifications [e.g., sialylation (Roth et al., 1985) and tyrosine sulfation (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) ] only leave the TGN after having acquired these modifications, which can be crucial for the fate of a protein (e.g., Ley te et al., 1991) ; or (2) that regulated secretory proteins only leave the TGN after having been segregated via aggregation (Chanat and Huttner, 1991) from constitutive secretory proteins. The lack of completion of these process might somehow be monitored by a transmembrane receptor, for instance by recognition of unmodified sites for posttranslational modification or of nonaggregated regulated secretory proteins. Such a putative transmembrane receptor might then interact with a trimeric G protein, stimulating GDP-GTP exchange on the G protein a subunit and hence promoting its activation. The activated a subunit in turn presumably interacts with an effector on the cytoplasmic side of the TGN membrane (see Fig. 1 ). Until the activated a subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP, this effector will either reduce vesicle formation below the normal rate, or be prevented from maintaining vesicle formation at the normal rate. In this regard, it is interesting to Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of a signal transduction machinery in the membrane of the trans-Golgi network involved in the regulation of vesicle formation. X, ligand; R, receptor; R*, activated receptor; \u03b1, \u03b2, and y, trimeric G protein subunits; E, effector. For detail, see text.\n\nnote that inhibition of tyrosine sulfation has been shown to retard the exit of a constitutive secretory protein from the TGN (Friederich et al., 1988) .\n\nSo far, there are no clues as to the identity of the effector system through which activated a subunits exert an inhibitory effect on post-TGN vesicle formation. However, if one extrapolates from recent observations made with intra-Golgi transport vesicles (Serafini et al., 1991) , the effector system may include small ras-like GTP-binding proteins such as ARF. An activated G protein could, for instance, directly or indirectly prevent ARF from recruiting coat proteins to the membrane of a nascent bud, as proposed by Serafini et al. (1991) . An interaction between trimeric G proteins, ARF, and coat proteins is suggested from the observation that addition of \u00df7 subunits inhibits the association of both ARF and \u00df-COP with Golgi membranes (Donaldson et al., 1991b) .\n\nThis leads to the regulation of vesicle formation via the control of coat assembly on the cytoplasmic surface of the forming vesicle. As mentioned before, small GTP-binding proteins have been shown to be part of the nonclathrin coat of intra-Golgi transport vesicles (Serafini et al., 1991) . This may also be true for post-TGN secretory vesicles. Although the nature of the coats of CSVs and ISGs is not precisely known (Tooze, 1991) , the transient presence of these coats implies that their assembly and disassembly before and after scission, respectively, are somehow regulated. Both assembly and disassembly may involve the same small GTP-binding protein that could promote either coating or uncoating, depending on its GTP/GDP-bound state. Free coat subunits of the small GTP-binding protein family may only associate with the membrane when they are in the GTP-bound form. GTP hydrolysis might be linked to a proofreading step related to either coat polymerization or the proper assembly of the various components of the vesicle membrane. Such a \"conditional\" GTP-hydrolysis could, for instance, ensure the production of vesicles that contain all transmembrane and peripheral molecules required to define its intracellular destination.\n\nIf scission, the final step in vesicle formation, is promoted by a motorlike protein of the dynamin family (see Section II,C,2), this step, too, might be a GTP-dependent process. Extrapolating from the apparent lack of scission of endocytotic vesicles in the shibire mutant of Drosophila melanogaster, a similar, though possibly CSV-or ISG-specific motor protein may recognize a completed bud on the TGN and link it to microtubules (Vall\u00e9e and Shpetner, 1990) . Subsequent GTP hydrolysis could then promote movement along these microtubules, and thereby the shearing off of the bud from the donor membrane.\n\nIt is becoming apparent that GTP-binding proteins (heterotrimeric G proteins, small ras-like proteins, and possibly motor proteins) are key components of the regulatory machinery involved in vesicle formation. Future work is needed to characterize these GTP-binding proteins, and a major goal is to identify the various components acting upstream and downstream of them, in particular, the receptor and effector systems."}
