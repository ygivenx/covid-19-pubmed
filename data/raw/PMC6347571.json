{"title": "Insights From Deep Sequencing of the HBV Genome\u2014Unique, Tiny, and Misunderstood", "body": "HBV is the prototype virus of the Hepadnaviridae family\u2014small spherical viruses with icosahedral symmetry that combine a partial double-stranded (ds) DNA genome and virus-encoded RT. Within the Baltimore virus classification system, which classifies viruses based on their genomic composition and replication cycles,29 the Hepadnaviridae are classified as group VII (sometimes referred to as pararetroviruses)\u2014they are the only animal viruses of this group. Until recently, the family was divided into 2 genera: the Orthohepadnavirus species (which infect mammals, including primates and bats) and the Avihepadnavirus species (which infect birds). However, the recent discovery of putative hepadnaviruses that infect fish30 and amphibians31 indicates that the viral family might be larger than initially believed (Figure 1A).32, 33 Based on sequence diversity, HBV is divided into 9 genotypes and 1 putative genotype (Figure 1B). Hepadnaviruses have some of the smallest known viral genomes, ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 kb; the HBV genome is approximately 3.2 kb34 (Figure 1C).\n\nThe circular partially double stranded HBV genome encodes 4 genes\u2014 polymerase (P), surface (S; pre-S1 and pre-S2), precore/core (C) and the X protein, encoded by discrete open reading frames (ORFs; Figure 2A).35, 36, 37, 38 HBV produces 5 viral RNA transcripts of varying lengths, which are translated into 7 distinct proteins (Figure 2A and B).\n\nThis basic genomic organization is common to all hepadnaviruses, although the X gene is absent from most Avihepadnavirus species (with the exception of a vestigial X gene in duck hepadnaviruses).39 The compact nature of hepadnavirus genomes, which have multiple overlapping reading frames, results in approximately two thirds of nucleotides encoding more than 1 functional element.40 This genome structure encompasses virus genes and regulatory regions and restricts redundancy within coding regions (Figure 2A). One specific example is the N-terminal region of the precore protein, which is highly conserved among Orthohepadnavirus species, likely owing to constraints from the overlapping encapsidating signal (epsilon) sequence.41 The negative-sense genomic DNA strand (complementary to the mRNA transcript) is the complete strand\u2014it is held in a circular conformation by an overlap at the 5\u2032 end of the genome (ranging from 50 bp in Avihepadnavirus species to 240 bp in Orthohepadnavirus species).\n\nPartially double stranded relaxed circular (RC-DNA) in HBV virions is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) inside the hepatocyte nucleus by the viral polymerase filling in the partially single-stranded region of the genome (Figure 2B). Biogenesis of cccDNA, including the exact mechanism of DNA repair of the partially single-stranded DNA region of the RC-DNA, is not fully understood. It is likely that cell enzymes such as tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 contribute to cccDNA formation through cleavage of the HBV P from RC-DNA.42, 43 The viral cccDNA is extremely stable and persists in the nucleus as a viral minichromosome44 for the lifespan of the cell, providing the transcriptional template for all RNA species that are translated into viral proteins (Figure 2B).\n\nIn addition to persisting as a minichromosome in the form of cccDNA, hepadnavirus DNA also integrates into the host genome.45 In woodchucks, integration usually occurs within Myc proto-oncogenes, eventually causing HCC in almost all infected animals.45 In humans, HBV integration can occur in different sites within the genome, and the consequences are less clear, although chronic HBV infection is associated with liver cancer.46 After integration of HBV DNA into the host genome, only the S gene typically remains under the control of its native promoter,45 leaving these integrated genomes as a source of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) production.47\n\nDuring infection, infectious viral particles containing HBV genomes are secreted from infected hepatocytes, in addition to smaller subviral particles and long tubular filamentous particles. These particles are empty shells formed from the HBsAg\u2014they lack a capsid and virus genome and are therefore noninfectious.48 The particles typically outnumber infectious virions by as much as 100,000-fold48 and are believed to be involved in immune evasion by binding neutralizing antibodies49 and potentially promoting T-cell anergy.50 Similar particles have been documented in the woodchuck HBV model,51 indicating a common role in Orthohepadnavirus infections.\n\nNine different HBV genotypes (A\u2013I) have been defined by >8% divergence at the nucleotide level; a 10th putative genotype (J) was characterized after isolation from 1 individual.52, 53 The HBV genotypes are further divided into at least 35 subtypes by >4% divergence, with wide variation observed in the numbers of subtypes described per genotype (Table 1).20, 54, 55, 56\n\nThere are substantial differences among genotypes in geographic distribution, transmission mode, and clinical outcomes, including emergence of drug resistance and response to therapy20, 57 (Table 1). However, the data are incomplete\u2014particularly from low- and middle-income countries.6, 58 Furthermore, it is difficult to associate differences in disease progression and outcome with HBV genetic sequences vs population behavior, coinfections, exposures to drugs and hepatotoxins, and human genetic factors.5 Most studies have focused on small numbers of individuals in relatively restricted areas.57 Prospective high-resolution genome-wide association studies of large numbers of patients are required to determine how interactions between human and virus genomes affect outcomes.\n\nSequence data indicate wide variation in the numbers of subtypes within each genotype, ranging from genotype C, with 16 distinct subtypes,52 to genotypes E, G, H, and J, each of which consists of a single subtype (Figure 1B).55, 56 Molecular clock analysis has indicated that genotype C is likely to be the oldest genotype59\u2014the large number of subtypes is in keeping with its protracted endemic association with human populations.60, 61 However, it has been a challenge to study the evolution of HBV, because the lack of temporal structure has confounded molecular clock analyses.62 Genotypes F and H, which have a smaller number of subtypes but are highly divergent from other genotypes, might have higher rates of substitution.63 Genotype F has higher inter-subtype diversity than other genotypes,64 which could be due to the geographic range of the populations it infects\u2014from native Alaskan to Latin American populations.65, 66, 67\n\nGenotypes B and C have been associated with higher rates of vertical transmission than other genotypes.68 Genotypes A1,69 C,68 and F have been associated with earlier progression to HCC (particularly in Alaskan natives).66 Routine genotype analysis of HBV in infected individuals in clinical practice has not been recommended by US, Asia-Pacific, or European clinical guidelines,70, 71, 72 largely because results do not affect treatment decisions. However, more recent European and US guidelines recognize that genotype variations are associated with responses to therapy with pegylated interferon alfa. This treatment is not recommended for patients who are negative for the HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and infected with genotype D or E, and different stopping points are proposed for patients infected with genotypes A\u2013D who have not responded to therapy.15, 71 As new therapies are developed, and genotype and subtype data become more widely available, we will develop a better understanding of the effects of genotype on treatment outcome.\n\nThere are few robust molecular biology and comparative bioinformatic studies of diverse HBV strains; most published sequences are from HBV genotypes B and C, which together account for >60% of published full-length genomes (data downloaded August 2017). Universally accepted reference sequence(s) and numbering of amino acid residues provide an important foundation for unifying research efforts. With this in mind, we used previously published HBV protein alignments73 as a point of reference for pinpointing the sites of immune epitopes within the HBV genome.74\n\nConsistent numbering of the HBV genome is a challenge because of genotype-specific differences in genome length and the circular genome. A unified system would be valuable, similar to that proposed for HCV,75 in which numbering is based on a reference strain, and a consistent approach has been proposed for documentation of insertions and deletions. Conventional HBV numbering, based on molecular cloning of the genome, typically uses X02763 (genotype A) or NC_003977.2 (genotype D) as a reference strain and defines the genome origin at an EcoRI restriction site (GAA/TCC, with nucleotide 1 starting at T), which is embedded within the overlapping P and S genes.76 The presence of this restriction site is hypothetical in many HBV isolates,77 and this numbering convention is not always followed. Sequence data must be examined and realigned to ensure consistent numbering.77\n\nThere are several central databases of HBV sequences, including HBVdb77 and HEPseq (http://www.hepseq.org/Public/Web_Front/main.php), and recent studies have reported reference sequences for subtypes of genotypes A78 and C.79 However, there is no unified set of reference sequences of HBV genotypes and subtypes. This differs from HCV and HIV, for which there are large sequence databases and consistently used reference sequences and supporting resources.80, 81, 82 As the HBV field works progressively toward developing unbiased methods for whole-genome sequencing, the numbers of sequences deposited into such databases is likely to increase considerably. A curated alignment of validated genotype and subtype reference sequences would be a valuable resource for researchers, ensuring that comparative analyses are conducted based on a consistent approach.\n\nInter-genotype HBV recombination has been reported in situations that range from individual case reports to recombinants that have reached fixation and meet the criteria for classification as separate genotypes (genotype I) or subtypes (B2\u2013B4). Breakpoints for the recombinants are not randomly distributed throughout the genotype. Based on the EcoRI numbering convention, breakages tend to occur at sites within nucleotides 1700\u20132000 and 2100\u20132300,83 possibly because of the decreased between-genotype diversity observed in these regions. In addition to the genotype I recombinant, examples include B and C recombinants in parts of mainland East Asia that are now defined as sub-genotypes B2,22,84 B3,85 and B485; C and D recombinants reported from Tibet83 and China84, 86; D and E recombinants reported from different parts of Africa87, 88; A, C, and G recombinants reported in 2 patients in China\u2014although this is based on sequencing only a 1-kb stretch of the genome89; and A and G recombinant sequences identified in a patient with A2 infection90 and in several patients in Canada.91\n\nIntra-genotype HBV recombinants also have been described; genotypes B, C, and E have an increased frequency of intra-genotype recombinant strains compared with other genotypes.64 For genotypes B and C, this likely reflects their long association with humans.59 Well-defined subtype reference strains could be useful to identify recombination events, to explain current distribution and diversity of viral variants, and to predict future evolutionary directions of the epidemic.92\n\nDeep sequencing analyses can increase our understanding of HBV diversity and evolution, control by the immune response, resistance to treatment, and disparities in clinical outcomes. After the success of second-generation short-read sequencing by synthesis approaches (such as the Roche 454 platform [Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel Switzerland] and Illumina [San Diego, CA]), third-generation long-read sequencing technology is advancing (sequencing approaches summarised in a supplementary table on-line at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7106288). Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford Science Park, UK) provides a radically different approach by generating sequence data in real time directly from samples. It produces complete genomic haplotypes, albeit with some constraints because of the high rate of errors in base-calling algorithms.\n\nNGS studies have the potential to increase our understanding of viral diversity. For example, these studies have detected minor variant populations at low levels24, 25 and associated quasispecies diversity with treatment outcome and HBeAg status.27 There are several factors that have hampered our understanding of the nature and effects of intra-host diversity of HBV. Few studies have used whole-genome sequencing analyses, and sequence output can be biased by the need for prior DNA amplification (especially when viral loads are low) and by representation of the RC-DNA reservoir rather than cccDNA sequences. Studies of HCV have found that diversity in different regions of the genome can indicate contrasting biological processes.93, 94\n\nIn regions of the world where HBV is endemic and mixed infections are common, it can be a challenge to differentiate between coinfection and true recombination using current sequencing approaches.92 Several NGS platforms, including Illumina and Roche 454, rely on short reads and amplicon-based approaches, respectively. Therefore, full-genome reconstruction of individual quasispecies can be difficult; inference when multiple genotypes are detected can be unclear.28 The development of new long-read sequencing technologies such as those from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacific Biosciences (Menlo Park, CA) will enable more accurate haplotype reconstruction and increase the specificity with which recombinant strains can be distinguished from mixed infection.95\n\nAlthough some regions of the HBV genome are highly conserved, there are few data on intrapatient diversity. Simultaneous, competing evolutionary pressures can create different subpopulations of HBV within patients (quasispecies) and at the population level. These can produce a more diverse RC-DNA population and a less diverse and stable cccDNA population, with different sequence polymorphisms potentially archived in the cccDNA pool128 (Figure 2Bv).\n\nTo be stably fixed in the virus population, mutant genomes egressed in virions must effectively compete with circulating wild-type viruses to infect hepatocytes and generate cccDNA. This unique population structure maximizes the potential pool of mutants, enabling advantageous virus adaptation within each patient and still eliminating viruses with deleterious mutations. Some less-fit RC-DNA genomes might persist by bypassing egression and being recycled directly back into the nucleus to replenish the viral cccDNA population. However, this model was based on observations from the duck hepadnavirus129 and has not been clearly documented in human HBV infection.130\n\nCertain HBV polymorphisms and deletions have been associated with specific clinical outcomes, such as cirrhosis and HCC. Examples include diversity in the pre-S region, which has been correlated with progression from chronic HBV infection to HCC.131 However, deletions in the pre-S region have been associated with HCC in patients infected with HBV genotypes B and C (in particular, pre-S deletions of nt 2977\u20133013 in HBV genotype C).132, 133 Large deletions that result from splicing of the HBV pre-genomic RNA are associated with advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis134, 135 and HCC.136 Mutations in the basal core promoter (A1762T and G1764A), detected by pyrosequencing, have been associated with increased risk of disease progression to cirrhosis or HCC in some populations137\u2014mostly in patients with HBV genotype B or C infection\u2014independent of viral load.138, 139 Likewise, viral diversity is likely to affect response to treatment, although this relation is not clearly defined. A large study correlated a higher level of virus diversity (particularly in the basal core promoter and precore regions) with a lower probability of HBsAg loss.117 Other studies have associated HBV heterogeneity with positive effects of treatment.140, 141\n\nA wide range of measures can be used to assess the diversity in HBV in infected individuals. Broad estimates of virus diversity have been made using pairwise and entropy-based measures,142 detection of minor variant viral populations with specific polymorphisms (often associated with drug resistance),26, 28, 143 and detection of mixed-genotype or subtype infections.28, 92 It is important to increase our understanding of quasispecies dynamics if we are to better understand how selection and fixation of polymorphisms affect patient outcomes, including virus resistance to drugs and vaccines, the antivirus immune response, and development of chronic liver disease. Diverse virus populations could arise through immune selective pressure; there is a balance between the benefit of immune-escape mutations and the deleterious effects of mutations on HBV fitness or replicative capacity.\n\nA study of mother\u2013child pairs demonstrated a relatively tight bottleneck at transmission, with limited virus diversity in infected children compared with their mothers\u2014suggesting only a proportion of HBV strains in the mother are transferred to the child.119, 144 In mothers with HBV and HIV coinfection, minor HBV variants may be established as the dominant virus in their infants. Mutations in HBsAg were frequently observed in these strains,145 indicating that HIV infection opens the HBV transmission bottleneck. Analyses of intrahepatic quasispecies demonstrated an association between intrahepatic diversity (focused within T-cell epitopes) and off-treatment control, indicating a role for immune-mediated selection pressure in control of viremia.119 Similarly, increased diversity of quasispecies has been associated with effective therapy,141, 146 although this observation has not been consistent.117\n\nFor other blood-borne virus infections, intrapatient virus diversity has been associated with strong suppression by treatment93, 147 or conversely with poor patient outcome.94 However, studies of factors that affect the diversity of HBV are confounded by factors such as genotype and subtype, small heterologous cohorts, variations in sequencing methods, and examination of different areas of the genome. Therefore, it is a challenge to uncover true associations. Studies also are confounded by the geographic distribution of genotypes and the ethnicity of affected individuals.\n\nChronic HBV infection is a fundamental global public health challenge for the 21st century. There is not enough unbiased generation and interpretation of sequence data or attempts to unify such data with relevant resources (such as genome annotation, reference sequences, and robust linked clinical data). The development of unbiased and meta-genomic pipelines, alongside carefully collated host metadata, has begun to affect management of patients with infectious diseases.148, 149, 150 Although deep sequencing approaches have not been robustly applied to HBV, there are several situations in which NGS data could be of substantial value, such as in development of diagnostic tools, selection of treatment, analyses of transmission, and studies of HBV pathogenesis.\n\nIn virus diagnostics, NGS could be used to identify known or novel viruses or to exclude infectious etiology of clinical syndromes.151, 152 Previously unrecognized HBV coinfection was detected using a meta-genomic approach in a cohort of patients with acute liver failure,151 and new splice variants were identified using Pacific Biosciences technology.153 At the same time, NGS might be used to identify existing and new drug-resistant mutations and study their dynamics.117, 154, 155, 156, 157\n\nStrategies are in development to bring genome sequence analysis to the clinical virology laboratory.158 For example, pre-S deletion patterns, combined with quantitative NGS data and machine learning methods, might be used to identify patients at risk for liver disease progression.133, 137 NGS also might be used to characterize the vertical transmission bottleneck and identify and track outbreaks in a range of settings.159, 160, 161\n\nChallenges remain in the widespread application of NGS platforms, including the need to deplete host reads, which could require enrichment and amplification steps (particularly in detecting viruses at low copy numbers). Systems and reagents are expensive, and interpretation of NGS data requires considerable bioinformatic support and adaptation for different genomic configurations. For HBV, this means refining methods for a circular and partial dsDNA genome. However, the development of portable, real-time, third-generation sequencing platforms, such as the Nanopore MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies),158 have made the prospect of deep sequencing as a point of care test increasingly feasible. Relatively short and simple sample preparation protocols, minimal setup requirements (a laptop computer), and low costs relative to convention benchtop sequencers make the technology particularly appealing for resource-limited settings. Although the error rate of Nanopore has been too high for robust application to studies of pathogen diversity, rapid improvements are being made to laboratory and bioinformatic protocols.162\n\nSubstantial gaps remain in our understanding of the relationship between HBV genome structure, replication cycle, diversity, transmission, and clinical outcomes. Recent sequencing advances offer an enormous opportunity to generate datasets that can help to address some of these questions. The generation of standardized reference genomes of all HBV genotypes and subtypes to enable robust and consistent collation and analysis is required to develop insights into current and future epidemiology, to inform better clinical assessment and prognostication, to improve deployment of current antiviral drugs and vaccines, and to drive discovery of new therapeutic agents."}
