{"title": "Viral Specificity in Cell Culture", "body": "BMS-790052 was tested in triple drug combination experiments with IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin (standard of care), as summarized in Table S4 . Additive effects were observed at all effective doses using the triple combination. \n\nThe effects of BMS-790052 in combination with the HCV NS3 inhibitor (2R,6S,13aS,14aR,16aS,Z)-6-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-14a-(cyclopropylsulfonylcarbamoyl)-5, 16-dioxo-1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13a,14,14a,15,16,16a-hexadecahydrocyclopropa[e] pyrrolo[1,2a] [1, 4] diazacyclopentadecin-2-yl 4-fluoroisoindoline-2-carboxylate 25 are summarized in Table S5 . The EC 50 for BMS-790052 is higher in these experiments since these combinations were performed in the genotype 1a replicon cells. The results of two experiments indicate mixed additivity/synergy. \n\n2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropoxy-N-methyl-6-(methylsulfonamido)benzofuran-3-carboxamide, an allosteric NS5B inhibitor targeting a palm site II on the NS5B polymerase 26 , was tested in combination with BMS-790052. The overall results of all three experiments indicate mixed additivity/synergy (Table S6) . \n\nBMS-790052 was also tested in combination with 4-amino-1-((2R,3R,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methyltetrahydro-2-furanyl)-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (NM-107), a NS5B nucleoside analog 27 . In three experiments, synergy/additivity was observed at all three ratios and effective levels ( Table S7 ). The results of all three experiments indicate mixed synergy/additivity. These results demonstrate that combination treatment of replicon cells with BMS-790052 and IFN-\u03b1 +/-ribavirin, or inhibitors targeting the HCV NS3 protease or NS5B polymerase, yield additive to synergistic antiviral effects. Importantly, neither antagonism of antiviral activity, nor enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed with any of these combinations. The ability to use BMS-790052 in combination therapy can provide major advantages over single drug therapy for the treatment of HCV. \n\nThe HCV genome displays very restricted tissue and host tropism. To date, efficient replication of genotype 1a and 1b replicons with cell culture adaptive mutations is mainly observed in the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7. To ensure that the inhibition of HCV replication by NS5A\n\ninhibitors is not an artifact of the Huh-7 cell line, the potency of BMS-790052 was evaluated in transient replicon assays using a genotype 2a (JFH-1) replicon, whose replication does not require adaptive mutations, in Huh-7, HeLa and HEK 293T cells. An HCV NS3 protease inhibitor was used as a positive control. As shown in Table S8 , the potency of BMS-790052 is similar in all 3 cell types with EC 50 values ranging from 3.5 to 20 pM, suggesting that the function(s) of NS5A inhibited by BMS-790052 are highly conserved in different cell environments. \n\nSubjects selected for this study included men and women, aged 18 to 49 years, inclusive, who were chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 and were:\n\n\u2022 treatment naive subjects; or\n\n\u2022 treatment non-responders, defined as subjects who received the current standard of care (interferon and/or ribavirin) and continued to have a detectable HCV RNA level (including relapsers) or subjects who did not attain a 2 log 10 decline in HCV RNA levels at 12 weeks and stopped treatment; or\n\n\u2022 treatment-intolerant subjects, defined as subjects who were unable to tolerate the toxicities associated with interferon and/or ribavirin; and\n\n\u2022 had not received another NS5A replication co-factor inhibitor; and\n\n\u2022 not co-infected with HIV, HBV, or HCV other than genotype 1.\n\nEligible subjects also had a HCV RNA viral load of \u226510 5 IU/mL, a documented FibroSure\u2122 score of \u2264 0.59 and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) \u2264 2, and a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kg/m 2 , inclusive. All subjects signed the informed consent form, and were screened and determined to be eligible based on medical history, physical examination and measurements, vital signs, a 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory measurements including serology. The NS5A coding region was amplified with genotype specific primers selected from those listed in Table S11 .

Total RNA was isolated and viral sequences amplified from serum samples collected from HCV-infected subjects in the three cohorts (1, 10 and 100 mg of BMS-790052).\n\nPopulation sequencing results from samples derived at baseline (T0), 24 (T24) and 144 (T144) hours post-dose are summarized in Tables S12-S14.

Starting materials were either purchased from commercial sources or prepared according to the noted literature protocols. 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker 300, 400 or 500 MHz instruments and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 125\n\nMHz instrument. Chemical shifts were assigned in ppm relative to respective solvent signals (e.g., signal of residual CHCl 3 present in CDCl 3 for 1 H-NMR). The following abbreviations are used to describe signal splitting patterns: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), and broad (br). Med. Chem, 39, 3435-3450 (1996) ) (800 mg, 2.83 mmol) and thiourea 3 (706 mg, 2.83 mmol) were dissolved in absolute EtOH (70 mL), NaOAc (3.0 g, 36.6 mmol) was added, and the mixture heated at 70\u00b0C for 4.5 hr. After being cooled, the solvent was partially removed by rotary evaporation (1/3 volume) before being diluted with EtOAc (2 vol). After washing with H 2 O, the aqueous layer was extracted with Et 2 O, the combined organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated. The crude product was subjected to chromatography on silica gel, eluting with 10% EtOAc/hexanes, to afford azide 4 as a yellow oil (700 mg, 64%). 1, 171.9, 163.6 (J CF = 244.9 Hz), 156.5, 154.5, 150.4 (J CF = 9.4 Hz), 149.8, 142.9, 139.4, 137.5, 131.6, 131.4, 131.3, 129.4, 128.9, 128 [M+H] + calcd for C 7 H 14 NO 4 , 176.0923; found, 176.0922. \n\nA mixture of ketoamide 7 (12.8 g, 31.12 mmol) and NH 4 OAc (12.0 g, 155.7 mmol) in xylenes (155 mL) was heated in a sealed tube at 140 \u00b0C for 2 hr. The volatile component was removed in vacuo, the residue partitioned carefully between EtOAc and H 2 O, and saturated NaHCO 3 solution added carefully with stirring until the pH of the aqueous phase was slightly basic. The layers were separated, the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc and the combined organic phase washed with brine, dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo.\n\nThe resulting material was recrystallized from EtOAc/hexanes to provide two crops of imidazole 8 as a dense light yellow solid (5.85 g). The mother liquor was concentrated in vacuo and subjected to a flash chromatography (silica gel; 30% EtOAc/hexanes as eluant) to provide an additional 2.23 g of imidazole 8 (66% combined yield 26.21 mmol) and 1,4-dioxane (80 mL). The reaction flask was purged with N 2 , capped and heated in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C for 16.5 hr. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was partitioned carefully between CH 2 Cl 2 (150 mL) and an aqueous medium comprising 50 mL H 2 O and 10 mL saturated NaHCO 3 solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 , the combined organic phase dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting material was purified using flash chromatography (the sample was loaded with the eluting solvent: 20-35% EtOAc/CH 2 Cl 2 ) to provide boronate 9, contaminated with pinacol, as a dense, off-white solid (3.93 g); the relative mole ratio of boronate 9 to pinacol was ~10:1 according to 1 H-NMR analysis and the sample was submitted to the next phase extracted with 20% MeOH/CHCl 3 (30 mL). The combined organic phase was washed with brine, dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. A silica gel mesh was prepared from the resulting crude material and submitted to flash chromatography using EtOAc as eluant to afford biphenyl 10, contaminated with a small amount of Ph 3 PO, as an off-white solid (563 mg, ~61% yield). 1 H-NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d 6 , \u03b4 = 2.5 ppm): \u03b4 12. 21-12-16/11.95-11.78 (m, 2H), 7.85-7.48/ 7.32-7.25 (m, 10H) "}
