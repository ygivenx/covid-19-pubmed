{"title": "The development and application of Laboratory Animal Science in China", "body": "The 14th Scientific Congress of the Chinese Association for Laboratory Animal Science was held on October [11] [12] 2018 The main points that were discussed are as follows.\n\nAfter nearly a century of development, there are more than 200 species of experimental animals, and more than 20 000 inbred lines, outbred lines, genetic engineered animals, animal models of diseases, and other resources all over the world, which provide abundant experimental animal resources for scientific research. These resources are widely used in life science research.\n\nMany important scientific achievements have been obtained by using laboratory animals, as recognized by 18 Nobel Prizes that were awarded for breakthroughs made possible by this work. According to statistics, in the field of life science, animal experiments account for 60% and therefore make a significant contribution to research in the field. Animal experiments have proved that many infectious human diseases are caused by various microorganisms, such as plague, brucellosis, diphtheria, tetanus, smallpox, and so on. These scientific achievements have determined the relationship between various pathogenic microorganisms and human diseases, making it possible to prevent diseases, build immunologic defenses, and to treat various infectious diseases. Antibiotics, drugs, and biological products discov- 4 In 2013, ferret, mice, and pig models for H7N9 were developed to study the virus infection and transmission. 5, 6 Meanwhile, the nonhuman primate models for MERS infection were, respectively, developed on marmosets and rhesus macaques. 7, 8 They also established the nonhuman primate model for HIV study in China used since the 1980s, and the drug resistance and latent infection model for tuberculosis, These models have resolved the bottleneck in the study of infectious diseases study and drug development in China and other countries. [9] [10] [11] [12] In order to improve the reliability and repeatability of animal experimental results, the standardization of animal model development and evaluation technology in infectious diseases has been performed, which has solved the problem of poor reproducibility of animal experiment results. 13, 14 Based on the animal model system for the whole process of Finally, the development of the Gene Mine offers the potential for many new animal models of disease to be developed. Harnessing the genetic repertoire of the mouse species, the Gene Mine consists of dozens of recombinant inbred strains, resembling a large pedigree of dozens of \"cousins\" descended from eight \"great-grandparents\". [15] [16] [17] Already, the Gene Mine has generated several unique models, including for diabetic retinopathy, 18 ulcerative colitis, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, achalasia, prostate hyperplasia, etc. The Gene\n\nMine is now based in ILAS, Beijing, where its phenotyping, genotyping and evaluation for diseases is ongoing.\n\nNone.\n\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-8562-7325"}
