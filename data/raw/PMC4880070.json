{"title": "Infection, Replication, and Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Alpacas", "body": "Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Colorado State University. Every effort was made to minimize stress and pain of the animals.\n\nAnimals were infected with a low-passage human isolate of MERS-CoV (strain HCoV-EMC/2012). This strain was propagated in Vero E6 cells cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium as described (21).\n\nNine locally bred alpacas were obtained by private sale for use in this study. Animals were allowed to acclimate to the facility for 1 week before infection and were fed hay ad libitum. One day before infection, animals were subcutaneously injected with an identification and temperature-sensing transponder (Lifechip; Destron Fearing, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, TX, USA), and their body temperatures were monitored throughout the study. Alpacas A1\u2013A3 were housed together and experimentally infected by intranasal instillation of 107 PFU of MERS-CoV diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (3 mL/nare). Two days later, alpacas A4\u2013A6 were introduced into the same room as alpacas A1\u2013A3 and housed together for the duration of the study.\n\nNasal swab specimens were collected by inserting and rotating sterile swabs into both nares, immediately placed in virus transport medium, and frozen until assay. Blood was collected weekly into serum-separating tubes for detection of neutralizing antibodies. Animals A1\u2013A6 were held in the facility for 70 days postinfection, and all 6 animals were then reinfected intranasally with 107 PFU of MERS-CoV. Three additional alpacas (A7\u2013A9) were also infected to serve as infection controls and evaluate tissue distribution of virus replication.\n\nNasal swab specimens were collected daily from all animals for 5 days, at which time animals A7\u2013A9 were humanely euthanized. Tissues collected at necropsy for detection of infectious virus from these 3 animals included nasal turbinates, trachea, larynx, and all 4 lung lobes. These samples plus additional samples, including brain, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, heart, spleen, bladder, mesenteric lymph node, submandibular lymph node, and mediastinal lymph node, were fixed in formalin for histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis. Nasal swab specimens and serum samples collected from alpacas A1\u2013A6 were sampled for 2 weeks after the second infection, and then these animals were then humanely euthanized.\n\nTissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for >7 days and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated by a veterinary pathologist (H.B.-O.). Immunohistochemical analysis was preformed to detect MERS-CoV antigen by using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 antigen (diluted 1:1,000) as a primary antibody as described (22).\n\nMERS-CoV was titrated from nasal swab specimens in virus transport medium and homogenized tissue by plaque assay as described for camels (21). A 1-mL volume of virus transport medium was considered a 10\u22121 dilution, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared in BA1 medium. Neutralizing antibodies were detected by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as described, and seropositive animals were identified by using a 90% neutralization cutoff (23).\n\nField studies and experimental infections suggest that mild respiratory disease associated with nasal discharge develops in MERS-CoV\u2013infected camels (21,24,25). Similar to dromedaries, none of the alpacas had any appreciable increase in body temperature during challenge or rechallenge (Figure 1). Unlike dromedary camels, none of the alpacas had any observable nasal discharge over the course of infection. All alpacas maintained consistent activity level, temperament, and food intake throughout the study.\n\nNasal swab specimens were collected from infected animals immediately before challenge, on days 1\u20135 postinfection, and on day 10 postinfection. All 3 experimentally infected animals (A1\u2013A3) had detectable infectious virus on day 1\u00ad5 postinfection but had stopped shedding virus by day 10 postinfection (Figure 2, panels A, B). The 3 co-housed animals (A4\u2013A6) were placed in the room with the infected animals 2 days after initial virus infection. Nasal swab specimens were collected from co-housed animals on days 3\u201310 after infection of animals A1\u2013A3, and then 3 times/week through day 19.\n\nInfectious virus was detected from animal A6 during days 7\u201314 and from animal A4 only on day 14. We did not isolate infectious virus from animal A5 (Figure 2, panel A). Although infectious virus was detected in animal A6 on day 7, infectious virus was not detected in animal A4 until day 14 (Figure 2, panel A). We speculate that animal A4 became infected by contact with animal A6 after animals A1\u2013A3 had cleared their infections, which suggested that transmission is linked to intimate animal contact, rather than to aerosol transmission.\n\nTo test whether previous infection was protective against subsequent virus challenge, all 6 original study animals (A1\u2013A6) were allowed to clear their infections and rechallenged by intranasal infection on day 70 postinfection. Challenge was also performed with 3 immunologically na\u00efve alpacas (A7\u2013A9) (infection controls). The 3 immunologically naive animals became infected and shed virus during days 1\u20135 postinfection, at which time they were euthanized. The 3 animals that became infected through contact (A4\u2013A6) shed minimal virus between days 1\u20132 after rechallenge, but not on days 3\u20135. In contrast, animals that had been experimentally infected were completely protected against rechallenge and did not shed detectable quantities of virus (Figure 2, panels C, D).\n\nSerum was collected weekly and tested for neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. All 3 experimentally infected animals (A1\u2013A3) had detectable levels of antibodies beginning on day 14 (Table). Although infectious virus was isolated only from 2 of the 3 co-housed animals, these 3 animals had neutralizing antibodies detected first on day 21 (animals A5 and A6) or day 28 (animal A4) (Table).\n\nNasal turbinate, upper trachea, lower trachea, larynx, and all 4 lung lobes were sampled at necropsy from alpacas A7, A8, and A9 and tested for infectious virus by using a plaque assay. Virus was detected in the nasal turbinates, larynx, and trachea of the 3 alpacas but not in any of the lung lobes tested (Figure 3).\n\nGross lesions were not observed at necropsy in any of the alpacas. However, microscopic analysis of formaldehyde-fixed tissue sections from animals A7\u2013A9 showed mild squamous metaplasia of the epithelium of the turbinates in animal A8 (Figure 4, panel A) and rare foci of mucosal erosion accompanied by minimal-to-mild subepithelial infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages and fewer lymphocytes (Figure 4, panel C). All 3 animals also had follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes, which suggested immune activation.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis detected rare, scattered, virus antigen\u2013positive cells in respiratory epithelium of turbinates (Figure 4, panel B) and in rare cells interpreted to be intraepithelial leukocytes. Virus antigen was not detected in any of the other tissues examined. Animals A7 and A9 had histopathologic evidence of mild encephalitis with perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and monocytes and mild gliosis (Figure 4, panel D). We did not assay brain tissue for virus, either by isolation or PCR, because of the high potential of contamination from the nasal cavity during extraction. Brain tissue was negative for virus by immunohistochemical analysis, but the etiology of the encephalitis observed remains unknown and might have been unrelated to MERS-CoV infection.\n\nMany difficulties are associated with high containment experiments involving dromedary camels. Thus, additional animal models are necessary for MERS-CoV research. Because of their greater availability in the United States and smaller size, we tested an alpaca model.\n\nWe report an alpaca model of MERS-CoV infection in camelids and analysis of animal-to-animal transmission and reinfection dynamics. Infected alpacas shed considerable quantities of infectious virus nasally, although at lower concentrations than those reported for dromedary camels (21,24). In addition, none of the infected alpacas had a noticeable nasal discharge, which is distinctly different from what has been observed in camels and might explain the relatively low efficiency of contact transmission we observed with alpacas.\n\nInfectious virus was detected in nasal swab specimens from 2 of 3 alpacas co-housed with experimentally infected animals, and each of the 3 co-housed animals had neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV, which indicated virus transmission. The antibody titers observed approximate those seen for infected dromedaries with the exception of A4, whose antibodies titers remained low until after rechallenge (21). Finally, experimentally infected alpacas were completely protected against subsequent virus rechallenge, and contact-infected alpaca were only partially protected.\n\nThese results suggest that infection can easily spread among closely grouped camelids infected with MERS-CoV. Camels are frequently moved within the Middle East for grazing, camel shows, and races. Such movement enables mixing and close mingling of animals and could play a major role in MERS-CoV transmission among animals and to handlers. Khalafalla et al. reported that animals bound for slaughter were held in a livestock market for several days, transferred to an abattoir, and kept for up to 24 hours before slaughter (25). Our data suggest that these handling practices could promote animal-to-animal virus transmission and that at the time of slaughter virus could potentially be transmitted to slaughterhouse workers.\n\nA major question related to the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection in camels, and of great relevance to vaccination strategies, is whether animals that have been infected are resistant to reinfection and virus shedding and, if so, for how long. Our experimentally infected animals were completely protected against rechallenge 70 days later, which suggests that sterilizing immunity can be achieved. However, the animals that were infected through contact (animals A4\u2013A6) shed infectious virus after reinfection, albeit at much lower levels than infected control animals (animals A7\u2013A9).\n\nAlthough not tested in the present study, it might be surmised that the 3 in-contact animals would have acquired sterilizing immunity from the second (booster) infection. These results support field data that suggest that young animals become infected and probably receive booster infections; most older animals have acquired immunity and are not susceptible to infection and virus shedding (26). This finding also highlights the possibility that widespread vaccination of dromedary camels could result in a major decrease in virus transmission to humans.\n\nTo date, neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV have not been detected in camelids outside Africa or the Middle East. However, if virus were to be introduced into immunologically naive camelid populations, it probably would be readily transmitted among animals. Many New World camelids are valued for their fiber, and such transmission might devastate fiber-related industries (27). Thus, as travel-associated cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to be documented, human-to-human virus transmission and possible human-to-animal virus transmission should be monitored.\n\nThis study had several limitations. Each of the 3 experimental groups had only 3 animals, which limited our ability to perform statistical analyses. In addition, we evaluated protective immunity 10 weeks after the original infection, which is a relatively short period and does not fully recapitulate seasonal exposures. Thus, further studies are necessary to better understand duration of immunity in camels and alpacas.\n\nNote Added in Proof: Crameri et al. also report experimental infection and response to rechallenge of alpacas with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in this issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (28)."}
