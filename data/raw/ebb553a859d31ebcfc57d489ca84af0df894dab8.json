{"title": "Title 1 Choanoflagellate transfection illuminates their cell biology and the ancestry of animal septins 2 3 Short Title 4 Robust transfection in choanoflagellates 5 6 Authors 7", "body": "First described in the mid-19 th century, choanoflagellates inspired great debate regarding 39 animal taxonomy (James-Clark, 1868; Kent, 1871; Leadbeater, 2015) . The most diagnostic 40 morphological feature of choanoflagellates, a \"collar complex\" composed of a single apical 41 flagellum surrounded by a collar of actin-filled microvilli (Fig. 1) , was interpreted as evidence of 42 a special relationship between choanoflagellates and sponges, whose choanocytes (or \"collar 43 cells\") each bear a collar complex. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of cells 44 with a collar complex in nearly all animal phyla have revealed that sponges and all other 45 animals are monophyletic, with choanoflagellates as their closest living relatives ( Fig. 1) (Lang 46 et al., 2002; King et al., 2008; Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2008; Burger et al., 2003; Fairclough et al., 2013; 47 We observed that transfected cells resembled untransfected cells in their shape, motility, 133 and ability to propagate, indicating that transfection did not irreparably harm S. rosetta. 134\n\nFluorescence persisted through multiple cell divisions, yet the diminishing signal in daughter 135 cells indicated that transfection was transient (Fig. S6A) . Importantly, using flow cytometry one 136 to two days after transfection, we found that ~1% of the population was reproducibly 137 transfected, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting enriched this transfected cell population 138 (Fig. S6B ). This transfection frequency is comparable to high frequency episomal transformation 139 of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that ranges from 1 -10% (Schiestl and Electron micrographs have revealed two distinct regions in the nucleus: the darkly-stained 154 nucleolus positioned in the center and the surrounding, more lightly-stained nucleoplasm 155 (Leadbeater, 2015; Burkhardt et al., 2014) . As predicted, mCherry fused to either the carboxy 156 terminus of H3 or the amino terminus of the simian virus 40 nuclear localization signal localized 157 primarily to the S. rosetta nucleoplasm and was excluded from the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B , C) 158 (Kanda et al., 1998; Kalderon et al., 1984) . In contrast, the cytoplasmic marker EFL-mCherry 159 (Huh et al., 2003) localized to the cytosol and was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 3D) . 160\n\nTwo of the most diagnostic features of the choanoflagellate cell are the actin-filled collar 161 and the flagellum, which is comprised of microtubules (Karpov and Leadbeater, 1998) . A fusion 162 of mCherry to the filamentous actin-binding peptide Lifeact (Riedl et al., 2008) Subunit IV revealed a network of mitochondria (Nunnari et al., 1997) that is enriched around the 186 nucleus and extends throughout the cell (Fig. 3G ). Taken together, these fluorescent markers 187 demonstrate new experimental capabilities to rapidly tag proteins and to monitor their 188 localization in distinct cellular compartments and locales. 189 190\n\nA major motivation for establishing transgenics in S. rosetta was to rapidly characterize 192 candidate genes for multicellularity. Therefore, we investigated the localization of septins, a 193 family of paralogous genes hypothesized to contribute to multicellular development in S. rosetta 194 (Fairclough et al., 2013) . The assembly of septin monomers into higher order structures is 195 important for septin localization and for the conserved roles of septins in 196 regulating cytokinesis and cell polarity in fungi and animals. In animals, septins also function in 197 phagocytosis (Huang et al., 2008) , ciliogenesis (Hu et al., 2010) , and planar cell polarity (Kim et 198 paralogs interact directly through their G-domains to form heteromeric filaments, and these 202 heteromeric filaments interact with each other through the septin coiled-coil domains to form 203 higher order assemblies (Bertin et al., 2008; Garcia et al., 2011; Sirajuddin et al., 2007) . 204 S. rosetta expresses four septin paralogs, three of which have well-annotated genome 205 models in the current draft genome (Fairclough et al., 2013) . We started by examining the 206 localization of the S. rosetta septin protein SrSeptin2 (PTSG_07215), a septin with domains 207 conserved in human and fungal septins (Fairclough et al., 2013) that are necessary for septin 208 filament formation (Sirajuddin et al., 2007; Bertin et al., 2008) . Strikingly, mTFP1-SrSeptin2 was 209 enriched at the basal poles of single and rosettes cells ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/343111 doi: bioRxiv preprint opposed to the concave membrane at the basal end of S. rosetta where wild-type SrSeptin2 231 localized. 232\n\nThe basal and lateral localization of SrSeptin2 and SrSeptin6 in rosettes is reminiscent of 233 septin localization in polarized epithelial cells (Fares et al., 1995; Spiliotis et al., 2008) , in which 234 septins interact with the positive ends of microtubules that are growing toward the basal pole 235 (Bowen et al., 2011) . In choanoflagellates, microtubules radiate down from the apical 236 microtubule organizing centers (Karpov and Leadbeater, 1998) , with the plus ends meeting at 237 the basal pole of each cell, similar to the orientation of microtubule plus ends toward the basal 238 pole in animal epithelia (Meads and Schroer, 1995) . To examine if septins also interact with the 239 plus ends of microtubules in S. rosetta, we co-transfected cells with mTFP1-SrSeptin2 and the 240 tubulin marker \u03b1-tubulin-mCherry (Fig. 4G ). Fluorescence microscopy showed that septin 241 filaments intercalate between cortical microtubules at the basal pole of the cell ( laboratories. This method overcomes numerous barriers that prevented efficient DNA delivery in 252 our prior attempts using diverse methods, including standard electroporation, lipofection, 253 bombardment, and cell-penetrating peptides. A key breakthrough for this study was the 254 discovery that the extracellular coat surrounding S. rosetta might present a barrier for 255 transfection, which motivated the development of a method to gently remove the extracellular 256 material surrounding S. rosetta, thereby sensitizing cells for transfection. Additional 257 improvements to the transfection procedure, such as a step for promoting the closure of the 258 plasma membrane after electrical pulsation, were designed to address the unique challenges 259 that arise from culturing S. rosetta in sea water. Just as our method was informed by 260 approaches developed in model microeukaryotes (Chlamydomonas and yeast), the methods we 261 have established in S. rosetta will likely extend to aid gene delivery in diverse non-model marine 262\n\n.

Overall, the gestalt of continually improving choanoflagellate husbandry (Levin 263 and King, 2013) , developing protocols for priming and recovering cells during nucleofection, and 264 extensively optimizing transfection based on a quantitative assay produced a robust method for 265 gene delivery in S. rosetta. 266\n\nThis work also provides a foundational set of vectors for expressing transgenes in S. 267 rosetta (Dataset S1). In these vectors, the expression of luciferase or fluorescent proteins was (Hartwell, 1971 ). In addition to their conserved roles in cell division (Neufeld and Rubin, 1994) , The ability to express transgenes in S. rosetta described here will accelerate studies of the 308 ancestral functions of animal genes that are conserved in choanoflagellates. We anticipate that 309 future work will build on this approach, eventually leading to the development of methods for The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Media recipes are provided in Table S1 . Cultures were 321 established from frozen aliquots by adding 1 ml of thawed cells to 10 ml of 0.2x High Nutrient 322\n\nMedia (Table S1 ). After the cells reached a density of 10 4 cells/ml, the culture was split 1:2 into 323 1x High Nutrient Media with a constant volume of 0.24 ml/cm 2 . After this initial split (denoted as 324 day 0), cells were passaged in 1x High Nutrient Media according to the following schedule: 1:4 325 dilution on day 1, 1:8 dilution on day 2, 1:16 on day 3. Subsequently cells were passaged every 326 day at a 1:24 dilution or every other day as a 1:48 dilution of cells. 327\n\nBased on the recommendation from Lonza to use a medium with a low calcium 328 concentration for transfecting mammalian cells, we searched for a seawater recipe with a lower 329 concentration of calcium than the routinely-used artificial seawater made from Tropic of Marin 330\n\nSalts (Levin and King, 2013) , which has a calcium concentration of 9.1 mM at a salinity of 35 331 g/kg (Atkinson and Bingman, 1998) . The AK seawater formulation (Table S1) that has been 332 used to culture marine algae (Hallegraeff et al., 2004) and dinoflagellates (Skelton et al., 2009 ) 333 and has a calcium concentration of 2.7 mM. We found that S. rosetta grows more rapidly in 1x 334\n\nHigh Nutrient Media prepared in AK seawater rather than seawater prepared with Tropic of 335\n\nMarin Salts (Fig. S2A) . Therefore, we switched to a growth medium based on AK seawater for 336 routine culturing. After optimizing the nucleofection protocol, we demonstrated that growing S. 337 rosetta in AK seawater also resulted in higher transfection efficiencies ( Optimized transfection protocol 377\n\nThe protocol is summarized in Fig. 2 was set to three standard deviations above the background signal such that any signal above 446 the detection limit has less than a 1% chance of arising from random error. The limit of detection 447 was calculated in two different ways. First, the y-axis intercept and standard deviation were 448 .

Subsequently, the coverslip was washed once with 4% 551 formaldehyde diluted in cytoskeleton buffer and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature 552 after a second application of the formaldehyde solution.
