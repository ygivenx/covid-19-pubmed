{"title": "Regulation of ROS in transmissible gastroenteritis virus-activated apoptotic signaling", "body": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the family coronaviridae in the genus alphacoronavirus [1, 2] , could cause severe lethal watery diarrhea and dehydration in piglets and lead to serious economic loss for the pork industry. Previous studies indicated that TGEV infection could activate proapoptotic signaling to trigger cell apoptosis, and further result in CPE and cell death in permissive cells [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, the upstream apoptotic signaling activated by TGEV infection is still not completely elucidated.\n\nOxidative stress imposed either directly by the virus or by the host-immune response, is a potentially important pathogenic mechanism in many virus infectious diseases [8] [9] [10] [11] . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation [12] . The generation of ROS can be induced under various conditions of stress, including ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs and viral infections [13] . ROS not only kill target cells but may also overwhelm cellular antioxidant defenses of neighboring cells, leading to damage of DNA [12] . Meanwhile, ROS have also been implicated in some important signaling pathways, such as MAPK and p53 pathways [14] . In our previous works we have demonstrated that TGEV activates p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways, causes transcriptional induction of Bax and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol upon TGEV infection [6, 7] . The study presented here demonstrated that TGEV infection could induce ROS accumulation to regulate the apoptotic signalings, which might play primary role in the pathogenesis of TGEV.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies against cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-2, b-actin, Cox4, p53, p38, p-p38 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Inc., CA, US). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Pierce (Pierce, Rockford, IL, US). PK-15 cells (ATCC, CCL-33) were grown in Dulbecco Minimal Essential Medium (D-MEM) (Gibco BRL, MD, US) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated new born bovine serum (Gibco BRL, MD, US), 100 IU of penicillin and 100 lg of streptomycin per ml, at 37\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO 2 . The TGEV Shaanxi strain was used as previously described [6, 7] .\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using the cell-permeable fluorescent-probe 2 0 -7 0 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Sigma-Aldrich, US). Briefly, cells were grown in 24-well tissue culture plates, and the cells were incubated with 10 lM DCFH-DA at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the dark, and then infected with TGEV at 10 MOI for different time. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (AMG EVOS Inc., Israel).\n\nMock-infected and TGEV-infected cells were harvested at indicated times. After washed twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with 10 lM DCFH-DA at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the dark for final analysis by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter EPICS ALTRA, Orlando, US).\n\nThe Dwm was analyzed using a JC-1 Mitochondrial Potential Detection Kit (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA, US). Briefly, cells were harvested at indicated times and stained by JC-1 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by flow cytometric analysis.\n\nCell extracts were prepared as described previously (Ding et al., 2012) . Protein concentrations were measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, US). Equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded and electrophoresed on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Subsequently, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp, Atlanta, GA, US). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with indicated primary antibodies over night at 4\u00b0C, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The signal was detected using ECL reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, US).\n\nCaspase-3 activity was measured by colorimetric assay kit (Bio-Vision, Inc., CA, US) following the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared and protein concentrations were measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, \n\nAnnexin V-FITC Apoptosis Kit (BioVision, Inc., CA, US) was used for apoptosis detection according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 500 ll binding buffer, followed by adding 5 ll of Annexin V-FITC and 5 ll of PI. After incubation in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, a total of 10 000 cells were acquired and percentage of positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Fullerton, CA. US).\n\nTo explore the upstream mechanism of TGEV-induced cell damage, we measured ROS levels in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells using DCFH-DA, a non-fluorescent compound, which is converted into highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by cellular peroxides [15] . Results showed that the fluorescence in PK-15 cells was observed at 3 h post infection (p.i.), and the fluorescence intensity enhanced with infectious time increase (Fig. 1A) . To further confirm the ROS production, intracellular ROS production was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B , consistent with the observation under fluorescence microscopy, TGEV infection induced an increase in DCF fluorescence (Fig. 1B, upper panel) . At 3, 6 and 12 h post-infection, ROS production in TGEV-infected cells increased markedly compared with that of mock-infected cells, and maintained a higher level in next infectious time (Fig. 1B , lower panal). However, UV-inactivated TGEV lost their ability to increase ROS production (Fig. 1B) . These results suggest that TGEV induce ROS accumulation in PK-15 cells.\n\nSince ROS could stimulate the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial DNA damage to promote outer membrane permeabilization [12] , we used JC-1 as fluorescence probe to evaluate changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) by flow cytometry. JC-1 forms monomers and emits green fluorescence at low Dwm, while it forms aggregates and emits red fluorescence at high Dwm. Fig. 2A showed that the Dwm-depolarized cells increased about 26.2% and 61.3% at 12 and 24 h in TGEV infected PK-15 cells, respectively, compared with mock infection. Two different antioxidants of ROS, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC) (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (Sigma-Aldrich, US), which did not show cytotoxicity at concentrations used (data not shown), significantly prevented the production of ROS and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential in TGEV-infected cells ( Fig. 2B and C) . These results indicated that TGEV infection might reduce mitochondrial membrane potential through the production of ROS.\n\nMitochondria are crucial to regulate apoptosis upon virus infection. To further explore the roles of ROS accumulation in TGEV-induced apoptosis, we investigated the effects of PDTC and NAC, on the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and cytochrome c redistribution, caspase-3 activity and apoptosis induction. As predicted, the expression of Bcl-2 increased (Fig. 3A) , Bax and cytochrome c (Cyt c) redistribution was attenuated evidently in mitochondria and cytosol respectively in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells with PDTCand NAC treatment (Fig. 3B ). In addition, caspase-3 activity was remarkably decreased in the TGEV-infected cells with PDTC and NAC compared to that without the two inhibitors (Fig. 3C) . Consequently, PDTC and NAC treatment significantly suppressed TGEVinduced apoptosis in PK-15 cells (Fig. 3D) . These results suggest that ROS play a pivotal role in the process of apoptosis induced by TGEV.\n\nIn our previous study, we found that TGEV could regulate apoptosis by inducing p38 MAPK and p53 pathways [7] . ROS may play an important role in the activation of these signaling pathways, thus we detected whether ROS were involved in TGEV-induced p38 MAPK and p53 activation. PK-15 cells were pre-treated with the scavenger NAC and PDTC for 1 h, and then co-treated with TGEV, the levels of p38 MAPK and p53 were evaluated by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4A , two ROS scavengers treatment significantly reduced p53 protein levels and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK when TGEV infected PK-15 cells for 24 h, suggesting that ROS might be involved in p38 MAPK and p53 activation upon TGEV infection.\n\nIn order to investigate whether the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 pathways promote ROS production, we tested ROS levels in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells with specific p53 inhibitor pifithrin-a (PFT-a) (Sigma-Aldrich, US) or p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Fig. 4B showed that the presence of PFT-a and SB203580 resulted in decrease of ROS production in a certain extent, especially PFT-a had more significant effect on TGEV induction of ROS production, suggesting that the activation of p53 might be involved in ROS production in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that TGEVinduced ROS production might promote the activation of p38 MAPK and p53, and that p53, in turn, might partly regulate ROS production.\n\nOxidative stress has been known as a mediator of apoptosis induced by a variety of triggers, including viral infection [8, 9] . Previous study indicated that an abnormal cellular oxidation event occurred during TGEV infection, which might account for cell injury and apoptosis induction [4] . To probe the relation between TGEV and oxidative stress, we investigated the direct effect of the viral infection on the oxidative profile of TGEV host cells during the stages of infection. The results showed that TGEV infection induced ROS accumulation, which played a key role in TGEV-induced apoptosis.\n\nRecently, mitochondria are regarded as sensors of oxidation damage and may play a major role in apoptosis [14, 16] . Apoptosis can be preceded by loss of selective ion permeability, leading to the formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores and the release of apoptosis initiating factors, triggering the activity of caspases [14] . Time course analysis of TGEV infected PK-15 cells showed that with ROS accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential reduced significantly, suggesting that TGEV-induced ROS accumulation lead to outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Mitochondrial oxidative damage can also increase the tendency of mitochondria to release cellular toxic proteins such as cytochrome c (cyt c) to the cytosol and thereby activate the cell's apoptotic machinery [14, 17] . In the present study, Two ROS scavengers (PDTC and NAC) significantly inhibited TGEV infection-induced Bax redistribution, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis occurrence, suggesting that ROS play a pivotal role in the process of TGEV induction of cell apoptosis.\n\nROS have also been reported that could be involved in some important signaling pathways, such as MAPK and p53 pathways [14, 18, 19] . In our present works we have demonstrated that about 60% of ROS were produced after p53 signaling was activated in TGEV infected PK-15 cells. Block of p53 activation could significantly attenuate the increase of this part of ROS. These results suggest that ROS accumulation in TGEV-infected cells is predominantly attribute to p53 activation. In addition, inhibition of ROS by NAC and PDTC could partially reduce the activation of p38 MAPK and p53, suggesting that ROS might be an upstream signal molecule involved in the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. Our results provide a link between the known mediators of apoptosis, p53 and ROS, and indicate the order in the pathway by which these mediators exert their effects ROS downstream to p53. Consistent with this model, ROS production in response to p53 occurred ahead of apoptotic death, indicating that p53-generated ROS may constitute a signal for apoptosis rather than being a consequence of the cellular changes associated with apoptosis.\n\nIn conclusion, the current investigation demonstrated that in vitro TGEV infection leads to ROS accumulation in PK-15 cells. The oxidative stress may contribute to the alteration of the intracellular events leading to apoptosis.\n\nLi Ding and Xiaomin Zhao designed the experiments, interpreted the data and wrote the article.
