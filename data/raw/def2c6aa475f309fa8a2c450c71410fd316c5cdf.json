Chiou). the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, activation of macrophage/monocyte, antiproliferative effect on normal and tumor cells, and immunoglobulin isotype switch of B cells (Charley et al., 1988; Farrar and Schreiber, 1993; Fromm and Ehrlich, 2001; Weining et al., 1996; Williams et al., 1993) .\n\nFollowing isolation of human IFN-\u2425 cDNA and gene in 1982 (Devos et al., 1982; Gray et al., 1982; Ullrich et al., 1982) , cDNA of porcine IFN-\u2425 (PoIFN-\u2425) was isolated in 1988 (Charley et al., 1988) . Nevertheless, the cDNA sequence has not been formally published. Although sequence of PoIFN-\u2425 gene was reported and aligned with human IFN-\u2425 gene to deduce the exon and intron structure (Dijkmans et al., 1990) , little is known about the polymorphism of PoIFN-\u2425 gene or cDNA. Human population studies have revealed several polymorphic sites in both intron and exon regions of human IFN-\u2425 gene (Iwasaki et al., 2001; Tiroch et al., 2005) . Two polymorphisms located in intron 1 of human IFN-\u2425 gene were further shown to affect the production of IFN-\u2425 (Pravica et al., 1999 (Pravica et al., , 2000 , and which might influence either disease manifestation of IgA nephropathy (Schena et al., 2006) , or the infection susceptibility to parvovirus B19 (Kerr et al., 2003) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Chong et al., 2006) . Nonetheless, it remains to be explored whether any polymorphic sites in the coding region of IFN-\u2425 gene may affect its protein activity.\n\nIn this study, our specific aim was to explore functional polymorphism in the coding region of PoIFN-\u2425 gene. By employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), three cDNA clones of PoIFN-\u2425 were isolated, respectively, from Duroc, Landrance/Duroc hybrid, and Landrance breeds. Nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences of these three clones were aligned and compared with that of PoIFN-\u2425 gene (Dijkmans et al., 1990) to identify any polymorphic sites. Two PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA variants were cloned, respectively, into pET32 vector for expressing rPoIFN-\u2425 proteins. By performing a pseudorabies virus (PRV)-based plaque inhibition assay, we evaluated the antiviral activity of both rPoIFN-\u2425 protein variants. Other activities of IFN-\u2425, including antiproliferative effect on cells and stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production in porcine monocytes, were also assessed.\n\nAnticoagulant blood containing 2.5 mM EDTA was collected from Duroc, Landrance/Duroc hybrid, and Landrance breeds of Sus Scrofa. Leukocytes from each breed were isolated by Histopaque (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and cultured at 37 \u2022 C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were stimulated with 40 g/ml of concanavalin A (Con A, Sigma) for 18 and 46 h, respectively.\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted from Con Astimulated leukocytes by using a FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD, USA). A total of 0.5 g of mRNAs were annealed with 0.5 g of oligo dT primer and reverse transcribed into cDNAs by AMV reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed in a 50 l reaction volume containing PCR buffer, dNTPs (0.2 mM each), cDNA template (10 ng), sense primer (20 pmole), antisense primer (20 pmole), and Taq DNA polymerase (1 U). After a denaturation step at 94 \u2022 C for 3 min, 35 PCR cycles were performed (denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55 \u2022 C for 1.5 min, extension at 72 \u2022 C for 1.5 min), followed by a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. Based on the sequence of PoIFN-\u2425 gene (Dijkmans et al., 1990) , sense primer (5 -CAGAAGCTAACTCTCTCCG-3 ) and antisense primer (5 -GTGAAATAGTCACAGGATAC-3 ) were synthesized for the amplification of coding region. PCR-amplified PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA fragment was resolved by gel electrophoresis, cloned into pCR2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. DNA fragment encoding the mature PoIFN-\u2425 protein plus NcoI/XhoI restriction sites was further amplified by PCR, and subcloned into pET32a expression vector. The resultant pETpIFN-\u2425-series plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3).\n\nSequences of three PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA clones isolated in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AY188090 (PoIFN-\u2425-W), AY188089 (PoIFN-\u2425-M) and DQ839398 (PoIFN-\u2425-L).\n\nAlignment of IFN-\u2425 cDNA sequences was performed by using DNAstar 5.0 software with clustal W program (DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA). Alignment of amino acid sequences of IFN-\u2425 among various animals was performed by using BioEdit software (Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\n\nE. coli strain carrying each pETpIFN-\u2425 variant was grown at 37 \u2022 C in Luria broth medium with ampicillin (50 g/ml). The recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl \u2424-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the OD 595 reached 0.8. Aliquot of the bacterial culture was harvested at different time points to determine the timing for optimal induction. Upon optimal induction, bacterial pellet was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1/25 volume (original culture) of binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Cells were lysed with a sonicator and rPoIFN-\u2425 protein variants were purified by affinity chromatography on a nickelchelate column (Invitrogen).\n\nBacterial pellets or purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. Each membrane was incubated with blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk and 1% normal serum in PBS) for 30 min before it was incubated with rabbit anti-PoIFN-\u2425 polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution in blocking solution) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% tween 20 (PBST), the membrane was further incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000 dilution). Finally, after PBST washings, NBT/BCIP was added for color detection.\n\nMALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed as previously described (Lin et al., 2006) . Briefly, gel plugs containing rPoIFN-\u2425 protein spots were excised from Coomassie blue stained gels to perform in-gel trypsin digestion. Using a Bruker ultraflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser and a 384 sample Scout source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), MALDI mass spectra were acquired by the reflectron mode. Peptide masses obtained were searched against a comprehensive nonredundant protein sequence database (NCBInr) using the Mascot program (Perkins et al., 1999) for protein identification.\n\nPK-15 cells (porcine kidney cells) purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) were seeded on 24-well plates (1 \u00d7 10 5 well \u22121 ) and grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Upon adhesion, cells were treated either with each rPoIFN-\u2425 protein variant expressed in this study or commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 protein (R&D systems) for overnight. After three times of washes with PBS, cells were incubated with PRV (3.4 \u00d7 10 2 PFU/well) for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. After removing unabsorbed virus, cells were covered with 1 ml of 1% methylcellulose in RPMI 1640. Three days later, cells were fixed by methanol for 10 min, stained with crystal violet, and plaque numbers were counted. Percentage of plaque formation inhibition was calculated as follows: [(mean number of plaques in the control) \u2212 (mean number of plaques in the treated sample)] \u00d7 100/(mean number of plaques in the control). IC50 was calculated as the concentration of rPoIFN-\u2425 that reached 50% of the inhibition.\n\nPK-15 cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 well \u22121 ) were cultured in 24-well plates with RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS. Cells were grown in medium (control) or treated with various concentrations of each rPoIFN-\u2425 protein variant for 72 h, washed with PBS and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 3 h with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNpp) solution to measure acid phosphatase activity. The pNpp solution was prepared as described (Connolly et al., 1986) . The reaction was stopped with 0.1 N NaOH (final concentration). The color development was determined at 405 nm using Quant spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).\n\nAdherent cells from porcine peripheral leukocytes (enriched monocytes) were cultured in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) and treated with various stimuli (in RPMI 1640/10% FBS) for 48 h. The supernatant of each stimulated culture was collected. By measuring nitrite and nitrate contents in the medium, NO production was determined with a nitric oxide colorimetric assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA).\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using a GraphPad Prism version 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Differences between groups were analyzed by two-way ANOVA.\n\nUsing primers specific for PoIFN-\u2425, we obtained PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA by RT-PCR. The PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA fragment (501 bp (Cerretti et al., 1986) , ovine (DQ410715) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/), equine (D28520) (Curran et al., 1994) , bottle-nosed dolphin (AB022044) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/), human (BC070256) (Devos et al., 1982) and murine (K00083) (Gray and Goeddel, 1983 ) IFN-\u2425. As shown in Fig. 2 , all PoIFN-\u2425 variants share higher amino acid identity to bovine (76.6% identity), ovine (77.8% identity), equine (70.1% identity) and bottle-nosed dolphin (tursiops) (80.2% identity) IFN-\u2425 than to human (59.3% identity) and murine (39.1% identity) IFN-\u2425. Both K61 and Q67 are conserved in the mammalian IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 2) . Six \u2423-helical regions are assigned according to the structure of human IFN-\u2425 (Ealick et al., 1991) .\n\nThe open reading frame (ORF) of PoIFN-\u2425 gene encodes a polypeptide of 167 amino acid residues, containing a signal peptide (23 residues) coding sequence followed by the mature protein (144 residues) coding sequence (Dijkmans et al., 1990) . The mature protein coding sequence of PoIFN-\u2425-W and PoIFN-\u2425-M cDNA was subcloned, respectively, into pET32 expression vector to generate bacterial expression constructs pETpIFN-\u2425-W and pETpIFN-\u2425-M. Upon induction with IPTG, E. coli strains carrying pETpIFN-\u2425-W and pETpIFN-\u2425-M unanimously overexpressed a recombinant protein around 33.7 kDa, which was the expected molecular mass of the mature PoIFN-\u2425 (15.8 kDa) fused with N-terminal tag (17.9 kDa). Five hours after IPTG induction, the recombinant protein reached a maximum amount and could be detected specifically by anti-PoIFN-\u2425 polyclonal antibody. Both recombinant protein variants were further purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography (Fig. 3) .\n\nPurified recombinant protein variants were treated with trypsin and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Mass spectra of trypsin-digested rPoIFN-\u2425-W and rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein variants matched to that of PoIFN-\u2425 and thioredoxin fusion tag. Table 1 shows peptide mass and corresponding amino acid sequence of PoIFN-\u2425 following trypsin cleavage of both protein variants. The 1655.867 Da peptide mass corresponding to the amino acid sequence FFEIFKDNQAIQR (residues 56-68) was detected exclusively in the spectrum of rPoIFN-\u2425-W, which carries Q67 (Fig. 4A, Table 1 ). On the other hand, the peptide mass 1527.828 Da detected in rPoIFN-\u2425-M (with R67) spectrum matched to FFEIFKDNQAIR (residues 56-67) (Fig. 4B,  Table 1 ).\n\nThe antiviral activity of both rPoIFN-\u2425-W and rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein variants was determined by a PRV-based plaque inhibition assay on PK-15 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 , both protein variants were able to inhibit the plaque formation of PRV in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). However, antivi- ral activity of rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein was significantly lower than that of rPoIFN-\u2425-W and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 (P < 0.001).\n\nWithin a concentration range of 3.1-50 nM, rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein exhibited 4.2-13.1% less of antiviral activity compared with rPoIFN-\u2425-W and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425. IC50 values for rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 were 5.3 \u00b1 1.3, 9.3 \u00b1 4.3 and 5.9 \u00b1 1.7 nM. Tag protein expressed from pET32 vector did not show any antiviral activity at concentrations up to 50 nM (data not shown).\n\nAfter incubation for 3 days, both rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein variants showed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on PK-15 cells (P < 0.001). Using tag protein expressed from pET32 as a mock control, we did not observe any antiproliferation activity at concentrations up to 50 nM (data not shown). IC50 of rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 protein was determined as 39.8 \u00b1 4, 32.5 \u00b1 1.9, and 27.1 \u00b1 0.1 nM, respectively. Commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 protein apparently exerted a better antiproliferation activity (P < 0.001) than rPoIFN-\u2425-W and rPoIFN-\u2425-M. However, no significant difference in antiproliferation activity was found between rPoIFN-\u2425-W and rPoIFN-\u2425-M (Fig. 6) .\n\nIFN-\u2425 can stimulate macrophages and monocytes to secrete NO (Kim and Son, 1996; Malu et al., 2003) . We thereby measured NO induction in monocytes by each rPoIFN-\u2425 protein variant. Untreated monocytes produced a low basal level of NO (Fig. 7) . In contrast, NO secretion increased substantially in a dose-dependent manner when monocytes were treated with various concentrations of rPoIFN-\u2425 (from 0.5 to 50 nM) (P < 0.001). However, levels of NO synthesis stimulated by rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M, and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 were not significantly different.\n\nIn this study, we identified five novel SNPs in PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA clones, including four (A269G, C376T, T426C, and T465C) from Landrance/Duroc crossbreed and one (A251G) from Landrance breed (Fig. 1) . A251G and A269G are located within exon 3 of PoIFN-\u2425 gene at nucleotide positions 68 and 86 (Dijkmans et al., 1990) . On the other hand, C376T, T426C and T465C are located within exon 4 of PoIFN-\u2425 gene at nucleotide positions 10, 60 and 99 (Dijkmans et al., 1990) . Four SNPs detected in PoIFN-\u2425-M (Landrance/Duroc) were absent in both PoIFN-\u2425-W (Duroc) and PoIFN-\u2425-L (Landrance), indicating that these SNPs may not be breed-specific. Allelic frequencies of these polymorphisms between Landrance and Duroc breeds, nevertheless, require further investigation. A269G polymorphism in PoIFN-\u2425-M would change the coded amino acid sequence (Q67R). A251G polymorphism in PoIFN-\u2425-L would also result in one amino acid replacement (K61R). Both K61 (within helix C) and Q67 (near helix D) are conserved in the mammalian IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 2) . However, we expect that the impact of K61R (PoIFN-\u2425-L), a similar amino acid replacement, would be minor. On the other hand, Q67R that increases positive charge of the protein variant (PoIFN-\u2425-M) could be a significant replacement. Consequently, in this study we expressed both PoIFN-\u2425-M (R67) and PoIFN-\u2425-W (Q67) variants to compare their biological activities. Interestingly, our results showed that Q67R could clearly inhibit antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u2425.\n\nAntiviral activity of PoIFN-\u2425 has been demonstrated in vitro on several swine viruses, including African swine fever (Esparza et al., 1988) , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Charley et al., 1988) , influenza virus (Horisberger, 1992) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Bautista and Molitor, 1999; Buddaert et al., 1998) , and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (Suradhat et al., 2001) . All these viruses are RNA viruses that are highly sensitive to the antiviral mechanism of interferon. Instead of using RNA viruses, we evaluated the antiviral effect of PoIFN-\u2425 on pseudorabies virus, a DNA virus. PRV, a swine alphaherpesvirus, is distantly related to the human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Unlike HSV-1 that is well known for its anti-interferon mechanism, PRV lacks homologs of some anti-IFN genes (e.g. \u242534.5 and Us11) of HSV-1 and the viral growth could be inhibited in IFN-\u2424 treated PK-15 cells (Brukman and Enquist, 2006) . The result of this study showed that PoIFN-\u2425 inhibited PRV in a dose-dependent manner, although the dosage of IFN-\u2425 used for PRV inhibition assay was higher than that for other RNA viruses. Therefore, we have established a PRV-based plaque inhibition assay to determine antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u2425. Except for carrying an extra fusion peptide encoded by pET32 vector at N-terminus, the amino acid sequence of rPoIFN-\u2425-W was identical to that of commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 protein (Vandenbroeck et al., 1991) . The fact that antiviral activities of rPoIFN-\u2425-W and commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 proteins were not significantly different indicated that the fusion peptide did not interfere with antiviral activity of IFN-\u2425. Results from plaque inhibition assay showed that rPoIFN-\u2425-W presented a better antiviral activity than rPoIFN-\u2425-M protein (P < 0.001). The missense polymorphism, Q67R, indeed has an impact on the biological activity of PoIFN-\u2425-M protein, and this is the first report that identified a functional SNP in the coding region of IFN-\u2425.\n\nIn terms of antiproliferative effect (Friesel et al., 1987; Hansson et al., 1988; Maekawa et al., 1988) , our data showed that both rPoIFN-\u2425-M and rPoIFN-\u2425-W expressed comparably lower antiproliferation activity than commercial rPoIFN-\u2425 (P < 0.001) on PK-15 cells. This could be resulted from the interference of fusion peptide carried in rPoIFN-\u2425-M and rPoIFN-\u2425-W proteins. In addition to growth inhibition, activation of macrophage/monocyte is another important immunoregulatory activity of IFN-\u2425. Measuring IFN-\u2425-induced NO secretion in macrophages is a common bioassay for evaluating the activity of murine IFN-\u2425 (Kim and Son, 1996; Malu et al., 2003) . Instead of using macrophages, we measured PoIFN-\u2425-induced NO secretion in porcine monocytes because peripheral monocytes were more easily obtained from pigs. Our result showed that, in response to PoIFN-\u2425 stimulation, porcine peripheral monocytes produced NO in a dose-dependent manner. Nonetheless, induction levels of NO were not significantly different among monocytes treated with rPoIFN-\u2425-W, rPoIFN-\u2425-M, or commercial rPoIFN-\u2425. Taken altogether, Q67R and fusion peptide in the rPoIFN-\u2425 protein can, respectively, reduce antiviral activity and antiproliferation activity of IFN-\u2425, with little effect on NO induction. Our data indicate that these three activities reside in independent functional domains of PoIFN-\u2425.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified five novel SNPs in PoIFN-\u2425 cDNA, including two missense polymorphisms that result in Q67R and K61R replacements. Interestingly, Q67R can markedly reduce antiviral activity of PoIFN-\u2425 protein. This in and of itself could warrant a potential association with a yet to be determined disease mechanism, of which the reduced immune response may lead to high susceptibility of virus infection."}
