{"title": "Glycosyltransferases promote development and prevent promiscuous cell", "body": "The evolution of multicellular eukaryotes from their single-celled ancestors was a 42 major transition in evolutionary history and allowed for the subsequent origin and 43 diversification of complex macroscopic life (Leigh et al., 1995) . However, despite the 44 centrality of multicellularity to the origin and diversification of animals, little is known 45 about the genetic and developmental mechanisms that precipitated the transition to 46 multicellularity in the animal stem lineage. Although the first animals evolved over 600 47\n\nCouscous (previously named Branched in Levin et al., 2014 ) -that form amorphous, 110 tightly packed clumps of cells, both in the presence and absence of RIFs, but never 111 develop into rosettes (Table 1 ; Figure 1A ,B). We found that the clumps contain a few to 112 hundreds of mutant cells that pack together haphazardly, unlike wild type rosettes in 1-figure supplement 1). Therefore, the cell clumps are not aberrant rosettes, which 127 never form through aggregation and instead require at least 15 -24 hours to develop 128 clonally through serial rounds of cell division (Dayel et al., 2011; Fairclough et al., 2010) . 129\n\nThe fact that the seven Class C mutants isolated in this screen were also defective in Strain (which contains previously identified sequence variants); (2) isolating 152 heterozygous diploids identified through genotyping at a microsatellite on supercontig 1; 153\n\n(3) inducing meiosis; (4) growing clonal cultures of haploid F1 offspring; (5) phenotyping 154 the F1 offspring; (6) pooling F1 offspring based on their clumping phenotype; and (7) 155 deeply sequencing pooled genomic DNA from the F1 mutants to find mutations that 156 segregated perfectly with the clumping phenotype ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1) . 157\n\nTo test whether a bulk segregant approach would work in S. rosetta, we first 158 analyzed a cross between the previously mapped Rosetteless mutant and the Mapping 159\n\nStrain (Levin et al., 2014) . We isolated 38 F1s with the rosette defect phenotype from a 160\n\nMapping Strain\u00b4Rosetteless cross (Levin et al., 2014) , grew clonal cultures from each, 161 pooled the resulting cultures, extracted their genomic DNA, and sequenced the pooled 162 mutant genomes to an average coverage of 187X. Against a background of sequence 163 variants that did not segregate perfectly with the Rosetteless phenotype, five unlinked 164 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were found to 165 perfectly segregate with the phenotype (Table S2 ). Four of these detected sequence 166 variants likely had spurious correlations with the phenotype resulting from relatively low 167 sequencing coverage at those variants (>0.25X coverage of the entire genome) ( Table  168 S2). In contrast, the remaining SNV was detected in a well-assembled portion of the 169 genome at a sequencing depth approaching the average coverage of the entire 170 genome. The perfectly segregating SNV, at position 427,804 on supercontig 8, was 171 identical to the causative mutation identified in Levin et al., 2014 (Table S2) . Thus, a 172 method based on pooling F1 haploid mutants, identifying sequence variants that 173 perfectly segregated with the phenotype, and masking those SNVs/INDELs that were 174 detected with >0.25X coverage of the total genome was effective for correctly 175 pinpointing the causal mutation for Rosetteless (Figure 2-figure supplement 1 Jumble that segregated perfectly with both the clumping and rosette defects. Only one 199 of these -at position 1,919,681 on supercontig 1 -had sequencing coverage of at least 200 .

In a backcross of mutant F1 progeny to the Mapping Strain, we confirmed the tight 202 linkage of the SNV to the rosette defect phenotype ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, all F2 203 progeny that displayed a rosette defect also had a clumping phenotype. Given the tight 204 linkage of both traits with the SNV and the absence of any detectable neighboring 205 sequence variants, we infer that the single point mutation at genome position 206 1:1,919,681 causes both the clumping and rosette defect phenotypes in Jumble 207\n\nThe mutation causes a T to C transition in a gene hereafter called jumble 209 (GenBank accession EGD72416/NCBI accession XM_004998928; Figure 2A Figure 2C ,D). We were able to enrich for rare transfected cells by 219 using a construct in which the puromycin resistance gene (pac) was expressed under 220 the same promoter as the jumble fusion gene, with the two coding sequences separated 221 by a sequence encoding a self-cleaving peptide (Kim et al., 2011) .

One possibility is that the disruption of ECM 409 glycosylation that we hypothesize might promote clumping may also prevent the proper 410 maturation of the ECM needed for rosette development ( crosses; here, we report which method was used to generate data for each individual 508 cross.

For both Seafoam and Soapsuds, 523\n\nwe were able to generate putative outcrossed diploids by crossing to the Mapping Strain 524 based on the genotyping marker on supercontig 1, but we only could only clonally 525 isolate populations of F1 haploids with rosettes and never isolated any F1 haploids with 526 the clumpy, rosetteless phenotype. 527 cells, were identified through genotyping by PCR at a supercontig 1 microsatellite as 538 described above.

Isolates were genotyped with the marker on supercontig 1 to 547 ensure that independent assortment of the genotype and the phenotype indeed 548 occurred. In total, 30 clumpy F1s were collected for bulk segregation analysis. 549\n\nFor the successful Couscous cross, we induced mating using V. fisheri Couscous and Mapping Strain cells at stationary growth were pelleted and resuspended 552 in 5% V. fischeri conditioned media in ASW (vol/vol). After 24 hr, the cells were pelleted, 553 resuspended in 5% HN media in ASW (vol/vol), and allowed to recover for 24 hr. We 554 then isolated clones by limiting dilution in 10% CG media in ASW (vol/vol). The 555 probability of clonal isolation in this step was between 0.97-0.98. We extracted DNA as 556 described above and identified heterozygous clones through genotyping by PCR at a 557 single microsatellite genotyping marker on supercontig 1. Four clonally isolated 558 heterozygous populations, containing almost exclusively thecate cells, were identified. 559\n\nTo induce meiosis, heterozygotes were passaged 1:2 in 25% CG media in ASW 560 (vol/vol) every 1-2 days for 8 days.

We 562 collected any clonally isolated populations that formed rosettes or clumps and ignored 563 any wells containing thecate cells assuming that these represented diploid cells that had 564 not undergone meiosis. Only 14.6% of non-thecate isolates were clumps; this deviation 565 from a Mendelian ratio (\u03a7 2 =225.63, df=1, p<0. 5.34 -51 ) may indicate a potential fitness 566 .

The heterozygotes were rapidly 620 passaged for 2 weeks to induce meiosis before being plated for clonal isolation 621 (probability of clonal isolation 0.95-0.98). 12 F2s with the clumpy phenotype and 9 F2s 622 with the rosette phenotype were identified ( Figure 2B ). Their DNA was extracted using 623 Base-Tris method described above and the region around the causal mutation was 624 amplified.
