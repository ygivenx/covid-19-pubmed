{"title": "Acute bronchitis in the community: clinical features, infective factors, changes in pulmonary function and bronchial reactivity to histamine", "body": "Acute bronchitis is a condition diagnosed commonly in general practice, particularly in the winter months, reaching rates of approximately 150 cases per 100 000 population per week (1) . It is presumed that most episodes of acute bronchitis are viral in origin, although previous work, with one exception (2) has studied children (3) (4) (5) or patients with underlying pulmonary disease (6) (7) (8) and has shown only modest rates of virus identification and very low rates of bacterial isolation. There is also the diagnostic problem ofidentifying whether an individual patient has simple acute bronchitis: in many patients, particularly children, the diagnosis of asthma is missed (9) . It is believed that the acute effect of such an illness on pulmonary function is minimal and does not contribute to the development of chronic airflow obstruction (10) . However, upper respiratory tract infections may produce changes in pulmonary function as indicated by a reduction in gas transfer (11) , increase in closing volumes in smokers (12) , and a fall in dynamic compliance (13) . In addition, uncomplicated influenza has been shown to produce a transient fall in forced expired volume in 1 second and arterial oxygen concentration (14) , The Received 24 November 1989 and accepted 11 May 1990. effect of viral infections on bronchial hyperreactivity is uncertain (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) and epidemiological studies in the community give conflicting results with respect to respiratory tract infections and bronchial hyperreactivity (20,2 I) . In view of the continuing apparent difficulty in separating acute bronchitis from asthma, this descriptive study was undertaken to examine the clinical, microbiological and pulmonary function aspects of the illness being diagnosed as acute bronchitis in patients with no pre-existing pulmonary disease.\n\nPatients diagnosed as having acute bronchitis by the general practitioner (GP) were studied. No criteria for the diagnosis of acute bronchitis were given to the GPs, except that patients with previously diagnosed pulmonary disease were excluded from the study. The study was undertaken in a local general practice with four partners and a practice population of 7700. Sequential patients were recruited into the study between September 1986 and March 1987 and were studied on presentation and at 2 and 6 weeks. On presentation, demographic data were collected and symptoms were recorded using questions from the MRC/ PHLS study (22) . Three methods were used to determine potential pathogens.\n\nNPW were obtained for viral culture. A size 10 physiotherapy suction catheter was cut 5\" from the distal end and a mucus trap inserted between the two cut ends of the catheter. The proximal end of the catheter was attached to a mechanical pump (Vacuaide Model 721, DeVilbiss Health Care). With the patient lying on his/her back and the neck extended slightly, the distal end of the catheter was introduced through the nares into the posterior naso-pharynx. Suction was commenced as 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline was introduced into the opposite nares to aid flow back to the mucus 'trap and to keep the specimen moist until transfer to the laboratory. The washings were inoculated onto four cell lines: monkey kidney, human embryo lung, HEP-2 and MRC-5. The cultures were incubated, rolling at 33~ for a minimum of 2 weeks.\n\nSerum was taken on presentation and 2 weeks later for paired complement fixation tests for antibodies to Influenza types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A four fold rise in antibody titre was considered indicative of a recent infection. Some patients had high titres of M.pneumoniae antibodies at both visits and identification of recent infection was sought by demonstration of IgM antibody in the initial samples (23) .\n\nSputum samples were obtained from patients who were able to produce a specimen during the initial consultation and were sent for routine bacteriological culture.\n\nVenous blood was taken for full blood count and a interferon (aIFN) on presentation only, and serum lgE at both presentation and 6 weeks, aIFN was measured using a radioimmunoassay method (Boots Celltech); levels > 1 IUml-' were regarded as suggestive of infection (24) . Specimens for IgE were separated, the sera frozen at --20~ and measured in batches at the end of the study by the PRIST technique (Pharmacia).\n\nOn presentation, skin prick testing was performed to cat fur, Dermatophagoides pteronyss#lus, grass pollens and a saline control (Bencard, Brentford). Weal diameters were measured at 15 rain as the mean of two transverse diameters, 90 ~ to each other, one of which was the maximum measurable weal diameter. Any response >3 mm diameter with a negative control was regarded as positive.\n\nSpirometry and peak expiratory flow were performed on presentation and at 2 weeks and 6 weeks. Forced expired volume in 1 second (FEV t) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) were recorded using the same dry bellows spirometer (Vitalograph) throughout the study; three attempts reproducible to within 200ml were made and the best FEV, and FVC recorded. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured using a Wright mini peak flow meter and the best of three attempts recorded. At the first two visits, the response to inhaled bronchodilators was assessed by repeating all measurements 15 rain after inhalation of 1.5 mg terbutaline through a spacer device (Nebuhaler, Astra Ltd).\n\nAt the third visit (6 weeks), histamine challenge test (HCT) was performed using the Yah method (25), until either a 20% fall in the post saline FEV~ was recorded or the maximum dose ofhistamine (7.8/lmol) was administered. The PD20 FEV~ was used in analysis. A positive HCT was regarded as one in which the PD_, 0 FEV~ was < 7.8,umols (26) . HCTs were not performed in patients who were unable to produce FEV~ values reproducible to within 200 ml prior to HCT. Patients were asked to refrain from taking any bronchodilator medication from the evening before, and requested not to smoke in the 2 h before the test. After completion of the test, 1-5 mg of terbutaline was administered and spirometry repeated until the FEV~ was > 95% of the pre-test value. Those patients in whom HCT was performed at 6 weeks were asked to return 1 year later for repeat spirometry and HCT.\n\nPredicted values for pulmonary function tests in children were calculated from Cotes (27) and for adults from ECCS (28); for patients aged 16-25 the adult reference table was used. Standardized residual (SR) valueswere calculated for each adult individual for each visit (29) . ANALYSIS Serum IgE data were log transformed prior to analysis. Student's t-test on paired and unpaired sami3ies was used where appropriate in analysis and the Chlsquared test and Fishers exact probability test were used for 2 \u2022 2 contingency tables. CONSENT Written informed consent was obtained from each patient and the study was passed by the local Ethical Committee. \n\nInitially, patients of all ages were entered into the study at both morning and evening surgeries. However, because of incompleteness of data (no pulmonary function tests in patients under 12-years-old, and no presentation pulmonary function for evening surgery patients), the paper describes the results of patients aged 12 years or over referred for study from the morning surgery only.\n\nDuring the study period, forty-two episodes were investigated in 40 such patients. Thirty patients attended both follow-up appointments, four attended one only and 6 did not attend either follow-up appointments, an overall re-attendance rate of 81%.\n\nDemographic data are shown in Table 1 . Female patients predominated in a ratio of 2.2:1 and the mean (SD) age of the whole group was 37'5 (16.5) years (range from 12-73 years). Twenty episodes (48%) occurred in current cigarette smokers, including two patients referred twice, one being a current smoker at both visits and one a current smoker at her second visit only. There was a family history of atopic disease in 18 out of 40 cases (47%) SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS Acute onset of cough was reported by all patients, being productive in 90% ofcases. (See Fig. 1 for a full listing of symptoms and signs.) Wheezing was noted by 62% of patients, coryza by 71% and sore throat by 57%. A variety of less specific symptoms were also reported, notably sweating (60%) and headache (50%). Symptoms were reported with equal frequency by males and females. Clinical signs were recorded by the GP in 18 cases (43%), wheeze being noted in 13 (31%) and crackles in ten (24%). Delay in presentation to the GP after the onset of symptoms varied from 2-35 days [median 7 days; mean (SD) 10 (9) days] ( Figure  2 ). Twenty six patients (62%) had had symptoms for less than 1 week before presentation (Fig. 2) . Current smokers had symptoms for a mean of 10.1 days compared to 8.7 days in nonsmokers and exsmokers (not significant). Patients between the ages of 20 and 60 were less likely to present to their GP within 5 days of the onset of the illness than younger or older patients (P < 0.02).\n\nThe virology and bacteriology of the patients investigated are given in Table 2 . NPW was generally well tolerated. A virus was isolated in seven out of 38 (18%) patients in whom NPW was performed on presentation, 4 rhinoviruses and three Influenza A. Four of the 13 (31%) in whom NPW was performed within 5 days of the onset of symptoms, were positive compared to three of the 25 (12%) performed after 5 days, but this was not a significant difference. Serology confinaaed the three Influenza A infections, and also detected one adenovirus (NPW negative Table 2 ).\n\nThe total white blood cell count (WBCC) was above the reference range (> 10-8 x 1091 *) in eight out of 37 cases tested (22%). Six patients had mildly elevated total white blood counts (range 10.9-11.9 x 1091-*), while two patients showed more substantial elevations (14.0 and 19-4x 10~1 ~). However, a potential pathogen was demonstrated in only one of these patients (total WBCC 11,1 x 10~ -*), (Patient 4, Table 2 ).\n\nA positive skin prick test to at least one allergen was observed in 15 out of 40 patients (37.5%). Patients under 20 years of age were significantly more likely to have a positive skin prick test result (6/6 compared to 9/34; P = 0.0026).\n\nOne TREATMENT Thirty-nine of the 42 (93%) episodes were treated with a course of antibiotics, those prescribed being erythromycin (ll), amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid (7), a drug trial antibiotic (7), tetracycline (5), cefaclor (4), cotrimoxazole (3), amoxycillin (2), and penicillin V (1) (one patient received two antibiotics).\n\nResults of the pulmonary function tests are given in Table 3 . The mean FEV) rose from 2\"71 (87% predicted) on presentation to 2.81 (92% predicted) at 2 weeks (P<0.0I) and to 2.71 (91% predicted) at 6 HISTAMINE CHALLENGE TESTS Histamine challenge tests were performed on 29 occasions in 27 patients at 6 weeks (two patients presenting twice had two HCT performed) ( Table 4 ). Eleven of the 29 cases (38%) had a PD20 of < 7.8/~mol at 6 weeks. The mean SR FEV~ at presentation of patients with a positive HCT was significantly lower than the mean SR FEV I of patients with a negative HCT (-1.77 vs. -0\"80, P<0'05) (Fig. 3) . A positive HCT at 6 weeks was significantly correlated with a > 15% bronchodilator response in FEV I on presentation (P=0.024), but with no other variable. HCTs were not performed in 13 patients (nonattenders at 6 weeks, 9; unable to produce reproducible spirometric curves, 2; ischaemic heart disease, 1 ; refused, I).\n\nThe 29 patients were recalled for repeat HCT a year later. Eighteen patients re-attended (59%), six of whom originally had a positive HCT. Three remained reactive, and one further patient who was not reactive originally, showed a PD20 FEV~ of 5.0, 12 months later. The change in bronchial hyperreactivity between the two visits for all patients was within one doubling dilution except for one patient who had a respiratory tract infection 4 weeks prior to repeat HCT (Patient 6, Table 4 ) and two patients who had been started on inhaled steroids by the GP during the intervening year (Patients 4 and 9, Table 4 ), whose PD:0s had fallen.\n\nBased on the weekly returns data for the years 1976 to 1983, the mean annual attack rate for acute bronchitis is 87 cases per 100 000 population per week (l). Hospital inpatient enquiry data suggests that less than 0.25% of cases of acute bronchitis are admitted to hospital. Thus, acute bronchitis is a common illness managed largely by general practitioners. The weekly returns data on acute bronchitis from the Research Unit of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RURCGP) demonstrate a consistent pattern with the highest attack rises being seen in winter months ( 1 ), in the very young and in the elderly. This age pattern differs fr6m that observed it] the present study because we excluded cases of acute hronchiolitis and exacerbations of chronic airflow obstruction (both of which are included in the RURCGP figures) and asthma, a condition often missed and mislabelled 'acute bronchitis' in general practice. In addition, we probably lost cases by allowing the option of other diagnoses such as chest infection. The advantage of this study, however, is that patients were investigated in whom the GP had made a diagnosis of what s/he regarded as acute bronchitis. It is possible, but unlikely, that some patients may have had pneumonia on presentation, since previous work of lower respiratory tract infection in the community (excluding clinical pneumonia) showed new X-ray changes in only 2.3% of patients (30) .\n\nA variety of definitions of acute bronchitis have been proposed (31) (32) (33) . Since ours was a descriptive study, we chose to allow the GPs free rein to determine what they regarded as acute bronchitis. Interestingly, the results of the MRC/PHLS study-where acute bronchitis was defined as 'productive cough and rhonchi' (33)-and our study are strikingly similar (Fig. 1) suggesting that, in this general practice at least, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is following defined lines.\n\nA potential pathogen was identified in only 30% of cases, despite the short time between sample and inoculation of cultures (less than 3 h), a finding similar to previous studies in adults with asthma (7), acute exacerbations of chronic airflow obstruction (6, 8) and children with wheezy bronchitis (3) (4) (5) . Three factors contributed to this finding. Firstly, where patients were able to determine the duration ofsymptoms, 62% stated that symptoms had been present for 6 or more days. Since viral shedding declines quickly after the onset of infection, delay in investigation, such as was seen in our study, may be a major reason for failing to identify a viral pathogen. This is further supported by the lack of detectable alFN in all but one of our patients, alFN being present only transiently after the initial infection (24) . Secondly, serological investigation was performed for a limited number of respiratory viruses, the major omissions being coronaviruses, which usually produce a coryzal illness (34) and parainfluenza viruses for which serology is unreliable. Thirdly, it has been suggested that sputum might be a better source for viral culture than NPW or throat swabs (4) . In our study, only 31% were able to produce asputum specimen at the time of consultation, despite having a history of productive cough. NPW was well Finally, there is the possibility that some of these attacks may not have been due to any infective agent, but instead might have been misdiagnosed asthma precipitated by, for example, changes in temperature or acute bronchitis attacks associated with other environmental factors.\n\nThe M. pneumoniae infections and the Influenza A infections both occurred in defined outbreaks, the former occurring at the end of the recent Mycoplasma epidemic and the latter occurring in November/ December, Influenza infections can result in a variety of clinical syndromes ranging fl'om seroconversion without overt illness (35) , through acute bronchitis (2), to fulminating pneumonia, but it is perhaps not well recognized as a cause of simple acute bronchitis.\n\nBacteria were fotmd infrequently (in only three cases) and there were no features that distinguished these cases from the others investigated. The bacterial identification rate was lower than the studies of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (6, 8) which is what might be expected, in view of the colonization of the respiratory tract by bacteria in patients with chronic airways disease.\n\nThis study was descriptive in nature and so a control group was not recruited. The MRC/PHLS study (2) included a control group and showed significantly lower microbiological identification rates in these individuals than the patient groups. We believe therefore, that it is likely that the micro-organisms we identified were responsible for the illness.\n\nIn our population, there was a significant reduction in both FEV t and PEF, improving over 6 weeks by 4% and 9% respectively, whilst the change in FVC was less marked. These findings are similar to those of Johanssen et al. in patients with influenza uncomplicated by pneumonia (14) . In some patients there is an element of smooth muscle constriction since nearly one third of patients bronchodilated with inhaled terbutaline on presentation.\n\nAssessment of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) was not performed until 6 weeks after the initial presentation. In the past, patients with upper respiratory tract infection have had HCTs performed safely on presentation (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , and since we found only minor changes in pulmonary function, we feel that HCT could be performed on presentation in future studies. Ideally, premorbid HCTs would be needed to assess viral induced changes in BHR, but this would be logistically a major task, but HCTs on presentation may point to an initial even higher degree of reactivity. A positive HCT was observed in 41% of patients, despite having excluded patients with known asthma or chronic airflow obstruction. The prewtlence of BHR in this group, therefore, is higher than that observed in epidemiological studies in this country (20) . A proportion &these cases may be 'missed' asthma, but the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity was slight, with only one individual in the range regarded as \"moderate' hyperreactivity by Woolcock and colleagues (26) . The bronchial hyperreactivity may be transient due to the recent infection (15) , but because we did not perform HCT on presentation, it is not possible to examine this point more closely. Alternatively, the patients with bronchial hyperreactivity may be more liable than normal individuals to develop lower respiratory tract involvement with a viral respiratory tract infection and may be individuals with the 'bronchial irritability syndrome' identified by Mortagy et al. (36) . Epidemiological studies would only identify such patients ifquestions wereasked about lower respiratory tract infections/symptoms.\n\nIn our study, 93% ofpatients were treated with antibiotics. The benign outcome in all but the one case of lingular pneumonia (who had been given antibiotics on presentation) may be due to the antibiotics reducilag the possibility of secondary bacterial infection, or to the illness being induced by a virus or even rnisdiagnoscd asthma. Many patients commented that the inhalation of terbutaline helped ease their cough at the initial consultation and it may prove a useful symptomatic treatment. Further studies could assess whether inhaled steroids or other inhaled anti-inflammatory agents, such as disodium cromoglycate or nedocromil sodium, may be of benefit in managing this inflammatory condition."}
