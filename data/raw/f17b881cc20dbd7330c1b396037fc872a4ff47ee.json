{"title": "Plasma citrulline, arginine, nitric oxide, and blood ammonia levels in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea", "body": "primarily in the small bowel include diarrhea, dehydration, malnutrition, potentially systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, and even death. 1, 4, 5 Citrulline (CIT), a nonprotein amino acid, is involved in arginine (ARG) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and the urea cycle. 6, 7 Synthesized from glutamine primarily in the small intestine, CIT is released from enterocytes into blood. 8, 9 For this reason, since the early 2000s, plasma CIT concentration has been used as a biomarker for enterocyte mass and absorptive function in various intestinal diseases [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and sepsis 16, 17 in humans, independent of nutritional and inflammatory status. 18 Therefore, it could be useful to predict the health and function of the intestine in calves. NO is known to have various physiological functions, including neurotransmission, immune defense, and organ perfusion and play a key role in various pathological processes.\n\nARG is the only substrate for synthesis of NO. 19 Approximately 80% of CIT is converted to ARG in the kidneys and plays an important role in providing an ARG/NO balance through different mechanisms. 7, 16 Ammonia is a toxic compound and excessive blood ammonia concentration might result in respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and death. 20, 21 CIT and ARG play a key role in detoxifying ammonia in the urea cycle. 21 Deficiencies of CIT and ARG might underlie the negative consequences of inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis and endotoxemia. 13, 16, 17 In veterinary medicine, plasma CIT concentration has only been investigated to demonstrate acute small bowel injury and measure its prognostic significance in dogs with parvoviral enteritis. 22 Therefore, this study aimed to compare plasma CIT, ARG, and NO and whole blood ammonia concentrations in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea to those in healthy calves and to evaluate their possible associations with diarrhea-related criteria. We hypothesized that neonatal calves with acute diarrhea would have reduced plasma CIT and ARG concentrations and increased plasma NO and blood ammonia, resulting from intestinal damage.\n\nThis observational case-control study was conducted based on approval of the Aydin Adnan Menderes University Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee (number: 64583101/121, October 27, 2015) . Informed written consent was obtained from all owners before enrollment. A total of 70 neonatal Holstein calves (<28 days old) of both genders, including 10 healthy and 60 with acute diarrhea, were used in this study. Sixty calves with acute diarrhea were classified into subgroups as follows: infectious and noninfectious based on etiology; mild, moderate, and severe diarrhea according to fecal consistency scores, 23 mild, moderate, and severe dehydration based on dehydration evaluation criteria 24, 25 ; SIRS positive and negative based on SIRS criteria. 26 Faculty of Veterinary Livestock Unit in individual stalls where disinfection was provided by appropriate methods. They received colostrum in 10% of the body weight on each day of the first 2 days of life (first intake within 2 hours after birth). Colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were measured by Brix refractometer to assess colostrum quality. On the second day after birth, serum IgG and total protein levels were measured with Brix refractometer to determine the immunity status of the calves. Calves with a serum total protein cut-point of \u226455 g/L were not enrolled in the study. The calves were fed 2 times a day with individual milk bottles. Water was provided ad libitum.\n\nAccess to good quality calf starter and forage was provided from the third week. During the study, no vaccination or medications were applied to the calves. Physical examinations of each calf were performed daily. Hematological, biochemical, and blood gas analyses as well as fecal examination were performed at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of age. One calf that did not meet the health criteria was excluded from study and a new neonatal calf was enrolled to the study and followed until its 28 th day of life.\n\nSixty diarrheic calves within the same age range enrolled in this study were obtained from the faculty farm affiliated to the university, the clinic for internal medicine and the 14 different small-to-medium sized enterprises in a total of 20 km 2 around the faculty between April 2016 and October 2017. The diarrheic calves had not previously received any treatment. Acute diarrhea was assessed by evaluating:\n\n(1) fecal consistency, content and color; (2) defecation frequency (>4 times per day); and (3) intensity (abundant aqueous, mucous, bloody) and duration of diarrhea. 28 Calves with congenital malformations or surgical problems were excluded from the study.\n\nStool specimens underwent etiologic evaluation against 5 important enteropathogens in NCD-C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, ETEC F5, and Giardia duodenalis-by immunochromatography with a rapid commercial test kit (Bovid-5 Ag, Bionote, Korea). The diarrheic calves with 1 or more enteropathogens were assigned to the infectious diarrhea group. Calves with negative results to infectious agents according to laboratory examination findings were enrolled to the noninfectious diarrhea group.\n\nAll physical examinations were conducted in accordance with a standardized protocol 24,25 by the same person who was blinded to all laboratory values. Each examination determined rectal temperature, sucking reflex, fecal consistency, capillary refill time, and heart and respiratory rates. Severity of diarrhea was graded according to fecal consistency.\n\nFecal scores (FS) were assigned on a 4 point scale; 0 = normal (retains form/does not flow across a surface), 1 = mild diarrhea (flows slowly across a surface), 2 = moderate diarrhea (fairly watery/flows easily across a surface leaving adherent material), and 3 = severe diarrhea (very watery/leaves no residue when flowing across a surface). 23 Grading of dehydration in diarrheic calves was determined by clinical findings, such as skin tent, eyeball position, mucous membrane dryness, and mentation, and then these calves were subclassified as mild (6-8%), moderate (8-10%), and severely (10-12%) dehydrated. 3, 24, 28 \n\nBlood samples were taken at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of age from the healthy calves to obtain a homogeneous distribution during the neonatal period and were taken only once in the calves with acute diarrhea.\n\nHealthy control calves were routinely fasted for at least 8 hours before all numerical data within each study group were checked for normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Shapiro-Wilk tests. Nonnormally distributed variables were log transformed for analysis or analyzed by nonparametric methods. The measurements were analyzed in total and separately by group with the groups formed by diarrhea etiology, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and SIRS status. Diarrheic subgroups classified by the above mentioned criteria compared with age-matched healthy controls. For normally distributed data with or without transformation, Student's t test was used for comparisons between 2 groups (healthy controls vs all diarrheic calves), and 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test was performed for comparisons among 3 or more groups (healthy controls and diarrheic subgroups). For data not normally distributed even after transformation, comparisons among groups were made by nonparametric tests (2 groups: Mann-Whitney U-test; 3 or more groups: Kruskal-Wallis test). Friedman's test was used to determine for changes in plasma CIT, ARG, NO, and blood ammonia concentrations over time in the healthy control group. Regression analysis was performed to assess the associations among plasma CIT, ARG, and NO, and blood ammonia concentrations and potential explanatory variables, namely age of calf (day), the presence of SIRS (no = 0; yes = 1) and etiology of diarrhea (noninfectious = 0; infectious = 1) in the diarrheic calves. Initially, simple linear regression was performed. A multiple linear regression by backward method was then constructed, which initially included any variables identified as P value <.2 on univariable analysis. One-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the influences of severity of diarrhea (mild = 0, moderate = 1, and severe = 2) and degree of dehydration (mild = 0, moderate = 1, and severe = 2) on plasma CIT and its related metabolites, after effect of the covariate, calf age, was controlled. Effect sizes were interpreted by Cohen's guidelines for the partial eta-squared (\u03b7p2) values. 31 Data were expressed as mean (deviation) or median (ranges) based on the results of the normality test. All analyses were considered statistically significant at P < .05. Table 1 . In this study, mono-infection with C. parvum (42%) and coinfection with C. parvum + rotavirus (22%) were identified as the most common agents in diarrheic calves (Table 1) .\n\nFeces were usually characterized as brown to light green or yellow with or without blood and mucus, with a consistency varying from semisolid to very watery and a strong, unpleasant odor. Clinical signs in diarrheic calves ranged from normal to marked changes in posture and behavior, from strong to absent suckling reflex, and from slight to severe delay in skin tenting. The rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate in diarrheic calves varied from 33.5 to 40.7 C, 60-185 beats/min, and 15-80 breaths/min as minimum and maximum values, respectively, and did not differ from the healthy control calves (Table 2) .\n\nFurther demographic information and the statistical evaluation of laboratory findings in control and diarrheic calves are summarized in Table 2 . Overall, calves with acute diarrhea had higher WBC, K, AST, creatinine and urea, NO and blood ammonia, and lower pH, HCO 3 , BE, total protein, CIT, and ARG values than healthy control calves (Table 2) , and the differences in plasma CIT and its related metabolites remained important after adjusting for age. There was a significant effect of time on plasma CIT (P = .03), ARG (P < .001), NO (P = .01), and blood ammonia concentrations (P = .008) in the healthy control group during the neonatal period (Supporting information Figure S1 ). significantly lower in the infectious diarrhea ( Figure 1B ), in FS 3 ( Figure 2B ), severe dehydration ( Figure 3B) , and SIRS-positive subgroups ( Figure 4B ) than in the healthy control group. In addition, plasma ARG concentrations were significantly lower in the severe dehydrated subgroup than in the mild dehydration subgroup (P = .03) and in the SIRS-positive subgroup than in the SIRS-negative subgroup (P < .001).\n\nPlasma NO and blood ammonia concentrations were significantly higher in the infectious diarrhea subgroups than in the control group ( Figure 1C,D) . Plasma NO concentration was higher in severe diarrhea (FS 3) subgroup ( Figure 2C ) whereas blood ammonia concentration was higher in both moderate (P < .01) and severe diarrhea (P < .001) subgroups ( Figure 2D ). Both variables were also significantly higher in the severe dehydrated diarrheic subgroup than in the healthy control group ( Figure 3C,D) , as well as the mild (P < .001) and moderate dehy- The relationships between plasma CIT and its related variables and independent variables (age, diarrhea etiology, SIRS status) by linear regression in diarrheic calves are presented in Table 3 . There was no significant effect of age on plasma log-transformed CIT, ARG, and NO as well as blood ammonia concentrations. By contrast, the pres- Furthermore, diarrhea etiology was found to be positively associated with plasma log-transformed NO and blood ammonia (Table 3 ).\n\nAn ANCOVA revealed no effect of severity of diarrhea (P = .29), degree of dehydration (P = .40) or the covariate calf age (P = .77 for severity of diarrhea, and P = .50 for degree of dehydration) on plasma CIT level. The interactions between severity of diarrhea and age (P = .50) and between degree of dehydration and age (P = .67) were also not significant.\n\nAn ANCOVA revealed no effect of the covariate calf age on plasma CIT (P = .77), ARG (P = .14), NO (P = .30), and blood ammonia (P = .09).\n\nThe interactions between severity of diarrhea and age and between degree of dehydration and age for CIT and its related metabolites were also not significant. However, there were significant effects of severity of diarrhea on plasma CIT (P = .04), ARG (P = .04), NO (P < .001), and 39 The blood ammonia concentration with a median of 28.7 \u03bcmol/L in healthy control calves ( Table 2 ) was in agreement with the values <90 \u03bcmol/L reported previously by other investigators. 40 Veterinary assessment of calves with diarrhea is generally based on clinical examination and routine laboratory variables alone; however, To date, no studies have evaluated plasma CIT in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea, and only 1 study on ARG levels demonstrated lower lysine + ARG concentrations. 41 Therefore, the plasma CIT concentration observed in the present study is not directly comparable.\n\nHowever, our plasma CIT result is in agreement with the findings of several previous reports in humans with enteropathies 10-12,15 and sepsis, 13, 16, 17 as well as in dogs. 22, 42 As previously reported in humans, decreased plasma CIT and ARG in diarrheic calves could be because of impaired intestinal production, different metabolic processes altered in inflammatory conditions, or a combination of both. 9, 11, 13, 33, 42 Infectious diarrhea in neonatal calves results in a low to strong inflammatory response. 1, 4, 43 Approximately 80% of CIT is converted to the amino acid, ARG, in the body to support ARG and NO levels. 6, 8, 9, 44 Conversion of CIT to ARG and converting/recycling ARG to CIT and NO appear to be dependent on the severity of inflammation. 6, 7, 14 Therefore, the decreases in plasma CIT and ARG levels can especially be based on intestinal damage, dysfunction, or both mechanisms, leading to the impaired production of these amino acids. Although small bowel enteroscopy or histopathological examination was not performed in this study, certain enteropathogens, particularly C. parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus are associated with mucosal injury in calves. 1, 4 Considering all of these factors, low plasma CIT and ARG concentrations in neonatal calves with diarrhea ( Figure 1A,B) . We cannot explain the exact reasons for these results. Perhaps this result stems from the low number of calves with noninfectious diarrhea enrolled in the study.\n\nAnother factor affecting plasma CIT concentration might be renal impairment. 6 However, CIT is metabolized into ARG in the intestine instead of CIT and decreased uptake of glutamine by the enterocyte. 6 In addition, CIT production is severely reduced during SIRS and sepsis, resulting in diminished ARG de novo production and NO availability. 7, 9 For NO synthesis, inducible NO synthases (iNOS) known as inflammatory NOS, can be expressed by almost all cell types in most tissues. 47 After its induction by certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, or both, a large amount of NO is produced over a long period of time during the inflammatory process of infectious disease. [48] [49] [50] In this study, 50 of 60 diarrheic calves were evaluated as infectious. Similar to previous studies in humans 50 indicating NO formation, are well documented in patients with SIRS or sepsis, and this alteration contributes to intestinal damage and its consequences. 9 In the present study, significantly higher plasma NO concentration in diarrheic calves with SIRS can also be explained by a similar process ( Figure 4C ).\n\nAmmonia is a toxic compound to many organ systems, especially the brain. Excessive blood ammonia concentration might result in respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, mental disorders, seizures, coma, and death. Increases in blood ammonia concentration are generally considered to only be a result of liver-related disorders, but other underlying causes should be assessed as well. 20 High blood ammonia levels can develop from several different mechanisms, including (1) hepatic insufficiency, (2) reduced activity of urea cycle enzymes, (3) metabolic disorders of organic acids, and (4) portosystemic shunt. 20 In the present study, blood ammonia concentration with a median of 59.8 \u03bcmol/L in diarrheic calves was significantly higher than that in healthy calves (Table 2 ). Although these median levels remained within the reference range (<90 \u03bcmol/L) reported for cattle, 40 median blood ammonia levels in the severe diarrhea (105.7 \u03bcmol/L), severe dehydration (113.9 \u03bcmol/L), and SIRS positive (105.7 \u03bcmol/L) subgroups were above the reference limits ( Figures 2D, 3D, and 4D ). This increase in these subgroups can be considered to be hyperammonemia and might be related to the loss of liver or kidney function because of circulatory failure in the result of diarrhea, as well as the decrease of plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations which decreases the efficiency of the urea cycle. In this content, hyperammonemia has also been reported in a human case of short bowel syndrome along with decreased concentrations of arginine and citrulline 54 and in systemic infections with bacteria or virus. 55 The moderate and positive relationship of blood ammonia with SIRS status (Table 3 ) and the effects of severity of diarrhea and degree of dehydration) might be based on the factors affecting urea cycle and ammonia metabolism. 20 The results of this study are subject to some limitations. This study included a variety of mono or combined causative agents (Table 1) with NCD in calves with noninfectious diarrhea cannot be determined because only the antigens of the most common enteropathogens in feces were evaluated. Additionally, the duration of disease is a confounding factor which could cause difficulty in diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea. Lastly, the sample size of this study was small, especially in neonatal calves with noninfectious diarrhea.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study reported that neonatal calves with acute diarrhea have significantly lower plasma concentrations of CIT and ARG, as well as higher plasma NO and blood ammonia levels, and these changes were associated with SIRS status, severity of diarrhea, and degree of dehydration. Plasma CIT concentrations could be a useful marker to evaluate the presence and degree of intestinal damage and gut barrier dysfunction in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea. However, further studies are needed to determine the importance of decreased plasma CIT and ARG levels and increased levels of plasma NO and blood ammonia with regard to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in NCD."}
