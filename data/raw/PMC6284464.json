{"title": "Overproduction of IL-6 and Type-I IFN in a Lethal Case of Chikungunya Virus Infection in an Elderly Man During the 2017 Italian Outbreak", "body": "The patient was a 77-year-old male with relevant cardiac comorbidities who lived in Anzio (Lazio, Italy), in a territory within the 2017 CHIKV outbreak epicenter (http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/temi/documenti/chikungunya/bollettino_chikungunya_ULTIMO.pdf). He was hospitalized at the Santa Maria Goretti Hospital in Latina 2 days after symptoms onset and died after 10 hours the hospitalization, before virological diagnosis was made at the Regional Reference Laboratory for arboviral infections at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u201cLazzaro Spallanzani\u201d (INMI) in Rome. The analysis was part of a larger study entitled \u201cStudy of Factors (Microbial, Viral, Host-Derived and Therapeutic) Involved in the Clinical Evolution of Emerging and Severe Viral Diseases,\u201d approved by the INMI Ethical Committee, issue No. 14/2015. Written informed consent was not required as the activities described were performed within the framework of the Regional Surveillance plan.\n\nMolecular diagnosis was based on real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; RealStar Chikungunya RT-PCR Kit 2.0, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). Serological diagnostic investigation was based on indirect immunofluorescence assay (Arbovirus Fever Mosaic 2 IgG and IgM, Euroimmun, Germany). Virus isolation from patient\u2019s serum was performed on BHK-21 cells. The near-complete genome sequence was obtained by Sanger sequencing: an 11 467-nt-long sequence was built based on 23 overlapping amplicons, as previously described [6]. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built with the near-complete genome sequence of the isolate, based on the General Timer Reversible substitution model.\n\nInterferon (IFN) response (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) and inflammatory cytokine release (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]\u2013\u03b1) were evaluated in this fatal case. Circulating mediators were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; VeriKine-HS Human IFN-\u03b1, VeriKine-HS Human IFN-\u03b2, and VeriKine Human IFN-\u03b3, purchased from PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, New Jersey; Human IL-6 DuoSet ELISA and Human TNF-alpha DuoSet ELISA, purchased from R&D System, Minneapolis, Minnesota), and the levels were compared with those detected in plasma samples obtained during the very early stages of the infection (<3 days after onset of symptoms) in 4 nonfatal cases belonging to the same outbreak (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nIn September 2017, a 77-year-old male, living in Anzio, was admitted to the Emergency Room of Santa Maria Goretti Hospital in Latina (Lazio region, Italy). The patient had a history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), chronic obliterative arteriopathy of the inferior limbs, and bilateral carotid atherosclerosis; in July, he underwent contrast cardiac ventriculography for acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe patient had a high fever (up to 39\u00b0C) and widespread arthromyalgia during the previous 2 days and was admitted to the hospital for acute neurological syndrome that had started in the previous 3 hours. He was conscious and presented deviation of the angle of the mouth toward the right side, hypostenia of the left inferior limb, and dysartria. The vital signs were the following: artery pressure (PA) of 120/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 87 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal rhythm, body temperature (BT) of 37.5\u00b0, respiratory rate of 18 breath per minute, normal oxygen saturation (99%) in ambient air (AA), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15.\n\nThirty minutes after hospital admission, the neurological deficit disappeared and neurological examination was negative. The BT was 38.5\u00b0. Chest x-ray showed an accentuation of bronchovascular marking, indicating an interstitial pulmonary edema and ischemic chronic vascular disease, without acute event at computed tomography. The electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block and widespread abnormalities of ventricular repolarization. The echocardiogram showed a dilated left cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction (35%), with mild aortic and mild to moderate mitralic regurgition and normal right heart function and pericardium.\n\nThe blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 6.290 \u00d7 103 uL (neutrophils 90%, lymphocytes 2.1%); red blood cell count of 3.666 \u00d7 106 uL; hemoglobin of 11.2 gr; and a platelet count of 179.000 \u00d7 103 uL. Moreover, he had normal liver function and coagulation tests, no electrolyte alterations, creatinine of 1.10 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein of 1.37 mg/dL (normal range, 0\u20130.5). Blood cultures were negative. Markers of myocardial injury were above the normal range, in particular, high-sensitive Troponin (hs-cTn) of 0.352 pg/mL (normal range, 0\u20130.34 pg/mL) and Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) of 8.40 ng/mL (normal < 7.2 ng/mL). The patient was transferred to a subintensive care unit in stable condition with a fever (39.8\u00b0C) and was started on a therapy with furosemide, clodiprogel, acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, paracetamol, ceftriaxone, and azytromicin. After 9-hour admission in subintensive unit care, the patient died of acute cardiac arrest.\n\nDue to the concomitant presence of CHIKV cases in the patient\u2019s family, a blood sample was sent to the INMI for virological investigation. CHIKV infection was diagnosed on the basis of positive RT-PCR test, in the absence of CHIKV-specific IgM/IgG antibodies (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nThe virus was isolated (CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI2-2017), and its near-complete-length genome sequence was obtained (GenBank accession number MH507158). The sequence clustered with recent isolates belonging to the Indian Ocean sublineage of ECSA (Figure 1) in the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and showed only 1 nucleotide difference (synonymous substitution at position nt 3126 of nonstructural polyprotein), as compared with the outbreak prototype strain (CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017).\n\nSerum levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 observed in the deceased patient are shown in Figure 2, in comparison with the pattern observed in a small group of nonfatal cases sampled in the early phases of the infection. CHIKV RNA levels detected in the corresponding patients are also shown. As can be seen, the IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-6 levels were extremely high in this fatal case as compared with nonfatal cases, whereas IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were in the same range. Although the small number of cases did not allow adequate statistical power, the levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-6 seemed not to be directly correlated to the levels of CHIKV RNA, as expressed by Ct values (Figure 2).\n\nCF is generally considered a self-limiting and nonfatal disease, although the accompanying symptom of severe incapacitating arthralgia is often persistent and can result in long-lasting disability [5]. This belief was debunked by the CHIKV outbreak on the Reunion Island in 2005\u20132006 when there were 266 000 cases and 254 deaths [7, 8]. CHIKV has been strongly suspected to have neurologic, hepatic, and myocardial tropism, leading to dramatic complications and severe clinical presentations with a high mortality rate (48%) [7, 9\u201311]. In fact, severe clinical forms are associated with the presence of several underlying medical conditions in about 90% of the cases, especially in elderly patients, and preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular diseases and hypertension have been recognized as risk factors of developing severe illness [7, 9].\n\nHere, we report the unique lethal case among all CF cases during the 2017 outbreak in Italy, involving an elderly patient with underlying cardiac disease. Surprisingly, the analysis of inflammatory cytokines revealed a remarkable and strong increase of circulating type-I IFN, as well as of the IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine. Generally, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response contributes to the pathogenesis of several viral infections, and severe inflammation can result in systemic cytokine storm, which may lead to more serious pathological changes and multi-organ dysfunctions [12, 13].\n\nInflammatory cytokines and chemokines are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of CHIKV and are associated with severe clinical presentations as well as with development of abrupt and persistent arthralgia. Ng et al. previously reported a significant increase of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels in severe compared with nonsevere CF cases, which can raise oxygen demand and have negative inotropic effects on the human myocardium, suggesting their possible role as biomarkers to distinguish between mild and more severe forms of CF [14].\n\nIFNs are antiviral cytokines produced during viral infections and have a well-known role in restricting virus replication and promoting virus clearance. In particular, IFN-\u03b1 is produced during CHIKV infection and has been shown to strongly inhibit CHIKV in vitro [14]. Therefore, the overproduction of type-I IFN is rather surprising in the lethal CHIKV infection here described. Elevated type-I IFN levels are known to be associated with clinical severity and poor therapy response in chronic diseases of viral (ie, hepatitis C virus and HIV) and autoimmune (ie, systemic lupus erythematosus) etiology [15, 16], whereas overproduction in acute viral infections is rarely reported in humans. One report showed that in patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection, the concentration of IFN-\u03b1 and other cytokines, including IL-6, is correlated with the severity of the disease, suggesting that high levels of IFN-\u03b1 could not control SFTSV in humans but may be involved in the cytokine storm and in the virus pathogenesis [17]. Furthermore, a few studies have shown that abnormally elevated type-I IFN levels can cause morbidity and mortality, as opposed to protection, during influenza virus infection in animal models [18].\n\nPrevious evidence suggests that patients with coronary artery disease show increased Th1 cytokine levels in the general population [19, 20]. Our findings are consistent with a possible role of type-I IFN in the CHIKV-driven cytokine storm that, in turn, may have contributed to enhanced tissue injury and unfavorable prognosis in a patient with predisposing factors. However, due to the extremely small number of CHIKV-infected patients and to the lack of comparison with uninfected patients with cardiac disease, from the present study it is not possible to establish whether CHIKV or the underlying cardiac dysfunction was the actual cause of the altered cytokine profile; it is also likely that infection, underlying morbidity, and elderly condition all contributed.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between clinical severity and host factors like older age, comorbidities, genetic susceptibility, and inflammatory and immune responses in CHIKV infection and to adequately address the role of CHIKV-driven cytokine dysregulation in worsening cardiovascular disease, a wider observation, possibly designed as a case\u2013control study, would be necessary.\n\nEnhanced attention to unusually severe clinical presentation of CHIKV infection is endorsed by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9033.pdf?ua=1), and public health managers should remain cautious about the possible impact, from both human and economic standpoints, when facing a possible spread of the disease, as an increase in patient mortality could remain a plausible scenario."}
