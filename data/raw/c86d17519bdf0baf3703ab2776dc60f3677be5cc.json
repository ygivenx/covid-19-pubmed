The respective infections cannot be dif-*Author to whom correspondence should be addressed 0378-1135/89/$03.50 fbrentiated clinically (Wood, 1980) and for an etiological diagnosis it is necessary to isolate and characterize the corresponding virus.\n\nTGEV has successfully been adapted to various cell culture systems and therefore has been fully characterized as a typical coronavirus (Witte and Easterday, 1967; Witte, 1971; Pocock and Garwes, 1975; Garwes, 1982; Jim6nez et al., 1986; Komaniwa et al., 1986) . Due to electron microscopic evidence, PEDV has been deemed to be a coronavirus replicating in the cytoplasma of enterocytes of the small intestine of pigs (Pensaert, 1981; Witte et al., 1981 ) . Propagation of PEDV in Vero cells has recently become possible (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) .\n\nThe present report describes a method for the quantitation of PEDV using a novel, simplified plaque test for titration and gives an account of the physicochemical characteristics of PEDV.\n\nThe continuous Vero cell line (ATCC) was used for adaptation and propagation of PEDV. Cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) (Amimed, Basle, Switzerland), buffered with 30 mM Hepes, supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FC S ) (North American Biologicals, Miami, FL, U.S.A.), 0.3% (w/v) tryptose phosphate broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, U.S.A.) and antibiotics (100 IE penicillin and 100/~g streptomycin ml-1 ). Medium for virus replication (VM) consisted of EMEM with the same supplements plus 10/~g ml-' trypsin (1:250, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, U.S.A. ), but containing no FCS.\n\nThe German isolate V215/78 of PEDV (supplied by Prof. K.H. Witte, Arnsberg, F.R.G. ) was adapted to Vero cell culture as described previously (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) and serially passaged in our laboratory. For the present experiments, a stock of PEDV was used at its 26th Vero cell passage [ 10 ''' plaque-forming units (PFU) m1-1 ].\n\nPseudorabies virus (PRV), strain ER 217 (supplied by the Eidgen6ssisches Vakzine-Institut, Basle, Switzerland) served as control in nucleic acid determination studies and was used at its second Vero cell passage.\n\nPEDV-containing cell culture fluid from the preceeding passage was clarified by low-speed centrifugation (1000 \u00d7g for 10 min) and diluted 1:10 in VM.\n\nConfluent monolayers of Vero cells in 150-cm 2 cell culture flasks (Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY, U.S.A.) were washed twice with VM to remove residual growth medium. The cells were then inoculated with 5 ml of a diluted viral inoculum. The virus was adsorbed for 2 h at room temperature in the dark by slowly moving the flasks on a orbital shaker (0.5 r.p.m. ) After adsorption, 35 ml of VM was added to each flask without removing the primary inoculum. The infected cells were subsequently incubated at 37\u00b0C until the cell layer showed a 100% cytopathic effect. Cell cultures serving as controls were treated in the same way, but were mock inoculated with 5 ml VM instead of the viral inoculum.\n\nSamples of 50/~1 each were placed on parlodion-coated grids for 5 min. After adsorption, grids were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.6, and subsequently examined using a Philips EM201 electron microscope.\n\nPEDV-containing cells were identified by fluorescent antibody staining. Infected monolayers, grown in slide flasks (Nunc, Denmark) were fixed 22 h after inoculation with 100% ethanol for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Then they were incubated with an anti-PEDV-FITC conjugate (provided by Prof. M. Pensaert, Ghent, Belgium) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0 C. After three washings in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.15 M NaC1, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) the prepared samples were embedded in buffered glycerol and examined with a Leitz Ortholux ultraviolet microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, F.R.G.).\n\nCells for virus titration were grown in 24-well tissue culture plates (Multiwell Falcon 3047, Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, CA, U.S.A.). Fortyeight hours after seeding, confluent monolayers were washed twice with VM prior to inoculation. Serial 10-fold dilutions of PEDV were made in VM and 0.2-ml portions added in duplicate wells. Adsorption was carried out as described for flasks, but the orbital shaker speed was increased to 1 r.p.m. After adsorption, the viral inocula were removed by aspiration and the cell cultures washed once with VM. Then 0.5 ml VM was added to each well and cultures were incubated in a humid chamber at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Another 0.5 ml of VM, supplemented with 4% FCS for blocking the action of trypsin, was added to each well and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0 C. Cells were fixed by adding 1 ml of 4% formaldehyde to each well without removing VM. After 1 h, the supernatants were discharged and the monolayers stained for 10 min with 0.5% (w/v) cristal violet in deionized water. After washing away the excess stain, plates were air dried and plaques counted microscopically. For the determination of PEDV infectivity titers, wells containing 20-200 plaques were counted and titers expressed as PFU ml-1\n\nFor the determination of PEDV growth characteristics, cells were seeded in 16 25-cm 2 flasks and inoculated as described for serial propagation, except that the inoculum consisted of undiluted stock virus. After adsorption, monolayers were washed twice with VM to remove residual unadsorbed virus, then 5 ml of VM were added to the flasks and the cell cultures incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 31, 36 or 48 h. At the end of the incubation periods, VM was removed, clarified by low-speed centrifugation and stored at 4 \u00b0 C for titration of extracellular PEDV. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 ml fresh VM. Cells still adhering to the bottom of the flask were washed twice with VM, scraped off with a rubber policeman, pooled with the resuspended cells, then frozen and thawed three times to release intracellular virus particles. The ensuing suspension was clarified by centrifugation and titrated using the plaque test (see above ).\n\nThe type of viral nucleic acid was determined by adding 50 or 200 zg ml-1 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IUDR) to the VM. Veto cells were infected with 10 000 PFU ml i PEDV or 10 000 TCID~o ml-1 PRV, respectively. After virus adsorption, cultures were washed once and VM containing no IUDR, 50 zg ml-IUDR or 200 llg ml-1 IUDR was added to the cultures. Uninfected cultures were treated in the same manner with or without IUDR. The cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h after infection. Infectivity titers of each sample were determined after cells had been subjected to freezing and thawing three times, and subsequently centrifuged at low speed.\n\nA 2-ml sample of stock virus suspension was diluted in 20 ml of VM and filtered through a series of membrane filters of 450-, 200-, 100-and 50-nm pore diameter (Schleicher und Schiill AG, Feldbach, Switzerland), after which the filtrates were titrated.\n\nThe sensitivity of PEDV to diethyl ether and chloroform was tested according to the procedure described elsewhere (Akashi et al., 1980) . Briefly, the virus was mixed with the lipid solvent, vigorously shaken and left for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 10 000 Xg min and the resulting aqueous phases immediately titrated.\n\nThe thermostability of PEDV was examined by two different methods. First, 1-ml samples of undiluted virus were incubated in a water bath at 50 + 0.1\u00b0C for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 or 180 min (all samples were kept on ice before and after heating) and subsequently titrated. An untreated virus control was stored at 4 \u00b0C during the whole experiment.\n\nSecond, 1-ml portions of undiluted virus were incubated for 30 min at 50, 60, 70 or 80 \u00b0 C and further treated in the same way as described above.\n\nA 0.5-ml sample of stock virus suspension was mixed with the same volume of VM, distilled water, or 2 M MgC12 solution (prepared in distilled water). The mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 50 \u00b0 C for 30 min. After heating, mixtures were recooled to 4 \u00b0 C and assayed for infectivity.\n\nStock virus was diluted 1:10 in VM. Volumes of 10 ml of diluted virus were adjusted to pH, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 9, 10 or 11 by the addition of 2 N HC1 or 2 N NaOH. After pH change, 5 ml of each sample were kept at 4 \u00b0 C for 6 h. The residual 5 ml were incubated in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. After this time, samples were recooled to 4 o C and the pH of each readjusted to 7.2-7.4. Thereafter, each sample was assayed for residual PEDV infectivity.\n\nPEDV at its 50th passage in Vero cells was tested for resistance to multiple freezing and thawing cycles. A 1-ml sample of undiluted virus was first frozen to -70 \u00b0 C then warmed to 37 \u00b0 C 10 times, whereas a virus control was stored at 4 \u00b0 C during the experiment. Resistance to ultrasonication was tested by sonicating 10 ml of PEDV diluted 1:10 in VM for 3 min with a Branson sonifier B130 using a power output of 20 W at a frequency of 20 kHz. Overheating was avoided by placing the virus-containing tube in an ice bath and interrupting sonication every minute for 3 min.\n\nCrude PEDV from infective culture fluid, from which cell debris had been removed by low-speed centrifugation at 4000 Xg for 20 min at 4 ~ C, was pelleted by centrifugation at 85 000 Xg for 2 h at 4 \u00b0 C, the resulting pellet resuspended in 1% of the original volume of TNE buffer (0.05 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCI, I mM EDTA) and layered on top of a 10-50% (w/w) continuous sucrose gradient prepared in TNE buffer. The gradient was then centrifuged for 16 h at 85 000\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C. The virus-containing fractions (detected by electron microscopy) were pooled and sucrose density was measured with a density meter (DMA 35, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria).\n\nTwo sera from pigs known to contain antibodies to PEDV and one to TGEV were diluted in VM. Each dilution was mixed with 10 000 PFU ml 1 of PEDV and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0 C. The mixtures were then inoculated onto confluent Vero cell cultures. The plaque inhibition test was further carried out in the same way as described for the plaque test for PEDV infectivity titration, and the antibody titer finally expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution leading to at least an 80% reduction of the plaque number.\n\nInfected Vero cell cultures showed PEDV-characteristic alterations, as described earlier (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . Briefly, signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) (characterized by single cells losing their individual demarcation and forming syncytia by fusing with other cells at their periphery) were first seen 9 h aider adsorption. Numerous nuclei accumulated in the center of these plaquelike lesions. Within 18 h after adsorption, all the cells were completely fused. Later, nuclei became pycnotic and the whole monolayer thereafter detached from the bottom of the flask. Mock-inoculated control cultures showed no CPE.\n\nElectron microscopic examination of the supernatants of infected cells regularly showed numerous typical coronavirus particles.\n\nWhen cell cultures were fixed 48 h after infection, all plaques had diameters of 0.3-0.5 mm and had to be counted microscopically.\n\nThe number of plaques in corresponding duplicate wells differed by < 30% if tested in the same assay. When the same PEDV sample was titrated in different assays, results never differed by > 0.3 loglo (data not shown). Cell culture-grown PEDV always reached titers between 10 s:~ and 10 s'~' PFU ml-~. For most of the characterization experiments described in this paper, the same PEDV stock suspension (Passage 26 on Vero cells) with a titer of 10 '~:' PFU ml-~ was used.\n\nThe replication kinetics are illustrated in Fig. 1 The replication of PEDV was not affected significantly by the presence of 50 or 200 zg IUDR ml-1 VM (Table 1 ) . On the contrary, the multiplication of PRV, a DNA-containing herpesvirus, was markedly inhibited, depending on the concentration of IUDR in the VM.\n\nPEDV passed membrane filters with a pore diameter of 450 and 200 nm, but was completely retained by one with 100-and 50-nm pore size.\n\nWhen treated with ether or chloroform for 5 rain, PEDV was completely inactivated in both experiments. PEDV totally lost its infectivity when heated > 60\u00b0C for 30 min, whereas its titer remained relatively stable when exposed to 50\u00b0C for the same time (reduction of 0.4 loglo PFU ml-1, compared with control).\n\nThermoinactivation kinetics at 50\u00b0C are demonstrated in Fig. 2 . Viral infectivity decreased steadily for 1.1 loglo h-1 and was reduced to 0.05% of the original value after 3 h of heating, again indicating that PEDV is moderately stable at 50 \u00b0 C.\n\nWhen PEDV was heated to 50\u00b0C for 30 min after having been diluted in distilled water or fresh VM, respectively, no significant difference in heat inactivation rates was observed. However, when diluted in MgCl,~ solution at a final concentration of 1 M, an ~ 100-fold virus inactivation took place.\n\nPEDV was incubated at various pH values for 6 h at 37 or 4\u00b0C. The virus remained relatively stable at 4 \u00b0 C over a pH range from 5 to 9, whereas at 37 \u00b0 C it retained its infectivity only between pH 6 and 8, and was completely inactivated <pH 4 and >pH 9 (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe infectivity of PEDV was not significantly reduced either by freezing and thawing 10 times or by ultrasonication for 3 min.\n\nOn three independent centrifugations in a linear sucrose density gradient, PEDV samples pelleted previously by high-speed centrifugation had densities of 1.176, 1.182 and 1.181 in the pooled virus-containing fractions.\n\nPEDV was neutralized in the plaque inhibition test by sera known to contain antibodies to PEDV. The two sera tested had neutralizing titers of 119 and 315. The TGEV antibody-containing serum did not neutralize PEDV even in its lowest dilution (1:4), although it had a high neutralizing effect when tested in the homologous system.\n\nThe multiplication of PEDV in Vero cells with the aid of trypsin, leading to characteristic cytopathic changes, is a useful method for producing high amounts of virus and also represents a sensitive and effective assay system for PEDV infectivity. During subsequent passage in Vero cells, PEDV was readily adaptable to this cell line and could be serially passaged > 50 times without changing its replication pattern.\n\nPEDV does not produce infective virus particles in Vero cells as long as the action of trypsin is inhibited by FCS. Because the primarily produced virions in the plaque-like syncytia are not activated, they are not able to induce secondary plaques. The plaque test described can therefore be used for the quantification of infective virus particles. Additionally, it could be shown that each infectious virus particle adsorbed to the cell layer produces one plaque (data not shown). Reproducibility and accuracy of the plaque test were good. The infectivity titers were in the same range as described for other coronaviruses (Robb and Bond, 1979b; Schmidt et al., 1979; Vautherot, 1981; Hirano et al., 1985) .\n\nResults of IUDR, filtration and inactivation experiments with ether and chloroform confirm that we are dealing with an enveloped RNA virus. As with other coronaviruses, PEDV is rapidly and totally inactivated by heating for 30 min to 60\u00b0C (Dea et al., 1980a,b; Daniel and Talbot, 1987) . PEDV showed a certain resistance to acid pH values, although optimal pH values for virus stability were higher than for other enteropathogenic coronaviruses (Pocock and Garwes, 1975; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) .\n\nIn contrast to most of the other known coronaviruses but in agreement with the findings concerning the bluecomb coronavirus of turkeys (Deshmukh and Pomeroy, 1974 ) , PEDV thermostability decreased in the presence of i M MgC12 instead of increasing. Surprisingly, PEDV was not inactivated significantly by the addition of distilled water, therefore the virus may be resistant to hypotonic conditions. PEDV infectivity was not significantly reduced either by ultrasonication or by multiple freezing and thawing. This may be due to the disintegration of virus clumps, thus compensating for the number of virus particles which were inactivated during mechanical treatment.\n\nIsopycnic ultracentrifugation in a linear sucrose gradient resulted in only one distinct virus band, which contained numerous morphologically intact virus particles when examined by electron microscopy. This band had a low buoyant density of 1.18 in sucrose, a value that is typical for coronaviruses (Tyrrell et al., 1978; Siddell et al., 1983) . Ultracentrifugation under the described conditions is also a useful method to purify PEDV from host cell fragments.\n\nPEDV was neutralized by both PEDV antibody-containing pig sera when assayed with the plaque inhibition test. TGEV antibody-containing serum, on the other hand, had no neutralizing effect. The plaque inhibition test therefore is well adapted as a neutralization test.\n\nThe results of the present biological and physicochemical studies show that PEDV is probably a member of the coronavirus family (Mebus et al., 1973; Hierholzer, 1976; Robb and Bond, 1979a; Caul and Egglestone, 1982; Wege et al., 1982) .\n\nBecause PEDV is not serologically related to other members of the family coronaviridae (Pedersen et al., 1978; Pensaert et al., 1981) , characterization of structural proteins and the genome of PEDV is needed for a definite classification of this virus."}
