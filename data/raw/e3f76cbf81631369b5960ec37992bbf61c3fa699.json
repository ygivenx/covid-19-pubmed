{"title": "Title -Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -Surveillance and Testing", "body": "Retrospective data were collected for returning travellers from the Middle East fitting the PHE MERS case definition. Respiratory samples were tested for respiratory viruses and MERS-CoV using an in-house RT-PCR assay.\n\nFour hundred and twenty-six (426) samples from 264 patients were tested for MERS Co-V and The second global case of MERS was identified in a Qatari national who had previously travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2012. He was transferred from Qatar to a hospital in England where he clinically deteriorated, was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) however, unfortunately had a fatal outcome (6) . A second case in the UK was confirmed in February 2013, in a return traveler from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who was admitted with severe acute respiratory symptoms. This patient required ECMO treatment however also unfortunately died. This case resulted in onward transmission to two further cases, of which one subsequently died (7) . In August 2018, a fifth case of MERS was diagnosed in a return traveler from the Middle East. The patient was initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds and then transferred to specialist infectious disease unit in Liverpool. The patient had a positive outcome and there was no onward transmission of MERS-CoV to the close contacts (8) As of the end of November 2019, MERS Co-V has infected 2,494 people with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37.1% (9, 10) and a notably higher CFR in ITU settings (11) . Nosocomial outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia and South Korea demonstrating the need for stringent infection control polices (12) . In view of the high risk of imported cases, Public Health England (PHE) commissioned regional centers to perform MERS-CoV testing for possible MERS cases arriving in England. PHE Manchester laboratory is one of two centers that currently perform Acute respiratory illness (ARI) and contact with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in the 14 days prior to onset.\n\nThose meeting the PHE case definition were discussed with the Regional Infectious Diseases team and/or the Consultant Virologist and then tested for infection (3) (Figure 1 ).\n\nThe majority of cases were initially discussed with the RIDU team and then transferred to North Manchester General Hospital for further assessment in the negative pressure rooms with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Some local hospital cases were discussed directly with the PHE Manchester Consultant virologist. In these scenarios, the risk assessment \n\nFour hundred and twenty-six samples (426) were received for two hundred and sixty-four England with the majority sent from the regional infectious disease unit and from university teaching hospitals (Supplementary figures 1 & 2) .\n\nPatient's age ranged from 18 weeks to 89 years old. Patient demographic characteristics are shown in Table 2 . \n\nThe travel history as noted on the LIMS system and request forms showed the majority of \n\nThe dates for Hajj, Umrah and Ramadan fluctuates every year as the Islamic calendar is lunar based thus the dates usually change by 10 days annually ( Figure 7) .\n\nWhen analysing the sample type, of note is that the highest positivity is of sputum samples, followed by BAL. However, the lowest positivity of samples is of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) however the number of samples was low for this to be considered significant as only one NPA sample was received. \n\nIt is likely there will be more testing after these periods especially as travellers might also be returning via the Middle East after the summer vacation months. Similarly the peak testing is September and June in 2018 correlating post Hajj (19th-24th August 2018) and Ramadan (16th May to 14th June 2018). Combined with the UK school vacation periods this resulted in more returning travellers causing a higher testing rate after these periods.\n\nAs the clinical spectrum of MERS is broad, there is the possibility that some cases may be missed in asymptomatic patients, who do not fit the PHE criteria and those patients who do not attend hospital. However, the risk of transmission from asymptomatic cases is considered lower than symptomatic cases thus there is less of a need to focus on these patients from a public health perspective (20) . Furthermore, attempting to screen every traveller returning from a MERS-CoV is a high consequence infectious disease which requires the highest vigilance to ensure preventing it's spread and lethal outcomes.\n\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\nEthical approval was not obtained as this study is an analysis of laboratory surveillance data.\n\nHowever, patient identifiable information was anonymized to ensure patient confidentiality during the data analysis.
