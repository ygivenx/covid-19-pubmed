{"title": "Analysis of synonymous codon usage in Newcastle disease virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene and fusion protein (F) gene", "body": "It is well known that synonymous codons are not used randomly. Some codons are used more frequently than others [5, 14, 17] . Compositional constraints and natural selection are thought to be the two main factors accounting for codon usage variation among genes in different organisms [11, 13, 20] . The different patterns of codon usage in mammals may arise from compositional constraints of the genomes [2] . In contrast to some unicellular organisms, low expressed genes displayed a more uniform pattern of codon usage, whereas high expressed genes have a strong selective preference for codons with a high concentration of the corresponding acceptor tRNA molecule [3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 20] . Recently, codon usage was also found to be related to gene function [15] , protein secondary structure [19] , replicational and translational selection [21] , dinucleotide bias [25] , gene length [10] , tRNA abundance [1] , codon-anticodon [5] interaction [18] , and tissue or organ specificity. In addition, mutational pressure and translational selection were thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation among genes in some RNA virus. Studies the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution, particularly the interplay between viruses and the immune response [19] . In contrast to many virus such influenza virus, where codon usage bias and nucleotide composition have been studied in great detail, the factors shaping synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composition in NDV have been studied only to a limited extent.\n\nNewcastle disease virus, also known as avian paramyxovirus serotype-1 (APMV-1), a member of the genus Avulavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family [12] , is a negative-sense, single stranded, non-segmented, enveloped RNA virus [9] . The NDV genome is composed of six genes and encodes their corresponding six structural proteins: [16] . Fusion protein has been reported to media the fusion of viral envelope with cell membrane and considered as the major determinant of virulence [22] . Although the functions of the HN and F protein in NDV infection have been well studied, their roles in NDV evolution is not known at present. Recently, recombination was found to play a more important role than positive selection in the formation of genetic diversity in NDV genome [23] . Previous studies of NDV HN and F genes have mainly been limited to phylogenic analysis. However, few synonymous codon usage analyses have been applied. In order to better understand the characteristics of the NDV HN and F genes and to reveal more information about the NDV virus, we have analyzed the bias of codon usage. In this report, we sought to address the codon usage in NDV HN and F genes. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were performed to determine the role of different factors in shaping the codon usage biases in the various NDV viruses. All statistical analyses, as well as cluster analysis, were carried out using the statistical analysis software SPSS Version 15.0.\n\nRelative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values are largely independent of amino acid composition and are particularly useful in comparing codon usage between genes, or sets of genes that differ in their size and amino acid composition. RSCU values of different codon in each HN and F ORFs were calculated to investigate the extent of codon bias in NDV HN and F genes. The details of each ORF and the overall RSCU values of 59 codons in 69 NDV HN and F genes are, respectively, represented in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Electronic supplementary material. In HN gene, the preferentially used codons were A-ended (6 ones), U-ended (7 ones) codons, C-ended (4 ones) codons, and G-ended (4 ones) codons. In F gene, the preferentially used codons were A-ended (7 ones), U-ended (10 ones) codons, C-ended (2 ones) codons, and G-ended (2 ones) codons. The GC index was used to calculate the overall GC content in the ORF, while the index GC3s was used to calculate the fraction of GC nucleotides at the synonymous third codon position . This is consistent with previous observations that NDV viruses are GC-moderate genomes [23] , and so it is expected that the third-ended codons are not preferentially used. In order to investigate whether these 69 coding sequences of NDV HN and F genes display similar compositional features, ENC (effective number of codons) values were calculated (Tables 1, 2 . Based on this finding, together with published data on codon usage bias among some RNA viruses [6, 21, 25] , we conclude that the codon usage bias in both NDV HN and F genes are less.\n\nTo investigate synonymous codon usage variation among NDV HN and F genes, correspondence analysis (COA) was implemented for 69 NDV HN and F ORFs selected for this study. Multivariate statistical analysis can be used to explore the relationships between variables and samples. The major trend in codon usage variation among ORFs can be investigated using COA. In order to minimize the effects of amino acid composition on codon usage, each ORF is represented as a 59-dimensional vector; each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon (excluding AUG, UGG, and stop codons). Major trends within this dataset can be determined using measures of relative inertia and genes ordered according to their positions along the axis of major inertia. Figure 1 depicts the position of each ORF on the plane defined by the first, second and third principal axes generated by COA on RSCU values of ORFs. As for HN gene, the first principal axis accounts for 38.25 % of the total variation. The next three axes account for 9.99, 8.58, and 6.36 % of the variation, respectively. In F gene, the first principal axis accounts for 27.1 % of the total variation, and the next three axes account for 15.4, 14.12, and 8.63 % of the variation. This observation indicates that although the first major axis explains a substantial amount of variation in trends in codon usage of HN and F genes, the second major axis also has an appreciable impact on total variation in synonymous codon usage. If not specifically mentioned, the values of the first two axes of this COA were used for correlation and regression analysis hereafter.\n\nIn addition, mutational pressure and translational selection were thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation among genes in some RNA virus [11] . The plot of ENC and GC3s is an effective way to explore codon usage variation among genes [24] . In order to further find whether codon usage variation among HN and F genes are determined by mutational bias, ENC values of each HN and F gene were plotted against its corresponding GC3s. Genes, whose codon choice is constrained only by a G?C mutational bias, will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values. All of the spots lie below the expected curve as shown in Fig. 2 . In addition, a significantly positive correlation between GC3s and ENC values was observed. The results indicated that the codon usage bias in these HN and F genes are greatly influenced by the G?C mutation bias.\n\nFurthermore, the GC index was used to calculate the overall GC content in the ORF, while the index GC3s was used to calculate the fraction of GC nucleotides at the synonymous third codon position (excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons). We analyzed the correlation Fig. 1 A plot of value of the first, second and third axis of each ORF in COA. As for HN gene, the first axis accounts for 38.25 % of all variation among ORFs, the second axis accounts for 9.99 % and third axis accounts for 8.58 % of total variation. In F gene, the first principal axis accounts for 27.1 % of the total variation, and the next two axes account for 15.4, 14.12 % of the variation between the first or second axis values in COA and GC3s values of each gene. The first axis value in COA of each selected gene, which contains most of the variation in synonymous codon usage bias between these HN and F genes, is not correlated with the GC composition in third codon position. The second axis in the COA of each gene is also not correlated with GC3s. This analysis indicated that most of the codon usage bias among different ORFs is not related to the nucleotide composition. Therefore, the compositional constraint is not the main determinant of the variation in synonymous codon usage among different HN and F ORFs. At the amino acid level, the general average hydrophobicity score (GRAVY) and the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Aromo) in the putative gene product were also analyzed. As showed in Fig. 2 , all of the actual ENC values are significantly lower than the expected ones, which indicated mutational bias is the main factor determining codon usage in HN gene. In order to test whether selection pressure contributes to the codon usage variation among HN and F gene, we performed a correlation analysis to evaluate whether GRAVY and Aromaticity values were related to first two axes of COA. Our results showed that only Aromaticity was correlated with axis 1 in F gene (Table 1) . However, GRAVY was correlated with both axis 1 and axis 2, and Aromaticity was correlated with axis 2 in HN gene ( Table 2 ), indicating that the degree of hydrophobicity and the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp) were also associated with the codon usage variation in HN gene.\n\nIn our report, the synonymous codon usage biases in NDV HN and F genes were analyzed, and we found that both NDV HN and F genes had low codon usage bias. Mutational pressure rather selection pressure is the main factor determining the codon usage biases. In addition, aromaticity and hydrophobicity could be partially accounting for the codon usage variation. "}
