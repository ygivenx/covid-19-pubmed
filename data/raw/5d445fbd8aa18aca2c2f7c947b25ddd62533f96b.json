{"title": "", "body": "procured from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC-VR-26). Human 25 rotavirus (Wa strain) and MA-104 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Gagandeep 26\n\nKang. Rotavirus stock preparation and infection of Caco-2 cells (MOI of 0.5 27 pfu/cell) was performed as described previously except that serum free medium 28 was used at all stages (1). For determination of viral titers, infected culture 29 supernatants were activated by trypsin as described above, added on MA-104 30 cells were determined and continued incubation for one hour at 37\u00b0 C. Virus 31 inoculum was removed and overlay medium (MEM with 0.8% tracaganth and 0.5 32 \u00b5g/ml trypsin) was added. 3 days post-infection, overlay medium was removed 33 and cells were fixed and stained as per the protocol followed for DENV. 34\n\nFor RSV stock preparation, HEp-2 cells (ATCC) were infected with an MOI 35 of 0.1 pfu/cell for one hour in MEM containing 2% FBS. Cells were washed once 36 with PBS, cultured in MEM-2% FBS and observed everyday for cytopathic effect 37 and syncytial formation (3-4 days). Cells were scraped in 3-4 ml of culture 38 medium and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Cell pellet was 39 resuspended in 1 ml of MEM-2%FBS and passed through a 26G syringe 40 attached to a one ml needle 10 times and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 41 4\u00b0C. Multiple aliquots of the supernatant were prepared and stored at -80\u00b0C as 42 stock virus. RSV titers were estimated by plaque assays on HEp-2 cells by 43 following the same procedure as for DENV. Cells were washed with PBS twice and permeabilized using IMF buffer (2) 53 overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Cells were stained with mouse anti-RSV antibody (AbD 54 Serotec) diluted in IMF buffer for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C followed by donkey-anti-mouse 55 antibody conjugated with alexaflour-488 (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. 56\n\nAppropriate unstained and secondary only controls were also processed in 57 parallel. Cells were washed and acquired in BD FACS Canto-II and data was 58 "}
