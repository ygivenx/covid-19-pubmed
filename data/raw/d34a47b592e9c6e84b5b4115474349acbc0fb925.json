{"title": "Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China", "body": "Here, we consider the development of epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV (see e.g., [1] [2] [3] ). Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the number of victims V of this virus only in this area. The first estimations of V exponential growth, typical for the initial stages of every epidemic (see e.g., [4] ) have been done in [3] . For long time predictions, more complicated mathematical models are necessary. For example, a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was used in [2] . Nevertheless, the complicated models need more efforts for unknown parameters identification. This procedure may be especially difficult, if reliable data are limited.\n\nIn this study, we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] To the parameter identification, we will use the exact solution of the SIR set of linear equations and statistical approach developed in [4] . These methods were applied for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time.\n\nWe shall analyze the daily data for the number of confirmed cases in mainland China, which origins from China National Health Commission [1]. We show in the table Table 1 the corresponding time moments t j from 0 to 24 and the number of victims V j (confirmed cumulative cases of coronavirus 2019-nCoV infection), which were used for calculations. Table 1 shows that the precise time of the epidemic beginning 0 t is unknown. Therefore, the optimization procedures have to determine the optimal value of this parameter as well as for other parameters of SIR model. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nThe SIR-model for an infectious disease can be written as follows, [6, 7] :\n\nThe number of susceptible persons is S, infected -I, removed -R; the infection and immunization rates are \uf061 and \uf072 respectively.

Then I can be calculated from (6) by putting S=N-V and function R from R=V-I.\n\nAs in paper [4] , we shall use the fact that the random function 1 ( , , )\n\nwith (see (9)). Then we can apply the linear regression (see [9] ) for every pair of parameters N and \uf06e and the corresponding values of 0 t and \uf061 . The optimal (the most reliable) values of N and \uf06e correspond to the maximum value of the correlation coefficient r (see [4] ).\n\nThe optimal values of parameters were calculated: means that these persons can couch the infection. Such situation needs additional analysis, in particular, with the use of more complicated models (see, e.g., [10] ).\n\nSimple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models."}
