{"title": "High incidence of viral co-infections and atypical bacterial detection in acute respiratory infections among hospitalized children in the Central Department of Paraguay, 2010e2011", "body": "Griffiths and colleagues, in this Journal, recently highlighted the nature and consequences of microbial coinfections. Their results suggest differences between co-infected patients and those with single infections, with co-infection having serious health effects. 1 The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens as single or as co-infections in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in Paraguay. ARIs with 3.5 million deaths annually, account for 20% of all deaths in pre-school children worldwide, with 90% of these deaths due to pneumonia. Risk factors for severe ARI include malnutrition, low birth weight, passive smoking, no breastfeeding, low socio-economic status, overcrowding, immunodeficiency and HIV infection, and consequently, the greatest morbidity associated with ARIs occurs in the developing world. 2 The most frequently implicated viruses consistently shown to predominate among hospitalized children with ARIs are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-2-3-4). Other commonly implicated pathogens are influenza A and B viruses (FluA and Flu B), adenovirus (AdV), human coronavirus (hCoV) and enterovirus (EV), and human bocavirus (hBoV). 3e7 The expansion in the number of circulating pathogens, combined with an increased capacity to simultaneously test for multiple organisms through the use of recent advances in molecular detection, 5, 8 has highlighted the potential impact of co-infections, when more than one pathogen from a single sample has been identified.\n\nBetween May 2010 and October 2011, we recruited 76 children (54 males) less than 2 years of age (median age 5.9 months, IQR 1e24), hospitalized at the Hospital General Pedi atrico Ni\u00f1os de Acosta\u00d1u (HGP), a public pediatric teaching hospital. This Hospital provides medical care mainly to low-income families residing in the Central Department, which has a population of around 2 million (w25% of Paraguayan population), including approximately 210,000 children under 5 years of age, and a density of 800 inhabitants/km 2 .\n\nChildren with symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection (upper and/or lower respiratory tract manifestations of ARI) with an onset of illness less than 7 days before hospitalization without pneumonia were included in this study. Bronchiolitis was diagnosed in children, whose upper respiratory symptoms preceded lower respiratory symptoms of wheeze, tachypnea, and other signs of respiratory distress.\n\nDNA and RNA extracted from 200 mL of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NAs), using the silica powder method, 9 were tested for the presence of 18 viral and 5 bacterial respiratory pathogens in six multiplex reverse-transcription PCR reactions by Real Time PCR (qPCR) using the kit Fast-Track Respiratory pathogens plus (Fast-Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg), and analyzed on an ABI 7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, USA).\n\nNinety-eight viruses were identified in 88.2% (67/76) of cases and 77.6% of the patients carried at least one pathogenic bacterium in NA. The most commonly identified viruses were rhinovirus (30% of cases); parainfluenza viruses (25.0%) with PIV3 representing the majority 8/19 (42.0%), followed by PIV1 6/19 (31.6%); coronaviruses were found in 18 samples (23.7%) with OC43 being the most common, i.e. 13/18 (72.2%) among CoVs positive samples; RSV (18.4%), AdV (9.2%), hBoV (13.2%) and hMPV (5.3%) ( Among 23 hospitalized children with hRV infection, 20 (87%) were in the 2e6 month age group, all of which presented severe bronchiolitis. Identification of hRV alone in 9/23, and co-infections with BoV, CoVs, and hMPV required around 1e4 days of hospitalization; however, coinfections with AdV, RSV, EV, and PIV required longer hospitalization (4e10 days). Only one virus was detected in 7 out of 17 (41.2%) cases that required 6e18 days of hospitalization (Table 2) .\n\nInfections detected with RSV either alone in 8/14 of cases, or in co-infections with other respiratory viruses such as AdV, hRV, CoV, were more severe considering time of hospitalization (5e15 days). The median time of hospitalization in cases with RSV infection was 4.4 days, a 2-fold increase compared to cases with hRV infection (median time 2.2 days). Scientists have questioned whether hRV co-infections lead to more severe clinical syndromes, leading to longer hospitalizations. 10 A better understanding of the full spectrum of bacterial colonization and of the respiratory viruses causing ARIs among hospitalized children in resource-limited tropical countries is essential to improve preventive and therapeutic strategies. It was suggested recently that co-infecting pathogens generally interact to worsen human health. 8 Platforms have not yet been adapted to the needs of clinics at district or local levels, nor have they even been in hospitals of major cities. To date, most surveillance for respiratory Letters to the Editor viruses in control programs are using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, detecting seven common respiratory viruses RSV, FluA and FluB, PIV1-3 and AdV. We describe for the first time in Paraguay the circulation of non-common respiratory viruses either alone or in co-infections with other respiratory viruses such as CoVs, BoV, hMPV and EV. The quantitative detection of multiple agents in nasopharyngeal specimens is an ideal approach to better understand the carriage and its relationship with the pathogen causing disease.\n\nInterpreting co-pathogen data is problematic due to the difficulty in differentiating acute disease from long-term shedding, and the extent that bronchiolitis may be caused or exacerbated by other viruses must be established.
