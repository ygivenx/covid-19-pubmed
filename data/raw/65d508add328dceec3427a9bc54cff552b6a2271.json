However criteria to decide when to conduct contact tracing (CT) are not well established -especially in situations of international passenger transport. We have investigated the available evidence for CT with a focus on public ground transport aiming to give guidance in what situations CT should be considered.\n\nRelevant infectious diseases suitable for CT in ground transport and a set of disease specific epidemiological criteria were defined through an evidence based approach. We conducted structured multi-step expert consultations and developed continuous scales for each criterion to be rated for its relevance to CT in ground transport. We used the Delphi method to position the criteria of associated values on the respective scales.\n\nThe study led to the development of the \"Contact Tracing-Risk Assessment Profile\" (CT-RAP), an interactive decision making instrument, taking into account pathogen specific as well as situation specific criteria.

CT is an established procedure to control infectious disease transmission and it is gaining importance in the International Health Regulations [3] . The decision to initiate CT usually needs to be made on short notice to be effective and typically within a context of provisional and limited information. This results in a need for decision aids that would provide standardization and, at the same time, allow flexibility in the decision process given the diverse circumstances in which the risk of infectious disease spread has to be assessed.\n\nIn the framework of the EU-funded project \"Response to Emerging infectious disease: Assessment and development of Core capacities and Tools\" (REACT) we have investigated available evidence and tools on CT aiming to guide public health institutions in their decision making.\n\nTravelling in public transport, often in confined spaces, provides opportunities for exposure to infectious pathogens. It seems likely that the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission in public ground transport such as bus/coach, railway, and tram/metro is higher than in air transport [4] . While guidelines on CT after exposure to airborne infectious pathogens during air travel exist [5] [6] [7] , no guidance documents are available on CT in response to potential exposure on public ground transport, even though European transport statistics show that the share of total transport performance in 2007 in public ground transport was nearly twice as high (15.7%) as the share for air transport performance (8.8%) [8, 9] .\n\nWe encountered two dominating formats for recommendations on CT: the first is a descriptive text or a list of variable length and precision [10] [11] [12] [13] . The other frequently used format is a flow chart which presents certain conditions in successive order contributing to the outcome with an equal weight [6, 12, [14] [15] [16] . Both formats have their shortcomings when the available evidence and the multitude of settings cannot readily be subsumed under dichotomized decision tree algorithms.\n\nUsing an evidence-based approach we developed a risk assessment tool for CT after infectious disease exposure in public ground transport which would take into account a review of the scientific literature and practical experience by relevant experts. The aim was to present the guidance as explicitly as possible but also to give transparent account of the uncertainties resulting from limited evidence. This article reports on the methodological basis of this risk assessment tool. We present the results in exemplary risk assessment profiles for deciding whether or not CT may be indicated after passengers have been exposed to tuberculosis or meningococcal disease in public ground transport.\n\nWe screened guidelines, position papers, and peer-reviewed literature for disease specific epidemiological parameters, such as infectiousness of index case during exposure, symptom(s) of index case during exposure period, duration of exposure of contact person to index case, proximity and quality of contact between index case and fellow passengers, susceptibility of fellow passengers, possibility of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and information on environmental factors potentially influencing the transmission of infectious diseases [17] .\n\nTo provide scientific and technical input, four core experts from diverse settings were nominated to cover a wide range of perspectives: one infectious disease epidemiologist working for an international public health agency, one infectious disease epidemiologist working for a national public health institute, one infectious disease epidemiologist working for a local public health institute, and one expert in security/health issues working for an international public transport association. Those core experts participated in two structured round table consultations. We also consulted epidemiologists from the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) with disease specific expertise. In addition 18 international infectious disease epidemiologists affiliated with the REACT project contributed their expertise to a Delphi consultation process.\n\nStep 1: Selection of infectious diseases At the first round table consultation, we turned to the four core experts to gather information enabling us to select infectious diseases that require CT in public ground transport and to identify general epidemiological and environmental criteria that might influence the transmission of infectious diseases and the subsequent decision making process.\n\nStep 2: Selection of criteria & associated values\n\nWhere necessary, the general criteria identified were transformed into epidemiologic criteria specifically defined in relation to a specific infectious disease. Subsequently, we defined between two and four values with respect to the epidemiological criterion, e.g. for the tuberculosis specific epidemiological criterion \"transmission to other contact persons\" we defined the two values \"evidence of transmission\" and \"no evidence of transmission\". The definition of those epidemiological criteria related values was deducted from the scientific literature with input from RKI infectious disease experts.\n\nStep 3: Positioning of values on Osgood\u00b4s scale\n\nBased on the principle of Osgood's bipolar semantic differential scale [18, 19] we developed for each of the selected epidemiological criteria of tuberculosis and meningococcal disease continuous 20 cm scales [20] with a predefined midpoint. Positioning of an epidemiological criterion related value towards the very right end of the scale was to indicate a stronger argument in favour of CT while positioning towards the left end was to indicate that CT was not recommended. RKI experts performed a provisional positioning of each value on the scales. Then 18 international experts in the field of infectious disease epidemiology were invited to clearly mark the position and range (starting and end points) on a blank scale representing best his/her view on the indication to initiate CT for each epidemiological criterion.\n\nWe applied the Delphi method with the international expert panel as developed by the RAND Corporation to refine the position of values on bipolar scales [21] [22] [23] . After this first round, the markings on the scales for each value were collected and compiled. The input was shared in a plenary session by showing the median of the start and end points for each value. Contributions remained anonymous at all times. In a second and final round, the international experts were given the opportunity to rearrange the primary voting on the placement and range of values.\n\nStep 4: Adjustments, refinements and background documents Based on the results from the Delphi process we merged two values if their positions on the scales were largely overlapping and thus not leading to any discriminative power. We displayed the range of \n\nThe international expert group identified tuberculosis and meningococcal disease as the two infectious diseases with the highest priority for the development of a disease specific risk assessment tool.\n\nTuberculosis was selected because of the stigmatisation and the long duration of treatment whereas meningococcal disease was identified because of the potentially severe complications and the high case fatality rate. Measles and viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa fever) were also identified as possible candidates for the development of a risk assessment tool, but tuberculosis and meningococcal disease were prioritized.\n\nThe core expert group identified 17 generic epidemiological criteria to be considered for the development of such a CT risk assessment tool. Six of the criteria (\"therapy or targeted measures available\", \"airborne transmission\", \"communicability during symptoms\" , \"high grade immunedeficiency or immuno-suppression of contact person\", \"travel duration > 8 hours\", \"distance to index case < 1 meter\") were identified to be relevant and applicable for both tuberculosis and meningococcal disease, two epidemiological criteria applied only to meningococcal disease (\"prophylaxis available\", \"communicability before onset of symptoms\"). The following epidemiological criteria were identified not to be relevant for tuberculosis or meningococcal disease: \"high infectiousness\", \"high morbidity rate\", \"severe complications\", \"vaccination status of contact person\", \"high humidity\", \"pregnancy of contact person\", \"contact person > 60 years\", \"contact person < 1 year\", \"high seriousness as perceived by public\". Our report describes the methodological concept of an evidence-based decision making tool and presents CT-RAP examples on tuberculosis and on meningococcal disease. This new approach aims to semi-quantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar since the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision but allows to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterizes a specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but tends to suggest a precision the available evidence does not support. Thus the visual impression resulting from the connecting lines between the ticked values of the epidemiological criteria is likely to give enough of a tendency to quickly support decision making while leaving enough room for the decision makers to take other important issues into account. In addition the disease specific epidemiological criteria of the CT-RAP can, in combination with the fact sheet, be employed as a checklist of decisive parameters.\n\nA 24 year-old female exchange student from Brussels, Belgium, travels to Berlin, Germany by coach.\n\nNine days later, she is being diagnosed with disease X. Her medical record is uneventful; she reports excellent health in the previous three years. She describes symptom onset of cough just before boarding the bus. During the 9.5 hour trip, she had kept to herself listening to music in the back of the bus. The coach company does not keep passenger lists on this route but estimates that there were a total of 12 persons aboard. They confirm that air conditioning with partial air exchange is in use on all vehicles and therefore windows remain closed at all times. No further information is available.\n\nIf in this scenario the disease is infectious pulmonary tuberculosis ( Figure 3 ) the completed CT-RAP indicates that a contact investigation could be given further consideration. Taking identical circumstances, i.e. the same setting etc., but replacing infectious pulmonary tuberculosis with meningococcal disease, the connecting line on the disease specific CT-RAP signals that CT might be much less called for ( Figure 4 ).\n\nCT after potential transmission of infectious diseases in public ground transport is often hampered by logistic hurdles, tracing passengers may be limited or even unfeasible since passenger data (e.g., name, telephone number, email address) in metros, trams and short distance bus trips are not collected. If passenger data are indeed collected, incompleteness of data, transport company policies and limited or delayed (retrospective) access to data may be further obstacles. Even in long-distance railway or bus transportation, passenger data may also not be collected routinely [4, 24] . Taking into account the logistic bottle necks and the high financial resources CT may require, we suppose that only circumstances related to dramatic illness and identifiable travel groups would justify contact investigations in the setting of public ground transport. We complemented the available scientific evidence generated through the literature review by structured multi-step expert consultations. While individual experts might not appreciate all epidemiological criteria equally well or weigh their effects differently, all criteria selections with their respective values on our CT-RAPs are the result a Delphi consultation process. We are aware that information such as \"susceptibility of contact persons\", \"quality of contact between index case and contact person\", or other information may not be available in each setting. Nevertheless the CT-RAP may be used under such circumstances: if there is no information available on a criterion, the neutral midline position on the scale of the respective epidemiological criterion has to be chosen and the indication remains unaffected.\n\nThe two CT-RAP examples on tuberculosis and meningococcal disease shown in Figure 3 and 4 illustrate how this this new tool offers a highly standardized decision algorithm where evidence allows,\n\nbut also remains open for consideration of other factors. For example a public health official might consider a contact investigation in the tuberculosis scenario dependent upon the drug resistance pattern of the index case. Likewise, in the meningococcal disease scenario a CT might only yield results the following day at the earliest. This would be right at the time limit of 10 days post exposure as indicated in the preceding algorithm and favour a decision against CT.\n\nThe systematic and transparent use of the evidence in the presented CT-RAP is likely to facilitate rational and user-friendly decisions with respect to CT in general. The creation of more CT-RAPs for other pathogens and settings is envisaged. However, since the development of a CT-RAP is labour intensive we initiated an evaluation of the existing tools to support the decision whether or not to produce more rapid risk assessment profiles and if so for which settings (e.g., schools, kindergartens) and for which infectious diseases (e.g. measles, Lassa fever react@rki.de). We also present this paper to invite the scientific and public health community to comment on this new approach in order to guide our next developments in this field. Depending on the feedback and our experiences new disease specific CT-RAPs may be developed and thus contribute to a more evidence based and yet rapid and flexible approach in specific infectious disease control measures.\n\nThe following colleagues served as scientific advisors and we would like to thank for their very valuable and creative contribution to this work: \n\nBoth the CT-RAP on tuberculosis and the CT-RAP on meningococcal disease start with a dichotomous decision step. If necessary the user may proceed with the bipolar scale component: the two endpoints of the bipolar scales represent a high (on the right hand side) or a low (on the left hand side) indication whether or not to start CT. The values selected and ticked may cluster on either side of the neutral midline or around the midline according to the particular details of the situation. By drawing a line connecting selected values an overall assessment is visualized (cf. Figure 3 , Figure 4 ). If most values in the CT-RAP cluster on the right end of the scale, the result can be interpreted as an indication to start the CT process. In contrast, profiles with values marked predominantly on the left end of the scale indicate a low indication for CT. If CT-RAP values are predominantly positioned around the midline, a recommendation neither for nor against CT may be deduced. The neutral position should also be chosen lack of information does not allow the allocation of a value. \n\nBoth the CT-RAP on tuberculosis and the CT-RAP on meningococcal disease start with a dichotomous decision step.

In addition the disease specific epidemiological criteria of the 6 CT-RAP can, in combination with the fact sheet, be employed as a checklist of decisive parameters.\n\nThe concept is novel insofar as it addresses the need for rapid and transparent decision making in 9 situations and settings where scientific evidence is scarce. An attempt to give a semi-quantitative 10 account of the degree of uncertainty, e.g. by plotting confidence intervals and means for each point 11 estimate representing the experts' opinions, is of course subject for discussion. Indicating medians as 12 well as minimum and maximum point estimates would be an alternative approach. Both approaches 13 have their advantages. Even the objective to give a semi-quantitative account of the degree of 14 uncertainty might be questioned. But we preferred to show the degree of uncertainty inherent in each 15 decisive criterion by displaying the range of values through whiskers (median of the highest and lowest 16 ranking of aggregated expert\u00b4s opinions). Considering that some criteria have a lesser degree of 17 uncertainty than others and that some users might not consider the degree of uncertainty at all, we 18 believe our approach is more suitable.\n\nIt could be argued that criteria should be removed from the decision making tool if the point estimates 21 of the different outcomes cluster closely around the neutral midline and thus do not sway a decision 22 either way, however all criteria were included in the first instance because they have been raised in 23 various publications or during expert consultations. We decided to keep them in spite of the fact they 24 might carry little discriminatory power because users might question how these criteria compare to 25 others. Moreover they demonstrate that our process of collecting available evidence and assessing it 26 systematically by experts did indeed generate somewhat unexpected yet plausible results.\n\nThe graphical display of the criteria allows selected criteria to be presented next to each other without 28 suggesting specific weights or assigning priorities to each criterion. E.g. antimicrobial resistance may 29 be a more important issue to take into account in some country than others.

However, since 35 the development of a CT-RAP is labour intensive we initiated an evaluation of the existing tools to 36 support the decision whether or not to produce more rapid risk assessment profiles and if so for which 37 settings (e.g., schools, kindergartens) and for which infectious diseases (e.g. measles, Lassa fever). In Contact tracing is defined as the identification of persons who may have been exposed to an 30 infectious pathogen by an infected person and ensuring that they are aware of their exposure [1, 2] .\n\nContact tracing is an established procedure to control infectious disease transmission and it is gaining 32 importance in the International Health Regulations [3] . The decision to initiate contact tracing usually 33 needs to be made on short notice to be effective and typically within a context of provisional and 34 limited information. This results in a need for decision aids that would provide standardization and, at 35 the same time, allow flexibility in the decision making process given the diverse circumstances in 36 which the risk of infectious disease spread has to be assessed. In the framework of the EU-funded project \"Response to Emerging infectious disease: Assessment 1 and development of Core capacities and Tools\" (REACT) we have investigated available evidence and 2 tools on contact tracing aiming to guide public health institutions in their decision making. 3 4 Travelling in public transport, often in confined spaces, provides risks for exposure to infectious 5 pathogens. It seems likely that the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission in public ground 6 transport such as bus/coach, railway, and tram/metro is higher than in air transport [4] . While 7 guidelines on contact tracing after exposure to airborne infectious pathogens during air travel exist [5-8 7] , no guidance documents are available on contact tracing in response to potential exposure on 9 public ground transport, even though European transport statistics show that the share of total 10 transport performance in 2007 in public ground transport was nearly twice as high (15.7%) as the 11 share for air transport performance (8.8%) [8, 9] . \n\nIn order to address the above mentioned challenges we developed a risk assessment tool informed by 20 a review of the scientific literature on the one hand and the practical experience of experts. The aim 21 was to present the guidance as explicitly as possible but also to give transparent account of the 22 uncertainties resulting from limited evidence or data. This article reports on the methodological basis 23 of this risk assessment tool. We present the results in exemplary risk assessment profiles for deciding 24 whether or not contact tracing may be indicated after passengers have been exposed to 25 Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Neisseria meningitidis in public ground transport.

Six of the criteria (\"therapy or targeted 7 measures available\", \"airborne transmission\", \"communicability during symptoms\", \"high grade 8 immune-deficiency or immuno-suppression of contact person\", \"travel duration > 8 hours\", \"distance to 9 index case < 1 meter\") were identified to be relevant and applicable for both tuberculosis and 10 meningococcal disease, two epidemiological criteria applied only to meningococcal disease 11 (\"prophylaxis available\", \"communicability before onset of symptoms\") and \"drug resistance pattern\" 12 was added for tuberculosis as a result of the expert consultation in step two. The following 13 epidemiological criteria were identified not to be relevant for tuberculosis or meningococcal disease: 14 \"high infectiousness\", \"high morbidity rate\", \"severe complications\", \"vaccination status of contact 15 person\", \"high humidity\", \"pregnancy of contact person\", \"contact person > 60 years\", \"contact person 16 < 1 year\", \"high seriousness as perceived by public\". 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Our report describes the methodological concept of a decision making tool and presents CT-RAP 5 examples on tuberculosis and on meningococcal disease. This new approach aims to semi-6 quantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk 7 assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well 8 established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a 9 pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based 10 on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since 11 the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision 12 but allows to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterizes a 13 specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of 14 individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but tends to suggest a 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 suggesting specific weights or assigning priorities to each criterion. E.g. antimicrobial resistance may 1 be a more important issue to take into account in some country than others. The nomination procedure 2 for the expert panel was based on the rather strong objective and guiding principle to represent 3 different EU countries and various stakeholders, a prerequisite for successful funding within the EU 4 public health programme.\n\nCase example and legend for figures 3 and 4:\n\nA 24 year-old female exchange student from Brussels, Belgium, travels to Berlin, Germany by coach.\n\nNine days later, she is being diagnosed with disease X. Her medical record is uneventful; she reports 9 excellent health in the previous three years. She describes symptom onset of cough just before boarding 10 the bus. During the 9.5 hour trip, she had kept to herself listening to music in the back of the bus. The 11 coach company does not keep passenger lists on this route but estimates that there were a total of 12 12 persons aboard. They confirm that air conditioning with partial air exchange is in use on all vehicles and 13 therefore windows remain closed at all times. No further information is available.\n\n14 If in this scenario the disease is infectious pulmonary tuberculosis ( Figure 3 ) the completed CT-RAP 15 indicates that a contact investigation could be given further consideration. Taking identical 16 circumstances, i.e. the same setting etc., but replacing infectious pulmonary tuberculosis with 17 meningococcal disease, the connecting line on the disease specific CT-RAP signals that contact tracing 18 might be much less called for (Figure 4 ).\n\nContact tracing after potential transmission of infectious diseases in public ground transport is often 21 hampered by logistic hurdles, tracing passengers may be limited or even unfeasible since passenger 22 data (e.g., name, telephone number, email address) in metros, trams and short distance bus trips are 23 not collected. If passenger data are indeed collected, incompleteness of data, transport company 24 policies and limited or delayed (retrospective) access to data may be further obstacles. Even in long-25 distance railway or bus transportation, passenger data may also not be collected routinely [4, 24] .\n\nTaking into account the logistic bottle necks and the high financial resources contact tracing may 27 require, we suppose that only circumstances related to dramatic illness and identifiable travel groups 28 would justify contact investigations in the setting of public ground transport. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The systematic and transparent use of the evidence in the presented CT-RAP for tuberculosis and 8 meningococcal disease is likely to facilitate rational and user-friendly decisions with respect to contact 9 tracing.

The other 17 frequently used format is a flow chart which presents certain conditions in successive order thus 18 resulting in each condition contributing an equal weight to the final decision [6, 12, [14] [15] [16] . Both 19 formats have their shortcomings when the available evidence and the multitude of settings cannot 20 readily be subsumed under dichotomized decision tree algorithms.\n\nIn order to address the above mentioned challenges we developed a risk assessment tool informed by 22 a review of the scientific literature on the one hand and the practical experience of experts.

Those four core experts provide the project with expertise 10 from diverse settings. As required by the donor they represent different EU countries and various 11 stakeholders. The core experts cover a wide range of perspectives: one infectious disease 12 epidemiologist working for an international public health agency, one infectious disease epidemiologist 13 working for a national public health institute, one infectious disease epidemiologist working for a local 14 public health institute, and one expert in security/health issues working for an international public 15 transport association. Those core experts participated in two structured round The international expert group identified tuberculosis and meningococcal disease as the two infectious 1 diseases with the highest priority for the development of a disease specific risk assessment tool.\n\nTuberculosis was selected because of the stigmatisation and the long duration of treatment whereas 3 meningococcal disease was identified because of the potentially severe complications and the high 4 case fatality rate. Measles and viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa fever) were also identified as possible 5 future candidates for the development of a risk assessment tool.\n\n6 7 Selected criteria 8\n\nThe core expert group identified 17 generic epidemiological criteria to be considered for the 9 development of such a contact tracing risk assessment tool.
