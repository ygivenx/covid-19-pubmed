{"title": "Novel PDE4 Inhibitors Derived from Chinese Medicine Forsythia", "body": "Phosphodiesterase (PDE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond, most notably those of the second messenger cascade molecules cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cAMP and cGMP bind to the regulatory units of protein kinase A(PKA) allowing for phosphorylation thus transducing signal cascades in the cell [1]\u2013[3]. Consequently, by severing these cA/GMP-dependent pathways, PDE has an enormous clinical significance monitoring cAMP and cGMP levels in cells. The PDE superfamily comprises 11 subfamilies, PDE1-11, respectively, each utilizing different substrate specificities. For example, PDE4, 7, and 8 strictly hydrolyze cAMP; PDE5, 6, and 9, on the other hand, only hydrolyze cGMP while the other family members (PDE1, 2, 3, 10, 11) can target both cAMP and cGMP for hydrolysation [4]. For many years, PDE enzymes have remained an interest within the pharmaceutical industry, as inhibition of PDE can increase the levels of cAMP or cGMP thus enhancing or prolonging their natural physiological effects [5].\n\nCurrently, various small molecular compounds have been discovered to inhibit PDEs. For example, caffeine, aminophylline, and IBMX are nonselective PDE inhibitors [6] that increase intracellular cAMP, thereby activating PKA, thus inhibiting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other inflammatory cytokines, and reducing inflammation [7]. There are also selective PDE inhibitors. Specifically, PDE3 inhibitors such as inamrinone and milrinone, are used for short-term treatment of congestive heart failure [8], and Cilostazol used in the treatment of intermittent claudication [9]. The PDE5 inhibitors Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil boost cGMP levels in penile tissue [10]\u2013[12] and are used primarily for erectile dysfunction, as well as having secondary indication in treatment of pulmonary hypertension [13], [14]. Recently, an opium alkaloid, Papaverine, was shown to inhibit PDE10 [15]. Among all of the PDE isoforms, PDE4 is the major cAMP-degrading enzyme found in inflammatory and immune cells. Selectively inhibiting PDE4 prevents the release of cytokines and other inflammatory factors and hinders the production of reactive oxygen species [16], [17].\n\nAs the leading causes of infectious deaths in the US, sepsis and pneumonia are pathognomonically linked to a burst in cytokine release, i.e. cytokine storm, from pro-inflammatory cells including macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [18]\n[19]. Cytokine storm occurs in response to infection with virulent pathogens, host cell injury, or irritants that activate a multitude of receptors on immune effector cells. Under some conditions it is exaggerated (hypercytokinemia) and results in a fatal immune reaction with constant activation of immune effector cells that produce sustained or supraphysiologic levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL1), and interleukin-6 (IL6) that results in severe tissue injury and often death. Thus, selectively inhibiting PDE4 may ameliorate cytokine storm and prevent tissue injury.\n\nThe earliest Pharmacopoeia in the world, the \u201cTang Ben Cao\u201d, completed in 659 AD is the first known documentation of the Forsythia suspensa plant being used to treat fever, flu-like, and inflammatory symptoms. Since then, it has been habitually and widely used in Asia as one of the major traditional medicines. Nowadays, the extract of Forsythia suspensa seeds is used to treat numerous inflammatory diseases including but not limited to erysipelas, inflammation, pharyngitis, pyrexia, tonsillitis, and ulcers [20], [21]. Moreover, it has been shown in studies that the crude extract displays potential antibacterial, antiviral, choleretic and antipyretic effects [22]. Medicinal chemistry studies on Forsythia seeds have revealed phenolic compounds including lignans and flavonols which are suspected to be responsible for the various biological activities of the herb [22], [23]. In this study, we sought to better understand Forsythia lignan Forsythin structure-function relationships and it was used to design and test a new class of selective PDE4 inhibitors. These selective PDE4 inhibitors exert potent anti-inflammatory activity in several murine models of inflammation.\n\nForsythin is one of the major bioactive compounds extracted from Forsythia suspensa seeds (Fig. 1A\u2013B) (27). An o-linked \u03b2-D-glucopyranosylated lignan, Forsythin readily can be hydrolyzed to remove a glucose moiety (Fig. 1C). Using the structure of the predicted metabolite, we assessed the virtual docking with PDE4D (based on PyMol PDB 1 mkd.phg) using LibDock (Discovery Studio, Accelrys Software Inc./BIOVIA, San Diego, CA) (Fig. 1D,E). Using ZINCPharmer [24], we then generated a pharmacophore model (Fig. 1E top left) that enabled the identification of over 100 high value targets from a 18.3 million purchasable compound library. We refined this search by performing a computer based docking analysis of the target compounds using LibDock (Discovery Studio 3.5) and selected 14 compounds (Fig. 2) for further testing using an in\nvitro phosphodiesterease activity assay.\n\nCompounds 1\u201314 (Fig. 2) were tested in\nvitro using PDE-glo phosphodiesterase assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, all the compounds were diluted in DMSO, and the final concentrations in each assay were 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 \u00b5M. For the PDE4 activity assay, 10 mU of purified PDE4D (Millipore) was used per reaction. Compound 7, which is Forsythin, exhibited [IC50] PDE4 = 8 \u00b5M. Other custom designed compounds such as 6, 9 and 13 exhibited much greater potency with an [IC50] towards PDE4 ranging from 10\u201390 nM. Impressively, all of the test compounds exhibited selectively toward PDE4, in as much as the [IC50]>80 \u00b5M with PDE3, 5, 7, and 10 (Fig. 3).\n\nCompound 6, 7, 9 and 13 were also tested in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 (Fig. 4A) and PBMC (Fig. 4B) cells to evaluate their ability to suppress TNF secretion. Compound 7, which is Forsythin, exhibited [IC50] TNF = 8\u201310 \u00b5M in RAW264.7 and PBMC cells, which is comparable to its [IC50] PDE4. Other custom designed compounds such as 6, 9 and 13 exhibited much greater potency with an [IC50] towards TNF ranging from 25\u2013400 nM. Specifically, compound 13 exhibited greatest potency towards PDE4 with [IC50] = 10 nM (Fig. 3), it also exhibited comparable potency towards [IC50] TNF ranging from 25\u201375 nM (Fig. 4C).\n\nTo assess any in\nvivo anti-inflammatory activity, four compounds [C2, C6, C7 and C9, 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection] were administered in a LPS-induced pneumonia model. Briefly, compounds were administered to mice at various doses through an i.p. injection 10 min after mice were given LPS (i.t. 3 mg/kg). Mice were then euthanized 16 h later using pentobarbital; BAL was collected and assayed for IL1, IL6 and TNF cytokine levels. These compounds varied in their ability to ameliorate lavage cytokines, protein concentration, and total cell counts from LPS-treated mice (Fig. 5A\u2013E). In addition, these inhibitors diminished histological evidence of lung injury (Fig. 5F).\n\nAs a widely used model of sepsis [25], selective PDE4 inhibitors (C6, 7 and 9) were administered to mice at various doses through an i.p. injection, and 10 min later mice were given LPS (E. coli, 100 ug i.p.). Mice were euthanized 2 h later using pentobarbital where blood was collected and assayed for IL6 and TNF cytokine levels. All inhibitors exhibited high potency in\nvivo (inhibitory dose [ID50] TNF = 0.01\u223c1 mg/kg, ID50 IL-6 = 0.1\u223c1 mg/kg,) (Fig. 6A\u2013B). In a separate experiment, a brief pharmacokinetic study was performed where PDE4 inhibitors (1 mg/kg, i.p.) were given to mice 18 h before LPS administration (E. coli, 100 ug i.p.). Compound 9 demonstrated excellent efficacy reducing both serum TNF and IL-6 cytokines even after 18 h lead time (Fig. 6C\u2013D).\n\nTo further test these compounds, mice were challenged with H1N1 (105 pfu/mose i.t.) without (vehicle control) or with C6, C7, C9, or C13 treatment (30 \u00b5g/ml added to drinking water containing 2% sucrose: estimated dose = 5 mg/kg/d). All four PDE4 inhibitors significantly improved the survival of mice infected with H1N1 compared with mice receiving diluent (Fig. 7A). The PDE inhibitors also decreased lavage cell counts, protein concentrations, and lavage cytokine IL-6 and TNF (Fig. 7B\u2013E). Impressively, PDE4 inhibitors also significantly reduced serum cytokines induced from the H1N1-induced systematic inflammation (Fig. 7F,G). The tested compounds were also able to lessen signs of tissue injury (Fig. 7H). These results suggest that the selective PDE4 inhibitors suppress inflammation and preserve lung homeostasis after pulmonary H1N1 infection.\n\nIt has been known for years that increased cAMP from PDE4 inhibition or gene knockout were able to markedly decrease inflammatory responses in immune cells [26]. cAMP controls inflammation through several distinct pathways, including cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, cAMP-activated protein kinases (PKA), or exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) [27]. Specifically, cAMP actives PKA, negatively regulates NF-KB pathway, thus suppressing the release of proinflammatory mediators (eg, TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-17, Interferon-\u03b3) [28]. Moreover, cAMP actives transcriptions of anti-inflammatory gene such as interleukin-10 through transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) [29]. Thus, pharmacological targeting of PDE4 may be a promising strategy for anti-inflammatory therapy.\n\nHere we developed a novel class of selective PDE4 inhibitors that exert robust anti-inflammatory activity by impairing cytokine release in three preclinical models. The structural basis for our drug design emerged from Forsythin, the one of major compound extracted from Forsythia suspensa seeds. Among the 14 compounds tested in this study, synthetic compounds 6, 9 and 13 showed the potent IC50 (10\u201390 nM) toward PDE4. Impressively, these compounds also exhibit high selectivity toward PDE4, with >80 \u00b5M IC50 towards other PDE enzymes (Fig. 3). Compounds 6, 9 and 13 also showed potent IC50 (20\u2013450 nM) toward TNF inhibition in LPS stimulated RAW274.7 and PBMC cells. Many natural compounds, such as the flavonoid derivatives Hesperetin and prunetin, were also isolated from traditional Chinese medicines are selective inhibitors of PDE4 with an IC50 ranging from 10\u2013100 \u00b5M [30]. However, little is known about the structure\u2013activity relationship between such lignans or their inhibitory effect on proteins in the inflammatory pathway. In this study, we determined that o-linked \u03b2-D-glucopyranosided lignan Forsythin is a weak but selective inhibitor of PDE4. Structurally speaking, compound 6 and Forsythin are highly similar except that Forsythin is an o-linked \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside. In vitro, Forsythin is >80 times weaker in activity toward PDE4 compared with compound 6. However, our in\nvivo study suggested that Forsythin and compound 6 exhibit similar activities in several murine models (Fig. 5A, 6C, 7B). This suggests that Forsythin may act as a prodrug that its glucopyranoside group will be potentially removed in\nvivo by \u03b2-glucosidase, and release the active lignin; which is a common of metabolic reaction in plant lignans and flavonols [31], [32].\n\nPandemic H5N1 Influenza virus and SARS virus are known to cause dangerous cytokine storm resulting in severe damage to alveoli and lung tissue and thus extremely high mortality rates [33], [34]. Today, viral pneumonia affects more than 100 million children and 100 million adults per year yet there are no effective treatments only supportive care [35]. Our H1N1 murine model recapitulates well with the deadly human viral pneumonia, as H5N1 Influenza infection is largely driven by an exuberant host response and amplification of cytokines and chemokines that contribute to influenza-induced morbidity and mortality [25], [36], [37]. Our pulmonary viral infection model was complemented with a murine sepsis model to provide assessment of PDE4 inhibitors on systemic inflammation by the endotoxin LPS [37], [38]. Importantly, in each of these models of inflammation, our PDE4 inhibitors (Compound 6, 7, 9, 13) were observed to lessen severity of tissue injury using varying modes of application (parenteral, oral), and none of the animals treated with the agents exhibited overt signs of distress. The dosing of these compounds also appeared to be excellent in\nvivo, with <1 mg/kg efficacious dose in both LPS pneumonia and sepsis model. Specifically, these compounds also appeared to have long half-life in\nvivo. As shown in Fig. 6C\u2013D, the septic shock model was carried out 18 h after the initial treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.), yet we still observed a 40\u201360% decrease in serum cytokines.\n\nOverall, our pre-clinical studies demonstrate the biological efficacy of selective PDE4 inhibitors in murine models where both infectious and irritant factors trigger cytokine release. These selective PDE4 inhibitors could potentially have broad applications in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. In fact the selective PDE4 inhibitor, Roflumilast, recently became the first FDA approved PDE4 inhibitor on the market [39], [40]. Roflumilast is a potent anti-inflammatory drug, particularly in pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, and rhinitis. Thus, PDE4 is a potentially important drug target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. However, further research and development clearly is needed to carefully ascertain the safety profile, distribution, elimination, and metabolism of these new chemical entities in larger models of inflammation. Successful results from these pharmacokinetic studies will set the stage for transition to clinical testing in subjects with acute and chronic immune-related illness.\n\nRAW 264.7 cells were from ATCC.
