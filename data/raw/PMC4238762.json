{"title": "Detection of respiratory viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction\nin outpatients with acute respiratory infection", "body": "This descriptive study was developed in Vit\u00f3ria, Southeast Brazil, from a set of\nbiological samples obtained over a two-year period (August 2007-August 2009) as a part\nof the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Program of the Ministry of Health, Brazil.\nNasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from patients of all ages who were\nattended at either emergency rooms or primary care units. The patients presented with\nfever (temperature equal to or greater than 38\u00baC) and runny nose, in addition to one or\nmore of the following symptoms: cough, myalgia, nasal congestion, headache, sore throat\nand earache, within five days of the symptom onset. The nasopharyngeal aspiration\nprocedure is a part of the routine of the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Program.\n\nAll samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) and FTDRP 21 plus\nmultiplex real-time RT-PCR assay.\n\nSeven respiratory viruses (RSV, PIV 1-3, Inf A, Inf B and HAdV) were screened in all\nspecimens by IIF using the Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening & Identification\nKitTM (Chemicon International, Millipore, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nTwenty-three respiratory pathogens, including 18 human respiratory viruses and five\nbacterial species, were tested using the multiplex protocol. Total nucleic acid was\nextracted using the MagNA Pure LC automated extraction system (Roche, Switzerland).\nNucleic acid was extracted from 200 \u00b5L of each NPA sample and was eluted to a final\nvolume of 100 \u00b5L following the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation v.12.0 (Roche)\nprotocol. An internal RNA virus control, Brome Mosaic Virus (Fast-track Diagnostics,\nLuxembourg), was introduced into the lysis buffer for each specimen to monitor the\nsample extraction and reverse transcription. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was performed\nusing the FTDRP 21 plus according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Fast-track\nDiagnostics). The reaction volume for each test was 25 \u00b5L, made up of 10 \u00b5L of nucleic\nacid and 15 \u00b5L of buffer/enzyme mix from the AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR kit (Ambion,\nLife Technologies, USA). Amplification was performed in the ABI 7500 real-time PCR\nsystem thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the following cycling conditions were\nused: 15 min at 50\u00baC, 10 min at 95\u00baC and 40 cycles of 8 s at 95\u00baC and 34 s at 60\u00baC. The\nfluorescence reading was taken in the 60\u00baC/34 s step in each cycle and the threshold\ncycle (Ct) values were determined by manual adjustment. Each sample was\namplified in six parallel reactions, which contained primers and probes for four\ndifferent targets, detecting viruses and pathogenic bacteria, in addition to the\ninternal control of the reaction. The positive and negative virus plasmid controls\nprovided in the kit were included in all runs to monitor the assay performance.\n\nExploratory analysis of the data was performed using the SPSS software package v.17.01\n(SPSS Inc, USA).\n\n\nEthics - The Research Ethical Committee of the Centre for Health\nSciences of Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo approved this study, with the\nregistration CEP-093/07.\n\nHere, we present the results of patients who met all inclusion criteria and whose\nsamples were analysed by both methods proposed in this study. One hundred sixty-two\noutpatients (79 male and 83 female) were included. The study consisted of both adult (n\n= 46) and paediatric (n = 116) individuals. The paediatric age group consisted of\nindividuals zero-19 years of age, including children and adolescents, according to the\nWorld Health Organization criteria. The median age of the entire cohort was seven years\n(range 1 month to 75 years). Children under nine years of age accounted for 66.7%\n(108/162) of the samples analysed. All patients had recent (\u2264 5 days) symptoms.\n\nIIF detected 33 positive specimens (20.4%). The influenza virus was the most common\netiologic agent detected (23/33). Inf A and Inf B corresponded to 8% (13/162) and 6.2%\n(10/162) of the samples, respectively. The IIF technique detected only single\ninfections. Eighty-eight (54.3%) specimens were positive for one or more respiratory\nviruses by multiplex real-time RT-PCR (Table I).\nThe influenza virus (15.4%), HRV (8%) and RSV (7.4%) were the viruses most frequently\ndetected and accounted for one-third of the positive samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the patient age groups, the influenza viruses were more frequently identified\nin young adults (20-39 years of age). All viruses were identified in infants (0-2 years\nold), with the exception of PIV 2, PIV 4 and EV. RSV and HRV were the most prevalent.\nMost of the samples positive for RSV (91.6%) and HRV (77%) were identified in infants.\nNo virus was identified in subjects above 40 years old (Figure).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following bacteria were detected: Streptococcus pneumoniae [n = 43\n(26.3%)], Staphylococcus aureus [n = 20 (12.3%)] and\nHaemophilus influenzae [n = 2 (1.2%)]; Mycoplasma\npneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were not detected\n(Table I).\n\nSix specimens (3.7%) were positive for two viruses. All co-detections occurred in\nchildren under two years of age and RSV accounted for half of those cases (Table II). No co-detections involved three or more\nrespiratory viruses. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 co-detection cases, with\nat least one infectious agent from the viral or bacterial pathogen groups (Table II).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections is usually accomplished\nthrough conventional techniques, such as culture or antigen detection tests, with\nlimitations related to the delay of the results and the availability of monoclonal\nantibodies for newly identified viruses (Mahony et al.\n2007). Multiplex PCR assays have become an important tool for the\nidentification of etiologic agents in ARIs (Dabisch-Ruthe et al. 2012, Sanghavi et al.\n2012). As described recently, the commercial multiplex FTDRP real-time RT-PCR\nassay has enhanced the diagnosis of ARIs, with simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory\nviruses (Sakthivel et al. 2012). The new version\nof the FTDRP assay used in this study has expanded the capacity for detecting pathogens\n(18 viral and 5 bacterial species) and has thus increased the diagnostic potential of\nthe test.\n\nMore than half (66.7%) of the study population were children under nine years of age,\nwhich is representative of the occurrence of ARIs in the community. The paediatric age\ngroup is the main group affected by ARIs, which occur three-eight times a year in\ninfants and young children, with incidences varying inversely to age (Bryce et al. 2005, Bezerra et al. 2011).\n\nThe viral agents most frequently identified were influenza viruses, including Inf A\n(H1N1) pdm09 (2 cases in patients with uncomplicated respiratory infection), followed by\nHRV and RSV. Since April 2009, the Inf A (H1N1) pdm09 virus has spread worldwide. Given\nthat the country\u2019s health authorities only declared sustainable transmission of the new\ninfluenza virus in Brazil (MS 2009) on 16 July\n2009, we assume that the observed low frequency of Inf A (H1N1) pdm09 is related to the\nendpoint of the present study, in August 2009.\n\nThe frequency of influenza virus infection observed in this study (15.4%) is consistent\nwith previously published rates varying from 2-26% of ARI cases in studies in South,\nSoutheast and Northeast Brazil (Arruda et al.\n1991, Bellei et al. 2008). Although wide\ninter-regional variations should be expected in a large country with different climates,\nthe variation may also be due to study design differences. All viruses screened in this\nstudy were more frequently identified in children, with the exception of influenza\nviruses, which were more often identified in adults (8.6%) than in paediatric patients\n(6.8%), as has been documented in a recent study (Pelat\net al. 2013).\n\nThe second most prevalent viral agent was HRV (8%): 77% of HRV-positive samples were\nidentified in children under two years of age. This finding highlights the importance of\nthis virus in infants, as HRV has been associated with recurrent respiratory illnesses\nand wheezing in this age group (Jartti et al.\n2008). Other picornaviruses may be etiologic agents of ARIs; however, HRV is\nthe main virus detected in cases of the common cold (Pitk\u00e4ranta & Hayden 1998). In a multicentre study, rhinoviruses were\noften associated with ARIs, even during the peak influenza season (Caruso et al. 2007). In Brazil, according to Arruda et al. (1991), HRV was the most frequent viral agent (46%)\ndetected in children with ARIs.\n\nThe frequency of RSV detection (7.4%) was similar to that detected by Raboni et al. (2011), who reported a rate of 8%\nusing multiplex RT-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses. Eleven (91.6%) of the RSV cases in\nthis study were detected in children under two years of age. RSV antibodies are found in\nvirtually all adults and children older than three years of age. At one year of age,\n25-50% of children have antibodies against RSV, demonstrating the high frequency of this\ninfection at a young age (Domachowske & Rosenberg\n1999). In keeping with this observation, the frequency of RSV in the youngest\nage group in our study was the highest among all ages (91.6%). However, the study was\nconducted with patients of widely variable ages: only two-thirds were children under\nnine and only 40% of the studied patients were children under two years of age. Hence,\nit is reasonable to consider that the observed relatively low frequency of RSV could be\nattributed, at least in part, to the under-representation of patients of very young\nages.\n\nThe frequency of HBoV was 3.1% and all cases occurred in children under two years of\nage. This virus has been frequently identified in this age group, although its\npathogenicity is not yet well defined (Longtin et al.\n2008, L\u00fcsebrink et al. 2009). Recently,\na higher HBoV-positive rate has been documented in inpatients when compared with\noutpatients or patients attended in emergency departments, suggesting a significant role\nof this virus in the pathogenesis of ARIs (Xu et al.\n2012).\n\nThe use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR increased the overall viral detection rate to\n54.3%, compared to 20.4% in the IFF test. This difference is likely due to the high\nsensitivity of virus genome detection (Lassauni\u00e8re et\nal. 2010). In addition, 47.9% of the samples that were positive by multiplex\nreal-time RT-PCR corresponded to respiratory viruses that were not tested for using the\nIIF kit, such as HRV, HCoV, hMPV, HBoV and EV. This finding confirms the importance of\nusing panels that identify multiple viral agents causing ARIs.\n\nIn this study, there were six cases (3.7%) of viral co-detection, most commonly with RSV\nand HRV. The real clinical significance of these infections has not yet been fully\nelucidated. In a recent Brazilian study, co-detection between RSV and HRV increased both\nthe length of hospitalisation and the time of supplemental oxygen use in children with\nlower respiratory tract infections, suggesting the possibility of co-infection among\nthese viruses and not only co-detection (da Silva et al.\n2013). All cases of co-detection observed in our study occurred in children\nunder two years old, the age group in which ARI cases are more frequent. It is quite\npossible that residual nucleic acids from sequential viral infections are detected\nsimultaneously by multiplex PCR with high sensitivity (Lesley 2012). Additionally, lymphoid tissues may serve as a reservoir of\nrespiratory viruses in asymptomatic individuals and may be involved in the transmission\nof these viruses to the community (Proenca-Modena et al.\n2012).\n\nThe likelihood of a pathogen to be the aetiologic agent of a given infection could be\nrelated to the Ct value in the real-time PCR reaction. Lower Ct\nvalues suggest higher loads of the pathogen detected, which may in turn suggest\naetiology (Brittain-Long et al. 2008). In this\nstudy, the Ct values were well below the cut-off value for positivity\nproposed by the manufacturer.\n\nThe overall bacterial detection rate was 40% and S. pneumoniae was the\nmost frequent agent identified. Despite the vaccination program, S.\npneumoniae is one of the main causes of pneumonia mortality (responsible for\nat least 18% of severe episodes and 33% of deaths worldwide) (Walker et al. 2013). Bacteria were co-detected with viruses in 25\nspecimens. The potentially pathogenic bacteria detected in this study could reflect\ntransient microbiota or a nasopharyngeal flora and may not be associated with ARIs;\nhowever, it is well known that viral infections within the respiratory tract predispose\nthe individual to bacterial infections, notably through the disruption of the\nrespiratory mucosal epithelium (Bakaletz 1995).\nAtypical bacteria (M. pneumoniae and C. pneumonia)\nwere not detected in the studied population.\n\nIn Brazil and other countries, the respiratory virus surveillance programs use\nconventional diagnostic techniques, such as IIF. A large proportion of biological\nsamples remain negative, even with clinical evidence of respiratory infection. A\nmolecular technique such as real-time PCR can be an important tool, increasing the\ndetection capacity of a large number of respiratory pathogens. Moreover, this type of\ntechnique can contribute to the correct indication of antiviral medications, can avoid\nunnecessary use of antibiotics and can promote the adoption of appropriate\nhospital-control measures.\n\nThe findings of this study show that the application of PCR assays in a real-time\nmultiplex format for respiratory pathogens considerably increases the pathogen detection\nrate when compared to conventional methods, highlighting the role of influenza virus in\nARI cases in patients of all ages, in addition to reporting the circulation of recently\ndescribed respiratory viruses (Inf A H1N1 pdm09, hMPV, HBoV, HCoV-NL63 and\nHCoV-HKU1)."}
