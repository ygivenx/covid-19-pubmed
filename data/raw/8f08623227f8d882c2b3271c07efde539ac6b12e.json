{"title": "Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia Anesthesia Management and Perioperative Infection Control in Patients with the Novel Coronavirus", "body": "Conflicting Interest (If present, give more details): None Acknowledgement: None\n\nThe World Health Organization has declared a pandemic with over 120,000 people diagnosed with novel coronavirus and at least 4,200 deaths due to complications of infection (1) . The COVID-19 is a zoonosis; a virus that originates in animals but mutated to infect humans (2) . Examples of other zoonoses are Ebola, Human Immunodeficiency Disease and Salmonellosis (3) (4) (5) (6) . The COVID-19 shares similarities to other coronavirus types that cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (7, 8) .\n\nIn December 2019, the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China became the epicenter of a pneumonia outbreak. It was not until January 7, 2020 that investigators for the World Health Organization identified the infectious agent as a novel coronavirus [9, 10] . The COVID-19 is now a global threat with a high rate of infectivity and mortality rate of at least 2% [10] [11] [12] . The median age of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia is 59 years. Children under 15 years of age are relatively spared and have either lower infection rates, less symptoms or both.\n\nWhile estimated mortality rates are less than that for SARS and MERS, the degree of spread is greater (1, 13, 14) . This raises global concerns that a greater total number of patients will die from the disease. Disease spread is increased by a relatively long asymptomatic period which ranges from 8-15 days but may be up to 24 days (15, 16) . Health care workers are a major route of transmission similar to the related viruses that causes SARS and MERS (17) . The expected number of secondary cases arising from one infected individual are approximately 2-3 people at a minimum (16) .\n\nAnesthesiologists are at increased risk of exposure during perioperative management through direct contact, especially tracheal intubation. Transmission can occur from asymptomatic infected individuals. Therefore, healthcare workers should consider all patients as a possible source of infection unless proven otherwise. This is particularly true for anesthesiologists who are commonly in close contact with patients and come into contact with airway aerosols and secretions.\n\nSigns and symptoms of COVID-19 infection are fever in 83-98%, dry cough in 76-82% and fatigue or myalgia in 11-44% of patients (18) . The infection progresses rapidly in some patients, with approximately 10% of hospitalized patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure, suffer a high mortality rate.\n\nThe radiographic imaging during the early stages of infection shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes in the peripheral lung field (19). As pneumonia progresses there are bilateral and multiple ground-glass images and infiltrates with pulmonary consolidation. These changes are accompanied by a normal or decreased peripheral white blood count with a reduction in lymphocytes. The number of visitors and distance between beds in the preoperative areas should be based on current recommendations made by the Centers for Disease Center for social distancing. The latter is defined as reducing the number of people in common areas and trying to maintain a distance of (approximately 6 feet) between individuals when possible (20) . All health care providers and visitors should practice handwashing when entering, touching and leaving the pre and postoperative areas of care. Our approach uses a protocol in the perioperative care areas that segregates patients into three simple and distinct groups based on the risk of transmission.\n\nClass I patients are those who have been shown to be negative for novel coronavirus pneumonia after screening with RT-PCR, symptoms, lab exams and imaging. Grade 1 protection is recommended: \u2460 and includes disposable surgical cap and surgical garments; \u2461 disposable gloves; \u2462 surgical mask; \u2463 Protective goggles are recommended along with sterilized surgical gowns during tracheal intubation.\n\nClass \u2161 patients: have negative screening tests but have fever or lung imaging suggestive of COVID-19 changes. These patients are considered potentially infective.\n\nGrade 2 protection is recommended for healthcare providers and includes: \u2460 disposable surgical cap, and disposable impermeable surgical gown (isolation gown);\n\n\u2461 protective goggles or headshield, disposable gloves; \u2462 medical surgical mask, medical N95 mask and; \u2463 disposable shoe covers.\n\nClass III patients are those who \u2460 need emergency surgery prior to screening for novel coronavirus pneumonia; \u2461 suspected or confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, who requires emergency surgery and cannot be transferred to a designated COVID-19 hospital. Grade 3 protection is recommended and includes: \u2460 disposable surgical cap, scrubs, disposable impermeable surgical gown (isolation gown); \u2461 protective goggles and headshield, double-layer disposable latex gloves; \u2462 medical N95 masks; a positive pressure headgear is recommended for tracheal intubation and;\n\n\u2463 disposable boot-cover. Anesthesia staff should try to review the history, laboratory results and imaging before engaging in care including intubation or resuscitation to determine the degree of protection needed.\n\nPre and post-operative areas and the operating room are busy care sites. All these sites require healthcare providers from a number of different specialties. This leads to a greater amount of human traffic through these care sites and can result in a greater than average number of potentially exposed personnel due to cross-contamination. The latter can lead to epidemic infection in the hospital. The authors therefore recommend that surgeons, anesthesiologists and infectious disease experts form a cohesive team to conduct the three-level evaluation system described above. The current best practices used in the People's Republic of China consist of the seven diagnostic criteria (epidemiological history, cluster incidence, fever, respiratory symptoms, complete blood count, nucleic acid test, and or serological antibody test) (see Figure 2 ). \n\nIndication and contraindications to general anesthesia and regional anesthesia do not differ in most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, platelet counts and should be checked in patients with advanced or systemic COVID-19 due to possible complicating thrombocytopenia which may preclude regional anesthesia. For patients with confirmed or suspected novel coronavirus pneumonia, minimizing exposure to airway aerosols, droplets and fluids especially during coughing can reduce contamination. Intrathecal anesthesia is still recommended as the major anesthesia method for patients undergoing cesarean section, and patients should wear medical protective masks to reduce cross infection by aerosol or droplet.\n\nRapid induction with expedient intubation is recommended to reduce aerosolized spread of viral particles. Video-laryngoscope with a disposable blade works well with a transparent plastic cover to protect the screen and handle. Clearly designated disposal sites for airway equipment that are contaminated can help reduce exposure. Placing a wet gauze on the patient's mouth and nose during positive pressure ventilation reduces droplet dispersion. A full dose of muscle relaxant should be injected at one time and tracheal intubation performed only when muscle relaxants are fully active to prevent coughing. Healthcare providers may want to consider the risks and benefits of giving opioid analgesics prior to induction of general anesthesia since they can lead to significant coughing (21) . Heat and moisture exchanging filters are recommended on both the inspiration port and the aspiration port of the respiratory circuit and should be replaced every 3 to 4 hours. There is evidence that filters can effectively reduce contamination of the anesthesia machine with pathogens including bacteria or viruses.\n\nHowever, use of filters has also been associated with increased airway pressures and auto PEEP which can increase the risk of pulmonary barotrauma (22) . Care must be given to the placement of the scavenging outlet since low flow circuits with filters may not eliminate all pathogens. Medical staff should change gloves after touching the patient's secretion, making sure not to contaminate items in the operating room.\n\nExtubation and anesthesia recovery Extubation should be performed to minimize aerosol spread through coughing.\n\nAnesthesia care providers have a number of options to help accomplish this goal.\n\nThese include deep extubation in the appropriate patients or use of analgesic narcotics to facilitate a smooth extubation. Laryngeal mask airways provide a relatively smoother emergence in many patients and can be used in appropriate circumstances. The goal is to adapt the anesthesia plan to reduce aerosol and droplet exposure. Patients who are positive for COVID-19 or whose status is unknown should be sent to a negative pressure isolation area after surgery. Patients who still need artificial ventilation after the operation should be transferred to an isolation unit in the ICU with a special transfer bed and ventilator by well protected and trained staff.\n\nFollowing surgery, all disposable items should be discarded and packed in well-marked medical hazard waste bags which are labelled clearly as coronavirus pneumonia infected materials and disposed of by a person who has received COVID-19 training.\n\nSome equipment such as fiberoptic bronchoscopes, rigid bronchoscopes and nerve stimulators must be fully decontaminated using local disinfection standards. After decontamination, all instruments require inspection by a hospital infection control agent l before use in another case. All anesthesia machines used in infected patients or those with unknown status should be treated using disinfection standards established for communicable fungi, viruses and vegetative bacteria (23) .\n\nThere are commercial sterilization packages available for anesthetic machines. Different brands or models of anesthesia machines may require specific procedures (24) (25) (26) . All aim to disinfect the internal breathing circuit by distributing agents such as ethylene oxide, peracetic acid vaporized hydrogen peroxide or glutaraldehyde to kill residual pathogenic agents such as COVID-19.\n\nAll hospitals should ensure that the contents of portable airway kits are complete and ready for transport to an emergency. Referring healthcare providers should try to provide the airway team with an update on the patient's medical history and infectious status especially in regard to COVID-19. This will allow the emergency airway team to choose appropriate protective equipment based upon a rapid assessment of transmission risk. For example, providers can chose first, second or third level protection for class I, class II and class III patients respectively. When there is insufficient information to determine the relative risk all patients should be treated as infected and capable of rapid transmission (Class III).\n\nMaximum measures to prevent transmission should be used when patients have any symptoms consistent with a diagnosis including fever/cough or radiological imaging suggestive of COVID-19. Anesthesia teams need prior training to understand how the wards are organized to minimize transmission of pathogens by persons entering and leaving the area. In teaching centers, intubation of patients out of the operating room by more experienced staff may reduce risk of transmission under emergency conditions. Designation of a well-coordinated emergency airway team can reduce potential transmission by working together as a coordinated unit to assemble materials, assist with intubation and dispose of contaminated materials. Portable airway kits should be left in the buffer zone during intubation and subsequently thoroughly disinfected or disposed of.\n\nAnesthesiologists are at high risk of infection with COVID-19 during perioperative care and as first responders to airway emergencies. The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk. The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross contamination to other patients and staff. We present a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into one of three risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques. Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources. Educating medical staff about proper use of high risk areas for containment serves to protect staff and patients. "}
