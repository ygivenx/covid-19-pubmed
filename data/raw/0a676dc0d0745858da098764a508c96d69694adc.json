{"title": "Degradation of iopromide by combined UV irradiation and peroxydisulfate", "body": "There is much interest currently in the occurrence and control of pharmaceutical contaminants in the aqueous environment. One specific group of compounds, iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM), has become the focus of environmental concern due to the presence of these compounds in wastewaters and potential contamination of, and harm to, the aquatic environment. As halogenated compounds, they are the main contributors to the burden of total adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) in clinical wastewater [1] and several ICM compounds have been measured at relatively high concentrations (>1 g L \u22121 ) in many aqueous environments, including water treatment plant effluents, groundwaters, creeks, rivers, and drinking water [2] . At present, it is unclear whether ICM compounds themselves at the concentrations likely to be present pose a significant risk to human health, but iopromide has been shown recently to have estrogen activity [3] . There is also concern about the ecotoxicity of metabolite/transformation products of ICM, whose presence in environmental waters is suspected [4] .\n\nThe ICM compounds are derivatives of 2,4,6-tri-iodobenzoic acid possessing polar carboxylic and hydroxyl moieties in their branch chains. Most ICM compounds are non-ionic, such as iopromide, while others are ionic ICM compounds, such as diatrizoate. As a consequence of their physico-chemical nature, they are recalcitrant, and conventional municipal treatment plants are not able to remove them effectively from influent wastewaters [2, 4] . In view of this it may be necessary for water utilities to employ an advanced oxidation process (AOP) to control these contaminants.\n\nWhile some recent studies have reported on the degradation of iopromide by UV photolysis [5] , ozone [6] and ozone-sonolysis AOP [7] , previous research by the authors [16] has identified the combination of UV irradiation and peroxydisulphate as another potential AOP for the effective treatment of ICM compounds. Peroxydisulphate (S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ion) is a strong oxidant (E \u2022 = 2.05 V) which has been used widely in the petroleum industry for the treatment of hydraulic fluids or as a reaction initiator [8] . The peroxydisulfate is normally available as a salt associated with ammonium, sodium or potassium. Potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) recently was shown to be an effective disinfectant and/or oxidant for the Norwalk virus, foot-and-mouth disease and Coronaviridae (causing severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS) [9] . It has also been reported to be effective for degrading organics in hazardous wastewaters in acidic or basic media through direct chemical oxidation [8] , where peroxydisulfate is used as a sacrificial reagent [10] . However, since the reactions of peroxydisulfate are generally slow at normal temper- atures, the thermal or photochemical activated decomposition of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ion to SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical has been proposed as a method of accelerating the process [11] , as summarised in the following reactions (Eqs. (1)-(5)):\n\nIn the oxidation process, sulfate ions will be generated as the end-product [12] , which leads to a decrease in pH and an increase in salt content in the effluent. The SO 4 2\u2212 is practically inert and is not considered to be a pollutant; the USEPA has listed it under the secondary drinking water standards with a maximum concentration of 250 mg/L (1.43 mM), based on aesthetic reasons [13] . Theoretically, sulfate ion can be regenerated electrolytically to peroxydisulfate for reuse in water as shown by Balazs et al. [14] . Since peroxydisulfate will start reacting exothermally only at 100 \u2022 C [15] , it is not recommended for use in conventional water purification processes. The potential use of photo-activated peroxydisulfate at ambient temperature is of interest and has been investigated as a treatment method for the endocrine disruptor chemical, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) [16] . At neutral pH, photo-activated (UV 254 ) peroxydisulfate achieved a complete degradation of 2 mM BHA within 5 min, and a complete mineralisation within 45 min.\n\nThis study has been undertaken to investigate the degradation behaviour of iopromide, as a representative non-ionic ICM compound, with photo-activated potassium peroxydisulfate under various conditions of UV 254 light intensity, reactant concentrations, and solution pH. The study has considered the influence of each of these factors and has determined approximate values for the reaction rate constants.\n\nAll solutions were prepared using 18 M deionized distilled water produced from a NANO pure water treatment system (Specbiochrom, Milli-Q, LibraS12). All chemicals and solvents were HPLC grade, and they were used without further purification. Potassium peroxydisulfate (K 2 S 2 O 8 , KPS) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich at a purity of 99.5% and highly purified iopromide was purchased from Schering AG (Berlin, Germany). The chemical structure of iopromide (C 18 H 24 I 3 N 3 O 8 ) is shown in Fig. 1 , and its IUPAC name is as follows: 1-N,3-N-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo-5-[(2methoxyacetyl)amino]-3-N-methylbenzene-1,3-dicarboxamide. From the results of liquid chromatography the iopromide, as supplied, was present in the form of two isomers; Schulz et al. [17] and Putschew et al. [18] also observed two identical main peaks for iopromide in their studies indicating the presence of structural isomers. The chemical structure of the isomers was not established in this study, and all tests were carried out with both isomers present. For pH adjustment, 0.1 M sulphuric acid and 0.1 M sodium hydroxide were used. The probe compound (iopromide) and standard solutions were stored in a refrigerator prior to use.\n\nPhotodegradation experiments were carried out in a 300 mL (56 mm i.d. \u00d7 130 mm H) quartz beaker with magnetic stirring, where 250 mL of the test solution was placed in the centric of the UV photoreactor, Rayonet TM RPR-200 (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.). The reactor was equipped with two to six phosphor-coated low-pressure mercury lamps (approximately 35 W each), emitting 253.7 nm monochromatic UV at a light intensity of 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Einstein L \u22121 s \u22121 per lamp. Unless otherwise stated, reactions were carried out with 0.126 mM (\u223c100 mg L \u22121 ) iopromide and 2 mM KPS in blank solutions with the requisite amount of H 2 SO 4 or NaOH for the desired initial pH. To terminate the reaction, samples were mixed with an excess of sodium azide (1 mM) prior to the quantification of the probe compound and TOC. In general, the initial concentration ranges for iopromide (0.076-0.506 mM), KSP (0.4-20 mM) and the pH (2.6-11), were selected to monitor accurately the chemical reactions, ensure a reasonable reaction time (within 30-60 min), and examine a wide range of reaction kinetics for both academic and practical purposes.\n\nAnalysis of iopromide concentration was performed by HPLC (Waters 515 HPLC pump), connected to a Waters 2487 dualwavelength absorbance detector. Chromatographic separation was carried out by a reverse phase column (5 m C 18 , 250 mm long \u00d7 4.66 mm i.d., Alltech Econosphere) with a 5% (v/v) acetonitrile (99.9% purity) mobile phase, adjusted to pH 2.8 with formic acid. The flow of the mobile phase was adjusted by HPLC pump (model 426, Alltech, IL) to 1 mL min \u22121 , and the UV detector wavelength was set at 238 nm. The chromatographic conditions provided a relatively long compound retention time (12-14 min) to ensure a satisfactory resolution of the two iopromide isomers. Solution TOC was determined using a Shimadzu TOC-5000A analyzer with an ASI-5000A autosampler. All experiments were carried out in an air-conditioned room temperature of 23 \u00b1 2 \u2022 C.\n\nThe degradation kinetics of one of the two iopromide isomers (isomer 1) is shown in Fig. 2 with different light intensities (number of UV 254 lamps) at an initial pH value of 3.5. As expected, the rate of compound degradation increased systematically with light intensity, and an overall degradation of 90% was achieved in 30 min for both isomers under a light intensity of 6 lamps (\u22489 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Einstein L \u22121 s \u22121 ). The degradation kinetics were found to be approximately first-order (viz. ln C \u2212 ln C 0 = \u2212kt), and the first-order rate constant was linearly related to the light intensity (number of lamps), as shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that there was a noticeable difference in reactivity between the two isomers, with the reaction rate of isomer 2 significantly greater than isomer 1. The linear relationship between the rate constant and the light intensity can be explained by the effects of both direct photolysis and SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical reactions. For direct photolysis, the compound degradation rate, k P (s \u22121 ), can be shown to be directly proportional to the light intensity as follows [19] :\n\nwhere\u02dais the quantum yield (mol Einstein \u22121 ), I is the intensity of the incident light at 253.7 nm (Einstein L \u22121 s \u22121 ), \u03b5 is the compound molar absorptivity at 253.7 nm (L mol \u22121 cm \u22121 ), and l is the light reactions is discussed in the next section.\n\nIn theory, the kinetics of the iopromide degradation may be described as a combination of direct photolysis and chemical reactions between iopromide and KPS and SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radicals. The overall Fig. 3 . Variation of first-order rate constants for the degradation of iopromide with UV light intensity. reaction rate may be expressed as follows:\n\nwhere (7) it can be seen that if the value of the exponent 'q' can be assumed to be unity, then the equation describes a first-order reaction for the temporal change of C Iop (assuming all other reaction conditions are constant); whereupon after integration, the variation of C Iop is given by the linear relationship: ln(C 0 /C) = kt. The results of the tests for isomer 1 for each initial iopromide concentration (C 0 ) can be seen in Fig. 4 , where the value of ln(C 0 /C) is plotted versus time. It can be seen that in each case the first-order model fitted the results closely, within experimental error, and thus the value of the exponent 'q' can be assumed to be one. Therefore, Eq. (7) can be simplified as:\n\nThe \n\nThe value of\u02daS 2 O 8 has been determined to be 0.52 [20] , and (\u03b5 ) S 2 O 8 has been reported as 24.1 L mol \u22121 cm \u22121 [21] . The consump- tion of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radicals is assumed to be predominantly through reaction with water molecules leading to a reduction in solution pH (as observed in this study), as follows:\n\nThe rate constant for this reaction (Eq. (10)), k W , has been reported to lie in the range of 360-<1000 s \u22121 [20] . \n\nA second series of tests were undertaken in which the initial concentration of iopromide was kept constant (0.126 mM), and the initial KPS concentration varied in the range, 0.4-20 mM, whilst under a constant UV irradiation intensity (4 lamps). The results of the tests indicated that the iopromide degradation rate increased with KPS concentration. The form of the relationship was found to be semi-logarithmic, as shown in Fig. 5 By comparing Eqs. (13) and (14), it can be deduced that the value of the exponents r and p, are 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the overall degradation rate equation can be written as:\n\nBy using the values of g, (gh) and (gh/2) obtained from the experiments (shown in Fig. 5 ) and assuming k W = 600 \u00b1 200 s \u22121 , the corresponding values for k SO 4 and k KPS were determined as follows: is \u223c2 s \u22121 , assuming a 1:1 molar stoichiometry, which is consistent with the assumption made in this analysis that these reactions are negligible compared to those with water (cf. k W = 600 \u00b1 200 s \u22121 ). The values of k SO 4 are relatively low which may reflect the recalcitrance of the iopromide molecular structure and the discriminating nature of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical reactions, involving electron transfer, addition or hydrogen abstraction [20] . Similar values have been reported for SO 4 \u2212\u2022 reaction with acetic acid (1.4-20 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 ; [20] ), which is another compound generally resistant to oxidation. Previously, it was observed that under otherwise constant conditions the iopromide degradation rate was linearly related to the UV irradiation intensity (Fig. 3) . By reference to Eq. (15), it can be seen that both k P and k terms incorporate the UV intensity, I , and thus the overall first-order degradation rate of iopromide is directly proportional to the UV intensity, which is consistent with the test results (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe influence of initial solution pH on the reaction was investigated with a UV intensity of 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Einstein L \u22121 s \u22121 (4 lamps) and pH values of 2.6, 3.5, 5.7, 8.0, 9.0 and 11.0. At each pH the reaction kinetics were observed and the pseudo first-order reaction rate constant was determined. The relationship between the rate constants and pH is shown in Fig. 6 for the two iopromide isomers. It can be seen that the rate constant was not substantially affected by pH, but generally decreased with increasing pH. The decrease was <8% with increasing pH for the initial pH range of 3-8, but was greater between pH 9 and 11 (22-29%) . At pH 11, the iopromide degradation rate was close to the theoretical rate for direct photolysis alone (0.038 min \u22121 ), indicating a high degree of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical scavenging under such conditions. The following are possible scavenging reactions responsible for this [20] :\n\nCriquet and Karpel Vel Leitner [20] also reported a decrease in reaction rate with pH for acetic acid degradation by UV/KPS between pH 5 and 11, citing the reaction between the sulphate radical and OH as the principal cause. At very low pH (\u223c<4) the slightly greater iopromide degradation rate may be due to significant complementary, indirect reactions with OH \u2022 radicals arising from the scavenging of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 (Eq. (10)). Such indirect reactions could be very rapid since Ning and Graham [6] have reported an iopromide/OH \u2022 radical rate constant of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M \u22121 s \u22121 .\n\nIt was observed that with each degradation reaction there was a decrease in solution pH with time. These changes are illustrated in Fig. 7a and b. In Fig. 7a , the influence of KPS concentration is shown whereby the decrease in solution pH increased systematically with KPS concentration for the initial period (0-5 min). This is consistent with the direct relationship between sulfate radical generation and KPS concentration, as represented by Eq. (9), thereby leading to increasing H + ions being generated as a consequence of aqueous SO 4 \u2212\u2022 scavenging (Eq. (10)). After the initial period, the further decrease in pH with time was relatively gradual and similar for all the KPS concentrations. It seems reasonable to speculate that in the initial reaction period (0-5 min), substantial degradation of iopromide occurs leading to intermediate products, some of which may behave as weak organic acids leading to the buffering of solution pH, both during the initial period and subsequently. Similarly, the results shown in Fig. 7b , for the same specific oxidation conditions (4 lamps, 0.126 mM iopromide, 2 mM KPS) but different initial pH values, show a reduction in solution pH with time corresponding to approximately equivalent H + production as a result of the scavenging of sulfate radicals. Although no investigation of reaction products was carried out in this study, there were clear indications that substantial quantities of reaction intermediates were formed. Changes in iopromide concentration and solution TOC (total organic carbon) can be seen in Fig. 8 , which demonstrated that there was very little loss of TOC (conversion to CO 2 -'mineralisation') in the early stages of the reactions (<10 min) where the corresponding degradation of iopromide was substantial. Continuation of the oxidation conditions beyond the point of full iopromide degradation leads to near-complete mineralisation of the reaction products (i.e. loss of solution TOC) after approximately 70-80 min. In general, little work has been reported on the degradation mechanisms of ICM compounds, but one recent study has indicated that oxidation by OH \u2022 radicals of iomeprol lead to the conversion of hydroxyl moieties on the compound side chains by hydrogen abstraction to aldehyde or ketone groups [22] ; similar products have been reported for iopromide undergoing biodegradation [23] . In contrast, Ning and Graham [6] observed in ozone reactions with ICM compounds the release of iodine during the period of compound degradation, suggesting cleavage of the iodine-carbon bond on the aromatic ring. Further work is required to investigate the degradation mechanisms for iopromide in the UV/KPS system, and the pathways arising from direct photolysis and sulphate radical reaction.\n\nThe aqueous degradation behaviour of iopromide, as a representative non-ionic ICM compound, in the presence of photo-activated potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) has been studied under various conditions of UV 254 light intensity, reactant concentrations, and solution pH. As iopromide has been found to be a recalcitrant environmental contaminant, the application of advanced oxidation processes to wastewaters containing ICM compounds represents the most viable method of treatment. The results of laboratory experiments with photo-activated KPS have shown that under specific conditions complete removal of iopromide was achieved within 30 min, and near-complete mineralisation within 80 min. The mechanisms of degradation are believed to involve a combination of direct photolysis, sulphate radical attack, and, to a minor degree, direct oxidation by peroxydisulfate. Approximate values for the reaction rate constants have been determined and found to be equal to 1-2 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 for sulfate radicals, and 1-2 M \u22122 s \u22121 for direct reactions with KPS (S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ). The rate constants appear to be relatively low compared to published values for sulphate radical reactions with other organic substrates, but this is believed to be due to the discriminating nature of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical reactions, involving electron transfer, addition or hydrogen abstraction, and the recalcitrant nature of the iopromide molecule. Overall compound degradation was observed to follow first-order kinetics where the rate constant decreased with initial solution pH. During the reaction the pH of the solution was observed to decrease with time, which was believed to be the consequence of sulfate radical scavenging."}
