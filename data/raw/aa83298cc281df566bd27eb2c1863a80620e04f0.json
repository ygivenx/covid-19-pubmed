{"title": "Distinct cellular functions mediated by haemopoietic cell-surface proteases", "body": "The presence of proteolytic activities on cellular surfaces initiates a variety of essential biological responses. Likewise, haemopoietic cell-surface proteases appear to have multiple effects in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Protein turnover, ontogeny, inflammation, cell migration and tissue invasion are among the many systems which depend upon cellsurface protease control mechanisms.\n\nIt is possible to discern two classes of enzymes at the surface of haemopoietic cells: the cell-associated protease family and the integral protease family. The cellassociated proteases are bound to the membrane either through ionic interactions or specific binding sites and they include serine elastase, cathepsin G and the plasminogen activators (PAs). The integral proteases are transmembrane type I or type II molecules and they include a growing number of members with various and partly overlapping specificities.\n\nThe structural features and degradative properties of these two classes of haemopoietic cell-surface proteases are summarized in this review. Recently, there has been an increase in the information available about extended functions of ectoproteases and we have tried to provide some insight into the way haemopoietic cell-surface proteases, through multifunctional mechanisms, may influence physiological and pathological events.\n\nAs summarized in Table 1 , some wellcharacterized proteases are present on the surface of haemopoietic cells. Although initially described as being found in granulocytes, monocytes and alveolar macrophages, serine elastase and cathepsin G are also present on promonocytic cells (Maison et al., 1991; Villiers and Bauvois, unpublished results) . Both proteases are the primary enzymes responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation (reviewed in Janusz and Doherty, 1991) . Alpha l-protease inhibitor (c~l-PI) synthesized by myeloid cells blocks the activity of both elastase and cathepsin G (Remold O'Donnell et al., 1989) and the complex formed following the interaction of ~I-PI with elastase is chemoattractant for granulocytes (Banda et al., 1988) . Monocytes/macrophages synthesize both urokinase [u-PA] and tissue plasminogen activator [t-PAl as well as inhibitors of plasminogen activators (Vassalli et al., 1984; Chapman and Stone, 1985; Hart et al., 1989) . In addition, monocytes, macrophages and monocytic cell lines express both u-PA and plasminogen receptors and several agonists, including interferon-gamma (IFN-7), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-o 0 and urokinase itself, have the capacity to modulate the expression of u-PA receptors (Kirchheimer et al., 1988; Felez et al., 1990) . PAs are chemotactic for granulocytes in vivo (Boyle et al., 1987) and they catalyze the proteolytic remodelling and such physiological processes as inflammation and metastasis. Secreted u-PA does not significantly contribute to the invasive process unless it is receptor-bound and cell-surface-associated (Ossowski, 1988) . Moreover, the receptor for u-PA polarizes expression of the protease to the leading edge of migrating monocytes suggesting that this receptor is a key determinant in the control of u-PA-catalysed extracellular proteolysis (Estreicher et al., 1990) . CD10 antigen [CALLA (common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen)] is a type II integral membrane protein that is identical to neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) (Letarte et al., 1988) . Originally identified as associated with 80% of cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with a pre-B cell phenotype, CD10/NEP is now identified on B lymphocyte progenitors in bone marrow and foetal liver, suggesting it may play a role in the early stages of B cell development. It is also found on culture bone marrow stromal cells, mature granulocytes and Jurkat T cells (reviewed in Bowes and Kenny, 1987; Kee et al., 1992; Marl et al., 1992) as well as in a large number of nonhaemopoietic tissues. CD10/NEP is a zinc-containing endopeptidase which can hydrolyze numerous small biological peptides such as enkephalins, endothelins, substance P, bradykinin, the pleiotropic cytokines IL-l[3 and IL-6 (reviewed in Turner et al., 1985; Bauvois et al., 19911) . NEP, present on the surface of granulocytes cleaves the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (f-M-L-P), suggesting that this enzyme can modulate chemotactic responses (Painter et al., 1988) . CD13/aminopeptidase-N (AP-N, EC 3.4.11.2) is a zinccontaining exopeptidase expressed by acute B lymphoid and myeloid leukaemic cells and cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage at all stages of differentiation (Look et al., 1989; reviewed in Bauvois et al., 1991; Naquet and Pierres, 1991) . Although CD13 specific antibodies do not bind normal B and T cells, an aminopeptidase-N activity which is enhanced upon mitogenic stimulation, is described on human T lymphocytes and differentiating murine thymocytes (Amos-cato et al., 1989; Bauvois, 1990) . As for CD10, the natural substrates for CD13/AP-N appear to be regulatory peptides including enkephalins and other opioid peptides (reviewed in Turner et al., 1985; Checler, 1991) . Both CD10/NEP and CD13/AP-N are found to be increased on myeloid cells stimulated with C5a in vitro or obtained from patients undergoing activation of C during haemodialysis (Werfel et al., 1991) . CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV, EC 3.4.14.5) is a type II serine protease widely distributed in mammalian tissues and in the immune system is expressed by activated B cells, cells of T and granulocytemacrophage lineages (Sch6n et al., 1987; Bauvois et al., 1992; Laouar et al., 1993; Bristol et al., 1992) . By removing dipeptides of the X-Pro-type from peptides and proteins, DPP IV is involved in the processing of bioactive peptide precursors including cecropins and melittin (Kreil et al., 1980; Boman et al., 1989) as well as in the degradation of bioactive peptides ([3-casomorphin, substance P and growth hormone-releasing factor) (Bongers et al., 1992) and denatured collagen I (Bauvois et al., 1991) . In our laboratory, we have recently shown that DPP IV of U937 cells participates in the degradation and inactivation of TNF-o~ . Dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase A (ACE or angiotensin converting enzyme, kininase II, EC 3.4.15.1) is a widely distributed membrane-bound metallopeptidase present on pre-B derived leukaemia cells and cells of T and monocyte-macrophage lineages (reviewed in Checler, 1991; Costerousse et al., 1993) . ACE inactivates enkephalins, substance P and bradykinin and converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II (reviewed in Checler, 1991) . Inside the haemopoietic system, aminopeptidase A (AP-A) is expressed on a subpopulation of cortical thymic epithelial cells and on pre-B and immature B lineage cells (Witlock et al., 1987; Wu et al., 1991) . Such selective expression on pre-B lymphocytes may reflect a requirement for these cells to hydrolyze (a) regulatory peptide(s) at the stage of lymphopoiesis. Outside the haemopoietic system, AP-A can degrade angiotensins I and II. Moreover, IL-7 preferentially induces AP-A expression together with pre-B cell proliferation (Wu et al., 1991) .\n\nA few other cell-surface proteases have been less thoroughly characterized. Among them, a trypsin-like serine protease (TSP-1) on effector T cells is capable of cleaving casein and releasing high-molecular weight products from sulphated proteoglycans (Kramer and Simon, 1987) . A membrane-bound arginine-specific serine enzyme detected on B routine spleen cells is synthesized to a higher level following mitogenic stimulation (Ku et al., 1983) . Human lymphoid T and B cells possess a trypsin-like protease and a neutral endopeptidase on their surface that both participate in the degradation of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) released by eosinophils and are shown to inhibit the proliferative responses for murine lymphocytes to mitogens (Goetzl et al., 1989) . A neutral serine protease on activated neutrophils may be in part responsible for cytolysis of target cells (Pontremoli et al., 1986) . Finally, the low affinity IgE receptor FceRII/CD23 present on B cells and inducible on monocytes and T cells could be cleaved according to an autocatalytic mechanism (Letellier et al., 1989) .\n\nIt is readily apparent from Table 1 that the scope of haemopoietic cell-surface proteases is remarkable. This diversity encompasses virtually all types of peptides and proteins grouped by functional criteria. Most of the proteins listed include pleiotropic cytokines (IL-113, IL-6 and TNF-o~), vasodilatory peptides (VIP and substance P) and neuroendocrine hormones such as endor-phins, enkephalins, somatostatin and angiotensin, all implicated in many functions of the immune system and the inflammatory responses (Lotz et al., 1988; Metcalf, 1989; Gijbels and Billiau, 1992; Van Den Bergh et al., 1992) . Likewise, immunoregulatory properties of substance P (SP) after interaction with specific SP receptors include in vitro stimulation of T cell proliferation, the augmentation of Ig synthesis, macrophage and neutrophil activation and the modulation of lymphocyte traffic (reviewed in Calvo et al., 1992) . As seen in Table 1 , there is therefore much interest in the role of cell-surface proteases such as NEP, ACE and DPP IV in inactivating SP.\n\nMany integral membrane proteins lead to a dual existence as both membrane-bound and soluble isoforms (Ehlers and Riordan, 1991) . Such a proteolytic mechanism leads to the release of a large variety of proteins, including growth factors and cytokines (TGF-o~, TNF-c~, CSF-] (colony stimulating factor), EGF (epidermal growth factor) and S-CGF (stem cell growth factor), growth factor and cytokine receptors (TNF-c~, NGF (nerve growth factor), CSF-1, IL-1, IL-2 and IFN-~/), leukocyte antigens (FcRIII/CD16, FcRII/CD23, CD8, Mel14) and ectoenzymes themselves (cholinesterase, sialyltransferase/CD75, NEP, DPP IV, AP-N and ACE). An endogenous EDTAsensitive membrane-associated protease from pig kidney has been shown to release ACE in a soluble form (Hooper et al., 1987) . This example lends support to the concept that the proteolytic release of membrane proteins can be a specific event regulated by cell-surface proteases themselves.\n\nBesides the CD3/TCR complex which activates T cells and leads to the biological expression of the T cell functional programme, other non-TCR structures including CD2, CD4, CD8, CD28, Thy-1, LFA-1, CD49d/CD29 (VLA-4), CD49e/CD29 (VLA-5) can induce or modulate cell activation. Recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the human CD26/DPP IV have been shown to co-stimulate T cell proliferation, IL-2 secretion and cytoxicity (Fleisher, 1987; Dang et al., 1990 Dang et al., , 1991 Hegen et al., 1990) . In the mouse and in the rat, mAbs anti-CD26 have similar effects on immature and mature T cell proliferation (Naquet et al., 1989; Vivier et al., 1991; Bristol et al., 1992) . Moreover, mAb against rat CD26 can also mediate a co-stimulatory signal for granulocyte and macrophage colony formation (Bristol et al., 1992) .\n\nThere is current evidence that leukocyte integrins are signal transducers. Indeed, collagen-dependent CD4 T cell activation is found to involve the integrin VLA-3 (CD49c/CD29) but also a second collagen receptor represented by CD26/DPP IV, indicating that cell adhesion via two different families of antigens i.e. integrins and proteases can contribute to cell activation (Dang et al., 1990) .\n\nHow does CD26/DPP IV signal? The biochemical signals delivered by CD26 are distinct from signals derived from an increased intracellular calcium level (Bristol et al., 1992) but seem to require protein kinase C activation (Dang et al., 1990; Vivier et al., 1991; Bristol et al., 1992) . CD26 on human T cells is physically associated to CD45RO, one form of the tyrosine phosphatase leukocyte common antigen . Anti-CD26 mAb treatment down-modulates both CD26 and CD45RO expression and results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins critical in T cell activation i.e. the TCR~ chain and p561ok kinase . Likewise, similar activation signal transducing properties are now reported with two other cell-surface proteases CD13/AP-N and CD10/NEP. Anti-CD13 mAb is shown to inhibit rosette formation by neutrophils and erythrocyte-antibody complement (O'Connell et al., 1989) , whereas anti-CD10 mAb significantly decreased IL-2 production in activated Jurkat T cells (Mari et al., 1992) . Outside of the haemopoietic system, specific binding of enzymatically active uPA with its receptor is mitogenic in malignant cells (Kirchheimer et al., 1989) . Altogether, these results emphasize the emerging theme of signal transduction by haemopoietic cell-surface proteases.\n\nOther roles?\n\nOutside of the haemopoietic system, CD26/ DPP IV has been shown to have a binding affinity for collagen and fibronectin (Hanski et al., 1988; Bauvois, 1988; Piazza et al., 1989) and was strongly suggested to participate in adhesion of rat hepatocytes and murine fibroblasts to collagen (Hanski et al., 1988; Bauvois, 1988) . Since then, DPP IV on human T cells has been demonstrated to be a functional collagen receptor leading to cell activation (Dang et al., 1990) . Thus, ectoproteases can directly serve as cell adhesion molecules that further modulate intracellular activation signals. Figure 1 depicts a highly speculative hypothesis regarding the potential role of ectoproteases such as DPP IV in regulation of haemopoietic cell adhesion: in a first step, cells may contact the ECM protein (fibronectin/collagen) via specific cell-surface proteases and resulting adhesion could result in signal transduction and cell activation. In a second step, activated cells no longer could bind to ECM, consistent with the detachment of cells and concomitant degradation or not of ECM. Such flexibility provided by cell-surface proteases could be important in attachment and migration of haemopoietic cells occurring in various physiological (development) and pathological processes (inflammation, cancer). \n\nIt is known that viruses make use of cell-surface proteins as cellular receptors to enter and infect cells. Two recent reports provide strong evidence that epithelial cell CD13/AP-N serves as a receptor for at least two viruses i.e. TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and HCV-229E human coronavirus (Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992) . Interestingly, very recent data have reported that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can bind an integral type II protein which shares close homology with CD23/FcRII (Curtis et al., 1992) suggesting that non-CD4 HIV receptors with structural features of some integral proteases can be important in HIV infection.\n\nProteases are found to be strong catalysts for transpeptidation reactions (reviewed in Kasche, 1989) . Indeed, CD26/DPP IV in vitro expresses both peptidase and acyl transferase activity (Yoshimoto et al., 1978) . In our laboratory, we have recently shown that cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage degrade IL-6 into active 8 kDa peptides. Further inactivation involves formation of a 16 kDa complex due to dimerization of the 8 kDa-derived IL-6 peptides resulting from a peptidyl transferase-catalysed reaction occurring at the cell surface (Laouar et al., 1993) . Our data may explain the origin of high molecular weight IL-6 species (45-85 kDa) detected in human serum (May et al., 1991) .\n\nAs summarized here, the structural features of cell-surface proteases in the haemopoietic system are becoming well understood. What has become clear in the last few years is that haemopoietic cell-surface proteases are not simply proteolytic enzymes but they can be considered as receptors in the sense of transmitting signals both into and out of the cells.\n\nPrimary function of such enzymes is to activate/inactivate via degradation a variety of molecules including hormones, neuropeptides, cytokines and ECM proteins. Apart from their degradation role, the second major property of cell-surface proteases is their role as signal transducing molecules: (perhaps all) cell-surface proteases mediate information transfer into cells by acting as coreceptors with more traditional receptors. It is reasonable to propose that interaction of these enzymes with their biological substrate(s) can trigger signalling events. One of the unanswered questions is how proteases signal and a rapidly advancing area is presently the dissection of the molecular basis of signal transduction through proteases.\n\nStudies on the role of cell-surface proteases outside the haemopoietic system led to the surprising finding that enzymes such as DPP IV/CD26 may be receptors by which cells attach to ECM. This is an attractive model in which leukocytes via cell-surface proteases could exhibit combined adhesion and migration activities through lymphoid areas and peripheral tissues. This hypothesis will surely benefit from progress in studies of cell adhesion.\n\nA current speculation concerns cell-surface proteases and their contribution in the conversion of peptides and proteins. Further studies are needed to improve the 'planning' of efficient and selective cellsurface protease-catalyzed reactions in biological processes.\n\nThrough these activities above, there is emerging evidence that haemopoietic cellsurface proteases may play a dynamic role in development and in adult organisms by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, secretion, cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cell migration. Cell-surface proteases are subject to fine control such that their expression at any point in time is being regulated by a variety of factors including the immediate microenvironment (cytokines, ECM, inhibitors), the state of cell activation and maturation and in turn they can modulate cell functions.\n\nDefinitive evidence for the physiological relevance of a given action of a haemopoietic cell~surface protease requires tests in the intact organism. Obviously, such tests are difficult to carry out and an alternative strategy is the association of modified states of cell-surface proteases with diseases as diverse as thrombosis, inflammation and leukaemias. A number of pathologic conditions are already shown to be associated with up and/or down regulation of cell-surface proteases and they therefore may serve as independent diagnostic predictors. For example, the clinical course of pre-B and T acute lymphoid leukaemias are associated with high content of CD10/NEP (Foon and Todd, 1986 ). Both an increase or decrease in CD6/DPP IV activity has been used as a marker of lymphoid leukaemias (Scott et al., 1988) and HIV infections (De Pasquale et al., 1989) . Thus, the subsequent elucidation of the role(s) of these cell-surface enzymes on leukocytes that possess modified properties should contribute to our understanding of the multifunctional roles of cell-surface proteases.\n\nFinally, one intriguing question is how cell-surface protease molecules can contribute to the infectious process. As promising candidates for receptors of a large variety of mammalian viruses, they may represent a novel area for antiviral research and therapy.\n\nIn all of these aspects, we expect considerable progress in the next few years; however, haemopoietic cell-surface proteases already appear as flexible molecules with varied mechanisms directing a multiplicity of cell functions."}
