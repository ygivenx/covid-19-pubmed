{"title": "Lymphadenopathy and Diseases of the Spleen", "body": "Enlargement of tonsillar and inguinal lymph nodes is most likely secondary to localized infection; enlargement of supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes is more likely to be of a serious nature. Enlargement of the left supraclavicular node, in particular, should suggest a malignant disease (e.g., lymphoma or rhabdomyosarcoma) arising in the abdomen and spreading via the thoracic duct to the left supraclavicular area. Enlargement of the right supraclavicular node indicates intrathoracic lesions because this node drains the superior areas of the lungs and mediastinum. Palpable supraclavicular nodes are an indication for a thorough search for intrathoracic or intraabdominal pathology.\n\nLymphadenopathy is either localized (one region affected) or generalized (two or more noncontiguous lymph node regions involved). Although localized lymphadenopathy is generally due to local infection in the region drained by the particular lymph nodes, it may also be due to malignant disease, such as Hodgkin lymphoma or neuroblastoma. Generalized lymphadenopathy is caused by many disease processes. Lymphadenopathy may initially be localized and subsequently become generalized.\n\nNodes in excess of 2.5 cm should be regarded as pathologic. In addition, nodes that increase in size over time are significant.\n\nMalignant nodes are generally firm and rubbery. They are usually not tender or erythematous. Occasionally, a rapidly growing malignant node may be tender. Nodes due to infection or inflammation are generally warm, tender, and fluctuant. If infection is considered to be the cause of the adenopathy, it is reasonable to give a 2-week trial of antibiotics. If there is no reduction in the size of the lymph node within this period, careful observation of the lymph node is necessary. If the size, location, and character of the node suggest malignant disease, the node should be biopsied. Table 4 .2 outlines the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy. The following investigations should be carried out to elucidate the cause of either localized or generalized lymphadenopathy:\n\n\u2022 Thorough history of infection, contact with rodents or cats, and systemic complaints.\n\n\u2022 Careful examination of the lymphadenopathy including size, consistency, mobility, warmth, tenderness, erythema, fluctuation, and location. All the lymph-node-bearing areas as outlined above should be carefully examined. \u2022 Physical examination for evidence of hematologic disease, such as hepatosplenomegaly and petechiae.\n\n\u2022 Blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n\n\u2022 Skin testing for tuberculosis.\n\n\u2022 Bacteriologic culture of regional lesions (e.g., throat).\n\n\u2022 Specific serologic tests for Epstein\u00c0Barr virus (EBV), Bartonella henselae (IFA), syphilis (VDRL) toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tularemia, brucellosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis. \u2022 Chest radiograph and CT scan (if necessary); abdominal sonogram and CT, if indicated.\n\n\u2022 Ultrasonography is useful in an acute setting in assessing whether a swelling is nodal in origin, an infected cyst or other soft tissue mass. It may detect an abscess requiring drainage. \u2022 EKG and echocardiogram if Kawasaki disease is suspected.\n\n\u2022 Lymph node aspiration and culture; helpful in isolating the causative organism and deciding on an appropriate antibiotic when infection is the cause of the lymphadenopathy. \u2022 Fine needle aspiration; may yield a definite or preliminary cytologic diagnosis and occasionally obviate the need for lymph node biopsy. It provides limited material in the event flow cytometry is required and negative results cannot rule out a malignancy because the sample may be inadequate.\n\n\u2022 Bone marrow examination if leukemia or lymphoma is suspected.\n\n\u2022 Lymph node biopsy is indicated if:\n\n\u2022 Initial physical examination and history suggest malignancy.\n\n\u2022 Lymph node size is greater than 2.5 cm in absence of signs of infection.\n\n\u2022 Lymph node persists or enlarges.\n\n\u2022 Appropriate antibiotics fail to shrink node within 2 weeks.\n\n\u2022 Supraclavicular adenopathy.\n\nClose communication between surgeon, oncologist, and pathologist is critical to maximize results from lymph node biopsy. In addition, the following precautions should be observed:\n\n\u2022 Upper cervical and inguinal areas should be avoided; lower cervical and axillary nodes are more likely to give reliable information. \u2022 The largest node should be biopsied, not the most accessible one. The oncologist should select the node to be biopsied in consultation with the surgeon. \u2022 The node should be removed intact with the capsule, not piecemeal.\n\n\u2022 The lymph node should be immediately submitted to the pathologist fresh or in sufficient tissue culture medium to prevent the tissue from drying out. The node must not be left in strong light, where it will be subject to heat and it should not be wrapped in dry gauze, which may produce a drying artifact. Fresh and frozen samples should be set aside for additional studies, as noted below. Intraoperative frozen section and cytologic smears should be performed. These findings, together with the clinical data, will determine which of the following additional studies may be required:\n\n\u2022 Gram stain and culture (bacterial including mycobacterial, viral, and/or fungal) if clinically warranted or if intraoperative frozen section suggests an infection. \u2022 Tissue in tissue culture medium for cytogenetic analysis in cases of suspected malignancy. Smears or touch preparations of the node on slides can be air dried for fluorescent in situ hybridization studies to confirm certain malignancies. \u2022 Tissue frozen immediately for molecular studies.\n\n\u2022 Immunohistochemical stains to help differentiate and classify tumor types.\n\n\u2022 Flow cytometry for classifying and subtyping leukemias and lymphomas.\n\n\u2022 Gene rearrangement studies for the T-cell receptor and the immunoglobulin gene may be required to determine monoclonality in leukemia or lymphoma. (These can be performed on fresh frozen tissue, or less optimally in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.) \u2022 Formalin fixation for light microscopic analysis.\n\nOnce the cause of the lymphadenopathy is ascertained, appropriate management can be undertaken. \n\nThe tip of the spleen is frequently palpable in otherwise normal infants and young children. It is usually palpable in premature infants and in about 30% of full-term infants. It may normally be felt in children up to 3 or 4 years of age. At an older age, the spleen tip is generally not palpable below the costal margin and a palpable spleen usually indicates splenic enlargement two to three times its normal size.\n\nCongenital asplenia is found in the rare Ivemark syndrome-trilobed lungs, centralized liver, and cardiac defects as well as a risk of infection. Diagnosis of asplenia (congenital or postsurgical) is made by the presence of Howell\u00c0Jolly bodies and the presence of intracellular vesicles (appearing as pits or pocks) in erythrocytes and no uptake by Tc99 colloid sulfur radionuclide.\n\nThis condition is characterized by the presence of several spleens of varying size and function, hepatobiliary abnormalities and cardiac anomalies.\n\nAccessory spleens occur in 15% of normal people and are usually present with no other abnormalities. The most frequent location is the splenic hilum or the tail of the pancreas or other locations in the abdomen or pelvis. Its identification is important when splenectomy is carried out for hematologic indications and the desired clinical effect is not obtained due to a functional accessory spleen.\n\nSplenosis is autotransplantation of splenic tissue into the peritoneum or omentum and results from rupture of the spleen and spillage and subsequent implantation of splenocytes.\n\nSequestration of the spleen refers to splenic enlargement when blood enters the spleen but is unable to exit properly, for example, sickle cell anemia in young infants and congenital spherocytosis, and is characterized by a sudden severe drop in hemoglobin, occasionally hypovolemic shock, and abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant.\n\nSplenoptosis occurs when the spleen is not fixed within the retroperitoneum, and a palpable spleen may be due to visceroptosis rather than true splenomegaly. This distinction is important to make so that extensive investigations for the cause of splenomegaly are not undertaken unnecessarily. Visceroptosis may result from congenital or acquired defects in the supporting mechanism responsible for maintaining the spleen in the correct position. The visceroptosed spleen may be felt anywhere from the upper abdomen to the pelvis and may undergo torsion. When the spleen is felt in the upper abdomen, it can easily be pushed under the left costal margin. This finding is helpful in diagnosing visceroptosis and in differentiating it from true splenomegaly.\n\nIn addition to this finding, an abdominal radiograph in the upright position may reveal intestinal gas bubbles between the left dome of the diaphragm and the spleen. This sign may be helpful in differentiating true splenomegaly from visceroptosis of the spleen.\n\nThe significance of splenomegaly depends on the underlying disease. Splenomegaly can be caused by diseases that result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid and reticuloendothelial systems (e.g., infections, connective tissue disorders), infiltrative disorders (e.g., Gaucher disease, leukemia, lymphoma), hematologic disorders (e.g., thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis), and conditions that cause distention of the sinusoids whenever there is increased pressure in the portal or splenic veins (portal hypertension). Table 4 .3 lists the various causes of splenomegaly.\n\nDetailed History \n\nThe extent to which the following investigations are undertaken must be guided by clinical judgment. It is not necessary to perform all the evaluations. If the child appears well and the index of suspicion is low, it is reasonable to do no further investigations and reexamine the child in 1\u00c02 weeks. If the splenomegaly persists, the following investigations should be done:\n\n\u2022 Blood count: Red cell indices, reticulocyte count, platelet count, differential white blood cell count, and blood film (which may demonstrate evidence of hematologic malignancy, hemolytic disorders, viral and protozoal infections). \u2022 Evaluation for infection: Blood culture and viral studies (CMV, EBV panel, HIV, toxoplasmosis, smear for malaria, tuberculin test). \u2022 Evaluation for evidence of hemolytic disease: Blood count, reticulocyte count, blood smear, serum bilirubin, urinary urobilinogen, direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test), and red cell enzyme assays (if indicated). \u2022 Evaluation for liver disease: Liver function tests, \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, serum copper, ceruloplasmin (to exclude Wilson disease), and liver biopsy (if indicated). \u2022 Evaluation for portal hypertension: Ultrasound and Doppler of portal venous system and endoscopy (if indicated to exclude esophageal varices). \u2022 Evaluation for connective tissue disease: ESR, C3, C4, CH 50 , antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine. \u2022 Evaluation for infiltrative disease (benign and malignant):\n\n\u2022 Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, looking for blasts, Langerhans cell histiocytes, or storage cells.\n\n\u2022 Enzyme assay for Gaucher and other storage diseases. \u2022 Lymph node biopsy: If there is significant lymphadenopathy, lymph node biopsy may provide the diagnosis. \u2022 Imaging studies:\n\n\u2022 Abdominal CT scan, if indicated.\n\n\u2022 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if indicated.\n\n\u2022 Liver\u00c0spleen scans with 99m Tc-sulfur colloid. \u2022 Splenectomy or partial splenectomy: If less invasive studies have failed to provide the diagnosis, it may be necessary to perform a splenectomy or a partial splenectomy on rare occasions to establish a diagnosis. Splenic tissue must be processed for cultures and Gram stain, as well as for histology, flow cytometry, histochemical stains, electron microscopy, and gene rearrangement studies.\n\nOnce the etiology of the splenomegaly is ascertained, further management for the underlying disorder can be instituted.\n\nSplenectomy is usually done laparoscopically and partial splenectomy has become a therapeutic alternative to total splenectomy. Partial splenectomy leaving at least 20% splenic tissue is sufficient to preserve immune competence and is suitable when splenectomy is performed for indications other than for immune-mediated hematologic disorders such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nThe primary risk of splenectomy is overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) and sepsis.
