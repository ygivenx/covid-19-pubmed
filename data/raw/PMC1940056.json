{"title": "DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites:\nAdvances and Challenges", "body": "In spite of the success of vaccines in public health, there are\nstill numerous pathogens, and in particular protozoan parasites\nsuch as Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma  sp., or\nLeishmania sp. against which there are still no effective vaccine.\nHowever, the discovery that the direct injection of plasmid\nDNA encoding foreign proteins could lead to endogenous\nprotein biosynthesis and a specific immune response\nagainst it opened new perspectives in vaccine development.\nOver 15 years later, DNA vaccines have gone from a scientific\ncuriosity to one of the most dynamic fields of research\nand may offer new alternatives for the control of infectious\ndiseases [1]. Indeed, the first two DNA vaccines have been licenced,\nin recent years, to protect horses from west nile virus\nand salmons from infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus,\nconfirming the usefulness of this biotechnology. We review\nhere some of the advances and challenges for the development\nof DNA vaccines against two well-studied protozoan\nparasites, Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. Both belong\nto the trypanosomatidae family and are ranked among\nthe three major protozoan parasites affecting humans. Leishmaniasis\nis a complex disease caused by at least 18 species\nof parasites from the Leishmania genus and transmitted to\nhumans by hematophagous sandflies. With an estimated 12\nmillion cases, it has a major public health impact in several\nregions, and in particular in India, Sudan, and Brazil [2].\nClinical manifestations range from self-healing cutaneous lesion\nto fatal visceral form, and this variety can be attributed\nin part to the respective parasite species, and each presents\nspecific relationships with the host and diverse mechanisms\nof pathogenesis [3, 4], which represents an additional difficulty\nfor the development of treatments and vaccines. On the\nother hand, T. cruzi is the agent of Chagas disease, which is\npresent from southern Argentina to the southern USA. An\nestimated 16\u201318 million persons are infected in the Americas\nand close to 100 million people are at risk of infection.\nAfter a short benign acute phase (a few weeks) and a very\nlong (several years) asymtomatic phase, about 30\u201340% of infected\npatients develop chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy and\neventualy die of heart failure. Current chemotherapy relies\non nitrofurans (Nifurtimox), or nitroimidazoles (Benznidazole).\nHowever, the usefulness of these drugs is limited by\ntheir reduced efficacy (mostly during the early stages of the\ninfection), serious side effects, and the emergence of drugresistant\nstrains of parasites, and new treatments are slow to\ndevelop [5].\n\nDNA vaccines induce a complete immune response against\nthe encoded antigen. The exact mechanisms involved in this\nproccess are still poorly understood, and particularly the type\nof CD4+ and CD8+ effector and memory cells activated, and some of these aspects have been reviewed in detail elsewhere\n[1]. Apart from their immunogenicity and efficacy that will\nbe discussed below, there are several features of DNA vaccines\nthat make them very advantageous against tropical diseases.\nFirst, they are extremely safe as they do not contain any\npathogenic organism that may revert in virulence. The major\nconcern of genomic integration of the plasmid DNA has\nalso extensively been studied in safety studies and found to\nbe rather unlikely [6]. Additional safety issues such as anti-DNA antibodies or autoimmunity have also been addressed\nin a growing number of preclinical and clinical studies [7],\nwhich confirmed the high safety of these vaccines. With respect\nto manufacturing, storage, and distribution, they also\npresent major benefits in that the production process is the\nsame for any DNA vaccine, which is not the case for other\ntypes of biologicals and vaccines, for which a specific protocol\nhas to be developed for each. This makes production easy\nand costs will likely go down as this type of vaccines become\nmainstream and future technological improvements are implemented.\nAlso, plasmid DNA is a very stable molecule,\nspecially compared to recombinant or live attenuated vaccines,\nwhich would greatly facilitate storage and distribution\nof DNA vaccine in tropical settings with limited health infrastructure\nas the huge costs associated with the cold chain\nmay be offset. Administration is also easy as simple IM or\nID injections can be sufficient, and multiple plasmids can\nbe combined for the elaboration of multivalent vaccines [1].\nOverall, DNA vaccines may thus represent an ideally affordable\nalternative for disease control, which explains in part the\ngrowing interest in their development for the control of tropical\nparasitic diseases such as malaria, Leishmaniasis, or Chagas\ndisease.\n\nAs mentioned above, leishmaniasis is caused by at least\n18 species of parasites with diverse relationships with the\nhost and mechanisms of pathogenesis [3, 4]. Early studies\nof cross-protection between Leishmania species clearly\nshowed that it is a complex problem, with infection by one\nspecies protecting or not from subsequent infection by another\nspecies, depending on the species and the order of infections.\nMost vaccine studies have thus been focusing on homologous\nprotection, although a single vaccine able to protect\nagainst all pathogenic species would be ideal.\n\nThe correlates for protection have been extensively studied\nin the case of L. major, and contributed considerably to\nthe development of the Th1/Th2 paradigm [8]. Thus, there\nis a general agreement that a Th1-type immune response,\ncharacterized by a high IFN\u03b3 and low IL-4 and IL-10 production,\nleads to control of L. major infection, while a Th2-type immune response does not [8]. Antibodies may have\nan exacerbatory role [9], but may also contribute to T cell\nresponses [10, 11]. Both IFN\u03b3 producing CD4+ and CD8+T\ncells seem to contribute to protective immunity, and induction\nof NO production by macrophages is central to parasite\nelimiation [12, 13]. While it was assumed for a long time that\nthis Th1/Th2 paradigm was applied to all Leishmania species,\nit has become clear in recent years that each species has a\ndistinct relationship with the host, different mechanisms of\npathogenesis, and possibly different correlates for protection\n[3, 4]. Nonetheless, IFN\u03b3 production seems to be a general\nrequirement, although not necessarily sufficient, for protection\nagainst most if not all Leishmania species.\n\nThe earliest DNA vaccine experiments against Leishmania\nused L. major GP63 antigen, which has been extensively used\nas a recombinant or peptide vaccine. Immunization with a\nplasmid encoding GP63 was able to induce a Th1-type cytokine\nprofile and a significant reduction of lesion size after\nchallenge of the immunized mice with L. major [14\u201317]. Subsequent\nstudies investigated DNA vaccines encoding a large\nvariety of Leishmania proteins (Table 1) and showed that\nmany different DNA vaccines were able to induce a Th1 immune\nresponse, and confer variable degrees of protection as\nassessed by reduction in skin lesion size and/or parasite burdens\nin mouse models. However, given the large variety in experimental\nmodels and designs, it is difficult to compare the\neffectiveness of the different vaccines to induce a protective\nimmune response. Nonetheless, it is clear from studies comparing\ndifferent DNA vaccines that the nature of the antigen\nencoded by the vaccine is a key parameter for efficacy.\n\nAlso, a few studies provided interesting comparisons of\nthe same antigens administered as recombinant protein or\nDNA vaccines and showed that the latter were overall more\neffective than their recombinant protein counterparts. Indeed,\nDNA vaccines were able to induce a stronger Th1 bias\nin the immune response, a longer-lasting immunity, and/or a\nbetter protection against disease progression [19, 31, 32, 35, 40, 44]. While most of these studies have used a rather artificial\ninfectious challenge based on the injection via nonnatural\nroutes of high parasite doses, an experimental system criticized\nby some authors, the superior efficacy of DNA vaccines\nwas also observed using a low-dose intradermal challenge in\nthe ear, which was proposed to more closely mimick natural\ninfection [45]. In these studies, both DNA and protein vaccination\nwere able to induce very similar level of short-term (2\nweeks postvaccination) protection against infection with L. major, but only DNA vaccine was able to induce long-term\n(12 weeks postvaccination) protection [45].\n\nThese results thus confirmed the strong potential of DNA\nvaccines against Leishmania, but also indicated that in most\ncases only partial protection was achieved. Prime-boost immunization\nprotocols have been tested with various antigens\nto increase vaccine potency (Table 1). They are based\non priming the immune response with a DNA vaccine and\nboosting with the corresponding recombinant vaccine based\non recombinant virus or protein (Table 1). In some studies,\nsuch immunization protocol resulted in increased immunogenicity\nof the vaccines and better protection levels [26, 27],\nbut in others, DNA only remained the best formulation for\noptimum efficacy [32]. Nonetheless, a major drawback of such vaccine formulation remains its complexity, which may\nlimit their practical use.\n\nAn alternative way to broaden vaccine immunogenicity and\nincrease its efficacy has been to use combination of plasmids\nencoding various antigens. For examples, cysteine proteinase\n(CP) a and b DNA vaccines are not protective when\nused individually, but immunization with a combination of\nboth plasmids induces long-term protective immunity [34].\nAlternatively, gene fusion has also been successively used to\nachieve expression of an antigenic fusion protein from a single\nplasmid construct [33]. Overall, expression of several\nantigens mostly resulted in increased efficacy, but this also\ndepended on the antigen combination [13, 22, 23, 41, 45].\nMost authors thus argue that a successful Leishmania vaccine\nis likely to be based on multiple antigens.\n\nImmunization with large number of plasmids is also the basis\nfor expression library immunization, a powerful but labor intensive\nstrategy for vaccine discovery [46], which has been\nused with Leishmania. Immunization of mice with L. major\ngenomic expression library fractions was able to induce\nsignificant protection, but these authors did not pursue library\nfractionation further [47]. In another study, the identification\nof protective library subsets from an L. donovani\namastigote cDNA library and their successive fractionation\ninto smaller protective libraries lead to the identification of\nnovel protective antigens [48]. Interestingly, most of the antigens\nidentified would not have been predicted to be good vaccine candidates. Indeed, they were not surface or secreted\nproteins, neither stage-specific, but were intracellular and\nsome very conserved such as histones, or ribosomal proteins\n[48]. Vaccine discovery is also the next logical step following\nthe recent completion of the L. major genome sequencing\n[49]. In one approach, the random screening of 100 genes\nupregulated in amastigotes tested as DNA vaccine allowed\nthe identification of 14 novel protective and 7 exacerbating\nantigens [50, 51]. Again, function and cellular localization\nwould have been poor predictors of the protective efficacy\nof these antigens, as most were not predicted to be localized\non the surface, but shared similarity with ribosomal proteins,\ncytoskeleton, or metabolic enzymes [51]. It is thus becoming\nincreasingly clear that there is little rationale to limit Leishmania\nvaccine discovery searches to surface or secreted antigens.\nRather, new criteria need to be considered for the rational\nidentification of vaccine candidates as strategies based on\nsuch random screening cannot be applied to large genomes\nsuch as that of Leishmania, with over 8000 annotated genes.\n\nAn additional advantage of DNA vaccines is their potential\nas therapeutic vaccines, aimed at reinforcing or redirecting\nthe immune response of an infected host to control disease\nprogression [58]. The major advantage of this strategy in addition\nto its efficacy is that it relies on short treatment regimens,\nand it is thus an attractive alternative to chemotherapy,\nparticularly in the case of Leishmania with so few chemotherapeutic\noptions. Thus, administration of as little as two doses\nof a DNA vaccine encoding PSA-2 can control an ongoing infection\nwith L. major in mice [59]. The therapeutic effect is\ndue to a shift of the immune response towards a Th1 immune\nresponse [59]. Similarly, a DNA vaccine encoding L.\ndonovani nucleoside hydrolase NH36 has therapeutic activity\nagainst murine visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. chagasi\n[60]. The simplicity of such treatment makes them very advantageous\ncompared to chemotherapy. In addition, the fact\nthat the same DNA vaccine can be effective for both the prophylaxis\n[40] and the therapy of Leishmania infection is thus\nvery promising as this would provide a versatile tool for the\ncontrol of this parasite.\n\nAs mentioned above, an added challenge to Leishmania vaccine\ndevelopment is the large number of species, as well as\nthe variability within species. Indeed, studies on the polymorphism\nof leading antigens such as GP63 quickly revealed\nthat it was a very polymorphic [61, 62]. Such polymorphism\nhas important implication for vaccine development as it may\nlimit their efficacy against variant strains of parasites or novel\nescape mutants, and thus restrict vaccine protection to a single\nspecies [63, 64]. Antigen polymorphism between multiple\nstrains and species is thus becoming a major issue in\nmany vaccine development studies [65, 66]. In the case of\nLeishmania, few DNA vaccines have been tested against multiple\nspecies. LACK antigen, initially identified in L. major,\nand found to be very conserved between Leishmania species,\ncan protect mice against L. major [20] and \nL. amazonensis\n[67], but not against L. mexicana [23], L. donovani [25], or\nL. chagasi [24]. On the other hand, L. amazonensis nuclease\nprotein P4 can protect against both L. amazonensis and\nL. major, but cross-protection requires a different formulation\n(IL-12 or HSP70 as adjuvant, resp.) [38]. In other studies,\nantigens from one species were used to induce protection\nagainst another species [31], but the extent of cross-protection\nagainst various species was not investigated. More\nrecently, a single formulation of L. donovani NH36 DNA vaccine\nwas found to induce a very good protection against both\nL. chagasi and L. mexicana, suggesting that this DNA vaccine\nmay be able to provide broad protection against various\nLeishmania species [40]. Importantly, no DNA vaccine has\nyet been tested against L. braziliensis, in spite of this species\nbeing responsible of most cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in\nSouth America.\n\nWhile all the above DNA vaccines were based on Leishmania\nantigens, an alternative approach has used antigens derived\nfrom sand-fly saliva. Indeed, it has been shown that sand-fly\nsaliva can exacerbate Leishmania infection [68, 69], and preexposure\nof mice to saliva components may be sufficient to\ninduce protection against infection [70]. Thus, a number of\nsalivary antigens have been tested as vaccines against Leishmania.\nMaxadilan is a potent vasodilator from sand-fly saliva\nand was found to be responsible of most of the exacerbatory\neffects of whole saliva on Leishmania infection [71]. Immunization\nwith this antigen (as a recombinant vaccine) protected\nmice against L. major infection [71]. Other salivary\ncomponents, such as Phlebotomus papatasi SP15, have been\ntested as DNA vaccines and found to protect mice against\nL. major and while the vaccine induced both humoral and\nDTH responses, protection seemed to be mostly accounted\nfor by the latter, as B-cell deficient mice remain protected\n[72]. Thus, characterization of sand-fly salivary proteins may\nlead to the identification of new vaccine candidates [73, 74].\nHowever, as for Leishmania antigens, salivary protein polymorphism\nremains an important issue and may limit the usefulness\nof such antigens as vaccine candidates [75, 76].\n\nBased on the success of many of these DNA vaccine studies\nin mice, a few vaccine candidates have been tested in additional\nanimal models, possibly more relevants for the development\nof a veterinary or human vaccine (Table 2). PFR-2\nand KMP11 antigens were tested as DNA vaccines in hamsters,\na highly susceptible animal model. PFR-2 was tested as\nprotein, DNA, or DNA-protein immunization, and protection\nlevels against L. mexicana varied greatly depending on\nvaccine formulation, route of immunization, and sex of the\nanimals [52]. Also, contrary to mouse studies, protein vaccination\nseemed more protective than DNA only vaccination. However, as in mouse studies, heterologous prime-boost\nvaccination with DNA and protein seemed better than DNA\nonly [52]. Another DNA vaccine encoding PapLe22 was\nfound to be immunogenic in hamsters and decreased parasitemia\nafter infection with L. infantum, but further assessment\nof disease was not performed [54]. Immunization with\nKPM11 DNA induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response, but was\nable to protect hamsters against visceral leishmaniasis caused\nby L. donovani  [53]. In dogs, while several protein vaccines\nhave been tested and a purified protein vaccine has now been\nlicenced for veterinary use [77], very few DNA vaccine studies\nhave been performed. A heterologous prime-boost strategy\nusing CPa and CPb DNA and protein was reported as\nimmunogenic and protective [57], but the study was of limited\npower given the reduced number of animals. In another\nstudy, dogs were immunized with a mixture of DNA vaccines\nencoding 10 different antigens previously tested in mouse\nmodels, and this immunization induced a very good immune\nresponse, with a high production of IFN\u03b3 [56]. However,\nevaluation of protection was limited to an acute in vitro assay\n[56] and further studies will be required to assess the potential\nof this vaccine in dogs. In spite of their limitations, these\nstudies clearly showed that several DNA vaccines can induce\na potent immune response in nonmurine animal models,\nand it is likely that a good level of protection can be achieved\nin these as well, provided the correct antigens and vaccine\nformulation are used.\n\nVaccine development against Chagas disease has been dramatically\nlimited because of extensive debate on the mechanisms\ninvolved in this pathology [78, 79]. Indeed, some studies\nsuggested that tissue damage was associated with the presence\nand replication of intracellular amastigotes, while others\nproposed that autoimmunity induced by parasite antigens\nmimicking host proteins was responsible for it. It was thus\nunclear if the immune response needed to be inhibited, to reduce\nautoimmunity, or stimulated, to eliminate the parasite.\nIt is now accepted that the presence of parasites in cardiac\ntissue is necessary to initiate and maintain the inflammatory\nresponse, and that therapeutic treatments or vaccines aimed\nat eliminating T. cruzi would limit or prevent the progression\ntowards chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy [80, 81]. There is a\ngrowing consensus that protection against T. cruzi relies on a\nTh1 immune response and the activation of cytotoxic CD8+T\ncells [82\u201385].\n\nThe first DNA vaccines to be tested against T. cruzi encoded\nan antigen from the well characterized trans-sialidase family\nof proteins. There are over 1400 members in this family,\nmaking it one of the largest protein families of the parasite,\nand they are very abundant surface proteins. Several\nstudies have used different members of this family, such as\nTS or TSA-1 (Table 3) [84, 86\u201388]. Immunization with TS\nwas found to induce significant antibody titers able to inhibit\ntrans-sialidase enzyme activity, a strong DTH, and lymphoproliferative\nresponse [86]. This immune response was\nprotective as determined by an increase in survival and a decrease\nin parasitemia. Immunization with TSA-1 DNA was\nfound to induce a specific CTL response which also lead to a\nlower parasitemia and increased survival in both BALB/c and\nC57BL/6 mice [88].\n\nAs in Leishmania vaccine studies, a few authors addressed\nthe question of comparing protein and DNA vaccines encoding\nthe same antigen [90, 98]. In A/Sn mice, immunization\nwith recombinant TS induced a higher antibody titer than TS\nDNA, but a comparable decrease in parasitemia. However,\nthe DNA vaccine was unable to increase survival, which the\nauthor attributed to the strain of the mice used, since this\nDNA vaccine was protective in BALB/c mice [90]. On the\nother hand, immunization with recombinant CRP or CRP\nDNA induced a comparable Th1 immune response, but only\nthe DNA vaccine was protective against infection [98].\n\nA number of other studies showed that DNA vaccines encoding\nvarious antigens could induce significant protection\nagainst T. cruzi infection, as evidenced by decreased parasitemia\nand improved survival of vaccinated mice (Table 3).\nIn addition, a few studies also presented evidence of a reduction\nin cardiac tissue damage and inflammation at the\nhistopathologic level [87, 97]. Furthermore, T cell analysis\nconfirmed that protection relied on CD8+T cells [84, 91] and\nrecent studies showed that these cells were very rapidly activated\nfollowing infection of mice immunized with DNA vaccines\n[101]. DNA vaccines based on defined T cell epitopes\nfrom TS antigen have also been tested and it was found that both CD4+ and CD8+T cell epitopes were necessary and sufficient\nto induce a protective immune response [102].\n\nTaken together, these data clearly demonstrated that vaccination\ndid not result in increased pathology, as initially\nfeared, but allowed at least partial control of disease progression,\nthus confirming the central role of parasite persistence\nfor Chagas disease pathogenesis and opening the way to further\nassessment of DNA vaccines against T. cruzi. However, it\nhas to be noted that many of the antigens tested belonged to\nthe trans-sialidase family of protein, so that there is still little\ndiversity in terms of the antigens tested as vaccines against T.\ncruzi (Table 3).\n\nBecause protection induced by single antigen DNA vaccine\nremained partial, a number of studies have evaluated strategies\nto increase vaccine efficacy. These include the use of\ncytokine/chemokine encoding plasmids to potentiate the immune\nresponse induced by the vaccine, and two of the most\nstudied molecules have beens IL-12 and GM-CSF, which both\nwere generally able to potentiate protection (Table 2). Alternatively,\nmixtures of plasmids encoding distinct antigens\nwere used for immunization, and as mentioned above for\nLeishmania vaccines. For example, immunization of mice\nwith plasmids encoding TS and ASP-2 proteins resulted in\na specific immune response against both antigens and an increased\nprotection against infection [97]. On the other hand,\nan immunization with a mixture of DNA vaccines encoding\nup to 6 proteins from the mucin family resulted poorly\nprotective, while a mixture of up to 7 proteins from the TS\nfamily was protective, but not as much as a single antigen\nvaccine encoding the TS-like antigen ASP-2 [96]. Similarly, a\nmixture of DNA vaccines encoding ASP-1, ASP-2, and TSA-1\nhad a similar protective activity as TSA-1 alone [87]. The lack\nof efficacy of these multivalent vaccines may be attributed to\nthe presence of shared or immunodominant epitopes since\nthey have significant sequence similarity that may not have\nresulted in a broader immune reponse.\n\nHeterologous prime-boost approach has also been evaluated\nand immunization with some combinations of DNA\nand recombinant TS was found to enhance Th1 immune\nresponse, but protection was not significantly different from\nthat obtained with DNA alone [103]. Taken together, these\nstudies suggest that additional strategies need to be investigated\nto potentiate DNA vaccine efficacy against T. cruzi.\n\nTherapeutic administration of DNA vaccines to control an\nongoing infection with T. cruzi may represent an additional alternative for Chagas disease control. The concept was\ndemonstrated in mice acutely or chronically infected, and\nin both cases the administration of only two doses of DNA\nvaccine encoding TSA-1 or Tc24 antigens was sufficient to\nlimit disease progression, as treated mice presented increased\nsurvival and reduced cardiac tissue damage, as assessed by\nhistopathologic analysis [104]. A comparative study of different\nDNA vaccines identified Tc52 antigen as another therapeutic\nvaccine candidate, while DNA vaccines encoding antigens\nfrom the TS family previously found to be protective\nhad no signifiacnt therapeutic effect [105]. It was found that\ntherapeutic vaccination rapidly induced spleen cell proliferation,\nincluding IFN\u03b3-producing CD4+ and CD8+T cells,\nwhile the effects on cardiac tissue inflammation and parasite\nburden take longer to be detectable [106]. Importantly, in\nall these studies, therapeutic vaccination of T. cruzi infected\nmice did not result in an increased inflammatory reaction in\nthe heart, confirming that it is safe to stimulate the immune\nresponse of T. cruzi infected mice and that attacking the parasite\ncan lead to a reduction of pathology. These studies thus\nopen very attractive perspectives for the control of T. cruzi infection,\nand further studies on the efficacy of DNA vaccines\nencoding other antigens and on the immune mechanisms\nunderlying their therapeutic effect should provide clues for\nthe optimization of this strategy.\n\nAs for any vaccine, the nature of the antigen used remains\na key factor for vaccine efficacy, and there is still little variety\nin terms of antigens evaluated as DNA vaccine candidates\nagainst T. cruzi. Thus, a number of studies have aimed\nat identifying novel antigens through various strategies. The\nmost classical approach has been the screening of cDNA\nlibraries using antibodies and screening an amastigote library\nallowed the identification of a novel antigen Tc\u03b23, and\ntwo previously characterized ones, LYT1 and FcaBP/Tc24\n[96]. DNA vaccines encoding these antigens induced variable\nlevels of protection, the best one being LYT [96]. Alternatively,\nexpression-library immunization, described above\nfor Leishmania, was also tested with T. cruzi, and found to\nbe immunogenic, but there was no attempt at fractionating\nthe library or identifying protective antigens [107]. A likely\nreason is that such strategy may be too labor-intensive for\nlarge genomes/libraries, and its usefulness may be limited to\npathogens with small genomes. The availability of T. cruzi\ngenome sequence also opens new possibilities for antigen\ndiscovery. In one of the first studies using such resource, a\ncombination of bioinformatics analysis were used to identify\nGPI-anchored or secreted proteins, and most of the identified\nclones were immunogenic as DNA vaccines [108]. Further\nstudies may confirm the usefulness of these new vaccines\nto protect against T. cruzi infection. Nonetheless, as discussed\nabove for Leishmania, the rationale for limiting antigen\nsearches to surface proteins may not be totally relevant,\nand additional strategies should also be used to include unbiaised\ngenome-wide surveys for antigen discovery.\n\nAs detailed in this review, there have been considerable advances\nin DNA vaccines against Leishmania and T. cruzi in recent\nyears. Taken together, these studies clearly validated the\nconcept of using DNA vaccines for both protection and therapy\nagainst these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse\nmodels. While sterile immunity seems to be an irrealistic\ngoal for either Leishmania or T. cruzi, a reduction in disease\nseverity and in the development of the pathology seems\nclearly within the reach of DNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the\nrelevance of such mouse models for the development of veterinary\nor human vaccines against these parasites has been\nchallenged by some authors. The few DNA vaccine studies\nin nonmurine models of Leishmaniasis suggest that some extrapolation may\nbe feasible, but certainly not completely. Additional\nadvanced preclinical studies of DNA vaccine candidates\nin nonmurine animal models such as rats, hamsters,\ndogs, or monkeys are thus warranted in the next few years, to\nfurther explore the immunology and efficacy of DNA vaccines\nagainst these parasites. As already observed in such\nstudies for other pathogens, this will lead to the challenge of\nachieving in these species an immunogenicity of comparable\nlevel and protective efficacy as that obtained in murine models.\nHowever, advances in adjuvants, DNA vaccine formulation,\nand delivery systems are likely to contribute to such results\n[1, 109].\n\nAnother major issue is that of antigen discovery, and\nwhile a number of DNA vacines tested so far against Leishmania\nor T. cruzi have shown promise, we are still unsure if\nthese are the best possible antigens, particularly since these\nparasites have relatively large genomes, and only a limited\nvariety of antigens have been tested. The availability of the\ngenome sequences of these parasites will without doubt be\na key resource for genome-wide screenings for new protective\nantigens. A key lesson from the initial studies reviewed\nhere [48, 51, 108], together with other similar antigen discovery\nstudies, seems to be that cellular localization and protein\nfunction are poor predictors of the antigenicity and protective\nefficacy of a protein. Alternative criteria should thus be\nused so that potent vaccine candidates are not missed, and\nthe important development of genome-mining and bioinformatic\ntools is providing new tools for a more rational search\nof vaccine candidates [110].\n\nTo conclude, those DNA vaccines represent a promising\napproach for the control of Leishmania sp. and T. cruzi, and\nsuch vaccines would have a major impact in developing endemic\ncountries. Thus the question does not seem to be if\nDNA vaccines can control these parasites, since many studies\nhave clearly showed that this is the case, but how to translate\nwhat has been achieved in mouse models into veterinary or\nhuman vaccines of comparable efficacy."}
