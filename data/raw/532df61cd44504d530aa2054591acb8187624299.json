{"title": "PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE Effect of husbandry methods on seropositivity to African swine fever virus in Sardinian swine herds", "body": "African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most severe diseases of pigs. Acute ASF is characterized by hemorrhage and high mortality (Sanchez-Vizcaino, 1992) . Subclinical infections may also occur, depending upon host factors and the virulence of the etiological agent (Mebus, 1988) . The unique and complex DNA virus that causes ASF (ASFV) is maintained, in sub-Saharan Africa, in a transmission cycle between argasid ticks (Ornithodoros sp.), and warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) and bushpigs (Potamochoerus porcus), with no disease consequences for the vertebrate hosts (Wilkinson, 1989 ).\n\nThe first report of ASF outside the African continent came from Portugal in 1957. In the following decades, ASF epidemics occurred in several European and American countries (Sanchez-Vizcaino, 1992) . In the absence of a vaccine, and because of the catastrophic impact of ASF on the pig industry, control of ASF epidemics has been achieved by slaughtering susceptible pigs; the entire swine population of Malta (80000 pigs) was sacrificed because of an outbreak of ASF in 1978 (Wilkinson et al., 1981) .\n\nASF was eradicated from the Iberian Peninsula in 1995, and Sardinia is the only non-African region where the infection is still present (Laddomada, 1996) . The disease appeared in southern Sardinia in 1978, allegedly introduced from the Iberian Peninsula via garbage containing raw pork, which was subsequently fed to pigs (Contini et al., 1982) . The infection was successfully eradicated from the southern part of the island, but an endemic area persists in the province of Nuoro, in eastern-central Sardinia (Laddomada et al., 1991) . In this mountainous area ( = l/4 of the island), traditional pig husbandry practices (such as grazing free-range herds on publicly-owned land) is considered a major obstacle to disease control.\n\nOrnithodoros sp. ticks were an important factor in the persistence of ASF in Spain (Perez-Sanchez et al., 1994) , but have not been found in Sardinia (Ruiu et al., 1989) . The wild boar (Sus scrofa ferus) is susceptible to ASF, and its role as a reservoir of ASFV needs further study. In Sardinia, cases of ASF in this species were consistently attributed to primary infections in domestic pigs (Firinu and Scarano, 1988) . Therefore, the maintenance of ASF in Sardinia is probably based on the transmission of ASFV among domestic pigs.\n\nIn addition to acutely-ill animals, asymptomatic or recovered pigs are potential sources of ASFV (Wilkinson, 1984) . The serological identification of these 'permanently infected virus carriers' is critical to the eradication of the disease (Sanchez-Vizcaino, 1992; Beth-Nielsen et al., 1995) . To evaluate the time trend of ASFV in the endemic area of Nuoro, and the role of three traditional pig husbandry systems in the persistence of the infection, we carried out epidemiological analyses of serological data collected from October 1994 through March 1996.\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines of the Sardinian ASF eradication program, funded by the European Union (EU Official Bulletin No. L 116, 19901 , serological exams were carried out on pigs older than 3 months from registered farms ' in Health Districts No. 7, 8, 9, 10 , and 11, of Nuoro. Serum samples obtained by veterinarians were analyzed for ASFV antibodies at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Sassari, using a ' All pig farms were registered in a list at the Health District's Veterinary Office previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . Confirmatory western blotting (WB) was carried out on samples that tested positive by ELISA . Seropositive pigs were to be destroyed and, on farms where seropositive pigs were found, serological exams on all remaining animals were to be repeated after one month.\n\nThe ASF eradication program was monitored through a computerized database, consisting of farm type, number of pigs present (NPRES), number of pigs serologically tested (NTEST), and number of pigs that tested positive (NPOS).\n\nPig farms were divided into three types: (a> free-range farms, with pigs grazing on vast publicly owned areas during the entire year; (b) partial confinement farms, where animals are grazing on public areas during the fall (to utilize acorns produced by evergreen oaks) and kept indoors for the rest of the year; (c> total confinement farms, with a small number of animals reared for family consumption and kept indoors permanently (Contini et al., 1982) .\n\nFor each farm visit, within-farm seroprevalence (NPOS/NTEST) was calculated, and the herd was classified as ASFV-positive if seroprevalence > 0. The percentage of ASFV --farms [(No. of ASFV + farms/visited farms) X 1001 was calculated for each farm type. The median and the first and third quartiles (Qi, QJ of within-farm ASFV seroprevalence were calculated for ASFV + farms, and differences in seroprevalence among farm types were tested by Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA (Zar, 1984) . The secular trend of the percentage of ASFV + farms was analyzed by 12-month moving average (Smith, 19951 , and by simple linear regression of monthly (actual) data using MONTH as the independent variable (two-tailed significance level cr = 0.05) (SAS, 1990) .\n\nMultiple logistic regression (unconditional maximum likelihood method; SAS, 1990) was used to evaluate the adjusted effects of farm type, ln(NTEST) (the natural logarithm of NTEST; Willeberg et al., 19941 , and MONTH on farm seropositivity. Two design ('dummy') variables were created to compare farm types, using partial-confinement farms as the reference group. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess the overall significance of the model (two-tailed significance level (Y = 0.05) and of interactions between the variables coding for the comparisons among farm types and the continuous independent variables (ln(NTEST), and MONTH) (two-tailed significance level (Y = 0.1) (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989) . The significance of each term retained in the final model was tested by Wald's x *. Estimated odds ratios (OR) for the comparison between farm types at different levels of the interacting continuous variable, were obtained (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989) .\n\nSerological tests were carried out on 97 283 pigs, from 5744 traditional farms (out of 6409 registered) in the ASFV endemic area in Nuoro, from October 1994 through March 1996. In traditional farms, 9.84% of pigs that were examined tested positive for ASFV 2. The 1Zmonth moving average of the percentage of ASFV + farms is shown in Fig.  1 . There was a significant negative time trend in the percentage of ASFV + farms (9 = 5.7-0.22 . MONTH, R2 = 0.43, P < 0.01). The within-farm seroprevalence differed significantly among farm types (Kruskal-Wallis H = 12.2, 2 d.f., P < 0.005, Table   1 ). The likelihood ratio test for the logistic regression model was significant (likelihood ratio x2 = 1015.3, d.f. = 6, P < 0.001; Table 2 ). The interaction between farm type and MONTH (likelihood ratio x 2 = 4 79, d.f. = 2, P < 0.10) was included in the final . model. In fact, the decrease in the risk of infection over time was greater for partial-confinement than for total-confinement farms (Wald's x2 = 3.81, P < 0.06), while the risk for free-range and partial-confinement farms had similar time trends (Wald's x2 = 0.091, P > 0.1). Estimated OR's for the comparisons among farm types (controlling for MONTH) are shown in Table 3 . \n\nThe results of our analyses supported the hypothesis that the maintenance of ASFV in the endemic area of Nuoro was primarily associated with free-range pig farms (Tables 1  and 3 ). The percentage of ASFV + farms and the seroprevalence of ASFV that we observed in such herds, suggested an intense viral circulation among pigs. In free-range farms, the application of disease-control measures is particularly difficult, and animals belonging to different herds can share the same grazing areas (facilitating viral transmission) (Wilkinson, 1984; Beth-Nielsen et al., 1995) .\n\nOther epidemiological studies on viral diseases of pigs have shown that risk of infection in commercial, 'industrial' farms is associated with high confinement level and animal density, which create physiological stress and facilitate viral transmission among pigs through secretions and aerosol (Weigel et al., 1992; Austin et al., 1993) . Conversely, in our study area, total-confinement farms only have small numbers of animals reared for family consumption. Raw pork in garbage fed to pigs is the most likely source of infection for totally confined pigs in Nuoro.\n\nThe percentage of ASFV + farms decreased significantly since 1994 (Fig. 1) . However, the interaction between farm type and MONTH showed that disease control was less efficacious in total-confinement than in the other farm types. In fact, the estimated risk of infection for total-confinement farms was only one-fifth of the risk for partial confinement farms in October 1994 (OR = 0.20, Table 3 ), whereas in March 1996, the estimated OR for the comparison between these two husbandry systems was 0.57, and not statistically significant (upper confidence limit = 1.1).\n\nThe natural logarithm of the number of tested pigs per visit in a farm was associated with an increased ASFV seropositivity (Table 2) . However, a logistic regression coefficient for ln(NTEST) p = 1 suggested that the risk of infection for a single animal was not affected by herd size (Willeberg et al., 1994; Flori et al., 1995) ."}
