{"title": "Early gene expression events in ferrets in response to SARS coronavirus infection versus direct interferon-alpha2b stimulation", "body": "Viral respiratory infections are a major worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality (Kolling et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 2003) . Emerging viral threats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), avian influenza H5N1 and pandemic influenza H1N1 virus are well poised to cause epidemics or pandemics that could be socially and economically disastrous (Dushoff et al., 2006; Weiss and McMichael, 2004; Dawood et al., 2009) .\n\nFor decades, ferrets have been used for the investigation of influenza infection since they are susceptible to influenza viruses (Hull and Loosli, 1951) . More recently, ferrets have also been shown to be a good model of human SARS-CoV infection (Martina et al., 2003) . We have previously characterized ferret cytokine and chemokine genes as well as have developed immunological assays for evaluating the ferret immune system following SARS and influenza infection Danesh et al., 2008; Ochi et al., 2008) .\n\nLigation of the interferon (IFN) alpha receptors 1 and 2 (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) with IFN-\u03b1 induces IFN signaling pathways and promotes IFN gene induction. Formation of the signal transducer and activator of transcriptions 1 and 2 (STAT1-STAT2) heterodimer occurs following the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) that are associated with IFNAR2 and IFNAR1, respectively (Marijanovic et al., 2007) . These two kinases phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, which together form a complex with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) (Takaoka and Yanai, 2006) . The interferon stimulatory factor 3 complex (ISGF3) binds to interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and activates transcription of IFN-\u03b1 inducible genes, including 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1), interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and many other IFN-response genes (IRGs) (Uddin and Platanias, 2004) .\n\nIFN-\u03b1 stimulation ultimately promotes a cellular antiviral state which is hallmarked by the upregulation of IRGs (Chevaliez and Pawlotsky, 2007) . Although IFN signaling gene upregulation during viral infection has been the subject of previous reports, there is little information regarding the host immune responses directly induced by viruses versus those that are upregulated due to secondary IFN stimulation (Chelbi-Alix and Wietzerbin, 2007; Haagmans et al., 2004; Loutfy et al., 2003; Cameron et al., 2007) . Here we used our previously described ferret model (Chu et al., 2008) to identify genes that were regulated by SARS-CoV infection compared to IFN-\u03b12b stimulation in the ferret model to elucidate immune responses during viral infection. We examined the phosphorylation status of signaling molecules in IFN-\u03b12b-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) . We also analyzed the in vivo gene expression profiles of ferret PBMCs and lung necropsies following IFN-\u03b12b injection during the time course. Evaluation of gene expression patterns in PBMCs and lung necropsies of SARS-CoV-infected ferrets led us to the identification of 7 upregulated IRGs that also were upregulated in response to IFN-\u03b12b injection. Our findings in ferrets suggested IFN-\u03b12b injection and SARS-CoV infection led to similar as well as unique gene expression signatures in a global point of view. Increased knowledge of the interaction of these gene expression signatures may improve our understanding of the immune system of ferrets as a preferred animal model of severe respiratory viral illnesses.\n\nWe first investigated the phosphorylation of the IFN-\u03b1 receptor downstream signaling molecule STAT1 to determine the signaling potential of IFN-\u03b12b in ferrets. The phosphorylation status of STAT1 was evaluated using phosphorylated amino acid specific monoclonal antibody for flow cytometry analysis that cross-reacted with the phosphorylated ferret protein. PBMCs demonstrated a significant STAT1 phosphorylation response 15 min post-stimulation with IFN-\u03b12b in vitro compared to the control stimulated with PBS alone ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).\n\nSince STAT1 phosphorylation was observed in vitro, we then determined whether IFN-\u03b12b could activate STAT1 in vivo. Four ferrets were subcutaneously injected with 1 \u03bcg/kg IFN-\u03b12b and peripheral blood samples were taken at 0, 3 and 6 h post-stimulation for flow cytometry examination. By 3 h, samples extracted from all ferrets demonstrated significant STAT1 phosphorylation in the PBMCs. Control ferrets injected with PBS did not demonstrate marked STAT1 phosphorylation at any time point. The STAT1 average mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the IFN-\u03b12b-injected group was significantly increased compared to the average of its control group (P b 0.01) (Fig. 1A) . These results indicated that STAT1 was also inducible by IFN-\u03b12b in vivo.\n\nIFN signaling is critical to successful antiviral responses during infection (Haller et al., 2007) . Therefore, we next investigated the phosphorylation status of STAT1 following SARS-CoV infection. We infected ferrets with SARS-CoV or PBS control and measured the phosphorylation of STAT1 by flow cytometry. Three ferrets infected with SARS-CoV demonstrated significant STAT1 phosphorylation in PBMCs post-infection with a maximum peak at day 3 (P b 0.01). Control ferrets mock-infected with PBS did not demonstrate significant STAT1 phosphorylation at any time point (Fig. 1B) .\n\nSince STAT1 was phosphorylated following SARS-CoV infection and IFN-\u03b12b injection, we investigated select IRG expression by qRT-PCR following in vitro stimulation of ferret peripheral whole blood with IFN-\u03b12b. In vitro stimulation with IFN-\u03b12b led to significant upregulation of STAT1 and several IRGs such as MX1, OAS1, ISG15, ISG20, IRF7 and interferon-induced protein 35 (IFI35). As expected, activation of IFN-\u03b1 receptor signaling therefore initiated transcriptional activation of interferon response genes ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).\n\nWe then assessed genome-wide gene expression following in vivo IFN-\u03b12b administration in ferrets. Ferrets were subcutaneously injected with PBS (control) or IFN-\u03b12b and blood samples were drawn for RNA isolation 1 and 2 days after injection. Without a commercially available ferret microarray, the RNA was then used for microarray analysis on the Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 Array (see Materials and methods), because ferret genes show a high degree of homology with canine genes as we have previously established Rowe et al., 2010; Fang et al., Table 1 ). The peripheral blood gene expression data from IFN-\u03b12b-injected group were normalized to the control group. The t-test analyses showed the highest number of significant changes occurred at day 2, with a total of 2717 upregulated and 1230 downregulated genes in peripheral blood of the IFN-\u03b12b-injected ferrets (Table 1) . A threshold of at least 1.5 fold-change and a P value for the t-tests of less than 0.05 were chosen. The peak upregulation of a cluster of IRGs, including MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, IFI44 and ubiquitin specific protein 18 (USP18), occurred at day 1, while peak upregulation of IRGs such as JAK1, JAK2, protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) IRF1, interferon-\u03b3 receptor 1 (IFNGR1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-\u03b1 kinase 2 (EIF2AK2) occurred at day 2 post-injection ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 2) . After assessing the large scale gene expression profile following ferret in vivo IFN-\u03b12b stimulation, we validated the expression of selected IRGs by qRT-PCR according to the availability of the ferret specific primers. We found STAT1 and IRGs such as MX1, OAS1 and ISG15 were significantly upregulated in ferrets injected with IFN-\u03b12b compared to the controls (Fig. 2B ). The lack of ferret sequences for other IRGs prevented us from confirming the upregulation of these genes.\n\nTo determine if STAT1 phosphorylation was correlated with IRG activation in our ferret animal model of SARS-CoV infection (Chu et al., 2008) , we went on to analyze host gene expression following SARS-CoV infection. The gene expression data at day 2 post-infection with SARS-CoV was normalized to the mock control dataset. Unfortunately, blood samples from day 1 post-infection did not meet minimal RNA quality for microarray analysis, preventing us from performing a timecourse study on the peripheral blood. There were 138 upregulated and 414 downregulated genes (P b 0.05, N1.5 fold change) as ascertained by t-test analysis at day 2 post-infection (Table 1) . IRGs, including STAT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, IFI44, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2), USP18 and OAS ligand (OASL) were significantly upregulated ( Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table 2 ). The upregulation of STAT1, MX1, OAS1 and ISG15 were validated with qRT-PCR (Fig. 2D ). These gene expression and STAT1 phosphorylation findings suggested that robust IFN responses were activated following SARS-CoV infection 2 days post-infection.\n\nInterferon canonical pathway analysis confirmed the similarities between the expression patterns of IRGs at day 2. STAT1, MX1, OAS1, USP18, RSAD2, ISG15 and IFI44 were upregulated in the peripheral blood of IFN-\u03b12b-injected and SARS-CoV-infected ferrets. In contrast, OASL, OAS2 and SOCS1 were upregulated during SARS-CoV infection alone (Fig. 3A) . \n\nSince SARS-CoV infection causes severe lung pathology we went on to compare and contrast the genes upregulated by IFN-\u03b12b stimulation and SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of ferrets. Microarray analysis was performed on lung necropsies of IFN-\u03b12b-injected ferrets compared to controls. The peak gene expression occurred at day 2 with a total of 512 upregulated and 550 downregulated (P b 0.05) genes (Table 1) . Interestingly, the strongest upregulation of several IRGs, such as STAT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, IFI44, IFI44 ligand (IFI44L) and EIF2AK2, occurred on day 1 ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 1 ). There was a marked increase in the total number of regulated genes from lung necropsies of SARS-CoVinfected ferrets compared to lungs from IFN-\u03b12b-stimulated ferrets ( Table 1 ). The SARS-CoV infected ferrets had a peak in gene expression at day 1 with 4222 upregulated versus 1248 downregulated genes (P b 0.05). Both the number of upregulated IRGs and the expression levels peaked at day 1, including STAT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, IRF1, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1( IFIT1), IFI35, IFI44, IFI44L, proteasome subunit multifunctional beta 8 (PSMB8), EIF2AK2 and IFNRG1. JAK1 was the only IRG that was downregulated at day 1 (Fig. 2C ). The upregulation of STAT1, MX1, OAS1 and ISG15 was validated with qRT-PCR on lung necropsies of ferrets injected with IFN-\u03b12b or infected with SARS-CoV (Fig. 2D ). The comparison of microarray results between the lung tissue of IFN-\u03b12b and SARS-CoV ferrets at day 1 revealed commonalities in the expression patterns of most IRGs. STAT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, IFI44, IFI44L and EIF2AK2 were among the overlapping genes (Fig. 3B ).\n\nTo further model the pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV and the direct effects of IFN-\u03b12b administration, functional analysis of the regulated genes was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. For each experimental group, genes showing changes in their expression levels were mapped into highlevel Gene Ontology categories: cellular process, metabolic process, intracellular signaling cascade, cell cycle and immune response ( Table 1 ). The number of genes present in each functional category is representative of the level of biological activity in each experimental group with respect to the controls. Analysis of the IFN signaling canonical pathway showed the upregulation of STAT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15 and IFI44 in lung necropsies of IFN-\u03b12b injected and SARS-CoV infected ferrets (Fig. 4) .\n\nFunctional classification of upregulated genes showed that IFN-\u03b12b induces increased expression of phagocytosis-related genes, such as Fc fragment of IgG, high affinity Ia, receptor CD64 (FCGR1A) and dynamin 1-like (DNM1L), leukocyte transendothelial migration genes, such as integrins beta 1 and 2 (ITGB1 and ITGB2), and upregulation of chemokine receptors, chemokine C-C motif receptors 3, 7 and 9 (CCR3, CCR7, CCR9) and chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) (Supplementary Table 3 ). These results suggest that IFN-\u03b12b is able to activate specific functions of the leukocyte responses in blood samples after exposure.\n\nThe lungs of ferrets infected with SARS-CoV showed broader immune responses than IFN-\u03b12b-injected ferrets, as demonstrated by the higher number of regulated genes in several functional categories related to the activation of the immune responses, including: complement and coagulation, cell adhesion molecules and leukocyte activation (Fig. 5 ).\n\nType I IFNs are a critical component of the innate immune response during viral infections. The function of many downstream genes has been studied in-depth, however, it is likely that the presence of the virus and subsequent TLR-mediated signaling are required to deploy full IRG-mediated antiviral activity (Bosinger et al., 2009) . In this study we investigated the gene signatures induced following subcutaneous administration of IFN-\u03b12b in ferrets. We also analyzed the signaling pathways during an infection with SARS-CoV, and by means of comparative analysis we profiled IFN gene responses in the context of a respiratory infection. We used an experimental model of infection with SARS-CoV in ferrets, which causes mild symptoms without mortality. The pathological features of this model were previously published (Chu et al., 2008) and a summary of the clinical information can be found in the supplementary information (Supplementary Table 4 ).\n\nWe assessed the capacity of subcutaneous administration of IFN-\u03b12b to activate antiviral responses in ferrets. The activation levels of several intracellular signaling proteins were studied by using phospho-specific antibodies and subsequent FACS analysis. STAT1 plays a key role downstream of IFN signaling while STAT3 and STAT5 are thought to be involved at a lesser extent, and/or weak participation of STAT4, mitogen activated protein kinase 38 (p38) and Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) (Li et al., 2007) . In vitro incubation of ferret PBMCs with IFN-\u03b12b led to strong phosphorylation of STAT1, weak phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 and no phosphorylation of STAT4, p38 and ERK. Furthermore, the activation of the STAT1 signaling pathway in vitro was confirmed at the mRNA level with the presence of many downstream IRGs, including MX1, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, and IFI44. The in vivo effects of IFN-\u03b12b were also investigated. STAT1 showed increased phosphorylation levels in the peripheral blood at early hours post-injection, while STAT3 and STAT5 remained unchanged. Moreover, we did not observe mRNA gene expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) at the mRNA level (data not shown), suggesting that STAT3 (Gharavi et al., 2007) and STAT5 (Barclay et al., 2007) , respectively, do not participate in vivo in response to IFN-\u03b12b.\n\nThe global numbers of regulated genes found in the microarray results constitute good estimators of the intensity of the host response at different time-points. In vivo effects of IFN-\u03b12b can be observed 24 h after the injection and their peak is reached 48 h post-injection. IRGs are markedly increased in both blood and lung tissue, however the responses in the blood show greater breadth and magnitude as compared with the responses observed in lung tissue (Supplementary Table 2 ). This suggests that the administration protocol of IFN-\u03b12b used in this study is only capable of inducing a limited activation in lung tissue. Therefore, alternative protocols including direct administration of IFN-\u03b12b into the respiratory tract or subcutaneous administration at higher doses should be explored in order to achieve stronger antiviral responses at the infection sites. Gene expression during SARS-CoV infection, on the other hand, shows the presence of strong antiviral and inflammatory responses in the lungs 24 h postinfection, fading on day 2 post-infection in both blood and lung tissue.\n\nAs expected, IFN-\u03b12b stimulates the increased expression of a variety of IRGs that play a central role in the clearance of viral infections, including MX1, OAS1, OAS2 and ISG15. They exert their effects through different mechanisms of action, such as direct targeting of viral entry, inhibition of protein synthesis or degradation of viral RNA. MX1 is a dynamin-like large guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), which has antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses. The antiviral activity of MX1 is effective at the early stages of the viral cycle in the nucleus or cytoplasm (Haller et al., 2007) . OAS is an adenylate synthetase, which uses adenosine triphosphate to synthesize 2',5'-oligoadenylates. The latter activates latent RNase L that is involved in the degradation of viral RNA (Bonnevie-Nielsen et al., 2005) . ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like enzyme that covalently conjugates to a large number of cellular proteins; however this does not usually lead to protein degradation. In the case of HIV-1, ISG15 inhibits the release of virions (Okumura et al., 2006) .\n\nUpregulation of similar sets of IRGs by SARS-CoV and IFN-\u03b12b were observed, including 7 IRGs (STAT1, ISG15, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, IFI44 and IFI44L) in the peripheral blood and lung tissue of both groups. In contrast, several IRGs, including IFI35, IFIT1 and PSMB8, were only upregulated in the lungs during SARS-CoV infection. These results suggest that the expression of certain IRGs lie beyond the direct control of IFN-\u03b12b, and additional signals such as activation of TLR-signaling by viral components are probably required to assemble a fully functional antiviral response.\n\nAlthough the induction of IRGs by IFN-\u03b12b is the hallmark feature of IFN responses, a full understanding of the biological effects of antiviral IFNs requires a comprehensive study of the additional functional responses triggered by IFN-\u03b12b. In the blood of ferrets injected with IFN-\u03b12b, the upregulation of genes that participate in glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (e.g. acyl-CoA synthetases and lactate dehydrogenases) (Supplementary Table 3 ) are indicators of higher levels of metabolic activity. Moreover, IFN also induces the expression of genes related with apoptosis (e.g. caspases and TNFSF10) and cell cycle (e.g. cyclins and SMAD family members). It is unclear whether IFN-\u03b12b alone is capable of inducing apoptosis and/or cell replication in vivo, however, the upregulation of these genes may indicate that PBMCs are now more responsive to signals capable of triggering cell cycle events. Upregulation of chemokine receptors, such as CCR3, CCR7, CCR9 and CXCR4 may indicate that IFN-\u03b12b can increase the responsiveness of PBMCs to locally produced chemokines. Likewise, increased levels of genes that are involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration and Fc-gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Supplementary Table 3 ) suggest that IFN-\u03b12b enhances leukocyte responses (Corssmit et al., 1997) . Interestingly, a number of genes that are part to the Wnt signaling pathway were found to be upregulated (Supplementary Table 3 ). This indicates that in vivo administration of IFN-\u03b12b also has effects over lymphocyte maturation and differentiation (Staal et al., 2008) .\n\nThe lungs of ferrets infected with SARS-CoV show the upregulation of a broader variety of genes, as compared with IFN-\u03b12b administration, and depicts a more complex biological environment dominated by the antiviral responses, leukocyte infiltration and other inflammatory responses (Fig. 5B) . A number of chemokine ligands, such as chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL4, CCL14, CCL19 and CCL25, and cell adhesion molecules, such as activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) are upregulated during SARS-CoV infection, but these were not induced by the administration of IFN-\u03b12b ( Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 3) . SARS-CoV also induced the upregulation of genes of the complement system such as complement component 3 (C3) and complement factor B (CFB) (Fig. 5B) . Taken together, these results depict how IRGs and other arms of the innate immune responses are capable of resolving the respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV infection.\n\nPreviously, gene regulation has been investigated using microarray analysis with the intent on revealing molecular pathways imperative to H1N1 infection (Shapira et al., 2009 ). Here we investigated gene regulation of SARS-CoV infected and IFN-\u03b12b injected ferrets. Microarray analysis was conducted on RNA from lungs and blood on day 1 and day 2. The number of upregulated genes was quantified and compared to the number of downregulated genes for each sample type. The number of downregulated genes was greater than upregulated genes in the day 1 IFN-\u03b12b lungs and in the day 2 SARS-CoV infected blood samples. To expose the molecular signature of this finding we then broke down the genes from each group into their respective functional pathways: cellular process, metabolic process, intracellular signaling cascade, cell cycle, and immune response. Interestingly, we found that for every functional pathway the day 1 IFN-\u03b12b-injected lungs had more downregulated genes than upregulated genes (except the immune response) where blood samples from the same animals had the opposite trend of more upregulated genes. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-infected animals had the opposite trend where day 1 lungs had more upregulated genes and in the blood of day 2 there were more downregulated genes. These findings may be indicative of the activity of the stimulant IFN-\u03b12b compared to SARS-CoV. Moreover, the difference in the number of genes regulated shows that IFN-\u03b12b and SARS-CoV have different spatial stimulation which may be an important finding when determining the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-\u03b12b. It is possible that the increase in gene expression in the blood samples following IFN-\u03b12b injection is indicative of activation of systemic immunity where the SARS-CoV infection had an increase of lung gene expression signifying possible local inflammation.\n\nType I IFNs play a critical role during antiviral responses, however their functions in vivo have not yet been fully resolved. Additional research is required to define the optimal IRGs profile that is present during successfully cleared viral infections. Moreover, fine tuning of the IRGs responses may achieve more prolonged and wider protection by therapeutic agents such as attenuated vaccines against respiratory viruses.\n\nMale, 1 kg, 6-month-old ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were purchased from Marshall Farms Inc. (Oak Park, IL) and housed at the Toronto General Research Institute animal facility (Toronto, Canada) or at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL, USA). Ferrets were quarantined and monitored 5 days prior to tissue and blood collection. The ferrets' diet was based on a low fat/high protein regimen as recommended by Marshal Farms. Animal protocols were approved and monitored by the Animal Care Committee of the University Health Network or of the Southern research Institute.\n\nIn vitro blood stimulation with IFN-\u03b12b\n\nWhole blood was drawn from 4 ferrets and diluted \u00bc with cell culture media (Invitrogen, CA). Two ml of diluted blood from 4 animals was stimulated with 0.001 \u03bcg/ml IFN-\u03b12b (pegylated IFN-\u03b12b, Schering-Plough, Pointe-Claire, Canada) in separate wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C (5% CO 2 ) for 1 and 3 h. PBS was added to 3 control wells. The cultured blood was then harvested and injected to PaxGene tubes. RNA was purified according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, CA). One ml of blood stimulated with IFN-\u03b12b and or PBS was also added to 10 ml Lyse/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) for evaluation of phosphorylation status of signaling molecules at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min, using PhosFlow antibodies (BD Biosciences, USA) .\n\nSubcutaneous injections of 1 ml of PBS (control) or 1 \u03bcg/ml of IFN-\u03b12b were performed on the back of each ferret. Two ml of blood was collected directly into PaxGene tubes. One gram of the lung necropsy was added to TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen CA). Collected blood and lung tissues were used for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's protocol and used for microarray, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. One ml blood was added to Lyse/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for analysis of the signaling molecule phosphorylation status.\n\nFerrets were infected with SARS-CoV in the Animal Biohazard Safety Level 3 (ABSL3) facility at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL, USA), in accordance with the approved protocols. Three male ferrets, weighing approximately 800-1000 g, were infected intranasally with 10 3 TCID 50 SARS-CoV TOR2 strain (isolated from a patient in Toronto and sequenced at CDC, Vancouver, BC) in 1 mL PBS. An additional 3 animals were mock-infected with 1 mL PBS. Animals were anesthetized and blood and lung necropsies were collected for RNA purification. Infection of ferrets with the above mentioned dose results in weight loss, decreased activity, temperature increase and histology lesions with no mortality during the disease course (Chu et al., 2008) . A summary of natural history of ferrets infected with SARS-CoV has been provided as Supplementary Table 4 .\n\nOne ml of in vitro-stimulated blood with IFN-\u03b12b or PBS and/or 1 ml of blood drawn from the IFN-\u03b12b or PBS injected ferrets and/or 1 ml blood from infected ferrets with SARS-CoV or mock controls (in vivo) was added to 10 ml Lyse/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) and incubated in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 10 min. Tubes were then centrifuged at 300g for 5 min and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS. One ml Perm III (BD Biosciences, USA) was added to each tube and the tube was incubated on ice for 20 min to permeabilize cells for intracellular staining. Cells were washed with Perm/Wash (BD Biosciences, USA) and 10 6 cells were added to each tube for flow cytometry. Twenty microliters of phosphorylated (P)-STAT1, P-STAT3, P-STAT4, P-STAT5, P-p38 and P-ERK antibodies conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 488 was added to separate tubes (BD Biosciences, USA). Matched isotype control was added to one tube as a negative control. Tubes were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Cells were washed with cold Perm wash (BD Biosciences, USA) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Twenty thousand events were acquired with a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, USA) and data were analyzed, using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., USA).\n\nCloning and sequencing was performed as described previously . Briefly, purified RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Invitrogen RT-kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Genespecific degenerate primers were designed based on multiple gene sequence alignment analysis of several species using ClustalW (1.83) and then used to clone the cDNAs for each gene. Standard PCRs were performed and specific bands were gel-purified (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) and cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Sequences of positive clones were confirmed using an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The identification of genes was performed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analyses against National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. \n\nThe following components were added to the reaction mixture plus cDNA to a total volume of 10 \u03bcL in distilled water: 0.2 \u03bcl cDNA, 250 nmol forward gene-specific primer, 250 nmol reverse genespecific primer and 5 \u03bcL Cyber Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For every experiment, each reaction was performed in triplicate. An ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for amplification. Initial denaturation was 15 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of amplification. Each cycle consisted of a denaturation step (15 seconds at 95\u00b0C) and an annealing/extension step (1 min at 60\u00b0C). Expression levels were normalized to \u03b2-actin and data were analyzed by SDS 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\nBriefly, 0.5 \u03bcg of total RNA was isolated using Paxgene whole blood purification kits or TRIzol\u00ae reagent. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix two-cycle cRNA synthesis and IVT kits according to the manufacturer's protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). cRNA samples (20 \u03bcg) were labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 Arrays to monitor the gene expression of over 18,000 Canis familiaris mRNA/EST-based transcripts and over 20,000 non-redundant predicted genes. As described earlier, canine arrays were used following the observation of high levels of homology between canine and ferret nucleotide sequences (average of 89% identity) Rowe et al., 2010) . Supplementary Table 1 demonstrates the amino acid identity of genes in this study compared to available orthologues of human and mouse. The arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GCS3000 7G system according to standard Affymetrix protocols. Probe-level analysis was performed using Probe Logarithmic Error Intensity Estimate (PLIER). The raw intensity values for each individual target on the Affymetrix chips were pre-processed with variance stabilization, log 2 -transformation and were then normalized against the time zero datasets with ArrayAssist V 5.5.1 (Stratagene, USA). Student's t-tests or EDGE time course differential expression analysis (Storey et al., 2005) were performed with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Genes with a significant difference were selected for agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Pearson distance metrics and average linkage distance measurements between clusters using GeneLinker Platinum V 4.6.1 (Improved Outcomes Software, Kingston, Canada). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 5.0 software (Ingenuity Systems Inc., Redwood City, CA) was used to annotate and organize the gene expression data into networks and pathways. Pathways and functional categories were considered as over-represented when Fisher's exact test P value was \u22640.05. Datasets are publicly available at the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) accession number GSE22581.\n\nT tests or EDGE analyses were used for statistical analysis considering a biological filter of 1.5 fold change compared to controls and a P value of \u22640.05 as significant.\n\nSupplementary materials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.virol.2010.10.002."}
