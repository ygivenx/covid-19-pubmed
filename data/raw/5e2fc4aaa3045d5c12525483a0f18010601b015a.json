{"title": "Mobile ECMO team for inter-hospital transportation of patients with ARDS: a retrospective case series", "body": "The in-and out-of-hospital transport of the critically ill patient is a virtual risk of adverse clinical events also related to a potential equipment's failure (1) (2) (3) . Patient's safety is dependant on the adherence to transport's protocols (4, 5) . Patients af-fected by Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) present with hypoxia and instability of gases exchange, a situation which may require the use of extracorporeal respiratory support (ECMO -Extra Corporeal Membrane oxygenation) as an emergency life-saving therapy or as a protective strategy to prevent further barotraumas from mechanical ventilation (ALI -acute lung injury) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . In many cases, patients with ARDS should be referred to an ECMO centre, but the severe and often rapid onset of hypoxia, not manageable with conventional treatments, Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 may not allow for a safe conventional transport (11) (12) (13) (14) . The General Intensive Care of San Gerardo University Hospital-Monza has been working since 1989 as an Italian ECMO referring centre. Up to 2004, patients from different hospitals eligible for ECMO treatment were transported with conventional ventilation techniques by the same hospital's clinical team, increasing in this way risks related to unsafe transport. In 2004, inspired by similar programs carried out in other countries, we implemented and put in practice a new program of ECMO positioning at the reporting ICU and consequent inter-hospital transport of these patients (8, 11) . The basic team consist of two intensivists, an ICU nurse and a perfusionist. The aim of this paper is to present our 8-year experience on inter-hospital transport of patients with severe acute respiratory failure managed by our mobile transport team (which also has ECMO capability).\n\nFrom December 2004 to December 2012 we collected data concerning the activity of our Mobile ECMO team. All consecutive patients transferred by our mobile transport team were included in the study. Clinical records (Innovian Medical Suite \u00a9 -Drager Medical) and manual data sheets were retro- spectively reviewed. Due to the retrospective observational design of the study, informed consent was waived, according to Italian Regulations (AIFA, Directive of March 20, 2008) . Data from the fi rst 14 transports have previously been published (13) . All patient transfers were performed from local trust to San Gerardo Hospital (SGH) and subsequently admitted into our 10-bedded General ICU. The National Health insurance covered the expenses of the transport, and the average cost was 10.000,00\u20ac \u00b1 800,00 per transport (ambulance 720,00 \u20ac \u00b1278,00 -staff 2.500,00 \u20ac \u00b1780,00 -medical devices: 6.500,00 \u20ac \u00b1100,00). The alert protocol and procedure for patient eligible for ECMO treatment was based on phone call to our unit for the fi rst evaluation and commence for possible transport activation ( Figure 1) . Criteria for ECMO team activation were: reversible respiratory failure, PaO 2 value <50 mmHg with FiO 2 \u226560% for more 12 hours, Lung Injury Score \u22653; or respiratory acidosis pH \u22647.2 (13) . Exclusion criteria were: intracranial bleeding/haemorrhage, unable to undergoing to heparinization, negative prognosis,body weight \u2265130 Kg (logistic and equipment restrictions). The internal standard procedure, in case of positive assessment for transport, guarantee an ECMO crew activation time within 60 to 90 minutes after the distress call. The basic team includes two intensivists (MD), one Registered Nurse specialist (RN) and one perfusionist. When possible, a professional on training joined the mission for transport education. The transportation program began in 2004 based on experience gained by our ICU staff from in-hospital patient transport on extracorporeal support (14) . Since 1994, in hospital transfers were performed by a mobilization system able to house all the biomedical equipment. This tool underwent continuous evaluation to optimize logistics and performance (15) . This device is composed of an x-ray spine board compatible and multi-storey counter top. The pulmonary ventilator, the ECMO pump, syringe pumps and monitoring are placed on shelves. The counter top is equipped with an electrical junction box that provides power to all equipment by a single connection from the main electricity network. Figure 2 shows the system's structure and Figure 3 Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 Table 1 -Technical data of ambulances used in inter-hospital transports.\n\nTechnical data: Table 1 .\n\nThe gas circuit has 4 connections: 2 for oxygen and 2 for compressed air (UNI grafts), controlled by an electronic unit with automatic switching from one cylinder to another. A gas monitoring and alarm system is in situ to check the working pressure and the residual gas availability. In case of electric failure it is possible to switch into manual pneumatic dispensing delivery of the gases. In order to reduce risks and guarantee the best comfort during transfer from ground to ambulance floor, the vehicle is equipped with a stretcher supported with hydro pneumatic suspension (model: STEM-Piuma \u00ae ). In addition to oxygen and compressed air, it is possible to deliver nitric oxide via cylinder 10 L volume/200 ATM pressure via a nitric system. An additional vehicle transports the rest of the crew and equipment. All the equipment required to perform the cannulation and transport has been split into three bags. All the materials ( As far as the veno-venous support (twosites approach) is concerned, a drainage percutaneous cannula-multistage type was usually positioned in the left femoral vein and a percutaneous no multistage-cannula type was used for the reinfused blood, to avoid blood recirculation. Two types of centrifugal pump have been used: Rotaflow \u00ae and Cardiohelp \u00ae System. The first choice was the two-site veno-venous approach to allow for quick weaning from sedative drugs and an early mobilization of the patient (9) . All the cannulations were performed via percutaneous approach, using real-time ultrasound and a dilatation modified technique to reduce the enlargement stages (16) . At the time of arrival of the ECMO team, the following procedures were carried out : patient assessment and optimization of the ventilator setting (recruitment manoeuvre, lung protective ventilation with tidal volumes <6ml/Kg, trial of inhaled Nitric\n\nOxide, apparatus dead space reduction by removal of mount connector or HME (heat and moisture exchange), close suctioning system and continuous EtCO 2 monitoring) (17) (18) (19) , to evaluate the safety and feasibility of patient transport with \"conventional\" ventilation (i.e. without ECMO). Criteria for transport with \"conventional\" ventilation were: pO 2 >90 mmHg with FiO 2 = 1, pCO 2 <65 mmHg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) <20 cmH 2 O. If these criteria were not met or in case for any reason a transport with \"conventional\" ventilation was not judged safe, an ECMO support was started on site and the patients were transferred on ECMO.\n\nAfter the ECMO support has been established, the minute ventilation is gradually (departure from and back to SGH) was equal to 508 minutes (\u00b1185 with range of 120-960 minutes). The longest distance of 1044 km was performed by transportation of the ambulance and team on the 'Hercules C 130' aircraft provided by the Italian Air Force. No mission was postponed or cancelled due to organizational failure or extreme weather conditions. For 28 (67%) transports, transfer pulmonary ventilator EVITA \u00ae (4 or XL -Dr\u00e4ger Medical) were used, while in 13 cases (31%) SERVO I \u00ae Maquet ventilator was the choice; and only for the first transport the Siemens SERVO 300 \u00ae ventilator was used. The median number of syringe pumps used during transport was 4 (IQR 3-4/range 2-6). The median number of inotropic drugs (Dopamine, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine) administered during transport was equal to 1 (IQR 0-1/range 0-1). We did not report any morbidity or mortality due to the transport or to the ECMO support on transfer.\n\nThe following complications were observed: in one patient battery failure of Evita XL\u00ae ventilator during transport from the ICU to the ambulance; in another case it was difficult to obtain an acceptable extracorporeal flow due to the patient's position and it was necessary to stop the ambulance to reposition the patient. No patient required transfusion of blood products during transport. The average days on ECMO were equal to 18.21 (\u00b122.96 -range 2/116). The average length of stay in ICU was 26.07 days (\u00b127.96 -range 2/126). 33 patients (79%) were discharged alive from SGH, 9 died in the ICU (21%). All patients who died were transported with ECMO support: no patient died during transport, but they all died while still on ECMO. In the group of patients who required ECMO support, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate differences between survivors and non-survivors with regard to: pre-ECMO ventilation days, days on ECMO and length of hospital stay. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the duration of mechanical ventilation before the activation of the ECMO team: in survivors the median of pre-ECMO ventilation days was 2 (IQR:1-4) while in non-survivors was equal to 8 days (IQR:3-13) (p=0.04). Table 4 collects data of all patients related to pre-transfer, data collected on arrival to SGH and the ones related to patients transferred on ECMO versus no ECMO support.\n\nThe early commence of ECMO support provides an extra source of recovery for patients who develop an acute respiratory failure not responding to standard strategy of care; furthermore for long ventilated patients, the ECMO support let to perform respiratory tidal volume less than 6 ml/kg and low respiratory rate. Many patients referred for ECMO treatment cannot take benefits from this advanced support due to high risks of death related to an ordinary transfer based on standard respiratory setting. Implementing the ECMO cannulation standards outside of SGH required several steps. The first transport required two days of preparation to assemble the equipment and suitable staff. The ambulance choice required a strict collaboration between ICU staff, ambulance crew and the SGH medical physics dept., to get through/to rule out all the technical issues related to the vehicle (electricity power supply and medical gas circuit). The nursing staff that carried out the transport was trained on fieldwork by tutoring, which was held after the first transport, according to the literature (20, 21) . In order to be qualified for transport, these are the minimum requirements: two years experience in ICU, 2 in hospital cannulation, 2 in intra-hospital transport experience and two out of hospital missions supervised by a qualified nurse. The nursing staff education (theoretical and practical) was managed by the head nurse and a senior qualified nurse. To sort out the mission different paper-work (flow charts and checklists) were created in order to verify the equipments (22, 23) . Patients included in this report had an average severe hypoxia (pO 2 : 64.96\u00b118.15 mmHg). Despite their respiratory instability, the cardiovascular status of patients was stable. The transport described above requireed a great preparation time compared with traditional techniques. Benefits of this system involve the absence of extra adjustments after this stage, so patient will be ready to be transported straight to ambulance, furthermore after positioning in the back, there is no need to rearrange any equipment (syringe pumps ,circuit, ventilator) because they are already settled, reducing the time of transfer and possible complications according to the literature (13, 14) . All the equipment's packs for transport are dedicated to ECMO transports only (24) . It makes easier to perform the quality checks and battery packs levels. These are relevant facts, identified as the most responsible in the case of adverse events such as battery failure (25, 26) . Finally, it is important to point out our attitude and confidence, as referral centre, in using intensive care ventilators to perform ECMO transport compared with dedicated transport's ventilator (27, 28 (30) ; b) since the number of ventilation days before ECMO institution is clearly related to survival, it is of paramount importance that all patients deemed eligible for ECMO treatment are referred as early as possible to a specialized ICU. These data is similar to those published by all centers related to Italian \"ECMOnet\" (12) .\n\nIn addition, it must be underlined the importance of clinical stabilization of the patients before transport (29) . The number of adverse events observed in our patients during transport were comparable to those reported by other centers or networks that have implemented similar programs aimed at the centralization of ECMO candidates (7, 8, 12, 30) .\n\nThe main limitation of this study is related to retrospective analysis. Data were collected from medical records and it was not possible to get back all the clinical data for each patient prior to ambulance transfer. For this reason, we could not compare the different subgroups with regard to severity scores (like SOFA or APACHE) or to the incidence of other comorbidities. However, our goal was only to report our 8-years experience of inter-hospital transportation of critically ill patients and to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of a \"Mobile ECMO team\" program. We are now performing a prospective study with capillary recording of all relevant clinical variables, in order to perform adequate comparison between different groups of patients; in addition, we are planning to perform a follow-up analysis to investigate the quality of life of surviving patients.\n\nAnalysis of risk factors and a plan for actions allow to improve a program for ECMO transport of persons affected by ALI or ARDS to a referring centre. In order to achieve this goal, four factors seem to be crucial: identification of a vehicle with specific tech features, systematic and precise settings of equipment, a toolsystem to sort out equipment and a dedicated training program for nurses involved in these missions."}
