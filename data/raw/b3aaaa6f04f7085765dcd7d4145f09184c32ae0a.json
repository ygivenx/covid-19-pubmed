Over the past year, Zika virus has emerged as a major threat in the Americas, including the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/ index.html).\n\nThus, there are many reasons it is important for every pediatrician to be familiar with extant and emerging pathogens from across the globe. First, we are a single globe, and health and wellness is our concern worldwide. Second, whether or not the pathogen is currently in the United States, it could easily arrive here-and thrive.\n\nThis issue of Pediatric Clinics of North America effectively summarizes a vast literature updating the health care provider on familiar infectious diseases and describing those that are newly recognized, emerging, and/or migrating.
