{"title": "Assessing the risks of introduced chickens and their pathogens to native birds in the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago", "body": "The Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, located approximately 1000 km west of continental Ecuador (Fig. 1) , is renowned for its endemic Xora and fauna whose study has greatly inXuenced modern evolutionary theory (Darwin, 1859; Grant and Grant, 2003) . From the 19th century to the present, human activities, including the introduction of invasive animal and plant species, have negatively impacted Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystems (Snell et al., 2002; MacFarland and Cifuentes, 1996) . In other island ecosystems, such as Hawaii, anthropogenic introduction of exotic vertebrate and invertebrate species is linked to the emergence of infectious disease (e.g., avian malaria and avian pox) and subsequent decline in many native bird species (Van Riper III et al., 1986; Atkinson et al., 1995) .\n\nDisease carried by any bird species introduced to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (chickens Gallus gallus, pigeons Columba livia, smooth-billed anis Crotophaga ani, Guinea fowl Numida meleagridis, and farmyard ducks of genus Cairina or Anas) may threaten its native avifauna, comprising 58 resident species (22 endemic and 36 native). However, little published information is available on diseases present in domestic, introduced, or native birds in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago (Wikelski et al., 2004) . Chickens (G. gallus) and pigeons (C. livia) are the principal avian species introduced to the Gal\u00e1pagos by human colonists. Feral pigeons have inhabited Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, and Isabela islands. Current eradication eVorts are rapidly reducing the numbers of introduced pigeons (Phillips et al., 2003) .\n\nIn contrast, the numbers of domestic chickens are increasing in inhabited areas of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Domestic chickens are present on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, Floreana, and Baltra ( Fig. 1 ). Three types of poultry farming are practiced on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands: smallscale backyard meat chickens (1-40 birds per farm) (Fig. 2) , small to medium-scale egg layers, and medium to relatively large-scale commercial broiler operations (2000-4000 birds) (Fig. 3) . Currently, there are 23 broiler chicken farms on Santa Cruz, 6 on San Cristobal, and 4 on Isabela. In the past Wve to ten years, poultry production has intensiWed due to demand from the growing human population and tourist industry. Under Gal\u00e1pagos law, broiler chickens, brought to Gal\u00e1pagos at 1-5 days of age, must be unvaccinated and certiWed as healthy by approved aviculture facilities on the Ecuadorian mainland. Currently, no livestock vaccinations are permitted on the Galapagos Islands (David Cruz, SIC-GAL, personal communication). Feral populations of chickens exist on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, and Floreana. In addition to the risk of introducing disease into native Galapagos avifauna, waste from domestic poultry operations may have detrimental eVects on local plant and animal communities in the Galapagos due to nutrient enrichment and water contamination. In 2001, the Saint Louis Zoo and the University of Missouri -St. Louis, in cooperation with the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station, initiated an avian disease surveillance program in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This monitoring serves to identify pathogens that pose a particular risk to native populations and helps to target certain pathogens for future disease surveillance. A similar approach to identifying high-risk pathogens has been performed for killer whales (Orcinus orca) (Gaydos et al., 2004) . Here, we present results of poultry disease surveys from 2001 to 2003 in relation to their threat to native birds, discuss ecological threats of broiler aviculture and backyard chickens to Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystems, identify disease research priorities, and discuss potential strategies for the control and prevention of disease transmission to native birds.\n\nBetween July of 2001 and September of 2003, 55 domestic chickens were collected from 6 premises on Santa Cruz and 45 were collected from 7 premises on San Cristobal. Birds were collected for avian necropsy workshops. In addition, blood was collected in November 2003 from 72 broiler chickens on four relatively large-scale (1000-3000 chickens) poultry farms and one medium-scale (50-100 chickens) backyard operation on San Cristobal.\n\nAfter physical examination, a blood sample was taken from the ulnar vein. Fresh blood smears were prepared, Wxed, and stained using a modiWed Wright-Giemsa staining technique (DiV Quick) and evaluated for the presence of hemoparasites (Antech Diagnostics-Chicago, Alsip IL 60903, USA). Blood was collected in lithium heparin tubes. Plasma aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen in the Weld and transferred to \u00a170\u00b0C ultrafreezer before serologic testing. Plasma from birds collected between July 2001 and September 2003 was antibody tested for the following diseases (antibody testing method in parenthesis): inXuenza A/avian inXuenza (agar gel immunodiVusion -AGID); avian adenovirus group II/hemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys (AGID); avian paramyxovirus I/Newcastle disease (hemagglutination inhibition -HI); Pasteurella multocida (fowl cholera) (microscopic agglutination -MA); Mycoplasma gallisepticum (hemagglutination inhibition -HI); Salmonella typhimurium (tube agglutination) and Salmonella pullorum (tube agglutination) at the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Missouri -Columbia, Columbia, MO 65205. Further aliquots were antibody tested for avian encephalomyelitis (AGID), avian adenovirus group-I (AGID), Marek's disease virus (AGID), infectious bursal disease virus (AGID), avian paramyxoviruses 2 and 3 (HI), and avian reovirus (immunoXourescent antibody testing) at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA 50010. The 100 birds collected for the necropsy workshops were euthanized humanely by intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium euthanasia solution (Beuthanasia-D Special, Schering Plough Animal Health Corporation, Union, NJ 07083, USA). Complete post-mortem examinations (gross and microscopic examination) were performed on all birds except those from the November 2003 collections in San Cristobal, where only serum was taken. Representative samples of major organs were Wxed in 10% neutral buVered formalin (Wxed tissue samples were transferred to ethanol to facilitate international transportation). Tissues were routinely processed for light microscopic histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin staining) at the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Columbia, MO 65205, USA. Subsequent samples were routinely processed at AXXIS and Astrid Rhon laboratories, Quito, Ecuador. Tissues from each bird were examined by a veterinary pathologist (T.W., N.G.) for microscopic lesions. In one bird, further par-aYn sections were evaluated for Toxoplasma gondii antigen using polyclonal antibody 125P (GioGenex, San Ramon, CA 94583) and streptavidin, and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) chromagen detection. Appropriate positive and negative controls were run simultaneously. Helminths and ectoparasites retrieved during necropsy were placed in 10% formalin and transferred to absolute ethanol or placed directly in ethanol for examination. Preserved specimens were identiWed by a parasitologist (M. Dailey). In some cases, parasites were only present in histologic sections and they were identiWed as morphological features allowed. Therefore, sample sizes for evaluation of prevalence of particular parasites diVered between parasites.\n\nBased on results from July of 2001, 2002, and September of 2003, seropositivity was identiWed for the following pathogens (number positive/total examined, %): infectious bursal disease (22/58, 38%), M. gallisepticum (14/38, 37%), Avian adenovirus type I (46/57, 81%), Marek's disease (10/23, 43%), avian encephalomyelitis (10/24, 42%), infectious bronchitis virus -Massachussetts strain (4/24, 17%), infectious bronchitis virus -Connecticut strain (2/24, 8%), and C. psittaci (1/10, 10%). Chickens from this sample pool were serologically negative for avian cholera, avian inXuenza, avian adenovirus II, Newcastle disease (Avian Paramyxovirus-1), avian paramyxovirus 2 and 3, S. pullorum, S. typhimurium, and infectious tenosynovitis virus (Table 1 ). In subsequent serologic tests of chickens from farms on San Cristobal Island in November 2003 using a diVerent diagnostic laboratory and test than the previous samples, seroreactivity for Newcastle disease was detected on three out of Wve farms with 16 out of 72 birds positive (22.2%). Seropositivity for M. gallisepticum was detected in 5 out of 12 chickens on one farm from the November 2003 samples; the other farms were negative. Regarding other serologic tests from chicken farms from November 2003, seropositivity was detected for infectious bursal disease (30/72, 41.7%), infectious bronchitis virus (33/72, 45.8%), and infectious tenosynovitis virus (49/72, 68%). Antibodies for avian inXuenza were not detected in any of the broiler farms (Table 1) .\n\nOn histopathology, fowlpox was identiWed in 6% (6/ 100) and Macrorhabdus sp., a fungal enteric pathogen (Tomaszewski et al., 2003) , in 10.5% (6/57) of chickens examined. A systemic infection with T. gondii was also identiWed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry in the one chicken we tested.\n\nNo hemoparasites were detected on examination of blood smears. Parasites identiWed grossly or histologically include the following (number positive/total number examined, %infected): the conjunctival nematode Pathogens detected in this study, documented pathogenicity in wild birds, and native Gal\u00e1pagos species at risk are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nPathology and serology studies from 2001 to 2003 show evidence of a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases in introduced chickens of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Although some diseases are chicken-speciWc, many pathogens identiWed are not species-speciWc and pose an imminent threat to native avifauna. Seropositivity was detected for 11 of 18 chicken pathogens tested and eight of these pathogens were detected in over 15% of chickens tested. This relatively high pathogen prevalence may be due in part to sample bias. Most chickens in this study appeared clinically normal. However, eight of 172 chickens in this study were clinically ill and many of the samples collected in the July 2001 to September 2003 surveys included chickens from farms with a history of disease, thus potentially over-estimating the true prevalence of disease among the Gal\u00e1pagos domestic chicken population. Additionally, broiler chickens may be seropositive not due to previous or current infection, (1971) and Calnek (2003) Unknown: antibodies reported in waved albatross (Padilla et al., 2003 Uyttebroek and Ducatelle (1990) , Lumeij (1999) and Tomaszewski et al. (2003) Darwin's Wnches, yellow warblers, mockingbirds, yellow-billed cuckoo, Gal\u00e1pagos and Vermillion Xycatchers but due to vaccination of adults on the islands or of chicks purchased from broiler suppliers on the Ecuadorian continent, despite the prohibition on vaccination.\n\nAlthough potential sample bias may overestimate the true prevalence of pathogens in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, we believe that, in the presence of uncertainty, slight overestimation of disease prevalence is prudent when evaluating the potential of disease transmission from domestic poultry to Gal\u00e1pagos endemic avifauna, many of which have naturally small populations. A large proportion of chickens from pooled samples from July 2001 to November 2003 were seroreactive for avian adenovirus I (81%), infectious bronchitis virus (41%), infectious tenosynovitis virus (51%), Marek's disease (43%), avian encephalomyelitis (42%), and infectious bursal disease (40%). In Argentina, adenovirus antibody prevalence similar to that in our study was associated with poor hygienic conditions on commercial poultry farms (Gonzalez et al., 1978) . The seroprevalence for infectious bronchitis virus in our study resembled that in backyard poultry operations in villages of the Yucatan Peninsula (56%) and may be a common cause of respiratory disease in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens as well (Gutierrez-Ruiz et al., 2000) . Comparable serologic results were also seen for Avian encephalomyelitis presence in fancy chickens from Switzerland. In this study, relatively high pathogen prevalence was associated with close contact and group rearing of similar chicken age classes (Wunderwald and Hoop, 2002) .\n\nOur study shows serologic evidence of Newcastle Disease in chickens from San Cristobal Island. Newcastle disease shows high pathogenicity in many species that are related to Gal\u00e1pagos endemics. Newcastle disease causes high mortality in the double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritis (Docherty and Friend, 1999; Banerjee et al., 1994; Wobeser et al., 1993) , a congener of the Xightless cormorant Phalacrocorax harrisi. In 1992 and 2000, disease outbreaks attributed to velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease caused the death of over 2000 and 500 chickens, respectively, on Santa Cruz Island. Disease eradication plans were implemented by selective culling (Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganader\u00eda, Direcci\u00f3n Provincial Agropecuaria de Gal\u00e1pagos). However, antibodies to Newcastle disease were not detected in Santa Cruz chickens tested in our study. Explanations for this Wnding include potential false negative serotests, low sample size, and local eradication of disease during the outbreak of 1999-2000. Newcastle disease antibodies were detected in broiler chickens from San Cristobal in November 2003 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the chickens tested appeared relatively normal, necropsy Wndings on abbatoir chickens from the seropositive Xock are consistent with a Newcastle disease strain of low to moderate pathogenicity. Potential sources of Newcastle disease virus are domestic pigeons (Alexander, 2003) , contaminated equipment (Alexander, 1988) , illegal transport of cock-Wghting birds between islands, migratory birds, or introduction of infected birds or poultry products from the Ecuadorian mainland.\n\nNewcastle disease has the potential to cause high mortality and morbidity in wild and domestic birds. Gulls, pelicans, penguins, and cormorants are among the highly susceptible groups of wild birds (Docherty and Friend, 1999) . Consequently, lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), Xightless cormorants (P. harrisi) and Gal\u00e1pagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), endemic species with small population sizes (<1500 individuals), may be particularly susceptible to infection. A 1997 outbreak of a highly pathogenic strain of Newcastle disease caused nesting failure and more than 2000 deaths in a doublecrested cormorant colony in the Salton Sea, southern California (Docherty and Friend, 1999) . Clearly, Newcastle disease, present in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, has the potential to cause severe decline or extinction of the Xightless cormorant population. Continued surveys of domestic chickens and wild birds for Newcastle disease as well as the isolation, molecular characterization and pathogenicity typing of Newcastle disease strains present on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are necessary to prevent and manage the disease.\n\nM. gallisepticum, serologically detected in many chickens, causes respiratory disease in birds (Klemen, 2003) . Certain strains of M. gallisepticum can cause high morbidity and mortality in members of the Fringillidae, in particular house Wnches (Carpodacus mexicanus) and American goldWnches (Carduelis tristis) (Hartup et al., 2001) . A variant of M. gallisepticum associated with domestic poultry or pen-reared wild turkeys (Luttrell et al., 2001) has caused severe conjunctivitis in house Wnches (C. mexicanus), resulting in population declines (Dhondt et al., 1998; Pillai et al., 2003) . Although antibodies to M. gallisepticum were detected in two wild Gal\u00e1pagos passerines (Ricaurte, 1994) , susceptibility to mycoplasmal infection of native Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna is unknown. Conjunctivitis, sinusitis, and rhinitis of undetermined etiology have been observed in Wnches and mockingbirds on Isabela and Santa Cruz (Jim\u00e9nez and Gottdenker, personal observation). Studies are underway to identify if Mycoplasma sp. or other respiratory pathogen is involved in the etiology of this disease.\n\nFowlpox virus was conWrmed in chickens by gross necropsy, histopathology, and molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction and sequencing). Molecular sequencing data from avian pox lesions in domestic and wild birds from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands indicate that the poxvirus present in chickens (fowlpox virus) diVers greatly from that in wild passerines (Thiel et al., 2005) . Although transmission of poxvirus from chickens to Gal\u00e1pagos passerines is unlikely, there is the possibility of recombination of chicken and passerine poxvirus strains, potentially altering virulence. Moreover, Thiel et al. (2005) detected signiWcant recombination between ancestors of the strains found within Gal\u00e1pagos passerines and between these strains and Canarypox.\n\nSerologic results indicate that poultry on both Santa Cruz and San Cristobal Islands have been exposed to infectious bursal disease (IBD). IBD is a Birnavirus that causes necrosis of the lymphoid tissues (Sivanandan and Maheswaran, 1980; Lukert and Saif, 2003) resulting in immunosuppression that allows the emergence of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (Charlton, 2000) . Relatively high antibody titers to IBD were detected in herring gulls in the Baltic Sea (Hollmen et al., 2000) and free-ranging Antarctic penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae and Aptenodyes forsteri) (Gardner et al., 1997) . It remains unknown whether IBD is pathogenic to endemic birds such as lava gulls (L. fuliginosus) and Gal\u00e1pagos penguins (S. mendiculus). Regardless, a very pathogenic strain of IBD has recently invaded South America (Enzo and Yannick, 2003) . If introduced to Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, this strain may cause proliferation of a variety of pathogens in domestic Xocks that may spillover into wild bird populations. Furthermore, penguins and Xightless cormorants may have contact with infected chicken products via increasing tourist and Wshing activities in Western Gal\u00e1pagos and local migrants such as yellow warblers that may carry the disease from inhabited to uninhabited regions. Diseases such as infectious bursal disease as reported in Antarctic penguins (Gardner et al., 1997) could be transmitted to these populations by contact with chicken waste.\n\nAlthough infectious bronchitis virus, identiWed serologically in 42.8% (33/77) chickens on San Cristobal, is considered to be relatively species-speciWc, seropositivity has been recorded in several wild bird species including prairie chickens Tympanuchus cupido (Peterson et al., 2002) , rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome (Karesh et al., 1999) , pheasants Phasianus colchicus, and pigeons C. livia (Barr et al., 1988) . It is not known if infectious bronchitis virus is pathogenic in native Gal\u00e1pagos birds.\n\nPositive serotiters to Marek's disease, a herpesvirus, were identiWed in 43.5% (10/23) of the chickens necropsied. Antibodies to Marek's disease had previously been observed in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens (Vargas and Snell, 1997) . Experimental studies suggest that the only wild bird species susceptible to Marek's disease would be in the Order Galliformes (Pradhan et al., 1985; Cho and Kenzy, 1975) . There are no native galliform species in the Gal\u00e1pagos, therefore the risk of Marek's disease is low. Indeed, a study of Marek's disease on the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin in 1996 gave negative results (Miller et al., 2001) .\n\nAlthough many parasites identiWed in this study are chicken-speciWc, the nematodes O. mansoni, Capillaria sp., Dispharynx sp., and Tetrameres sp. are likely to aVect a variety of avian species (Permin and Hansen, 1998) . D. proglottina, identiWed in some chickens, may cause enteritis in wild birds (Permin and Hansen, 1998) . Capillaria sp. present in chickens may infect a variety of avian species, causing high levels of mortality in heavy infections (Barnes, 1986) . Many species of North American passerines are highly susceptible to infection with the proventricular nematode (Dispharynx sp.) (Rickard, 1985) (Table 2 ). In heavy infections, Dispharynx sp. can cause illness, particularly in juvenile birds (Rickard, 1985; Forrester and Spalding, 2003) . A number of mortalities in Gal\u00e1pagos dark billed cuckoos were attributed to Dispharynx spiralis (Vargas and Bensted-Smith, 2000) . Because Dispharynx has a large host range, poultry may not be the only source of potential infection for Gal\u00e1pagos endemics, as diVerent species or subspecies of this parasite may have been present on the Gal\u00e1pagos before the introduction of chickens. Regardless, heavy infections of Dispharynx sp. in chickens, combined with an abundance of suitable intermediate hosts (e.g., isopods), may be a source of infection for native birds.\n\nT. gondii, identiWed in one chicken, is an apicomplexan parasite capable of infecting a wide variety of animals, including wild birds (Work et al., 2000; Dubey, 2002) reptiles, and mammals. DeWnitive hosts are restricted to the family Felidae, particularly the domestic cat (Felis domesticus). Consumption of oocysts from cat feces is the typical route of exposure, although ingestion of undercooked infected meat products can result in infection (Tenter et al., 2000) . This Wnding is signiWcant, because it indicates the potential for toxoplasmal infections in wild Gal\u00e1pagos birds, as feral cats are abundant on inhabited islands.\n\nThere was no serologic evidence for avian inXuenza in poultry populations of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal. Shorebirds, gulls, and waterfowl are natural hosts for avian inXuenza (Suarez, 2002) . Many passerine species are susceptible to pathogenic infection with the chicken/ Hong Kong H5N1 strain of avian inXuenza (Perkins and Swayne, 2003) . Due to the emergence of avian inXuenza in the poultry industry and its worldwide threat to avian and human public health (Hatta and Kawaoka, 2002) , it is important to continue surveillance for avian inXuenza on the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago.\n\nProtozoan hemoparasites such as Plasmodium, Haemoproteus or Leucocytozoon, were not detected in any chickens. However, continued monitoring of poultry and wild birds for these diseases is important, because black Xies (Simuliidae), an intermediate host for leucocytozoonosis, and Culex quinquefasciatus, a vector of avian malaria and avian pox, have been introduced onto the Gal\u00e1pagos (Mouchet et al., 1995; Peck et al., 1998; Whiteman et al., in press ). The introduction of C. quinquefasciatus on Hawaii is associated with the emergence of avian malaria and avian pox in wild bird populations (Van Riper III et al., 1986; Fonseca et al., 2000) . C. quinquefasciatus is also a vector of arboviral diseases such as West Nile virus (Dohm et al., 2002) . Four randomly chosen chickens from the necropsy group tested negative for antibodies to West Nile virus. Although there is currently no evidence of West Nile virus introduction into the Gal\u00e1pagos, domestic chickens may be a sentinel (Langevin et al., 2001) should this, or other viruses, expand their range to the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago.\n\nThe most common types of poultry raising practices are small-scale backyard chickens and moderate to large-scale broiler production facilities. Backyard chickens are hatched and raised on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, while broiler chickens are transported to the archipelago at one day to one week of age and subsequently grown to market age (6 weeks). Both husbandry strategies present a threat to native and endemic Gal\u00e1pagos birds.\n\nBackyard poultry often have higher macroparasite loads than broiler chickens and may thus provide a source for infection of wild birds attracted to available feed and water. Backyard chickens and Wnches often share feeding areas (Fig. 2) . Outbreaks of respiratory disease are common in backyard chickens, and often rapidly spread to neighboring homes and farms (Gutierrez-Ruiz et al., 2000) , in part due to their relative mobility. Illegal trade in Wghting chickens from mainland Ecuador and between islands is also a potential mechanism for introduction of pathogens such as virulent strains of Newcastle disease into domestic broiler and backyard Xocks. However, backyard chickens may be more resistant to infectious disease due to hybrid vigor.\n\nTheoretically, chicks should arrive relatively healthy to the Gal\u00e1pagos, but in reality they may be incubating directly, neonatally, or transovarially transmitted infectious diseases. It is also diYcult and expensive to monitor the certiWed aviculture companies on the Ecuadorian mainland for diseases that pose a threat to wild birds. Implementation of biosecurity protocols in broiler facilities that minimize contact with wild birds is relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, many broiler houses on the Gal\u00e1pagos do not follow strict biosecurity protocols and have inadequate broiler house construction, allowing for direct contact between some native bird species. Unlike backyard chickens living in relatively low densities, high densities in broiler farms may increase contact rates between infected individuals and provide a highly concentrated pathogen source, facilitating disease spread to wild birds and backyard chickens. Additionally, high concentrations of poultry in broiler houses may provide an ideal opportunity for recombination to occur between strains of a pathogen, potentially resulting in the emergence of a pathogen with increased virulence for other avian species.\n\nIn addition to introduced pathogens, intensiWed poultry production on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands may cause local ecological disturbances. Most broiler farmers on the Gal\u00e1pagos apply used litter to their agricultural Welds. In the Southeastern U.S., the application of broiler litter to pastures has been associated with environmental nitrogen contamination. Over-application of poultry litter to agricultural Welds may cause leaching of nitrate into groundwater (Andres, 1995; Gordillo and Cabrera, 1997) . Increased nitrogen load may alter plant community composition and successional dynamics (Tilman, 1987) . Higher soil nitrogen levels may facilitate the growth of detrimental invasive species present in the Gal\u00e1pagos, such as blackberry (Rubus sp.). Additionally, a change in plant species composition or vegetation structure may also alter avian bird community composition (Wilson and Belcher, 1989) and nesting success (Remes, 2003) . Improperly composted broiler litter may also facilitate the spread of potential bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens to wild birds.\n\nBroiler farms also require large quantities of water, a limited resource in Gal\u00e1pagos. Water reservoirs at broiler farms could also provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and thus increase the potential of vectorborne disease transmission. Future research on the impact of Gal\u00e1pagos broiler farms on disease threats and ecosystem processes is important to natural resource management and environmental conservation. In the meantime, practices that minimize negative ecological impacts and disease spread from poultry litter (e.g., mandatory composting) should be implemented.\n\nPigeons (C. livia) are being eradicated on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, in part due to their potential for disease transmission and public health threats. Chickens also harbor infectious diseases that pose a risk to native bird populations and human public health on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. However, eradication of all chickens on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is an economic, political, and social impossibility. The growing human population and burgeoning tourist industry of the Gal\u00e1pagos depend on chickens as a source of protein and/or income.\n\nImproved health management of Gal\u00e1pagos chickens can prevent the introduction of potentially devastating infectious diseases. For example, Newcastle disease, historically and serologically present in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, may cause high poultry mortality and decline or extinction in endangered native birds, such as the Xightless cormorant. A policy decision needs to be made whether to eradicate or control Newcastle disease on the Gal\u00e1pagos. Vaccination of poultry Xocks is controversial, because animal vaccination is prohibited in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Vaccines can control, but not eradicate Newcastle disease, and could result in transfer of Newcastle disease to wild bird species if modiWed-live or live vaccines are used. From the perspective of wild bird conservation, Newcastle disease eradication would be the best management strategy. Test and slaughter programs in order to eradicate Newcastle disease in Gal\u00e1pagos poultry should be considered. However, eradication strategies are politically and economically diYcult because funds are needed to compensate farmers for the deaths of birds that test positive. Furthermore, disease eradication strategies have the potential to cause the avicultural sector to mistrust local disease control programs, hindering further disease reporting, investigation, and control. Before eradication plans are implemented, the strains, pathogenicity, and possible origins of Newcastle disease present in Gal\u00e1pagos poultry should be identiWed, and poultry producers must be educated regarding disease control strategies. In order to better evaluate the pathogenicity of disease on endemic Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, ex situ experimental infection of endemic birds (e.g., ground Wnches) with pathogens isolated from Gal\u00e1pagos chickens would be ideal, but small population sizes preclude disease transmission studies in endemics such as the mangrove Wnch, medium tree Wnch, Xightless cormorant, and Gal\u00e1pagos penguin.\n\nCurrently, avian disease surveillance programs in the Gal\u00e1pagos monitor wild bird populations for poultryborne and other infectious diseases. Results of these studies will guide avian disease management policies on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Further studies are also needed regarding the eVects of broiler operations on local ecosystems. Regardless, eradication, prevention, and control of disease and ecological eVects of poultry production on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands rely on well designed, scientiWcally based government policies and local community participation. These policies must be Xexible, vigilant (e.g., unexpected introduction of avian inXuenza), transparent to the general public, and quick to respond to emergency situations. Viable economic alternatives to high-intensity broiler production on the Gal\u00e1pagos are important to develop due to the ecological and disease threats they present. A contingency plan that will enable rapid response for the successful mitigation of disease outbreaks of Gal\u00e1pagos native birds and poultry is necessary and urgent. Such a plan should identify national and international collaborators and laboratories for diagnosis of pathogens, budget costs, establish operational agreements, and maintain permits to facilitate the action plan when abnormal mortality of native birds or poultry is encountered."}
