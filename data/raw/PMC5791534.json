{"title": "Pathways to zoonotic spillover", "body": "The phenomenon of cross-species spillover is the defining characteristic of pathogens that transmit from vertebrate animals to humans (zoonoses). The public health burden that is presented by zoonoses includes outbreaks of pathogens such as Ebola virus, influenza A virus (H1N1)pdm09 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as the ongoing transmission of endemic pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., Leptospira spp., Trypanosoma spp., Mycobacterium spp. and West Nile virus1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSpillover transmission is promoted by successive processes that enable an animal pathogen to establish infection in a human. The probability of zoonotic spillover is determined by interactions among several factors, including disease dynamics in the reservoir host, pathogen exposure and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infections. These factors can be partitioned into three functional phases that describe all major routes of transmission (Fig. 1). In the first phase, the amount of pathogen available to the human host at a given point in space and time, known as the pathogen pressure, is determined by interactions among reservoir host distribution, pathogen prevalence and pathogen release from the reservoir host, followed by pathogen survival, development and dissemination outside of the reservoir hosts. Second, human and vector behaviour determine pathogen exposure; specifically, the likelihood, route and dose of exposure. Third, genetic, physiological and immunological attributes of the recipient human host, together with the dose and route of exposure, affect the probability and severity of infection.\n\nEach phase presents multiple barriers to the flow of a pathogen from a reservoir host to a recipient host. Spillover requires the pathogen to pass every barrier and thus can only occur when gaps align in each successive barrier within an appropriate window in space and time (Fig. 2). Consequently, zoonotic spillover is a relatively rare event, and although humans are continually exposed to many potentially infectious pathogens that are derived from other species, most of these microorganisms cannot infect or cause disease in humans7,8,9,10.\n\nThis Opinion article focuses on spillover transmission, strictly defined as the processes that enable a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to establish infection in a human. Although many recent articles have examined the fields of zoonoses or emerging pathogens2,3,10,11,12,13,14,15, a synthetic mechanistic understanding of animal-to-human transmission is lacking14,16. Much attention has been dedicated to the characterization of emerging infections3,11,12,15; for example, the high frequency of zoonoses among emerging infections3,12, their socio-economic, environmental and ecological drivers2,13,17,18, and their phylogenetic and geographical distribution3. Similarly, the phases of zoonotic emergence in the human population11,14,18, adaptation and compatibility of zoonoses in humans10,11,19, and approaches to modelling the transmission of zoonoses14,16, have also been addressed in the literature. However, a comprehensive understanding of the processes that enable a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to establish infection in a human, and how these processes are hierarchically, functionally and quantitatively linked, remains a fundamental deficit in research on zoonoses14,16. In this Opinion article, we present a mechanistic structure that integrates the determinants of spillover and the interactions among them (Fig. 1). However, we do not address broader determinants of pathogen emergence or factors that affect disease severity or onward transmission in humans.\n\nAlthough many of the individual determinants of spillover are subjects of intensive study, each is usually addressed in isolation in a specialized discipline (Fig. 2). Accordingly, the better-characterized factors become the focus of public health interventions. For example, reservoir hosts or vectors are often targeted for control before the concatenation and relative influence of processes that lead to spillover are understood, which sometimes leads to inefficient or even counterproductive interventions20. In other cases, multiple mechanisms are aggregated in analyses that obscure the interactions or heterogeneities that drive risk. Although the aggregation of mechanisms may be appropriate at times, identifying discrete mechanisms and how they interact to drive spillover is essential to recognize the assumptions that are implicit in simpler models, and to clarify which processes must be modelled explicitly and which can be combined. For example, does assessment of the risk of acquiring a zoonotic infection require the measurement of the pathogen burden carried by individual reservoir hosts, or is it sufficient to estimate the cumulative abundance of a pathogen in the environment over time? This is a key question for pathogens such as Leptospira interrogans, Giardia spp., and Escherichia coli O157, and the answer may depend on modes of contact and dose\u2013response relationships in humans (see below). Models that integrate data from experiments, the field and epidemiological studies, even if only partially parameterized, may be necessary to make such determinations.\n\nWe describe how pathogens overcome a series of barriers to pass from reservoir hosts to humans. Crucially, nonlinear interactions among the barriers create bottlenecks in the flow of a pathogen between species. Such bottlenecks provide opportunities for public health interventions that could lead to substantial reductions in the risk of spillover. Alternatively, changing environmental or social conditions can alleviate these bottlenecks, which can cause surges in spillover infections. Our framework provides the foundation for operational models that are required for quantitative evidence-based risk analysis, preparedness, surveillance and control.\n\nWhen gaps in barriers to spillover are highly dynamic in time and space, they may vary asynchronously, so that the alignment of gaps in all barriers may be fleeting and spillover may seem random (Supplementary information S2 (movie)). Research methods that group multiple barriers or integrate data over space and time may not capture these dynamics. For example, ecological niche models are often used to study zoonotic risk by assessing the distribution of reservoir hosts or vectors85, but this approach overlooks variation in downstream barriers that might drive risk. Alternatively, niche models that are based on the documented occurrence of spillover may capture the accumulated distribution of all conditions that enabled barriers to be breached over time (Fig. 1), but they cannot isolate the precise barriers that affect spillover risk (for example, see Ref. 86). Therefore, niche models tend to overestimate the spatial range of spillover risk and do not readily enable extrapolation to novel conditions87. Examples of this include Hendra virus and Marburg virus, which can be excreted in discrete temporal and spatial pulses from their bat reservoir hosts20,88,89. However, for spillover, shedding must align with environmental and bat population conditions that generate levels of pathogen pressure that are sufficient to produce an infectious dose (Fig. 2), and with exposure behaviours and susceptibility of the recipient hosts. As some of these conditions vary among seasons and years, the pattern of outbreaks in livestock or humans has high spatial and temporal variability20,89. However, as niche models often summarize risk across large areas and long durations, they overlook important heterogeneities and they lack the specificity that is required for public health intervention. Although niche models can help to identify regional-to-continental concentrations of risk90,91, risk assessments that are more quantitative and more precise with regard to space, time and which barriers they address are needed to guide concrete action.\n\nEpidemiological investigations of spillover also need to account for conditions that are highly dynamic in space and time. If the alignment of gaps in all barriers is fleeting, delayed diagnoses or inconsistent case detection may delay outbreak investigations until the conditions that enabled spillover have changed. Similarly, investigations are sometimes triggered once the case count becomes high. These challenges differ among pathogens with different values of R0 (the basic reproductive number or expected number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected individual in a susceptible population). For supercritical pathogens with R0 >1, which can cause major epidemics through sustained transmission in human populations (for example, Ebola virus, Zika virus and the pandemic strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)4,81,92), spillover becomes challenging to study because a given human case is likely to be far removed in time or space from the spillover event that triggered an outbreak. Subcritical pathogens with 0 <R0 <1, which cause self-limiting outbreaks or 'stuttering chains' in human populations (for example, monkeypox or avian influenza viruses93,94), raise distinct challenges because any given individual could have been infected by either an animal or a human source16. It is easiest to study the spillover of pathogens with R0 = 0 that are not transmitted between humans (for example, rabies virus or West Nile virus25,95), in which every case is an instance of spillover. The 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa is a prime example whereby delayed response and investigation prevented researchers from reconstructing the conditions that initiated the human epidemic of a supercritical pathogen96,97. Ebola virus infection is an extreme example of spillover infection that only occurs during the rare alignment of gaps in barriers, and, accordingly, the precise determinants of risk are poorly understood (Fig. 3). By contrast, for other zoonoses, such as trypanosomiasis in some parts of Africa, incidence is high because the pathogen flows through consistently wide gaps in barriers to infection (for example, common exposure to infected animal hosts and tsetse fly vectors, and low resistance in humans due to the ability of trypanosomes to neutralize or avoid human innate immune activity98,99). In all scenarios, irrespective of the frequency with which gaps align, the concept of hierarchical barriers can be used to organize and quantify the conditions that enable spillover.\n\nThe influence of particular barriers may vary in space and time, and this variation \u2014 coupled with data on realized spillover events \u2014 can help elucidate factors that shape infection risk, even in the absence of information on other barriers. In the westernmost province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the observed lack of monkeypox spillover, despite high seroprevalence in the suspected reservoir hosts (Heliosciurus spp. and Funisciuris spp.), was attributed to cultural norms that forbade the consumption of small rodents100. The inconsistency between ecological data that suggested high pathogen pressure and epidemiological data that indicated a lack of spillover, focused attention on human behaviours that affect the probability of exposure. Research approaches that integrate data on multiple barriers are more likely to discern such behavioural effects.\n\nBroad-scale discovery of novel microorganisms has the potential to characterize the pool of possible zoonotic pathogens and provide valuable baseline information101,102. However, each of the \u223c63,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish103 contains a multitude of infectious viruses, bacteria and parasites101,102,104,105,106. Although each of these microorganisms and parasites can be viewed as a potential pathogen, the vast majority may not cause disease in their natural hosts, and the extent to which they infect or cause pathology in other species, including humans, is unknown7,9,10. Therefore, discovery alone cannot address the potential risk of spillover. The translation of new discoveries of microorganisms into guidance for public health practitioners requires the identification of the barriers to microbial infection of humans, the conditions that facilitate the breaching of these barriers, and, therefore, the microbiological and environmental contexts that pose the greatest risk to human populations. For the foreseeable future, the greatest practical contribution of pathogen discovery and sequence characterization to the epidemiology of emerging pathogens is likely to be in the rapid post hoc identification of novel pathogens after spillover.\n\nThe framework presented in this Opinion article highlights that an important frontier in research on zoonotic spillover is to understand the functional and quantitative links among the determinants of spillover. To our knowledge, all of the processes that are necessary to achieve spillover have not been connected, compared and quantified for any single zoonotic pathogen. We address this gap, in part, by introducing a conceptual and quantitative model that can be used to integrate existing data, identify high-priority data gaps, investigate conditions that widen or align gaps in barriers to spillover, and identify the best gaps on which to focus intervention efforts. We suggest that future research focuses on developing case studies that contribute to fully quantifying the determinants of spillover and their linkages, with the goal of making operational contributions to risk assessment. We provide a mathematical framework that formalizes the ideas presented here to guide the formulation of mechanistic spillover models for particular zoonotic pathogens (Box 1; Supplementary information S1 (box)). We anticipate that this synthetic framework will provide a foundation for cross-scale data integration, transdisciplinary investigation, and a new body of theory on spillover that is necessary for risk assessment and public health planning.\n\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."}
