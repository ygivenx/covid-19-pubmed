{"title": "and in the presence of increasing concertation of K + (50 mM -150 mM)", "body": ": Schematic representation for the functioning of EspK and EspB genes/proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis inside the phagosome of a macrophage.\n\nSide A: In normal conditions, EspK EspB, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are co-transcribed. EspK leads to the secretion of EspB, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 in the phagosome leading to rupture of its membrane (represented by dotted lines). That helps the bacteria to survive with an inhibited immune response. Side B: G-quadruplex motifs present in espK and espB genes are stabilized by TMPyP4, leading to the decreased expression of EspK and EspB. The reduction in EspK leads to the inhibited secretion of EspB, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 protein. The absence of EspB, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 leads to phagosome maturation increased immune response by the host and reduced Mycobacterial growth. # nt -number of G-tetrads, nb -number of bulges and nm -number of mismatches Table S6 : G-quadruplex prediction of espk, espB and cyp51 genes using QGRSMapper prediction. where: X = any nucleic acid base, including A, G, C, and T Y1 = length of consecutive guanine tract (value = any integer between 2 to 7) ; Y2 = variable loop length (value = any integer between 1 to 20).\n\nThis tool looks for putative G-quadruplex forming sequences in the query sequence. Every predicted sequence was recorded and inspected for their location in the GenBank Sequence Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/). Further, we used CLUSTAL Omega tool that makes the clusters of highly similar predicted PGQ sequences by employing Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) method.\n\nThe locations of obtained PGQ sequences in the M. tuberculosis genome were mapped after extracting the coordinates from G4 predicted motifs. Their presence at a particular location was determined by utilizing Graphics mode of GenBank database. The recurrence of predicted PGQ was ascertained manually, and consensus sequences were generated from DECIPHER tool by aligning 20 base-pairs upstream and downstream of anticipated G4 motifs.\n\nAll the oligonucleotide sequences used in this study were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 100 \u03bcM stock solutions were prepared in nuclease-free water for each sample according to the manufacturer protocol. Before performing any experiment, the oligonucleotides were heated for 10 minutes at 92\u00b0C and allowed to anneal for 2 hrs at room temperature in Tris buffer (10 mM, pH=7.4) containing any of the four different cations viz. K + , Na + , Mg 2+ and Li + (50 mM each).\n\nNMR experiments were conducted using AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer (BioSpin International AG, Switzerland) equipped with a 5 mm broadband inverse probe. Topspin (1.3 version) software was used for the NMR data processing and analysis. 3-(Trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-D4 acid sodium salt (TSP) was taken as a reference compound. The oligo sequences were dissolved at the final concentration of 200 \u00b5M in KPO 4 (pH=7.4) buffer using H 2 O/D 2 O solvent at 9:1 ratio. All NMR spectra were recorded at a temperature range of 298 K with 20 ppm spectral width.\n\nA Jasco J-815 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan) outfitted with Peltier junction temperature controller was used to record CD spectra using cuvettes of 0.2 cm path length. A constant supply of nitrogen gas was provided to eschew the water build up around cuvette and all spectra were measured at 25\u00b0C in the of 220 -320 nm wavelength range at a rate of 20 nm/min. CD spectra were recorded at a final concentration of 20 \u03bcM for all oligonucleotides in Tris buffer (10 mM, pH=7.4) containing any of the four different cations viz. K + , Na + , Mg 2+ and Li + (50 mM each). To avoid signal contribution from the buffer, a blank spectrum was recorded before each measurement and subtracted from the CD spectrum of the sample prepared in the same buffer. For melting studies, data were accumulated over a temperature range of 25\u00b0C to 98\u00b0C for each PGQ sequence for each of the four cations at a wavelength corresponding to the highest CD signal.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) 30% native polyacrylamide gel prepared in 1X TBE buffer (without any cation used for EMSA analysis) was employed to perform gel mobility shift assay. 20 \u03bcM of each oligonucleotide prepared in the respective buffers containing K + , Na + , Mg 2+ , and Li + cations (100 mM) were loaded on the gel.
