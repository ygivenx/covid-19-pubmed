{"title": "Origin and Evolution of Viruses", "body": "There is little more ambiguous than words. Yet it is through words that we communicate. Take retrovirus and evolution that make up the title. Once upon a time \" retrovirus \" was pretty clear and referred to a group of viruses with two copies of polyA \u03e9 genomic RNA in the virion. Their genetic bauplan was three orfs, gag-pol-env , bounded by two long terminal repeats (LTRs). The situation was complicated a little with the identifi cation of endogenous retroviruses in the mid-1970s and thoroughly disjointed by the discoveries in 1982 and 1983 that both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and caulifl ower mosaic virus (CaMV) replicate by way of an RNA intermediate. The infectious form of both of these viruses is DNA. However, given that the history of \" retroviruses \" goes back to the early 1900s, that they induced cancer, while the remarkable phenomenon of reverse transcription that broke \" The Central Dogma \" of the day, i.e. DNA makes RNA makes protein, was established using these oncogenic retroviruses, classical \" retrovirology \" understandably had the advantage of terrain.\n\nHBV was referred to as a \" pararetrovirus \" before becoming the prototype of the \" hepadnavirus \" group. CaMV lent its name to the caulimovirus group. Retrovirology has come to be synonymous with classical retroviruses.\n\nYet just at this moment, retrovirology was about to be discombobulated once again, and this time by an insider. Prior to HIV, the key retroviruses were oncogenic, otherwise known as the avian and murine leukemia viruses (ALV and MLV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) . The discovery in 1980 of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) associated with 13 C H A P T E R adult T cell leukemia virus fi tted the bill, so all was well. However, with the isolation of HIV-1, a lentivirus, and a major new disease, AIDS, indeed the infection of a generation, everything changed. It coincided with an unprecedented fi repower in molecular biology that has led us to generate almost more data than we know what to do with. Within 2 years of isolation detection kits became available, with the fi rst designer antivirals appearing by 1995. HIV is the number 1 virus for the Journal of Virology . The younger generations of students know little of ALV, MLV, and MMTV. As ever such a magnet can warp vision, and anything and everything new is tried and tested on HIV, a little like the involvement of every new virus in multiple sclerosis ( Vandvik and Norrby, 1989 ; Winkelmann, 1993 ; Ablashi et al. , 2000 ) .\n\n\" Evolution \" has almost as many meanings as researchers working on it. Outside of a biological setting, evolution actually refers to d y /d x , the change of one parameter with respect to another. Of course in biology we are interested in the temporal component, hence it is d y /d t that is important. Yet for Darwin the \" stuff of evolution \" was adaptation, in fact repeated adaptation that over time led to something as wondrously complex as the eye probably 40 times or so.\n\nComing to the point, this chapter will deal with the evolution of the classical retroviruses. Evolution will be considered from the macroscopic point of view which, considering that genomics dominates contemporary microbiology, is tantamount to the generation of novel genomic organizations. And this is where we will start.\n\nRetroviruses are enveloped viruses composed of a lipid bilayer surrounding a nucleocapsid within which resides the two copies of genomic plus stranded genomic RNA. Understandably the genome must code for capsid and envelope proteins. Given the provirus, the integrated DNA replication intermediate, a reverse transcriptase and integrase are called for. It turns out that three open reading frames (orfs) are suffi cient to generate a fully functional retrovirus. Retroviral genetic maps are invariably given in the proviral form because it is that of the gene ( Figure 13 .1 ). With the signal exception of the spumavirus group of retroviruses, the provirus is a single, multiply spliced gene. The words gene and orf are used interchangeably in retrovirology which is, of course, an abuse of language. The convention is that genes/orfs are referred to in italics while the corresponding proteins are given in normal type. The gag orf encodes the nucleocapsid proteins in the form of a polyprotein precursor. gag is followed by pol , encoding a large polyprotein incorporating the mature reverse transcriptase; RNase H and integrase proteins. Maturation of the polyproteins is the accomplishment of the viral protease that is generally part of pol , but can exist in a separate orf termed pro located between gag and pol. Uniquely for Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is the protease attached to the C-terminus of the Gag polyprotein. The third orf is env , and encodes a polyprotein envelope precursor that is matured by host cell proteases. For ALV, MLV, and MMTV, the historical benchmark retroviruses, gag is always followed by pol which is always followed by env , and gag-polenv represents the lowest common denominator for retrovirus genome organization. However, as can be seen from Figure 13 .1 , this effective yet minimalist view of retroviral genomics is far from common. The most complex retroviruses bear up to nine distinct orfs encoding 15 mature proteins. Some orfs are unique to a virus, others common to a cluster. Some orfs are apparently analogues even though there is no sequence identity between them. While the gag-pol-env synteny is never violated, a multitude of orfs can separate pol and env . Frequently env is followed by 1-4 orfs, although an orf preceding gag is rare.\n\nSuch exuberance in terms of genetic organization is probably without precedent among small viral genomes, although coronavirus genome organization shows considerable The open reading frames are represented by boxes fl anked by the LTR (long terminal repeat), which encodes most of the information necessary for transcription and reverse transcription. In some cases there is considerable amino acid identity, as in the case of pol. However, although env indicates the envelope orf there is no sequence identity whatsoever between, say, those of HIV, HTLV-1, RSV, and WDSV. The same is true of the retroviral transactivators tat, tax, and orf1. Even for a given virus, strain variation can attain staggering proportions (see Figure 13 .5).\n\nplasticity. Of course herpesviruses genomes span 119-236 kb while poxvirus genomes vary even more-134-360 kb. By contrast the threefold range in the number of retroviral orfs is accompanied by a relatively modest \u03f3 50% variation in the size of the coding region.\n\nWhere do all these \" extra \" genes come from? The origin of the RSV src gene is no secret, it being transduced from the avian genome ( Stehelin et al. , 1976 ) , while the primate lentiviral vpx gene is arguably derived from a duplication of the vpr gene ( Tristem et al. , 1990 ) . For the rest, sequence homology is non-existent. It is possible that many are of cellular origin, however, given the tempo of retroviral mutation ( vide infra ), all traces have been lost.\n\nApart from gene transduction, the genomic organization of a particular retrovirus is invariant. While it is possible to isolate viable strains carrying deletions say in env (JDV) or nef (HIV, SIV), deletions are common fare among microorganisms. As the provirus represents a single gene, large rearrangements and inversions are presumably deleterious. When making retrovirus-wide comparisons of the common gag , pol , and env orfs, the internal order of the major proteins is invariably conserved. Thus for Gag the order is always matrix antigen, capsid antigen, and nucleic acid binding protein, for Pol the order is protease, reverse transcriptase/RNaseH, integrase while for Env, the order is surface protein, transmembrane protein.\n\nNonetheless, there are a couple of noteworthy cases of reorganization. The fi rst concerns the protease. As can be seen, it always precedes the reverse transcriptase/ RNaseH ( Figure 13 .2A ). However, the coding sequences can be part of gag , pol or in a separate reading frame, called pro. In view of this it is not surprising to learn that there are several distinct mechanisms by which these distinct reading frames are connected. The mechanisms range from \u03ea 1 ribosomal frameshifting once, twice, splicing, and suppression of a terminator codon. If the larger family of retroelements are considered for once, there are two additional Gag-Pol syntenies involving \u03e9 1 ribosomal frameshifi ng and the two being part of one long polyprotein precursor. These examples show that while the gene/orf order may be preserved, there are radical differences underlying their expression.\n\nThe second example concerns the retroviral dUTPase ( McGeoch, 1990 ) . Interestingly, only a subset of lentiviruses and the MMTV/SRV group encode such an enzyme and then in two different locations ( Figure 13 .2B ). For the lentiviruses, it fi ts snugly in phase between the RT/ RNaseH and integrase coding regions, while for the MMTV/SRV group it is located upstream of the viral protease. While phylogenic analysis shows that they cluster together, they do not constitute a robust monophyletic group, meaning that it is not possible to distinguish between a single introduction or independent introductions into each group ( McGeoch, 1990 ) . This is the only example of radical change in the synteny of retroviral coding sequences. Of course for large DNA viruses, such as the mycophages, marine phaeoviruses, and herpesvirus, to name but three, extensively rearranged genomes are commonplace ( Weir, 1998 ; Delaroque et al. , 2003 ; Pedulla et al. , 2003 ) .\n\nWhen it comes to making replication errors, DNA and RNA virus differ hugely. RNA viruses are unable to undertake proofreading or mismatch repair while DNA viruses can, either because DNA replication is performed by the host cell or else the genome is large enough to encode the necessary enzymes to undertake high-fi delity replication. In this latter context, poxviruses replicating in the cytoplasm is perhaps the most extreme example. Where do retroviruses, half DNA, half RNA viruses sit when it comes to error? Errors made during reverse transcription per se are not corrected whatsoever, while those made during plus-strand synthesis could be proofread when the DNA is translocated to the nucleus. It turns out that although retroviral mutation rates are in the range of 0.3-0.05 per genome per cycle ( Mansky and Temin, 1995 ; Mansky and Wisniewski, 1998 ; Mansky, 2000 ) , Not only is the pro coding region in different reading frames, the mechanism by which it is expressed in the form of a Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor is radically different. (B) The dUTPase coding sequence is found only in a subset of retroviral genomes and then not consistently. For example, all the primate lentiviruses do not carry a dUTPase. they are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those for RNA viruses, 1-3 per genome per cycle ( Drake and Holland, 1999 ) . While it would be tempting to ascribe this difference to proofreading of mutations of the plus-strand errors, as more errors are made during minus-strand synthesis, it probably refl ects some subtle intrinsic difference between the polymerases. As in almost all polymerases, transitions are produced more readily than transversions, while deletions are more frequent than insertions (essentially duplications). For the HIV reverse transcriptase and presumably the lentiviruses as a whole, deletions arise more frequently than for other RTases. Being diploid viruses, recombination is to be reckoned with. Retroviral recombination goes back to 1971 ( Vogt, 1971 ; Kawai and Hanafusa, 1972 ; Weiss et al. , 1973 ) just one year following the description of reverse transcription. It occurs essentially by a copy choice mechanism ( Coffi n, 1979 ). Precise recombination rates have been worked out for two retroviruses, HIV-1 and MLV, the values being 3-4 per virus per cycle respectively for both viruses, despite an initially lower rate for MLV ( Jetzt et al. , 2000 ; Zhuang et al. , 2006 ) . Importantly, these values are \u03f3 10-100 \u03eb the point mutation rate for both retroviruses. This means that as soon as a point mutation is made it will be recombined in the following round.\n\nThere are a couple of conditions to be met before concluding that everything is recombined for a retrovirus. First, infected cells have to be multiply infected, meaning that they must harbor multiple proviruses. Second, the proviruses must be genetically distinct. If, for example, a multiple infected cell received all its HIV content from a productively infected neighboring cell that harbored a single provirus, then recombination would proceed but effectively produce the parental virus despite recombination. So does multi-infection occur and are the proviruses divergent in vivo ?\n\nWe have only the beginnings of an answer to these questions and then only for HIV-1. Using fl uorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) a single report showed that for two patients, one with high and one with low plasma viremia, the average proviral copy number in splenic mononuclear cells was 3-4 with a range of 1-8 ( Jung et al. , 2002 ) . The majority of cells ( \u03f3 72%) were multiply infected. Laser microdissection of the FISH positive nuclei and transfer to PCR tubes allowed amplification and sequencing of the HIV-1 DNA. The sequence complexity of the V1V2 hypervariable regions analyzed, probably the most sensitive indicator of Env variation, was stunning. Up to 28% amino acid variation was found within a single nucleus. This is greater than the average protein variation between humans and birds! To add to a complex situation, numerous distinct recombinants were also found within the same nucleus.\n\nWhat does this mean? First, it indicates that phenotypic mixing is possible, generating heterogeneous virions ( Figure 13 .3B ). Second, it means that HIV virions are non-clonal objects. Worse, these non-clonal structures are ephemeral as production, infection and reverse transcription involving recombination are a matter of 10-18 hours ( Figure 13 .3 ). Such complexity inside a single nucleus (synonymous here with boundary or discrete volume) indeed conjures up the quasispecies. Indeed, is this the true quasispecies where genomes and gene products clearly interact? The population of genomes is of course limited to two or at most eight functional genomes, which can produce a rich variety of heterokaryons. However, they will recombine in the next round of infection producing a new ensemble of recombinant genomes. This leads to the third point. How is fi tness maintained? Perhaps this question should be rephrased into a more prosaic form, what fraction of recombinants is neutral and what fraction deleterious? The concise answer is we simply don ' t know. However, when recombinants of HIV and SIV are made the resulting \" SHIV \" that is eventually recovered invariably carries \" additional \" substitutions as though the jump in sequence space made by the molecular virologist landed the SHIV in a relatively unfi t region. It seems possible that most recombinants may in fact reduce fi tness. Certainly, it seems logical given that functional sequence space can represent only a small fraction of total sequence space. Could the retroviral for HIV, no matter the multiplicity of infection, the disease stage, or the nature of existing immune responses?\n\nAt the more macroscopic level, recombinants are found at all levels of HIV and SIV-intrapatient recombinants, those among different strains of the same clade, the everexpanding number of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) worldwide that can be readily shown to be mixes of the original founder clade viruses, recombinants of CRFs, intergroup recombinants, e.g. HIV-1 M-O ( Peeters et al. , 1999 ) , and a plethora of recombinants between HIV-1 precursor viruses with SIVs of chimpanzees ( Bibollet-Ruche et al. , 2004 ) . Many of the diverse SIVs from small equatorial monkeys are demonstrably recombinants ( Jin et al. , 1994 ) . Indeed we are probably at a level where the null hypothesis should be that everything is recombinant unless shown otherwise.\n\nOne of the hottest topics in retrovirus variation right now is APOBEC3-mediated hypermutation, which is extensively treated in the excellent chapter by Warner Greene (Chapter 8). Briefl y, these are cellular cytidine deaminases that if packaged into the virion can edit hundreds of cytidine residues, leaving behind uracil. This is tantamount to a host restriction system. It is particularly a problem for the lentiviruses to the point that they have evolved the vif gene that prevents APOBEC3 incorporation ( Sheehy et al. , 2002 ) . While other retroviruses including HBV do undergo editing in vitro and in vivo ( Mahieux et al. , 2005 ; Suspene et al. , 2005 ; Delebecque et al. , 2006 ) , there is no evidence that this seriously impacts their replication. For the mouse there is a single APOBEC3 gene and knockout mice are both viable and fertile, which suggests that it does not restrict the transposition of endogenous retroviruses ( Mikl et al. , 2005 ) . This fi ts in well with the fact that although the bird genome carries a plethora of endogenous retroviruses, there is no APOBEC3 counterpart ( Harris and Liddament, 2004 ) . Might a little APOBEC3 editing help the lentiviruses evolve? Could it occasionally act as the equivalent of a bacterial mutator? As is frequently the case, speculation is understandably inversely proportional to the amount of data. Red Queen be constantly running to make up for the devastating effects of recombination? Could this be the major driving force leading to the relentless accumulation of point mutations\n\nIt comes as no surprise to any virologist that fi xation rates vary with the protein under study-the fl u paradigm is known to all. To get this quickly out of the way, the retroviral surface envelope protein is generally the most variable, although some of the small accessory proteins fi x mutations at a comparable rate. The nucleocapsid Gag proteins are understandably less tolerant of change only in the temporal sense, while the enzymes that make up Pol bring up the rear. The retroviral integrase has the lowest amino acid fi xation rate and so it not a surprise that this region is invariably used to perform retrovirus-wide phylogenic analyses. A typical phylogenic tree based on the integrase gene is shown in Figure 13 .4A . However, there is a complication. Between retroviruses, fi xation rates vary hugely. For the lentiviruses, read HIV/SIV simply because the databases are so much larger, the amino acid fi xation rates are of the order of 0.1-1% per year depending on the protein ( Johnson et al. , 1991 ) . For HTLV overall fi xation rates are more like 1% per century while for the foamy viruses or spumaviruses it estimated that the rates could be as slow as \u03f3 2% per million years ( Switzer et al. , 2005 ) . Obviously this cannot be ascribed to the RTase as the HTLV point mutation rate is \u03f3 7 \u03eb 10 \u03ea 6 per base per cycle ( Mansky, 2000 ) which is only four-fold down on that for HIV ( \u03f3 3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea 5 ). It transpires that viruses of the HTLV family replicate a little by reverse transcription and extensively by Tax-driven clonal expansion of the host cell, i.e. mitosis. Tax is a viral protein that impacts the cell by tripping it into cycling even during the non-malignant carrier state. Quite why the foamy viruses fi x mutations so slowly has not been clearly worked out, yet it might well involve clonal expansion, as the consensus opinion is that retrovirus and RNA polymerase complexes are not accompanied by proofreading enzymes.\n\nNonetheless the consequences for phylogeny are considerable. Understandably a phylogenic tree being built essentially from a distance matrix, is a scalar construction. Yet in our mind ' s eye it is inevitably read in a temporal sense, which is also understandable, for after all we are interested in evolution, i.e. d x /d t . There is the implicit assumption that lineages are lengthening at roughly equal rates. However, when the rates differ by several orders of magnitude scalar trees hide information. If the lentiviral and HTLV and normalized to the spumavirus lineage as a function of their fi xation rates, then both the large and diverse lentivirus group as well as the small HTLV group collapse to next to nothing ( Figure 13 .4B ). In this tree, the other retroviral lineages have been kept constant either for lack of data about fi xation rates, or else the possibility of recombination with endogenous retroviruses is such as to confound any evaluation.\n\nHow are we to interpret the hobbled lentivirus and HTLV viruses? As mere blips in retrovirology? If so they certainly represent a recent blip from some sort of a retroviral base line. Yet given the complexity of lentiviral genomes, considerable changes in synteny have occurred in a very short time compared to the relatively fewer differences in the spumavirus group over much greater periods of time.\n\nGiven the phenomenal fi xation rates, particularly for the lentiviruses, the question often asked is, are there limits to the change a virus can absorb? This was dealt with extensively in my chapter of the original edition of this book and so there is no need to belabor the pointfunctional sequence space is so vast that there are effectively no limits. One example will suffi ce: feline immunodefi ciency virus produces profound immunodefi ciency and an AIDSlike disease in domestic and big wild cats. A simple alignment of the envelope polyprotein precursor from the PPR and Pallas cat isolates shows a stunning 10% match for the complete Env sequence ( Figure 13 .5 ) and approaches the 5% expectation value given 20 amino acids. Despite this both bear all the hallmarks of a lentiviral envelope sequence-they are highly glycosylated, rich in cysteine residues, have a long cytoplasmic tail and contain the requisite three hydrophobic segments. In general for retroviral proteins, the envelope proteins are the most divergent while the enzymes encoded by pol are the least variable. Thus the rate of fi xation of integrase is perhaps a factor of 10 less than for envelope ( Johnson et al. , 1991 ) . So long as the protein fold and a few crucial residues are preserved, the rest will, and does, change given time.\n\nTo appreciate this it is worth mentioning a contrary situation. The \" Paracelsus challenge \" defi ed or encouraged researchers to radically change the fold of a known protein by changing less than 50% of its amino acid residues ( Rose and Creamer, 1994 ) . The challenge was fi rst met in 1997. The 1 domain of the Streptococcal IgG-binding protein G which displays an extensive -sheet structure was redesigned and transformed into the E. coli protein Rop, a homodimeric four-helix bundle protein ( Dalal et al. , 1997 ) . The fi rst solution was perhaps not surprisingly called Janus. This designer protein is a fascinating example of cultural evolution impinging on biology. It represents a statistically improbable saltation as opposed to, the familiar and presumably \" incremental \" polymerase mutations that allow FIV Env to drift beyond way beyond the 50% level separating Janus from its natural counterpart.\n\nRetrovirology has been a hotbed of methodological improvement in the realm of phylogeny over the past decade. A rich variety of methods have emerged; those which have been particularly useful being those enabling the detection of complex recombinant structures. Despite this problems remain. Many simple assumptions and corrections haven ' t been developed using real data sets. For example, a complete retrovirus tree includes a branch for the lentiviruses and the -retroviruses (HTLV-BLV group) that have profound differences in base composition, codon usage, mutation matrices, and fi xation rates as mentioned above. Applying corrections for back mutations is not easy because there are hardly any good data sets on which to train methods.\n\nRecombination is a major problem for sequences jump repeatedly, rather than gradually diffuse or radiate through sequence space. Of course sequence space is of such high dimensionality that words essentially fail us, words like jump, diffuse, and radiate being used vainly to communicate some sort of sense. Recombination introduces homoplasies that are otherwise relatively rare ( Pelletier et al. , 1995 ; Wain-Hobson et al. , 2003 ) . Ignoring these tends to infl ate the number of mutations in a data set, which means that the sequences would appear older than they really were. Unfortunately network analyses that allow a clear description of recombination work only on small numbers of informative sites and small data sets. Nonetheless they show that recombination can sometimes account for up to 50% of all substitutions in a sequence set ( Wain-Hobson et al. , 2003 ) . For HIV, the simplest conclusion was that the number of true mutations in a set of PCR-derived sequences is equal to the number of variable sites.\n\nAn additional problem plagues HIV phylogeny. It is clear that relatively old proviruses can be reactivated from the carrying T cell, presumably by antigenic stimulation ( Bello et al. , 2005 ) . This means that not all progeny are derived from the most recently infected cells. This would serve to reduce the intrapatient cross-sectional diversity, and perhaps underestimate the time of infection. When sequences are close they are scored as such by whatever phylogenic method. Equally, when sequences are highly divergent they remain so. However, interpreting deep relationships or asking too precise a question is going to be fraught with assumptions.\n\nThe design of a retroviral genome can strongly impact replication and hence evolution. It has been known for some years that the HTLV-1 protein Tax transactivates a number of host cell genes, among them the IL-2 and IL-2 receptor genes helping set up an autocrine system ( Yoshida, 1993 ) . It has been shown that Tax intervenes directly in cell proliferation by inhibiting the cyclin D/Rb/p16INT pathway. A consequence of this, clonal expansion of HTLV-1 provirus-bearing T cells, has recently been shown via PCR-based studies of the HTLV-1 integration sites ( Wattel et al. , 1995 ) .\n\nIn asymptomatic carriers and patients with neurological disease devoid of malignancy, clonal expansion was found to be the norm. That HTLV-1 replicates mainly via mitosis reconciles the problem of the simultaneous occurrence of high proviral load with genetic stability as proviral synthesis is accomplished essentially by the host cell replication machinery, which is endowed with proofreading systems. However, this raises another problem: how does a clonally expanded infected cell produce little virus? Here the answers are less complete. Intrinsically, HTLV-1 production is low compared with that of HIV and is an inevitable consequence of their different genome organization ( Figure 13 .6 ). Both HIV and HTLV-1 encode analogous viral transcription transactivators, Tat and Tax, and temporal regulators of splicing, Rev and Rex respectively. The regulator proteins have a negative effect upon Tat and Tax which also curtails expression of the genomic RNA, and the large mRNA encoding the key virion proteins, Gag, Pol, and Env. HIV encodes both a Rev-dependent and -independent tat mRNA ( Figure 13 .6 ) allowing continual Tat-driven transcription and Rev co-ordinated splicing, and consequently continued expression of virion, gag and pol mRNAs. By contrast, the HTLV-1 analogues Tax and Rex are encoded by the same mRNA ( Figure 13 .6 ). Thus Rex tends to increase Gag, Pol, and Env expression at the expense of both Tax and Rex. The result is an equilibrium with greatly reduced virus production. In short, via genome organization, molecular switches with negative feedback loops can be generated which grossly impact the way a virus replicates and evolves. One fi nal point must be added; the Tax-transactivated HTLV-1 promoter is much less powerful than the Tat-transactivated HIV-1 LTR.\n\nWithin the phylogenic analysis above ( Figure  13 .4 ) are featured a number of complete endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences. These range from recently inactivated proviruses such as the HERV-Ks to baboon endogenous retrovirus (BaEV) that circulates in the peripheral blood of baboons. The retrovirus is produced but unable to infect its own cells, a simple example of negative selection against insertional gene inactivation. As can be seen the majority of these mammalian ERVs are clustered into two groups for which there are exogenous retroviral counterparts. Massive PCR-based efforts have shown that the extent of ERVs spreads across a vast spectrum of the living world, from insects, turtles, snakes, and of course The HTLV-1 transactivator, Tax, acts on a DNA element in LTR U3 region and cellular genes. That of HIV, Tat, recognizes the RNA TAR element in the R region of the LTR. The analogous HTLV-1 and HIV-1 regulators of splicing, Rex and Rev, act on specifi c intragenomic RNA structures, RxRE and RRE respectively. Note that Tax and Rex are derived from the same mRNA. The HIV-1 Tat protein comes in two functionally equivalent forms of 72 and 86 residues. The 86 residue form (exons 2\u03e93) comes from a small Rev-independent mRNA while the 76 residue form (exon 2) comes from a large Rev-dependent mRNA.\n\nmammals ( Gifford and Tristem, 2003 ; Belshaw et al. , 2004 Belshaw et al. , , 2007 Gifford et al. , 2005 ) . There is no doubt that retroviruses have invaded germinal cells many times in the past. Equally there is no doubt that some ERVs can escape their host and infect another species, the case of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) being exemplary. Its closest relative is a murine ERV ( Wolgamot et al. , 1998 ) . While there were numerous reports of endogenous counterparts to the lentiviruses, foamy virus, the alignments were borderline ( Cordonnier et al. , 1995 ) . A recent and glorious surprise is afforded by the aptly named sequence RELIK, for rabbit endogenous lentivirus, where the K refers to the tRNA lysine (K) primer used to initiate reverse transcription . Through a bioinformatics analysis a number of extensively degraded copies of an endogenous retrovirus were identifi ed in the rabbit genome. After careful reconstruction of a consensus sequence it transpired that these relics were those of an endogenous lentivirus, the fi rst unambiguous example to date ( Figure  13 .1 ). A simple comparison of the genome organization with named orfs is enough to convince. What is so nice about RELIK are the fi ne details that any lentivirologist would pick up in a moment. For example, the envelope protein is highly glycosylated, full of cysteine residues, has a furin-like cleavage site and encodes a long intracytoplasmic tail. It encodes a dUTP sequence precisely located between RTase/RNaseH and integrase ( Figure  13 .2 ). The primer-binding site (tRNAlys3) and polypurine tract are typical of a lentivirus.\n\nDespite all the above traits, in terms of gene organization it is the least complex lentivirus genome. Apart from gag , pol , and env , there are only the tat and rev genes. There are none of the so-called, yet misnamed, accessory genes typical of the primate lentiviruses. It is tempting to consider RELIK as a precursor to the lentiviruses, although one must be ever careful of the possibility of loss of function. A phylogenic analysis based on the RTase/integrase domains shows it to be the closest relative to the lentiviruses, yet it is the outlier to all extant lentiviruses. Given that RELIK is the outlier, it is plausible that the monophyletic lentiviral group is derived from some ancestor of this lentivirus. This concords with the relative simplicity of the genetic organization of RELIK.\n\nFrom a detailed analysis of the integration sites, the authors estimate that the invasion of the rabbit germline might have taken place some 7 million years ago. As there is no reason to doubt this fi nding we are placed in a very interesting evolutionary spot. If the present set of lentiviruses have remained exogenous for so long, then from what is known of the fi xation rates of the primate lentiviruses, of the order of 0.1% amino acids replacements per year for the most conserved integrase gene, then it should not be possible to fi nd 40% amino acid sequence identity between the HIV-1 and RELIK integrases. In the light of RELIK it seems more parsimonious to assume that the lentiviruses are very recently derived from an endogenous lentiviral RV and have been mutating furiously ever since. As mammalian genomics studies develop rapidly, the hope is that a much less degraded endogenous retrovirus will turn up in the near future.\n\nEven though the RELIK sequences were highly degraded, a consensus sequence was derived that is qualitatively satisfying. The ultimate would be to synthesize the provirus in the hope of resurrecting a functional lentivirus. Successful recovery of an active human ERV (HERV-K) was recently achieved following mutagenesis of a minimally defective HERV-K molecular clone ( Lee and Bieniasz, 2007 ) . Other workers have been calculating consensus or ancestral sequences for the HIV-1 envelope protein in the hope of making an immunogen that is equidistant to a maximum number of strains circulating worldwide. Chemical synthesis of the entire coding sequence and cloning into an expression vector generated functional envelope proteins that were remarkably \" HIV-like \" ( Nickle et al. , 2003 ; Rolland et al. , 2007 ; Kothe et al. , 2007 ) . Of course, the ultimate in this area is the complete chemical syntheses of an infectious molecular clone of poliovirus ( Cello et al. , 2002 ) and subsequently X174. The interesting evolutionary point here, which is a general one, is that total chemical synthesis of a virus, or \" therapy, \" of a partly degraded retrovirus constitutes a hiatus in Darwinian evolution. The mantra has always been \" descent with modifi cation, \" and with reason. Otherwise stated there is an uninterrupted series of DNA replication rounds linking this author to one of the earliest singlecelled DNA organisms fl oating around 3 billion years ago. Total chemical synthesis takes biological evolution into the realm of cultural evolution, something totally new. While the resulting viruses are poliovirus and X174, from an evolutionary setting where biology and history are inseparable, they are worlds apart. No other discipline is as advanced. The bacteriologists threaten to make a \" minimalist bacterium, \" but so far they are not there.\n\nIn fact ever since 1962 and the demonstration that phenol-extracted papillomavirus DNA could be infectious ( Ito, 1962 ; Chambers and Ito, 1964 ) , virologists have been playing games with the Darwinian mantra.\n\nGiven that retroviral replication is endlessly interrupted by recombination, while many of the corrections applied to phylogeny are rather ad hoc and approximate, is it possible that the phylogeny is completely wrong? How can it be checked? It is possible to encode retroviral organization in terms of a series of answers to questions that command discrete responses, for example yes or no, that can be coded as 1 or 0. Does env overlap pol ? Does the genome encode a bet orf? Features like the density of glycosylation sites in the Env protein, which in fact varies hugely, represent a continuous variable which is not useful. Questions with discrete answers have the advantage of being independent of the precise nucleotide sequence, polymorphisms, multiple substitutions, and saturation.\n\nWhen this is done for the retroviruses ( Renoux-Elbe et al. , 2002 ) it turns out that the arborescence is reasonably similar to that provided by the retroviral integrase gene, although there are a few differences ( Figure  13 .7 ). However, overall it is a comforting result. The answers can be overlaid on the non-classical tree ( Figure 13 .8 ). The minimal retroviral organization was always gag-pol-env and so there are no surprises that this confi guration exemplifi ed by MLV is found branching near the base of the tree. However, the lentiviruses turn out to be the largest and most varied tree. Indeed there is almost as much novelty within this group as in all the others and throws into light the trivial distinctions that were used in the past to lump or split retroviruses. The minimal lentivirus turns out to be gag-pol-tat-rev-env with the acquisition of vif coming immediately after. However, as all but one lentivirus (EIAV) encodes a vif gene, this could be a legitimate case of loss of function. Since the tree in Figure 13 .8 was calculated, \" RELIK \" was discovered . As mentioned above, RELIK has this minimalist lentivirus organization, i.e. gagpol-tat-rev-env yet does not encode a vif gene. This is consistent with the hypothesis that vif was a subsequent acquisition compared to tat and rev.\n\nAs always care has to be exercised when interpreting trees. Basically sequence space is so huge and multidimensional that simple two-dimensional constructs cannot do justice to the complexity. While not shown here, many of the bootstrap values are rather small, indicating that parts of the tree, particularly towards the root, are not robust ( Renoux-Elbe et al. , 2002 ) . It should perhaps be mentioned that the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K encodes a rev -like orf. It is of course tempting to conclude that rev appeared before tat. While it is satisfying that HERV-K is found in the twilight zone not too far from the lentiviruses, given the low bootstrap values it is not possible to be more precise.\n\nAn additional point can be made concerning Figures 13.7 and 13 .8 . The standard retroviral tree concerns the accumulation of point mutations while the \" unconventional \" tree concerns the accumulation of novel features. That the general branching orders coincide suggests that the acquisition of novelty inevitably accompanies the remorseless accumulation of point mutations. As any retrovirus radiates through sequence space it will inevitably accumulate novel features along with massive numbers of point mutations. As the lentiviruses sport the highest fi xation rates of any retrovirus, organizational novelty is to be expected here, and probably with the accompanying HIV-1 pandemic more than anywhere else. It transpires that almost every small equatorial African monkey harbors a distinct SIV, albeit pathogenic. To date there are \u03fe 34 SIVs if not more ( Van Heuverswyn et al. , 2006 ) . Through hunting and butchering it is eminently reasonable to postulate yet another zoonotic transmission, and perhaps secondary transmission between humans. While a HIV-3 cannot be ruled out, it seems hard to beat HIV-1 that has in the space of a half-century climbed to the top of the virological Richter scale ( Hale et al. , 2001 ; Weiss and McMichael, 2004 ) .\n\nIf one of these small monkey SIVs ever crosses to humans another pandemic is not axiomatic. There is one unfortunate \" experiment \" that was unwittingly performed on humans and yet, fortunately, did not take off. With the identifi cation of SV40 in rhesus macaque primary kidney cultures, manufacture of the attenuated Sabin strains of poliovirus was switched to African green monkey (Agm) kidney cultures. It is no secret that the incidence of SIVagm in some troops of Agms can be as high as 70%. As there was no inactivating step in the vaccine preparation, some individuals must have received SIVagm. Yet HIV-1 simply is not derived from any SIVagm of any sort despite the fact that some strains can grow on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Gautam et al. , 2007 ) . It was, as Robin Weiss remarked, a close shave.\n\nThe only real question of any importance for us as potential hosts for retrovirus replication is whether variation will be the Achilles ' heel of an eventual HIV vaccine. Is it going to be a problem? Certainly studies show that an attenuated SIV vaccine can contain the challenge virus despite a certain degree of envelope variation ( Johnson et al. , 1999 ; Blancou et al. , 2004 ) . However, breakthrough does occur when more diverse challenge strains are used. There are simply not enough data to be more precise on the degree of variation. Superinfection by HIV-1 is often given as proof that vaccination will not work. This is not the same as vaccination. It is increasingly clear that during the very early stages of infection there is a loss of HIV/SIV-specifi c immunity, meaning that a seropositive individual is not the same as a vaccinated volunteer. Whatever the state of experimental fi ndings and subtending riders, HIV variation is not good news.\n\nTo conclude, retroviruses are remarkable mutation machines and their genetic complexity and lifestyles vary enormously. Almost anything is possible given time. With the massive effort devoted to sequencing complete genomes, more endogenous retroviruses will be described in less familiar species, and why not clear counterparts to HTLV and spumaviruses? The koala endogenous retrovirus is an interesting case in point ( Gifford, 2006 ) , although there must be many more. Although there are a handful of retroviruses in fi sh, the aquatic world is so diverse, that there must be many more. Concerning extant retroviruses, the lentiviruses represent the most diverse or complex group. As their fi xation rates are so high, the probability is higher that new surprises will show up within this group rather than others. The biologist J.D. Bernal remarked almost 50 years ago that \" everything that can happen will happen, and nobody will be safe from it. \" While I would not share the rather dark 3 \u0408 end to his remark because we now can, after all, vaccinate against a large number of microbes and successfully treat one human cancer out of two, the 5 \u0408 part is a good pr\u00e9cis of retrovirus evolution."}
