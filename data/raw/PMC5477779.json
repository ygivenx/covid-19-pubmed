{"title": "HIV-1 Frameshift RNA-Targeted Triazoles Inhibit\nPropagation of Replication-Competent and Multi-Drug-Resistant HIV\nin Human Cells", "body": "Peptide precursors to compounds 3\u20137 were synthesized in the solid phase using methods analogous to our\npreviously reported results.20\u221222 Synthesis of 1,4-triazole analogs\nalso provided us with the first opportunity to synthesize and test\nnonsymmetrical N-methylation patterns (e.g., compounds 4, 5, and 6),\nas previous attempts to accomplish this using on-bead olefin cross-metathesis\nhad met with modest yields, at best. The Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition\nwas conducted on resin using methodology described by Meldal and co-workers.38 In each case, this method provided the desired\ncompound following cleavage from the resin and concomitant deprotection\nas a single major peak by analytical HPLC.\n\nIn previous work,\nwe have monitored binding-dependent quenching\nof benzo[g]quinoline fluorescence to determine dissociation constants.21,22 Unfortunately, initial attempts to measure the affinity of triazole-containing\ncompounds for the HIV-1 FSS RNA by fluorescence titration were unsuccessful\ndue to irreversible photobleaching of the compounds. Therefore, we\nmeasured binding constants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Table 1). In this assay,\nRNA is immobilized on the SPR chip while the compound is flowed through\nin solution. This allows for determination of kinetic rate constants\nof binding as well as thermodynamic parameters.39 A comparison of the measured affinities for 1 and 3 indicates that substitution of triazole for olefin\nhas no effect on affinity (within error). N-methylation\nof 3 had only a modest effect on affinity; compound 7 displayed the highest affinity with a binding constant 6-fold\ntighter than 3. As with previously described N-methyl amide analogs such as 2, affinity\nenhancements are largely driven by an increase in on-rate (ka). This is consistent with the hypothesis that N-methylation reduces the complexity of the ground state\nconformational ensemble and favors a conformer or conformers able\nto bind the RNA, and with the known propensity of N-methylation to alter peptide conformation.40 In order to test selectivity, SPR measurements were made using a\ncompetitive assay, in which a mixture of the compound plus a 5-fold\nexcess of yeast tRNA (relative to compound concentration) in solution\nwas flowed over the SPR chip. Of course, this constitutes an even\nlarger excess of tRNA over the amount of HIV-1 FSS RNA immobilized\non the sensor chip, and as such represents a stringent assay. We observed\nthat, of the compounds tested, only 7 showed a significant\nchange in KD in the presence of tRNA.\n\nCellular permeability and toxicity\nwere assessed in HEK293T cells.\nToxicity was first examined via WST-1 assay.41 All triazole-containing compounds were significantly\nless toxic than previously reported compounds (Figure 3; previous data for 2 are shown\nfor reference). Compound 5 in particular was essentially\nnontoxic up to the highest examined concentration of 110 \u03bcM.\nAlthough previous experiments have produced clustering of toxicity\namong closely related analogs binding the HIV-1 FSS, triazole-containing\ncompounds were found to have a spread of toxicities. Differences between\ncompounds 5 and 6 were particularly unexpected\nas these compounds are chemically similar; while compound 5 has a toxic dose, TD50, of \u2265110 \u03bcM, compound 6 was found to be roughly twice as toxic (TD50 =\n60 \u03bcM). Flow cytometry revealed that the permeability of triazole\nanalogs largely followed their methylation pattern, with tetra-N-methyl compound 7 displaying the greatest\ncell permeability, and the non-N-methylated compound 3 the least (Supporting Information). These results are consistent with trends previously observed for\ncompounds 1 (unmethylated olefin) and 2 (tetramethylated\nolefin), which are provided in the figure for reference.\n\nWe further evaluated compound\nselectivity by examining the effect\nof 0, 6.83, and 20 \u03bcM concentrations of compound 7 on HEK293T cells by RNaseq. A total of 17 872 transcripts\nwere analyzed for each condition. The set of significantly altered\ngenes relative to control (0 \u03bcM compound) for the two concentrations\nwas compared using the Web tool InteractiVenn.42 One of the 6.83 \u03bcM-treated samples behaved as an\noutlier, and therefore the analysis was conducted both with and without\nconsidering this sample. Disregarding the outlier sample revealed\n53 transcripts with a statistically significant change in both the\n6.8 and 20 \u03bcM compound-treated conditions (Figure 4). Of these, only two showed\na greater than 2-fold change (considered biologically significant4) in both sets: Genbank IDs RWDD4P2 and ElF4A1P2, both\npseudogenes. Inclusion of the outlier sample in the analysis resulted\nin only a subset (13) of these transcripts called differentially expressed.\nTherefore, although we cannot a priori conclude that\ninclusion of the outlier is not biologically relevant, its exclusion\nproduces the most conservative estimate of compound 7\u2019s effect on HEK293T cells. The 20 \u03bcM-treated samples\nshowed a few additional transcripts with significant changes. These\nincluded the expressed genes early growth response 1 (EGR1; log2(fold change) = 1.69), microtubule associated protein 1 light\nchain 3 beta 2 (MAP1LC3B2; log2(fold change) = 5.56), phosphatidylinositol\n4-kinase type 2 beta (PI4KIIB; log2(fold change) = \u22121.66),\nand ubiquitin specific peptidase 41 (USP41; log2(fold change\n= \u22127.85). While the tested concentration is lower than that\nat which changes in WST-1 metabolism indicative of toxicity were observed\n(vide supra) for compound 7, these additional\nchanges may reflect compound-dependent increases in cell stress and\nwill be examined further. Overall, however, the low number of significantly\naltered transcripts, and in particular the near absence of expressed\ngenes altered, highlights the selectivity of compound 7 despite its status as the least-selective of the triazole analogs\nstudied, based on tRNA competition SPR.\n\nWe next examined the effect of\ntriazole-containing FSS RNA binders\non pseudotyped HIV virion production and infectivity. In this system,43 HEK293T producer cells are first transfected\nwith a proviral HIV plasmid modified such that the env gene is deleted, and the nef gene is replaced with\ngreen fluorescent protein (GFP) to assist with virion detection and\nquantitation. Cotransfection of a vesicular stomatitis virus type\nG (VSV-G) plasmid provides the envelope functionality in trans to\nenable production of single-cycle infectious virions. Visualizing\nGFP production through fluorescence microscopy also allows for a qualitative\nassessment of virion production in producer cells. Virions produced\nafter a 24-h incubation with various concentrations of compounds were\nharvested and used to infect TZM-bl reporter cells with virion quantities\nfirst normalized via a p24 ELISA assay. TZM-bl cells\nexpress luciferase upon infection with HIV44 (via the HIV LTR promoter), providing a quantitative\nreadout of infectivity. Indinavir, an FDA-approved protease inhibitor,45 was employed as a positive control. We observed\nthat compounds 3\u20137 substantially\ndecreased virion production in a concentration dependent manner, as\nevidenced by a decrease in GFP fluorescence (Supporting Information). Virions produced were less infectious, and infectivity\ndecreased strongly with increasing concentration of the compound (Figure 5a). New compounds\nwere slightly less effective than previously reported compound 2; this is offset by their significantly lower toxicity.\n\nWestern blots were used to assess the effect of FSS-binding\ncompounds\non the Gag/Gag-Pol ratio. Using a p24 antibody as a probe, all new\ncompounds were found to increase the amount of Gag-Pol relative to\nGag, with 5, 6, and 7 having\nthe strongest effect (Figure 5b). We also examined lysates from compound-treated producer\ncells by Western blot. No significant changes in Gag/Gag-Pol ratios\nwere observed relative to control, suggesting that most of the excess\nGag-Pol and its products are packaged into virions (Supporting Information).\n\nTo confirm the activity of\ncompounds in a replication-competent\nvirus, we examined the effect of compounds 2, 3, and 7 on propagation of HIVIIIB, a common\nlaboratory strain,46\u221248 in the human MT-2,49,50 T-cell line.\nCells were first infected with the virus for 8 h in the absence of\nthe compound, then spun down and resuspended in fresh media. Varying\nconcentrations of compounds were added, with each condition tested\nin triplicate. In preliminary experiments with compounds 2, 3, and 7, one-half of the medium was\nharvested at 2 days postinfection and replaced with an equivalent\nvolume of medium \u00b1 compound. The medium removed was examined\nfor viral particles using a p24 ELISA assay. This procedure was repeated\nat days 4 and 6 postinfection. These experiments revealed a dose-\nand time-dependent inhibition of HIVIIIB for all three\ncompounds (Supporting Information), with\nvery low (compound 3) or undetectable (compounds 5 and 7) levels of virus present for the highest\ndoses at days 4 and 6 postinfection. Subsequently, full dose\u2013response\nprofiles were obtained for compounds 3, 4, 5, and 7, at 6 days postinfection (Figure 6). IC50 values were obtained via four-parameter logistic\nfits of these data. They indicate similar potencies for 3, 4, and 5 (15.33, 10.17, and 14.23 \u03bcM,\nrespectively), and a somewhat higher potency for compound 7 (4.86 \u03bcM). Decreases in virus were not due to inhibition of\ncell growth; indeed, more cells were present in the compound-treated\nwells than in the untreated but virus-infected wells at day 6 (Supporting Information), as measured by Alamar\nblue assay. This effect is striking and consistent with compound-mediated\nprotection from virus-induced apoptosis. Such an effect has been seen\nwith other anti-HIV agents.51 Compound 7 proved toxic to HIV-infected MT-2 cells at concentrations\nabove 15 \u03bcM.\n\nBecause FSS-targeted compounds inhibit HIV-1 via a different mechanism than existing antivirals, we also examined\nthe ability of 3, 4, 5, and 7 to inhibit a multidrug-resistant strain of the virus. The\npatient-derived strain HIV-1 AD.MDR01 is resistant to a broad range\nof protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,\nand nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It is also highly\ncytopathic.52,53 Using a similar protocol to that\nemployed for the HIVIIIB experiments detailed above, HIV-1\nAD.MDR01 infected human MT-2 cells were treated with 15 \u03bcM doses\nof 3, 4, 5, and 7 and evaluated both for production of the virus (p24 ELISA) and cell\nsurvival (Alamar blue) at 6 days postinfection. We were gratified\nto observe that compound 7 inhibited this strain, and\nboth 4 and 7 provided statistically significant\nprotection against its cytopathic effect (Figure 7).\n\nThere is a continuing need to develop new anti-HIV therapies,\nand\nparticularly to explore novel therapeutic targets.54 The HIV frameshift has been recognized for some time as\nan attractive potential avenue to viral inhibition, but previously\nthe lack of effective strategies for sequence-selective RNA recognition\nhas made addressing this target a challenge. Our past work demonstrated\nthe feasibility of degrading the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV via FSS RNA-targeted compounds. Here, we demonstrate for\nthe first time that this strategy can also yield compounds able to\nstrongly inhibit replication of a laboratory strain of HIV in human\nT cells, and one compound inhibits a highly cytopathic, multidrug-resistant\nstrain. This is a critical step in the validation of the HIV-1 FSS\nRNA as a therapeutic target. It is also important to note that frameshifting\nis not limited to HIV-1. It is widely used in many pathogenic viruses\n(for example, the SARS coronavirus55,56 and HTLV-257) and also in eukaryotes, including humans.58,13,59 These recoding processes are\nall possible control points for driving therapeutic outcomes. As such,\nthe approach we have applied to frameshifting in HIV-1 should be extendable\nto synthetic molecule control over a broad range of recoding events.\nIn the broader context of RNA recognition, this work also demonstrates\nthat the use of 1,4-disubsituted triazoles as disulfide bioisosteres\nis effective.\n\nStructures\ndepicted in Figure 2 were minimized with GAMESS60 version\n1 May 2013 (R1) using the B3LYP61 density\nfunctional method and the 6-31g(d) basis set. van der Waals surfaces\ncolored by electrostatic potential were visualized with Avogadro 1.1.1.\n\nCompounds were synthesized using standard solid phase peptide protocols.\nWang Resin (0.22 mmol/gram for alkyne containing monomers, 0.68 mmol/gram\nfor azide containing monomers) was activated with carbonyl diimidazole\n(CDI, 10 equiv) in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 4 h followed by treatment\nwith 1,3-diaminopropane (10 equiv) in DMF for 4 h. Amino acids were\ncoupled using 3.1 equiv of Fmoc-AA\u2013OH, where AA is Phe, Pro,\nPra, Aha, or N-Me-Phe; 2.9 equiv of HATU, and 5 equiv of DIPEA in\nDMF for 2 h. Deprotection of Fmoc was accomplished using 20% piperidine\nin DMF for 1 h. Where N-Me amino acids were needed that were not commercially\navailable, Fmoc was first removed using standard methods followed\nby treatment of the resin with 3 equiv of 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride\n(NOSYL-Cl) and 5 equiv of collidine in DCM for 2 h. This activated\nresin was then treated with 8 mL of TMS-diazomethane and 0.5 mL of\nmethanol in DCM overnight. Methylation was monitored by HPLC. To remove\nthe NOSYL group, resin was treated with 3 equiv of 2-mercaptoethanol\nand 5 equiv of DBU for 1 h.62 The end of\neach monomer was capped with benzo[g]quinoline. To form the 1,4 substituted\ntriazole ring, the azide-containing peptide was cleaved with 98% trifuoroacetic\nacid (TFA), 1% triethyl silane (TES), and 1% water, and ether was\nprecipitated to yield a crude yellow solid that was used without further\npurification. Next, the resin-bound alkyne was dried under a vacuum,\nand washed three times with dry THF. CuI (2 equiv) and DIPEA (50 equiv)\nwere added to the vessel in anhydrous THF. After mixing for 15 min,\nazide (2 equiv based on resin loading) was added, and the resulting\ngreen/brown solution mixed overnight. The resin was then washed three\ntimes with THF, three times with DCM, three times with DMF, and three\ntimes with DCM, then cleaved with 98% TFA, 1% TES, and 1% water for\n2 h followed by rotary evaporation and ether precipitation.\n\nSPR was conducted using a\nBiacore X (Biacore, Inc.) instrument. Streptavidin was immobilized\nto 7500 RU in both flow cells using EDC/NHS coupling to a CM5 chip\n(GE). The surface was then blocked with ethanolamine. Next, 50 \u03bcM\n5\u2032-biotin HIV-1 FSS (obtained as an HPLC-purified sample from\nIntegrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) was refolded in 10 mM HEPES and\n150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 by heating at 98 \u00b0C in a heater block for\n2 min then cooled to RT and immobilized on one flow cell of the SPR\nchip to a density of 1100 RU. The control flow cell was then blocked\nwith an injection of 50 \u03bcM biotin in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM\nNaCl at pH 7.4. Compounds were injected at a flow rate of 50 \u03bcL/min\nin 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% tween at pH 7.4 for 1 min.\nEach injection was repeated twice for consistency. Each trace was\nfit individually to a Langmuir model.\n\nHEK293T cells were plated\nat 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate in DMEM with\n10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C.\nAfter cells were allowed to adhere for 6 h, they were then incubated\nwith the compound for 24 h in triplicate. A total of 10 \u03bcL of\nWST-1 premix (Clontech) was added and incubated for 1 h followed by\nmeasurement using a PerkinElmer EnSpire plate reader. Lines provided\nare a logistical fit of the data.\n\nHEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with\n10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin at 37\n\u00b0C to 80% confluency in a 12-well plate and treated with the\ncompound for 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed twice\nwith DPBS (Gibco). Cells were then resuspended in 300 \u03bcL of\nice cold DPBS and incubated with 5 \u03bcL of propidium iodide to\nstain dead cells. A total of 10 000 events were collected using\na BD LSR-II flow cytometer.\n\nHEK293T cells were plated\nin six-well plates\nand allowed to grow to 80% confluencey (about 1 million cells), then\ntreated with 0, 6.83, and 20 \u03bcM 7 for 24 h in triplicate.\nCells were then processed according to validated protocols developed\nby the University of Rochester Genomics Research Center and analyzed\nfor RNAseq (Illumina). Sequenced reads were cleaned according to a\nrigorous preprocessing workflow (Trimmomatic-0.3263) before being mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p2)\nwith STAR-2.4.2a.64 Cufflinks2.0.265 with gencode version 23 human gene annotations\nwas then used to perform differential expression analysis with a false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 (95% confidence interval).\n\nThe antiviral activity\nof all RNA-targeted compounds was measured by single-round infectivity\nassay with pseudotyped HIV-1 using HEK293T producer cells. The HIV-1\nproviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP) includes all HIV-1 NL4\u20133 genes\nexcept nef (replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol,\nand the frameshift required for production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein.\nA single-round infectivity assay was conducted by transient transfection\nof the viral vector with VSV-G coat protein vector at a ratio of 1:0.5\nusing Fugene HD (Promega). The virus producer cells were dosed with\ncompounds 4 h after transfection, and viral particles were harvested\nfrom the media 24 h after transfecting by filtering through a 0.45-\u03bcm\nsyringe filter. Viral load was normalized with a p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer).\nThe infections were performed using TZM-bl reporter cells containing\nstably integrated firefly luciferase, the expression of which is driven\nby the HIV-LTR promoter. Therefore, luciferase is expressed upon successful\nHIV infection. Triplicate infections in 96-well plates at 10 000\ncells/well with 500 pg p24/well proceeded for 48 h before the addition\nof SteadyGlo reagent (Promega) to each well for 30 min. Luminescence\nwas measured as a quantitative metric for changes in viral infectivity\nin the presence of a compound.\n\nMT-2 cells were obtained from\nthe NIH AIDS Reagent Program and grown\nin RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MT-2\ncells were seeded in a T-75 cell culture flask at 3 \u00d7 106 cells/10 mL and were infected with HIVIIIB at\na concentration of 56.5 ng p24/mL. Infection was allowed to proceed\nfor 8 h in a humidified 37 \u00b0C incubator. Cells were then collected\nby centrifugation at 250g for 5 min. Excess virus\nwas removed, and cells were washed once with dPBS. Cells were then\nresuspended in fresh growth media and plated in a 48-well culture\ndish at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well. Compounds were added to\ncells in triplicate to final concentrations of 20, 6, or 0.6 \u03bcM\nsuch that the total volume was brought to 1 mL/well. On days 2 and\n4 postinfection, 0.5 mL of supernatant was collected from each well\nand replaced with 0.5 mL of fresh media \u00b1 compound of the corresponding\nconcentrations given above. On day 6 postinfection, 0.7 mL of supernatant\nwas collected, and 30 \u03bcL of Alamar Blue Cell Viability reagent\n(ThermoFisher) was added to each well. Alamar Blue fluorescence was\nmeasured at ex/em 535/595 with a 30 nm bandwidth. All supernatant\nwas frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until subsequent analysis of viral\nload via p24 ELISA according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Advanced Bioscience Laboratories). Alamar Blue and ELISA\nplates were read on a DTX880 Mulitmode Detector (Beckman Coulter)."}
