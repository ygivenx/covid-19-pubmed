{"title": "Immune Responses and Histopathological Changes in Rabbits Immunized with Inactivated SARS Coronavirus *", "body": "established a solid bases for effective control and ultimate eradication of the disease (3, 4, 8, 9) . The genomes of SARS-CoV has been mapped and some important structural and functional proteins have been determined, but many features regarding the nosogenesis, the antigenicity and the immuogenicity of SARS-CoV still remain indistinct (2, 7, 10, 17) .\n\nVaccines play a crucial role in the control of infectious diseases. Previous experiences on human antiviral vaccines indicated that inactivated vaccines are much easier to develop and hold more potential.\n\nTo investigate a SARS inactivated vaccine, effectiveness and safety of vaccine are two important aspects. Our efforts have focused on the investigation of the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated SARS-CoV on animals such as mice, rabbits, pigs, and horses (15, 16) . This paper reports the specific antibody kinetics and the histopathological changes in rabbits immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV, which a view to gaining some insight towards the development of SARS inactivated vaccine.\n\nSARS-CoV F69 strain (GenBank AY313906) was isolated from the samples of a onset of SARS patient in Guangdong province, China in 2003, and was screened out as the vaccine strain (5, 18) . Vero E6 cells were cultivated routinely with MEM medium containing no bovine serum, followed by infection with F69 strain virus. After the cytopathic effect (CPE) reached more than 75%, the cell suspension was frozen and thawed three times, and stored at -7 .\n\nThe titer of virus suspension was 10 6.7 TCID 50 /mL determined with micro-plate CPE method.\n\nLarge-scale cultivated F69 virus suspension was inactivated with 0.4% formaldehyde (v/v) for 24 h at 37 , and the inactivation efficiency (100%) was precisely identified (6) . After centrifugation at 4 000\u00d7 g for 30 min to remove precipitate, the virus supernatant Table 1 .\n\nEight batches of blood were sampled from the auricular vein at day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 38, 42 and 51.\n\nSerum was separated by centrifugation at 2 500\u00d7g for 10 min and stored at -20 .\n\nThe titer of serum specific IgG antibody was measured \n\nOn day 51 after the first vaccination, all the rabbits were sacrified, then autopsied to gain the lung, liver, heart, spleen, kidney and testis. Tissues of the sampled organs were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and routinely processed for paraffin embedding. Serial 4 m sections were cut from each block. The tissue slices were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin dyes (H&E), and detected with photomicrography.\n\nAntibody titers of eight batches of serum samples from day 7 to day 51 were measured by indirect ELISA (Fig.1) and control group (G3), the sera all were negative.\n\nThe inactivated SARS-CoV antigen elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses (Fig. 2) . On day 14,\n\nneutralizing antibody was detected in the experimental \n\nIn experimental group (G1), no obvious histopathological changes were detected in H&E stained tissue slides of the heart, spleen, kidney, testis, but the liver tissues had slight histopathological changes, while the "}
