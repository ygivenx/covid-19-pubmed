{"title": "Additional Data Sets Hepatitis C virus", "body": "The identification of transmission clusters is irrelevant in flu as the virus is transmitted so rapidly and so frequently that it is highly unlikely that transmission pairs will be sampled. Instead, we have used the CP to down sample a dataset of sequences while maintaining its full genetic diversity. This might be useful for downstream analyses in BEAST [3] , or to investigate the effects of sampling. In the present analysis, the CP was run with the aim of downsizing the dataset from 2989 sequences to ~150. All PB2 avian influenza A sequences were downloaded from NCBI Influenza Virus Resource [4] , duplicate sequences were removed, and a phylogenetic tree reconstructed in FastTree. The CP was run with a series of thresholds (using the command line version) until we found a threshold which maximized inclusion of sequences in ~150 clusters. 70% bootstrap and 6% genetic distance thresholds yielded 158 clusters containing 98% of sequences. A single sequence from each cluster was selected for further analysis (L. Lu, manuscript in preparation).\n\nWe used the CP in a BEAST Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) [3] tree comprising 492 full genome H1N1 human pandemic sequences (segments concatenated, excluding PB1), mostly from the Spring and Fall waves of the pandemic (2009-2010). Details of the sequences and BEAST tree models can be found in the original publication [5] . The BEAST MCC tree was generated with Tree Annotator (distributed with BEAST) in the extended nexus format, and was converted into a newick format with the posterior probabilities encoded as support values at the nodes using an R script MCC_to_NWK.R (see the Tutorial files). Initial and main support thresholds of 0.7 were used together with a genetic distance threshold of 2%. These resulted in three large clusters, broadly corresponding to the initial clades present in the USA at the start of the pandemic as determined by hand on a maximum likelihood tree on USA only data [6] . The largest of these clusters (Cluster3, purple) corresponds to \"Global Clade 7\", which became dominant in Wave 2 of the pandemic. A data set comprising 1027 H3N2 human seasonal influenza full length haemagglutinin sequences, from 2004 -2012 was obtained from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource [4] . Sequences from each isolate were classified by global region (North, Tropical and South), continent and year, similar to the H3N2 Global Migration Dynamics study by Bedford et al [7] . Time resolved trees were generated using BEAST with the SRD06 nucleotide model, the relaxed lognormal uncorrelated clock and constant population size. Two independent runs of 500,000,000 MCMC samples (step 10,000) were combined, and the final MCC tree was converted to newick format (using MCC_to_NWK.R). The CP was used with initial and main support thresholds of 0.7, and genetic distance threshold of 2% to reveal 93 clusters, including 76% of the sequences. The composition of the clusters was analyzed with the CM. We found that on average 76% of the sequences in a large cluster (>= 20 sequences) were isolated in the same year, 72% of them were isolated in the same global region (North, Tropical, South) but only 66% in the same continent.
