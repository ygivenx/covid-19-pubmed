{"title": "Chemogenetic evidence that rapid neuronal de novo protein synthesis is 3 required for consolidation of long-term memory Introduction 82", "body": "4 of associative memories, and is thought to remove the constraint on general translation 14, 18 . Here, we have developed a novel cell type-specific drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibitor (ciPSI) that utilizes an inducible Nes.iPKR pan-neuronal ciPSI knock-in mice, which were viable and fertile. The Nes-iPKR mice expressed\n\nEGFP-L10 in all neurons in the amygdala, as marked by complete overlap with NeuN staining (Fig. 1d) , as well 162 as in cortical areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory cortex, and hippocampal areas, 163 CA1 and CA3, and the dentate gyrus (Supplemental Fig. 2c-g) . Despite heterozygous deletion of Eef1a1 allele 164 and expression of the multicistronic cassette in Nes.iPKR mice, the mice displayed normal spontaneous 165 locomotion as well as thigmotaxis in open field tests (Supplemental Fig. 3a-c) .\n\nTo test the efficiency of ciPSI in blocking protein synthesis ex vivo, amygdala slices of Nes.iPKR mice 168 and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino-acid tagging (BONCAT) 27 surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) 28 , that measures translation elongation and is amenable for in vivo 174 labeling, was used to test ciPSI efficiency in awake behaving mice. SUnSET immunoblot showed that 175 Nes.iPKR mice centrally infused with 150 pg ASV exhibited a robust decrease in protein synthesis (~50%) 176 compared to controls (Fig. 2b) . The inhibition of protein synthesis was concomitant with a specific increase in 177 phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at 1h post ASV treatment both ex vivo (Fig. 2c ) and in vivo (Fig. 2d) , with no effect 178 on either the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) 179 pathways (Fig. 2d ). Next, we investigated the ASV pharmacokinetics in Nes.iPKR amygdala lysates by 180 harvesting tissue at increasing time points after drug infusion. We found that peak expression of iPKR is 181 reached at 0.5h, which steadily declines at 1h and 3h and is completely degraded by 6h (Fig. 2e) .\n\nSubsequently, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 steadily increased at 0.5h and 1h and then declined to baseline at 3h.\n\nAs a result of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, proteins whose transcripts harbor uORFs, specifically ATF4 and 184 GADD34, accumulated and remained at higher levels compared to control until 3h (Fig. 2e) . GADD34 is the 185 regulatory subunit of the eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase 17 , and the negative feedback due to increased GADD34 levels 186 combined with the degradation of iPKR by NS3/4 protease at 3h time point might be responsible for reduced synthesis 29, 30 . To determine whether chemogenetic inhibition of pan-neuronal protein synthesis influences persistent cortical and thalamic input-specific synaptic potentiation in principal excitatory neurons within LA 37, 232 38 . Thus, we asked whether de novo protein synthesis in CamK2\u03b1-positive principal neurons in LA is necessary 233 for aversive memory consolidation. We virally delivered CamK2\u03b1.Cre.EGFP into the bilateral LA of iPKR mice 234 and control mice (Fig. 4a) . Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was increased specifically in CamK2\u03b1.iPKR neurons 235 compared to wild-type mice and non-EGFP positive neurons in the same animals ( Fig. 4b) with a 236 corresponding decrease in de novo translation (Fig. 4c ) upon ASV administration. CamK2\u03b1.iPKR mice were 237 threat conditioned as previously and centrally infused with ASV immediately after training (Fig. 4d ).\n\nCamK2\u03b1.iPKR mice were comparable to wild-type controls in memory acquisition (Fig. 4e ), but LTM tested 24h 239 later was significantly impaired (Fig. 4f-h) . This LTM consolidation deficit with ciPSI was prevented by pre-240 training administration of ISRIB, a drug that rescues the p-eIF2\u03b1 mediated constraint on general translation by 241 enhancing the activity of eIF2B ( Fig. 4g -h) 39 . We also tested ASV-treated CamK2\u03b1.iPKR mice in open field test 242 and elevated plus maze to gauze anxiety related behaviors and found that although spontaneous locomotion \n\nIt is evident that the translation program regulated by eIF2\u03b1 is necessary for LTM consolidation; 247 however, the accumulation of ATF4 raises the question of whether it is either decreased protein synthesis or 248 increased ATF4 levels causing the memory deficit. Indeed, a previous study has reported that even in the Fig. 5b ), but strongly impaired LTM (Supplemental 261 Fig. 5c and d) . Together, the LTM deficit observed using two independent approaches for blocking translation 262 initiation in CamK2\u03b1.iPKR and CamK2\u03b1.4Ekd respectively strongly support our hypothesis that de novo 263 translation in LA Camk2\u03b1+ neurons is necessary for consolidation of long-term threat memories.\n\n.

Congruently, although all of the mice learned auditory threat 274 conditioning (Fig. 5c) CamK2a.iPKR mice were completely rescued by dephosphorylating both alleles of eIF2\u03b1, but was unaltered by 280 dephosphorylating one allele of eIF2\u03b1 ( Fig. 5e-f ). This indicated that the translation tone and LTM 281 consolidation process is set by the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, even when the abundance of phosphorylatable 282 eIF2\u03b1 is reduced by half, and confirmed that the memory deficit caused by iPKR is through the phosphorylation 283 of eIF2\u03b1 and not due to non-specific cellular toxicity.\n\nNotably, the memory enhancement in the CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice came with a cost. We found that 286 the dysregulated increase in translation tone in CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice resulted in impaired behavioral 287 flexibility during the tone offset in LTM test. CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice freeze starting at tone onset, but 288 continue to freeze after the tone offset during inter-trial interval epochs (Supplemental Fig. 6b and Fig. 5g ).\n\nThis failure to switch off defensive state is triggered only after the onset of first tone while at pre-conditioned The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We injected a cocktail of AAV.CamK2\u03b1.Cre together with control mice in a differential threat conditioning paradigm that involves three interleaved presentations of a 307 paired tone (CS+) and an unpaired tone (CS-) in a single session (Fig. 6c-d) . Consistent with earlier data, post-308 training ASV infusion impaired LTM and led to a significant decline in freezing response to paired tone ( Fig. 6f \n\nTo further understand what happens when eIF2\u03b1-controlled general translation in LA principal neurons 319 is boosted during consolidation of a complex memory, we explored differential threat conditioning in CamK2\u03b1 320 eIF2\u03b1 S51A mice (Supplemental Fig. 7c ). We found that whereas homozygous CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) mice can 321 discriminate between CS+ and CS-during LTM, they have a significantly increased freezing response to CS-.\n\nOn the other hand, CamK2\u03b1 wild-type mice robustly discriminated CS+ from CS-and displayed negligible 323 freezing response to CS-(Supplemental Fig. 7d ). The enhanced CS-response in theCamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) 324 mice resulted in a poor discrimination index (Supplemental Fig. 7e ). We next examined the freezing during ITI, 325 and found that similar to earlier results with simple threat conditioning, CamK2\u03b1.eIF2\u03b1 (A/A) exhibited a 326 significantly increased freezing response following tone offset, indicating behavioral inflexibility (Supplemental 327 Fig. 7f \n\nWe have used multi-pronged chemogenetic approaches to investigate the translational control of long- \n\nThe electrophysiology experiments were performed as previously described 29, 51 and mice were between 2 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
