{"title": "Chemical Constituents and an Antineuroinflammatory Lignan, Savinin from the Roots of Acanthopanax henryi", "body": "Neuroinflammatory responses are mainly mediated by microglial activation, and they are implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [1]. Microglial cells are the primary resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are associated with defensive mechanisms to maintain homeostasis against brain injury [2]. In steady state, microglia exert protective responses by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. However, activated microglia produce excess immune reactions which are detrimental to brain tissue and can produce various proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) \u03b1, interleukins (ILs), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Released and accumulated, these proinflammatory mediators facilitate the development of neurodegenerative diseases [3, 4]. Therefore, it is important to suppress the secretion of proinflammatory mediators from activated microglial cells to prevent the neuroinflammation-related development of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\nAcanthopanax spp. is one of the well-known medicinal resources in traditional oriental medicine in China, Korea, Japan, and far-east Russia. Its dried roots and stem barks are famous traditional folk medicine for treating rheumatism, arthritis, paralysis, sinew, and bone pain [5]. Acanthopanax henryi (Oliv.) Harms, a Chinese endemic plant, has been used as a traditional remedy for the treatment of paralysis, arthritis, rheumatism, lameness, edema, injury from falls, hernia, and abdominal pain [6, 7]. Previous phytochemical studies on A. henryi led to the isolation and identification of more than 30 secondary metabolites, including five flavonoids, six caffeoylquinic acid derivatives [6], sixteen triterpenoid saponins [8, 9], one amide, one anthraquinone, one organic acid [9], three lignans, one diterpene, one phenylpropanoid, and two phytosterols [10]. In addition, it has been reported that this plant exhibits diverse pharmacological activities due to the wide variety of chemical constituents. For example, metabolites of the leaves of A. henryi have strong antioxidant and antiacetyl cholinesterase activities [6], and the 80% methanol fraction of root bark and ciwujianoside C3, which was isolated from leaves of this plant, have significant anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells [5, 11]. Moreover, some glycosides from the leaves of A. henryi have antiadipogenic effect, decreasing lipid accumulation through the inhibition of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1) in 3T3-L1 cells [12]. However, it has not been investigated yet whether this plant has antineuroinflammatory effects.\n\nTherefore, in this study, we purified twenty compounds from the roots of A. henryi and evaluated their antineuroinflammatory activity in vitro to continue our approach to contribute to the drug development for inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nNMR spectra (1D and 2D) were recorded using a JEOL JNM ECP-400 spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C). HMQC and HMBC experiments were optimized for 1JCH = 140 Hz and nJCH = 8 Hz, respectively. Optical rotations were recorded using a Jasco p-2000 digital polarimeter (Tokyo, Japan). HPLC (YOUNGLIN-YL9100, Younglin, Anyang, Korea) separation was performed on YMC-Pack ODS-A column (20 \u00d7 150 mm, 5 \u03bcm, and 12 nm) with a flow rate of 5 mL/min and the solvents used for HPLC were analytical grade. ESI-MS data were obtained using a Q-TOF micro-LC-MS/MS instrument (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) at Korea University, Seoul, Korea. TLC was performed on Kieselgel 60 F254 (1.05715; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or RP-18 F254s (Merck) plates. Spots were visualized by spraying with 10% aqueous H2SO4 solution followed by heating. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 70-230 mesh and 230-400 mesh, Merck) and YMC octadecyl-functionalized silica gel (C18). These procedures were based on our previous report [13].\n\nThe roots of A. henryi were collected from its natural habitat in Xinhua, Hunan Province, China, in October 2015 and identified by Professor Xiang Qian Liu, one of the coauthors of this study. A voucher specimen has been deposited in Herbarium of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Hunan, China (No. 20151025)\n\nThe air dried, powdered roots of A. henryi (10 kg) were extracted with methanol under reflux (3 \u00d7 30 L).

(Grand Island, NY, USA). Lipopolysaccharide was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Primary antibodies such as anti-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and anti-cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). Anti-p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), anti-ERK, anti-p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), anti-JNK, anti-p-p38, and anti-p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were supplied by Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for PGE2 was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA).\n\nBV2 microglial cells were received from Professor Hyun Park at Wonkwang University (Iksan, Korea). BV2 cells were maintained at 5 \u00d7 106 cells in a 100 mm dish with DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin G (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), and l-glutamine (2 mM) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\nBV2 cells were cultured in 24-well culture plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well. BV2 cells were pretreated with the isolated compounds from A. henryi and then stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h. After incubation, 100 \u03bcL of each supernatant was collected and mixed with the same volume of the Griess reagent. The absorbance at 540 nm wavelength was measured using a microplate reader. The detailed procedures are described in our previous report [14].\n\nThe level of PGE2 present in each sample was determined using a commercially available kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Three independent assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, BV2 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well. Prior to the stimulation with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h, cells were treated with test compounds. After incubation, supernatant was collected and applied to the PGE2 ELISA kit for measuring the concentration of PGE2.\n\nThe proteins iNOS, COX-2, and MAPK-associated proteins, including p-p38, p38, p-JNK, JNK, p-ERK, and ERK, were detected by a Western blot analysis. The procedures of this experiment were based on our previous report [14]. Cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and normalized for equal amounts of protein using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). 30 \u03bcg of protein was loaded for each sample and separated on 7.5 or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels. Then, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After that, membranes were incubated with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) with 5% skim milk (BD Difco, USA) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Then, membranes were probed with primary antibodies and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 90 min or overnight. After incubation, the membranes were washed with TBS-T, and then secondary antibodies were used for detecting primary antibodies. The protein bands on the NC membranes were covered by chemiluminescence with Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).\n\nThe culture media were collected to determine the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 present in each sample using appropriate ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Inc.), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, BV2 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well. After incubation, the supernatant was collected and applied to the cytokine ELISA kits for measuring the concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1.\n\nThe detailed procedures of qRT-PCR and the primer sequences, which were used in this investigation were reported in our previous investigations [14, 15]. The analysis was conducted three times independently.\n\nData are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test, was used to compare three or more groups. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 3.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nColorless needles (MeOH), [\u03b1]D20 -46.7 (c 6.10, CHCl3), ESI-MS (m/z) 377 [M + Na]+; 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) \u03b4: 3.05 (2H, m, H-8, H-8\u2032), 3.86 (2H, dd, J = 9.2, 3.6 Hz, H-9a, H-9\u2032a), 4.23 (2H, dd, J = 9.2, 6.8 Hz, H-9e, H-9\u2032e), 4.71 (2H, d, J = 4.4 Hz, H-7, H-7\u2032), 5.94 (4H, s, 2OCH2O), 6.76-6.81 (4H, m, H-5, H-6, H-5\u2032, H-6\u2032), 6.84 (2H, d, J = 1.6 Hz, H-2, H-2\u2032); 13C-NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz) \u03b4:148.1 (C-3, C-3\u2032), 147.2 (C-4, C-4\u2032), 135.2 (C-l, C-1\u2032), 119.4 (C-6, C-6\u2032), 108.3 (C-5, C-5\u2032), 106.6 (C-2, C-2\u2032), 101.2 (2OCH2O), 85.9 (C-7, C-7\u2032), 71.8 (C-9, C-9\u2032), 54.4 (C-8, C-8\u2032).

All spectral data agreed with those previously reported [30]. Compound 20 was identified as trans-coniferin.\n\nThe chemical structures of compounds 1\u201320 are shown in Figure 1.\n\nAmong the isolated compounds from A. henryi, we selected 13 compounds (compounds 1\u20133, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 18\u201320) based on their number of publications, and these compounds were screened for anti-inflammatory effects, including the inhibition of NO and PGE2 production, in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. BV2 cells were pretreated with the compounds for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h. The concentration required to inhibit the production of NO by 50% (IC50 value) was calculated based on the concentrations of NO and PGE2 released into the culture media as measured by the Griess method and PGE2 ELISA kit, respectively. Among the tested compounds, only compound 3 showed inhibitory effects against LPS-induced NO production with an IC50 value of 2.22 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcM and LPS-induced PGE2 production with an IC50 value of 2.28 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcM. The IC50 values of butein, a positive control, were 4.41 \u00b1 0.45 \u03bcM in NO production and 3.26 \u00b1 0.53 \u03bcM in PGE2 production, respectively. At tested concentrations, all test compounds did not show cytotoxic effects to BV2 cells (data not shown). Therefore, compound 3 was further investigated to elucidate the up-stream signaling pathways of its antineuroinflammatory effect.\n\nInhibition of iNOS and COX-2 protein expression could be an important strategy to prevent neuroinflammation. In the present study, it was investigated whether compound 3 inhibits LPS-induced overexpression of iNOS and COX-2 protein in BV2 cells. BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h. As a result, LPS augmented the expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins; however, pretreatment with compound 3 reversed these responses (Figure 2).\n\nTo investigate whether compound 3 inhibits the production of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h. Pretreatment with compound 3 attenuated the LPS-induced production of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, but it had little effect on IL-6 production (Figures 3(a)\u20133(c)). Subsequently, to elucidate how compound 3 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, the mRNA levels of the cytokines were examined. BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 6 h. Consistent with the results obtained from the cytokine production data, pretreatment with compound 3 reduced the LPS-induced mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, but it did not affect to mRNA level of IL-6 (Figures 3(d)\u20133(f)). These results suggested that compound 3 exhibits the antineuroinflammatory effects by negatively regulating the production of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 at the transcriptional level in LPS-challenged BV2 microglial cells.\n\nWe examined whether the antineuroinflammatory effects of compound 3 contribute to the inactivation of MAPK in the present study. BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 30 min. LPS markedly increased the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK. Pretreatment with compound 3 inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 (Figure 4(a)), but it had no effect on the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK (Figures 4(b) and 4(c)).\n\nThe present study demonstrated that compound 3 (savinin), one of the isolated compounds from the roots of A. henryi exerted antineuroinflammatory effects in LPS-treated microglial cells. Compound 3 inhibited LPS-induced the release of proinflammatory mediators, including NO, PGE2, iNOS, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. These inhibitory effects of compound 3 were mediated by the inactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway.\n\nNO and PGE2, as well as their regulatory enzymes iNOS and COX-2, are important mediators for neuroinflammation. They are involved in the pathogenesis of various neuroinflammatory pathophysiological conditions [31]. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, are important factors in CNS immune responses, and mediate neurodegeneration [3]. Microglial cells are activated by various stimuli. The activation of these cells leads to the release of these proinflammatory mediators and the exacerbation of neuroinflammation and neuroglia-induced neurotoxicity [31, 32]. Our investigation showed that compound 3, isolated from A. henryi, suppressed NO and PGE2 production in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and also inhibited the LPS-induced expression of the iNOS and COX-2 protein (Figure 2). Additionally, the present data indicated that compound 3 significantly suppressed the release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-6, at the protein and mRNA levels (Figure 3).\n\nMAPKs are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, and they consist of three major subunits: p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). MAPKs are involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, stress responses, and immune responses [33]. In inflammatory responses, the activation of MAPKs leads to release of inflammatory-related factors, such as iNOS, COX-2, ILs, and TNF-\u03b1 [34]. Therefore, we further investigated whether the antineuroinflammatory effects of compound 3 in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells were related to the inactivation of MAPKs. Our results showed that compound 3 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but it did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK MAPKs.\n\nNuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is one of the major transcription factors regulating inflammatory responses. When microglial cells are stimulated with ILs, TNF-\u03b1, interferons, or LPS, NF-\u03baB can be activated following increased translocation of p65 and p50, which are subunits of the NF-\u03baB dimer, into the nucleus, as well as the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (I\u03baB)-\u03b1 in the cytosol [35]. This response upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in microglial cells [1]. Therefore, NF-\u03baB can be an important target for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, pretreatment with compound 3 did not decrease the nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 or the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 (data not shown). Considering the effect of compound 3 on the LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, it is suggested that compound 3 exerted antineuroinflammatory effects by specifically inactivating the p38 MAPK pathway.\n\nVarious pharmacological activities of lignans, including compound 3 (savinin), have been reported. These activities include cytotoxic effects against human cancer cell lines [36], CYP3A4 inactivation [37], antisevere acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activity [38], inhibition of PGE2 production in rat peritoneal macrophages [39], antiestrogenic [40], insecticidal [41], and inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production in RAW264.7 macrophage cells [42]; however, this is the first finding on the antineuroinflammatory effects of compound 3 (savinin) to the best of our knowledge.\n\nIn summary, 20 secondary metabolites were isolated from the EtOAc-, butanol-, and PE-soluble fractions of the methanol extract of Acanthopanax henryi roots. Among these compounds, savinin (compound 3) was the only compound which inhibited the production of NO and PGE2, and the expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. In addition, this compound significantly suppressed the release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 at the protein and mRNA levels. These inhibitory effects of compound 3 were mediated by p38 MAPK, but not ERK and JNK MAPKs. Taken together, our investigation showed that compound 3 can be a promising candidate for the development of treatment options for neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies elucidating the detailed mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of compound 3 are suggested."}
