{"title": "Nanoyeast\nand Other Cell Envelope Compositions for\nProtein Studies and Biosensor Applications", "body": "Proteins are widely used as biomarker\ntargets for medicine,1 as such protein\ntarget characterization and affinity\nbinder production for proteomic immunosensors2\u22124 are the focus\nof extensive research and development. Proteins and antibodies are\nnaturally produced within a biological environment; however, many\nbiotechnology applications require these biomolecules to be solubilized\nfor further study and use. This is problematic because many of these\nbiomolecules often lose stability (denatures by losing its quaternary,\ntertiary, and secondary structure) once introduced into a foreign\n(non-native) environment. Membrane-bound proteins in particular have\nbeen widely exploited as druggable targets5 but are difficult to study as solubilized targets due to protein\nconformation changes in the absence of a stabilizing lipid or cell\nwall environment. Similarly, synthetic recombinant antibodies produced\nin eukaryotic or prokaryotic production systems commonly lose stability,\nespecially when they originated in a display library. Many strategies\nhave been developed to overcome these stability issues. Particularly\npromising are cell envelope compositions to stabilize proteins and\nrecombinant antibodies in native or native-like environments.\n\nRecombinant antibody fragments are a promising class of protein\ncapture reagents which are poised to complement or replace complete,\nfull-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in immunosensors.2\u22124 These fragments can show identical specificity toward target antigens\nas their parent, full-length mAbs. They also have the added flexibility\nto engineer the fragment antigen binding site, which allows custom\nproduction of reagents with the most sought after affinity traits.\nFurthermore, antibody fragments can be rapidly isolated from libraries\nof antibody fragment genes using various display technologies. They\nare renewable and can be produced in eukaryotic or prokaryotic production\nsystems followed by scale-up manufacture to reduce production costs.6,7 More recently we developed an antibody library biopanning method\nthat utilized whole cells during selections. This ensures the recombinant membrane-bound proteins maintain their\nnative conformation during antibody selections.8\n\nOne of the most common types of antibody fragments\nare single-chain\nvariable fragments (scFvs), which are recombinant polypeptides that\nare composed of a light-chain variable (VL) domain connected by a flexible hydrophilic peptide to a heavy-chain\nvariable (VH) domain.9,10 These\n30 kDa monovalent proteins possess comparable specificity and sensitivity\nto parent mAbs and, due to a lack of a constant domain (Fc) region,\nare capable of superior performance as imaging and diagnostic agents.\nFurthermore, the production pipeline of recombinant immunoaffinity\nreagents could potentially reduce some problems that hamper traditional\nfull-length mAb manufacture,2,3 such as batch to batch\nvariability and a slow drift in the quality of immunoaffinity reagents\nover time.2,11\n\nDespite these advantages, many solubly\nexpressed scFvs suffer from\nstability problems.12\u221214 This necessitates new designs and strategies to produce\nstable protein capture agents.12,15\u221217 Membrane and cell wall proteins similarly suffer from stability\nproblems once solubilized from their native membrane environment.\nBiological nanocontainers and other strategies have been developed\nto stabilize membrane proteins by maintaining a native or native-like\nlipid environment during protein studies.18\u221223 This approach of stabilizing surface proteins in a native environment\nhas been adapted to stabilize recombinant antibody fragments from\nyeast display libraries.24\u221230 ScFvs are stabilized by maintaining the native cell wall environment\nof the yeast display library from which they were selected. The yeast\ncell wall is comprised of a semirigid polysaccharide/lipid/protein\nmatrix, which provides structure and rigidity to the cell, protection\nagainst physical stress, and a scaffold for surface proteins.31 Although there are many differences between\ncell membranes and yeast cell walls, both cell envelope approaches\nutilize the principle of stabilizing molecules in native or native-like\nenvironments to avoid issues with solubilization that can plague proteins\nand antibodies during protein studies.\n\nHerein, we highlight\nbiological compositions which maintain membrane\nprotein and scFv stability by retaining native or native-like environments,\nwhich are designed for easy production while maintaining specificity\nand stability when in use with simple detection platforms (Figure 1).\n\nOne approach to creating\nartificial cell envelope compositions is the use of nanodiscs, which\nare discoidal nanoparticles formed by synthetic lipids and surrounded\nby a belt consisting of amphipathic domains and \u03b1-helical proteins\ncalled membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs).18,19,40\u221242 The target membrane\nprotein is transiently solubilized with a detergent in the presence\nof phospholipids and an encircling MSP. When the detergent is removed,\nthe target membrane protein simultaneously assembles with the phospholipids\ninto a discoidal bilayer, with the size controlled by the length of\nthe MSP (Figure 2).\nThe standard method for self-assembling an MP into a nanodisc is shown\nin Figure 2, route\n1: after detergent solubilization and purification, the target MP\n(green) is mixed with the membrane scaffold protein (MSP, blue) and\nlipids at the correct stoichiometry, followed by detergent removal\nthrough incubation with hydrophobic beads. Often, however, the MP is\nnot stable in detergent for the extended times needed for purification.\nAlternatively (Figure 2, route 2), the starting membrane or tissue can be directly solubilized\nwith excess lipid and scaffold protein and rapid detergent removal.\nThis results in the placement of the target MP (green), together with\nother MPs (gray) in the tissue, into the nanodisc. Subsequent purification,\noften with an affinity tag, is performed, and the target is stabilized\nin the nanodisc environment. This latter route can also be used to\ngenerate a soluble MP library that faithfully represents the MPs in\nthe starting tissue. The resulting nanodisc keeps the proteins in\nsolution, providing stability by retaining these membrane proteins\na native-like phospholipid bilayer environment. Nanodiscs can be immobilized\nonto surfaces, allowing for kinetic studies and drug binding determination\nto be carried out between soluble molecules and incorporate membrane\nproteins.43,44 Phage display selection can also be performed\nusing nanodisc-bound proteins as targets, to select for high-quality\nsynthetic reagents that bind membrane proteins in native-like lipid\nenvironments.19 Recently, incorporating\ntherapeutic antibodies into nanodiscs was also proposed.45 A critical factor to successfully forming a\nnanodisc relies on ensuring the correct stoichiometry of phospholipids,\nMSP, and target protein.46 Incorrect stoichiometries\nof lipids, MSP, and target protein results in aggregates and varying\nnondiscoidal structures, which are difficult to separate and characterize\nand to isolate the desired nanolipoprotein particles. The nanodisc\nmethod also requires the membrane protein to be assembled from the\ndetergent-solubilized state. Therefore, this method will not work\nif the target protein is already in an aggregated soluble state\u2014where\nthe protein is already in aqueous solution but likely inactive.\n\nStyrene maleic acid lipid\nparticles (SMALPs) allow membrane proteins to remain stabilized by\nuse of a simple organic polymer (SMA copolymer) that is used to directly\nextract proteins from membranes into lipid nanoparticles called SMALPs.47,48 SMALPs contain a central lipid bilayer supported by an outer annulus\nof the SMA polymer. This approach of extracting membrane proteins\nand then placing them into a native lipid environment is similar to\nthe nanodisc method detailed above; however, unlike nanodiscs, the\nSMALP approach does not require the membrane protein to be presolubilized\nin detergent before insertion into the lipid nanoparticle. The SMALP\nstructure is stabilized by the intercalation of hydrophobic styrene\ngroups between the acyl chains of the lipid bilayer, whereas the hydrophilic\nmaleic acid groups are presented to the solvent. The encapsulated\nbilayer retains many of the physical properties of the parent membrane,\nincluding the lipid mixture49 and structural\norganization and phase behavior.50 Although\nthis method is effective in preserving membrane proteins with a native\nlipid envelope, there are some limitations need to be taken into\naccount. The disc shaped SMALP has a maximum nominal diameter of 15\nnm, which corresponds to a molecular mass of less than \u223c400\nkDa.50 Therefore, proteins that are too\nlarge to fit within this limit are unlikely to be solubilized. The\nformation of SMALP also requires a pH above 6.5, which means downstream\nexperiments also need to be carried out at above pH 6.5 to maintain\nthe SMALP structure. The SMA polymer is an effective chelator of divalent\ncations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+, with the chelate\nalso being insoluble.48 As such, downstream\nexperiments that require high concentrations of divalent cations (>5\nnM) could disrupt the SMALP. Divalent cations can be found in membrane\nproteins that bind nucelotides such as ABC transporters and ATPases.\nHowever, experiments could be adjusted with lower concentrations of\nnucelotides to preserve SMALP integrity while still maintaining native\nlevels of membrane protein activity to work around this limitation.\n\nLentivirus particles\nhave been used to present cell membrane proteins on their surface\nto allow for ligand interaction studies in optical biosensors using\nconditions that resemble native in vivo environments.20,51,52 During budding from the cell\nsurface, viruses pull away membrane fragments bearing proteins in\ntheir lipid environment. The authors took advantage of this process\nto present G-protein-couple receptor (GPCR) proteins on the surface\nof lentiviral particles. GPCR proteins were found to incorporate into\nvirions that were easily purified and attached to a biosensor surface.\nThis method eliminated the need for detergents to solubilize these\nGPCR proteins, thus allowing for stable environments to conduct kinetic\nstudies. These studies showed that GPCRs could be stabilized on lentiviral\nsurfaces; however, additional experiments are required to demonstrate\nthe universality of this approach toward displaying and stabilizing\nother membrane proteins for protein interaction and capture studies.\nFurthermore, lentiviral particles applications have so far been limited\nto kinetic studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as a readout\nplatform. For lentiviral particles to be positioned as a universal\nmembrane protein stabilization platform, proof of compatibility with\nother biosensor platforms needs to be conducted. Given that leniviral\nparticles are typically sub-100 nm, it is likely they should be amenable\nin a wide range of biosensor platforms.\n\nImmobilization into liposomes\nhas also shown promise as a method to stabilize membrane proteins\nin a native-like environment, which maintains their functionality.21,53\u221255 Liposomes are spherical nanoparticles with unilamellar\nor multilamellar structures that separate and encapsulate an aqueous\ninterior from bulk aqueous solvent. The lamellae of liposomes are\ncomposed of a bilayer of lipids with a hydrophobic midplane to separate\nthe two aqueous volumes. Interaction of the lipid with membrane proteins\nhas been shown to promote proper orientation, which influences protein\nfunction.22 In this method, membrane-bound\nproteins were purified from their native membrane environment and\nthen further reconstituted into liposomes by comicellization of the\npurified membrane protein in excess of phospholipids and detergents\nto form a solution of lipid/protein/detergent or lipid/detergent micelles.22 Dialysis, dilution, or adsorption are common\nreconstitution methods, with these methods all working by reducing\nthe concentration of the detergent below its critical micelle concentration.\nEach reconstitution method has its disadvantages. Dialysis can take\nweeks in cases where the detergent has low critical micelle concentration\u2014this\nlength of time can result in denaturation of the membrane proteins.\nDilution results in large volumes, which subsequently lowers protein concentrations\u2014making downstream experiments difficult. Detergent adsorption\nby polystyrene beads removes detergents efficiently, but due to its\nrapid and uncontrolled removal, can denature proteins. However, new\npromising methods have been proposed, which aim to remove these limitations,\nimprove yield, and reduce reconstitution time.56 Liposomes also can coencapsulate and co-deliver multiple-sized\ndrug agents.57 Coating liposomes with inert\nhydrophilic polymers (stealth liposomes) such poly(ethylene glycol)\nreduces nonspecific absorption and hence increases circulation times.58 Although liposomes are promising stabilizing\nplatforms for membrane proteins and drug delivery, their size (typically\n100\u2013500 nm for large unilamellar vesicles) can interfere with\nbiosensor surfaces and hence decrease sensitivity in applications\nthat require close proximity between the surface and sensor element\n(e.g., in SPR). However, this size limitation has been overcome by\nthe development of planar lipid membranes, which can be constructed\nat sub-100 nm size ranges.55 Supported-lipid\nbilayers, hybrid bilayer lipid membranes, polymer-cushion membranes,\nand tethered membranes are all different planar lipid models which\naim to mimic the cell membrane structurally, allowing membrane proteins\nto retain their structural integrity and functionality across many\nprotein applications.59 These particular\nmodels require the use of solid supports in which different lipid\ncompositions aim to provide a native-like environment for protein\nstudies.\n\nCellular\nhigh-throughput\nencapsulation, solubilization, and screening (CHESS) is a recently\ndeveloped method that generates detergent-resistant containers from\nsingle cells, by physically enclosing detergent-solubilized integral\nmembrane proteins (IMPs), which allows for direct selection of detergent-stable\nIMPs from diverse display libraries (Figure 3).23,60 CHESS encapsulates\nsingle Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells from a library, with each expressing a different G protein-coupled\nreceptor (GPCR) variant, to form detergent-resistant, semipermeable\nnanocontainers. These containers resist solubilization by detergents,\nwhich allow GPCRs to be solubilized in situ while maintaining an\nassociation with the protein\u2019s genetic information. The pore\nsize of the nanocontainer is controlled to permit GPCR ligands to\npermeate, but also allowing the solubilized receptor to remain within\nthe nanocapsule. Fluorescently labeled ligands are then used to bind\nto those GPCR variants inside the nanocontainers that remain active\nin detergent. Recently CHESS has been developed to evolve stable and soluble proteins directly.60 The protein\nsuperfolder GFP was evolved using CHESS to become resistant to detergents\nincluding sodium dodecyl sulfate, high temperatures, and low pH. This\nallowed large libraries of soluble proteins to be directly screened\nfor stability under these conditions. Some limitations remain, including\nthe requirement to link a target protein to a fusion molecule so that its molecular\nweight is greater than 70 kDa (this prevents the protein from diffusing\nout of the nanocontainer). Although low-pH (<6) conditions resulted\nin some viable nanocapsules, many aggregated, which suggests that\nfurther optimizations remain in sample preparation and reducing exposure\ntime to maximize the selection of viable soluble proteins in acidic\nconditions. High-pH (<9) conditions resulted in dissolutions of\nthe nanocapsules, which suggests that alternative nanocapsule coatings\nwould be required to select for viable proteins in high-pH conditions.\nCurrently, CHESS also requires a fluorescent readout to determine protein\nstability for fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) selection.\nHowever, FACS is a powerful system for rapidly sorting cells, and\nas such, coupled with CHESS, allows for the direct selection of rare\nmutations that infer increases in protein stability under abnormal\ncell conditions. Together, these methods demonstrate the approach\nof using cell envelopes to stabilize membrane proteins in native or\nnative-like lipid environments for protein studies.\n\nMammalian membrane\ncells are other useful compositions that can\nbe used in protein and cellular studies. There are several studies\nusing membrane fragments from mammalian cells for fundamental studies\nsuch as cell\u2013cell interaction, toxin absorption and cancer therapy\nto take advantage of the unique structure and property of cell plasma\nmembranes.61\u221266 Similar to stealth liposomes, cell membrane capsules (CMC) have\nbeen used to encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs.62,63 These drugs are typically rapidly cleared in their free form and\nlack cancer cell specificity. Synthetic nanoparticles have been commonly\nused to deliver these drugs, but can be recognized by the immune system.\nAs such, natural approaches such as CMC allow for drug delivery while\nevading the body\u2019s defense mechanisms due to its structural\ncomposition of cell membrane proteins and lipids, allowing for good\nbiocompatibility. CMCs can also be used for controlled loading release\nof encapsulated reagents.63 CMCs are nontoxic\nand can effectively minimize recognition and internalization by macrophages,\nthus evading immune attack in the body. CMCs are intrinsically biocompatible\nand functional drug delivery and release vehicles. CMCs in the form\nof tumor cell-derived microparticles can also be used as vectors to\ndeliver chemotherapeutic drugs. These cellular membrane microparticles\nare safer and self-friendlier, with reduced toxicity (i.e., do not\ninduce autoimmunity). Their micrometer size is much larger than physiological\ncapillary gaps that are around 5\u20138 nm, which prevents these\nmicrometer-sized particles from reaching normal tissue and causing\ndamage. Other applications of membrane compositions involved the use\nof mammalian cell-derived native vesicles as novel bioanalytical reagents\nthat allow the miniaturization of receptor-based assays under physiological\nconditions.65 Cultured mammalian cells\nare suitable for recombinant expression because they provide post-translational\nmodifications essential for receptor function. These vesicle cell-surface\nreceptors and cytoplasmic proteins retain their original cellular\nlocation, orientation, and function. They can be stored for weeks\nwithout losing their functional integrity. These vesicles could be\nused as a universal and inexpensive bioanalytical reagent for investigating\ncellular signaling reactions. Membrane fragment compositions comprised\nof polymeric core nanoparticles coated with bilayers of red blood\ncell (RBC) membranes have been used as \u201cnanosponges\u201d that\nabsorbs cellular damaging toxins.61 These\nRBC nanoparticles can absorb and neutralize a range of pore-forming\nprotein toxins potentially resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.\n\nTogether these mammalian membrane fragment technologies demonstrate\nhow mimicking native environments can be beneficial for drug delivery,\ncellular studies, and proteomic work. Mammalian membranes have many\nbenefits including low toxicity for drug delivery and correct orientation\nof the fragment to the nanoparticle - which is important to maintain\ntheir biological performance. Other molecules (e.g., recombinant antibodies)\nwhich are native to other parts of a cell (e.g., yeast cell wall)\ncan also benefit by encapsulation in a native or native-like environment\nduring protein studies.\n\nYeast display has also been used to screen\nantibody libraries against membrane proteins in their near-native\nconformations. Yeast biopanning, wherein monolayers of whole cells\nact as the antigen, has been suggested as a potential approach.77 Typically yeast display requires the use of\nsoluble antigen against which a library can be biopanned. As previously\ndiscussed, this poses a problem when attempting to select antibody\nfragments against membrane proteins. Combining yeast surface display\ndirectly with whole cells or detergent-solubilized whole-cell lysates\ncan potentially solve this problem by allowing antibody libraries\nto be screened against membrane proteins in the near-native conformations.78 One example is yeast biopanning; yeast-displayed\nscFvs were selected by successive rounds of incubation in mammalian\nmonolayers, with nonspecifically bound yeast removed by washing. This\nyeast biopanning method was later used to isolate a number of unique\nscFv that bind to plasma membrane proteins of a rat brain endothelial\ncell line.79\n\nAnother approach employed\nyeast surface display-based screening using cell lysates as a soluble\nantigen source.80 Detergent-solubilized\nmembrane proteins in the form of cell lysate were mixed with scFv-displaying\nyeast, and the resulting mixture was sorted using FACS. This process\nwas repeated leading to the enrichment of yeast clones that bound\na desired antigen. Antibody fragments were then eluted from the yeast\nsurface by yeast display immunoprecipitation (YDIP).78 These methods demonstrate the efficient discovery of novel\nantibody-target combinations toward membrane proteins stabilized by\nwhole-cells or solubilized whole-cell lysates.\n\nIn a recent study, aggregation-resistant scFvs\nwere produced by introducing negatively charged amino acids in the\nantigen binding sites.16 Mutation additions\nof aspartate- or glutamate-enhanced aggregation resistance by altering\nthe local charge distribution at highly specific positions, irrespective\nof sequence diversity at other positions. The mutant VH and VL domains were determined\nto be highly conserved, showing minimal impact on binding superantigen\ncompared to nonmutant (wildtype) scFv before heating to 80 \u00b0C,\nand considerably improved superantigen binding compared to wildtype\nscFv after heating had been performed. Wildtype scFvs readily aggregated\nat high temperatures; however, this was not observed for mutant scFvs.\nThis mutation allowed for improved expression and purification yields\nfor the production of therapeutic antibody fragments; however, additional\nwork is required to evaluate if these mutations improve the solubility\nof full-length antibodies. Similar work on full-length antibodies\nhas shown that mutations introduced at specific complementarity determining\nregions (CDRs) on full-length antibodies can also increase antibody\nsolubility and decrease aggregation.90\u221293 Interestingly, introducing glycans\ninto these antibodies (CDR and CH1 domains) was found to\nincrease solubility without reducing binding affinity.90,92 Furthermore, glycan type was found to affect solubility, with IgGs\nexpressed in yeast with mannose-rich glycans found to be more resistant\nto aggregation than the same IgGs expressed in mammalian cells.94 One key study demonstrated that avoiding aggregation\nhotspots within antibodies requires not only consideration of static\nantibody structures but considerations of dynamics as well.93 These investigators used molecular simulations\nof IgGs to identify aggregation-prone hydrophobic regions that were\neither natively exposed or exposed due to dynamic fluctuations or\nconformational changes. The simulations modeled the solvent exposure\nof every atom in an antibody and the relative aggregation propensity\nof each amino acid was calculated. These simulations identified aggregation\nhotspots in both the CDRs and constant domains. Further development\nof simulation models could improve identification of solubilizing\nmutations that do not impact binding affinity.\n\nAnother\nmethod to increase antibody solubility without mutating their CDRs\nis by increasing the net charge of an antibody.17,95,96 In one study, scFvs were \u201csupercharged\u201d\nby mutating solvent-exposed residues to charged residues of the same\npolarity.17 Using a computational program,\nresearchers selected charge mutations in the VH and VL domains of a scFv that\nwere predicted to avoid destabilizing the antibody fold. Interestingly,\nit was found that positively charged scFvs remained much more stable\nand retained high binding affinities when heated, compared to negatively\ncharged scFvs or wild-type scFvs This observation does not apply to\nsingle-domain antibodies (dAbs), as aggregation-resistant dAbs typically\nhave net negative charges due to their acidic isoelectric points.16,95\u221298 These studies underscore the need to better understand how charged\nresidues impact aggregation and solubility of antibodies and antibody\nfragments.\n\nStability\ncan be achieved by keeping antibody fragments anchored to the display\nhost (e.g., to the yeast cell wall).24,25 This strategy\nis an alternative to the standard approach of solubilizing scFvs prior\nto anchoring them onto a surface.99 Importantly,\nthis approach maintains scFvs in the environment in which they were\nselected to function. Thus, in the case of using a yeast display library,\nthe advantage of using FACS for selection is not undermined by reengineering\nthe scFv into a soluble form. Lyophilized whole-cell yeast\u2013scFv\nreagents, used in sandwich assay formats with traditional immunoglobulin\nsignal antibodies, have been described.24 More recently, whole yeast cells expressing scFv on their surface\nwere modified with gold binding peptide, to allow a simple and cost-effective\nmethod for conjugation of the whole yeast cell sensor to a gold substrate.30\n\nWhole-cell yeast\u2013scFv probes that\nwere lyophilized to create stable reagents that did not require refrigeration\nwere immediately usable following rehydration.24 With the development of improved lyophilization and storage\nprotocols, whole-cell yeast\u2013scFv were found to have a shelf\nlife in lyophilized form at 45 \u00b0C for up to a year.100 Furthermore, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy direct assays were developed that used whole-cell yeast\u2013scFv\nreagents in combination with these common laboratory devices. However,\nthese whole-cell reagents are insoluble and too large for many immunodiagnostic\napplications. Moreover, they require the use of labeled polyclonal\nor monoclonal antibodies to detect antigen binding to the yeast\u2013scFv\nparticles. Although it was not necessary that the detection antibodies\nbe highly specific to the antigen (the yeast-scFv reagent conferred monoclonal specificity), the requirement for a traditional\nanimal-derived detection antibody diluted the benefits of using yeast\u2013scFv.\n\nThe limitations of whole-cell yeast-scFv were addressed by mechanically fragmenting whole-cell yeast-scFv into nanosized yeast cell wall pieces to produce cell-free yeast-scFv affinity reagents.25,26,28 Cell wall fragments bearing displayed scFv\n(Figure 4) become enriched\nby binding to surface-attached antibodies specific to the scFv\u2019s\nepitope tags. These reagents, termed nanoyeast\u2013scFv, have been\ndeveloped as a new format for preparation of scFvs, have the potential\nas substitutes for full-length mAbs, and have demonstrated specific\nadvantages.25 As with whole-cell yeast\u2013scFv\nfragments, nanoyeast\u2013scFv retain the stability and functionality\nfor which they were selected. The yeast surface display is used to\nexpress scFv on the cell surface by use of the a-agglutinin\nsystem that was developed by Boder and Wittrup71,101 The Boder and Wittrup system uses Aga2 as the display fusion partner.\nAga2 has a disulfide link to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)/I\u03b2-1,6-glucan-anchored\nprotein, named Aga1, which is covalently attached to the yeast cell\nwall (Figure 4A). This\nsystem secures the fusion protein to the yeast cell wall. Engineered\ninto the scFv are N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) and C-terminal c-Myc\nepitope tags, which enable detection and affinity purification of\nthis fusion protein independently of its ligand-binding characteristics.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize\nthe structure of nanoyeast\u2013scFv (Figure 4B\u2013D). Nanoyeast\u2013scFv were specifically\ncaptured and immobilized by their HA tag using a HA antibody conjugated\nto a highly polished anatomically flat glass substrate. SEM shows clusters\nof nanoyeast\u2013scFv as globular particles coated on the substrate\nsurface (Figure 4B).\nFor an \u201cin-solution\u201d characterization, nanoyeast\u2013scFv\nwere captured onto magnetic particles via their HA tag and then gently\neluted off using excess HA peptide and analyzed using TEM (Figure 4B). Micrometer-sized\naggregation of nanoyeast\u2013scFv clusters was evident. Suggesting\nthat more work to prevent aggregation in solution needs to be considered.\nAFM of nanoyeast\u2013scFv immobilized onto an atomically flat polished\nglass substrate also showed globular particles that cover the sensor\nsurface.\n\nThese novel reagents can be readily\nselected from yeast scFv antibody\nlibraries (Figure 5). The cell wall fragment anchorages may constrain scFv secondary\nand tertiary structure, holding the scFv in configurations that are\nbest for antigen binding.28 Cell fragments\nwere determined to be globular from electron microscopy and atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM) measurements (Figure 4B\u2013D).28 Similarly to the yeast display and mammalian cell technology highlighted\nearlier, the orientation of the protein (scFv) can be manipulated\nto the improve display of functional properties. This can be achieved\nby linking the scFv by either the N- or C-terminus to the anchor protein.102\n\nNanoyeast\u2013scFvs are generated\nby mechanical fragmentation\nusing a mortar and pestle and then filtered by size to produce yeast\ncell wall fragments of varying sizes, with the scFv complex remaining\nintact. Cell fragment concentration can be determined using protein\nconcentration assays, which are based on measuring proteins present\nin the yeast cell fragments. Cell fragment size can be controlled\nusing size exclusion filters with a simple syringe pump. This method\neliminates larger fragments (>220 nm) which have been found to\ninterfere\nwith electrochemical-based biosensors.28 Larger size fragments may exert more force in solution, potentially\novercoming the anti-HA bond that captures nanoyeast\u2013scFv onto\nthe biosensor, resulting in these larger cell wall fragments becoming\ndislodged from the biosensor surface.28\n\nAn electrochemical approach has\nbeen utilized to detect antigen binding using nanoyeast\u2013scFv\n(Figure 6) with a sensitivity\nof approximately 10 pg mL\u20131 using a [Fe(CN)6]3\u2013/4\u2013 redox probe.26 Faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (F-EIS)\nallows the detection of capacitance changes for the label-free detection\nof biomolecules and probing the buildup of layers of the biomaterials\non an electrode. Successful detection and capture of a biomolecule\nof interest can be observed as a change in the capacitance and interfacial\nelectron-transfer resistance of an electrode. In a Randles equivalent\ncircuit, impedance measurements are presented in the form of a Nyquist\nplot, with the real, Z\u2032, and imaginary components, Z\u2033, and includes a semicircle region laying on the Z\u2032 axis followed by a straight line (Figure 6). At higher frequencies, the\nsemicircle portion of the Nyquist plot is observed, which corresponds\nto the electron-transfer-limited process. The semicircle diameter\nis directly related to the electron-transfer resistance at the electrode\nsurface, Ret.\n\nTherefore, construction\nof an immunosensing layer and antibody/antigen complex binding can\nbe observed by F-EIS, where the change in impedance of the electrode\nsurface and electrolyte solution, containing a redox probe (e.g.,\nFe(CN)6]3-/4-) is measured in the form of its Ret (Figure 6).\n\nThe utility of nanoyeast\u2013scFv\nas an antigen capture agent\nwas further demonstrated by specifically capturing pathogen antigens\nwhich were spiked into a biological matrix comprised of stool.26 In addition to the single pathogen antigen successfully\ncaptured in the previous work,25 a new\nsecond pathogen antigen type was tested, and its respective cognate\nnanoyeast\u2013scFv was developed.26 This\nis consistent with the prediction that nanoyeast\u2013scFv could\nbe routinely engineered to capture any target antigen of interest.\nIn addition, screen-printed gold electrodes were used as the diagnostic\nplatform, which replaced the gold macroelectrodes from the previous\nwork. This supports the expectation that nanoyeast\u2013scFv can\nbe utilized in a point-of-care diagnostic.26 The flexibility of nanoyeast\u2013scFv has been demonstrated by\nthe use of alternative readout platforms. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering\n(SERS) was employed in duplex antigen detection using nanoyeast\u2013scFv\nprobes (Figure 7).27\n\nA SERS nanoparticle label comprises a\nnoble metal nanoparticle\ncoated with Raman reporter molecules for identification based on their\ncharacteristic vibrational Raman spectrum. Compared with conventional\nimmunoassays based on electrochemistry, fluorescence, and ELISA, SERS\nhas a number of advantages. The first is multiplexing capability,\ndue to a single laser excitation resulting in a narrow-band Raman\nspectral signature and a wide excitation wavelength. Second, SERS\namplifies Raman signals up to 10\u201314 orders of magnitude, providing\nvery high sensitivity. SERS also provides unique spectral fingerprint\nsignatures of analytes, allowing for high specificity. scFv were immobilized\nonto a microfluidic chip into different channels depending on the\nscFv target type (Figure 7). Captured antigens were detected using a secondary detection\nantibody which was labeled with SERS particles. The SERS labels each\nprovide unique spectra which can be used to distinguish particles\nfrom one another using a Raman microspectrometer. Due to the sensitivity\nadvantages gained by SERS reporters, the limit for nanoyeast\u2013scFv\ndetection (LOD) was reduced to 1 pg mL\u20131.\n\nAn alternating current electrohydrodynamics (ac-EHD) platform\ndemonstrated\nrapid capture and sensitive detection of target antigen all together\nin less than 5 min.29 Under an ac-EHD field,\nthe charges induced within the electrical double layer of an electrode\nexperience an electrical body force that drives the bulk fluid onto\nthe inner circular electrode. This fluid flow transports target molecules\nor detection antibody in the bulk fluid and can continuously supply\ntarget molecules (i.e., increase sensor\u2013target affinity interactions)\nonto the capture domain. Further, the fluid flow can be tuned using\nthe applied ac field to achieve optimal fluid flow that can maximize\ndevice performance. This ability of ac-EHD flow can enable rapid capture\nand detection of target antigens. scFv were immobilized onto ac-EHD\ndevice via an affinity tag cloned into the scFv. An ac-EHD field was\napplied across the device, resulting in a flow field which caused\ntarget collisions between the immobilized scFv and the antigens in\nthe stool sample and the removal of nonspecifically captured proteins\nand molecules. A secondary quantum-dot-labeled detection antibody\nwas used to detect capture of target antigens. The device was imaged\nunder a confocal microscope to obtain fluorescence images of detected\nantigen (Figure 8).\nThis was the first demonstration of nanoyeast\u2013scFv being combined\nwith ac-EHD to facilitate rapid capture of antigen, removal of nonspecifically\nbound molecules, and detection of remaining bound antigen, all within\n5 min. Furthermore, the sensitivity (limit of detection) of nanoyeast\u2013scFv\nfor antigen capture was improved to 100 fg mL\u20131.\n\nStructural characterization of\nnanoyeast\u2013scFv has revealed\nthat the optimal yeast fragment size for protein capture is between\n50 and 100 nm in an electrochemical sensor; this limit is likely due\nto larger size yeast fragments exerting more force in solution and\ndetaching from the biosensor.28 It is possible\nthat larger fragments may also result in more nonspecific absorption\nto the yeast cell wall. Yeast fragment size can be simply controlled\nby the use of a syringe-driven size filter unit.\n\nWhile the cell\nwall fragment provides advantages in generating\nnanoyeast\u2013scFv quicker and cheaper and with added stability,\nnanoyeast\u2013scFv may be limited to in vitro diagnostic applications.\nThe effect of nanoyeast\u2013scFv in vivo has yet to be investigated;\nit is possible the yeast cell wall fragment could elicit an immune\nresponse when introduced into a host. For example, recombinant nonpathogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) based vaccines have been used for a number of tumors and pathogens\nto drive innate immunity of the vaccine antigen.103\u2212107 \u03b2-Glucans found in the yeast cell wall act as an inherent\nadjuvant that activates dendritic cells that in turn elicit a robust\nimmune response.107 As such, nanoyeast\u2013scFv\n(being comprised of yeast cell wall fragments) may also potentially\nbe used as an adjuvant for vaccines.\n\nAlthough these cell wall fragments\nare relatively easy to generate,\ntheir heterogeneity with respect to size and batch to batch variation\nof displayed scFv could pose a potential problem in producing these\nfragments reliably. The display of scFv on yeast surfaces is not homogeneous,\nresulting in sections of yeast cell wall that do not display any scFv\nfor selection. Current methods overcome these issues by the use of\nan affinity purification step that captures nanoyeast\u2013scFv\nfragments by virtue of the interaction between anti-HA antibody and\nthe HA affinity tag cloned into the yeast-displayed scFv. This ensures\nonly active nanoyeast\u2013scFv are conjugated onto the immunosensor,\nallowing for specific capture of target antigen. As such, current\nexperiments have indicated these fragments can be consistently fragmented\nleaving the associated scFv stable and active for protein capture.25\u221227 Other affinity reagents are typically purified antibody, which trade\nadded time and expense for a pure affinity reagent.\n\nWhole-cell biosensors have been developed which\ndisplay enzymes\nsuch as xylose dehydrogenase (XDH), glucose dehydrogenase, maltose,\nand organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) on the surface of E.\ncoli.108\u2212112 Anchoring enzymes to microbial cells such as E. coli eliminates the need for enzyme purification, while also providing\nstability to the display enzyme.108,110 Enzymes displayed\non E. coli surfaces can be achieved by the fusion\nto an anchoring motif\u2014ice nucleation protein (INP).108\u2212112 This fusion to the E. coli cell wall via INP was\nfound to increase XDH stability compared to cytoplasmic-free XHD,108 and improve stability of OPH compared to free\nprotein.110 Electrochemical measurements\nwere carried out in each E. coli biosensor platform,\nwith high sensitivity, good specificity, and good enzyme stability\nreported.108\u2212112\n\nA similar approach can be used in S. cerevisiae yeast cells, with a-agglutinin\nused as a cell wall anchor motif.113 A\nbenefit to using yeast cells compared to E. coli,\nis eukaryotic yeast cell can display properly folded proteins due\nto the presence of chaperons. Glucose oxidase (GOx) was recombinantly\nexpressed on the surface of whole yeast cells (GOx-yeast) and then\nconjugated to carbon nanotube modified glassy electrodes to create\na whole-cell biosensor for glucose.113 Cyclic\nvoltammograms (CVs) were used to determine the limit of detection\nobtainable by GOx\u2013yeast. The limit of detection was estimated\nfor glucose spiked into buffer was 50 nM, which was determined to\nhave high sensitivity compared to other GOx nanostructure modified\nelectrodes.113 Furthermore, GOx\u2013yeast\nalso demonstrated good stability, a wide pH range (pH 3.5\u201311.5),\nand good thermostability up to 56 \u00b0C over a short period.\nThese stability findings could be attributed to the yeast cell wall,\nwhich stabilized the GOx under varying conditions.\n\nFilamentous\nphage particles can be used directly as biosensor supports.\nAmino acids forming the N-terminal of a major coat protein, pVIII,\nof phage particles can be modified to display billions of random octapeptides,\ncreating a \u201clandscape library\u201d of phage particles.114 These octapeptides can bind proteins, enzymes,\nand cells.115\u2212117 As with traditional phage particles, these\nlandscape phage particles can be selected by successive rounds of\nbiopanning toward target antigens. These selected (purified) landscape\nphages could then be immobilized onto a substrate and used as protein\ncapture agents to detect target antigens in a sandwich ELISA system.115 By using whole landscape phage directly as\nprotein capture probes, this method retains the protein binding octapeptides\nin their native phage wall environment. This reduces time and complexity\nin construction of a biosensor. Interestingly, removing the entire\ncoating protein wall from the phage particle and immobilizing that\ncell wall composition on a substrate as a enzyme binder in a microarray\nare not as effective (sensitive) as keeping the whole landscape phage\nparticle intact.116 The drop in sensitivity\ncould be attributed to the isolated cell coating wall having a lower\nsurface area to bind enzymes as compared the intact spherical-shaped\nfilamentous landscape phage. The density of polypeptides per area\nin the microarray landscape phage surface was found to be greater\nthan traditional microarray immobilization peptide strategies.116 Whole-cell landscape phage has also been used\nto specifically capture SW620 colorectal carcinoma cells onto an label-free\nEIS biosensor.117 Each landscape phage\ncontains 4000 copies of octapeptides\u2014which translate to 4000\nrecognition sites. A multivalent effect can be achieved when targeting\nwhole cells, as these cells contain many binding sites across their\nsurface. This results in increased avidity, and affinity is possible\ndue to the interaction of thousands of recognition sites on landscape\nphage to many binding sites on carcinoma cells.117 These applications have shown phage particles can be mutated\nto bind biomolecules and cells of interest. However, given filamentous\nlandscape phage particles can be up to 800\u2013900 nm in length\nand only a few nanometers in diameter,118 the string-like dimensions of these particles could pose a problem\nfor some applications where micrometer-sized particles could interfere\nwith biosensor sensitivity or specificity. Furthermore, previous work\nhas shown decreased sensitivity in isolated cell coat protein octapeptides,116 which suggests these particles are the most\neffective when intact and not in nanometer-sized fragments. Nonetheless,\nthe applications demonstrated so far have shown that landscape phage\nhas good scope as both a screening platform and a biosensing interface.\nAs demonstrated in this review, cell envelope composition reagents can\nbe reliably generated for use in biosensors.\n\nThe global\nchallenge now and in the future will be the rapid development\nof diagnostic tests for the detection of infectious disease. Better\nin-field diagnostics are required to monitor disease emergence and\nto track the progress of disease throughout populations. Furthermore,\nmore than 50% of emerging diseases in humans over the past several\ndecades are a result of transmittal between animals and humans;119 Zoonotic disease emergence include\nmore recent global health concerns regarding the spread of Ebola,\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although there are concerted efforts\nby organizations such as The World Health Organization (WHO) to deploy\ndiagnostics to monitor emerging infectious diseases in humans, and\nother organizations to monitor disease emergence in animals, there\nis little done to connect the two monitoring systems together to use\nanimal sickness to predict human dieases.120 As such, in addition to monitoring human population health,\nearly and rapid field tests are required to enable health care task\nforce officials and scientists to monitor potential animal-to-human\npathogens.\n\nCurrent approaches to vaccine, drug, and diagnostic\ndevelopment\ntoward infectious diseases have been shown to be inadequate.121\u2212123 As of yet, no vaccine has ever been developed in time to change\nthe course of an outbreak.123 Government\nagencies are calling for flexible development and production platform\ntechnologies to improve R&D readiness for priority infectious\ndisease threats.121 As such, there is an\nabsolute necessity for novel platform technologies whereby new antibodies\ncan be rapidly isolated and incorporated into novel assay formats\nthat are temperature, solution, and (biosensor) surface stable. Such\nreagents need to be seamlessly incorporated into cost-effective diagnostic\ndevices that can be distributed and easily utilized in urban and rural\nenvironments.\n\nIn this review we have described state-of-the-art\ntechnologies\nwhich achieve these goals by creating nanostructures that comprise\nof antibody components and cell wall fragments. The nanoscaled cell wall\nfragment of these antibody composite structures renders exceptional\ntemperature storage, and biosensor application stability. We now propose\nan integrated platform technology (Figure 9) that incorporates rapid isolation of antibodies\nusing yeast display, followed by production and integration of nanoyeast\u2013scFv\ninto a device for rapid deployment. The ability to rapidly isolate\nantibodies using antibody display libraries technologies (bacteriophage,\nbacteria, yeast, and mammalian cell display) is well-established.\nHowever, the success of the technique is highly dependent on the quality\nof the antigen presented to the library, and isolation of antibodies\nagainst native membrane proteins can be challenging. We recently developed\nan antibody library biopanning technique that utilizes whole cells,\nwhich ensures recombinant membrane-bound proteins maintain their native\nconformation.8 There are relatively few\nexamples of successful cell-based biopanning methods in the literature,\nand most such methods fail to overcome the limitations of biopanning\non the cell surface, namely, the low target density and the high background\nof irrelevant antigens.\n\nThis new methodology uses transient transfection of alternating\nhost cell lines (CHO and HEK), as shown in Figure 9A, and stringent wash steps to allow for\nthe selection of antibodies against membrane proteins in their native\nconformation. Once selections have been performed, scFvs can then\nbe stabilized utilizing the previously described nanoyeast\u2013scFv\nformat. This new approach addresses the above limitations in the optimization\nof many cell-based panning methods. It allows for the rapid selection\nof temperature-stable cell diagnostic reagents against infectious\ndisease targets in a simplified pipeline as compared to traditional\nmAb production.\n\nCell envelope compositions paired with rapid\nbiopanning methods\ncan address production time concerns by streamlining some of the required\nsteps. The nanoyeast\u2013scFv technology allows for the rapid development\nof mAbs toward infectious agents in a matter of 2\u20133 weeks from\nyeast library selection to incorporation into an assay (Figure 5B). The whole-cell biopanning\nusing yeast\u2013scFv libraries followed by a simple method for\nscFv stabilization through the production of nanoyeast\u2013-scFv\nis a powerful platform technology for rapid isolation and production\nof affinity reagents, and is a step forward in addressing the limitations\nof drug and diagnostic reagent development.\n\nDeveloping a platform\nthat rapidly selects antibodies against pathogen\nantigens presented on whole cells, and then stabilizing these temperature-stable\nreagents into cell envelopes for use in point-of-care diagnostics\nfor monitoring of disease progression in animals and humans, can help\npotentially control disease emergence.\n\nCell envelope compositions have conferred stability on protein\nand antibody fragments by maintaining native or native-like environments\nduring protein or immunoassay studies. Nanodiscs and other biological\nnanoparticles have demonstrated great utility in providing stability\nto membrane proteins by encapsulating these proteins in stabilizing\nphospholipids, allowing these membrane proteins to remain in solution\nand hence in a native-like environment. Cell-wall-based compositions\nhave been developed in response to scFv solubilization challenges.\nRetaining a native yeast cell wall environment (i.e., a semirigid\npolysaccharide, lipid, and protein matrix) for yeast displayed scFvs\nhas further stabilized these antibody fragments for use in diagnostic\napplications. Screening of yeast display libraries facilitates rapid\nisolation of high-affinity scFvs binders and then, crucially, correctly\ndisplay the scFvs on the yeast membrane surface. In this way scFvs\ncan be kept attached to the yeast cell wall, allowing these diagnostic\nagents to remain in the environment from which they were selected,\nthus providing much needed stability to these affinity binders. Nanoyeast\u2013scFv\ncan be lyophilized for long-term storage for up to a year. An assay\ncan then be directly conducted on these lyophilized agents to reduce\nantibody production time. However, more advances will need to be made\nto this new production process to ensure that the reagents have the\nflexibility and sensitivity to stand alongside mAbs as alternative\ndiagnostic protein capture agents. Currently, lyophilized, whole yeast\u2013scFvs\nare insoluble and are too large for many diagnostic applications.\nTheir readout method is also limited by the use of labeled secondary\nantibodies. To address these limitations, nanoyeast\u2013scFvs were\ninvented.25\u221227 Nanoyeast\u2013scFvs are designed as a new diagnostic\nprotein capture agent used in immunosensors of disease biomarkers. These novel reagents build upon the work advanced\nby whole yeast\u2013scFvs24 but can overcome many of the limitations posed by that technology. Small,\nsoluble agents are produced which can be used in a variety of molecular\nbiosensing platforms, all while retaining the stability and quick\ntime to manufacture and low-cost advantages presented by whole yeast\u2013scFv.\nTogether, these advances in cell envelope compositions have demonstrated\nthat cell-surface proteins are best studied or utilized in their native\nenvironments. Furthermore, cell biopanning methods can be used to\nselect antibodies toward membrane proteins in their native cell environment,\nallowing for the production of high-affinity binders. Cell envelope\ncompositions could be developed toward other biomolecules that require\nnative cell environments for stability."}
