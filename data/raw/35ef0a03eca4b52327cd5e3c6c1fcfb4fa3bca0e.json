{"title": "SCIENCE IN CHINA PRESS Springer Effects of space flight on DNA mutation and secondary metabolites of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.)", "body": "Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) is a medicinal herb which has been internationally used as a remedy since the beginning of recorded history [1] . The two principal active secondary metabolites in licorice roots are glycyrrhizic acid (GA, including glycyrrhetinic acid, hydrolyzed products of GA, GCA) and liquiritin (LQ) (structure shown in Figure 1 ). GA has anti-inflammatory activity and is well known for its clinical applications in the treatment of the spleen, sore throats, bronchitis and liver disease [2] . GA has been reported to inhibit the replication of the SARS-associated coronavirus [3] . LQ possess various biological activities including anti-allergic and anti-tussive activities [4] . Over-collection of wild licorice plants in China resulted in a decline in wild resources and induced desertification of the habitat. Thus, cultivation of licorice was a substitute for the wild resources [5] . The low germination rate and content of active components in cultivated licorice limit its large-scale cultivation [6, 7] .\n\nSpaceflight mutation unites space technology, bio-technology and agricultural breeding technology. High radiation, microgravity and other space factors may cause hereditary changes in plants and thereby create new breeds [8] .\n\nIn the present work, wild licorice seeds were carried by a recoverable satellite for 18 days' space flight. The ISSR technique was used to study the genetic variation of licorice after space flight. The contents of GA (including GCA) and LQ in their one-year roots were analyzed by HPLC and compared with a control.\n\nWild licorice seeds (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) were obtained from the Tacheng district of Xinjiang Autono- mous Region, China and carried by the 18th recoverable satellite for 18 d (the average radiation dose in the flight recovery module was 0.102 mGy/d, the distance from flight apogee to earth was 350 km, gravity 10 \u22126 ), The control ground-based licorice seeds were stored at 25\u2103 under dry conditions. After the space flight, both the seeds sent into outer space and the ground-based control group were sown in the ground. Fresh leaves were collected for ISSR analysis. Their one-year-old roots were used for HPLC analysis.\n\nAll primers used for ISSR analysis were purchased from Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Service Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Taq DNA, 10\u00d7PCR buffer and dNTPs for ISSR were all purchased from TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian, China) Co., Ltd. GA and LQ standard references for HPLC were purchased from NICPBP (National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, China).\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from fresh licorice leaves. The extraction procedure was according to Paterson et al. (1993) [9] .\n\nThe PCR reaction was carried out in a 25 \u03bcL volume of a mixture containing 10 \u03bcL template DNA (10.5 ng), 2.5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer (including Mg 2+ ), 2 \u03bcL of dNTPs (10 mmol/L), 1 \u03bcL of primer (10 \u03bcmol/L), 0.25 \u03bcL of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/\u03bcL) and 9.25 \u03bcL ddH 2 O.\n\nThe reaction was performed in a thermocycler (Model TC-412, U.K.). The amplification program included a preliminary denaturing step at 94 for \u2103 5 min, followed by 40 cycles, each of which had a denaturing step at 94\u2103 for 45 s, an annealing at 53\u2103 for 60 s, and an extension step at 72\u2103 for 90 s. After the last cycle the samples were stored for 7 min at 72\u2103.\n\nThe PCR amplification products were tested by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide in 0.5\u00d7Tris-borate buffer. The ISSR fragments were visualized and analyzed by an imaging system (UVP Inc. USA).\n\n(1) Liquid chromatographic conditions. The analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatograph system (equipped with vacuum degasser, quaternary gradient pump, UV detection, controlled by HP Chemstation software. Palo Alto, CA, USA). A SUPELCOILTM LC l8 column (4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) was used. For GA, the analysis was employed by gradient elution beginning with a mobile phase composition of 65\ufe3035 (methanol\ufe301% aqueous acetic acid, V/V) and gradually changed to 90\ufe3010 after 30 min and then maintained for 5 min. For LQ, the mobile phase was employed by acetonitrile and 0.5% aqueous acetic acid (1\ufe304). The detection wavelength was respectively set at 254 nm and 276 nm for GA and LQ. The flow rate was maintained at 1 mL/min.\n\n(2) Preparation of sample solutions. Licorice roots were powdered by an electrical blender. The powder sample (1.00 g) was extracted in an ultrasonic bath with 60 mL of methanol for 30 min. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was transferred into a 5 mL volumetric flask with fresh methanol and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm membrane before injecting 10 \u03bcL samples.\n\nIn this study, 22 ISSR primers were used to amplify the genomic DNA of the control licorice plants and plants from exterrestrically orbited seeds in order to screen polymorphic primers. 16 primers generated the same DNA band type, and 6 generated different DNA band types between the control and exterrestrically orbited licorice plants. Table 1 shows the polymorphic ISSR primers sequence. Each primer amplified different numbers of DNA bands from 5 to 11. 22 ISSR primers amplified 132 bands, 28 bands were found to be polymorphic with 21.2% polymorphism. The results of amplification by selected primers is shown in Figure 2 .\n\nCompared with the control, plants from seeds carried in the space station generated different band types. It indicates that primer T13761 amplified eight bands (Figure 2 ), among which 4 bands were polymorphic. Compared with type of plants from seeds orbited in outer space, the control group lacked two bands of 600 bp and 650 bp. The control group had a band of 350 bp which was absent in the type of plants from the space orbited seeds. Primer T13765 generated ten bands, among which three bands were polymorphic. Compared with the control group, plants from seeds orbited in space had two additional 350 bp bands and lacked a 150 bp band.\n\nTo study the influence of space flight on secondary metabolites of licorice, HPLC methods were applied to the determination of the content of main secondary metabolites in one-year-old licorice roots. Representative chromatograms are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . The contents of GA and LQ in the roots were summarized in Table 2 . The results showed that the contents of GA and LQ in roots from plant seeds orbited in an exterrestrically environment were approximately 2.19 and 1.18 times higher than that of the ground control group with significant differences. \n\nLicorice, which belongs to the leguminosae family, is used in almost all herbal preparations in China. Wild licorice mainly grows in arid and semi-arid regions where it contributes to long-term soil maintenance [10] . Over-collection of wild licorice plants is one of the factors inducing desertification in western China. In 2000, the Chinese government imposed restrictions on the collection of wild licorice so as to conserve the natural environment. With the increasing demand for licorice and the decline of wild licorice resources, cultivated licorice roots have attracted attention as an additional source. However, there remain various issues concerning licorice cultivation, such as the low content of secondary metabolites in cultivated licorice roots and the low germination rate of licorice seeds. Space science provides novel, unique research opportunities. Weightlessness, high radiation, high charge and high energy (HZE) particles may cause DNA mutation and hereditary changes in plants [11] .\n\nMany space flight experiments have been conducted on tomatoes, potatoes and fungi with results showing morphological variation and DNA mutation [12, 13] . Gao investigated the influence of space flight on the medicinal plants Platycodon grandiflorus, and Agastache rugosa utilizing an electron microscope. The experiments indicated that the plants' ultrastructure changed after the space flight [14, 15] .\n\nOur former study of the physiological and biological variation of exterrestrically orbitedlicorice seeds showed that they have a higher germination rate and POD, CAT enzyme activities under drought stress, which indicated that they have higher drought resistance than the ground control group. In this study, DNA mutation of outer space orbited licorice was verified by ISSR analysis, to assess genetic variation. Secondary metabolite products are the main active components in natural drugs or medicinal plants, but there have been relatively few reports about the effects of space flight on secondary metabolites [16] . In this experiment, HPLC analysis demonstrated that the contents of GA and LQ in the experimental licorice roots were higher than that in the ground control group. It is thus apparent that the biosynthesis of GA and LQ changed after space flight. This means that space flight may affect functional gene expression of secondary metabolism in licorice.\n\nFor a better understanding of the mechanism of mutation induced by space flight, further experiments will be necessary to study the mutational events for several generations after orbital space flight, as well as cloning and sequencing the correlated genome.\n\nIn our study, licorice seeds were carried by a recoverable satellite and subsequently planted. This research represents the first study of the genetic variation of licorice after orbital space flight utilizing the ISSR technique. The results demonstrate that plants from exterrestrically orbited seeds generated different band types. Because we used the same type of licorice seeds in the space group and in the control one the effects of flights were the main factors on the licorice genetic mutation. Jiang et al. [17] have studied the effects of space flight on rice seeds, which demonstrated the effects of orbital space flight in causing the first generation mutation. The second generation generates the most broad spectrum separation in characteristics, and in the third generation these variations were transmitted to future generations achieving basic stability. This is also the first report of the influence of secondary metabolites after space flight. HPLC data showed that the contents of GA and LQ in roots from outer space orbited seeds are significantly higher than that of control group. This research partially accounts for the molecular mechanism of space mutation in medicinal plants.\n\nTherefore, it may be concluded that space mutagenesis breeding is an efficient approach to medicinal plant breeding.\n\nThere have been studies showing that orbital space flight genetic mutations are inheritable yielding measurable economic benefits [18] , e.g. improved wheat, barley, rice and tomatoes. Space mutation breeding produces enriched germplasm resources which accelerate breeding time [19] . Security is not an issue because it does not introduce new genes."}
