{"title": "Structure of M pro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors", "body": "kinetic analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1e ). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for COVID-19 72 virus M pro was measured to be 28,500 M \u22121 s \u22121 which is slightly higher than that for SARS- 73 CoV M pro (kcat/Km=26,500 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 10 , but over 30-fold higher than that of human rhinovirus 74 3C protease (kcat/Km=920 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) 11 .\n\nIn a previous study, we designed a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 using computer-aided 77 drug design (CADD) (Extended Data Fig. 1c) , which can specifically inhibit multiple CoV utilized to evaluate the inhibition as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate be 11,300\u00b1880 M -1 s -1 , suggesting this Michael acceptor has potent inhibition. 95 The crystal structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with N3 96 In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of this compound, we determined the crystal 97 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with N3 to 2.1-\u00c5 resolution. The asymmetric 98 unit contains only one polypeptide (Extended Data Table 1 ). However, two of these 99 associate to form a dimer by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (the two molecules 100 are designated protomer A and B) (Fig. 1b) . All residues (residues 1-306) are visible in 101 electron density maps. Each protomer is composed of three domains (Fig. 1a) . Domains \u2160 102 (residues 8-101) and \u2161 (residues 102-184) have an antiparallel \u03b2-barrel structure. Domain 103 \u2162\n\n(residues 201-303) contains five \u03b1-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular 104 cluster, and is connected to domain \u2161 by means of a long loop region (residues 185-200). strand155-168 on one side, and with residues 189-191 of the loop linking domains \u2161 and \u2162\n\n. 111 Here we detail the specific interactions of N3 with M pro (Fig. 1c, d) . The electron density 112 shows that the S\u03b3 atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-\u00c5) with the C\u03b2 of the vinyl 113 group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute 114 requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A, E166-A, H163-115 A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-A are involved 116 in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules (named W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163-118 A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic S2 subsite, which 119 consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl portion of the 120 side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, indicating that this the S1\u2032 site, forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A and T25-A. In addition, N3 126 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding 127 pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the substrate-binding pocket. conformation. This may be attributed to an ordered water (W1) in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 133 structure, which makes a long-distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the 134 ester and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143 and the side 135 chain of N142. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV M pro s share a highly 136 conserved substrate-recognition pocket, which could serve as a drug target for the design 137 of broad-spectrum inhibitors 12 . The recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of 138 structural data for CoV M pro s from various species provided the opportunity to further 139 examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of M pro s 12-21 have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain \u2162 and surface loops, but the 141 substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains \u2160 and \u2161 are still highly 142 conserved among all CoV M pro s, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting this site should 143 have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 2b, c) . \u03bcM.

Cell-based 211 phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable 30 , but the complexity of this approach is 212 not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and it cannot identify the molecular 213 target or mechanism of action 31 . In this study, the convergence of structure-based ab initio 214 drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening proved to be an efficient 215 strategy to find antiviral leads against COVID-19 virus. The methods presented here can 216 greatly assist in the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new 217 emerging infectious diseases that currently lack specific drugs and vaccines.
