{"title": "Prevalence and clinical characteristics of human CoV-HKU1 in children with acute respiratory tract infections in China", "body": "Human coronavirus (HCoV) are enveloped viruses with a singlestranded RNA genome. The HCoV 229E and OC43 subtypes were initially identified as causes of common colds in the 1960s, and occasionally pneumonia in young children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised adults. [1] [2] [3] [4] Recently three novel human coronavirus were identified, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus Netherlands (HCoV-NL63), and human coronavirus Hong Kong (HCoV-HKU1). [5] [6] [7] [8] HCoV-HKU1 was first isolated in 2005 from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia. 6 Several successive reports confirmed retrospectively that HCoV-HKU1 was circulating worldwide. [9] [10] [11] [12] However, the impact and the role of the emerging HCoV-HKU1 were not defined in children with ARTI. In China, there is limited epidemiological data about HCoV-HKU1 infection, especially concerning the prevalence and clinical characterization of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI. In the present study, 645 NPA specimens were collected. The presence of HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses was screened, and the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 were analyzed.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in Chinese children with ARTI.\n\nNPA samples were collected from 645 children with ARTI at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Gansu Province, China, between November 2006 and October 2008. All patients were 15 years of age or younger, informed consent was obtained from their parents. All NPA samples were collected 1-3 days after the onset of ARTI. Demographic data and clinical findings of these patients were collected on a standard collection form. The study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee.\n\nNPA samples were collected from patients by instilling 2 ml of virus preservation solution (200 U/ml penicillin, 200 U/ml streptomycin, 200 U/ml amphotericin B, and 0.25% BSA) through a nasopharyngeal mucous extractor. The NPAs were frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until further processing. Viral DNA and RNA were extracted from 140 l of each NPA specimen using the QIAamp viral DNA and the QIAamp viral RNA mini kits (Qiagen, Shanghai, China). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II RH \u2212 reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using random hexamer primers.\n\nHCoV-HKU1 forward (5 -GGT TGG GAC GAT ATG TTA CGT CA-3 ) and reverse (5 -CCATCA TCA CTC AAA ATC ATC ATA-3 ) primers, which target the polymerase gene (pol) to amplify a 490 bp product, were used for HCoV-HKU1 screening as described previously. 13 PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 \u2022 C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, 55 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. A standard reverse transcription-PCR technique was used to screen for Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Human rhinovirus (HRV), Influenza viruses (IFV), Parainfluenza viruses (PIV), Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and PCR for Adenovirus (ADV). 14-16\n\nAll positive PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by SinoGeno-Max Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). Sequences were determined and analyzed using the DNAman software package. The pol gene partial sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers (FJ937641-FJ937659). A neighbor-joining tree, which included the HCoV-HKU1 (NC-006577, DQ415914, DQ415911, DQ415912), HCoV-OC43 (NC-005147), HCoV-229E (NC-002645), HCoV-NL63 (AY567487), TGEV (NC-002306), FIPV (NC-007025), MHV (AF201929), BCoV (NC-003045), and SARS-CoV (AY274119) sequences, was constructed using the MEGA ver.3.1 program (www.megasoftware.net), and PEDV (NC-003436) was used as the outgroup.\n\nThe univariate associations were evaluated using Pearson's 2 for binary variables (with Fisher's exact method, when appropriate), the Mann-Whitney U-rank sum test for comparing continuous variables between subgroups, and the Kruskal-Wallace test for comparing continuous variables between subgroups.\n\nApproximately 53% (343/645) of the patients were male. The age of the children ranged from 1 day to 173 months, with a median age of 16 months. The majority of patients (569, 88.2%) were 5-years or younger. 75 (11.63%) patients had some underlying diseases. The ratio of outpatients to inpatients was 1:2.7 (173:472). 114 of 405 (28.15%) NPAs tested positive for two or more viral agents, and 74 were infected with two potential pathogens, 36 with three, and 4 with four potential pathogens. Nine HCoV-HKU1 coinfections (47.37%) were detected, six with RSV, one with HRV, one with RSV and IFVA, and one with HRV and ADV. RSV was the most common co-infection virus with HCoV-HKU1.\n\nHCoV-HKU1 was only detected from November to April during 2006 to 2008. Positive specimens peaked in November and January, with four and six positive specimens, respectively (Fig. 1) . Children with HCoV-HKU1 varied in age from 1 day to 12-years (median age, 24 months) and 78.9% (15/19) of the patients were \u22645-years-of-age, but no statistically significant ( 2 = 0.830, P = 0.362) was revealed in the incidence rate between these two age groups (>5-years-ofage and \u22645). The incidence rate of boys is 2.91% (10/343) and the incidence rate of girls is 2.98 (9/302), No statistically significant ( 2 = 0.002, P = 0.961) was revealed between them.19 positive cases include 4 outpatients (2.3%) and 15 inpatients (3.2%). The difference in rates between them was not statistically significant ( 2 = 0.332, P = 0.565). \n\nThe main clinical diagnoses of HCoV-HKU1 positive patients included AURI (5, 26.3%), bronchitis (1, 5.2%), bronchopneumonia (5, 26.3%), acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia (6, 31.6%), and pneumonia (2, 10.5%). The clinical presentations of HCoV-HKU1 positive children included cough (74.7%), fever (68.4%), sputum production (73.7%), crackles (78.9%), wheezing (31.6%), vomiting (5.3%), and diarrhea (10.5%). The hospital stay for the 15 inpatients ranged from 4 to 18 days (mean, 10.1 \u00b1 4.02 days). None of these patients died or required intensive care.\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences in the clinical symptoms between HCoV-HKU1 positive and all common respiratory viruses negative groups (subgroup 1), between HCoV-HKU1 mono-infection and co-infection groups (subgroup 3), and between HCoV-HKU1 mono-infection and co-infection with RSV groups (subgroup 4) ( Table 1) .\n\nSix of 19 (31.58%) HCoV-HKU1 positive patients had an underlying illness, and they were all inpatients (hospital stay, 4-13 days; mean, 11.2 days). Nine inpatients (hospital stay, 5-13 days; mean, 9.2 days) and four outpatients had no underlying illness. There was a statistically significant difference in the detection rate between the two groups with and without underlying illnesses (subgroup 2; P = 0.042). However, no statistically significant difference was found for the hospital stay duration or other clinical symptoms (Table 1) . Among the six HCoV-HKU1 positive children with underlying illnesses, three had one underlying disease, which included pyelonephritis, persisting enteritis, or endocardial fibroelastosis. The others had two underlying diseases, including acute benign lymphoblastosis, sensitization dermatitis, interventricular septal defect, nephrotic syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus and allergic renopathy.\n\nThe HCoV-HKU1 pol gene sequences shared 95.8-99.6% nucleotide identity and 90.7-99.3% amino acid identity with HCoV-HKU1 strain N15 (No. DQ415911). Moreover, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities were 98.4 and 96.3%, respectively, among the 19 HCoV-HKU1 positive strains. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that they all clustered with the HCoV-HKU1 strain N15 (Fig. 2) .\n\nIn the present study, a 2.95% incidence rate for HCoV-HKU1 infection was found over 2 years from 645 children with ARTIs. A similar incidence rate has been reported in Hong Kong, 17 Italy, 18 and Australia, 9 but it was different from other studies. [10] [11] [12] Furthermore, the incidence rate was statistically significant between 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 (1.16% vs 4.98%), indicating probable different prevalence strength for HCoV-HKU1 during each year. The periodicity of coronavirus infection is also described in other reports. 4, 8 The majority of HCoV-HKU1 positive patients (78.9%, 15/19) were \u22645-years-of-age, which indicated that young children are at high risk of HCoV-HKU1 infection. HCoV-HKU1 was only detected from November to April in this study, with a peak in January and February, which agrees with USA, Hong Kong, and Italian reports. 12, 17, 18 However, HCoV-HKU1 was detected during all four seasons in other reports. 9, 11, 12, 18, 19 This indicates the epidemiological patterns of HCoV-HKU1 may be different in different regions.\n\nApproximately 47% of HCoV-HKU1 positive patients were coinfected with other respiratory viruses in this study, which is higher than that in previous studies. 9, 18 RSV was the most common additional virus (77.78%, 7/9). Co-infections leading to more Table 1 Clinical characteristics of the infants infected with respiratory viruses detected in this study. Characters severe diseases have been described for RSV and coronaviruses. 20 However, in this study no significant difference was revealed in the clinical symptoms, outpatient/inpatient department, and hospital stay duration between the mono-infection group and the co-infection group or the co-infection with RSV group in HCoV-HKU1 infected patients (Table 1) . It was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was less often associated with lower respiratory tract diseases than other HCoV types. 11, 18 However, Esper et al. reported that HCoV-HKU1 might contribute to upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. 12 In the present study, no significant difference in the incidence rate was observed between the upper and lower respiratory tract diseases (P = 0.928). Crackles, cough, sputum production, and fever were the most common symptoms of these patients. These symptoms resemble those reported for children in Italy 18 and the USA. 12 Additionally, Lau's study reported that HCoV-HKU1 may play a role in epileptic seizures. 19 However, in this study, no epileptic seizures occurred. The exact clinical association and potential neurotropism of HCoV-HKU1 infection remains to be addressed.\n\nHCoV-HKU1 was first detected in patients with underlying illnesses. 6 A part of positive patients was reported with underlying diseases in the subsequent studies. 11, 12, 19 In our study, 6 of 19 positive patients had at least one underlying disease (Table 1) . Interestingly, a significant difference in the incidence rate (P = 0.042) was observed between HCoV-HKU1patients with and without underlying disease. But no significant difference was observed between the two groups for the number of hospital stay days or clinical symptoms. Additionally, the incidence rate for HCoV-HKU1 infection between outpatients and inpatients was not significantly different (Table 1 ). These results indicated that patients with underlying diseases may be more prone to HCoV-HKU1 infection, but that HCoV-HKU1 infection did not aggravate the clinical symptoms and did not contribute to the hospitalization rate or hospital stay duration. There were three patients with cardiovascular diseases and three with kidney diseases, which ranked first in terms of underlying diseases. Further study is needed to investigate whether cardiovascular and kidney diseases are major risk factors for HCoV-HKU1 infection.\n\nThree HCoV-HKU1 genotypes (A, B and C) have been reported 21 and no correlation was observed between the HCoV-HKU1 genotype and clinical syndromes or symptoms. 18 The partial pol gene in our study displayed minor sequence differences with human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 strain N15, which belongs to genotype B. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the 19 HCoV-HKU1 strains were all classified into the HCoV-HKU1 genotype B lineage. This result indicated that a single cluster of HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally. One previous study from Australian also reported genotype B was dominant locally. 9 But In Italian and Hong Kong genotype A, B, and C were all circulating. 18, 21 In conclusion, we showed the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in a pediatric population with ARTI in China. HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 19 of 645 (2.95%) children. 47.37% of them were coinfected with other respiratory viruses with RSV the most common coinfection virus. The most common symptom and clinical diagnoses with HCoV-HKU1 infection were crackles and acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia. A single HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally in the years 2007 and 2008. Our study indicated that patients with underlying disease may be more prone to HCoV-HKU1 infection with no impact on clinical symptoms, hospitalization rate or hospital stay duration."}
