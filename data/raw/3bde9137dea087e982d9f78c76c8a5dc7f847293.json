{"title": "", "body": "Uveitis is any condition that involves inflammation of the uveal tract. It is one of the most important ocular diseases in cats.\n\n2. Describe the structure of the uvea.\n\nThe uvea constitutes the vascular portion of the eye and consists of three main components:\n\n1. The iris forms the most anterior portion and is the boundary between anterior and posterior chambers. Inflammation of the iris is termed iritis.\n\n2. The ciliary body is the middle portion of the uvea that is responsible for formation of aqueous humor and accommodation. Inflammation of the ciliary body is termed cyclitis. Together the iris and ciliary body are considered the anterior uvea.\n\n3. The choroid, located between the sclera and retina, supplies oxygen and nutrients to the outer layer of the retina and the optic nerve. It is considered the posterior uvea. Inflammation of the choroid is termed choroiditis. Inflammation of the choroid typically also affects the retina, in which case it is termed chorioretinitis.\n\nInflammation of the entire uveal tract is termed endophthalmitis. When endophthalmitis is coupled with scleral and corneal inflammatory changes, it is termed panophthalmitis.\n\n\u2022 Location (anterior, posterior) \u2022 Duration (acute, chronic, recurrent) \u2022 Pathology (e.g., granulomatous, suppurative) \u2022 Cause (trauma, infection, neoplasia, immune-mediated) 5 . What determines the clinical manifestations of uveitis?\n\nThe clinical appearance of uveitis depends on location, duration, and severity. Clinical signs of uveitis in cats are generally subtle and divided into those that affect either the anterior (iris and ciliary body) or posterior (choroid) segment. 6 . Describe the clinical signs of anterior uveitis.\n\n1. Photophobia, blepharospasm, enophthalmos, elevation of the third eyelid, and epiphora manifest as ocular pain. Pain is common with acute uveitis but may be absent with mild or chronic cases.\n\n2. Injection of conjunctival and episcleral vessels results in a \"red eye.\" 3. Low intraocular pressure (lOP) occurs when aqueous humor formation is impaired by inflammation of the ciliary body. A difference> 5 mmHg between eyes is considered significant. If uveitis is complicated by secondary glaucoma, lOP can be elevated or in the normal range if the decrease in lOP caused by uveitis is counterbalanced by the impairment of aqueous humor outflow associated with secondary glaucoma.\n\n3. Aqueous flare is cloudy aqueous humor that results from influx of cells and protein when the blood-ocular barrier is disrupted as a result of uveal inflammation.\n\n4. Corneal edema can result from effects of inflammation on the corneal endothelium and ranges from perilimbal to generalized.\n\n5. Keratic precipitates are inflammatory cells in the aqueous humor that are deposited on the corneal endothelium. Normal convection currents of the aqueous humor cause the precipitates to be located primarily on the ventral half of the cornea.\n\nUveitis 6. Miosis results from direct effects on the iris sphincter of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. Its absence does not rule out uveitis because mild miosis is difficult to detect. 7. Iritis is manifested by vasodilatation and increased vessel permeability that can produce a subtle-to-pronounced change in iris color. The iris may appear swollen and have a thin coat of fibrin and cells, giving it a velvety appearance. Rubeosis iridis is the proliferation of small vessels on the iris surface.\n\n8. Hyphema. 9. Hypopyon. 7 . What clinical signs indicate chronic or previous inflammation in the anterior segment? I. Posterior synechia are adhesions to the anterior lens capsule that may cause the pupil to be irregularly shaped and impair its ability to respond to light or dilating agents. 2. Iris bombe forms when posterior synechia involve the entire pupil margin and prevent aqueous humor from moving from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber and exiting through the filtration angle. The accumulation of aqueous humor behind the iris causes it to billow forward and is associated with increasing lOP and glaucoma.\n\n3. Peripheral anterior synechia are adhesions of the peripheral iris to the corneal endothelium secondary to iris swelling or iris bombe, 9. What are the differential diagnoses of uveitis in cats?\n\nCauses of uveitis in cats can be endogenous or exogenous and are listed in the tables below. In contrast to dogs, systemic infectious disease is more commonly found to be the cause of uveitis in cats. Appropriate treatment of uveitis, therefore, requires proper diagnosis, because the uveitis may be the first indication of a serious or life-threatening illness. Clinical or serologic evidence of systemic disease is detected in 25-90% of cats with uveitis. A good history, physical examination, and a minimal database of complete blood chemistry, serum biochemical profile, and urinalysis are essential. Thoracic and abdominal radiographs as well as abdominal ultrasonography may be indicated if a neoplastic or infectious process is suspected. Outdoor cats should be routinely tested for Toxoplasma gondii, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Cats raised in a cattery or < 2 years of age should be routinely screened for coronaviruses. Ocular fluids can be used for cytology, culture and sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and determination of antibody content. 13. Do all field strains of T. gondii induce ophthalmic disease?\n\nThe disease-inducing potential of T. gondii probably varies, because relatively few of the many seropositive cats have ophthalmic disease. The actual prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in naturally exposed cats is unknown because it is difficult to confirm the diagnosis. Recent work suggests that ocular toxoplasmosis may occur in kittens infected transplacentally or in the postnatal period.\n\n14. How do you diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis?\n\nSerologic evaluation for T. gondii infection should include assays that detect IgG and IgM. T. gondii-specific IgM is detected for days to weeks in subclinically infected cats but may be of high magnitude in cats with clinical toxoplasmosis. Serum IgG antibodies develop approximately 2 weeks after infection and remain elevated in cats for years after exposure. \n\nAnterior uveitis and pars planitis are the most common ocular findings in cats with FlY. The uveitis is typically chronic and mild. A higher incidence of glaucoma has been associated with or without uveitis in FlY-positive cats.\n\n19. In what two ways can FIV produce uveitis?\n\nDirectly: through the local production of FIV antibodies and antigens. Indirectly: immunodeficiency associated with FIV can result in opportunistic infections such as T. gondii and C. neoformans.\n\nIt is difficult to prove that ocular inflammation is due to FlY. Presence of serum antibodies against FlY usually correlates with current infection but cannot be used to prove illness due to infection. Currently, the only way to document FlV-associated uveitis is to exclude all other known causes in a seropositive cat.\n\nFHV-l DNA and local FHV-l antibody production were detected in the aqueous humor of cats with suspected idiopathic uveitis. These results show that FHV-l can enter the eyes of cats and, in addition to keratoconjunctivitis, may be associated with uveitis. Serum antibody detection is of no benefit in the diagnosis of FHV-l uveitis because most cats are vaccinated or previously exposed to FHV-I. Aqueous humor can be tested for FHV-l by PCR commercially (Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).\n\nCats are the apparent reservoir host for B. henselae. Although clinical disease is rare, 55-81% of cats are seropositive. B. henselae is one of the causes of cat-scratch disease in humans, and uveal tract inflammation has been reported in association with infection. Bartonella spp. was suggested as a likely cause of anterior uveitis in one cat based on the presence of antibody production in aqueous humor and response to doxycycline. Bartonella spp., therefore, may be able to invade the eyes of cats and result in uveitis.\n\nFeLV has not been shown to cause primary ocular disease. Ocular disease associated with FeLV is manifested in two ways:\n\n\u2022 Metastatic lymphosarcoma of the anterior uvea and neurologic tissue \u2022 Opportunistic infections secondary to immunosuppression 24. How is FeLV-associated ocular disease diagnosed?\n\nThe clinical presentation of neoplastic infiltration of the uveal tract and resultant uveitis may vary widely. Nodular or diffuse infiltration of the posterior or anterior uveal tract is possible. Although isolated ocular lymphosarcoma is rare, many cats present primarily for ocular signs. A search for neoplastic involvement of other organs should be made. Cats with lymphosarcoma should be staged (I-V) and FeLV status should be determined because both are related to treatment response and prognosis (see Chapter 68). Ocular involvement is by definition stage V lymphosarcoma. Aqueous humor cytology may be diagnostic in cases in which obvious lymphosarcoma cannot be identified in other organs. Testing for FeLV is always indicated in cats with uveitis whether or not lymphosarcoma is suspected, because opportunistic infection may be present. The enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of the p27 antigen in the blood (serum) is a useful screening tool for FeLV, but a positive immunofluorescent assay (lFA) correlates better with persistent viremia (see Chapter 76). A positive FeLV test does not prove ocular disease due to the virus, nor does a negative test rule out lymphosarcoma. Most FeLV-positive cats do not have lymphosarcoma, and 20-70% of cats with confirmed lymphosarcoma are FeLV-negative.\n\nIdiopathic uveitis is any uveitis in which a cause cannot be identified. Unfortunately, a cause is not identified in 10-70% of cats with uveitis. The lymphocytic-plasmocytic infiltration of the anterior uvea found on histopathology in eyes lacking an etiologic diagnosis suggests that it may be immune-mediated. Whether this immune-mediated reaction is a true autoimmune disease or triggered by other antigenic stimulation remains to be determined in cats. Systemic therapy is the treatment of choice for posterior uveitis. Systemic glucocorticoid administration must be used with caution if an infectious process is suspected.\n\nTopical therapy is the treatment of choice for anterior uveitis. If inflammation is not well controlled, addition of subconjunctival or systemic medication may be necessary. \n\nThere is little information about their use in cats. NSAIDs should be considered only when glucocorticoids are contraindicated. Topical NSAIDs may complicate bacterial corneal infections and are not recommended. Systemic NSAIDs should be used with caution in cats because they have been associated with potentially severe side effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage, and bone marrow suppression."}
