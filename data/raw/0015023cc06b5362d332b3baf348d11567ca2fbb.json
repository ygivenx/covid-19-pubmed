The first 360 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).\n\nTo introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using \u0394PK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3\u2032 end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using \u0394PK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.\n\n132 133 author/funder. All rights reserved.

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.\n\nChanging the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

Therefore, it appears that replicons with a single PK are at a competitive 399 disadvantage compared to those with two or more.

The 5\u2032 UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.\n\nMoreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques. In addition, these differences were more pronounced in more PKs is functionally competent as no differences was seen between replicons congaing a single 472 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\n\nThe presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.
