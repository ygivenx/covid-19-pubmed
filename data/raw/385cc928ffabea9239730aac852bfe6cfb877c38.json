{"title": "Autophagy Genes Enhance Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 Reactivation from Latency by Preventing Virus-Induced Systemic Inflammation", "body": "Homogenized tissue or frozen viral supernatants were serially diluted in D5 medium (DMEM, 5% FBS, 2 mM Lglutamine, 1 mM HEPES) and applied to NIH 3T12 monolayers for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Samples were overlaid with 2% methylcellulose in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C. On day six, 3% neutral red in PBS was added to visualize plaques. The limit of detection for this assay is 50 PFU.\n\nMale mice were infected with 1x10 6 PFU per mouse, i.p with M3FL-MHV68. D-luciferin (Sigma) was reconstituted to a concentration of 15 mg/ml in PBS and stored at -80C until use. To image mice, D-luciferin solution was injected in mice i.p. at a dose of 150 mg/kg and mice were placed back into cages for five minutes. The mice were anesthetized in a 2.5-3.5% isoflurane chamber for three to five minutes and placed on the imaging chamber, positioned such that there was continuous flow of isoflurane into the nose cones during imaging. Bioluminescence imaging of M3FL-MHV68-infected mice was collected on the Xenogen IVIS 200 system (Caliper Life Sciences), and data collection and analysis were done on the Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences) by selecting a region of interest and measuring the total flux and average radiance.\n\nPECs or splenocytes were stained for live cells (Live/Dead Fixable Aqua, Invitrogen) and with the following antibodies: CD3e (clone 145-2C11), CD4 (clone RM4-5), CD8a (clone 53-6.7), CD19 (clone 6D5), CD64 (clone X54-5/7.1), MHC H-2Kb (clone AF6-88.5), MHC I-A/E (clone M5/114.15.2), NK1.1 (clone PK136), CD11c (clone N418), CD11b (clone M1/70), MerTK (R&D Systems, BAF591), F4/80 (clone BM8), Ly6G (clone IA8), Ly6C (clone HK1.4), CD80 (clone 16-10A1), CD86 (clone GL-1). For intracellular cytokine analyses, cells were incubated for five hours with Brefeldin A and monensin. After surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences, 554714) and stained for IFN-\u03b3 (clone XMG1.2) or iNOS (clone CXNFT). All flow cytometry data were collected on LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Flowjo 10.1 (Tree Star).\n\nTissue samples were homogenized with 1.0mm silica beads on the mini BeadBeater (Biospec) and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Ambion). PECs were flushed out of mice using 8 ml of D10 media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM HEPES, 1% NEAA) and washed once with D10 media. 5x10 6 PECs were plated on a TC treated plate for at least 24 hours at 37\u00b0C to allow macrophages to adhere. Cells were washed with PBS and RNA was extracted using RNEasy Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis using ImProm II (Promega) was performed. Real time qPCR using SYBR Green was performed for the specified targets, using actin as an internal control. Primers used were \u03b2-actin (5'-GCTCCTTCGTTGCCGGTCCA-3' and 5'-TTGCACATGCCGGAGCCGTT-3'), Nos2 (5'-GTTCTCAGCCCAACAATACAAGA-3' and 5'-GTGGACGGGTCGATGTCAC-3'), Tnf (5'-TGGCCTCCCTCTCATCAGTTC-3' and 5'-GCTACAGGCTTGTCACTCGAATTTT-3'), Il1b (5'-GCACACCCACCCTGCAG-3' and 5'-AACCGTTTTTCCATCTTCTTCTT-3'), Mx1 (5'-TCTGAGGAGAGCCAGACGAT-3' and 5'-ACTCTGGTCCCCAATGACAG-3') and\n\nOasl2 (5'-GGATGCCTGGGAGAGAATCG-3' and 5'-TCGCCTGCTCTTCGAAAC TG-3'). Transcript levels were analyzed using the \u0394\u0394CT method, with \u03b2-actin as the reference gene.\n\nmRNA was extracted from cell lysates by means of oligo-dT beads (Invitrogen). For cDNA synthesis, we used custom oligo-dT primer with a barcode and adaptor-linker sequence (CCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-XXXXXXXX-T15). After first-strand synthesis, samples were pooled together based on Actb qPCR values and RNA-DNA hybrid was degraded with consecutive acid-alkali treatment. Then, a second sequencing linker (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTG) was ligated with T4 ligase (NEB) followed by SPRI clean-up. The mixture then was PCR enriched 12 cycles and SPRI purified to yield final strand-specific RNA-seq libraries. Libraries were sequenced using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using 50bpX25bp pair-end sequencing. Second mate was used for sample demultiplexing. Reads were aligned to the GRCm38.p2 assembly of mouse genome using STAR aligner. Additional options were \"--outFilterMultimapNmax 15 --outFilterMismatchNmax 6 --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM\". Aligned reads were quantified using quant3p script (github.com/ctlab/quant3p) to account for specifics of 3' sequencing: higher dependency on good 3' annotation and lower level of sequence specificity close to 3' end. RefSeq genome annotation was used. Using MACS2 peak caller around 70000 putative exons were identified (peaks in rnaseq alignment not overlapping with known exons). Around 6600 of them were assigned to a gene located within 5000 bp and added into annotation. For on average 1 million reads per sample that mapped to multiple genome positions there were only one exonic alignment. For these reads multimapper flags were removed for read counting purposes. Actual read counting were carried out by ht-seq with enriched genome annotation and alignment with fixed multimapper flags. DESeq2 was used for differential gene expression analysis which was used as ranked list in pre-ranked GSEA analysis to identify pathway enrichments. RNA-seq data were deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number PRJEB10074. (A) PECs from na\u00efve or latently-infected mice were stained for various surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data were combined from three independent biological replicate experiments. Each point represents a single mouse and data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons post-test. Only significant comparisons are indicated. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 (B) Transcript levels of the indicated genes were measured in latently infected peritoneal macrophages from Atg5 f/f and Atg5 f/f -LysMcre mice and were normalized to \u03b2-actin using \u2206\u2206C T method for quantitation. Statistical significance was analyzed by non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. ***p<0.005, ****p <0.001 (C) Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on RNA-seq data from na\u00efve and latent adherent peritoneal macrophages from Atg16l1 f/f and Atg16l1 f/f -LysMcre mice.\n\n(D) Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of iNOS in peritoneal macrophages (F4/80 -hi , CD11b -hi ) of Atg5 f/f and Atg5 f/f -LysMcre mice 28 days after infection using flow cytometry.

Cells were stained for intracellular iNOS protein and measured by flow cytometry. MFI of iNOS was measured in peritoneal macrophages (F4/80 -hi , CD11b -hi ) and iNOS + gate set was set based on the intracellular stain using an isotype control. Each point represents a single mouse and data were analyzed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test comparing the two genotypes within each treatment group. **p <0.01 "}
