{"title": "Original Article", "body": "Niclosamide (5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide; Fig. 1 .) belongs to the family of medicines called anthelmintic drugs, which are effective against most tapeworms [1, 2] . Its action against tapeworm species is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, block glucose uptake, and inhibit respiration in anaerobic ATP production [3, 4] . Niclosamide is a US Food and Drug Administration approved compound that has been used in humans for 40 years [5] . It is commercially known as Bayer 73 in Germany or bayluscide or niclocide in Canada and the United States [6, 7] . It is well tolerated by rats with an acute oral toxicity. A significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs when niclosamide is given to male and female rats at a concentration of 5 g/ kg/day for four weeks [6e8] . Niclosamide is effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [9] . It also has antineoplastic activity and anti-anthrax toxin properties [10, 11] . Niclosamide induces LC3-positive autophagosomes and inhibits the Wnt/Frizzled pathway and mTOR signaling [12e14]. Niclosamide's interaction with proteins and enzymes explains its mechanism of action in the human body. Thermodynamic parameters are especially helpful in identifying the binding mechanism of a drug to any protein. Serum proteins are the major transport protein in human body. Albumin is a serum protein widely used to explain the binding mechanism of a small molecule to a protein. Serum proteins are capable of reversibly binding many endogenous and exogenous drugs [15, 16] . They may aid in selective delivery of the drugs to a target tissue, organ, or tumor region, thus delivering drugs into the cell. Most recently, a large number of studies on the drugeprotein interaction have been reported using techniques including fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichoism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance [17e21]. It is necessary to determine binding parameters during destabilization by these methods for drugeprotein systems.\n\nFluorescence serves as a sensitive method indicating alterations of the fluorophore environment, thus resulting in plenty of useful information [21] . Many drugs are not fluorescent but proteins have a fluorescent character that results from the protein's tyrptophan and tyrosine residues [22e24]. This property allows the monitoring of alterations of the protein during binding. Due to fluorescence quenching, binding can be analyzed through reduction of fluorescence intensity or the shifting of the emission wavelength of the protein upon the addition of the drug [16] .\n\nIn this study, the binding mechanism of niclosamide to several proteins including human serum albumin, globulin, and hemoglobin is investigated using fluorescence and UVvisible spectroscopy. The nature of the drug's binding mechanism to all proteins was described by using SterneVolmer and van't Hoff equations. Synchronous fluorescence was also used for all proteins to determine environmental changes corresponding to the interactions. The aim of this work was to estimate interactions of niclosamide with serum proteins.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nNiclosamide, HCl, NaOH, hemoglobin, globulin, and albumin from human serum (97e99%), and Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All reagents and chemicals were of molecular and analytical grade. The ultra pure water was purified using the Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).\n\nAbsorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu-1700 UVvisible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using a 1 cm quartz cell. Fluorescence spectra were scanned by a Perkin Elmer LS-55 spectrofluorometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a xenon lamp source and a 1 cm quartz cell.\n\nNiclosamide was prepared as 1mM of stock solution in a water-dimethylformamide solvent system (V:V, 90:10%) for all experiments. Then, 1 mg mL \u00c01 of protein solution was prepared by directly dissolving the protein in a Tris buffer including 20mM of Tris at pH, 7.4. All aqueous solutions used in testing contained 10% (v/v) dimethylformamide for all measurements. An appropriate volume of niclosamide solution was added to the proteins ranging from 1 mg to 20 mg and mixed for 10 minutes at room temperature. The fluorescence spectra from 200 nm to 500 nm were scanned by a spectrofluorometer using a 500 nm scan speed and 10 nm slit in a quartz cell. An appropriate volume of protein (10 mg) was mixed with different amounts of niclosamide between 1 mM mL \u00c01 and 80 mM mL \u00c01 and then, diluted to 2.0 mL with Tris buffer. The fluorescence spectra of the solutions at different temperatures were collected at the excitation wavelength of 280 nm.\n\nAppropriate concentrations of proteins in Tris buffer were mixed with different concentrations of niclosamide. The emission spectrum was recorded with Dl \u00bc 15 nm or Dl \u00bc 60 nm for all niclosamideeprotein complexes.\n\nAppropriate concentrations of all proteins in 20mM of Tris buffer (pH:7.4) were added to different amounts of niclosamide between 1 mM and 80 mM. The absorption spectra of the niclosamideeprotein complexes were collected by using the Shimadzu 1700 UV-visible spectrophotometer.\n\nProtein emits strong fluorescence peaks at 280 nm and 342 nm at excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The quenching effect of niclosamide on proteins' intrinsic fluorescence was studied for three proteins. The presence of niclosamide led to a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of human serum albumin (HSA) with a slight blue shift as increasing amounts of the drug were added ( Fig. 2A) . The intensity of fluorescence of both hemoglobin and globulin decreased with a slight red shift, suggesting that niclosamide interacts with these proteins ( Fig. 2B and C).\n\nProteins are composed of 20 amino acids in different sequences. The fluorescence of proteins results mainly from two j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 5 4 9 e5 5 5 amino acid residues: tryptophan and tyrosine. When Dl is set at 60 nm, the synchronous fluorescence spectrum has the characteristic peak of the tryptophan residues [22] . When set at 15 nm, the characteristic peak of tyrosine residues in proteins appears. The polarity changes of the surrounding environment depend on the shift of the maximum emission. Blue shift of the fluorescence spectrum indicates that the polarity decreases and the hydrophobicity increases for the protein molecule [23] . The spectral changes of all proteins on synchronous fluorescence upon the addition of niclosamide are shown in Fig. 3 . The maximum emission peaks of tyrosine residues (Dl \u00bc 15 nm) and tryptophan residues (Dl \u00bc 60 nm) exhibited a slight shift for all proteins. As Fig. 4A and C shows, however, it is obvious that the pitch of quenching at Dl 60 nm is higher than that at Dl 15 nm for HSA and globulin, indicating that niclosamide is closer to tryptophan residues than tyrosine residues. This means that the binding sites of the drug are more prevalent on the tryptophan moiety. For hemoglobin, at a low concentration of the drug the pitch of quenching at Dl 15 nm is higher than that at Dl 60 nm, whereas it is lower than that of Dl 60 nm at a high concentration of niclosamide (Fig. 4B) . These results suggest that the polarity of the surrounding environment depends on the concentration of the drug. Both the tyrosine and tryptophan moieties exert an effect on the binding mechanism of hemoglobin.\n\nEmission spectra of proteins \n\nFluorescence quenching can generally be classified as either static or dynamic; and static and dynamic quenching may also occur simultaneously. The mechanism by which niclosamide quenches the fluorescence of the three proteins was determined using the SterneVolmer equation [16] :\n\nwhere F 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of the proteins before and after the addition of the quencher; K q is the quenching constant; K SV is the SterneVolmer quenching constant; [Q] is the concentration of the quencher; and s 0 is the average biomolecular fluorescence lifetime, which is considered to be 10 \u00c08 seconds [25, 26] .\n\nThe SterneVolmer plots at different temperatures are given in Fig. 5AeC . As given in Table 1 , the values of K q at different temperatures (296 K, 299 K and 302 K) are estimated as 3.32 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 , 3.05 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 and 2.76 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 for HSA. The Kq values were found to be 0.46 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 , 0.49 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 and 0.52 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 for hemoglobin, and they were determined as 0.44 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 , 0.39 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 and 0.36 \u00c2 10 13 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 for globulin. The results indicated that the values of K q were larger than the maximum scattering collision quenching constant of 2.0 \u00c2 10 10 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 for HSA, hemoglobin, and globulin [26] . These results suggested a static quenching mechanism of niclosamide with each protein [27] .\n\nThe absorbtion spectrum can also classify the quenching mechanism between a drug molecule and a protein as either static or dynamic quenching. Although static quenching only affects ground-state complex formation, dynamic quenching results in the excited fluorophore states. Dynamic quenching led to no changes in the absorption spectra [27] . The absorbance of niclosamide was decreased upon the addition of all proteins, as seen in Fig. 6AeC . This implies that the interactions between niclosamide and each protein occurred by static quenching.\n\nNiclosamide quenched the fluorescence intensity of each protein by binding to a set of equivalent sites on the protein.\n\nThe equilibrium between the number of binding sites (n) and the binding constant (K b ) is estimated using the following equation [24] :\n\nwhere K b is the binding constant, and n is the number of binding sites per protein. If we plotted lg (F 0 e F)/F vs. lg[Q], the values of K b and n were determined for each niclosamideeprotein complex ( Table 1 ). The number of binding sites, n was determined to be 1.33, 1.26 and 1.21 at the respective temperatures of 296 K, 299 K, and 302 K for HSA. Values of n were estimated to be 1.29, 1.24, and 1.05 for hemoglobin, and 1.04, 1.17, and 1.26 for globulin at 296 K, 299 K, and 302 K. All data are given in Table 1 . The changes in n values with increases in temperature might be a result of the protein structure's changes with temperature.\n\nK b values were estimated as 0.162 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 , 0.185 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 , and 0.262 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 for HSA at the respective temperatures of 296 K, 299 K, and 302 K. Although the binding constants were found to be 0.020 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 , 0.017 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 , and 0.013 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 for hemoglobin, they were 0.011 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 , 0.017 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 , and 0.026 \u00c2 10 3 L mol \u00c01 for globulin at these temperatures. The values of K b Fig. 5 e SterneVolmer plots for the quenching of (A) human serum albumin, (B) hemoglobin, and (C) globulin by niclosamide at different temperatures. j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 5 4 9 e5 5 5 decreased as the temperature increased, which was assumed to decrease the stability of the niclosamideehemoglobin complex. Unlike hemoglobin, an increase in temperature increased the stability of the niclosamideeprotein complexes for HSA and globulin.\n\nThermodynamic parameters and nature of the binding forces\n\nThe binding mechanism between proteins and small molecules like drugs involves several bonds such as hydrophobic force, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals interactions [18e28]. The relationship between acting force and thermodynamic parameters was described by Ross and Subramanian [29] as follows: (1) DH < 0 and DS < 0 indicates van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds; (2) DH < 0 and DS > 0 indicates electrostatic interactions; and (3) DH > 0 and DS > 0 indicates hydrophobic forces. The values of the enthalpy change (DH) and the entropy change (DS) can be measured from the following equations:\n\nwhere K b is the binding constant at the different temperatures, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. van't Hoff plots between log K b and 1/T were used to estimate the values of enthalpy (DH) and entropy (DS) change. The values of DH and DS were determined to be \u00c01.71 kJ mol \u00c01 and \u00c02.81 J mol \u00c01 K for HSA, respectively ( Table 2 ). The binding of niclosamide to HSA is carried out by both van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonding, which involve negative values of DH and DS. These values were found to be \u00c02.03 kJ mol \u00c01 and \u00c06.15 J mol \u00c01 K \u00c01 for hemoglobin, whereas they were estimated as 3.39 kJ mol \u00c01 K \u00c01 and 12.05 J mol \u00c01 K \u00c01 for globulin, respectively. The values of DH and DS were also negative at the experimental temperature, indicating that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds play major roles in the binding process for hemoglobin. The positive values of DH and DS for globulin suggest a hydrophobic interaction. The free energy changes (DG) at different temperature were estimated as \u00c00.88 kJ mol \u00c01 (296 K), \u00c00.87 kJ mol \u00c01 (299 K), and \u00c00.86 kJ mol \u00c01 (302 K) for HSA and as \u00c00.21 kJ mol \u00c01 (296 K), \u00c00.19 kJ mol \u00c01 (299 K), and \u00c00.17 kJ mol \u00c01 (302 K) for hemoglobin. The values of DG were negative at all experimental temperatures, indicating that the reaction was spontaneous for HSA and hemoglobin. Positive values of DG at 296 K (6.96 kJ mol \u00c01 ), 299 K (6.99 kJ mol \u00c01 ), and 302 K (7.03 kJ mol \u00c01 ) show that globulin binding was energy dependent. j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 5 4 9 e5 5 5 4.\n\nThe interactions of niclosamide with proteins such as hemoglobin, HSA, and globulin were studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission of each protein decreased with the addition of niclosamide to the protein solution, leading to an energy transfer between drug and protein molecules. Static quenching is the main mechanism through which all proteins quenched. Thermodynamic parameters suggested that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are the forces behind niclosamide's interactions with HSA and hemoglobin. The interaction of niclosamide with globulin, by contrast, is carried out via hydrophobic interaction. These results show that the binding mechanism of the drug to each protein depends on the protein's structure.\n\nThe author declares no conflicts of interest."}
