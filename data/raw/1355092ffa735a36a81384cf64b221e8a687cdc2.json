Abnormal pupil responses result from retinopathy or central nervous system involvement.

Signs of anterior uveitis may also be present such as flare, hyperemia of the iris surface, keratic precipitates and fibrin. Systemic illness is present, typically with pyrexia, inappetence, weight loss and malaise, and often with dyspnea.\n\nHistory of variable pupil behavior with pupils alternating between miotic or dilated, in one or both eyes, over weeks to months. Intervening periods of normality with equal pupils and/or neoplastic disease affecting the iris, iris thickening and inflammation.\n\nFibrinous peritonitis, CNS disease or fibrinous uveitis in a young cat with variable vision loss and/or abnormal pupil reflexes. Anorexia, malaise and/or pyrexia are typically present.\n\nThis chapter refers only to diseases within the globe causing an abnormal pupil size, shape or response.\n\nFor other disease processes occurring remotely from the eye see main reference on page 1282 for details (The Cat With Anisocoria or Abnormally Dilated or Constricted Pupils).\n\nFor infectious conditions affecting the iris and therefore pupil size or response see main reference on page 1295 for details (The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance).\n\nDisease processes affecting pupil size or response can generally be divided into:\n\n\u2022 Those which affect afferent pathways, i.e. going towards the central nervous system (CNS) from the retina. \u2022 Those which affect efferent pathways, i.e. going away from the CNS towards the effector organ, in this case the dilator and constrictor muscles of the iris. \u2022 Those which affect the effector organ, the iris (these diseases are largely covered in The Cat With Changed Iris Appearance).\n\nThe term anisocoria refers to a difference in pupil size between the two eyes of the same animal.\n\nThe term dyscoria refers to an abnormality in shape.\n\nThe terms mydriasis and miosis refers to the states of pupil dilation and pupil constriction, respectively.\n\nTo demonstrate complete normality of pupil function, the pupil must be shown to dilate in a dark environment and to constrict after stimulation by bright light.\n\nDynamic contraction anisocoria, where the direct response of an eye to light stimulation is greater than the indirect response in the opposite eye is regarded as normal in cats. Only static anisocoria (i.e. where one eye is not being stimulated by a light source) is regarded as abnormal.\n\nDisease processes therefore either involve the retina, afferent and efferent nerve pathways or iris and are most often degenerative, hypertensive, infectious or toxic in nature.\n\nAbnormalities in pupil size or response can originate from lesions or dysfunction in any of the following regions: \u2022 Retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts or midbrain which form the afferent arm for reflexes which regulate pupillary responses, i.e. they detect the amount of light getting into the system and transmit information about the light levels to the midbrain. \u2022 Parasympathetic nervous system. The efferent arm for pupillary constriction consists of the parasympathetic nucleus of the oculomotor nerve, parasympathetic fibers in cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve), ciliary ganglion and long ciliary nerves. \u2022 Sympathetic nervous system. The efferent arm for pupillary dilation consists of the thalamus, cervical spinal cord long tracts, T1-T3 spinal nerves, preganglionic fibers in the cervical region, cranial cervical ganglion and postganglionic fibers especially as they course through the middle ear. \u2022 Iris. Diseases which affect pupil size or response can affect either the dilator or constrictor muscles.\n\nThe most common causes of abnormalities of pupil size or response are: Pear-or tear-shaped pupil, with adhesion of the acute angle of the tear to the lens capsule or to a traumatic defect in the cornea.\n\n\u2022 Feline hemidilated pupil syndrome* (p 1287) D shape (left eye) or reverse D (right eye) shaped pupil, which becomes accentuated on stimulation of the pupil with bright light.\n\n\u2022 Diseases of the retina.\n\n\u2022 Diseases of the central nervous system.\n\nLess frequent causes of abnormal size or response are: \u2022 Neuropathy of the parasympathetic fibers within cranial nerve III, which supply the pupillary constrictor muscle, or disease confined to the iris involving the constrictor muscle. \u2022 Injury to the sympathetic fibers supplying the iris dilator, most commonly trauma in the cranial thoracic or cervical region, disease of the middle ear or disease confined to the iris affecting the dilator muscle. \u2022 Hypertensive retinopathy, fungal or Toxoplasma infection causing chorioretinitis or anterior uveitis, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and retinal degeneration from inherited or nutritional (taurine deficiency) causes are the most common intra-ocular causes of abnormal pupil size, shape or response.\n\n\u2022 Acute-onset vision loss in an old cat.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset, usually bilateral, dilated pupils non-responsive or poorly responsive to light.\n\nHypertension causes vasoconstriction of pre-capillary retinal arterioles. Hypoxia of the arteriole causes smooth muscle necrosis, eventually leading to vascular dilatation and leakage of serum and blood.\n\nLeakage from vessels causes serous retinal detachment, subretinal, intraretinal or preretinal hemorrhage.\n\nHypertension is most commonly the result of hyperthyroidism, renal disease or is idiopathic.\n\nTypical history is of acute onset of vision loss in an old cat, or acute onset of bilaterally (usually) dilated pupils that are non-responsive or poorly responsive to light.\n\nFundoscopic findings range from retinal hemorrhage and localized subretinal exudates, to extensive bullous retinal detachment.\n\nOther signs suggestive of hypertension such as a bounding cardiac apex beat may be evident.\n\nOther signs suggestive of renal and/or thyroid disease such as progressive weight loss, polydypsia, polyuria or azotemic breath may be detected from the history or physical examination.\n\nDiagnosis is initially based on the characteristic clinical signs.\n\nConfirmation of the diagnosis is based on a workup involving:\n\n\u2022 Blood pressure measurement.\n\n\u2022 Clinical pathology suggestive of renal and/or thyroid disease. \u2022 Other procedures such as imaging of the thyroid with radio-isotopes or cardiac ultrasound.\n\nAmlodipine (Norvasc, Pfizer) is a calcium channel blocker which has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Dose is approx 0.625 mg/cat/day, i.e. 1 \u20444 of a 2.5 mg tablet (USA) or 1 \u20448 of a 5 mg tablet (Australia) q 24 h.\n\nIf hypertension is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy then calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem may be used. For more detail see main reference on page 162 for details (The Cat With Tachycardia, Bradycardia or An Irregular Rhythm).\n\nb-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal) can also be used in the management of the cardiac disease at 1 \u20444 of a 10 mg tablet q 8 h.\n\nHyperthyroidism, when present, should be treated by surgery, radioactive iodine (131-I) or anti-thyroid drugs \n\nOrganisms that may produce signs of chorioretinitis or uveitis include protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii), fungi (Cryptococcus neoformans, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis), parasites (ophthalmomyiasis (fly larval migration)).\n\nSystemic clinical signs of fever, dyspnea, gastrointestinal disease, upper respiratory disease or other organ involvement suggest infection with Toxoplasma or any of the systemic fungal diseases.\n\nAbnormal pupil responses occur due to retinopathy or to central nervous system involvement.\n\nVariable degrees of vision loss result, depending on degree of retinal or central nervous tissue injury.\n\nVariable signs on fundoscopy including retinal detachments, retinal hemorrhages, subretinal exudates, subretinal granulomas, and pre-retinal hemorrhages consistent with chorioretinitis.\n\nSigns of anterior uveitis such as flare, hyperemia of the iris surface, keratic precipitates, and/or fibrin.\n\nDiagnosis is based initially on the identification of suspicious signs on careful examination of the fundus and the anterior segment.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed by serology, or identification of the characteristic morphology of a pathogen from the subretinal exudate or anterior chamber fluid, or from another site such as lymph node, bone marrow, liver or lung aspirate. \u2022 Technique of anterior chamber aqueous centesis: Prepare the eye using a 1:20 Povidine solution. Under sedation using topical anesthesia and using illumination and magnification, pass a 30-G needle obliquely into the anterior chamber. It is important to visualize the needle passing into the anterior chamber anterior to the iris. Drain approximately 1 \u20442 a needle hub, then withdraw the needle. Many infectious agents may not actually be present within the eye to cause ocular disease, but cause pathology by the presence of immunocompetent cells within the uveal tissue, which have been stimulated by antigens in sites remote from the eye. Toxoplasma gondii is thought to cause uveitis in this way.\n\nAn important differential diagnosis is hypertensive retinopathy. This is usually a very acute disease occurring mainly in old cats, which have other signs such as weight loss, and renal or cardiac disease. It is not associated with anterior uveitis, and is not usually associated with other CNS signs, although seizures may occur. In the eye, the most common presenting sign is a fibrinous uveitis. Fibrinous exudation results in cream to red-colored solid opacities in the anterior chamber, or over the surface of the iris.\n\nOther signs of anterior uveitis such as blood or cloudiness in the anterior chamber, miosis, general reddening or thickening of the iris, and injection of deep episcleral vessels may be evident.\n\nVariable vision loss and/or abnormal pupil reflexes may be present.\n\nUsually occurs in a cat less than 3 years of age, which has been housed with other cats in the previous 18 months, for example, in a cattery or multi-cat household.\n\nDiagnosis is based initially on the suspicious clinical signs. The \"wet\" forms (fibrinous peritonitis) and \"dry\" forms of the disease usually occur separately.\n\nSerology is usually regarded as being of dubious benefit in the diagnosis, as the FIP organism cross-reacts with enteric forms of coronavirus.\n\nDiagnosis can only be confirmed on characteristic histopathology of affected tissues on biopsy or necropsy examination. Typical change is described as a pyogranulomatous vasculitis. Necrosis and a fibrinoid response are seen in some cases.\n\n\u2022 Dilated non-responsive pupil associated with normal vision. \u2022 History of recent use of one of these drugs in the same eye.\n\nDilated non-responsive pupil(s) associated with normal vision.\n\nHistory of use of eye drops containing a parasympatholytic drug such as atropine or tropicamide in the previous 1-2 weeks.\n\nDiagnosis is based purely on the clinical signs, and the history of recent use of one of these drugs in the same eye.\n\nDiagnosis is usually confirmed by the return of normal pupil reflexes within 1-2 weeks of cessation of use of the drug in the eye.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of bilaterally dilated pupils, non-responsive to light. \u2022 Acute onset vision loss. \u2022 History of recent use of a fluoroquinolone, especially at higher than recommended dose.\n\nAcute onset of bilaterally dilated pupils that are nonresponsive to light.\n\nThere is a history of recent use of a fluoroquinolone, especially at higher than recommended dose rate. Blindness may also occur at the recommended dose, and appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug.\n\n\u2022 Anecdotal personal communication suggests that the problem is seen frequently when Enrofloxacin is given at a daily dose rate of 20 mg/kg (the standard recommended dose rate is 5 mg/kg q 24 h).\n\nThe retina has a normal appearance on fundoscopy.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the acute onset of the clinical signs and the history of recent use of a fluoroquinolone, especially at a higher than recommended dose.\n\nPrognosis for vision is usually guarded, but may be improved if the toxicity is recognized in the early stages and the drug withdrawn immediately.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Vision loss in advanced cases.\n\n\u2022 Typical ophthalmoscopic signs starting in the area centralis progressing to involve the whole of the retina. \u2022 History of inadequate diet.\n\nThe disease occurs in cats fed an inadequate diet, especially cats fed commercial dog foods, or a diet high in plant fiber.\n\nTaurine deficiency is regarded as being the primary factor leading to photoreceptor degeneration.\n\nThe syndromes feline central retinal degeneration (FCRD) and taurine deficiency retinopathy are regarded by many authors as being the same disease. The disease is still occasionally seen in cats which appear to have adequate levels of dietary taurine, but the overall incidence of the disease throughout the world appears to have declined as the taurine content of commercial diets has been increased.\n\nTaurine deficiency also causes dilated cardiomyopathy. See main references on page 151 for details (The Cat With Abnormal Heart Sounds and/or an Enlarged Heart).\n\nVision loss occurs in the later stages of the disease, and is associated with a poor pupil light reflex.\n\n\u2022 Focal degeneration occurs in the area centralis at first. The area centralis at first develops a granular appearance, then becomes hyper-reflective. \u2022 A second hyper-reflective lesion then develops nasal to the optic disc, which eventually coalesces with the area centralis lesion to form a broad hyperreflective band dorsal to the optic disc. \u2022 Finally, generalized retinal degeneration develops, with generalized tapetal hyper-reflectivity and retinal vessel attenuation.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical signs, in particular observation of the typical retinal lesions.\n\nElectroretinography (ERG) can be performed to identify altered photoreceptor function. Cones appear to be affected more than rods, so these cats will have reduced b waves in photopic (light) conditions and better responses in scotopic (dark-adapted) conditions.\n\nAdminister taurine supplementation. A minimum intake of 110 mg/kg body weight per day is needed for maintenance of normal retinal function.\n\nEffects of prolonged deficiency are only partially reversible, and supplementation is of no value where there is advanced retinal degeneration with blindness. The appearance of the lesions evident at time of diagnosis will remain the same, even though the ERG signs associated with rod degeneration may reverse.\n\n\u2022 Pear-or tear-shaped pupil, with adhesion of the acute angle of the tear to the lens capsule or to a traumatic defect in the cornea.\n\nPear-or tear-shaped pupil, with the acute angle of the tear sticking to either the lens capsule, or to a traumatic defect in the cornea.\n\nThe abnormal shape is often accentuated by stimulating the papillary light reflex with a bright light.\n\nDiagnosis is based purely on careful examination of the eye by focal light examination or slit lamp biomicroscopy.\n\nTreatment is usually either medical or surgical.\n\n\u2022 Medical treatment with mydriatics such as atropine, mydriacyl or 10% phenylephrine will sometimes pull the iris away from the lens or cornea, if used in the very early stages. \u2022 Surgical repair by a veterinary ophthalmic surgeon is recommended. Repair the corneal laceration and replace the iris and tamponade away from the corneal wound, using viscoelastics.\n\n\u2022 History of variable pupil behavior with pupils at different times alternating between miotic or dilated, in one or both eyes, over weeks to months. Intervening periods of normality with equal pupils. \u2022 Normal vision. \u2022 Pupils may fail to dilate or incompletely dilate in semi-darkness.\n\nViral neuritis is caused by feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and affects the parasympathetic and/or sympathetic efferent fibers to the iris.\n\nCats retain vision, but the pupils fail to dilate, or incompletely dilate in semi-darkness.\n\nThe history often reveals paradoxically varying pupil behavior, with pupils alternating between miotic or dilated, in one or both eyes in the weeks to months prior to presentation. There may have been intervening periods of normality with equal pupils.\n\nOther ocular signs may be seen, for example, FeLVassociated lymphoma involving the iris, may cause swelling and hemorrhage of the iris surface. See main reference on page 1300 for more details (The Cat With Abnormal Iris Appearance).\n\nDiagnosis is based on the history of an intermittent, bizarre, inexplicable variation in pupil response.\n\nSupportive evidence is based on positive testing for FeLV.\n\nThere is no treatment for this condition. This syndrome is thought to have a very poor prognosis with most cats dying within 2 years from other manifestations of the feline leukemia complex.\n\n\u2022 D-shaped pupil in the left eye or reverse D-shaped pupil in the right eye.\n\nCats have two short ciliary nerves carrying only parasympathetic fibers from the ciliary ganglion, referred to as the malar (lateral) and nasal (medial) nerves. The malar nerve innervates the lateral half of the iris sphincter, while the nasal nerve innervates the medial half. The dog in contrast has 5-8 short ciliary nerves which contain both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers.\n\nDamage to the malar nerve results in constriction of only the medial half of the pupillary constrictor muscle, while damage to the nasal nerve will cause constriction of only the lateral half of the muscle during miosis.\n\nPupil appears as D shaped in the left eye or reverse D shaped in the right eye. The D shape is accentuated by stimulating the pupillary light reflex with a bright light.\n\nBased entirely on the observation of a D-or reverse D-shaped pupil.\n\nNo specific treatment is indicated. Some will reverse over time, provided the nerve has not been completely transected.\n\n\u2022 White cat with behavioral signs suggesting deafness. \u2022 With a unilateral blue iris, pupils are uneven sized (anisocoria) with a larger pupil on side of blue iris.\n\nReduced pigmentation of the iris causes blue iris coloration in a white cat. These cats also have reduced pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, and have no tapetum. Where the lack of pigment is unilateral, there will always be an anisocoria, with the non-pigmented side having a larger pupil. This is thought to be the result of an abnormality of the pupillary light reflex, caused by the effect of lack of pigment on the development of the afferent pathways to the lateral geniculate nucleus and pretectal nucleus.\n\nWhite cat with behavioral signs suggesting deafness.\n\nDiagnosis is based purely on the clinical signs occurring in a white cat.\n\n\u2022 Loss of normal iris color associated with increased transparency of the iris in an old cat. \u2022 Dilated pupil with sluggish pupillary light reflex (PLR).\n\nAge-related atrophy and thinning of iris structures occur, especially involving the anterior stroma, pupil margin and associated pupillary constrictor muscle.\n\nCat is older than 10 years of age.\n\nThere is loss of normal coloration because of loss of pigment in the anterior iris stroma. This may be especially obvious in old Siamese or other color-dilute cats with blue irides (e.g. Himalayan). The iris can become so thin, that it may take on a transparent appearance. Vision is normal.\n\nLoss of normal pupillary light reflex is associated with atrophy of the pupillary sphincter. This sign is less commonly seen in the cat than in the dog, as the pupillary sphincter shape is more often conserved in feline iris atrophy, resulting in a sluggish pupillary light reflex rather than a dilated non-responsive pupil. Visible defects may occur around the pupil margin with atrophy.\n\nDiagnosis is based purely on consideration of the age and breed of the cat, that is, an old color-dilute cat greater than 10 years of age, and on the clinical signs of a sluggish pupillary light reflex, and loss of iris pigmentation.\n\nNo treatment is possible for iris atrophy.\n\nClassical signs \n\nBlind cat with partial to complete loss of pupil light reflex.\n\nRetinal hemorrhages and attenuated, pale retinal vessels.\n\nOther signs of severe anemia, e.g. pale mucous membranes, increased respiratory rate and lethargy. Anemia must be profound for this syndrome to occur, i.e. usually the PCV is less than 10% or hemoglobin less than 5 g/dl.\n\nDiagnosis is based initially on the clinical signs of a severely anemic cat with poor papillary light reflexes and multiple small retinal hemorrhages.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed on hematology. The cause of the anemia should be identified. Common causes of profound anemia include FeLV-associated anemia or Mycoplasma haemofelis infection. FeLV-associated anemia may also be accompanied by thrombocytopenia which may contribute to the retinal hemorrhages.\n\n\u2022 Blindness and loss of pupil reflexes.\n\n\u2022 Extremely dilated tortuous retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhages, retinal detachment, perivascular effusion, optic disc edema. \u2022 Monoclonal globulin spike on protein electrophoresis.\n\nBlindness and loss of pupil reflexes occur due to retinal damage.\n\nExtremely dilated, tortuous retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhages, retinal detachment, perivascular effusion and optic disc edema are evident on fundoscopy.\n\nA variety of other clinical signs including lethargy, weight loss, inappetence, pale mucous membranes, neurological signs and lameness may be exhibited.\n\nRare condition in cats.\n\nDiagnosis is initially based on the suspicious signs seen on fundoscopy, especially the presence of bizarre, dilated, tortuous retinal vessels. \n\nOcular signs are due to abnormalities of autonomic innervation to eye structures and can include reduced lacrimation, dilated non-responsive pupils, anisocoria, prolapsed third eyelids and photophobia in a cat with vision.\n\nOther systemic signs such as constipation, vomiting and regurgitation, dry mouth or dry nostrils are related to effects of the disease on autonomic nerves supplying secretory glands or the gastrointestinal system.\n\nTypically, the onset of signs is acute over 48 h and associated with depression and anorexia.\n\nRare disease, and most common in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe disease can be suspected in any cat showing combinations of the clinical signs.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is based on histopathology of autonomic ganglia at necropsy.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Strands of iris-like tissue arising from the iris collarette and crossing the pupil space, or attaching to the cornea or lens.\n\n\u2022 Dot-like opacities on the endothelial surface of the cornea or the anterior capsule of the lens. \u2022 Thin strands of iris tissue crossing the pupil space.\n\nThe pupillary membrane is a mesodermal embryonic structure, which, until regression, forms a solid sheet of tissue bridging the pupil space and the anterior chamber.\n\nThe pupillary membrane arises from the iris collarette.\n\nIn adult cats, the collarette appears as a slightly raised region halfway between the pupil margin and the iris root.\n\nThe pupillary membrane remains as persistent strands of tissue in the anterior segment of the eye, if it fails to rarify in late fetal life.\n\nFibrous strands of iris-like tissue extend from the iris collarette (raised area approximately half way between the iris root and the pupillary margin) to either another region of the collarette, the anterior capsule of the lens, or the posterior corneal surface (most commonly). The strands can be very thin, and magnification may be required to visualize them.\n\nDot-like gray to black opacities may be visible on the endothelial surface of the cornea or the anterior capsule of the lens, and are associated with strands attaching the opacity to the iris. The opacities are unassociated with a history of previous inflammation within the eye.\n\nThe condition is rare in cats compared to the frequency with which it is seen in dogs, and rarely seems to affect the pupillary light reflex or pupil shape.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of the persistent pupillary membranes on careful ocular examination.\n\nThe gray opacities formed by persistent pupillary membranes, which attach to the corneal endothelium should be differentiated from keratic precipitates (KPs), formed as a result of anterior uveitis. A strand of tissue attaching the opacity to the iris, and the absence of other signs of anterior uveitis is diagnostic of a persistent pupillary membrane.\n\nNo treatment is indicated.\n\n\u2022 Wedge-like or radial sectorial defect in the iris.\n\nWedge-like or radial sectorial defect in the iris.\n\nOccurs as a congenital anomaly, but can be first noticed in a cat of any age.\n\nThe defect may enable structures behind the iris, for example the lens equator or lens zonules, to be visualized more readily in the affected sector.\n\nThe condition is quite rare in cats, and should be differentiated from iris atrophy seen in old color-dilute (Himalayan or Siamese) type cats.\n\n\u2022 Progressive vision loss especially in a young Abyssinian cat. \u2022 Slow loss of pupillary light reflexes. \u2022 Fundoscopic signs of tapetal hyperreflectivity and retinal vessel attenuation.\n\nAlthough rare, genetically determined progressive retinal rod-cone degeneration has been described in Abyssinian, Siamese and Persian cats.\n\nThe best-described degeneration occurs in the Abyssinian cat. In this breed, both autosomal dominant rod-cone dysplasia (onset 2-3 months of age), and autosomal recessive rod-cone degeneration (onset 1-2 years of age) modes of inheritance have been described. The disease in Abyssinians is now seen rarely.\n\nTypically there is a history of progressive vision loss.\n\nSlow loss of pupillary light reflexes progresses to dilated pupils non-responsive to light.\n\nOccasionally other signs, such as variable or intermittent nystagmus, are seen, especially in the rod-cone dysplasia in Abyssinian kittens.\n\nIn the adult-onset form, the fundoscopic signs start as a subtle grayish discoloration in the central retina on each side of the optic nerve head. The lesion progresses to a more diffuse gray tapetal discoloration with early retinal vessel attenuation. Later, hyper-reflective areas start to appear within the discolored tapetum. Finally, there is extensive tapetal hyper-reflectivity with severe attenuation of retinal vessels.\n\nIn the early-onset form there is tapetal fundus dullness and loss of detail evident at 8-12 weeks of age. Progression of the disease is fairly rapid, with development of tapetal hyper-reflectivity, loss of pigmentation in the non-tapetum and vessel attenuation. There is end-stage degeneration by 12 months of age.\n\nDiagnosis is based on the history of a slow onset of vision loss, with slow deterioration of the pupillary light reflex and characteristic fundoscopic changes in an Abyssinian cat.\n\nDiagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of progressive reductions in b-wave amplitude on electroretinography.\n\nOther retinal diseases can usually be differentiated by age and breed of the cat, other systemic signs and the fundoscopic changes.\n\n\u2022 Taurine deficiency retinopathy may also produce the signs associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. \u2022 Hypertensive retinopathy is usually sudden in onset in an old cat, and typically there is retinal detachment and associated renal and/or thyroid disease.\n\n\u2022 Feline infectious peritonitis usually causes signs in young cats. Typically systemic signs of anorexia, lethargy and fever are also seen.\n\nThere is no treatment for progressive retinal degeneration. "}
