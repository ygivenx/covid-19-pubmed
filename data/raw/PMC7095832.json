{"title": "New from NPG", "body": "\nDipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC\n\n\nRaj, V.S. et al. Nature 10.1038/nature12005 (14 March).\n\nThe authors identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a functional receptor for the recently identified human coronavirus. They show that antibodies blocking DPP4 prevent infection of susceptible human cells and that expression of DPP4 in nonsusceptible cells can enable infection.\n\n\nATP-competitive inhibitors block protein kinase recruitment to the Hsp90-Cdc37 system\n\n\nPolier, S. et al. Nat. Chem. Biol. 10.1038/nchembio.1212 (17 March).\n\nATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, such as the cancer drugs vemurafenib and lapatinib, can block the access of kinases to HSP90, thus promoting their degradation. This mechanism might be important for the clinical efficacy of these drugs.\n\n\nSeven new loci associated with age-related macular degeneration\n\n\nFritsche, L.G. et al. Nat. Genet. 10.1038/ng.2578 (3 March).\n\nA genome-wide association study, including >17,000 people with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), identifies 19 susceptiblility loci associated with AMD, of which seven were new associations.\n\n\nIntracellular antibody-bound pathogens stimulate immune signaling via the Fc receptor TRIM21\n\n\nMcEvan, W.A. et al. Nat. Immunol. 10.1038/ni.2548 (3 March).\n\nThe authors show that antibodies entering the cytoplasm by binding pathogens are recognized by the cytosolic receptor TRIM21, which can then activate downstream innate immune signaling pathways and elicit an antiviral state.\n\n\nInterplay of LRRK2 with chaperone-mediated autophagy\n\n\nOrenstein, S.J. et al. Nat. Neurosci. 10.1038/nn.3350 (3 March).\n\nMutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease. These authors now show that wild-type LRRK2 can be degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in lysosomes, but degradation of mutant forms is impaired, as the mutants block the formation of the CMA translocation complex at the lysosomal membrane."}
