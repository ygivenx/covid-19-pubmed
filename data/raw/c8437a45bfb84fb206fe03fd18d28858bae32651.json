{"title": "Clinical and Laboratory Profiles of 75 Hospitalized Patients with Novel", "body": "fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory 47 abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), 48 decreased CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and 49 lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed 50 significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts. Besides, the 51 percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. 52 We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological 53 .

Hematological parameters including blood 117 routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation profile, and infection-related biomarkers 118 were recorded. Plasma cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were detected by ELISA. 119 And the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets were counted using flow cytometry. 120 Statistical analysis 121 We presented continuous measurements as median (IQR) and categorical variables 122 as number (%). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. 123 For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the 124 normal range. Graphpad prism 8.3 was used for all analyses. A two-sided \u03b1 of less 125 than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nTotally, 75 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Among 128 them, 61 (81.33%) patients had been to Wuhan or exposed to people who came from diabetes, chronic kidney disease, respiratory system disease, nervous system disease, 135 chronic liver diseases, and malignant tumor (Table 1) .\n\n.

Procalcitonin (PCT) was 168 elevated in 2 out of 59 patients. Forty-nine patients were tested for IL-6, and 14 169 (28.57%) of them showed levels above the normal range (Table 3) CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029785 doi: medRxiv preprint more than 50% patients. The most significant was the decreased CD4 + T cell counts. 194 Previous studies of patients in Wuhan suggested virus invasion could induce a 195 cytokine storm syndrome (CRS) [5, 8] . Of the 14 patients with elevated IL-6, LYM%, 196 CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts were significantly decreased and NEU%, CRP and 197 LDH levels increased significantly. Elevated IL-6 may be an important factor leading 198 to T lymphocytes damage and cellular immune deficiency. IL-6 could also be used as 199 an indicator to evaluate infection severity. Therefore, we conclude that IL-6 may be an Currently, there is no specific therapy for patients with new coronavirus pneumonia. 220 The pathologic mechanisms of disease progression and exacerbation are also unclear. 221 How to relieve the clinical symptoms of critically ill patients, and reduce the severity 222 .
