{"title": "Supplemental Data Heterozygous Mutations in OAS1 Cause Infantile-Onset Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis with Hypogammaglobulinemia SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE CASE REPORT", "body": "We found five individuals (A-II-1, A-II-3, A-II-4, B-II-1, and C-II-1) with infantile-onset pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) with hypogammaglobulinemia from three unrelated families ( Figure S1 and Table 1 ).\n\n[A-II-1], male This male infant was born to non-consanguineous parents ( Figure S1A and Table 1 ).\n\nHis clinical course was reported previously. 1 Briefly, he did not show respiratory problem at birth, but died at 91 days of age following sucking difficulty since 9 days of age, hospitalization with a diagnosis of pneumonia at 39 days of age, and progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation since 55 days of age. Surfactant replacement was not effective for his respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed PAP, but the cause of PAP was unknown.\n\n[A-II-2], male He was healthy ( Figure S1A ).\n\nThis male infant showed no respiratory problems at birth, but was hospitalized for fever, cough, and failure to thrive at 39 days of age with a diagnosis of pneumonia ( Figure   S1A and Table 1 ). A diagnosis of PAP was made after bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examination at 100 days of age following supplemental oxygen requirement since 86 days and mechanical ventilation since 92 days of age. Steroid administration, inhalation of nitric oxide, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were ineffective, and he finally died of respiratory failure at 163 days of age before bone marrow engraftment The clinical course before 5 years of age ( Figure S1A and Table 1 ) was reported previously as GPAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. 2 Briefly, similar to the two elder brothers affected by GPAP, this female infant did not have respiratory symptoms at birth. However, she became febrile (40\u00b0C) unresponsive to antibiotics and had generalized skin rash at 23 days of age. Abnormal chest X-ray and CT findings were first observed at 42 days of age as shown in Figures S2A and S3A , respectively. Her respiratory dysfunction was repeatedly responsive to monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration. She required hospitalization 19 times over 10 years from 1 to 10 years of age for treatment of recurrent infections, mainly by viruses, including pneumonia, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, peritonitis, otitis media, and cystitis.\n\nShe showed excessively strong reaction to each infection. Although IVIG was effective to improve respiratory function and overcome infection, she required home oxygen therapy since 8 years of age ( Figure S3B ). Finally, she died of respiratory failure at 11.3 years of age while awaiting HSCT ( Figure S2C ). Autopsy showed alveoli diffusely occupied with PAS-positive materials and small and non-foamy alveolar macrophages\n\nHer serum levels of SP-A (up to 154 ng/mL), Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) (up to 46190 U/mL), IgM (up to 60 mg/dL), and IgA (up to 57 mg/mL) were elevated at 11 years old. SP-D level was consistently within the normal range during the course. The serum IgG level showed a trough of 102 mg/dL at 102 days of age, and WBC count was consistently high, ranging from 10000 to 86000 /\u00b5L throughout her clinical course. Splenomegaly and proteinuria were observed before monthly IVIG but disappeared after initiation of this therapy. BAL fluid ( Figure S4A The clinical course of this female infant was reported previously. 3 Briefly, she was born with no respiratory symptoms, but was hospitalized due to vesicles on the face, buttocks, and extremities at 29 days of age ( Figure S1B and Table 1 ). Leukocytosis and low serum levels of IgG (101 mg/dL), IgM (3 mg/dL), and IgA (2 mg/dL) were observed on admission. She then presented with tachypnea without cough at 2 months of age.\n\nConfluent consolidations were seen in both lungs on chest CT at the age of 4 months ( Figure S3C ). The findings of BAL fluid were consistent with the diagnosis of PAP ( Figure S4C ). As AM dysfunction was considered, HSCT with cord blood was performed at 8 months of age. 3 Respiratory function improved markedly 21 days after myeloid engraftment followed by no dense consolidations on chest CT 2 months after HSCT ( Figure S3D ). Although she had no recurrence of respiratory dysfunction, she was complicated by reactivated cytomegalovirus infection and finally died from renal failure with histological findings of focal glomerulosclerosis at 3 years of age.\n\n[C-II-1], female\n\nThe clinical course of this female infant was also reported previously. 3 Briefly, she was born with no respiratory symptoms, but was hospitalized at 5 months of age for pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) requiring mechanical ventilation for 10 days ( Figure S1C and Table 1 ). In addition, she suffered from cytomegalovirus and subsequently coronavirus NL63 infection. She showed low serum levels of IgG (103 mg/dL), IgM (11 mg/dL), and IgA (3 mg/dL). Although sequential IVIG and subcutaneous immunoglobulin appeared to be effective, she had persistent respiratory symptoms and progressive consolidation on chest X-ray and CT ( Figures   S2D and S3E ). Anti-GM-CSF antibody was not detected in the serum. BAL fluid at 8 months of age contained PAS-positive acidophilic material ( Figure S4D "}
