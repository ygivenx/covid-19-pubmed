{"title": "Molecular biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus", "body": "The worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses and their closest relatives possess extremely large plus-strand RNA genomes and employ unique mechanisms and enzymes in RNA synthesis that separate them from all other RNA viruses. The SARS epidemic prompted a variety of studies on multiple aspects of the coronavirus replication cycle, yielding both rapid identification of the entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV into host cells and valuable structural and functional information on SARS-CoV proteins. These recent advances in coronavirus research have important implications for the development of anti-SARS drugs and vaccines.\n\nIn November 2002, an atypical pneumonia, characterized by progressive respiratory failure and death in approximately 10% of cases, emerged in Guangdong Province, Southern China [1 , 2, 3] . Carlo Urbani, a WHO specialist in infectious diseases, was the first to recognize that this disease was unusual and that it represented a major threat to public health. Together with the Vietnamese authorities and WHO, he immediately introduced effective infection control measures that eventually stopped the further spread of the disease in Vietnam. Sadly, he would not survive to see this success. He contracted the disease and died as a result on March 29, 2003 . The disease was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV, was rapidly identified as the etiological agent [4] [5] [6] 7 ] . The rapid spread of the disease to neighboring regions and other countries prompted the WHO to issue a global alert on March 13, 2003 . By the end of the epidemic, in July 2003, more than 8400 SARS cases and around 800 deaths due to SARS had been recorded worldwide. SARS-CoV is only distantly related to other human coronaviruses, such as 229E (coronavirus group 1) and OC43 (coronavirus group 2), which are known to cause the common cold and, in only a few cases, are associated with lower respiratory tract illness and diarrhea [8] . There is a large body of seroepidemiological data suggesting that SARS-CoV had not previously been endemic in humans [6, 7 ] . Conversely, there is some initial evidence that at least a small proportion of healthy people in Hong Kong may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-related viruses up to two years before the SARS outbreak [9] . It is generally believed that SARS-CoV evolved from an animal coronavirus that recently crossed the species barrier. This hypothesis is supported by data published by Guan and co-workers [10 ] , who isolated SARS-CoV-like viruses from Himalayan palm civets and a raccoon dog that were sold on a life-animal market in Guangdong, China. Significantly, an increased seroprevalence of SARS-CoV was observed in people trading with these animals. The potential for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV is also illustrated by the fact that a whole range of animals, including cats, ferrets, mice and macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV [4, 11, 12] . The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV in nature remains to be identified.\n\nCoronaviruses are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses that feature the largest RNA genomes currently known. In terms of genome structure and expression, the Coronaviridae (genera Coronavirus and Torovirus) and their distant relatives from the Arteriviridae and Roniviridae families, which together form the virus order Nidovirales, differ significantly from other positive-strand RNA viruses. In this review, current understanding of the crucial steps of the SARS-CoV life cycle will be summarized, focusing on genome organization, gene expression and enzymes that are involved in genome replication and discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs.\n\nThe SARS-CoV genome encompasses 29 727 nucleotides [excluding the 3 0 poly(A) tail], of which 265 and 342 nucleotides, respectively, are located in the 5 0 and 3 0nontranslated regions (Figure 1 ) [13, 14] . The genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) (Figure 1) [15 ]. Two large, 5 0 -terminal ORFs, 1a and 1b, constitute the replicase gene, which encodes the proteins that are required for viral RNA synthesis (and probably has other functions). The remaining twelve ORFs encode the four structural proteins, S, M, N and E, and eight accessory proteins that are not likely to be essential in tissue culture but may provide a selective advantage in the infected host. On the basis of unrooted phylogenetic trees, SARS-CoV was initially proposed to represent a new group ('group 4') within the genus Coronavirus [13, 14] ; however, rooted trees using torovirus and arterivirus sequences as outgroups convincingly placed SARS-CoV as a sister-lineage to the group 2 coronaviruses [16 ,17].\n\nEntry of coronaviruses into target cells is initiated by binding of the viral S protein to receptor molecules. The S protein forms typical petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion. It is heavily glycosylated and consists of three domains, the external N-terminal domain with its conserved S1 and S2 subdomains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminus. The cellular receptor of several group 1 coronaviruses is aminopeptidase N, a zinc metalloprotease [18] , whereas mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (group 2) uses carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules as a cellular receptor [19] . Recently, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was demonstrated to be a functional cellular receptor of SARS-CoV [20 ] . The minimal binding domain of the SARS-CoV S protein was delimited to the S1 residues 318-510 [21] and antibodies specific for the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV S protein were shown to neutralize SARS-CoV infection [22 ] .\n\nFollowing S protein-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane (see Update) and release of the viral genome RNA into the cytoplasm of the infected cell [23] , SARS-CoV genome expression begins with the (cap-dependent) translation of the genomic RNA (mRNA 1; Figure 1 ). The translation product that is encoded by ORF1a is a protein of 4382 amino acid residues and is called polyprotein 1a (pp1a). Due to ribosomal Molecular biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Ziebuhr 413 Each of the sg mRNAs carries a 72-nucleotide, 5 0 -terminal leader sequence that is derived from the 5 0 -end of the genome [15 ] . The leader sequence is acquired by a unique mechanism that involves discontinuous synthesis of sg minus strands and is dependent on cis-active RNA elements, known as 'transcription-regulating sequences' (TRSs) [26, 27] . The TRSs of SARS-CoV have a common core sequence, ACGAAC [15 ] , that, by complementary base-pairing, assists in the transfer of the nascent minus strand to the TRS (leader TRS), located downstream of the 5 0 -leader sequence on the genomic RNA [26] . Besides complementary base-pairing, the transfer of the nascent minus strand to the 5 0 -leader TRS is thought to involve protein-protein interactions that keep the 5 0 -end of the genome in close proximity to the site of ongoing minusstrand synthesis. The current model of coronavirus sg RNA synthesis further suggests that, if the minus strand polymerase encounters attenuation signals that cause it to stall, the genome's 5 0 -end would provide an alternative template, allowing minus-strand synthesis to be continued and completed [27] . The resulting antileader-containing minus-strand RNAs are subsequently used as templates for (continuous) \n\nThe production of a complex and diverse set of RNA molecules by SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses (and nidoviruses) is linked to an unparalleled complexity of the replicative polyproteins, which are anchored to intracellular membranes and contain a variety of enzymatic activities [16 ,28] . Coronaviruses control the activities of their replicative proteins by co-and post-translational processing of the nonstructural polyproteins [24] and ribosomal frameshifting [29] -thus ensuring a specific molar ratio between ORF1a-and ORF1b-encoded proteins. Generally, coronaviruses employ two papain-like proteases, PL1 pro and PL2 pro , to process the N-proximal regions of the replicative polyproteins at three sites. By contrast, SARS-CoV encodes only one papain-like protease, the activity of which has been established recently [15 ] . The SARS-CoV enzyme is a PL2 pro orthologue, which, in contrast to most other coronavirus papain-like proteases, features a narrow substrate specificity. This might improve the potential for identifying selective inhibitors [15 ] . In common with other coronavirus papain-like proteases [30] , the SARS-CoV PL2 pro contains a putative Zn-finger structure, connecting the a-and b-domains of a papain-like fold. Based on HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E) and EAV (equine arteritis virus) data, the Zn-finger is predicted to be required for the proteolytic activity of PL2 pro and may have distinct functions in coronavirus sg RNA synthesis [30, 31] .\n\nThe central and C-terminal regions of the replicative polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, are cleaved by a chymotrypsin-like protease that, because of its distant relationship with the 3C proteases of picornaviruses, is named 3C-like protease, 3CL pro [24] . The 3CL pro plays a pivotal role in coronavirus polyprotein processing and also releases the key replicative functions of the virus, such as RdRp and helicase; therefore, it is also called the coronavirus main protease, M pro [24, 28] . Both in terms of function and structure, it represents the best-characterized coronavirus enzyme to date. In common with the 3CL pro s of group 1 coronaviruses [25 ,32-34] , the SARS-CoV 3CL pro employs a catalytic Cys-His dyad and has a three-domain structure, in which the N-terminal, chymotrypsin-like two-b-barrel fold (domains I and II) is connected by a 16-residue loop to the C-terminal domain III, consisting of five a-helices [25 ,35 ] . Biochemical data, as well as crystal structure information and NMR data, consistently implicate the 16-residue loop in substratebinding [25 ,34,35 ,36] . In the polyprotein, the 3CL pro is flanked by hydrophobic, probably membrane-spanning domains. At present, it is not clear whether the 3CL pro cleaves itself in cis or trans from the replicase polyprotein precursor; however, once released, the trans-cleavage activity seems to depend on 3CL pro dimerization that mainly involves the enzyme's N-terminus, domain II and, in particular, the a-helical domain III [25 ,35 ,36,37] . Several intermolecular and intramolecular interactions appear to be tailor-made to keep the enzyme in a conformation that is capable of cleaving substrates in trans and preventing self-inactivation by backfolding of the chain termini. Despite conservation of the P4, P2, P1, and P1 0 positions among coronavirus 3CL pro substrates, there is preliminary evidence to suggest a significant structural flexibility for the SARS-CoV 3CL pro active site, which may even lead to differential binding modes of specific peptidyl inhibitors to group 1 [(porcine) transmissible gastroenteritis virus; TGEV] versus group 2 (SARS-CoV) coronavirus 3CL pro s [25 ,35 ] . Both the flexibility of the active site and the data from another study, which recently suggested that the P 0 residues (despite little conservation) also contribute significantly to the substrate-binding by SARS-CoV 3CL pro , might have important implications for the design of protease inhibitors [36] .\n\nDue to its pivotal role in viral RNA synthesis, the~106-kDa SARS-CoV RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; nsp12) represents an attractive target for anti-SARS therapy. However, there is a lack of structural and biochemical information on any coronavirus RdRp and structural predictions are complicated by the fact that the coronavirus RdRps are significantly diverged from cellular and viral RNA polymerases. Recently, a structure model was built for the catalytic domain of the SARS-CoV RdRp [39 ] . The model provides first insights into the active site of the protein and also enables conclusions to be drawn about the properties of potential nucleoside analog inhibitors of coronavirus RdRps. Thus, it was proposed that potential nucleoside analog inhibitors should contain groups at their 2 0 and 3 0 positions that are capable of making hydrogen-bonding interactions with RdRp residues 623 and 691. Furthermore, to avoid steric conflicts in the binding to the 2 0 and 3 0 positions, the potential nucleoside inhibitors should possess the C3 0 endo sugar puckering conformation. Clearly, direct structural information is highly desirable for the development of effective inhibitors of this key enzyme.\n\nThe SARS-CoV superfamily 1 helicase resides in nsp13. The enzyme's catalytic domain is linked at its N-terminus to a complex zinc-binding domain ( Figure 2 ) [16 ,40] . Data obtained for an arterivirus homolog indicate that coronavirus helicases might have distinct functions in replication and transcription and, possibly, even in virion biogenesis [41] . The SARS-CoV helicase is a multifunctional protein. It has been shown to have: (i) single-stranded and double-stranded RNA and DNA binding activities; (ii) nucleic acid-stimulated NTPase and dNTPase activities; (iii) RNA and DNA duplexunwinding activities and; (iv) RNA 5 0 -triphosphatase activity [42, 43] (which is proposed to mediate the first step of 5 0 -cap synthesis on coronavirus RNAs). The coronavirus helicase acts processively in a 5 0 -to-3 0 direction on partial-duplex RNA and DNA substrates and, consistent with its presumed replicative function, is capable of unwinding long stretches of double-stranded nucleic acids [42, 44, 45] . The 5 0 -to-3 0 polarity of nidovirus Molecular biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Ziebuhr 415 Overview of the domain organization and proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). The processing end-products of pp1a are designated nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to nsp11 and those of pp1ab are designated nsp1 to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16. Cleavage sites that are predicted to be processed by the viral main protease, 3CL pro , are indicated by grey arrowheads, and sites that are processed by the papain-like protease, PL2 pro , are indicated by black arrowheads. For further details on SARS-CoV replicative proteins, see Table 1 .

These include a 3 0 -to-5 0 exonuclease (ExoN), a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent 2 0 -Oribose methyltransferase (2 0 -O-MT), an ADP-ribose 1 00phosphatase (ADRP) [47] , and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD). Four of the activities are conserved in all coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, supporting their essential role in the coronaviral life cycle [16 ] . The fact that ExoN (nsp14), NendoU (nsp15) and 2 0 -O-MT (nsp16) are arranged in pp1ab as a single protein block downstream of the RdRp and helicase domains ( Figure 2 ) suggests a cooperation of these activities in the same metabolic pathway. As an initial clue to the potential functions of the nsp14-nsp16 proteins, an interesting parallel to cellular RNA processing pathways was noted by Snijder and co-workers [16 ] . Thus, cellular homologs of coronavirus nsp14-16 cleave mRNAs to produce small nucleolar RNAs that guide specific 2 0 -O-ribose methylations on ribosomal RNA [48, 49] . The activities of the predicted coronavirus enzymes and their viral and/or cellular substrates remain to be established. ADRP and CPD, this being conserved only in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, excluding SARS-CoV, were also proposed to cooperate in a common (but currently unknown) pathway. This hypothesis is based on the fact that cellular homologs of CPD and ADRP mediate two consecutive steps in the downstream processing of ADP-ribose 1 00 ,2 00 cyclic phosphate (Appr>p), a side product of tRNA splicing [50] .\n\nGiven that coronaviruses and arteriviruses are generally believed to use very similar replication and transcription strategies, it is intriguing that, out of the four activities that are conserved in all coronaviruses (ExoN, NendoU, 2 0 -O-MT and ADRP), only one activity (NendoU) is conserved in arteriviruses [16 ]. The differential conservation pattern of RNA processing activities among the nidovirus families and genera suggests a functional hierarchy for these enzymes, with NendoU playing a major role. It might also reflect subtle differences in the RNA synthesis mechanisms used by various nidovirus families and/or differential interactions of nidovirus nonstructural proteins with host cell functions. Alternatively, the extra functions that are encoded by coronaviruses and toroviruses (and, to a lesser extent, roniviruses) might be required to replicate the extremely large (~30 kb) RNA genomes of these viruses. Thus, the predicted 3 0 -to-5 0 exonuclease, ExoN, has been speculated to be involved in recombination or repair mechanisms that may be required for the life cycle of corona-, toro-, and roniviruses but may be dispensable for the much smaller arteriviruses [16 ] .\n\nThe SARS outbreak has inspired a myriad of studies into virtually every aspect of SARS-CoV biology, including viral pathogenesis, tissue tropism, genome structure, 416 Host-microbe interactions: viruses Table 1 The replicase gene products of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\n\nPosition in polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab a , respectively expression and replication, as well as SARS-CoV structural and nonstructural proteins. Within a remarkably short period of time, these studies have produced a wealth of functional and structural information that might be used for the development of SARS-CoV-specific drugs, as well as vaccines. Already, initial candidate vaccines are currently being tested [51, 52] , crystal structures of SARS-CoV proteins have been determined [35 ,53,54] , a fulllength infectious clone has been constructed, allowing reverse genetics with SARS-CoV [55] , a functional receptor of the virus has been identified [20 ] , and both interferons [56, 57, 58 ] and antibodies [11, 22 ] have been successfully used to block SARS-CoV infections in model systems. The rapidly increasing information on SARS and its etiological agent, together with sensitive diagnostic tests and improved surveillance by public health authorities, should provide a good basis for the control of SARS-CoV infections, should the virus be reintroduced into the human population in the future.\n\nRecent work has demonstrated that the heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2, present in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV S protein, assemble into an antiparallel six-helix bundle, consisting of HR1 as a central triplestranded coiled-coil structure and three HR2 a-helices [59 ,60 ,61] . Analogous to other type-1 fusion glycoproteins, the formation of the six-helix bundle has been suggested to contribute to a conformational change that occurs in the S protein, following receptor binding, to form a fusion-active core that brings the viral and host cell membranes into close proximity, leading to the fusion between these membranes. Importantly, peptides derived from the HR2 sequence were shown to block SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells, suggesting a potential approach to the development of drugs for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infections [59 ,60 ] . This paper provides the most exhaustive analysis of the SARS-CoV genome that has been published to date. It predicts as many as five novel coronavirus RNA processing activities. Four of the enzymes, including two ribonucleases, are conserved in SARS-CoV. The paper provides an important theoretical basis for future studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus (nidovirus) RNA synthesis that, in several aspects, differs from that of other RNA viruses.
