{"title": "Pediatric Infections", "body": "Improvement in anaerobic microbiologic techniques has resulted in an increase in the isolation and identification of anaerobic organisms from a variety of infectious sites in children. The recent isolation of these organisms from children has led to increased appreciation of their role in pediatric infections. In general, the types of anaerobic infections and the infecting flora are similar to those seen in adults. H o w e v e r , the incidence of these infections varies because of the difference in predisposing conditions. While adults suffer more from ischemic and obstructive diseases, children tend to have more infections of the upper respiratory tract. Sites of anaerobic infections in children are the central nervous system (CNS), oral cavity, head and neck, chest, abdomen, skin, and soft tissue (1) . Anaerobic infections tend to result in the formation of abscess, as evidenced by infections such as brain, tonsillar, lung, intraabdominal, and cutaneous abscesses.\n\nAnaerobic bacteria colonize the newborn immediately after delivery. The bacteria have been recovered from such neonatal infections as cellulitis of the site of fetal monitoring, neonatal aspiration pneumonia, bacteremia, conjunctivitis, omphalitis, and infant botulism (1) .\n\nThe fact that similar infections (such as pleuropulmonary or intraabdominal infections) in both adults and children have similar causative pathogens is no surprise. H o w e v e r , certain infections either are unique or are more frequently encountered in children. These infections include neonatal infections, acute and chronic otitis media, mastoiditis, peritonsillar and tonsillar infections, cervical lymphadenitis, periorbital infections, and paronychia. In many instances, the frequency of isolation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is unique among this age group.\n\nThis chapter presents the role of anaerobic bacteria in children. Since the infections mentioned above (except neonatal) are discussed at length in other chapters, these topics will be mentioned only briefly here, with particular reference to the typical features of these illnesses in childhood. Neonatal infections, which of course are unique to the pediatric group, will be discussed in detail.\n\nThe incidence of infection in the fetus and the newborn infant is high. As many as 2 % of fetuses are infected in utero, and up to 10% of infants are infected during delivery or in the first few months of life. Although the incidence of infections caused by anaerobes is small, the conditions predisposing to these infections are similar to those associated with other organisms.\n\nSeveral factors have been associated with the acquisition of local or systemic infection in the newborn: premature and prolonged rupture of membranes (longer than 24 hr), maternal peripartum infection, premature delivery, low birth weight, depressed respiratory function of the infant at birth or fetal anoxia, and septic or traumatic delivery. The acquisition of infection while the newborn passes through the birth canal is the most frequent m o d e of transfer.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus is shielded from the flora of the mother's genital tract, although potentially pathogenic bacteria are found in the amniotic fluid. Inhibitory activity of the amniotic fluid restricts the growth of many bacteria (2) , especially during the third trimester. H o w e v e r , colonization of the amniotic fluid occurs in labor with intact membranes (3) . Increased perinatal morbidity was shown to be associated with intraamniotic bacterial colonization with anaerobes (4) . The relative sparsity of the Bacteroides fragilis population in the cervix at term labor and the added inhibitory effect of the amniotic fluid against this organism (2) at term may explain the relatively low incidence of B. fragilis infections at full term, compared to postabortal sepsis (5) .\n\nFollowing rupture of the m e m b r a n e s , colonization of the newborn is initiated, and is continued by further exposure to the cervical flora during the infant's passage through the birth canal (6) . Potentially pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be found in the gastric contents of infants, which the baby acquires while passing through the birth canal (6) . W h e n premature rupture of the m e m b r a n e s occurs, the ascending flora can cause infection of the amniotic fluid with involvement of the fetal m e m b r a n e s , placenta, and umbilical cord (7) . Aspiration of the infected amniotic fluid can cause aspiration pneumonia. Since anaerobic bacteria are the predominant organisms in the m o t h e r ' s genital flora (6), they b e c o m e major pathogens in infections that follow early exposure of the newborn to that flora.\n\nThe immaturity of the immunologic system, which is manifested by decreased function of the phagocytes and decreased inflammatory reactions, may contribute to the susceptibility of infants to microbial infections (8) . The presence of anoxia and acidosis in the newborn may also interfere with the defense mechanisms.\n\nThe support systems and procedures used in nurseries and intensive care units can contribute to the acquisition of infections. Offending instruments include umbilical catheters, arterial lines, and intubation devices. Contamination of equipment (such as humidifiers), contamination of supplies (such as intravenous solutions and infant formulas), and poor isolation techniques can result in outbreaks of bacterial or viral infections. Such spread is thought to contribute to the clustering of cases of necrotizing enterocolitis in n e w b o r n s . (9) .\n\nRecent work also has implicated Clostridia and peptostreptococci as probable causes of neonatal conjunctivitis (10) . N e w b o r n conjunctival cultures were obtained from 35 babies before the application of silver nitrate and then 48 hr later. On initial culture, 46 facultative bacteria and 27 anaerobes were recovered. The organisms isolated in almost all of these cases were present also in the m o t h e r ' s cervical cultures and in the b a b y ' s gastric aspirates, taken concomitantly. Most of those organisms disappeared from the conjunctiva within 48 hr.\n\nH o w e v e r , clostridial species were recovered from two infants who developed conjunctivitis on the second and third day postdelivery (10) . Clostridium perfringens was recovered from one newborn, and Clostridium bifermentans with Peptostreptococcus spp. were recovered from the other. Similar organisms were recovered from the cervix of each mother immediately after delivery. In both infants, a profuse y e l l o wgreen discharge was noted in each eye. The conjunctivae were injected, and the examination revealed edematous eyelids, normal light reflex and pupillary reaction, and normal fundi. Local therapy with 2% penicillin eye drops for 5 days resulted in complete cure.\n\nSince anaerobic bacteria have been recovered recently from children (11) and adults (12) suffering from bacterial conjunctivitis, the presence of these bacteria in neonatal conjunctivitis is not surprising. Although these organisms are not the most prevalent cause of inflammation of the eye in the neonatal age group, their presence should be suspected in children whose aerobic and chlamydial cultures are negative, in those who do not respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and in newborns at high risk of developing anaerobic infection.\n\nThe umbilical stump becomes colonized with bacteria soon after delivery (13) . The devitalized umbilical stump is an excellent medium that supports bacterial growth, and the umbilical vessels provide direct access to the bloodstream. The colonizing bacteria may invade the wound and spread through the blood vessels or the connective tissues to cause phlebitis or arteritis, and travel from there into the peritoneum or by emboli to various organs (14) . Although infection of the cord stump is rare, its potential sequelae (such as cellulitis, peritonitis, septicemia, multiple hepatic abscesses, and portal vein thrombosis) may prove fatal.\n\nOmphalitis manifests itself by drainage from the umbilical stump or from its base at its point of attachment to the abdominal wall or from the navel after the cord has separated. Secretions may be thin and serous, sanguineous, or frankly purulent, and at times they are foul smelling. Infection may remain restricted to the cord or may spread to the surrounding skin.\n\nIn studies that did not use techniques to identify anaerobes, the predominant isolates have been Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. A recent study of 23 newborns with omphalitis demonstrated the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic etiology of neonatal omphalitis (14) . Anaerobes were recovered from 39% of the patients. They included the Bacteroides fragilis group, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Clostridium perfringens. Maternal amnionitis caused by B. fragilis developed in three of the mothers whose newborns had omphalitis caused by these organisms.\n\nAlthough anaerobic bacteria were reported as colonizers of noninfected ligated or nonligated umbilical cords (15) , only a few reports described their isolation from cases of omphalitis (16) . The anaerobes recovered in these cases were Fusobacterium, Clostridium tertium, C. perfringens, and Clostridium sordellii. Neonatal tetanus caused by Clostridium tetani usually results from contamination of the umbilical cord during improperly managed deliveries outside a medical facility. The disease is now rare in the United States (17); but it is still one of the most common causes of neonatal death in developing countries.\n\nThe recovery of anaerobes from umbilical infection is not surprising since, during vaginal delivery, the neonate is exposed to the cervical canal flora, including anaerobic bacteria (6) .\n\nWithout evidence of spread, simple omphalitis responds readily to the local application of alcohol and drying of the infected area. Sometimes antibiotic compresses or ointments are applied. Bacitracin and neomycin, or a combination of these, are the local antibiotics of choice. Systemic antibiotic medication is indicated if the discharge is purulent or if any evidence of periumbilical spread appears. Such spread can cause generalized sepsis and metastatic infection. The final choice of antibiotic will depend on culture and sensitivity tests.\n\nIt is r e c o m m e n d e d that specimens from umbilical infection be routinely cultured for anaerobic organisms. Antimicrobial therapy effective against anaerobes should be considered. This is especially important in infants w h o are at high risk for developing anaerobic infection, such as those w h o have a foul-smelling secretion from the amniotic cord stump or those whose mothers had amnionitis.\n\nPneumonia caused by anaerobes in the newborn can be classified according to the m o d e of acquiring the infection and the time when the infection began. The infection can be acquired in utero by the transplacental route or following intrauterine infection. The pneumonia can be acquired during delivery by inhaling the bacteria that colonize the birth canal. The type of infection contracted after birth is influenced by environmental factors (e.g., a tracheostomy tube) or by human contact.\n\nAnaerobic pneumonias tend to occur in association with aspiration, tissue anoxia, and trauma (16) . Such circumstances usually are present in high-risk n e w b o r n s , which make them more vulnerable to anaerobic pneumonia, especially in the presence of maternal amnionitis. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia usually has been achieved by cultures of tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, needle aspirates of the lungs, and blood cultures.\n\nAlthough the role of anaerobes as a cause of pulmonary infection in adults is well established (18) , only two reports (19, 20) describe the isolation of anaerobic organisms, namely B. fragilis, from children with perinatal pneumonia.\n\nH a r r o d and Stevens (19) described two newborns who presented with neonatal aspiration pneumonia that developed following maternal amnionitis. Bacteroides fragilis was recovered from the blood of these children. Brook et al. (20) reported three newborns with neonatal pneumonia caused by organisms belonging to members of the B. fragilis group. The mothers of all three infants had premature rupture of their m e m b r a n e s and subsequent amnionitis. Organisms identical to those recovered from the newborns were recovered from the amniotic fluid of two of the m o t h e r s .\n\nIsolation of the offending organisms should be performed using methods that bypass the oral flora, such as direct lung aspiration.\n\nAntimicrobial therapy of anaerobic pneumonia should use agents effective against the \u00df-lactamase-producing Bacteroides spp. These include agents such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole or the combination of a penicillin plus a /3-lactamase inhibitor.\n\nScalp electrodes are used frequently to monitor the fetal heart beat, thus providing useful data for maternal obstetric management and the reduction of risk to the infant. A number of fetal complications related to application of the scalp electrodes have been observed, including minor ecchymoses and superficial lacerations, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, osteomyelitis of the skull, sepsis, and scalp abscesses (21).\n\nSeveral factors have been associated with predisposition to scalp infection, including duration of the monitoring and ruptured m e m b r a n e s , presence of high-risk indications for monitoring, and presence of amnionitis (22) . Introduction of the electrode into the scalp can permit the vaginal flora to enter the subcutaneous tissues. The electrode is a nidus for infection, and the longer it is in place, the greater the risk of infection.\n\nThe higher infection rate among high-risk infants suggests that these fetuses may be somewhat compromised and therefore are more susceptible to infection. Infants born after normal pregnancies and monitored electively are at lower risk for developing scalp infections (22).\n\nThe rate of scalp infection associated with fetal heart monitoring was estimated to be between 0.4 and 5.2%, and was not found to be related to the type of scalp electrode used (22) . Osteomyelitis and bacteremia occasionally have been reported (22, 23) .\n\nSeveral case reports describe the recovery of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and groups A and \u0392 streptococci from scalp abscesses (21) .\n\nOkada et al. (22) studied 42 infants with scalp abscess following fetal monitoring. Anaerobic microorganisms mixed with aerobes were recovered in 5 8 % of the children, aerobes alone in 3 3 % , and anaerobes alone in 9%. The most c o m m o n anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp. Bacteroides fragilis was also recovered in a case with scalp abscess, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia (23).\n\nA local lesion generally develops within 2 to 3 days after delivery. The lesion usually is localized around the area where the electrode was installed. Sometimes the abscess drains spontaneously, and in some cases osteomyelitis of the occipital bone develops. If a cephalhematoma is present, it also can b e c o m e infected. As the infection progresses, the skin can b e c o m e necrotic and slough. The infection can extend and cause meningitis and ventriculitis, or spread systemically in the form of sepsis (23).\n\nAspiration of the purulent fluid followed by inoculation of the aspirate into adequate aerobic and anaerobic cultures is essential. Blood cultures and cultures of other sites should be performed when indicated.\n\nLocal management of the abscess may require aspiration or leaving a drain in place. F o r patients whose skin has sloughed or become necrotic, extensive debridement may be required, with subsequent covering of the wound site by skin graft. F o r patients whose abscess is large or in w h o m an extension of the infection is suspected, parenteral antimicrobial therapy should be started. The choice of the antimicrobial agents depends on the bacteria isolated. W h e n N. gonorrhoeae is recovered, penicillin therapy is adequate, but when aerobic gram-negative enteric organisms are recovered, aminoglycosides should be administered. Usually penicillin is adequate for the treatment of most anaerobic organisms, except for the /3-lactamase-producing Bacteroides spp. Since these organisms frequently were recovered from the infected sites, appropriate coverage with agents active also against these organisms should be used.\n\nCaution should be used in selecting the infants for the procedure. Intrauterine fetal monitoring should be avoided in infants whose mothers are known to be infected with N. gonorrhoeae or who have amnionitis; however, when I F M is essential, the infants should be watched carefully for the development of such a complication.\n\nAtresia of the extrahepatic bile ducts is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Kasai et al. (24) devised a procedure, hepatic portoenterostomy, that may improve this outlook. Infection of the biliary tract is a frequent complication after this procedure. Anaerobic, as well as aerobic, bacteria are implicated in these infections.\n\nHitch and Lilly (25) obtained 283 cultures from 19 patients, and recovered aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from the bilioenteric conduits within the first postoperative month and during episodes of cholangitis. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, group D streptococci, Pseudomonas species, Proteus species, and Enterobacter species were the predominant aerobic isolates. Bacteroides species, including B. fragilis, were recovered in 1 1 % of the cultures.\n\nBrook and Altman (26) recovered anaerobes from three of six children with cholangitis after hepatic portoenterostomy (Kasai's procedure). These included two isolates of B. fragilis and one isolate of C. perfringens.\n\nThe anaerobes recovered in children with ascending cholangitis are part of the normal gastrointestinal flora in infants. The initial sterile meconium becomes colonized within 24 hr with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, predominantly micrococci, E. coli, Clostridium species, B. fragilis, and streptococci (27) . The isolation rate of B. fragilis and other anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of term babies approaches that of adults within 1 w e e k (27) .\n\nAlthough the n u m b e r of infants studied is small, the data suggest that anaerobes play a major role in cholangitis after Kasai's procedure, and that specimens obtained from these patients should be cultured routinely for anaerobic as well as aerobic bacteria. The route by which both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria reach the bile ducts in patients who have undergone K a s a i ' s p r o c e d u r e is probably an ascending one from the gastrointestinal tract. This mode of spread is favored by the surgical procedure that approximates a part of the jejunum to the bile system, by the lack of the normal choledochal sphincter action, and by the stasis that can develop after the surgery. Other mechanisms of development of cholangitis are transhepatic filtration of bacteria from the portal venous blood into the cholangiole and periportal lymphatic infection.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the true incidence of neonatal anaerobic bacteremia because anaerobic blood cultures were not used in the major series of neonatal sepsis. The incidence of anaerobic bacteremia in newborns varied between 1 and 18 cases per 1000 live births (28, 29) ; anaerobes account for up to 26% of all instances of neonatal bacteremia (29) .\n\nA total of 126 cases of anaerobic neonatal bacteremia have been reported in the literature (30) . The predominant organisms were Bacteroides spp. (53 cases). Among these, B. fragilis was predominant. The other organisms w e r e Clostridium spp. (33 instances), anaerobic grampositive cocci (32 cases), Propionibacterium acnes (4 cases), Veillonella spp. (3 cases), and Fusobacterium spp. (1 case). Multiple organisms, aerobic and anaerobic, were isolated from eight patients reported in one study (29) . Simultaneous isolation of the anaerobes from other sites was reported by several authors (29, 30) . This was especially c o m m o n with B. fragilis. Predisposing and associated infections w e r e noted by various investigators. Brook et al. (31) reported the recovery of B. fragilis from lung aspirates of two patients with pneumonitis, H a r r o d and Stevens (19) recovered B. fragilis from the inflamed placenta, and Dysant and associates (32) and Brook et al. (20) recovered B. fragilis from the cerebrospinal fluid of one patient each with meningitis. Brook (23) recovered B. fragilis from an occipital abscess that developed after neonatal monitoring with scalp electrodes. Ahonkhai and colleagues (33) reported the concomitant isolation of C. perfringens from the placenta of a newborn.\n\nThe diagnosis of septicemia can be made only by recovery of the organism from blood cultures. Blood should be obtained from a peripheral vein rather than from the umbilical vessels, which frequently are colonized by bacteria. Femoral vein aspiration may result in cultures contaminated with organisms from the perineum such as Bacteroides spp. and coliforms. In many cases, organisms identical to those found in the n e w b o r n ' s blood can be recovered from the m o t h e r ' s blood or amniotic fluid. The examination of gastric aspirates generally is not helpful in the prediction of anaerobic bacteria that were ingested during delivery (6) . Examination of the gastric aspirate for white blood cells may reveal the presence of maternal amnionitis.\n\nThe factors predisposing to anaerobic bacteremia were found to be similar to those for aerobic bacteremia. Prematurity was reported in about one-third of the newborns with anaerobic bacteremia, and the male-tofemale ration was 1.6: 1. Several investigators (28, 29) had demonstrated a relationship between premature rupture of fetal membranes, foul-smelling amniotic fluid, and neonatal bacteremia. Prolonged rupture of fetal m e m b r a n e s often is associated with amnionitis, and it is generally accepted that an important pathway for fetal infection is the ascending route through the m e m b r a n e s from the cervix.\n\nOf interest is the correlation between certain predisposing conditions and some bacterial isolates. Neonatal pneumonia and abscesses were reported in association with the recovery of B. fragilis and necrotizing enterocolitis with the recovery of Clostridia (34) (35) (36) .\n\nThe clinical manifestations of neonatal anaerobic bacteremia are not different from those seen in aerobic bacteremia (29) . Over half of the infants had evidence of fetal distress, and three-fourths had a low Apgar score. A positive correlation between the presence of foul-smelling discharge at birth and bacteremia caused by Bacteroides spp. was noted (29) . About two-thirds of the infants may manifest respiratory distress, with tachypnea a n d / o r cyanosis shortly after birth. Chest films may reveal pneumonitis, indicating prenatal aspiration of infected amniotic fluid and subsequent development of pneumonia.\n\nOther clinical manifestations are nonspecific, and include poor sucking and feeding activity, lethargy, hypotonia, irritability, and tonic-clonic seizures.\n\nMortality depends on such factors as age of the patient, underlying disease, nature of the infecting organism, speed of diagnosis, and type of surgical or medical therapy. The overall mortality from anaerobic bacteremia in the 126 patients reported in the literature is 18.3% (30) . The highest mortality occurred in Bacteroides infections (36%), while the mortality from other organisms was generally below 10%.\n\nSpontaneous recovery from anaerobic bacteremia has been reported (29, 37) , but most reports state the need to adequately treat such patients (31) and also describe infants w h o were inappropriately treated and died (20) . Complete recovery generally follows appropriate therapy in the absence of complicating factors such as other sites of infections (meningitis, abscesses).\n\nAntimicrobial therapy must be started as soon as possible in infants suspected of bacteremia. In most cases, this should be done before the recovery of organisms. The clinician cannot wait for this information because of the vulnerability of newborns to bacterial infections.\n\nIn most instances, a penicillin derivative and an aminoglycoside are used to treat n e w b o r n s . Although most anaerobic organisms are susceptible to penicillin G, m e m b e r s of the B. fragilis group and some strains of other Bacteroides are resistant to that agent. Therefore, such therapy can be inappropriate for the eradication of \u00df-lactamase-producing Bacteroides (20) . Antimicrobials that are effective against these organisms should be used, including clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, imipenem, and the combination of a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin.\n\nSince clindamycin does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quantities, it is not r e c o m m e n d e d for the treatment of meningitis. Other antimicrobial agents such as chloramphenicol or metronidazole, which are k n o w n to penetrate the central nervous system, should be administered in the presence of meningitis. Although the experience in newborns is limited, metronidazole has been used successfully in the treatment of neonatal bacteremia (38) .\n\nThe length of treatment for anaerobic infections is not established. H o w e v e r , it is apparent from data derived from older children (31) that prolonged therapy of at least 14 days is adequate to eliminate the infection.\n\nSurgical drainage is essential when pus has collected. Organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia have been recovered from other infected sites in many patients. In some cases, these extravascular sites undoubtedly serve as a source of persistent bacteremia.\n\nThe early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and the administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play significant roles in preventing mortality and morbidity in newborns.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a relatively common disease in the newborn, occurring in 1 to 2%. The term N E C has been applied to a clinical syndrome that probably has multiple etiological factors. The type of feeding, prematurity, low birth weight, umbilical catheterization, hypoxemia, and other conditions that inhibit oxygen delivery to the gut may predispose the newborn to develop N E C (39) . The role of bacteria such as E. coli, \u039a. pneumoniae, and other organisms in N E C has been suggested because they have been isolated in various epidemics (39) . H o w e v e r , the role of anaerobic bacteria in N E C has been studied only recently (40).\n\nCertain infants have been identified as being at high risk. Many of these infants are premature, some are small for gestational age, and almost all have sustained a period of stress or hypoxemia. Hyaline membrane disease, sepsis, congenital heart disease, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia have all been associated with development of N E C . Maternal complications that are associated with fetal distress and shock (such as prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal infection) frequently are observed in these infants.\n\nT w o sequential conditions are significant in the development of N E C . The first is injury to the intestinal mucosa caused by ischemia, which is followed by the detrimental activity of intestinal bacteria.\n\nDamage to the intestinal mucosa can be due to various factors that may be synergistic. In shock and hypoxia, there is a shunting of blood to the heart and brain and reduction in the blood supply to the intestinal tract and kidney. This \"diving reflex\" can cause intestinal ischemia and permanent damage to the mucosa, including initial thrombosis of the vascular canal and local infarction of the bowel.\n\nSome procedures that may cause gut ischemia have been associated with N E C , including the use of umbilical and venous catheters. The possibility exists that interruption of portal venous flow during the use of the catheters may result in compromise of the gut mucosa.\n\nDiet also has been associated with the etiology of mucosal damage. It was noted that N E C rarely occurs before feeding, and it is especially prevalent in infants fed with hyperosmolar formulas. Since premature infants are relatively unable to handle large loads of water and electrolytes, severe fluid loss with damage to the mucosa can occur when these solutions are given.\n\nThe intestinal bacteria exploit the break in the integrity of the mucosa. Adynamic ileus and stasis develop and bacteria colonize and multiply in the fed infant w h o s e immunologic defenses are deficient. Gas-forming organisms that generate pneumatosis may accumulate and rupture the intestinal wall, producing pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis. Further invasion of the lumen takes place, and bacterial proliferation extends into the lymphatics and radicles of the portal circulation and reaches the liver. Finally, overwhelming sepsis and death occurs.\n\nN u m e r o u s reports have implied that the fecal microflora may contribute to the pathogenesis of N E C . A broad range of organisms generally found in the distal gastrointestinal tract have been recovered from the peritoneal cavity and blood of infants with N E C .\n\nA m o n g the various organisms isolated from infants with N E C , and thus implicated in the etiology of N E C , are the acknowledged enteric pathogens (rotavirus, Coronavirus, Coxsackie B 2 and Salmonella, and members of the normal flora of the neonatal gut such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae) and nonenteropathogenic organisms (Enterobacter cloacae and Clostridia) (41) .\n\nClostridia may be pathogenic in certain cases of N E C (34, 40, 41) . Pedersen et al. (40) isolated C. perfringens from an infant with fulminant N E C , and postulated that the disease might be gas gangrene of the bowel. In other investigations, C. perfringens (34, 42) , Clostridium butyricum (43, 44) , Clostridium difficile (45) , and other Clostridia have been isolated from infants with N E C . All these clostridial species also have been recovered from the blood of newborns with N E C (35, 36, 43) . The toxin of C. difficile, the agent of antibiotic-associated colitis, has been found in the stools of infants with N E C (46) and also in stools of normal infants (47) . Because Clostridia are normal inhabitants of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract, their role as primary pathogens of N E C has been challenged (42) . The Clostridia may act as secondary invaders of an already existing necrotic focus. T h e mechanism may be similar to that postulated for a type of necrotic enteritis occurring in children and adults in China and Sri L a n k a , in which C. perfringens invades an intestinal wall previously damaged by parasitic infestation (48) .\n\nThe hypoxia and circulatory disturbances in small premature infants at risk for N E C may lead to ischemic segments of bowel, in which the multiplication of Clostridia and the production of toxin may result in bowel ulceration, infarction, pneumatosis, and the clinical picture of enterocolitis.\n\nClostridia in the gastrointestinal tract do not cause illness unless they invade the tissues a n d / o r produce exotoxins. A low oxidation-reduction potential, which occurs in the presence of devitalized tissue, is essential for toxin production. Therefore, those infants who are colonized by\n\nThe gas-forming capability of certain Clostridia may explain the more extensive pneumatosis intestinalis and the higher incidence of portal venous gas among the infants with Clostridia. The production of Clostridia exotoxins, which cause cell lysis and tissue necrosis, may explain the more rapid progression to gangrene and the more extensive gangrene found in infants with Clostridia (49) .\n\nThe anaerobic bacteria, including Clostridia, are considered to be members of the normal flora of infants of this age. Long and Swenson (27) showed that most newborns were colonized by 10 days of age with aerobic gram-negative rods as well as by an anaerobic flora. Various species of Clostridia were found in one-third of the infants. The sources of the neonatal intestinal flora are (a) the unsterile environment to which the infant is exposed from the moment he or she leaves the uterus, and (b) the normal flora of the cervix and vagina, which contains many anaerobes, including Clostridia (6) . Differences among neonates in gestational age, route of delivery, and type of feeding are associated with different colonization patterns of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (27) .\n\nThe onset of N E C generally is in the first week of life, but in some patients it may be delayed to the second or third week. The typical infant with N E C is premature and recovering from some form of stress, but is well enough to begin gavage feedings. H e or she develops temperature instability, lethargy, and moderate abdominal distention. The stools show traces of occult blood, and diarrhea may be present. As abdominal distention progresses, the gastric residue rises, the urine volume decreases, and osmolarity rises. T h e gastric aspirate then becomes bile stained, hypotension develops, and gross blood appears in diarrheal stools. If untreated, the patient will progress to massive abdominal distention, acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, peritonitis, and vasomotor collapse.\n\nThe earliest radiographic finding may be dilation of the small bowel. The pattern suggests mechanical or aganglionic obstruction, most frequently in the form of multiple dilated loops of small bowel, but sometimes at isolated loops. Air-fluid levels often are observed in the erect position. Commonly, intestinal loops will appear separated because of the presence of mural e d e m a or peritoneal fluid. This progresses to pneumatosis intestinalis in about 30% of infants, and about one-third of those also will have gas within the liver's portal venous system. C o m m o n findings are thickened bowel wall, bubbly appearance of the intestinal wall and contents, and loops of unequal size. Free air ultimately will be identified within the peritoneal cavity of all infants with N E C who are not successfully treated. Often the site of perforation is walled off, and the intestinal wall may be intact in some infants with gas under the diaphragm.\n\nStool cultures are consistently negative for pathogens, but blood cultures yield organisms in about one-fourth of the patients. The white blood count may be low or high, and the platelet count usually falls. At least 50% of infants with N E C have platelet counts of 50,000/mm 3 or less.\n\nProthrombin time and partial thromboplastin times are elevated. Hyponatremia is c o m m o n at the outset of N E C .\n\nMedical management consists of withholding oral feeding, placement of an asogastric tube, vigorous intravenous hydration with fluids containing electrolytes and calories, support of the circulation with plasma, blood, or dextran, and administration of oral and systemic antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of sepsis. The acutely ill neonate presenting with a septic shock-like condition requires immediate attention. Antibiotics appropriate for the known sensitivities of the nursery patient's enteric flora should be started immediately; ticarcillin and gentamicin or clindamycin and an aminoglycoside are satisfactory. White cell transfusions may be effective in infants with sepsis w h o s e bone marrow reserves are depleted, but there is no agreement on this point. Orally administered aminoglycosides are not indicated since they do not prevent intestinal perforation or alter the course of the disease (50) .\n\nPenicillin and metronidazole, which are effective against most Clostridia should be used in the treatment of infections by these organisms. Because of the resistance of many Clostridium spp. to clindamycin, this drug should not be used for these organisms.\n\nW h e n N E C has been detected early and appropriate therapy instituted promptly, only a small percentage of infants will require surgical intervention. Of the many indications for surgery in N E C , the most common is intestinal perforation (51) . This acute emergency usually develops between 12 and 48 hr after the onset of colitis, although it has been noted as late as 1 week. Additional surgical indications include a right lower quadrant m a s s , a persisting isolated dilated loop of bowel, abdominal wall erythema, thrombocytopenia, acidosis, ascites, and failure to respond to medical therapy.\n\nProphylaxis with oral kanamycin or gentamicin has been shown to either lower the incidence of the disease or have no appreciable effect (52) . Nevertheless, multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms may produce severe morbidity (52) , and N E C can develop despite the suppression of gramnegative stool flora (52) . Superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus or Candida may develop. Direct gastrointestinal injury may be induced by aminoglycosides (53) . The systemic absorption of gentamicin may also have an adverse effect (50) . Aminoglycosides are not effective against clostridial organisms, and the use of oral vancomycin may be indicated if Clostridia are cultured (45) . At present, endemic N E C occurs too infrequently and unpredictably to warrant the administration of oral antibiotics. Nevertheless, during epidemics of this disorder, especially those associated with a specific organism, appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis may be warranted. Infection control measures are indicated.\n\nInfant botulism is presented in Chapter 28.\n\nAnaerobes are frequently isolated from brain abscesses in children. The seeding of anaerobic bacteria into the central nervous system occurs either through contiguous spread from chronic mastoiditis, otitis media, or sinusitis, or through hematogenous seeding from a distant site (e.g., lung or abdomen). Brain abscesses occur most frequently in the first 20 years of life and between the ages of 50 and 70 (54) . The most common anaerobic organisms found are gram-positive anaerobic cocci, Bacteroides species (including B. fragilis), Fusobacterium, and Actinomyces. In a recent study of 19 children with brain abscesses, 14 were found to have sinusitis and 2 others had dental infections (54) . Anaerobic organisms were recovered alone in 6 3 % of the specimens, mixed anaerobic and aerobic organisms were recovered in 26% of the specimens, and aerobes alone were recovered in two patients (11%). The experience emphasizes the importance of anaerobes in the pathogenesis of intracranial abscesses.\n\nCases of anaerobic meningitis are rare; however, when reported, they are usually associated with chronic otitis media or as a complicaton of a surgical procedure such as lumboperitoneal shunts (55) .\n\nGroup A ^-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae are traditionally associated with tonsillar and peritonsillar infections. H o w e v e r , anaerobes also have been isolated from the tonsils of children with chronic recurrent tonsillitis (56) and peritonsillar abscess (57) . \u00df- Lactamase-producing strains of B. fragilis, Fusobacterium spp., and S. aureus w e r e isolated from the tonsils of about three-fourths of children with recurrent tonsillitis (58) (59) (60) .\n\nA recent study demonstrated an association between the presence of \u00df-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPO) and the outcome of 10-day oral penicillin therapy (60) . T h e s e organisms also were isolated from the household contacts of children repeatedly treated with penicillin, suggesting their possible transfer between family m e m b e r s .\n\nThese B L P O may be responsible for protecting streptococci from penicillin. This protective action has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (62) (63) (64) . A 200-fold increase in resistance of G A B H S to penicillin was observed w h e n it was inoculated with S. aureus (62) . When mixed with cultures of B. fragilis, the resistance of G A B H S to penicillin increased 8500-fold (63) .\n\nUsing a subcutaneous abscess model in mice, Brook et al. ( \n\nEither clindamycin or the combination of penicillin and clavulanic acid (a ^-lactamase inhibitor), which are active against both G A B H S and Bacteroides, were the most effective in eradicating the infection.\n\nU n d e r these circumstances, therapy directed at both the B L P O and the streptococci may be required for the eradication of infection. Several studies have described the efficacy of clindamycin and its parent compound, lincomycin, in the treatment of recurrent streptococcal illness or the streptococcal carrier state (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) . The superiority of these drugs may be due to not only their effectiveness against G A B H S but also the sensitivity of other aerobic and anaerobic organisms that may \" p r o t e c t \" the pathogenic streptococci by producing /3-lactamase.\n\nThe most recent of these studies is a prospective randomized study comparing penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin therapies (69) . \u00df-Lactamase-producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 43 of the 45 (93%) tonsillar cultures before therapy. The administration of penicillin eradicated G A B H S in 2 of 15 patients, erythromycin in 6 of 15, and clindamycin in 14 of 15.\n\nSuppurative thyroiditis and parotitis generally have been regarded to be due primarily to S. aureus. H o w e v e r , anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., recently have been identified as causative organisms (70) (71) (72) .\n\nWhen appropriate microbiological techniques for anaerobes are applied, anaerobes frequently are recovered in chronic sinusitis. In one study (73) , 4 3 % of the patients harbored anaerobes in mixed culture; in 9%, anaerobes were found to be the only isolate. The predominant anaerobes isolated were Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides ssp., and Veillonella spp. In a study of 40 children with chronic sinusitis, anaerobes were isolated from all 37 culture-positive patients (74) . Anaerobes were the only isolate in 23 patients (62%), and were recovered with aerobes in the remaining 14 patients (38%). An average of almost three anaerobes per specimen was found. Bacteroides spp. (including B. melaninogenicus), anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium spp., /3-hemolytic streptococci, S. aureus, and Haemophilus spp. were the organisms isolated, in descending frequency. Bacteroides fragilis, which has been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses of adults, was not isolated in this group of pediatric patients.\n\nThe fact that anaerobes have been isolated in brain abscess and meningitis occurring after sinusitis (54) emphasizes the urgency of appropriate therapy. Therapy should include the early use of effective agents directed at the likely pathogens and also surgical intervention, if necessary.\n\nAnaerobes are responsible for periodontal infections in children. Fusobacterium spp., pigmented Bacteroides, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Actinomyces spp. are the significant pathogens associated with dental infections such as periodontitis and periodontal abscess (75).\n\nThe more chronic the nature of otitis or mastoiditis, the more frequently anaerobes are isolated. F o r example (76) , in acute otitis, anaerobic gram-positive cocci were isolated from 15% of the aspirates, whereas another study (77) recovered anaerobes from 56% of the aspirates in patients with chronic otitis media. Chronic ear infections are usually polymicrobial. The predominant aerobes are enteric gram-negative rods and S. aureus, and the predominant anaerobes are Bacteroides spp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and F. nucleatum. Many of the organisms recovered from the chronically infected ear produce the enzyme \u00df-lactamase.\n\nIn a study of 22 children undergoing mastoidectomy for chronic mastoiditis (78) , anaerobes were isolated alone or in combination with aerobes in 21 (95%). An average of 3.5 organisms per specimen (2.2 anaerobes and 1.3 aerobes) were isolated; the most prevalent organisms were Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups), S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli. Antibiotics effective against a polymicrobial flora can provide effective therapy in chronic otitis media. Further studies are needed to define the optimal antibiotic and surgical treatment.\n\nAnaerobic bacteria have been more closely linked to intraabdominal infection than perhaps any other infection in the body. This is not surprising because anaerobes outnumber aerobes in the gastrointestinal tract by 1000 to 1 (16) . With the introduction of improved anaerobic bacteriology, anaerobes have been isolated from nearly all specimens obtained from abdominal infections, such as those following trauma or perforated appendicitis.\n\nBacteroides fragilis is the most important pathogen in appendicitisrelated infections (79) . One study (80) of 100 peritoneal fluid specimens from children w h o had undergone appendectomy reported anaerobic organisms in 8 8 % (14% alone and 74% in mixed culture) of the specimens. Bacteroides spp. were the predominant (157 isolates) anaerobes, including 92 in the B. fragilis group and 26 in the B. melaninogenicus group. All of the B. fragilis and 2 5 % of the other Bacteroides isolates were ^-lactamase producers. The principal aerobic organism isolated was E. coli (57 isolates) . Bacteroides fragilis and E. coli were also primary organisms isolated from postsurgery draining wounds.\n\nThe polymicrobic nature of infection associated with a perforated appendix is emphasized by this report. In addition, the presence of \u00df-lactamase-producing organisms in 7 5 % of the patients has important therapeutic implications.\n\nAnaerobes commonly have been identified as causative organisms in adult pleuropulmonary infections such as aspiraton pneumonia, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, and e m p y e m a (16) . Organisms isolated from these pleuropulmonary infections generally reflect the normal oral flora.\n\nStudies (81, 82) in children have yielded findings that parallel the adult experience. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 92% of 52 children with aspiration pneumonia (81) and 12% of children with necrotizing pneumonia and in all 10 children with lung abscesses (82) . The preponderant anaerobes isolated were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups), Fusobacterium spp., and Veillonella spp. Anaerobes and aerobes (2.7 and 2.2 per specimen, respectively) were almost always isolated together, emphasizing the polymicrobic nature of these infections. Bacteroides fragilis resistant to penicillin was isolated in 15% of the patients, a recovery rate similar to that found in adults. Anaerobes also were recovered from four of six children with cystic fibrosis, when cultures were obtained by transtracheal aspiration (83) . These organisms included B. melaninogenicus and B. fragilis, and were mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria. Anaerobes are involved in the colonization of the tracheobronchial tree and the subsequent tracheitis and pneumonia that follow tracheal intubation after tracheostomy (84) . Serial tracheal cultures from 27 intubated patients yielded an average of 2.2 aerobes and 1.2 anaerobes per specimen. The organisms recovered were similar to those found in patients with aspiration pneumonia.\n\nCutaneous abscesses are commonly encountered in children. Staphylococcus aureus and G A B H S are the organisms previously implicated in these infections. Anaerobes, chiefly the B. fragilis group, have been associated with cutaneous abscesses of the buttock, perirectal, vulvovaginal, head, and finger (paronychia) areas more frequently than other sites of the body (85) .\n\nSurgical drainage is the therapy of choice. However, the fact that the ^-lactamase producers S. aureus and B. fragilis are frequently isolated from the abscesses supports the selection of an antibiotic that is resistant to /3-lactamases.\n\nDecubitus ulcers are a complication of prolonged hospitalization in both adults and children. A study (86) of 42 children with decubiti reported the isolation of anaerobes, primarily in mixed culture, in 50% of the ulcers. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci, B. fragilis, and F. nucleatum were the most c o m m o n anaerobes isolated, and S. aureus, G A B H S , H. influenzae, and Enterobacter spp. were the most common aerobes.\n\nAnaerobes are rarely isolated from the blood cultures of pediatric patients. H o w e v e r , in a survey of anaerobic infections in children, blood cultures were the second most frequent source of anaerobic organisms (87) . The predominant isolate from blood cultures (56 to 65%) was Propionibacterium acnes, an organism that is a normal inhabitant of the skin. N o doubt many of these isolates reflect contamination of the blood culture with skin flora. H o w e v e r , P. acnes can act, on occasion, as a true cause of bacteremia, such as in the contamination of ventriculoperitoneal shunts (87) . The other anaerobic organisms most commonly isolated from blood are B. fragilis, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Fusobacterium (28, 3 1 , 87) . Anaerobic bacteremia usually occurs in patients with chronic debilitating disorders such as malignancy, immunodeficiency, or chronic renal insufficiency, and it usually carries a poor long-term prognosis. Bacteroides spp. also were frequently isolated following perforation of an abdominal viscus and appendicitis (88) .\n\nA recent report summarized 28 children with bacteremia (31) . Twentynine anaerobic isolates were recovered; of these, 14 were Bacteroides spp., 4 anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 4 P. acnes, and 3\n\nFusobacterium spp.\n\nSome predisposing conditions were noted in these patients. T w o had malignancies, two suffered from hematologic abnormality, and one had an immune deficiency. Certain serious complications associated with bacteremia were noted in the patients. The most frequent complication was meningitis, which occurred in five patients. Peritonitis occurred in three patients, subdural e m p y e m a in two, and septic shock in one. Early recognition and treatment with appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapies were the most important factors in reducing the mortality and morbidity of these patients.\n\nAs reported in adults, the strains of anaerobic organisms recovered from the blood of children depended to a large extent on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. Bacteroides spp., including the B. fragilis group, were the predominant isolates from patients in whom the gastrointestinal tract was the probable portal of entry. Infections of the ear, sinus, and oropharynx predisposed to bacteremia by Peptostrep-tococcus spp. and Fusobacterium spp. This is not surprising since these organisms are part of the normal flora of such anatomical sites and can be involved in local infections. tion of appropriate m a n a g e m e n t of these infections."}
