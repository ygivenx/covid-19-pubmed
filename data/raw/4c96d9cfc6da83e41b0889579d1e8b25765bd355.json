{"title": "Mortality of COVID-19 is Associated with Cellular Immune Function Compared to Immune Function in Chinese Han Population", "body": "In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3%\n\n(1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4%\n\n(22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female. 6 In January, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 1,2 Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 1, 2 COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 7 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors. 7 Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for human. 9 According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic case, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO 2 < 90% on room air. 10 Asymptomatic case has been reported in China and Germany. 11, 12 Huang et al 3 first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

Guan et al 4 reported findings from 1099 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 infection clustered within groups of humans in close contact, and was more likely to affect older men with comorbidities. However, the full spectrum of disease without comorbidities or related to cellular immune functions is not yet known. The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to 14,117 normal controls in Chinese Han population. Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients according to WHO interim guidance. 13 Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed as previously described. 14 All patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. 13 According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic All rights reserved.

Severe case of pneumonia is defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO 2 < 90% on room air. 10 Clinical outcomes (discharges, mortality, and recovery, etc.) were monitored up to March 4, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\n\nA confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens. Samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection as described previously. 14 In brief, the pharyngeal swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 \u03bcL of virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit. Forty \u03bcL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The suspension was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20031229 doi: medRxiv preprint signal at 55 \u00b0C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China). A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting. Only RT-PCR confirmed cases were included in the analysis.\n\nAll antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Two 100-\u03bcL samples of blood were placed in two tubes for staining according to mmanufacturer's manual.\n\nAfter this procedure, 1 mL of red-cell lyses buffer was added to each tube and incubated for \n\nCategorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Data (non-normal distribution) from repeated measures were compared using the generalized linear mixed model. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c7 2 test, although the Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc).\n\nFor unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided \u03b1 of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and, given the potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.\n\nBecause the cohort of patients in our study was not derived from random selection, all statistics are deemed to be descriptive only.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%) ( Table 1 ). Less common symptoms were chill, sore throat, shortness of breath, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThe COVID-19 mortality rate in China is 2.3%. 6 However, the mortality rate is 4.6% (2,282 death cases in 49,540 confirmed cases)in Wuhan, 1.9% (8 death cases in 414 confirmed cases) in Beijing, and 0.9% (3 death cases in 338 confirmed cases) in Shanghai based on China CDC official report on March 4, 2020. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)10 9 /L in Wuhan, 3 1.0(IQR, 0.7-1.4)10 9 /L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 10 9 /L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals (Table 1) , respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality.\n\nThe radiologic and laboratory findings were showed (Table 1) . These data could helpfully distinguish between mild and severe or critical patients. All of the 752 enrolled patients showed bilateral patchy patterns, or ground-glass opacity, or local patchy shadowing of chest CT scan. On admission, the predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass opacity (21.7%).\n\nDue to lack of reference ranges for blood routine and lymphocytes of normal Chinese Han population, we systematically analyzed the 14,117 healthy adult Chinese Han people of 18-86 years old and classified them as an age group every 10 years for the convenience of other researchers in the future ( Table 2 ).

As the disease progressed and clinical status deteriorated, the levels of lymphocytes progressively decreased before death. Further analyzing 178 cases without glucocorticoid treatment, their lymphocyte subsets showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01) between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU) cases ( Table 3 ).\n\nThe levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were elevated (Table 1) , indicating blood clot formation, severe inflammation, and cytokine storm in COVID-19\n\npatients.\n\nThis report, to our knowledge, is the first study of COVID-19 with normal controls. The study population included 752 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 14,117 normal controls. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%) ( Table   1 ).

Many specific diseases directly or indirectly cause secondary immunodeficiencies. This includes many types of cancer, and certain chronic virus infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus). Our findings indicated the PLD at presentation were associated with the severity of disease ( Table 3 ). The severe PLD or the secondary immunodeficiencies (CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm 3 ) is common in HIV patients. When CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm 3 , patients with T cell depletion have increased susceptibility to fungal infections. 15, 16 It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in human. 17 The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes. 18 Our findings showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01) between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU) cases without glucocorticoid treatment indicating COVID-19 directly effected on immune system is possible.\n\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors. 7, 19 The report shows All rights reserved.

A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for lymphocyte subsets in severe or critical cases should be followed up. Our findings also suggest that lymphocyte subsets should be analyzed at admission immediately no matter how COVID-19 affected lymphocytes through directly or indirectly. When patients are confirmed as COVID-19, clinicians should order tests for lymphocyte subsets in order to intervene early in the consequences of the PLD.\n\nIn this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). The mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)10 9 /L in Wuhan, 1.0(IQR, 0.7-1.4)10 9 /L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 10 9 /L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3 + lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm 3 , CD4 + lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm 3 , and CD8 + lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm 3 .\n\nWe acknowledgment all volunteer emergency medical teams for Wuhan from Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nAll rights reserved.
