{"title": "Genotypic diversity, circulation patterns, and co-detections among rhinoviruses in Queensland, 2001", "body": "Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the largest related assemblage of genetically and antigenically distinct respiratory pathogens known, comprising 168 genotypes. These picornavirus species often occur in symptomatic young children from community and hospital populations where they create a sizable burden for management and are a frequent trigger of wheeze. [1] [2] [3] Picornavirus infections can more often be observed among children presenting to an emergency department than other respiratory virus infections. 4 Nearly three quarters of respiratory virus detection episodes during the first 28 days of life are due to RVs and over half are symptomatic. 3 Until recently, much of what is known of RV diversity, epidemiology and clinical impact was determined using human studies and cell culture methods in the 1950s to 1980s. In 2006, the molecular discovery of a genetic clade of RVs that could only be cultured in vitro using sophisticated air-liquid interface cultures was subsequently ratified as a third species, Rhinovirus C (RV-C). 5, 6 To date, RV-C has added 56 distinct RV types to the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. As more is learned, conclusions reached by some earlier studies have required re-examination and confirmation. [5] [6] [7] We aimed to estimate the spectrum of RV genotypes, species seasonality and RV involvement in co-detections in Queensland using a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001 and tested using molecular tools expected to account for all RV species.\n\nSpecimens extracts (n=1179; 94% nasopharyngeal aspirates) for retrospective RV testing originated from an unselected sample of mostly young patients (57.5% male) aged one day to 90.1 years (average 5.4 years, median 1.5 years) from across Queensland who presented to a hospital or clinic serviced by Pathology Queensland, Queensland Health (PQ), with symptoms of acute respiratory infection during 2001.\n\nThere was no systematic sampling protocol used, thus our sample did not represent .

Extracts included nasopharyngeal aspirates (85.5%), lavage (9.5%), endotracheal aspirates (2.2%) and swabs (1.3%). Nucleic acids had been previously extracted and stored at -80\uf0b0C as previously described. 8 This study was approved by the Queensland Children's Health Services human research ethics committee (#HREC/06/QCRH/097) and UQ medical research ethics committee #2009000039.\n\nExtracts had been previously tested by PQ using direct or culture-amplified direct fluorescent assay to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses (AdV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) and influenza viruses A & B (IFAV, IFBV). 9 PCR was not in routine use at PQ in 2001. This study applied additional previously described realtime RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR) assays to detect human metapneumovirus (MPV) 8, 10 and human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43. 11 RVs were detected using a modified version of a previously described RT-rtPCR. 12, 13 The RV RT-rtPCR can also detect some human enterovirus (EV) types.\n\nRV/EV-positive extracts were genotyped using a conventional nested VP4/VP2 RT-PCR assay incorporating previously described primers that include part of the 5' untranslated region (UTR), viral protein coding regions VP4 and partial VP2. [14] [15] [16] first-round RT-PCR used OneStep RT-PCR (QIAGEN, Australia) or SensiFAST Probe No-ROX One-Step (Bioline, Australia) kits and subsequent second-round PCR used Bioline MyTaq HS DNA polymerase kit. In cases of failure to amplify a VP4/VP2 amplicon (~540bp), part of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR; ~400nt) was amplified. 16 Amplicons were sequenced (BigDye sequencing kit v3.1, Applied Biosystems Pty. Ltd.) and, after removal of the primer sequence (Geneious Pro v6) 17 , RV and EV sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KF499366-KF499501, KF688607-KF688723). Curated and detailed methods are available online. [18] [19] [20] A virus variant was described as an \"untypeable RV\" when a clean sequence could not be obtained from either genotyping assay, despite the extracts being repeatedly positive by RT-rtPCR assay. RV genotype was determined by best match using the . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

For each virus, the probability of codetection with another virus was assessed with Fisher's exact test using 2 x 2 contingency tables. We used a threshold p value of <0.05 for a statistically significant association. Logistic regression was used to estimate any effect of age, sex, season and other circulating virus types on detection of RV.\n\nIn 615 extracts (52.2% of those tested) at least one virus was detected. The most frequently detected virus or virus group was a picornavirus ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ; \n\nAn RV or EV type was assigned to 278 (93.9%) of 296 extracts (25.1%) that were picornavirus-positive by our screening RT-rtPCR. Most picornaviruses were RV-As and RV-Cs (Table 1 ). In total, 70 distinct RV types circulated at our site, including variants of 4 types that could not be assigned to an existing genotype (Supplementary \n\nMost viruses occurred as single detections (n=539; 87.6% of virus positives; Figure   3 ). Co-detections were found in 76 extracts, 71 with 2 viruses detected and 5 with 3 viruses detected; no extract had more than 3 viruses identified. Viral co-detection totals also exhibited a bimodal peak (Supplementary Figure 3) . Associations of RVs with other viruses, sex and season, were examined using logistic regression models, and results were consistent with those from the univariate analyses (Supplementary Table 3 It was important to look at co-detections as a proportion of each virus, not just RVs.\n\nOther viruses were involved in a similar or greater proportion of co-detections compared to the RVs (Figure 3 . IFAV had one of the lowest proportion of codetections (9.6%) as did the EVs (8.3%) while HCoV-NL63 was not involved in any co-detections. RVs were significantly less likely than expected to be co-detected with IFAV (p<0.0001; Supplementary Table 4 ). PIVs were less likely to be detected with RSV (p=0.05) or IFAV (p=0.03), and RSV was less likely to be found with IFAV (p=0.002) than expected. Most picornavirus positive extracts were genotyped, a fact that agreed with some studies, but not others. 23, 29 28, 30-32 Lower rates of genotyping success in community studies may be due to lower viral loads among less severely ill subjects. We propose that our combination of real-time RT-PCR screening and conventional nested-PCR genotyping methods are an effective starting point for genotyping ~90% of RVs among ill populations, even from extracts stored for over a decade.\n\nOthers have found RV-Cs to be the dominant RV species in hospital-associated asthma exacerbations. 1, 33 We have previously found them to be numerically dominant but RV-A to be more clinically significant in non-hospitalised asthmatics. 34 We observed RV-B detections to be a significantly smaller proportion of total RV detections than was expected. We have previously noted this in studies of hospitalised populations. 29, 34 It is not clear why RV-Bs are under-represented.\n\nPerhaps the RV-Bs are less severe pathogens 23, 26 or their infections contribute disease to a different population than that tested here. It is noteworthy that RV-Bs are also under-represented in community populations. 28, 35 While the RV species often co-circulated during 2001, one species usually predominated each month, changing from month to month. Each species displayed bimodal peaks in autumn and spring and a trough in winter, which aligned with IFAV circulation. Exchange of prevailing species and turnover of prevalent genotypes is supported by other studies that employ molecular typing and span 12 months or . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We and others have seen this and related interactions, termed virus interference, in other populations. 29, 40, 41 Virus interference is a consistent feature that some have attributed to RV dominance. 42, 43 It remains unclear whether this interference pattern is a feature associated with a mostly paediatric symptomatic population, a high proportion (86%) of nasopharyngeal extracts, whether influenza type or subtype plays a role or if preexisting RV immunity can influence interference. Influenza may control a population's susceptibility to other respiratory viruses, blocking their spread because of strong a population-level innate immune response generated by influenza strains during an annual epidemic \"flu season\".\n\nInitiation of seasonal influenza epidemics is mostly associated with rate of influenza virus change, strain replacement, availability of susceptible hosts and climatic conditions. 44, 45 Further study of virus interference is warranted and could inform our understanding of human respiratory diseases that exhibit temporal trends such as exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, otitis media and allergic rhinitis. Understanding a mechanism for interference may allow us to harness it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics this putative protection.\n\nWe found nearly five times more co-detections in our study than were reported from among the first viral detections of those enrolled in a community birth cohort from Brisbane. 3, 27 EVs were observed to have an especially low proportion of co-detections in our 2001 sample. As reported in our earlier studies of populations from different years and Australian locations, we again observed that detection of an IFAV, EV, RV or RSV occurred with reduced likelihood of co-detection of any other virus in that patient's sample. 21, 29 There was a higher likelihood of co-detection among extracts positive for an AdV or MPV. Numbers were small for the other viruses. The accepted . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The small number of extracts available from January and February (summer) limited the strength of the RV analyses during this period. Also, the absence of testing for bocaviruses may have reduced the positive associations noted among the respiratory viruses because bocaviruses are frequent partners in extracts positive for more than one respiratory virus. 5, 21 Despite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings here and elsewhere indicate this is less likely to occur for RVs than for other respiratory viruses. 21, 29 That nearly 80% of RV detections occurred in the absence of another virus once again supports the assertion that RVs are primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. If a respiratory tract sample is to be collected for any testing and if routine screening of respiratory viruses is to serve its patients best, RV should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year, with allowance for their relative replacement by IFAV cases during winter. \n\nWe thank Pathology Queensland Central for providing clinical specimen nucleic acid extracts, Michael Witt for aid with data collection and Stephen Lambert for helpful discussions.
