{"title": "", "body": "Andi L. Shane and Larry K. Pickering In 2007, 325,289 licensed childcare facilities in the United States provided care for 9.5 million children, employing 1.2 million providers (http://www.naccrra.org). Aggregation of young children potentiates transmission of organisms that can produce disease in other children, adult care providers, parents, and community contacts. Group childcare settings can increase the frequency of certain diseases and amplify outbreaks of illness (Table  3-1 ). An increase in antibiotic use to facilitate earlier return to care enhances the potential for emergence of resistant organisms, resulting in an increased economic burden to individuals and society. [1] [2] [3] Children newly entered into group childcare are at especially high risk of enteric and respiratory tract infections. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] As a consequence of these infections, attendees may be protected against respiratory tract viral infections and reactive airway diseases during subsequent years. 10 An 8-year prospective cohort study conducted from 1998 to 2006 in Quebec comparing children enrolled in home care with those in small or large group childcare observed an increase in infections at initiation of large group care. Enrollment in group childcare before 2.5 years of age resulted in decreased maternal reporting of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and otitis media during elementary school years. 11 Frequent infections early in life, resulting from sibling and group childcare exposure, may be protective against atopic disease in later childhood. 12 A prospective evaluation of a birth cohort of almost 4000 children in the Netherlands demonstrated that children who were enrolled in group childcare between birth and 2 years of age had more parental reported episodes of airway symptoms in the first 4 years of life but fewer reported symptoms from 4 to 8 years of age. A longitudinal repeated-event analysis did not reveal protection from early childcare enrollment with respect to asthma symptoms, hyperresponsiveness, or allergic sensitization at the age of 8 years. 13 \n\nQuantifying the types of childcare arrangements and the number of children participating in each is challenging because of different ascertainment methods used in several data sources. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Survey of Income and Program participation (SIPP), which collects information about childcare arrangements for children <15 years of age. A primary care arrangement is defined as the arrangement used the most hours per week. In 2006, 47% of children <15 years of age were cared for by a relative; 24% attended an organized care facility including group childcare, nursery or preschool or Head Start; 16% were in non-relative provided care, the majority of which was outside the child's primary residence; 11% were in an unspecified arrangement; and 2% were not enrolled in a regular arrangement 14 (www. census.gov/population/www/socdemo/2006_detailedtables. html). Types of facilities can be classified by size of enrollment, age of enrollees, and environmental characteristics of the facility. Grouping of children by age varies by setting but in organized care facilities children usually are separated into: infants (6 weeks through 12 months), toddlers (13 through 35 months), preschool (36 months through 59 months), and school-aged children (5 through 12 years), which has relevance to infectious disease epidemiology with regard to regulation and monitoring. Most nonrelative care provided in an organized care facility is subject to state licensing and regulation, whereas care by a relative in a child's or provider's home may not be subject to state regulations and monitoring.\n\nAlthough most infectious diseases have the propensity to propagate in childcare settings, diseases shown in Table 3 -1 commonly are associated with outbreaks.\n\nOutbreaks of diarrhea occur at a rate of approximately 3 per year per childcare center and are associated most frequently with organisms that cause infection after ingestion of a low inoculum. These organisms generally are transmitted from person to person 15, 16 and include: rotavirus, sapovirus, norovirus, astrovirus, enteric adenovirus, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, Shigella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), E. coli O114, enteropathogenic E. coli, and Clostridium difficile. 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] These fecal coliforms 30, 31 and enteric viruses contaminate the environment; 32 contamination rates are highest during outbreaks of diarrhea. Attack rates and frequency of asymptomatic excretion of these organisms in children attending group childcare are shown 3-year-old enrollee who developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome following farm animal contact. The diarrheal attack rate was 23% among enrollees, which is comparable with attack rates reported during previous childcare-associated outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7. Prolonged asymptomatic shedding and subclinical cases in concert with poor hygiene and toileting practices likely contributed to propagation of the outbreak. 36 Shigella sonnei causes periodic multicommunity outbreaks in group childcare. Childcare attendance and age <60 months were associated with illness in a dispersed community outbreak of molecularly related strains of S. sonnei among traditionally observant Jewish children in New York City in 2000. 37 Multiple illnesses in a single household were determined to be due to intrahousehold secondary transmission. A multicommunity outbreak of over 1600 culture-confirmed cases in the greater metropolitan area of Cincinnati, Ohio from May to September, 2001 had an overall mean attack rate of 10% among childcare center enrollees. Highest attack rates occurred among newly or incompletely toilettrained enrollees and lowest attack rates among diapered children. The attack rate was 6% among staff. Secondary transmission was facilitated by poor hygiene practices, including inaccessible in Table 3 -2. Reported attack rates depend on several factors, including methods used for organism detection. 23, 24 Enteric viruses are the predominant etiology of diarrheal syndromes among children in group care. 33 Environmental swabs corroborated stool virus detection in 45% of outbreaks. 34 With the marked decline in rotavirus disease due to the success of the rotavirus immunization program, norovirus may be the most common viral enteric pathogen in childcare centers.\n\nOrganisms generally associated with foodborne outbreaks, including Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni, infrequently are associated with diarrhea in the childcare setting. Report of an outbreak of diarrhea in 14 of 67 (21%) exposed children and adult care providers associated with ingestion of fried rice contaminated with Bacillus cereus, 35 however, highlights the fact that foodborne outbreaks can occur in the childcare setting, especially when food is prepared and served at the center.\n\nBacterial pathogens that have the potential to cause severe systemic infections, including E. coli O157:H7 and other STEC, 28 have been associated with fecal-oral transmission in group childcare settings. An outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 occurred in a childcare center in Alberta, Canada in 2002 likely after introduction by a are more likely to be younger than children who are not; therefore, higher attack rates merely may represent exposure of a younger, nonimmune cohort. In a multicommunity group childcare outbreak of S. sonnei, the highest attack rates were noted in rooms where both toilet-trained and diapered children were co-mingled (14%) compared with rooms with toilet-trained children only (9%) and rooms with diapered children only (5%), despite comparable availability of sinks and toilets. 38 \n\nRotaviruses are the most common etiology of significant symptomatic diarrhea in children <2 years of age, although rates of diarrhea have decreased since implementation of rotavirus immunization. 51 Infections are transmitted primarily from person to person by the fecal-oral route. Rotavirus can be isolated from human stools for approximately 21 days after illness onset and rotavirus RNA has been detected on toys and surfaces in childcare centers. 32 The highest attack rates for rotavirus infections have occurred in infants and children enrolled in group childcare.\n\nPrimary prevention of rotavirus in all settings has been accomplished with administration of one of two licensed rotavirus vaccines. Before introduction of rotavirus vaccines in the U.S. in 2006, rotavirus caused an estimated 20 to 60 deaths, 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations, 205,000 to 272,000 emergency department visits, and 400,000 outpatient visits annually among children less than 5 years of age. The 2007-08 and 2008-09 rotavirus seasons were notable for their decreased duration, later onset, and fewer positive tests, compared with median data for 2000-2006 from a national network of sentinel laboratories. 52, 53 Hepatitis A Virus Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections usually are mild or asymptomatic in children. Less than 5% of children <3 years of age and <10% of children between 4 and 6 years of age with HAV infection develop jaundice. The first outbreak of HAV in a childcare center was reported in 1973 in North Carolina; 54 outbreaks subsequently were recognized throughout the U.S. 55 Peak viral titers in stool and greatest infectivity occur during the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. Outbreaks in childcare centers generally are not recognized until illness becomes apparent in older children or adults. 55 Prior to routine use of hepatitis A vaccine in children in the U.S., approximately 15% of episodes of HAV infection were estimated to be associated with childcare centers. HAV infections are transmitted in the childcare setting by the fecal-oral route and occur more frequently in settings that include diapered children. Large size and long hours of operation also are risk factors for outbreaks of HAV infection. 56 The mainstays for prevention of HAV infection include maintenance of personal hygiene, hand hygiene, and disinfecting procedures. Universal administration of hepatitis A vaccine to toddlers in Israel in 1999 resulted in a notable absence of outbreaks of HAV in childcare and elementary school settings from 2000 through 2006. 57 Universal administration of 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine to all children, beginning at 1 year (12 through 23 months) of age, with the 2 doses administered at least 6 months apart is recommended in the U.S. 58 Administration of hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin to unimmunized, immunocompetent people 12 months through 40 years of age for postexposure prophylaxis also is recommended. 59,60 A case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of an HAV vaccination program targeted at childcare attendees between 2 and 5 years of age found that people with direct contact with a childcare center were protected against disease. Furthermore, the 6-fold greater risk of HAV infection that occurred in people who had contact with a childcare center prior to implementation of the hepatitis A immunization program in Maricopa County, Arizona was not found in the postvaccination case-control study. 61 Enhanced population-based surveillance conducted by health departments among six U.S. sites from 2005 to 2007 was notable for 1156 cases among 29.8 million people. Being an employee or child in a childcare center accounted showing the essential importance of these practices to reduce the propagation of shigellosis in childcare centers. 40 Investigators in North Carolina demonstrated that proper diapering and hand hygiene practices, and food-preparation equipment decreased the incidence of diarrheal illness among children and staff in out-ofhome childcare centers. 41 Spread of diarrhea pathogens from index cases in the childcare setting into families has been reported for many enteropathogens (see Table 3 -2), with secondary attack rates ranging from 15% to 80%. A retrospective evaluation of transmission of infectious gastroenteritis (80% due to rotavirus) in 936 households in northern California revealed a secondary household attack rate of 9%. Older children in the households had a 2-to 8-fold greater risk of secondary infection than adults. 42 During outbreaks of diarrhea in childcare centers, asymptomatic excretion of enteropathogens is frequent 15, 23, 24, [43] [44] [45] [46] (see Table 3 -2). During outbreaks associated with enteric viruses and G. intestinalis in children <3 years of age, asymptomatic infection occurs in up to 50% of infected children. In one longitudinal study of diarrhea in 82 children <2 years of age in a childcare center, more than 2700 stool specimens were collected on a weekly basis. 45 Using enzyme immunoassays, 21 of 27 (78%) children infected with G. intestinalis were asymptomatic and 19 of 37 (51%) children with rotavirus were asymptomatic. A point-prevalence evaluation of 230 asymptomatic preschool children attending childcare in southwest Wales and inner London demonstrated a 1.3% fecal colonization rate with both Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. 47 The role that asymptomatic excretion of enteropathogens plays in spread of disease is unknown.\n\nAcute infectious diarrhea is two to three times more common in children in childcare than in age-matched children cared for in their homes. 4, 48, 49 Approximately 20% of clinic visits for acute diarrheal illness among children younger than 3 years of age are attributable to childcare attendance 4 . In addition, the incidence of diarrheal illness is 3-fold higher among children in their first month in out-of-home childcare than in children cared for at home. 4, 5 Diarrhea occurs 17 times more frequently in diapered children than in children not wearing diapers. 50 Children who are diapered All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com in San Francisco, California occurred between 2002 and 2004. 80 Of 11 outbreak cases, 9 (82%) occurred in children <7 years of age; all had extensive contact with the private-home childcare facility, where the adult index patient spent considerable time. Isolates from 4 of the pediatric patients and 2 of the adult patients had identical molecular patterns. Thirty-six additional children and adult contacts had latent TB infections. 80 In a Swedish outbreak of TB following prolonged contact with a provider with cavitary disease in a childcare center, 17 children had radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease; 1 child had miliary disease and 17 had latent tuberculosis infection. The tuberculin skin test was effective in identifying infected children. 81 These outbreaks demonstrate that detection and contact investigation are paramount in reducing tuberculosis infection. High transmissibility of TB among residents of adult daycare centers also has been demonstrated. 82 Person-to-person transmission of Chlamydophila pneumoniae among children in the childcare setting has been reported without occurrence of disease. 83 Kingella kingae colonizes the oropharynx and respiratory tracts of young children and has been associated with invasive disease. 84 The first reported outbreak of invasive K. kingae osteomyelitis/pyogenic arthritis occurred in a childcare center in 2003; 15 (13%) children older than 16 months of age were found to be colonized, with 9 children (45%) in the same class as the 2 children with invasive disease. Matching pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns supported child-to-child transmission. 85 Successive cases of K. kingae endocarditis and osteomyelitis occurred in two children attending a North Carolina childcare center in 2007 with a child enrollment of 14 children and 5 staff. Interaction with children from a co-owned childcare facility with 19 children >21 months of age and 5 staff resulted in an epidemiologic investigation of the attendees at both. A high rate of invasive disease, but a low rate of colonization (4%) was noted. 86 Outbreaks of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection among children and adult staff in the childcare setting have been reported. [87] [88] [89] In a study of prevalence of GAS conducted in a childcare center after a fatal case of invasive disease, 25% of 258 children and 8% of 25 providers had GAS isolated from throat cultures. 87 Risk of carriage was increased in children who shared the room of the index case (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 0.8 to 9.4). Perianal GAS infection and infection associated with varicella also have been reported. 88, 90 A clone of GAS (emm type 4) was responsible for a community outbreak of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome among children attending a childcare center in northern Spain. The outbreak-associated strains were not isolated from pharyngotonsillar swabs of staff, childcare or household contacts of the colonized and infected children. 91 The risk of acute otitis media (AOM) is increased in children in childcare, especially in children <2 years of age. 65, 66, 92, 93 In one study, the incidence rate ratio for AOM was 1.5 in children in childcare compared with that in children in home care. 65 AOM is responsible for most antibiotic use in children <3 years of age in the childcare setting. Childcare attendance also has been associated with risk of developing recurrent AOM (>6 episodes in 1 year), as well as chronic otitis media with effusion persisting for more than 6 months. 94 The size of the childcare center was an important variable in the occurrence of frequent AOM in children younger than 12 months of age, varying from 16% in small care groups to 36% in large care groups. 93 Genotypically similar strains of nontypable Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococci were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures from children attending childcare centers. 95, 96 Handwashing decreases the frequency of acute respiratory tract diseases in childcare. 97, 98 A cluster, randomized, controlled trial of an infection control intervention including training of childcare staff regarding handwashing, transmission modes of infection, and aseptic techniques related to nose-wiping demonstrated a significant reduction in URTI among enrollees <24 months of age over 311 child-years of surveillance. 97 Because most infectious agents are communicable for a few days before and after clinical illness, exclusion from childcare of children with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections probably will not decrease spread.\n\nfor 8% of cases, while international travel and contact with a case were more frequent risk factors associated with 46% and 15% of hepatitis A cases. Despite the decline in the incidence of HAV, continued education, training, and monitoring of staff regarding appropriate hygienic practices are essential components of any preventive plan.\n\nChildren <2 years of age attending childcare centers have an increased number of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses compared with age-matched children cared for at home. 4, 6, 62, 63 Approximately 10% to 17% of respiratory tract illnesses in U.S. children <5 years of age are attributable to childcare attendance. 64 ,65 A prospective cohort study found that 89% of disease episodes among children attending a childcare center are respiratory tract infections (RTIs). 66 Another prospective cohort study following 119 children through 24 months of age from 2006 to 2008 demonstrated a mean annual incidence of RTI of 4.2 per child during the first year and 1.2 during the second year of the study. One or more viruses were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from twothirds of the episodes. 67 Infections with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) also have been reported in childcare enrollees. [67] [68] [69] In a retrospective cohort study of 2568 children from 1 to 7 years of age, 1-year-old children cared for in childcare centers, when compared to those cared for at home, had an increased risk of the common cold (relative risk (RR), 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.0), otitis media (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.5), and pneumonia (RR, 9.7; 95% CI, 2.3 to 40.6). 62 In a prospective cohort study in France, the risk of upper respiratory tract illnesses (URTIs) was higher for those cared for in small centers (odds ratio (OR), 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.4) and large centers (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.8) compared with those in family childcare homes. The intermediate risk for those in large childcare centers may have resulted from segregation in those centers into small classrooms. A national registry-based study of Danish children from birth to 5 years of age revealed that for children under 1 year of age, the first 6 months of enrollment in group childcare were associated with a 69% higher incidence of hospitalizations for acute respiratory tract infections compared with children in home care. The incidence of hospitalization decreased after 6 months of group childcare enrollment and was comparable with children in home care after >12 months of enrollment. 70 Respiratory tract infections that have been studied in the childcare setting include pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, common cold, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. 6 [72] [73] [74] In 2010 over 6000 cases of pertussis were reported in California including 10 deaths in infants <3 months of age. 75 Incompletely immunized infants under 12 months of age often experience severe clinical disease. In many group childcare arrangements, adolescents and adults experiencing mild to moderate illnesses may be the source cases of pertussis. An outbreak of pertussis, occurring in a childcare center in northern Israel with 88% immunization coverage, resulted in infection among all of the unvaccinated children and only 7% of the vaccinated children. 76 In 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended universal use of one of the licensed Tdap vaccines for those aged 10 through 64 years. 73, 74 Childcare providers of any age with routine contact with infants <12 months of age also should receive a single dose of Tdap. 77 An adult or adolescent also can be the index case for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in a group childcare setting; childto-child transmission occurs infrequently. 78, 79 An outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) associated with a private-home childcare facility Risk of disease due to Neisseria meningitidis may be increased in children in group childcare. Using space-time cluster analysis of invasive infections during 9 years of surveillance, from 1993 to 2001, in the Netherlands, researchers noted that clustering beyond chance occurred at a rate of 3% and concluded that this rate was likely the result of direct transmission. Childcare center attendance was reported as the likely exposure for 8 of 40 (20%) clusters, accounting for 13 of 82 (16%) cases of invasive disease with multiple serosubtypes. 113 For children from 2 through 10 years of age, routine immunization with meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended only for children at continued increased risk of invasive disease. 114 The risks of developing primary invasive disease due to S. pneumoniae, nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae, and carriage of antibiotic-resistant strains are increased for children in childcare centers [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] and childcare homes. 117 In Finland, an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in children <2 years of age was associated with childcare attendance (OR, 36; 95% CI, 5.7 to 233) and family childcare (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 112). 117 Secondary spread of S. pneumoniae in the childcare setting has been reported, but the exact risks are not known. 110, 122, [124] [125] [126] Colonization with S. pneumoniae in one childcare center was 59% for children 2 to 24 months of age; 75% of the strains were penicillin-nonsusceptible. 118 In an evaluation of the childcare cohort of an 11-month enrollee with multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae infection in southwest Georgia, S. pneumoniae was isolated from 19 of 21 (90%) nasopharyngeal cultures; 10 (53%) matched the serotype 14 and susceptibility pattern of the strain from the index child; 4 of the 10 children with index-strain carriage had shared a childcare room with the index child, suggesting person-to-person transmission. 127 Incorporation of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into the routine childhood immunization schedule in the U.S. in August 2000 has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the frequency of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). 128 The impact of vaccination on AOM and reduction of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal infection is less dramatic and more variable, with evidence of increasing nasopharyngeal colonization and respiratory tract infections caused by nonvaccine serotypes and nontypable strains of pneumococcus. [128] [129] [130] [131] Serotype 19A, not included in PCV7, has been associated with IPD in many communities 132 and in childcare. 133 A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 to replace PCV7. 134, 135 The impact of broader serotype coverage, including serotype 19A, with PCV13 on epidemiology will be important to monitor as PCV13 is administered to a notable proportion of enrollees in group childcare.\n\nDuring an outbreak of echovirus 30 infection in children and care providers in a childcare center, and in exposed parents, infection occurred in 75% of children and 60% of adults; aseptic meningitis was more frequent in infected adults (12 in 65, 18%) than in children (2 in 79, 3%). 139 A retrospective cohort study of four childcare centers, attendees, employees, and household contacts in Germany revealed that 42% of childcare attendees, 13% of their household contacts, 5% of childcare center employees, and 2% of their household contacts were ill over a 31-day period. Thirteen percent (12 of 92) of childcare attendees had meningitis. This outbreak likely began among children enrolled in group childcare, with secondary cases occurring among their household contacts. 140 An association with childcare also was noted in an outbreak of echovirus 18 meningitis in a rural Missouri community with an attack rate of 1 per 1000 people; contact with childcare was noted as the most common risk factor among ill people. 141 \n\nParvovirus B19, the agent of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), can cause arthropathy, transient aplastic crisis, persistent anemia\n\nRates of virus infection are highest among children <2 years of age and elderly people, and rates of complications are greatest among children of all ages with predisposing or underlying medical conditions. Among preschool-aged children with influenza infections, hospitalization rates range from 100 to 500/100,000 children, with highest hospitalization rates among children from birth to 1 year of age. 99 Influenza viruses are spread from person to person primarily through large respiratory tract droplets, either directly or by secondary contact with objects that are contaminated with infectious droplets. Children shed virus for several days prior to onset of clinical symptoms and are contagious for >10 days following symptom onset. Transmission of infections may be increased by close contact among children who are not able to contain their secretions.\n\nAnnual vaccination against influenza is the primary method for preventing influenza infection. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually for all people 6 months of age and older. 99 A single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted during the 1996 to 1997 influenza season in 10 childcare centers in San Diego, California revealed that vaccinating children against influenza reduced influenza-related illness among their household contacts. [100] [101] [102] In addition to preventing respiratory tract illness, several studies have shown the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing AOM among children in childcare. 97, 98, 103 In one study of children 6 to 30 months of age in childcare centers, OR for AOM was 0.69 and the 95% CI was 0.49 to 0.98 for children who received influenza immunization. 104 Routine use of intranasal influenza vaccine among healthy children may be cost effective and can be maximized by using groupbased vaccination approaches. A prospective 2-year efficacy trial of intranasal influenza vaccine in healthy children 15 through 71 months of age demonstrated clinical as well as economic efficacy associated with focusing vaccination efforts on children in group settings. 105 Vaccinating children has been associated with protection of older people as well. [105] [106] [107] Children with signs and symptoms of URTI should be cohorted. Ill childcare providers should be discouraged from providing care or having contact with children in group childcare. Vaccination of both child attendees and adult providers annually is recommended and both children and providers should receive frequent reminders regarding hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette to reduce influenza infections in group childcare settings. Frequently touched surfaces, toys, and commonly shared items should be cleaned at least daily and when visibly soiled as these items can serve as fomites in the transmission of viruses. 108 The issue of childcare center closure as a strategy to prevent community spread of influenza was raised by the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. A survey of 58% of families of 402 students in Perth, Australia who were affected by pandemic-related school closures revealed a substantial disruption of daily schedules. Almost half of the parents had work absences and 35% made alternative childcare arrangements. Children impacted by the school closures were more likely to report out-of-home activities during the closure period. Less than half (47%) of the parent respondents felt that the school closures were an effective response. 109 Childcare center and elementary school absences were two components of a surveillance system used for monitoring influenza activity in a U.S.-Mexico border community during the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. 110 \n\nStudies conducted before routine use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in the U.S. showed that the risk of developing primary invasive Hib infection was higher among children attending childcare centers than in children cared for at home, independent of other possible risk factors. 107, 111 Incorporation of conjugated Hib vaccines into the routine immunization schedule of children in the U.S. has reduced dramatically the frequency of invasive Hib disease. 112 All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com HIV infection in the childcare setting should be monitored for exposure to infectious diseases, and their health and immune status should be evaluated frequently. The risk of transmission of HIV by percutaneous body fluid exposure, such as biting, is low. Complete evaluation of the source and extent of exposure should be undertaken to assess the possible risk of HIV transmission and benefits of postexposure prophylaxis. 152 Precautions for prevention of HBV, HCV, and HIV infection should be directed toward preventing transfer of blood or secretions from person to person. Childcare providers should be educated about modes of transmission of bloodborne diseases and their prevention, and each center should have written policies for managing illnesses and common injuries 161 such as bite wounds. 162 Standard precautions for handling blood and blood-containing body fluids should be practiced in all childcare settings. 152 Children infected with HIV or HCV or children who are HBsAg carriers should be included in childcare activities. Decisions regarding attendance at childcare and the optimal childcare environment should be made by parents and the child's physician after considering the possible risks and benefits.\n\nThe magnitude of skin infections or infestations and the rates of occurrence in children in group childcare compared with rates in age-matched children not in group childcare are not known. The most frequently recognized nonvaccine-preventable conditions are impetigo or cellulitis (due to S. aureus or GAS), pediculosis, and scabies. 88, 98, 163 Other conditions with skin manifestations that occur in children in childcare include herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, varicella, ringworm, and molluscum contagiosum. 88, [164] [165] [166] Varicella Zoster Unimmunized children in childcare facilities are susceptible to varicella infection; most reported cases occur in children <10 years of age. 88, 165 An outbreak of varicella was reported when a child with zoster attended a childcare center. 164 Although the lesions were covered, the child continually scratched and showed others the lesions, indicating the potential difficulties with enforcement of preventive policies. Universal immunization with varicella vaccine has reduced cases of chickenpox among children in group childcare. 58, 167 However, several outbreaks of varicella have been reported among childcare attendees in the post-licensure era. 89, 168, 169 A varicella outbreak occurring among elementary school attendees in Maine in December to January 2003 was due to failure to vaccinate. The vaccination rates were notable for a decrease from 90% of kindergarten attendees to 60% of thirdgrade enrollees. Vaccine effectiveness in this cohort of 296 students was 89% against all varicella disease and 96% against moderate to severe disease. This outbreak illustrates the importance of vaccination of susceptible older children and adolescents to decrease the incidence of severe disease in unvaccinated children. 167 In June 2005 and June 2006, ACIP recommended the implementation of a routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program for children, with the first dose administered at 12 through 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. 167 An outbreak among elementary school student recipients of 1-dose and 2-dose varicella immunizations with a pre-outbreak coverage rate of 97% resulted in 84 reported infections (most cases with <50 lesions). Of these, 25 (30%) of children had received 2 doses and 53 (63%) had received one dose of varicella vaccine. The severity of disease and vaccine effectiveness of 1 and 2 doses were comparable. 170 An outbreak in an elementary school in Philadelphia in 2006 demonstrated that second-dose varicella vaccination for outbreak control was an effective intervention to reduce varicella incidence among classroom contacts of a case. [171] [172] [173] This strategy may be employed as a control measure among age-eligible childcare attendees who have not received the 2-dose varicella series in an outbreak setting. in immunocompromised hosts, and nonimmune fetal hydrops. Serologic evidence of past infection has been reported to be 30% to 60% in adults, 15% to 60% in school-aged children, and 2% to 15% in preschool children. 178 The virus is endemic among young children and has caused outbreaks of disease in the childcare setting. 179, 180 Parvovirus B19 spreads by the respiratory route or through contact with oropharyngeal secretions. In an outbreak during which more than 571 school and childcare personnel were tested serologically, the overall attack rate among susceptible individuals was 19%, with the highest rate (31%) occurring in childcare personnel. 179 A cross-sectional study of 477 childcare staff revealed a seroprevalence for parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies of 70%. Seropositivity was associated with age, and among staff less than 40 years of age, with length of group childcare contact. 181 The greatest concern is that an infected pregnant woman could transmit the virus transplacentally, leading to fetal hydrops; neonatal illness and congenital malformations have not been linked to prenatal parvovirus B19 infection. Estimates of the risk of fetal loss when a pregnant woman of unknown antibody status is exposed are 3% for fetal death after household exposure and 2% after occupational exposure in a school. 182 Cytomegalovirus Young childcare attendees shed cytomegalovirus (CMV) chronically after acquisition and often transmit virus to other children and adults with whom they have close daily contact. [142] [143] [144] [145] Transmission is thought to occur through direct person-to-person contact and from contaminated toys, hands of childcare providers, or classroom surfaces. 146 Prevalence studies have shown that 10% to 70% of children <3 years of age (peak, 13 through 24 months) in childcare settings have CMV detected in urine or saliva. 142, 144, 147 CMV-infected children can transmit the virus to women, with rates from 8% to 20% in their childcare providers and 20% in their mothers per year 148-150 compared with rates of 1% to 3% per year in women whose toddlers are not infected.\n\nThere is concern about the potential for spread of bloodborne organisms in the childcare setting: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). [151] [152] [153] [154] The highest concentrations of HBV in infected people are found in blood and blood-containing body fluids. The most common and efficient routes of transmission are percutaneous blood exposure, sexual exposure, and, perinatally, from mothers to offspring at the time of delivery. Other recognized but less efficient modes of transmission include bites and mucous membrane exposure to blood or other body fluids. 155, 156 Two case reports and a larger study have demonstrated possible transmission of HBV among children in the childcare setting. [156] [157] [158] Investigators in Denmark and the Netherlands demonstrated high levels of HBV DNA in saliva of 46 HBeAg-positive children, suggesting that exposure to saliva could be a means of horizontal transmission of hepatitis B infection. 159 Other investigators have failed to demonstrate transmission in childcare, despite long-term exposure to children positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). 160 Because of the small number of studies, the risk of HBV transmission in childcare cannot be quantified precisely. With implementation of universal immunization of infants with HBV vaccine beginning in 1991, the potential for horizontal HBV transmission in the childcare setting has been reduced to negligible. If a known HBsAg carrier bites and breaks the skin of an unimmunized child, hepatitis B immune globulin and the HBV vaccine series should be administered. 152 The transmission risk of HCV infection in childcare settings is unknown. The general risk of HCV infection from percutaneous exposure to infected blood is estimated to be 10 times greater than HIV but less than HBV.\n\nNo cases of HIV infection are known to have resulted from transmission of the virus in out-of-home childcare. Children with\n\nClusters of primary HSV infections occur in children in childcare, most frequently manifesting as gingivostomatitis. 166 In one study, restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA of isolated HSV revealed that a single strain of HSV-1 had been transmitted among children. 174 Molluscum contagiosum is a benign, usually asymptomatic viral infection of the skin; humans are the only source. Virus is spread by direct contact or by fomites. Infectivity is low, but outbreaks have been reported. The frequency of occurrence in the childcare setting is unknown. The incidence of pediculosis capitis (head lice) among children in childcare facilities in Seattle was 0.02 per 100 child-weeks 175 and 0.03 per child-year in San Diego. 176 Because head lice are transmitted by direct head-to-head contact, childcare centers with shared sleeping areas may facilitate transmission. Treatment of infested children and their contacts with pediculicides may be considered as control measures. 177\n\nInfections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were reported infrequently in the group childcare setting before 2000. 136, 137 However, with the emergence of communityacquired (CA)-MRSA and its predisposition for affecting people in crowded conditions where sharing of fomites and skin-to-skin contact occurs, and where hygiene is compromised, children in group care are at risk. A molecular epidemiologic study of MRSA prevalence among 104 children, 32 employees, and 17 household contacts of attendees affiliated with a university medical center childcare facility in Texas noted an overall 7% colonization rate with MRSA. MRSA was isolated from one employee (3%), 6 (35%) family members and 4 (2%) environmental samples. Molecular typing revealed closely related, mostly community-associated isolates. The use of macrolide antibiotics and asthma medications were associated with MRSA colonization. 138 MRSA colonization of a child in a childcare setting is not a reason for exclusion from the setting.\n\nIn the United States, there are 16 diseases against which children should be immunized, unless there are medical contraindications: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib, measles, mumps, rubella, poliomyelitis, HBV, varicella, S. pneumoniae, HAV, influenza, rotavirus, human papillomavirus, and meningococcal disease. 58 Immunization of children and their care providers should be high priority (Table 3 -3) and immunization especially is likely to benefit children in childcare settings. 183 \n\nAnimal exposure has been associated with sporadic zoonotic infections as well as outbreaks, injuries, and allergies, most notably in children <5 years of age. The increased prevalence of infections in\n\nAll references are available online at www.expertconsult.com 2%. 143, 144, 147, 201 During community outbreaks of erythema infectiosum, childcare providers were found to be among the most affected occupational groups, with seroconversion rates ranging from 9% to 31%. 179, 180 In a prevalence study of HAV antibodies among childcare providers employed in 37 randomly selected childcare centers in Israel during 1997, 90% (402 of 446) of the childcare providers had HAV antibodies; the authors postulated a 2-fold increased risk of acquiring HAV among providers. 203 During outbreaks of diarrhea in childcare centers, 40% of care providers developed diarrhea. 50 During a multicommunity outbreak of shigellosis, the overall median attack rate among employed staff of childcare centers was 6%, with a range of 0% to 17%. 38 In outbreaks of GAS and echovirus 30 infection 139 in childcare centers, adult providers and parents were affected. Similar prevalence rates of pneumococcal colonization (5% among adult employees of childcare centers with child contact and 5% among nonclinical employees at a tertiary care center) were noted in a study performed in 2003 in Galveston, Texas; these data suggest that childcare providers are not at an increased risk for pneumococcal colonization in the universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era. 204 Compared with nonproviders childcare providers have a significantly higher annual risk of at least one infectious disease and loss of work days due to infectious diseases. 205 Childcare providers should receive all immunizations routinely recommended for adults, as shown on the adult immunization schedule (see Table 3 -3) (www.cdc.gov/vaccines).\n\nThe economic burden of illness associated with group childcare was estimated at $1.5 billion annually adjusted to 2005 U.S. dollars. 206 Precise mechanisms for estimating illness burden and for evaluating effectiveness of infection control interventions are rare due to multiple challenges associated with performing such assessments. 207 Attributing an outbreak to group childcare is challenging, because although these settings may promote \n\nSpecific standards should be established for personal hygiene, especially hand hygiene, maintenance of current immunization records of children and providers, exclusion policies, targeting frequently contaminated areas for environmental cleaning, and appropriate handling of food and medication. In studies in which improved infection control measures were implemented and monitored, both upper respiratory tract illness and diarrhea were reduced in intervention centers. 97, 208 In addition, in children at intervention centers, 24% children were given fewer antibiotic prescriptions and parents had fewer absences from work. 98 Educational sessions on health topics by healthcare professionals were found to be the most efficacious means of promoting health education in simultaneous surveys of licensed childcare center directors, parents, and health providers in Boston. 209 A prospective observational study of a convenience sample of 134 childcare centers in Pennsylvania noted that sites that were located in suburban, non-profit, parent-funded centers had improved health and safety practices compared with sites that were located in urban areas, received their funding through state subsidies, or this age group is likely due to compromised hand hygiene resulting in transmission of pathogens from animal to child. Animal interaction can occur in locations where childcare is provided, with a resident pet or visiting animal display, or in public venues where children visit, including petting zoos, aquariums, county fairs, parks, carnivals, circuses, or farms. Guidelines to reduce opportunities for transmission and infection have been developed to prevent disease transmission in many of these settings. 185, 186 Inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal supervision of children's activities following animal contact, and hand-to-mouth activities following animal contact are risk factors for infection. Infections that have been associated with close contact with animals include those caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, Cryptosporidium parvum, Campylobacter jejuni, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and Giardia intestinalis. [187] [188] [189] [190] In addition to enteric infections, animal exposure can result in transmission of ecto-and endoparasites, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in certain settings, and local or systemic infections as a consequence of bites, scratches, stings, and other injuries.\n\nContact with animals within the childcare environment should occur where controls are established to reduce the risk of injuries and disease. Specific recommendations for group childcare settings include close supervision of children during animal contact, strict hand hygiene after direct animal contact or contact with animal products or environment, designation of areas for animal contact that are separate from areas in which food or drink are consumed, disinfection and cleaning of all animal areas with supervision of children >5 years of age who may be participating in this task. Amphibians, reptiles, and weasels (ferrets and mink) should be housed in a cage and not handled by children. Wild or exotic animals, nonhuman primates, mammals with a high risk of transmitting rabies, wolf-dog hybrids, aggressive wild or domestic animals, stray animals, venomous or toxin-producing spiders, and insects should not be permitted in the group childcare setting, 190 (http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/).\n\nDuring an 8-week period of observation of 270 children, antimicrobial agents were used by 36% of children in childcare centers compared with 7% and 8% of children in childcare homes or in home care, respectively (P<0.001). The mean duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed for children in childcare centers (20 days) differed significantly (P<0.001) from children in childcare homes (4 days) and children in home care (5 days). 128 The estimated annual rates of antibiotic treatment ranged from 2.4 to 3.6 times higher for children in group care compared with children in home care. 191, 192 A prospective, population-based survey of 818 families with one or more 18-month-old children from 2002 to 2003 in rural and central Sweden revealed that a high concern about infectious illness was associated with more frequent physician consultations and more prescriptions for antibiotics. Concern for infection was more common in children enrolled in group childcare than children not enrolled in group childcare. Concern about infectious illness was an important determining factor for physician consultation and antibiotic prescriptions. Directed consultations in which providers address parental concerns may result in less antibiotic prescribing with preserved parental satisfaction. 193 Multiple studies have documented an association of childcare center attendance and colonization or infection due to resistant bacteria, including outbreaks of illness due to resistant S. pneumoniae 115, 117, [119] [120] [121] 126, 194, 195 and S. sonnei, 22, 39, 40 as well as colonization due to resistant H. influenzae, 196 E. coli, 197,198 and MRSA. 137\n\nParents of children who attend a childcare facility and people who provide care to these children have increased risk of acquiring infections such as CMV, 143, 144, 146, 147, [199] [200] [201] parvovirus B19, 179, 180 HAV, 202, 203 and diarrhea. 44, 50 Childcare providers have annual rates of CMV seroconversion ranging between 8% and 20%, compared with hospital employees whose seroconversion rate is about soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer for inactivation of norovirus on human finger pads demonstrated a greater virucidal effectiveness with the antibacterial soap compared to the ethanol-based hand sanitizer. Despite utility of alcohol-based sanitizers for control of enteric and respiratory tract pathogen transmission, they may be relatively ineffective against norovirus. 216 Molecular techniques, including DNA probes, could be used as surrogate markers to study transmission of enteric pathogens in childcare centers and from centers to children's homes. 217 Further evaluations of molecular techniques during outbreak investigations, hand hygiene strategies, and educational interventions could assist with allocation of resources to the most effective prevention regimens.\n\nWritten policies should be available for the following areas: managing child and employee illness, including exclusion policies; maintaining health, including immunizations; diaperchanging procedures; hand hygiene; personal hygiene policies for staff and children; environmental sanitation policies and procedures; handling, serving, and preparation of food; dissemination of information about illness; and handling of animals. Local health authorities should be notified about cases of communicable diseases involving children or care providers in the childcare setting. The AAP and the American Public Health Association jointly published the National Health and Safety Performance Standards: Guidelines for Out-of-Home Childcare Programs, available at http://nrckids.org. This comprehensive manual provides guidelines regarding infectious diseases and other healthrelated matters pertinent to out-of-home childcare. Additional resources include information about group childcare infection rates 218 and guidance for preparation of childcare programs for pandemic response (http://www.aap.org/disasters/). Future investigation of outbreaks of illness associated with group childcare will need to utilize newly developed computerized models and paradigms to assess the economic impact of outbreaks. In an era of limited funding, an understanding of expenses and allocation of resources will be important information to justify utility of interventions.\n\nwere designated as for profit. 210 However, the translation of knowledge into continued practice beyond the education and focus on the intervention remains a challenge. A cross-sectional survey conducted in 2000 childcare providers, parents, and pediatricians in Baltimore revealed deficits of knowledge among all groups. Compared with national guidelines on exclusion for 12 symptoms, childcare providers and parents were over exclusive and pediatricians were under exclusive. More childcare providers and parents than pediatricians felt that exclusion would reduce transmission of disease. 211 As asymptomatic excretion and potential for transmission precede the onset of clinical symptoms in many childcareassociated infectious diseases, strategies that involve prevention would be most efficacious. In addition to traditional handwashing, the use of alcohol-based hand-sanitizing products in healthcare and other settings is an efficacious means of achieving hand hygiene. 212 Ethanol hand sanitizers are more effective than handwashing with soap and water in removing detectable rhinovirus from hands of adult volunteers. An additional evaluation of the effectiveness of adding organic acids to hand sanitizers was notable for residual rhinovirus virucidal activity of up to 4 hours. 213 In support of this preventive strategy, a cluster-randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the homes of 292 families with children who were enrolled in out-of-home childcare centers. A multifactorial intervention emphasizing alcohol-based hand sanitizer use in the home reduced transmission of GI illnesses within families. The effect on reduction of respiratory tract illness transmission in this evaluation was less pronounced and may relate to use of handsanitizing gel following toilet use but not following sneezing, coughing, or blowing/wiping of nasal secretions. 214 A follow-up study that added surface disinfection to a hand sanitizer intervention in a school-based cluster-randomized controlled trial demonstrated a greater decrease in adjusted absenteeism rates due to GI compared with respiratory tract illness. Norovirus was the only virus isolated more frequently from classroom surfaces in the control group. 215 A comparative evaluation of antibacterial liquid"}
