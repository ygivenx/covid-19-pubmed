Synthetic peptides representing the retroviral envelope protein has not yet been solved HIV heptad repeats can block virus entry, perhaps by The two precursor polypeptide chains are represented from their N-termini to the left to their C-termini to the right. The HIV Env encompasses approximately 860 residues and influenza HA 560. The C-termini of both molecules are cytoplasmic, or intravirional, but the cytoplasmic domain of HIV Env is considerably longer than that of HA (as represented by the segments to the right of the trans-membrane domains). During transport to the cell surface both precursors are cleaved as a prerequisite for subsequent fusion activity. The two resulting polypeptide chains of HIV Env, SU / gp120 (surface) and TM / gp41 (transmembrane), are non-covalently associated. Those of influenza virus, HA1 and HA2, are linked by a disulphide bond (intrachain disulphide bonds are not marked). SU and HA1 are responsible for the binding of the respective viruses to cell surface receptors, CD4 and sialic acid. Both receptor-binding sites are created by the juxtaposition in space of conserved residues that are non-contiguous in the amino-acid sequence. In SU of HIV these residues are situated in conserved regions on both sides of the V3 loop. The V3 loop influences the interactions with the chemokine-receptor co-receptors. The cleavage of the precursors creates novel N-termini in the transmembrane proteins. These N-terminal peptides share similar hydrophobic sequences and have been implicated in membrane fusion. C-terminal to the fusion peptides are potential 'coil regions', two in the HIV TM extracellular domain (approx. residues 550-580 and 630-660 in the precursor), and one region in HA2 (residues 40-105). These regions have a propensity to form alpha helices and may form coiled-coils as a step in a series of events that activate the membrane-fusing capacities of the two proteins.\n\ninterfering with the ability of these regions to influenza virions to low pH, proton influx through oligomerise during the fusion reaction [128] .
