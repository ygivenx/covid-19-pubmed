{"title": "Transgenic milk as a method for the production of recombinant antibodies", "body": "One of the challenges created by the biotechnology revolution is the development of methods for the economical production of highly purified proteins at large scales. Recent developments indicate that expression of recombinant proteins in the milk of transgenic animals may be particularly well suited for the production of complex polypeptides.\n\nSince Edward Jenner first used cowpox to protect against smallpox, the use of the immune system to ) Corresponding author. fight disease has proven spectacularly successful.\n\n\u017d The arrival of the hybridoma technology Kohler and . Milstein, 1975 brought a new level of therapeutic potential to the use of the immune mechanisms, with monoclonal antibodies being widely recognized as potential ''magic bullets''. However, when monoclonal antibodies were found to be effective in vitro, \u017d . their xenogenic murine nature led to the development human anti-mouse-antibody responses in pa-\u017d . tients Borrebaeck et al., 1993; Khazaeli et al., 1994 , often precluding repeat treatments. Only, after the \u017d development of approaches recently reviewed in . Vaughan et al., 1998 permitting the production of ( ) \u017d . monoclonal antibodies that are or appear human, could the clinical benefits of these agents be fully realized.\n\nThe pace of approval of monoclonal antibodies for various conditions has recently accelerated: ab-\u017d . ciximab Reoproe for the prevention of acute cardiac ischemia following coronary angioplasty, ritux-\u017d . imab Rituxane for the treatment of non-Hodgkin \u017d . B-cell lymphoma, trastuzumab Herceptine for \u017d . metastatic breast cancer, infliximab Remicadee for \u017d severe Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis Hall, 1995; Glaser, 1996; Sherman-Gold, 1997; Dickman, . 1998; Hoyle, 1998; Webber, 1998 . Since therapeutic antibodies are often developed to treat clinical indications that have a large number of patients \u017d . cancers, arthritis and that their effective dose is generally rather large, it has been imperative to develop very efficient recombinant protein production technologies.\n\nMammalian cell culture has emerged as the method of choice for the production of most monoclonal antibodies currently commercialized. However, even with improvements in culture technology and fermentation scale-up, costs of purified antibod-\u017d ies in the range of 1000 to 2000 US$rg at 10,000\n\n. liter fermentation scale are not uncommon with \u017d higher costs for smaller fermentation scale Werner, . 1998 . Alternative systems are being developed, with the objective of lowering capital investments and cost of goods associated with large scale production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. These in-\u017d clude microbial and insect cell-based recently re-. \u017d viewed in Verma et al., 1998 , plant-based reviewed . in Larrick et al., 1998 , as well as transgenic animal-based production systems. This review will focus on the production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in the milk of transgenic animals, summarizing the status of the technology and examining potential advantages and challenges.\n\nThe ability to modify animal genomes through microinjection technology has offered new alternatives for the manufacture of recombinant proteins. Targeting the production of human recombinant protein pharmaceuticals to the milk of transgenic farm \u017d animals recently reviewed by Houdebine, 1995; Maga and Murray, 1995; Echelard, 1996; Clark, . 1998; Meade et al., 1998 solves many of the problems associated with either microbial or animal cell expression systems. Bacteria often improperly fold complex proteins, introducing more involved and expensive processes, and both bacteria and yeast lack adequate post-translational modification. Bioreactors for cell cultures require high initial capital expenditures, use large volumes of expensive culture media, and often suffer from relatively low yields.\n\nTo express a recombinant protein in the milk of a \u017d . transgenic animal Fig. 1 , expression vectors containing a gene encoding the protein of interest fused \u017d . to milk specific regulatory elements Fig. 2 are generally introduced by microinjection of a one-cell embryo, or alternatively transfected into a cell line suitable for somatic cell nuclear transfer. Following integration into the germline, the mammary glandspecific transgene is transmitted in Mendelian fashion and, if expressed, becomes a dominant genetic characteristic that will be predictably inherited by offspring of the founder animal. Often, transgenic \u017d . animals will express the protein s of interest in gram per liter quantities depending on the mammary-specific regulatory sequences employed, the gene to be expressed, as well as the integration site of the transgene.\n\nTransgenes targeting the expression of recombinant proteins to the mammary gland are usually chimeric, being derived from the fusion of the gene \u017d . encoding the protein s of interest with mammary-\u017d . specific regulatory sequences Fig. 2 . Regulatory sequences from several milk-specific genes have been isolated and used first in transgenic mice, then in large animals. Most of this work has been carried out \u017d with: the ovine b-lactoglobulin gene, rodent mouse, . \u017d . rat and rabbit whey acid protein WAP genes, bovine a-lactalbumin and a-s1-casein genes, as well \u017d as the caprine b-casein gene reviewed in Maga and . Murray, 1995; Echelard, 1996; Meade et al., 1998 . According to the regulatory sequences employed, variable levels of expression for the protein of interest were observed. For example, using the human ( ) Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of the transgenic production process. The coding region of the protein to be expressed is linked to mammary gland specific regulatory elements. The resulting transgene is introduced by pronuclear microinjection into embryos of the \u017d selected species alternatively, somatic cell nuclear transfer using cell lines transfected with the transgene can be used as method to create . \u017d . transgenic sheeps, goats or cattle . Embryos are then transferred to the oviduct or the uterus of a surrogate mother and carried to term. Transgenic offspring are identified and, when mature, are either bred or hormonally induced to lactate. Expression level of the target protein in the milk of transgenic animals is determined and a suitable founder line is chosen for the generation of the production herd.\n\n. tissue plasminogen activator tPA cDNA only low \u017d . level mgrml expression was observed with transgenic rabbits and mice when using a construct containing 1.6 kb of bovine a-s1-casein 5 X -flanking se-\u017d . quences Riego et al., 1993 , whereas the human tPA cDNA under the control of caprine b-casein se-quences was expressed at high levels in transgenic \u017d . goat's milk ) 1 mgrml; Ebert et al., 1991 Ebert et al., , 1994 Recombinant protein expression will vary according to the nature and size of the mammary gland regula-\u017d tory elements as well as the nature cDNA or ge-. nomic and sequence of the expressed gene. Usually ( ) genomic transgenes are expressed at higher levels \u017d than cDNA transgenes Whitelaw et al., 1991; Hur-. witz et al., 1994 . However, systematic studies comparing side by side the expression of cDNA and genomic antibody transgenes in milk have not been published.\n\nSeveral animal species have been used for produc-\u017d . tion of recombinant proteins in milk Table 1 . The choice of animal to employ for transgenic expression is determined by the amount of protein needed as well as reproductive characteristics. Transgenic mice represent an ideal system to test expression constructs prior or concomitant to the generation of larger founder transgenic animal. Fortunately, the milk promoter sequences from all mammals tested are capable of expression in the mouse mammary gland. This allows the relatively inexpensive and rapid testing and optimization of the transgene constructs. If expression of the transgene by the mammary gland is deleterious to the health of the animal, \u017d it will be often evident in the mouse model Devinoy . et al., 1994; Korhonen et al., 1997 . However, the very limited murine milk yield restricts expression of recombinant proteins to milligram quantities.\n\nRabbits have been used for the production of \u017d gram amounts of proteins Massoud et al., 1991; Brem et al., 1994; Korhonen et al., 1997; Stromqvist . et al., 1997; Coulibaly et al., 1999 . However, their labor-intensive milking and high husbandry costs preclude using rabbits for the production of kilograms of therapeutic antibodies. To this end, dairy goats are ideal. The average milk output per doe is 600 to 800 liters per 300-day lactation, although yields greater than 1000 liters per lactation have been recorded. Recombinant antibody concentration in milk in the range between 1 and 5 grl has been reproducibly achieved by this group. In these conditions, herds of transgenic goats of manageable size could easily yield 1 to 300 kg of purified product per year. This represents the low to middle range of the high-volume protein category that would be required for the majority of therapeutic antibodies currently under development.\n\nMoreover, the time from initiating microinjection \u017d to full lactation gestationq growth to sexual matu-. rity q gestation is 16 to 18 months for goats. For cattle, it is approximately 3 years. Thus, the shorter caprine interval permits expansion of the production herds within the time frame needed for regulatory approval of the transgenically produced therapeutic proteins. Finally, there is a much lower incidence of \u017d scrapie in goats only 7 cases reported by the United . States Department of Agriculture through 1998 rela-\u017d tive to sheep 1117 US cases through 1992; Wineland . et al., 1998 which have an almost similar reproductive performance but lower lactation output.\n\nTo date, the method most frequently employed to produce transgenic animals has been pronuclear mi-\u017d croinjection exhaustively reviewed, among others, . by Pinkert, 1994; Houdebine, 1996 . Techniques allowing the direct microinjection of foreign genes into murine pronuclei were adapted to gene transfer into the pronuclei of rabbits, pigs and ruminants \u017dHammer et al., 1985; Bondioli et al., 1991; Ebert et . al., 1991 . Generally, fertilized eggs are flushed from the oviduct of superovulated donors, microinjected with a few hundred copies of the transgene, transferred to the uterus or oviduct of pseudopregnant \u017d recipients following more or less extensive culture . in vitro , and developed to term. In cattle, one cell stage embryos generated from in vitro matured and in vitro fertilized slaughterhouse-derived oocytes can also be used.\n\nWhile successful and widely used, the microinjection approach has had limited efficiency. Transgene integration into the genome of founder animals is \u017d . low, varying from less than 0.1% cattle to 5% \u017d . mice of the microinjected embryos producing transgenic offspring. Moreover, the frequent generation of founder animals carrying the transgene in \u017d . only a subset of their cells mosaics following \u017d pronuclear microinjection Wilkie et al., 1986; Bur-. don and Wall, 1992; Whitelaw et al., 1993 can complicate the expansion of transgenic herds by reducing the frequency of germline transmission of \u017d . the transgene s .\n\nThe recent discovery that differentiated somatic cells can function as karyoplast donors for nuclear transfer has provided a wide range of possibilities for \u017d germline modification in sheep Campbell et al., . \u017d 1996; Wilmut et al., 1997 , cattle Cibelli et al., . \u017d . 1998 and goat Baguisi et al., 1999 . The use of recombinant somatic cell lines for nuclear transfer allows the introduction of transgenes by traditional transfection methods. It has the potential to increase the efficiency of transgenic animal production and overcome the problem of founder mosaicism. However, transfected somatic cell nuclear transfer has not been used very extensively yet and its efficacy in the various ruminant species is undetermined.\n\nIn addition to successful transgenic founder production, somatic cell nuclear transfer could allow for the selection of the appropriate transgenic cell line before the generation of cloned transgenic embryos. This would be particularly important for the transgenic production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in milk where heavy chain and light chain \u017d . Fig. 3 .

The heavy chain-specific signal is red, the light chain-specific signal is green.\n\n( ) transgenes should be expressed in the same secretory cells of the mammary epithelium at equivalent levels. It is also important that transgenes expressing each protein are co-integrated in the same locus to avoid segregation of heavy chain and light chain \u017d . transgenes during herd propagation Fig. 3 .\n\nThere are several reports of expression of antibod-\u017d ies in the milk of transgenic animals summarized in . \u017d . Table 2 . In one case Limonta et al., 1995 an \u017d . anti-CD6 mouserhuman chimeric antibody IgG1 was expressed at levels up to 0.4 mgrml in the milk of mice carrying two transgenes respectively linking rabbit WAP regulatory sequences to genomic light chain and heavy chain sequences.\n\n\u017d . Even higher expression up to 5 mgrml was achieved in mice generated by co-microinjection of transgenes linking either ovine b-lactoglobulin \u017d . Simons et al., 1987 or murine whey acid protein \u017d . Shamay et al., 1991 regulatory sequences to cD-NAs encoding either chimeric mouserhuman or chimeric porcinerhuman light chain and heavy chain \u017d anti-TGEV transmissible gastroenteritis coron-. \u017d avirus IgG genes Castilla et al., 1998a,b; Sola et . \u017d al., 1998 . Interestingly, similar expression levels up . to 6 mgrml were observed with the expression of the same anti-TGEV variable region linked to an IgA \u017d . isotype Castilla et al., 1998a,b . In both cases, milk produced antibodies were found to be functional in a coronavirus neutralization assay.\n\nIn another example, two versions of angiogenin fused to E6, an antibody directed against the human \u017d . transferrin receptor Hoogenboom et al., 1990 were expressed in transgenic mouse milk. The human \u017d rmouse chimeric IgG1 version Newton et al., this . issue was expressed up to 0.8 mgrml. The single-\u017d chain version Newton et al., submitted; Susanna . Rybak, personal communication was expressed up to 1.6 mgrml. The single-chain version was expressed in milk at levels 3000-fold greater than when produced in Escherichia coli, and was superior in \u017d functional assays stability, antigen binding, protein . synthesis inhibition, cytotoxicity to the material purified from inclusion bodies. The IgG1 version was produced at levels ; 160,000-fold higher than was produced in a myeloma cell culture system, and \u017d retained all biological properties Newton et al., this issue; submitted; Susanna Rybak, personal communi-. cation . These data illustrate the potential of the mammary gland expression system for the production of immunoglobulin-enzyme fusion proteins. Fig. 4 .

High-level expression in transgenic mice was observed in all cases. In projects where goat expression data is already available, levels of recombinant antibodies were equivalent or higher to that observed in the corresponding transgenic mouse \u017d models see characteristic examples in Figs. 4 and . 5 . All the expression constructs for these studies employed the caprine b-casein regulatory elements \u017d . DiTullio et al., 1992; Roberts et al., 1992 linked to either genomic or cDNA genes coding for the heavy and light chain sequences.\n\nIn one example, hBR96-2, a humanized IgG1 version of the BR96 anti-LewisY monoclonal antibody developed at Bristol Myers Squibb for anti-\u017d cancer applications Rosok et al., 1996; Tolcher et . al., 1999 was expressed in mice and goats.

It was also shown that the milk produced hBR96-2 antibody has retained full antigen binding properties \u017d . Perry Fell, personal communication .\n\nThe published literature contains a wealth of information concerning the purification of monoclonal \u017d antibodies Prior, 1991; Ransohoff and Levine, 1991; Brooks et al., 1992; Graf et al., 1994; Page and . Thorpe, 1998 . The challenge of monoclonal antibody purification from cell culture is that high volumes of the conditioned culture media needs to be processed due \u017d . to lower expression level usually in the mgrl range . Typical contaminants in serum free media are cell debris, lipids, host DNA, host cell proteins, viruses Monoclonal antibodies produced in the milk of transgenic goats at the relatively modest level of 2 grl represent 7% of the total protein. As the antibody is expressed as a whey protein, standard dairy procedures can be adapted to the initial separation step to achieve a casein-free, fat-free and lactose-free protein concentrate in which the antibody is at 30-60% purity, depending on the expression level. Fat may be separated from milk using standard centrifugal procedures or by membrane filtration. Membrane filtration can be used to eliminate most of the caseins and small molecules. The clarified whey is excellent starting material for chromatographic purification. Alternatively, either whole milk or the whey fraction can be subject to direct capture using expanded or fluidized bed techniques.\n\nThe purification of a recombinant human or humanized antibody from milk involves the separation of endogenous whey proteins from the antibody. The techniques employed vary with the type and class of antibody expressed. They include ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatogra-\u017d phy and affinity chromatography Protein A or Pro-. tein G . Affinity supports from different manufacturers vary and conditions may be found that do separate IgGs of different species. Goat milk contains 0.3-0.5 grl of endogenous caprine Ig which can be separated from the recombinant human or humanized \u017d IgG. In our hands Joseph Kutzko et al., unpub-. lished using a combination of chromatographic steps, human IgG was successfully purified from the clari-\u017d . fied milk of a transgenic goat Fig. 6 . A ) 3 Log 10 reduction of goat IgG is achieved in a single step at a theoretical purity of 99.9% with a yield of 65% for the unoptimized process.\n\nIt is possible to achieve high-level expression of active recombinant immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-fusions in the milk of transgenic animals. Transgenic expression delivers the advantages of mammalian cells such as a sophisticated refolding machinery and glycosylation. Other features of trans-genic productions are scale-up flexibility since herd \u017d . size can be increased or decreased rapidly and inexpensively, as well as the relative low-cost and low complexity of the raw product manufacturing \u017d . facilities farms as compared to more traditional GMP cell culture facilities.\n\nFurther work is underway to fully evaluate the applicability of transgenically produced antibodies to therapeutic needs, in particular, studies of the functionality and pharmacokinetics of the milk-derived recombinant antibodies. It is expected that glycosylation structure of caprine mammary gland-derived antibodies will not be identical to CHO cell-derived material. However, there is very little evidence suggesting that differences in glycosylation resulting from expression in different mammalian host cells significantly influence the behavior of recombinant \u017d . antibodies Bebbington, 1995 . In all cases, where it was examined, antigen binding of milk-expressed antibodies was found to be similar to equivalent mammalian cell culture derived molecules."}
