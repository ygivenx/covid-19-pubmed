{"title": "Pediatric Radiology Continuing Medical Education Activity", "body": "\nOn-line access to the test will be available on the first of the month of the corresponding journal issue and will remain up for 3 years after publication. All paid subscribers to the journal who are also SPR members may access the article and corresponding test on-line.Completion of each test with a score of at least 80% results in the awarding of 1 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit\u2122. Participants will have the opportunity to take each test up to three times, if the first attempt does not result in a passing score. Participants will be provided feedback through e-mail notification to assist in further study prior to taking the test again. If you do not receive an e-mail notice, please contact adavis@acr.org for assistance.Upon completion of this test on-line, you will be required to respond to a short survey required by our CME provider in order to assist us in determining if these activities are meeting your needs. Once you respond to the survey, a CME certificate will be available.Documentation of credits earned for CME tests will be available on the CME Gateway at www.CMEGateway.org/. Results are not posted immediately. It may take up to 60 days for your credits to be reflected, so be sure to retain your e-mails or the certificate provided via the online system as confirmation of your credit.CME certificates will not be mailed.Only examinations completed on-line will be valid for CME credit. Please do not mail or FAX in responses to the questions following the CME article.\n\n\nThis activity has been planned and implemented in accordance with the Essential Areas and Policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education through the joint providership of the American College of Radiology and The Society for Pediatric Radiology. The American College of Radiology is accredited by the ACCME to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\nThe American College of Radiology designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit\u2122. Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\nThe American Medical Association has determined that physicians not licensed in the US who participate in this CME activity are eligible for AMA PRA Category 1 Credit\u2122.\n\nCredits awarded for this enduring activity are designated \u201cSA-CME\u201d by the American Board of Radiology (ABR) and qualify toward fulfilling requirements for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Part II: Lifelong Learning and Self-assessment.\n\n\nRelease Date: February 1, 2015\n\n\nExpiration Date: February 1, 2018\n\nFor technical or general questions regarding the CME activity, contact:\n\nAngela Davis\n\n1-703-648-0680 ext. 4691\n\nadavis@acr.org\n\nFor comments or questions on the content of the CME activity contact:\n\nBrian D.
