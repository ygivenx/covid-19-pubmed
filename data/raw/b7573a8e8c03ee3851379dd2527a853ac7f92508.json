{"title": "Supporting information", "body": "Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed essentially as described previously (16) . Briefly, after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100, an anti-HBc antibody (DAKO, #B0586) was used as the primary antibody.\n\nTo quantify HBs protein by ELISA, microwell antigen capture plates (Maxisorp nunc-immuno plate, Nunc #439454) were prepared by overnight incubation at 4\u02daC with a sheep anti-HBs antibody at 1:5000 dilution, followed by coating with 0.2% BSA/0.02% NaN 3 /1 x PBS at 4\u02daC until use. For HBs detection, samples were incubated in individual wells of the capture plates for 2 h. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-HBs antibody was added for an additional 2 h incubation. The substrate solution (from the HCV core ELISA kit: Ortho) was reacted for 15-60 min before the OD 450 values were measured.\n\nHBV DNA was extracted from cells using a QIAamp mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HBV DNA was quantified by real time PCR analysis using the primer set 5'-ACTCACCAACCTCCTGTCCT-3' and 5'-GACAAACGGGCAACATACCT-3' and probe 5'FAM-TATCGCTGGATGTGTCTGCGGCGT-TAMRA3'.\n\nDetection of cccDNA was achieved using 5'-CGTCTGTGCCTTCTCATCTGC-3' and 5'-GCACAGCTTGGAGGCTTGAA-3' as primers and 5'-CTGTAGGCATAAATTGGT (MGB)-3' as a probe. mRNAs for NTCP, CyPA, CyPB, and GAPDH were detected using a one step RNA PCR kit (Takara) following the manufacturer's protocol. \n\nSouthern blotting was performed as described previously (23).\n\nTo allow HBV attachment to the cells without subsequent internalization, HBV was added \n\nHBV inoculum, prepared as described above, was preincubated with the indicated compounds ( Fig. 2F) for 30 min at 37\u02daC. Each compound-treated HBV inoculum was concentrated from 450 ml to 15 ul via ultrafiltration, followed by dilution to 450 ml with PBS and re-concentration to recover 15 ul of HBV-containing medium. This procedure is expected to result in a 900-fold reduction in compound concentration. The infectivity of the resultant HBV-containing concentrate (10 ml) was evaluated by inoculating HepaRG cells as described above.\n\nThe MTT cell viability assay was performed as described previously (23).\n\nGene expression reporter assays were performed essentially as described \n\nThe HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) assay was essentially performed as previously described (55, 56) . Plasmids used to produce HCVpp, were kindly provided by Dr. Francois-Loic\n\nCosset at University of Lyon.\n\nBinding \n\nHepG2 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for NTCP (25) using TransIT LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). The cells were plated into a 10 cm dish at 4 h posttransfection, and cultured in the presence of G418 1 mg/ml to select plasmid-bearing cells beginning on day 2 posttransfection. After 20 days of growth, individual cell colonies were isolated and expanded. Each cell clone and parental HepG2 cells as a negative control were infected with HBV as described above for HepaRG cells, and cell clones highly susceptible to HBV infection were selected for use in experiments.\n\nNTCP transporter activity (Fig. 5A ) was assayed essentially as described (25, 58) from HepG2-NTCP uptake value.\n\nCrude membrane fractions of HepG2 and HepG2-NTCP cells were prepared as described (60) . For the binding assay, 42.5 mg of crude membrane fraction was mixed with 100 ml of for the assay background that was measured following addition of 200 mM imidazole to each well. The total radioactivity (ccpm) in each well was obtained in the presence of OptiPhase Supermix scintillation cocktail, and used for calculation of ccpm-to-mol of substrate/well.\n\nRecombinant NTCP and HBs proteins were synthesized using a wheat cell-free protein system as described previously (63) (64) (65) . The template for transcription was produced by split-primer PCR using the following primers: a target protein specific primer (5'- \n\nStatistical significance was determined using the Student's t-test.\n\n51.
