The neurotropic strain JHM of the mouse hepatitis \u017d . virus MHV is a murine coronavirus that induces a biphasic retinal disease when injected intraocularly into BALBrc \u017d . mice Robbins et al., 1990 Robbins et al., , 1991 . The early phase of the disease occurs from 1 to 7 days post-inoculation and involves a retinal vasculitis associated with the presence of infectious virus. The late phase of the disease begins at about day 10 post-inoculation and involves retinal degeneration associated with the presence of autoantibodies directed against the neuroretina and the retinal pigmented \u017d . epithelium RPE . Infectious virus, viral antigens, and inflammatory cells are absent during the late phase and virus-neutralizing antibodies are produced during both phases. When CD-1 mice are similarly inoculated, only the \u017d . early phase of the disease is induced Wang et al., 1996 ; antiviral antibodies are produced, but anti-retinal autoanti-\u017d . bodies are not Hooks et al., 1993 . \u017d .

Palade, 1995; Dvorak et al., 1995; Ozaki et al., 1997 , but recent findings show that it is also involved with the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and their \u017d adhesion to the vascular endothelium Barleon et al., 1996;  .

EAU Luna et al., 1997; Vinores et al., 1998a . In these rats, there is inflammatory cell infiltration and an autoim-\u017d . mune reaction with blood-retinal barrier BRB breakdown, but no angiogenesis. Experimental coronavirus \u017d . retinopathy ECOR of murine retinas provides a model with inflammatory cell infiltration in the early phase and an autoimmune reaction in the late phase, when BALBrc mice are used.

This model will be used to determine at what phase BRB breakdown occurs, how extensive it is, and whether it is reversible. The immunohistochemical localization of extravasated albumin is an established method for visualizing the location and extent of sites of BRB \u017d breakdown Vinores, 1995; Vinores et al., 1989 Vinores et al., , 1990b Vinores et al., , . 1994 Vinores et al., , 1995a and it will be used to assess the integrity of the BRB. This model can also provide information as to whether VEGF may play a role in one or both of these phases. Hooks et al., 1993 . Control mice received no treatment.\n\nAt time points ranging from 1 to 62 days post virus-inoculation, a total of 218 BALBrc and 58 CD-1 mice were anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation. The mice are handled according to the ARVO Resolution on the Use of Animals in Research. Eyes are promptly fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry is performed on tissue sections as previously \u017d described Wang et al., 1993 Wang et al., , 2000 Vinores et al., 1995a Vinores et al., ,b, . 1998a Chen et al., 1997 using \n\nIn BALBrc mice, BRB breakdown, assessed by the immunolocalization of extravascular albumin, was not demonstrated in uninjected or mock-injected eyes or in JHM-injected eyes for the first 5 days after inoculation of \u017d . coronavirus Table 1 , Fig. 1A .

Moderate or severe lymphocyte infiltration was demonstrated in 9 of 10 coronavirus-infected CD-1 mouse \u017d . retinas during the acute phase days 6-8 of coronavirus \u017d . infection Figs. 2E,F and 4 , which was accompanied by \u017d . moderate or severe BRB breakdown in all animals Fig. 5 . By 10 days after virus inoculation, the inflammation had subsided and the integrity of the BRB was restored. The retinal architecture appeared normal and infiltrating cells were not observed. Some focal staining for extravascular albumin was demonstrated in two of eight eyes at 20-21 days post-inoculation, one showed staining in the outer retina and one in the inner nuclear layer, but in the \u017d . remaining eyes, the BRB was intact Fig. 1F . BRB breakdown was not seen in BALBrc mice that were uninjected or received mock injections of saline. Focal positivity for extravascular albumin was seen in 1 of 11 untreated CD-1 mice and 1 of 13 CD-1 mice receiving mock saline injections.\n\nVEGF staining in the retinas of coronavirus-injected BALBrc mice was negative or weak and diffuse throughout the retina and did not differ from control or mock-injected animals from 1 to 8 days after virus inoculation. At 10 days after virus inoculation, focally intense staining for VEGF was demonstrated in the outer segments of the photoreceptors in one of two mice. By 20 days, focally intense areas of VEGF positivity were evident in the nerve fiber layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, and \u017d . the outer segments of the photoreceptors Fig. 6A . In control BALBrc mice, VEGF staining was limited to the inner retinal surface and Muller cell processes with som\u00eb \u017d . weak staining in the outer plexiform layer Fig. 6B . In CD-1 mice, constitutive staining for VEGF was somewhat stronger than in BALBrc mice, but except for one of two animals that showed more intense areas of positivity in the retina and RPE 10 days after virus inoculation, the virustreated animals did not show an increase in VEGF staining \u017d . compared to the controls Fig. 6C ,D .\n\nIn BALBrc mice, staining for the VEGF receptor, flk-1, was negative in the retina and RPE in normal and virus-treated animals. Immunoreactivity for the other isotype of VEGF receptor, flt-1, was either absent or very weakly demonstrated in the inner plexiform layer and in the outer segments of the photoreceptors, but there was no correlation with the course of viral infection and no differ- . \u017d . inflammatory cells , and severe ) 200 inflammatory cells .

In addition, staining for TGFb2 was weak or absent in the retinas of BALBrc and CD-1 mice with no differences relating to the course of the virus infection or to the presence or absence of virus.\n\nThe immunolocalization of extravascular albumin has previously been shown to be a reliable means of localizing sites of BRB breakdown, at both the light and electron microscopic level, and it provides insight into the mecha-\u017d nisms of BRB dysfunction in ocular diseases Vinores et al., 1989 Vinores et al., , 1990a Vinores et al., ,b, 1992 Vinores et al., , 1993a Vinores et al., ,b, 1994 Vinores et al., , 1995a Vinores et al., ,b, 1998b  . Luna et al., 1997 . In coronavirus infected BALBrc mouse retinas, the first evidence of vascular leakage occurred 6 days after the inoculation of virus and corresponded to the onset of inflammatory cell infiltration as demonstrated by Mac-1 staining. This is also the time when apoptosis is \u017d . occurring within the retina Wang et al., 2000 . In CD-1 mice, BRB breakdown also coincided with inflammation and both BRB dysfunction and leukocyte infiltration peaked \u017d . during the acute phase of the infection days 6-8 . Albumin extravasation during the acute phase was greater in CD-1 mice than in BALBrc mice, which correlated with a greater extent of leukocyte infiltration in CD-1 mice during this phase. Following the acute phase of infection, there was a decrease in inflammatory cells and virus ( ) \u017d . \u017d . Fig. 6 . VEGF immunoreactivity in ECOR.

BRB breakdown that occurred in the late phase of the infection in BALBrc mice generally corresponded to structural damage related to retinal degenerative disease.\n\nIn rats developing EAU, the marked upregulation of VEGF in the inner retina suggests that it plays a role in the \u017d pathogenesis of the disorder Luna et al., 1997; Vinores et . al., 1997b Vinores et . al., , 1998a . The specific function of VEGF in the progression of EAU is unclear; however, the autoimmune disorder involves BRB breakdown and inflammatory cell infiltration, both of which can be promoted by VEGF. Likewise, with experimental herpesvirus retinopathy, which presents a unique model of a transient inflammatory response in the virus-injected eye and subsequent acute retinal necrosis associated with virus transmission to the \u017d . opposite eye Whittum et al., 1984 , VEGF is upregulated \u017d . in both eyes Vinores et al., 1997a . In the herpesvirus-injected eye, VEGF upregulation coincides with inflammation, with its levels diminishing as the inflammation subsides. In the contralateral eye, VEGF induction coincides with the appearance of virus particles and the onset of inflammatory cell infiltration. In experimental coronavirus infection, VEGF upregulation did not appear to coincide with inflammatory cell infiltration andror the presence of infective virus and no differences were noted in the extent or distribution of VEGF receptors through the course of the disease; therefore, VEGF may not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of experimental coronavirus retinopathy as it does in EAU and experimental herpesvirus retinopathy. The only significant upregulation of VEGF appears late in the course of the disease, when retinal degeneration is occurring, and may result from hypoxia related to the retinal degeneration, since VEGF is \u017d known to be induced under hypoxic conditions Shweiki et al., 1992; Plate et al., 1992; Goldberg and Schneider, 1994; Hashimoto et al., 1994; Minchenko et al., 1994a,b; Levy et al., 1995; Pierce et al., 1995; Vinores et al., . 1997b .\n\nIt is possible that VEGF upregulation may play a role in the retinal degeneration that occurs in the late phase of ECOR in BALBrc mice. The mechanism for this is not clear, but retinal degeneration also occurs in a line of transgenic mice in which VEGF is produced in the photoreceptors under the control of the opsin promoter begin-\u017d . ning approximately on day 7 Okamoto et al., 1997 . Retinal degeneration does not occur in other VEGF transgenic lines or other viral infection models, so a precise level and time of VEGF expression may be critical in promoting retinal degeneration.\n\nOne of the possible contributing factors in the role of VEGF in EAU and herpesvirus retinopathy and its apparent absence in ECOR is the predominant inflammatory cell entering the retina. EAU is characterized by a primary T cell infiltrate and herpesvirus retinopathy is characterized ( ) \u017d by a predominance of T cells and NK cells Tanigawa et . al., 2000 . In contrast, ECOR is characterized by a predominance of monocytes followed by a much smaller T cell infiltrate. Differences in the composition of the cellular infiltrates in these conditions could predispose a different spectrum of soluble factors released, thus accounting for differences in VEGF induction.\n\nVEGF receptors have been identified on monocytes \u017dShen et al., 1993; Barleon et al., 1996; Clauss et al., 1996;  . Sawano et al., 2001 and VEGF can stimulate the activa-\u017d tion and migration of monocytes Clauss et al., 1990 Clauss et al., , . 1996 ; Barleon et al., 1996; Heil et al., 2000 . However, despite the fact that monocytes are the primary infiltrating cell type, VEGF does not appear to promote monocyte \u017d . infiltration in ECOR, since 1 VEGF induction is not \u017d . evident until the inflammation has subsided and 2 VEGF induction is not demonstrated in CD-1 mice despite the fact that the inflammatory response to coronavirus infection in CD-1 mice is even greater than that in BALBrc mice.\n\nIn models such as EAU and experimental herpesvirus retinopathy, in which VEGF is upregulated early during the course of the disorder, TGFb2 has been postulated to inhibit the angiogenic activity of VEGF, accounting for the \u017d absence of neovascularization Vinores et al., 1997a Vinores et al., , . 1998a . Neovascularization also does not occur in ECOR, but without the upregulation of VEGF, an angiogenesis inhibitor may not be necessary to inhibit vascular growth. Thus, there are no differences in the expression of TGFb2 relative to the course of the disease, suggesting that TGFb2 is unlikely to play a role in its pathogenesis.\n\nIn summary, BRB breakdown was observed in the acute inflammatory phase of ECOR in both retinal degeneration \u017d . susceptible BALBrc and retinal degeneration resistant \u017d . CD-1 mice. In comparison to BALBrc mice, the CD-1 mouse BRB breakdown was more extensive and correlated with an enhanced inflammatory response. The findings indicate that BRB breakdown correlates directly with inflammatory cell infiltration and not with retinal degeneration in both sensitive and resistant strains. This study clearly demonstrates that although VEGF plays a basic role in the development of EAU and herpes simplex retinitis, it is not involved in the pathogenic processes in ECOR. Its upregulation, only in mice undergoing retinal \u017d degeneration BALBrc mice after the acute inflammatory . response , suggests that VEGF induction may be a secondary change related to retinal degeneration, rather than to inflammation or viral infection. Moreover, the lack of upregulation of VEGF in ECOR may be one of the factors which allows the CD-1 mouse retina to return to a normal appearance after the acute disease."}
