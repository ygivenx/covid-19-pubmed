{"title": "Supplementary webappendix Supplementary Material Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Quantifying the extent of the epidemic, surveillance biases and transmissibility thus far", "body": "As of 8 August 2013, 94 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) many of whom have been described in either case or cluster reports . A line list was compiled using publically reported data on laboratoryconfirmed MERS-CoV cases from a number of sources including WHO, ProMed and in the peer-reviewed literature . An additional 17 probable cases have been reported from investigations 6, 8, 21, 23 . Using these sources, the following data were extracted into the line list shown in Table S1 ; reporting date either by WHO or to ProMed, symptom onset, age, gender, country where case was identified, nationality and sub-nationality of case, location where infection is believed to have occurred, whether the case was exported to a country outside of the Middle East, country where case was treated, severity of disease, patient outcome, exposure information (i.e., recent travel history to the Middle East and duration of travel, reported animal exposures, if case was a health care worker), co-morbid conditions, and genetic sequencing resulted from any patient samples. A cluster identification number was assigned to cases with specific reported epidemiologic-links and to those reported as being part of clusters.\n\nWe define the \"index case\" as the case with earliest symptom onset in the cluster. The \"primary case\" is the first case detected in the cluster (not necessarily the index case). \n\nTo estimate the incubation period, detailed information on the exposure of secondary cases to the index case, in the absence of other potential exposures, was extracted from published description of traveler-related clusters reported from France 5 , the United Kingdom 10 , Italy 21 and Tunisia 22 (Table S2) . Precise exposure and onset dates are not publically available for the Tunisia cluster but exposure windows for secondary cases have been reported. The advantage of restricting our analysis to secondary cases caused by recent travelers to affected countries is that the source of infection can be more reliably determined than for cases arising in affected countries such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn addition, the Al-Ahsa cluster in Saudi Arabia provides substantial information; we deliberately do not use those data in estimating the incubation period distribution here in order to generate a second independent estimate to be compared with existing estimates derived from analysis of that cluster 21 .\n\nWe fitted the following probabilistic distributions to the data: Gamma, Log-Normal, Weibull.\n\nThe distribution with the best Akaike Information Criterion is presented in the manuscript. \n\nWe consider clusters of probable and confirmed cases. Six clusters (clusters 2, 4, 7, 12, 13, 18 had more than 1 case with information on the date of symptom onset. In the Al Hasa cluster (cluster 12), the second case of the cluster (case B, 21 ) is believed to have been infected in the community and is therefore excluded from this analysis. The delay between symptom onset in the first and the second case is given in Table S3 .\n\nWe fitted the following probabilistic distributions to the data: Gamma, Log-Normal, Weibull. The distribution with the best Akaike Information Criterion is presented in the manuscript. A recent study estimated the mean serial interval to be 7.6 days 21 . However, this value was derived from a large case cluster in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia, where infection control measures were intensified within two weeks of the detection of the outbreak, the effect of which would be to bias the observed serial intervals to be shorter than would be seen in the absence of control measures. The advantage of restricting our analysis to secondary cases caused by recent travellers to affected countries is that the source of infection can be more reliably determined than for cases arising in affected countries such as Saudi Arabia. It also provides a second independent estimate to be compared with the existing one 21 . Because the discovery of an index case prompts enhanced surveillance in contacts of that case, the timing of first detected cases of clusters presented in Table S4 is likely more representative of the relative magnitude of the epidemic over time than the incidence of cases.\n\nWe fit simple non-homogeneous Poisson processes to these data to investigate how the risk \n\nWe consider different models that are fitted to the data by maximum likelihood with 95% confidence intervals derived using a profile likelihood. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used for model comparison.\n\nIn model M 0 , we assume the risk of cluster occurrence/detection is invariant with time Table S5 gives the estimates. On the basis of AIC, these data provide strong support for Models 1 and 2 over Model 0. Model 2 appears to be marginally better than model 1 although a sudden 10 fold rise in reporting at the end of April seems to be an extreme scenario. Denoting r the exponential growth rate, the doubling time is\n\nFurthermore, assume that the epidemic is driven by human-to-human transmission and that the generation time has a Gamma distribution with mean \uf06d and standard deviation\uf073 .\n\nThere is the following relationship between the reproduction number R, the exponential growth rate r and parameters of the Gamma distribution ( 22 a \uf06d\uf073 \uf03d\n\nAs a sensitivity analysis, we estimate the reproduction number from the growth in incident cases. We obtain estimates equal to 1.08 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.09) for T G =12 days and 1.04 (1.03, 1.05) T G =7 days, i.e. similar to those presented in the manuscript, which are based on incident clusters.\n\nEstimates of R cluster are derived from the distribution of cluster sizes (Table S4) using on standard branching process theory. We denote the length of a chain of transmission by L. Following Lloyd-Smith el al 25 , the offspring distribution (i.e. number of persons infected by a case) is modelled with a Negative Binomial distribution with mean R and overdispersion parameter k (parameter k characterizes case-to-case variation in infectiousness). The probability that a chain is of length L is given by 26 :\n\nWe assume k=1 and calculate maximum likelihood estimates of R cluster . Ninety five percent profile likelihood confidence intervals are also calculated.\n\nWe derive the reproduction number of the index case (i.e. the case with the earliest date of symptom onset) in each cluster, based on an estimate of the number of cases that were in the second generation of the cluster.\n\nWe restrict the analysis to clusters with complete information on symptom onset dates and with a first symptom onset date before 1 June 2013. This is a time period when 93% (13 of 14) of delays from onset to reporting of cluster were \u226516 days. In single case clusters, we assume R index =0. In clusters with more than 2 cases and for whom dates of symptom onset are available, we use standard statistical methods (see Wallinga and Teunis, 27 ) to probabilistically reconstruct the transmission tree and derive the reproduction number of the index case for T g =12 days and T g =7 days. Among the 12 clusters with complete onset information and a first date of onset before 1 June 2013, 6 are single case clusters and 6 have at least 1 secondary case. Table S6 presents estimates of R index for the 6 clusters with at least 1 secondary case with complete onset information.\n\nIn a sensitivity analysis, we provide a conservative estimate of R index based on all clusters including those with incomplete onset information, with estimated symptom onset before 1 June 2013. In single case clusters, we know that R index =0 even if the onset date is missing. But estimation of R index for larger clusters requires the timing of symptoms onset 27 . We cannot simply exclude these clusters from analysis as this would bias estimates downward. In 2 clusters (Tunisian cluster 16 and Italian cluster 19), dates of symptoms onset are unavailable but there is good epidemiological evidence that the index case infected the 2 secondary cases 14 . We therefore assume R index =2 in these 2 clusters. For 2 other clusters with missing data on onset dates (cluster 8 and cluster 10), we are conservative and assume that R index was equal to 1. There are 5 single case clusters with missing onset dates for which we assume R index =0. We obtain R index =1.00 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.14) for T G =12 days and R index =0.76 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.90) for T G =7 days. Clusters 8 and 10 had size 7 and 4, respectively. Assuming that Rindex was equal to 2 in these clusters, the estimate would become 1.10 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.24) T G =12 days and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.00) for T G =7 days. ) is removed from the analysis R=4.87 [2, 8] for T G =12 day and R=2.75 [1, 5] for T G =7 days. Figure S1 ). (Table S8 ). These were used to calculate domestic person-days at risk (per annum) by multiplying these numbers by 365.\n\nThe person-days at risk for returning non-resident travellers were estimated by multiplying the number of inbound overnight tourist arrivals per annum (in 2011, excluding those from the Middle East) by the average length of stay (estimated to be 4.0 days for inbound tourists visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2011 -World Tourism Organisation, 2012). The numbers of inbound overnight tourist arrivals in 2011 were as given in Table S8 .\n\nWe restricted our analysis to travellers from outside the Middle East to ensure we avoided confusing travel-related infections with locally transmitted infections. The data from World Tourism Organization did not exclude those who travelled on pilgrimages. However, this depends crucially on the assumed average length of stay. It is worth noting that the average was estimated to be 2.0 days for inbound tourists visiting Jordan in 2011 (World Tourism Organisation, 2012). However, as Saudi Arabia is has so many more inbound tourists than Jordan, the Saudi Arabia mean (4.0 days) is more indicative of the region as a whole. Table S9 shows the dependence of estimate on the assumed average length of stay as well as the upper and lower confidence limits based on the Poisson-likelihood-based 95% confidence bounds for the underlying rate of cases among returning non-resident travellers. These bounds do not incorporate uncertainty in either the country population sizes nor in the numbers of inbound tourists. These could be subdivided into the separate countries based on the proportion of inbound tourist arrivals to the four countries in total that were to a particular country (Table S10) . Although this is a simple approximation to a complex system, it yields useful estimates for cases in the affected Middle Eastern countries comparable to the four diagnosed among returning non-resident travellers. In particular, these estimates do not include mild cases that would not have warranted testing had they occurred in returning non-resident travellers. This does not allow for the fact that some comparable cases might well have occurred among returning non-resident travellers that returned to countries that do not test for MERS-CoV regardless of health status and travel history. It implicitly assumes that the per-day risk of infection of domestic citizens and returning non-resident travelers are the same. Of course, returning non-resident travelers might well have a higher or lower per-day risk than the domestic population, depending on the route(s) of transmission and any within-country regional variation in risk.\n\nAs a sensitivity analysis, Table S11 gives the country-specific estimates for Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, based on 3 cases identified among returning nonresident travellers to Middle Eastern countries (i.e. excluding the most recent such case identified in a returning non-resident travellers who visited Jordan). \n\nWe illustrate the balance between animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission under different assumptions about the human-to-human reproduction number using a parsimonious mathematical model, with discrete generations. We fit the model jointly to two epidemiological data, the timing of clusters (that inform growth rates) and the exported cases (that inform the cumulated number of cases), for different values of R 0 .\n\nWe model infection in an animal host that is assumed to seed infections into humans. the model jointly to the data for different values of R and for generation times of 12 and 7 days. We use 3,000 particles and 30,000 MCMC iterations per run, with a burn in of 500 and derive the posterior distribution of parameters as well as the reconstructed trajectories of human infections due to the animal host and those due to human-to-human transmissions. We use the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) for model comparison 29 . Smaller values of the DIC indicate a better fit. A difference of 5 DIC units is considered to be substantial. \n\nThere are currently nine publicly available full-length MERC-CoV sequences. We also include in our analysis a sequence generated from a viral isolate of a patient diagnosed in France, who had previously travelled and presumably been infected in Dubai. France-UAE/1627/2013 2013-05-07 13 *The first English isolate was sequenced twice, by Public Health England (formerly HPA) with accession number KC16505 and once at the Wellcome Trust Sanger institute (KC667074), which is the sequence included here 30 . **http://www.hpa.org.uk/ webc/HPAwebFile/HPAwebC/1317138176202 ***The sequence of the isolate Hu/France-UAE/1627/2013 (Dubai/France 1) patient was generated at the Pasteur Institute in Paris using Sanger sequencing, essentially as described 31 and will be posted on Genbank as this paper is published.\n\nIn aligning these sequences, UTRs were ignored as they could be problematic to assemble, and inter-genic spacers as they were conserved. Coding regions were aligned using Muscle to produce an in-frame alignment.\n\nDifferent substitution models were tested using jModelTest v2.1.3, and we report only values for common models (TN93, GTR and HKY). TN93  TN93+\u0393  TN93+I  TN93+I+\u0393  HKY  GTR  HKY+\u0393  GTR+\u0393  HKY+I  GTR+I  HKY+I+\u0393  GTR+I+\u0393   41936  41932  41936  41932  41948  41928  41945  41924  41948  41928  41945  41924   17  18  18  19  16  20  17  21  17  21  18  22   84047  84049  84057  84059  84062  84062  84064  84064  84072  84072  84074  84074 Based on this analysis, we use the TN93 substitution model for our main analysis, and perform sensitivity analysis to this choice below, with the HKY and GTR models, and also the SRD06 model, which allows for different substitution rates at third base positions in codons.\n\nThe maximum likelihood phylogeny was estimated using PhyML with the TN93 model, with 1,000 bootstrap iterations. Within this tree, we highlight in red a clade from within which all recent samples were drawn. Given the topology of the tree, we hypothesise that this clade is more likely to include samples from an outbreak of sustained human-to-human transmission, and that the other two sequences not in this clade were independent zoonotic introductions. This hypothesis could only be proved with identification and extensive sampling of the animal reservoir for this new virus. \n\nFor all further modelling and hypothesis testing, we include only one sequence from the Al-Hasa outbreak (Al-Hasa 1, the most recent) as these are not independent from each other. We find very strong evidence of clock-like evolution, which supports the use of a molecular clock analysis. Figure S7 . Tree with highest correlation between root-to-tip distance and calendar time.\n\nThe tree shown in Figure S7 gives the highest possible correlation between root-to-tip distance and calendar time, as illustrated by the regression shown in Figure S8 . Figure S8 . Regression of root-to-tip distance against calendar time for tree shown in Figure  S7 .\n\nFor this tree, the correlation between calendar time and root-to-tip distance tree is high (R 2 =83%) with an estimated molecular clock rate of 1.50 \u00d710 \u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 2.02 \u00d710 \u22123 ), and an estimate of the TMRCA of mid 2011.\n\nHowever, we note that the choice of root for this tree need not be based on the highest correlation of root-to-tip distance and time. There is alternative rooting of the tree that fits the data well, and gives a lower estimate of the clock rate. The alternative choice of root for the tree is shown in Figure S9 . This choice minimizes the sum of square residuals in the regression between root-to-tip distance in the tree and calendar time, as illustrated by the regression shown in Figure S10 . Figure S9 .\n\nFor this choice of tree, the correlation between the root-to-tip distance in this tree is moderate (R 2 =49%) and suggests instead an estimate of the molecular clock rate of 0.49 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.85 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ).\n\nThe first choice of root for the tree seems more consistent with epidemiological evidence, given the first human case was reported in early 2012. Both choices of clock rate are broadly consistent with estimates from other coronaviruses and in particular the 2003 SARS epidemic. At this stage, it is not possible to definitively root the tree. This would likely require other early samples, or identification and sampling of the source animal reservoir. Molecular evolutionary rates have been estimated for a few different coronaviruses for complete genomes or subgenomic regions. Probably the most pertinent estimate would be for the other known beta coronavirus in humans, SARS-CoV. But here there is also a disparity in rate estimates from 4\u00d710 \u22124 for the large and relatively conserved ORF1ab open reading frame 32 to 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 based on complete genomes 33 .\n\nBased on epidemiological plausibility, we focus on the estimate of 1.5 \u00d710 \u22123 per site per year in our main analysis, and perform an extensive sensitivity analysis to this choice of clock.\n\nWe focus on the recent clade of the virus, and so work with an alignment of five virus sequences, highlighted in red in the trees above. The rooting of this clade is unambiguous when considered in the light of the earlier sequences, and so we enforce this rooting in the analysis of the highlighted in-group.\n\nWe use BEAST 34 to estimate the dated phylogeny and the changing population size, using exponential population change for the coalescent model. We use a fixed value of the strict molecular clock. As a sensitivity analysis, we vary it between 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 in increments of 10 \u22124 substitutions per site per year. We use the TN93 substitution model, but consider other models in a sensitivity analysis. We use a coalescent model with an exponentially changing population size. We assume a very broad and symmetric prior for the exponential rate of change, r (prior is normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 100 per year). We assign all other priors to the default values used by BEAST (v1.7.4). Using a fixed clock, convergence of the MCMC chains was excellent. We emphasise that it is not a prior assumption that the infected population is growing, since the population size parameter and the rate of exponential change parameters are independent. Figure S11 shows the estimates dated phylogeny drawn from the posterior distribution (maximum clade credibility), based on the substitution rate of 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 Figure S11 . Time resolved phylogeny of the recent clade of 5 samples.\n\nPosterior estimates of the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and of the exponential growth rate are output from BEAST. The posterior distribution of the basic reproduction number R 0 are obtained by noting that in a growing epidemic, R 0 is related to 1000 the growth rate r and the generation time distribution by R 0 = M (\u2212r) \u22121 , where M is the moment generation function of the generation time distribution 35 . We assume a Gamma distributed generation time with mean Tg and shape coefficient \u03b1, so that R 0 (r)=(1+rT g /\u03b1) \u03b1 . In our baseline scenarios we assume that T g is 12 days and the coefficient of variation consistent with that of SARS (mean over standard deviation) of 0.45, corresponding to \u03b1=4.94 36 . Under these assumptions we obtain the following posterior distributions shown in Figure S12 . \n\nWe use two methods to estimate population sizes. Population sizes in BEAST, N B , are reported in units of effective population size in coalescent time, i.e. the population size is N B = N e \u00d7 T g where N e is the effective population size and T g is the generation time. The effective population size N e is related to the census population size N by a further transformation. Assuming a negative binomial offspring distribution and nearly neutral evolution, then the relationship between the effective population size and the actual population size is given by N 1 (t c ) = N B R 0 (R 0 + k)/(kT g ) 37, 38 , where t c is the current time. The population size at any other time is given by N 1 (t) = N 1 (t c ) exp[r (t \u2212 t c )]. In estimating N 1 , we assume by default that k = 1. An alternative, and simpler, way to estimate the number infected is as N 2 (t) = exp[r (t \u2212 t 0 )] where r is the growth rate, t 0 is the estimated TMRCA. Ideally, these estimates should be very similar if the epidemic has started from a single case and if estimates of T g and k are accurate, but this consistency is not enforced in BEAST. We report both values. More specifically, we report the estimates of the cumulative number of people infected, i. 9.6 Sensitivity analyses 9.6.1 Sensitivity analysis to the choice of rooting As mentioned above, there are two plausible rootings for the tree of all ten MERS-CoV viruses, which yield two different estimates of the clock rate of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 per site per year, respectively. As no cases were reported prior to 2012, we judge the faster estimate to be somewhat more plausible, but neither can be ruled out. Here, we present results for the alternative substitution rate of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The time-resolved MCC tree for the slower alternative (5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) is shown in Figure S14 . Table S14 summarises sensitivity of our estimates to the assumed clock rate. Table S14 . Estimates of TMRCA, R 0 and the cumulative number of infections calculated by method 2 (see text) as a function of the assumed clock rate.\n\nWe show the inter-quartile range (IQR) for estimates of the number infected, as the 95% credibility intervals are extremely wide, reflecting the fact that the genetic analysis is only moderately informative with respect to this quantity.\n\nTable S15 summarises sensitivity of our estimates to the assumed mean generation time.\n\n9.6.4 Table S15 . Sensitivity of genetic estimates to mean generation time, T g , keeping coefficient of variation of the generation time distribution constant. ). The increased estimate as k decreases, reflects the fact that lower k implies a greater fraction of people who infect no-one, and thus while infected do not contribute to the effective infectious population and hence observed viral evolution.\n\nAll of the analyses were repeated with the HKY, GTR and SRD06 model instead of theTN93 model. Dependence on the choice of substitution model was found to be minimal (Table  S16) . \n\nAfter the review of this paper was complete, Cotten et al 39 published an extensive analysis of viral sequences collected from Saudi Arabia, and the sequences were made publicly available on GenBank. Here, we describe an updated version of our phylodynamic analysis which includes these latest sequences. In updating the analysis, we include only one representative of the 19 sequences collected from the large Al-Hasa outbreak, since the coalescent model used to estimate population dynamics assumes the sample being analysed is randomly drawn from the infected population. Because of the controversy surrounding the EMC/2012 and the Bisha_1_2012 sequences 39 , we exclude both from our analysis.\n\nThe results of the revised systematic comparison of substitution models are given in Table  S17 . Increased number of parameters compared to Table S13 reflects more branch lengths to optimise in the estimation of the tree (# params = # substitution rates + #branch lengths). Compared to the previous analysis, the data are now better fitted with models with Gamma rate variation between sites, so the revised list of favoured models used in the analysis are the TN93+G, HKY+G, GTR+G. Here, we focus on the TN93+G model (with four rate categories for Gamma rate variation). The resulting maximum likelihood tree is shown in Figure S16 . The regression of root-to-tip distance on calendar time is shown in Figure S17 , which shows a slight increase in the estimated clock rate, from 1.5x10 -3 per site per year for the previous analysis, to 1.8x10 -3 per site per year here. As in the earlier analysis, there is more than one well supported position for the root of the phylogeny, and the regression analysis of the alternative rooting is shown in Figure S18 . This also shows an increase in the clock rate estimate, from 4.9x10 -4 previously to 9.4x10 -4 substitutions per site per year here, with a TMRCA in late 2010. We find below that this latter estimate is the most consistent with a new in-depth analysis of the ingroup. We updated the phylodynamic analysis with BEAST 34 to estimate the dated phylogeny and the changing population size, using identical similar assumptions to our previous analysis, with one important modification. As we had more data, we estimated the clock rate rather than assuming fixed values and varying over a fixed range. We assumed a strict clock, and chose an (improper) clock rate with uniform distribution on [0,\u221e[. As before, convergence of the MCMC chains was excellent. We emphasise that it is not a prior assumption that the infected population is growing, since the population size parameter and the rate of exponential change parameters are independent. Figure S19 shows the estimates dated phylogeny drawn from the posterior distribution (maximum clade credibility). The estimates of the clock rate are presented in Figure S20 . The posterior median estimate is 1.0x10 -3 substitutions per site per year (95% credibility interval 6.8x10 -4 -1.3x10 -3 ). This compares to estimates by Cotten et al 39 , who find 6.3x10 -4 (95% credibility interval 1.4x10 -4 -1.1x10 -3 ). Differences in the central estimates may be the result of our inclusion of the new UAE|Dubai|France sequence which is relatively distant from the root, and exclusion of the controversial Bisha_1 sequence, which is relatively close to the root. These estimates are consistent, in that their credible intervals are highly overlapping. The updated results from the population dynamics are shown in Figures S21 and S22 and Table S18. In all cases updated estimates are consistent with previous estimates, but with reduced uncertainty. "}
