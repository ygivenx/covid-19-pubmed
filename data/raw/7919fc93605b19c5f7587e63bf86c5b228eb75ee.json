{"title": "Update on Emerging Infections: News From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "body": "Recent outbreaks of infectious diseases have revealed significant health care system vulnerabilities and highlighted the importance of rapid recognition and isolation of patients with potentially severe infectious diseases. During December 2015 to May 2016, a series of unannounced \"mystery patient drills\" was carried out to assess New York City emergency departments' (EDs') abilities to identify and respond to patients with communicable diseases of public health concern. Drill scenarios presented a patient reporting signs or symptoms and travel history consistent with possible measles or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Evaluators captured key infection control performance measures, including time to patient masking and isolation. Ninetyfive drills (53 measles and 42 MERS) were conducted in 49 EDs, with patients masked and isolated in 78% of drills. Median time from entry to masking was 1.5 minutes (range 0 to 47 minutes); from entry to isolation, 8.5 minutes (range 1 to 57 minutes). Hospitals varied in their ability to identify potentially infectious patients and implement recommended infection control measures in a timely manner. Drill findings were used to inform hospital improvement planning to more rapidly and consistently identify and isolate patients with a potentially highly infectious disease.\n\nExercises were designed in accordance with the US Department of Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program. 1 Scenarios were developed in collaboration with a stakeholder advisory group and consisted of a person simulating a patient entering the ED and reporting recent fever and either respiratory symptoms and recent travel to the Middle East (ie, possible MERS) or a rash after traveling to Europe (ie, possible measles). A red maculopapular measleslike rash was simulated on the neck or upper extremities of the person in the role of the measles patient with a commercially available moulage kit. Based on previously provided ED guidance, 2 the expectation was that once the patient was identified as being at high risk for having a communicable disease with a potential for respiratory transmission, he or she would be asked to don a mask and would be placed into an airborne infection isolation room.\n\nAll 50 New York City hospitals with EDs that participate in the 911 system and receive Hospital Preparedness Program funding through the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response were offered the opportunity to participate in the program; 49 agreed to take part. Exercises were conducted with a simulated patient (who served as the exercise controller), an evaluator, and up to 2 hospital employees (serving as trusted agents) who helped coordinate the visit. No other hospital staff members were informed of the drill. The controller entered the ED unannounced and, when prompted by ED staff members, reported signs or symptoms consistent with the exercise scenario. The evaluator entered the ED separately with one of the trusted agents and remained there during the exercise to collect data with a standardized exercise evaluation guide. The controller ended the exercise after the initial evaluation by a health care provider. Exercises were terminated and considered failed if ED wait time exceeded 30 minutes without triage. The following outcomes were evaluated: (1) compliance with key infection control measures, including staff member hand hygiene, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, and infection prevention signage; (2) association between screening interventions (eg, travel screening) and implementation of infection control measures; and (3) key quantitative measures, including time from entry of the patient until triage, until donning a mask, and until isolation. The exercise was considered successful (ie, \"passed\") if the patient was given a mask and isolated from other patients and staff members. At the conclusion of the drill, exercise staff members facilitated a debriefing with all the drill participants, including the facility trusted agents. Descriptive analyses and c 2 tests for association were performed with statistical software, with P<.05 considered to be statistically significant. Variable specific analyses of times excluded drills with missing time stamp data. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the percentage of simulated MERS and measles patients who received a mask (93% versus 85%) or were isolated (83% versus 77%). Nineteen of 49 hospitals (39%) failed at least 1 drill. Masking and isolation occurred in 88% of drills (71 of 81) when travel history was obtained compared with only 21% (3 of 14) when such history was not obtained (P<.001). The median time from patient entry to triage was 1 minute for both scenarios. The median time from patient entry to masking was 1 minute in the measles scenario and 2 minutes in the MERS scenario, and from patient entry to isolation was 8 minutes in the measles scenario and 11 minutes in the MERS scenario.\n\nAssessment of other infection control practices found that 36% of staff members performed personal hand hygiene and 16% instructed patients to perform hand hygiene. In the 76 drills (80%) that resulted in the patient's being isolated, precaution signage was posted outside the patient's airborne isolation room in 53 (70%), and staff members used recommended personal protective equipment when entering these rooms in 56 drills (74%).\n\nEDs and their associated waiting areas have been shown to facilitate the transmission of infections, such as measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome, to patients and health care workers, leading to spread within hospitals and surrounding communities. 3, 4 This mystery patient drill program provided an opportunity to examine actual implementation of infectious disease-related screening and isolation of potentially high-risk patients in EDs across New York City. It also provided a reasonable baseline for expectations of ED staff member practices in regard to control of highly infectious diseases at this entry point to the hospital system. Based on these findings, performance goals of 1 minute from entry to masking and 10 minutes from entry to isolation will be adopted for evaluating similar drills in the future. In addition, the overall median time from entry to isolation achieved in this study (8.5 minutes) is comparable to times achieved in an earlier Ebola drill analysis (9 minutes). 5 Although the majority of drills were completed successfully by masking and isolating the patient, approximately 40% of hospitals failed at least one drill, and there was considerable variation in the length of time each hospital took to perform these steps. It is possible that measles cases were recognized to be an infectious risk more quickly because the rash was a clearer objective finding. However, the higher percentage of mask provision and patient isolation in MERS scenarios suggests that a history of travel to the Middle East might be more recognizable as a high-risk exposure than history of travel to Germany in the measles scenario; it was noted on multiple drill reports that staff members were unsure whether travel to Europe constituted a risk. The finding that masking and isolation occurred significantly more frequently in situations in which a travel history had been elicited suggests that routinely inquiring about recent travel could prevent exposures to infectious patients at critical entry points to the health care system.\n\nAnother important finding was suboptimal adherence to key infection control practices, including hand hygiene (36%), personal protective equipment use (74%), and posting of isolation signage (70%), highlighting the need for routine competency-based infection control training programs.\n\nSimulated patient exercises have been demonstrated to be effective tools to evaluate hospital emergency plans, 6 and studies have validated their use for testing health care system preparedness for communicable diseases of public health concern, including Ebola, avian influenza, inhalation anthrax, and smallpox. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of unannounced mystery patient drills to test ED preparedness for MERS Volume 71, no. 1 : January 2018\n\nAnnals of Emergency Medicine 41 and measles. Whereas other studies have described specific infection control interventions, such as patient masking, 7 isolation, 9 and risk-factor screening, 8 this study is unique in its use of drills to capture both key temporal measures and staff member compliance with multiple infection control practices.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, exercise evaluation was limited to items that were under direct control of the staff members who participated in the drill, the controller, and the evaluator. Factors such as ED patient volume and staffing levels could potentially influence performance on a given day, but these were not evaluated. Second, controllers were not able to objectively present all signs of illness (eg, fever, chills), and the moulage used to simulate a measles rash might have been misleading or unconvincing, although this information was not captured in the drill reports.\n\nUnannounced mystery patient drills were successfully used to evaluate communicable disease response capabilities in the acute care setting in 49 New York City hospital EDs. As part of this program, a toolkit was developed to help hospitals carry out similar infectious disease drills to test protocols and identify areas for improvement. Use of standardized scenarios, evaluation guides, and reporting templates can assist public health officials in assessing systemwide capabilities and gaps to guide interventions, and inform development of training resources to improve health care facility readiness at a critical point of entry into the health care system.
