{"title": "The Chinese Real Estate Bubble: Is It an Opportunity for Short Selling?", "body": "In early 2010, certain prominent investors in the West, known as \"global bears,\" were forecasting that China was undergoing a massive bubble in real estate similar to that already experienced by the United States. Notable among these short sellers is Jim Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, and U.K. hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry. An influential negative report entitled China's Investment Boom: Great Leap into the Unknown on China produced by Monaco-based Pivot Capital Management (2009) received widespread attention in the investing community.\n\nThe basic arguments of Pivot are:\n\n1. China's export model has stalled thanks to recession in the U.S. and European economies. Pressure to revalue the renminbi against the U.S. dollar will make things worse for China's exports. 2. China is overinvesting in real estate, basic materials, and infrastructure. 3. The 31% expansion of Chinese bank loans in 2009 was bound to result in a misallocation of capital, asset bubbles, and a rise in nonperformers.\n\nAdding to the negative story, Northwestern University political science professor Victor Shih (2010) provided estimates of significant borrowings by entities controlled by local authorities. If Shih's estimates are correctand the government now seems to be conceding that he is at least partly right-it would suggest that China's public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio is probably 30% higher than conventional estimates and a definite problem for Chinese banks.\n\nThe global bears have advocated shorting stocks with exposure to China and Chinese real estate in particular. We make the following points.\n\n1. The ruling Communist Party in China today bases its fundamental legitimacy on its success in producing an ever-increasing standard of living for its citizens. Current government policies taken to cool off the residential real estate sector have probably already gone too far and are likely to be partly reversed. Residential sales as of early June in 2010 have reportedly dropped dramatically as the result of restrictive government measures put in place. Restrictive policies were implemented not just for macro reasons of preventing overheating but also because of fears of discontent on the part of the average citizen who felt priced out of the market by speculators. The government faces a difficult tightrope of trying to cool the high end of residential housing without overly damaging the economy. negative real interest rates on bank deposits have caused many wealthy Chinese to view owning real estate as they would tangible assets such as gold, which do not produce cash flows. This makes vacancy rates more difficult to interpret than in a U.S. context. Some residential unit purchasers do not expect to live in or rent out their properties. Anecdotal reports suggest a large number of high-end apartments without water and electricity in major cities. Vacancy rates as high as 40% have been reported for some of the major cities and resort areas. The threatened imposition of property taxes-unknown in China at present-would radically change the economics of luxury properties. The most likely scenario is that these taxes, if imposed, will be confined to the high end. 5. The bulls argue that the continuous migration of people from the countryside and China's recent record of rapidly increasing personal incomes may bail out real estate and infrastructure capacity that is put in place before demand actually materializes. China will \"grow into\" its current oversupply of real estate and infrastructure. Global bears are arguing that the number of Chinese yet to move to the cities is actually considerably smaller than is realized and that China is far more urbanized than is widely realized. They further argue that in any case the average Chinese cannot afford the high-end luxury apartments being built. Millions of in-migrant poor people do not make for solid demand for high-end properties. 6. It has been argued that comparisons of house price/income ratios can be misleading due to China's one-child policy. When a first-time home-buying couple buys an apartment, it is often said that six people are buying: the couple and both sets of parents. Global bears dismiss this type of \"China is different\" argument.\n\n7. If the current residential market statistics are murky in China, those for commercial real estate are absolutely opaque. Global bears point to the existence of large amounts of empty office space in China based usually on personal observation (see, for instance, Hendry, 2009). The U.S. Case-Shiller index is a very reliable indicator in that it adjusts for housing quality and size, the general level of inflation, and is a national home price index. As observed in Figure \n\nAPPLY TO CHINA?\n\nThe general pattern of real estate bubbles has been one of a rapid rise in real estate values financed by bank debt. When asset values reach extreme values, bubbles burst due to some government action to restrain the process, resulting in a plunge of asset values. Borrowers suffer financial distress as they find themselves in a negative equity position as the value of their mortgages begins to substantially exceed the value of their houses. Banks in turn experience rising nonperforming loans and, in many cases, become insolvent with a significant recession always ensuing. Versions of this model have been put forth by economist Hyman Minsky and financial historian Charles Kindleberger and Aliber (2005) . 1 Further research summarized by Rogoff and Reinhart (2009) China equities and commodities at J.P. Morgan Jill Ulrich (2010) states in the South China Morning Post that the property sector accounted for 21% of Chinese bank loans in 2009. In the article she seems not to be unduly disturbed by real estate price increases in China, but loans classified as real estate may not be the entire story. Shih (2010) has estimated that banks have lent some RMB 11 trillion (US$1.4 trillion) to local government entities, most of this occurring in 2009. If a substantial portion of this has found its way into real estate, then the picture changes. These entities, rather than private individuals or companies, may be significant real estate borrowers.\n\nOur tentative conclusion is that the Minsky-Kindleberger model does describe what is happening in China today, although it might make a difference from a macroeconomic perspective if a substantial portion of future defaulters are government entities rather than individuals. The bubble in China has come quickly, mostly during 2009 and the first 5 months of 2010. Most likely many observers are assuming that the government would bail out the banks if the need arose. From the perspective of a short seller, the crucial question is: where is China in the Minsky-Kindleberger model's time line? Is the peak still ahead or has China, in a relatively short time period, managed to produce a debt-driven real estate bubble that is now near its peak? Government authorities are aware of the bubble and, as mentioned, have taken measures to slow it down, something that Minsky and Kindleberger might have approved. However, have the authorities' actions come in time or are they the straw that is breaking the bubble's back? Are they ignoring the root cause of the problem, which lies in an excessively expansive monetary policy and negative real interest rates? What about a failure to revalue the renminbi in 2009? The revaluation in real terms is taking place via inflation, especially asset inflation, in China.\n\nSince Approximately 100 Chinese American depositary receipts (ADRs) trade in the United States and they can all be shorted, although liquidity issues may make shorting difficult in some of these firms. In addition, a significant portion of Chinese ADRs are in the technology sector. However, Chinese banks, real estate firms, and commodity companies, which may be of more interest as short sales at this juncture, trade in Hong Kong.\n\nOne way for retail investors to short the Chinese market on U.S. exchanges is by shorting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) specializing in Chinese stocks and by buying so-called inverse ETFs, which essentially short a given market. For example, an investor can short Chinese stocks by purchasing the Ultra Short FTSE Xinhua 25 offered by Pro Shares. Liquidity issues limit the usefulness of some of these instruments, and tracking errors have also been reported. Moreover, the current crop of U.S.-traded Chinese ETFs does not allow the investor to target specific industries. Another approach to shorting the Chinese market is to short global commodity firms exporting to China. The financial press has reported the success of at least one hedge fund in May that shorted Australian mining stocks.\n\nWhile other factors, such as the Greek crisis, may have contributed to the decline of Chinese banks and property shares, it appears that both of these sectors have been selling off in anticipation of the problems in the Chinese real estate market. Investors have become sensitized to the bubble phenomenon. The question is whether it is too late to short the property market and whether global shorts have exaggerated the problem.\n\nThe lack of reliable data and the short operating history of China as a semicapitalist country make firm conclusions difficult. However, overall the evidence points to further problems in the Chinese banking and real estate sectors. If this is true, then it is not too late to short Chinese banks and property stocks.\n\nSome investors predict that China's real estate bubble will soon burst. Property prices in China are relatively high with respect to GDP per capita. Also, the Chinese government took actions in April 2010 to regulate real estate prices. However, the bubble may not burst in a way that the U.S. market experienced in 2007-2009.\n\nFor residential mortgage loans in China, the loan-asset ratio is always kept below 50%. If the property price drops by no more than 50%, there is no such issue of negative worth and foreclosure. Further, due to the high savings rate of China's population, many residential properties are owned by families without having any mortgage. The declining property prices may hurt real estate speculators, property developers, or property investment companies but would not have much impact on the Chinese economy.\n\nHowever, economic activities in China are controlled by central and municipal governments, sizable state-owned banks, and enterprises to a great extent. In 2010, the magnitude of bank lending has been reduced greatly following the change in monetary policy. In fact, bank lending on a large scale cannot be sustained any longer due to the potential risk from industry, as exports are severely affected by the European sovereign debt crisis. In 2011, the Chinese government will combat inflation and limit property-related personal and commercial loans. This will hopefully cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market. However, whether the real estate market will fall freely will be hard to say in such an economy with government interventions.\n\nEven with the drop of property prices, the Chinese central government is taking measures to curb current real estate prices. A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices would likely induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. In addition, if the yuan appreciates, then material costs will decrease. For example, if we assume that labor cost and land prices are the same, then property prices should be lower. However, if inflation is high and land prices are high, then property prices will be higher. We believe 15.7 Conclusion 249 that the Chinese government will allow no more than a 5% change in the yuan per year; therefore, it is hard to make solid conclusions. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a \"harmonious society.\" The above discussion while it may have practical implications should be regarded to be academic discussion. No explicit recommendation to buy or sell any security or fund should be implied."}
