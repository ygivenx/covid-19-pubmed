{"title": "Viruses associated with Antarctic wildlife: From serology based detection to identification of genomes using high throughput sequencing", "body": "Among Earth's oceans, those in the Polar Regions are the smallest and most constrained, the Arctic Ocean encircled by landmasses and the Southern Ocean by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The latter ocean is bounded to its north by the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), a wellknown faunal barrier, and has a high degree of endemism among both vertebrates and invertebrates (e.g. Briggs, 1995; Eastman, 2013) . Owing to dramatic annual cycles of heat and light, the productivity of the Southern Ocean is highly constrained on a seasonal basis, a characteristic that provides a generally challenging environment for the existence of organisms. Moreover, the high latitude Southern Ocean, i.e. that portion south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC (SBACC), is covered by sea ice for much of the year, in some places the entire year. Most of the birds and seals of a variety of species that inhabit that zone are endemic and resident, the most unvarying species assemblage found in Southern Hemisphere oceans; only a few migrant species augment that assemblage during summer (Ribic and Ainley, 1989) . The species comprising this assemblage breed either on Antarctic islands (birds) or the sea ice that surrounds the continent (seals). In contrast, waters north of the SBACC host a much more speciose, seasonally varying seabird and marine mammal assemblage composed of species breeding on low latitude islands bordering the APF (Antarctic and sub-Antarctic) as well as seasonal migrants from more temperate regions (e.g. Ainley et al., 1994; Laws, 1977a,b; Ribic and Ainley, 1989; Ribic et al., 2011) . In accord with trends of diversity varying inversely with latitude, overall diversity of vertebrate species is low in the Southern Ocean, especially south of the SBACC, but populations are immense (e.g. Laws, 1977a,b) .\n\nInhabiting the pack-ice surrounding Antarctica is a unique assemblage of pagophilic seals, crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), leopard (Hydrurda leptonyx), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii). Weddell seals colonize near-shore fast-ice regions feeding mainly on fish, while other Antarctic seals remain year round in the pack-ice composed of individual, often compacted floes. Crabeater seals feed principally on krill (Euphausia spp.), and Ross seals mostly on squid. Unlike the other Antarctic seals, leopard seals are solitary and highly predatory feeding on penguins and other seals as well as fish, krill and cephalopods (Siniff, 1981 \n\nDue to its zoogeographical isolation, introduction of pathogens and parasites to these populations of Antarctic wildlife, particularly the endemics of high latitude, may have detrimental effects. Understanding these potential effects required a knowledge of the entities circulating in the ecosystem. This concern drove interest toward detecting viruses, bacteria and parasites among Antarctic animals providing insight to their health. There have been a few reported cases of mass mortality where the disease-causing agent was undetermined. In 1971, several hundred gentoo penguin chicks at a Signey Island colony, South Orkneys, were found dead (MacDonald and Conroy, 1971 ). Although symptoms were described as similar to puffinosis coronavirus infection, no isolation of the disease agent was possible (Barbosa and Palacios, 2009) . In 1972, about 65% of Ad\u00e9lie penguin chicks were reported dead in a colony near Mawson Station. In this case, penguins were found face down and apparently unable to walk or stand properly . The cause of this disease was not determined. The only mass mortality reported in seals was the death of over 1500 crabeater seals in a colony around Crown Prince Gustav Channel, Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor, 1957) . Interestingly, Weddell seals in the area were unaffected and while the nature of this disease was unknown, a viral infection was suggested. Laws and Taylor (1957) noted that the population of seals in this area was almost ten times higher than normal and predicted that this crowding and partial starvation likely contributed to the effects of the disease.\n\nOnly within the last ten years has an increase in knowledge of the viral diversity been evident among Antarctic wildlife at a genome level. Early work, beginning in the mid-1970s, on identifying viruses associated with Antarctic animals relied on serology-based assays ( Table 1) . The research then was particularly focused around detecting pathogens posing a risk to animal health due to concerns regarding the impact of increased anthropogenic activity, e.g. research, tourism, on birds and marine mammals (Kerry and Riddle, 2009 ). During the early period of Antarctic virus research, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, birnaviruses, herpesviruses and flaviviruses were serologically detected (Table 1, Fig. 1 ). Subsequently, between 2000 and 2010, probe based assays using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and a poxvirus (Table 2, Fig. 1 ). Finally, in the last decade, advancements in high throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches are beginning to have an impact on our knowledge of Antarctic animal virology. For example, in the last five years using viral metagenomic based approaches with HTS, various novel viruses have been identified and characterized at a genomic level (Table 2, Fig. 1 ). These include adenoviruses, anelloviruses, orthomyxoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses and paramyxoviruses.\n\n3.1. Positive sense RNA viruses\n\nFlaviviridae is a family of enveloped positive sense RNA viruses with four genera: Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus and Pestivirus. Their genomes range in length from 8.9-13 kb (Simmonds et al., 2017b) . While no genomic information is available for flaviviruses circulating in Antarctic animals, neutralizing antibodies to a flavivirus were detected in the serum of South Polar skuas (Stercorarius maccormicki) around Davis station, East Antarctica (Miller et al., 2008) . As lower latitude seabirds are infested with ticks (e.g. Lee and Baust, 1987) , which are known to carry flaviviruses, this may indicate the transmission of tickborne flaviviruses to seabirds, especially given the fact that a flavivirus was isolated from seabird ticks (Ixodes uriae) infecting king penguins on Macquarie Island (Major et al., 2009) .\n\nThe family Togaviridae consist of enveloped positive sense RNA viruses with a genome length of about 11-12 kb in length. Togaviruses are classified into two genera, Alphavirus and Rubivirus (Power et al., 2017) . While the human pathogenic virus, rubella virus, is the only known member of the single species in the genus Rubivirus to date (species Rubella virus), all animal togaviruses are classified as alphaviruses (Power et al., 2017) . The life cycle of alphaviruses requires an arthropod vector, either a mosquito or tick, for transmission to their vertebrate host. The first instance of alphaviruses found in marine mammals was shown in southern elephant seals of Macquarie Island. Initially the seal alphavirus was isolated from the blood-sucking louse (Lepidophthirus macrorhini) that is widespread among southern elephant seals. However, a high seroprevalence of antibodies against the southern elephant seal alphavirus strongly indicated its transmission from lice to seals (La Linn et al., 2001) . The full genome of this alphavirus (Southern elephant seal virus) was determined in a later study (Forrester et al., 2012 Antarctica continues to provide an interesting environment to study Influenza A viruses, especially in the case of migratory birds. For example, the South Polar skuas that breed on the Antarctic continent in the summer but move north, well into the Northern Hemisphere during the non-breeding season (Weimerskirch et al., 2015) , thus act as Table 1 Summary of Antarctic bird-and mammal-associated viruses detected through serological approaches. Fig. 1 ) (Austin and Webster, 1993; Baumeister et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2008; . Such research has indicated that influenza virus is highly widespread and prevalent in Antarctic birds. However, the pathogenicity of avian influenza virus in these populations is unknown. No genomic information for Influenza A viruses in Antarctic birds was available until Hurt et al. (2014) used HTS approaches to identify influenza A virus (H11N2) in Ad\u00e9lie penguins around the Antarctic Peninsula. A following study around the same area later identified the strain H5N5 among chinstrap penguins (Hurt et al., 2016) . None of the early studies have detected antibodies against influenza A virus strains in Antarctic pinnipeds, although several studies have looked at crabeater and Weddell seals (Austin and Webster, 1993; McFarlane, 2009 ).\n\nParamyxoviridae is a family of enveloped, non-segmented negative sense RNA viruses in the order Mononegavirales with genomes of \u223c15 kb. Paramyxoviruses are divided into seven genera: Aquaparamyxovirus, Ferlavirus, Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, Rubulavirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus. The genus Avulavirus includes of 13 formally classified species of avian paramyxoviruses including avian paramyxovirus 1 (AVPM-1) (Afonso et al., 2016) . The genus Morbillivirus contains paramyxoviruses infecting mammals.\n\nThe majority of research on paramyxoviruses in Antarctica has been based on serological studies using haemagglutination inhibition assay to detect antibodies against paramyxoviruses in serum samples (Table 1) . A high prevalence of antibodies to NDV in South Polar skuas has been reported (Miller et al., 2010) , whereas low incidences have been found in Ad\u00e9lie and royal penguins around coastal Antarctica and Macquarie Island (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ) Westbury, 1981, 1988) . So far, king, gentoo and rockhopper penguin colonies on Macquarie Island have tested negative for AVPM-1 antibodies .\n\nDespite serology-based knowledge of these viruses among Antarctic birds, our understanding of their diversity is extremely limited due to the lack of available genomic data. Partial genome sequences of NDV in Ad\u00e9lie penguins has been obtained using HTS approaches (Thomazelli et al., 2010) . Most recently, complete genome sequences of avian paramyxovirus 10 (APMV 10) and three novel avulaviruses (APMV 11, 12, 13) have been determined from rockhopper penguins on the Falkland Islands and gentoo penguins sampled on Kopaitic Island, northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) (Goraichuk et al., 2017; Neira et al., 2017) .\n\nWith the use of sled dogs (Canis familiaris) during the early Antarctic expeditions, concern of morbillivirus infection among Antarctic pinnipeds drove research in monitoring for this virus in seal populations. Antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) have been reported in leopard and crabeater seals around the Antarctic Peninsula (Bengtson et al., 1991) and phocine distemper virus (PDV) in Weddell seals from Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica (McFarlane, 2009) . With the exception of crabeater seals, both of these studies revealed low antibody titers against CDV and PDV. Several other studies looking at morbilliviruses in Antarctic seals have failed to detect any antibodies against these viruses (Harder et al., 1991; Osterhaus et al., 1988; Stenvers et al., 1992; Yochem et al., 2009 ). This may suggest morbilliviruses are not persistent in Antarctic seals or perhaps there are diverse morbilliviruses circulating amongst the pinnipeds that cannot be detected using conventional serology assays but likely to be identified using HTS approaches. Unlike avian paramyxoviruses, no genomic data are available for morbilliviruses from Antarctic seals and therefore impossible to tell if there was a spillover event from the canines to the pinnipeds. Sled dogs are no longer allowed in Antarctica.\n\nViruses in the family Birnaviridae have non-enveloped capsids that encapsidate two linear double stranded segments of RNA, each \u223c2.3-3 kb in length. Four genera have been established in this family: Avibirnavirus, Aquabirnavirus, Blosnavirus and Entomobirnavirus (Delmas et al., 2011) . Infectious bursal disease virus is the only characterized virus belonging to genus Avibirnavirus. Since its initial identification as virus responsible for a highly infectious disease among chickens, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has widely been isolated from other birds in the poultry industry including ducks and turkeys, however, disease has only been identified in chickens. Between 1995-2002 neutralization assays identified high titers of antibodies against IBDV in Ad\u00e9lie penguin at colonies around Mawson and Davis stations, and Terra Nova Bay, East Antarctica; and emperor penguin at the Auster, Amanda and Cape Washington colonies, also in East Antarctica (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) (Gardner et al., 1997; Watts et al., 2009) . Highest seroprevalence has been detected among emperor penguin colonies with no difference between sampled locations or years . South Polar skuas around Vestold Hills and Davis Station, East Antarctica, have also had high titer of antibodies against IBDV (Miller et al., 2008; Watts et al., 2009) , however, a significant difference in seroprevalence between sampling periods during 1999-2002 was observed. A low titer and prevalence of antibodies to IBDV has been detected in king penguins around Possession Island, among the Crozet Islands along the APF (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2002) . High-titers of IBDV neutralizing antibodies detected in distant populations of penguins and South Polar skua around Antarctica suggests it is unlikely IBDV was introduced through disposal of chicken products around Mawson Station as previously suggested by Gardner et al. (1997) . Given that IBDV infection has been commonly detected in other wild avian populations (Hollm\u00e9n et al., 2000; Kasanga et al., 2008; Ogawa et al., 1998) , this virus may be naturally occurring among Antarctic birds . It is worth noting, however, that IBDV has yet to be isolated from Antarctic birds despite several studies detecting neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is difficult to address any questions about the diversity, evolution or transmission of this virus among Antarctic birds.\n\nAdenoviruses are a family of non-enveloped double stranded DNA viruses with a genome length of \u223c26-45 kb. The diversification of these viruses is thought to have occurred through several animal hosts including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish and amphibians. The family Adenoviridae has been divided into five genera: Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus, Siadenovirus, Ichtadenovirus (Harrach et al., 2011) .\n\nMost adenovirus research has focused on the implications of humanassociated adenoviruses, likely due to the known clinical significance in causing respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. However, the first adenoviruses from Antarctic animals have only recently been identified among South Polar skua (Skua siadenovirus A) (Park et al., 2012) , as well as chinstrap, Ad\u00e9lie and gentoo penguins (Penguin siadenovirus A) (Table 2, Fig. 1 ) (Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016) . This provides important insight to monitoring penguin health in Antarctica, as adenoviruses have been known to cause severe disease among animals.\n\nWhole genomes for these adenoviruses were confirmed using HTS approaches and subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the genomic sequences provide support for the classification of the South Polar skua and penguin adenoviruses in the genus Siadenovirus. Despite this classification, penguin adenovirus genomes are unique in that they lack a putative sialidase gene that is characteristic of other genomes in this Z.E. Smeele et al. Virus Research 243 (2018) 91-105 genus (Lee et al., 2016) . It is likely that there exits adenoviruses associated with Antarctic seals based on the fact that adenoviruses has been identified in California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), Fur seals (Arctocephalus spp.) and South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) (Chiappetta et al., 2017; Cortes-Hinojosa et al., 2016; Cortes-Hinojosa et al., 2015; Goldstein et al., 2011; Inoshima et al., 2013) .\n\nHerpesviridae is a large family of enveloped viruses with a linear, double stranded DNA genome about 120-240 kb in length. This family has been divided into three subfamilies (Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae). Herpesviruses belonging to two species, based on partial genome sequencing of conserved regions, have been found among pinnipeds in the Northern Hemisphere (Harder et al., 1996) : phocid alphaherpesvirus-1 (PhHV-1, species Phocid alphaherpesvirus 1) belonging to the Varicellovirus genus of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and phocid gammaherpesvirus-2 (PhHV-2, Phocid gammaherpesvirus 2) belonging to the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. Both PhHV-1 and PhHV-2 have been identified in several non-Antarctic pinniped species around the world from free-ranging populations as well as captive populations in zoos and aquaria (Bellehumeur et al., 2016; Goldstein et al., 2004; Osterhaus et al., 1985) .\n\nAmong Antarctic pinnipeds, herpesvirus has not been confirmed by molecular methods, however, several studies over the years have shown high levels of PhHV-1 neutralizing antibodies in Antarctic fur seals among sub-Antarctic islands, and Ross, Weddell and crabeater seals off East Antarctica (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ) (Harder et al., 1991; Stenvers et al., 1992; Tryland et al., 2012) . Thus, it is highly likely that herpesvirus is widespread and persistent among pinnipeds. However, genomic data is required to confirm this virus among Antarctic pinnipeds as the serological data has only indicated infection of a herpesvirus antigenically similar to PhHV-1.\n\nPapillomaviridae is a large family of non-enveloped, circular, double stranded DNA viruses with \u223c7-8 kb genomes and are known to infect skin, squamous and mucosal epithelial cells. All papillomavirus genomes have a very similar organization that can be divided into three regions encoding replication associated and regulatory proteins, structural proteins, and a long control region. While research on human papillomaviruses has been extensive due its clinical significance, relatively few studies have looked at non-human papillomaviruses. Papillomaviruses are found in a range of hosts including mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It is a well-supported hypothesis that they have co-evolved with their hosts given their diversity and host specificity, with supporting phylogenetic analyses that track diversification of papillomaviruses to the evolution of their host (Bernard et al., 2010; de Villiers et al., 2004) .\n\nTwo novel papillomavirus, Pygoscelis adeliae papillomavirus 1, \u22122 (PaPV1, \u22122), was recently identified in Antarctica from feces and cloacal swab of Ad\u00e9lie penguins at Cape Crozier, Ross Island (Table 2 , Fig. 1 ) using a HTS-informed approach (Van Doorslaer et al., 2017; Varsani et al., 2014) . PaPV1 and \u22122 are related to other avian papillomaviruses, PaPV1 has been assigned to the genus Treisepsilonpapillomavirus whereas PaPV2 is currently unclassified and shares \u223c64% genome-wide pairwise identity with PaPV1. These PaPVs are the first papillomaviruses to be discovered in Antarctic animals and are part of the few known avian papillomaviruses.\n\nPolyomaviruses represent a family of non-enveloped, circular, double-stranded DNA viruses with a genome length of 5-6 kb, and infect a range of hosts including mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. This family has four genera: Alphapolyomavirus, Betapolyomavirus, Deltapolyomavirus, and Gammapolyomavirus with three species unassigned to any of these (Moens et al., 2017; Polyomaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses et al., 2016) . Phylogenetic analyses have shown that avian polyomaviruses cluster together and have been classified under the genus Gammapolyomavirus. Avian polyomaviruses are known to cause inflammatory disease in birds, and can lead to disease of the skin and feathers and mortality in some species. The first polyomavirus identified in Antarctica was found in the feces of Ad\u00e9lie penguins at Cape Royds, Ross Island (Varsani et al., 2015) using a HTS-informed approach. Analysis of this genome shows that it falls in the avian polyomavirus lineage, representing a novel species (Pygoscelis adeliae polyomavirus 1).\n\nFollowing this, two other polyomaviruses have been identified from Antarctic animals: a polyomavirus from the stomach of a sharp-spined notothen (Trematomus pennellii) (Buck et al., 2016) and most recently from the kidney of a Weddell seal, both sampled in the Ross Sea (Table 2, Fig. 1 ) . The sharp-spined notothen polyomavirus is one of the three polyomaviruses to be identified associated with fish and all three were identified using HTS approaches (Buck et al., 2016) .\n\nPolyomavirus sequences have been identified in three other pinniped species: once in a captive Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) (Cortes-Hinojosa et al., 2016) , in the placenta of one northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) (Duncan et al., 2013) from Alaska and a stranded free-ranging California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) (Colegrove et al., 2010) . However, until recently the genome of California sea lion polyomavirus (CSLPyV) was the only confirmed pinniped polyomavirus. The recently identified Weddell seal polyomavirus is has been proposed to be classified as the species Leptonychotes weddellii polyomavirus 1 (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/proposals/ animal_dna_viruses_and_retroviruses/m/animal_dna_ec_approved/ 6941).\n\nPoxviruses are a diverse family of double-stranded DNA viruses with a wide host range among vertebrates and arthropods (Skinner et al., 2011) . Poxviruses have been extensively studied for their clinical significance in causing highly pathogenic disease among humans and other animals. While sealpox has yet to be formally classified, studies have identified this virus in populations of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) (Muller et al., 2003) , gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) (Nettleton et al., 1995) , Stellar sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), spotted seals (Phoca largha) (Bracht et al., 2006) , and California sea lions (Nollens et al., 2006) , causing severe proliferative lesions on the bodies of infected individuals. Partial sequencing has indicated seal poxvirus falls under the parapoxvirus family of which only four species have been classified.\n\nThe only case of poxvirus in Antarctica known to date has been the isolation and detection from a skin lesion of a deceased Weddell seal in Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica (Table 2, Fig. 1 ) (Tryland et al., 2005) . Other Weddell seals in the area were analyzed for seal poxvirus, however, all individuals were negative, suggesting poxviruses may not prevalent in this population. Partial sequencing of the Weddell seal parapoxvirus shows it is closely related to harbor and grey seal poxviruses (Tryland et al., 2005) .\n\nRecently a seal parapoxvirus was sequenced using HTS from a skin lesion of a grey seal from the Baltic Sea (Gunther et al., 2017) . While poxviruses have been identified in several avian species, very little is known about their diversity and host range. Using HTS technology a novel avipoxvirus genome has been sequenced from an African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) (Offerman et al., 2014) . It is highly likely that poxviruses will also be recovered from Antarctic penguins through HTS.\n\nViruses in the family Anelloviridae are non-enveloped, circular single stranded DNA viruses with a genome length of about 2-3.9 kb (Biagini Z.E. Smeele et al. Virus Research 243 (2018) (Ng et al., 2009 ). Since then several novel anellovirus genomes have been recovered in harbor seals (Bodewes et al., 2015; Bodewes et al., 2013) . In lung samples of deceased harbor seals along the North American Pacific coast anelloviruses were identified over multiple years demonstrating the persistence of this infection in the population (Ng et al., 2011) . Analyses of sub-Antarctic (Arctocephalus tropicalis) and South American fur seal (A. australis) feces also led to the identification of anellovirus sequences (Kluge et al., 2016) . Anelloviruses circulating in the Antarctic ecosystem have recently been shown following detection by HTS and using pairs of abutting primers in the recovery of 152 genomes from vaginal, nasal and faecal samples of Weddell seals in the Ross Sea during the 2014-2015 summer (Fahsbender et al., 2017) . Analyses identified two novel anelloviruses, torque teno Leptonychotes weddellii virus (TTLwV-1, TTLwV-2). T-TLwV-1 was additionally identified in South Polar skua faecal samples and it was thought that this was as a result of skuas feeding on the placenta and dead carcasses of Weddell seals in the area (Fahsbender et al., 2017) .\n\nBoth ecto-and endoparasites have been reported among Antarctic animals. While neither appear to be detrimental to animal health, these Fig. 2. Timeline,1975 , showing the periods of serology-(purple), PCR-(red) and HTS-based (light red) approaches for viral identification. From 2012 onwards, viral genomes are determined by PCR-, Sanger-and HTS-based approaches. Top panel summarizes the determination of complete genomes by either Sanger sequencing and/or HTS from associated Antarctic animals. Colored circles indicating where they were found: Antarctic Peninsula (dark blue), Falkland Islands (green), Macquarie Island (pink) and Ross Island/sea (orange).\n\nZ.E. Smeele et al. Virus Research 243 (2018) 91-105 organisms may play a significant role as vectors of viruses. Ticks, mites and lice commonly parasitize seals, penguins and other Antarctic birds (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 1998; Gonz\u00e1lez-Acu\u00f1a et al., 2013; McFarlane, 1996) . Flaviviruses, orbiviruses, phleboviruses, and nairoviruses have been isolated from seabird ticks (Ixodes uriae) associated with king, rockhopper and royal penguins on Macquarie Island (Major et al., 2009) . A novel alphavirus has also been isolated and partially sequenced from lice associated with southern elephant seals of Macquarie Island and the high seroprevalence in the southern elephant seal population showed to this virus strongly suggests its transmission by lice (La Linn et al., 2001) . Gastrointestinal parasites, particularly cestode and nematode species, are commonly found in Antarctic seals and penguins. Penguins tend to have a low diversity of parasites and similar profiles have been identified among penguins of the same genus (Diaz et al., 2016 (Diaz et al., , 2013 Fonteneau et al., 2011; Kleinertz et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2012) . Of the Antarctic seals, gastrointestinal parasites are most prevalent among Weddell and leopard seals. Given that helminth parasites are strongly associated with the diet of the host they infect, this likely explains the higher abundance of parasites among Weddell and leopard seals compared to other Antarctic seals ). The potential for endoparasites to transmit viruses to their host has been demonstrated by two genera of plant viruses, nepoviruses and tobraviruses, transmitted by nematodes (Hull, 2014) . While our knowledge of parasites in Antarctic animals remains extremely limited and research in this area has been sporadic, developments in molecular technology will undoubtedly have a strong impact toward revealing relationships between organisms and the movement of viruses in the environment.\n\nRecently, Antarctic penguins have been showing signs of disease of unknown pathology, e.g. unexplained incursions of feather loss in Ad\u00e9lie penguins (Grimaldi et al., 2015) in the Ross Sea (2011-2012) but not the years before or after (personal observation). Furthermore, in 2014 observations of an Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony at Hope Bay, Antarctica identified two chicks showing patches without feathers in two sub colonies (Barbosa et al., 2014) . Beak and feather disease virus (family Circoviridae) infection in certain psittacines causes feather abnormalities and loss (Pass and Perry, 1984) and hence there is a likelihood that feather loss observed in penguins may be attributed to an unknown circovirus-like agent.\n\nOver the last ten years, viral metagenomics has led to a dramatic increase in viral discovery from various environmental and animal samples, for example, Shi et al. (2016) identified \u223c1400 novel RNA viruses (from over 200 invertebrate species), Brum et al. (2015) identified \u223c5500 distinct dsDNA virus populations (from 43 surface ocean sites worldwide as part of the Tara Oceans expedition) and Paez-Espino et al. (2016) identified \u223c120000 partial viral genomes sequences (from \u223c3000 geographically diverse samples) using HTS. This together with other studies that have identified large datasets of novel viruses using HTS (e.g. Dayaram et al., 2016; Labonte and Suttle, 2013; Rosario et al., 2015) has shown: 1) the HTS enabled identification of large numbers of previously unknown viruses; 2) we have barely scratched the surface of the viral sequence space and thus their diversity; 3) new taxa will need to be created to classify viruses at a rapid rate to match the pace of virus discovery. All this has opened up discussions on viral classification based on sequence data, either derived from Sanger sequencing or HTS, and lead to a consensus statement by Simmonds et al. (2017a) to incorporate these into current viral taxonomy.\n\nHTS has been used to a large extent in Antarctic environmental virology to study soil (Adriaenssens et al., 2017; Zablocki et al., 2014) , lake (Aguirre de C\u00e1rcer et al., 2016; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2015 , 2009 Yau et al., 2011) and marine (Brum et al., 2017; Miranda et al., 2016) viral ecology. Novel viral genomes from various soils and lake samples (Dziewit and Radlinska, 2016; Kerepesi and Grolmusz, 2017; Meiring et al., 2012; Swanson et al., 2012; Zawar-Reza et al., 2014) have been determined using HTS approaches. In contrast, relatively little is known about viruses associated with Antarctic animals and the associated virus ecology despite the advent of HTS. This perhaps can be attributed to the difficulty in accessing/obtaining animal samples and longitudinal sampling for viral ecology studies. Nonetheless, various studies have used HTS to identify viruses associated with Antarctic animals (Table 2 , Fig. 2 ) and we anticipate that the next decade will see a dramatic increase in virology activity and to some extent viral ecology studies of Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is highly like that large numbers of diverse viruses will be identified using HTS. As sequencing technologies improve, there may be possibility of in-field identification of animal viral pathogens in Antarctica, e.g. using Oxford Nanopore Sequencer (ONS). ONS has been used for metagenomic studies of microbial mats from three lakes in the Antarctic dry valleys (Lakes Fryxell, Lake Vanda and Lake Vida) by Johnson et al. (2017) demonstrating its use in Antarctic field conditions and remote laboratories."}
