{"title": "Cell-Membrane-Mimicking\nNanodecoys against Infectious\nDiseases", "body": "According to their morphology and structure,\npathogens can generally\nbe divided into four main categories: viruses, bacteria, fungi, and\nparasites.23 Despite the diversity of pathogens,\none similarity they share is how they cause infectious disease: these\npathogens usually invade the host by interacting with the host cell\nmembrane first.13 Here, we briefly review\nthe interactions between different pathogens and hosts at the cell\u2013membrane\ninterface.\n\nViruses are small infectious agents that do not grow\nby cell division\nbut instead use the host metabolism to complete self-replication.\nViruses can infect all types of life forms on Earth, from animals\nand plants to microorganisms. The modes of viral infection and replication\ndiffer greatly between species, but attachment is the basic stage,\nin which viral capsid proteins specifically bind to the receptors\non the host cellular membrane.8 For example,\nHIV infects human leukocytes through the specific interaction between\nits surface protein gp120 and the CD4 receptor and the CCR5 or CXCR4\nco-receptors on CD4+ T cells.24\n\nBacteria are one kind of biological cell that compose a wide\nrange\nof prokaryotic microorganisms. The relationship between bacteria and\nhumans is complex. Sometimes bacteria offer us a helping hand. For\nexample, probiotics help us digest. In other cases, bacteria are subversive,\ncausing infectious diseases like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).25 Typically, pathogenic bacteria express and/or release a\nlarge domain of molecules that target the host membrane and facilitate\nmany individual host responses.16 The molecular\nmechanisms of the interactions between bacteria and hosts are different\nacross different species. For example, many Gram-positive pathogens\nsecrete pore-forming toxins that can form pores in the cell membranes\nand lead to cell lysis, whereas Gram-negative pathogens secrete endotoxins\nthat can activate macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines.26\n\nA fungus is any member of eukaryotic organisms,\nincluding mushrooms\nand microorganisms such as molds and yeasts. According to their different\nstructures, sizes, surface properties, and ability to secrete pathogenicity\nfactors, fungi can attack host cells in different ways, including\nmembrane disruption by mechanical forces and membrane remodeling by\nfungal lipases.27 In addition, Moyes et al. discovered that Candida albicans is able to produce a peptide toxin that can directly damage host\nmembranes and activate host immunity.28\n\nParasitism is a relationship between different species in\nevolutionary\nbiology, where one life form, the parasite, lives on or in another\nlife form, the host. Although the parasite may cause the host some\nharm, the host is adapted structurally to live with the parasite.\nFor example, to complete their life cycle in the blood circulation,\nthe malaria parasite produces merozoite that can attach to and enter\ninto red blood cells (RBCs) where the parasite asexually divides to\nform many copies of itself. The parasite copy then exits the infected\nRBC and infects more RBCs.29\n\nLiposomes are artificial vesicles composed\nof one or more hydrophobic phospholipid bilayers; they have been used\nextensively for systemic delivery of therapeutic compounds. Because\nliposomes imitate the capabilities of cell membranes in several ways,\nthey have been widely utilized as model membranes to study the infection\nmechanisms of many pathogens at the biomembrane interface (Figure 1a).31 Research on the interaction between pathogens and liposomes\ncan be traced back to the 1960s, when Bangham et al. found that streptolysin-S is able to regulate the cationic permeability\nof multilayer liposomes.32 Following the\nearly mechanistic studies, researchers further applied liposomes as\npathogen substrates in the emerging infectious disease area. For example,\nliposome microarrays can be used for ultrasensitive detection of various\ntypes of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.33 These cell-membrane mimics, consisting of synthetical\nlipids along with functional ligands, promote the formation of pathogen\u2013liposome\ncomplexes that effectively improve the detection sensitivity in various\nelectrochemical and immunological assays. Another example that utilizes\nthe liposome\u2013pathogen interaction is direct inhibition of the\npathogen infection with liposomes. The pathogens were trapped and\ndetained by cell-membrane-mimicking liposomes, thereby preventing\nthem from attacking their cellular targets.34 In viral and bacterial infection models, treatment with functionalized\nliposomes was demonstrated to improve subject survival as well as\nto reduce the overall infection.34,35 Engineered\nliposomes have also been used as a secondary therapeutic to supplement\ntraditional anti-infective drugs. Systemic administration of nanoscale\nliposomes along with penicillin effectively protected animals from S. pneumoniae- and S. aureus-caused septicemia.36 Moreover, researchers\nhave also exploited the liposome\u2013pathogen interaction for infection-triggered\ndrug release. Motivated by targeting therapeutic drugs to the specific\nsite, pore-forming toxins are able to bore holes on the synthetic\nliposomal vehicles, resulting in the selective release of vancomycin\nat the infection sites.37 Surface engineering\nof liposomes with specific molecules may further promote the applicability\nof synthetic liposomes against infectious diseases. Magee et al., for instance, successfully modified liposomes with\nantiviral antibodies for effective protection against coxsackie A-21\nvirus infection.38 With the rapid developments\nof biotechnology and nanotechnology, the physical and chemical properties\nof phospholipid bilayers may be tuned finely to improve their efficacy\nin various anti-infection applications.\n\nIn addition to liposomes,\nreconstituted lipoproteins have also been extensively employed in\nthe development of anti-infection decoys. Lipoproteins are inherently\npresent in the human body as a disk-like patch of phospholipids bound\nby apolipoproteins. By using their constructing ingredients, these\nproteins can be controllably reconstituted.39 This method promises the controllable functionalization of lipoprotein\ncomponents at the molecular level, opening the door for any lipid-compatible\ningredients to be incorporated into the lipoprotein nanostructure.\nProton pumps, signaling proteins, and membrane-associating enzymes\nhave all been integrated into the reconstituted lipoproteins.39\n\nEngineered lipoproteins have been demonstrated\nto interact frequently with pathogens, leading to the effective suppression\nof pathogen infectivity. This inhibition can be ascribed to the lipoproteins\u2019\nmicrodomains, which are also rich in pathogen/toxin receptors such\nas sphingomyelin and cholesterol.40 Furthermore,\nto develop anti-infection nanostructures for clinical use, Bricarello et al. prepared reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL)\nto integrate ganglioside GM1 to improve affinity to certain pathogenic\nmolecules (Figure 1b).41 The modified rHDL effectively inhibited\nthe cholera toxin attachment to epithelial cells and prevented toxin-associated\nnegative outcomes. Although promising, further work along the lines\nof how to alleviate the toxicity of such nanostructures and how to\nimprove the rHDL\u2013host interaction is necessary before successful\ntranslation of rHDL as an anti-infection candidate.\n\nCell-membrane-derived\nnanoparticles present an attractive platform for anti-infection applications\nbecause pathogens have evolved to utilize abundant molecules on the\ncell membrane.42 Although synthetic liposomes\ncan be straightforwardly functionalized with specific ligands, it\nhas proven difficult to replicate or to mimic the complicated protein\ncompositions and functions in natural cell membranes. Natural cell-membrane-derived\nvesicles possess a unique advantage of maintaining most of the natural\ncompositions and functions of source cell membranes, thereby enabling\neach platform to exhibit properties that would otherwise be hard to\naccomplish.43,44 Moreover, emerging genetic editing\ntechnology can be further employed to amend the antigen profile of\nnatural cellular membranes to fit different purposes.18\n\nTo develop biomimetic anti-infection nanodecoys, de Carvalho et al. demonstrated that CD4+ T-cell-derived\nexosomes could efficiently suppress HIV-1 infection in vitro.45 These exosomes exhibited the same\ncompleted membrane protein composition as their source CD4+ T cells, ensuring that they attached effectively to HIV-1, thereby\npreventing the HIV-1 from binding to and entering healthy CD4+ T cells. In addition, exosomes released from certain host\ncells have also been utilized to suppress bacterial and parasitic\ninvasion of specific host cells, as well.46\n\nBecause many exotoxins secreted by bacteria and fungi are\nknown\nfor their unique capability to lyse erythrocytes (RBCs), RBC-derived\nnanovesicles have been widely employed as a model to examine the kinetics\nof these exotoxins.47 After removal of\nthe intracellular contents, these cell-membrane-derived nanovesicles\ninherit the lipids, glycans, and proteins from their source cells,\nenabling the pathogen\u2013nanoparticle interaction to occur in\na natural manner.\n\nIn developing a biomimetic formulation that\ntraps exotoxins secreted\nby bacteria, Hu et al. demonstrated that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles camouflaged with\nRBC membranes are able to serve as toxin \u201cnanosponges\u201d,\nabsorbing pore-forming toxins and diverting them away from their intended\ntargets.26 Moreover, Rao et al. showed that mosquito host-cell-membrane-wrapped nanodecoys effectively\ntrap Zika virus (ZIKV) and divert it away from its healthy cellular\ntargets (Figure 1c).17 In mouse models, the research team further demonstrated\nthat these nanodecoys successfully mitigate the ZIKV-caused inflammatory\nresponses and fetal microcephaly. Compared to cell-membrane-derived\nvesicles, the cell-membrane-coated nanostructures are not prone to\nmembrane fusion and therefore do not transfer detained pathogens to\nhost cells.48,49 In addition, due to the core\u2013shell\nstructure, the lipid membrane shell is stabilized by the nanoparticle\ncore, benefiting in vivo applications.20,50\n\nConsidering\nthat cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys are able to\ntrap pathogens in a natural manner, the obtained nanoparticle\u2013pathogen\ncomplexes can be applied to develop vaccines.21 Typically, vaccine preparation relies on heat or chemical treatments\nto destruct the protein\u2019s tertiary structure, leading to antigen\nalteration and reduced immunogenicity.51 However, the inherent balance between efficacy and safety presents\na great limitation to vaccine development. Recently, more efforts\nhave focused on weakening a pathogen\u2019s infectivity while maintaining\nits original structure, thus enhancing both the efficacy and safety\nof vaccines.3 Trapping and detention of\npathogens/exotoxins by nanodecoys offer the chance to denude the pathogens\u2019\ninfectious capabilities without compromising immunogenicity. Demonstrating\na novel concept of pathogen/toxin sequestration by cell-membrane-mimicking\nnanodecoys for vaccination, Hu et al. showed that\nthe spontaneous interactions between RBC membrane-coated nanodecoys\nand pore-forming toxins presented a facile approach for developing\nsafe and effective vaccines.21 The nanoparticle\nvehicles are endowed with many properties that are beneficial to antigen\nprocessing: the pathogens/toxins were displayed on immune cells in\ntheir native manner; the nanoparticles\u2019 small size and long\ncirculation promoted antigen presentation; and the nanoparticle carriers\nwere primarily absorbed by cells through endocytosis, thereby promoting\nthe localization and metabolism of pathogens/exotoxins in endolysosomal\nsections. These properties together contributed to the improved safety\nand efficiency by nanoparticle-trapped pathogens/toxins.\n\nConventional\nanti-infection strategies primarily depend on structure-customized\nplatforms such as antibodies and antisera. Although effective, these\nformulations often require accurate identification of the pathogenic\nspecies and have proven to be impractical to administer at times.\nAmidst the increasing awareness of emerging virus epidemics as well\nas the rising threat of drug-resistant bacteria, broadly applicable\nplatforms have tremendous potential for the treatment of infectious\ndiseases. In-depth biological research has elucidated different mechanisms\nof pathogen infection, most of which involve attaching to the cellular\nmembrane biointerface and invading the host cells. Recent nanotechnology\ndevelopments have resulted in a variety of nanoscale cell-membrane-mimicking\nformulations, including liposomes, reconstituted lipoproteins, and\ncell-membrane nanostructures. Much effort has been directed toward\nexploring the interactions between these biomimetic nanodecoys and\npathogens/exotoxins, and researchers have demonstrated successful\nprotection against major pathogenic infections through nanoparticle\nfunctionalization.17,18,26,30 These nanoformulations can be infused in vivo to alleviate the disease burden in multiple infectious\ndiseases. Moreover, pathogen/toxin trapping and detention by cellular-membrane-based\nnanostructures have wider implications in the development of safe\nand effective vaccines.18,21\n\nCell-membrane-mimicking\nnanodecoys represent a promising technology\nthat has enormous translation potential.16 To realize this potential, further exploration and detailed study\nare required. Scalability is a crucial factor that is required for\nany clinical translational nanostructures. Previous work on the robust\npreparation of liposomes, lipoproteins, and cell-membrane nanoparticles\nindicates the need for further explorations on the large-scale production\nof these biomimetic nanodecoys.17 Moving\nforward, the host\u2013pathogen affinity is a key issue that needs\nto be further considered. For many pathogens with clear infection\nmechanisms, strategies including bioconjugate chemistry and genetic\nediting can be employed to enhance the specific protein expression,\nresulting in enhanced platform efficacy.18,52 A promising property of these bioinspired nanodecoys is that they\nare highly customizable, especially for cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles.\nAlthough most of the previous designs employed a PLGA nanoparticle\nas the core, it is easy to imagine such cell-membrane-coated platforms\ncan be formed with many other types of nanoparticle cores,43,47,53\u221255 such as magnetic\nnanoparticles. With an additional magnet, cell-membrane-wrapped magnetic\nparticles can be localized to targeted sites and away from susceptible\ntissues.54 Finally, although nanoparticle-trapped\npathogens have many advantages over traditional vaccine developments,\nthe nanocomplexes containing nondenatured pathogens unavoidably increase\nsafety risks. Further in-depth studies are needed prior to successful\nclinical translation of these novel nanotechnologies."}
