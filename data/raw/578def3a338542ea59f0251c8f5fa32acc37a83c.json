{"title": "", "body": "study has shown that even after weighting, landline telephone surveys will underestimate the prevalence of certain health behaviors. 3 The study used in this paper shows that low-income people are likely to encounter more problems than people from higher-income households. It is likely that these problems would be somewhat larger if cellphone-only households were included. However, even without these households, the results suggest that the problems of low-income people are large enough to warrant attention from public health officials.\n\nThe dataset is available by emailing Kathleen Weldon at kweldon@hsph.harvard.edu.\n\nResponse rate -The number of complete interviews with reporting units divided by the number of eligible reporting units in the sample. Response Rate 3 (RR3), the method used in this article, estimates what proportion of cases of unknown eligibility is actually eligible. This estimate is guided by the best available scientific information on what share eligible cases make up among the unknown cases. Examples of unknown eligibility include numbers where the telephone was always busy or there was no answer throughout the interview period, numbers that had an answering machine or technical barrier such as call-blocking (and where it was not possible to tell whether or not the number was at a housing unit), and numbers in the sample that were never called.\n\nCooperation rate -The proportion of all cases interviewed of all eligible units ever contacted.\n\nThe following quotation explains the basic concept of weighting data from a survey.\n\nMore details about weighting are in the methods section of the article itself.\n\nTo get an estimate from our sample of the population's opinion, we do not give each response equal influence. We need to \"weight\" the responses of undersampled groups more heavily than those of oversampled groups, thereby estimating the poll responses that would have resulted if the survey respondents had matched the population in their demographic characteristics. Consider a simple case, weighting by sex. In a 1,000-person sample that is going to be adjusted by sex, the weight for women would be the number of women out of 1,000 people in the population divided by the number of women in the sample.\n\nEach female response would be weighted by (i.e., multiplied by) this ratio. If, for example, the sample had fewer women than the general population, female responses would be given more weight when estimating the population's characteristics on each question (p. 114). 5\n\nAfter weighting, the sample for the survey whose results are reported in this article was 48% male, 52% female, 69% non-Hispanic white, 11% non-Hispanic African American, 13% Hispanic American, 2% Asian American, 60% adults aged 18-49, and 39% adults aged 50+. Now I want to ask you some questions about a possible outbreak in the U.S. of pandemic flu, a new type of flu that spreads rapidly among humans and causes severe illness. Currently there have not been any cases of pandemic flu in the U.S. However, imagine that there was a severe outbreak in the U.S. and possibly in your community and a lot of people were getting very sick from the flu and the flu was spreading rapidly from person to person.\n\nPublic health officials think many people will get sick if there is a severe outbreak of pandemic flu. Those less severely sick would need to be taken care of at home rather than at hospitals. Only the sickest people would be hospitalized. I'm going to ask you some questions about two situations: if you yourself were sick, or if you were taking care of someone in your household who was sick from pandemic flu.\n\n32. If public health officials said you should be prepared to take care of members of your household at home for 7 to 10 days if they become sick, would you be able to do that, or not? Table  Total All household members would voluntarily stay at home for 7-10 days 85 All household members would NOT voluntarily stay at home for 7-10 days (Net) 9 Would stay home with meds 7 Would NOT stay home with meds 2 Some will, some will not 3 Don't know 3 Refused 1 41. If public health officials thought you might have been exposed to pandemic flu and recommended that you stay at home for 7 to 10 days so that you would not expose other people to the disease, is this something you would do, or not? \n\nIn order to keep pandemic flu from spreading and to protect the safety of children, some communities may close schools and daycare facilities for some period of time. The length of school and daycare closures would probably be tied to how serious the pandemic flu outbreak is. For instance, if there was a severe epidemic, schools and daycare might be closed for a long period of time.\n\n(Asked of total unemployed respondents who have no other employed adult household members and have major responsibility for household children under 5 years old in daycare or 5 to 17 years old; n= 12) 46. If schools and daycare facilities were closed for ONE MONTH to protect children because of a serious outbreak of the disease, how much of a problem would it be for you to take care of the children in your household for that long? Would it be a major problem, a minor problem, or not a problem?\n\nInsufficient data for analysis.\n\n47. If schools and daycare facilities were closed for ONE MONTH to protect children because of a serious outbreak of the disease, would you be able to arrange care for the children so that at least one adult in your family could go to work, or not?
