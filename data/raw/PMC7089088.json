{"title": "Actual Concepts in Rhinosinusitis: A Review of Clinical Presentations, Inflammatory Pathways, Cytokine Profiles, Remodeling, and Management", "body": "Rhinosinusitis is a large and heterogeneous group of diseases. Despite the fact that many papers have been published on this topic in the past decade, little is known about the etiology and pathophysiology. Nevertheless, the amount of knowledge available in the worldwide literature has changed our understanding of this entity.\n\nRhinosinusitis is commonly classified into acute (ARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) based on symptom duration. In ARS, an inflammatory reaction characterizes most uncomplicated, mild to moderate cases. Therefore, there is no longer an argument to prescribe an antibiotic as the first line of treatment but rather to privilege an anti-inflammatory treatment such as intranasal steroids. In severe and complicated cases, antibiotics combined with topical steroids should remain the treatment of choice. On the other hand, CRS is actually subdivided into two distinct entities (CRS with and without polyps), as growing evidence indicates that these entities have specific inflammatory pathways and cytokine profiles.\n\nThis paper is a review of the recent data on rhinosinusitis. The authors hope that this review helps clinicians gain a better understanding of how to manage such conditions.\n\nRhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous group of diseases, a significant and increasing health problem that affects about 15% of the population in Western countries [1, 2]. It has a substantial impact on patients\u2019 health-related quality of life and daily functioning. It represents a huge financial burden for society and the health care system as a result of direct and indirect costs. This establishes rhinosinusitis as one of the most expensive disorders experienced by, for example, the US population [2\u20134].\n\nOn the basis of the International Consensus on Rhinosinusitis, rhinosinusitis is subdivided into acute, subacute, recurrent, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Table 1 summarizes the different forms of rhinosinusitis.\n\n\n\nARS is a common upper respiratory tract disorder that involves inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa. It can be mild, moderate, or severe. Unlike a common cold, which typically resolves in less than 5 days, the symptomatology of ARS worsens after 5 days or persists more than 10 days, but in all cases, it resolves in less than 4 weeks [5, 6]. In the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps document, the symptoms can persist up to 12 weeks and be intermittent or persistent [1]. Primary care physicians diagnose and treat a large proportion of these infections. With appropriate therapy, signs and symptoms of ARS resolve completely. The diagnosis of ARS is based on patient history and clinical examination [6]. The symptomatology includes nasal congestion, purulent discharge, fever, headache, facial pain/pressure, dental pain, postnasal drip, cough, and tenderness around the sinus area [5, 6]. Table 2 summarizes the symptomatology and classifies it into major and minor symptoms and those found in the cases of complications. The symptoms typically worsen in the recumbent position and may interfere with sleep.\n\n\n\nNasal endoscopy reveals the mucosa and turbinates to be red and swollen with clear secretions that turn thicker, colored, and opaque within 5\u20137 days and then become clear again before symptom resolution. Symptoms that require immediate referral to a specialist are the following: periorbital edema, displacement of the eyeball, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, impaired extraocular movements, reduced visual acuity, severe headache or unilateral facial or orbital pain, frontal lump, and neurological signs and deficits. ARS is typically preceeded by a viral infection or an allergic reaction.\n\nViruses account for at least 80% to 90% of the causative agents of ARS. Among them, rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncitial virus, and parainfluenza virus play a major role [7\u20139]. ARS becomes a bacterial infection in about 0.5% to 2% of the cases. This is the case when the RS is severe or complicated. In these particular conditions, the \u201cinfernal trio\u201d (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarhalis infections) must be considered. Anaerobes have been reported in up to 30% of cases.\n\nThe pathophysiology of ARS involves interaction between a predisposing condition (allergic rhinitis, septal deformity, immune deficiency, environmental factors), a viral infection, and a consequent inflammatory response in the mucosal lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Table 3 summarizes different predisposing factors that can play a role in the development of ARS. The inflammatory process leads to the development of edema, engorgement, fluid extravasation, mucus production, and obstruction of the sinus ostium. This ostial obstruction impedes the normal ventilation and drainage of the sinus. There is then a decrease in the partial pressure in oxygen, a decrease in the ciliary clearance, a stasis of secretion, and a secundary bacterial infection. Thus, ARS is first regarded as an infectious process initiated by a viral infection.\n\n\n\nWhen we consider the cytokine profile, ARS results from a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine polarization associated with a high level of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2 and interferon-\u03b3. There is also release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8. These cytokines are considered very potent chemoattractive agents for neutrophils. Figure 1 is a schematic of the inflammatory cascade in the case of a rhinovirus infection.\n\n\n\nThe goals of treatment of ARS are to alleviate or minimize symptoms, eradicate pathogens and the underlying cause with therapies that halt inflammation, and promote sinus drainage. It is interesting to point out that 65% of ARS cases resolve spontaneously within 2 weeks [6]. Table 4 summarizes the different treatment options in cases of ARS. In the early phase of ARS, symptomatic treatment is sufficient. It consists of nasal douches, decongestants, exspectorants, mucolytics, and painkillers. In moderate ARS, monotherapy with an intranasal glucosteroid is recommended [5, 6, 10].\n\n\n\nGlucocorticoids act on the glucocorticoid receptor to inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators, which are upregulated during the inflammatory response. As a consequence, they reduce the mucosal inflammation, edema, cellular infiltration, and nasal congestion; improve the permeability of the sinus ostium; and thus facilitate the ventilation and drainage of the sinus. By reducing the eosinophilia, they can also be of great help in cases of comorbid allergic rhinitis, which occurs frequently in young patients and is a possible predisposing factor for the development of ARS. Treatment with intranasal steroids (INS) has proven to be safe and well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events no greater than those observed with placebo. In moderate to severe cases, topical steroids must be used in association with a broad spectrum antibiotic [11\u201313].\n\nMany studies including randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of such a combination. Actually, it provides greater symptomatic improvement than antibiotic therapy alone, shorter time to recovery, and greater regression of imaging abnormalities [12, 13].\n\nThe antibiotic is chosen acccording to the local bacterial resistance patterns, effectiveness, and safety. It must be effective against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, which are the most common bacteria implicated in uncomplicated, community-acquired acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. That is why in the United States, the first choice is amoxycillin [9, 14, 15]. It is also clear that the use of antibiotics is warranted in patients with severe or rapidly worsening symptoms regardless of the duration of illness, and that referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist is mandatory in such cases.\n\nNasal polyposis is a subgroup of CRS. It remains one of the most difficult challenges in otolaryngology, as its etiology and pathophysiology are still unclear, medical treatment is unsatisfactory, and because of frequent recurrences, repeated surgical procedures are often necessary.\n\nNasal polyps present as edematous, semitranslucent masses originating from the mucosal linings of the sinuses and prolapsing into the nasal cavities. Nasal endoscopy shows them to be bilateral. They are lateral to the middle turbinates in the middle meatus and are frequently present in the superior meatus. When the polyposis is unilateral, another diagnosis must be considered (e.g., a Schneiderian papilloma or a tumor in adults, or a dermoid cyst, meningoencephalocele, or nasal glioma in children).\n\nThe symptomatology is similar to that of CRS without polyps (Table 5), with frequent nasal congestion, anterior and posterior nasal discharge, and recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infection. Reduction or loss of the sense of smell is a very important symptom in patients with nasal polyps. Headache and facial pain/pressure are less common than in CRS without polyps.\n\nConcerning the bacteriology, all the organisms described in the section \u201cChronic Rhinosinusitis Without Polyps\u201d can infect a nasal polyposis. The \u201cinfernal trio\u201d can be associated with recurrence of the polyposis during an acute bacterial exacerbation of sinusitis. Antibiotic-resistant organisms, biofilms, and osteitis also can be associated with the polyposis. A specific item to discuss in case of nasal polyposis is the role of bacterial colonization by S. aureus\u2013producing enterotoxins [31, 85\u201387].\n\nEnterotoxins from S. aureus act locally as superantigens on T lymphocytes and induce a multiclonal B-cell activation. Release of cytokines (IL-5) from Th2 cells results in an eosinophilic activation with release of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP). ECP causes tissue damage, edema formation, and albumin accumulation. B-cell activation will result in the production of multiclonal IgE by plasma. In contrast, in patients with CRS without polyps, there is no evidence of increased prevalence of enterotoxin-specific IgE antibodies. Figure 4 shows the possible role of enterotoxins producing S. aureus in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps.\n\n\n\nNasal polyposis constitutes a heterogeneous group of diseases. Based on the type of inflammatory infiltrate, we can subdivide the nasal polyps into two groups: eosinophilic and neutrophilic. Table 9 lists the different subpopulations of nasal polyps.\n\n\n\nNasal polyposis affects about 4% of the general population in Western countries. It is not more common in atopic individuals than in healthy controls. It is interesting to note that 29% of the Belgian population is sensitized to at least one aeroallergen [88]. More than 40% of nasal polyposis is associated with nonallergic asthma.\n\nAbout 25% of nasal polyposis is associated with aspirin sensitivity (Samter\u2019s triad). Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease represents a subset of patients with severe recalcitrant nasal polyposis and asthma in the setting of aspirin sensitivity. The underlying pathophysiology appears to be dysregulation in the eicosanoid metabolism pathway, leading to increased production of cysteinyl leukotrienes and decreased levels of prostaglandins.\n\nChurg-Strauss syndrome, or allergic granulomatous angiitis is characterized by inflammation of the small arteries and veins in individuals with a history of asthma or allergy. Besides inflammation of the blood vessels, there is also an increase in the number of eosinophils and inflammatory nodular lesions. Nasal polyps are present in about 50% of patients. AFS is associated with nasal polyposis in more than 80% of cases.\n\nHistologically, polyps are covered by respiratory pseudostratified columnar epithelium with some areas of squamous metaplasia. There is frequent epithelial damage (epithelium shedding) and variable stages of thickened basement membrane. Pseudocyst formation and edema are two major characteristics of nasal polyps. These pseudocysts contain albumin and other plasma proteins. The number of vessels and glands is reduced, and there is virtually no neuronal structure. Fibroblasts and infiltrating inflammatory cells are localized around pseudocyst formations. EG2+ (activated) eosinophils are usually located around vessels and glands and are predominant in about 80% of patients with nasal polyps. The number of degranulating epithelial mast cells is high [51, 53, 55, 89].\n\nIn nasal polyps, the ECM is severely damaged. This can be explained by the fact that the balance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMPs has been shown to be displaced in favour of MMPs, especially MMP-9 and MMP-7 [56]. It also has been demonstrated that there are modifications in the angiogenesis in nasal polyps via the vascular endothelial growth factor [90].\n\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor plays a role in inducing edema, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. It was demonstrated that it is intensively expressed in nasal polyps, mainly in inflammatory cells but also in epithelial cells. TGF-\u03b21 upregulates its secretion.\n\nNasal polyposis in Caucasian patients has a predominantly Th2-biased eosinophilic inflammation (Table 7) [17, 18, 20, 23, 57, 58, 91\u201393]. This is associated with high levels of IL-5, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and eotaxin that play a role in the recruitment and activation of eosinophils and decrease their apoptosis [94\u201396].\n\nConcentrations in ECPs are high. There is an upregulation of cysteinyl-leukotriene synthesis, but no significant differences in polyps were found between patients with and without Samter\u2019s triad and asthma. This can explain some benefit observed with a treatment with anti-leukotriene modifiers in nasal polyposis [97].\n\nThere is a decrease in FoxP3 expression accompanied by upregulation of Tbet and GATA-binding protein 3 and a downregulation of TGF-\u03b21 [57]. After treatment with INS, FoxP3 expression is increased [58].\n\nElevated levels of total and specific IgE in the polyp tissue are another major characteristic in nasal polyposis. Their concentrations may be very high (>1,000 kU/L) but are often unrelated to serum IgE levels and to skin prick test positivity, which is in contrast to allergic rhinitis. The production is very heterogeneous. Bachert et al. [31, 91, 98, 99] demonstrated three different categories of patients: nasal polyposis group 1 demonstrated no measurable specific IgE; nasal polyposis group 2 selected specific IgE; and the third group demonstrated a multiclonal specific IgE, including IgE to S. aureus enterotoxins, a high total IgE level, and a high prevalence of asthma. In this latter group, patients are usually sensitized to aspirin [31, 91, 98, 99].\n\nBefore considering the treatment, it is interesting to note that Chinese patients have neutrophilic and not eosinophilic polyps. Such polyps are also seen in inherited diseases such as primary ciliary diskinesia and cystic fibrosis. Chinese patients with polyps are characterized by B- and T-cell activation, a minor eosinophilic inflammation compared with polyps from white individuals, and a decrease in TGF-\u03b21 in comparison with controls. One third of patients with polyps showed an IgE response to S. aureus enterotoxins [100]. Figure 5 shows the putative mechanisms, cells, and mediators implied in CRS with polyps and Chinese polyps.\n\n\n\nThe management of nasal polyps is extremely individual and must be discussed case by case, as the expectations of one patient are not necessary the same as those of others. The treatment can be medical and surgical [101, 102].\n\nThe goals of treatment are to re-establish the nasal airway and nasal breathing, minimize symptoms, improve the sense of smell, treat co-existing diseases such as asthma, improve quality of life, and prevent complications [103]. Before starting any therapy, it is important to inform patients that nasal polyposis is a chronic sinus disease that is impossible to cure, but that we can potentially stabilize it with different medications. Recurrence is the rule, but observance of (compliance with) the treatment can postpone for as long as possible the relapse of the disease. In Samter\u2019s triad, it is important to avoid definitively any form of acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs.\n\nCorticosteroids are the first-choice treatment approach for an eosinophilic polyposis, as they can suppress many phases of the inflammatory process. For example, they inhibit the liberation of vasoactive mediators, reducing vasodilatation, fluid extravasation, edema, and local deposit of mediators. They also reduce recruitment of inflammatory cells, fibroblast proliferation, and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins.\n\nSystemic application affects all polyp tissue within the nose and sinuses but has the disadvantage of systemic adverse effects when used for long-term treatment. Hissaria et al. [104] demonstrated with a randomized, placebo-controlled trial the efficacy of a 14-day course of 50 mg of prednisolone on patients\u2019 symptoms, quality of life, and endoscopic score. Nevertheless, from a clinical point of view, some patients may experience a \u201crebound effect\u201d after a course of systemic corticosteroids [104\u2013106].\n\nTopical application of corticosteroids dramatically reduces the risk of systemic side effects [107]. Many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of INS in nasal polyposis even if the intrasinus portion of the polyps is not reachable with a nasal spray [108\u2013112]. Among all the specialities, mometasone furoate and fluticasone furoate are the newest and safest molecules with the lowest bioavailability.\n\nIn nasal polyposis, antibiotics at full dose are recommended to treat acute bacterial exacerbation of sinusitis, but in recent years, considerable evidence has emerged to suggest that macrolide antibiotics at low dose could play a role in the treatment of nasal polyposis [113\u2013120]. Macrolides have immunomodulatory properties in addition to their well-established antimicrobial activity. Indeed, macrolide antibiotics inhibit synthesis and/or secretion of proinflammatory cytkines (IL-5, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor). They have many effects on neutrophils: they decrease the neutrophil oxidative burst, inhibit neutrophil migration to inflammatory sites, increase the apoptosis of the neutrophils, and inhibit the neutrophil adhesion. They also decrease the eosinophilic inflammation, reduce the goblet cell secretion, and decrease bronchoconstriction.\n\nAll the studies confirm clinical efficacy with a significant reduction in the size of the polyps and reduction in symptoms (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, purulence, headache), and the relapse of the polyps seems to be delayed. However, all the studies demonstrated the necessity of long-term use (3\u201312 months) and the slow onset. After 2 weeks of treatment, only 5% of patients indicated improvement, while after 4 weeks, 48% were improved, after 8 weeks, 63% were improved, and after 12 weeks, 71% were improved.\n\nWhen we consider such a long-term treatment, gastrointestinal intolerance can be a problem for the observance of the treatment. Moreover at low dose, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria should be taken into consideration.\n\nAntihistamines are typically one of the medications of choice to treat allergic rhinitis. Despite several theoretical pharmacologic properties applicable for the treatment of nasal polyposis (Consensus Group on New-Generation Antihistmaines [CONGA] [121]), little has been published about such an indication [122\u2013127]. Anti-leukotrienes have shown some effects on nasal polyposis [128, 129].\n\nChanges in the arachidonic acid metabolism have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis, especially in aspirin-sensitive individuals, and cysteinyl leukotrienes have been found in increased levels in nasal tissue from those patients, whereas concentrations of prostaglandin E2 were decreased. Furthermore, the leukotriene C4 synthase was found to be upregulated in patients with nasal polyps, as were as the number of leukocytes expressing the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor as compared with their non\u2013aspirin-sensitive counterparts. Thus, the use of leukotrienes antagonists, especially in aspirin-sensitive nasal polyp patients, seems appropriate. However, large-scale, controlled trials in clearly characterized patients\u2014with or without aspirin sensitivity\u2014are lacking thus far. In patients with aspirin sensitivity, aspirin desensitization can be recommended [130, 131].\n\nAspirin desensitization consists of administering incremental oral doses to reach a maintenance dose of greater than 650 mg/d, then inducing a refractory period of a few days. Continuous treatment over years may lead to a significant reduction in number of sinus infections per year, improvement in olfaction, and a reduction in use of systemic corticosteroids. Treatment with daily aspirin may be a therapeutic option for patients who do not respond to topical and systemic corticosteroids. As new treatment options, we must consider doxycycline, anti\u2013IL-5, and anti-IgE.\n\nDoxycycline is an antibiotic that also inhibits the synthesis of MMPs and MMP-9 activity in vitro. However, doxycycline does not affect the MMP-9 inhibitors (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and 2) [132]. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated in 32 patients a significant decrease in the endoscopic nasal polyp score 4\u201312 weeks after the start of the doxycline treatment compared with placebo. The concentrations of IgE, myeloperoxidase, MMP-9, and ECP decreased significantly in nasal secretions of doxycycline-treated patients. In a clinical setting, the use of doxycycline offers an additional advantage of providing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, resulting in a decrease in nasal polyp size [133].\n\nAs IL-5 is increased in polyp tissue and related to eosinophilic inflammation, and anti\u2013IL-5 monoclonal antibody treatment in vitro induced eosinophil apoptosis, this cytokine was a reasonable target for antibody therapy in nasal polyps. Different humanized anti\u2013IL-5 monoclonal antibodies have been developed and studied in asthma, and a pilot study in nasal polyposis has provided promising results [134, 135]. Considering the marked local production of IgE antibodies in nasal polyps and their relation to severity of disease, it appears that local IgE is functional and involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation. Thus, strategies to antagonize IgE could be relevant. Treatment of allergic asthma and rhinitis with omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, causes a marked reduction in circulating free IgE levels. No studies in nasal polyposis have been published. However, at least two teams have already thought about possible clinical applications of anti-IgE in severe nasal polyposis regardless of whether it is associated with corticodependent asthma [85, 136].\n\nThe management of nasal polyposis usually involves medical treatment and frequently surgery as an adjunct to the medical treatment. Surgical removal of nasal polyps is indicated for patients not responding adequately to medical management, those with continued or recurrent infections, as well as patients who are developing mucoceles or other complications of sinusitis. Patients with polyps and asthma may benefit from surgery by reduction of one trigger of asthma.\n\nThe type of surgery to perform is the subject of debate in Europe. What is the respective place of endoscopic-guided polypectomy versus functional endoscopic sinus surgery versus nasalization as recommended by Dr. Jankowski from Nancy? Is functional endoscopic sinus surgery still the gold standard? Must we open all the ethmoid compartments? Must we clear the frontal recess completely? Must we do a large sphenoidotomy in all cases? All these questions remain unanswered.\n\nAs long as a complete ethmoidectomy is recommended, powered instrumentation with microdebrider appears particularly helpful in extensive polyposis [137\u2013140]. It allows a precise removal of the polyps under a good visual control with preservation of the anatomy. It minimizes mucosal trauma and stripping and guarantees minimal crust formation, a rapid mucosal healing, and a low incidence of synechiae formation.\n\nIn revision surgery, because the anatomy can be highly distorted, but even in huge polyposis, the surgery can be conducted with a navigation system [141\u2013143]. This gives the surgeon more confidence, particularly for the frontal sinus area and the sphenoid sinus, and seems to reduce the rate of complication.\n\nEndoscopic sinus surgery has been shown to lead to significant improvement in total nasal resistance as measured with rhinomanometry, in nasal volume as measured by acoustic rhinometry, in ciliary beat frequency, in mucociliary clearance as measured by saccharin test, and in olfaction as measured by University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Increasing evidence also indicates that management of polyposis has a benefit for the lower airway and for the patient\u2019s health-related quality of life [80, 82, 83, 144\u2013153]. However, surgery, as complete as it can be, is not the final and definitive step to treat a nasal polyposis that remains as long as we know a chronic inflammatory disease whose etiology and pathophysiology are still poorly understood. Long-term treatment with topical steroids after surgery remains a rule for eosinophilic polyps to reduce the incidence of polyp recurrences or prolong the symptom-free time interval [154\u2013156].\n\nRhinosinusitis represents a very large and heterogeneous group of diseases. ARS is mainly an inflammatory disorder initiated by a viral infection. INS seem to be the best first option for treatment of mild to moderate cases.\n\nCRS without polyps is a mainly a neutrophilic inflammation. Antibiotics combined with INS is the first choice of treatment, but functional sinus surgery is usually necessary to improve the patient. CRS with polyps is the most frustrating disease for clinicians, as recurrences are the rule. Asthma and aspirin intolerance are the most common comorbidities. In Caucasian patients, it is associated with an eosinophilic infiltration. Fungi or S. aureus enterotoxins could play a role in the pathophysiology. Glucocorticoids associated with large sinus surgery were for a long time the only treatment, but new treatment options seem promising, specifically doxycycline, anti\u2013IL-5, or anti-IgE."}
