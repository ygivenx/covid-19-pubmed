{"title": "Camelids Are Not Ruminants", "body": "Camelids are not ruminants taxonomically, physiologically, or behaviorally. 7, 8 Most importantly, from a veterinary standpoint, camelids and ruminants differ in susceptibility to infectious and parasitic diseases. The differences between camelids and ruminants should exclude camelids from being classified as ruminants. Nonetheless, camelids have been placed in various categories, such as \"exotic animals,\" \"wild animals,\" \"other livestock species,\" and \"ruminants,\" by state and federal regulators. Camelids have consistently been subjected to sudden, adverse regulations (some inappropriate) when an emerging disease of livestock appears on the scene.\n\nThe closing of the Canadian border to camelids when bovine spongiform encephalitis was diagnosed in a cow in Alberta, Canada, is a case in point. Camelids were classified as ruminants and subjected to all restrictions placed on ruminants. The fact that camelids have never been diagnosed with any of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies anywhere in the world (and are not ruminants) was not given proper consideration.\n\nWhen questioned about that action, the response was that ruminants are defined by an \"encyclopedia\" as animals that chew a cud, are cloven hoofed, and have three-or four-chambered stomachs. Regulators completely disregarded the scientific literature that clearly shows that foregut fermentation, complex multicompartmentalized stomachs, food regurgitation, and rechewing are not limited to \"ruminants\" but are found in species as diverse as kangaroos and nonhuman primates. 13 In kangaroos, regurgitation and rechewing is referred to as merycism (Greek, \"chewing the cud\"). Foregut fermentation and multicompartmented stomachs are also seen in many species,\n\nThe risk of emerging, reemerging, foreign, and intentionally introduced animal disease is real, and many perceive this as a growing problem. The understanding of animal-human pathogen relationships relies on scientific information about various species and populations of animals. National regulatory statutes that provide disease protection between animals and humans must be current and must utilize up-to-date scientific data to protect human health and our food supply while not jeopardizing or overregulating any one animal.\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are the federal agencies tasked with protecting the nation's wildlife, livestock industries, companion animals, human population, and the food supply from disease. The need for regulations has become more acute with the advent of modern transportation systems that allow movement of animals from any part of the world in a matter of hours. Also, our animal and human populations, along with the U.S. food supply, will now and always need to be protected against the threat of intentionally introduced animal and human disease because bioterrorism will remain a threat.\n\nIn a late December 2003 news conference, then-Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman made the following statement while talking about a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that had been diagnosed Dec. 23, 2003 , in a cow in the state of Washington: \"The USDA has a primary goal of using science as the basis for decisions involving livestock health matters.\"\n\nIt is not clear that all federal regulatory officials always use known science to draft regulations and apply them to risk situations. Zoo veterinarians ask only that camelids, which are classified as domestic animals, and other species of captive and free-ranging wild animals be treated fairly, using science-based consensus of understanding that may be incorporated into laws, regulations, policies, and programs. Current scientific including the hippopotamus, kangaroo, colobus monkey, and peccary. 4 Modern paleontologic and taxonomic scientists clearly state that camelids belong in a separate suborder Tylopoda (Latin, \"padded foot\") in the order Artiodactyla, which is distinct from the suborder Ruminantia* (Box 46-1).\n\nCamelid evolution began in North America 40 to 50 million years ago in the early Eocene epoch. 6, 7 Separation of the Tylopoda and Ruminantia occurred early in the evolutionary process, when the progenitors of both groups were small goat-sized animals with simple stomachs. 33 Tylopods and ruminants continued to evolve by what is known as parallel evolution, which is the development of similarities in separate but related evolutionary lineages through the operation of similar selective factors acting on both lines 6, 7, 33 (Figure 46-1) .\n\nThe Pleistocene epoch was characterized by a series of periods of extreme cold and glaciations in northern North America and Europe. The last glacial retreat occurred about 10,000 years ago, marking the beginning of the Recent epoch.\n\nAsia and Alaska are now separated by the 90-km (56-mile)-wide Bering Strait. However, during the height of one of the early Pleistocene glacial periods, the sea level was lowered sufficiently to expose a wide land bridge. Plant and animal species moved back and forth across this bridge; the camel line of Camelidae migrated from North America into Asia, where the evolutionary process continued and domestication took place.\n\nProgenitors of the South American camelids (SACs) (guanaco, vicu\u00f1a, llama, and alpaca) migrated to South America at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch (~3 million years ago), when an open land connection between North and South America developed. 6 Evolution continued in South America, where llama and alpaca were domesticated. 9,10,35\n\nAnatomic and physiologic differences between camelids and ruminants abound (Table 46-1) .\n\nSusceptibility to infectious and parasitic agents is of greater concern. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that camelids should be classified as ruminants because, \"regardless of their taxonomic classification, camelids meet the definition of ruminants and are regulated as ruminants based on their susceptibility to ruminant diseases such as foot and mouth disease, tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis, M. tuberculosis, and M. avium), brucellosis, Johne's disease, etc.\" 11 It is true that there are diseases that camelids, cattle, sheep, and goats all acquire, but a careful appraisal of Tables 46-2 through 46-9 should dispel the myth that Text continued on page 383\n\nEvolutionary pathways Diverged 40 million years ago.

Spontaneous. 34 In fact, they are quite resistant to many regulated ruminant diseases.\n\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus is highly contagious in cattle and sheep. When llamas and alpacas were first imported from South America to the United States for the blossoming private llama industry, government officials expressed concern that llamas and alpacas might pose a risk for the introduction of FMD to the United States. The USDA expended con-siderable experimental effort to determine the risk. It was concluded that llamas and alpacas could be infected by inoculation but did not acquire FMD when cohabiting with infected swine, in contrast with almost 100% of cattle that acquired the infection. 6, 25, 30 The virus could not be detected after 14 days postinoculation.\n\nThe same could be said for vesicular stomatitis. Only one animal has been diagnosed with the natural disease. 2 Bovine tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is another concern of government officials. Llamas and alpacas have developed the disease under natural conditions, when cohabiting with infected elk, but have shown resistance to acquiring TB, in contrast to ruminants. 31 Llamas and alpacas have been experimentally infected with Brucella abortus, but the natural disease does not occur in these species. 12, 13 There are no reports of the transmission of any regulated ruminant disease from camelids to ruminants.\n\nCamelids are not ruminants taxonomically, anatomically, physiologically, or behaviorally. Camelids also are not a threat to the livestock industry because they either have total resistance to infection or have minimal susceptibility to the infectious and parasitic diseases of ruminants."}
