{"title": "Host shifts result in parallel genetic changes when viruses evolve in closely related species 1 2", "body": "Host shifts -where a pathogen jumps into and establishes in a new host species -are a major 32 source of emerging infectious diseases. RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [1] [2] [3] [4] , with 33 HIV, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus all having been acquired by humans from other host species 34 [5] [6] [7] . Whilst some pathogens may be pre-adapted to a novel host, there are increasing numbers of 35 examples demonstrating that adaptation to the new host occurs following a host shift [8, 9] . These 36 adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress 37 the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [10, 11] . For example, in the 2013-38 2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early 39 in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and 40 decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [12, 13] . Likewise, a 41 switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the 42 virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [14, 15] \n\nIn some instances adaptation to a novel host relies on specific mutations that arise repeatedly 45 whenever a pathogen switches to a given host. For example, in the jump of HIV-1 from chimps to 46 humans, codon 30 of the gag gene has undergone a change that increases virus replication in 47 humans, and this has occurred independently in all three HIV-1 lineages [5, 16] . Similarly, five 48 parallel mutations have been observed in the two independent epidemics of SARS coronavirus 49 following its jump from palm civets into humans [17] . Similar patterns have been seen in \n\nThe host phylogeny is important for determining a pathogens ability to infect a novel host, with 59 pathogens tending to replicate most efficiently when they infect a novel host that is closely related 60 to their original host [2, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Here, we asked whether viruses acquire the same genetic changes 61 when evolving in the same and closely related host species. We experimentally evolved replicate 62 lineages of an RNA virus called Drosophila C Virus (DCV; Discistroviridae) in 19 species of 63 Drosophilidae that vary in their relatedness and shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million 64 years ago [35, 36] . We then sequenced the genomes of the evolved viral lineages and tested 65 whether the same genetic changes arose when the virus was evolved in closely related host species.\n\nParallel genetic changes occur in DCV lineages that have evolved in the same host species\n\nTo examine how viruses evolve in different host species we serially passaged DCV in 19 species of 73 Drosophilidae. In total we infected 22,095 adult flies and generated 173 independent replicate 74 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

We deep sequenced the evolved virus genomes to generate over 75 740,000 300bp sequence reads from each viral lineage. Out of 8989 sites, 584 contained a SNP with 76 a derived allele frequency >0.05 in at least one viral lineage, and 84 of these were tri-allelic. None of 77 these variants were found at an appreciable frequency in five sequencing libraries produced from 78 the ancestral virus, indicating that they had spread though populations during the experiment 79 ( Figure 1 ). In multiple cases these variants had nearly reached fixation (Figure 1 ).\n\nWe next examined whether the same genetic changes occur in parallel when different populations 82 encounter the same host species. Of the 584 SNPs, 102 had derived allele frequencies >0.05 in at 83 least two viral lineages, and some had risen to high frequencies in multiple lineages (Figure 1 ). We 84 estimated the genetic differentiation between viral lineages by calculating F ST . We found that viral 85 lineages that had evolved within the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to 86 lineages from other host species (Figure 2 ; P<0.001). Furthermore, we found no evidence of 87 differences in substitution biases in the different host species (Fisher Exact Test: p=0.14; see 88 methods), suggesting that this pattern is not driven by changes in the types of mutations in different 89 host species.\n\nTo examine the genetic basis of parallel evolution, we individually tested whether each SNP in the 92 DCV genome showed a signature of parallel evolution among viral lineages passaged in the same 93 host species (i.e. we repeated the analysis in Figures 2 for each SNP). We identified 56 polymorphic 94 sites with a significant signal of parallel evolution within the same host species (P<0.05; significantly 95 parallel sites are shown with a red asterisk in Figure 1 ; the false discovery rate is estimated to be \n\nMutations ordered by position in DCV genome 214  352  363  454  794  849  1206  1281  1290  1299  1331  1445  1529  1576  1589  1811  1829  1850  1901  1976  2018  2318  2509  2610  2804  2891  2930  3023  3111  3154  3291  3349  3491  3721  3761  3807  3824  3864  3884  3966  3989  3998  4118  4832  4934  5219  5453  5510  5552  5573  5696  5936  6008  6227  6235  6312  6495  6551  6719  6722  6787  6927  6990  7014  7016  7039  7084  7087  7388  7703  7711  7922  7923  7936  7939  7981  7992  7997  8000  8012  8041  8069  8070  8072  8073  8075  8076  8079  8084  8142  8144  8153  8154  8282  8285  8294  8392  8677  8761  8845  8869  8961 Mutations ordered by position in DCV genome \n\nViruses in closely related hosts are genetically more similar 120 121\n\nWe investigated if viruses passaged through closely related hosts showed evidence of parallel 122 genetic changes. We calculated F ST between all possible pairs of viral lineages that had evolved in 123 different host species. We found that viral lineages from closely related hosts were more similar to 124 each other than viral lineages from more distantly related hosts ( Figure 3A ). This is reflected in a \n\nWhen a pathogen infects a novel host species, it finds itself in a new environment to which it must 142 adapt [4, 8, 10, 44] . When DCV was passaged through different species of Drosophilidae, we found 143 the same genetic changes arose repeatedly in replicate viral lineages in the same host species. Such 144 repeatable parallel genetic changes to the same host environment are compelling evidence that 145 these changes are adaptive [20] . We then examined whether these same genetic changes might 146 occur in closely related host species, as these are likely to present a similar environment for the 147 virus. We found that viruses evolved in closely related hosts were more similar to each other than 148 viruses that evolved in more distantly related species. Therefore, mutations that evolve in one host 149 species frequently arise when the virus infects closely related hosts. This finding of parallel genetic 150 changes in closely related host species suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also 151 become better adapted to closely related host species.\n\nPhylogenetic patterns of host adaptation may in part explain why pathogens tend to be more likely 154 to jump between closely related host species. This pattern is seen in nature, where host shifts tend 155 to occur most frequently between closely related hosts, and in laboratory cross-infection studies,\n\nwhere viruses tend to replicate more rapidly when the new host is related to the pathogens natural The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/226175 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 acquired adaptations to their host species that benefitted them when they infected closely related 161 species. Our results demonstrate that this pattern is apparent at the level of specific nucleotides, 162 and can arise very shortly after a host shift. The function of these mutations is unknown, but in other 163 systems adaptations after host shifts have been found to enhance the ability of the virus to bind to 164 host receptors [11] , increase replication rates [16] or avoid the host immune response [8, 10, 45] .\n\nWhile the susceptibility of a novel host is correlated to its relatedness to the pathogens' original 167 host, it is also common to find exceptions to this pattern. This is seen both in nature when 168 pathogens shift between very distant hosts [46, 47] , and in laboratory cross-infection experiments 169 [33, 34] . This pattern is also seen in our data where we also observe parallel genetic changes 170 occurring between more distantly related hosts. For example, a mutation at position 8072 was not 171 only near fixation in most of the lineages infecting two closely related species, but also occurred at a 172 high frequency in replicate lineages in a phylogenetically distant host (Figure 1 ).\n\nIn conclusion, we have found that host relatedness can be important in determining how viruses 175 evolve when they find themselves in a new host. This study suggests that while some genetic 176 changes will be found only in specific hosts, we frequently see the same changes occurring in closely 177 related host species. These phylogenetic patterns suggest that mutations that adapt a virus to one 178 host may also adapt it to closely related host species. Therefore, there may be a knock-on effect, 179 where a host shift leaves closely related species vulnerable to the new disease.\n\nVirus production 185 186 DCV is a positive sense RNA virus in the family Discistroviridae that was isolated from D. 187 melanogaster, which it naturally infects in the wild [48, 49] . To minimise the amount of genetic 188 variation in the DCV isolate we used to initiate the experimental evolution study, we aimed to isolate 189 single infectious clones of DCV using a serial dilution procedure. DCV was produced in Schneider's \n\nThis processes was then repeated using the DCV samples from the first dilution series. One clone,\n\nB6A, was selected for amplification and grown in cell culture as described above.

The Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of 205 the DCV was 6.32 x 10 9 infectious particles per ml using the .\n\nInoculating fly species\n\nWe passaged the virus through 19 species of Drosophilidae, with 6-10 independent replicate 210 passages for each species. We selected species from across the phylogeny (that shared a common 211 ancestor approximately 40 million years ago [35, 36] ), but included clades of closely related species 212 that recently shared common ancestors less than 5 million years ago (Figure 1 ). All fly stocks were 213 reared at 22\u00b0C. Stocks of each fly species were kept in 250ml bottles at staggered ages. Flies were 214 collected and sexed, and males were placed on cornmeal medium for 4 days before inoculation. \n\nAfter passaging the virus, we sequenced evolved viral lineages from 19 host species, with a mean of 240 9 independent replicate lineages of the virus per species (range 6-10 replicates). cDNA was 241 synthesised using Invitrogen Superscript III reverse-transcriptase with random hexamer primers 242 (25\u00b0C 5mins, 50\u00b0C 50mins, 70\u00b0C 15mins). The genome of the evolved viruses, along with the initial 243 DCV ancestor (x5) were then amplified using Q5 high fidelity polymerase (NEB) in nine overlapping 244 PCR reactions (see supplementary Table S2 for PCR primers and cycle conditions).

We found the mean SNP frequency was 0.000923 and the highest frequency of 289 any SNP was 0.043 across the ancestral viruses. We therefore included a SNP in our analyses if its 290 frequency was >0.05 in any of the evolved viral lineages. For all analyses we included all three alleles 291 at triallelic sites.\n\nParallel evolution within species\n\nAs a measure of genetic differentiation we estimated F ST between all the virus lineages based on the (1). H w was calculated separately for the two lineages being compared, and 302 the unweighted mean used in equation (1).\n\nTo examine whether there had been parallel evolution among viral lineages that had evolved within 305 the same fly species, we calculated the mean F ST between lineages that had evolved in the same fly 306 species, and compared this to the mean F ST between lineages that had evolved in different fly 307 species. We tested whether this difference was statistically significant using a permutation test. The 308 fly species labels were randomly reassigned to the viral lineages, and we calculated the mean F ST 309 between lineages that had evolved in the same fly species. This was repeated 1000 times to 310 generate a null distribution of the test statistic, and this was then compared to the observed value.\n\nTo identify individual SNPs with a signature of parallel evolution within species, we repeated this 313 procedure separately for each SNP.\n\nParallel evolution between species\n\nWe next examined whether viral lineages that had evolved in different fly species tended to be more 318 similar if the fly species were more closely related. Considering all pairs of viral lineages from 319 different host species, we correlated pairwise F ST with the genetic distance between the fly species.\n\nTo test the significance of this correlation, we permuted the fly species over the Drosophila 321 phylogeny and recalculated the Pearson correlation coefficient. This was repeated 1000 times to 322 generate a null distribution of the test statistic, and this was then compared to the observed value.\n\nTo identify individual SNPs whose frequencies were correlated with the genetic distance between 324 hosts we repeated this procedure separately for each SNP.\n\nWe confirmed there was no relationship between rates of molecular evolution (SNP frequency) and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/226175 doi: bioRxiv preprint previously [34] . We also examined the distribution of SNPs and whether they were synonymous or 331 non-synonymous (see supplementary results).\n\nTo test whether there were systematic differences in the types of mutations occurring in the 334 different host species, we classified all the SNPs into the six possible types (A/G, A/T, A/C, G/T, G/C 335 and C/T). We then counted the number of times each type of SNP arose in each host species at a 336 frequency above 5% and in at least one biological replicate (SNPs in multiple biological replicates 337 were only counted once). This resulted in a contingency table with 6 columns and 19 rows. We 338 tested for differences between the species in the relative frequency of the 6 SNP types by simulation 339 [62] .\n\nSequence data (fastq files) are available in the NCBI SRA (Accession: SRP119720).
