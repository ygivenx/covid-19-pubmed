New York was the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States in late spring and summer 2009. 1, 2 Initially, the problem was to differentiate and identify H1N1 from other influenzalike illnesses (ILIs). Because H1N1 is a variant of influenza A, rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for influenza A were used to screen for influenza A in hopes of identifying H1N1 before the definitive results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were available. Unfortunately, RT-PCR testing by the health department was restricted, making laboratory-based diagnoses impossible. 3 To compound the diagnostic difficulties, the H1N1 pandemic occurred while other respiratory viruses were still circulating in the community, including early seasonal human influenza A. Therefore, physicians had to differentiate H1N1 from human seasonal influenza A, as well as from other respiratory viruses presenting as ILIs. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] As the pandemic progressed into the summer, pneumonia attributable to other respiratory viruses and human influenza were no longer detectable in the community. By July, many patients presenting with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to Winthrop-University Hospital's Emergency Department (ED) had H1N1 pneumonia. 4, 11 We present a case of Legionnaires' disease mimicking H1N1 pneumonia, admitted in the midst of the ''herald wave'' of the H1N1 pandemic in early summer.\n\nA 62-year-old man presented at the ED with complaints of fever, chills, weakness, and malaise for 3 to 4 days. The patient also complained of vomiting, diarrhea, and dry cough. He denied any recent or close sick contacts or recent travel. The patient had no known drug allergies. In the ED, he had a temperature of 103 F, with a heart rate of 87/minutge, and his respiratory rate was 20/minute. On physical examination, he had right lower-lobe rales. The remainder of his physical examination was unrevealing, except for an irregular pulse and a faint, nonradiating (2/6) systolic murmur.\n\nOn admission, his white blood cell count was 9.8 K/mL (normal range, 3.9 to 11.0 K/mL), with a differential of 87% neutrophils (normal range, 42% to 75%), 7% stabs (normal range, 0 to 5%), 4% lymphocytes (normal range, 21% to 51%), and 2% monocytes (normal range, 0 to 10%), and with a platelet count of 158 K/mL (normal range, 160 to 392 K/mL). His erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 111 mm/hour (normal range, 1 to 20 mm/hour), and his C-reactive protein level was 205 mg/L (normal range, <3.0 mg/ L). His serum sodium level was 132 mEq/L (normal HEART & LUNG VOL \n\nDuring epidemics and pandemics, the initial cases are often difficult to recognize. Later, as the pandemic becomes widespread, clinical diagnoses are usually relatively straightforward. 4, 11, 12 During the H1N1 pandemic in the New York area in spring and summer 2009, many unexpected diagnostic problems rapidly became apparent. Firstly, the human seasonal influenza season was unusually long, and extended into late spring and early summer. Other respiratory viruses were also circulating in the community at this time when the number of potential H1N1 cases increased. Diagnostic difficulties with testing were problematic. The rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B, Quidel, San Diego) was used to determine which ED-admitted patients needed influenza precautions and oseltamivir, and these tests were negative in 30% of cases. 4, 13, 14 Because positive rapid influenza A testing predicted subsequent RT-PCR positivity for H1N1, no diagnostic or infection-control problems occurred with these patients. Admitted adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, however, were problematic because most of these patients clinically had H1N1 pneumonia, but these cases could not be confirmed or ruled out by RT-PCR. Because the health department was overwhelmed with requests for RT-PCR, such testing was restricted. 4 To help alleviate these problems with laboratory diagnoses, clinical criteria were developed by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital for the sake of reliable clinical diagnoses of probable H1N1 pneumonia. 15 In our experience, the most important laboratory markers for H1N1 in admitted adults with ILIs and fevers >102 F include otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, highly elevated CPK, or mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT). 10, 15 Many adult patients admitted via the ED with a diagnosis of influenza or pneumonia had infectious and In our case report, the patient presented in the midst of the H1N1 pandemic with fever, shortness of breath, and ''pneumonia'' to the Winthrop-University Hospital ED. His rapid influenza A test was negative, but other clinical findings were consistent with H1N1 pneumonia, ie, relative lymphopenia and elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT). 15 He also exhibited several key laboratory test markers of Legionnaires' disease, ie, relative lymphopenia, elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), hypophosphatemia, and highly elevated (>2 \u00c2 n) serum ferritin levels. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The CXR findings in Legionnaires' disease are legion. [21] [22] [23] Although there is no characteristic CXR appearance of Legionnaires' disease, the behavior of the infiltrates is characteristic, ie, they are rapidly progressive and asymmetric. 11, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] With H1N1, the initial CXR is clear or shows what appears to be unilateral or bilateral basilar atelectasis. In severe cases, bilateral patchy interstitial infiltrates may be appear on the CXR after 48 to 72 hours of H1N1 pneumonia. 4, 24 The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for Legionnaires' disease (modified) was used to make a clinical syndromic diagnosis in this case 25 ( Table I) . The differential diagnostic features of H1N1 pneumonia and Legionnaires' disease are listed in Table II . In this case, the differential diagnosis was more difficult because the presence of relative bradycardia could not be assessed while the patient was in atrial fibrillation. The patient did manifest hypophosphatemia, and had highly elevated ferritin levels that favored a diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease. 20, 25 Elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT) may occur with H1N1 pneumonia and Legionnaires' disease and therefore were diagnostically unhelpful. 4, 15 The clue to the diagnosis of this patient was the CXR showing a segmental/lobar left lower-lobe infiltrate (Fig 8) . This CXR finding, together with key laboratory markers for Legionnaires' disease, prompted specific testing for Legionnaires' disease. His Legionella sp. titers were negative. Later in his admission, his urinary antigen was positive for Legionella pneumophila (serogroups 01-06). 26, 27 After initial therapy with azithromycin for Legionnaires' disease, therapy was completed with doxycycline. [28] [29] [30] He made a full recovery.\n\nThe take-home lesson for clinicians from this case is that in the midst of the H1N1 epidemic, other infectious disorders may mimick, eg, Legionnaires' disease. Moreover, because the swine flu H1N1 pandemic occurred in spring and early summer, Legionnaires' disease was not initially suspected, since the peak incidence of Legionnaires' disease usually occurs in late summer and early fall. 31 "}
