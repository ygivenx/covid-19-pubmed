{"title": "Advances of Bioinformatics Tools Applied in Virus Epitopes Prediction *", "body": "However, there are no perfect algorithms, every tools has its strengths and weaknesses. In general, in practice several tools should be combined for epitopes prediction.\n\nGiven the different properties of the epitopes, prediction tools are generally MHC\u2160 or MHC\u2161 specific, although some software predicts both. The first prediction tools were motif-based algorithms, which predicted T cell epitopes by searching experimentally verified MHC binding motif sequences identified from affinity data. Several tools come under this classification, such as SYFPEITHI [17] , ProPred [20] .\n\nNevertheless, one of the drawbacks of these motifbased methods is that novel motifs are not recognized and so large numbers of false positive and false negatives can be generated. More recently, more sophisticated methods using, various machine learning based algorithms have been developed based on support vector machines (SVM) [6, 7] , hidden Markov models (HMM) [16] and artificial neural networks (ANN) [3] Compared with motif-based algorithm, these machine learning algorithms are more accurate and efficient, especially when they were used in complicated pattern recognition. SVM and ANN based algorithms work by using a positive set of experimentally verified epitope sequences and a second set of negative sequences to train the system to classify query sequences as belonging to one of these two classes. These is achieved by defining a set of N descriptive features for these sequences (such as nucleotide or dinucleotide sequence composition) then training the system against these positive and negative datasets. 4) Epitopes prediction. This is summarized in Fig. 1 .\n\nCompared to T cell epitopes prediction algorithms, the B cell epitope prediction is more complicated, especially for the conformational B cell epitopes because, in addition to the sequence composition, the 3D-structure of protein must also be considered.\n\nThe development of B cell epitopes prediction algorithms has been less successful compared to T cell epitope prediction, especially in accuracy. There are several reasons for this. For instance, the majority of B cell epitopes are discontinuous so that it is hard to determine the relevant amino acids and the distribution of the antigen surface. Moreover, much of the experimental data which the prediction algorithms are based on are still controversial because of the poorly understood recognition properties of crossreactive antibodies [1, 4] . Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties, there are several methods available for B cell epitope prediction for both linear and conformational epitopes. The prediction algorithms for linear the accuracy of primary sequence-based algorithms is low [11] , and modified algorithms based on machine learning were subsequently developed, such as ABCpred [18] and BepiPred [14] with significant improvements in accuracy. Prediction algorithms for conformational B cell epitopes based on 3D structure are also available owing to the ever-increasing 3D structure of antigen-antibody complex data. Some online prediction servers based on this algorithm are accessible, for example DiscoTope [9] and CEP (http:// bioinfo.ernet.in/cep.htm) [13] . These methods make use When tested experimentally, some of these epitopes were able to stimulate a strong immune response, and vaccination with hMPV CTL epitopes could protect the hMPV-challenged mice. These results demonstrated the efficacy of an hMPV CTL epitope vaccine in the control of hMPV infection in mice for the first time [10] . The MHC\u2160 T cell epitopes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) glycoproteins4 (GP4), 5 (GP5) and nucleocapsid were also predicted by SYFPEITHY and IEDB analysis while the MHC\u2161epitopes were predicted by ProPred.\n\nThese prediction were subsequently applied in in vitro and in vivo experiments and the results showed that some of these epitopes could provoke an immune response in pigs against PRRSV [5] . More recently, six HLA-A2 restricted CTL candidate epitopes of LMP2A (latent membrane protein 2A) of EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) were predicted by a combination of the SYFPEITHI, NetMHC and MHCPred [8] packages and three of six peptides were identified as LMP2A-specific CD8 + T-cell epitopes with functional experiments in vitro. It suggests that these three epitopes are good candidates for developing of a vaccine against EBV-correlative nasopharyngeal carcinoma [21] . Finally, eight candidate HLA-A*0201- [15] . In addition to these examples, many other important virus epitopes have been predicted and verified, such as HIV [12, 19] , Influenza A virus [2] and Foot-and-mouth disease virus [22] .\n\nMany in silico epitope prediction tools are available, which can complement experimental methods for epitope identification. Since these methods are performed in silico, they can be used as an initial screening step to identify targets of interest for more detailed experimental studies. Such an approach is more efficient in terms of time and cost. However, when using such an approach, it is important to recognize the limitations of current software tools; it is impossible to develop an exact algorithm, owing to the incomplete knowledge about the immune response and these methods are an approximation at best.\n\nMoreover, the prediction results produced by different tools may have distinct differences and multiple tools should be used to obtain a consensus result. Also the present tools need to be modified based on the increasing experimental data. Clearly, the challenge to develop novel, more systematic and accurate algorithms remains. However, the availability of ever-increasing amounts of virus genomic and proteomic information, coupled with advances in the development of new algorithms for sequence analysis will result in more effective and accurate tools for epitope prediction."}
