{"title": "RIBOSOMAL FRAMESHIFTING IN RESPONSE TO HYPOMODIFIED tRNAs IN XENOPUS OOCYTES", "body": "Many mammalian retroviruses use ribosomal frameshifting to extend their reading frames beyond gag and into pro-pol or pol by shifting the reading frame in the \u22121 direction [reviewed in [1] [2] [3] ]. The frameshift signal is a heptanucleotide sequence, X XXX YYZ. Unique features of the YYZ codon at the frameshift site is that only certain codons, e.g., UUU or AAC, occur at this position [ 4 ] . and, when UUU is changed to UUC or AAC is changed to AAU, the level of frameshifting is reduced substantially demonstrating that only one of two synonymous codons effectively promotes this event. These observations led Jacks and Varmus to propose the existence of shifty tRNAs that enhance frameshifting [ 4 ] . The phenomenon of preferential synonymous codon translation is unexpected since the same tRNA must decode one of its codewords far better than the other.\n\nThe paradox of how synonymous codons are preferentially translated led to the proposal that base modifications in tRNA might account for the shiftiness of different isoforms [ 5 ] . The fact that base modifications in tRNAs have a dramatic effect on their coding properties [ [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] also suggested that these bases play a role in frameshifting in mammalian retroviruses.\n\nThe first direct evidence that hypomodified tRNAs enhance frameshifting in mammalian cells reported that Phe tRNA lacking the highly modified Wye base at position 37 (tRNA Phe \u2212Y ) stimulated the frameshift event [ 11, 12 ] . Recently, Waas et al. [ 13 ] reported a stepwise decrease in frameshifting in yeast as the synthesis of Wye base became more abundant. The level of slippage observed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and yeast cells in the presence of tRNA Phe \u2212Y , or for that matter, in the presence of tRNA Phe +Y , exceeded that observed naturally with mammalian retroviruses raising concerns whether hypomodified tRNA Phe only enhanced ribosomal frameshifting or was actually required for the event to occur.\n\nProkaryotic systems were also developed for assessing the role of hypmodified tRNAs in ribosomal frameshifting which showed that base modification had little effect [e.g., see [14] [15] [16] ]. Although it was speculated from these studies that hypomodified tRNAs were not involved in frameshifting in mammalian systems, it was subsequently recognized that bacterial events were different from those of higher eukaryotes and direct comparisons for assessing the role of hypomodified tRNAs were likely not valid [ 17 ] .\n\nA major limitation in assessing the shiftiness of hypomodified tRNAs in mammalian retroviral ribosomal frameshifting as an essential or only enhancing constituent has been identifying an appropriate in vivo protein synthesis system wherein 1) the endogenous tRNA population contains low amounts of the suspected shifty tRNA in order that supplementation can sufficiently enrich the population to test its shiftiness, and 2) the level of frameshifting without supplemented tRNA is lower than observed in the natural retroviral frameshift event so that addition of the appropriate shifty isoform enhances the phenomenon. Herein, Xenopus oocytes were found to meet these criteria providing evidence that tRNA Phe \u2212Y is essential in frameshifting. The data also suggest that tRNA Asn +Q or tRNA Asn \u2212Q are used indiscriminately in frameshifting as was reported previously [ 18, 19 ]. The results of these studies are described herein.\n\n[ 35 S]-Met (Spec. Act. >1000 Ci/mmol), [ 3 H]-Phe (Spec. Act. 123Ci/mmol) and [ 14 C]-Phe (Spec. Act. 489mCi/mmol) were purchased from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ), and [ 14 C]-Asn (Spec. Act. 195mCi/mmol) from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Xenopus laevis females were obtained from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein synthesis systems and Ribomax large scale transcription kits were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), QIAfilter kit from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) and DH5\u03b1-competent cells from GIBCO (Grand Island, NY). Immobilized glutathione columns and reduced glutathione were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Freon (1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane) and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail were purchased from Sigma. NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer and NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels were purchased from Invitrogen.\n\nBoth wild type and mutant GST-encoding constructs used to assess ribosomal frameshifting have been described in detail elsewhere [ 11, 12 ] . These GST constructs were amplified in E. coli DH5\u03b1-competent cells, extracted and purified using a QIAfilter kit [ 12 ] . The purified constructs were digested with EcoR1 and mRNA generated [ 11 ] using a Ribomax large scale transcription kit as recommended by the vendor.\n\nTotal tRNA was isolated from freshly harvested Xenopus oocytes [ 20, 21 ] , calf liver [ 22 ] , Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe [ 11, 18 ] , aminoacylated with labeled phenylalanine or asparagine [ 22 ] and the resulting labeled aminoacyl-tRNAs chromatographed [ 22 ] on a RPC-5 column [ 23 ] . S. pombe tRNA Asn containing Q base (designated tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) ) and lacking Q base (designated tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) ) and S. cerevisiae tRNA Asn lacking Q base (designated tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sc) ) were purified [ 11, 18 ] and rabbit reticulocyte tRNA Phe containing Wye base (designated tRNA Phe +Y ) and mouse neuroblastoma tRNA Phe lacking Wye base (designated tRNA Phe \u2212Y ) were isolated and purified as given [ 12 ] .\n\n40 nl of a mixture containing 0.12 pmol of purified tRNA, and 60 ng of mRNA were injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes and the oocytes incubated in OR-2 buffer (82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 \u00b5Ci/\u00b5l of [ 35 S]-Met) at 22\u00b0C for 16 hr. mRNA was prepared as given [ 11, 12, 18 ]. 30 oocytes were homogenized in 240 \u00b5l of protein extraction buffer [ice cold 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM AEBSF, protease inhibitor cocktail]. 240 \u00b5l of Freon was then added (1,1,2trichlorotrifluoroethane), the samples vortexed, and the upper aqueous phase was separated from the lower freon phase by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Total protein extracts were electrophoresed on 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels. Protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was carried out and the resulting protein samples electrophoresed as given previously [ 12, 18 ] . GST-tagged proteins were isolated using an immobilized glutathione column and eluted with reduced glutathione according to the manufacturers instructions, electrophoresed on 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels. All developed gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen.\n\nXenopus oocytes Asn and Phe tRNA populations were examined to access the relative amounts of fully modified and hypomodified isoforms. Total tRNA isolated from Xenopus oocytes was aminoacylated with [ 3 H]-Phe or [ 14 C]-Asn and the resulting labeled tRNAs fractionated on a RPC-5 column. [ 3 H]-Phe-tRNA Phe from oocytes was cochromatographed with [ 14 C]-Phe-tRNA Phe from calf liver. The tRNA Phe population of calf liver exists primarily as a single, fully modified isoform that contains Wye base [ 22 , see also Fig. 1A ]. Phe-tRNA Phe from oocytes fractionated into two major isoforms that contain Wye base and an earlier eluting, hypomodified isoform. The last eluting major isoform from oocytes likely represents an additional modification of the Wye base-containing species. Asn-tRNA Asn was resolved into a major, fully modified isoform and a minor, later-eluting hypomodified isoform as shown (Fig. 1B) . Since both of these tRNA populations in oocytes represent about 85% of the Wye and Q base containing isoforms, it would appear that oocytes are an ideal system to test the ability of the hypomodified isoforms to support ribosomal frameshifting, at least with respect to the endogenous tRNA population.\n\nThe S. cerevisiae tRNA Asn population contains only tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sc) , which enhances frameshifting [ 11, 18 ] , while the S. pombe tRNA Asn population contains both isoforms with and without Q base, i.e., tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) and tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) , respectively. All three isoforms were therefore purified from the respective organisms as described in the Materials and Methods. The primary structures of the two yeast asparagine tRNAs, along with that of mouse asparagine tRNA, are compared in Fig. 2 . The anticodon stems and loops are shown in larger letters. Although any variations in the effects on ribosomal frameshifting between the three isoforms may be due to a change or changes anywhere in the three molecules, we focused on the anticodon stem and loops. All three isoforms have identical anticodon loops, but vary in their stems. The two yeast isoforms differ from each other in the first two and last two bases in their anticodon stems, while S. cerevisiae and mouse tRNAs Asn manifest differences between each other in the second, third and fourth (and the corresponding complementary) bases in their stems. S. pombe and mouse have differences in the first, second, third and fifth (and the corresponding complementary) bases in their stems. Each difference is highlighted as indicated in Fig. 2 .\n\nTo assess whether Xenopus oocytes may serve as a model system to resolve the question of whether tRNA Phe \u2212Y is required for frameshifting or only enhances this event in mammalian retroviruses utilizing XXXUUUU at the frameshift site, oocytes were incubated with [ 35 S]-Met following injection with GST-AAAUUUU mRNA and with or without tRNA Phe +Y or tRNA Phe \u2212Y (Fig. 3) . Control oocytes that were microinjected with only mRNA contained a highly expressed GST band at ~25 kDa and a second, poorly expressed GST-MMTV gagpro band at ~37 kDa (Fig. 3A , lane 2) that was not present in non-injected oocytes (compare lanes 1 and 2). Oocytes also microinjected with tRNA Phe \u2212Y contained a more intense GST-MMTV gag-pro band relative to the GST band than found in control oocytes (compare lanes 2 and 3), while oocytes microinjected with tRNA Phe +Y appeared to have a less intense GST-MMTV gag-pro band relative to that observed in the control system or in oocytes also containing tRNA Phe \u2212Y (compare lanes 2-4). Purification of each of these GST-tagged proteins and their electrophoresis on gels (Fig. 3B ) confirmed the observations found in total protein extracts (Fig. 3A) . The level of frameshifting increased from about 4% in control oocytes to greater than 10% in oocytes containing tRNA Phe \u2212Y (lanes 1 and 2, respectively), while the level of frameshifting was reduced in oocytes that contained tRNA Phe +Y to less than 3% compared to the 4% observed in controls (lanes 1 and 3, respectively).\n\nOocytes microinjected with GST-AAAUUUC mRNA with or without tRNA Phe \u2212Y or tRNA Phe +Y yielded no detectable GST-MMTV gag-pro product (data not shown).\n\nTo assess whether Xenopus oocytes may serve as a model for examining and/or mimicking ribosomal frameshifting in mammalian retroviruses utilizing XXXAAAC at the frameshift site, oocytes were incubated with [ 35 S]-methionine following injection with GST-AAAAAAC and with or without tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) , tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) or tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sc) (Fig. 4A and B) . All oocytes containing mRNA with or without tRNA Asn had a highly expressed GST band and a less, but similarly expressed, GST-MMTV gag-pro band (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-5) . Purification of the GST-tagged proteins and their electrophoresis showed that indeed the level of frameshifting was similar whether oocytes contained tRNA Asn with or without Q base or no supplemental tRNA. Interestingly, tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sc) appeared to stimulate frameshifting slightly (compare lane 4 to lanes 1-3 in Fig. 4B ). No detectable frameshifting occurred in oocytes microinjected with GST-AAAAAAU mRNA with or without tRNA Asn (data not shown).\n\nTo further assess the ability of tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) and tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) to support ribosomal frameshifting, we examined the ability of these two isoforms to enhance frameshifting in rabbit reticulocyte lysates which is a loosely programmed system for carrying out protein synthesis [ 11, 12, 18, 24, 25 ]. The level of frameshifting with the wild type AAC codon at the frameshift site was enhanced only slightly by supplementing the lysate system with either tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) or tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, programming rabbit reticulocyte lysates with GST-AAAAAAU reduced the level of frameshifting dramatically [ 1-3 ], but supplementing this protein synthesis system with either tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) or tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) stimulated frameshifting about threefold (Fig. 4D) . These data further suggest that frameshifting of XXXAAAC signals, or for that matter XXXAAAU signals, can utilize tRNA Asn +Q or tRNA Asn \u2212Q indiscriminately to promote the frameshift event and that Q base modification status does not play a role in decoding one synonymous Asn codon better than the other.\n\nThe present study employing Xenopus oocytes as an \"in vivo\" system to examine ribosomal frameshifting was prompted in part because of the high levels of frameshifting observed in cell free extracts and yeast cells which often exceeded that present in retroviruses within host cells [e.g., see 12, 25 and references therein]. The levels of frameshifting found in Xenopus oocytes following microinjection of a construct encoding a retroviral frameshift signal with either UUU or AAC at the frameshift site was between about 4 and 10.5%. These levels are lower than, but more closely approximate, that observed in retroviruses in infected cells. This observation, coupled with the finding of low levels of potential shifty (hypomodified) isoforms within the endogenous tRNA population, suggest that Xenopus oocytes indeed serve as an excellent model system for elucidating mechanisms of retroviral frameshifting. The high levels of frameshifting observed in widely used rabbit reticulocyte lysates and yeast cells, even in the absence of exogenous tRNAs, make it difficult to assess, for example, whether hypomodified tRNA Phe is required for frameshifting to occur or the hypomodified form merely stimulates the frameshift event wherein the shift in reading frames can still occur in the presence of fully modified tRNA Phe , albeit not as efficiently. In fact, the use of Xenopus oocytes as a model system to elucidate the mechanism of frameshifting involving slippery tRNAs appears to have answered the question of whether tRNA Phe is required or merely enhances the frameshift event. The low level of frameshifting observed in oocytes microinjected with only GST-AAAUUUU (i.e., in the absence of supplemental tRNA) is enhanced more than twofold by enriching the endogenous tRNA Phe \u2212Y population (Fig. 3) further demonstrating that this isoform is a slippery tRNA. Furthermore, the fact that microinjection of tRNA Phe +Y which enriched the endogenous tRNA Phe population with the fully modified isoform reduced the level of frameshifting from about 4% in oocytes containing only GST-AAAUUUU mRNA to less than 3% demonstrates that the fully modified isoform inhibits the frameshift event [see also 12 ]. Thus, the approximately 4% level of frameshifting observed in the presence of only GST-AAAUUUU is apparently due to the small amount of tRNA Phe \u2212Y present intracellularly (Fig.  1A) . We therefore propose that tRNA Phe \u2212Y is the slippery tRNA, while the frameshifting event is inhibited in the presence of tRNA Phe +Y , and the hypomodified isoform is essential for the frameshift to take place.\n\nThe question of the requirement of hypomodified tRNAs in promoting ribosomal frameshifting has been of considerable interest as their restriction may provide an alternative avenue for inhibiting retroviral expression [ 2, 11, 26 ]. In the case of tRNA Asn , wherein Q base is obtained from the diet in mammals, and in the event Q base restricted the frameshift event, a diet rich in this base should theoretically reduce the endogenous population of tRNA Asn \u2212Q . Unfortunately, reducing the level of endogenous tRNA Asn \u2212Q does not appear to offer a means of restricting retroviral ribosomal frameshifting since either tRNA Asn isoform seems to be used indiscriminately at the frameshift site [ 18, 19 ] . However, it would be of interest to incubate oocytes in the presence of Q base to initially assess whether the endogenous tRNA Asn \u2212Q population (see Fig. 1B ) could be reduced prior to injecting oocytes with GST-AAAAAAC mRNA. In the event the endogenous tRNA Asn \u2212Q population can be reduced, then the level of frameshifting can be further assessed which should unequivocally determine whether Q base is involved in reducing ribosomal frameshifting. As long as there is any endogenous level of tRNA Asn \u2212Q (see Fig. 1B ), then the question of an involvement of this isoform in frameshifting cannot be completely resolved [ 18 ] . Interestingly, the reason that the occurrence of AAU at the frameshift site is inhibitory [e.g., see [1] [2] [3] [4] 24, 27 ) cannot be due to tRNA Asn modification as both isoforms also translate this codon indiscriminately [ 18 , and see Fig. 4D ].\n\nFurthermore, we have shown that tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sc) enhances frameshifting [ 11 ] and that the base or bases responsible for the increase in frameshifting is not in the anticodon loop, but reside (s) elsewhere in the tRNA [ 18 ] . Xenopus oocytes provide a model system for assessing the location of the base(s) responsible for this enhancement by cloning the corresponding tRNA Asn gene from yeast and generating the appropriate mutations in the tRNA. Injection of the resulting mutant tRNAs into oocytes should determine which base(s) is (are) involved in promoting frameshifting shedding more light on the mechanism of this process. "}
