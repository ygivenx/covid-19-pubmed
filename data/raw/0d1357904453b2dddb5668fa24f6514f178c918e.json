Anti-DDX1 antibody was used for staining of the 28 endogenous DDX1 and anti-Flag antibody was used for staining of the exogenous 29 flag-DDX1 (green). The phospho-N at S197 was stained with anti-pS197-N Ab (red), 30 and the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). DDX1 in the nuclei (as marked 31 by white arrowheads) diminished by JHMV infection, indicating a possibility for its 32 redistribution to the cytosol and co-localized with pS197-N. \n\nThe wild-type JHMV N was cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) at the EcoRI and 80\n\nKpnI sites. The Myc/DDK tagged mouse DDX1 construct was purchased from 81\n\nOrigene Fisher Scientific). Protein searches were performed against SwissProt database by 182 using Proteome Discoverer Version 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following 183 criteria were used to select protein candidates for further analysis: background 184 deduction (samples with kenpaullone treatment were set as background), rank = 1, at 185 least two unique peptides, with a high confidence (1% false discovery rate) and score. 186\n\nThe RNA ChIP technique is applied to detect the association of individual proteins 189 with specific JHMV RNA sequences in vivo as described previously with some 190 modifications (Niranjanakumari et al., 2002) . In brief, 1x10 7 infected cells (MOI = 1, 191 6 h p.i.) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and the reaction was quenched 192 by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM followed by incubation 193 for 5 min. The crosslinked cell resuspended in 1mL RIPA buffer containing protease 194 inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitor, and RNaseOUT 50 U/ml (Invitrogen) were sheared 195 by sonication to solubilize RNPs. Antibodies (5 \u03bcg/mL) were added to each IP tube 196 containing 100 \u03bcl lysates at room temperature for 3 h and incubated for 1 h after 197 adding protein G-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Antibodies are as follows: N, 198 DDX1, and control IgG. The beads were then washed successively by the following 199 solution: 1 mL lysis buffer, 1 mL low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM 200 EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl / pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl), 1 mL high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 201 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl / pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl,), 1 mL 202"}
