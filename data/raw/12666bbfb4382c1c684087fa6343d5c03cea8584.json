{"title": "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct inflammation-induced microglia signatures Editor: Achim Breiling Transaction Report", "body": "1. It is not clear why the authors have chosen the regimen of one LPS injection instead of several injections which leads to neurodegeneration as described e.g. by Bodea et al. (2014) . The relevance of the study for neurodegenerative diseases -if there is any -should be increased by adding the following points: a. Analyse LPS-injected mice once the acute stimulus has resided to evaluate whether microglia stay \"primed\" or whether they return to their homeostatic state. b. Repeat the LPS injection to see whether the acclaimed neurodegenerative microglia signature (Bodea et al., 2014) can be triggered and associate this gene signature to the acutely treated mice. c. Comparing transcriptome signatures in two distinct genotypes, one being a model of Alzheimer's disease (in the case of DAM) could lead to a bias. The differences which the authors describe could simply reflect the distinct microglia properties inherent to the respective model. To be able to effectively compare the two populations it would be necessary to re-run the RNASeq analysis comparing the effects of LPS injection on microglia phenotypes with states of microglia in the Alzheimer model in the same laboratory with the same platform.\n\n2. Fig. 2 : The in vitro LPS-stimulation should be done on cultured adult microglia since it represents the findings of in vivo LPS-exposed microglia of mice aged 3-4 months more closely.\n\n3. Figs 4 +5: The genes derived from the single-cell analysis should be validated further.\n\na. An untreated group should be included (i.e. non-saline or -LPS injected) b. Validation on RNA expression (e.g. qPCR, in situ hybridisation) or protein level (e.g. Western blot, histology) should be undertaken, especially of the genes mentioned in the discussion (SOCS3, STAT3, Mef2c, TREM2, TYROBP) c. The relevance of the identified genes should be discussed in more detail when comparing the three microglia subsets to each other and to the DAM-specific signature. What are the functional implications? Is the LPS-response of microglia harmful or beneficial towards tissue homeostasis and repair? d. Do the microglia of the \"LPS-subset\" share common markers that can be used to selectively isolate and analyse this specific population? It would give the study strength if the authors could confirm the activated cells of \"subset LPS\" in the CNS in vivo using the up and downregulated genes.\n\n4. There is mounting evidence that microglia show gender-specific differences especially to inflammatory reactions. The authors should use either male or female mice for their experiments or carefully dissect their existing data to exclude a gender bias. It does not become clear how many and which mice (male/female) were used for each experiment.\n\nMinor points:\n\n1. The authors do not mention how many repetitions of their experiment they have done. It should be ensured and clearly stated that n=3 biological replicates were included.\n\n2. Fig. 1 : a. More neuronal marker genes should be tested. One gene is clearly not sufficient. b. Figs. 1C and 1D: Why didn't the authors test the isolated populations towards the presence of monocytes or other myeloid cells? The absence of these cells needs to be shown.\n\n3. Fig. 2 : a. The authors should show the gene expression of more inflammatory genes, especially upon LPS treatment in vitro. Here, the focus lies too much on homeostatic genes. b. Figs. 2B, 2C and 2D: Isolated monocytes and macrophages should be included as a control. c. Fig. 2E : The relevance of the putative regulation by TGF\u03b2 for the following parts of the manuscript is unclear. d. In vitro experiments could also be used to validate findings from the sequencing experiments (see above) 4. Fig. S2 : The inclusion of these data, serving as a putative control of TGF\u03b2 as a regulator of the homeostatic function of these cells is relevant information. Yet, the text explains only a fragment of the shown treatments. Why are the treatments included in the study? 5. Fig. 3 : a. How many mice were used for the isolation of microglia and respective subsequent single cell RNASeq? The authors need to mention it in the legend b. The labelling of the heatmap is too small. Showing it without the gene symbols is sufficient. c. The volcano plot is not necessary. d. Descriptions of the -in part very general -results of the gene set enrichment are confusing. 6 .

The whole paragraph in the text can be shortened. profiles between acute inflammatory microglia and Alzheimer's disease-associated microglia on a single cell level. The article presents a useful resource for identifying microglia-specific genes in inflammation. However, many of the described results, such as the downregulation of microglia-specific homeostatic genes during inflammation, have been described previously. In order to increase the significance of this work, the authors should extend their analysis and add additional experiments.\n\nMajor comments:\n\nWhile the article provides an in-depth description of gene expression, it would be useful to add a further level of analysis of protein expression. The authors could include flow cytometry analysis of the expression of several of the homeostatic microglia signature surface markers that they point out to be differentially expressed between steady state microglia and LPS-induced microglia.\n\nThey identify two populations of microglia after LPS-induced systemic inflammation based on gene expression (termed 'Main LPS' and 'Subset LPS'). The authors however provide only a global comparison between the two populations. Therefore, a more specific description of the top genes that distinguish the two populations would be useful. Moreover, the authors could use other methods to confirm this heterogeneity, such as FACS based on differentially expressed surface markers, and immunohistochemistry to define the location of the 'subset' population. What is the difference of this 'subset' population in terms of function, proliferation and cytokine expression in comparison to the 'main' LPS population and na\u00efve microglia? Can this population be analyzed longitudinally? When does it appear? How long does it persist?\n\nIn the discussion the authors suggest that changes in SOCS3-STAT3 signalling may control downregulation of microglia homeostatic genes. Can the authors include experiments to show whether phosphorylation of Stat3 in microglia is indeed different between steady state and inflammatory microglia?\n\nIn Figure 2 D the authors try to show that there is no monocyte contamination of their sorted microglia population by performing qPCR for Ly6c and Ccr2. The way it is presented does not provide information on the expression levels of these two genes in relation to the positive cell subset (monocytes). A positive control should therefore be included.\n\nMinor comments: Some of the figures contain inaccuracies in the labeling. For example Figure 3C log10FDR should be -log10FDR. Moreover, labeling of differentially expressed pathways in all figures often does not contain the full name of the pathway shown. The authors argue that microglial subpopulations exist that show differential responses to acute inflammation. By selecting population-specific cell surface markers, they were able to effectively isolate only brain-resident microglia, based on Cd11b+/Cd45int expression, as opposed to other intrinsic or peripheral cells (Fig. 1) . The authors show that upon an acute LPS injection or upon in vitro LPS stimulation, microglia lose their homeostatic and phagocytosing gene expression profile, whilst pro-inflammatory genes are upregulated (Fig. 2) . This data was confirmed using a single-cell sequencing approach, showing that microglia exposed to LPS show a distinct reactive phenotype compared to saline-injected control mice (Fig. 3) . By analysing the sequencing data more closely, the group could identify a specific microglia sub-population (\"subset LPS\") that showed an intermediate phenotype compared to control and reactive microglia (Fig. 4) . They postulate based on differential gene analysis that these cells might either be damaged cells, recovering from their activation status or a cell population with specific DNA repair properties. Lastly, in Fig. 5 the authors compared the gene signatures of LPS-exposed microglia to that of \"disease-associated microglia\" (DAM) that has been described by Keren-Shaul et al. (2017) We acknowledge the reviewer for his comments and criticisms regarding the relevance of the study for neurodegenerative diseases. Taking them into account, we strengthen the results regarding the acute inflammatory model and put less emphasis on the comparison with neurodegenerative conditions. Specifically: -we amended the title: \"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct inflammatory and neurodegenerative microglia signatures\" now reads \"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct microglia signatures under inflammation\" -we shortened the text describing the comparison with DAM as recommended below (minor point 7c \"The text describing Fig. 5 should be more to the point and less descriptive\") -we placed the results regarding the comparison with DAM in supplementary data (in the revised version, Fig. 5 has been moved to Fig. EV3 ) -we built up the analysis of our acute inflammatory model performing additional experiments and adding further results taking into consideration the suggestions from both reviewers. As a side note regarding the reviewer's statement \"The differences which the authors describe could simply reflect the distinct microglia properties inherent to the respective model\", we would like to point out that several relevant studies are conducted by comparing data obtained on different mouse strain backgrounds showing comparable results. Similar observations are also applicable to the reviewer's assertion \"To be able to effectively compare the two populations it would be necessary to re-run the RNASeq analysis comparing the effects of LPS injection on microglia phenotypes with states of microglia in the Alzheimer model in the same laboratory with the same platform\". For these aspects, please refer, for example, to the following article: Holtman et al (2015) Induction of a common microglia gene expression signature by aging and neurodegenerative conditions: a coexpression meta-analysis. Acta Neuropathol Commun. Fig. 2 : The in vitro LPS-stimulation should be done on cultured adult microglia since it represents the findings of in vivo LPS-exposed microglia of mice aged 3-4 months more closely.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer, therefore we also conducted LPS treatment on cultured adult microglia of mice aged 3-4 months (2 mice -one female and one male -per replicate). Similarly to the in vivo and in vitro results obtained with newborn mice, the expression levels of the homeostatic genes (e.g. Tmem119 and Gpr34) were decreased, while those of the pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. Il1b and Tnf) were up-regulated by cultured adult microglia treated with LPS compared to untreated cells. We added the qPCR results obtained from cultured adult microglia in Fig. 2E . We amended the text in the Results as well as in the Materials and Methods sections and the figure legend accordingly.\n\nThe genes derived from the single-cell analysis should be validated further.\n\na. An untreated group should be included (i.e. non-saline or -LPS injected)\n\nTo study the effect of a single-dose peripheral injection of LPS dissolved in PBS, we considered our saline (PBS) group as our vehicle control. Differently from an intracranial injection of LPS where a non-injected control would be essential to discern between the effects of the injury from the LPS, we believe that the effect on the CNS of a single intraperitoneal puncture would be minimal or absent.\n\nb. Validation on RNA expression (e.g. qPCR, in situ hybridisation) or protein level (e.g. Western blot, histology) should be undertaken, especially of the genes mentioned in the discussion (SOCS3, STAT3, Mef2c, TREM2, TYROBP)\n\nGene expression levels of Trem2 and Tyrobp were already shown in Fig. 2A at the bulk level and confirmed at single-cell resolution. As suggested, we added Mef2c to Fig. 2A . Thus, we displayed the decrease of the expression levels of Mef2c, Trem2 and Tyrobp by microglia isolated from LPSinjected mice compared to saline-injected mice. As recommended in minor point 3d \"In vitro experiments could also be used to validate findings from the sequencing experiments\", we took advantage of primary cells to analyse Socs3 at gene expression level by qPCR and investigate STAT3 phosphorylation levels by Western blot. Microglial cells treated with LPS showed increased amounts of STAT3 phosphorylation along with up-regulation of Socs3 expression levels compared to untreated cells (Appendix Fig. S1 ).\n\nc. The relevance of the identified genes should be discussed in more detail when comparing the three microglia subsets to each other and to the DAM-specific signature. What are the functional implications? Is the LPS-response of microglia harmful or beneficial towards tissue homeostasis and repair?\n\nWe welcome the suggestion from the reviewer, therefore in the revised version we provided a more detailed comparison of the two inflammatory subsets compared to steady state as well as to the DAM-specific signature both in the results and in the discussion sections. Notably, for example, we identified mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (Manf), a factor which promotes neuroprotection and tissue repair, to be exclusively upregulated in the \"main LPS\" and not in the DAM, thus highlighting a potential beneficial phenotype of this microglial population.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that this information would strengthen the study. Accordingly to the reviewer's suggestion, we further characterized selected genes identified at single-cell resolution. To achieve this, we applied flow cytometry to analyse the expression levels of markers up-regulated in both LPS groups (e.g. CD44), only in \"main LPS\" (e.g. CD14 and CD274) or only in \"subset LPS (e.g. NOTCH4) (please see the figure below). Although 3-4 markers used simultaneously did not allowed to clearly discriminate the \"subset LPS\" from the \"main LPS\" population, changes in the proportion of marker positive cells are in line with the scRNAseq data, as a smaller proportion of NOTCH4 positive cells was detected upon LPS treatment compared to CD14. We would like to receive the reviewer's advice whether these data should be included in the manuscript.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer's comment. For this reason, for all the in vivo and in vitro experiments included in the present manuscript, we performed the analyses using a mix of females and males. We apologize for having omitted this relevant information. To solve this issue, we added it in the corresponding figure legends.\n\nMinor points:\n\n1. The authors do not mention how many repetitions of their experiment they have done. It should be ensured and clearly stated that n=3 biological replicates were included.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out this aspect. We added this information in the corresponding figure legends. Fig. 1 : a. More neuronal marker genes should be tested. One gene is clearly not sufficient.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer's comment, therefore we added further neuronal marker genes. Specifically, in addition to Tubb3, we included gene expression results for Vglut1 and NeuN in Fig.  1B . We amended the text and the figure legend accordingly.\n\nAccordingly to the reviewer's suggestion, we further analysed the potential contamination of sorted CD11b + CD45 int microglia by monocytes (Ly6C+ and CCR2+ cells) or macrophages/dendritic cells (CD11c+ cells). As expected, CD11b + CD45 int cells did not contain neither Ly6C+ CCR2+ cells, nor CD11c+ cells (Fig. EV1) .\n\n3. Fig. 2 : a. The authors should show the gene expression of more inflammatory genes, especially upon LPS treatment in vitro. Here, the focus lies too much on homeostatic genes.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We added gene expression results regarding inflammatory genes upon LPS treatment in vivo and in vitro (adult and neonatal microglia), accordingly. Specifically, we added Il-1\u03b2 gene expression analysis obtained from in vivo LPSinjected mice compared to saline control (we added these results in Fig. 2A) . For adult and neonatal cultivated microglia in vitro, we maintained Tmem119 and Gpr34 as representative homeostatic genes and we added Il-1\u03b2 and Tnf as inflammatory genes (these results are shown in Fig. 2E) .\n\nTo include the requested control, we used the Monocyte Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) that has been developed for the isolation of monocytes from suspensions of mouse bone marrow. Remarkably, FACS analyses revealed pure populations of Ly6C + cells after depletion of magnetically labelled non-target cells, i.e. T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, erythroid cells and granulocytes. We included the FACS results in Fig. EV2 and the corresponding qPCR data in Fig. 2D , which further support the validity of our FACS gating strategy and purity of FACS-sorted cells. We revised the text and the figure legends accordingly.\n\nc. Fig. 2E : The relevance of the putative regulation by TGF\u03b2 for the following parts of the manuscript is unclear.\n\nWe apologize for the unclear explanation regarding these experiments. Actually, the relevance of showing that the homeostatic gene markers are decreased in cultivated microglia under LPS exposure was to strength our in vivo results. Showing that the decrease of Tmem119, Gpr34, etc. is observed in pure populations of cultivated microglia with no contamination by other immune cells which do not express these markers (e.g. resident macrophages and peripheral immune cells) is a robust evidence that the down-regulation of the homeostatic signature under inflammatory conditions is an intrinsic property of microglia. The text reads as follows: \"In order to further assess that the decrease of the homeostatic signature under inflammatory conditions is not due to the presence of other immune cell types, but it is an intrinsic property of microglial cells, we also analysed the effect of LPS on cultivated microglia from neonatal and adult mice\". Notably, the decrease of the homeostatic gene markers is among the most prominent effect also at the single-cell resolution.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this precious suggestion. We validated several genes identified in the sequencing experiments in both adult and neonatal cultivated microglia (e.g. Ccl2 and P2ry12) (Appendix Fig. S3 ).\n\nAccordingly to the reviewer's comment, as the whole information provided in Fig. S2 on different treatments of neonatal cultivated microglia resulted dispersive and redundant, we omitted Fig. S2 and included the relevant information regarding TGF\u03b2 as a regulator of the homeostatic function in the former Fig. S3 , in the revised version Fig. EV2 . In this figure, we also included the corresponding information obtained in cultivated adult microglia. Consequently, the text and the figure legend have been amended. Fig. 3 : a. How many mice were used for the isolation of microglia and respective subsequent single cell RNASeq? The authors need to mention it in the legend.\n\nThe number of mice used for scRNA-seq was 2 per group (2 saline-and 2 LPS-injected mice; 1 female and 1 male per group). We added this information in the figure legend.\n\nThe gene symbols from the heatmap have been removed accordingly.\n\nc. The volcano plot is not necessary.\n\nWe removed the volcano plot from Fig. 3 accordingly. We moved it in Appendix Fig. S3 . We apologize for the unclear description of the gene set enrichment results. We revised the text to improve the understanding of these results accordingly.\n\n6. Fig. 4 : a. The authors should label the graphs with a heading to facilitate the understanding of the data shown (e.g. Fig. 4C : \"upregulated genes\").\n\nWe agree that this labelling would enable a better understanding of the graphs, thus we added \"upregulated genes\" and \"downregulated genes\" in Figs. 4B and 4C, respectively.\n\nb. The whole paragraph in the text can be shortened.\n\nFollowing the addition of further results and information, the whole paragraph related to Fig. 4 has been shortened (e.g. we removed some GO results) and entirely revised. Fig. 5 : a. A Venn diagram showing downregulated genes between LPS-exposed microglia and DAM should be included (similar to Fig. 5B ).\n\nAs suggested, we added a Venn diagram showing the corresponding downregulated genes and we included a title for both of them, i.e. upregulated genes and downregulated genes. We amended the text and the figure legend accordingly (in the new version Fig. EV3) .\n\nAs recommended for Figs. 4C and 4D, we added titles in Figs. 5G and 5H (in the new version Fig  EV3) .\n\nc. The text describing Fig. 5 should be more to the point and less descriptive.\n\nAs suggested, we reshaped the text to be more to the point and less descriptive.\n\nReferee #2:\n\nThe article presents a useful resource for identifying microglia-specific genes in inflammation. However, many of the described results, such as the downregulation of microglia-specific homeostatic genes during inflammation, have been described previously. In order to increase the significance of this work, the authors should extend their analysis and add additional experiments.\n\nWhile the article provides an in-depth description of gene expression, it would be useful to add a further level of analysis of protein expression. The authors could include flow cytometry analysis of the expression of several of the homeostatic microglia signature surface markers that they point out to be differentially expressed between steady state microglia and LPS-induced microglia.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this comment and we definitely agree that the analysis of the homeostatic microglia surface markers at the protein level would strengthen our results. Thus, as suggested, we performed flow cytometry analysis for TMEM119 and P2RY12 and compared their expression levels between steady state and LPS-induced microglia. In agreement with the transcriptional results, the protein levels of TMEM119 and P2RY12 were decreased under inflammatory conditions compared to steady state. We included these results in Fig. 3D . We amended the text and the figure legend accordingly. We agree with the reviewer, therefore we carefully addressed these comments point by point. (a) As suggested, we identified and highlighted the top genes that distinguish the two populations. To do this, we listed top differentially expressed genes unique to \"Main LPS\" or \"Subset LPS\" versus steady state (FDR<0.05; upregulated genes, Log2FC\u22653; downregulated genes, Log2FC\u2264-3). We included these results in Table 1 and discussed the potential interesting genes in the text referring to the existent literature. (b) Please see our answer given to Referee #1 comment (please refer to major point 3d). (c) As advised, to address the differences that discriminate the \"subset\" versus the \"main\" LPS subpopulations from the na\u00efve microglia in terms of function, proliferation and cytokine expression, we extracted these information from our scRNA-seq data and built a new table (Table EV5) . We added the corresponding information in the text. (d) Although we agree with the reviewer that it would be very interesting to study the dynamics of these subpopulations along the inflammatory and resolution phases, in the present study we focused on a specific time point in order to provide a first screening of microglia heterogeneity under acute inflammatory conditions. Follow-up studies, which would analyse these subpopulations at different time points, would certainly provide highly relevant information regarding further characterization of microglia heterogeneity along the acute inflammatory process. In order to respond to the reviewer's questions, in this study we conducted a pseudotime analysis. From this analysis, we found that, along the activation process, the inflammatory mediators are upregulated first and the homeostatic gene markers are downregulated subsequently. Thus, the identified subset may correspond to an intermediate state of activated microglia having their homeostatic signature less affected than the main LPS group, thus being temporally at an earlier stage of activation. We describe these results in a new results section entitled \"Pseudotime analysis of LPS-activated microglia uncovers \"subset LPS\" as an intermediate activated state\" and included the related figures in Fig. 5 .\n\nWe acknowledge the reviewer for this advice, which is in line with Referee #1 comment (please refer to major point 3b). We took advantage of primary cells to analyse Socs3 at gene expression level by qPCR and to investigate STAT3 phosphorylation levels by Western blot. Microglial cells treated with LPS showed increased amounts of STAT3 phosphorylation along with up-regulation of Socs3 expression levels compared to untreated cells (Appendix Fig. S1 ).\n\nWe are in agreement with the reviewer's remark, which is in line with Referee #1 comment (please refer to minor point 3b), therefore we performed additional experiments to include a positive control (i.e. bone marrow monocytes). Briefly, as mentioned above, we used the Monocyte Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) that has been developed for the isolation of monocytes from suspensions of mouse bone marrow. Remarkably, FACS analyses revealed pure populations of Ly6C + cells after depletion of magnetically labelled non-target cells, i.e. Fig. EV2 and the corresponding qPCR data in Fig. 2D , which further support the validity of our FACS gating strategy and purity of FACS-sorted cells. We revised the text and the figure legends accordingly. Figure 3C We thank the reviewer for highlighting these imprecisions. We corrected them accordingly. Please consider that the volcano plot in Fig. 3C is now shown in Appendix Fig. S3 . Thank you for the submission of your revised manuscript to our editorial offices. We have now received the reports from the referees that were asked to re-evaluate your study (you will find enclosed below).\n\nAs you will see, both referees now support the publication of your manuscript in EMBO reports. However, both have some further suggestions to improve the manuscript, and also some remaining concerns (referee #2), we ask you to address in a final revised version of your manuscript and/or a further point-by-point response.\n\nFurther, I have the following editorial requests:\n\n-I would suggest the following title: Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct inflammation-induced microglia signatures -Please provide the abstract written in present tense.\n\n-We would like to publish the paper as Scientific Report (as you indicated).

Please let me know if you have questions or comments regarding the revision.\n\nReferee #1:\n\nThe authors have addressed most of my comments.\n\nI think it would be nice if they could identify the location of the 'subset' population by immunohistochemistry. Are these subset microglia in a specific region or distributed evenly througout the brain? Can they use marker(s) upregulated in the subset population?\n\nMinor comment: The clinical relevance of the described LPS induced microglia subgroup in vivo to develop new treatment approaches for CNS diseases involving microglia-related neuroinflammation is not addressed in the study. Yet, the so far shown results by Sousa et al will pave the way for future studies that will relate the described dynamic of microglia inflammatory states to neurodegenerative conditions and are therefore a relevant basis to follow up.\n\nThe authors responded to most points raised in the review of their article submitted to EMBO Journal. However, we feel that the following points need to be addressed prior to publication in EMBO reports. 2. Determination of spatial distribution and brain region specific quantification of \"subset LPS\" in the CNS tissue in vivo by making use of the signature of up-and down-regulated genes as markers will add value to the study. The comparison of the spatial distribution of \"subset LPS\" between male and female mice would add further value.

This has been done.\n\nThis has been done.\n\nThe combination of FACS and single-cell RNA-sequencing to analyse microglia in the LPS mouse model of acute inflammation reveals two distinct states of activation: a main reactive population and an intermediate activated cellular subset. These results provide insights into microglia heterogeneity and establish a resource for the identification of specific phenotypes in neurological disorders with an immunological component.\n\n-two to three bullet points highlighting the key findings of your study !

Are these subset microglia in a specific region or distributed evenly throughout the brain? Can they use marker(s) upregulated in the subset population?\n\nWe agree with the reviewer's comment that it would be interesting to investigate if the identified \"subset microglia\" are located in a specific region of the brain or if they are equally distributed throughout it. As suggested, we addressed this question by IHC using a gene marker that is upregulated in the \"subset\" microglia (Notch4). Notably, we were able to show that NOTCH4 positive microglia (IBA1 positive cells) were evenly distributed across different brain regions. We further quantified this pattern by FACS (5.4% NOTCH4 positive cells in saline-injected mice and 18.9% in LPS-treated mice). We added this information in the main text (page 14) and included the corresponding results in Fig. EV5 .\n\nMinor comment: Fig. 3D . What does 'negative' mean? Isotype, FMO, or another population (non-microglia)?\n\nFor the unconjugated TMEM119 antibody, negative means primary antibody without secondary antibody. For P2RY12 antibody, negative means isotype PE control. We specified these details in the corresponding figure legend.\n\n------------------Referee #2:\n\nThe clinical relevance of the described LPS induced microglia subgroup in vivo to develop new treatment approaches for CNS diseases involving microglia-related neuroinflammation is not addressed in the study.

We are aware that our work raises a number of interesting questions that go beyond the scope of the current manuscript and that will be the topic of future work. With regard to the clinical relevance, we believe that acute inflammation represents the early phase of what could result in chronic inflammation and/or neurodegenerative processes. As such, understanding the microglial response at the very early phase of perturbation provides important insight into their function and adaptive capacities.\n\nThe authors responded to most points raised in the review of their article submitted to EMBO Journal. However, we feel that the following points need to be addressed prior to publication in EMBO reports. Taken together, the aim of our study was to uncover the heterogeneity of the microglial responses under early acute inflammatory conditions to elucidate potential beneficial signatures of subpopulations that could contribute to resolve inflammation, thus avoiding to enter into a chronic phase, which could lead to neurodegeneration.\n\n2. Determination of spatial distribution and brain region specific quantification of \"subset LPS\" in the CNS tissue in vivo by making use of the signature of up-and down-regulated genes as markers will add value to the study. The comparison of the spatial distribution of \"subset LPS\" between male and female mice would add further value.\n\nRegarding the first part of the comment, we agree with the reviewer's comment that it would be interesting to investigate the spatial distribution of \"subset microglia\". As suggested, we addressed this question by IHC using a gene marker that is upregulated in the \"subset\" microglia (Notch4). Notably, we were able to show that NOTCH4 positive microglia (IBA1 positive cells) were evenly distributed across different brain regions. We further quantified this pattern by FACS (5.4% NOTCH4 positive cells in saline-injected mice and 18.9% in LPS-treated mice). We added this information in the main text (page 14) and included the corresponding results in Fig. EV5 . For the second part of the remark, we believe that the comparison of the spatial distribution of \"subset LPS\" between male and female mice, although surely of high interest, goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript. As suggested, several additional genes have been included in the revised manuscript in Fig. 2E . We agree with the reviewer that a heatmap will be beneficial for a better visualization of the data. As suggested, in the revised manuscript the tSNE plots of single genes have been replaced with a heatmap. We amended the text and the figure legend accordingly. The addition of the headings has been done. We thank the reviewer to point out the inaccuracy regarding the number of states. Monocle 2 learns a principal trajectory for the centroids of the raw data cloud and afterwards puts the data points on this path. States are missing when cells in the transition state are very few and the corresponding points are projected to nearby branches. The correct number is actually 9 states for both Fig 5A and 5C . It has been corrected and specified accordingly.\n\n! ! ! ! \" common tests, such as t--test (please specify whether paired vs. unpaired), simple \u03c72 tests, Wilcoxon and Mann--Whitney tests, can be unambiguously identified by name only, but more complex techniques should be described in the methods section; \" are tests one--sided or two--sided? \" are there adjustments for multiple comparisons? \" exact statistical test results, e.g., P values = x but not P values < x; \" definition of 'center values' as median or average; \" definition of error bars as s.d. or s.e.m.\n\n1.a.
