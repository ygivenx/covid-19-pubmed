{"title": "Experimental infection of dogs (Canis familiaris) with sporulated oocysts of Neospora caninum", "body": "Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite originally reported in dogs (Bjerk\u00e5s et al., 1984) and is the major infectious cause of abortion in cattle worldwide (Anderson et al., 1991; Dubey, 2003) .\n\nDogs may start to shed oocysts 5 days after ingestion of tissues of experimentally or naturally infected animals and sporulation occurs within 24-72 h . The number of oocysts shed varies with the type of tissue ingested, age and immune status of dogs (Gondim et al., 2001 (Gondim et al., , 2005 Lindsay et al., 1999) . Dogs may shed oocysts in feces but without detectable seroconversion; thus, negative serology does not confirm the dog as free of a patent infection with N. caninum Schares et al., 2005) . The infection in dogs can occur by ingestion of tissue cysts, which highlights the importance of carnivorism (Dijkstra et al., 2001; Gondim et al., 2002 Gondim et al., , 2005 Lindsay et al., 1999) , and by tachyzoites, which transplacentally reach the fetus during pregnancy in infected females (Dubey and Lindsay, 1989; Cole et al., 1995) .\n\nRuminants may become infected through ingestion of sporulated oocysts (McCann et al., 2007) , that contaminate water and food. However, it is not known whether dogs can be infected by this route . The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of infection of dogs by the ingestion of sporulated oocysts of N. caninum.\n\nThree 8-weeks-old dogs (A, B and C) were experimentally infected with brain of seropositive buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) examined for the presence of antibodies anti-N. caninum by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). All buffaloes were male from the same farm, breed and age (around 36 months old). Dogs A, B and C consumed brain of a different buffalo, with antibody titer of 400, 200 and 200, respectively. Two dogs (A and B) were immunosuppressed with 80 mg methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol \u00ae , Pfizer, Brazil), intramuscularly, 3-4 days post infection (PI). Fecal samples from each dog were daily and individually examined for the detection of Neospora-like oocysts from day 5 to 30 PI using a standard sucrose flotation technique (Ogassawara and Benassi, 1980) . The total fecal volume of each dog was daily weighed, homogenized and 1 g was mixed with 12 ml concentrated sucrose (d = 1.205 g/cm 3 ), sieved and transferred to 15 ml tubes. After centrifugation (450 \u00d7 g, 10 min), two drops of the supernatant were recovered and transferred to a slide and light microscopically examined at 1000-fold magnification for N. caninum oocysts detection.\n\nFor sporulation, fecal samples containing oocysts were mixed with a solution of 2% potassium dichromate (w/v) in Petri dishes at 27 \u2022 C for 14 days, and then stored at 4 \u2022 C for further use. Sporulated oocysts stored for 3 months or less were used to inoculate the dogs.\n\nThe oocysts were submitted to PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) using Hsp400F and Hsp400R primers based on the Hsp70 gene . The restriction enzymes used were StuI and KpnI according to Monteiro et al. (2008) ; StuI enzyme cleaves N. caninum, forming two bands (150 + 250 bp) and KpnI cleaves the PCR products from Hammondia heydorni oocysts (136 + 264 bp). The analysis of the amplified products was performed using electrophoresis in agarose gel 2.5% (w/v) with running buffer 0.5\u00d7 TBE (0.045 M Tris-borate and 0.001 M EDTA, pH 8.0). Positive controls were extracted from known samples of N. caninum (Nc-1strain) and oocysts of H. heydorni (stock HheBR) that were previously characterized by molecular methods (Monteiro et al., 2008 ) and compared to sampled material.\n\nA group of three gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) was used as control of the viability of the oocysts of N. caninum. Each gerbil was orally inoculated with 1000 oocysts and followed for a period of 60 days. After this period the gerbils were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 0.015 ml of 2% xylazine (Kensol \u00ae , Konig, Brazil) associated with 0.03 ml of ketamine 10% (Vetaset \u00ae , Fort Dodge, Brazil) and intracardiac blood was collected. After the collection, the gerbils were euthanized with 0.2 ml of T61 \u00ae (Intervet, Brazil) and a section of the brain and heart was collected for the detection of the parasite by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, samples of spleen, liver and skeletal muscles were analyzed by IHC. Direct examination of brain sections, using smear slides and coverslips, were performed to detect tissue cysts of N. caninum.\n\nThe blood of the gerbils was tested for the presence of anti-N. caninum antibodies by IFAT (Dubey et al., 1988) at 1:50 and 1:100 using secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled anti-gerbil antibodies (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, USA) and intact tachyzoites of N. caninum (strain NC-1) as antigen, and by Western blotting (WB) at 1:100 according to Schares et al. (2005) .\n\nFour 2-month-old dogs (1, 2, 3 and 4), mixed-breed, from 1.0 to 2.0 kg body weight, seronegative for N. caninum (IFAT \u226450) and Toxoplasma gondii (IFAT \u226416) were selected. These dogs were housed individually, fed commercial food and received water ad libitum and were dewormed and vaccinated against parvovirus, parainfluenza, corona virus, leptospirosis and canine distemper (Duramune \u00ae Max5CvK -Fort Dodge, Brazil) prior the infection with N. caninum oocysts.\n\nThe oocysts obtained from the bioassay in dogs were counted in a Neubauer chamber and four aliquots were separated: two aliquots of 1 \u00d7 10 4 oocysts, one aliquot of 5 \u00d7 10 3 and another of 1 \u00d7 10 3 oocysts. Each of these aliquots was inoculated orally into a dog, as follows: dog 1 and dog 4 were infected with 10 4 oocysts, dog 2 with 5 \u00d7 10 3 oocysts and dog 3 with 1 \u00d7 10 3 oocysts of N. can-inum. The bioassay of gerbils started on the same day the dogs were infected, as described in Section 2.2.\n\nThe feces of the dogs were individually collected from day 5 to 30 PI and kept under refrigeration at 4 \u2022 C until the coproparasitological examination for the detection of Neospora-like oocysts. After this period, a serological monitoring of dogs was performed monthly up to 6 months PI for detection of antibodies anti-N. caninum. The dogs that became positive were removed from the study. The sera of the dogs were analyzed by IFAT using a cutoff point of 1:50 (Cheadle et al., 1999; Mineo et al., 2001) , by WB at 1:100 with immunodominant antigens present in total extract of tachyzoites (Schares et al., 2005) , and with a native p38-antigen (NcSRS2) purified by immune-affinity chromatography from tachyzoite lysates (Schares et al., 2000) .\n\nAnimal management and veterinarian procedures with gerbils and dogs were approved and are in accordance to the Animal Use Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (protocol number 1207/2007).\n\nSix months after inoculation with oocysts, dogs 1 and 2 were euthanized for detection of N. caninum. Tissues (brain, muscle, lymph nodes, liver, lung, heart and bone marrow) were collected for IHC and PCR targeting the Nc-5 gene .\n\nA section of the brain (approximately 10 g) was separated to perform bioassay in gerbils (Dubey and Lindsay, 2000) . The brains were individually macerated using a mortar and pestle with 15 ml of trypsin (0.25%), transferred to centrifuge tubes and incubated for 50 min at 37 \u2022 C with mixing every 10 min. Then the material was washed with PBS to remove the trypsin, by centrifugations (2000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C). Brains samples of dogs 1 and 2 were intraperitoneally inoculated to groups of two gerbils per brain. These animals were followed for 90 days and euthanized as described in Section 2.2. The brain, heart, liver, lung, lymph nodes, muscle and bone marrow of the gerbils were collected and examined by PCR and, the serum was tested for the presence of anti-N. caninum antibodies. Direct examination of the brain for the detection of cysts of N. caninum was also conducted.\n\nThe tissues of the dogs were also examined for the presence of the parasite by histopathological techniques, staining with hematoxylin-eosin and IHC (Corbellini et al., 2000) .\n\nDNA for real-time PCR was extracted from brain and heart samples of each gerbil. Tissues were frozen liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a mortar and pestle and incubated with DNAzol \u00ae (DNAZOL \u00ae Reagent, GIBCO, USA) until cellular lyses was complete. Subsequently the material was centrifuged at 10.000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Absolute ethanol was used to precipitate nuclear material and subsequently extracted from the supernatant. After several washes with 70% ethanol the DNA was solubilized into 8 mM of NaOH solution. DNA concentration and quality were estimated by a spectrophotometer reading at 260 and 280 nm (BioPhotometer, Eppendorf, USA).\n\nFifty nanograms of DNA were used in each amplification reaction using universal real-time PCR buffer (TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems, USA) and a specific set of primers and probe (Sense: 5 -GCGGACGTGTCGTTGTTG-3 , Anti-sense: 5 -GTTCACACACTATAGCCACAAACAA-3 , Probe 5 -VIC CCTGCGGCAGCAAGGCTCCTT-TAMRA-3 ) for the Nc5 gene of N. caninum (accession number AY665719) and a endogenous control 18S (Eukariotic 18S rRNA Endogenous Control, Applied Biosystems, USA). DNA extract from tachyzoites of N. caninum (NC-1 strain) and Milli-Q water served as positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\nAmplifications were performed using 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA) equipment and subjected to 50 \u2022 C for 2 min, 95 \u2022 C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 \u2022 C for 15 s and, 60 \u2022 C for 1 min. Amplification curves were analyzed by Sequence detection software (SDS, v1.3, Applied Biosystems, USA).\n\nReactions were considered positive if the fluorescent signal increased during amplification and negative if the fluorescent signal remained at the same basal level observed during the beginning of the amplification cycles.\n\nTissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) were employed for the histopathogical examination. N. caninum detection was performed by an IHC test using anti-N. caninum primary antibody (VMRD, Pullman, USA).\n\nThe tissues were initially incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase. Antigen retrieval was performed using 0.1% trypsin for 10 min at 37 \u2022 C followed by heat (microwave on full power 2 min) with the slides immersed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 (1 l of distilled water, 2.1 g C 6 H 8 O 7 , adjusted to pH 6.0 with 0.5% NaOH). Nonspecific labeling was reduced by applying 5% reduced-fat milk for 15 min. The primary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature (37 \u2022 C) followed by 20 min with linking solution (LSAB Kit, Universal, K0690, Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) and for 25 min with streptavidin-peroxidase, using phosphate-buffered saline washings between steps. Labeling was performed using the chromogen 3,5diaminobenzidine tetra-hydrochloride as a substrate (DAB, Dako K3468, USA) for 5-10 min. Hematoxylin applied for 1 min was used as a counter stain (Corbellini et al., 2000) .\n\nGerbil and dog sera were tested for anti-N. caninum antibodies by Indirect fluorescence antibody tests (Dubey et al., 1988) using secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled anti-gerbil and anti-dog antibodies (Immunology Consul- tants Laboratory and Sigma, USA) and intact tachyzoites of N. caninum (strain NC-1) as antigen. The cutoff was set at 1:50.\n\nThe Nc-1 strain of N. caninum (Dubey et al., 1988) was maintained in Vero cell cultures and purified following protocol of Schares et al. (1998 Schares et al. ( , 1999 . Tachyzoites obtained from the culture were frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until needed for WB.\n\nAffinity chromatography employing monoclonal antibodies mAb 4.15.15, as described by Schares et al. (2000) , was used to purify N. caninum surface antigens p38 (NcSRS2).\n\nWhole tachyzoite antigens of N. caninum and purified surfaced antigens (Schares et al., 1998) were used for the WB test. Pellets containing 4 \u00d7 107 N. caninum tachyzoites and purified p38 (0.05 g) were incubated in buffer (2% [w/v] SDS, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 62 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 1 min at 94 \u2022 C and separated in polyacrylamide gel (SDS) at 12% [w/v] (60 mm \u00d7 70 mm \u00d7 1 mm in size). The antigens were subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, USA) which, after the transfer, were blocked with PBS-TG (PBS with 0.05% [v/v]), Tween 20 (Sigma, USA) and 2% liquid fish gelatin (v/v) (Serva, Germany). The membranes were cut into strips for later examination.\n\nWhen using total antigen of N. caninum, the reactivity of sera with immunodominant antigens of N. caninum tachyzoites (Nc-IDA) of 29, 30, 33 and 37 kDa was recorded (Schares et al., 2000) . For the WB employing the purified p38 protein (NcSRS2) reactivity of the sera with a single band at 38 kDa was recorded.\n\nTo detect anti-N. caninum antibodies, incubations of the WB strips followed methodology as described by Schares et al. (1998) with modifications. Sera from the gerbil and dogs were diluted at 1:100 in PBS-TG and serum from an experimentally infected gerbil and from dog with congen-ital infection was used as positive control (Schares et al., 2005) .\n\nOne of the immunosuppressed dogs (A) died 5 days PI and the other (B) shed Neospora-like oocysts 8-17 days PI. Dog (C) which had received no immunosuppressive treatment did not shed oocysts.\n\nThe oocysts shed by dog B were tested separately, according to the day of shedding, and were identified as N. caninum (Fig. 1) by PCR-RFLP. The three gerbils of the bioassay, which were inoculated with oocysts, presented anti-N. caninum antibodies by IFAT (\u2265100) and by WB on day 60 PI. By real-time PCR, brains were positive, whereas hearts were negative. Cysts in the brain of gerbils were not observed by direct examination.\n\nNone of the dogs inoculated with sporulated oocysts of N. caninum shed oocysts in the feces during the observation period of 30 days. Dogs 1 and 4, which received the largest number of oocysts (10 4 ), presented anti-N. caninum antibodies 30 days PI with IFAT titer of 1600 and 800, respectively, and the dog 2 and dog 3, which had received 5 \u00d7 10 3 and 1 \u00d7 10 3 oocysts, respectively, did not seroconvert during the 6 months of observation (Table 1) . The WB showed bands which represented specific reactions with immunodominant antigens present in the total extract of tachyzoites, as well as with purified p38 (NcSRS2) antigen, confirming all IFAT findings (Fig. 2) . \n\nAll the tissues from dogs 1 and 2, were tested negative for N. caninum by real-time PCR and by IHC. The bioassay of gerbils that were infected with the brain of those dogs was negative by direct examination, PCR and serology.\n\nThe elimination of oocysts by a dog infected with brain of B. bubalis confirming previous findings that buffaloes are N. caninum intermediate hosts (Rodrigues et al., 2004) . The observation that not all infected dogs eliminate oocysts could be due the use of different buffaloes as source of infection. Some of the buffaloes could be more heavily infected than others and no information regarding the N. caninum isolates was available.\n\nThe viability of N. caninum oocysts obtained from donor dogs was confirmed by molecular and biological methods. During the bioassay in gerbils, the presence of serum antibodies (IFAT and WB) and the DNA (real time PCR) in gerbil tissues confirmed the viability of the N. caninum oocysts used as inocula for dogs.\n\nThe oral uptake of N. caninum oocysts by dogs caused no patent infection with shedding of oocysts; however, the finding of N. caninum-specific antibodies seemed to be dose dependent, since only dogs that were inoculated with the higher dose of oocysts (10 4 ) seroconverted.\n\nThe results of the present study suggest that an oral infection of dogs with N. caninum oocysts is not able to induce a patent infection. This is in contrast to the observations in T. gondii-infected cats where the ingestion of oocysts of T. gondii is capable of inducing infection and shedding of oocysts in feces. The pre-patent period is longer (18 days or more) and few cats shed small amounts oocysts in (Dubey, 2006) when the route of infection is by ingestion of oocysts. Thus, for N. caninum as for other coccidians that form cysts (such as Sarcocystis spp. and T. gondii), the most efficient route of transmitting the agent is by carnivorism, when the definitive host ingests tissue cysts containing bradyzoites (Dubey, 2001 (Dubey, , 2006 .\n\nIn this study, the dogs received doses ranging from 10 3 to 10 4 oocysts and only the dogs that received 10 4 oocysts seroconverted. These doses can be considered high, as naturally or experimentally infected dogs shed few oocysts in feces (Basso et al., 2001 (Basso et al., , 2009 McGarry et al., 2003; McInnes et al., 2006; Pena et al., 2007; Schares et al., 2005; \u0160lapeta et al., 2002) , so under natural conditions the chances for a dog to ingest a high number of oocysts are low.\n\nIt is known that a dose of 10 3 oocysts of N. caninum was able to cause infection and death in gerbils 6-13 days PI (Dubey and Lindsay, 2000) . De Marez et al. (1999) infected calves with oocysts of N. caninum (10 4 and 10 5 ) and all animals seroconverted 4 weeks PI and DNA were detected by PCR. Trees et al. (2002) infected pregnant cows with 600 oocysts of N. caninum and this dose was sufficient to infect these animals, as confirmed by PCR and seroconversion 3 weeks PI, but this dose was unable to cause abortion and there was no evidence of transplacental transmission, indicating the interference of infectious dose in the clinical signs observed.\n\nIt is known that the absence of antibodies does not mean that the dog is free from infection . Dogs experimentally infected can shed oocysts without detection of antibodies for at least 6 months (Dijkstra et al., 2001; Lindsay et al., 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2004) and it has already been reported the seroconversion in infected dogs at least seven months PI (Gondim et al., 2002) . In the present study dogs infected with lower doses remained seronegative until the end of the experimental period.\n\nDue to the predilection of the parasite for the central nervous system, bioassay in gerbil was performed with the brain of a seropositive and a seronegative dog. PCR and IHC were also performed with the brain and other tissues (muscle, lymph node, liver, lung, heart and bone marrow) of these dogs; however, results from both dogs were negative.\n\nIn conclusion the results provide evidence that in dogs infected with high doses of sporulated N. caninum oocysts no patent infection but a specific antibody response against the tachyzoites of the parasite is induced. This suggests that these dogs may have become intermediate host of N. caninum."}
