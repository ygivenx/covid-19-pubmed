{"title": "", "body": "Microbiolog .Newsletter Iol. 6, No. 8 April 15, 1984 .f,i,, -- A number of viruses have been as-;ociated with acute nonbacterial gasroenteritis including adenovirus, astro-Arus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and !ninireovirus, but only Norwalk agent md rotavirus have been unequivocally implicated in human disease. The former is responsible for epidemic infections in school-age children and ~dults, whereas the l~tter is responsible for both endemic and epidemic disease. Rotavirus infects all ages, but is bf greatest significance in children from 6 months to 2 years old (2) . It has been suggested that rotavirus is responsible for up to 80% of viral gastroenteritis (13) .\n\nInitially, electron microscopy (EM) :was used to detect rotavirus particles in diarrheal stools. Subsequently, a multitude of other techniques for detecting the virus have been developed, including immur ~ EM, immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassay, RNA electrophoresis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (3,5-9, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21) . The advent of commerical ELISA assays for rotavirus (Rotazyme, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL: Erzygnost, Behring Institut, Marburg, Federal Republic of Germany; Dako, distributed by Accurate Biochemicals, Hun-tington, NY) now allows the rapid diagnosis of rotavirus infection by clinical laboratories not having specialized equipment and technology available to them.\n\nRotavirus is a member of the reovirus family. The intact particle is 70 nm in diameter and has a doubleshelled outer capsid, which causes the virus to resemble a wheel (Latin, rota, wheel). Both single-and doubleshelled particles are seen in infected stool. The outer shell contains typespecific antigens, whereas the inner shell contains group-specific antigens (2, 21) .\n\nThere are two major serotypes of human rotavirus and an unknown number of less common human serotypes (7, 20, 21) . Four major groups of rotavirus have been identified, represented by human, bovine, porcine, and canine-simian strains (7) .\n\nThe genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. The patterns produced by electrophoresis of the RNA have led to the identification of multiple electropherotypes. Serotype appears to correlate with mobility of segments 10 and 11, whereas segment 6 is associated with group-specific antigen. It has been suggested that rotavirus may undergo genome reassortment similar to that seen with influenza viruses (6) . Fu.rther work is required to clarify the significance of the electropherotypes.\n\nAttempts at propagating human rotavirus in cell culture have had little suc-cess (13) . Some animal strains, however, are readily cultured. Antibodies to these strains cross-react with human rotavirus and were used to develop the current immunoassays.\n\nRotavirus has been implicated in about 50% of the cases of acute diarrhea in hospitalized children between 6 months and 2 years of age (2, 12) . Infection occurs worldwide and peaks in the winter months in temperate climates. Primary symptoms are vomiting and/or diarrhea. Vomiting and dehydration are more marked in rota-virus infection than in other infant diarrhea: Therapy is limited to fluid and electrolyte replacement. The disease generally resolves spontaneously in 4 to 8 days (2) . An upper respiratory prodrome is common in children with rotavirus disease (12, 13) , and rotavirus has occasionally been demonstrated in upper respiratory tract specimens (19) . Rotavirus has been detected in the stools of some cases of sudden infant death syndrome, but the significance of this is unclear (19) .\n\nBy 2 years of age, most children have antibody to both major rotavirus serotypes (2). Antibody is not associated with resistance to infection, but moderates the severity of symptoms. This reduction in disease severity appears to be serotype-sl~e'cific and may be mediated more by intestinal IgA than serum IgG (1, 20) .\n\nRotavirus infection is not uncommon in older children and adults, but disease is generally mild or asymptomatic (2, 13, 16) . Severe gastroenteritis is uncommon and usually occurs during epidemics (5, 16) . Whether an uncommon serotype is responsible for such epidemics has not been investigated. Elderly (4) and immunosuppressed (17) patients may have more severe symptoms with rotavirus infections.\n\nAlthough children less than 6 months old are frequently asymptomatic (for reasons that are not clear), they are readily infected with and shed virus (1, 2, 13, 14) . In some nurseries where the virus had become endemic, about 50% of the infants had rotavirus in their stools. Of these, about three-fourths were without symptoms (1, 14) .\n\nAsymptomatic viral shedding can occur in all age groups. In one day care center, 12% of children under 2 years of age had rotavirus positive stools but no symptoms (10) . As many as 1% of asymptomatic adults may shed rotavirus (16) .\n\nDetection of rotavirus in stool by electron microscopy was the original method of diagnosis and remains a reference method. Because of the distinctive appearance of the virion, false positive results are minimal when the test is performed by an experienced microscopist. However, detection by EM generally requires virus concentrations on the order of 107 to 108 particles per ml (15) . Many methods for detecting rotavirus, including EM, are not practical for most laboratories. However, the commercially available ELISA assays can be readily performed.\n\nRotazyme is presently the only rotavirus test manufactured in the United States for clinical use, although other commercial test kits should be available shortly. The test is carried out by incubating a stool sample with a plastic bead to which guinea pig antibody to simian rotavirus SA-I 1 has been adsorbed. After a washing step, any virions bound to the bead react with added rabbit antirotavirus antibody which has been conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The amount of peroxidase bound to the bead is measured by the change in optical density after incubation with o-phenylenediamine. This change may be measured visually or with a spectrophotometer and reflects the concentration of rotavirus in the stool sample.\n\nIn serial dilution studies the Rotazyme assay was more sensitive that. electron microscopy; the limit of detection was at least tenfold fewer virions per ml than for conventional EM (9, 15) . The results of several clinical studies suggest 90 to 95% sensitivity for Rotazyme (3, 8, 9, 15, 18) .\n\nOverall the test has a 90 to 95% specificity (3, 8, 9, 15, 18) , but Krause et al. reported a high incidence of false positive results in infants less than 3 months old. When stools from an unselected series of infants (most of whom did not have diarrhea) were screened, 22% were positive and greater than 90% of these were falsely positive as determined by failure to detect rotavirus by EM and by demonstrating reactivity with serum from nonimmunized animals (11) . False positive tests do not appear to be a problem in children over 3 months of age or in adults.\n\nEnzygnost and Dako are ELISA assays that use antibody-coated microtiter trays instead of plastic beads and are designed for multiple sample testing. These assays have the advantage that they include nonimmune serum control wells to enable differentiation of false and true positives in neonates. Neither Enzygnost nor Dako have had extensive published evaluations. However, in one study, no significant differences were seen in the sensitivity and specificity of Enzygnost and Rotazyme (18) .\n\nThe ELISA rotavirus tests appear to be most useful for diagnosing gastroenteritis in children 6 months to 2 years old, and in epidemiology studies. A positive test should not preclude the search for other pathogens, because of the relative frequency of asymptomatic shedding of rotavirus. In children less than 3 months old, positive tests should be confirmed by EM or by an immunologic assay with controls for nonspecific interactions. 0196-4399/84/$0.0o + 02.00\n\nClinical Microbiology Newsletter"}
