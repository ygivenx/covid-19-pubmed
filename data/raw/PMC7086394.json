{"title": "Modulation of Coiled-Coil Binding Strength and Fusogenicity\nthrough Peptide Stapling", "body": "Intramolecular cross-linking\nof peptides, commonly referred to\nas peptide stapling, is often employed to change or constrain the\nsecondary structure of small peptides and to induce unstructured peptides\nto mimic complex protein folds and protein\u2013protein interactions\n(PPIs).1\u22124 Stapling also contributes to an increased resistance to denaturation\nand proteolytic degradation, making it a useful technique for the\nmodification of peptide-based therapeutics.5 Hydrocarbon stapling, a technique which is based on catalyzed olefin\nmetathesis, has seen widespread application with multiple compounds\nbeing investigated in academic, preclinical, and clinical studies.6\u221210\n\nPeptide stapling techniques can be broadly divided into two\ncategories:\nsingle- and two-component strategies. Single-component strategies\nincorporate amino acids that can be cross-linked selectively, or protection\nstrategies are chosen that allow selective cross-linking. Common single-component\nstapling strategies include disulfide bonding,11 lactam bridges,12,13 and olefin metathesis.10 Two-component stapling adds a bifunctional cross-linker\nto bridge two amino-acid side chains; the most common techniques are\nbased on cysteine cross-linking and triazole linkages.14\u221217 Two-component strategies are in principle more complex than single-component\nstrategies, but they allow for a more flexible cross-linker design,\nas it does not need to be compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis.\nAlthough most stapling techniques are used to increase or constrain\npeptide helicity, systems that compare different methods are often\nbased around short peptide sequences, and although multiple comparisons\nhave been made,18,19 the ideal cross-linking technique\nis still open to debate.20\n\nThe \u03b1-helix\nsecondary structure motif has been mimicked using\nstapled peptides due to its common occurrence in proteins and therefore\nits potential as a PPI mimic.21 Coiled\ncoils, which are protein-folding motifs comprising two or more \u03b1-helices,\nare intrinsically helical, and therefore, techniques commonly used\nfor the stapling of helices should permit modulation of coiled-coil\ninteractions. Indeed, Rao et al. have shown lactam bridges can be\nused to generate short, helical, cFos binding peptides,22 and Haney and Horne have used oxime cross-linking\nto generate stapled variants of the GCN4-p1 coiled-coil domain.23 More recently, Wu et al. used a bis-triazole\nstapling technique to increase peptide binding to the polymerase \u03b1\naccessory factor ctf4,15 and Lathbridge\nand Mason showed that lactam-bridged heptapeptides can be used for\nthe de novo design of a coiled-coil binding peptide.24\n\nTogether, these studies provide methods\nfor the cross-linking of\ncoiled-coil or coiled-coil-binding peptides, but it is unclear which\nmethod would prove to be the most effective when applied to a different\ncoiled-coil system. The size of the macrocycle formed varies significantly\nbetween the different cross-linking techniques, as do the polarity\nand hydrophobicity of the cross-linkers in question. Interactions\nof the asymmetric oxime moiety with different amino acid side chains\nresulted in different binding strengths when the cross-linker was\nreversed in Haney and Horne\u2019s method. This necessitated the\npreparation and evaluation of both variants, and indicates oxime cross-linking\neffectiveness is dependent on amino acid composition.\n\nOur lab\nhas developed a model system for membrane fusion, inspired\nby naturally occurring SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors)\nproteins.25 This system consists of a pair\nof complementary peptides dubbed E and K, which form a heterodimeric\ncoiled-coil that can be attached to lipid membranes via a PEG spacer\nand lipid anchor.26 Like SNARE proteins,\nthis model system promotes the fusion of lipid membranes, and it can\nbe facilely modified to study the process of membrane fusion via structure\u2013activity\nrelationships.27 It has recently been discovered\nthat these two peptides play different roles in the fusion process.28 The interactions of the K peptide with lipid\nmembranes have been hypothesized as an important factor in membrane\nfusion efficiency.29 Membrane interactions\ncan occur simultaneously with the formation of the coiled-coil domain\nin a membrane fusion interface (as visualized in Scheme 1C); therefore, a fine balance\nbetween the two must be achieved. In addition, both membrane binding\nand coiled-coil formation depend on the peptides adopting a helical\nstructure; we believe stapling should allow for the generation of\npeptides with varied helical structures, which will in turn affect\ncoiled-coil formation and membrane binding interactions. Studying\nthe effects of modulating the membrane interactions and coiled-coil\nbinding affinity will generate insights into the importance of both\nfactors in membrane fusion.\n\nWhen attempting to modulate the behavior of the\nheterodimeric coiled\ncoil used in our group,30 the choice of\ncross-linking technique was not obvious, due to the differences observed\nin previously employed cross-linking techniques (vide supra). The position of the cross-linker and the macrocycle size were\ndeemed the most influential characteristics in the previously mentioned\ncross-linking strategies; therefore, we wanted to evaluate both of\nthese criteria independently for our system. The most favorable candidates\ncould then be used to test the effect of structural changes on coiled-coil-based\nmembrane fusion. One stapling strategy that attracted our attention\nwas developed by the DeGrado lab, and it is based on the alkylation\nof cysteine using dibromoxylenes.31 The\nadvantage of this system lies in the rigidity provided by the aromatic\nring, allowing precise spacing between the two thiol moieties by selecting\none of the three different structural isomers of dibromoxylene: ortho, meta, and para; Scheme 1. In the original\nstudy, meta-xylene showed the most promise as a cross-linker,\nand further investigations in the same group have therefore focused\non this variant.32,33 Other recent investigations have\nalso predominantly used the meta derivative,34,35 and when a comparison was made between the isomers, only short or\nunstructured peptides were used. This means the question of whether,\nfor a helical or coiled-coil peptide, meta-xylene\nis indeed the best cross-linking moiety is unanswered. Therefore,\nto probe the effect of stapling on coiled-coil peptides, we elected\nto investigate dibromoxylene cross-linking of cysteines, employing\nall three structural isomers in order to elucidate the role of cross-linker\nsize and its effect on structure and activity.\n\nIn this study,\na library of nine stapled peptides was prepared\nby modifying peptide K via cysteine alkylation. These stapled K-peptide\nderivatives exhibited systematic variations in helicity and thermal\nstability, as observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The\ncoiled-coil binding thermodynamics were studied using isothermal titration\ncalorimetry (ITC), and it was discovered that increased coiled-coil\nbinding is based on a preorganization effect. These observed changes\nin structure and binding dynamics were heavily dependent on the location\nof the staple and the choice of cross-linker. In lipid- and content-mixing\nexperiments, a significant change in fusogenicity was measured for\nselected stapled peptides, which was attributed to the altered coiled-coil\ninteractions.\n\nThe starting point for structural\nmodification is one peptide of a three-heptad heterodimeric coiled-coil\npair first reported by Litowski and Hodges.36 The two peptides are named after the abundance of either glutamic\nacid (Glu, E) or lysine (Lys, K), and each peptide contains a C-terminal\nglycine and either tyrosine or tryptophan as a fluorescent reporter,\ngiving rise to E3GY and K3GW. To facilitate\nstapling, two amino acids in peptide K3GW were modified\nto cysteine, spaced i to i + 4 to\nbest match a single \u03b1-helical turn. Amino acids that are involved\nin electrostatic (positions e and g) or hydrophobic (positions a or d) interactions were not varied to ensure the stapled peptides retained\nthe same stabilizing coiled-coil interactions as the parent peptides.\nThree different variants were generated each with the cysteines and\ntherefore the staple, in a different heptad, Table 1. Each of these positional variants was stapled\nwith ortho-, meta-, and para-dibromoxylene, generating a library of nine stapled\npeptides. When referring to these stapled peptide variants, a notation\nwhich reflects the position and type of cross-linker is used, for\nexample, K3GW-1M signifies the cross-linker\nis in the first heptad and the meta variant has been\nemployed.\n\nCD\nspectroscopy was employed\nto determine the secondary structure of the stapled peptide variants;\nthe effects of both the stapling location and the size of the cross-linker\ncan be clearly observed, Figures 1 and S1. Peptide stapling\nclose to the C-terminus (K3GW-3 variants) showed the largest\nincrease in \u03b1-helicity for all three xylenes, whereas modification\nin the second heptad (K3GW-2 variants) showed the lowest\nincrease. Notably, when para-xylene was used as the\ncross-linker in the second heptad, the overall peptide helicity was\nreduced, Figure 1B,\nshowing para-xylene is too large to form an ideal\n\u03b1-helix. The N-terminal positions (K3GW-1 variants)\nall show a moderate increase in helicity, largely independent of staple\nsize, confirming the previously observed trend for hydrocarbon stapling\nto be most effective at peptide termini.37 Using temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy, an increase in melting\ntemperature (Tm) could be determined for\nthe stapled peptide variants, as shown in Figures 2 and S2, with\nthe change in Tm closely following the\nobserved changes in helicity. C-terminal modification showed the largest\nincrease in melting temperature, with the ortho-xylene\ncross-linker yielding the most stable peptides over all three peptide\nvariants, followed by the meta-xylene cross-linker.\nAll stapled peptides interacted with E3GY, showing typical\ncoiled-coil spectra as is evident in Figures 1C and S1. C-terminal\nstapling showed the highest helicity, while the N-terminal stapled\npeptides did not have increased coiled-coil helicity compared to the\nstaples located in the central heptad. In contrast to the stapled\npeptides in isolation, meta-xylene-modified peptides\nshow the most \u03b1-helical structure as a coiled coil. ortho-Xylene stapled peptides had the largest increase in Tm for all three positions (Figure 2), and the trends in coiled-coil\nstability are similar to those observed for the single peptides, with\nan average increase in Tm of 4.9 \u00b0C\nfor the stapled peptides (Table S1) and\n4.8 \u00b0C for their coiled coils (Table S2). meta-Xylene was previously shown to have the\nlargest increase in helicity in small unstructured peptides,31 but in the E/K system ortho-xylene stapled variants yielded the highest single-peptide helicity\nand largest increase in Tm for both the\npeptides and their respective coiled-coils. Because it is possible\nthat stapling affects coiled-coil interactions without changing peptide\nhelicity as observed via the thermal unfolding experiments, the effect\nof peptide stapling on coiled-coil binding was further investigated\nusing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).\n\nDirect\ndetermination of the dissociation constant (Kd) and enthalpy of binding (\u0394Hb) and therefore calculation of the free energy (\u0394Gb) and entropy of binding (\u0394Sb) is possible using ITC (Figure S3), allowing investigation of peptide interactions independent of\npeptide structure.38 The results shown\nin Figure 3 and Table S3 show that, in general, coiled-coil binding\nof peptides K3GW and E3GY is strongly enthalpically\nfavored but entropically unfavored. The effect of enthalpy can be\nexplained via the formation of amide hydrogen bonds and electrostatic\ninteractions upon folding of the peptide. When the C-terminally stapled\nvariants of peptide K3GW are analyzed, the Kd is decreased from 73 to 22 and 24 nM for the 3O and 3M variants, respectively, and to\n51 nM for the 3P variant. A large decrease in \u0394Sb was observed and was directly related to the\nsize of the implemented staple. ortho-Xylene stapling\nat the C-terminus reduced the effect of entropy upon binding from\n37 to 24 kJ/mol, a reduction of 35%. At the same time, an increase\nin the \u0394Hb from \u221277 to \u221268\nkJ/mol was observed, counteracting the observed entropic effects and\nleading to the conclusion that the mechanism of peptide stapling relies\non a preorganization effect: through conformational restriction, the\npeptide is preorganized in a helical conformation which reduces the\nentropic effects of binding, but some of the energy that is gained\nupon formation of an \u03b1-helix is also lost. Although the Kd for the C-terminal ortho-\nand meta-xylene stapled peptides is comparable, the\n\u0394Sb is more favorable for the ortho variant, explaining the large differences in Tm observed for these two peptides. At all three\nstapling positions, the ortho variants show a reduced\neffect of entropy upon binding compared to the meta variants, which is likely caused by the smaller size of the ortho cross-linker. A smaller cross-linker restricts the\nmaximum distance between the two helical turns and therefore limits\nthe number of possible conformations that the peptide can assume.\n\nRecently, Miles et al. screened hydrocarbon-stapled\npeptides as\nprotein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) mimics against Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 and observed similar changes in the \u0394Hb and \u0394Sb for\ntheir stapled peptides; however, they observed an overall increase\nin \u0394Gb.39 Binding kinetics determined via a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)\nassay showed that the binding of their PPI mimic could best be explained\nvia an induced fit mechanism, where the PPI can interact via multiple\nbinding modes. Restricting the potential conformations of the peptide\nthrough the introduction of a staple reduced the number of possible\nbinding modes and therefore increased the overall Kd of the system. The E/K peptides used in this paper are\ndesigned and experimentally confirmed to form heterodimeric coiled-coils\nexclusively.40 As there is only one binding\nmode, the observed changes in structure and stability, as determined\nvia CD, show a direct correlation with the binding thermodynamics\nin ITC: C-terminal stapling using ortho- and meta-xylene is the most effective way to increase the binding\nstrength of coiled-coil peptides.\n\nThe effectiveness of E/K-based membrane\nfusion is partially attributed to the membrane interactions of peptide\nK, which are theorized to induce membrane curvature and therefore\naccelerate the transition from membrane docking to hemifusion.41 The interactions of peptide K with lipid membranes\nare based on a lysine snorkeling mechanism, which describes the hydrophobic\namino acids in the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d position inserting in a lipid membrane, helped\nby the favorable electrostatic interactions between lysines and the\nphosphate groups of the lipid membrane.42 This is a reversible process that can only happen when the peptide\nfolds into an amphipathic helix and all the hydrophobic amino acids\nare positioned on the same face. Peptide stapling, which changes the\noverall peptide conformation, is therefore theorized to have an effect\non membrane binding. The membrane partition coefficient (Kp) of the stapled K variants was assayed via tryptophan\nfluorescence titration experiments, and the results are shown in Figure 4. Membrane binding\nwas either comparable to that of unmodified K3GW or was\nincreased up to a factor of 2 and did not show any correlation to\nthe location of the staple or to the overall helicity of the peptide\n(Figure S4). The difference in partition\ncoefficient between K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M is striking, as the value is almost\nhalf for the ortho variant despite the helicity of\nthe two being very similar. This shows that the addition of a hydrophobic\ncross-linking moiety between the \u201cb\u201d\nand \u201cf\u201d position does not increase\nthe membrane affinity of amphiphilic \u03b1-helical peptides in a\nstructure-dependent manner and leads to the hypothesis that peptide\nK3GW does not bind to liposomal membranes as a highly structured\n\u03b1-helix.\n\nCD experiments were performed with the C-terminal stapled peptides\nin the presence of liposomes, and this data showed a reduced ellipticity\nat 222 nm and a high 208/222 nm ratio (see Figure S6). This indicates that the peptides are less \u03b1-helical\nin the presence of liposomes, which supports this hypothesis. If partitioning\nfrom the aqueous phase into the membrane is assumed to require partial\nunfolding of the peptide helix, the difference in binding strength\nbetween the ortho and meta variants\ncan also be explained by the smaller size of the ortho cross-linker, which restricts the ability of the peptide to unfold.\n\nComplete fusion of two lipid-membrane-enclosed spaces\nwill result in homogeneous mixing of the lipids in the inner and outer\nleaflets, as well as mixing of the inner contents. In a liposomal\nsystem, this process can be studied via the incorporation of chromophores\ninto the lipid bilayer or on the inside of the liposomes.\n\nFusion\nof these liposomes with nonlabeled liposomes will result in a fluorescence\nchange which can be quantified to compare the peptide fusogenicity.\nLipopeptides were prepared which contained cholesterol and a polyethyleneglycol\n(PEG4) spacer at the N-terminus, facilitating membrane\nanchoring.43 Stapled peptides K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M were\nselected for fusion studies because these gave rise to the largest\nstructural and thermodynamic changes. Moreover, their binding strength\nis comparable, but their partition coefficient differs by a factor\nof 2; therefore, by testing both and comparing them to unmodified\nK3GW, the effect of both coiled-coil binding strength and\nmembrane binding on fusogenicity can be determined. The lipopeptides\nwere prepared using a novel on-resin stapling technique enabled by\nthe use of 4-methoxytrityl (Mtt) protected cysteine; full details\nare available in the Experimental Section.\nThese peptides were tested for fusogenicity together with the lipidated\nvariant of E3GY (structures can be found in Scheme S1).\n\nLipid mixing was quantified\nusing a F\u00f6rster resonance energy\ntransfer (FRET) pair incorporated in the lipid membrane, and the results\nare shown in Figure 5A. The amount of lipid mixing observed was comparable for K3GW and K3GW-3M at 1% peptide concentration,\nwhile the K3GW-3O variant showed increased\nlipid mixing 6 min after the start of the experiment. This indicates\nthat docking of the liposomes occurs at the same speed but more lipid\nmixing occurs for the K3GW-3O variant.\nAs the absolute amount of lipid mixing was low, the same experiment\nwas also performed with 2% of the lipopeptides, which doubled the\namount of lipid mixing observed while retaining the same trends (Figure S7).\n\nContent mixing experiments\nwhen performed properly are the best\nmeasure for complete fusion of two lipid membranes. The membrane-impermeable\nsulforhodamine B (SrB) dye was employed as a fluorescent reporter\nand showed significant increases in fusion for both stapled peptide\nvariants, Figure 5B,\nwith the K3GW-3M variant doubling the\namount of content mixing compared to K3GW (from 17.1% to\n36.2%). The K3GW-3O variant produced an\neven larger increase; up to 93% content mixing was observed after\n60 min, with an average of 79.5% .\n\nThis is surprising, since\nthere was no observed difference between\nK3GW and the K3GW-3M variant\nduring lipid mixing experiments. An immediate difference between the\nthree peptides is observed at the start of the experiment, which is\nnot the case for lipid mixing, raising the concern that the stapled\npeptide variants might be destabilizing the liposomes and causing\nleakage of SrB across the lipid membranes. Plain liposomes and liposomes\nmodified with 1% lipidated E3GY were tested for leakage\nbut did not show significant differences (Figure S8), indicating that the stapled peptides do not destabilize\nthe liposomal membranes.\n\nMembrane fusion occurs in multiple\nstages, starting with the docking\nof two membranes to create a membrane fusion interface, followed by\nhemifusion which results in the mixing of the outer lipid leaflets,\nand proceeding via the formation of a fusion pore to complete fusion\nof the two liposomes, meaning their contents are exchanged.27 Both lipid- and content-mixing experiments showed\nincreased fusiogenicity for the lipidated K3GW-3O peptide, with increased content mixing also observed for\nthe K3GW-3M variant. Differences in the\nlipid-mixing amount are obvious after 6 min, indicating that the rates\nof initial docking and outer leaflet mixing are comparable for the\nthree peptides. Because complete fusion of the liposomes, as judged\nby content mixing, is increased significantly for the K3GW-3O variant, the observed difference in lipid\nmixing is most likely caused by an increased mixing of the inner leaflet\nlipids. The increased coiled-coil binding strength observed via ITC,could\nexplain the increase in fusion except for the fact that K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M are\ndissimilar in their fusogenicity, yet they have a comparable Kd.\n\nThe K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M stapled peptides differ\nin their effects of entropy on coiled-coil binding and the strength\nof their membrane interactions, which are both increased for K3GW-3M. The Kd of coiled-coil formation is dependent on the association and dissociation\nrate constants, which show different behavior in temperature dependent\nstopped-flow experiments of coiled-coil peptides.44 The dissociation rate was shown to be more dependent on\ntemperature and therefore had a much larger entropic component then\nthe rate of association. The stapled peptide variants tested have\na decreased entropic binding component and should therefore also show\na lower rate of dissociation. At a membrane fusion interface, dissociation\nof the coiled-coil is most likely followed either by another peptide\nbinding event or by the insertion of peptide K into the lipid membrane.\nA decrease in the dissociation rate should therefore result in an\nincrease in the rate of fusion, although the total amount of fusion\nobserved is not expected to change.\n\nFor SNARE-mediated membrane\nfusion, it is known that multiple protein\ncomplexes are required to drive fusion of a single vesicle, and the\nlikelihood of fusion occurring is dependent on the number of protein\ncomplexes at the fusion interface.45,46 This cooperativity\nis likely also necessary for our coiled-coil based system, and any\ninteractions that influence the amount of coiled-coils that can be\ncoassembled around a fusion interface will influence the amount of\nfusion observed. In this case, both K3GW-3O and K3GW-3M show increased binding and lowered binding entropy and\ntherefore increased fusion via a lower dissociation rate. For K3GW-3M, this difference is less significant\nand is likely to be partially counteracted by the increased membrane\naffinity of the peptide. This is a competitive interaction in the\nformation of the coiled-coil complex, and an interaction which can\nprovide a pathway for dissipation of the free peptide after dissociation\nof the coiled coil.41 In this manner, the\ntotal number of peptide complexes that are formed around a membrane\nfusion interface is reduced, and no increase in membrane fusion is\nobserved. This reasoning can also be applied to homomeric peptide\ninteractions, which could provide a pathway for dissipation of the\nlipopeptide away from the fusion interface. CD titration was performed\nwith K3GW and the K3GW-3O and\nK3GW-3M analogues to test for homodimerization\n(Figure S9 and Table S5), but the dimerization constant was found to be comparable\nfor all variants and weak enough that this should not be considered\nan important part of the fusion mechanism. This mechanistic understanding\nderived from the observed differences between the two stapled peptide\nvariants will require further confirmation in different systems and\nexperiments.\n\nWe have employed a cysteine\nbisalkylation stapling technique to\ngenerate of a series of nine structurally isomeric \u03b1-helical\npeptides that can form a heterodimeric coiled-coil when mixed with\ntheir binding partner. CD and ITC experiments showed that both stapling\nlocation and choice of staple affected the properties of the resulting\npeptides and coiled-coil complexes, with the largest increase in structure,\nbinding, and stability observed for peptides stapled close to the\nC-terminus with ortho-xylene. Binding strength is\nincreased via a preorganization mechanism, which consists of a large\nreduction of the unfavored entropic binding component, combined with\na negative change in binding enthalpy. ortho- and meta-Xylene cross-linkers resulted in similar coiled-coil\nbinding strengths, although ortho-xylene reduced\nthe effect of entropy the most. This effect was true for all three\nstapling sites and is due to the smaller size of the ortho-xylene cross-linker. Although there may be some dependence on amino\nacid composition, we conclude that ortho-xylene is\nthe best cross-linker to stabilize helical peptides, despite meta-xylene being more widely employed to date.\n\nThe\neffect of stapling on peptide-membrane partitioning was determined\nand showed a 2-fold difference between stapled peptide variants, although\nno direct correlation to location or staple type could be made. Lipopeptides\nof K3GW-3M and K3GW-3O were prepared\nvia a novel on-resin stapling method. These peptides were tested in\nlipid- and content-mixing experiments, and large increases in fusogenicity\nfor the K3GW-3O variant were observed. K3GW-3M also showed significantly increased content\nmixing, but it exhibited a similar amount of lipid mixing to the parent\npeptide. We theorize that these differences in fusogenicity can be\nexplained via reduced dissociation; increasing coiled-coil interactions\nwithout increasing lipid membrane interactions allows accumulation\nof more coiled-coil pairs at the fusion interface and therefore increases\nmembrane fusion.\n\nAll peptides were\nsynthesized on solid phase using a CEM liberty blue automated, microwave-assisted,\npeptide synthesizer. Peptides were prepared on a 0.1 mmol scale using\nTentagel HL RAM resin with a loading of 0.39 mmol/g. Fmoc deprotection\nwas performed using 20% piperidine in DMF at 90 \u00b0C for 60 s.\nAmide coupling was achieved using 5 equiv of protected amino acid,\n5 equiv of DIC as the activator, and 5 equiv of Oxyma as the activator\nbase, heated at 95 \u00b0C for 240 s. Acetylation of the peptide N-terminus\nafter automated synthesis was performed using an excess of acetic\nanhydride and pyridine in DMF.\n\nLipidated peptides were made\non resin via the coupling of 2.5 equiv of N3-PEG4-COOH (see Supporting Information methods for synthesis\ndetails), with 2.5 equiv of HBTU, and 5 equiv of DIPEA in DMF for\n2 h at room temperature. After washing the resin with DMF, the azide\nwas reduced using 10 equiv of PME3 (1 M in toluene), with\n4:1 dioxane/water as solvent for 2.5 h. After the reaction was finished,\nthe resin was washed thoroughly with 4:1 dioxane/water, MeOH, and\nDMF. Lipidation was achieved using 2 equiv of cholesteryl hemisuccinate,\n2 equiv of HBTU, and 4 equiv of DIPEA in 1:1 DMF/DCM, and this lipidation\nstep was performed twice to achieve complete conversion. After the\nfinal coupling, the resin was washed with DMF, MeOH, and DCM and dried\nunder vacuum, and the peptide was cleaved using a 92.5:2.5:2.5:2.5\nmixture of TFA/TIPS/EDDT/water for 1 h, after which the peptide was\nprecipitated in cold diethyl ether, collected via centrifugation,\nand lyophilized.\n\nAll peptides were purified by HPLC on a Shimadzu\nsystem consisting\nof two KC-20AR pumps and an SPD-20A or SPD-M20A detector equipped\nwith a Kinetix Evo C18 column. Eluents consisted of 0.1% TFA in water\n(A) and 0.1% TFA in MeCN (B), with all peptides eluted using a gradient\nof 20\u201390% B over 35 min, with a flow rate of 12 mL/min. Collected\nfractions were checked for purity via LCMS, with the pure fractions\nbeing pooled and lyophilized. LC/MS spectra were recorded using a\nThermo Scientific TSQ quantum access MAX mass detector connected to\na Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system fitted with a 50 \u00d7\n4.6 mm Phenomenex Gemini 3 \u03bcm C18 column. LC/MS spectra of the\npurified peptides can be found in the Supporting Information.\n\nIntramolecular\ncross-linking was achieved\nby dissolving the peptide in a 1:1 mixture of MeCN/H2O\ncontaining 10 mM NH4HCO3 up to a peptide concentration\nof 500 \u03bcM. TCEP, 1 equiv, was added as a 10 mM stock solution,\nand the reaction was stirred for 1 h, followed by addition of 1.2\nequiv of the dibromoxylene cross-linker (50 mM in DMF) and reacted\nfor 3 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 5% acetic acid\nand purified using preparative HPLC. For the lipidated peptides, the\ncross-linking was performed on the solid phase. In short, cysteines\nprotected with Mtt were incorporated into the peptide, and after automated\nsynthesis these protecting groups were removed by incubating the resin\nwith 2% TFA, 3% TIS in DCM for 2 min, followed by washing the resin\nwith DCM twice. This was repeated until no more color appeared when\na small amount of the resin was mixed with TFA. Cross-linking was\nachieved by addition of 1.5 equiv of the cross-linker and 2.5 equiv\nof DIPEA in 1:1 DMF/TFE and incubating this reaction for 3 h. On-resin\nstapling was usually performed before lipidation.\n\nCD spectra were recorded\non a JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer fitted with a Peltier temperature\ncontroller. Unless otherwise specified, samples were measured at 20\n\u00b0C in a quartz cuvette with a 2 mm path length. Spectra were\nrecorded from 190 to 260 at 1 nm intervals, with a bandwidth of 1\nnm, with the final spectrum consisting of the average of 5 sequentially\nrecorded spectra. The mean residue molar ellipticity (\u03b8, deg\ncm2 dmol\u00b7res\u20131) was calculated according\nto eq 1:1with\n[\u03b8]obs representing\nthe observed ellipticity in mdeg, c being the peptide\nconcentration in mM, n being the number of peptide\nbonds, and l being the path length of the cuvette\nin cm. The fraction of the \u03b1-helical peptide could be calculated\nfrom the mean residue molar ellipticity using eq 2:2with the maximum theoretical mean residue\nellipticity, [\u03b8]max, defined as [\u03b8]max = [\u03b8]\u221e(n \u2013 x)/n for a helix with n residues and x being a number of amino\nacids assumed not to participate in helix formation (in this case\n3). [\u03b8]\u221e is defined as the theoretical helicity\nof an infinite \u03b1-helix and is temperature dependent, defined\nvia [\u03b8]\u221e = (\u221244,000 + 250T), with T being the temperature in \u00b0C. The\nminimal expected absorbance at 222 nm for a random coil is defined\nin [\u03b8]0, which is also temperature dependent via\nthe relationship [\u03b8]0 = 2220 \u2013 53T.\n\nFluorescence was\nmeasured in 96-well plates using a TECAN Infinite M1000 Pro microplate\nreader. Liposomes of the composition 2:1:1 DOPC/DOPE/cholesterol were\nprepared at a 10 mM concentration via extrusion in PBS buffer, using\nan Avanti mini extruder with 100 nm polycarbonate membranes. Titration\nseries of liposomes in PBS buffer were prepared with concentrations\nbetween 25 and 3750 \u03bcM, with the peptide concentration held\nconstant at 2.5 \u03bcM. Samples were prepared in 96-well plates,\nand after 60 min of incubation a fluorescence spectrum was taken between\n300 and 450 nm. The maximum fluorescence of each sample was plotted\nas a fold increase of the fluorescence of the peptide without liposomes\npresent and fitted against eq 3 to determine the partition constant:3where the normalized fluorescence, F, is dependent on the maximum fluorescence when all peptide\nis bound to the membrane Fmax, the molar\npartition coefficient Kp, the lipid concentration X, and the concentration of water which is assumed to be\nconstant at 55.3 M. Experimental data representing three separate\nexperiments was fitted to eq 3 using the least-squares method to yield the partition coefficient\nand the standard error of fitting.\n\nITC measurements were\nperformed on a Malvern MicroCal PEAQ-ITC automated calorimeter. In\na standard experiment, the measurement cell contained 200 \u03bcL\nof 10 \u03bcM peptide K and the syringe was filled with E3GY at 100 \u03bcM concentration, with both peptides dissolved in\nPBS. The syringe content was added in 21 injections of 1.9 \u03bcL\nat 120s intervals, except the first injection which was 0.5 \u03bcL.\nThe reference power was set at 2.0 \u03bccal/s, and experiments were\nperformed at 25 \u00b0C. The data was analyzed with the Microcal PEAQ-ITC\nanalysis software and fitted to a single binding site model to generate\nthe thermodynamic binding parameters. The experiment was repeated\non three separate occasions, and the experimental results with the\nlowest reduced \u03c72 value are represented in this paper.\n\nLiposomes with\nthe lipid composition 2:1:1 DOPC/DOPE/cholesterol were used at a 500\n\u03bcM concentration, where 1% of the lipids was substituted with\nthe respective lipopeptide. Lipid films were prepared via evaporation\nof lipid and lipopeptide stock solutions in 1:1 CHCl3/MeOH\nunder a stream of nitrogen, followed by high vacuum for at least 2\nh. The lipid films were rehydrated via vortex mixing with PBS buffer\nand sonication for 5 min at 55 \u00b0C in a Branson 2510 bath sonicator.\nThe liposomes were checked for size and polydispersity (PDI) via dynamic\nlight scattering (Malvern Zetaszier Nano S) and then sonicated for\na second time if the PDI was larger than 0.25. Lipid mixing was assayed\nvia the incorporation of 0.5% DOPE-NBD (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl))\nand 0.5% DOPE-LR (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)) in the lipid membranes\nof the CPK-containing liposomes. A volume of 100 \u03bcL of fluorescent\nCPK-containing liposomes was mixed with 100 \u03bcL of nonfluorescent\nCPE-decorated liposomes, and the emission of NBD at 530 nm was followed\nover time. Each experiment included a positive control consisting\nof liposomes at a 500 \u03bcM concentration and 0.25% of both DOPE-LR\nand DOPE-NBD, and a negative control where the fluorescent liposomes\nwere combined with liposomes without CPE. The standard deviation was\ncalculated on the average of four separate measurement samples, and\nthe experiment was repeated at least three times.\n\nContent mixing\nwas assayed via the incorporation of 10 mM sulforhodamine B in the\nhydration buffer of CPE-decorated liposomes. After sonication, the\nunincorporated rhodamine was removed using an Illustra NAP-25 size-exclusion\ncolumn. For each experiment, 100 \u03bcL of sulforhodamine-containing\nCPE-liposomes was mixed with 100 \u03bcL of CPK-containing liposomes,\nand the fluorescence of sulforhodamine followed over time at 585 nm.\nThe value was normalized via referencing a positive control consisting\nof liposomes containing 5 mM sulforhodamine B prepared in the same\nmanner and a negative control where the fluorescent CPE liposomes\nwere combined with plain liposomes. The standard deviation was calculated\non the average of four separate measurement samples, and the experiment\nwas repeated at least three times.\n\nChange in fluorescence was\nmeasured in 96-well plates using a TECAN\nInfinite M1000 Pro microplate reader. The percentage of lipid and\ncontent mixing was calculated using the following formula (eq 4):4where Ft is the fluorescence at time t and F0 and Fmax are the\nfluorescence of the negative and positive controls at the same time\npoint, respectively. Processing of fluorescence data and one-way ANOVA\nanalysis were performed in GraphPad Prism 8.1.1."}
