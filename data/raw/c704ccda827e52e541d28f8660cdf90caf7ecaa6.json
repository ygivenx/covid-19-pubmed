{"title": "A role for the Clostridium perfringens b2 toxin in bovine enterotoxaemia?", "body": "A role for the Clostridium perfringens b2 toxin in bovine enterotoxaemia?\n\nClostridium perfringens is a Gram positive sporulated anaerobe responsible for necrotic and haemorrhagic enteritis and enterotoxaemia in humans and in different animal species. This bacterial species can produce up to 17 different toxins, \u00aeve of which (the a, b, e, i toxins and the enterotoxin) are responsible for the tissue lesions and the death of the hosts (Daube, 1992; Songer, 1996; Petit et al., 1999) .\n\nBovine enterotoxaemia is characterised by a high case fatality rate, sudden deaths, lesions of necrotic and haemorrhagic enteritis of the small intestine and, most often, an absence of other clinical signs. Bovine enterotoxaemia occurs most frequently in beef cattle and is referred to as``Belgian Blue calf enterotoxaemia'', although other breeds can suffer of this syndrome Manteca et al., 2000) . The infectious aetiology of bovine enterotoxaemia has not been formally identi\u00aeed yet, but C. perfringens is often regarded as responsible (Popoff, 1989; Manteca and Daube, 1994; Songer, 1996) . A recent survey of more than 70 typical cases in Belgium con\u00aerms toxin type A C. perfringens as putative aetiology (Daube et al., 1996; Manteca et al., 2001) . However, if the a toxin is highly pathogenic for all species the reproduction of typical necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions has been performed only in chickens (Daube, 1992; Songer, 1996; Petit et al., 1999) .\n\nAnother toxin of C. perfringens was described a few years ago, and named b2 (Gibert et al., 1997) . b2 toxin is produced by C. perfringens isolated form piglets with haemorrhagic enteritis and from other animal species with, sometimes haemorrhagic, enteritis or diarrhoea (Herholz et al., 1999; Klaasen et al., 1999; Garmory et al., 2000; Gkiourtzidis et al., 2001) . Because of the similarity of the lesions observed in calves with enterotoxaemia (Manteca et al., 2000) and of those associated with the b2 toxin-producing C. perfringens isolates in piglets, the following study was done: (i) the collection of C. perfringens isolated from the bovine enterotoxaemia cases was re-examined by colony hybridisation for the presence of b2 toxin-encoding genes; (ii) b2-positive and b2-negative C. perfringens isolates were compared by ribotyping; and (iii) b2-positive and b2-negative C. perfringens isolates were compared in a ligated intestinal loop assay in one calf for the production of intestinal lesions.\n\nSeven hundred and fourteen C. perfringens isolated from 133 cases of enterotoxaemia (study population) and 386 isolated from a control population of 87 Belgian Blue calves were tested in a colony hybridisation assay with a gene probe for the b2 toxin. According to the numbers of C. perfringens tested per calf (2\u00b110), nine classes were de\u00aened in each population. Most isolates originated from the small intestine (Manteca et al., 2001) , but additional isolates from extra-intestinal organs were studied. All belonged to the toxin type A and one was also positive for the enterotoxin (Daube et al., 1996; Manteca et al., 2001) .\n\nFour C. perfringens, one urease-and toxin-negative C. sordellii, one C. bifermentans (Table 1) , all isolated from typical cases of enterotoxaemia (Manteca et al., 2001) , and the urease-and toxin-positive C. sordellii reference strain C582 (Pasteur Institute Collection, Paris, France) were tested in the ligated loop assay in one calf.\n\nThe b2 toxin probe was a 600 bp DNA fragment derived by a HindIII and EcoRI restriction of the recombinant plasmid pMRP109 carrying the gene coding for the b2 toxin from a porcine isolate of C. perfringens (Gibert et al., 1997) , kindly provided by Dr. M. Popoff from the Pasteur Institute, Paris. The probe was radioactively labelled using a random primed hexanucleotide labelling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The colony hybridisation assay was performed as previously described (Daube et al., 1996) .\n\nThe 16S rRNA probe was derived from the pBA2 recombinant plasmid carrying the genes coding for the rRNA of Bacillus subtilis (Iglesias et al., 1983) . Two DNA fragments of ca. 4.0 and 1.2 kb were generated by digestion of pBA2 with EcoRI restriction endonuclease. The larger DNA fragment, corresponding to the vector plasmid and to the 3 H end of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene, was autoligated (plasmid pCUR2). The 16S rRNA probe corresponds to the 1.1 kb insert of pCUR2 and was recovered after digestion of pCUR2 with HindIII EcoRI restriction endonucleases. The 16S rRNA probe was radioactively labelled using the random primed hexanucleotide labelling kit described. Total DNA of 13 b2-positive and 34 b2-negative C. perfringens isolated from 12 different calves with enterotoxaemia was extracted according to an adaptation in small volumes of the procedure described by Van Damme-Jongsten et al. (1989) and digested by HindIII restriction endonuclease. The restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis in agarose gel (0.6%) in Tris\u00b1acetate\u00b1EDTA (TAE) buffer 1\u00c2, for 16 h at 2 V/cm, and subsequently transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham) by southern blotting (Maniatis et al., 1982) . The \u00aelters were treated according to the instructions of the manufacturer and hybridised with the 16S rRNA probe using the same conditions as for the colony hybridisation assay (Daube et al., 1996) . The hybridisation pro\u00aeles were compared using Boolean analysis.\n\nThe sandwich ELISA assays for the a, b and e toxins were performed as previously described (Ginter et al., 1994 (Ginter et al., , 1996 . Brie\u00afy, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with monoclonal antibody to the a toxin (DY2F5), to the b toxin (DAN1, received from the Statens Veterinaere Serumlaboratorium, Copenhagen, Denmark), or to the e toxin (CK6G4). Toxin \u00aexation was revealed using peroxidase-conjugated speci\u00aec polyclonal immune sera produced in rabbits.\n\nOne healthy 2-week-old black and white calf originating from a farm with no record of vaccination against enterotoxaemia, and negative for Salmonella, intestinal parasites, rotavirus and coronavirus using routine detection methods, was anaesthetised with Xylazine 1 (0.1 ml/kg) and Gutajal 1 (500 ml)\u00b1Thiopental 1 (2 g) (1 ml/kg) prior to abdominal surgery. Twelve ligated loops of ca. 15 cm were created in the small intestine with interloop regions of ca. 10 cm. Eleven loops received 1 ml of pure or mixed cultures of the clostridial isolates and one loop received 1 ml of sterile broth.\n\nThe inocula were prepared by growing the bacteria overnight at 37 8C in Brain Heart Infusion broth with 0.5% thioglycollate (Manteca et al., 2001) to a cell concentration of 10 8 CFUs (colony forming units)/ml. An aliquot of each bacterial culture was transferred into dextrin-liver broths to a \u00aenal concentration of ca. 10 7 CFU/ml.\n\nThe calf was monitored overnight (body temperature, respiratory and heart rates) under anaesthesia and euthanised with Nembutal 1 (50 mg). Necropsy was performed immediately after euthanasia and each loop was sampled for bacterial isolation and counts, histopathology and ELISA assays for the a, b and e toxins. The lungs, liver and kidneys were also sampled for histopathology. Intestinal tissue sections were scored (0: absence of lesions; 1: presence of weak lesions; 2: presence of heavy lesions) for the haemorrhagic and necrotic aspects of the intestinal content and wall and for the in\u00afammatory response in the intestinal villi.\n\nFor bacterial analysis the content of each loop was inoculated onto Ana-Blood base agar plates, Ana-Blood base agar plates with polymyxin and kanamycin, and Ana-Blood base agar plates with cycloserin, using a Model D Spiral Systems plater (LED Techno), as previously described (Manteca et al., 2001) .\n\nThe percentage of calves with b2-positive C. perfringens amongst all calves (Pb2) and the percentage of b2-positive C. perfringens amongst all isolates (Cb2) were computed within each class (2\u00b110 isolates tested) and within either population of calves (study and control populations). Chi-square analyses were used to test the hypothesis that Pb2 and Cb2 were higher in the study population than in the control population. The degree of homogeneity for Pb2 and Cb2 across the nine classes was tested before combining evidence from all classes. The signi\u00aecance of the weighted average percentages was then tested by referring the Cochran's chi-square to a chi-square with 1 degree of freedom (Fleiss, 1973) .\n\nOf the 714 C. perfringens isolated from the study population, 218 (31%) tested positive with the b2 probe. Of the 386 C. perfringens isolated from the control population, 113 (29%) tested positive with the b2 probe. There was no relation between the hybridisation results and the site of isolation.\n\nAccording to the colony hybridisation results, 83 calves (62%) from the study population and 51 calves (59%) from the control population harboured at least one isolate positive with the b2 probe. Amongst calves with b2-positive isolates, the average of study calves (Pb2) was estimated at 57.46% (standard error: 4.27%) and was signi\u00aecantly, although slightly, higher than for control calves 0:05 < p < 0:01.\n\nAs 2\u00b110 C. perfringens were isolated from each calf, the proportion of positive colonies varied greatly ( Table 2 ). The numbers of calves with high proportion of b2-positive colonies (Cb2) tended to be higher in the study population (Table 2 and Fig. 1 ), but this was not statistically signi\u00aecant.\n\nTwelve ribotype pro\u00aeles were observed for the 47 C. perfringens which were typed (Table 3 and Fig. 2) . The 13 b2-positive isolates were present in \u00aeve of them and there was as much variability amongst the b2-positive as amongst the b2-negative C. perfringens. Ribotype pro\u00aeles could be heterogeneous amongst the b2-positive or the b2-negative C. perfringens isolated from the same calf (Table 3) .\n\nThe pathotypes of the C. perfringens isolates were con\u00aermed using the ELISA assays for toxins a, b and e, prior to the inoculation of the intestinal loops: two isolates (Cp1 and Cp4) produced high levels and one (Cp2) classical level of a toxin, whereas one isolate (Cp3) tested negative (Table 1 ). The inocula of the 11 loops were pure or mixed cultures of the different C. perfringens, C. sordellii and C. bifermentans isolates (Tables 4 and 5 ).\n\nThe calf was monitored overnight. During that time, the body temperature and the respiratory rate were normal. The heart rate was very high for 8 h (up to 160 beats/min) but was again normal (ca. 70 beats/min) during the following 10 h.\n\nAt necropsy weak lesions of congestion and infarcts were present in the control loop. The scores of the control loop were subtracted from the scores of the inoculated loops (Table 4) . Macroscopic haemorrhagic lesions of the intestinal wall were present in loops 2, 5, 11, (7) 1 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 4 (57) 7 (4) \u00b1 \u00b1 1 1 1 \u00b1 \u00b1 3 (75) 8 (7) 2 1 2 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 5 (71) 9 (3) 1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 1 (33) 10 (6) 2 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 1 3 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 6 (100) \n\nI a F a I: isolation from the intestine; L: isolation from the liver; S: isolation from the spleen. and 12. Dilatation by liquid accumulation was also observed in loop 6, and to some extent in loops 10 and 12. Macroscopic lesions of the intestinal content, when present, were necrosis and, in some loops, haemorrhages (Table 4 ). Microscopic lesions of the intestinal villi consisted in necrosis and in\u00aeltration of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells (Table 4 ). The lesion scores were highest in loop 5 inoculated with the b2-positive C. perfringens isolate (Cp1) and in loop 11 inoculated with both Cp1 and the C. sordellii reference strain (Cs2). High lesion scores were also observed in loop 2 inoculated with the toxin-negative C. sordellii (Cs1), in loop 3 inoculated with the C. bifermentans (Cb) and in loop 10 inoculated with both Cs1 and Cp2 (Table 4 ). In contrast loop 4 inoculated with Cs2 gave a low lesion score (Table 4 ).\n\nThe challenge clostridial species were recovered from all loops, with the exception of loop 4 from which endogenous C. perfringens, was recovered, as from the control loop 1 (Table 5) . A great variation was observed in the CFU per millilitre of intestinal content recovered from the loop inoculated with pure cultures. On the other hand, the variation was smaller for the loops inoculated with two strains. Enterococci and non-haemolytic E. coli were also isolated from all loops except loops 3 and 5.\n\nThe a toxin was detected in loops inoculated with any C. perfringens isolate positive in vitro (Cp1, Cp2, Cp4). The loops inoculated with sterile broth, C. sordellii (Cs1 and Cs2) or C. bifermentans strains and the C. perfringens isolate (Cp3) which was already negative in vitro gave negative results (Table 5) . Moreover, all loops gave negative results with the ELISA for the b and e toxins.\n\nNo macroscopic lesions were observed in internal organs. Histologically, the lungs and the kidneys were congested and evidence of centrolobular to panlobular hydropic to vacuolar degeneration was observed in the hepatic tissue.\n\nThe role of non-enterotoxigenic C. perfringens toxin type A in enteritis and enterotoxaemia in mammals is controversial (Daube, 1992; Songer, 1996; Petit et al., 1999) . Epidemiological data favour a role for instance in horses and cattle (Grif\u00aeths et al., 1998; Netherwood et al., 1998; Manteca et al., 2001) , and in vivo role of the a toxin has been proved in necrotic enteritis in poultry (Popoff, 1989; Daube, 1992; Songer, 1996) . The identi\u00aecation of b2-toxigenic C. perfringens isolated from several animal species with, sometimes necrotic and haemorrhagic, enteritis and enterotoxaemia revived the discussion (Gibert et al., 1997; Herholz et al., 1999; Klaasen et al., 1999; Garmory et al., 2000; Gkiourtzidis et al., 2001) .\n\nColony hybridisation con\u00aermed the existence of b2-positive C. perfringens in cattle (Garmory et al., 2000) , but brought no argument for its involvement in bovine enterotoxaemia since: (i) almost as many C. perfringens isolates and calves of both study and control populations are positive; and (ii) b2-positive C. perfringens are not isolated from 40% of the calves of the former population. The isolation of a b2-positive C. perfringens from the intestinal content thus does not con\u00aerm the clinical diagnosis of bovine enterotoxaemia, as the probability of this calf being enterotoxaemic is only 0.6. As previously stated and described (Manteca et al., 2001) , a clostridial cell count must still be performed.\n\nThe results of the ligated loop assay in one calf bring new evidence for the importance of b2 toxin since necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions developed in two of three loops inoculated with a b2-positive C. perfringens strain, and not, or not as much, in the other loops, including those inoculated with toxin-positive and toxin-negative C. sordellii (Table 4 ). However, this C. perfringens strain also produces high level of the a toxin and a synergistic action between these two toxins must also be considered.\n\nPrevious data suggested an anarchic multiplication of the C. perfringens population (10 6 \u00b110 10 CFU/ml of small intestinal content in the study population versus 10 3 \u00b110 7 CFU/ ml in the control population) and invasion of the small intestine (Manteca et al., 2001) . As a result of the multiplication of the C. perfringens population, there would be an increase of the production of the a and/or b2 toxins in the small intestine followed by their absorption through the gut wall and the production of necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions. This multiplication indeed affects many, if not all, a-positive and a/b2-positive clones of the C. perfringens population, as illustrated by the ribotyping results.\n\nTo prove an actual role of the b2 toxin in the bovine enterotoxaemia syndrome, in synergy with the a toxin or not, future experiments must: (i) compare the growth rates of the b2-negative and b2-positive strain; (ii) demonstrate, like for the a toxin, the actual production in vivo of the b2 toxin by ELISA or by immunocytochemistry; (iii) reproduce necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions of the bovine small intestinal wall and a sudden death syndrome with other C. perfringens isolates and their allelic mutants in the a and b2 toxinencoding genes.\n\nIn summary our results suggest in vivo synergistic role of the b2 and a toxins of C. perfringens in the production of necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions of the small intestine in the bovine enterotoxaemia syndrome. On the other hand, any role for the enterotoxin is de\u00aenitely ruled out. The enterotoxin is responsible for\u00afuid accumulation in the loops, but not for necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions."}
