{"title": "", "body": ", has rapidly spread in pigs in Southeast Asia. The affected countries include Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore. In eastern and northern Asia, South Korea and Russia were also reported to be affected (2) (Figure) . The epidemic affected not only large commercial farms but also the backyard industry, which created a serious problem for the global swine industry and for food safety. In February 2011, the Veterinary and Animal Breeding Agency in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, confi rmed an outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) (3) . Nearby neighbors, such as Japan, North Korea, Indonesia, and other Asia-Pacifi c countries, are also at risk.\n\nPRRS was fi rst reported in the United States in 1987. The disease causes reproductive failure during late-term gestation in sows and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages. In 2006, a new, highly pathogenic PRRS emerged, characterized by high fever (41\u00b0C-42\u00b0C), skin discoloration/ reddening, high incidence of illness (50%-100%), and high proportion of deaths (20%-100%) in pigs of all ages. This new PRRS has spread throughout the swine industry in China, resulting in the culling of an estimated 20 million pigs annually in 2006-2007 in China (4). PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\n\nPRRSV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that shows high rates of genetic diversity. In the genome of the novel highly pathogenic PRRSV mutant, 4 deletions (2 deletions in nonstructural protein 2, one deletion in the 5\u2032 untranslated region, and one deletion in the 3\u2032 untranslated region), and some other point mutations, have occurred, which were markedly different from those found in any other previous virus isolate.\n\nAfter a surveillance study of the epidemic and an analysis of >300 novel highly pathogenic PRRSVs were conducted, the highly pathogenic PRRSV from China was considered to have gradually evolved from CH-1a, a local PRRSV isolate. The evolutionary path could be traced through intermediate PRRSV strains (5) . Moreover, we found that highly pathogenic PRRSV has a further enlarged deletion in nonstructural protein 2.\n\nHighly pathogenic PRRSV fi rst emerged in China and Vietnam almost simultaneously in 2006, and the epidemic focus was in the area between southern China and northern Vietnam (6,7). Although no evidence has shown that the highly pathogenic PRRSV isolate from China or Vietnam has spread in other areas, highly pathogenic PRRS has spread throughout the Malaysian Peninsula to southern Russia.\n\nIn addition, all highly pathogenic PRRSV isolates share high sequence identity and have the same deletions as the highly pathogenic PRRSV isolated from China or Vietnam. PRRSV can spread through a variety of routes, including direct contact between pigs, droplet contact through nasal secretions, direct contact with saliva and feces, and indirect contact.\n\nPRRS has spread rapidly around the world through pig sales, semen, and airborne transmission, including from airline passengers who carry the virus on their clothing, shoes, or equipment while traveling (8). In the global market, any virus emerging in the highly pathogenic form is a threat. The risk of highly pathogenic PRRS spreading to other countries is increasing.

Although the Greco-Latin amalgam, Pseudoterranova, translates to \"false new earth,\" the generic name of the organism refers to the ship, the Terra Nova, which Robert Falcon Scott captained en route to Antarctica exactly 100 years ago in his ill-fated attempt to be the fi rst person to reach the South Pole.\n\nDuring the Antarctic summer of 1911-12, while Scott and 4 companions trudged toward the South Pole, the ship's surgeon, Edward Leicester Atkinson, who remained with the Terra Nova, dissected polar fi sh, birds, and sea mammals, looking for parasites. Atkinson found an unusual nematode in a shark, and in 1914, he, along with parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper of the London School of Tropical Medicine, commemorated the ship by conferring the name Terranova antarctica upon this newly discovered creature (2) .\n\nThe genus Pseudoterranova was established by Aleksei Mozgovoi in 1951 for a somewhat similar nematode obtained from a pygmy sperm whale. Pseudoterranova azarasi, the subject of the Etymologia, was originally described in 1942 as Porrocecum azarasi, but recent molecular work, as described by Arizono et al. (3) and Mattiucci and Nascetti (4) , showed that this nematode is part of a large species complex within Pseudoterranova. Thus, it has been transferred to this genus as part of the P. decipiens species complex.\n\nThe nomenclatural specifi cs are complex and arcane. However, in this centennial year of the Terra Nova expedition, we think it is worthwhile to remember the historic origins of these names. "}
