{"title": "MxA transcripts with distinct first exons and modulation of gene expression levels by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human bronchial epithelial cells", "body": "The interferon (IFN) system plays an important role in innate immunity against pathogens. When viral components are detected by pattern recognition receptors, infected cells produce type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type III (\u03bb) IFNs (Randall and Goodbourn 2008) . Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, including myxovirus resistance A (MxA), also known as the myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1, IFN-inducible protein p78 (mouse) (MX1) gene. Following Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00251-012-0663-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. IFN-induced expression, MxA is thought to form oligomeric rings around the nucleocapsid structures of viruses, thereby inhibiting their transcriptional and replicative functions (Haller and Kochs 2011) .\n\nThe promoter of the human MxA transcript in the original report contains two IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), ISRE1 and ISRE2, near the transcription start site, and both are involved in IFN responsiveness (Ronni et al. 1998 ). The IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex binds to the most proximal ISRE1 and the second ISRE2. ISRE1 is essential for MxA promoter activation, whereas ISRE2 has an enhancing effect in the presence of activated ISRE1 (Ronni et al. 1998) . IFN regulatory factor 3 can only bind to ISRE2 for enhancing promoter activation (Holzinger et al. 2007 ). Around ISRE2, there are two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at nucleotide positions \u221288 and \u2212123, which confer differences in the promoter activity and binding affinity to nuclear proteins (Hijikata et al. 2001; Ching et al. 2010) . Promoter SNPs of MxA are reportedly associated with diseases, including hepatitis C (Hijikata et al. 2000; Hijikata et al. 2001) , hepatitis B (Peng et al. 2007) , multiple sclerosis (Furuyama et al. 2006) , and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Torisu et al. 2004) . We previously reported the association of MxA promoter SNP with the severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; Hamano et al. 2005) , and Ching et al. (2010) reported its association with susceptibility to SARS in a larger case-control study. However, the expression levels of MxA have been analyzed only in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or liver cells (Fernandez-Arcas et al. 2004; Kong et al. 2007; Abe et al. 2011; McGilvray et al. 2012) .\n\nBecause MxA has a pivotal role in host defense against not only SARS coronavirus but also other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus (Haller and Kochs 2011) , it is important to characterize the expression profile of MxA in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, a site for replication of many respiratory viruses. In addition, a new transcript variant with alternative 5\u2032 untranslated exons starting 5.5 kb upstream of the original exon 1 has recently been registered in the public database (NM_001144925.1). In the present study, we analyzed the expression patterns of MxA transcripts with distinct first exons. We further investigated the possible effects of their 5\u2032 SNPs on gene expression levels in a panel of primary cultured HBE cells with different genotypes.\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (formerly, International Medical Center of Japan). Primary cultured HBE cells were obtained from the cancer-free bronchi of surgically resected lungs after obtaining written informed consent from the individuals concerned, all of whom were Japanese. HBE cells (n038) were isolated and cultured as described previously (Gray et al. 1996) and used after three-five passages in this study. In brief, HBE cells were seeded at a density of 5\u00d710 5 /well onto collagen-coated six-well Transwell plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) for 24 h. Thereafter, HBE cells (n03) were stimulated with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\u03b1 (PeproTech EC Ltd., London W6 8LL, UK), 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\u03b2 (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA, USA), 100 \u03bcg/ml polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C); Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA], 10 ng/ml IFN-\u03b3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 (R&D Systems), 20 \u03bcg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich), 10 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1-defensin 1 (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan), 10 \u03bcg/ml \u03b2-defensin 1 (Peptide Institute Inc.), and 10 \u03bcg/ml \u03b2-defensin 2 (Peptide Institute Inc.) for 24 h and then harvested. Unstimulated HBE cells (n038) and those stimulated with 100 \u03bcg/ml poly(I:C) for 24 h (n0 29) or with 1,000 IU/ml IFN-\u03b2 for 12 h (n09) were harvested, and gene expression levels were then analyzed. To assess time-dependent changes in mRNA expression, BEAS-2B cells (ATCC number CRL-9609) were stimulated with 100 \u03bcg/ml poly(I:C) for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h.\n\nWe designated the MxA transcript originally reported by Horisberger et al. (1990) (NM_002462. 3) as the T1 transcript and the new transcript variant in the public database (NM_001144925.1) as the T0 transcript. Distinct exons used in the T0 transcript are shown as exons 0a, 0b, and 0c ( Fig. 1) . Translational start codons of both the T1 and T0 transcripts originate from exon 5, indicating that exons 0a-0c and exons 1-4 are all 5\u2032 untranslated exons.\n\nTotal RNA of the cells was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany). Human Total RNA Master panel II (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to investigate gene expression in various tissue types. Most of the tissue RNA in this panel consisted of pooled RNA from two or more donors, and their genotypes were not available. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to RT with random nonamers using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MxA mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and CFX96 (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Sense and antisense primers were located in exons 0b and 0c (5\u2032-CCAGAGCAACT-CCACACCGGGTGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTATGGTTCCAATC CAGGTGATC-3\u2032) for the T0 transcript and exons 1 and 2 (5\u2032-GCACTGCGCAGGGACCG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGG-TGAG-CAGGTGGGCGGCA-3\u2032) for the T1 transcript. PCR conditions consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95\u00b0C and annealing and extension for 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Specific target amplification was confirmed by a single peak in the dissociation curve. The mRNA copy numbers between different transcripts were compared using the absolute quantification method (Leong et al. 2007 ). RT-PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), and their copy numbers were calculated from the DNA concentration determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The standard curve was generated with a serial fivefold dilution of each RT-PCR product, and the linear dependence of the threshold cycles was confirmed from the template concentrations. We used the \u03b2-actin gene (primers listed in Online Resource 1) to normalize the expression of MxA for calculating the relative amounts of mRNA of each transcript. The TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Hs00182073_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) that amplifies exons 16-17 of MxA was used with TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems) in the StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), and the relative amount of total transcripts, indicating the overall expression of MxA, was calculated using the standard curve method with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control.\n\nRapid amplification of 5\u2032 cDNA end RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5\u2032 cDNA end (5\u2032 RACE) was performed using total RNA from IFN-\u03b2stimulated HBE cells to determine the transcription start site of T0 using the First-Choice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Gene-specific primers are listed in Online Resource 1. PCR products were sequenced with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\nScreening and genotyping of polymorphisms in the 5\u2032 region Genomic DNA was extracted from HBE cells (n038) using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The 5\u2032 upstream region of the transcription start site for the T0 transcript was amplified with two overlapping PCR products, and the amplified products were sequenced using appropriate inner primers. Three SNPs, \u2212123 C/A (rs17000900), \u221288 G/T (rs2071430), and +20 C/A (rs464138), two in the promoter and one in exon 1 of the T1 transcript, were genotyped by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods (Hamano et al. 2005) , with Pst I (Takara Bio) for rs17000900, Hha I (Takara Bio) for rs2071430, and Bpm I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for rs464138. The primers are listed in Online Resource 1. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between promoter SNPs was analyzed using Haploview (v. 4.2) (Barrett et al. 2005 ).\n\nAll data were expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). To assess the relationship between the number of single alleles of \u2212123 C/A, \u221288 G/T, and +20 C/A SNPs and expression levels of the transcript variants, a simple linear regression model was applied (JMP, version 9.0.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A multiple linear regression model was also applied to assess the combined effects of these SNPs on expression of the T1 transcript. The numbers of alleles of the three abovementioned SNPs were incorporated in the model as explanatory variables. Correlations of the total amount of the MxA transcripts with expression levels of the T0 and T1 transcripts were further analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThe originally reported MxA transcript, T1, and a recently registered transcript variant, T0, were both successfully Fig. 1 Alternate splicing of 5\u2032 exons in MxA. The 5\u2032 genomic structure of MxA and nucleotide sequences around the transcription start sites of the T0 and T1 transcripts are shown. White boxes represent the untranslated mRNA sequence, and black boxes represent the translated sequence. Potential ISREs are double underlined, NF-\u03baB binding site is underlined, and promoter and exon 1 SNPs are boxed. The transcription start site (Horisberger et al. 1990 ) and nucleotide positions shown in the T1 transcript are displayed in accordance with MxA promoter analysis by Ronni et al. (1998) amplified by RT-PCR from various human tissues (Fig. 2) . Expression of the T1 transcript was predominant in the tissues examined, including the lung and trachea, whereas expression of the T0 transcript was inconspicuous, except in the testis and adrenal gland.\n\nInduction patterns of MxA transcripts in HBE cells incubated with type I IFNs and other stimuli MxA transcripts, T0 and T1, were both detected in the unstimulated primary cultured HBE cells (n03), and their expression was markedly induced by type I IFNs and poly(I: C), although induction of the T1 transcript was much stronger than that of the T0 transcript (Fig. 3) . IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and \u03b1-defensin 1 also induced expression of the T1 transcript to a lesser extent, whereas this increase was not observed in the T0 transcript.\n\nGenomic structure and genetic polymorphisms in the 5\u2032 upstream regions of MxA transcripts with distinct first exons Because the transcript variant T0 with alternatively spliced exons was moderately induced by type I IFNs, 5\u2032 RACE was performed to determine the 5\u2032 end of exon 0a, the transcription start site of T0, in IFN-\u03b2-stimulated HBE cells (Fig. 1) . A putative ISRE motif and a possible binding site for NF-\u03baB were revealed in the 5\u2032 upstream region of the T0 transcript (Fig. 1) . The nearly full-length transcript T0 was amplified with the sense primer in exon 0c and the antisense primer in the last exon 17; however, no alternatively spliced exon was observed in the protein-coding region (data not shown). Although the transcript variant that skips untranslated exons 2 and 4 has also been registered in the public database (NM_001178046.1), its expression level was very low in the HBE cells (data not shown).\n\nSequence analysis of the 5\u2032 upstream region of the T0 transcript using our DNA samples identified genomic variations, \u221277 C/G SNP (rs457274) near the putative ISRE motif (Fig. 1) , \u2212326 deletion/insertion polymorphism (rs60467231), and \u2212504 A/G SNP (rs12483338). Three other SNPs, \u2212123 C/ A (rs17000900), \u221288 G/T (rs2071430), and +20 C/A (rs464138), near the 5\u2032 end of the T1 transcript were also detected (Fig. 1) . As shown in Online Resource 2, \u221277 C/G SNP of the T0 transcript and the three SNPs near the 5\u2032 end of the T1 transcript were all in strong LD with each other (D\u2032> 0.8, r 2 >0.4).\n\nDifferences in expression levels of MxA among SNP genotypes Next, the mRNA expression levels of the T0 and T1 transcripts were analyzed in HBE cells with different genotypes. The expression of the T1 transcript assessed by real-time RT-PCR was 2.3-fold higher than that of the T0 transcript under the unstimulated condition (n038). Baseline expression of the T1 transcript was significantly higher in proportion to the Relative amount of mRNA (n03) were stimulated with IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, poly (I:C), IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, LPS, \u03b1-defensin 1, \u03b2-defensin 1, and \u03b2-defensin 2 for 24 h and then harvested. Expression levels of the T0 and T1 transcripts were compared with those of unstimulated cells by real-time RT-PCR. Fold inductions are shown as the mean\u00b1SEM. The genotypes of the promoter SNPs were as follows: sample #1, \u221277 SNP (rs457274) C/G, \u2212123 SNP (rs17000900) C/A, \u221288 SNP (rs2071430) G/T, and +20 SNP (rs464138) C/A; sample #2, \u221277 C/C, \u2212123 C/A, \u221288 T/T, and +20 A/A and; sample #3, \u221277 C/G, \u2212123 C/C, \u221288 G/G, and +20 C/A number of A alleles of \u2212123 C/A SNP, T alleles of \u221288 G/T SNP, and A alleles of +20 C/A SNP carried by HBE cells according to a simple regression analysis (p00.013, p0 0.0035, and p<0.0001, respectively) (Fig. 4b) . Multiple regression analysis showed that the association of +20 C/A SNP remained significant (p00.016), whereas the association of \u2212123 C/A and \u221288 G/T SNPs was insignificant (p00.67 and p00.78, respectively). In contrast, baseline expression of the T0 transcript was slightly higher in proportion to the number of C alleles of \u221277 C/G SNP; however, this increase was not statistically significant (p00.086) (Fig. 4a) .\n\nWhen the relative expression of the total MxA transcripts was compared with expression of the T1 and T0 transcripts under the unstimulated condition, the overall expression of MxA strongly correlated with expression of the T1 transcript (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; rs00.759), whereas it weakly correlated with expression of the T0 transcript (rs00.388). The total expression of MxA was significantly higher in proportion to the number of \u2212123 A, \u221288 T, and +20 A alleles (p00.0004, p<0.0001, and p< 0.0001, respectively), which was similar to the linear relationship between the T1 transcript and number of alleles shown above.\n\nWhen immortalized HBE cell line BEAS-2B was stimulated with poly(I:C), time-course analysis revealed that expression of the T0 transcript was the highest after 24 h, whereas that of the T1 transcript was the highest after 6-12 h of incubation (Online Resource 3). We therefore investigated the expression of T0 and T1 transcripts in HBE cells (n029) stimulated with poly(I:C) for 24 h. The expression of the T0 transcript increased eightfold, whereas that of the T1 transcript increased 870-fold. Poly(I:C)-induced expression of both transcripts was not associated with either allele of the four SNPs (Fig. 5a, b) . When HBE cells (n09) were stimulated with IFN-\u03b2 for 12 h, the T0 transcript was induced eightfold, and the T1 transcript was induced 640fold. IFN-\u03b2-induced expression of the transcripts did not vary among genotypes (data not shown).\n\nIn this study, we investigated the expression profile of MxA by analyzing expression of the original transcript T1 and the transcript variant T0 in primary cultured HBE cells. According to our absolute quantification method using real-time RT-PCR, the amount of the T0 transcript was approximately half of that of the T1 transcript at the baseline level. Although expression of the T0 transcript was also induced by type I IFNs and poly(I:C) and its 5\u2032 proximal region has a potential ISRE motif, IFN-\u03b2 and poly(I:C) inducibility of the T1 transcript was at least 100-fold higher than that of the Fig. 4 Differences in the baseline expression of transcript variants among the genotypes of the promoter and exon 1 SNPs in HBE cells. Expression of a T0 and b T1 transcripts under the unstimulated condition in HBE cells with each genotype of \u221277 C/G SNP for the T0 transcript (C/C, n08; C/G, n018; G/G, n012), of \u2212123 C/A SNP (A/A, n02; A/C, n018; C/C, n018), of \u221288 G/T SNP (T/T, n03; G/T, n019; G/G, n016), and of +20 C/A SNP (A/A, n05; A/C, n022; C/C, n011) for the T1 transcript is shown. The relative amounts of mRNA of each transcript compared with that of the T0 transcript in GG cells without poly(I:C) stimulation are shown as mean\u00b1SEM. Possible associations between the number of alleles and the amount of the corresponding transcripts were assessed by a simple regression model respectively (p00.086 for the number of \u221277 C alleles, p00.013 for \u2212123 A alleles, p00.0035 for \u221288 T alleles, and p<0.0001 for +20 A alleles) T0 transcript. This observation implies that MxA response to viral infection of respiratory cells is mostly controlled by the expression of the T1 transcript.\n\nRemarkably increased levels of the T1 transcript after stimulation with type I IFNs or an IFN-inducing agent, poly(I:C), were consistent with the general consensus that the induction of MxA requires type I or type III IFN signaling (Haller and Kochs 2011) . However, levels of the T1 transcript were also elevated in HBE cells by other physiological stimuli. Moderate elevation of levels of the T1 transcript in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 may be mediated by the secondary induction of type I or type III IFNs. Although Mahanonda et al. (2012) demonstrated the induction of MxA by \u03b1-defensin in primary human gingival epithelial cells, the mechanism by which the T1 transcript was upregulated by \u03b1-defensin remains unknown. These observations support the idea that the T1 transcript plays a major role in airway diseases.\n\nWe also analyzed the expression of T0 transcript with alternative 5\u2032 untranslated exons. Alternative promoter usage is now recognized as a common mechanism in the transcriptional regulation of mammalian genes (Davuluri et al. 2008 ). Among IFN-stimulated genes, ADAR1 was shown to have alternative promoters (George and Samuel 1999) : one promoter contributes to constitutive expression and the other to inducible expression. To our knowledge, no IFN-stimulated genes other than MxA, whose antiviral function is well known (Sadler and Williams 2008) , have been reported to possess two IFN-inducible transcripts with distinct first exons. The molecular mechanism for tissue specificity of these transcripts is unknown; however, of note, the promoter of the T0 transcript contains the putative steroidogenic factor-1 binding site (position \u2212636 to \u2212644) thought to be important to testis-and adrenal gland-specific gene expression (Schimmer and White 2010) . A study of the expression profiles of MxA in various organs would be interesting.\n\nAlthough IFN-mediated upregulation of the T0 transcript was moderate in contrast to that of the T1 transcript, baseline levels of the T0 transcript were not negligible in HBE cells. It is thus conceivable that the T0 transcript plays a minor but independent role in the human airway. Furthermore, considering the difference between the time course of mRNA expression of the T0 and T1 transcripts after poly(I:C) stimulation, it is likely that other factors further modulate their induction levels. Because some reports (Aebi et al. 1989; Goetschy et al. 1989; Prescott et al. 2005) indicate the presence of IFN-independent induction of MxA in contrast to the results of Holzinger et al. (2007) , it would be worth investigating whether the T0 transcript can be induced through an IFN-independent signaling system in viral infection.\n\nWe observed the regulatory effects of \u2212123, \u221288, and +20 SNPs on mRNA levels of the T1 transcript in HBE cells for the T1 transcript is shown. The relative amounts of mRNA of each transcript compared with that of the T0 transcript in GG cells without poly(I:C) stimulation are shown as mean\u00b1SEM. Possible associations were assessed by a simple regression model (p00.647 for the number of \u221277 C alleles, p00.662 for \u2212123 A alleles, p00.539 for \u221288 T alleles, and p00.331 for +20 A alleles) under the unstimulated condition. When we evaluated the overall expression of the MxA transcripts by real-time RT-PCR, it was found to be closely correlated with levels of the T1 transcript, suggesting that individual variation of the total expression of MxA is mainly explained by the T1 transcript. Indeed overall levels of MxA as well as expression of the T1 transcript were strongly associated with these three SNPs at baseline levels. It has been repeatedly reported that the minor A allele of \u2212123 SNP and the minor T allele of \u221288 SNP, which are in strong LD, were associated with the overall transcriptional activity of the gene (Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004 ). Expression of MxA was associated with \u221288 G/T SNP when PBMC cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b12 for 12 h (Fernandez-Arcas et al. 2004 ). In one study (Furuyama et al. 2006) , the results of a luciferase reporter assay suggested that \u2212123 SNP contributed to basal expression levels of MxA, whereas \u221288 SNP contributed to the induction of expression by IFNs. Ching et al. (2010) further showed that the \u2212123A allele had a stronger binding affinity to nuclear proteins from unstimulated cells and that the \u221288 T allele preferentially bound to the protein after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation. In our study using HBE cells, \u2212123, \u221288, and +20 SNPs were all associated with baseline expression of the T1 transcript, and according to a multiple regression analysis, among the three SNPs, +20 C/A SNP was still associated with baseline expression of the T1 transcript. This finding may be attributed to the difference in cell type; however, extensive investigation is required to determine the possible effect of +20 SNP or other unknown functional polymorphisms in strong LD. Recently, Tran Thi Duc et al. (2012) reported that three SNPs (\u2212309 C/G, \u2212101 G/A, and +20 C/A) also contributed to the promoter activity in combination with well-known effects of \u2212123 and \u221288 SNPs. We could not examine \u2212309 and \u2212101 SNPs in our samples because \u2212309 C/G and \u2212101 G/A SNPs were detected only in the African population and their minor allele frequencies were relatively low .\n\nUnder the poly(I:C)-stimulated condition, the +20 SNP also tended to be associated with expression of the T1 transcript in our study; however, this tendency was not statistically significant. When HBE cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b2 for 12 h, the same three SNPs were not associated with the expression level. These findings may conflict with the in vitro effects of these 5\u2032 SNPs on the IFN-inducible promoter activity previously assessed by a luciferase reporter system (Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004; Tran Thi Duc et al. 2012) . In our study, however, the mRNA induced by poly (I:C), the dsRNA analog to mimic viral infection, was directly assessed in primary cultured HBE cells, which implies that individual variance of relevant factors such as toll-like receptor 3 and subsequent IFN signaling pathways might have affected the mRNA levels in the IFN-stimulated condition and have masked the independent effects of these promoter SNPs of the MxA gene.\n\nWe previously reported that the promoter \u221288 SNP was associated with severity of SARS in the Vietnamese population (Hamano et al. 2005) , and the promoter \u2212123 SNP was associated with SARS in the Chinese population (Ching et al. 2010 ). According to Chen and Subbarao (2007) , IFN induction is completely suppressed in SARS coronavirusinfected cells. Our ex vivo findings that these regulatory SNPs were mainly involved in baseline expression of the T1 transcript support the results of these disease association studies. However, we could not show significant difference in the regulatory effects between \u221288 and \u2212123 SNPs, possibly because of strong LD between these two SNPs in the Japanese population (r 2 00.83) compared with moderate LD in the Chinese population (r 2 00.39) (Ching et al. 2010) .\n\nIn conclusion, we characterized the expression profile of the previously known transcript and the transcript variant of MxA and demonstrated a significant effect of its 5\u2032 SNPs on basal expression of the overall transcripts in HBE cells. Our findings may lead to an improved understanding of the association of MxA SNPs with susceptibility to respiratory viral infections."}
