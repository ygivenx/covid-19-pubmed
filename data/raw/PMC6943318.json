{"title": "Phenobarbital-induced anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome in a\ncat", "body": "The patient was a two-year-old, male, castrated, Russian Blue cat, and was admitted for\nemergency care because of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (four times a day). On the day of\nadmission, physical and neurological examinations were performed, and significant findings\nrelated to the clinical symptoms were not found. In addition, there were no specific findings\non complete blood count (CBC). Serum chemistry analysis yielded values within normal range,\nexcept for elevated glucose (239 mg/dl; reference range, 60\u2013130\nmg/dl) and creatine kinase (CK; 373 U/l; reference range,\n0\u2013314 U/l). All electrolyte levels were also within normal range. Serum\namyloid A (SAA) was high at 17.3 mg/l (reference range, 0\u20135\nmg/l) and no abnormalities were found in the coagulation test and thyroid\nfunction test. Feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies (IDEXX\nLaboratories, Markham, Ontario), and feline parvo virus kit (BioNote Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Korea)\nwere negative. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging did not yield any specific findings\nrelated to the clinical symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology tests were normal, and\ninfectious agents (Bartonella spp., Cryptococcus spp., feline Coronavirus, Toxoplasma\ngondii) were excluded using IDEXX Feline Neurologic RealPCR Panel. Through the\nprocess of these clinical examinations and laboratory tests, the patient was diagnosed with\nidiopathic epilepsy. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg; Samjin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was\ninfused intravenously as an emergency medicine, and phenobarbital (Hana Pharm. Co., Ltd.,\nSeoul, Korea) was loaded with 15 mg/kg (divided into three times) intravenous injection.\nEpileptic seizures were stopped and phenobarbital was prescribed 2.5 mg/kg two times daily per\noral for 2 weeks.\n\nAfter 8 days of phenobarbital use, no seizure symptoms were observed. Nevertheless, the\npatient was admitted into hospital due to high fever and lethargy. The body temperature at the\ntime of admission was 40.1\u00b0C (reference range, 37.4\u201339.2\u00b0C). There was no specific finding on\nCBC, and no abnormal findings were found in serum chemistry analysis. SAA reached a high of\n179 mg/l (reference range, 0\u20135 mg/l) and a small number of\nD\u00f6hle bodies in the white blood cells were observed on blood smear evaluation. Abdominal\nultrasonography showed splenomegaly and enlargement of the abdominal (colic; 1.14 \u00d7 0.69 mm,\nileocecal; 0.85 \u00d7 0.47 mm, pancreaticoduodenal; 11.37 \u00d7 6.98 mm) lymph nodes. Fine needle\naspiration (FNA) was performed under ultrasound guidance, and a provisional diagnosis of\nreactive lymphadenopathy was made (Fig. 1). Also, we could not find any evidence of infection or tumor by history taking,\nphysical examination, blood analysis, and imaging. Although the serum concentration of\nphenobarbital was not measured at this time, through an evaluation of the clinical course, a\ndiagnosis was made of hypersensitivity due to phenobarbital, the prescribed anticonvulsant\ndrug.\n\nSubsequently, we prescribed new medications for the patient. Phenobarbital was replaced with\nlevetiracetam (Keppra; 30 mg/kg two times daily per oral; UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium), and\nzonisamide (Excegran; 5 mg/kg two times daily per oral; Dainippon-Sumitomo, Osaka, Japan), and\nthe patient was hospitalized for continuous monitoring (Table 1). Four days after hospitalization, the body temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, SAA was 112\nmg/l, and serum concentration of phenobarbital was 17.7\n\u00b5g/ml (therapeutic range, 15\u201345\n\u00b5g/ml). The patient was deemed stabilized with the changed\nmedications, and discharged. Five days after discharge, the body temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, SAA\nwas \u22645 mg/l, and serum concentration of phenobarbital was 5\n\u00b5g/ml or less. Sixteen days after discharge, the body\ntemperature was measured at 37.5\u00b0C, and SAA was \u22645 mg/l. On abdominal\nultrasound, multiple small hypo-echoic (honeycomb-like) nodules were observed in the spleen.\nThe FNA test was performed, and small lymphocytes more than 50% of total lymphocytes were\nfound. Therefore, reactive lymphadenopathy was diagnosed, and we prescribed prednisolone\n(Solondo; 1 mg/kg two times daily per oral for 7 days; Yuhan, Seoul, Korea). Twenty three days\nafter discharge (7 days after last visit), the body temperature was measured at 38.5\u00b0C, and\nSAA was \u22645 mg/l. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that the size of the lymph\nnodes had decreased and the splenic honeycomb-like nodules had disappeared. Therefore,\nprednisolone was tapered to 0.5 mg/kg and stopped after 7 days. Forty three days after\ndischarge (21 days after last visit), the body temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, and SAA was \u22645\nmg/l. In addition, the patient was asymptomatic, and abdominal lymph nodes\nwere normal.\n\nAnticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a delayed adverse drug reaction associated\nwith the use of aromatic anticonvulsant drugs [4, 5, 7]. It is mainly\ncaused by drugs such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Clinical symptoms such as\nhyperthermia, skin redness, and lethargy appear from the 1st to 12th weeks after starting\ntreatment. In particular, lymphadenopathy is a common symptom that might be misdiagnosed as an\ninfection or tumor [3]. AHS is considered to be the\nresult of an excessive immune response, however, the exact mechanism is not clear.\n\nCase reports of AHS in cats have been previously published. Baho et al.\nreported that a 4-year-old female shorthair cat had lymph node enlargement after four days of\nphenobarbital administration. Subsequently, the medication was changed from phenobarbital to\nlevetiracetam, and the size of the lymph nodes were decreased after 10 days [1]. In another report, lymph node enlargement was observed\nafter four weeks of phenobarbital administration in a 2-year-old female shorthair cat.\nPhenobarbital was replaced with levetiracetam, and no lymph node enlargement was observed\nafter 10 days [8]. Although mild symptoms of AHS can be\nself-limiting, AHS in dogs or cats should be monitored carefully [1, 7].\n\nIn the current report, the serum level of phenobarbital was correlated with SAA, which is a\ntype of acute phase protein elevated by inflammatory stimuli [6, 11]. On the first day of hospitalization,\nSAA was 179 mg/l and phenobarbital was discontinued. Serum phenobarbital\nconcentration was 17.7 \u00b5g/ml four days after drug\ndiscontinuation, and SAA was 112 mg/l. Serum phenobarbital and SAA\nconcentration was \u22645 and 5 mg/l, respectively, on the 10th day of drug\ndiscontinuation, and no clinical signs such as hyperthermia were documented. SAA decreased as\nthe serum phenobarbital concentration decreased, and this was correlated with an improvement\nin clinical symptoms.\n\nThe patient in this case was diagnosed with AHS through a process of elimination, and\nfollowing a thorough assessment of clinical symptoms, blood analysis, imaging, and FNA,\nalthough this case did not show generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy as pervious reports of\nfeline AHS [1, 4].\nThere were two limitations in this case. One limitation was that we were not able to carry out\nthe definitive exclusion of lymphoma via PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement, flow\ncytometry, or biopsy-based histopathologic examination [2, 9]. The FNA test, however, has a high\ndiagnostic accuracy (90% for dogs, and 70% for cats) in the diagnosis of lymphoma [10]. Another limitation was that we did not rule out\npancreatitis through evaluating serum concentration of amylase and lipase, and pancreatic\nlipase immunoreactivity. However, lethargy and fever improved as the serum concentration of\nphenobarbital decreased. In addition, we did not find any obvious change in pancreas by\nultrasonography. We report here a case of phenobarbital-induced AHS which has been rarely\nreported in veterinary medicine, and this report could serve as a valuable reference for the\ndiagnosis and treatment of feline AHS using serum SAA and anticonvulsant concentrations."}
