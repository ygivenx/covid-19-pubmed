{"title": "Molecular detection and point-of-care testing in Ebola virus disease and\nother threats: a new global public health framework to stop outbreaks", "body": "This special report builds on and expands the knowledge base comprising: established\nprinciples of needs assessment (Box 1)\n[1] that can be used to create a logic web for\nfuture planning [2]; use of the critical path\nmethod to assess the validity of specifications for diagnostics, such as those published\nrecently for Ebola virus disease (\u2018Ebola\u2019) by the WHO (Table\n1)\n[3,4]; the theory of the Spatial Care\nPathTM (SCP), described recently by Kost et al. [5,6]; the pivotal advantages of\npoint-of-care testing (POCT) for diagnosis, triage, monitoring, recovery, derisking and\nstopping outbreaks; and a real sense of urgency, as more highly infectious disease outbreaks\nemerge to threaten the world.\n\nWe extrapolate from stop-gap emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for Ebola and middle east\nrespiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) detection issued by the FDA in the USA onward to\nfuture sustainable POC molecular diagnostics that could be used for facilitated-access\nself-testing point of care (\u2018FAST POCTM\u2019), a new solution for enhancing\nresilience [6]. This community-based strategy\nfills gaps needed in order for local population clusters of people to respond to both\nexternal and internal threats from old, new and often unpredictable, infectious diseases\n(Box 2).\n\nOne of the greatest victories in global health, between 1796 and 1979, smallpox was\neradicated through worldwide vaccination, mostly following World War II, because in nature\nvariola infected only humans. With zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola and MERS-CoV, animals\nprovide a reservoir from which the viruses can leap to humans, for the most part defeating\nattempts at eradication and upscaling perpetual need for surveillance, prevention and\nimportantly, early detection to prevent the spread of outbreaks.\n\nThe Ebola crisis demonstrated the intrinsic value of testing at points of need, such as in\ndiagnostic centers (Figure 1). In order to assure\ntimely patient results during infectious disease crises, diagnostic centers, even mobile\ntransportable ones, can be placed strategically within or near hospitals, next to or inside\nalternate care facilities [6], or logically\nsituated along SCPs in regional small-world networks of healthcare [7]. Outbreaks should not be underestimated. They wreak havoc on\nhealth small-world networks, social networks and national economies. The World Bank\nestimates the financial burden of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa to be $32.6 billion by\n2017 [8].\n\nInvestment in POCT to stop Ebola and other infectious disease outbreaks can be viewed,\ntherefore, as having high value and a substantial financial rate of return abroad and in the\nUSA as well. Collective action will produce economies of scale and increase value even more.\nOn 18 February 2015, the CDC listed 55 USA Ebola treatment centers (see [9]), but they are unevenly distributed\ngeographically, fixed in location and for some states, simply not there at all. Thus, the\nnation is not adequately prepared for challenges like Ebola, which masquerades among medical\nmimics causing febrile illnesses that should be sorted out with a probabilistic differential\ndiagnosis attained in minutes, that is, as quickly as possible to mitigate risk.\n\nStriking gaps in preparedness, here and abroad, generate uncertainty, which leads to\nunpredictability. Suppose, as some suggest, that Ebola becomes more contagious, albeit\nperhaps less deadly, in a genetic give and take. Common sense dictates that distributing\nresources will enhance future resilience. Thus, POCT [10,11] has blossomed to become an innovative, ubiquitous and\nrapidly evolving point-of-need resource for resilience [12\u201318]. It is\ntransforming not only disaster medicine [2], but\nalso public health practice at points of contact worldwide. An obvious benefit of POCT rests\nwith its utility \u201824/7\u2019. That is, once in place and used regularly by well-trained\noperators, POCT simultaneously meets the needs of emergency, urgent and routine care. Now,\nit should fold in public health.\n\nKey for the future is integrating public health practitioners in the needs fulfillment POCT\nscheme. Rather than depending on distant reference laboratories, borrowing from national\ndisaster caches [13,18] or using\nnon-dedicated externalities, such as conventional hospital main clinical laboratories, and\nalso faced with extraordinary risk, demands for speed and epidemiological containment,\nhospitals that admitted Ebola patients or individuals suspected of being infected rapidly\nimplemented broad-spectrum POCT directly within isolation areas [19,20] and containment units [21,22]. It is our overriding goal here to detail strategies\nfor a new POC public health framework, which should be put in place nationwide now to\ntransform and better enable public health practice, while there is still time, rather than\nlater, after the next crisis hits.\n\nExtensive formal needs assessment surveys have defined specifications, namely high\nsensitivity, safety and user friendliness, for portable molecular pathogen detection with\nbiohazard containment [1,23\u201329]. In\nan urgent call [3], the WHO published acceptance\ncriteria and priority features for Ebola diagnostics in a \u2018target product profile\u2019 (Table 1)\n[4]. These WHO features comprise high clinical\nsensitivity in the first 10 days of patient presentation (>98% desired, >95%\nacceptable), extremely high analytical specificity (>99% desired, >99% acceptable) and\nminimally invasive and validated sample types (e.g., fingerstick capillary blood, saliva, or\nbuccal) [4].\n\nThese specifications present serious challenges for technology designers, because implicit\nin them is low cost. However, our global field experience has shown that cost\u2013effectiveness\nis attained by assessing the overall value of POC diagnostics, not just the\ncosts, despite the practical challenges and economic realities of enabling appropriate value\npropositions. Also, the WHO target population [4], \u201cPatients presenting with fever to health care facilities for assessment,\u201d\nmisses the point, a serious error. To stop an outbreak, POC detection should be\nsubstantially upstream at the first point of contact before sick febrile patients spread the\ndisease to others. The first point of contact is anywhere that POCT can be used. The WHO\nconcept of waiting until the patient presents with fever is too far downstream in the SCP\nand therefore too late to stop outbreaks.\n\nAdditional WHO features include efficient process steps performed by the operator (<3\ndesired, <10 acceptable with no and 1 timed steps, respectively), no or facilitated\ntransfer of a precise volume of sample, quick analysis (<30 min desired, <3 h\nacceptable), internal controls, no or automated sample preparation and several delineated\noperational characteristics, such as robust operating conditions (0\u201350\u00b0C desired, 0\u201340\u00b0C\nacceptable; both up to 90% relative humidity), durable reagents and minimal training\nrequirements [4].\n\nThe WHO temperature specification of 50\u00b0C may encounter bubble formation in reagent\ncassettes and other physical alterations in the sample, but temperature can be controlled in\na diagnostic center, although in limited-resource settings, it will be challenging to do so.\nThe WHO format is a small handheld (<2 kg, desired) or tabletop (acceptable) portable\ninstrument with 30\u201360 min time limits for using opened reagents and ideally, solar,\nalternate or rechargeable battery power operating up to 8 h [4]. Well-configured, portable, robust and ergonomic POC devices\nwould be ideal for isolation areas, alternate care facilities, mobile venues and the\nfield.\n\nTable 2 lists POCT selected for the specialized\nisolation area at Emory University Hospital (2A) [19], used in the biocontainment unit of the University of Nebraska Medical Center\n(2B) [20] and designed for other Ebola\ncontainment centers [21] and suites [22] (2C & 2D). Additional POC test clusters can\nbe selected by the reader from web sources [30]\nand lists of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act-waived POC tests, which are the simplest to\nuse [31]. One should be aware of which tests are\nFDA cleared for use with critically ill patients, an important consideration for Ebola\npatients, and identify clusters of tests that fulfill needs cost-effectively, ideally, on as\nfew instruments as possible. POC staff [32] and\nother POC device operators must be trained in the use of personal protective equipment,\nsample handling procedures and the care of patients with Ebola.\n\nResearchers are innovating novel technologies, such as surface acoustic wave detection\n[33], a recombinase polymerase amplification\npanel [34] and multicolored silver nanoparticles\n[35]. Manufacturers are encouraged to respond\nto the threat of future outbreaks by producing user-friendly POC\ncassettes/cartridges/cuvettes with multiplex test clusters designed specifically for Ebola\npatients (\u2018Ebola test clusters\u2019). For example, coagulation tests on handheld devices are\ncleared by the FDA for anticoagulation (warfarin) monitoring, not for diagnosing\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation, one of the most serious complications of Ebola.\nClearly, these gaps need to be closed to improve the survival, assuming suitable therapy is\navailable, of Ebola patients, who develop rampant bleeding, septic shock, multiorgan failure\nand acute hepatic necrosis leading to fatal outcomes.\n\nSaijo et al. [36] reviewed\nlaboratory diagnostics for Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever in 2006. Now nearly a decade\nlater, the FDA is accelerating the ongoing development, validation and approval of new\ndiagnostic tests for Ebola by issuing EUAs more or less continuously since Fall 2014. Table 3 presents the EUAs in chronological order with\ntheir respective methods and status of development. Ebola-specific challenges for molecular\ndiagnostics include: i) reduction in initial false negatives, FN = FN(t),\nas a function of time, to ramp up sensitivity, {TP/[TP + FN(t)]}, to\nultrahigh levels in infected patients during the first 72 h when symptoms may be mild or\nabsent, in order to avoid shunting false-negative cases to community hospitals ill prepared\nto receive high-risk patients (TP is true positive); ii) automation of totally\nself-contained and sealable specimen cassettes and cartridges to eliminate need for\nexpensive high level biosafety cabinets; iii) proof of effectiveness in controlling internal\ncontamination in portable instruments, thereby sustaining ultrahigh specificity [TN/(TN +\nFP)] and minimizing false positives, which place people at risk when near infected patients\n(TN is true negative and FP false positive); and as more sophisticated but compact\ntechnologies become available; and iv) determination of quantitative viral genome titers,\nwhich will be useful for early detection of exposure in small volumes of specimen and also\nfor de-escalating the level of care and quarantine as the patient improves.\n\nWhen performed properly with biohazard precautions in the near-patient testing area of the\ndiagnostic center, results will be available much more quickly than sending specimens to a\npublic health laboratory or to the CDC [37,38]. The gain in time can be substantial, less than 1 h needed to obtain an\nanswer (see Table 3), which facilitates rapid\nscreening, focused triage and effective workflow. In West Africa, these practical\nefficiencies can help offset professional shortages in countries with large numbers of\npeople per physician, such as 70,000:1 in Liberia (fatality rate 43.0%), 45,000:1 in Sierra\nLeone (28.7%) and 10,000:1 in Guinea (61.9%) [39,40]. Last Fall, the WHO urgently pleaded for rapid diagnostics to meet needs\nand help make up for these shortfalls, even as physicians and nurses in West Africa\ncontracted Ebola and died.\n\nSelf-contained cartridge/cassette-based rapid molecular tests are available on small\nportable platforms that test for infectious diseases. Development of POC molecular\ndiagnostics for high-risk infectious diseases (see Table\n3) forecasts the feasibility of introducing Ebola assays on lightweight platforms\nlike the Alere i (Figure 2)\n[41] and the tiny Roche Diagnostics cobas Liat\n(Figure 3)\n[42], both Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAct-waived. If tests satisfy certain conditions, they can be waived, that is, cleared by the\nFDA for use in clinics and at home. Most are simple to carry out and use operator-friendly\nequipment, which improves chances of accurate test results. We will see these potential\nsolutions emerge as FAST POCTM when industry moves forward in the chronological\nprogression of Ebola EUAs-inexpensive, portable, safe and appropriate for detection of\nviruses in the early stages of clinical illness.\n\nFAST POCTM means that the patient obtains his or her own (capillary) blood (or\nother) sample with an automatic retractable lancet (or other sampling device) built into a\nself-aspirating and self-contained microcassette/microcuvette/cartridge, which then seals\nfor automated processing and automatic testing on an integrated POC instrument, while\nanother person, the \u2018facilitator\u2019, instructs and guides (hands off), so there is extremely\nlimited or no exposure to infectious agents. Technological developments in POCT indicate\nthat FAST POCTM is becoming a reality and will complement POC culture well [43,44]. Like something hidden in plain view,\nFAST POCTM offers a culturally adaptable solution for stopping future outbreaks,\nwhether Ebola, MERS-CoV or novel new threats, because of minimally significant exposure to\nothers or of oneself to infected patients and hence, little risk.\n\nSimilar to self-monitoring of blood glucose by individuals with diabetes, family members\ncan instruct each other in homes and obtain results without actually contacting any blood,\nother specimens or testing components. Alternately, visiting local public health workers can\neducate, instruct, guide and facilitate self-testing in primary care sites without\nnecessarily touching the patient or assay components. FAST POCTM will help\neliminate fear of going to treatment centers, being separated from family and assigning\nloved ones to lonely deaths, when they may have Dengue, hepatitis, HIV, influenza, malaria,\nsyphilis, tuberculosis or other common diseases in limited-resource settings or elsewhere,\nbut not Ebola or MERS-CoV. In West Africa, FAST POCTM will enable primary care\nsites, clinics and treatment centers to be sought out as sites for speedy diagnosis [45] and excellent care with improved chances of\nsurvival.\n\nThis future paradigm of POC diagnostics is to think globally and act globally, but test\nlocally where the people are in the context of their own cultural settings. Intrinsic to\nemerging POC culture [5,43,44] is\nthe popular expectation of rapid diagnosis [45]\nof high-risk viruses using disposable test strips, self-contained automated technologies and\nother mobile cartridge-, cassette- or cuvette-based approaches. Diagnostics that properly\nfulfill these expectations, and those popular expectations are the keys to motivation, in\nthe next 5 years while delivering ultrahigh sensitivity, specificity and predictive values\nwill help stifle outbreaks in the USA and other countries before they succumb to future\nthreats and untoward economic losses.\n\nMultiplex PCR assays are particularly beneficial in cases when samples are difficult to\ncollect or short on volume, and when different pathogens create the same clinical\nconstellation of symptoms and signs. Additionally, the instant traceability of infected or\npotentially infected individuals by knowing multiplex results, locations, and movement over\ntime and across borders can help contain the spread of highly contagious diseases. FAST\nPOCTM, self-knowledge and enabled people who take ownership of personalized\ndiagnostic testing will interrupt the rapid spread of outbreaks, an impactful shift in\npublic health to immediate diagnosis at points of need and a new POC culture in public\nhealth.\n\nDevices must comply with jurisdictional regulations in specific countries, operator use\nlimitations based on patient conditions, federal and state legal statutes and hospital\naccreditation requirements. Not all POC devices presented in this article are FDA cleared\nfor use in the USA. FDA emergency use authorization is limited in scope and term. Please\ncheck with manufacturers for the current status of Ebola, MERS-CoV and other threat\ndetection diagnostics and POC tests within the relevant domain of use."}
