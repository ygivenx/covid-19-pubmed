{"title": "Pathogenicity of neutralization escape mutants of mouse hepatitis virus: correlation with T-and B-cell depletions", "body": "results from an imbalance between viral replication and the host's immune defences (Sissons and Borysiewicz, 1985) . Cellu-lar resistance of mice to infection caused by a particular virus may indicate the absence of a specific genetically controlled viral permissivity factor in target cells (Brinton and Nathanson, 198 1) or host factors, including the integrity of Submitted March 3, 1994 , accepted September 27, 1994 cellular and humoral immune defences. Helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes are involved in the viral elimination process and are dependent upon the thymus for normal T lymphopoiesis (Borysiewicz and Sissons, 1986; Raff and Owen, 1971 ). Specific antiviral antibodies play an important role in viral elimination, promoting antibodymediated dependent cell cytotoxicity, complementmediated cell lysis and neutralization of infectious viral particles (Sissons and Oldstone, 1980; Sissons et al., 1982) . Efficient humoral immune response to viral infection depends on normal B lymphopoiesis, which takes place in the bone marrow (Osmond and Nossal, 1974) . When the virus is lymphotropic, understanding the pathogenic process of the viral disease is more complicated, as virus/lymphocyte interactions may alter cell integrity and induce subsequent immunodeficiency.\n\nMouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), a hepatotropic strain, is a coronavirus. Its inoculation into mice is usually followed by a generalized infection characterized by acute hepatic necrosis, killing the animal within a couple of days (Piazza et al., 1965) . The susceptibility of inbred mice to MHV3 hepatic disease is dependent on genetically controlled host factors (Le Prevost et al., 1975a; Levy-Leblond ef al., 1979; Levy et al., 1982) . Resistant A/J mice undergo a subclinical infection, whereas other strains, such as BALB/c or C57BL/6 are fully susceptible to fulminant hepatitis. Resistant A/J, however, become fully susceptible to acute disease following immunosuppressive treatments (Dupuy et al., 1975 ; Leray et al., 1982) or intracerebral inoculation (Lamontagne et al., 1989a) . (C57BL/6 x A/J)F, or C3H mice, however, can survive the acute phase of the disease but develop humoral and cel-lular immunodeficiency, leading to paralysis and death (Le Prevost er al., 1975b ; Leray et al., 1982) . No difference in virus titres was observed in the target organs of the resistant and susceptible mouse strains (Lamontagne et al., 1989a ) despite different histological lesions and in vitro replication.\n\nResistance to MHV3 infection is under the control of H2-or non-H2-related genes and expressed as haemopoietic cells and mature splenic or thymic cells (Levy-Leblond et al., 1979; Dupuy et al., 1984) . Histopathological studies have revealed that lymphoid organs such as the thymus and spleen showed injuries or atrophy in susceptible C57BU6 mice infected with pathogenic L2-MHV3 strain (Lamontagne et al., 1989a) ). Splenic T or B cells were depleted in L2-MHV3-infected susceptible mice (Lamontagne et al., 1985 (Lamontagne et al., , 1989a .\n\nIn addition, all thymocyte subpopulations decreased in thymus from infected susceptible mice (Lamontagne and Jolicaeur, 199 1) . Bone marrow pre-B and mature B cells also decreased in bone marrow, but not the terminal deoxytrans-ferase+ (Tdt+) or pro-B cells (Jolicmur and Lamontagne, 1989) .\n\nThe susceptibility of BALB/c mice is associated with impaired early activation of the immune system, demonstrated by the failure of lymphocyte proliferation resulting from the decrease in IL2 production @indzans ef al., 1987).\n\nGenetically determined sensitivity to MHV3 infection is correlated with viral replication in the macrophages (Lamontagne ef al., 1989b ; McNaughton and Patterson, 1980), pre-B and Blymphocytes (Jolicczur and Lamontagne, 1989) , and in the stromal thymic cells and their complexed thymocytes (Lamontagne and \n\nT-AND B-CELL DEPLETIONS 555 1991). We reported elsewhere that T-cell depletion results from nonproductive but lytic viral replication in the lymphoid cells in contact with infected thyrnic stromal cells, whereas pre-B and B cells support productive and lytic viral replication (Jolicmur and Lamontagne, 1989 ; Lamontagne and Jolicceur, 199 1).\n\nA useful tool in the study of the role of viral properties in pathogenicity is the attenuated escape mutants. Several viral genes, including those coding for the nucleocapsid (Fleming et al., 1983) , the peplomeric protein (S) (Makino ef al., 1987 ; Talbot et al., 1984) or the polymerase (Lai er al., 1981) , have been implicated as determinants of MHV virulence. The S protein is central to cellular tropism and MHV virulence. It is responsible for attaching the virus to the cell receptor, so that a point mutation in the S gene could modify viral pathogenicity and its target cells. We selected MHV3 mutants by virtue of their resistance to neutralization by anti-S monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in order to study their pathogenic properties. We show that the pathogenic properties of two MI-IV3 escape mutants were attenuated with regard to survival time (depending on inoculation site) and ability to deplete Tand B-cell subpopulations in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow of susceptible BALb/c mice.\n\nBALB/c mice were purchased from Centre d'elevage des animaux de laboratoires (CNRS, Orleans, France) or Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were tested either upon arrival or before use for the presence of anti-MHV antibodies by ELISA using an MHV3 preparation as antigen. During experiments, the animals were housed in a sterile atmosphere (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH).\n\nPathogenic MHV3 is a subcloned virus passaged into L2 cells. Mutants and MHV3-CL12 were selected from pathogenic MHV3 virus in the presence of S protein-specific A51 and A37 mAb, respectively. The mAb were chosen to select escape mutants retaining partial pathogenic property. These mAb were able to neutralize MHV3 and to slightly inhibit cellular fusion, but did not protect the sensitive mice against MHV3 infection (Martin et al., 1990) . All viruses were cultured in L2 cells.\n\nIn vivo pathogenicity\n\nThe mortality and virus titres in organs were determined after 100 plaque-forming unit (PFU) intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intranasal (i.n.) injections. Immunological analyses were performed on mice receiving 1000 PFU. Groups of 10 mice were used for mortality study and for measurement of viral titres in target organs; groups of three mice were used for histopathology and immunological studies.\n\nThe infected brain, liver, kidney, and lungs were collected and minced in a culture medium. The fragments were frozen at -70\u00b0C then thawed-frozen three times and centrifuged, and the supernatants were then used as viral suspensions. Virus titration was performed by the plaque-forming method onto L2 cells. Less than 10 PFU/g was considered as a negative result. CelIs L2 cells, a continuous mouse fibroblast cell line (obtained from Dr. R. Anderson, University of Calgary, Manitoba, Canada), were grown in Eagle's MEM with glutamine (5 mM), 5 % FCS (fcetal calf serum), and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 U/ml ; streptomycin, 100 pg/ml) (GIBCO Laboratories, Grand Island, NY). L2 cells were used for propagating, cloning, and viral titrating. Peritoneal exudate (PE) cells were obtained after washing the peritoneal cavity with 8 ml of RPMI-1640 containing 1% heparin (Allen & Hanbury, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). PE cells were seeded in microplates\n\n(5 x lo5 cells/well) and cultured at 37\u00b0C under 5 % CO for 24 h before infection. Spleens were aseptica ly i removed and then minced in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, glutamine and antibiotics. Thymuses were aseptically collected and teased apart using needles in RPMI-1640 medium and 20% FCS as previously described (Lamontagne er al., 1989a) .\n\nFor in vitro studies, spleen or thymic lymphocytes were purified by depositing cell suspensions on Lymphoprep gradients (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) and centrifuged, and the cell frac-tions were then collected, washed, and electronically counted (Coulter counter, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah. FL). Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the femoral shafts four times with 1 ml cold RPMI-1640 medium. Large particles were removed by sedimentation on a cushion of 1 ml of FCS for 5 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of RPM1 medium, and electronically counted (Coulter Counter, model ZM, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL).\n\nSplenic T cells (CD4+CD8-, CD4+CD8+) were labelled with the following mAb: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated anti-CD4 (mAb Rh4 4-5, Cedarlane, Homby, Ontario, Canada) and phycoetythrin-conjugated anti-CD8a (mAb 53-6.7, Cedarlane). A PE-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse p chain (Cedarlane) was used for labelling of splenic B cells. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from pooled organ homogenates from each group of three mice, and 1 x lo6 cells were incubated with an optimal dilution of mAb for 30 min at 4\u00b0C washed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and fmed in PBS pH 7.2 containing 1% formaldehyde, then stored at 4\u00b0C (Starkey et al., 1988) . For flow cytometry analysis, using a \"FACS-CAN\" flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), cells were gated according to forward and side angle light scatter. Gates were adjusted to include the discrete mononuclear population. Five thousand cells were analysed per sample. Thymocytes were similary labelled, and CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8-or CD4CD8+\n\nsubpopulations were recorded.\n\nDouble labelling of 14.8 and p chains\n\nLabelling of bone marrow 14.8+p-(pro-B) or 14.8+p.+ cells was performed, as described by Park and Osmond (1987) . Briefly, bone marrow cells were incubated with rat mAb 14.8 at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, washed, incubated for 30 min with FITC anti-rat IgG (Cappel Biomedical, Malvem, PA) in humidified atmosphere, and washed by centrifugation through FCS gradients. Cells were then cytocentrifuged and methanol-acetic acid fixed, and p chains were labelled using tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) -conjugated anti-p chains (Cappel Biochemical) for 30 min. The cell spots were washed and kept overnight in PBS.\n\nCytoplasmic p (cp)+, surface p (sp)-(pre-B) and cp+sp+ (B) cells were similarly labelled (Park and Osmond, 1987) . Bone marrow samples (4 x IO6 cells) were incubated for 30 min on ice with an optimal dilution of FITC anti-p chains (Cappel Biochemical) for so labelling. The cells were washed twice by centrifugation through FCS at 200 g at 4\u00b0C for 7 min. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 5% BSA. Bone marrow was cytocentrifuged and fixed as above. Cytoplasmic p chains were labelled with an optimal dilution of TRITC anti-p directly on the cell spots, then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber, then washed four times and kept overnight in PBS.\n\nSlides were mounted on a medium containing 90% glycerol (Fisher Scientific Co.) in PBS pH 8.0, and 0.1 % p-phenylenediamine (Fisher Scientific Co.). A fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury lamp and phase contrast optics was used. Slides were examined for 14.8+p-, 14.8+p+, cp+sp-, and cp+sp.+ B-lineage cell populations. The diameter of at least 100 cells at each subpopulation was measured using calibrated micrometer scale. The percentage of labelled cells was determined by counting a total of 1000 cells. The absolute numbers were calculated by the percentage of positive labelled cells and the total bone marrow count.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.\n\nWe studied the pathogenicity tion route (B). The MHV3-51.6 mutant virus expressed a lower virulence both i.p. and i.n. than did L2-MHV3.\n\nThese results indicate that the MHV3-CL12 mutant expresses a more greatly modified pathogenic property than the MHV3-5 1.6 mutant, particularly following i.n. inoculation.\n\nof MHV3 or its attenuated mutants in i.p. or i.n. infected BALBk mice\n\nTo study the mechanism involved in the pathogenic process of attenuated mutants, the levels of viral replication in various organs were evaluated. Groups of BALBk mice were i.p. or i.n. infected with pathogenic L2-MHV3 or attenuated mutants, and virus titres in the liver, kid-neys, brain and lungs were recorded at various times postinfection (p.i.) ( fig. 2) . Infectious viral particles were found in all organs of pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice as early as two or three days p.i. No significant difference in virus titres, however, was observed between i.n. or i.p. infected mice, except in the lungs ( fig. 2C ) (p c O.OOl), where a higher virus titre was produced following i.n. inoculation. In contrast, viral replication was delayed in all organs from mice i.p. infected with the MHV3-51.6 mutant (six days). There was a longer delay of six to twelve days in viral replication in all organs of MHV3-CL12 i.n. infected mice, although virus titres appeared sooner in the lungs and brain ( fig. 2B and C). Gross examination showed thymus atrophy in pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice but not in MHV3-CL12-and to a lesser extent, in MHV3-5 1.6-infected mice. These results suggest a correlation between viral pathogenicity, delay in viral replication, and thymic atrophy.\n\nSplenic Iymphoid T and B cells from i.p. or i.n. infected BALBk mice with MHV3 or its attenuated mutants\n\nWe have previously demonstrated a correlation between the pathogenicity of MHV3 infection and depletion of splenic T and B cells in susceptible C57BL/6 mice (Lamontagne er al., 1989a) . mAb escape mutants may be attenuated because they have lost the ability to induce lymphoid depletion in the spleen, favouring the development of an inflammatory response in infected organs. To verify this hypothesis, the percentages and absolute numbers of splenic CD4+CD8-and CD4%D8+ subsets were recorded in groups of mice i.p. or in. infected with either pathogenic L2-MHV3 or the attenuated mutants. Depletion of splenic CD4+CD8-cells was higher in i.p. or i.n. L2-MHV3-infected mice ( fig. 3) 1.\n\nD iL MHV3-CL12 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12 3 6 9 12\n\nTime postinfection (days) . 4B ). The level of CD4+CDS+ cell depletion was lower in mice infected with the attenuated mutants, but the depletion was higher in MHV3-51.6 than in MHV3-CL12-infected mice. In contrast, this thymocyte subset was strongly depleted after six days in mice i.n. infected with the attenuated mutants (p < 0.001). No significant decrease in the CD4+CD8 or CD4%D8+ subpopulations was observed. Thymic depletion thus results principally from the decrease in immature CD4+CD8+ cells in infected mice.\n\nBone marrow B-cell subpopulations of BALB/c mice i.p. or i.n. infected with MHV3 or its attenuated mutants\n\nThe splenic-B-cell decrease observed in L2-MI-IV3 or MHV3-5 1.6 mutant-infected BALBlc mice may reflect the inability of the bone marrow to produce mature B cells during the viral infection, as previously observed in infected C57BIf6 mice (Jolicceur and Lamontagne, 1989 infected with L2-MHV3 or MHV3-5 1.6 viruses (p c 0.001). Such a depletion was less evident in mice i.n. infected.\n\nThese results suggest that pre-B and B cells were strongly depleted during L2MHV3 or 51.6 viral infections, in contrast to those seen with the MHV3-CL12\n\nvirus. In addition, other bone marrow cells were similarly depleted (results not shown).\n\nThis work demonstrates a relationship between the pathogenic properties of attenuated MHV3 mutants and the depletion of T-or B-lineage cells in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow. Viral pathogenicity reflects the ability of a virus to induce clinical disease or death in mice. To study the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity, two approaches may be undertaken:\n\nanalysing the replication of a virulent virus in various target cells from resistant or susceptible mouse strains or studying the alterations of the biological properties of attenuated viral mutants in a susceptible mouse strain. We have previously worked on the first approach using pathogenic L2MHV3 in resistant A/J or susceptible C57B1/6 mice and have demonstrated a correlation between viral pathogenicity and the depletion of cells in lymphoid organs, resulting from either productive or abortive viral replication (Jolicoeur and Lamontagne, 1989 ; Lamontagne ef al., 1989a; Lamontagne and Jolicceur, 1991) . The use of neutralization escape mutants highlights the role of T-or B-cell depletions in the pathogenic process during acute hepatitis. Pathogenic L2MHV3 induces the depletion of splenic, thymic and bone marrow T-or Blineage cells following both i.p. or i.n. inoculations. Similar decreases in the B-lineage cells were seen in mice infected with the less attenuated MHV3-51.6 mutant, whereas splenic T and thymocyte subpopulations were less affected. The highly attenuated MHV3-CL12 mutant did not induce B-or T-lineage cell depletion, at least before six days p.i. The liver is the main target organ of an MHV3 infection and the privileged site for its replication (Le Prevost ef al., 1975a) . High titres of pathogenic L2-MHV3 occurred rapidly in the liver after i.p. inoculation, whereas MHV3-5 1.6 or MHV3-CL 12 attenuated mutants manifested a delay in the occurrence of viral titres in i.p. or i.n. infected mice. The histopathological examinations revealed some dramatic effects in i.p. pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice, particularly in the liver, where main hepatocellular necrosis in the absence of inflammatory cells was evidenced. Lesions were less extensive in i.n. infected mice, with fewer inflammatory cells present. Moderate liver necrosis foci with inflammatory cells, however, were seen in both MHV3-51.6 and MHV3-CL124nfected mice after i.p. or i.n. inoculations (results not shown). The delay in the production of virus titres is thus associated with less extensive histopathological lesions in the liver and with low or no transaminase activity (measuring the level of liver necrosis) found in the serum of such mice, unlike those observed in L2-MHV3infected mice (results not shown). In addition, viral replication was more delayed in MHV3-CL12 mutant after i.n. inoculation. Thus, viral pathogenicity correlates more with the time of appearance of virus tin-es in target organs rather than with the level of viral titres in the liver, brain, lungs or kidneys. Such a correlation has already been observed in resistant A/J or susceptible C57BL/6 mice in spite of scarce lesions in the liver of resistant mice (Lamontagne and Jolicoeur, 1991) . The delay in viral replication may be explained by the inability of the attenuated mutants to replicate in primary target cells or perhaps an ineffici.ent spreading of infection to other organs.\n\nPreliminary works show that the MHV3-CL12 mutant replicates very poorly in PE cells in contrast with MHV3-5 1.6 or L2-MHV3 viral replication, suggesting that macrophages can normally play their antiviral roles following i.p. infection with an MHV3-CL12 mutant. The change of role of macrophages and lymphoid cells from a barrier to infection to being the host cell targets for viral replication is further strengthened by the fact that genetically determined resistance of A/J mice to i.p. MHV3 infection can be abrogated after intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation (Lamontagne et al., 1989a) . Interestingly, more than 60% of MHV3-CL12infected mice survived up to 10 days p.i. following i.c. inoculation (results not shown) in contrast to those infected with MHV3-5 1.6 or pathogenic L2-MHV3, suggesting that the MHV3-CL12 mutant can be highly attenuated and thus unable to replicate in some unidentified brain target cells. Following i.n. inoculation, MHV strains initially replicate in the nasal epithelium rather than in the macrophages, and then appear in the olfactory pathways within the brain (Barthold and Smith, 1983; Goto er al., 1977) . This way, the virus can persist for more than 20 days in the posterior brain, whereas it is eliminated within 10 days from the nose (Barthold, 1988) . No information is available on the viral persistency mechanism in the brain following i.n. inoculation. ET AL.\n\nfoci were observed in the liver of attenuated virus-infected mice in contrast to pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice, suggesting that the virus mutants cannot replicate in the liver cells or could have lost their ability to thwart the natural or immune cell responses. We have previously demonstrated that the 5 1.6 mutant does not replicate in endothelial cells, and the CL12 mutant, in Kuppfer cells and hepatocytes (Martin et al., 1990) .\n\nOn the other hand, there is a correlation between L2-MHV3 pathogenicity and atrophy of the spleen or thymus, indicating that immune cells may instead play an important role in the pathogenic process of an acute disease (Lamontagne ef al., 1989a) . Furthermore, the involution of the thymus or spleen has been reported in mice after i.c. infection with lethal doses of the neurotropic MHV-JHM strain, but not following i.p. inoculation (Knobler er al., 1988) , suggesting that the primary target cell, depending on the inoculation site, plays an important role in the pathogenicity of replicating virus or in the spreading of infection.\n\nThe level of attenuation of MHV3-5 1.6 or -CL12 mutants correlates with their ability to deplete splenic T or B cells. The highly attenuated MHV3-CL12 mutant cannot induce rapid depletion of T or B cells following i.p. or i.n. inoculations.\n\nThe less attenuated MHV3-5 1.6 mutant, however, maintained its ability to deplete T and B cells following i.p. inoculation, as described with the L2MHV3, except that it cannot deplete T cells following i.n. inoculation. The use of these mutants enables us to examine the role of each compartment of the immune system, considering that the highly attenuated MHV3-CL12 mutant does not induce immunodeficiency, as defined by immune cell depletions, whereas the less attenuated MHV3-51.6 mutant maintains its ability to induce a decrease only in the B-cell compartment, after i.n. inoculation.\n\nThe mechanisms involved in the differences between the pathogenic properties of neutralization escape MHV3 mutants are not yet elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that the major difference between the nonpathogenic YAC-MHV3 virus and pathogenic L2-MHV3 is the inability of YAC-MHV3 to replicate in thymic stromal cells or in B lymphocytes (Jolicceur and Lamontagne, 1989 ; Lamontagne and Jolicczur, 199 1) . Preliminary results indicate that CL12 mutant cannot induce B-cell lysis in vitro in contrast with or L2-MHV3 viruses. A correlation between viral pathogenicity and in vitro viral replication in various target cells has frequently been reported to explain a genetic resistance to the various MHV strains (Boyle et al., 1987 ; Knobler ef al., 1984; Lamontagne et al., 1989b; McNaughton ef al., 1980) . MHV pathogenicity is principally carried by genes coding for the RNA polymerase and the S viral glycoprotein responsible for the attachment of the virus to a cell-surface receptor (Fleming ef al., 1986; Lai er al., 1981; Talbot et al., 1984) . On the other hand, immunodominant sites responsible for the binding of neutralizing antibodies are located on the S glycoprotein, particularly on the S2 subunit. Other domains are also identified near the proteolytic cleavage site and along the globular section of the S 1 subunit (Daniel et al., 1993 ; Routledge ef al., 1991) . In contrast, virus-mediated fusion activity is located at a site different from the neutralization epitopes, as shown by the binding sites of several mAb (Collins et al., 1982 ; Routledge et al., 1991) . MAb used for the selection of attenuated MHV3 mutants were able to neutralize L2-MHV3 at high dilutions and to slightly inhibit cellular fusion, but did not protect sensitive mice against pathogenic L2-MHV3 infection (Martin et al., 1990) , suggesting that these viruses are modified at a site included in a neutralization epitope and located near the fusion site, probably on the S2 portion of the viral glycoprotein (Daniel et al., 1993) .\n\nvariants of MHV-JHM may be generated by large deletions or by point mutations (Gallagher et al., 1990; Routledge et al., 1991) . No difference in the size of the mRNA coding for the S protein nor in the size of the S protein was detected between MHV3-CL12 or -5 1.6 mutants and pathogenic L2-MHV3 virus, suggesting that these neutralization-resistant variants express a point mutation in a neutralization site, inducing a conformational change (Daniel et al., 1993 ; Martin er al., 1990) .\n\nPoint mutations in the S protein cannot totally explain the pathogenic properties of the virus, since some conformational changes in the S protein may affect the viral tropism for one target cell without altering the tropism for other target cells (Dalziel et al., 1986; Fleming et al., 1986) . Viral pathogenicity is a complex property modulated by the viral tropism for several target cells. On the other hand, the study of viral pathogenicity cannot be dissociated from the immune response mechanisms in the various target organs. Integrity of the immune system is essential for mounting an efficient response and eliminating viral production by the various infected cells. The correlations observed in this work, between the pathogenicity of attenuated CL12 and 51.6 mutants, shed light on the roles of T or B lymphocytes as other target cells for viral replication and the consequences on virus-induced immunodeficiency.\n\nVial replication in immune cells may also be responsible for the decrease in the number of cells involved in the natural resistance to viral infection i.e. macrophages or NK cells, and in a second stage, T and B lymphocytes responsible for mounting efficient cellular and humoral immune responses. Effective clearance of viral infection in the brain requires CD4+CD8-and CD4%D8+ lymphocytes and also some unidentified bone marrow cells (Williamson and Stohlman, 1990 ). In addition, as has been demonstrated elsewhere, hepatitis does not result from lytic viral replication in hepatocytes but rather is correlated directly with spontaneous, T-lymphocyte-instructed expression of a procoagulant monokine that exhibits prothrombin-cleaving activity. This observation suggests that MHV3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade and microcirculation damage (Levy and Abecassis, 1989) . Vigorous procoagulant activity responses were observed in splenic mononuclear cells from susceptible C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice, whereas no activity was detected in cells from resistant A/J mice (Dindzans et al., 1985) . These results indicate that MI-IV3 tropism for macrophages or lymphoid cell subpopulations may alter their production of various cytokines involved in inflammatory responses and in the pathogenic process.\n\nFurther work is in progress to determine the permissiveness of various T-and B-cell subpopulations for replication of the attenuated MHV3 mutants and to identify the role of primary cell targets in the outcome of infection, depending on inoculation site.
