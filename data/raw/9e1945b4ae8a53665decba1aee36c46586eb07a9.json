{"title": "PERSPECTIVE Global Health Education in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellowships", "body": "Education in global health, defined by Koplan and colleagues as \"an area for study, research, and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving health equity for all people worldwide\" (1), is expanding among medical training programs (1) (2) (3) . There are several reasons for this. First, the focus on global health reflects a wave of social justice activism among students (4) . Second, trends in globalization and mass migration highlight the importance of understanding global epidemiologic, geographic, cultural, social, and economic determinants of disease (5) . Third, recent infectious disease epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2002) , H1N1 influenza (2009), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), Ebola (2014), and Zika virus (2016), vividly demonstrate the implausibility of medical isolationism. Fourth, global health training opportunities afford tangible benefits in physician knowledge, skills, and attitudes in caring for diverse patient populations (6) . Global health is especially important in pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship training, as respiratory and critical illness contribute tremendously to the global burden of disease (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .\n\nDespite the growing interest in global health training, optimal implementation of such training is challenging. Global health education in medical training often involves targeted coursework as well as domestic and/or international electives. However, isolated clinical or research rotations at international sites are unlikely to provide lasting benefits to the trainee or host institution and, when implemented improperly, pose substantial opportunity for harm (12) . Successful global health education programs in medical training maintain comprehensive, longstanding partnerships and collaborations that emphasize bidirectional exchange with international host sites. This bidirectional exchange includes ongoing, equitable commitments to mutual opportunities for training and professional development for both institutions (12) , including a focus on the particular knowledge and skill sets that are critical for addressing the unique medical, research, and public health priorities of individual countries.\n\nIn this Perspective, we offer a framework for core competencies and highlight three existing models of global health education within United States-based PCCM fellowship programs. We do not attempt an exhaustive review of PCCM training programs and acknowledge that some data about training programs may be incomplete. However, we aim to initiate conversation about the role and future direction of global health education for U.S. PCCM trainees.\n\nCore competencies for global health education among PCCM trainees have not been formalized, but a framework can be derived from national and international bodies of global health education as well as from the experience of numerous academic institutions in implementing global health educational programs (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Building on this foundation, we propose four areas of core competencies for PCCM global health training (Table 1) : clinical knowledge, international research training, cultural competency, and clinical and research capacity building.\n\nSome data suggest that formalized, directed didactic education is required to achieve core competencies (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . For example, participation in a global health certificate course was associated with increased recognition of a tropical disease, whereas participation in international clinical electives was not (25) . Developing and adhering to standardized PCCM global health core competencies will assure a basic level of \"global health competence\" among PCCM trainees.\n\nIntegrated global health tracks aim to teach core competencies in global health over the course of PCCM fellowships. We mention as examples two U.S. institutions-University of Washington and Duke University-that offer formal global health tracks in PCCM. The global health tracks currently implemented within these two training programs combine local global health-oriented didactics and journal clubs with rotations at international sites. Although the focus of these tracks is largely research oriented, this model can be extended to those who desire in-depth clinical training or exposure to clinical education in global health.\n\nThe duration of training for individuals enrolled in these two training programs ranges in length from 3 to 4 years, with the option of obtaining a Master's in Health Science or Public Health from an affiliated School of Public Health. Duke University's program brings together fellows and mentors from different specialties into a diverse, multidisciplinary global health track, whereas the University of Washington has created a global health pathway within the PCCM Division that supports fellows in leveraging interdisciplinary collaborations with mentors who provide complementary expertise. These models build on longstanding relationships with host institutions and emphasize bidirectional exchange of skill sets and research prioritized by host countries.\n\nEstablished investigators with ongoing research collaborations provide mentorship and opportunities to join ongoing projects. For instance, the University of Washington created the Kenya Research Program (now the Kenya Research and Training Center) more than 20 years ago to provide an academic forum to support both U.S. and Kenyan trainees and investigators in the planning, implementation, analysis, and presentation of research conducted in Kenya. The PCCM global health pathway leverages these longstanding collaborations in Kenya to conduct studies of chronic lung diseases and air pollution, in line with the Kenya Ministry of Health strategic plan to curb noncommunicable disease burden (26) . Established partnerships between U.S. institutions and international sites generate a wide array of projects that can be adapted to locally relevant clinical and research concerns, simultaneously benefiting PCCM trainees and international collaborators. \n\nSeveral barriers exist to expanding dedicated global health education tracks among PCCM programs. First, global health is a relatively new field, and thus there are few senior PCCM faculty members to provide requisite career and research mentorship. Second, funding has been largely restricted to communicable disease-related research (i.e., tuberculosis, HIV, childhood pneumonia), although this is changing with the National Institutes of Health's recent focus on noncommunicable diseases (30) (31) (32) . Third, Accreditation Council for \n\nGiven the substantial burden of respiratory and critical illness worldwide and increased globalization, global health education is emerging as an increasingly important component of PCCM training.\n\nFormal, integrated global health programs within PCCM training are relatively new but are built on principles and ideals of global health that focus on the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and social justice. PCCM fellowship programs that incorporate global health education intend to \"train socially accountable professionals who will be change agents in their societies to improve equitable distribution of health care resources and who will be leaders in advocating for better health care for all and in building stronger health care systems\" (2) . National and international organizations can also facilitate bidirectional academic exchanges between U.S. PCCM training institutions and others worldwide. Careers in global health encompass a broad spectrum of clinical, research, and educational opportunities within the emerging, multidisciplinary model of the field. Global health training should be a relevant focus of PCCM training programs, and where infrastructure and international relationships do not already exist, crossinstitutional and/or interdisciplinary collaborations can be harnessed to bridge gaps.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Sir William Osler prophetically described tuberculosis as a \"social disease with a medical aspect.\" One hundred years later, the social aspects of respiratory and critical illness are global phenomena; global health training in PCCM prepares the next generation of physicians to tackle these issues. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org."}
