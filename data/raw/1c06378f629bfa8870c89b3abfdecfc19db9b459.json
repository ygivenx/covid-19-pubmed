{"title": "The Viral Protein Corona Directs Viral Pathogenesis and Amyloid Aggregation", "body": "The term \"protein corona\" refers to the layer of proteins that adhere to the surfaces of nanostructures when they encounter biological fluids. Nanoparticles adsorb biomolecules in biological fluids due to the high free energy of their surfaces 1 . The importance of the corona layer stems from the fact that it constitutes the actual surface of interaction with biological membranes or \"what the cell sees\" in the in-vivo context 2 . Hundreds of proteins have been identified to confer a distinct biological identity of nanoparticles in different microenvironments depending on their size, chemistry and surface modification (recently reviewed in 3 ). These factors were found to be critical determinants of the biodistribution and pharmacodynamics of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the ability of the surfaces of nanoparticles to partially denature certain corona proteins exposing \"cryptic epitopes\" highlights the role of the protein corona in the toxicology of nanoparticles [4] [5] [6] . The formation of a protein corona is particularly important in the context of nanoparticle interaction with amyloidogenic peptides such as amyloid beta (A\u03b242) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which are associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 disease, respectively. Nanoparticles have been shown to catalyze amyloid formation via binding of amyloidogenic peptides in their corona, thereby increasing local peptide concentration and inducing conformational changes that facilitate fibril growth via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism 7, 8 . This surface-assisted (heterogenous) nucleation has been demonstrated for several nanoparticles with different amyloidogenic peptides including IAPP and A\u03b242 9,10 .\n\nHere, we studied viruses in terms of their biophysical equivalence to synthetic nanoparticles in extracellular environments. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses lack any metabolic activity outside the cell, and can thus be expected to interact with host factors in the microenvironment similar to artificial nanoparticles.\n\nIn the current work, we used well-established techniques of nanotechnology to study the protein corona of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in comparison to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and synthetic liposomes.\n\nAdditionally, we studied the interaction of both RSV and HSV-1 with amyloidogenic peptides.\n\nRSV is an enveloped Orthopneumovirus with a diameter between 100 and 300 nm and a single stranded negativesense RNA genome with 10 genes encoding 11 proteins 11 . It is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children worldwide, causing up to an annual estimate of 34 million cases 12 . By the second year of life, nearly 90% of children get infected with RSV causing up to 196,000 yearly fatalities 13 . Reinfection with RSV occurs throughout life, usually with mild local symptoms in the upper airways 14 . However, reinfection in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals can lead to severe clinical disease in the lower airways. While natural infection leads to the production of neutralizing antibodies, the ability of these antibodies to protect from subsequent RSV infections appears to be incomplete 15, 16 . Neither a vaccine nor an antiviral therapy is yet available except for passive immunization using the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab. Early vaccine trials using formalin-inactivated RSV led to enhanced disease with up to 80% of vaccinees being hospitalized and two dying following natural RSV infection 14, 16 . This led to the hypothesis that host immune responses play an important role in the pathophysiology of airway disease caused by RSV.\n\nAssessment of the proteomic data by principle component analysis (PCA) showed that RSV and HSV-1 samples were well separated from one another and that the viral samples were well separated from the control samples with the replicates clustering together ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Replicate clustering was confirmed via corresponding correlation plots for the samples in the PCA, which showed higher correlation coefficients between the replicates within the same corona condition than between different conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Notably, both RSV and HSV-1 possessed distinctive proteomic profiles depending on the biological fluid ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2c ). In addition, RSV protein corona profiles were different between HP and jHP ( Supplementary Fig. 2d) ; however, the use of a different mass spectrometer for this experiment prevents direct comparison to the data shown in Fig. 1 . The reproducibility of the corona preparations was further assessed by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) between the replicates for each sample type. The CVs ranged between 16 -42% depending on sample type (average 28%, Supplementary Fig. 3d) .\n\nIn order to determine if the most abundant corona factors were the most abundant proteins in the biological fluids, the crude fluids were also analyzed by mass spectrometry. The top 10 most abundant proteins identified are presented in Table 1 . Similar to previous findings for nanoparticles 27 , our data showed that the most abundant proteins in the protein corona were not necessarily the most abundant in the biological fluids. This, together with the PCA analyses comparing RSV to HSV-1 and the controls indicated enrichment of particular corona factors depending on the surface properties of the virus. Moreover, proteomic data sets were visualized by heat map and hierarchical clustering revealing an extensive protein corona signature for viral samples in each biological fluid ( Fig. 1d) . While the serum-free viral particles contained some host factors that were incorporated during virus replication and budding from the cells, the virus was able to subsequently accumulate a different set of host factors which were dependent on the biological fluid. As such, a characteristic viral biological identity was associated with each biological fluid. The viral corona factors present on all three replicates in each biological fluid are listed in Supplementary Data 1. In addition, the raw proteomics data are available in Supplementary Data 2.\n\nAdditionally, we used transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the viral protein corona. A layer of factors was observed interacting with the viral surface upon encounter with cell membranes, which was absent in serum free conditions (Fig. 2a) . This demonstrated that RSV accumulated a layer of corona factors that are likely involved in cellular interactions. We also performed cryoimmuno electron microscopy using antibodies for certain proteins that were detected in the viral corona proteomic analysis. In serum-free conditions, we used an anti-RSV F-protein antibody. For adult HP and BALF coronae, we used anti-human IgG and anti-surfactant protein A (SP-A) antibodies, respectively. The bound antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies coated with 10 nm gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2b , corona factors were bound to the surface of RSV and labelled with the respective antibodies. To further confirm the binding of these factors, we performed western blot analysis on viral particles incubated with either HP or BALF. Several bands were detected for SP-A in the BALF corona samples and were completely lacking in the HP corona samples ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). In addition to the main SP-A bands, several high molecular weight bands were also detected with the anti-SP-A antibody. This suggested that SP-A was forming complexes either on its own or with other corona factors. When stained with anti-human IgG antibodies, bands were detected in both coronae, but with higher intensity in the HP corona compared to the BALF corona ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) . The bands were normalized to the RSV G protein band which was used as a 6 loading control ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Taken together, our data demonstrated that RSV acquired a differential protein corona layer depending on the biological fluid.\n\nTo investigate if differential corona composition affects viral infectivity, virions produced under serum-free conditions were pre-incubated with different biological fluids before infection of HEp-2cells. The RSV-GFP virions were incubated with biological fluids at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (equivalent to 5% v/v) for 1 h at 37 \u02daC then diluted 10 times in serum-free medium before infecting the cells at final MOI of 1. Corona precoating had a significant effect on viral infectivity as demonstrated by the differential frequency of GFP expressing cells quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 3a-b and Supplementary Fig 5) . HP corona pre-coating significantly reduced infectivity compared to serum-free conditions, while FBS and MP led to 5-6 fold enhancement in infectivity. The BALF corona also enhanced infectivity, but to a lower extent as compared to MP and FBS.\n\nMoreover, fluorescence microscopy revealed syncytia formation of cells infected with BALF, MP and FBS coronae ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). No significant differences in cell-toxicity were observed. jHP pre-coating, on the other hand, slightly enhanced infectivity, but it did not reach significance (Fig. 3b ). This lack of inhibition compared to adult HP could be attributed to the lack of anti-RSV antibodies in the selected jHP ( Supplementary   Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of different coronae on the activation of human moDCs by quantifying the expression of the maturation marker CD86. Differentiated moDCs were infected by virions produced under serum-free conditions with different corona pre-coatings for 4h in serum-free conditions. The cells were then washed and incubated in serum-containing medium for 72 h prior to flow cytometry analyses. Only the BALF pre-coated virions were able to induce moDC activation and increase CD86 expression ( Fig. 3c-f) . Notably, adding BALF alone or corona-free RSV did not activate the cells, showing that it was the RSV-BALF corona complex that induced moDC activation. In addition, BALF pre-coating enhanced infectivity in moDCs as quantified by flow cytometry of GFP expression ( Fig. 3e-f ). Altogether, this shows that pre-incubation of virions produced under serum-free conditions in different biological fluids to allow a corona formation greatly affects infectivity and the ability to induce moDC activation in a biological fluid-dependent manner.\n\nThe set of factors that were only present in the HP corona and not in the other conditions comprised several antibodies and complement factors (Fig. 4a) . Moreover, gene list enrichment analyses of HP corona revealed an enrichment of immunological gene ontology (GO) terms such as complement activation and humoral immune response (Fig. 4b) . The HP corona proteomic profile was consistent with the observed inhibition of infectivity (neutralization), indicating that the corona characterization methodology is representative of the actual layer of host factors that surrounds the viral particle. Notably, despite having comparably high levels of virus-specific IgG antibodies, BALF imparted opposite effects on infectivity compared to HP (Fig. 3) . At the proteomics level, GO analysis revealed that the viral BALF corona comprised a different set of factors that are less enriched in immunological components and more enriched in factors related to adhesion, anchoring, protein targeting to membrane, interspecies interaction, mutualism through parasitism, protein complex binding, and macromolecular complex binding (Fig.4) . This was further supported by the western blot analysis where the corona of the BALF incubated virions was less enriched in human IgG compared to the viral HP corona ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . and MP on viral neutralization via palivizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV. We found that the enhancing effects of the coronae were completely lost in the presence of the antibody and that the antibody neutralization curves were very simillar in the presence and the absence of the viral corona (Fig. 5b) . These data demostrated that high affinity antibodies were able to compete out corona factors to impart host protection. GO analysis revealed that FBS and MP coronae were also enriched in terms such as anchoring, adhesion, receptor binding, protein complex binding, unfolded protein binding, interspecies interaction, viral process, and mutualism through parasitism ( Fig. 5c-d) .\n\nSince nanoparticles are known to bind amyloidogenic peptides in their coronae leading to induction of amyloid aggregation via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism, we next investigated whether viruses are also capable of this particular corona interaction. We investigated the interaction of RSV with a model amyloidogenic peptide (NNFGAIL) derived from the IAPP. We traced the ability of RSV to accelerate amyloid kinetics using the wellestablished thioflavin T (ThT) based methodology. The ThT dye changes its fluorescence emission spectrum upon binding to amyloid fibrils, and plotting relative changes in the fluorescence intensity against time illustrates the kinetics of the amyloid formation process 28 . Using the ThT assay, we found that the presence of RSV particles significantly accelerated amyloid formation of NNFGAIL compared to non-infected cell supernatant demonstrating that RSV acted as a catalytic surface for amyloid aggregation (Fig. 6a) . As a control, we compared the kinetic curves of the virus-containing medium vs. virus-free medium upon incubation with ThT alone without a peptide. As shown in Supplementary Fig 7a, the curves were very similar, indicating that the relative changes that we observed in the presence of amyloidogenic peptides are not due to unspecific interaction of the virions with the ThT dye. Additionally, extensive fiber networks were observed with TEM within 100 min. of incubation with RSV ( Fig. 6b ) and some virions were located at the tip of these fibers (Fig. 6c) . Moreover, RSV catalytic activity was more efficient than lipid vesicles of similar size; however, it was dramatically reduced in the presence of 5% FBS, indicating a competition between the peptide and other corona factors for the viral surface (Fig. 6d) .\n\nOn the other hand, RSV failed to catalyze the amyloid aggregation of GNNQQNY peptide, which is derived from yeast prion protein (Fig. 6e) . This, in turn, indicated that such interactions are not universal to all amyloidogenic peptides but display some selectivity depending on the virus/peptide pair.\n\nThe finding that viral surfaces could serve as catalysts for amyloid formation warranted further investigation and confirmation using another virus/peptide system. To this end, we investigated HSV-1 and the A\u03b242 peptide, whose aggregation is a major hallmark of AD. Recently, there has been an increasing body of reports suggestive of a correlation between HSV-1 infection and AD, reviewed in 21 . However, evidence of a direct role of HSV-1 in the process of amyloid nucleation and subsequent fibril growth is currently lacking. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/246785 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe found that HSV-1 significantly accelerated amyloid formation of A\u03b242 compared to non-infected cell supernatant (Fig. 7a) . As a control, and similar to the RSV/NNFGAIL system, both the virus-containing medium and virus-free medium produced similar curves upon incubation with ThT alone without peptide ( Supplementary   Fig. 7b ). The catalytic activity was reduced by the presence of FBS, also indicating a competition at the viral surface (Fig 7b) . In addition, HSV-1 was more efficient than liposomes in accelerating the amyloid aggregation kinetics (Fig. 7c) . Furthermore, the propensity of HSV-1 mediated amyloid catalysis was higher for the more amyloidogenic A\u03b242 peptide compared to the shorter, less amyloidogenic A\u03b240 peptide (Fig. 7d) . Amyloid induction was further confirmed by TEM demonstrating fibril formation within 100 min. of incubation with viral particles (Fig. 7e-h) . Amyloid protofilaments and fibrils at different stages of elongation were observed interacting with the viral surface. Fig. 7e and f show multiple fibrillary structures emerging from one viral particle suggesting that a nucleation mechanism was taking place on the surface, thereby sparking fibril elongation. Viral particles also interacted with fibrillar structures that are part of an extensive network of fibers as shown in Fig. 7g and h.\n\nImportantly, to demonstrate the in-vivo relevance of our mechanistic findings, we intracranially infected transgenic 5XFAD mice with HSV-1. The 5XFAD mouse is a widely-used AD model as it recapitulates many AD phenotypes with rapid onset of A\u03b242 aggregation that spreads to the hippocampus and cortex by six months of age 29 . We observed a significant increase in A\u03b242 accumulation in the hippocampi and cortices of HSV-1 infected mice 48h post infection (Fig. 7i ) in comparison with animals injected with non-infected supernatant. Representative images of the amyloid staining demonstrate the dramatic difference in amyloid accumulation between infected and noninfected animals (Fig. 7j) . These results validated our biophysical findings using the ThT assay and demonstrated that the viral corona-driven catalysis of amyloid aggregation could take place in in-vivo situations.\n\nViruses rely on the cellular machinery of the host for replication, production of viral proteins, assembly and export out of the cell. However, outside cells, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles.\n\nBased on this biophysical equivalence, we hypothesized that viruses accumulate a rich and selective protein corona layer in the extracellular environment similar to nanoparticles. Examples of particular host factors that bind to viral surfaces have previously been described. For example, lipoproteins such as apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) were shown to be essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 30 . Furthermore, coagulation factors such as factor X were shown to directly bind adenovirus leading to liver tropism 31, 32 . Other soluble components such as Gas6 were shown to contribute to the infectivity of lentiviral vectors even when pseudotyped with multiple types of envelope proteins 33 . Furthermore, soluble heparin sulfonated proteoglycans (HSPGs) were shown to enhance the infectivity of human papillomavirus (HPV) 34 . Interestingly, amyloids derived from prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP) in semen were shown to enhance HIV-1 infectivity by several orders of magnitude 35 . Additionally, plant viral nanoparticles that are used for drug delivery were shown to possess a protein corona that affects their uptake and biodistribution 36 . However, to our knowledge, there is no previous work that has characterized the protein corona of an infectious animal virus in different biological fluids and studied its effect on viral pathogenicity.\n\nIn this work, we used proteomics to study viral protein corona enrichment in different biological fluids. We investigated the RSV protein coronae in biological fluids that are relevant to viral tropism, zoonosis and culturing conditions. As RSV is a virus tropic to the respiratory tract, we compared the viral corona in human BALF versus HP from adult healthy volunteers and jHP from RSV-seronegative 6-month-old infants. We also investigated the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Moreover, we studied the corona in FBS, which is the most commonly used cell growth supplement for viral production and in-vitro studies. We compared the RSV corona to HSV-1 and lipid vesicles of similar size with positively or negatively charged surfaces as well as the biological fluids per se. PCA, quantitative intrasample variability analysis and correlation matrices demonstrated that the RSV corona profiles were well separated from that of HSV-1 and lipid vesicles (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3 ). Intra-sample variability could arise in the process of sample preparation during incubation, washing and digestion or during mass spectroscopy-based detection 38 . Notably, while the viral corona profile was dependent on the biological fluid, it was not a mere reflection of the most abundant proteins, as demonstrated earlier for nanoparticles 27 and as shown in the Table 1 of the top 10 proteins present in the viral coronae in comparison to crude biological fluids. The viral protein corona was visualized using TEM, which revealed a layer surrounding the viral surface involved in cellular interactions ( Fig. 2a) . Using cryoimmuno electron microscopy and western blot, we could detect specific proteins identified from the proteomic analysis (human IgG in HP and SP-A in BALF) associated with RSV upon incubation with HP or BALF, respectively ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4) . Functionally, the coronae from the different biological fluids enhanced RSV infectivity except for the HP corona, which completely neutralized the virus (Fig.   3 ). Taken together, using several complementary methods, our data demonstrated the specific enrichment of differential corona profiles on viral surfaces. As such, the protein corona represents an initial phase of viral-host interactions that precedes cellular interaction and affects subsequent infectivity. Unlike the viral genome-coded surface proteins, the viral protein corona is an acquired structural layer that is dependent on the viral microenvironment resulting in different viral identities based on the target tissue and the target organism.\n\nMoreover, as the corona layer is a rich and complex layer, the final biological effect is expected to be dependent on a multitude of corona factors rather than a single protein.\n\nProteomic analysis of the HP corona revealed that it was enriched in antibodies and complement factors, which could explain the neutralization effect ( Fig. 3 and 4) . Other factors of documented immunological functions such as fibrinogen 39 , properdin 40 , annexin A1 41 , protein S100 42 and vimentin 43 were also detected in the HP corona (Supplementary Data 1). These factors could be parts of an immunological corona that enables efficient viral neutralization and/or immune system modulation. On the other hand, jHP, which lacked the anti-RSV antibodies, failed to neutralize the virus and the jHP corona was less enriched in immunological factors compared to the HP corona (Table. 1 and Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the BALF corona enhanced viral infectivity in both HEp-2 cells and moDCs despite having equally high anti-RSV IgG antibody titers as compared to HP according to ELISA analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The proteomic and GO analysis showed that the BALF corona was less enriched in immunological factors (Fig. 4) . Additionally, less IgG was detected in the BALF corona in the western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The failure of BALF to neutralize the virus despite being rich in anti-RSV antibodies suggested that the differential protein corona profile could affect antibody binding in BALF conditions. This might explain the recurrence of pulmonary RSV infection even in individuals with high IgG titers 15 . An alternative explanation is that the BALF anti-RSV antibodies are of lower affinity than their HP counterparts and are thus less able to compete out other corona factors that enhance viral infectivity. It remains to be elucidated, which avidity is required in order to compete out the corona layer. The list of proteins that were uniquely detected in the BALF corona included pulmonary surfactants which are known to enhance RSV infectivity 44 , nucleolin and EGFR, which were shown to be important for RSV cell entry 45, 46 , adhesion molecules (such as tetraspanin, .

Notably, pre-incubation of RSV with BALF was the only condition that induced moDC activation (Fig. 3) . Importantly, it was not the combination of the proteins in the biological fluids or the virus per se that affected the outcome, but rather the viral-corona complex, as shown by the lack of moDC activation by BALF or RSV alone. Moreover, and in accordance with the documented role of corona factors in nanoparticle immunogenicity 47 , our results demonstrated the role of the acquired corona layer in virus-induced immune activation that might contribute to disease pathophysiology. It can be speculated that the viral corona factors are part of the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), which are recognized by the innate immune system. It also suggests that corona factors need to be considered in the design of vaccines and adjuvants for efficient stimulation of the immune system.\n\nAdditional biological fluids investigated in our study included FBS and MP and they both enhanced the infectivity of RSV in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 5a) . Artificially adding anti-RSV antibodies (palivizumab) successfully neutralized the virus even in these corona conditions, indicating successful out-competition by the antibody (Fig. 5b) . GO analysis suggested a role of FBS and MP corona factors in interspecies interaction, mutualism, viral process, protein complex binding, unfolded protein binding, anchoring and adhesion (Fig. 5 c-d) .\n\nFactors uniquely present in the FBS corona that may contribute to these effects include C4b-binding protein alphalike which is a complement inhibitor, isoform 2 of fermitin family homolog 2 which binds to membranes enriched in phosphoinositides and enhances integrin-mediated adhesion 48 and hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (Fig. 5c ).\n\nIn the MP corona, several adhesion proteins were found including: fibronectin isoform 4 preproprotein, endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule, fermitin family homolog 3 short form and zyxin. The MP corona also contained receptor ligands such as: transferrin and C-X-C motif chemokine together with tetherin (isoform 2 of Bone marrow stromal antigen 2), which possesses antiviral properties 49 . Taken together, this illustrated that the observed functional effects of the viral protein corona were most likely mediated by a combination of factors that are enriched on the viral surface and not by a single factor. Since many viruses bind to several receptors and coreceptors, such interactions might be taking place in a multivalent manner 50 . In addition, our results also highlight that the viral protein corona has to be taken into consideration in relation to zoonosis and applications involving viral propagation in-vitro.\n\nWe then investigated whether viral corona interactions with host factors involve surface-assisted nucleation of amyloids. Nanoparticles have been shown to act as catalytic surfaces that facilitate heterogenous nucleation of amyloid fibrils via binding, concentrating and enabling conformational changes of amyloidogenic peptides 7, 51, 52 .\n\nSimilar to what have been reported with nanoparticles, we found that RSV accelerated the kinetics of amyloid aggregation of a model amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP (NNFGAIL). This demonstrated that viral particles are also capable of amyloid catalysis via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation (Fig. 6) . In order to investigate if this catalytic mechanism extends to other virus-amyloid pairs, we evaluated whether HSV-1 could accelerate the amyloid kinetics of A\u03b242, which is implicated in AD. Several recent studies have suggested HSV-1 involvement in AD 53 . Herein, we found that HSV-1 accelerated the kinetics of amyloid aggregation of A\u03b242 and to a lesser extent the aggregation of A\u03b240 (Fig. 7) . HSV-1 was more efficient than lipid vesicles in amyloid catalysis The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/246785 doi: bioRxiv preprint maturation and the viral surface via early protofibrillar intermediates, which we speculate represent the surfaceassisted nucleation process. Importantly, infecting 5XFAD AD animal models with HSV-1 lead to increased accumulation of A\u03b242 plaques as evident by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 7) , demonstrating that the viral corona-driven catalysis can take place in-vivo.\n\nTaken together, our data on RSV and HSV-1 demonstrated that viruses can physically act as nano-surfaces capable of catalyzing amyloid nucleation and leading to accelerated fibril formation. While our results do not prove disease causality, they present mechanistic explanation of the clinical and experimental correlations drawn between HSV-1 and AD, which requires further investigation. Interestingly, Apo-E, which is a well-known risk factor for AD, was enriched in the HSV-1 corona, suggesting even further disease links (Supplementary Data 1) .\n\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that A\u03b242 is an antimicrobial peptide that aggregates to sequester pathogens [54] [55] [56] [57] . Here, we present an alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation. Our corona-driven hypothesis suggests that the virus interacts with extracellular amyloidogenic peptides as part of the pathogenesis, and the bound peptides do not necessarily possess an immunological and/or an antimicrobial function. This is further corroborated by studies showing that amyloids can enhance the infectivity for viruses such as HIV and HSV 35, 58 , and the fact that amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-out animals are not more susceptible for infections compared to wild-type animals 59 . From this perspective, virus surface-assisted nucleation might have evolved as a mechanism by which viruses modulate the host's extracellular environment by catalyzing the phase transition of certain peptides from soluble to insoluble forms; a phase change that could lead to toxic gain or loss of function or both. In addition, the viral surface-assisted nucleation mechanism could be extended to other viruses correlated with neurodegenerative pathology such as HIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) 60 and influenza virus and post-encephalitic parkinsonism 61 To conclude, the current work was based on the biophysical equivalence between viruses and artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments. We here demonstrated that nanotechnological concepts such as the protein corona and surface-assisted nucleation can be extended to infectious viruses. We showed that viral protein corona accumulation and amyloid catalysis are two aspects of the same phenomenon, namely viral surface interaction with extracellular host proteins. This phenomenon leads to the modulation of how viruses interact with cells and/or the induction of conformational changes in bound proteins that leads to accelerated amyloid aggregation. These findings highlight the potentially critical role of viral extracellular interactions in viral infectivity and in relation to extracellular protein pathology.

HEp-2 cells were initially seeded in growth medium (DMEM medium with 5% FBS ( MOIs used for infectivity experiments were based on genome copies/ml measured by qPCR and the infectious viral titers were measured as TCID50 on HEp-2 cells. Briefly, 10-fold dilutions of virus were added onto Hep2 cells for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, then inoculum was removed, and fresh maintenance medium was added. The plates were examined in the microscope on day7 and the number of wells for each dilution that was positive for GFP was noted. The titer was calculated according to the method of Karber. The viral stock of 7x10 8 genome copies/ml corresponded to log10 6.7 TCID50/mL. For HSV-1, strain F HSV-1 stocks were prepared by infecting African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells at 80-90% confluency in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS or in serum-free DMEM. The virus was harvested 2 d after infection. Cells were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles and spun at 20,000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris.\n\nClarified supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Non-infected cell medium was prepared with the same procedure without viral infection. Plaque assay was used to determine viral titers. 10-fold dilutions of virus were added onto VERO cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, then inoculum was removed, and fresh medium containing 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma Aldrich) was added. Cells were fixed and stained 2d later with a 0.1% crystal violet solution and the number of plaques was counted.

Samples were applied to Formvar/carbon coated 200 mesh nickel grids (Agar Scientific, UK), then negatively stained using an aqueous solution of uranyl acetate (1%) and visualized.\n\nSerum-free produced RSV was incubated with BALF or HP both at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml at a ratio of 1:1 v/v (in citrate adjusted conditions to prevent coagulation) for 1h at 37 \u2103, then harvested and washed similar to the procedure for corona proteomic analysis. Samples were lysed using a RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and protein content was measured. Samples were heated with loading buffer to 95\u02daC for 5 min and 1 \u00b5g of protein was loaded onto NuPAGE\u00ae Bis-Tris 4-12% gels then separated at 80 V for 15 min followed by 100V\n\nfor 135 min at room temperature using 1x NuPAGE\u00ae MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). The gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the IBlot\u00ae system (Invitrogen) and subsequently the membranes were blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences GmbH) for 1.5 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 \u2103 with anti-Surfactant Protein A antibody [6F10] (ab51891, abcam) diluted at 1:500 then probed the next day using goat anti-human IgG (IRDye 800, red, LI-COR Biosciences) and goat anti-mouse IgG (IRDye 680, green, LI-COR Biosciences). To normalize the bands to a loading control, scanned membranes were stripped for 10 min at 65 \u02daC using 1x New Blot Nitro Stripping buffer (LI-COR Biosciences), blocked for 1.5 h, and then incubated with anti-respiratory syncytial virus antibody (ab20745, abcam) 65 at 1:500 dilution for 2h at RT before probing with secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat, IRDye 680, green, LI-COR Biosciences). All western blot signals were scanned using the Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences GmbH) and quantification was performed on the images using ImageJ software.\n\nTo evaluate the impact of the HSV-1 on brain \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) levels, 3-month-old transgenic 5XFAD mice (purchased from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine, US) were randomly divided into 2 groups. The animals were injected either with the HSV virus or non-infected supernatant using a micro-infusion pump (The Harvard Apparatus Pump Series, Harvard Bioscience, USA) into the right lateral ventricles. Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained with 1.8% isoflurane (in 30% O2/70% N2O). The temperature of the animals was maintained at 37 +/-0.5 \u00b0C using a thermostatically controlled heating blanket connected to a rectal probe (PanLab, Harvard Apparatus, Barcelona, Spain). The skin was opened and the scull exposed. \n\nThe authors declare no competing interests. "}
