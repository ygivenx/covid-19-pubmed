{"title": "Evidence of the COVID-19 Virus Targeting the CNS:\nTissue Distribution, Host\u2013Virus Interaction, and Proposed Neurotropic\nMechanisms", "body": "The first reports of the viral infection attracted attention in\nlate December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. Later, it\nwas revealed that the virus responsible for causing the infections\nwas contagious between humans. By early January, terms like \u201cthe\nnew coronavirus\u201d and \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d were\nin common use. On February 11, 2020, a taxonomic designation \u201csevere\nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d (SARS-CoV-2) became\nthe official means to refer to the virus strain, that was previously\ntermed as 2019-nCoV and Wuhan coronavirus. Within a few hours on the\nsame day, the WHO officially renamed the disease as COVID-19.\n\nThe complete genome\nof SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China was submitted\non January 17, 2020 in the National Center for Biotechnology1 (NCBI) database, with ID NC_045512. The genome\nof SARS-CoV-2 is a 29,903 bp single-stranded RNA (ss-RNA) coronavirus.\nIt has now been shown that the virus causing COVID-19 is a SARS-like\ncoronavirus that had previously been reported in bats in China.\n\nThe brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors\n(Figure 1A, C) that\nhave been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them\na potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability\nof SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain\nvia the nose close to the olfactory epithelium.3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2\nin patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to\nbe established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the\npast, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence\nof the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry,\nand real-time reverse transcription-PCR (3). Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated\nthe presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the\nblood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from\ngaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored\nin patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19\nin the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%)\npatients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale\nof the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus. Also, a finding\npublished on a patient who had loss of involuntary control over breathing5 during the recent outbreak with several other\npatients suffering acute respiratory failure implores healthcare professionals\nand clinicians to segregate COVID-19 patients into neurologically\naffected cases and those who are devoid of neurological deficits.\n\nWith the mRNA encoding several other proteins,1 the COVID-19 virus, like SARS-CoV, uses a spike\nprotein\nS1 that enables the attachment of the virion to the cell membrane\nby interacting with host ACE2 receptor3,6 (Figure 1C, D). In the later study,6 it was shown that the ACE2 binding affinity of\nthe 2019-nCoV spike protein ectodomain was 10\u201320-fold higher\nthan that of the SARS-CoV spike protein. A BLASTp search of the COVID-19\nvirus (SARS-CoV-2) receptor binding domain (RBD) subdomain-1 (319th\nto 591st aa) fetched a spike glycoprotein [bat coronavirus RaTG13]\nand S1 protein partial [SARS coronavirus GD322] as homologs. Pairwise\nsequence alignments of the three sequences show that although the\nspike proteins of all three CoV are highly similar they are not identical\n(Figure 2A, horizontal\narrows), which may be the reason for the higher binding affinity of\nthe COVID-19 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. Homology modeling\nof SARS-CoV-2 RBD subdomain-1 (319th to 591st aa) in the SWISS-MODEL\nautomated server developed a template-based model of the SARS-CoV-2\nspike glycoprotein with a single receptor-binding domain in the up\nconfiguration (Figure 2A1) with 100% sequence identity. Of the other template-based models\ndeveloped, it expectedly showed a model of the structure of the SARS-CoV\nspike glycoprotein, conformation 2 with about 74% sequence identity\n(Figure 2B, B1), which\nshows them to be structurally and evolutionarily related.\n\nThe dissemination of COVID-19 in\nthe systemic circulation or across\nthe cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone (Figure 1) during an early or later phase of the infection\ncan lead to cerebral involvement as has been reported in the past\nfor SARS-CoV affected patients.3 The presence\nof the COVID-19 virus in the general circulation understandably enables\nit to pass into the cerebral circulation (Figure 1A\u2013C) where the sluggish movement of\nthe blood within the microcirculation could be one of the factors\nthat may facilitate the interaction of the COVID-19 virus spike protein\nwith ACE2 expressed in the capillary endothelium. Subsequent budding\nof the viral particles from the capillary endothelium and damage to\nthe endothelial lining can favor viral access to the brain (Figure 1B). Once within the\nmilieu of the neuronal tissues, its interaction with ACE2 receptors\n(Figure 1C, D) expressed\nin neurons2 can initiate a cycle of viral\nbudding accompanied by neuronal damage without substantial inflammation\nas has been seen with cases of SARS-CoV3 in the past. It is important to mention here that, long before the\nproposed anticipated neuronal damages occur, the endothelial ruptures\nin cerebral capillaries accompanied by bleeding within the cerebral\ntissue can have fatal consequences in patients with COVID-19 infections.\nThe movement of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the cribriform\nplate close to the olfactory bulb can be an additional pathway that\ncould enable the virus to reach and affect the brain. Additionally,\nthe findings like an altered sense of smell or hyposmia in an uncomplicated\nearly stage COVID-19 patient should be investigated thoroughly for\nCNS involvement.\n\nAutopsies of the COVID-19 patients, detailed neurological investigation,\nand attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from the endothelium of cerebral\nmicrocirculation, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, and neuronal tissue\ncan clarify the role played by this novel COVID-19 causing coronavirus\nin the ongoing mortalities as has been in the recent outbreak. It\nis important to mention here that although the cerebral damage may\ncomplicate a COVID-19 infection, it appears that it is the widespread\ndysregulation of homeostasis caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac,\nand circulatory damage that proves fatal in COIVD-19 patients. With\nthat being said, a dominant cerebral involvement alone with the potential\nof causing cerebral edema in COVID-19 can take a lead in causing death\nlong before systemic homeostatic dysregulation sets in. Access of\nthe COVID-19 virus to the brain via the transcribrial route, as described\npreviously for other CNS targeting pathogens,7 could have been the case in a recently reported patient with hyposmia\nand the cases of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19,5 which needs to be further elucidated by isolating\nthe SARS-CoV-2 virus from the zones that are in proximity to the olfactory\nbulb. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike\nproteins between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV (Figure 2A) will enable scientists to identify epitopes\nin COVID-19 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against\nthis virus. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent\nneed to understand the neurotropic potential of the COVID-19 virus\nin order to prioritize and individualize the treatment protocols based\non the severity of the disease and predominant organ involvement.\nAlso, a staging system based on the severity and organ involvement\nis needed in COVID-19 in order to rank the patients for aggressive\nor conventional treatment modalities."}
