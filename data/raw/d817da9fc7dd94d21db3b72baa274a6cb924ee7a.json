{"title": "Isotype-speci\u00aec antibody-secreting cells in systemic and mucosal associated lymphoid tissues and antibody responses in serum of conventional pigs inoculated with PEDV", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an important pathogen causing severe gastroenteritis with a clinical picture similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). PEDV has been classi\u00aeed in group I of the Coronaviridae family, which also includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and human respiratory coronavirus 229E (HCV229E) (Cavanagh et al., 1994; Murphy et al., 1999) .\n\nPorcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) was \u00aerst described in Great Britain in 1971 (Oldham, 1972) , and nowadays the virus is widely distributed throughout Europe and Asia, although has not been detected in America. In Spain, a serological survey carried out in 1993\u00b11994 detected antibodies against the virus in 54% of the breeding herds (Carvajal et al., 1995b) . Moreover, over the last 4 years the virus has been found in a high percentage of the clinical cases of diarrhoea analysed at our laboratory. These data indicate that PEDV is currently one of the most important causes of gastroenterical disorders in pigs in Spain, which seems to be the same case in other countries (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994) .\n\nClinically, the disease can appear in two forms, PED Type I, which affects only pigs older than 4\u00b15 weeks, and PED Type II, which affects pigs of all ages. Both are characterised by profuse, watery diarrhoea, depression and anorexia. Morbidity is high, close to 100%, but mortality rate is relatively low in adult pigs (3%), whereas not in suckling piglets among which the severity of the disease increases and mortality can reach 90% (Pensaert, 1999) .\n\nThe epithelium of the small intestine and the colon is the site for virus replication and although the presence of viral antigen in the mesenteric lymph nodes has been described, there is no evidence of virus replication in tissues other than in those in the gastroenteric tract. Infection of the enterocytes causes vacuolisation and \u00aenally destruction, which leads to villous atrophy and watery diarrhoea due to malabsorcion.\n\nSo far, there is no effective vaccine or speci\u00aec treatment available, and the only measures to control the disease are those directed to preventing the entrance of the virus on the farm (Pensaert, 1999) . The development of immunological strategies in order to induce protection would be desirable, mainly those involving the protection of suckling piglets less than 2\u00b13 weeks old. Little has been reported relating to the immunological aspects of the disease other than detection of serum antibodies against the virus in convalescent animals (Carvajal et al., 1995a; Van Niewstadt and Zetstra, 1991; Debouck and Pensaert, 1984) . However, due to the special features of the mucosal immune system of the pigs, the presence of serum antibodies against gastroenteric pathogens is not always correlated with protection (Saif and Wesley, 1999; Saif, 1996; Saif et al., 1994 , To \u00c3 et al., 1998 Ward et al., 1996) and only proves the contact with the microorganism.\n\nIn the present work, we have tried to contribute to the information on the immune mechanisms occurring after PEDV infection by making a \u00aerst approach to the characterisation of the antibody response generated by the virus. Considering the fact that in the enteric infections in porcine is the local immunity which plays the main role in protection instead of the systemic immunity, as previously mentioned, the \u00aerst step was to develop techniques to investigate the immune response to PEDV in different tissues. Finally, we tried to emulate a natural infection by inoculating conventional pigs with a virulent strain of PEDV and monitorised the humoral response in different locations of the lymphoid system, involving gut associated lymphoid tissues as well as systemic tissues.\n\nThe wild type isolated of the CV-777 strain of PEDV, kindly provided by Dr. Peansert (Gent, Belgium) was ampli\u00aeed by passages in conventional 1-week-old piglets without antibodies against PEDV. Animals were orally inoculated and sacri\u00aeced in the acute phase of diarrhoea, collecting the intestinal contains and the small intestine. The small intestine from each animal was macerated in PBS (1:2 (w/v)) and, like the intestinal contains, clari\u00aeed by centrifugation at 5000 \u00c2 g for 20 min at 4 8C. Finally, all the fractions were pooled and stored at \u00c070 8C.\n\nThe cell-culture adapted PEDV, strain CV-777, was propagated in Vero cells as previously described (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . Brie\u00afy, Vero cells were grown with Eagle's minimum essential medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) buffered with bicarbonate and supplemented with 5% (v/v) foetal calf serum (Gibco), 0.04% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco, MI, USA), streptomycin (10 mg/l) and penicillin (10,000 UI/l) (Penicillin-streptomycin, Gibco). Con\u00afuent monolayers were infected by removing the growth medium and adding the viral inoculum diluted in medium without foetal calf serum but containing 10 ml/ml trypsin (Difco).\n\nIn order to standardise the ELISPOT, three conventional 4-week-old pigs were hyperimmunisated and used as a source of lymphocytes primed against PEDV. Pigs were orally inoculated with a suspension of the virulent, wild type, PEDV and boostered 4 and 12 weeks later by peritoneal injection of the same inoculum concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 10 000 \u00c2 g and diluted (1:1) in Freund's adjuvant (complete in the \u00aerst injection and incomplete in the second) with antibiotics (gentamycin: 500 mg/ml (Gibco), streptomycin: 20 mg/ml, penicillin: 20,000 UI/ml (Penicillin-streptomycin, Gibco)). Serum samples were taken weekly after the \u00aerst inoculation to monitorise the antibody production. Once a high serum antibody titter was reached, blood samples were collected periodically in 25% (v/v) acid citrate glucose to obtain the mononuclear cells (MNC). Finally, the pigs were sacri\u00aeced and the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were aseptically collected. As a negative control, blood samples from PEDV seronegative conventional pigs were collected in the same manner.\n\nA total number of 28 conventional pigs, seronegative to PEDV and from a herd with no previous history of the disease, were weaned at 11\u00b112 days of age and maintained in isolation facilities. Pigs were inoculated orally with 3 ml of the virulent CV-777, a dose previously established which assesses a high rate of infection and the effective development of the immune response but without causing mortality among the pigs. The animals were observed daily for clinical signs and rectal swabs from all of them were taken for 11 days after the inoculation. Blood samples were also collected twice a week until the end of the experiment. At postinoculation days (PID) 4, 7, 14, 21, 25 and 31, 4\u00b15 selected pigs were euthanised by a sodic penthotal injection (Eutalender, Normon, Madrid, Spain). The small intestine (duodenum and ileum), spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and blood were aseptically collected for isolation of MNC.\n\nThree conventional, seronegative, pigs served as negative controls and were sacri\u00aeced without previous inoculation.\n\nAn ELISA that combines the use of two monoclonal antibodies (Mab) against the S protein of PEDV (CVI-PEDV 66.31 and 66.49) and a blocking step with rabbit-anti PEDV hyperimmune serum or gut-origin PEDV, was carried out as previously described (Carvajal et al., 1995a) to detect speci\u00aec antibodies in serum or viral antigen in rectal swab samples, respectively.\n\nAntibody isotypes IgG and IgA to PEDV in serum samples were detected and titrated using an indirect ELISA as previously described (de Arriba et al., 1994) . Antigen was obtained from PEDV infected cell culture supernatants that were lysated, concentrated 50 times by ultracentrifugation (100 000 \u00c2 g, 4 8C, 2 h) and semi-puri\u00aeed by ultracentrifugation under the same conditions through 20% sucrose. Mock-infected cultures were given the same treatment in order to obtain a control antigen. Viral or control antigens were immunocapturated in polystyrene microtiter plates (Costar, MA, USA) previously coated with the Mab CVI-PEDV-66.31. In the next step, serial 2-fold dilutions, starting at 1:20, of each serum sample were incubated in paired wells, containing viral or control antigen. Two biotinylated Mabs 3H7 (80 ng/ml) and 6D11 (65 ng/ml) against porcine IgG and IgA, respectively (Paul et al., 1989) , followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (KPL, MD, USA) and ABTS substrate were used for the detection of both isotypes of antibodies. Titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the lowest positive sample dilution and titres <20 were assigned a value of 10 for calculation of geometric mean titre (GMT).\n\nMNC were isolated from MLN, blood, spleen and the lamina propria of the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) by using modi\u00aecations of previously described methods (Chen et al., 1995; Van Cott et al., 1993; Yuan et al., 1996) .\n\nBlood was collected aseptically in 25% (v/v) acid citrate glucose and the peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Ficoll-Paque Research Grade, Pharmacia Biotech., Upsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation. Lymphocytes collected from the interface were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in enriched medium (RPMI 1640 containing 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential aminoacids, 20 mM HEPES, and 20 mg of ampicillin and 100 mg of gentamicin per millilitre).\n\nSpleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and two fragments of the small intestine (one from duodenum and the other from ileum) were collected aseptically and placed in ice-cold wash medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM HEPES and 200 mg of gentamicin and 20 mg ampicillin per ml). Spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were homogenised pressing through stainless steel screens (80 mesh) of a cell collector (Cell-Selector, E-C Apparatus, FLA, USA). Cell suspensions were placed in a 30% Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech.) solution and centrifugated at 1200 \u00c2 g for 30 min at 4 8C. The resulting pellets were subjected to a discontinuous gradient centrifugation in Percoll: the cells were resuspended in 43% Percoll, underlined with 70% Percoll and centrifuged at 1800 \u00c2 g for 20 min at 4 8C. Finally, the MNC were aspirated from the Percoll interface, washed twice with wash medium and suspended in enriched medium.\n\nFragments of approximately 20 g of duodenum and ileum were cut in small pieces, washed twice with wash solution and twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. In order to remove epithelial cells, the tissues were placed in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM EDTA and vigorously shaken for 30 min. Tissues were then digested for two 31-min periods at 37 8C in gentle shaking with enriched medium containing 400 UI of Type II collagenase (Sigma, MO, USA) per millilitre and 5 mM EDTA. Digested supernatants were collected and the remaining tissues were pressed through the stainless steel 80-mesh screens. The single cellular suspensions obtained were pooled with the digested supernatants and subjected to the gradient centrifugation in Percoll as described for mesenteric lymph nodes and splenic MNC. Viability of all MNC preparations was proved by the trypan blue exclusion test, being in any case higher than 95%.\n\nTwo different kind of plates were assayed to set up the ELISPOT, on one hand PEDV infected and \u00aexed cell monolayers and on the other, semi-puri\u00aeed antigen that was immunocaptured in plates previously coated with a Mab against the S protein of the virus.\n\nVero cells, grown in 96-well tissue culture plates, were inoculated with the cell culture adapted PEDV as described (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . After incubation at 37 8C in a humid incubator with 5% CO 2 , plates were \u00aexed in 80% acetone in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and stored at \u00c020 8C. Different dilutions were tested in order to \u00aend the optimal multiplicity of infection to yield over 90% of infected cells. Control plates were mock-inoculated and treated in the same way.\n\nOptimal antigenic expression was veri\u00aeed in every batch of plates by indirect immunouorescence using the Mab 113B, directed to the S protein of the PEDV and kindly provided by Dr. M. Ackermann (Zurich, Switzerland). Only the plates showing more than 80% of\u00afuorescent surface were used to perform the ELISPOT.\n\nNinety-six-well microtiter plates were coated and dilutions of viral or control antigen were immunocaptured as described for the isotype ELISA.\n\nThe ELISPOT technique was based on previously published methods (Chen et al., 1995; Czerkinsky et al., 1983, Sedgwick and Holt, 1983; Van Cott et al., 1993; Yuan et al., 1996) modi\u00aeed and adapted by us for the detection of PEDV-speci\u00aec antibody secreting cells (ASC).\n\nFixed cell plates were thawed and rehydrated by incubation with PBS for 5 min at room temperature while antigen captured plates were washed three times before use in the ELISPOT. Different amounts of MNC (5 \u00c2 10 3 , 5 \u00c2 10 4 and 5 \u00c2 10 5 ) from each tissue were added to duplicate wells of the \u00aexed-PEDV infected or mock-infected cell plates or to the plates with the immunocaptured antigen (viral and control antigen). Plates were centrifuged at low speed 50 \u00c2 g for 5 min and incubated at 37 8C with 5% CO 2 for different periods. In order to remove the cells and between steps, the plates were washed 5 times with 0.05% Tween 20-PBS (PBST). The antibody production was detected by using biotinylated mouse Mabs 3H7 (80 ng/ml) and 6D11 (65 ng/ml) against porcine IgG and IgA, respectively (Paul et al., 1989) and goat anti-porcine IgM serum (1:20,000, KPL) diluted in PBST. After 2 h incubation at room temperature, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (KPL) was added (1:20,000) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the spots were developed by tetramethylbencidine (TMB) with H 2 O 2 membrane peroxidase substrate system (KPL) and counted under an optic microscope. Counts were averaged from the duplicated wells at the dilutions showing less than 40 spots per well and were expressed relative to 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC. Working conditions were optimised to detect the highest number of speci\u00aec spots against PEDV.\n\nThe in vitro viral stimulation technique was modi\u00aeed from published methods (Van Cott et al., 1993 . MNC puri\u00aeed from spleen, blood and mesenteric lymph nodes were diluted in enriched medium containing 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME-enriched medium) (Sigma) to 5 \u00c2 10 6 MNC per millilitre. 750 ml of each cell preparation were added to two consecutive wells of a 12-well tissue culture plate and stimulated with semi-puri\u00aeed PEDV viral antigen, prepared as described for the isotype ELISA and diluted in 750 ml of the 2ME-enriched medium. Plates were maintained in a humid incubator with 5% CO 2 for 5 days and, from the second day on, 500 ml per well of fresh 2ME-enriched medium were added. On the \u00aefth day, MNC were harvested, rinsed twice with wash medium, suspended in 2ME-enriched medium and tested by ELISPOT (testing 5 \u00c2 10 2 , 5 \u00c2 10 3 and 5 \u00c2 10 4 MNC per well).\n\nKruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance was used to prove statistically signi\u00aecant differences in the number of ASC between different days. Antibody GMT were compared by means of Student t-test at each point in time. Signi\u00aecance was assessed at p < 0:05. For the analysis the SYSTAT for Windows v.5.03 (SYSTAT) and the spreadsheet Microsoft EXCEL v.7.0 (Microsoft) were used.\n\nPigs inoculated with the virulent isolate of the PEDV strain CV-777 exhibited moderate signs of the disease, mainly semi-liquid diarrhoea, shown in 32% of the pigs. The onset of the diarrhoea was between PID 2 and 4 and its average duration was 1.7 days. Rectal virus shedding was detected by blocking-ELISA in 100% of the PEDV exposed animals. Viral antigen was present in faecal samples from PID 1 to 8, but most of the pigs shed the virus in faeces between PID 3 and 6. The average duration of the shedding period was 5.4 days and the peak of the GMT of viral antigen in rectal swabs was at PID 5 ( Fig. 1) .\n\nAfter inoculation with virulent PEDV, seroconversion was demonstrated in 100% of the pigs by blocking ELISA. Speci\u00aec antibodies were detected in 52.6% of the pigs at PID 4, in 96% at PID 7 and in 100% at PID 12.\n\nThe isotype-speci\u00aec ELISA antibody titters in the serum of inoculated piglets are shown in Fig. 2 . Titters of IgG increased signi\u00aecantly from PID 12 over the duration of the experiment, reaching the maximum at that moment (PID 32, GMT 2650). IgA serum \n\nOptimal antigenic expression with the infected and \u00aexed cell monolayers was obtained by inoculating 2:8 \u00c2 10 3\u00afu orescent focus-forming units of viral inoculum per well and \u00aexing the plates after 12\u00b115 h of incubation. These conditions guaranteed a citopatic effect between 80 and 90%, which gave a very high rate of\u00afuorescence, but keeping the integrity of the monolayer.\n\nPlates with the immunocaptured antigen yielded the best results when the semi-puri\u00aeed viral antigen diluted 1:25 was used (2.05 mg of protein per well) and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 8C or overnight at 4 8C.\n\nUsing infected and \u00aexed cell monolayers unspeci\u00aec spots were non-detected either in the plates with mock-infected cell monolayers or with MNC from na\u00f5 \u00c8ve piglets and, therefore, every spot detected was considered a positive result. On the other hand, plates with the immunocaptured antigen showed some unspeci\u00aec spots in the control wells and also when MNC from negative pigs were tested. Moreover, a higher number of spots were usually detected when the assay was performed over infected and \u00aexed cell monolayers.\n\nConsequently, due to the high speci\u00aecity shown for the \u00aexed PEDV infected cell plates and its higher sensitivity, we decided to use these plates for the rest of the experiments. In every assay mock-infected plates were included as negative control to assess the speci\u00aecity. \n\nIn order to evaluate the distribution of PEDV-speci\u00aec ASC, MNC from mesenteric lymph nodes, lamina propria of duodenum and ileum, spleen and blood were recovered at various PID from PEDV exposed pigs and tested for antibody production by ELISPOT. Kinetics of those responses are summarised in Figs. 3\u00b15 and Table 1 .\n\nNo virus-speci\u00aec ASC were detected by ELISPOT either with the control pigs or when the assay was performed with mock-infected cell plates.\n\nPEDV-speci\u00aec IgM ASC were the predominant response between PID 4 and PID 7. At PID 4 speci\u00aec IgM ASC were found in all the tissues with the only exception in the blood, the strongest response corresponded to the intestinal lamina propria, where the number of IgM ASC was 6\u00b17-fold greater than in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. At PID 7, the number of IgM ASC declined in the duodenum and the ileum, but not in mesenteric lymph nodes and systemic tissues (spleen and blood) and at PID 14 blood was the only tissue in which these cells were detected.\n\nAlthough some IgA ASC were detected as early as PID 7 in duodenum lamina propria, the IgG and IgA ASC responses in the intestinal lymphoid tissues were evident from PID 21 on. IgG ASC were demonstrated in the three tissues at PID 21, being maximum in the duodenum (Fig. 4, 23 .5 IgG ASC per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC). From this day and until the end of the experiment, the number of IgG ASC declined in the duodenum, but not in the mesenteric lymph nodes, where maximum was reached on PID 32. Although no signi\u00aecant statistical difference was demonstrated, the number of IgA ASC detected in the intestinal lymphoid tissues by ELISPOT was, in general, lower than the number of IgG ASC. The highest IgA ASC response was also observed in the duodenum, where these cells were shown on PID 7, 21 and 25. The lowest response was obtained in ileum, in which IgA ASC were demonstrated only in a limited number at PID 25 (<1 IgA ASC per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC) (Fig. 5) .\n\nThe number of IgG ASC in spleen and blood was lower than in the intestinal lymphoid tissues and these cells were evidenced later, between PID 25 and 32. A slow number of IgA ASC were detected in the spleen, but only at PID 14. However, in the blood, the presence of IgA ASC was proved from PID 14 until the end of the experiment on PID 32.\n\nDue to the individual variability in the responses observed and mainly to the limited number of pigs used at each point in time, statistical comparison among tissues or days showed no signi\u00aecant differences.\n\nMNC were stimulated in vitro with different amounts of virus and over different periods. The best results were obtained when culturing the cells for 5 days with 4.6 ml (238.6 ng of protein) of the semi-puri\u00aeed viral antigen per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC.\n\nIn vitro stimulation of the cells was only possible with the MNC from mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood, but not with those from the intestinal lamina propria since they had an irregular survival due to their frequent contamination with the enteric microbial ora.\n\nResults from the secondary immune response obtained after the in vitro stimulation are summarised in Table 2 . Even though low numbers of IgM ASC were detected on PID 4, secondary antibody response was more prominent on PID 21 and 25, consisting of IgG and IgA ASC. The number of speci\u00aec ASC increased from 38 to 1137 times after the secondary stimulation and in a similar way to the primary responses, IgG ASC were predominant in the systemic tissues (spleen and blood), whereas not in the MLN, in which the secondary IgA ASC response was higher at PID 21. In vitro stimulation of na\u00f5 \u00c8ve MNC from the control group did not yield virus-speci\u00aec ASC after 5 days of culture. Table 1 Numbers of isotype-specific ASC to PEDV (per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC) in duodenum and ileum lamina propria, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen and blood from pigs experimentally exposed to the virulent isolate of the PEDV strain CV-777 and sacrificed on PID 4, 7, 14, 21, 25 \n\nIn the present work, we have made a characterisation of the humoral immune response occurring after the infection with PEDV. The study was carried out with conventional pigs, infected with a virulent, wild type isolate of the virus, with the aim of emulating the natural conditions in which the infection took place. Experimental models were 12-day-old, PEDV seronegative piglets. No older animals were used due to the high growth rhythm of porcines, which makes it very dif\u00aecult to handle a large number of pigs for an extended period. However, these young animals, in spite of having a non-totally-mature-immune system, are immunocompetent from the birth and are capable of developing a complete immune response (Roth, 1999) .\n\nVirulent PEDV caused moderate to severe diarrhea in 30% of the inoculated piglets with a average duration of 1.7 days. The incidence and severity of the disease in our experiment was lower than previously described by other authors (Carvajal et al., 1995a; Debouck and Pensaert, 1984; Debouck et al., 1981) who found that almost 100% of the inoculated piglets, gnotobiotic and conventional, developed diarrhea over an average period of 7\u00b110 days. This difference may be explained by the low dose of virus used in our experiment. This dose was experimentally determined in previous assays in order to guarantee infection but without causing severe disease, in order that immune response could be developed and detected in the piglets. However, viral antigen was detected in faeces of all the pigs for the average period of 5.4 days, starting between PID 1 and 3, as it has been described in similar experiments (Carvajal et al., 1995a) .\n\nSpeci\u00aec antibodies against PEDV were demonstrated by blocking ELISA in 100% of the inoculated pigs between PID 4 and 12. This result is closely related with previous studies which report seroconversion 1 week after PEDV infection (Carvajal et al., 1995a; Van Niewstadt and Zetstra, 1991) . Although PEDV-IgG antibodies were always the predominant response in blood, in consistence with the patron for distribution of the different immunoglobulin isotypes, an important IgA response was detected in blood from PID 15\u00b125, simultaneous to the detection of IgA ASC in blood. These results indicate that even blood is not considered an important source of the typically mucosal-associated Table 2 Numbers of isotype-specific ASC to PEDV (per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC) after in vitro secondary stimulation of the MNC isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen and blood of conventional pigs experimentally exposed to the virulent isolate of the PEDV strain 7, 14, 21, 25 IgM  IgA  IgG  IgM  IgA  IgG  IgM  IgA  IgG   4 11 (44) 0.7 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 22 (36) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 8 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 7 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 14 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0.8 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 21 0 (\u00b1) 44 (35) 38 (14) 0 (\u00b1) 220 (\u00b1) 586 (\u00b1) 0 (\u00b1) 29 (46) 267 (2136) 25 0 (\u00b1) 156 (\u00b1) 1137 (247) 0 (\u00b1) 7 (\u00b1) 97 (34) 0 (\u00b1) 49 (163) 1038 (478) a ASC after secondary in vitro stimulation/ASC after primary in vivo stimulation is given within the parenthesis. immunoglobulin. Its detection is possible in the early stages after infection, probably in relation to the lymphocyte homing process (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999; Kagnoff, 1996; Kantele et al., 1997; Salmi and Jalkanen, 1997) .\n\nIn order to standardise ELISPOT, two different kinds of antigenated plates were compared, infected and \u00aexed cell culture plates and semi-puri\u00aeed antigen immunocaptured plates. In spite of the fact that no statistical studies were carried out, ELISPOT performed with infected cell culture plates gave better results in terms of sensitivity and speci\u00aecity. In the immunocaptured plates we used a Mab directed against S-protein of PEDV and, therefore, most of the viral antigen captured in the plate could be fragments of the spike more than the complete viral particle. On the other hand, viral inoculum for peritoneal immunisation of the animals was concentrated using ultracentrifugation and may then induce a high immune response against N and M protein which could be better detected with the infected and \u00aexed cell plates.\n\nUsing the ELISPOT, we demonstrated the early development of a primary speci\u00aec immune response against PEDV, formerly IgM ASC followed by IgG and IgA ASC responses. PEDV-speci\u00aec IgM ASC were detected in all tissues between PID 4 and 7, with this response being higher and faster in duodenum and ileum lamina propria than in the other tissues, including mesenteric lymph nodes. The earlier presence of speci\u00aec ASC in these tissues could be related to its anatomic proximity to the virus replication site in the enterocytes of the small intestine. The antigen could be delivered immediately to the lamina propria where it would stimulate the local immune response whereas its diffusion to the mesenteric lymph nodes would be more delayed (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999; Kagnoff, 1996; Kraehenbuhl and Neutra, 1992; .\n\nAfter this initial response, there was no important detection of PEDV-ASC in the intestine or mesenteric lymph nodes until PID 21. Maximum values of ASC were reached between PID 21 and 32, at the end of the experiment. Similar experiences with other porcine enteric viruses such as TGEV or rotavirus (Chen et al., 1995; Van Cott et al., 1993; Yuan et al., 1996) showed consistent IgA and IgG ASC responses as early as PID 12, with the maximum amounts of cells detected also being higher than those described in the report. This difference could be due to a lower sensitivity of the ELISPOT performed for PEDV which would not detect low numbers of speci\u00aec-IgA and IgG ASC present in the \u00aerst weeks after the infection. We also have to consider that experiences with rotavirus were carried out with gnotobiotic pigs in which the antigen-speci\u00aec ASC/total ASC ratio is higher than in conventional animals. However, at least for TGEV, we cannot rule out the possibility of a higher antigenic stimulation as compared with PEDV.\n\nAlthough duodenum registered the highest number of speci\u00aec-IgG and IgA ASC of the three mucosal associated lymphoid tissues, we consider that this result is more related to the distribution and organisation of the intestinal lymphoid tissue than to real differences in the immune response between tissues. MNC puri\u00aeed from duodenal lamina propria belong to the diffuse lymphoid tissue, in which most of the cells, mainly the lymphocytes, are mature and active (Kraehenbuhl and Neutra, 1992; Pescovitz, 1999) . On the other hand, MNC from ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes also include large numbers of naive cells from the germinal centres of the lymph nodes or the Peyer patches that were not removed from the ileum (Heel et al., 1997; Pescovitz, 1999) .\n\nAs a constant in our results, the number of IgG ASC in gut associated tissues was higher than the number of IgA ASC. This fact has also been described in previous reports (Van Cott et al., 1993; Yuan et al., 1996 Yuan et al., , 1998 studying immunity by ELISPOT in TGEV and rotavirus infections. Even though there is no clear explanation for this fact, the possibility of extraintestinal stimulation of the immune system has been proposed. However, PEDV has only been located in mesenteric lymph nodes apart from the intestinal mucosa (Debouck et al., 1981; Pensaert, 1999) and the possibility of systemic stimulation is very low. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate this question.\n\nWith regard to the response detected in the systemic lymph tissues and mainly in the blood, our results showed the presence of speci\u00aec IgA ASC at PID 14, earlier than in mucosal associate lymphoid tissues. As mentioned previously, we explain this \u00aending as a consequence of the lymphocyte homing, a process in which the lymphocytes migrate through the blood to the efector sites, such as the intestinal lamina propria, after completing its maturating in distal sites of the mucosal immune system (Corthesy and Kraehenbuhl, 1999; Kagnoff, 1996; Kantele et al., 1997; Salmi and Jalkanen, 1997) . Thus, at least shortly after the infection, the PEDV speci\u00aec ASC present in the blood could be considered more related to the response in mucosal associated lymph tissues than to the systemic response.\n\nSecondary in vitro stimulation of the MNC from inoculated piglets was performed in order to determine the potential B-cell memory response after PEDV infection. No speci\u00aec-ASC was evidenced after the secondary in vitro stimulation of MNC obtained from control animals with no previous contact with PEDV. This result con\u00aerms, as it has been described for other virus (Berthon et al., 1990; Van Cott et al., 1993; Yuan et al., 1996) , that only previously in vivo stimulated cells are capable of developing a speci\u00aec response when stimulated in vitro with PEDV antigen. Moreover, a limited number of IgM ASC were detected at PID 4, memory B cells appeared consistently at PID 21 in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood from PEDV infected pigs. Similar results have been found after oral inoculation of pigs with porcine rotavirus while in TGEV infected animals speci\u00aec B memory cells were detected from PID 12 (Van Cott et al., 1993) . Again, the number of PEDV\u00b1ASC per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC after secondary in vitro stimulation were lower than reported by Van Cott et al. (1993) in similar studies for TGEV. As we have suggested for the in vivo response, this difference could be attributed either to a lower sensitivity of the ELISPOT performed with PEDV or to differences in the immune response against each virus. In agreement with other authors (Berthon et al., 1990; Van Cott et al., 1993 and as described for the in vivo stimulated ASC, clear predominance of PEDV-speci\u00aec IgG ASC was observed in systemic lymphoid tissues, blood and spleen, but not in the mesenteric lymph nodes where, at PID 21, IgA ASC outnumbered IgG ASC although reverse circumstances occurred at PID 25.\n\nTo sum up, a \u00aerst attempt has been made to study the immune response developed in conventional piglets after infection with PEDV. This report shows the presence of speci\u00aec-ASC from the different isotypes and in several locations of gut associated and systemic lymphoid tissues and also describes the IgA and IgG kinetics in serum. In addition, our study shows the presence of speci\u00aec memory B cells from the third week after infection. Present results have important implications for future studies of immunity and protection against PEDV infection and consequently in the development and evaluation of future immunopro\u00aelactic strategies to prevent and control the disease."}
