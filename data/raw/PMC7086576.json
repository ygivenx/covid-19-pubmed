{"title": "Optimized DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing of airborne microbial communities", "body": "Particulate matter collection (Steps 1\u20135). To choose the location for collecting particulate matter samples, one should consider the target airborne microbial community to be studied. For collecting atmospheric particulate matter samples, locations without major interference sources nearby are recommended. For example, in our previous study8, we were interested in the atmospheric airborne microbial community, and hence the PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with nominal mean aerodynamic diameters of \u22642.5 and \u226410 \u03bcm, respectively) samples were collected from the rooftop of a two-story building on Tsinghua University campus, a site that has been used to monitor atmospheric air pollution in Beijing since 1999 (refs. 20, 21, 22). Particulate matter can be collected on 20.32 cm \u00d7 25.4 cm Tissuquartz filters that have 99.9% typical aerosol retention efficiency. Sample collection can be conducted by high-volume air samplers with an average air flow rate of 1.13 m3/min (Fig. 2a), the inlets of which have been shown to be effective with wind speeds of up to 24 km/h (ref. 23). This results in \u223c1,559 m3 of air flow-through per sampling day (typically 23 h, allowing 1 h for changing filters), which is important to ensure a sufficient mass of input sample (typically in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams) to be collected. In our previous study8, we used a total of three high-volume air samplers: two of which were equipped with PM2.5 fractionating inlets and one with a PM10 fractionating inlet (Fig. 2b,c). Weigh each filter before and after sampling (Fig. 2d), and all samples can be used immediately or stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the next step.\n\nSample pretreatment (Steps 6\u201312). Owing to the low mass of collectable particulate matter samples and the DNA-binding properties of silica fibers in the Tissuquartz filter, we designed a series of sample pretreatment steps to optimize the yield of genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Considering the different mass of input materials from the collected PM2.5 and PM10 samples, we typically use one-fourth of a PM10 filter (\u223c103.04 cm2) and 1.5 or 2 pieces of PM2.5 filters (collected by two samplers on the same day) for sample pretreatment and subsequent DNA extraction. The filters are cut into four equal-sized pieces (8.96 cm \u00d7 11.5 cm each; Fig. 2e), which are rolled and inserted into 50-ml Falcon tubes filled with sterilized 1\u00d7 PBS buffer (Fig. 2f). The particulate matter samples are then pelleted at 4 \u00b0C by low-speed centrifugation at 200g for 3 h. After brief, gentle vortexing, the resuspension is filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm Supor 200 PES Membrane Disc Filter (Fig. 2g,h). The above wash and filter recollection (pretreatment) steps are necessary to help separate most of the biological contents from the quartz filters before DNA extraction for improved extraction efficiency. In addition, the pretreatment of particulate matter sample reduces the sample volume needed for DNA extraction, and thus it allows the use of AMPure XP beads for genomic DNA extraction at a reasonable cost. Quantification of the recovered genomic DNA and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results suggested that the extraction efficiency of microbial DNA from particulate matter was optimized by applying the pretreatment step and by using AMPure XP beads compared with other methods (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). After the wash and filter recollection, we cut the PES Membrane Disc Filter into small pieces for DNA extraction using commercial kits. All the above steps should be carried out in a decontaminated biosafety cabinet.\n\nDNA extraction (Steps 13\u201324). A variety of DNA extraction kits for handling environmental samples have been developed. We recommend performing DNA extraction of pretreated particulate matter samples using the MO-BIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit, with a few key modifications to the manufacturer's instructions. First, the samples are heated to 65 \u00b0C (instead of at room temperature (25 \u00b0C)) in PowerBead tubes (included in the PowerSoil kit) for 15 min; this is followed by vortexing for 15 min. The remaining steps of the extraction are performed according to the standard PowerSoil DNA isolation protocol, except that the column purification is replaced by AMPure XP bead purification for improved DNA yield, as shown by comparisons between different extraction methods (Table 1 and Fig. 3a).\n\nQuantification and quality assessment of extracted genomic DNA (Step 25). The extracted genomic DNA should be checked for concentration and quality before library preparation. Because the concentrations of the extracted genomic DNA are typically below the reliable detection limit of common DNA quantification instruments such as the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (the detection limit of which is typically in the range of a few ng/\u03bcl), we recommend using a fluorescent double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding dye assay on the Qubit Fluorometer, which has a detection limit of dsDNA at 10\u2013100 pg/\u03bcl. The low concentrations of DNA also do not permit visualization on a regular agarose gel, and thus gel electrophoresis is not required. If needed, we recommend using the Lonza FlashGel system, which can be used to visualize DNA bands at quantities as low as 0.1 ng. qPCR of the genomic DNA samples using 16S rRNA gene universal primers can be used to assess the quality of the extracted DNA (a step that is recommended but not required). Amplification curves with lower threshold cycle (Ct) values suggest the presence of more bacterial DNA in the extracted genomic DNA and thus better sample quality. All the extracted DNA samples can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use.\n\nSequencing library preparation (Steps 26\u201334). Various high-throughput sequencing platforms can be used for metagenomic sequencing, and the library preparation methods vary accordingly24,25. We recommend using the Illumina sequencing platforms for the high data throughput and low per-base cost. The sequencing library construction and template preparation can be performed using the NEBNext ultra DNA library prep kit (by following the steps for input DNA <50 ng) or by using the modified protocol provided in this paper. In our previous study8, we constructed barcoded, paired-end libraries with an insert size of \u223c500 bp for each sample. To ensure sample consistency, the entire volume of extracted DNA sample, or an aliquot of 5 ng of DNA from each sample (for DNA samples >5 ng), is used for library preparation. The lowest quantity of input genomic DNA from which we have successfully prepared Illumina sequencing library was 3.84 ng (ref. 8). The quality of the libraries should be validated by the Agilent 2100 platform before Illumina sequencing; the existence of a single, wide peak at 500\u2013800 bp in electropherogram suggests good library quality (Fig. 3b\u2013d).\n\nDNA sequencing and data analysis (Steps 35 and 36). We recommend using the Illumina MiSeq platform for validating the quality of the above-prepared libraries by generating small data sets of 500 Mb\u20131 Gb for each sample (optional) and the HiSeq 2000 or 2500 sequencing platform for high-throughput sequencing. For HiSeq sequencing, each sample can be barcoded (added during library preparation), and equal quantities of barcoded libraries can be multiplexed during sequencing. The use of other alternative high-throughput sequencing platforms is possible, and the manufacturer's instructions on the library preparation and sequencing should be followed. Attention should be paid to the throughput and requirement of input genomic DNA. To appreciate the diversity and to sample a sufficient amount of microbial genes, we recommend generating at least 5\u20137 Gb of data per sample for the study of complex airborne microbial communities. Methods for data analysis vary greatly, depending on the specific needs of the study26,27,28, but they typically involve removal of the adapter sequences, low-quality reads and duplicate reads, followed by alignment or assembly of the short reads. For the purpose of identifying microbial species8, HiSeq reads are aligned to a cohort of nonredundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) complete genomes using the Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP) alignment tool29, which is typically faster to run than the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) or the BLAST-like Alignment Tool (BLAT). Genome coverage is calculated using the SOAP.coverage package.\n\nContamination prevention. Owing to the low mass and low biological content, particulate matter samples are sensitive to laboratory and other environmental contaminations, and thus extensive efforts to avoid contamination should be taken in the sample collection, pretreatment and DNA extraction steps. The Tissuquartz filters used for sample collection should be sterilized by baking in a muffle furnace at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h before sampling. The sterilized filters can be individually packaged in sterilized aluminum foil and stored in self-sealing plastic bags until use. The filter holder and all the tools used for changing new filters should also be cleaned with 75% (vol/vol) ethanol, or they should be autoclaved (if possible) every day to avoid cross-contamination. In the sample pretreatment and DNA extraction steps, the reusable scissors, forceps and filter funnels should be sterilized before use. The use of sterile surgical gloves and face masks is also recommended. To assess the degree of potential contamination, negative-control experiments should be conducted by placing a sterilized filter in the sampler without collecting a sample, followed by an identical sample pretreatment and DNA extraction process to that used when samples are collected.\n\n\nAbsolute ethanol (e.g., reagent alcohol; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 270741)CautionAbsolute ethanol is highly flammable.

Store the sterilized filters in self-sealing plastic bags.Before particulate matter collection, clean the gasket of the PM2.5 fractionating inlet and remove the deposited large particles with double-distilled water and 75% (vol/vol) ethanol. Clean the PM10 fractionating inlet if needed. Calibrate the PM2.5 and PM10 samplers to ensure that the flow rates are at 1.13 m3/min (\u00b110%).Take the Tissuquartz filters in aluminum foil out of the self-sealing plastic bags and weigh them on a precision balance at milligram accuracy.Load the Tissuquartz filters into the filter cartridge, secure the filter holder in the high-volume air sampler and start particulate matter collection for 23 h (Fig. 2a,d).Critical StepFrequently clean the PM2.5 and PM10 sampler inlet gaskets when you are sampling particulate matter at locations with high mass concentration; e.g., clean them once a day or every 2 d.After the sample collection is complete, unsecure the filter holder from the high-volume air sampler and transfer it into a biosafety cabinet immediately. Gently open the filter holder, pick up the filter with sterilized forceps and lay it flat on the aluminum foil. Fold the filter with the sample collection side facing inward, and then weigh it again.Critical StepUse sterile surgical gloves and wear face masks when you are handling the high-volume air sampler and the collected samples.Pause pointThe samples can be stored in self-sealing plastic bags at \u221280 \u00b0C for several months.\n\nSteps 6\u201312 should be carried out in a decontaminated biosafety cabinet.\n\n\n6Clean the outside surface of the self-sealing plastic bags containing the particulate matter samples with 75% ethanol (vol/vol) before putting it into the biosafety cabinet.7Open the self-sealing plastic bag in the biosafety cabinet, take out the aluminum foil from the bag and open it, and then unfold the filter with sterilized forceps.8Cut out one-quarter of the filter with sterilized scissors, roll it with sterilized forceps and insert the rolled-up filter into a 50-ml Falcon tube (Fig. 2e,f).Critical StepThe Tissuquartz filters are fragile, especially after freezing, and thus it is important to avoid extensive tearing of the filter membrane while cutting.9Add 50 ml of ultrapure 1\u00d7 PBS buffer into the tube, screw the lid on tightly and centrifuge it for 3 h at 200g at 4 \u00b0C to pellet the particulate matter.Critical Step200g is an optimized centrifugation speed. Centrifugation at too high a speed will result in disruption of the Tissuquartz filter, and thus it will lower the extraction efficiency.10Remove a piece of 0.2-\u03bcm Supor 200 PES membrane disc filter from its pack with sterilized forceps and put it onto the gauze of a sterilized filter funnel, screw the funnel on a 1-l glass bottle and connect the funnel to a vacuum pump. When you are using the magnetic filter funnel, connect the filter funnel to a 1-l filter flask connected to a vacuum pump (Fig. 2g).11After centrifugation, gently vortex the tube from Step 9 and pour the resuspension into the funnel from Step 10 without disturbing the collecting filter, and start suction filtration until all of the liquid filters through the PES filter (Fig. 2h).Critical StepControl the suction speed so that a volume of \u223c50 ml of buffer suspension goes through the PES filter in 1\u20132 min. We recommend air-drying the membrane briefly before cutting it into small pieces in the next step, as wet filter membranes tend to stick to the scissors.12Switch off the pump, transfer the PES filter into a sterilized culture dish with sterilized forceps, cut the filter into small pieces (\u223c0.20 cm2 each) with sterilized scissors and put them into a clean PowerBead tube from the MO-BIO PowerSoil DNA isolation kit.\n\n\nTiming 2 h13Extract DNA using the MO-BIO PowerSoil DNA isolation kit and Agencourt AMPure XP beads, modifying the manufacturer's instructions as detailed in the following steps. Add an aliquot of 60 \u03bcl of Solution C1 into each PowerBead tube containing the PES pieces, and incubate the tube in a water bath at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min.Critical StepScrew the cap of the PowerBead tube tightly to make sure that the tube does not dry up when heated in a water bath at 65 \u00b0C.14Secure the PowerBead tubes on a vortexer using the MO-BIO vortex adapter, and then vortex the tubes at maximum speed for 15 min. Alternatively, the tubes can be fastened onto an ordinary vortexer with tape.15Centrifuge PowerBead tubes at 10,000g for 30 s at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant from each tube to a clean 2-ml collection tube from the kit.Critical StepThe centrifuge speed should not exceed 10,000g, or it may damage the PowerBead tubes and cause leakage.16Add an aliquot of 250 \u03bcl of Solution C2 to each collection tube and vortex it briefly for 5 s. Incubate the mixture at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Centrifuge the tubes for 60 s at 10,000g at room temperature. The precipitate should appear black in color. Transfer the supernatant from each tube to a clean 2-ml collection tube, making sure to avoid the pellet.17Add an aliquot of 200 \u03bcl of Solution C3 to each collection tube and vortex it briefly. Incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Centrifuge the tubes for 60 s at 10,000g at room temperature. The precipitate should appear milk-white or white in color. Taking care to avoid the pellet, transfer the supernatant from all tubes into a clean 2-ml collection tube. Distribute the 700 \u03bcl supernatant equally into two 1.5-ml clean microcentrifuge tubes.18Vortex to mix the AMPure XP beads thoroughly at room temperature before use. Add 500 \u03bcl of AMPure XP beads to each tube, and mix thoroughly by pipetting ten times. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 5 min.Critical StepUse AMPure XP beads instead of a column to improve the DNA recovery efficiency.19Place the microcentrifuge tubes on a magnetic rack for 3 min until AMPure XP beads are separated from the solution, forming a plaque on the side of the microcentrifuge tube until the solution clears.20Aspirate the clear solution slowly from the microcentrifuge tubes and discard it, without disturbing the AMPure XP beads.21Add an aliquot of 500 \u03bcl of 70% (vol/vol) ethanol. Rinse the beads by turning the tubes 90\u00b0, and allow the beads to re-collect on the side of the tubes. Turn the tubes eight more times, and then discard the ethanol by aspiration. Repeat this wash step once.22Remove the microcentrifuge tubes from the magnetic rack. Quickly spin down the beads, and then place the microcentrifuge tubes back on the magnetic rack and remove any remaining liquid. Keep the microcentrifuge tubes on the magnetic rack with the cap open. Air-dry the beads at room temperature for 5 min.Critical StepDo not over dry the beads, as this can substantially affect the DNA recovery efficiency.23Remove the microcentrifuge tubes from the magnetic rack. Add an aliquot of 25 \u03bcl of DNase-free water to each of the two tubes and pipette to mix ten times. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 2 min.Critical StepThe use of 25 \u03bcl instead of a higher volume of ultrapure water for elution results in sufficient DNA concentration for downstream analysis and library preparation.24Place the microcentrifuge tubes onto the magnetic rack for 1 min to separate the beads from the solution. Transfer the combined eluate from both tubes to a new clean microcentrifuge tube.25Pipette 1 \u03bcl of the eluate from each tube, and quantify the DNA concentration using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer with the dsDNA HS assay kit. One may also perform qPCR (optional) using 16S rRNA gene universal primers, such as the 515F and 806R primer set30, using the following reagents and thermal cycling conditions:\nTroubleshooting\nPause pointThe extracted genomic DNA can be stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for several months, although repeated freeze-thawing of the sample is not recommended.\n\nThe following protocol is for library preparation for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq platforms. Library preparation for other alternative sequencing platforms should follow the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Pay attention to the amount of input DNA when choosing alternative library preparation and sequencing platforms.\n\n\n26Transfer the extracted genomic DNA solution of \u223c50 \u03bcl from Step 24 to a snap-cap microTUBE tube, and sonicate the sample using the S220 Focused-ultrasonicator using the parameters below:27Transfer the DNA sample from the microTUBE into a 0.2-ml nuclease-free PCR tube, and complete the end-repair, dA-tailing, adapter ligation and PCR reactions, as described below. Alternatively, one may use the NEBNext ultra DNA library prep kit for Illumina (by following the steps for <50 ng of input DNA) for the library preparation.28For end repair, first mix the following reagents in a 0.2-ml nuclease-free PCR tube and incubate the mixture in a thermal cycler for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C. Use a 1.6\u00d7 volume (80 \u03bcl) of AMPure XP beads to purify the end-repaired product before adding 43 \u03bcl of ultrapure water for dilution.Critical StepUse AMPure XP beads to improve the DNA recovery efficiency.29Take an aliquot of 42 \u03bcl of end-repaired product from Step 28 for adding the dA tail. Mix the following reagents in a 0.2-ml nuclease-free PCR tube and incubate the mixture in a thermal cycler for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Use a 1.6\u00d7 volume (80 \u03bcl) of AMPure XP beads to purify the product before adding 22 \u03bcl of ultrapure water for dilution.30Take an aliquot of 21 \u03bcl of the product from Step 29 for adapter ligation. Mix the following reagents in a 0.2-ml nuclease-free PCR tube and incubate the mixture in a thermal cycler for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C. Use a 1.0\u00d7 volume (50 \u03bcl) of AMPure XP beads to purify the product before adding 24 \u03bcl of ultrapure water for dilution.31Take an aliquot of 23 \u03bcl of the product from Step 30 for limited-cycle PCR. Mix the following reagents in a 0.2-ml nuclease-free PCR tube.Perform limited-cycle PCR using the following program:Critical StepPerform limited-cycle PCR (no more than 12 cycles) to avoid amplification bias and loss of sequence diversity.32After PCR, add a 0.5\u00d7 volume (25 \u03bcl) of AMPure XP beads to the reaction tube, mix well and incubate the tube at room temperature for 10 min. After incubation, transfer the mixture to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and place the tube on the magnetic rack to separate the beads from the supernatant. Wait for the solution to clear, before transferring the supernatant containing the library DNA to a new tube and discard the beads with the unwanted large DNA fragments.Critical StepAlthough other size-selection methods may be used, we recommend using the AMPure XP beads for optimized recovery efficiency. Pay particular attention to Steps 32 and 33, in which either the beads or the supernatant is discarded, respectively.33Add 5 \u03bcl of AMPure XP beads to the tube containing the supernatant from Step 32, mix them well and incubate the tube at room temperature for 10 min. Place the tube on a magnetic rack to separate the beads from the supernatant. Wait for the solution to clear, before discarding the supernatant with the unwanted small DNA fragments. Add 70% (vol/vol) ethanol to wash the beads twice. Air-dry the beads before adding 25 \u03bcl of ultrapure water to dilute the product.Critical StepDo not overdry the beads, as this can markedly affect the DNA recovery efficiency.34Take an aliquot of 1 \u03bcl of the product from Step 33, and analyze it on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to validate the library quality (Fig. 3b\u2013d).\nTroubleshooting\nPause pointThe prepared libraries can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for several months.\n\n\nTiming 8 d35Use the TruSeq PE cluster kit v3-cBot-HS for cluster generation and the TruSeq SBS kit v3-HS for sequencing with a 2 \u00d7 101 strategy.Critical StepBecause of the apparent sequence diversity of the airborne microbial community, we recommend generating at least 5\u20137 Gb of data per sample. When you are choosing other sequencing platforms, note that the quantity of available input airborne microbial genomic DNA is typically limited to 5\u201350 ng.36Remove the adapter sequences, low-quality reads and duplicate reads. For the analysis of microbial species, align the Illumina reads to a cohort of nonredundant NCBI complete genomes using the SOAP alignment tool (release 2.21t). Calculate the genome coverage using the SOAP.coverage package (version 2.7.7), in which only uniquely aligned reads are calculated. One can identify bacterial, fungal and viral species with coverage of \u22655%, \u22650.5% (average alignment of all chromosomes) and \u22651%, respectively.\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.\n\nSteps 1\u20135, day 1, particulate matter collection: 1 d\n\nSteps 6\u201312, day 2, sample pretreatment: 4 h\n\nSteps 13\u201325, day 2, DNA extraction: 2 h\n\nSteps 26\u201334, day 2, sequencing library preparation: 6 h\n\nSteps 35 and 36, days 3\u201310, DNA sequencing: 8 d\n\nThe protocol described here enables the extraction of airborne microbial genomic DNA from collected particulate matter for metagenomic sequencing. In our experience, most of the particulate matter samples collected daily in the city of Beijing weigh in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams, and each sample typically yields 5\u201350 ng of genomic DNA. By using the improved library preparation protocol described here, this quantity is sufficient for direct library preparation without requiring 16S rRNA gene amplification or whole-genome amplification. So far, we have applied this protocol to the extraction of airborne microbial genomic DNA from a total of 30 particulate matter samples (half of which were PM2.5 and the other half were PM10). \u223c90% of these samples yielded genomic DNA of \u22655 ng, were qPCR positive and produced good-quality sequencing libraries (Fig. 3). We show that although it is possible to extract DNA directly from the collected particulate matter samples by shredding the quartz filter without pretreatment, the extraction efficiency can be affected (Table 1, Fig. 3a), probably owing to the presence of DNA-binding quartz fibers. Moreover, extracting DNA using the MO-BIO PowerMax kit without pretreatment would require the use of >10-fold more AMPure XP beads per sample owing to the larger sample volume, and thus we recommend adding the wash and filter recollection steps for the higher extraction efficiency and lower cost. We also show that the use of AMPure XP beads to replace a column for DNA recovery in the DNA extraction and library preparation steps improves the yield (Table 1, Fig. 3a); otherwise, higher amounts of input materials would be required for library preparation and metagenomic sequencing."}
