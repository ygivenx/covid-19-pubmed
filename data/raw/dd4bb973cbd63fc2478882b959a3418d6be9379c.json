{"title": "Title: The Active Role of a Blood Center in Outpacing the Transfusion Transmission of COVID-19 Running title: Blood donor screening amidst Coronavirus outbreak Compliance with Ethical Standards", "body": ", [4] .\n\nAlthough WHO noted in 2003 that no cases of SARS-CoV have been reported due to transfusion of blood products, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through blood transfusion. Additionally, with more asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19, blood safety is worthy of consideration. The current recommendations are based largely on the new guidelines released by AABB, and a precautionary approach including vigilant blood donor surveillance is the desirable need of the hour [5] .\n\nOurs is a tertiary care blood centre catering to an 1200 bedded academic hospital in North India. In the wake of this COVID-19 outbreak, we took the following measures and included them in the otherwise routine blood donor screening methodology for our centre:\n\n(1) Our standard mini-physical by taking body temperature before blood donation in those who present with high pulse rate (> 100bpm on two consecutive checks at a definite interval of 5 minutes) or those giving a history of fever in past 3 days.\n\n(2) Additional questions were added in the donor screening program intending for the donors to self-screen before coming in to donate. This encouraged them to refrain from donation if they had:\n\na. Fever or other symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing) b. Having close contact with someone diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 in the last 14 days c. Travelled outside the country and or have been diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 until 28 days after the illness has been resolved d. However, if they felt healthy and well and met the general eligibility conditions, we welcomed their donation to help ensure stable bloodstock amid the outbreak.\n\n(3) Follow-up of all the blood donors by telephonically calling them and asking the donors and their family about their current physical condition within the next 3 days after their last donation (4) Another interesting initiative in order to protect our staff was to encourage them for home quarantine in case they were feeling ill. Additionally, our staffs are trained in universal precautions to help prevent the risk of spreading germs, including regular cleaning of public surfaces of contamination potential.\n\n(5) Displaying donor information and education material at our donation centre that addressed the following Q & A:\n\nDonating blood is safe. We always use new, sterile needles that are discarded after a single-use.\n\nAll donated blood, even donations from repeat donors, is tested for blood type, hepatitis B & C, HIV, syphilis, and malaria according to national guidelines [6] .\n\nBlood centres are not authorized to test for COVID-19.\n\nThere is no such evidence yet that proves the transfusion transmissibility of the coronaviruses. Furthermore, pre-donation screening procedures are designed to prevent donations from people with flu-like symptoms or any such respiratory illness.\n\nBlood is a critical component of emergency preparedness. It is perishable and the supply must be constantly replenished. It's important for eligible blood and platelet donors to give today so that we can have strong bloodstock when needed.\n\nIn the wake of this outbreak, voluntary blood donation drives are getting cancelled; our community's blood supply is certainly bound to drop. We need to build up our reserves today so that we have enough blood available to withstand any transient shortage in future.\n\nStandard practices for cold and flu-like illness are the best way to keep you and your community healthy. This includes home quarantine if feeling sick, meticulous hand hygiene either with disinfectants and or with soap and water, adherence to proper cough etiquette and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or face after touching public surfaces.\n\nWith these measures in place, we wish to combat the novel variant of CoV at our blood centre. Knowledge of the COVID-19 is evolving every day. However, routine blood donor screening measures that are already in place should be able to prevent individuals with active respiratory infections from donating blood."}
