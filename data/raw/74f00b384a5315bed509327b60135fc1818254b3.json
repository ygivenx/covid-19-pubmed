{"title": "Non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure", "body": "In the late 1980s, when innovators fi rst began using noninvasive ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure as a potential alternative to endotracheal intubation, 1 few clinicians would have thought that within 20 years this technique would become a fi rst-line intervention for some forms of acute respiratory failure. 2 Non-invasive ventilation refers to the delivery of mechanical ventilation with techniques that do not need an invasive endotracheal airway. It should not, therefore, be used when patients cannot protect their airway. It is not appropriate for all, and the selection of candidates is important (panel 1). For patients with secretion accumulation or a weak cough refl ex, adequate secretion management with manual or mechanical techniques might be advisable before non-invasive ventilation is declared failed or contraindicated. 2, 3 Compared with invasive mechanical ventilation, this type of ventilation achieves the same physiological benefi ts of reduced work of breathing and improved gas exchange. 4 Furthermore, it avoids the complications of intubation and the increased risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and sinusitis, especially in patients who are immuno suppressed or with comorbidities. 2 We review present and potential uses of non-invasive ventilation in the acute setting, with emphasis on indications outside the intensive care unit. Although continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) does not actively assist inspiration as do all other forms of non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, we class CPAP as a non-invasive mode unless otherwise specifi ed.\n\nThe use of non-invasive ventilation varies greatly between hospitals and geographical regions, and has changed over time. Investigators of a worldwide prospective survey of mechanical ventilation noted that use rose from 4% of all ventilators started in 2001, to 11% in 2004. 5 It is increasingly being used in many countries, but frequency of use is highly variable. 6, 7 Non-invasive ventilation is used mainly for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Use for hypoxic respiratory failure and facilitation of weaning is still infrequent and is mainly done in specialised centres. 7 In Europe, the rate of use of non-invasive ventilation in intensive care units is about 35% of ventilated patients and higher (roughly 60%) in respiratory intensive care units or emergency departments. 8, 9 In North America, this form of ventilation is begun most often in emergency departments, with most patients transferred to intensive care units or step-down units in hospitals that have such facilities. The low rate of use in some hospitals relates to little knowledge about or experience with the technique, insuffi cient technical equipment, and inadequate funding. [9] [10] [11] Despite these limitations, this technique is increasingly being used outside the traditional and respiratory intensive care units, including in emergency departments; postsurgical recovery rooms; 12 cardiology, 13 neurology, 14 and oncology 15 wards; and palliative care units. 16 \n\nIn a matched case-control study, Girou and colleagues 17 showed that compared with endotracheal intubation non-invasive ventilation was associated with a lower risk of nosocomial infections (including urinary tract and catheter-related infections), less antibiotic use, shorter lengths of stay in the intensive care units, and lower mortality than was endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, endotracheal intubation is uncomfortable for patients and increases the need for sedation and analgesia, which is an independent factor for extended weaning. 18 During non-invasive ventilation, the need for sedation is usually less than with intubation so that patients maintain better spontaneous breathing, can wean more rapidly, and Review www.thelancet.com Vol 374 July 18, 2009 251 spend less time in the intensive care units. 19 However, it should not be used in patients with contraindications (panel 1). Such patients need prompt intubation and inadvisable use places them at risk of need for emergency intubation with its attendant morbidity and mortality. 20 Non-invasive ventilation can be used in a wide range of disorders that lead to acute respiratory failure. We examine the evidence lending support to applications which are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (panel 2). 21 The success of this technique depends not only on the diagnosis of respiratory failure and patients' characteristics but also on when the ventilation is started 22 and the setting in which the patient is treated. 23 Early use of non-invasive ventilation is recommended because the opportunity for a successful start might be lost if delays arise and the patient's underlying disease progresses too far. However, such ventilation can be started too early-ie, when the patient's illness is so mild that no ventilatory assistance is needed and they are more likely to be intolerant than be helped. 24 Thus judgment should be exercised; most practitioners seek evidence of increased dyspnoea and work of breathing (tachypnoea or heightened accessory muscle use). 25 Another advantage of an early start is that patients who are not in immediate life-threatening situations can be managed outside the intensive care units, provided that the ward team has the necessary skills. Hence specialised units (ie, respiratory intensive care, high-dependency) are ideal for provision of non-invasive ventilation to all but the most sick patients because they off er complete non-invasive monitoring systems and higher nurse to patient ratios than are available on general wards.\n\nPatients with acute respiratory acidosis caused by an exacerbation of COPD are the group that benefi ts most from non-invasive ventilation. Early use in patients with COPD who have with mild respiratory acidosis (as low as pH 7\u00b730) and mild-to-moderate respiratory distress prevents further deterioration, and thus avoids endotracheal intubation and improves survival compared with standard medical therapy. 26 In a large multicentre trial in patients with mild-to-moderate acidotic COPD who were admitted to a respiratory ward, Plant and colleagues 26 noted that intubation and mortality rates were lower with non-invasive ventilation than with standard therapy alone, but subgroup analysis showed that these rates did not diff er when pH at enrolment was less than 7\u00b730. The investigators surmised that these patients with low pHs might have fared better in an intensive care unit than in the respiratory ward.\n\nStrong evidence of effi cacy (from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses) and low risk of failure (10-20%) means that use of non-invasive ventilation to avoid intubation in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD and acute respiratory failure (pH 7\u00b730-7\u00b734) is regarded as the ventilatory therapy of fi rst choice and can be safely administered in appropriately monitored and staff ed areas outside intensive care. [27] [28] [29] Patients with a low pH are still candidates for this technique but transfer to a closely monitored location is strongly advisable.\n\nNon-invasive ventilation has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, mainly in emergency departments. Investigators of several meta-analyses [30] [31] [32] concluded that this technique, including CPAP, is better than is standard medical therapy for reduction of intubation rate. Furthermore, they noted that CPAP reduces mortality. This conclusion was not supported in a multicentre trial 33 that compared oxygen therapy alone, CPAP, and non-invasive pressure support ventilation. The physiological improvements were faster with non-invasive ventilation than with oxygen alone but without a statistically signifi cant eff ect on intubation or mortality rates. However, the very low intubation rate (<3%) raises questions as to whether the patients' population was similar to that of other studies. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Meta-analyses 30-32 that compared non-invasive ventilation with CPAP alone in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema showed that intubation and mortality rates did not diff er, although investigators of some studies noted more rapid improvements in dyspnoea scores, oxygenation, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) with non-invasive ventilation than with CPAP. Nonetheless, because of ease of use, some clinicians regard CPAP as fi rst-line treatment for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in patients who do not have hypercapnoea. 39 According to the European Cardiology Task Force 40 for diagnosis and treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, non-invasive ventilation and CPAP are regarded as fi rst-line treatments together with standard medical therapy when acute respiratory failure ensues.\n\nMajor abdominal and thoracic surgeries are often complicated postoperatively by hypoxaemia and respiratory failure, which is sometimes fatal. Pulmonary atelectasis after major surgery is frequent and might predispose patients to pneumonia. In randomised trials CPAP reduced atelectasis and prevented pneumonia more eff ectively than did standard therapy after upper abdominal surgery, 41 and non-invasive ventilation substantially ameliorated gas exchange and abnormal changes in pulmonary function after gastrosplasty in patients who were obese. 42 Preventive use for a week before 43 or immediately after thoracic, 44 cardiac 45 or vascular 46 surgeries might mitigate loss of lung volume and development of atelectasis while easing recovery. Furthermore, use of non-invasive ventilation to treat early acute respiratory failure after lung resection improved survival in one randomised study. 47 These results lend support to use of CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the postoperative setting, but more data are needed before specifi c recommendations can be made.\n\nAcute respiratory failure in patients who are immunocompromised often signals a terminal phase of the underlying disease, with short survival time and high costs of admission to intensive care. 48 Early use of non-invasive ventilation could be very helpful, as shown by randomised studies in intensive care units that compared this technique with standard treatment. In patients receiving a solid-organ transplant and who had hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, such ventilation reduced intubation rate, complications, mortality, and duration of stay in intensive care. 49 In a second study, 50 this technique lowered intubation, complication, and mor tality rates compared with standard therapy in patients with hypoxaemia and bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates and immunosuppression secondary to haemato logical malig nancies, transplantation, or HIV infection. In view of the risk of admitting patients who are immunosuppressed to intensive care, some institutions now use non-invasive ventilation or CPAP early in haematology wards, either via a face mask or helmet, to avert transfer to intensive care. 15 Obesity is an epidemic health and socioeconomic problem in many countries and predisposes people to chronic alveolar hypoventilation, usually in association with obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defi ned as obesity with hypercapnia and can lead to acute respiratory acidosis during an exacerbation. Some case reports and observational studies suggest that non-invasive ventilation can ameliorate alveolar hypoventilation and avoid intubation in this situation. 51, 52 Patients with severe irreversible chronic diseases often eschew invasive mechanical ventilation when they present with acute respiratory failure and such ventilatory assistance might even be medically inappropriate for terminal stages. 53 Non-invasive ventilation could be used as an intermediate step to relieve symptoms and to achieve survival in hospital in some patients. 54 Two large US studies 55, 56 in patients with acute respiratory failure and do-not-intubate orders reported that roughly half of those treated with this technique survived and were discharged. Underlying disease was an important determinant of survival: patients with congestive heart failure had better survival rates than did those with COPD, and these rates were much better than were those for patients with pneumonia or cancer.\n\nObservational studies found that non-invasive ventilation can be eff ective in relieving respiratory distress in patients admitted to either a respiratory unit 57 or a palliative care unit. 16 Early data from an ongoing multicentre randomised study 58 of non-invasive ventila tion versus oxygen supplementation showed that it relieves signs of respiratory distress for at least 6 h after initiation and patients needed less morphine than did controls given oxygen. Patients with congestive heart failure and COPD who have do-not-intubate orders respond well to non-invasive ventilation, but use for other diagnoses and palliation, although appealing, needs further study. 59 Two randomised controlled studies 60,61 assessed use of non-invasive ventilation during severe, non-life-threatening asthma attacks before development of acute respiratory failure. The fi rst study 60 showed improved fl ow rates and reduced admissions with this technique compared with sham non-invasive ventilation. The second study 61 reported similar conclusions with high infl ation pressures but not with low pressures or standard medical therapy. A trial can be considered for prevention of acute respiratory failure in patients with asthma who do not respond adequately to initial bronchodilator therapy. Whether this technique is eff ective for treatment of overt acute respiratory failure in patients with asthma is unknown.\n\nA subset of patients-eg, those who are immunocompromised, have pneumonia and pulmonary fi brosis with a low ratio for arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (F I O 2 ), or have bleeding diatheses-are at high risk for developing respiratory failure during fi breoptic bronchoscopy. Two randomised trials showed that either CPAP alone 62 or non-invasive ventilation 62 given via a full face mask improved oxygenation, and in one study 63 reduced postprocedure respiratory failure in patients with severe hypoxaemia. Similar fi ndings with the helmet were reported. 64 Although evidence lends support to use of such ventilation during fi breoptic bronchoscopy to avoid intubation, close monitoring and ready availability of equipment for emergency intubation are necessary.\n\nBy contrast with use of non-invasive ventilation on a ward, the closely monitored intensive-care setting allows safe application of this technique even in very sick patients. To manage such patients non-invasively, including those with COPD exacerbations with severe respiratory acidosis (ie, pH<7\u00b730), staff with much experience in this technique are needed, who are prepared to intubate promptly if goals are not met (ie, haemodynamic stability, adequate oxygenation, good cooperation). 65, 66 Delays in intubation of these patients runs the risk of unanticipated respiratory or cardiac arrest with attendant morbidity and mortality. Predictors of failure for non-invasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure are no improvement or a fall in pH, no change or a rise in breathing frequency after 1-2 h, high-acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score II >34), and lack of cooperation. Predictors for hypoxaemic respiratory failure are no or a minimum rise in the ratio of PaO 2 to F I O 2 after 1-2 h, Nasal pillows Helmet patients older than 40 years (one study), 67 high acuity illness at admission (simplifi ed acute physiology score >34), presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, community acquired pneumonia with or without sepsis, and multiorgan system failure. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure denotes patients with dyspnoea and tachypnoea with ratios of PaO 2 to F I O 2 less than 200 and a non-COPD diagnosis such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Several clinical trials [68] [69] [70] have studied non-invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit to avoid intubation in such patients, but results are controversial. Major confounders of these studies were the large diff erences between enrolled patients in type of respiratory failure and severity of illness. For example, Confalonieri and colleagues 71 assessed use of this technique in patients with acute respiratory failure due to severe community-acquired pneumonia, including patients with and without COPD. Although non-invasive ventilation signifi cantly reduced need for endotracheal intubation and length of hospital stay, in a subgroup analysis only patients with COPD benefi ted. Observational studies 72, 73 suggest that noninvasive ventilation is not useful for the avoidance of intubation when hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure is caused by community-acquired pneumonia in the absence of COPD.\n\nOnly one randomised trial 74 has thus far investigated use of this technique as an alternative to intubation in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Antonelli and co-workers 74 compared this technique with immediate intubation in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure who did not improve despite aggressive medical therapy. Oxygenation improved similarly within the fi rst hour in both groups, and only 31% of patients in the non-invasive ventilation group needed intubation. Patients in the immediate intubation group developed serious complications, especially infections, more frequently than did those in the non-invasive group. In survivors, the duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in intensive care was shorter in those assigned to the non-invasive group.\n\nThus, although some studies suggest benefi t, the use of non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe community-acquired pneumonia is controversial and not recommended routinely. 75 Results of a survey 76 in three intensive care units, with staff highly skilled in this technique, showed that only 30% of patients with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome met criteria for a trial of this type of ventilation. Of these patients, intubation was avoided in 54%, which was associated with much lowered morbidity (by about 40%) and mortality rates (roughly 30%). This fi nding suggests that in real-life situations and in expert hands only about 15% of such patients can be treated successfully with this technique; mainly those with a low severity of illness, not in shock, and rapid improvement in oxygenation after therapy is started.\n\nSeveral randomised trials showed that non-invasive ventilation can be safely and successfully used to enable weaning from mechanical ventilation in stable patients recovering from an episode of hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ie, COPD exacerbations) 77, 78 and even in those who previously had an unsuccessful spontaneous breathing trial. 79, 80 Respiratory failure after extubation occurs in about 15% of extubated patients, with an inhospital mortality that approaches 30-40%. 81 Two randomised trials 82, 83 have shown that non-invasive ventilation applied immediately after extubation in patients considered at high risk of extubation failure (ie, elderly patients, and those with repeated failed weaning attempts, congestive heart failure, hypercapnia, hypoxaemia, acidaemia, and many comor bidities) lowered the rate of reintubation. Further more, in one study, mortality in the intensive care unit decreased in a subgroup of patients with hyper capnia. 83 However, results from two previous randomised trials 84, 85 showed no reduction in reintubation rates, and one 85 reported a signifi cantly higher mortality in the intensive care unit in the non-invasive group, associated with longer delays in reintubation than in the control group (12 h vs 2 h) . These fi ndings led some researchers to conclude that non-invasive ventilation should not be used for extubation failure. However, only 10% of enrolled patients had COPD, perhaps predisposing to less favourable fi ndings than seen in other studies. Furthermore, outcomes were improved in the group of controls who crossed over to non-invasive ventilation after they met criteria for respiratory failure,which suggests that some patients randomly assigned to this group started too early before they were clearly good candidates. Although controversial, accumulating evidence suggests that this technique has a role in treatment of extubation failure, but mainly in patients with hypercapnic and congestive heart failure who are at high risk for extubation failure. Furthermore, patients should be monitored closely to avoid delays in intubation.\n\nApplication of non-invasive ventilation for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other airborne diseases has generated debate. On the basis of the Toronto experience 86 with SARS, in which some caregivers contracted the syndrome when a patient was intubated after failure of non-invasive ventilation, use of this technique was discouraged for patients with this disease. However, two subsequent observational studies 87, 88 from China reported no evidence of viral spread to caregivers who took appropriate precautions. In the event of an avian infl uenza pandemic, ventilator resources will probably be severely strained, and non-invasive ventilation might off er a means to support some aff ected patients. However, some clinicians consider this tecnique contra indicated in respiratory failure from communicable respiratory airborne diseases unless used inside a negative-pressure isolation room with strict precautions.\n\nAlthough bulky and often cumbersome, negative-pressure ventilators such as the so-called iron lung are still used in some countries. 89 Non-invasive ventilation nowadays almost always consists of positive pressure delivered to the upper airway via a mask or other interface, and uses diff erent physiological principles, dependent on the mode of delivery. During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied to raise functional residual capacity and open fl ooded alveoli in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. CPAP can lessen left ventricular transmural pressure, reducing afterload and increasing cardiac output, providing an additional rationale for use in the treatment of such patients. 30, 31 CPAP can also be given via a helmet, which can cause diffi culties with synchrony between the patient and ventilator when used with forms of positive-pressure ventilation that need triggering by the patient. 90\n\n\u2022 Explain technique to patient (if competent) \u2022 Choose correct interfaces and size \u2022 Set pressures starting from low levels (ie, pressure support about 8 cm H 2 O and external PEEP 4-5 cm H 2 O) \u2022 Place interface gently over face, holding it in place and start ventilation \u2022 When patient tolerant, tighten straps just enough to avoid major leaks, but not too tight \u2022 Set F I O 2 on ventilator or add low-fl ow oxygen into the circuit, aiming for SO 2 >90% \u2022 Set alarms-low pressure alarm should be above PEEP level \u2022 Be mindful of and try to optimise patent's comfort \u2022 Reset pressures (pressure support increased to get expired tidal volume 6 mL/kg or higher-raise PEEP external to get oxygen saturation 90% or higher). \u2022 Protect site of skin pressure from the interface (ie, artifi cial skin, wound-care dressing, or rotating interfaces) \u2022 Consider use of mild sedation if patient is agitated \u2022 Monitor comfort, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and dyspnoea every 30 min for 6-12 h then hourly \u2022 Measure arterial blood gases at baseline and within 1 h from start \u2022 Humidifi cation advised for applications longer than 6 hours NIV=non-invasive ventilation; PEEP=end-expiratory positive pressure; FIO2=fraction of inspired oxygen; SO2=oxygen saturation.\n\nPressure-support ventilation assists inspiration via a preset positive-pressure boost triggered by the patient. The higher pressure is delivered until the inspiratory fl ow rate falls below a target pressure. In this way, pressure-support ventilation allows the patient to set not only breathing rate but also inspiratory and expiratory durations, the feature that distinguishes it from other ventilator modes. Bilevel ventilation, the combination of pressure support to reduce inspiratory work and extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure to counterbalance intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, achieves a greater reduction in work of breathing than does either mode alone, at least in patients with COPD. 91 Pressure-control ventilation, 92 like pressure-support ventilation, fl uctuates between high inspiratory and low expiratory pressures, but contrasts with pressure-support ventilation in that the ventilator cycles into expiration when a preset inspiratory time is reached so that the patient is unable to control the duration of inspiration. Proportional-assist ventilation 93 targets spontaneous inspiratory fl ow rate as a surrogate of patients' eff ort and might improve synchrony between patient and ventilator and tolerance in some patients. Although this mode might be more comfortable and needs fewer adjustments than some pressure-support modes, 93 it is more complex to use than pressure-support ventilation and has not been widely adopted. Pressure-support ventilation, pressure-control ventilation, and pro portional-assist ventilation have been used alone or in combination with extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure in treatment of both acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure.\n\nInterfaces connect the patient's airway to the ventilator tubing. Six types of interfaces are commercially available that can be used to apply positive pressure to the upper airway during an episode of acute respiratory failure (fi gure): full-face (or oronasal) mask, total face mask, nasal mask, mouthpieces, nasal pillows or plugs, and a helmet. For acute applications, most clinicians use face masks (total or full), then nasal masks, and to a lesser extent other interfaces 94 (panel 3).\n\nNasal bridge ulcers develop less often than they did previously because of use of soft silicone seals, lessened strap tension, and use of artifi cial skin at the fi rst sign of skin reddening. Tightening straps excessively is strongly discouraged because of discomfort and risk of ulcers and air leaking might be increased. 95 Although full-face masks are tolerated better than nasal masks initially and are the preferred interface in the acute care setting, 96 both facial and nasal masks improve arterial blood gases equally 97 and patients might tolerate the nasal mask better than the face mask if they have claustrophobia or a frequent productive cough. 98 Skill of the caregivers and their extent of experience in use of non-invasive ventilation are important to the success of this technique (panel 4). 99, 100 Thus, as the skills of staff develop, they might be able to successfully treat very sick patients. Additionally, the use of protocols to guide use might improve selection of appropriate patients. 101 Although Chevrolet and co-workers 102 characterised non-invasive ventilation as excessively demanding on personnel time, subsequent studies 26, 103 have shown that, despite taking about 30-60 min longer, initiation with invasive mechanical ventilation is rated by staff as no more diffi cult to administer than is invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\nOptimum staffi ng and location for delivery depend on acuity of the patient and their severity of illness, monitoring capabilities of the unit, and experience of the staff . 23 Several factors should be considered before a patient is transferred from intensive care to a ward-eg, patients should not need invasive monitoring (arterial lines) or inotropes, nurse to patient ratio should be low (ie, more than one to four), and staff s' skill needs to be adequate to assess when non-invasive ventilation is failing and the patient needs to be transferred to a protected environment. Patients should be able to call for help if needed and pass a weaning test of more than 15 min without serious respiratory distress or oxygen desaturation. Finally, patients should have no need for high concentrations of oxygen supplementation (ie, F I O 2 >60%).\n\nVentilators and monitoring systems have improved and might be important in the success of non-invasive ventilation. Specifi cally, most new ventilators have modes that compensate for air leaks, improved and sometimes adjustable triggering, systems to achieve best possible synchrony, and minimise rebreathing of carbon dioxide. 104, 105 Additionally, humid ifi cation of the upper airway is important to improve comfort and tolerance. Heated passover humifi diers might reduce work of breathing and carbon dioxide accumulation compared with heat and moisture exchangers, mainly because dead space and resistance are lessened with the non-invasive technique. 106 Eff ectiveness of non-invasive ventilation in specifi c diseases is well documented and quantifi ed ( exacerbations of COPD with a theoretical model that used a decision-tree analysis constructed from a meta-analysis of randomised trials. They concluded that non-invasive ventilation was very cost-eff ective. Plant and co-workers 110 reported that when implemented on a ward, this technique reduces costs (by avoiding admission to intensive care) and improves outcomes compared with traditional medical treatment. Furthermore, the reduced rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia achieved with non-invasive ventilation not only off ers clinical benefi ts for patients but also might have fi nancial advantages for hospitals. For example, the cost of respiratory failure complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia is very high, which creates a strong fi nancial incentive for hospitals to prevent this potentially life-threatening and expensive complication. 111\n\nNon-invasive ventilation has an important role in the management of respira tory failure in acute-care hospitals. Its use to treat acute respiratory failure related to COPD exacerbations, cardio genic pulmonary oedema, and patients in immuno suppressed states has gained wide acceptance. Many other potential applications are undergoing further investiga tion. Furthermore, because intensive care units are often full, use of this technique in other settings is becoming common in many hospitals, but patients should be selected carefully to assure safety. We expect expanded use of non-invasive ventilation as new applications are explored and caregivers develop skill in the technique, but caution should be exercised to restrict use to appropriate applications (ie, avoiding patients with contraindications or excessive delays in intubation). Much variability exists between institutions in how often, with which mode, and in which setting this technique is applied and eff orts should be made to ensure that acquisition of skills helps to narrow these diff erences.\n\nSN undertook an independent database search, wrote and revised the manuscript, developed the fi gures, tables, and references list; and obtained copyright of images in fi gure 1.
