{"title": "NBCZone: Universal three-dimensional construction of eleven amino acids near the catalytic nucleophile and base in the superfamily of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases", "body": "Previously, when analyzing the spatial structures of a superfamily of proteins with an \u03b1/\u03b2hydrolases fold (SCOP ID: [53473] ), characterized by the 3-layer \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 architecture with a mixed \u03b2-sheet of eight \u03b2-strands placed in 12435678 order, and with \u03b2-strand 2 being antiparallel to the rest of the \u03b2-strands [1] , the existence of a small internal position with variable contents was discovered. This position is filled with a water molecule or with an oxygen atom from the side-chain group of the catalytic acid residue. The set of amino acids surrounding this position was termed the catalytic acid zone [2] .\n\nIn addition to the acid residue, the active site of proteins with an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold includes a nucleophile, base, and two residues of the oxyanion hole that stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis [3] . Together, these residues form the catalytic machinery necessary for performing the hydrolase function. Similarly to the catalytic acid zone, the nucleophile and oxyanion zones, which coordinate the catalytic nucleophile and the residues of the oxyanion hole, were also described [4] ; and it was speculated that the catalytic triad zones together form a conserved structural motif [2] .\n\nThere is another superfamily of hydrolases, (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases (SCOP ID: [50493]) [5] . These are the all-\u03b2 proteins comprised of two six-stranded Greek key \u03b2barrels lying perpendicular to one another with the active site cleft located between them [1] .\n\nThe hydrolases of this type also have the same catalytic triad [5] [6] [7] , but the three amino acids are arranged in a different sequential order (Fig. 1) . The nucleophile of \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolases is located at the turn, known as the \"nucleophile elbow\", and is identified by the sequence motif Sm-X-Nuc-X-Sm (Sm, small residue; X, any residue; Nuc, nucleophile) [3] . The corresponding pentapeptide of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases has the consensus J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 structures have either serine or threonine at position 54 T , and alanine at position 55 T . Therefore, the set of these 67 proteins was named the \"[ST]A group\" ( Table S1 ).\n\nThe importance of alanine at position 55 T for the catalytic activity of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases has been established [16, 17] . Using the human plasmin model as an example, it was shown that replacing the alanine residue with a threonine leads to the formation of an unusual hydrogen bond between this threonine and the catalytic histidine [16] . The peculiarity of this interaction is that the catalytic histidine now adopts an inactive conformation. In contrast, with the bovine protein C as an example, replacing this alanine with a hydrophobic valine does not cause major changes in the conformation of the catalytic histidine [17] . (Table S1 ). C1r/C1s and MASP-1/-2/-3 form a family of mosaic serine proteases with identical domain organization [18] , functioning as supramolecular complexes [19] . In each of the five mosaic serine proteases, two loops structurally corresponding to trypsin loop A (34 T -41 T ) and loop B (56 T -64 T ) [20] contact each other during the formation of such complexes [21] [22] [23] . In trypsin, cysteine at position 42 T is located at the carboxy-terminal end of loop A, and cysteine at position 58 T is placed at the amino-terminal end of loop B. Perhaps because of the need to form the supramolecular complexes, disulfide bonds are missing in all but MASP-1. As the analysis of the MASP-2 structure (PDB ID: 3TVJ, [22] ) shows, despite the absence of a disulfide bond, contacts between amino acids at positions 42 T , 58 T and the catalytic nucleophile are conserved (Table J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases, the residue is not absolutely conserved. Asparagine is observed at position 55 T in Homo sapiens HtrA and Arabidopsis thaliana Do-like serine proteases (8 proteases, Tables 1 and S1), joined together into HtrA family [25, 26] . In these enzymes the 54 T position is occupied by only threonine, and thus, this group of HtrA family proteases was named the \"TN group\". Because in the TN group the 55 T position is occupied by an asparagine and not by an alanine like in the [ST] A group, the 55 T -213 T interaction ( Fig.   2A ) is modified such that instead of the CB atom of alanine, the main chain oxygen of amino acid at position 213 T interacts with the ND2 atom of asparagine (e.g. ND2/Asn196-O/Asn321 in human mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2 (PDB ID: 5M3N, [27] ; Table 1 , Fig. 2C ).\n\nThe catalytic triad of HtrA2 is found in a catalytically incompetent conformation [27] . The distance between the ND1/His198 (base) and OG/Ser306 (nucleophile) atoms is 6.2 \u00c5. There are also no hydrogen bonds between His198 (catalytic base) and Asp228 (catalytic acid).\n\nAsn196 is, however, directly involved in the mutual separation of the base and the nucleophile from each other, forming two hydrogen bonds: ND2/Asn196-OG/Ser306=2.8 \u00c5 and OD1/Asn196-N/His198=3.1 \u00c5 (Fig. 2C) . In particular, the tripeptide Asn196-Ala197-His198 forms an Asx-turn [28] .\n\nThe more complicated networks of interactions within the NBCZones are observed in the case of human HtrA1 (PDB ID: 3TJN, [29] ). The PDB file 3TJN, 3 \u00c5 resolution, contains coordinates for the A, B, and D chains; chain D is relatively poorly ordered overall. Chain A has an incompetent conformation of active site: ND1/His220-OG/Ser328=7.6 \u00c5, that is essentially the same as seen for the HtrA2 structure. The active site residues of chain B: Ser328 (nucleophile), His220 (base) and Asp250 (acid) are properly positioned for catalytic activity (Fig. 2D, Table 1 ). As in HtrA2, the contacts O/Asn343-ND2/Asn218 are present in chains A and B of HtrA1; however, atom OD1/Asn218, instead of forming the Asx-turn OD1/Asn218-N/His220 as in HtrA2, is now involved in the contacts with a catalytic acid Asp250.\n\nThere is no essential difference between the NBCZones of HtrA3 and HtrA2 that belong to set J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 by large conformational differences between the incompetent and competent conformations for substrate binding active site regions.\n\nAlthough the HtrA and Do-like proteases are within the same TN group, there are some structural differences in their NBCZones. For example, in the proteases HtrA1 and Do-like 5 (set II, Table S1 ) atom ND2/Asn55 T forms the hydrogen bond in the NBCZone and atom OD1/Asn55 T interacts with the catalytic acid Asp102 T (Fig. 2D) . However, in protease Dolike 1, atom OD1/Asn171 forms the hydrogen bond in the NBCZone and atom ND2/Asn171 plays a key role in the interactions with the catalytic acid Asp102 T (PDB ID: 3QO6 [30] , Fig.   2E , Table 1 ). Similar NBCZones occur in the proteases Do-like 2, Do-like 8 and Do-like 9:\n\nset III (Table S1 ). Further analysis of prokaryotic and viral proteases also show that all proteases of set II have the catalytically competent or incompetent conformation of catalytic histidine, but all proteases of set III have only the catalytically competent conformation of the catalytic histidine (Table S1, column 4). The structural diversity of the side chain of Asn55 T agrees well with the conformational changes in the active sites of the HtrA family proteases [25] [26] [27] 29] .\n\nThe HtrA family proteases are multidomain proteins, which besides a proteolytic domain also contain at least one C-terminal PDZ domain [25, 26] . The functional unit of the HtrA family proteases ranges from a trimer to a dodecamer. Loops A and B play important structural and regulatory roles in the HtrA multimer complexes [25, 31] . It is possible that for the implementation of these functions, loops A and B require a certain mobility. The observed presence of asparagine at position 55 T , the lack of the disulfide bond Cys42 T -Cys58 T and the substitution of the cysteine at position 42 T for the small amino acid glycine (Table S1) contribute to this requirement.\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 disulfide bond is missing in the TN group, then there is a small amino acideither glycine or alanineat position 42 T of the prokaryotic proteases, as is the case with the eukaryotic proteases.\n\nMost prokaryotic proteases of the TN group fall into set III. In Table S1 , there are also examples of tertiary structures included in set I and set II, and even one structure:\n\nStaphylococcus aureus serine protease SplE, PDB ID: 5MM8 [32] , in which Asn37 has two conformations corresponding to sets I and III.\n\nProkaryotic proteases of the TN group, without the Cys42 T -Cys58 T disulfide bond, belong mostly to three subgroups: the HtrA family, Spl proteases, and exfoliative toxins ( Table S1 ).\n\nshows structural details of the NBCZone (TN group) for serine protease Spl from Staphylococcus aureus, PDB ID: 2AS9 [33] . The Spl protease is not in an active form due to a rotation of the side chain of catalytic His40, and its NBCZone is not similar to other NBCZones formed with the participation of asparagine at position 55 T . The tripeptide Asn38-Lys39-His40 forms a modified Asx-turn. Therefore, the structure of this protease belongs to a separate set IV.\n\nThe structural significance of the amino acid at position 55 T for the stabilization of the catalytic triad of prokaryotic (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases is analyzed in detail in several publications [34, 35] . Using V8 protease and glutamyl-endopeptidase as examples, it was assumed that accommodation of an asparagine instead of alanine in position 55 T is impossible without some rearrangement of interactions between the catalytic histidine and the catalytic acid. In particular, weakening of the interactions of the catalytic acid D102 T with the amides of residues 56 T and 57 T were observed. In addition, it was predicted that in glutamatespecific endopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis, the replacement of the conserved Gly193 T ( Table 1) .\n\nIt is possible that the formation of a truncated loop A (34 T -41 T ) is directly related to the specificity of the catalytic activity of SPATE family proteases. Instead, a conservative tyrosine (Tyr239 in immunoglobulin A1 protease) of the unique functional loop D (143 T -149 T ) is located in place of the loop A bend of the polypeptide chain of these proteases [38] .\n\nAnother structural feature observed in the 43&[STG]V group is the presence of valine at position 55 T (Val98 in immunoglobulin A1 protease). Interesting amino acid variability is also observed at position 54 T , with serine or threonine found in five proteins and glycine in one protein. In the immunoglobulin A1 protease that has glycine at position 54 T , instead of the OG atom of the side chain of Ser54 T , there is a water molecule HOH1135, which completely replaces the OG atom in the construction of the NBCZone (Fig. 3A) . The possible structural and functional role of the existence of a water molecule near the amino acid at position 54 T is discussed below using the viral cysteine proteases as examples.\n\nSCOP divides viral (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases into two superfamilies: serine and cysteine proteases [1] . None of the viral proteases in Table S1 have a Cys42 T -Cys58 T disulfide bond. In turn, viral serine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases are divided into three groups: TA, [ST]\u03a8 and [KR]P (\u03a8amino acids with large aliphatic side chains: V, I, L; [39] ) (Tables 1 and S1). In all proteases that fall into these three groups, the amino acids at position 55 T do not show new structural features in the formation of the NBCZone compared to Val98 of the immunoglobulin A1 protease ( Table 1 and Fig. 3B ). Instead of cysteine, glycine is located at position 42 T , with the exception of phenylalanine in the HCV NS3 protease (Table   S1 ). Since the [KR]P group has lysine or arginine instead of threonine or serine at position Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 54 T , as pointed out above, only the corresponding representative structure of this group (Sindbis virus capsid protein, PDB ID: 1SVP, [40] ) is presented in Table 1 and Fig. 3B . The inclusion of lysine and proline at positions 54 T and 55 T , respectively, does not cause any major steric problems in the construction of the NBCZone.\n\nSubstitutions of Thr54 and Val55 in the HCV NS3 protease/helicase ([ST]\u03a8 group) affect the level of drug resistance of this virus [41] [42] [43] [44] . The Thr54Ala mutation changes the type of the hydrogen bond with Leu44(43 T ), as a result of which the conformations of amino acids Leu44(43 T ) and Phe43(42 T ) may change, and thus the protease/helicase binding to the inhibitor is weakened. The Thr54/Ser mutation was associated with medium level drug resistance. The Val55Ala, Arg155(214 T )Lys/Thr and Ala156(215 T )Thr resistant variants have been also identified.\n\nViral cysteine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases are divided into four groups: [TA]N,\n\n[VR]N (Tables 1 and S1, [45] [46] [47] [48] ). Perhaps, to accommodate the cysteine nucleophile, the active site of the viral cysteine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases is larger than that of the serine proteases [49] . This structural result is consistent with the observation that the contact between the amino acid at position 58 T and the catalytic cysteine has disappeared ( Table 1) . (Table S1 , column 10), which forms several hydrogen bonds with the residues surrounding it, including the catalytic histidine [50] .\n\nWith one exception, the group of proteases with a catalytic dyad have cysteine and proline at positions 54 T and 55 T , respectively ( Table S1 ). The alignment of the primary structures of such proteases, given in the work of Kanitz et al. [47] , shows that the number of dyad proteases with the dipeptide Ile-Gln at positions 54 T and 55 T is approximately equal to the number of dyad proteases with the dipeptide Cys-Pro [47] . Table 1 lists the structural parameters of the 3Cl protease from Alphamesonivirus 1 with the participation of the dipeptide Ile-Gln in the active site (PDB ID: 5LAC, [47] ). Gln46, located in position 55 T , is the largest amino acid of all structurally similar amino acids listed in Table S1 . Therefore, despite the large size of Ile45 located at position 54 T , Ile45 required a water molecule HOH537 to contact with Arg35 (position 43 T ) ( Table 1 ). The existence of water HOH537 correlates with the presence of two leucine residues at positions 42 T and 58 T , as it was shown earlier for the nuclear inclusion protein A. It is possible that the presence of a water molecule (Table S1, \n\nit was suggested that Thr27 is involved in stabilizing the conformation [51] . Mutation Leu19(58 T )Ser in the HRV2 2A proteinase (43&[VR]N group) leads to a similar result [52] .\n\nHowever, the Asn16(55 T )Ala mutation inhibits proteolytic activity completely. Mutations of residues around the nucleophilic cysteine: Pro103(192 T )Gly and Asp105(194 T )Thr/Asn, also impair the proteinase activity.\n\nIn addition to 161 protease structures, 8 proteins with the (chymo)trypsin-like fold were found that are not proteases (Table S1) The active site of Holotrichia diomphalia prophenoloxidase activating factor-II demonstrates the zymogenic conformation (PDB ID: 2B9L, [53] ). In addition, due to the lack of a side chain on glycine 55 T (Gly198), the contact O/Val374-CA/Gly198=5.4 (4.5) \u00c5 is weak (Table   1 ). However, in this protein, the catalytic serine 195 T is also replaced by glycine (Gly353).\n\nPerhaps for this reason, the CE1 atom of the catalytic histidine 57 T (His200) forms the contact O/Val374-CE1/His200=3.5 (2.4) \u00c5. According to the canonical rule of the Derewenda et al. [54] , the CE1 atom of a catalytic histidine should form a weak hydrogen bond with the mainchain oxygen of Ala375 (O/Ala375-CE1/His200, 3.1 (3.0) \u00c5), the residue following Val374 in the amino acid sequence. Therefore, for the main-chain oxygen of the amino acid at position 213 T (Val374), a new structure-catalytic role is discovered as a fixator of a catalytic histidine. Despite the loss of protease activity, all 8 proteins have a characteristic NBCZone.\n\nSummarizing the results on a structural comparison of the NBCZones for 169 (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases, we can conclude: 2) Viral proteases do not have the Cys42 T -Cys58 T disulfide bond. In these proteases, position 42 T is predominantly glycine, phenylalanine, or leucine (cysteine proteases), position 55 T can be occupied by 9 different amino acids (predominantly hydrophobic residues or proline in serine proteases and hydrophilic uncharged residues or proline in cysteine proteases), and the amino acid at position 58 T is either valine or leucine (cysteine proteases).\n\nIt was shown that the presence or absence of the Cys42 T -Cys58 T disulfide bond affects the overall thermal stability of trypsin [55] . Moreover, mutations Cys42Ala, Cys58Ala/Val and Ser195Thr convert the serine protease trypsin to a functional threonine protease.\n\nAs aforementioned, NBCZones of trypsin and trypsinogen do not differ from each other. An additional visual inspection of the trypsin tertiary structure showed that near the nucleophileoxyanion loop Gly193-Gly197 there are two water molecules HOH1015 (position X) and HOH1003 (position Y) that form two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain oxygen atoms of Gly193 and Asp194, and two weak hydrogen bonds with the C\u03b1-atoms of Asp194 and Gly197 (Fig. 3C, Table 2 ). Water molecules HOH1015 and HOH1003 are located at a distance comparable to the distance of a hydrogen bond. This conformation of the nucleophile-oxyanion loop corresponds to the zyme type trypsin conformation. The contacts HOH1015-O/Gly193 and HOH1015-CA/Asp194 dispose the N/Asp194 atom to the position required for the formation of an important \u03b2-turn contact (O/Cys191-N/Asp194; not shown).\n\nThe contacts HOH1003-O/Asp194 and HOH1003-CA/Gly197 are important for the correct orientation of the nucleophile Ser195 and its N(OxyII) oxyanion atom. Consequently, HOH1015 and HOH1003 do not affect the position of the N(OxyI) oxyanion atom. In trypsin, the nitrogen atom N/Gly193 is located at the position (type II \u03b2-turn) that ensures the activity of this protease [10] . However, in other proteases with the same zyme pattern contacts, as shown in Fig. 3C , nitrogen N(OxyI) may not be appropriate for the activity of the protein (type I \u03b2-turn; see below). Therefore, the zyme structural organization is necessary, but it is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 15 not sufficient to conclude whether the particular tertiary structure corresponds to the active or inactive state of the protease.\n\nFor Asp194, the amino acid of the neighboring nucleophile, significant zyme-zymogen conformational changes are observed [13] . The result of these changes is that the side-chain oxygen OD1 of Asp194 of trypsinogen occupies the position of water molecule HOH1015\n\n(position X) that is found in the structure of trypsin (Fig. 3D, Table 2 ). Atom OD1/Asp194 has no contact with the main chain oxygen of Gly193. Tetrapeptide Cys191-Asp194 no longer forms a \u03b2-turn conformation in the trypsinogen structure (not shown). Position Y of the trypsinogen structure is still occupied by a water molecule HOH701. Contacts of HOH701 with O/Asp194 and CA/Gly197 atoms are conserved, but there is also an additional contact with CB/Asp194 atom.\n\nDue to the catalytic importance of the described structural differences between trypsin and trypsinogen, it is necessary to extend the NBCZone of proteases by including the atomic contents of positions X and Y.\n\nIn 58 eukaryotic (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases of the [ST]A group there are two water molecules that are structurally similar to the waters HOH1015 (position X) and HOH1003 (position Y) in trypsin (Table S2) . Once again, we emphasize here that the presence in these 58 proteins of the identical zyme pattern contacts does not automatically mean that their full catalytic center is in the active configuration, as in trypsin. The structural zymogen subgroup consists of 18 proteases (Tables 2 and S2 ).\n\nGlycine at position 193 T and aspartic acid at position 194 T are absolutely conserved in these eukaryotic (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases, and glycine is the most commonly found amino acid at positions 43 T and 197 T . However, of eleven proteases (Tables 2 and S2) , five have alanine, four have serine, one has arginine, and one methionine instead of glycine at position 43 T [56, 57] . In addition, we found one example of glycine replaced at position 197 T by another amino acid, namely serine, in granzyme A (PDB ID: 1ORF, [58] ), and alanine is At position 43 T of eukaryotic proteases, one can find not only small amino acids, such as glycine, alanine, or serine, but also large residues, e.g., arginine or methionine. These large amino acids at position 43 T are seen in complement factors C2 and B (PDB IDs: 2ODP and 1RRK, respectively [57, 59] ); in these cases a pair of carbon atoms of the side chains at position 43 T are located at position X (Tables 2 and S2) .\n\nAs we showed above, although the probability is very high for the existence of a glycine residue at position 43 T of eukaryotic (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases, this position is not absolutely conserved. The HtrA and Do-like families of Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana serine proteases also have a serine at position 43 T (Tables 2 and S2 ) that leads to structural changes whereby the OG atom of Ser43 T is locates to position X instead of a water molecule. The example of the chloroplastic protease Do-like 2 (PDB ID: 5ILB, [60] ) shows the zyme contacts near the nucleophile-oxyanion loop (Fig. 3E) . Table S1 . This structural feature of the prokaryotic SplE protein is discussed in detail in the work [32] . (Tables 2 and S2) . However, all of these proteases have a water molecule at position X. This is due to the removal of the side chain of amino acid 43 T from position X as a result of a break in the course of the polypeptide chain in this place. Currently there are no data on the existence of the activation structure changes near the catalytic site in SPATE family proteases. Their N-terminal amino acid often forms a hydrogen bond with aspartate, an amino acid preceding the catalytic nucleophile [38] .\n\nAs aforementioned, a significant number of prokaryotic serine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases have amino acids, other than glycine, at positions 43 T and 197 T ( Table S1, (Table S1) . Mutations Asn28(43 T ) and Ser147(197 T ) to alanine modulate the dimerization (active form of enzyme) and completely inactivate the main viral 3C-like proteinase from human SARS coronavirus [67, 68] . Interestingly, mutation Ser139(189 T )/Ala had a slight effect on the activity and dimer stability of the proteinase.\n\nMutation Ser144(194 T )/Ala showed a two-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency compared to that of the wild type, but maintained a similar dimeric state. Ser139, Ser144 and Ser147 form a cluster of conserved serine residues near the catalytic nucleophile Cys145 of 3C-like proteinase.\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 As with the members of the prokaryotic TN group, viral serine/cysteine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases also have several members with an atypical NBCZone (Tables 2 and S2) . They are: a putative serine protease (PDB ID: 2W5E, [69] ), whose active site residues are not in the typical (chymo)trypsin-like conformation, and 4 additional proteins, non-structural protein NSP4 (PDB IDs: 5Y4L and 3FAN, [70, 71] ), 3C-like protease (PDB IDs: 5E0G and 5E0J, [72] ), 3C-like proteinase (PDB IDs: 5C5O and 2QCY, [50, 73] ), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) main protease (PDB IDs: 2Q6F and 2Q6D, [74] ), all of which demonstrate both a typical and atypical conformation of the dipeptide, residues 193 T -194 T .\n\nAs aforementioned, in eukaryotic serine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases, only glycine (with one exception) is found at the 197 T position of the nucleophile-oxyanion loop 193 T -197 T . We found five inactive proteins, in which this requirement is not the case (Tables S1\n\nand S2). In all these five proteins, instead of glycine in position 197 T there is serine, threonine, or aspartate amino acid. The presence of any residue other than glycine at position 197 T leads to a structural change in which a water molecule is replaced by the atom(s) of the side chain of the amino acid of residue 197 T . Fig. 3F shows an example of a zyme contact pattern for such a protein: Heparin binding protein (PDB ID: 1A7S, [75] ) has Thr177 at a position equivalent to position 197 T in trypsin ( Table 2) . The CB and CG2 atoms of the side chain of Thr177 have the same structural role in this protein as the water molecule HOH1003 in the structure of trypsin (see Fig. 3C ). In position 43 T there is Gly27. Therefore, a water molecule HOH451 is located at the X position. The other four eukaryotic proteins also have water molecule at position X because they have glycine at position 43 T ( Table S2) .\n\nSummarizing the results of a structural comparison of the extension of the NBCZone for 169 (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases, we can conclude:\n\n1) The vast majority of eukaryotic zyme type proteases have glycine residues at positions 43 T and 197 T . As a result, one water molecule is located at position X and another at Y. \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. base)-Cys58. Two main-chain nitrogens, N/Gly193 and N/Ser195, are the two canonical oxyanions \"N(oxyI)\" and \"N(oxyII)\". Gly43 and Val213 simultaneously interact with both the TRYPSIN_SER and TRYPSIN_HIS pattern, and thus constitute the \"43/213 Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone\" (43/213-NBCZone) of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases. The disulfide bond Cys42-Cys58 joins the elements of the \"42/43 Base Catalytic Zone\", which includes the TRYPSIN_HIS pattern and the Cys42-Gly43 dipeptide. Two conserved structural water molecules in positions X and Y, HOH X and HOH Y, interact with the TRYPSIN_SER pattern and form the \"Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone Conserved Extension\" in eukaryotic serine (chymo)trypsin-like fold proteases. Structural data were visualized and analyzed using Discovery Studio [76] and Bodil [77] . Figures were drawn with MolScript [78] and Raster 3D [79] . Table 1 ). The 43/213-NBCZone, shown in (A), together with the \"42/43 Base Catalytic Zone\" shown in (B) constitute the entire Nucleophile-Base Catalytic Zone (NBCZone) of trypsin, which is the representative structure of the \"[ST]A Group\" (see Table 1 respectively, is shown due to either inclusion of two conserved structural water molecules at the positions X and Y of trypsin (as in C), or a side-chain oxygen atom (OD1 atom of Asp194 in trypsinogen) and one water molecule at the the same spatial positions X and Y (as in D).\n\n(E) shows the extension of the NBCZone in the \"TN Group\" of (chymo)trypsin-like serine fold proteases (example of the chloroplastic protease Do-like 2; PDB ID: 5ILB), where the OG atom of Ser43 T is located at position X instead of the structural water molecule found in the NBCZone extension of trypsin. (F) shows the NBCZone extension in the five \"inactive\" proteases (example of Heparin binding protein; PDB ID: 1A7S; see Tables S1 and S2), where instead of a glycine at position 197 T there is a serine, threonine, or aspartate (Thr177 in F), whose side-chain OG1 atom substitutes the HOH Y water molecule at the NBCZone extension.
