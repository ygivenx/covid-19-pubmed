{"title": "", "body": "To date, the current West African Ebola outbreak has claimed . 9,000 lives, making it the deadliest Ebola epidemic since the discovery of the virus in 1976. 1,2 Th e transfer of expatriate patients infected with the Ebola virus to their resident countries in Europe and the United States, where capacity for advanced medical care is readily available, has raised concerns regarding the appropriateness and safety of providing lifesaving or life-sustaining measures to these patients. We review the ethical and practical considerations that infl uence these decisions and describe the approach adopted by the Special Clinical Studies Unit (SCSU) of the Clinical Center at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nA Historical Perspective of Health-care Worker Risk and CPR CPR was fi rst recognized as a potential lifesaving measure by academic and advisory organizations in the 1960s, and since that time early and aggressive resuscitation eff orts by health-care providers and lay rescuers have been encouraged. 3-5 From early on, concerns related to exposure to potentially infectious material during CPR administration have been voiced. Th ese concerns became particularly evident early in the AIDS epidemic. In 1989, the American Heart Association issued guidelines to HIV transmission during CPR has been estimated to range from one in 1 million events when HIV prevalence is high (ie, about 30%) to one in 1 billion events when prevalence is low (ie, 0.1% to 1%). 8 However, despite evidence for low risk of HIV transmission during CPR, psychologically perceived risk aff ected the frequency and quality of care delivered to patients with AIDS. A survey of fi rst responders suggested that attitudes toward providing CPR to strangers in an out-ofhospital setting had been adversely aff ected as a result of the AIDS epidemic. 9 Among physicians and nurses in the late 1990s, reluctance to provide mouth-tomouth resuscitation in outpatient or inpatient settings resulted in marked delays in ventilation. 10, 11 Possible discrepancies in quality of CPR delivered to those infected with HIV vs those not infected have been associated with worse outcomes in the former group. 12\n\nEarly in the HIV epidemic, prior to availability of eff ective HIV antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections (eg, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) frequently led to ICU admissions with associated high case-fatality. 13 Failure of supportive intensive care to signifi cantly alter outcomes and the absence of HIV-specifi c therapies frequently led to discussions of medical futility. Consequently, ICU use for the care of patients with AIDS during this era decreased, and end-of-life discussions between patients and their medical providers increased prior to hospital admission. 14 By 1988, however, despite lack of eff ective HIV antiviral therapy, ICU use and subsequent survival of patients with AIDS with Pneumocystis pneumonia increased, likely due to more aggressive supportive care, increasing use of a growing spectrum of antibiotic choices, and the use of steroids as adjunctive therapy. 15, 16 Th e Pneumocystis pneumonia example highlights the potential for variability in health-care delivery as a function of societal and provider perceptions. Th e concept of medical futility refers to interventions that are unlikely to produce any signifi cant benefi t for a spe-cifi c patient at a specifi c time. Futility does not apply globally to categories of patients, general medical situations, or to all geographic locations. Lifesaving and lifesustaining measures that might be considered futile at a single point in time might not be viewed as such as knowledge or practice advance. Similarly, resuscitation eff orts in a resource-limited country where escalated levels of post-resuscitation life support are not available might be futile, whereas the same interventions may be eff ective in locations where advanced care is readily available.\n\nHistorically, the emergence of epidemics has prompted the medical profession to periodically reexamine its responsibilities to society. Th e code of medical ethics originally draft ed by American Medical Association members in 1847 states \"when pestilence prevails, it is [the physicians'] duty to face the danger, and to continue their labors for the alleviation of the suff ering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives.\" 17 With the advent of antibiotics in the mid-20th century and the perceived manageable risk from infectious disease exposure, the Association's revised Principles of Medical Ethics placed greater emphasis on physician autonomy and less emphasis on duty to serve. 18 However, with the advent of the AIDS epidemic, the concept of duty to treat reemerged, albeit in the context of nondiscrimination of seropositive patients. 19 Most recently, against the background of the plausible threat of bioterrorism attacks, the code of ethics reemphasizes the involvement of physicians in global health-care responses. \"Because of their commitment to the care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters. Th is ethical obligation holds even in the face of greater than usual risk to their own safety, health, or life.\" 20\n\nTh e recent Ebola outbreak has required the medical profession to once again assess its obligations to the public. With the devastating and disproportionate numbers of HCWs in West Africa who have died of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the line of duty, oft en due to inaccessible or inappropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use, fundamental discussions balancing duty to treat patients with EVD with risk to providers are ongoing. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] In resource-rich settings, the role of supportive critical care interventions, including use of mechanical ventilation or hemodialysis, and the risk-benefi t of CPR have been a focus of discussion. Social stigma, fear, and knowledge gaps in disease pathogenesis and transmission risk have contributed to some providers electing against participation in the care of patients with EVD or establishing a priori limits in patient-care interventions.\n\nDespite recent examples of safe and eff ective lifesustaining care of patients with EVD (eg, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy) from centers with specialized clinical biocontainment units, it has been proposed by some that provision of CPR to critically ill patients with EVD is globally futile and poses an unacceptably high risk to HCWs. 21, 26, 27 High EVD casefatality observed in Africa, lack of specifi c EVD treatment, potential risk of exposure to infectious fl uids during CPR, and adverse consequences of delayed institution of CPR due to the time required for providers to safely don PPE might seem to support the notion of futility of CPR in patients with EVD.\n\nInterventions deemed futile in West Africa due to resource constraints might be eff ective in resource-rich settings, as the high EVD case-fatality observed in West Africa is largely related to limited access to basic, yet eff ective, care (eg, fl uid and electrolyte monitoring and replacement), as well as delay in presentation to medical facilities, in part due to the stigma associated with the disease. [28] [29] [30] [31] Electrolyte derangements (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia) or severe hypovolemia leading to cardiopulmonary arrest are reversible phenomena. Initiating CPR on a patient with EVD while aggressively correcting underlying reversible abnormalities is appropriate in resource-rich settings. However, performing CPR on a patient with refractory shock and multiorgan failure might not be appropriate regardless of underlying infectious etiology or setting. Individualized clinical judgment in the context of available resources and patient autonomy must drive patient-care decisions for those with EVD, not a priori concept of futility.\n\nProvision of safe and eff ective care in a high-containment unit requires considerable investment in planning, material resources, and training. 32 Factors that might facilitate improved care include the presence of trained emergency response personnel in or near the unit at all times, ready access to emergency equipment and supplies, and the ability to provide ICU-level, postemergency care. HCW safety must be optimized through the creation of and strict adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the execution of clinical tasks, particularly those that have been associated with increased risk of inadvertent exposure to infectious material. 32, 33 Experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome provides an example of increased HCW infection risk associated with respiratory droplet exposure and the value of adequate PPE training and use to reduce risk. 39 In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, overcrowding of medical wards, poor ventilation, and inadequate PPE were associated with high transmission rates. 40 Th e performance of aerosol-generating procedures, including endotracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and bag-mask ventilation prior to intubation, were all associated with increased transmission risk. 41 Adequate PPE training and use was associated with decreased transmission risk. 42 Th erefore, measures must be put in place to minimize HCW risk while providing advanced care to patients with EVD. We developed SOPs for endotracheal intubation, central venous catheter placement, use of renal replacement therapy, emergency (Code Blue) response, biohazardous material exposure management, and extraction of an incapacitated HCW (see discussion later in this article and e-Appendix 1 ) in the care of patients with EVD. Table 1 highlights recommended procedural modifi cations to reduce HCW risk of infectious material exposure. We also developed and implemented scenario-based training on these procedures to establish and maintain staff profi ciency while working in full PPE. All critical care SCSU staff members are required to complete this training biannually.\n\nIn the process of endotracheal intubation of a patient infected with a high-consequence pathogen, the operators are at risk for exposure to potentially infectious oral, gastric, and respiratory secretions. Manipulation of a patient's oral opening during laryngoscopy poses additional risk of injury to the operator's fi ngers. Only experienced operators should perform endotracheal intubation of patients with EVD to minimize risk associated with excessive oropharyngeal manipulation during multiple intubation attempts. Providers should administer deep sedation, paralytics, or both as needed to reduce risk of bite trauma ( e-Appendix 1 : endotracheal intubation SOP).\n\nElective placement of peripherally inserted central catheters may be suffi cient in some cases to facilitate blood draws or to administer IV therapies. Central catheter placement may be required for hemodynamic monitoring or for renal replacement therapy. When a large central catheter is needed, several factors should be considered to minimize the risk of injury to the operator. Th e presence of an additional practitioner to assist with and to enhance vigilance during the procedure is desirable. Th e use of ultrasound guidance for catheter placement allows for only the dominant hand with the needle to be on the fi eld at any time, minimizing the risk of injury to the nondominant hand during the procedure. We place extra emphasis on visual tracking of all needles on the operating fi eld, on minimizing actions that might aerosolize infectious fl uids, and on the potential use of conscious sedation for procedures to limit patient movement, thus decreasing the risk of injury to the operator ( e-Appendix 1 : invasive procedure SOP).\n\nAlthough there are no human data to support airborne transmission of Ebola, infectious aerosols generated during positive pressure ventilation may place providers at increased risk. Accidental or intentional disconnection of the ventilator circuit may lead to contamination of the environment or one's PPE and, therefore, should be minimized. Additionally, patient self-extubation may lead to patient harm or emergent situations that might be diffi cult to address in a timely fashion in a high-containment unit.\n\nConsequently, we recommend use of ventilators with the ability to automatically shut off when the ventilator circuit is broken and suggest that breaks in the ventilator circuit be minimized. When it is necessary to break the ventilator circuit, all staff in the room should be informed in advance and the exhalent should be diverted away from those present. A high-effi ciency particulate absorption fi lter should be added to the exhalation line post-patient to collect infectious material. Finally, to minimize the risk of self-extubation, patients should be maintained at deeper levels of sedation and use of soft -wrist restraints should be considered ( e-Appendix 1 : mechanical ventilation SOP).\n\nAcute kidney injury has been described in patients with EVD and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for performing acute hemodialysis in patients with EVD. 43 Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has advantages over intermittent hemodialysis in a highcontainment setting and successful use of CRRT in a patient with EVD in the United States has been reported. 44 Critical care nursing and physician staff in the SCSU at NIH are profi cient in running CRRT systems, obviating the need for specialized dialysis nurses and minimizing the number of at-risk individuals in the facility. Invasive procedures \u2022 Patient motion and uncooperativeness increases the risk of needle-stick injury. \u2022 Placement of one hand on the patient to discern landmarks while manipulating the needle with the other increases the risk of a needle-stick injury. \u2022 The presence of more than one sharp object on the fi eld at any time increases the risk of a needle-stick injury. \u2022 Forcing sharp objects (ie, needles) into a small container increases the risk of a splash or needle-stick injury.\n\n\u2022 Involve two providers.\n\n\u2022 Consider use of conscious sedation.\n\n\u2022 Perform ultrasound guidance.\n\n\u2022 Use a one-handed technique.\n\n\u2022 Remove sharp objects sequentially.\n\n\u2022 Use a large sharps container.\n\n\u2022 Accidental or intentional breakage in the ventilator circuit can expose the environment and staff to infectious aerosols. \u2022 Self-extubation may lead to patient injury or emergent situations that are diffi cult to address in a timely fashion in a high-containment unit.\n\n\u2022 Select ventilator with automatic shut-off for broken circuit. \u2022 Limit breaking ventilator circuit. \u2022 Notify staff when breaking ventilator circuit. \u2022 Divert exhalent away from providers. \u2022 Use inline post-patient HEPA fi lter. \u2022 Sedate to RASS-2. \u2022 Consider use of soft wrist restraints.\n\n\u2022 Catheter malfunction or dislodgment can lead to loss of large amounts of infected blood. \u2022 Catheter manipulation, even with needleless systems, can lead to exposure to infected blood. \u2022 Circuit clotting leads to loss of a large amount of infected blood that increases the risk of health-care worker exposure. \u2022 Large amounts of potentially infectious liquid waste are generated in the process of renal replacement therapy.\n\n\u2022 HEPA 5 high-effi ciency particulate absorption; PAPR 5 powered air-purifying respirator; PPE 5 personal protective equipment; RASS 5 Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale .\n\nDelivery of safe and eff ective CRRT to patients with EVD requires modifi cations in the spectrum of care from catheter and extracorporeal circuit management, to frequent monitoring of laboratory values, to handling of potentially highly infectious waste.\n\nBecause catheter malfunction or disconnection may lead to extravasation of highly infectious blood, we recommend maintaining continuous visibility of the cath-eter insertion site and visual inspection of the site every 30 min to ensure proper connection. Clotting of the circuit may lead to large-volume blood loss in the extracorporeal circuit that would require cautious handling and safe disposal. We recommend early return of extracorporeal blood at fi rst sign of the circuit clotting and, if necessary, recommend the use of regional citrate anticoagulation.\n\nFinancial/nonfi nancial disclosures : Th e authors have reported to CHEST that no potential confl icts of interest exist with any companies/ organizations whose products or services may be discussed in this article. 44 we recommend handling effl uent as infectious waste, given potential for breaches in the system. For this purpose, we have constructed large containers that allow for dwelling of large amounts of liquid material in the presence of detergent disinfectant cleaners prior to disposal. Transfer of liquid waste from one container to another is performed under the cover of absorbent pads to limit aerosol exposure ( e-Appendix 1 : CRRT SOP).\n\nAs discussed, the provision of CPR within a highcontainment unit poses several challenges in addition to those of code-team composition, response time, and access to emergency equipment. Th ese include limitations to physical dexterity and the introduction of barriers to eff ective communication related to PPE wear.\n\nTo heighten awareness of these challenges, we have implemented mock code-simulation training sessions. During these scenarios, the code-team members are asked to perform tasks that are likely to be necessary during a resuscitation eff ort, such as handling the code cart, drawing up and administering medications, placing defi brillation pads on the patients and delivering shocks. Th e use of PPE can muffl e voices and, therefore, requires extra attention to speak with others at a louder level than usual and with clarity. During this training, we emphasize the need to defi ne clear roles and responsibilities to the team members. Importantly, eff ective communication is achieved by speaking up and clearly, by making direct eye contact with other members of the team, and by practicing closed-loop communication. Additionally, use of hands-free communication devices can be considered under the powered air-purifying respirator hood ( e-Appendix 1 : emergency response SOP).\n\nWhile all eff orts must be made to prevent occupational exposures or events that result in an incapacitated HCW in a high-containment setting, contingency planning for these possibilities is essential to timely and appropriate responses. In the SCSU at NIH, we have established protocols for early wound decontamination following safe PPE removal. Materials and supplies required for decontamination following an exposure (eg, surgical disinfectant scrub, an eye-wash station) are immediately available on exit from the SCSU. Similarly, we have established a protocol for evacuation of an incapacitated HCW wearing full PPE that identifi es the route of evacuation, specifi es modifi ed decontamination procedures, and allows for timely institution of medical care ( e-Appendix 1 : biohazard material exposure and impaired employee extraction SOPs).\n\nIn conclusion, the health-care team must assess the benefi t of lifesaving and life-sustaining measures and the risk posed to the health-care providers when caring for individuals infected with highly infectious or contagious pathogens. We believe that delivery of lifesaving and life-sustaining interventions can be done safely in patients infected with high-consequence pathogens, provided adequate training, equipment, and protocols are in place. Finally, as a profession, we must reaffi rm our ethical obligation toward society in our duty to treat."}
