{"title": "Sharp 17 | Saralyn Smith-Carr 18 |", "body": "Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) in dogs and cats is associated with high morbidity and mortality. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Pathogenic autoantibodies target erythrocyte membrane epitopes, 6,7 providing a mechanism for fraction crystallizable receptor-mediated extravascular hemolysis mediated by macrophages. 8 Complement can interact with antibodies bound to erythrocytes, facilitating extravascular hemolysis or causing intravascular hemolysis by formation of the membrane attack complex. An expeditious diagnosis that distinguishes IMHA from other causes of anemia is critical to the rapid institution of appropriate treatment. Various criteria for the diagnosis of IMHA have been described in the literature based on the documentation of immune-mediated erythrolysis or proxy markers for this phenomenon, [9] [10] [11] [12] hereafter denoted by A1, were imported into reference management software (Mendeley, Elsevier, New York; EndNote X8, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia), before manual screening on the basis of inclusion criteria outlined in Supporting Information S1. The reference lists of papers also were examined to capture references not cited on Medline or Web of Science. Pathogen-specific searches were conducted to capture additional references (Supporting Information S1). \n\nWe designed a novel quality assessment and data extraction tool, which included domains to capture information on study design (D) and quality (Q), confidence of comorbidity diagnosis (C), likelihood of a causal link between comorbidity and IMHA (L), confidence of IMHA diagnosis (I), and the number of patients with a given comorbidity (N). For the purposes of this study, the term \"comorbidity\" included exposure to drugs, toxins, and vaccines. Additional domains captured detailed information on each of the comorbidities, including statistical inferences when available. Comorbidities were summarized in 5 broad categories: infectious disease, cancer, inflammatory disease, drugs and toxins, and vaccines. Panel members and non-panel VCCIS task force members were assigned to random pairings for the purpose of data extraction and quality assessment, dividing the total number of papers equally among all pairs. Concordance among the pairs was sought if individual members disagreed on specific observations, and all observations relating to quality assessment were confirmed by LK and OAG.\n\nFor each comorbidity identified in a paper, an integrated metric of evidence (IME) was computed as the sum of the normalized scores, weighted according to our assessment of relative importance to evidence rating, so long as only that comorbidity was present in individual patients, hence IME = 2D + Q + C + 2L + I + N. If >1 comorbidity was present in individual patients, including those infected with >1 agent, an IME value was not calculated. Reference to the patients nevertheless was made in the narrative if they yielded insight. Score D was assessed after positing the question: Does the study ask whether a comorbidity induces (or is associated with) IMHA as part of Anemia-anaemia 820\n\nAnemia-anaemiaimmun* 723\n\nAnemia-anaemiaimmun*-inclusion 248\n\nAnemia-anaemiaimmun*-inclusion 181\n\nAnemia-anaemiaimmun*-inclusioncomorbidity 63\n\nAnemia-anaemiaimmun*-rejects 475\n\nManual curation duplicates 67\n\nAnemia-anaemiaimmun*-inclusionrejects 118 \n\nCuration of records. Papers captured by a search algorithm for anemia that met inclusion criteria (n = 248) were manually curated to remove duplicates (n = 67), after which remaining papers were screened to assess whether they mentioned comorbidities, yielding 63 papers; an additional 6 were added in March 2018. An independent search for infectious agents yielded an additional 11 papers of relevance. One additional paper was identified by examining reference lists of the captured papers. IMHA, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia its hypothesis or specific aims, or is the question that a comorbidity induces (or is associated with) IMHA answered by study design? If the answer was yes, a D score was assigned; if the answer was no, the study was designated \"Descriptive Association Only\" for that comorbidity and assigned an arbitrary D score of 1 (the lowest possible) out of a maximum of 7. A Q score was not computed for comorbidities assigned Descriptive Association Only, because general study quality in those cases was irrelevant to the question of the causal relationship between comorbidity and IMHA; Q scores in those cases were therefore 0.\n\nThe maximum normalized score for each criterion was 1, yielding a maximum IME value of 8 and a minimum of <1. An IME value of 0 was applied when a study presented evidence against a comorbidity being associated with IMHA. For each comorbidity within a paper, the most conservative score for each of the IME criteria was applied for the relevant cohort of patients, to avoid exaggeration of evidence.\n\nThreshold IME values were computed to allow comorbidities to be designated as negligible, low, intermediate, or high evidence for a causal relationship with IMHA. The threshold between negligible and low evidence was taken to be a hypothetical Descriptive Association Only study, with intermediate C, L, and I scores, and 1 positive case (IME = 2.95).\n\nThe threshold between low and intermediate evidence was taken to be a hypothetical cross-sectional study, with a Q score of 28, intermediate C, L, and I scores, and 2-5 positive cases (IME = 4.37). Finally, the threshold between intermediate and high evidence was taken to be a hypothetical prospective cohort/case-control study, with a Q score of 28, high C score, intermediate L score, high I score (mechanistically based), and 2-5 positive cases (IME = 5.78).\n\nThe quality assessment and data extraction tool is shown in Supporting Information S2; Supporting Information S3 shows the derivation of each of the scores D, Q, C, L, I, and N. hemolysis, but also emphasize that the test is neither specific nor 100% sensitive for AIHA. 13 The diagnostic tests described below therefore should be interpreted in combination with the results of other diagnostic tests and response to immunosuppression. The lack of a gold (criterion) standard also presents challenges when interpreting the literature. For example, although sensitivities and specificities are discussed here (either as reported directly in the referenced studies, or calculated by the panel using data within the reference), the criteria used to define cases as positive or negative for IMHA vary. Variability also exists in how tests are performed and validated, and therefore performance in 1 study may not generalize to others.\n\nCognizant of these caveats, 7 of 8 panel members considered the algorithm in Figure 2 appropriate for diagnosis of primary or secondary IMHA, complemented by the following explanatory notes. (One panel member considered that markers of immune-mediated disease should be assessed with caution in the absence of hemolysis.) This discussion is restricted to immune-mediated destruction of circulating erythrocytes (ie, precursor-targeted immune-mediated anemia or pure red cell aplasia are not discussed). Readers requiring additional information on immune-mediated differentiation failure or destruction at the level of the bone marrow are referred elsewhere. 14-17\n\nA spun PCV is suggested because calculated hematocrit may be unreliable when agglutination is present. [18] [19] [20] However, studies in humans have reported increased plasma trapping by abnormal erythrocytes (eg, spherocytes), which could introduce inaccuracy into the spun PCV. 21 To the best of our knowledge, the effect of agglutination or spherocytosis on spun PCV has not been investigated in veterinary species. Lack of regeneration (as assessed by reticulocyte count) does not eliminate IMHA because approximately 30% of dogs have nonregenerative anemia at presentation. 5, 22 3.2 | Signs of immune-mediated destruction\n\nSpherocytes should be used as a diagnostic criterion only in dogs because feline erythrocytes do not consistently display central pallor. Interpreting spherocytes after blood transfusion should be done cautiously, because stored blood products may contain high proportions of spherocytes 23 and spherocytes have been documented in human patients with hemolytic transfusion reactions. 24, 25 Spherocytosis should be assessed in the monolayer of a well-made blood smear, because spherocyte-like artifacts arise toward the feathered edge and in thick areas. 26 In anemic animals, spherocytes should be confirmed in the deeper monolayer to avoid artifacts in thin areas. Spherocytosis also can induce increased osmotic fragility, 27 42 and dyserythropoiesis. 43 Hereditary spectrin deficiency also potentially may give rise to spherocytes if smears are made from blood stored >24 hours. 44 The percentage of spherocytes on blood smears from human patients with mutations causing hereditary spherocytosis is variable, but can be high. 45 A literature search for canine hereditary spherocytosis did not identify any cases with marked spherocytosis.\n\nIn a single study, \u22655 spherocytes/\u00d7100 oil immersion field yielded 63% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 39%-84%) (when 95% CIs were not provided by the authors, the online MedCalc Diagnostic F I G U R E 2 Diagnostic algorithm for immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Having identified anemia in a patient, biomarkers of immune-mediated destruction should next be assessed, including the saline agglutination test (SAT), direct antiglobulin test (DAT), and/or flow cytometry (FC); at least 2 should be present, or a positive SAT that persists with washing, to make a firm diagnosis of IMHA. Signs of hemolysis should then be assessed, at least 1 of which should be present for a firm diagnosis. Variations on this theme would yield a supportive or suspicious diagnosis, provided another cause of anemia is not identified. Additional abbreviations: \u2265, at least; dz, disease test evaluation calculator [https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_ test.php] was used to calculate them) and 95% specificity (95% CI, 76%-100%) for IMHA in dogs, 27 compared with 74% sensitivity (95% CI, 49%-91%) and 81% specificity (95% CI, 59%-95%) c for \u22653/\u00d7100 oil immersion field. 27 A threshold of \u22655 spherocytes/\u00d7100 oil immersion field therefore could be considered supportive of a diagnosis of IMHA, but 3-4 spherocytes/\u00d7100 oil immersion field also may be consistent with IMHA provided no other cause of spherocytosis is identified. These thresholds are similar to the criteria for 1+ spherocytosis in a proposed semiquantitative grading system. 46 Where spherocyte numbers are low (versus their typical abundance in extravascular IMHA), variability among fields could be an issue: calculating mean count over several fields (eg, 10) could help establish the true extent of spherocytosis. For enrollment of cases in IMHA research, only high-quality blood smears should be used, and given the pitfalls of spherocyte recognition, examination of the smears by a board-certified clinical pathologist is advantageous.\n\nAlthough evaluation of dried blood smears or hematology instrument scatter plots 20 can suggest agglutination, the panel does not consider these techniques adequate to confirm agglutination based on the possibility of overlapping rouleaux on blood smears and the potential for other causes of macrocytes on scattergram evaluation. 47 Saline agglutination testing performed by mixing 4 drops of saline with 1 drop of blood has a reported specificity of 100% (95% CI, 95%-100%) c for IMHA in dogs. 27 Mixing blood and saline 1:1 yielded a specificity of 95% (95% CI, 88%-99%) c based on 85 dogs without IMHA, or 85% (95% CI, 65%-96%) c when only anemic dogs were considered. 11 Agglutination that persists after mixing 1 drop of blood with 4 drops of saline therefore is considered adequate evidence for agglutination in most cases. 27 Considerably higher dilution ratios can aid the microscopic identification of agglutination. To decrease false positives, confirming that agglutination persists after washing erythrocytes 3 times in a 1:4 ratio with saline 11 is recommended for animals with equivocal results (eg, rare small erythrocyte clumps in an otherwise negative test), markedly increased total protein (eg, leishmaniasis, multiple myeloma, and feline infectious peritonitis [FIP]) or fibrinogen concentrations, 48 or strong rouleaux formation on blood smear examination. Based on reports of agglutination of washed erythrocytes from normal dogs at 4 C, we suggest that the saline solution should be between room temperature and 37 C. 49 \n\nFive panel members preferred the direct Coombs' test (DAT) and 3 considered flow cytometry and DAT to be equally useful. Supporting Information S4 provides recommendations for performance of these tests. If the DAT cannot be performed because agglutination persists after washing, the combination of anemia, hemolysis, and persistent agglutination is sufficient for diagnosis of IMHA. Immunochromatography offers an alternative to conventional DAT or flow cytometry, but confirming negative results by conventional DAT may be advisable because of frequent weak positive test strips in DAT-positive dogs. 11 For DAT, sensitivity ranged from 61 to 82% for dogs 27, 50 and 82% for cats 51 for studies reported between 2006 and 2016 that did not rely on DAT alone for the diagnosis of IMHA and reported sensitivity or sufficient information for its calculation. Specificity for DAT was 94%-100% for dogs 11, 27, 50, 52 and 95%-100% for cats 9, 51, 53 for studies published between 2006 and 2016 that reported specificity or sufficient information for its calculation. Although small experimental studies have reported sensitivities of up to 100% for flow cytometry, [54] [55] [56] [57] sensitivity was 67% (95% CI, 53%-79%) c in a larger study reporting results of routine clinical testing. 58 For studies including clinically ill negative controls, specificity for flow cytometry was 87.5% (95% CI, 47%-100%) c54 to 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%) c . 56 Reports of sample handling effects on flow cytometry are lacking.\n\nStorage of samples at 4 C for up to 7 days before DAT testing is acceptable unless the laboratory advises otherwise. 11 56, 58 However, the clinical value of the percentage of positive erythrocytes has not been evaluated rigorously. 56 \n\nIn dogs, spherocytes (assessed as described) can provide evidence of hemolysis, consistent with evidence of this phenomenon in human erythrocytes. 65, 66 The increased rigidity of spherocytes results in entrapment within the spleen and subsequent extravascular hemolysis. 28,67,68\n\nIn the absence of decreased functional hepatic mass, obstructive cholestasis, or sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia may represent evidence of hemolysis.\n\nAt least 1 of the following is considered sufficient evidence for hyperbilirubinemia: icterus, total serum or plasma bilirubin concentration above reference interval, bilirubinuria in cats, or \u22652+ bilirubin on a urine reagent strip in dogs. Bilirubin reported for hemolyzed samples should be interpreted in combination with information regarding the likely impact of hemolysis on the assay. 69 \n\nHemoglobinemia can be detected by visual examination of plasma or measurement of cell-free hemoglobin. When using instrument-based indicators of hemolysis, limitations of the individual method should be considered. For example, spectrophotometric hemolytic indices rely on manufacturer-specific methods and algorithms that are not directly comparable among different instruments. 70 Similarly, discrepancy between mean cell hemoglobin concentration and cellular hemoglobin concentration provided by ADVIA hematology instruments may reflect hemolysis or other sample characteristics, such as lipemia. 71 Hemoglobinemia should only be interpreted as evidence of hemolysis after eliminating artifactual hemolysis. Common causes of in vitro hemolysis include, but are not limited to, traumatic venipuncture, [72] [73] [74] [75] freezing, storage, and (based on studies in humans) sampling via an IV catheter 72, 76, 77 or post-collection injection of samples into vacutainers. 78 The likelihood of in vitro hemolysis is increased if factors that increase erythrocyte fragility are present (eg, lipemia). 79 Provided causes of myoglobinuria are absent, hemoglobinuria is considered present if urine is red and discoloration is not cleared by centrifugation, or if a positive heme reaction on urine dipstick is present in the absence of intact erythrocytes on microscopic sediment examination. Assessment of hemoglobinuria should be performed using a fresh urine sample, and anecdotally the likelihood of erythrocyte lysis in urine is increased in alkaline or poorly concentrated or hyposthenuric urine samples.\n\nGhost cells provide evidence of intravascular hemolysis if seen on a smear made immediately after blood collection. 3 87, 88 Other mechanisms such as circulating immune complex deposition and activation of immune cells through fraction crystallizable receptor engagement or delivery of immunoglobulinbound nucleic acid to Toll-like receptors also occur during some infections. 89 Damage to target cells is another mechanism that may make a pathogen particularly likely to induce autoimmunity by increased exposure of self-epitopes that normally are sequestered or inefficiently presented to immune cells. 81, 90 This proposed mechanism for the development of IMHA 91 contributes to the accelerated clearance of erythrocytes during Plasmodium infection in people and mice. 92 It also may occur during Babesia gibsoni infection in dogs and Mycoplasma haemofelis infection in cats. [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] Antibody-mediated removal is part of normal erythrocyte senescence. 98 Organisms thus may cause IMHA by amplifying normal antibody-mediated removal of aged or damaged erythrocytes. \n\nOverall, 66 manuscripts were reviewed. 3,9, 105, 125, 136 There is a high level of evidence that immune-mediated destruction of erythrocytes contributes to anemia in dogs infected with B. gibsoni. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia was documented in 69 dogs in 9 studies, [93] [94] [95] [96] 99, 102, 103, 111, 151 with an additional study (in which the number of infected dogs with IMHA could not be determined) providing useful mechanistic insight. 125 The median IME value was 5.32, ranging from 2.54 to 6.99. For this Babesia species, 88% (8/9) of the studies showed intermediate (4) or high (4) IME values.\n\nFour were studies of dogs experimentally infected with B. gibsoni, yielding a median IME value of 6.41 and range of 6.08-6.99. [94] [95] [96] 99 Natural infection with B. gibsoni occurs most commonly in fighting breeds. 102 Babesia species was not specified, but again was likely to be B. rossi. 122 Nine dogs with IMHA were documented in that study, with an IME value of 2.70. Thus, the evidence for large Babesia species causing IMHA is lower than that for B. gibsoni, attributed in part to the fact that most studies were not designed to determine if an association between IMHA and infection existed. Nevertheless, differences also may exist in pathogenicity among Babesia species that influence the risk of IMHA. For example, 1 study found that the majority of anemic B. vogeli-infected dogs had IgM and IgG bound to erythrocytes, but these antibodies were not detected in dogs infected with B. canis. 57 In this study, eccentrocytosis, suggesting oxidative damage, was more common in B. canis-infected dogs. The IME value for B. canis in this study was 0, whereas it was 5.73 for B. vogeli. 57 The mechanism of immune-mediated erythrocyte destruction during B. gibsoni infection has been explored. Because Babesia species infect erythrocytes, antibodies appropriately targeting the organisms could result in \"immune-mediated\" erythrocyte destruction without targeting self-antigen. However, antibodies produced during infection also appear to target erythrocyte membranes. Oxidative injury may play a role in anti-erythrocyte antibody formation. 96 Activated macrophages cause oxidative damage to uninfected as well as infected erythrocytes during B. gibsoni infection, a factor that may contribute to the severity of IMHA in some dogs. 96 In addition to oxidative damage, sialic acid residue removal is required to expose epitopes that are targeted by antibody. 94 Interestingly, anti-erythrocyte antibodies that developed in dogs experimentally infected with B. gibsoni did not attach to undamaged red blood cells in dogs that had recovered from clinical infection. 93 Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that Babesia-induced antibody reactivity against erythrocytes is higher for aged and oxidized than for fresh erythrocytes. 95 Taken together, these data suggest that ongoing damage to the red cell membrane and increased exposure of epitopes that are usually \"hidden\" facilitates immune-mediated erythrocyte destruction. Once infection is controlled, the drive for immune- The IME values could not be calculated, because the total number of dogs with IMHA could not be discerned.\n\nThe evidence that piroplasms, and in particular B. gibsoni, cause IMHA is intermediate to high. For B. gibsoni, evidence suggests that during infection, antibodies target host erythrocyte antigens exposed as a consequence of transient oxidative damage or sialic acid residue removal.\n\nFurther study is needed to determine if differences in pathogenicity among species, host factors, or both mediate risk of development of IMHA in infected dogs. What is known about the mechanism of erythrocyte destruction suggests that immunosuppression should not be necessary to resolve immune-mediated erythrocyte destruction in most cases.\n\nNine dogs with IMHA in 5 studies were infected with, or exposed to, Anaplasma phagocytophilum. 101, 108, 126, 129, 150 The median IME value was 3.53, with a range of 2. 62-4.25 . In addition to IMHA, plateletbound antibodies were documented in some dogs with concurrent thrombocytopenia. 101, 108 Although most dogs in these reports were treated concurrently with doxycycline and immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment, 1 dog responded to doxycycline treatment alone, 150 whereas another dog had prednisone discontinued after 2 days. 108 One retrospective case series documented 2 dogs with acute Anaplasma platys infections with concurrent IMHA. 100 Both dogs had spherocytosis and positive saline agglutination and Coombs' test results supporting the diagnosis of IMHA. The IME value for this study was 3.76.\n\nThe evidence that A. phagocytophilum causes IMHA is low. However, most studies reporting A. phagocytophilum in dogs with IMHA were limited to case reports or retrospective studies, and were not designed \n\nAlthough studies are limited, an intermediate level of evidence was found that B. felis causes IMHA in cats, and that treatment resolves IMHA without immunosuppression.\n\nSeven studies documenting IMHA in 21 cats infected with hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. yielded IME values. 3 \n\nSeven studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified. 3, 9, 110, 119, 138, 153, 154 However, other comorbidities such as erythroleukemia, myeloproliferative disease, chronic interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis and splenic amyloidosis, and drug administration were documented in some infected cats, precluding IME calculation. 110, 138, 153, 154 The median IME value for the others was 3.77, with a range of 1.87-5.04. 3, 9, 110, 119, 153, 154 Consensus Summary Statement \n\nImmune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a recognized paraneoplastic syndrome in people. [155] [156] [157] [158] Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a wellestablished cause of IMHA in people. 155, 156 Other neoplasms have been associated with IMHA in humans, but the causal mechanisms remain elusive. 157, 158 The IME values could be calculated for 13 studies ( Figure 6 ). The global median IME value was 1.87, with a range from 1.70 to 3.12, thus representing levels of evidence that were negligible (29 IME values; 70 patients) or low (3 IME values; 3 patients).\n\nThe generally low level of evidence reflects the fact that the majority of the published studies did not specifically ask whether cancer is \n\nEvidence of a causal link between cancer and IMHA in dogs currently is lacking in the veterinary literature, largely reflecting the fact that the majority of the published studies did not specifically ask whether cancer was associated with IMHA in dogs. Further studies are needed to determine if such an association exists. Although no evidence for a causal link exists, cancer cannot be eliminated as a potential trigger for this disease.\n\nFive studies reported 21 cats with neoplasia and IMHA (Figure 7) .\n\nThese studies provide negligible evidence for a causal link between neoplasia and IMHA, yielding a median IME value of 1.87 and a range of 1. 7-4.4 . No study specifically addressed this hypothesis. In a single retrospective study of 107 cats with IMHA, concurrent neoplasia was present in 16 (15%) cats. 3 \n\nEight cats for which an IME value could be calculated for lymphoma and IMHA were identified. 3, 9, 164 Two of the 3 studies reporting these cases did not demonstrate a causal association between IMHA and lymphoma, 3,9 and 1 study was considered to partially report or suggest causality. 164 The latter reports 2 sibling specific pathogen-free experimental cats. For both cats, lymphoma/lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed on histological review after necropsy. However, interpretation of the histology in both cats was equivocal. The histological pattern was described as multicentric T-lymphoblastic infiltration with associated B-lymphocyte proliferation, which the authors concluded was most likely a lymphoproliferative disorder, but they did not eliminate an aberrant immune response. For A single cat with multiple myeloma and IMHA was identified. 3 This study did not show a causal association between neoplasia and IMHA, and the method of diagnosis of neoplasia was unclear. The evidence for an association between IMHA and multiple myeloma was negligible, with an IME value of 1.70.\n\nThree cats with erythroleukemia 3,153 and 3 cats with non-specified myeloproliferative disease 110 and IMHA were identified. No study demonstrated a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia. The report of 2 of the cats with erythroleukemia suggests that diagnosis was based on bone marrow cytological or histological review, or both. 3 The method of diagnosis of neoplasia was not described for the third cat with erythroleukemia. 153 For the cats with non-specified myeloproliferative disease, the diagnosis was based on bone marrow examination, but details are limited. 110 All cats with non-specified myeloproliferative disease were FeLV positive. 110 The evidence for a causal association between erythroleukemia and IMHA is negligible, with an IME value for the 1 study in which it could be assigned of 1.87. 3 Other studies of erythroleukemia or unspecified myeloproliferarative disease did not yield IME values because of the presence of comorbidities.\n\nA single cat with histiocytic sarcoma and IMHA was identified. 3 This study did not show a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia, and the method of diagnosis of neoplasia was not described, yielding an IME value of 1.70.\n\nA single case of pancreatic carcinoma 110 and a single case of anaplastic sarcoma 3 with giant cells in cats with IMHA were identified. Neither study showed a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia.\n\nThe evidence for a causal association between IMHA and carcinoma, and sarcoma, was negligible, with an IME value of 1.70 in each case.\n\nOne cat with IMHA and uncharacterized gastrointestinal neoplasia 51 and 6 cats with IMHA and uncharacterized masses 3 were identified. A causal association between IMHA and these lesions was not identified. The method of diagnosis for the presumed neoplastic lesions was not described. The evidence for a causal association between IMHA and uncharacterized gastrointestinal neoplasia is low, with an IME value of 3.92, and negligible for uncharacterized masses, with an IME value of 2.04.\n\nCurrently, no strong evidence exists for a causal link between cancer and IMHA in cats; further studies are needed to determine if such an association exists. Nevertheless, retrospective evidence suggests a relatively high prevalence of concurrent cancer in cats with IMHA.\n\nInflammation that often occurs with IMHA could indirectly lead to pancreatitis by activation of neutrophils or formation of thromboemboli. Subsequent oxidative damage, ischemic events, or both then may directly damage the pancreas. Alternatively, inflammation associated with pancreatitis could lead to IMHA by indirectly inducing autoantibodies to form against erythrocytes. Autoantibodies that bind to epitopes on both exocrine pancreatic epithelium and erythrocytes also may be generated. 165 To date, none of these hypotheses has been confirmed in veterinary species. Observation of concurrent pancreatitis and IMHA has been reported in an 8-year-old female Cocker Spaniel 166 and in some retrospective studies of dogs with IMHA ( Figure 8 ). Studies that evaluated groups of dogs with IMHA indicate that the prevalence of concurrent pancreatitis is low, between 1% (1/93 IMHA dogs 142 ) and 5% (1/19 dogs 10 ). Both of these studies yielded an IME value for pancreatitis of 1.70. 10, 142 The Cocker Spaniel in the case report had both IMHA and pancreatitis. 166 However, cholestasis and renal failure also were present. Although cholestasis and renal failure can be complications of pancreatitis, primary organ disease could not be eliminated, precluding calculation of an IME value.\n\nA recent study of 11 cats with IMHA showed that 3 of these cats (3/11; 27.3%) had pancreatitis, 165 yielding an IME value of 3.99. This study was designed to answer the question of whether IMHA is associated with pancreatitis. 165 Another large study of cats with IMHA indicated that 6/107 (5.6%) had concurrent cholangitis, pancreatitis, or both. 3 An IME value could not be calculated because information regarding the number of cats with pancreatitis alone was not specified.\n\nThe evidence for pancreatitis causing IMHA is negligible in dogs and negligible to low in cats. Additional studies would be required to establish a causal relationship.\n\nOne study attributed secondary IMHA to concurrent liver necrosis 12 and another to concurrent necrotizing inflammation of the tail, 2 both in single patients; both studies yielded an IME value of 1.70. Further evaluation of these patients was not pursued.\n\nThe evidence for necrosis as a cause of IMHA is negligible in dogs and is not reported in cats. \n\nAnecdotal reports suggest that generalized inflammatory processes induce IMHA in dogs and cats, but direct evidence is lacking. Welldesigned studies to determine whether non-infectious inflammatory processes cause IMHA are warranted.\n\nSeventeen studies described dogs with IMHA that had been exposed to drugs or toxins, 1, 10, 12, 27, 34, 80, 116, 127, 135, 142, 143, 160, [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] but only 11 reported cases with sufficient primary data for the calculation of an IME value. 10, 12, 27, 34, 80, 142, 143, [168] [169] [170] 172 The majority of cases (35/36) were dogs exposed to antimicrobial drugs. 10, 80, 142, 143, 168, 170 For these cases, IME values ranged from 1.70 to 7.09, with a median of 1.87 ( Figure 9 ). The highest level of evidence, with an IME value of 7.09, came from 1 unblinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial in which 6 of 14 dogs given escalating doses of cefazedone acquired anti-erythrocyte antibodies. 168 The remaining reported cases were associated with low or negligible evidence to support other drugs or toxins as a cause for IMHA in dogs (Figure 9 ).\n\nTwo papers describe the development of IMHA after administration of propylthiouracil to cats, with respective IME values of 7.33 and 4.19. In the first study of 105 cats, 7 cats with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil developed immune-mediated drug reactions. 173 This finding was followed by a prospective, un-blinded, non-randomized trial in which 17 healthy cats were given the same drug, causing 9 to develop Coombs' test-positive anemia. 174 One additional case report describes warfarin exposure in a cat with IMHA, with an IME value of 1.70. 110\n\nThe prevalence of drug-induced IMHA in dogs and cats is either rare or underreported. However, a lack of evidence does not preclude the possibility of a drug or toxin triggering IMHA.\n\nThe most effective vaccines elicit robust immune responses only against the pathogen of interest. However, vaccines also may elicit unfavorable immune responses resulting from mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, bystander cell activation, or downregulation of self-tolerance, which contribute to autoimmunity. 175 22, 80, 116, 143, 170, 180, 181 Three papers provide evidence for a link between vaccination and IMHA in the low range, with IME values between 2.95 and 4.37. 5, 177, 178 No publications that provide high levels of evidence to support an association between vaccination and IMHA were found.\n\nTwo studies reported intent to evaluate an association between vaccines and IMHA. In 1 retrospective study, associated with an IME value of 5.76, a difference was found in the frequency of IMHA cases diagnosed within the first month after vaccination and those diagnosed at subsequent months, whereas a similar temporal distribution was not identified in a control group. 179 A subsequent study had a similar Q score, but showed no difference in the number of cases with recent vaccination history between the IMHA and control groups, and therefore was awarded an IME value of 0. 107 Other papers we reviewed excluded patients with a recent vaccination history, with the intent of describing only dogs with idiopathic IMHA. [182] [183] [184] [185] In addition, some papers did not include the vaccination status of dogs with IMHA. 56, 101, 161, 186, 187 Other data we excluded from analysis included studies with an uncertain diagnosis of IMHA, 188, 189 case studies in which alternative causes of IMHA were possible, 171, 190 and cases from studies in which the timing of vaccination was not specified. 16 Only 1 study prospectively investigated a link between vaccination and autoimmune disease in 5 dogs, demonstrating the presence of autoantibodies after vaccine administration.\n\nHowever, these dogs only were followed for 21 days after vaccination and did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of IMHA. 191 With only 2 papers in the veterinary literature aiming to evaluate a link between vaccination and IMHA, and each of these respectively supporting 179 or refuting 107 an association, the question of whether vaccines trigger IMHA in dogs remains unanswered. Similarly, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether vaccination triggers autoimmune disease in people. 192 No reports of an association between vaccine administration and IMHA in cats were found. is not recommended, unless clinical presentation suggests that it is a credible differential diagnosis.\n\nHistory will help assess the likely risk of certain infections. A thorough physical examination and diagnostic imaging will help identify any potential nidus of infection or the presence of neoplastic lesions. Patterns of abnormalities identified on the CBC, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis can increase the index of suspicion for specific infectious agents that may be associated with IMHA. [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] [201] [202] This minimum database also can identify additional pathological processes (eg, proteinuria) that may require specific treatment. Although insensitive, blood F I G U R E 9 Integrated metric of evidence (IME) values for drugs. Horizontal dotted lines indicate the threshold IME values between negligible and low (2.95), low and intermediate (4.37) , and intermediate and high (5.78 ) levels of evidence. The single antimicrobial drug yielding highlevel evidence in dogs was cefazedone. NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug smear examination can be useful in identifying the presence of vector-borne disease agents. Although the evidence associated with urinary tract infection as a cause of IMHA is negligible, identification and treatment of infection before immunosuppression is prudent. We refer the reader to the ACVIM consensus statement on the treatment of IMHA (in press) for further recommendations and additional discussion on the specific circumstance of treating subclinical bacteriuria in an immunosuppressed patient. The evidence that gastrointestinal parasites cause IMHA in dogs is low, but rapid resolution of IMHA with treatment and minimal immunosuppression has been described (Supporting Information S5). 121 \n\nIdentification of Babesia spp. by light microscopy of blood smears is considered insensitive for screening in cats. Polymerase chain reaction to identify parasitic DNA or RNA is recommended. 218 \n\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend withholding necessary medications for dogs and cats with IMHA. However, all medications, particularly those previously implicated in immune-mediated diseases, should be used with caution in patients with IMHA. Every patient should ideally have a complete history recorded, which includes all vaccines and drugs administered, the doses, dates, frequency, duration, and route of their administration, and information about the products being used such as manufacturer, indications, specific lot, and any adverse events. Exposure to toxins should also be documented in any dog or cat with IMHA.\n\nEvidence for cefazedone in dogs 168 and propylthiouracil in cats 173, 174 suggests that >1 class of drugs may be associated with IMHA in small animals. For most commonly prescribed medications, the evidence is \n\nBased on the data analyzed here, we propose a unified model for the pathogenesis of IMHA and a new system of nomenclature, in which the disease is categorized as \"non-associative\" and \"associative\" rather than \"primary\" and \"secondary,\" respectively ( Figure 10A,B) . This clarification is needed because the word \"primary\" implies that all triggers have been definitively ruled out, whereas \"secondary\" implies causation. We propose that the term \"associative\" be used when a comorbidity is identified. In some cases, the comorbidity might have caused the IMHA (secondary IMHA), whereas in others it might be coincidental (primary IMHA). \"Non-associative\" IMHA cases are those in which comorbidities are not identified in the diagnostic evaluation, and include primary (\"idiopathic\") and cryptogenic cases. The latter implies that an underlying cause was not identified, perhaps because the underlying pathomechanisms are not currently understood, or the comorbidity could not be detected using available testing.\n\nWhen the VCCIS task forces were formed, we began by identifying a focused question that represented an important problem in veterinary immunology, namely \"What is the evidence that infection, neoplasia, drugs, vaccines, and other comorbidities cause IMHA in dogs and cats?\" Our original intent was to perform a systematic review of the literature to answer this question. However, it quickly became apparent that very few studies in the veterinary literature were designed to determine if a given comorbidity causes IMHA, hence an expanded approach was used to evaluate the evidence presented in our review.\n\nThere is a critical need for well-designed, prospective, case-controlled clinical studies that directly ask the question of whether infections, neoplasia, drugs, and vaccines cause IMHA. Some comorbidities are likely to cause IMHA in a large number of affected patients, such as an infection that expresses an epitope mimicking an erythrocyte antigen widely expressed in a population, or an organism that causes (A) (B) F I G U R E 1 0 Iceberg model and proposed new nomenclature for immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). A, The iceberg model posits that pathomechanisms underlying IMHA fall on a spectrum, both recognized (above the water level) and currently unrecognized or occult (concealed), the latter postulated to be the majority. Hypothetical occult pathomechanisms are listed. B, We propose a new nomenclature for IMHA to better reflect the heterogeneity in pathomechanisms underlying IMHA transient expression of normally hidden epitopes. Others might induce IMHA only in patients with epigenetic and genetic predisposition, or a given inflammatory context. Studies that investigate how individual comorbidities trigger IMHA, and the role of genetics and epigenetics, will help identify what diseases to screen for in all patients, and what diseases to screen for in selected patients that may be at increased risk of developing IMHA from any trigger. Mechanistic studies also will determine which comorbidities, when treated, will lead to resolution of IMHA without the need for immunosuppression. Stringent criteria for the diagnosis of IMHA and definitive diagnosis of a comorbidity must be integrated into study design in order to make meaningful observations. \n\nJonathan Fogle has been paid by Merial for speaking engagements and continuing education.
