{"title": "", "body": "Weight loss of greater than 10% of body weight is significant and should be investigated.\n\nAny cause of weight loss may present as failure to grow or stunting if affecting an immature cat.\n\nWeight loss occurs when there are one or more of the following: \u2022 Inappetence (inadequate caloric intake). \u2022 Inability to digest or absorb nutrients (e.g. pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease). \u2022 Inability to utilize absorbed nutrients (e.g. diabetes mellitus). \u2022 Increased utilization of absorbed nutrients (e.g. hyperthyroidism, fever).\n\nChronic renal failure is defined as primary renal failure that has persisted for an extended period (usually greater than 2 weeks).\n\nChronic renal failure is associated with irreversible structural lesions in the kidney.\n\nChronic renal failure is the end result of many disease processes affecting the kidney:\n\n\u2022 Anomaly: Familial renal disease, polycystic kidney disease. \u2022 Metabolic: Hypercalcemia (from cholecalciferol rodenticide, granulomatous disease or neoplasia), ischemic injury. \u2022 Mechanical: Chronic urinary tract obstruction (e.g. urolith) resulting in hydronephrosis. \u2022 Neoplastic: Lymphoma, primary neoplasia. \u2022 Infectious: Feline infectious peritonitis, upper urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis). \u2022 Immune: Secondary to glomerulonephritits, amyloidosis. \u2022 Toxic: Therapeutic agents (e.g. gentamicin, amphotericin B, NSAIDs), intravenous contrast agents, heavy metals (e.g. lead), hemaglobin, ethylene glycol and plants (lilies).\n\nThe initiating cause of chronic renal failure is often not identified.\n\nAt the time of diagnosis there is usually diffuse pathology of the renal parenchyma termed chronic generalized nephropathy.\n\nPolycystic kidney disease is a common cause of renal failure in some breeds of cats and has the following characteristics:\n\n\u2022 Renal cysts may be congenital or acquired and may affect one or both kidneys. \u2022 Polycystic kidney disease is characterized by multiple cysts occurring in both kidneys. \u2022 Polycystic kidney disease occurs as an autosomal dominant inherited renal disease of Persian and Persian-related cats, with a prevalence of at least 45% in some Persian populations. \u2022 Renal cysts are fluid-filled sacs lined with epithelium, that generally originate in existing nephrons and may therefore occur in the renal cortex or medulla. Cystic structures have also been noted in other organs, such as the liver, in cats with polycystic kidney disease.\n\n\u2022 Cysts vary in size and tend to increase in number and size with time. Eventually progressive cyst enlargement compresses the adjacent renal parenchyma and if sufficient renal mass is affected renal failure will develop. Renal failure may occur at any age, however affected Persian cats typically present at approximately 7 years. \u2022 Renomegaly may be obvious with the kidneys being irregular in outline. Laboratory evaluation is necessary to determine the extent of the renal dysfunction. Ultrasonographic examination is noninvasive and a very sensitive diagnostic technique for this condition. Cysts are seen as multiple, round anechoic regions.\n\nIn chronic renal failure resulting from many of the disease processes, renal function often slowly deteriorates over months or years, but the rate of deterioration is very variable between cats. Deterioration is not necessarily linear and many cats are stable for long periods of time with intermittent acute decrements. The postulated causes of progression include: \u2022 Primary disease process; the inciting cause may lead to ongoing renal damage. \u2022 Systemic and metabolic derangements of chronic renal failure. \u2022 Renal compensatory mechanisms (increase in single nephron glomerular filtration rate).\n\nIn chronic renal failure, surviving functional nephrons undergo compensatory changes including glomerular hypertension, hypertrophy and hyperfiltration (leading to an increase in single nephron glomerular filtration rate).\n\n\u2022 These adaptive mechanisms compensate for the loss of nephrons and so minimize the overall decrease in glomerular filtration rate. \u2022 However, it is postulated, based on extrapolation from other species, that these compensatory changes are maladaptive and represent a final common pathway for the progression to eventual glomerular sclerosis and end stage renal failure.\n\nChronic renal failure is mainly a disease of older cats, with Persian, Abyssinian, Maine coon, Siamese and Burmese breeds of cat being identified to be at increased risk.\n\nEarly cases may be asymptomatic.\n\nSigns associated with chronic renal failure result from failure of excretory, regulatory and synthetic functions of the kidney.\n\nPolydipsia is the most commonly reported clinical sign. The polydipsia is compensatory to an obligatory polyuria. If fluid intake is insufficient, dehydration will result. Polyuria results from: \u2022 Increased solute load in surviving functional nephrons (solute diuresis). \u2022 Disruption of medullary anatomy. \u2022 Impaired response to antidiuretic hormone.\n\nInappetence or anorexia, weight loss and poor body condition are common clinical signs as the disease progresses.\n\nLethargy, weakness and depression.\n\nVomiting (with possible hematemesis) is usually intermittent and often low grade. Vomiting and nausea may be associated with: \u2022 The action of uremic toxins on the medullary emetic chemoreceptor trigger zone. \u2022 Uremic gastritis and gastrointestinal ulceration.\n\nSevere uremia associated with an acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure (acute on chronic) or end-stage chronic renal failure may be associated with extreme clinical signs including: \u2022 Halitosis, ulceration of oral mucosa or tongue and brownish discoloration of dorsal surface and sloughing of anterior tip of tongue (due to fibinoid necrosis, arteritis and bacterial degradation of urea to ammonia). \u2022 Occasionally diarrhea, which may be hemorrhagic from uremic enterocolitis. \u2022 Terminally, seizures, stupor or coma may occur.\n\nClinical signs relating to systemic arterial hypertension are common. Hypertension is reported in 29-61% of cats with chronic renal failure. Clinical signs which may be associated with hypertension include: \u2022 Ocular signs include sudden blindness with dilated pupils, hyphema or retinal hemorrhage, retinal edema, retinal vessel tortuosity, retinal detachment. \u2022 Systolic heart murmurs and a gallop rhythm. \u2022 Neurological signs including seizures and stupor.\n\nSmall and/or irregular kidneys may be palpable, occasionally kidneys are enlarged (for example in neoplastic or cystic kidney disease).\n\nDiagnosis is based on demonstration of persistently decreased renal excretory function. \u2022 Persistently elevated blood urea and creatinine concentrations (azotemia) are indicative. \u2022 Chronicity and stability is based on two assessments, ideally at a 2-4 week interval.\n\nDiagnosis is further supported by demonstration of tubular dysfunction:\n\n\u2022 Urine specific gravity of less than 1.030 (typically less than 1.020).\n\nAttempt to identify the renal disease initiating the failure using all or any of the following tests:\n\n\u2022 Routine hematology and biochemistry.\n\n\u2022 Routine urinalysis (including microscopic sediment examination). \u2022 Assessment of proteinuria by urine protein:creatinine ratio. Proteinuria is typically very low (1.5-2 times increase in protein excretion), unless there is significant glomerular disease. \u2022 Quantitative urine bacterial culture. \u2022 Imaging, either radiography to assess renal size and shape, and/or ultrasound examination to assess renal architecture. \u2022 Renal cytology (fine needle aspiration biopsy) and\n\nbiopsy.\n\n-However, due to the high risk and low diagnostic yield of histopathology in CRF, biopsy is rarely indicated unless atypical features such as renomegaly, proteinuria or hematuria are present. Biopsy is only indicated in cases where the result of histopathology will influence the treatment options and therefore, outcome of the case.\n\nSecondary hyperperathyroidism, hypokalemia, anemia and systemic hypertension are all possible complications of chronic renal failure.\n\nRenal secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excess circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting from altered mineral homeostasis in renal failure, and is present in approximately 80% of cats with chronic renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Chronically increased PTH concentrations are toxic to the kidney and contribute to ongoing loss of renal function. \u2022 Factors involved in the pathogenesis of renal hyperparathyroidism leading to increased PTH concentrations include phosphate retention with declining glomerular filtration rate, hypocalcemia and decreased synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) by proximal tubular cells. \u2022 Diagnosis is based on elevated PTH concentrations in a cat with chronic renal failure, and normal or slightly low serum calcium concentrations. Measurement of ionized calcium is a better indicator of calcium levels than total calcium. Cats with chronic renal failure and hyperphosphatemia will be hyperparathyroid.\n\n-Samples for PTH assay require special handling, therefore contact the diagnostic laboratory. \u2022 Hypokalemia occurs in many cats (20-30%) with polyuric renal failure. \u2022 Hypokalemia may be a consequence or cause of chronic renal failure in the cat. \u2022 The mechanism is unknown but increased renal losses of potassium, decreased dietary intake and decreased gastrointestinal absorption are implicated. \u2022 Clinical signs of inappetence and generalized muscle weakness (such as ataxia, inability to jump, stiff, stilted gait and ventroflexion of the neck) may occur.\n\nNormochromic, normocytic, nonregenerative anemia is common when chronic renal failure is advanced.\n\n\u2022 Occurs mainly from relative erythropoietin deficiency, but other factors contribute, such as decreased red cell life span, uremic suppression of erythropoiesis and gastrointestinal blood loss. \u2022 Routine hematology should be used to monitor anemia and rule out other causes.\n\nSystemic hypertension is present in many cats with chronic renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Diagnosis is based on serial blood pressure measurements.\n\n\u2022 Systemic hypertension is usually measured using a Doppler technique (Doppler ultrasonic sphygmomanometry) to assess systolic blood pressure. \u2022 Normal range is technique dependent, however systolic pressures > 200 mmHg indicate severe hypertension. \u2022 Retinal examination to detect end organ damage should also be carried out.\n\nProteinuria is a risk factor for progression of chronic renal insufficiency in cats, and may be a marker of glomerular hypertension. Median survival times are significantly reduced if the urine protein/creatinine ratio is > 0.43.\n\nAll chronic renal failure cases should receive regular monitoring, involving full clinical examination (including assessment of body weight), measurement of systemic arterial blood pressure and analysis of blood and urine samples. This allows early detection of problems, and assessment of efficacy of therapy and tailoring of treatment to the individual.\n\nPre-renal azotemia occurs secondary to dehydration or circulatory collapse, and the azotemia results from reduced renal perfusion.\n\n\u2022 Typically urine specific gravity is greater than 1.035.\n\n\u2022 Pre-renal azotemia concurrent with primary disease affecting renal concentrating ability can mimic renal failure, for example a dehydrated cat with diabetes inspidus.\n\nAcute renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Therapeutically and prognostically it is important to distinguish between chronic and acute renal failure. \u2022 Evidence of chronicity is usually obvious from the history (polydipsia, weight loss), physical examination (small kidneys), and diagnostic tests (non-regenerative anemia). \u2022 Due to the gradual decline in glomerular filtration rate in chronic compared to acute renal failure, clinical signs in chronic renal failure tend to be less dramatic relative to the metabolic derangements.\n\nTreatment of chronic renal failure is aimed at:\n\n\u2022 Ameliorating the clinical signs and systemic complications associated with renal dysfunction. \u2022 Prevention of further deterioration of renal function (progression).\n\n-Management of end-stage renal failure by renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant) is generally prohibitive because of cost, technical and ethical considerations.\n\nAlthough chronic renal failure is irreversible, many cats presented in a uremic crisis have superimposed prerenal azotemia or acute renal failure (so called acute on chronic).\n\n\u2022 It is very important that appropriate therapy be used to correct reversible azotemia. \u2022 Once reversible azotemia is corrected, more accurate assessment of the severity of the underlying irreversible chronic renal failure can be made.\n\n\u2022 Identifying and eliminating the inciting cause of the renal damage. \u2022 Correcting the systemic and metabolic derangements of chronic renal failure. \u2022 Preventing the intrinsic progression of renal failure (if such progression occurs in the cat).\n\n-A number of therapeutic maneuvers may be effective slowing intrinsic progression. These include dietary protein restriction, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, modification of dietary lipid intake and phosphate restriction. Evidence for a beneficial effect on survival for each of these treatments is limited and therefore currently each case should be assessed on an individual basis.\n\n\u2022 Unrestricted access to water is essential in any cat with chronic renal failure to allow thirst to compensate for the obligatory polyuria. Additional fluids (oral, subcutaneous or intravenous) may be required when intake fails to keep pace with diuresis. Home administration of subcutaneous fluids are indicated when the cat is unable to maintain hydration. Typically, cats require 75-150 ml SQ q 12-72 h. Begin a 4-5 kg cat on 150 ml twice weekly, and use normal saline with 35 mmol (mEq)/L of KCl added. Education of the owner on proper administration and sterile technique is vital.\n\nDietary management of chronic renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Treatment of cats with chronic renal failure by dietary modification has been proven to significantly increase survival. Generally, commercially available \"renal diets\" are recommended. These diets have restricted protein, calcium, sodium, phosphorus and acid-load, and added potassium.\n\nDietary protein restriction is frequently advocated.\n\n\u2022 In moderate to severe chronic renal failure, controlled restriction of non-essential protein will reduce the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products that are believed to contribute to the uremic syndrome. \u2022 More controversially, the use of a restricted protein diet in early CRF may slow the rate of progression to end-stage renal failure by preventing maladaptive changes in surviving nephrons. However, evidence for a beneficial effect of protein restriction on renal function in cats with early renal failure is not available. \u2022 Poor appetite and the decreased palatability of restricted protein diets make mal-nutrition a serious problem in renal-failure patients. Monitor carefully for weight loss and decreasing muscle mass. \u2022 Dietary protein intake should be tailored to the metabolic needs of the individual cat. Usually a diet containing at least 21% of gross energy as protein is required (usual maintenance diets contain 35-55% gross energy as protein). The goal is to maintain a BUN of \u2264 29 mmol/L (80 mg/dl). In general, the more severe the renal dysfunction, the greater the protein restriction required, but protein should not be decreased below 19-20% of gross energy (metabolizable energy).\n\nA number of other dietary components have been studied for their effect to modify the rate of progression including calorie intake and fatty acid composition. Dietary phosphate restriction is discussed under the section on renal secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have a renoprotective effect, which is independent of any effect on systemic blood pressure. ACE inhibitor therapy may also be useful in reducing the degree of proteinuria in cats with chronic renal failure. benazepril 0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO q 24 h.\n\n\u2022 The mechanisms of these effects are unclear, but may be hemodynamically mediated by causing renal vasodilation especially of the efferent arteriole, and reducing glomerular capillary pressure. \u2022 Preliminary studies of ACE inhibitor use in naturally occurring chronic renal failure in cats have shown significantly increased survival times for the subgroup of renal-failure cats with urine protein/creatinine ratios > 1. \u2022 By reducing glomerular pressure, ACE inhibition would be expected to cause a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and so may increase azotemia. A rise in creatinine of > 50% warrants withdrawal of the drug.\n\nTreatment of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism should be instituted in a staged manner.\n\nThe cornerstone of therapy is dietary phosphate restriction.\n\n\u2022 After initiation of phosphate restriction, plasma phosphate levels usually stabilize at a lower level by 2-8 weeks, however PTH concentrations may continue to decline without additional intervention. \u2022 Proteinaceous foods are the main source of phosphate in the diet, so phosphate restriction is generally combined with protein restriction. \u2022 The aim of dietary phosphate restriction is to reduce plasma phosphorus to the lower limit of the reference range, the point at which the most effective control of PTH secretion is usually attained. Treatment with an active form of vitamin D directly inhibits PTH secretion. This group of drugs has a very narrow therapeutic index.\n\n\u2022 Calcitriol or alphacalcidol 1.5-3.5 ng/kg/day PO on an empty stomach (maximum 10 ng/kg/day). Because of the very low dose, the human preparations must be re-formulated by a compounding pharmacy for use in cats. \u2022 All active vitamin D preparations enhance intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and so are contraindicated unless plasma concentrations of calcium and phosphate are normal. In addition, they are ineffective in decreasing PTH concentrations if phosphorus is elevated. Phosphorus concentration must be below 2 mmol/L (6 mg/dl) before calcitriol use is optimal. Between serum phosphorus of 2-2.25 mmol/L (6-7 mg/dl), the effectiveness of calcitriol is decreased, and above a phosphorus of 2.5 mmol/L (8 mg/dl) it is ineffective in reducing PTH concentration. \u2022 Plasma calcium must be closely monitored, initially weekly. If possible measure ionized calcium rather than total calcium. The dosage should be titrated to maintain normocalcemia, not merely to decrease PTH concentrations, and therapy should be discontinued if hypercalcemia occurs. If hypercalcemia does not resolve within 7-10 days of stopping calcitriol, begin intermittent dosing of calcitriol. For cats with mild hypercalcemia based on the ionized calcium concentration, give calcitriol every other day at twice the daily dose, so the total amount per week is the same. If calcium levels do not decrease, try twice weekly dosing at 3.5 times the daily dose (8 pm one day and 8 am 4 days later). Do not use less than twice weekly. PTH concentrations should be measured to document successful control of renal secondary hyperpara-thyroidism.\n\n\u2022 The long-term advantages of this form of therapy are as yet unproven. The aim is to decrease progression of renal failure through a reduction in PTH concentrations. If there is marked hypercalcemia based on measurement of ionized calcium, care should be taken to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia, because the hypercalcemia of renal failure is usually only mild to moderate in severity (total calcium <3.4 mmol/L or 13.5 mg/dl).\n\nHypokalemia may be treated with oral potassium gluconate (2-6 mmol/cat/day PO). The exact dose is dependent on the response to therapy, determined by monitoring plasma potassium concentrations.\n\nManagement of the anemia of CRF should include an initial assessment of the cat to rule out and treat other potential causes of anemia, such as flea infestation and gastrointestinal ulceration.\n\nNutritional and iron deficiencies will impair the erythropoietic potential, and should be corrected prior to initiating other treatment.\n\nBlood transfusions (limited availability), androgen (poor efficacy) and recombinant erythropoietin therapy have all been used to treat the anemia of CRF.\n\n\u2022 Therapy should be started only if clinical signs relating to the anemia are present, such as weakness, inactivity or lethargy, which is usually when the packed cell volume (PCV) is less than 18%. Because of potential side effects of treatment, it is usually only commenced once PCV is <15%. \u2022 Initial dosage is 50-100 U/kg injected subcutaneously three times weekly, with PCV monitored at least twice weekly. Once the PCV has increased to the lower end of the reference range, the dosage is usually reduced to once or twice weekly. \u2022 Adverse effects of rHuEPO include polycythemia, seizures, hypersensitivity reactions and systemic hypertension. Absolute failure to respond to rHuEPO is usually due to iron deficiency. \u2022 After an initial response, many treated cats develop antibodies to rHuEPO, which leads to a severe refractory anemia greater than that present prior to treatment. This anemia is usually reversible when therapy is discontinued. For this reason rHuEPO should not be initiated too early in the course of progressive CRF.\n\n\u2022 Treatment is usually carried out on a trial basis, monitoring for a decrease in blood pressure without adverse effects or the development of hypotension.\n\nGenerally a period of about 2 weeks is sufficient to document a response. If severe clinical signs are present, therapy may need to be more aggressive. \u2022 Classically, a staged therapeutic response is recommended, starting with dietary sodium restriction, followed by the use of various pharmacological agents.\n\nThe current treatment of choice for the cat is amlodipine besylate. An initial dose of 0.625 mg/cat PO q 24 h is recommended and may be increased cautiously if the response is poor, to 1.25 mg daily.\n\nCombination therapy is required in some cases, with the addition of an ACE inhibitor or beta blocker.\n\nTreatment of proteinuria involves protein restriction to maintain a BUN of \u2264 29 mmol/L (80 mg/dl) and use of an ACE inhibitor to reduce glomerular pressure.\n\nTreatment of anorexia associated with chronic renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia is usually associated with moderate to severe uremia, and contributes to further uremia by resulting in catabolism of tissue protein for energy. \u2022 Change food gradually over 1-2 weeks in a renal diet, and increase palatability by warming to just below body temperature.\n\nReduce gastric hyperacidity from hypergastrinemia. \u2022 H2-receptor antagonists such as famotidine (0.5-1 mg/kg PO q 24 hours). \u2022 Gastric mucosal protectant, sucralfate (250 mg/cat q 8-12 hours, on an empty stomach).\n\nModify doses of drugs if excreted by kidneys.\n\nChronic renal failure tends to be progressive and the long-term prognosis is poor, although with careful management some cats will live for years.\n\nSince the majority of cases of chronic renal failure are of unknown primary cause, there are currently no preventative recommendations.\n\nAvoid any potential renal insults, particularly in cats with pre-existing comprise of renal function or renal perfusion. For example, avoid using NSAIDs in dehydrated cats, and use intravenous fluids prior to induction of anesthesia and during surgery, to maintain renal perfusion in elderly cats and cats with compromised renal function. Remember that minor renal insults may summate to cause clinically significant renal damage.\n\n\u2022 Promptly and appropriately treat conditions causing decreased renal perfusion including dehydration, shock and hypotension associated with anesthesia and surgery.\n\nPre-renal and post-renal azotaemia, if not corrected, may lead to renal damage and renal failure.\n\n\u2022 Middle-aged to older cats, particularly entire males and feral cats. \u2022 Clinical signs variable, often vague. \u2022 Weight loss, inappetence. \u2022 Pyrexia, lymphadenopathy. \u2022 Immunosuppression (cat flu, diarrhea, neoplasia). \u2022 Gingivitis/stomatitis.\n\n\u2022 FIV is morphologically and biochemically similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), however it is antigenically distinct and the viruses are species specific.\n\nInfectious virus is found in the saliva of FIV-positive cats and transmission occurs primarily though inoculation of the virus through saliva or blood.\n\n\u2022 Bite wounds are considered a primary source of infection. \u2022 Vertical transmission either transplacentally or via infected milk occurs experimentally but is of questionable significance in natural settings. \u2022 Horizontal transmission in multiple cat households via food bowls, mutual grooming appears rare. \u2022 Sexual transmission is not thought to be a significant route of infection.\n\nThe prevalence of FIV infection varies with the population studied:\n\n\u2022 FIV infection in healthy cats in the United States and United Kingdom ranges from 2-3%, compared to rates approaching 30% in sick cats or cats with a high risk of exposure. \u2022 Male cats are three times more likely to be infected than female, especially male entire cats.\n\nFIV has a worldwide distribution in domestic cats.\n\nThe course of the disease following FIV infection is dependent on a number of host-and virus-related factors, such as the age and health status of the cat and the strain and dose of the virus.\n\nAcute infection involves rapid replication of virus in lymphoid organs and salivary glands.\n\nAlthough CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T lymphocytes may be infected by FIV, FIV selectively destroys CD4+ cells.\n\n\u2022 The ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ becomes \"inverted\" in cats with FIV because of the relative lack of CD4+ cells. \u2022 The lack of CD4+ leads to the immunosuppression associated with many of the clinical signs of FIV infection.\n\nMany cats remain completely asymptomatic for years, despite severe lack of CD4+ lymphocytes.\n\nClinical signs are very variable from cat to cat, and may be a direct effect of the virus or secondary to immunosuppression.\n\nThe infection can be divided into stages: acute, asymptomatic carrier, persistent generalized lymph-adenopathy, AIDS-related complex (ARC), and AIDS.\n\nHowever it may be difficult to distinguish these stages clinically.\n\n\u2022 The acute phase begins about 4 weeks following infection and may persist for up to 4 months.\n\n-Mild lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, fever, malaise and diarrhea may occur. -These signs may be mild and go completely unnoticed by the owner. -These cats will usually test seronegative for the virus. \u2022 The asymptomatic carrier phase may last for months to years.\n\n-Despite being asymptomatic, significant immune aberrations may be present \u2022 Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy lasts for less than 2-4 months.\n\n-Poor hair coat, fever and leukopenia may be noted. \n\nImmunosuppression leads to opportunistic infections with bacterial, fungal or protozoal agents. \u2022 Little good statistical evidence is available to show that there is a higher incidence of many of these diseases in FIV-infected cats. \u2022 Some studies indicate that these diseases may be more severe in the FIV-infected cat.\n\nCertain disease processes have been directly associated with the terminal clinical phase of the disease.\n\n\u2022 Chronic ulceroproliferative stomatitis is common, and may be associated with concurrent calicivirus infection. \u2022 Ocular disease including uveitis, glaucoma, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the posterior chamber (pars planitis), focal retinal chorioretinitis and retinal hemorrhages have been reported. \u2022 Neoplasia including lymphoma (often extra-nodal), leukemia, and several others have been associated with the terminal stage of the disease. However, the exact role of FIV in the neoplastic process is unclear. \u2022 Central and peripheral nervous system disease has been associated with FIV infections. These signs may be transient. Clinical signs include behavior changes, seizures, paresis and anisocoria. Concomitant infections (cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis or FIP) may contribute to neurologic signs. \u2022 Renal disease and failure may have an association with the FIV virus. Since many older cats suffer from chronic renal failure, the exact association between the virus and renal failure has yet to be determined.\n\n\u2022 In practice, diagnostic kits are available to detect antibody to either p24 core protein or gp41 envelope protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or rapid immunomigration (RIM).\n\n\u2022 Vaccinated cats will test positive with all current testing methods. \u2022 In unvaccinated cats, FIV antibodies are associated with lifelong viral infection. A positive test implies a persistently infected cat. \u2022 Passive transfer of antibody via milk will result in a positive test in kittens nursed by an infected queen. Such kittens should not be tested until at least 6 months of age. \u2022 False-positive results occur with ELISA or RIM tests, but at a low frequency. A positive test should be confirmed using a western blot if it will influence management of the cat.\n\nInterpretation of a negative antibody result:\n\n\u2022 The cat is not infected with FIV. \u2022 The cat is infected but no antibodies are present.\n\n-This occurs in early stages of infection, usually 2-4 weeks after infection.\n\n-Small numbers of cats (up to 10-20%) have delayed seroconversion or may never seroconvert. -The cat is in the terminal stages of the disease, when antibody production declines.\n\n\u2022 Since cats can live for years in the \"asymptomatic\" stage of the disease, the clinician should try to decide if the virus is a cause, contributing factor, or just incidental to the cat's problem.\n\nImmunoflourescent antibody or western blot techniques may be used to confirm the presence of FIV antibody, particularly in ELISA-positive cats from low-risk populations, or if initial test results were equivocal.\n\nNon-specific findings on routine hematology and biochemistry include:\n\n\u2022 Various cytopenias including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and anemia. \u2022 Mild non-regenerative anemia. \u2022 A polyclonal hyperglobulinemia.\n\nFeline leukemia virus infection (FeLV) may be clinically very similar to FIV infection, as many signs are associated with the immunosuppression which is common to both conditions. \u2022 Most cats that are tested for FeLV probably should be tested for FIV.\n\nmay lead to signs of wasting, neurologic signs, renal failure and ocular disease. The \"dry\" form of FIP is extremely difficult to diagnose without histologic examination of tissue.\n\nToxoplasmosis causes neurologic and ocular signs as well as wasting. FIV and toxoplasmosis may also occur concurrently.\n\nThe FIV status of the cat should not necessarily preclude treatment for other diseases.\n\nNo specific therapy has proven effective against the virus in the long term, but reverse transcriptase inhibitors and immunomodulating drugs may provide some benefit in rescuing severely ill cats in the shortterm. Although some drugs can reduce viral load (AZT and PMEA), there are no studies showing a proven clinical benefit long term, or resolution of infection, and long-term use is hindered by side effects.\n\n\u2022 Zidovudine (3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine, AZT) (5-15 mg/kg PO or 5 mg/kg subcutaneously q 12 hours) has been shown to improve clinical signs, but does not eliminate the virus.\n\n-Increased numbers of CD4+ cells and improvement in CD4+:CD8+ ratios have occurred in naturally infected FIV cats. -Remission in stomatitis has been reported.\n\n-The virus may become resistant to AZT -Anemia and hepatotoxicity are potential side effects.\n\n\u2022 Evening primrose oil (550 mg PO q 24 hours).\n\n\u2022 Low-dose oral human recombinant alpha interferon (30 IU/cat PO q 24 hours, 7 days on, 7 days off). \u2022 Acemannan, Propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcal protein A have been suggested as immunomodulating agents in FIV infection.\n\nAggressive supportive care and management of secondary infections are essential in FIV-positive cats. All infections should be fully assessed in terms of extent and appropriate treatment administered, ideally based on culture and sensitivity results. Response to treatment may be slower in FIV-infected cats, and so sufficient duration of antibiotic must be administered.\n\nAppropriate preventative medicine is important in immunosuppressed cats.\n\n\u2022 Inactivated vaccines should be used against respiratory or enteric pathogens. \u2022 However the ability of an FIV-infected cat to produce an adequate immune response to a vaccine is unknown.\n\nIn the acute or asymptomatic phases of the disease, it is not possible to predict the short-or long-term prognosis.\n\nMany cats appear to live for years with no or minimal problems.\n\nIn the terminal clinical phase, the prognosis is poor to grave with average life expectancy of less than 1 year.\n\nOne vaccine has been approved for the prevention of FIV. There are still questions on its efficacy and the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) has yet to recommend its use.\n\n\u2022 FIV-positive cats should be neutered to reduce the tendency to fight. \u2022 Confinement of FIV-positive cats to indoors will reduce the spread of the virus, and will also reduce the exposure of the affected cat to secondary infectious diseases. \u2022 In single-cat households or multiple-cat households where all cats are seronegative for the virus, the animals are at negligible risk if they are kept as indoor cats. \u2022 FIV is readily killed by disinfectants and survives only a few hours in the environment, so risk of fomite transmission is low.\n\nThe FIV status of new cats should be determined prior to introduction to a group. Ideally these cats should be rechecked in 4-6 weeks because of the latency period between exposure and production of antibody.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, muscle wasting and weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Weakness, lethargy.\n\n\u2022 Clinical signs associated with the neoplastic lesion.\n\nCancer cachexia is probably the most common paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\nIt is associated with a variety of malignancies.\n\nAlthough many cats with neoplasia are cachexic, little information is available on the metabolic derangements present. Care must be taken extrapolating data from the dog and man, given the differing nutritional requirements of these species.\n\nWeight loss occurs in patients with neoplasia because: \u2022 Nutrient intake is reduced.\n\n-This is related to tumor size and location. For example, intraoral masses cause dysphagia, and infiltrative intestinal neoplasia may reduce nutrient assimilation. -Decreased appetite may be a consequence of therapy. \u2022 Metabolic and hormonal changes secondary to neoplasia lead to inefficient energy utilization.\n\nInappetence and weight loss are common clinical findings in many cats with varying malignancies.\n\nWeight loss is frequently associated with muscle wasting, and consequent lethargy and weakness.\n\nPoor hair coat, delayed wound healing and impaired immune function are associated with cachexia.\n\nOther clinical signs will vary with the nature and location of the neoplasia.\n\nA thorough clinical examination, including palpation of all lymph nodes, may provide an indication of the site of the lesion and direct further investigation.\n\nPrincipal diagnostic efforts are aimed at establishing the nature and extent of the neoplastic lesion. The exact diagnostic investigation will depend on the location and type of lesion being investigated but may include:\n\n\u2022 Diagnostic imaging (radiography, ultrasound examinations and computed tomography) of the thorax and abdomen.\n\n-Evaluation of pulmonary neoplasia should include two lateral and ventrodorsal radiographic views. \u2022 Cytological or histopathological evaluation of tissue is required to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nCats with neoplastic lesions should be monitored closely for evidence of malnutrition. A detailed dietary history and physical examination are important for monitoring. Regularly assess body weight and use a body condition scoring system.\n\nHematological and biochemical parameters are relatively insensitive markers of nutritional status, but may provide additional information. However these markers may be affected by the neoplasia itself.\n\n\u2022 Creatine kinase concentrations may increase rapidly in response to anorexia. \u2022 Protein malnutrition may lead to hypoalbuminemia. \u2022 Malnutrition may also cause anemia and lymphopenia.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include most causes of inappetence and weight loss.\n\nOther differentials to be considered depend on the site, location and nature of the tumor.\n\nTreatment specific to the neoplastic lesion will depend on the nature, extent and location of the tumor, but may include excisional surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.\n\nDietary recommendations postulated to prevent or ameliorate cancer cachexia include: \u2022 Palatable, highly digestible, complete and balanced diets. \u2022 Tumor cells have an obligate requirement for glucose and are unable to utilize significant amounts of lipid for energy. Therefore, energy-dense diets, which are relatively high in fat and restricted in carbohydrate, may theoretically have beneficial effects.\n\nAppropriate treatment of associated symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea or vomiting.\n\nPharmacological appetite stimulation may be considered but objective evidence of their efficacy is not available.\n\nIn cats which are unable or unwilling to eat, enteral or parenteral feeding may be considered.\n\n\u2022 Enteral nutrition should be used wherever possible, as this prevents intestinal mucosal atrophy -Nasoesophageal, esophageal, gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes may be used -Esophagostomy and gastrostomy tubes are preferable in cats requiring more long-term nutrition. \u2022 Parenteral feeding is more technically complex and expensive, and should only be used when feeding via the gastrointestinal tract is impossible.\n\nThe prognosis for each individual case will be dependent on the nature of the neoplasm and the response to therapy.\n\nCachexia and hypoalbuminemia tend to be poor prognostic indicators.\n\nCats with neoplastic lesions should be monitored closely for evidence of malnutrition.\n\n\u2022 Fluctuating pyrexia and associated inappetence. \u2022 Weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Clinical signs associated with the etiology of the fever.\n\nSee main references on page 364 for details (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nThe thermoregulatory center is located in the preoptic region of the anterior hypothalamus.\n\nHyperthermia describes a core body temperature above that considered normal in the cat. In fever, the set point of the thermoregulatory center is increased.\n\nFever may be caused by exogenous pyrogens such as infectious agents, immune complexes and tissue inflammation or necrosis.\n\n\u2022 Exogenous pyrogens principally act by causing the host to release endogenous pyrogens. \u2022 Endogenous pyrogens act on the thermoregulatory center, alter the set point and induce a febrile response.\n\nWeight loss frequently occurs in cats with prolonged fever because:\n\n\u2022 Febrile cats are frequently inappetent.\n\n\u2022 A febrile cat is in a hypermetabolic state.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss may be associated with the fever per se, or more often with the disease causing the fever.\n\nThe differential diagnosis list for causes of fever is extensive but may be broadly categorized:\n\n\u2022 Localized infection.\n\n-Including urinary tract infection, pyometra, pyothorax, peritonitis, abscess, bronchopneumonia, endocarditis, suppurative cholangitis/ cholangiohepatitis, dental disease, retrobulbar or pulmonary abscess and osteomyelitis. \u2022 Systemic infection.\n\n-Including FeLV, FIV, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline panleukopenia, respiratory tract virus infection, bacteremias, toxoplasmosis, mycobacterial infection and systemic mycoses. \u2022 Immune-mediated disorders.\n\n-Including primary immunodeficiencies, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, chronic progressive polyarthritis, immunemediated hemolytic anemia and immune-mediated thrombocytpenia. \u2022 Neoplasia.\n\n-Including lympho-and myeloproliferative diseases and large neoplastic lesions with central necrosis. \u2022 Miscellaneous conditions.\n\n-Including drug reactions.\n\nPrincipal clinical signs will be fever, weight loss and inappetence.\n\nFever may be sustained or fluctuating.\n\nOther clinical signs will vary with the nature of the disease causing the fever.\n\nA thorough history and clinical examination is vital to identify any localizing signs that would narrow the differential diagnosis list.\n\nMonitoring the cat's temperature three or four times daily over a period of 48-72 hours confirms the presence and nature of the fever.\n\nRoutine hematology often reveals a neutrophilia with or without a regenerative left shift.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally a degenerative left shift occurs when the bone marrow is unable to make an adequate response, and neutropenia develops in the face of a left shift. This has a poor prognosis.\n\nIn the absence of localizing signs a series of initial screening tests are carried out to identify the septic focus:\n\n\u2022 Routine hematology and biochemistry.\n\n\u2022 Routine urinalysis including bacterial culture and sensitivity. \u2022 Thoracic and abdominal radiographs. \u2022 Fecal analysis and culture for enteric pathogens.\n\nFurther diagnostic investigation may be required depending on the cause of the fever, this may include: \u2022 Blood culture. \u2022 Synovial fluid aspirates. \u2022 Echocardiography. \u2022 Bone marrow aspirates.\n\n\u2022 Immunological tests such as Coomb's, antiplatelet antibody and antinuclear antibody tests. \u2022 Serum protein electrophoresis. \u2022 Serology.\n\nIf a bacterial cause is suspected, strenuous attempts should be made to obtain a sample of infected material for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing prior to administering antibiotics.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include most causes of inappetence and weight loss.\n\nOther differentials to be considered depend on the site, location and nature of the disease causing fever.\n\nEffective treatment is based on accurate assessment of the cause of the fever, followed by appropriate management.\n\nUse of antibiotics, corticosteroids and NSAIDs prior to diagnosis should be avoided where possible, as it will mask the clinical signs and interfere with diagnostic testing.\n\nIf a septic focus is identified, treatment involves drainage where appropriate (e.g. placement of thoracic drains in pyothorax) and use of antibiotic therapy based on the results of culture and sensitivity testing.\n\nMild fever is unlikely to be fatal and may be beneficial in inhibiting viral and bacterial replication and increasing leukocyte function.\n\nSymptomatic therapy for fever includes: \u2022 Oxygen. \u2022 Crystalloid fluid therapy. \u2022 Antipyretic drugs (NSAIDs) -these act directly on the thermoregulatory center and should be tried before surface cooling, unless the fever is lifethreatening, when they may be instituted together. \u2022 Surface cooling. Core temperature will continue to decrease after surface cooling has ceased, so to avoid large oscillations in temperature, aggressive cooling should stop just prior to reaching the desired temperature.\n\n-With cool, not cold, water (avoid inducing shivering). -Fans. -Ice packs over large blood vessels.\n\nThe prognosis for each individual case will be dependent on the etiology of the fever and the response to therapy. \n\nHyperthyroidism is a disease of older cats, with only 5% being under 10 years of age at first diagnosis.\n\nThe majority of cats with hyperthyroidism present with weight loss and polyphagia.\n\nIn approximately 5% of cases, apathetic or masked hyperthyroidism occurs. \u2022 Weight loss is accompanied by a decreased appetite.\n\n\u2022 Cats tend to be depressed. \u2022 Muscle weakness may be evident as ventroflexion of the neck. \u2022 Cats with apathetic hyperthyroidism may show signs of concurrent disease including congestive cardiac failure, renal failure or neoplasia.\n\nOther clinical signs are those typical for hyperthyroidism. \u2022 Unilateral or bilateral palpably enlarged thyroid (goiter). \u2022 Polyuria and polydipsia. \u2022 Vomiting and diarrhea (bulky feces). \u2022 Tachycardia, gallop rhythm, murmur and arrhythmia may be noted. \u2022 Poor coat condition with decreased grooming.\n\nAlthough clinical signs of inappetence and depression are atypical for hyperthyroidism, the presence of a thyroid goiter or tachycardia should alert the clinician to the possibility of hyperthyroidism.\n\nAs apathetic hyperthyroidism typically occurs in hyperthyroid cats with significant concurrent disease, a thorough investigation is required to establish the presence of such disease.\n\nRoutine hematology may reveal a mild erythrocytosis.\n\nSerum biochemistry frequently shows elevations of hepatic enzymes (alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase).\n\nA definitive diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made on the basis of high serum basal total thyroxine (T 4 ) concentrations.\n\nNormal serum thyroid hormone concentrations are occasionally found in hyperthyroid cats due to: \u2022 Day-to-day fluctuation in hormone levels.\n\n\u2022 Early or mild hyperthyroidism.\n\n\u2022 The presence of concurrent non-thyroidal disease that suppresses serum thyroid levels.\n\nGiven that concurrent disease is common in cats with apathetic hyperthyroidism, suspect hyperthyroidism despite normal Total T 4 concentrations if the cat is older than 8 years and has signs consistent with hyperthyroidism. e.g. tachycardia or thyroid goitre.\n\n\u2022 Repeat basal total T 4 measurement in 1-2 weeks.\n\n\u2022 Identify and treat concurrent disease, then repeat basal total T 4 measurement. \u2022 Measure basal free T 4 concentrations, although euthyriod cats with non-thyroidal illness may have an elevated concentration. \u2022 Dynamic thyroid testing may also be used:\n\n-Triiodothyronine (T 3 ) suppression test.\n\n-Thyrotropin (TRH) stimulation test, although the usefulness of this test in cats with non-thyroidal illness to distinguish those with and without hyperthyroidism has recently been questioned. \u2022 Radionucleotide uptake and imaging.\n\nConcurrent disease may be present and should be investigated, in particular: \u2022 Evidence of concurrent renal failure with increased creatinine and urea concentration may also be present. Urine specific gravity will also provide further information regarding renal function. \u2022 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxic cardiac disease) is frequently seen on echocardiography. This may be reversible with resolution of the hyperthyroid state but may progress to congestive cardiac failure.\n\nThese include most other causes of inappetence and weight loss.\n\nAs tachycardia (with or without cardiac failure) is often present, cardiac disease should be placed high on the differential diagnosis list.\n\nFor cats with polydipsia and polyuria in addition to inappetence and weight loss, the main differential diagnoses would include chronic renal failure and diabetes mellitus.\n\nHyperthyroid cats may be treated by surgical thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ( 131 I), which are curative, or alternatively the condition may be controlled using antithyroid therapy.\n\nThe ideal form of treatment for each case will depend on a number of factors:\n\n\u2022 Age of the cat.\n\n\u2022 Presence of concurrent disease, particularly chronic renal failure or cardiovascular disease. \u2022 Availability of appropriate nuclear medicine facilities. \u2022 Owner's wishes, including ability to medicate cat and cost.\n\nCats with apathetic hyperthyroidism frequently have concurrent disease, and it is essential that this is thoroughly investigated and considered prior to embarking on therapy.\n\n\u2022 Cardiac disease may preclude safe anesthesia and surgical thyroidectomy. \u2022 Glomerular filtration rate declines with resolution of the hyperthyroid state. Therefore, any cat suspected of having underlying renal disease (azotemia, creatinine and urea concentrations in the upper part of the reference range, or lack of urine-concentrating ability) should be treated with antithyroid medication until it can be determined if induction of euthyroidism would have detrimental effects.\n\nMedical therapy for hyperthyroidism is used in the short term to stabilize a hyperthyroid cat prior to surgical thyroidectomy, as trial therapy assesses the effect on renal function prior to curative treatment, or for long-term management if surgery or radioiodine therapy are not suitable.\n\n\u2022 Medical management merely blocks thyroid hormone synthesis and so requires continuous life-long treatment. \u2022 Carbimazole (5 mg PO q 8 hours for 2-3 weeks, then 5 mg PO q 12 hours to maintain euthy-roidism) and methimazole (10-15 mg/day PO divided q 8-12 hours for 2-3 weeks, then 7.5-10 mg/day PO divided q 12 hours to maintain euthyroidism) are the drugs of choice for both shortand long-term medical management of hyperthyroidism. Transdermally absorbed methimazole may be obtained from a compounding pharmacist, and may be useful if the owners are unable to give oral medication.\n\n-Exact dosage should be adjusted on the basis of basal total T 4 concentrations. -Failure of efficacy is usually due to poor compliance. -Adverse effects appear to be less common with carbimazole than methimazole and usually occur in the first 3 months of therapy. -Transient vomiting, anorexia and lethargy have been reported, and usually resolve without withdrawal of the drug. -Serious hematological adverse effects may occur, and so routine monitoring is required. -Hepatopathy and self-induced facial excoriation may rarely occur. \u2022 Other medical therapies may be considered including atenolol (to reduce the cardiac effects of hyperthyroidism), stable iodine (preoperatively to reduce gland vascularity) and ipodate.\n\n\u2022 Medical stabilization, ideally for 3 weeks preoperatively significantly reduces the anesthetic and surgical complications. \u2022 The most common complication is post-operative hypoparathyroidism, although Horner's syndrome and laryngeal paralysis may also occur.\n\n\u2022 This is the treatment of choice for cats with hyperthyroidism induced by thyroid carcinoma. \u2022 Complications include the induction of permanent hypothyroidism and incomplete ablation requiring an additional treatment. \u2022 The principal disadvantage is a period of isolation is required to comply with local radiation safety regulations. This makes treatment of intercurrent disease difficult or impossible during this time.\n\n\u2022 Inappetence and weight loss. \u2022 Lethargy.\n\n\u2022 Jaundice. \u2022 Hepatomegaly and/or ascites.\n\nSee main references on page 427 for details (The Yellow Cat or Cat With Elevated Liver Enzymes).\n\nThe most consistent clinical signs in these cases are weight loss, variable anorexia, lethargy and depression.\n\nFever may occur, particularly in the acute or suppurative form of the disease.\n\nVomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain may also occur.\n\nClinical signs more specific to hepatic disease such as hepatomegaly and jaundice are common, particularly in the early stages of the condition.\n\nOccasionally polyphagia or a normal appetite may be seen, particularly associated with lymphocytic cholangiohepatits.\n\nAscites, hepatic encephalopathy and a generalized lymphadenopathy are uncommon clinical signs.\n\nIn some cats, cholangiohepatitis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis.\n\nRoutine serum biochemistry findings include mild to severe elevations in hepatic enzymes (especially alanine amino transferase (ALT)). Hyperbilirubinemia and elevated bile acids are often also present.\n\nElevated serum globulin concentrations are common in the chronic stage of the disease.\n\nA neutrophilia, often with left shift may be present in acute cases on routine hematology. More chronic cases often have a lymphocytosis.\n\nIf there is significant biliary stasis, intestinal absorption of vitamin K may be impaired leading to impaired secondary hemostasis and a coagulopathy.\n\nAbdominal radiography may be normal or reveal: \u2022 Hepatomegaly.\n\n\u2022 Loss of abdominal contrast due to the presence of ascites, or if more localized, due to pancreatitis. \u2022 Occasionally, choleliths may be noted.\n\nHepatic parenchymal changes on abdominal ultrasound are not specific to cholangiohepatitis, varying from normal parenchymal architecture, to diffuse increases (particularly if cirrhosis is present), or decreases (especially in acute or suppurative inflammatory disease) in echogenicity. Ultrasonography is helpful to demonstrate: \u2022 Abnormalities of the biliary tract including biliary stasis or sludging, cholecystitis, biliary tract distention and obstruction. \u2022 Concurrent pancreatic or intestinal disease.\n\nA definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination of hepatic tissue. Although as a diffuse disease, cholangiohepatitis should be amenable to diagnosis by percutaneous fine-needle aspiration techniques, blood contamination and the inability to assess hepatic architecture make definitive diagnosis of inflammatory disease difficult. Tissue core biopsy or surgical wedge biopsy yield improved diagnostic accuracy. \u2022 Surgical exploration and wedge biopsy are required if there is evidence of extra-hepatic biliary stasis, severe biliary sludging or clinically significant choleliths. \u2022 In addition, surgical exploration permits a complete evaluation of the biliary tree and pancreas, aspiration of bile for culture (although this may be carried out percutaneously by ultrasound guidance), biopsy of pancreas, and intestine and placement of feeding tubes.\n\nDifferential diagnoses for inappetence and weight loss associated with suspicion of hepatic pathology includes hepatic lipidosis, hepatic neoplasia, feline infectious peritonitis affecting the liver and hyperthyroidism.\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis is an important differential diagnosis for cholangiohepatitis, as both may present with hyperglobulinemia or ascites.\n\nAcute or suppurative cholangiohepatitis is treated primarily with antibiotics, ideally based on the results of culture and sensitivity testing.\n\n\u2022 Ampicillin (10-40 mg/kg PO q 8 hours), amoxycillin (11-22 mg/kg PO q 8-12 hours), amoxycillin clavulanate (12.5-25 mg/kg PO q 12 hours), or cephalexin (10-30 mg/kg PO q 8-12 hours) are good empirical choices. \u2022 Metronidazole in combination with the above antibiotics, provides broader anaerobic cover. Use at a lower dose (7.5-10 mg/kg PO q 12 hours) because of hepatotoxicity and the increased potential for neurological signs in animals with pre-existing hepatic disease. In addition it may have immunomodulating properties.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy is used if there is a lymphocytic component to the pathology, and in more chronic cases, although definitive evidence of efficacy is lacking.\n\n\u2022 Prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg q 12-24 hours), gradually tapering the dose. \u2022 Other immunosuppressive agents may be considered in non-responsive cases.\n\nFluid therapy and nutritional support will be required if anorexia is present.\n\nSupportive and adjunctive therapy is often recommended on an empirical basis.\n\n\u2022 Ursodeoxycholic acid (10-15 mg/kg PO q 24 hours) is a hydrophilic bile acid which has cytoprotective properties. \u2022 Parenteral vitamin K1 (0.5 mg/kg SC q 12 hours for 3 days) may be provided for those cases showing evidence of a coagulopathy. \u2022 S-adenosylmethionine (18 mg/kg PO q 24 hours) and vitamin E have antioxidant properties and may be useful supplements.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. \u2022 Variable appetite.\n\nWith Weight Loss and a Good appetite).\n\nClinical signs vary with the type and severity of the inflammation, and with the anatomical extent of the disease, although the correlation is poor.\n\nCharacteristically, any combination of weight loss, vomiting or diarrhea may be seen.\n\nVomiting is particularly evident if the pathology involves the stomach or proximal small intestine and may occur every few days to weeks. Vomiting is usually unrelated to feeding, and is more frequently composed of fluid rather than food.\n\nDiarrhea may be soft and semi-formed to watery in consistency, with or without steatorrhea. Occasionally large bowel diarrhea with tenesmus, mucus and hematochezia may be present.\n\nWeight loss initially results from malabsorption and later from inappetence. In some cases, progressive weight loss is the only clinical sign.\n\nInitially, polyphagia or a normal appetite may be seen, but this frequently progresses to inappetence as the disease increases in severity.\n\nIntestinal thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy or abdominal pain may be revealed by abdominal palpation.\n\nOccasionally, severe small intestinal disease leading to protein leakage into the gut lumen (protein-losing enteropathy) leads to extreme weight loss and hypoproteinemia. Although usually polyphagic, if the condition is associated with severe inflammatory or malignant disease, anorexia may occur. Vomiting and diarrhea may rarely be accompanied by ascites and peripheral edema.\n\n\u2022 Intestinal infiltration with inflammatory cells is non-specific. \n\nThe principal differential diagnoses are those conditions causing inappetence and weight loss in conjunction with gastrointestinal signs, namely other causes of enteropathy, chronic pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis, gastrointestinal neoplasia and apathetic hyperthyroidism.\n\nAs the etiology of the immune response in inflammatory bowel disease is unknown, the principal form of treatment involves immunosuppressive therapy in combination with dietary management.\n\nA therapeutic dietary trial may be undertaken as part of the diagnostic evaluation (to eliminate dietary sensitivity), as the initial stage of treatment, or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy, depending on the severity of the clinical signs.\n\n\u2022 A nutritionally balanced, highly digestible diet should be used. \u2022 Usually a single protein, single carbohydrate source diet is used (hypoallergenic), preferably one to which the cat has not previously been exposed. \u2022 Use of diets with hydrolized protein (e.g. Hill's z/d or Royal Canin HA) may be efficacious in some cats. Hydrolization reduces the molecular weight of dietary proteins to < 10 000 so they are not detected by the immune system. \u2022 A high-fiber diet has proven beneficial in cases with large intestinal involvement. \u2022 Minimum duration of the trial should be 3 weeks, but may be longer. If an improvement is seen, the cat should then be challenged with the original diet to confirm sensitivity.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy is required in the majority of cases:\n\n\u2022 Prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg PO q 12-24 hours) is used at higher initial doses, which are gradually reduced to the lowest maintenance dose. \u2022 Metronidazole (7.5-15 mg/kg PO q 12 hours) is used either as sole therapy in mild cases, or in addition to prednisolone for those cats in which the response to prednisolone is inadequate. Metronidazole has activity against anaerobic bacteria, protozoa and may be antiinflammatory and influence cell-mediated immunity. \u2022 Other more potent immunosuppressive therapy may be required in some cases.\n\n\u2022 Younger cats, often less than 6 years of age, clinical signs variable. \u2022 Inappetence, weight loss and lethargy. \u2022 \u00b1 Neoplasia (lymphoma) -lymph node enlargement, organomegaly, solid masses. \u2022 \u00b1 Anemia -pica, lethargy, pale mucous membranes, tachycardia. \n\nThere are no \"classical signs\" in a FeLV infection. A variety of clinical signs may be noted dependent on the body system affected. No one clinical sign is found in all cats with persistent viral infection.\n\nThe most consistent clinical signs are weight loss, variable anorexia, lethargy and depression.\n\nThis usually resolves in several days to weeks.\n\nPale mucous membranes, weakness and anorexia are seen if the virus causes anemia or bone marrow suppression. Hematological disease may be a primary viral effect on the bone marrow or secondary (e.g. neoplastic infiltration, hemobartonellosis)\n\nRespiratory distress occurs if the virus leads to development of an anterior mediastinal lymphoma with or without pleural effusion.\n\nSigns of vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss may be evident if there is gastro-intestinal infiltration with malignant lymphocytes.\n\nSigns of liver or renal failure occur if these organs are involved in lymphoma.\n\nOcular signs are relatively common, primarily uveitis, although neuro-ophthalmic signs, such as anisocoria may occur.\n\nVarious neurological signs may also be noted including ataxia and behavioral changes.\n\nImmunosuppression may cause recurrent bacterial infections, especially subcutaneous abscesses, which recur or fail to respond to appropriate therapy.\n\nMany of the clinical signs relate to the presence of concurrent disease such as toxoplasmosis or hemobartonellosis.\n\nWhen clinical disease warrants evaluation for FeLV, testing should be performed.\n\n\u2022 However a positive test does not prove that the disease process is caused by the virus.\n\nDiagnosis is usually based on the detection of viral antigen (usually the p27 core protein) by immunoassay. Other diagnostic tests should be carried out as required to investigate the presenting signs.\n\nThe differential diagnoses will vary depending on the clinical manifestation(s) of the FeLV-related disease.\n\nBecause the clinical signs in a cat having disease caused by this virus are so extremely diverse, FeLVassociated disease must be considered in any chronically ill cat.\n\nFIV infection is a principal differential diagnosis, as this may also be a cause of immunosuppression and neoplasia.\n\nThe FeLV status of the cat should not necessarily preclude treatment for other diseases.\n\nChemotherapy has been used to treat a variety of lymphomas caused by the FeLV virus. Certain forms (mediastinal) seem to be more chemoresponsive than others (abdominal visceral).\n\nBlood transfusions can give temporary help for the anemic patient.\n\nAggressive supportive care and management of secondary infections are essential in FeLV-positive cats. All infections should be fully assessed in terms of extent, and appropriate treatment administered, ideally based on culture and sensitivity results. Response to treatment may be slower in FeLV-infected cats, and so sufficient duration of antibiotic must be administered.\n\nA variety of immunomodulator and antiviral therapies have been tried. As with FIV, the efficacy of these agents to clear the virus completely is questionable, although there is evidence that they may decrease total viral load. \n\nMost common in pure-bred cats from multi-cat households.\n\nFIP is primarily seen in cats from 3 months to 3 years of age, although a second peak in incidence may occur in geriatric cats.\n\nThe wet form tends to progress more rapidly, and is characterized by combinations of abdominal, pleural or pericardial effusions. \u2022 Non-painful abdominal enlargement is the main clinical sign if ascites is present. Vomiting and diarrhea may occur as the disease advances. \u2022 Dyspnea is characteristic of pleural effusions.\n\nThe dry form leads to clinical signs associated with pyogranulomatous perivascular disease in multiple organs and clinical signs vary with the affected body system. \u2022 This form of the disease tends to be more chronic (months) and progressive. \u2022 Neurological (seizures, nystagmus, behavioral changes, peripheral neuropathies) and ocular (posterior and anterior uveitis) involvement is common. \u2022 The liver, kidney and abdominal lymph nodes may also be involved.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is difficult, if not impossible, without histopathological examination of affected tissues.\n\n\u2022 Histologic evaluation revealing typical pyogranulomatous is diagnostic.\n\nBy combining clinical signs with other testing, a high suspicion of FIP may be obtained.\n\nIn the wet form, evaluation of the fluid is helpful.\n\n\u2022 Fluid is typically yellow, viscous, and may have fibrin clots. \u2022 Fluid is high in protein (> 35g/L or 3.5 g/dl and usually 50-120g/L or 5-12 g/dl) with moderate numbers of non-degenerate neutrophils and macrophages, although lower than usual for an exudate. \u2022 If the albumin:globulin ratio of the fluid is > 0.81, FIP is an extremely unlikely diagnosis.\n\nAspiration of affected organs (liver, lymph nodes, kidney) will often reveal a pyogranulomatous response.\n\nIncreased serum globulin concentration (polyclonal gammopathy) is present in the majority of cats with FIP.\n\n\u2022 Other biochemical findings will vary, dependent on the organ system involved.\n\nComplete blood count usually often reveals a normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia, a neutrophilic leukocytosis and lymphopenia.\n\n\"FIP titers\" reported by laboratories are either coronavirus titers or titers to the 7B protein in coronavirus. Neither are specific for the mutated FIP-coronavirus virus. Although claimed that 7B protein was specific for FIP strains, subsequent studies have shown that it is not present in some FIP strains, and that non-FIP coronavirus may have an active 7B component. Currently there is no serological test that is specific for FIP-coronavirus.\n\nFIV, FeLV and toxoplasmosis are the three most common differentials for the non-effusive form of FIP. All three can lead to fever, inappetence and weight loss. Toxoplasmosis and FeLV can both present with ocular and neurological signs.\n\nAbdominal neoplasia, liver disease (especially cholangiohepatitis), pancreatitis, peritonitis and diseases causing hypoproteinemia can lead to abdominal effusion. Fluid analysis and cytology of the fluid can frequently distinguish between these diseases.\n\nHeart failure, diaphragmatic hernias, neoplasia and chylothorax may all present signs similar to effusive FIP in the thorax. Fluid analysis and thoracic radiographs will help in differentiating the cause of fluid accumulation.\n\nClinical FIP is invariably fatal, and no effective treatment has been found in cats.\n\nAnti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy may increase life span by controlling the complement mediated vasculitis, but will not cure the condition.\n\n\u2022 Prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg PO daily).\n\n\u2022 Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil may be used for more potent immunosuppression, but cytotoxic agents should be avoided in debilitated cats.\n\n-Broad-spectrum antibiotic cover should be given if immunosuppressive drugs are used to prevent secondary infections. -Therapy should be re-evaluated regularly, including monitoring for myelosuppression.\n\nOther immunomodulating drugs (recombinant human interferon-\u03b1) and anti-viral agents have been promising in vitro but have limited efficacy in in vivo studies.\n\nSupportive care should be provided if the cat is not euthanized.\n\n\u2022 Inappetence associated with dysphagia.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Ptyalism, halitosis and oral pain.\n\n\u2022 Oral inflammatory, ulcerative and proliferative lesions.\n\nSee main references on page 585 for details (The Cat With Salivation).\n\nPure-bred cats may be predisposed.\n\n\u2022 Most cases are due to lymphoplasmacytic gingivitis/stomatitis.\n\nThe condition may be waxing and waning in nature but in some cases is progressive.\n\nOral examination reveals erythema, swelling, ulceration and proliferative lesions (giving a cobblestone appearance) of varying severity. The tissue is friable and therefore tends to bleed easily.\n\n\u2022 These lesions may involve the gingiva, glossopalatine arches (fauces), pharynx, buccal mucosa and less commonly the tongue, hard palate and lips. \u2022 Many cats have significant dental disease but it is not clear whether the inflammation precedes, contributes to, or results from this.\n\nA poor hair coat may be noted due to decreased grooming. It is usually accompanied by varying degrees of dental disease.\n\nA particular form of oral inflammatory disease is feline juvenile hyperplastic gingivitis.\n\n\u2022 This condition affects young cats at the time of eruption of adult teeth. Abyssinian and Persian cats may be predisposed. \u2022 There is a tendency for spontaneous remission with maturity. \u2022 Lesions consist of a very proliferative, hyperemic gingivitis.\n\nThe identification of this condition is usually obvious on oral examination. \u2022 A complete history and clinical examination is essential to ensure evidence of concurrent disease or additional lesions are not overlooked.\n\nThe investigation should aim to identify any possible predisposing causes of oral inflammation.\n\n\u2022 Perform routine hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis to assess for systemic predisposing disease.\n\n-Approximately half the cats have a polyclonal gammopathy. \u2022 Test for FeLV, FIV and respiratory tract viruses.\n\n\u2022 Perform a full oral examination under general anesthesia to assess for periodontal disease and feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, including a full mouth radiographic dental survey.\n\nBiopsy and histopathological examination of affected areas is required for definitive diagnosis of the lymphoplasmacytic nature of the lesions.\n\nOther diseases that may appear clinically similar on examination include neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcoma), eosinophilic granuloma complex and autoimmune disease (pemphigus vulgaris and systemic lupus erythematosus).\n\nFIV, FeLV and the respiratory tract viruses, particularly feline calicivirus, may be associated with oral ulceration or stomatitis.\n\nStomatitis may be found in association with severe uremia.\n\nDental disease may be associated with oral inflammatory lesions. If the oral inflammation does not resolve with treatment of the dental disease, lymphoplasmacytic gingivitis/stomatitis should be considered.\n\nInitial management involves removing or treating any underlying etiology identified.\n\nAttention should be given to the nutritional status of the cat, including other forms of feeding, if the severity of the lesions is preventing the oral intake of food.\n\n\u2022 A dietary trial of a novel protein source should also be considered to exclude hypersensitivity as a cause.\n\nPivotal to management is thorough dental management. The aim is to improve the overall oral hygiene by scaling and polishing, followed by extraction of any anatomically compromised teeth which may be acting as foci of inflammation.\n\n\u2022 Repeated dental prophylaxis may be required to maintain oral hygiene. \u2022 In a number of cases the condition resolves or can be more effectively managed after extraction of all the teeth caudal to the canines. Occasionally removal of the canines and incisors is also required.\n\nSystemic antibiotics frequently produce only a transient improvement.\n\n\u2022 Effective antibiotics include clindamycin, clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin, metro-nidazole and spiramycin (which is concentrated in saliva).\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy appears to produce the most reliable responses in chronic cases.\n\n\u2022 Prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg PO once daily) on a tapering regime to the lowest maintenance dose. \u2022 In cases failing to respond to corticosteroid therapy, alternative immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies should be considered.\n\n-Including chlorambucil, cyclosporin A, gold salts, human recombinant interferon alpha and topical application of bovine lactoferrin. There have been few studies evaluating these drugs and most have more potential side effects, requiring closer monitoring.\n\n\u2022 More common in older cats, especially neutered males. \n\nAlthough diabetes mellitus may occur in any cat, it is more frequent in older cats, especially neutered males. \u2022 In some regions Burmese cats may be predisposed.\n\nThe classic clinical signs are those of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weight loss. \u2022 These signs are frequently unnoticed by cat owners. \u2022 Therefore many cats do not present until the cat develops more severe clinical signs such as inappetence, vomiting and depression.\n\n-These clinical signs may be associated with the development of ketoacidosis.\n\nBody condition varies from obese to thin.\n\nCoat condition is often poor, with seborrhea and scales.\n\nHepatomegaly is common. If diabetes mellitus is associated with pancreatitis, abdominal discomfort may be present.\n\nA plantigrade stance may be noted due to diabetic neuropathy.\n\nIf the diabetic cat is ketoacidotic, dehydration, depression and weakness may also be present.\n\nDocumenting a persistent fasting hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 12 mmol/L, 217 mg/dl) and glucosuria in a cat with appropriate clinical signs is required to establish a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u2022 It is important to distinguish diabetes mellitus from stress hyperglycemia.\n\n-Glucosuria rarely results from stress hyperglycemia because the hyperglycemia is usually below the renal threshold or only transient, however glucosuria does not exclude this possibility. -Monitoring for glucosuria at home may aid differentiation.\n\nBlood glycosylated hemoglobin and serum fructosamine concentrations represent the average blood glucose concentrations over the preceding 4-6 weeks and 2-3 weeks respectively.\n\n\u2022 They may be helpful to distinguish diabetes mellitus from stress hyperglycemia. \u2022 They also provide further information regarding glycemic control when monitoring patients under treatment.\n\nFurther investigation is required to assess for concurrent disease or systemic complications of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u2022 Routine hematology and biochemistry, including assessment of electrolytes.\n\n-Diabetic cats frequently have mild to moderate increases in hepatic enzymes and cholesterol. -Concurrent renal failure or pre-renal azotemia may be present. \u2022 Complete urinalysis should be carried out.\n\n-The presence of ketones in the urine confirms the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Sick ketoacidotic cats require aggressive monitoring and management.\n\n-Symptomatic or asymptomatic urinary tract infections are frequently present in diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u2022 Decreased appetite and weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy.\n\n\u2022 Signs relating to cardiac diseasetachycardia, cardiac murmurs and arrhythmias. \u2022 Dyspnea if pleural effusion or pulmonary edema present.\n\nWith Abnormal Heart Sounds and/or an Enlarged Heart).\n\nInappetence and weight loss may occur, associated with cardiac disease.\n\n\u2022 The remaining clinical signs will vary with the nature of the cardiac disease, although cardiac cachexia usually only occurs in cats with cardiac disease sufficient to cause failure. \u2022 Generally it is seen in cats with chronic, severe right-sided congestive cardiac failure.\n\nLethargy and exercise intolerance are present.\n\nDyspnea due to the presence of pleural effusion or pulmonary edema may be present.\n\nRarely ascites may be present.\n\nPhysical examination may reveal poor peripheral pulses or evidence of venous congestion (jugular distention and pulses, hepatojugular reflux).\n\nCardiac auscultation may reveal tachycardia, arrhythmias or cardiac murmurs.\n\nDiagnosis is based on documenting the presence of severe cardiac disease in a cat with weight loss.\n\nEvidence of cardiac disease may be provided by thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, measurement of systemic blood pressure and echocardiography.\n\n\u2022 Thoracic radiography may show cardiomegaly, vascular congestion and possibly pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. \u2022 Echocardiographic examination is usually required to make a definitive diagnosis of the type of cardiac disease.\n\n\u2022 Chronic sneezing and snuffling. \u2022 Chronic, persistent or intermittent, mucopurulent nasal discharge. \u2022 Stertorous respiration.\n\nWith Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease).\n\nUsually there is a history of chronic upper respiratory tract disease following an acute episode of signs. \u2022 Typically there is serous to mucopurulent, unilateral or bilateral oculonasal discharge, often associated with sneezing.\n\n-Signs may be persistent or intermittent, but are usually gradually progressive. -Rarely epistaxis may be noted, but this is more frequently associated with neoplasia. \u2022 Stertorous respiration may be audible.\n\nIf chronic and severe, in rare cases, bone destruction may lead to nasal distortion.\n\nInappetence, which is often associated with inability to smell food, and weight loss may occur.\n\nSystemic signs such as depression and anorexia are often associated with intermittent exacerbation of disease.\n\nAppropriate clinical signs and a history of previous acute upper respiratory tract disease are supportive of the diagnosis, however a full investigation is required to exclude other causes of nasal discharge including neoplasia and fungal disease.\n\n\u2022 Neoplasia and fungal causes are unlikely if the clinical signs have been constant for a protracted period (1-2 years).\n\nA thorough examination of the oral cavity and pharynx should be made whilst the cat is anesthetized to exclude congenital and traumatic palate defects, dental disease, nasopharyngeal polyps and neoplasia as a cause.\n\nRadiographic evidence of bilateral fluid density in nasal passages often extending into the frontal sinuses is typical.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally bone destruction is seen on radiographs.\n\nCytology of the nasal discharge reveals neutrophils, bacteria, and the absence of neoplastic or fungal elements.\n\nRhinoscopy (anterior and posterior) will permit visual examination and flushing of the nasal cavity, and facilitate nasal biopsy.\n\n\u2022 Blind biopsy or traumatic flushing may be used to obtain biopsy material from the nasal cavity. \u2022 It is extremely difficult to definitively exclude neoplasia in these cases.\n\n-A diagnosis should not be made on cytology alone, because both neoplasia and fungal disease frequently reveal only neutrophils and bacteria on cytologic examination. -Rhinotomy and biopsy may be necessary to definitively exclude neoplasia, particularly in cases with suggestive clinical signs.\n\nRespiratory virus status may be evaluated by virus isolation from oropharyngeal and nasal swabs. \n\nAlthough signs of respiratory distress may appear acute, the disease process is often more chronic.\n\nClinical signs will vary with the quantity of fluid present. \u2022 Cats adjust to the decreased lung volume, and distress is not usually apparent until late in the disease. \u2022 Tachypnea and dyspnea are often present. \u2022 If ventilation is severely impaired, cyanosis may be noted.\n\nAuscultation usually reveals decreased breath sounds (muffled and dull) ventrally.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally fluid may accumulate in focal areas, and unilaterally rather than bilaterally. \u2022 Heart sounds may be muffled.\n\nThe thorax may be dull on percussion.\n\nWeight loss in usually present, accompanied by inappetence as the respiratory difficulty increases.\n\nClinical signs to a certain degree will depend on the underlying cause of the pleural effusion. \u2022 Possible causes of chylothorax include neoplasia, heart failure, trauma and hyperthyroidism, although in many cases the underlying etiology is not determined despite extensive investigation (termed idiopathic chylothorax).\n\nThe presence of a pleural effusion may be confirmed radiographically or ultrasonographically.\n\n\u2022 Care should be taken in handling and positioning cats with respiratory distress, and thoracocentesis may be required to stabilize the cat prior to these procedures. \u2022 Radiographic evidence of a pleural effusion includes: -Presence of pleural fissure lines.\n\n-Separation of lung borders from the thoracic wall and rounding of edges of the lung lobes. -Loss of cardiac silhouette.\n\nThoracocentesis with biochemical and cytological analysis of thoracic fluid is required for definitive diagnosis: \u2022 Chylous fluid is usually a white \"milky\" fluid.\n\n-It may be slightly pink on repeated aspirations.\n\n-If the cat has not eaten recently, the fluid may appear only slightly opaque. \u2022 Lymphocytes are usually the predominant cell type, with some non-degenerate neutrophils. \u2022 The concentration of triglycerides in the fluid exceeds that of the serum in a true chylous effusion.\n\nIt is important that, where possible, the underlying cause is investigated, as this will influence the treatment and prognosis.\n\n\u2022 Marked weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Initially polyphagia may be present but progresses to inappetence. \u2022 Polydipsia and polyuria. \u2022 Subcutaneous edema and/or ascites.\n\nThe most common causes of protein-losing nephropathy are glomerulo-nephritis and renal amyloidosis.\n\nRenal amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of fibrillar proteins arranged in a beta-pleated sheet configuration. \u2022 Reactive (secondary) systemic amyloidosis is the form of amyloidosis occurring in cats.\n\n-It is considered to be secondary to inflammatory, neoplastic and chronic infectious disease, although in many cases the predisposing disease is not found. \u2022 Severe proteinuria occurs when amyloid deposits in the glomerulus cause glomerular damage.\n\n-Most domestic cats with amyloidosis and at least 25% of Abyssinian cats with familial amyloidosis have medullary amyloid deposits, without significant glomerular deposits. -In cases of medullary amyloidosis, proteinuria may be mild or absent, although the deposits will interfere with renal concentrating ability.\n\nGlomerulonephritis is caused by antibody-antigen complexes present in the glomerulus that lead to immune-mediated glomerular damage.\n\n\u2022 Initially the glomerular injury is characterized by proteinuria, but as the condition progresses, the entire nephron may become non-functional, with decreased glomerular filtration rate and azotemia. \u2022 Glomerulonephritis may be found in association with any chronic antigenic stimulus, including infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.\n\n-In the cat, glomerulonephritis has been particularly associated with infectious diseases including FeLV, FIV and FIP, and hemolymphatic neoplasia. -In the majority of cases an underlying antigen source is not identified and the disease is classed as idiopathic.\n\nGlomerular proteinuria is characteristically massive, and in many cases may lead to clinical signs related to protein loss and eventually the nephrotic syndrome.\n\nThe nephrotic syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and subcutaneous edema and/or ascites.\n\n\u2022 The proteinuria leads to hypoalbuminemia and subsequent development of edema.\n\nProtein-losing nephropathies are uncommon conditions in the cat.\n\n\u2022 Glomerulonephritis usually affects young adult cats (average age 3-4 years), with males being predisposed. The condition is rare. \u2022 Most cats with amyloidosis are over 5 years of age at diagnosis. Systemic reactive amyloidosis occurs as a familial disease in Abyssinian cats.\n\nClinical signs in early disease are principally weight loss with a good appetite and even polyphagia.\n\n\u2022 Signs frequently progress to inappetence and depression. \u2022 Continued protein loss eventually leads to the nephrotic syndrome with subcutaneous edema and/or ascites.\n\nPolyuria and polydipsia are common if the condition progresses to renal failure and uremia.\n\n\u2022 Polyuria and polydipsia are also common if there are medullary amyloid deposits. \u2022 Clinical signs of uremia may also be noted (see page 334, chronic renal failure).\n\nThe kidneys are usually small, firm and irregular on palpation.\n\nBoth conditions are associated with an underlying chronic antigenic stimulus, including infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Clinical signs may also relate to the underlying disease.\n\nSystemic hypertension may occur and result in hypertensive retinopathy, acute-onset blindness or neurological signs.\n\nThe prognosis is variable depending on the cause of the protein-losing nephropathy, although is generally considered poor if actual renal failure is present.\n\n\u2022 Clinical signs in glomerulonephritis may wax and wane, and occasionally undergo complete or prolonged periods of remission. \u2022 Amyloidosis tends to be slowly progressive, and is generally fatal.\n\nDiagnosis of protein-losing nephropathy is made on the documentation of proteinuria, in the absence of pre-and post-renal causes. A complete urinalysis should therefore be carried out.\n\n\u2022 Urinalysis typically reveals proteinuria with a benign sediment. A benign sediment excludes lower urinary tract disease as a cause of the proteinuria. \u2022 Hyaline casts may be noted on sediment examination. \u2022 In the early stages of disease, urine-concentrating ability may be retained. \u2022 Proteinuria is usually detected on qualitative screening tests, such as urine dipstick reagent strips.\n\nThe protein:creatinine ratio should be evaluated to further quantify the urinary protein loss.\n\n\u2022 Although the magnitude of the proteinuria can be used to predict the site of protein loss, there is great variability in ratios with different diseases. \u2022 The quantity of protein loss in glomerular disease is massive compared with that in pre-renal and postrenal proteinuria. Protein:creatinine ratios of greater than 13 commonly occur in glomerular proteinuria, although ratios generally range from mild to severe (ratio of 5-13).\n\nRoutine biochemistry should be evaluated.\n\n\u2022 Plasma protein concentrations may be variable, with hypoalbuminemia occurring if the protein loss is severe. Conversely, hyperglobulinemia may occur associated with the chronic inflammatory focus initiating the lesion. \u2022 Hypercholesterolemia is reported as a characteristic feature of the nephrotic syndrome, however it is a common non-specific finding in cats with any form of renal disease. \u2022 Azotemia and a low urine specific gravity will indicate the presence of renal failure.\n\nAbdominal radiography and ultrasound may provide information on renal architecture and size. \n\nSelf-limiting small bowel diarrhea is common after primary exposure, although it is often unrecognized.\n\nAcute fatal toxoplasmosis is recognized in kittens and immuno-compromised cats.\n\nChronic toxoplasmosis is characterized by diverse clinical signs depending on the tissue affected.\n\nRespiratory distress due to pneumonia is common in kittens and cats with acute infection.\n\nCentral nervous system disease, including ataxia and seizures, may occur either with acute or chronic infection.\n\nAnterior or posterior uveitis may be the only obvious sign present in some cats.\n\nMuscle stiffness or hyperesthesia.\n\nThe disease may be chronic with weight loss and lack of appetite. Occasionally, toxoplasma granulomas (tissue cysts) form in the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas causing chronic vomiting.\n\nRoutine laboratory testing is not specific for toxoplasmosis.\n\nDiagnosis of toxoplasmosis may be made on: \u2022 Rarely tachyzoites or bradyzoites may be identified in tissues, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and effusions. \u2022 Oocysts in the feces do not provide definitive diagnosis due to difficulties of identification.\n\n-Shedding only occurs for 1 or 2 weeks following initial infection, usually prior to illness. \u2022 Serologic testing for antibodies is helpful, but not definitive because clinically normal cats frequently have significant titers. The magnitude of the titers is not proportional to severity of the disease.\n\n-IgG titers may last for years and are common in normal cats indicating previous infection.\n\nA four-fold rise in IgG titer over 2-4 weeks suggests active infection. -A positive IgM titer persists for approximately 3 months, so tends to indicate recent infection but may persist for much longer.\n\n-A positive response to appropriate treatment provides a presumptive diagnosis.\n\nRoutine hematology and biochemistry findings are variable dependent on the tissues affected.\n\nThoracic radiography may reveal a pleural effusion and diffuse interstitial or alveolar patterns.\n\n\u2022 Progressive chronic nasal discharge and sneezing. \u2022 Soft tissue swelling over the nose, polypoid masses in the nasal cavity. \u2022 Neurological and ocular signs.\n\nSee main references on page 25 for details (The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease).\n\nCryptococcosis is the most common systemic fungal disease of the cat, and has a worldwide distribution.\n\nIt is most commonly acquired by inhalation, and so clinical signs are often localized to the respiratory tract. \u2022 Immune response leads to granuloma formation, leading to facial swellings and polypoid mass lesions within the nasal cavity. \u2022 Stertor and inspiratory dyspnea may occur. \u2022 Typically there is sneezing and mucopurulent nasal discharge (unilateral and bilateral), which is commonly blood tinged.\n\nThe central nervous system and eyes may be affected by direct extension from the nose.\n\n\u2022 Signs include depression, behavior changes, ataxia and seizures. \u2022 Ocular signs include granulomatous chorioretinitis and uveitis.\n\nDepression, inappetence (which occurs as a result of the inability to smell the food) and weight loss are common.\n\nSkin involvement (papules and draining nodules) with peripheral lymphadenopathy may occur.\n\nHistopathology may be required if cytology is not diagnostic.\n\nUsing a latex agglutination test to identify cryptococcal capsular antigen (on serum, urine or cerebrospinal fluid) provides a non-invasive, sensitive and specific diagnostic test.\n\nNasal radiography may reveal increased soft tissue density and bone destruction.\n\nPCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays are now available to detect cryptoccal antigens in biopsy material.\n\n\u2022 Vague, non-specific signs of weight loss, inappetence and depression. \u2022 Dyspnea.\n\nSee main references on pages 371, 388 for details (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nThe most common systemic mycoses (excluding cryptococcosis) are histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. \u2022 Both are geographically restricted infections.\n\n-Histoplasma capsulatum, the agent causing histoplasmosis, is endemic throughout large areas of the temperate and subtropical regions of the world. -Blastomycosis (caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis) is principally a disease of North America, but has occurred in Africa and Central America.\n\nHistory tends to be vague and chronic, including weight loss, inappetence and weakness.\n\nMild to moderate fever.\n\nInfection is commonly acquired by inhalation, and so clinical signs are often localized to respiratory tract.\n\n\u2022 Dyspnea and occasionally coughing may occur, with increased respiratory noise on auscultation. \u2022 Absence of respiratory signs does not exclude significant lung involvement.\n\nInvolvement of the gastrointestinal tract causes diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nPeripheral lymphadenopathy and granulomatous, ulcerating skin lesions may be noted.\n\nOcular involvement is common, and may cause a granulomatous retinitis, uveitis and panophthalmitis.\n\nHepatomegaly, splenomegaly and neurological signs may also be seen.\n\nCats with disseminated disease are generally extremely ill.\n\nDiagnosis is based on cytological identification of the organisms in exudates, fine-needle aspiration of lesions and lymph nodes, cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n\n\u2022 Fungal culture may assist, but is not required for identification of the organism.\n\nHistopathology may be required if cytology is not diagnostic, and shows pyogranulomatous lesions.\n\nSerology may be useful in the diagnosis of blastomycosis, but false-negative results may occur both early and late in the infection. It should be used in cases where there is a high level of suspicion of the disease, but organisms can not be demonstrated.\n\nThoracic radiography may show varying changes, however a diffuse interstitial or nodular interstitial pattern is most commonly seen.\n\nHematological changes tend to be non-specific, and include the presence of a mild non-regenerative anemia in some cases.\n\n\u2022 Congenital shunts usually show clinical signs by 6 months of age. \u2022 Weight loss or stunting (congenital shunts). \n\nPortosystemic shunts are vascular communications between the portal and systemic venous circulation, and may be a congenital anomaly or acquired. \u2022 Congenital portosystemic shunts in cats are usually single extrahepatic shunts resulting from developmental anomalies of the vitelline system.\n\n-Persian and Himalayan cats are predisposed.\n\n-A predilection for male cats has been suggested, and such cats are often crypt-orchid. -Cats with congenital shunts will usually show clinical signs by 6 months of age, however a congenital portosytemic shunt should not be excluded on the basis of age alone. \u2022 Multiple extrahepatic acquired portosystemic shunts are formed secondary to portal hypertension, and are extremely uncommon in the cat.\n\n-Acquired shunts usually occur in cats with chronic, severe, diffuse hepatic disease.\n\nSigns are often vague or non-specific and episodic.\n\nCats with congenital shunts may show stunting (smaller than littermates) or weight loss.\n\nClinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy predominate in cats with portosystemic shunts.\n\n\u2022 Vague anorexia, depression and weakness.\n\n\u2022 Ataxia, behavioral changes (bizarre and aggressive behavior), aimless pacing, blindness and seizures may occur. \u2022 Hypersalivation, often profuse, is also common.\n\nThere are often intermittent episodes of vomiting, diarrhea and inappetence with normal periods between.\n\nLower urinary tract signs are present in cats with concurrent urate urolithiasis.\n\nCopper-or golden-colored irises have been noted in some cats with portosystemic shunts.\n\nHeart murmurs have also been noted in some affected cats.\n\nAscites and signs of primary hepatic disease may be seen in cats with acquired portosystemic shunts.\n\nRoutine hematology and biochemistry may be unremarkable in cats with congenital portosystemic shunts however: \u2022 Routine hematology may reveal a mild non-regenerative, microcytic anemia often with poikilocytosis. \u2022 Hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia and decreased blood urea concentrations may indicate hepatic dysfunction.\n\nPre-and post-prandial serum bile acids should be assessed.\n\n\u2022 Pre-prandial bile acid concentrations may be normal or elevated. \u2022 Post-prandial bile acids are typically elevated, frequently exceeding 100 \u03bcmol/L (39.2 mg/L).\n\nHyperammonemia, particularly post prandial is commonly present.\n\nAbdominal radiographs may demonstrate microhepatica, but in many cats hepatic size is normal.\n\nAmmonium biurate crystals may be present on urine sediment examination.\n\n\u2022 Ammonium urate calculi are often radiolucent.\n\nOther techniques may be required to definitively demonstrate the presence of shunting vessels. \u2022 Transcolonic portal scintigraphy is a non-invasive technique but requires specialist equipment.\n\n-It may produce false-negative results when the shunt connects the gastric vein to the caudal vena cava, a common type of shunt in the cat. \u2022 Venous portography, although requiring surgery, is the definitive method for identifying shunts."}
