{"title": "Interferon \u03b1 Induces the Apoptosis of Cervical Cancer HeLa Cells by Activating both the Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Pathway", "body": "Human interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) belongs to the type I interferon (IFN-I) that are widely known to induce potent innate immune response against both viral infection and cancers [1,2,3]. IFN-\u03b1 exerts its anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting cell apoptosis, and/or suppressing oncogene expression [4,5,6,7,8,9]. IFN-\u03b1 has been increasingly used in clinics to treat a wide range of malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignant melanoma, and renal cell cancer (RCC) [10,11,12,13,14]. However, IFN-\u03b1 has been barely used in the treatment of cervical cancer either alone or in combination with other agents. Although cervical cancer is the leading threat to women\u2019s health worldwide, there is no cure to this disease at present [15,16]. Therefore, finding a novel and effective treatment for this disease is highly demanded and should be the direction of scientist\u2019s efforts.\n\nApoptosis is the basic physiological process of the body to eliminate either the damaged, aged, or mutated cells to maintain homeostasis of the body system [17,18,19,20]. Cell apoptotic signals can be generated from and transmitted through different cellular compartments such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or the death receptors on cell surfaces [21,22]. Although induced by different means, apoptosis is primarily executed by a family of proteases known as the caspases (cysteinyl, aspartate-specific proteases), and among them the activation of caspase 3 is the hallmark of apoptosis. The apoptotic signal may target the outer membrane of mitochondria to increase membrane permeability, which in turn promotes the release of cytochrome c [22]. The apoptotic signal may be generated from the ER by various stresses in a caspase 4 dependent and independent manner. In addition, the membrane proximity-induced activations of caspases 8 and 10 release the respective cleaved caspase molecules within the cytoplasm [23,24,25,26]. Subsequently, the three pathways stimulate the common effectors (caspases 3, 6, and 7) to ultimately execute cell apoptosis.\n\nIn this study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-\u03b1 on cervical cancer. The influence of IFN-\u03b1 on HeLa cell proliferation and apoptosis was systematically evaluated. We demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1-induced cell apoptosis in HeLa cells is mainly due to the activations of both the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase 4/ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, but independent of the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.\n\nIt has been shown that IFN-\u03b1 is able to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce cell apoptosis in some cancer cell types [27]. We hypothesized that IFN-\u03b1 may also possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on HeLa cells. To test this hypothesis, the levels of glucose and lactate of HeLa cell culture medium after IFN-\u03b1 treatment were determined. Figure 1A,B show that the glucose level increased and lactate level decreased when the delivered doses of IFN-\u03b1 were enhanced, indicating that the proliferation potential of HeLa cells was inhibited. Consistently, IFN-\u03b1 treatment on HeLa cells resulted in a marked and dose-dependent reduction on the amount of viable cells, as demonstrated by both MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Figure 1C) and Cell-Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assays (Figure 1D).\n\nInhibition of cell proliferation often leads to cell apoptosis. To test this possibility, HeLa cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 for 48 h and subjected to annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis showed a marked increase in the population of Annexin V+/PI\u2212 cells in response to a higher dose of IFN-\u03b1 delivery (Figure 2A), indicating that early apoptosis is induced upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Statistical analysis showed that a higher dose delivery of IFN-\u03b1 significantly increased the population of apoptotic cells (Figure 2B). To further define the optimal dose of IFN-\u03b1, HeLa cells were treated with six increasing doses (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/mL) of IFN-\u03b1 for 48 h. Figure 2C shows that dose-dependent apoptosis was induced as the IFN-\u03b1 concentration increased from 0 to 50 ng/mL. The result also indicates that IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis reaches a platform when the delivered dose of IFN-\u03b1 is more than 50 ng/mL. To further confirm this result, whole-cell lysates were prepared from these IFN-\u03b1-treated cells (depicted in Figure 2C) and probed with anti-caspase 3 and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies, then subjected to Western blot analysis. Figure 2D demonstrates that the increased delivery of IFN-\u03b1 significantly reduced the pre-caspase3 expressions and markedly increased the cleaved caspase 3 expressions, indicating that IFN-\u03b1-induced cell apoptosis indeed reaches a platform after 50 ng/mL. Based on the above information, we chose the concentration 100 ng/mL as the optimal dose for IFN-\u03b1 treatment in the experiments afterwards.\n\nNext, we asked whether or not IFN-\u03b1-induced cell apoptosis is associated with the activation of the intrinsic mitochondria pathway. To address this question directly, cell lysates prepared from IFN-\u03b1-treated HeLa cells were probed with anti-Bim, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-caspase 3, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1), and anti-cleaved-PARP1 antibodies. Bcl-xL belongs to the BCL2 family and exerts its anti-apoptotic function by preventing the oligomerization of Bax/Bak proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the other member of BCL2 family, Bim, has the opposite effect by promoting cell apoptosis [28]. Oligomeric Bax/Bak proteins that are inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane can cause alterations of membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c, which eventually activates caspase 3 for executing cell apoptosis [29]. Indeed, IFN-\u03b1 treatment was observed to markedly enhance the expression level of Bim protein, dramatically inhibit the protein expression of Bcl-xL, and significantly activate caspase 3 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). In addition, a slight increase in the production of the cleaved PARP1 was also detected as the doses of IFN-\u03b1 increased (Figure 3A).\n\nFigure 3B shows that the expression levels of cytochrome c in whole-cell lysates were markedly increased, comparable to the dose-dependent activation of caspase 3, indicating that cytochrome c might be released into cytoplasm from mitochondrion upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment. To further confirm this result, both the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions of the IFN-\u03b1 treated HeLa cells were separated using a mitochondria isolation kit. Figure 3B further demonstrates that the expression level of cytochrome c in mitochondria was significantly decreased as the delivered dose of IFN-\u03b1 increased, while that in the cytoplasm was the opposite. Thus, the data strongly indicates that IFN-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis is associated with the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in HeLa cells.\n\nIn addition to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, the activations of both the extrinsic and ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways might also contribute to IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis. To test these possibilities, the expressions of caspase 8, 10, as well as caspase 4 were evaluated. As described earlier, the activation of caspases 8 and 10 can turn on the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, while human caspase 4 (equal to mouse caspase 12)\u2014localized on the cytoplasmic side of the ER outer membrane\u2014plays a major role in ER stress-mediated cell death [30,31]. Figure 4A shows that the increased doses of IFN-\u03b1 did not significantly alter the expression levels of caspases 8/10, while in contrast, caspases 8/10 could be activated by the combined effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 plus cycloheximide (CHX) in a TNF-\u03b1 dose-dependent manner. In addition, the activation of caspase 4 could be induced by increased doses of IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 4B), indicating that the caspase 4-related ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, but not the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, may also contribute to IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis in HeLa cells.\n\nTo further verify the result, caspase 4 small interfering RNA (siCasp 4) was constructed for knocking down the endogenous caspase 4 expressions in HeLa cells. Figure 5A,B demonstrate the specific inhibition of siCasp4 on the targeted gene expressions at both mRNA and protein levels, respectively. To test whether or not the caspase 4-related ER-stress pathway contributes to IFN-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either control or siCasp 4 along with increasing doses (0, 10, 100 ng/mL) of IFN-\u03b1. Cell apoptotic analysis shows that a significant rescue of IFN-\u03b1-mediated HeLa cell apoptosis by siCasp 4 can be observed when a higher dose (100 ng/mL) of IFN-\u03b1 was used (Figure 5C,D). All these data articulate that the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway is also activated by IFN-\u03b1 treatment in HeLa cells.\n\nTo investigate the interrelationship between the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway during IFN-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either control siRNA or siCasp 4 in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b1 treatment (100 ng/mL). The whole-cell lysates were collected at 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis. Despite the fact that knocking down caspase 4 markedly reduced IFN-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis (Figure 5C,D), inhibition of caspase 4 expression barely affected the IFN-\u03b1-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by the fact that the addition of siCasp 4 did not rescue IFN-\u03b1-mediated Bcl-xL repression, nor did it inhibit the up-regulation of cytochrome c; however, it markedly reduced the cleavage of caspase 3 (Figure 6). Collectively, these data indicate that both the caspase 4-related ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway are independently activated by IFN-\u03b1 in HeLa cells.\n\nCervical cancer is considered to be the second most common malignancy among women worldwide. Currently, there is no cure to this disease, especially to high-risk patients infected by high-risk human be considered ideal, simply due to the adverse reproductive consequences and the presence papillomaviruses (HPVs) such as HPV16 and HPV18. Standard treatments such as ablation and cervical conization are the common strategies for early cervical cancer therapy, but are not recommended for high-risk HPV-infected patients [32]. In addition, most of the cervical cancer patients also receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy either solely or in combination. However, none of these approaches should of persistent HPV infection in the remaining cancer tissues after classic therapy [33]. More recently, the immunotherapy approach, with the help of immunomodulators, has attracted more attention, since this approach can enhance HPV-specific cellular immune responses that might be critical for eliminating HPV-specific neoplasia [16,34]. In this study, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1 alone may possess anticancer capacity by inducing the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells via the intrinsic and ER-stress related apoptotic pathways.\n\nIFN-\u03b1 has been used as a sensitizing agent for the treatment of numerous malignant human cancers such as renal cell cancer [35], gastric cancer cells [36], malignant melanoma [37], as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [9,38], and is most often associated with the stimulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway [13,37]. Although the observation that IFN-\u03b1 can promote cell apoptosis in cervical cancer cells has been documented before [39,40], the detailed mechanism controlling IFN-\u03b1-induced cell apoptosis is less clear. Here, we first systematically address this issue by using IFN-\u03b1-treated HeLa cells as a study model.\n\nApoptotic signaling can be generated from cell membrane, mitochondria, and ER. We showed that IFN-\u03b1 treatment on HeLa cells not only results in the decrease of glucose consumption and lactate production, but also causes the activation of apoptotic promoting protein Bim and the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (Figure 3A). Our results first demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1 treatment promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway can be activated by IFN-\u03b1. Yang et al. first showed that IFN-\u03b1 was able to stimulate the cleavage of caspase 4 in HeLa cells [20]. Our results confirm their observation, and further show that IFN-\u03b1-mediated caspase 4 cleavage contributes to the IFN-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. However, IFN-\u03b1 treatment fails to activate caspase 8 and 10\u2014the important initiators for extrinsic apoptosis\u2014in HeLa cells, indicating that the IFN-\u03b1-induced apoptosis may be independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our data demonstrate that IFN-\u03b1-mediated HeLa cell apoptosis may involve both of the intrinsic and caspase 4-related ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways, however, how these two pathways regulate IFN-\u03b1-induced apoptosis needs to be further explored.\n\nHuman cervical cancercell line (HeLa) was derived from the Cell Culture Center of Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 \u00b0C supplemented with 5% CO2.

Rabbit anti-PARP1 and rabbit anti-cleaved-PARP1 antibodies were purchased from Epitomics Inc. (Burlingame, CA, USA). Mouse anti-caspase 8 and rabbit anti-caspase 10 were purchased from Bioworld Technology Inc. (St. Louis Park, MN, USA). Rabbit anti-caspase 4, rabbit anti-cleaved-caspase 8, rabbit anti-cleaved-caspase 3, and rabbit anti-mtHSP70 were purchased from Proteintech Group Inc. (Rosemont, IL, USA). The peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Zhongshan Biotechnology (Beijing, China). Recombinant human interferon \u03b1 1 was from ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd. (Rehovot, Israel). Human tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma-Aldrich Corp (St. Louis, MO, USA). The primers for caspase-4 siRNA, 5\u2032-AGCTTGCCTCAGTCTGAAGGACAACTCGAGTTGTCCTTCAGACTGAGGCG-3\u2032(sense) and 5\u2032-GATCCGCCTCAGTCTGAAGGACAACTCGAGTTGTCCTTCAGACTGAGGCA-3\u2032 (antisense) were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).\n\nThe levels of glucose and lactate in cell culture medium were detected by Biosen C-Line (EKF Diagnostics, Cardiff, UK). Equal amounts of cells were seeded into a 12-well culture plate. After 24 or 48 h treatment with IFN-\u03b1, a 10 \u03bcL culture medium from each well was added into the reaction mixture. Detection was performed using Biosen C-Line instrument.\n\nCell proliferation potential was evaluated by both MTT and CCK-8 assays. Briefly, equal amounts of cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and treated with IFN-\u03b1 for 24 or 48 h before testing. MTT solution or Cell-Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan) solution was added into each well. After 2.5\u20133 h incubation, the absorbance at 490 or 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.\n\nCell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Biotool, Beijing, China). After 48 h treatment with IFN-\u03b1, the cells were harvested and washed with precooled 1\u00d7 PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). The cell pellet was resuspended with 50 \u03bcL 1\u00d7 binding buffer followed by adding 5 \u03bcL Annexin V-FITC and 5 \u03bcL propidiumiodide (PI). The reaction mixture was incubated away from light for 15 min at room temperature. Then, another 150 \u03bcL binding buffer was added into the mixture. The reaction product was subjected to flow cytometric analysis by Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nMitochondria were isolated using Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as described in the manual.\n\nAfter 48 h incubation, the IFN-\u03b1-treated HeLa cells were collected. The cell pellet was lysed with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNAs were precipitated from the aqueous phase upon chloroform treatment and then subjected to qRT-PCR analysis using One Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) with primers listed in Table 1. The real-time qRT-PCR was performed using iQ7 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The reverse transcription was conducted at 42 \u00b0C for 5 min. After denaturing at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, the PCR reaction was performed at 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and repeated for 40 cycles. The dissociation of the reaction products was from 55to 95 \u00b0C as the temperature was increased by 0.2 \u00b0C per 10 s. The \u03b2-actin gene expression served as an internal control for normalization.\n\nThe IFN-\u03b1-treated HeLa cells and control cells were collected after 48 h incubation. The cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, plus proteinase inhibitors. The resolved protein samples by SDS-PAGE were blotted onto Hybond nitrocellular membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). The reaction product was first probed with a primary antibody. After extensively washing, a second antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and specific for the Fc of the first antibody was employed. The reaction products were developed using the chemiluminescence kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n\nStatistical differences were carried out using standard Student\u2019s t test (two-tailed, unpaired). The statistical difference was considered to be significant as p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**).\n\nIn the current study, HeLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN-\u03b1 on cervical cancer. We found that IFN-\u03b1 could markedly inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in HeLa cells. IFN-\u03b1 activates both the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and ER stress-induced pathway in HeLa cells. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized role of IFN-\u03b1 on HeLa cells and may provide a new train of thought for future mechanistic studies."}
