{"title": "Supplementary Information Acetylation regulates Cyclophilin A catalysis, immunosuppression and HIV isomerisation", "body": "The purification steps contained 20 mM nicotinamide to inhibit deacetylation. The final buffer conditions of CypAAcK were 50 mM K 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 pH 6.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM \u03b2mercaptoethanol (buffer A). HIV1 and HIV2 N-terminal capsid proteins were expressed in E. coli and precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 20% (w/v) essentially as described 1 . Following resuspension and dialysis the proteins were purified by SP ion-exchange and size exclusion.\n\nAll measurements were carried out in buffer A (see above \n\nData were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM and scaled in SCALA 3 . Initial phases were determined with the program Phaser 4 using the CypA structure (PDB: 2CPL 5 ) as a template.\n\nThe phases for the HIV1-CA N :CypAAcK-compex were obtained using the HIV1-CA "}
