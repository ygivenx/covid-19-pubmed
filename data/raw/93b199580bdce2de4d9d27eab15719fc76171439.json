{"title": "Corresponding author(s)", "body": "Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.\n\nFor all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.\n\nThe exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly\n\nThe statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one-or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.\n\nA description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)\n\nFor null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted \n\nPolicy information about availability of data All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable: For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf\n\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n\nSamples of seven pneumonia patients are available from the clinical hospital to be sent to Wuhan Institute of Virology for pathogen identification. The coronavirus genome sequences were obtained from 5 different patients and shared >99.9% identity, suggesting they were infected by the same virus. Therefore, the sample size is sufficient for conducting the following study which aims to identify and characterize the causative agent of this pneumonia outbreak. \n\nCell line source(s) Authentication All monkey and human cells were from ATCC with authentication. The authentication was performed by microscope morphology check, growth curve analysis or identity verification with STR analysis (for human cell lines).\n\nWe confirm that all cells were tested as mycoplasma negative.\n\nCommonly misidentified lines (See ICLAC register)\n\nNo commonly misidentified cell lines were used.\n\nATCC."}
