{"title": "Development and evaluation of SYBR Green-I based quantitative PCR assays for herpes simplex virus type 1 whole transcriptome analysis NIH Public Access", "body": "The human Herpesviridae family consists of 9 large DNA viruses that encode open reading frames that specify between 74 and 164 genes. The alphaherpesvirus, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), specifies a 152 kilobase pair genome that encodes 77 open reading frames of which three are diploid (Pellett and Roizman, 2007; Roizman et al, 2007) . These genes are expressed during the HSV lytic replicative cycle in a triphasic sequential and coordinately regulated temporal cascade of gene expression Roizman, 1974, 1975; . First, immediate early or alpha (IE/a) genes are expressed immediately upon deposition of viral DNA into the nucleus Roizman, 1974, 1975) . Next, IE proteins launch the expression of early or Beta (E/\u03b23) genes that initiate viral DNA replication and elicit subsequent late or gamma (L/\u03b3) gene expression (Honess and Roizman, 1974) ; Lastly, the L/\u03b3 genes consist of proteins that are either structural in nature or function to mediate capsid assembly, virion maturation, and viral egress (Honess and Roizman, 1974) . The gamma gene class has been further subdivided into \u03b31 and \u03b32 genes, with \u03b32 gene transcription absolutely dependent on viral DNA replication. Consequently, the effects of cellular proteins, viral gene mutations/deletions, or pharmaceutical drugs on these highly ordered viral transcriptional patterns can provide insights into their functional activities. For example, HSV infected cells that are treated with the viral DNA replication inhibitors foscarnet or acyclovir exhibit an altered transcriptional pattern, whereby there is an accumulation of early \u03b2 transcripts and suppression of late \u03b3 gene expression (Jones and Roizman, 1979; Holland et al, 1980; Hall et al., 1982) .\n\nMicroarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) are emerging and expanding high throughput technologies that enable whole genome transcriptional analysis of the effects of various experimental conditions. In virus infected cells, these technologies enable simultaneous assessment of both host and viral transcription. However, despite these technologies generating data with immense depth, results still require confirmation by more standard and accepted approaches, such as quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). qPCR arrays, such as the system presented in this study, can complement, corroborate, and validate results obtained from these contemporary methodologies. For most viruses with small genomes, designing qPCR assays that can assess whole genome transcriptional changes is relatively uncomplicated. However, for viruses with large complex genomes, like those of the Herpesviridae family, the enormity of the task can be challenging.\n\nIn order to assess the effects of various conditions on viral transcription, we have developed a compilation of qPCR assays within plate arrays that represent the breadth of the whole viral genome. These qPCR arrays were designed to: (1) represent the entire HSV genome across all HSV transcriptional classes; (2) utilize adaptable SYBR Green-I-based quantitation to alleviate probe design, synthesis and development that is expensive and would be required for 74 individual HSV-1 genes; (3) be specific for target viral genes without cross-reactivity to host cellular transcripts; (4) minimize the required number of amplification conditions; (5) follow, where possible, Minimal Information for Publication of Quantitative Realtime PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines for qPCR assay development (Bustin et al., 2009; Bustin, 2010; Huggett et al., 2013) ; (6) quantify levels of viral transcripts relative to a host reference gene; (7) be linear in amplification across varying target concentrations; and (8) be reproducible with minimal intra-or inter-assay variation. Described in this study is the development, evaluation and implementation of these assays to assess relative transcriptional kinetic profiles of representative genes from each transcriptional class.\n\nAfrican green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. The RE strain of HSV-1 (HSV-1(RE)), a known corneal keratitis inducing strain of HSV-1 (Hendricks et al., 1989; Hendricks and Tumpey, 1990) , was one of the parental wildtype strains utilized in these studies and was obtained initially from Dr. James Hill, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Lions Eye Center. HSV-1(RE) virus stocks were propagated in Vero cells and stored as infectious cell preparations at \u221280 \u00b0C. Purified HSV-1 KOS strain (ATCC) viral genomic DNA was prepared on a sodium iodide gradient, resuspended in Tris EDTA buffer, and stored as aliquoted frozen stocks.\n\nThe published genomic sequence of human herpesvirus 1, strain 17 (Genbank Accession no. NC_001806.1) was used as template to identify comprehensive, genome-wide coding sequences for each HSV-1 transcript (McGeoch et al., 1988a, b) . In order to specifically amplify regions within each coding sequence, unique primers were designed to avoid overlapping genes and assessed subsequently for potential hairpin formations, 3\u2032 complementarities, and self-annealing sites using OligoCalc (Kibbe, 2007) . Primer pairs were selected to generate amplicons of 90-200 base pairs (Tables 1-5 ). All primer sets were designed initially with uniform annealing temperatures to facilitate assessing multiple gene targets within the same PCR run. Prospective primers and their generated amplicons were analyzed in silico for cross-reactivity and recognition of other HSV-1 strains and verified to have no significant homology to Homo sapiens host genes using the genomic database for human and human transcripts and BLASTn (NCBI). All designed iterations of primer pairs were tested empirically for amplification of target genes from HSV-1 KOS genomic viral DNA and cDNA isolated from HSV-1 RE infected cells. Any primer pairs that exhibited any amplification product at or before 30 cycles from cDNA prepared from non-infected cell lysates were excluded from further analysis. The specificity of each selected primer pair was evaluated by melt curve analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing and confirmed to be a single uniform amplification product of appropriate apparent molecular size and sequence. Final optimized primer sequences, associated gene references, specific assay conditions, and amplicon characteristics are described in Tables 1-5. In addition, cellular 18s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was utilized to normalize qPCR reactions (FOR: 5\u2032CCAGTAAGTGCGGGTCATAAGC3\u2032; REV: 5\u2032GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAATCGG3\u2032) (Mbong et al., 2012) . All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT-DNA, Coralville, IA, USA).\n\nTo initiate synchronous infection for kinetics analysis, HSV-1 RE strain (MOI = 5) was adsorbed for 1 h on subconfluent Vero cells in 12-well plates that were pre-chilled (4\u00b0C) in 500 \u03bcl DMEM, 1.5% heat-inactivated FCS, as we have described previously (Foster et al., 1998 (Foster et al., , 1999 Kadeppagari et al., 2012; Sanchez et al., 2012) . Following the 1 h incubation, all media was removed, replaced with 1 ml of pre-warmed (37 \u00b0C) media and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, or 24 h. At the respective time points, culture supernatants were removed and cells were lysed in 350 \u03bcl RLT Buffer (Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit) with gentle scraping of each well to harvest all cell lysates. Cell lysates were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until RNA purification. Within 24 h of harvest, cell lysates were thawed on ice and total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the exception that two optional DNAse I digestion steps were employed to ensure the absence of contaminating viral genomic DNA. First, DNAseI was added to cell lysates prior to RNA purification and then contaminating DNA was further digested via an on-column digestion using RNAse-free DNAse I in Buffer RDD for 15 min at room temperature. All samples were eluted in 50 \u03bcl of RNAse-free water and quantified by spectrophotometry.\n\ncDNA was synthesized immediately after RNA purification using the iScript\u2122 cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Each 100 \u03bcl cDNA reaction consisted of 20 \u03bcl 5 \u00d7 iScript reaction mix, 5 \u03bcl iScript reverse transcriptase, and 4 \u03bcg RNA template. Thermal cycling was conducted as follows: 5 min at 25 \u00b0C, 30 min at 42 \u00b0C, followed by 5 min at 85 \u00b0C. Parallel cDNA reactions lacking reverse transcriptase enzyme were included for each experiment to evaluate the presence of contaminating genomic DNA.\n\nSYBR Green-I based qPCR was performed using the indicated primer pairs for each target gene (Tables 1-5). Real-time qPCR was carried out using iQ\u2122 SYBR \u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories; 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 100 mM KCl, 1.6 mM dNTPs, 0.625U antibody-mediated hot-start iTaq DNA polymerase, 6 mM MgCl 2 , SYBR Green-I, 20 nM fluorescein, and stabilizers). Each 25 \u03bcl total PCR reaction contained 3 \u03bcl of 1:4 diluted cDNA template, 12.5 \u03bcl iQ\u2122 SYBR \u00ae Green Supermix, and 200 nM of each primer. All realtime qPCR reactions were carried out using a Bio-Rad CFX96\u2122 Real-Time System and CFX Manager 2.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in white Multiplate\u2122 96well plates covered with Microseal 'B' adhesive seals. Three-step cycling parameters were used for a majority of PCR reactions and were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by a 30 s extension at 72 \u00b0C. To minimize cross-reactivity issues and increase specificity, a two-step cycling parameter was used for PCR reactions against UL30 and UL42 and was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and annealing at 65 \u00b0C for 30 s. Following amplification, amplicon specificity and purity for each PCR run was confirmed by melt curve analysis.\n\n2.6. Agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR purification, and DNA sequencing 7 \u03bcl aliquots of all HSV target gene PCR products were analyzed for purity and specificity on a 1.8% agarose gel run in 0.5 \u00d7 Tris Borate EDTA (TBE) buffer. The remaining amplified DNA was purified using DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 columns and reagents (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's directions. Purified PCR products were sequenced directly (ACGT, Inc) using gene specific primers. Sequences were compared to the HSV-1 genome and the NCBI database (BLASTn) to confirm specificity of each HSV target gene amplified.\n\nAssay precision was determined for representative HSV target genes. Amplification of target genes across a 2-fold dilution series of HSV-1 KOS strain genomic DNA (from 42.2 pg to 1350 pg) was assessed and the Cq values were plotted relative to genomic DNA. The linearity of amplification for each gene was determined by the R 2 values of each dilution series. Intra-assay (within the day/across the plate) and inter-assay (independent assessment over 4 days/between plate) variability was determined according to MIQE (Minimal Information for Publication of Quantitative Realtime PCR Experiments) guidelines (McGowin et al., 2009; Bustin et al., 2009; Bustin, 2010; Huggett et al., 2013) . The mean, standard deviation (S.D.), coefficient of variation (CV) of the cycle of quantification (Cq) were calculated separately for amplification of representative target genes from cDNA prepared at 4 and 12 h post infection (h p.i.) or genomic viral DNA. The intra-and interassay variability assessed by the CV was determined by the S.D./mean multiplied by 100 to express as a percentage CV, as described previously (Santhosh et al., 2007; Bustin et al., 2009; Amer and Almajhdi, 2011) .\n\nqPCR was performed on arrays of representative genes from each HSV-1 transcriptional gene class to quantify viral transcript abundance at 0,1, 2, 4, 8,12,18, and 24 h p.i. Viral gene transcripts were normalized to the mean Cq values (meanCq of18s@timeX ) of cellular 18s rRNA expression, which was determined as the mean Cq of in triplicate parallel reactions for each time point (Chey et al., 2010) . Normalized viral transcript expression levels relative to the internal cellular 18s rRNA reference gene were calculated by the \u0394Cq at time X using the equation: \u0394Cq timeX = (Cq ofviraltranscript@timeX -meanCq of18s@timeX ). Relative fold change in gene expression for each specific viral gene was calculated by the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394C q method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . For each time point of each gene analyzed, the \u0394\u0394Cq was determined relative to that gene's \u0394Cq value at a time point for that gene's kinetic class where gene expression was first detected. That was for \u03b1 genes at 1 h p.i., for \u03b2 genes at 2h p.i. and for \u03b3 genes at 4h p.i. Therefore, the \u0394\u0394q = (\u0394Cq of viral transcript@timeX -\u0394Cq ofviraltranscript@timeY ); where Y = (\u03b1 genes:1 h p.i.; \u03b2 genes:2 h p.i.; \u03b3 genes:4 h p.i.). Relative fold change for each time point was then expressed by the equation 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394C q.\n\nHeat maps were generated within Microsoft Excel to assist in visualization and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns. The fold change values across each individual gene, as calculated by the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394C q method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) , were converted to colorized values using Excel's conditional formatting color-scale function and a three defined point color scale gradient: (1) no expression was assigned a bright green color; (2) the highest value in the kinetic series was assigned a bright red color; (3) the 50th percentile within the kinetic series was assigned a bright yellow color; (4) values that fell within these three specific color identifiers were assigned within the gradient of colors between these values. Assigned color values and genes were segregated by gene transcriptional class and figures were compiled in Adobe Photoshop.\n\nIn order to enable whole HSV-1 transcriptome level validation of microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, we developed a series of primer sets that target each lytic gene of the HSV-1 genome. After several design and testing iterations, final optimized primer sets were selected to not be affected by nucleotide variations amongst HSV-1 strains, to not be cross-reactive with cellular genes, and to not form primer-dimers. The detailed sequences, gene identification numbers, and amplicon size of these primers are segregated by their respective documented or suggested gene transcriptional class (Pellett and Roizman, 2007; Roizman et al, 2007) and are shown in Tables 1-5. Criteria for primer set acceptability included: (1) number of cycles required to develop a detectable signal (Cq) from HSV-1 genomic DNA and infected cell cDNA; (2) complete absence of amplification in control samples; (3) uniform primer concentrations for all gene targets; (4) simultaneous arrayed analysis of most HSV-1 genes by minimizing the number of annealing temperatures required; (5) linearity and accuracy of gene amplifications; (6) reproducibility and precision of amplification reactions; and (7) ability to detect target genes from several HSV-1 strains, includingHSV-1 syn17+, KOS, and RE from genomic and cDNA templates.\n\nOptimal quantitative SYBR Green-I PCR assay conditions were established for these primer sets that resulted in robust linear amplification of HSV-1 target gene transcripts with no amplification signals from uninfected cDNA controls. This required two different reaction conditions. For the vast majority of HSV genes (72 of 74 genes) and cellular 18s rRNA reference gene, reaction conditions with a 55 \u00b0C annealing temperature was utilized (Tables 1-5; Fig. 1C ; Supplemental Figs. 1C, 2C, and 3C). However, two beta genes, UL30 and UL42, required altered reaction conditions with an annealing temperature of 65 \u00b0C in order to fulfill all of our specificity requirements (Table 2; Supplemental Fig. 2B and C) . Specific reaction conditions are provided in Section 2.5. All individual qPCR assays exhibited a single linear amplification phase within the logarithmic curve for both genomic viral DNA and cDNA of viral transcripts from infected cells. However, the HSV-1 genomic DNA and infected cell cDNA amplification curves differed due to variances in the levels of the target gene at the specific time point assessed. The method of calculating Cq values from where they cross the indicated threshold are provided within the Section 2. Since HSV-1 has a limited number of spliced genes, primers could not be designed across introns. Therefore, the most critical assay optimization was ensuring that viral genomic DNA was removed completely prior to quantitative analysis. This was verified by the absence of detectable amplification within the no reverse transcriptase (NRT) controls. The complete degradation of genomic viral DNA was ensured by extracting, processing, and purifying RNA with the protocols in Section 2.3.\n\nSupplementary material related to this article can be found, in the online version, at http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.02.010.\n\nFollowing real-time gene amplification, a dissociation curve analysis was performed to establish each gene product's specific melting temperature (Tm) and that only a single Tm, which represented a single amplification product, was present. Tm's for individual HSV-1 genes ranged from 83.5 \u00b0C to 91.5 \u00b0C and are presented for each gene in Tables 1-5. All reactions where potential HSV-1 target genes were present (HSV-1 infected cell cDNA and HSV-1 KOS genomic DNA) exhibited a single dissociation peak (Fig. 1B , red or blue lines; Supplemental Figs. 1B, 2B and 3B, red or blue lines). No dissociation curve/Tm was reported for any reactions from cDNA made from uninfected cells due to lack of PCR amplification (Fig. 1B , green lines; Supplemental Figs. 1B, 2B and 3B, green lines). For two genes, UL23/thymidine kinase (TK) and UL41/virion host shutoff (VHS), there was a 0.5 \u00b0C difference between amplification products from HSV-1 genomic DNA from the KOS strain versus cDNA from the RE strain (Tables 2 and 4; Fig. 1 :B2, red versus blue lines). In silico and sequencing analysis of these amplification products revealed a one nucleotide difference within the PCR products of these two strains that could account for the observed differences in Tm. The Tm's reported in Tables 1-5 can be utilized as a reference to confirm specificity and proper gene amplification in future experiments.\n\nThe ability of each reaction to amplify a single PCR product representative of its specific gene target was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. Following amplification reactions, all HSV PCR products from each of the 3 conditions were separated on a 1.8% TBE agarose gel. All amplification reactions where potential HSV-1 target genes were present (HSV-1 infected cell cDNA and HSV-1 KOS genomic DNA) exhibited a single amplification product ( Fig. 1A ; Supplemental Figs. 1A, 2A and 3A) that had an apparent molecular weight that corresponded to the calculated molecular weights of the specific amplicons (Tables 1-5). As expected, no PCR products were evident in amplification reactions of cDNA from uninfected cells. Amplified gene products were sent for direct sequencing and determined to be specific for each HSV-1 target gene. Collectively, these analyses indicated that the observed amplification plots for each target gene were specific for the HSV-1 target that they were designed to detect.\n\nThe linearity and precision of the developed quantitative PCR assays for representative genes from the three HSV-1 transcriptional gene classes was evaluated across a 2 fold dilution series of HSV-1 genomic DNA. The resulting amplification plots and analysis of linearity are shown ( Fig. 2B and A, respectively) . In these reactions, amplification of each of these representative genes across serial 2 fold dilutions of HSV-1 genomic DNA exhibited notable linearity with R 2 values ranging from 0.9905 to 0.9988.\n\nTo further assess the precision of the developed assays, intra-and inter-assay variability was determined for representative genes from each of HSV's transcriptional gene classes in accordance with MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al, 2009; Bustin, 2010; Huggett et al., 2013) . For each representative gene, precision and reproducibility of each assay was established based on the Cq values obtained from either three separate reactions within a single run (intra-assay or well-to-well variability) or in three consecutive runs over 4 days (inter-assay or plate-to-plate/run-to-run variability) ( Table 6 ) (Santhosh et al., 2007; Amer and Almajhdi, 2011) . The calculated S.D. and CV for each intra-assay assessment were low, ranging from 0.02 to 0.12 and from 0.10% to 0.65%, respectively. The inter-assay variability was also exceptionally low with a calculated S.D. range from 0.05 to 0.36 and a CV range from 0.28% to 1.66%.\n\nEach of the HSV-1 transcriptional gene classes follow well described coordinated temporal patterns of expression that are expressed sequentially. Regulation of these patterns of gene expression is paramount in orchestrating efficient HSV genomic replication and virion assembly. The suitability of these developed PCR assays to assess quantitatively HSV-1 gene transcription was evaluated at various times post infection across a 24 h kinetic course. Relative fold change in expression of each specific gene was determined using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394C q method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) as described in the methods section. During the course of infection, representative genes exhibited patterns of gene expression that reflected the prescribed expression patterns of each gene class (Fig. 3A) .\n\nA heat map approach was utilized to assist in visualization and comparative kinetic analysis of gene expression patterns. Segregation and alignment of these heat maps by HSV-1 gene transcriptional class revealed differences in patterns of gene expression that were specific to each class (Fig. 3B) . Whereas, most genes in the beta and gamma classes exhibited one pattern of gene expression, genes in the alpha class exhibited two distinct patterns of gene expression. Interestingly, one beta gene, UL2, did not appear similar to the other beta genes, but had a pattern that was reminiscent of the gamma gene class (Fig. 3B ).\n\nEmerging technologies that enable whole transcriptome analysis of viral and cellular gene expression are becoming rapidly more commonplace. Since Dr. Edward Wagner's laboratory developed an oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray approach to study global changes in HSV-1 gene transcript abundance in the late 1990s, many techniques have been developed or utilized for analyzing levels of alpha-herpesvirus gene expression to facilitate recognition of broad effects of various treatments or cellular factors on viral gene expression (Stingley et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2002; Cohrs et al., 2003 Cohrs et al., , 2006 Aguilar et al, 2005 Aguilar et al, , 2006 Deitch et al, 2005; Kennedy et al., 2005; Kamakura et al., 2008) . However, these techniques can be expensive, generate an immense dataset that requires extensive and complicated analysis, and often still require validation or replication for statistical evaluation by secondary methods, such as qPCR. These factors limit their utility in examining the effects of various treatments at multiple kinetic points, as each new condition or time point increases exponentially the parameters required to be assessed. This study describes the development and evaluation of individual qPCR assays that represent collectively the breadth of the entire HSV-1 transcriptome in a format that would reduce overall cost and simplify assessment of gene expression. Although there are other reports of qPCR primers and conditions that represent individual or subsets of HSV-1 (Chen et al., 1997; Hukkanen et al., 2000; Broberg et al, 2003; Carr and Al-Khatib, 2003; Wang et al, 2005) , this work represents a compilation of optimized primer sets and validated reaction conditions that were developed specifically to analyze the entire HSV-1 lytic transcriptome.\n\nEach individual qPCR assay was designed to work in conjunction with other assays and therefore enabled their compilation into a plate arrays that could analyze the majority of HSV-1 genes within a single PCR run. Amplification reactions for HSV-1 target genes were designed to be quantified using SYBR Green-I-based detection, such as to not require expensive probe generation and to permit assay adaptability with additional cellular or viral genes. Quantitative analysis of gene expression via SYBR Green-I detection had several advantages for whole HSV genome level transcriptome assay design and expression analysis: (1) SYBR Green-I could be applied directly to PCR assays without the need to design, synthesize, and optimize fluorescent labeled target-specific probes.\n\n(2) SYBR Green-I detection enabled rapid and adaptable assay design, which was critical given the number of genes required to be analyzed. (3) The use of SYBR Green-I is less expensive than fluorogenic detection probes. (4) Once optimized and confirmed to be specific, SYBR Green-I detection utilizes conventional PCR protocols and primer sets that can be arrayed easily in plates for subsequent analysis. Overall, SYBR Green-I-based detection represented the most adaptable, economical approach for large-scale whole transcriptome analysis of HSV-1 gene expression.\n\nThe success and adaptability of a qPCR assay for HSV-1 gene expression is highly dependent on several factors. First, it is imperative that the qPCR system has the ability to recognize multiple strains of HSV-1 with a high level of specificity for each target gene. In addition, with multiple gene targets on one plate, optimized performance with a single thermal cycling protocol and reaction condition are necessary for utilizing the system as a qPCR array. Lastly, it is essential for the qPCR system to quantify RNA levels accurately across a wide linear range of template concentrations with minimal intra-and inter-assay variability. Critical to these parameters is the initial design and evaluation of primer sets, which were considered carefully for the assays presented in this study. In turn, the final optimized primer sets were selected to be highly specific for their target gene and recognized multiple HSV-1 strains. The absence of significant intra-or inter-assay variation enables plate-to-plate comparisons between results obtained or to provide statistical significance when examining replicate data sets. In short, these assays can be utilized to measure relative changes in HSV-1 gene expression reproducibly and accurately, either as a primary tool for expression analysis or a confirmatory method following microarray or NGS. One intriguing finding was the ability of melting temperature dissociation curve analysis to detect single nucleotide differences within the amplified products of different strains, especially within the TK gene where mutations can result in drug resistance (Coen and Schaffer, 1980; Furman et al, 1981; Coen et al., 1982; Frobert et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007) .\n\nThe applicability of the designed assays was demonstrated by determining the profiles of HSV-1 gene expression kinetics for an array of representative genes from of all HSV-1 transcriptional gene classes. This analysis permitted determination of relative fold changes in each gene across a replicative time course. Since only two reaction conditions were utilized for all designed primer sets, the effects of various conditions can be analyzed on an individual plate the specifies an array of primer sets to most HSV genes, as well as necessary cellular reference genes. Visualization of expression values on a heat map facilitated direct comparison of transcriptional class specific expression profiles. As expected, each transcriptional class exhibited patterns of gene expression that were indicative of their known timing of expression and their roles in HSV-1 replication. Interestingly, the UL2 gene expression pattern did not match other beta genes, but rather exhibited a profile that was reminiscent of the gamma gene class (Fig. 3B ). Re-examination of literature related to assignment of transcriptional class categories for the UL2 gene indicated that this gene could fall within either the beta or gamma gene classes (Pellett and Roizman, 2007; Roizman et al., 2007) . These data highlight the utility of the developed qPCR array to examine genome-wide expression patterns during experimental HSV-1 infection. Foremost, since these compiled primer sets represent the entire HSV-1 lytic transcriptome, these arrays can facilitate experiments that can complement, corroborate, and validate results obtained from contemporary microarray and NGS technologies.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Evaluation of amplification and assay specificity of representative genes from each transcriptional class: RL2/ICP0 (\u03b1 gene: A1, B1, C1); UL23/Thymidine Kinase \u03b2 gene: A2, B2, C2); UL44/gC(\u03b32 gene: A3, B3, C3). Specific amplification of the indicated target genes was assessed by size and purity determination of amplified products on 1.8% TBE agarose gels (A), comparative melt curves of amplified products (B), and relative amplification curves (C). Target specificity and amplification was determined using HSV-1 KOS genomic DNA (HSV-1 genomes; blue lines), cDNA from uninfected cells (uninfected cDNA; green lines), or cDNA from HSV-1 RE infected cells (HSV-1 cDNA; red lines).
