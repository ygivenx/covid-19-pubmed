{"title": "[25] Protein RNA-Binding Activity Measured by Northwestern Blot Analysis\" The Interferon- Inducible RNA-Dependent Protein Kinase PKR", "body": "tance in the antiviral actions of interferon (17) . Activation of PKR requires the presence of a suitable activator RNA and involves the autophosphorylation of PKR. The RNA-binding activity of PKR appears to be selective for structure-specific ssRNAs such as adenovirus VA~ RNA, HIV TAR RNA, and reovirus s l mRNA (18, 19) . Northwestern analysis of substitution and deletion mutant PKR proteins expressed in E. coli as TrpE fusion proteins clearly defined the N-terminal 98 amino acids of PKR as both necessary and sufficient for RNA-binding activity (10, 11) . Furthermore, a repeated subdomain core of 20 amino acid residues, predicted by computer algorithms to be an amphipathic a-helix, was identified within the N-terminal RNAbinding region of PKR. This core sequence, designated motif R, was present at amino acid positions 55-75 and 145-166 of PKR (10) . The RNA-binding R motif is conserved in several viral and cellular proteins from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources, proteins now known to be dsRNA-binding proteins (10, 20) .\n\nWe describe in this article the procedure for analysis of RNA-binding activity by the Northwestern RNA blot assay. The procedure is illustrated with the human RNAdependent protein kinase PKR.\n\nThe strategy for measurement of RNA-binding activity by Northwestern analysis involves immobilization of target proteins on a filter membrane. Proteins fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) are electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter membrane by standard techniques. The fiber-bound proteins are then analyzed for RNA-binding activity using a radioactive RNA probe; this RNA-protein blot analysis constitutes the Northwestern assay. Subsequently, a Western immunoblot analysis is carried out using the same filter membrane as was used for the Northwestern analysis in order to verify that comparable amounts of test proteins were present. The Western analysis is especially important in the cases of proteins that do not register as RNA-binding proteins in the Northwestern assay.\n\nThe chemicals used in the following procedures are of reagent grade. Solutions are prepared with deionized glass-distilled water. The pH of buffers is measured at 25 ~ C.\n\nTris-HC1 (1 M, pH 7.9) Tris-HC1 ( \n\nThe transcription vector construction pSP6Sl(416-576) was previously described (21) . The vector construction pT7TAR was provided courtesy of N. Hernandez (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The P1 KIN cDNA clone of human PKR (22) was used for the construction of the pSV(PKR) (11, 23) and pATH-PKR expression plasmids (10, 11) .\n\nFreshly transformed E. coli C600 cells were used for the expression of the TrpE-PKR fusion proteins essentially as previously described (22, 24) . Colonies were grown at 37~ in 2 ml of minimal medium (24) supplemented with 200/xg/ml am-picillin and 20/~g/ml tryptophan. When the cells were at an optical density of 0.5 measured at 600 nm, a 0.5-ml aliquot of the culture was transferred to a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 5 min at 4 ~ C. The supernatant solution was discarded and the cells were suspended in 3 ml of minimal medium supplemented with 200 ~g/ml ampicillin, but lacking tryptophan. The cells were starved for 3 hr at 37~ in a New Brunswick (New Brunswick, Sci. Co., Edison, NJ) incubator shaker (250 rpm). Indoleacrylic acid (IAA; 5 mg/ml in ethanol) was then added to yield a final concentration of 100 #g/ml, and incubation was continued at 37~ for an additional 3 hr. The IAA-induced cells were collected by centrifugation as above, washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (136 mM NaC1, 2.7 mM KC1, 10 mM Na2 HPO4, and 2 mM KH2 PO4), and then used to prepare cell-free extracts. Both whole-cell lysates and the insoluble fraction were analyzed for the presence of expressed PKR protein product.\n\nTo analyze whole-cell lysates for protein expression, 100/zl of either induced or uninduced cells was pelleted and resuspended in 200 p~l of 1 \u2022 Laemmli buffer (25) . The cell suspension was sonicated (three times for 5 sec each) and then boiled for 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4~ with a microfuge and the supernatant solution was analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide (10%, w/v) gel. Proteins were visualized by staining the gel [0.06% (w/v)Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and 25% (v/v) isopropanol] or by Western analysis.\n\nTo isolate the insoluble proteins, the whole-cell pellets obtained above were resuspended at 4 ~ C in 20 mM Tris-C1 (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaC1, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% (w/ v) NP-40, 5 mM PMSF, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, sonicated (three times for 5 sec each), and microfuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 ~ C. The supernatant solution was removed by aspiration, and the insoluble pellet was then resuspended by sonication in 500 #1 of the extraction buffer [20 mM Tris-C1 (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaC1, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mM PMSF, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol]. This procedure was repeated four times and the final insoluble pellet was then suspended in 500 /~1 of 1 \u2022 Laemmli buffer.\n\nMonkey COS-1 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS. Transfection was by the diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran/ chloroquine phosphate method (26, 27) .\n\nCell-free extracts were prepared from monkey COS cells at 48 hr after transfection with plasmid constructions prepared using the simian virus 40 (SV40)-based pJC119 vector. Transfected monolayer cell cultures (60-mm dishes) were rinsed twice with 1 ml of PBS, and the cells were lysed at 4~ by the addition of 600/~1 of modified NP-40 lysis buffer [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KC1, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSF]. PKR proteins were immunoprecipitated using rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant PKR; immune complexes were collected using formalin-fixed S. aureus cells. Dilutions of the immunoprecipitated PKR proteins were then fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide (10%, w/v) gel and subsequently processed for the Northwestern and Western analyses.\n\nPreparation of RNA Probes 32p-Labeled reovirus s1(416-576) mRNA, adenovirus VA~ RNA, and HIV TAR RNA were prepared as in vitro transcripts with bacteriophage polymerases (28) as previously described (21), except that the standard transcription mixture was modified to contain 40 mM Tris-C1 buffer (pH 7.9), 6 mM MgC12, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM NaC1, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CTP, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.2 mM UTP, [ce-32p]UTP (500 /zCi/ml), 10 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 U/ml RNasin, and 400 U/ml either T7 RNA polymerase or SP6 RNA polymerase as indicated. The vector pSP6S 1(416-576) and SP6 RNA polymerase were used to prepare the reovirus s1(416-576) RNA; the vector pT7VA~ and T7 RNA polymerase were used to prepare adenovirus VAI(1-160) RNA; and the vector pT7TAR and T7 RNA polymerase were used to prepare the HIV TAR(1-82) RNA. Following incubation of the transcription reaction mixture at 37~ (T7 polymerase) or 40~ (SP6 polymerase) for 90 min, RNase-free DNase (5 U) was added and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min at 37 ~ C, after which the reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol-chloroform (1:1) and then chloroform. RNA was chromatographed on a Sephadex (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Sweden) scolumn (G150-40) to further remove unincorporated nucleotides. The amount of RNA synthesized was quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on Whatman (Clifton, NJ) GF/C filter disks; the radioactivity was measured in Aquasol II (DuPont, Boston, MA) with a Beckman LS 1801 liquid scintillation system. The integrity of the RNA was ascertained by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, using formaldehyde-agarose gels and autoradiography (21, 29) .\n\nNorthwestern gel blot analysis for the RNA-binding activity of wild-type and mutant PKR proteins was carried out essentially as described by Boyle and Holmes (1). Briefly, PKR-containing protein samples were fractionated by discontinuous SDSpolyacrylamide slab (1.5 mm thick) gel electrophoresis (25) . Proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose filter membranes at 4 ~ C (> 10 hr at 500 mA) in buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Following transfer the filter membranes were washed with water and enclosed in Seal-a-meal bags containing RNA binding buffer [RBB: 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KC1, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.04% (v/v) Ficoll, 0.04% (v/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.08% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mM EDTA] and 20/zg/ml either human U-cell or E. coli total RNA. The filter membranes were pretreated in RBB containing an RNA blocker at room temperature for 3 hr, with gentle agitation using New Brunswick gyratory shaker G-2. The filters were then incubated at room temperature in RBB with 32p-labeled reovirus s1(416-576) mRNA, 32p-labeled adenovirus RNA, or 32p-labeled HIV TAR RNA as indicated (> 1 \u2022 105 cpm/ml). Following incubation with the probe, the nitrocellulose membrane filters were removed from the Seal-a-meal bags, washed four times with RBB for 30 sec at room temperature, and then air-dried. Autoradiography was carried out with a screen at -80~ using Fuji RX film (Fuju Photo Film Co., Japan).\n\nFor the competition experiments filters were pretreated with RBB lacking U-cell RNA; the competitor RNAs were then added at the same time as the probe. Following incubation with the probe-competitor RNA mixture, the nitrocellulose membrane filters were washed (four times for 30 sec each) in RBB at room temperature and then air-dried. Autoradiography was carried out with a screen at -80 ~ C.\n\nFollowing Northwestern analysis using 32p-labeled TAR RNA or 32p-labeled s 1 (416-576) RNA, the nitrocellulose filters were routinely washed with water for 30 min at room temperature to remove the RNA probe, which was verified by autoradiography. The filter membrane was then subjected to Western analysis using anti-PKR antibody.\n\nWestern immunoblots were performed by the method of Towbin et al. (30) essentially as previously described (31) . Filter membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma Chem. Co.) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 hr. Binding of antibody was performed overnight at 4~ with antiserum diluted 1/750 in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The filters were washed three times for 20 min at room temperature with PBS containing 0.05% (v/ v) Tween 20, then probed with [~25I]protein A diluted 1/5000 in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The filters were then washed (three times for 20 min each) at room temperature with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and air-dried. Autoradiography was then carried out at -80~ with a screen. Western signals detected with [ ~25I]protein A and antibody against PKR correlated with the intensity of staining by Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 of the various TrpE-P1 fusion proteins.\n\nRecombinant PKR protein for RNA gel mobility-shift analysis was prepared from transfected COS cells. COS cells grown as monolayer cultures in 150-mm dishes (Nuclon) with DMEM containing 5% (v/v) FBS were transfected by the DEAEdextran/chloroquine phosphate method using 40/xg of expression vector DNA in 4 ml of serum-free DMEM. Three culture dishes (150 mm) were routinely transfected with each pSV(PKR) expression vector construction; harvest was at 48 hr posttransfection. Monolayer cultures were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS before cell lysis with 3 ml of kinase lysis buffer [containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KC1, 5 mM EDTA, 0.65% (v/v) NP-40, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM PMSF]. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 ~ C. Ribosomes were separated from S 10 extracts and crude 0.8 M ribosome salt-wash fractions were prepared essentially as previously described (32) , except that the A.12 and A.8 buffers were modified to contain 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 120 mM or 800 mM KC1, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM PMSE Eluate fractions from the DEAE-cellulose step containing PKR were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 ~ C until further analysis.\n\nGel mobility-shift analysis (32a) was performed essentially as described by Judware and Petryshyn (33) and Gatignol et al. (9) . The final reaction volume (10/zl) contained approximately 1 ng of the recombinant PKR protein and varying concentrations of 32p-labeled probe RNA (specific activity, > 1 X 107 cpm/pmol) in 15 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.8), 70 mM NaC1, 10 mM KC1, 1 mM EDTA, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 ng of ovalbumin, 2 U of RNasin, and 10 ng of yeast total RNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before loading onto a native acrylamide (10%) gel (80:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide) in 0.5 \u2022 Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The gel was prerun at 4~ for over 1 hr at 200 V; 40/xl of 2% (v/v) glycerol solution was added to the wells prior to loading the samples. A dye mixture containing 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol was loaded on the outside lanes of the gel. Electrophoresis was conducted at 280 V for 5 hr or until the xylene cyanol dye was approximately 3 cm from the bottom of the gel. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography.\n\nThe Northwestern assay is an effective approach both for identifying RNA-binding proteins and for characterizing the subdomain regions within them necessary for RNA-binding activity. The procedures described here for analysis of protein RNAbinding activity measured by the Northwestern blot assay have been used in our laboratory to identify the RNA-binding domain within the interferon-inducible RNAdependent protein kinase PKR from human cells (10, 11) .\n\nThe availability of cDNA clones of the PKR kinase provided an opportunity to elucidate the region of PKR responsible for its RNA-binding activity. As an approach to determining the residues of PKR necessary and sufficient for RNA-binding activity, deletion mutants of the P1 KIN cDNA encoding PKR were expressed in E. coli as TrpE-P1 fusion proteins (10, 22) . The strategy was to determine whether a contiguous subdomain region expressed from the PKR cDNA could convert the bacterial TrpE protein (24) into an RNA-binding protein (10) . A similar strategy involving TrpE fusion proteins was also used to characterize the binding of hepatitis delta antigen to HDV RNA (2) .\n\nTrpE-P1 fusion proteins of PKR were examined at varying protein concentrations, as measured by Western immunoblot analysis, for their ability to bind 32p_ labeled reovirus s1(415-576) RNA. Reovirus s1(416-576) RNA is known to activate the autophosphorylation of PKR (21) , and thus was presumed to bind PKR. As shown by Fig. 1, 32p -labeled reovirus s 1 RNA selectively bound to TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that included the N-terminal region of PKR. The TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that possessed PKR amino acid residues 1-98, 1-372, or 1-413, when immobilized on nitrocellulose, all bound the 32p-labeled reovirus s l RNA probe. By contrast, TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that lacked the N-terminal 98 amino acid residues but included either the internal or C-terminal regions of PKR or amino acids 91-367 or 414-551, respectively, did not bind the reovirus sl activator RNA (Fig. 1) . In the case of HDV, the middle one third of delta antigen expressed as TrpE fusion was necessary and sufficient for binding of HDV RNA in the Northwestern RNA blot assay (2) . The specificity of RNA-binding detected by Northwestern RNA blot assay can be assessed by the use of competitor RNAs. For example, in the case of PKR, the binding of the 32p-labeled reovirus s1(416-576) RNA to TrpE-Pl(1-98) was competed by poly(rI)-poly(rC) but was not competed by total RNA isolated from human U cells (10) .\n\nAs shown by Fig. 2 , both adenovirus VAI RNA, an antagonist of PKR kinase activation (34, 35) and HIV TAR RNA, described as both an agonist (36, 37) and an antagonist (38) of the PKR kinase, bound to the same region of PKR, as did the reovirus s1(416-576) RNA, an activator of the kinase (21) . Adenovirus VAI RNA, HIV TAR RNA, and reovirus s 1 RNA all bound to the TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that included the N-terminal 98 residues of PKR, whereas none of the RNAs bound to the TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that lacked the N-terminal region of PKR. Finally, the TrpE portion of the fusion protein expressed from vector alone without PKR insert did not bind RNA.\n\nThe RNA-binding activity of PKR measured by Northwestern analysis maps to the N-terminal half of PKR within a region that includes the repeated subdomain R motif, the core of which is about 20 amino acids (10) . The R motif first identified in human PKR is conserved in many other RNA-binding proteins, is often repeated, and represents the prototype for a new RNA-binding motif with the consensus sequence G-X-G-S/T-K-X-X-A/S-K-X-X-A-A-X-X-A-X-X-X-L (10, 17, 20) . Among the most highly conserved residues of the core R motif is a lysine residue, present at amino acid position 64 within the N-terminal proximal copy of R in PKR (10) . In order to assess the importance of the conserved core motif R in the RNAbinding activity of human PKR, lysine-64 was converted to glutamic acid by site- directed mutagenesis (11) . Serial dilutions of TrpE fused with the N-terminal 98 amino acids of PKR, either wild-type (Wt) PKR or the K64E substitution mutant, were first analyzed by the Northwestern assay. Although the TrpE-Wt(1-98) fusion protein efficiently bound RNA (Fig. 3, lanes 1-5) , the K64E substitution mutant protein TrpE-K64E(1-98) did not bind RNA, even at concentrations at least 20-fold higher than those of the TrpE-Wt(1-98) protein (Fig. 3, lanes 6-10) . The TrpE-Wt(91-367) fusion protein lacking the N-proximal copy of R, but retaining the more C-terminal variant repeat of the R motif, likewise was unable to bind RNA as measured by the Northwestern assay (Fig. 3) . The TrpE-Wt(1-372) fusion protein that included both copies of the core motif R efficiently bound RNA (Fig. 3, lane 16) . These results suggest that the N-proximal copy of the R motif is both necessary and sufficient to confer RNA-binding activity to TrpE as measured by the Northwestern assay. This result was confirmed by gel-mobility shift analysis of the full-length 551amino-acid PKR protein (Fig. 4 ). The full-length catalytic subdomain II K296R(1-551) mutant, which lacks kinase catalytic activity (23, 39) , bound 32p-labeled adenovirus VAI RNA in the gel mobilityshift assay (Fig. 4, lane 2) , whereas the ability of the K64E/K296R(1-551) double mutant to bind RNA was greatly diminished (Fig. 4, lane 4) . Thus, the K64E substitution was sufficient to severely impair RNA-binding activity of the PKR protein, measured both by the Northwestern assay using truncated PKR TrpE fusion protein immobilized on nitrocellulose (Fig. 3) and by the gel mobility-shift assay with fulllength PKR protein in solution (Fig. 4) .\n\nThe Northwestern blot assay may also be utilized to analyze the RNA-binding activity of proteins present in the crude extracts prepared from mammalian cells. This is exemplified by the results shown in Fig. 5 . PKR proteins isolated by quantitative immunoprecipitation from extracts of vector-transfected COS cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to sequential Northwestern and Western blot analyses. The same nitrocellulose filter blot was first used to measure the RNA-binding activity of PKR proteins by Northwestern RNA blot analysis with 32p-labeled RNA probe; then, after removal of the RNA probe, the amount of PKR protein present on the filter membrane was quantitated by Western analysis with [~25I]protein A and polyclonal antibody probe against PKR. . However, because RNA-binding activity as measured by the Northwestern assay is sensitive to pH, false-positive responses may occur at pH below 6.5 (8) . Also, because the candidate target proteins first are resolved by SDS-PAGE, the Northwestern assay may not be suitable for proteins whose RNA-binding activity depends on a dimeric structure, particularly a heterodimeric structure in which the two subunits possess different mobilities in SDS-PAGE gels. Therefore, it is important to attempt to confirm RNA-binding results obtained by the Northwestern RNA blot assay with results obtained by a second independent approach, for example, the gel mobility-shift assay (32a)."}
