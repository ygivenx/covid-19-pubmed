Furthermore, it is now known that camels are the natural reservoir for MERS-CoV, and viruses that are associated with farm animals, such as camels, tend to have greater fecal-oral transmission potentials 9 .\n\nIn this study, we will have the opportunity to once again test the model. This time, it will involve the SARS-CoV-2. We shall see that not only the model is reliable and consistent, but is able to detect something very odd about this virus that could account for its quick spread.\n\nProtein intrinsic disorder is found when portions of or an entire protein has no structure. It is also called by other names such as unstructured, natively unfolded 10-12 . The main tool used to develop the CoVs shell disorder model involves the use of neural networks that had been trained to recognize ordered and disordered regions of a protein given its sequence. A suite of such artificial intelligence tools (AI) have been named PONDR \u00ae (http://www.pondr.com).\n\nOf a particular interest. PONDR \u00ae VLXT has been found to be accurate for structural proteins with protein-protein and protein-RNA/DNA interactions 13-17 . In fact, PONDR \u00ae VLXT has shown consistency and reproducibility when used for the study of structural viral shells that protect the virion from environmental damage. A wide range of viruses have been studied using PONDR \u00ae \n\nThe coronavirus virion contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein 5-7,28,-30 . These proteins are needed for production of a structurally complete viral particle 30-33 . The main focus of our intrinsic disorder-based model is at the viral M and N proteins. The M protein of CoV was chosen over the E protein because the M protein is a major transmembrane protein that is found in large numbers in the virion, whereas E protein is a minor protein of the envelope. Also, in previous studies, membrane or matrix proteins of various viruses were analysed with respect to their intrinsic disorder content and roles in protecting the respective virions. The N protein is also important for our model, as it has been shown that greater disorder in the inner shell is associated with the mode of infection and virulence in other viruses 23-26 .\n\nThe protein sequences of the selected CoV M and N proteins were downloaded from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org) The sequences were fed into a MYSQL database using JAVA 19 .\n\nThe sequences were fed into the PONDR \u00ae VLXT, and the corresponding results were archived in the database. PONDR \u00ae VLXT provides intrinsic disorder predisposition scores for each residue.\n\nResidues with the scores of 0.5 and above are considered disordered, and, conversely, residues with the scores below 0.5 are taken as ordered. We represented the outputs of these analyses in the form of the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered divided by the total number of residues in a query protein. Statistical analyses using regression analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were done using R statistical package 34 .\n\nRegression analyses were done using category as the dependent variable with M and N PIDs as independent variables or N PID as a sole independent variable. Categories were assigned the values of 1, 2 and 3 to the three groups as according to the level of respiratory transmission potential. The amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 M and N proteins are available at NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947).\n\nAs aforementioned, the model predicting the mode of viral transmission was built before the 2012 MERS-CoV outbreak . This model was based on the analysis of mainly the PIDs found for N proteins, the viruses were clustered into three groups according to their transmission mode, while the M PIDs provide an indicator of resilience of the virus in the harsh environment. The three groups are represented in the Furthermore, a higher inner shell disorder is often associated with the greater infectivity, especially with regard to respiratory transmission potential since disorder allows greater promiscuity of binding 6,7 . Table 1 shows that SARS-CoV is grouped into category B along with other viruses that have intermediate respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. MERS-CoV falls into category C (lower respiratory potential but higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities). These are consistent with what we know about transmission behaviour of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 5-8, 35 . It should be noted that category A are viruses with N PID above 53%, whereas category C comprises of those with N PID below 47%. Since SARS-CoV-2 has an N PID of 48%, which is above 46% but below 54%, it must be considered as being in category B.\n\nAs already mentioned, based on the similar analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%), it is clear that this virus has to be placed in Category B, along with SARS-CoV (Table 1) .\n\nHowever, our data also pointed to something odd about the SARS-CoV-2. In fact, Table 1 and Figure 1 show that data for the SARS-CoV-2, the M PID is 6%, which is second lowest in our sample of a fairly diverse selection of CoVs. This means that the SARS CoV-2 has one of the hardest outer shells among its counterparts.\n\nThe model is consistent with the theme that viruses that remain in harsh environments require harder; i.e., less disordered, shells to survive. Furthermore, the outer shell is likely to play an even greater role in protecting the virion 20,22,27 . This has important implications pertaining to the characteristics and behaviors of the virus as we shall see below.\n\nA superficial glance at the model that places SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the same category, with intermediate levels of respiratory transmission potentials may mislead the reader to believe that the model is not reliable, given the fact that we have now seen that SARS-CoV-2 is much more contagious than SARS-CoV. We believe that this is not the case. If SARS-CoV-2 would be placed in category C, the same category as MERS-CoV, then the model would be definitely wrong in terms of reproducibility. On the other hand, the placing of SARS-COV-2 in category A would be an inconsistency that would be difficult to explain. One would further notice that very few CoVs fall into category A, with the exception for HCoV-229E and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which make the chance of any CoVs including SARS-COV-2, to be in category A slim. More importantly, because SARS-CoV-2 is zoonotic and the only non-human CoV in category A is the avian IBV, placing SARS-COV-2 in category A could suggest that this virus is likely to be of avian origin, which is inconsistent with what we know about SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic study has confirmed that the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are bat CoVs 4, 36 . We also noticed that at least three of closest neighbors with similar N PIDs of 47-48% are those of bat origin (See Table 1 ). This suggests that bat CoVs are likely to have an optimal mix of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission potentials that reflect their N PID range of 47-48%, which provides for greater fitness for the spread of the viruses among bats and that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be of bat origin too given its N PID is 48%. There are highly debatable suggestions that snakes or pangolins 3,37,38 may be an intermediary host of the virus. Even if any of these is later deemed as true, our data imply that the virus had not the chance to evolved much with any intermediary host except bats, unlike the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the model does suggest that they had evolved with hosts such as civet cats and camels respectively. This suggestion is, however, based on N PID alone.\n\nThe CoV shell disorder model was originally conceived as part of a spin-off from a parent research project that studied relationships among the mode of transmission, shell disorder and the absence of Using what was then known about behaviors of porcine CoVs, a successful attempt to correlate M and N PIDs to modes of transmission was made 5,6 . The results were similar to those found in Table   1 and Figure 1 without the data pertaining to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, of course, since the MERS-CoV and COVID-19 outbreaks had yet to occur then.\n\nEvidence of a strong correlation of M and N PIDs to the mode of transmission ( r 2 = 0.83, p< 0.001) can be seen in the regression analysis. Furthermore, a strong but oddly weaker correlation ( r 2 = 0.77, p< 0.001) can also be found when N PID is the sole independent variable even if poor correlation ( r 2 = 0.21) is found when M PID is the sole independent variable. This basically means that the model should include both M and N PIDs as the statistical model seems to suggest that M PID does contribute, even if slightly, to the mode of transmission in conjunction to the major contribution by N PID. .This is consistent with the idea that both M and N play roles in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on mode of transmission. A qualitative inspection of the viruses in the three groups also reveals consistency. For example, as in Table 1 , canine CoV-respiratory falls into category B, while canine CoV-enteritis is in category C. The porcine CoVs are also consistent with observation of their behaviors as we will later see.\n\nWe need to keep in mind, however, that the outer shell is likely to play a greater and more \n\nThe mechanism in which the virus acquires greater virulence via inner shell disorder arises from the ability of the viral protein to bind promiscuously to the host protein 6,23-26 . This ability provides for rapid replication of the viral viral proteins and particles. This quick replication is also an efficient way to evade the host immune system by reproducing a large number of viral particles before the immune system even recognizes the virus,, which then often goes on to overwhelm the body leading to the death of the host 6,23-26 . One highly plausible explanation for the link between rapid replication and the modes of transmission is that viral load in the body fluids of the infected host needs to be sufficiently high before the virus can be infectious via the respiratory mode. This therefore explains the fact that rapid viral replication and inner shell disorder were found to be the common link between virulence and respiratory transmission in the case of Nipah virus 26 .\n\nWe don't, however, know if there is correlation between CoV virulence and inner shell disorder, even though the authors believe it exists, just like the other viruses. If so, N will make an excellent target for CoV vaccine development.The difficulty in the search for such links is that CoVs infect a large variety of animals and each CoV often uses a different receptor 4,,6,39 . For example, MERS-CoV has a case-fatality rate of above 30% 8 for humans but is generally harmless to camels 27 . Furthermore, CoVs were generally not known to be virulent before the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak and therefore lack adequate data for us to work with.\n\nThe reason that we can make the necessary above-mentioned extrapolations pertaining to inner shell disorder among unrelated viruses with somewhat greater confidence is that inner shell \n\nSince both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have intermediate respiratory transmission potentials, how do we account for the greater contagiousness of the latter? We need to understand that the respiratory transmission potential of a single viral particle is just one of several factors that might contribute to the contagiousness of the virus. Other factors include how many particles are released by the host and how long does the particle remain in the environment. We mentioned that our model has detected something odd about SARS-COV-2: this virus has one of the hardest outer shell within the family as seen in Figure 1 and Table 1 (M PID = 6 %). Since the outer shell plays the greater role in protecting the virion in comparison to the inner shell, the harder outer shell provides virus greater resilience to outside the body environment and to the presence of digestive enzymes found in the saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids 20,22,42-46 . As a result, the virus with the harder outer shell is able to remain active for a longer time and, therefore a lesser number of viral particles is required for a chance to infect someone. Furthermore, because the virus is more resistant to the digestive enzymes in the bodily fluids, an infected body is likely to discharged more infectious particles.\n\nEvidence of the protective role of the outer shells be seen in a wide variety of viruses.\n\nViruses associated with saliva (e.g., YFV, ZIKV, EIAV, rabies) or fecal-oral transmission (e.g., poliovirus), have hard outer shells with low PID, whereas sexually transmitted viruses (e.g., HIV, HSV-2, HCV) have higher outer shell PIDs 6, 20-27 . Also, viruses that are notorious for lasting in the environment for a long time such, as the smallpox virus, have low outer shell PIDs.\n\nBefore the SARS-CoV outbreak, coronaviruses were not considered medically important, as, in the past, they had been primarily associated with cold viruses that cause minor sniffles. This is, however, not true in the field of veterinary medicine, where coronaviruses have posed a menace to livestock. This is especially so in the case of TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus). TGEV could move rapidly among farm pigs to quickly devastate the farming community if not controlled early 5-7 . Our analysis reveals that TGEV is of category C (higher fecal-oral, lower respiratory transmission potentials) with M and N PIDs at 14% and 43% respectively. The reason that it is able to move rapidly is that its high fecal-oral transmission potential represents a more efficient mode of transmission among the farm animals.\n\nThere is an antigenically related cousin, PEDV, which has similar characteristics as TGEV 29 . Like TGEV, diarrhea and vomiting are main symptoms of PEDV infection. While TGEV is highly infectious, PEDV is less contagious among farm pigs. A peculiar characteristic has been observed by farmers and veterinarians: PEDV can reappear out of nowhere from within the same pen that was previously occupied by infected pigs, even after the disease has passed on several months ago.\n\nAn inspection of the M and N PIDs reveals the reason showing that PEDV belongs to the category B, along with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, unlike TGEV and MERS-CoV. This means that PEDV has a higher respiratory transmission potential than TGEV and that implies greater chances of fecalrespiratory transmission for the former. Obviously, viral particles in fecal materials that was somehow inadvertently left behind go on to infect a new population of pigs several months later 5-7 .\n\nInfectious droplets from mucus, vomit, or feces have actually been seen during the SARS-CoV outbreak. A stark example happened in a 2003 outbreak at Amoy Gardens, a housing complex in Hong Kong, where a huge cluster of infected patients was found and the inefficient sewerage and toilet ventilation systems were responsible for the spread 5,35,47 . We need to be reminded that PEDV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are all under the same category B, and that SARS-CoV-2 has the hardest outer shell within the entire CoV family.SARS-CoV-2 is thus likely to be able remain infectious in the environment for the longest time regardless of being in feces, mucus, vomit, sweat, or saliva.\n\nA puzzling thing can be observed is when we notice that PEDV (M PID=8%) has a harder outer shell than TGEV (M PID=14%), given that TGEV is predicted as having higher fecal-oral transmission potential. We would think that having greater fecal-oral potential requires harder outer shell among CoVs. Apparently, the result is implying that this is not necessarily true, as we have seen, and having higher fecal-oral transmission potential can actually provide greater efficiency in the spread among farm animals, as we have seen in TGEV, such that the virus does not have to stay long outside the body. The ability to stay longer in the environment could, however, provide advantages to a virus with greater respiratory transmission potential, especially with respect to spread via airborne virus from feces or body fluids. This is likely the case for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nWe have presented here a set of data that not only place the SARS-CoV-2 within the category of Higher Levels of Fecaloral Transmission a M PID refers to the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the membrane protein (M). PID is measured by the number of residues predicted to be disordered divided by the total number of disorder. M PID predicts how long the virus can remain outside the body. M is considered to be one of the outer shell. b N protein refers to the nucleocapsid protein, which is an inner shell protein, c SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) d Genbank accession code, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947 * This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva, other bodily fluids and outside the body.\n\n* An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer.\n\nThese factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread."}
