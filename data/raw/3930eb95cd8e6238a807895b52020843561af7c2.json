These codons are organism specific codons because different organisms have different tRNA gene compositions. For example, 13 amino acid-encoding codons have no cognate tRNA genes in the human genome. Studies have revealed by ribosomal profiling experiments that translation of codons by rare tRNAs and non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs (by wobble base pairing of codons and tRNAs) reduces translation efficiency 2,3, . 4 Moreover, it has been reported that the efficiency of translating a particular codon is affected by the nature of the immediately adjacent codons. 5, 6 Two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Conversely, coding sequences (CDSs) with low composition of slow codons and slow dicodons may possess fast translation rates.\n\nTranslation of viral proteins is completely dependent on the translation machinery of host cells. Therefore, the proportions of host-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral CDSs can be used to predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different viruses of different genera, serotypes, and strains.\n\nIn this study, compositions of human slow codon and slow di-codon in genomes of coronaviruses isolated from human hosts were analyzed to evaluate the differences of translation efficiency of viral proteins in the human host cells.\n\nThe CDSs of 590 coronavirus complete (full-length) genomes isolated from human hosts (25 human coronavirus 229 E (HCoV-229 E), 60 human Coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), 39 human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), 139 human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), 42 Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 123 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), 34 Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (2019-nCoV)) and 128 unclassified coronaviruses (Other) were retrieved from the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR, https://www.viprbrc. org/) 7 and analyzed in this study. The information of tRNA genes in the human genome were obtained from the Genomic tRNA Database (GtRNAdb, http://gtrnadb.ucsc. edu/). 1 \n\nwhere N C is the number of human slow codons present in each viral CDS. L is the total number of codons of each viral CDS (length of the amino acid sequence). n is the number of CDSs in a coronavirus genome. The proportion of human slow di-codons DiC was computed by the formula. 2\n\nwhere N DC is the number of human slow di-codons present in each viral CDS. L is the total number of codons of each viral CDS (length of the amino acid sequence). n is the number of CDSs in a coronavirus genome. Both of the ranges of Ct and DiC are between 0 and 1. Data manipulation, processing and codon counting were performed using Python scripts written by the author. The heatmap, scatter plots and distributions of Ct and DiC values were plotted using the ggplot2 package in R (the R package for statistical computing). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Clustal X 2.0 software. 8\n\nIn total, CDSs of 590 coronavirus complete genomes were collected from 8 coronavirus groups (229 E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 and unclassified) which can infect the human hosts. According to variations of codon compositions, the HKU1 and SARS were divided into 2 subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomic sequences of the representative coronavirus from each group is shown in Fig. 1A . Analysis results of the genetic codon compositions of 8 coronavirus groups (and subgroups) infect humans are shown in Fig. 1B . Comparison of Fig. 1A and B shows that the analysis based on the phylogenetic tree and viral genetic codon compositions are not completely consistent. For example, although NL63 and HKU1 belong to alpha and beta coronaviruses, respectively, they exhibit similar codon compositions. These results indicate that the analysis of genetic codon composition provides novel information that cannot be revealed in the phylogenetic analysis. It is interesting that the codon compositions of The distribution of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons in the coding sequences from 590 coronaviruses isolated from human hosts is shown in Fig. 2 . The order of overall proportions of human slow codons and slow di-codons is SARS2 < SARS1 < SARS-CoV-2 < unclassified y MERS < HKU1_2 y 229 E < OC43 < HKU1_1 < NL63. These results indicate that the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV may have higher protein synthetic rates than other coronavirus groups which infect humans. Herfst et al. 11 propose a set of drivers facilitating human-to-human transmission of airborne pathogens with the aerosols and droplets as mediators in airspace between individuals (Fig. 4) . First, the airborne pathogens are carried with aerosols, droplets, or particulate matter, such as PM2.5, and transported through the air from donor to recipient. Second, airborne pathogens usually exhibit a relatively low 50% infectious dose (ID50) value. A low concentration of pathogens is sufficient for infection in the respiratory tract of the recipients. Third, after infection of susceptible cells, pathogens may amplify at the site of deposition or are disseminated from the primary deposition site to peripheral tissues (secondary site), where additional amplification takes place. Fourth, eventually, the recipient becomes the donor, and pathogens are expelled from the exit site (usually the respiratory tract). High infectious loads of the pathogens re-emerge in the air to complete the transmission cycle. According to the 4 steps, viruses with high protein synthesis rates (as a consequence, replication rates) have great advantages to increase transmissibility. Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons 5\n\nFirst, fast-replication viruses can produce aerosols, droplets, or particulate matter with high viral loads that increase the remaining percentage of surviving viruses in environments before reaching the recipients. Second, after viruses reach the recipients, the fast replication viruses have a higher chance of successful infection even the initial when infection dose is low. The finding of this study provides an explanation other than virus-host receptor interactions for fast transmissibility of 2019-nCoV. High transmissibility does not necessarily result in high fatality. Data has shown that the order of transmissibility is 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV > MERS-CoV > other coronaviruses infect humans.\n\nIn conclusion, conventional phylogenetic analysis of viral genomic sequences is useful for tracking the origin of viruses. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon composition provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of viral protein synthesis in host cells for prediction and surveillance of transmission potential of emerging novel viruses.
