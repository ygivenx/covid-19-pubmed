{"title": "Corresponding author(s): Experimental design 1. Sample size", "body": "Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity.\n\nFor further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist.\n\nPlease do not complete any field with \"not applicable\" or n/a. Refer to the help text for what text to use if an item is not relevant to your study. For final submission: please carefully check your responses for accuracy; you will not be able to make changes later.\n\nExperimental design 1. Sample size Describe how sample size was determined.\n\nWith baseline carriage rates of 50% (expected based on prior data from our model), 73 participants in each arm were required for 80% power to detect a 50% relative increase in pneumococcal acquisition at any time point, after 10% drop-out.\n\nDescribe any data exclusions.\n\nOf 130 vaccinated volunteers, five were natural pneumococcal carriers (two in LAIV arm and three in control arm) and were excluded from further analysis. Another 8 subjects in the LAIV arm were excluded following a systematic LAIV dispensing error by a single practitioner, as recommended by the trial steering group. This resulted in a final 55 subjects analysed in the LAIV arm and 62 subjects in the control arm.\n\nDescribe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility of the experimental findings.\n\nKey findings, including monocyte recruitment to the nasopharynx were validated in an independent patient cohort. All attempts are replication findings were successful.\n\nDescribe how samples/organisms/participants were allocated into experimental groups.\n\nUsing a permuted-block algorithm (1:1, blocks of 10) held in sealed envelopes, participants were randomised to receive either nasal LAIV (Fluenz Tetra or FluMist Tetra, AstraZeneca, UK, used interchangeably due to procurement shortages) paired with intramuscular placebo (0.5ml normal saline), or nasal placebo [control] (0.2ml normal saline) paired with intramuscular Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccination (Fluarix Tetra, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) (see supplemental methods for flu strains).\n\nDescribe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.\n\nThis was a double-blinded, randomized trial where investigators were blinded during data collection and data analysis Note: all in vivo studies must report how sample size was determined and whether blinding and randomization were used.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nFor all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or in the Methods section if additional space is needed).\n\nThe exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.) A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated\n\nThe statistical test(s) used and whether they are one-or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.\n\nA description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons\n\nProvide confidence intervals or give results of significance tests (e.g. P values) as exact values whenever appropriate and with effect sizes noted.\n\nA clear description of statistics including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)\n\nSee the web collection on statistics for biologists for further resources and guidance.\n\nPolicy information about availability of computer code\n\nDescribe the software used to analyze the data in this study. .0a was used to align RNA-Seq read featureCounts v1.5.2 was used to extract numbers of mapped reads from aligned RNAseq data FastQC v0.11.5 was used for RNA-Seq QC analysis MultiQC v1.1 was used for RNA-Seq QC analysis Flowjo v10 was used for analysing flow cytometry data\n\nThe following R packages were used: DESeq2 v1.14.1 was used to perform differential gene expression analysis from Nanostring and RNA-Seq data Cemitool v0.99.9 was used for co-expression analysis from gene expression data For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the paper but not yet described in the published literature, software must be made available to editors and reviewers upon request. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Nature Methods guidance for providing algorithms and software for publication provides further information on this topic.\n\nPolicy information about availability of materials 8. Materials availability Indicate whether there are restrictions on availability of unique materials or if these materials are only available for distribution by a third party.\n\nNo unique materials were developed or used for this study 9. Antibodies Describe the antibodies used and how they were validated for use in the system under study (i.e. assay and species). The volunteers were healthy young adults"}
