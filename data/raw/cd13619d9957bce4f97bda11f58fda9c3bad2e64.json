{"title": "", "body": "To the Editor:\n\nIt has been shown that printed media (newspapers, magazines, etc) may contain significant quantities of lead? Various paper products currently available, notably towels or napkins, are often made from recycled paper. The companies who manufacture such products use deinking processes to clean and bleach the recycled materials. 2 The resultant product may still contain troublesome amounts of lead.\n\nFailure to recognize this problem can yield erroneous values for blood lead when paper towels are used as directed in instructions given for screening for microsampling techniques: \"after the patient's hand is washed, the helper wraps damp paper towel over the patient's hand and delivers the patient to the site of collection. ' '3 Recently, we observed what appeared to be inordinately high values for blood lead in children who were asymptomatic, and in whom free erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels were too often inconsistent with their blood lead levels. The appearance of unexpectedly high values of blood lead coincided with the change in paper towelling used in following the above cited directions. Analysis of the older towelling (115 towel, Scott Paper Co., Lyndhurst, N J) indicated that it contained 1/5 of the lead content of the newer towelling (Professional Service Towels, Marcal Paper Mills, Elmwood Park, N J). The latter was made from 60% \"high quality\" recycled material.\n\nThe Marcal towel contained approximately 5 ppm lead. Normal blood lead values are in the range of less .then 0.4 ppm (40 #g/dl). It is easy to suspect that some lead from the paper could be transferred to the finger, thus giving spuriously high \n\nTo the Editor.\" Wu and associates 1 have suggested that more adequate supportive therapy of the newborn infant during phototherapy could limit eventual alterations of growth. The authors studied growth during the first four weeks of life in controlled and in treated subjects. The phototherapy groups showed decreased growth See related article, p. 92.\n\nduring the first week and greater weight gain in weeks two and three as compared to the control group.\n\nWe have studied 90 low-birth-weight newborn infants randomly assigned to the following groups: control (no therapy except exchange transfusion); continuous phototherapy (96\n\nLetters to the Editor 1 6 5 Number 1 hours of continuous treatment from the first to the fifth day); intermittent phototherapy (72 hours of treatment alternating 12 hours of therapy and 12 hours without phototherapy from the first to the seventh day). Phototherapy treatment was provided with Air Shield phototherapy units using vita light. The groups are similar for sex, gestational age (controls: 32.4 _+ 2.7 weeks; intermittent phototherapy: 34.5 _+ 2.9; continuous pnotomerapy: ~,r _+ z.,~ weeKs), ana mrm wmgnt. &u Ol the newborn infants were placed in incubators (Air Shield Model Isolette C 86) with the same environmental conditions of temperature (according to Scopes and Ahmed ~) and humidity (40 to 60%); they received the same amount of fluids and calories per kilogram per day for the period of study. Table I shows the growth data of the three groups during the first four weeks of life.\n\nDuring the first week we found a uniform weight loss in all three groups; during the second week the weight gain was significantly greater in the control than in the treated infants. In the third and the fourth week growth was similar in the three groups. We did not find any significant difference in the growth of the head circumference.\n\nPhototherapy was efficacious in preventing hyperbilirubinemia, the continuous treatment more so than the intermittent phototherapy.\n\nAlthough Wu and associates maintain that the phototherapy might induce a catabolism and a less marked increase of growth followed by a catch-up in growth during the second and third weeks, our results do not support this hypothesis. We observed variations in growth during the second week of life; all subjects increased their weight, but the control infants had a significantly greater weight gain. We believe that the growth variations in treated subjects could be related to metabolic alterations more complicated than those proposed and may represent untoward effects of the light. Kunin, two groups (panels) of the cognoscenti evaluated oral penicillin-sulfa fixed combinations. Their unanimous conclusion, as we well know, was that all these \"combinations are ineffective as fixed combinations.

If the umbrella of ampicillin is watertight, so much the better, but if large leaks occur we will need better protection against Hemophilus otitis media.\n\nIt will be said that two prescriptions are just as easy to write as one. The penicillin-sulfa-fixed combination or the erythromycinsulfa-fixed combination are two examples of combinations in which the dose of penicillin or erythromycin is easy to calculate with the mg/kg dose of sulfisoxazole in the same container. It would seem that the lesser cost in having one prescription to write and fill and the likelihood of increased parental compliance in administration of one drug rather than two may outweigh any theoretical disadvantages.\n\nWith the recent approval of the sulfimethoxazole/trimethoprim combination for treating chronic urinary tract infection even for infants above two months of age, it seems that the \"box\""}
