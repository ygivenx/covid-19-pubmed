{"title": "", "body": "Mephitinae. The family Mustelidae currently includes 25 recent genera and approximately 67 species of terrestrial carnivores or piscivores inhabiting all continents except Australia and Antarctica and are also absent in New Guinea, Madagascar and Antarctica. They have been introduced into New Zealand. In the course of evolution, several behavioral adaptations and many physical features have developed, as some species live mainly in the ground (stoat, weasel, polecat) or even partially underground (badger), whereas others are active also above the ground in trees (pine marten). Some have selected marine or fresh water as their preferred habitats most or part of the time (mink, river otter, sea otter).\n\nIncluded in this family are the smallest living carnivore, the common or least weasel, and the largest representatives, the giant and sea otters in water and the wolverine on land. Mustelid body weights range from under 70 grams (g) (least weasel at 19 centimeters [cm] long) to 45 kg (sea otter at 190 cm long).\n\nThe family Mustelidae includes five subfamilies. The weasel-like carnivores (Mustelinae) represent the group with the greatest number of species, comprising 10 genera with approximately 33 species including weasels (11 species), polecats (3 species), minks (2 species), grison (1 species), and wolverine (1 species). The subfamily Mellivorinae is represented by only a single species, the honey badger or ratel (Mellivora capensis). Subfamily Melinae includes five genera in eight species of badgers represented in Africa, Asia, South America, or wide ranges of northern Eurasia and North America. Skunks (subfamily Mephitinae, recently elevated to Family Mephitidae) are exclusively common in North America. Otters (subfamily Lutrinae) are small to large forms that show the most highly developed adaptations to marine life of all mustelids. They lead an amphibious life and feed mainly on fish or crustaceans. Most mammologists recognize four genera and 13 species. 30 Most mustelids have a highly flexible spinal column; the limbs are comparatively short, ending in feet with five digits, and they walk either digitigrade or plantigrade. The claws are not (or only partly) retractable. Mustelids lack the clavicle and cecum. They present the typical carnivore dentition with number of teeth varying from 28 to 40. Developed canine (C) teeth are always present and the last premolar (P) in the upper jaw and the first molar (M) in the lower jaw jointly form the \"crushing shears\" for processing food. The dental formula of weasels is incisors (I) 3/3, C 1/1, P 3/3, M 1/2 on the upper and lower jaws. In the wolverine the formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 1/2 upper and lower. Eurasian badger formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 1/2 upper and lower, and in the members of the Lutra and Lontra genera the formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, P 3-4/3, M 1/2 upper and lower. The pine marten has a dental formula of I 3/3, C 2/1, P 4/4, M 1/2 upper and lower (40 teeth total), which is different from that of other mustelids. Glands may be located in various regions of the body surface. The paired anal glands produce odorous secretions characteristic of the species and used for marking their habitat, sometimes for generations. Some species may spray these secretions over long distances as a method to discourage or harm enemies.\n\nIn otters, the mandibular salivary glands and lymph nodes lie in the angle of the mandible, whereas the retropharyngeal nodes lie dorsolateral and slightly caudal to the larynx. The thyroid glands of otters are also different from those of other mustelids in that they are long, flat, and tapering, with no isthmus, and closely attached to the trachea. The heart of otters is usually globular with a thick-walled left ventricle and a thin-walled right ventricle. The shape of the heart and thickness of the ventricles should not be confused with ventricular hypertrophy. Otters have a seven-lobed liver. A common hepatic and cystic bile duct joins the duodenum adjacent to the pancreatic duct. The kidneys of otters, like those of cows and cetaceans, are multilobulated. The lungs of otters and badgers are composed of two lobes on the left, three lobes on the right, and an intermediate lobe where the right bronchus terminates. 5, 15 Mustelids are predominantly solitary, sexually dimorphic mammals (males are 25% larger than females). Smaller mustelid species have high metabolic rates. Males and females come together only during the reproductive period, and social communities generally include the mother and offspring. \n\nThe family Mustelidae contains numerous fully terrestrial species, two that are semi-aquatic (minks), and a number that are amphibious to fully aquatic (the Lutrinae). The latter have adaptations for the aquatic habits that may be relevant for the clinical management. Underwater vision presents challenges for the mammalian eye: the need for increased sensitivity to light, accommodation of the spectral shift toward the blue-green wavelengths, and modification of the ocular focusing capacity because of refractive differences compared with those in air. Different adaptations for these challenges have been proposed, although visual acuity in water is somewhat reduced in some otter species (i.e., Asian small-clawed otter). Little is known of the importance, sensitivity, and mechanisms of hearing in otters, in the aquatic or the terrestrial environment. Olfaction has been retained as an important sense for aquatic mustelids, largely but not exclusively in support of their activities on land. However, evidence suggests that otters have less complex scent production capacities compared with terrestrial mustelids and that scent production capacity in sea otters may be more poorly developed and less important than in other otter species. These changes probably have resulted from the increased importance of vision and the reduced importance of olfaction in the aquatic environment. The long, lean body of Mustelinae species makes them vulnerable to rapid heat loss on land and in the water. Insulation in aquatic mustelids is achieved by means of a dense underfur that prevents water penetration to the skin while providing buoyancy. Because fur is an efficient insulator, furred aquatic mammals require some means of thermoregulation; in sea otters, thermoregulation is conducted through the enlarged rear flippers. In otters and minks, swimming is the primary means of locomotion. These species demonstrate many adaptations that enhance swimming performance and reduce energy expenditure while in the water: body streamlining, large, specialized plantar surfaces for propulsion, and the ability to remain submerged for extended periods. However, most otters, unlike most aquatic mammals, are capable of quadrupedal locomotion on land, and this is why they are considered morphologically intermediate between terrestrial and aquatic mammals. 12\n\nMost species tolerate a wide range of temperature ranges. Temperate and cold-adapted species held outdoors need protection from sunlight when the temperature exceeds 50\u00b0 F (10\u00b0 C). Tropical species require heated shelters when ambient temperatures drop below 69\u00b0 F (20\u00b0 C). Animals kept indoors should not be exposed to temperatures exceeding 78\u00b0 F (25\u00b0 C). It is important to be aware that required temperature ranges vary among individuals as well as between species, so individual animals should be given the opportunity to select a comfortable ambient temperature from a gradient provided in the enclosure. Humidity for indoor enclosures should range from 30% to 70% but may be higher for tropical species. The amount of time individuals held indoors are exposed to light should replicate the natural photoperiod of their native environment, particularly for those species that are expected to reproduce in captivity. Currently, data on the effects of varying light intensity or type of light (fluorescent versus natural) on reproductive behavior are not available; however, a correlation exists between the onset of estrus in northern mustelid species. 4 Indoor exhibits should have a negative air pressure of five to eight air changes per hour (for odor control) of non-recirculated air; however, this is not necessarily a requirement and recirculated air may be used in some cases. Fresh drinking water should be provided at all times. Nonfiltered water, contained in pools or moats and used for swimming, should be changed on a regular basis. Even if water is filtered, it should be completely changed periodically. Mustelids should not be given access to pools that have recently been treated with chlorine (levels should be <0.5 parts per million [ppm] ). For otters that normally inhabit fresh or brackish water environments, dissolved nutrients should be monitored and water changes performed, as appropriate. It is suggested that the coliform level not exceed 400 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) (water with a level of 100 CFU/mL is reported to be safe for humans). Filtration should be used in closed pools for otter. Sand filters, pool pumps, charcoal filters, and ozone pressure sand filters have all been used effectively. Drain outlets and filter and skimmer inlets should be covered to prevent furnishings from obstructing them or from otters getting stuck in them. Natural flow-through systems work well in otter exhibits. Water flowing in must be clean and pollutant free. All uneaten food items should be removed from pools on a daily basis. Because minks are highly susceptible to methyl mercury toxicity, pools need to be maintained at a neutral or basic pH (acidic pH enhances methylation of mercury).\n\nControlling of sounds and vibrations that may be detected by mustelids is important to their well-being. Anecdotal reports of loud noises and vibrations of certain amplitude affecting parturition and early kit rearing in mustelids have been published. 3, 4 \n\nExhibits should be designed to satisfy the physical, social, behavioral, and psychological needs of the species while closely replicating their habitat in the wild. Enclosure size for arboreal and terrestrial mustelids is based on species' and individual needs (e.g., juveniles versus adults versus geriatric animals). Exhibits that are provided extensive enrichment and are structurally varied may be smaller than exhibits lacking these characteristics. (Note that enrichment items must be chosen carefully, since many mustelid species are prone to chewing and ingesting enrichment parts, putting them at risk of gastrointestinal [GI] foreign body obstruction). Recommended exhibit sizes are based on species size, behavioral repertoire, home range size, daily movements, and activity patterns. Detailed information is given in the Mustelid (Mustelidae) and Otter (Lutrinae) Care Manuals provided by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Small Carnivore Taxon Advisory Group.\n\nAnimal and human safety must be kept in mind when designing and building mustelid exhibits. Additionally, mustelids are not well suited for free-ranging exhibits because of their uncanny ability to escape. Exhibits must be designed to prevent them from digging, jumping, climbing, or swimming out of enclosures. Outdoor exhibits should have containment perimeters, tops and hotwire 3 to 5 feet (ft.; 1-1.52 meters [m]) installed above ground level to prevent them from climbing and falling. For burrowing species (e.g., badgers), the bottom of the containment fence may need to be buried to a sufficient depth and angled toward the center of the exhibit to prevent escape. For amphibious species (e.g., otters), optimal land-to-water ratios are species dependent. These ratios may need to be changed as exhibit size increases or decreases (e.g., smaller exhibits will require a higher land area proportion within the ratio). 3, 4 \n\nWithin the Mustelidae family, food habits vary significantly. Some are strict carnivores (ferrets, weasels, polecats, etc.), some are omnivorous (skunks, badgers or tayras), and some are piscivorous (fish and crustacean eaters such as otters) (see Table 48 -1). Mustelids have a relatively simple stomach and a short GI tract and, as mentioned above, no cecum. The more omnivorous species have flattened molars. Captive mustelid species are fed on a great variety of items: commercial dry dog food, mink food, and cat food, and cereal diets mixed with meat, fresh or frozen fish, shellfish, crabs, and crayfish. Fruits, vegetables (carrots, lettuce, green beans, cucumber, collard greens, kale, potatoes, among others), eggs, and live or killed food items (crickets, mealworms, mice, prairie dogs) have also been incorporated into captive diets. Target dietary nutrient values for mustelids are based on several sources. The cat is typically the model species used to establish nutrient guidelines for strict carnivorous animals. The National Research Council (NRC, 2006, for dogs and cats), and Association of American Feed Control Officials (1994, for cats) have provided recommendations. A limited amount of information has been provided by the NRC publication on mink and foxes, which represents the requirements of another mustelid species (Table  48 -2). The complete dietary requirements of domestic ferrets are still unknown, so no one particular diet is currently being recommended over another. In the ferret and mink diet, the protein should be of high quality and easily digestible because of their short GI transit time of 3 to 4 hours. Generally, most mustelids need a diet high in good-quality meat protein and fat and low in complex carbohydrates, inclusive of sugars, and fiber. High levels of protein from plant sources have been associated with urolithiasis in mustelids and are therefore undesirable. Food should be offered at least twice a day, and water must be available at all times. When developing appropriate dietary management plans for a specific mustelid species, the following should be considered: feeding ecology, target nutrient values, food items available at zoos, and information collected from diets offered by institutions successfully maintaining and breeding for the species.\n\nEven though some captive mustelids may be gentle with their keepers, all members of this family may be handled with nets, snares, or squeeze cages. Caution must be used while managing wild mustelids, as they have needle-sharp teeth and are agile and aggressive and may inflict severe bites. They are also potential vectors of rabies, so they should be handled with caution. Leather gloves should be used by operators when handling any kind of mustelid, whatever the size. The ferret is best restrained when grasped above the shoulders, with one hand gently squeezing the forelimbs together and the thumb under the animal' s chin. Minks are grasped by the tail with one hand, while the other hand grasps the animal behind the neck, with the thumb and finger around the head. Polecats, ermines, weasels, and martens are better restrained initially with a net when an injection has to be administered by hand. Skunks defend themselves by spraying the secretions of the anal sacs, and they may bite as well. The defensive position assumed by a threatened skunk is hindquarters facing the enemy, feet planted firmly on the ground, and tail straight up in the air. They should be captured with a net from behind a shield of glass or plastic, or the handler should wear goggles and protective rain gear. Larger mustelids such as otters, badgers, and wolverine may be placed in a small squeeze cage for manual injection of a tranquilizer or directly injected by means of a pole syringe or a blowpipe. 16 Mustelids are susceptible to stress caused by improper handling and transport. Fresh water and marine otters are particularly susceptible to stress-associated exertional myopathy. Different techniques have been developed for safe management of this species. Only trained personal should handle mustelids, and usually, a combination of physical restraint and chemical restraint is advocated to reduce stress and avoid capture myopathy. The duration of restraint should be brief, and care should be taken to avoid trauma to the oral cavity and limbs. As mentioned above, sea otters are extremely susceptible to stress caused by improper handling and transporting. Different techniques have been developed for the safe management of this species. 19, 24 Chemical Restraint Different drugs have been used extensively for the chemical immobilization of mustelids. In most species, dissociative-benzodiazepine\u03b1 2 -agonists combinations have been used and are highly recommended for induction or short-term anesthesia. Ketamine in excitement in some species. Otters hypoventilate during inhalation anesthesia and require assisted ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercarbia. 26 Whenever possible, the following parameters should be recorded when immobilizing or anesthetizing a mustelid: actual weight, relative oxyhemoglobin saturation (clamp located on tongue, lips, ears, toes), heart and respiratory rates, and rectal temperature. Possible anesthetic complications include respiratory depression (apnea, bradypnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia), hyperthermia, hypothermia, bradycardia, tachycardia, poor myorelaxation, and excitability during recovery. Hypoventilation has been reported to be a cause of mortality in otters with the use of inhalation anesthesia. During recovery from anesthesia, animals should be kept in a quiet, dark denning box or cage or in a confined area to facilitate smooth recovery from anesthesia. 26 \n\nBlood may be collected from various sites; the technique and site chosen depend on the species, how much blood is needed, and operator preference. Sites include the jugular vein, cranial vena cava, ventral coccygeal artery, median caudal vein, lateral saphenous vein, combination with midazolam, diazepam, xylazine, medetomidine, or acepromazine (caution: hyperthermia or hypothermia) to improve muscle relaxation. Xylazine, medetomidine, or dexmedetomidine combined with ketamine has been recommended to improve muscle relaxation, and both combinations may be reversed with atipamezole (2.5 milligram [mg] per 5 mg medetomidine, and 1 mg per 8-12 mg xylazine). 2, 13, 27 Tiletamine-zolazepam is another option. Doses ranging from 2.2 to 22 mg/kg have been reported for numerous species of mustelids; higher doses result in prolonged recovery. In otters, the usage of a low dose of tiletamine-zolazepam to achieve anesthetic induction, and supplementation with isoflurane or ketamine (5 mg/kg) for maintenance, has been advocated. Flumazemil (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) may be used to antagonize the zolazepam portion of this combination to hasten recovery, but its usage has not been reported in mustelids other than the Nearctic river otter. 38 Drugs and dosages commonly used to provide chemical restraint and sedation in selected mustelids are listed in Table 48 -3. These combinations usually provide short periods of chemical restraint (30-45 minutes). If longer periods of anesthesia are needed, inhalation anesthetics (isoflurane and sevoflurane) delivered via an induction chamber, mask, or endotracheal tube is efficient, although the results of chamber induction with inhalation agents may vary and cause Fungal diseases are rarely reported in mustelids, but those cited include histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, coccidiomycosis, mucormycosis (Absidia corymbifera), adiaspiromycosis (Emmonsia crescens), and dermatomycosis (Microsporum sp. and Trichophyton sp.).\n\nTable 48-6 contains information about some common infectious diseases reported in mustelids.\n\nAlthough not generally associated with disease, numerous external and internal parasites have been identified in both wild and captive mustelids. Table 48-7 includes data on selected parasites reported to cause disease in mustelids. Parasitic diseases are also important for wild animals undergoing translocation because of the immune suppression possibly induced by stress. 22 Tables 48-4 and 48-5. Techniques for urine collection, urinary catheterization, splenic and bone marrow aspiration, placement of intravenous and intraosseous catheters, administration of fluids, and blood transfusion have been described for ferret and may be useful when treating other mustelids. 33 A technique of mandibular salivary gland biopsy for rabies testing has been developed in Nearctic river otters. 39 Other diagnostic techniques such as ultrasonography, electrocardiography, radiography, and auscultation are applicable but vary for each species.\n\nThe following viral diseases have been reported in mustelids: Aleutian mink disease (plasmacytosis), influenza, canine distemper, rabies, rotavirus diarrhea, infectious canine hepatitis, pseudorabies (Aujeszky disease), transmissible mink encephalopathy, mink enteritis, epizootic catarrhal enteritis of ferret (coronavirus) feline panleukopenia, canine parvovirus, feline leukemia, Powassan virus disease (arbovirus), herpes, and necrotizing encephalitis (herpes simplex). 18, [21] [22] [23] The following bacteria have been identified as pathogenic in mustelids: Helicobacter mustelae, Desulfovibrio spp., Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens type A, C. botulinum, C. welchii, Mycobacterium spp., Actinomyces spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putrefaciens (also known as Shewanella putrefaciens), Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oozaenae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia pestis, Y. ruckeri, Bacillus Most mustelids cats (pyrethrin powders and sprays and others). Organophosphates and carbamates should be used with caution, as safe protocols for mustelids have not been established.\n\nProtozoal infection include Giardia spp., Isospora spp., Eimeria spp., Sarcocystis spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Sarcosporidium sp., Besnoitia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Pneumocystis carinii, Trypanosomiasis cruzi, Cryptosporidium spp. 40 Helminths reported from mustelids in both zoos and from the wild include: lung flukes (Paragonimus westermani and P. kellicotti), intestinal fluke (Nanophyetus salmincola, Troglotrema acutum), liver flukes (Fasciola hepatica), Acanthocephala (Corynsoma semerme, C. strumosum, Macracanthorhynchus ingens), tapeworms (Taenia sp., Monordotaenia sp., Oschmarenia sp.), trichinosis (Trichinella sp.), lung worms (Skrjabingylus spp., Crenosoma spp., Perostrongylus spp., and Filaroides spp.), heartworms (Dirofilaria spp.), ascariasis (Ascaris spp., Baylisascaris devosi, Toxocara canis), Dioctophyma renale, Dracunculus spp., Strongyloides spp., Capillaria hepatica, Uncinaria sp., Euyhelmis squamula, Aonthotheca putorii, Eucoleus sp., Pearsonema plica, Molineus patens, and Mastophorus muris.\n\nTable 48-8 lists common drugs and doses used for controlling parasitic diseases in mustelids.\n\nThe following have been reported to affect wild and domestic mustelids (Table 48-9 ). Renal calculi (calcium oxalate and urate calculi) were detected in 66.1% of the captive North American adult population of Asian small-clawed otters that had been imaged or necropsied, and prevalence in wild-born otters was 76.7%. The captive diet appears to be a contributing factor to urolith formation and progression. 32 Other medical problems associated with nutrition and feeding practices in mustelids are hypovitaminosis A; vitamin E, thiamin, (Chastek disease), calcium, vitamin D, zinc, and biotin deficiencies; zinc toxicity; nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism (NSH); fibrous osteodystrophy; gastric trichobezoars; dental disease (dental calculus, gingivitis, and periodontal disease); gastric and duodenal ulceration; and gastric dilatation and torsion. 34, 36 Metabolic Diseases Urolithiasis (magnesium ammonium phosphate, calcium oxalate, calcium urate, calcium phosphate, and ammonium urate uroliths), hypocalcemia, pregnancy toxemia, agalactia, hyperestrogenism, hormonal alopecia, idiopathic hypersplenism, gastric dilatation and torsion (possibly associated with Clostridium welchii), dental and skeletal anomalies, periodontal disease, amyloidosis, hyperadrenocorticism (ferret), insulinoma (ferret), diabetes mellitus (ferret), fatty Most mustelids are seasonal breeders, with the sea otter and the Eurasian otter being exceptions. The duration of the breeding season may vary from 1 month (African striped weasel) to 12 months (Eurasian badger). Some mustelids are polyestrous, and others are monoestrous. The duration of estrus ranges from 3 to 5 days to 5 to 8 weeks. Most males that have been studied have active spermatogenesis for only about 3 to 4 months in a year, although exceptions such as the Eurasian badger do exist. Mustelids may be either induced or spontaneous ovulators.\n\nMany mustelids exhibit delayed implantation: sea otters, Nearctic river otters, hog badgers, American and Eurasian badgers, ratels, striped skunks, western spotted skunks, wolverines, all martens, ermines, long tail weasels, minks, and marbled polecats. In those species, embryo development proceeds to the blastocyst stage and then ceases. This period of blastocyst dormancy is called diapause and varies from a few weeks in minks and striped skunks to almost a year in the Eurasian badgers. Extensive studies have been conducted on the mechanisms that control embryonic diapause in three species of mustelids: minks (Mustela vison), Eurasian badgers (Meles meles), and western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis). Numerous investigators have speculated on the ecologic significance and selective pressures that might have favored the development of delayed implantation. 29 Changes in photoperiods are known to alter the secretion of pituitary hormones and thus the onset and duration of breeding, puberty, and timing of implantation. In this way, photomanipulation has been used in some species. Adequate numbers of animals should be maintained for mating, but compatibility does not ensure reproductive success. If copulation or gestation does not occur, different pairings should be tried, but in some cases, animals that are not compatible during most of the year will often breed if introduced during estrus. For this, determining when females are in estrous may be crucial. Various methods for estrus detection have been proposed in different species, including behavioral changes, vulvar swelling, vaginal cytology, and fecal and urinary hormone analyses. In males, the testes enlarge during the breeding season. Pregnancy may be determined by urinary progesterone and conjugated estrogen levels, palpation, radiography (end of gestation period), and ultrasonography. 4 liver, cardiovascular calcification, osteomalacia, and degenerative joint disease. 11, 37 Neoplasia Over 50 different neoplasms have been reported in the domestic ferret. Although no current consensus exists on the cause of the high prevalence of neoplasia in ferrets, several theories have been proposed: genetic predisposition, early neutering of ferrets at 5 to 6 weeks of age, lack of natural photoperiod or exposure to natural sunlight, diet, and infectious agents. However, neoplasms are not common in species other than ferrets and include: seminoma, leiomyoma, adenocarcinoma, pheochromocytoma, teratoma, lymphosarcoma, anal sac carcinoma, lymphoreticular tumor, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and a tumor resembling Hodgkin disease. 6, 7 \n\nReproductive toxicity (including decreased baculum weight, cryptorchidism, cystic vas deferens) in European otters exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; organophosphate and carbamate intoxication; mortality associated with melarsomine and petroleum residues; mercury toxicity; secondary exposure to rodenticide; shock; exertional myopathy (capture myopathy); trauma; intestinal volvulus; pneumoperitoneum; uterine torsion; interspecific aggression (especially following introductions); behavior problems (self-mutilation); cystic kidneys; dilated cardiomyopathy; cor pulmonale; intervertebral disk disease; osteoarthritis; tail alopecia syndrome; overgrowth of claws; oral, gastric, and intestinal foreign bodies; gastric and intestinal ulcers; pyometra; capture related injuries (mostly digit and tooth damage); pulmonary silicosis; fibrocartilaginous emboli; trauma (mostly associated with gunshots, vehicle encounters, and from traps); and hydrocephalus in European otter cubs have all been reported. 9, 14, 17, 24, 31 REPRODUCTION Important variations exist in the reproductive cycles among mustelids. Some data for representative species are listed in Table 48-10 . Fervac-D (United Vaccines, Madison, WI), which is an egg-adapted strain, has induced anaphylactoid and anaphylactic reactions in some mustelids, so its use is not recommended.\n\nVaccination schedules for nondomestic species are extrapolated from studies of the domestic dog. Neonates receiving colostrum should be vaccinated every 3 to 4 weeks between 6 and 16 weeks of age. Colostrum-deprived neonates should be given two vaccinations administered at a 3-to 4-weeks interval and starting at 2 weeks of age because maternal antibodies acquired in utero may be absent by 4 to 6 weeks of age. Data on maternal antibody interference with vaccination in ferrets suggest that a final canine distemper vaccine should be administered after 10 weeks of age.\n\nIf an animal has an adverse reaction to canine distemper vaccine, an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride, 0.5-2 mg/ kg, intravenously [IV] or intramuscularly [IM]) or, for severe reactions, epinephrine (20 microgram per kilogram [\u00b5g/kg], IV, IM, subcutaneously [SC], or intratracheally (IT]) should be administered and supportive care provided.\n\nMustelids are also vaccinated with a killed rabies vaccine (Imrab), although the efficacy of this vaccine has not been proven in exotic mustelids. Rabies should be given at 16 weeks of age to animals at risk of contracting rabies and given boosters annually thereafter.\n\nIn ferrets, continued high levels of estradiol from persistent estrus may lead to alopecia and bone marrow suppression, resulting in pancytopenia and even death, so nonbreeding females should be neutered.\n\nNo specific recommendations for contraception exist for mustelids, and ovariohysterectomy, vasectomy, and castration are currently the safest permanent sterilization procedures of birth control. Melengestrol acetate hormone implants have been used successfully to prevent conception in mustelids. These should be removed after 2 years for one pregnancy, if possible, and are not recommended for more than a total of 4 years. The human contraceptive implant Norplant contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestin, and has been used to prevent pregnancy in the striped skunk. Depo-Provera injection (5 mg/kg every 2 months) has also been used. Although no data exist for mustelids, progestin contraceptives may be associated to progressive endometrial hyperplasia, resulting in infertility, infections, and sometimes uterine cancer in other carnivores. Deslorelin implants (gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] analogue) have been used as an alternative to melengestrol acetate. 1\n\nMany of the clinical and surgical procedures used in dogs and cats are applied to mustelids. Specialized surgical procedures have been developed for some mustelid species. 20, 28, 38 Periodic examinations should include the following: \u25c6 Checking transponders and tattoos, and reapplication, if necessary \u25c6 Checking baseline physiologic parameters (weight, breeding status) \u25c6 Examination of the oral cavity \u25c6 Evaluation of the reproductive tract, whole body radiography \u25c6 Collecting blood for hematologic and biochemical evaluation \u25c6 Checking for heartworm in endemic areas using a heartworm enzyme-linked immunosorbent antigen assay test \u25c6 Serum banking \u25c6 Performing fecal examination for internal parasites (and administering anthelmintics, if necessary). Table 48 -8 lists some of the antiparasitic drugs commonly used to treat mustelids. Other drugs (e.g., antibiotics) are dosed at rates for ferrets, dogs, and cats. 8 \u25c6 Updating vaccinations Few viral diseases have been reported in mustelids, except ferrets, although they have been routinely vaccinated against a wide variety of viral diseases. Mustelids have varying susceptibility (species and exposure dependent) to feline panleukopenia, canine distemper, rabies, and leptospirosis. 10 Most authors recommend vaccination of mustelids against rabies and canine distemper. Safety and efficacy of modified live canine distemper vaccinations in exotic species of carnivores has been historically problematic because vaccine-induced distemper has occurred (e.g., a modified-live virus derived from chick embryo cell culture caused the death of four female blackfooted ferrets [Mustela nigripes], or protection was not achieved). In the past, killed distemper vaccines have not provided longstanding protection in most species. A recombinant canarypox-vectored canine distemper vaccine (Purevax, Merial, Athens, GA) has been shown to be safe and efficacious and is the best choice for general mustelid protection against canine distemper virus. 41 If an alternative modified-live canine distemper vaccine is used, it should be given separately and not in multiple forms, since immunosuppression and other untoward vaccine interactions might lead to disease. Ferret or mink cell culture-derived modified-live vaccines should never be used in mustelids. A modified-live canine distemper vaccine of primate kidney tissue cell origin, Onderstepoort type, is available in the United States (Galaxy D; Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, Omaha, NE) and has been proven to be safe and efficacious in hybrid black-footed ferrets and Siberian polecats. The only vaccine approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for ferrets,"}
