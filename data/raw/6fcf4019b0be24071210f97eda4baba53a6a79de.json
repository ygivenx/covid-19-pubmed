WHO has officially named the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] . By Mar 8, 2020, more than 105586 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia had been reported in countries and regions around the world\uff0c the cumulative death toll stands at 3584 [3] . The United States, Australia, Germany, Vietnam, South Korea, Canada, Brazil, Nepal and Japan over 102 countries are also seeing increasing Numbers of travel-related cases and human-to-human transmission [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through droplets and contact, recent studies [4, 12] showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in stool samples of patients, which makes it possible for gastrointestinal transmission.\n\nSeventeen years ago, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) happened in Guangdong Province, China, and soon spread to other countries and regions [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n\nBy the end of the outbreak, 26 countries had reported 8,098 possible SARS cases and 774 deaths [14] . SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both enveloped RNA viruses and widely distributed in humans, other mammals and birds. Recent studies analysis showed that the novel coronavirus had 78% nucleotide homology with human SARS-CoV [17, 18] . As. more and more COVID-19 cases are diagnosed, we find that SARS and COVID-19 share many similarities in clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and mode of transmission. At present, while the epidemic in China is gradually under control, Europe and the Middle East have shown a rapid spread of the epidemic.

So far, our understanding of COVID-19 remained to be limited, Especially in pathology. This report summarizes the initial clinical description and Pathological discovery of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries.\n\nWe also compared the pathological features of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 by describing and emphasizing the characteristic changes of SARS-CoV.\n\nThis study aimed to summary the case of COVID-19 on clinical features, epidemiological findings, laboratory and imageological examination, pathological studies and treatment options in different countries.\n\nThis study was a review that was conducted in 2020. Searches were done in scientific databases of PubMed, based on the combination of related keywords based of Mesh terms (Table 1) . One researcher (Y.Q.M), a professional clinician searched PubMed for all published articles regarding COVID-19 up to March 9, 2020. A second researcher (W. L), a professional clinician with expertise in systematic reviews, repeated the first reviewer's search independently. Both searches agreed completely.\n\nAll steps of searches were done based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

The data extraction of categories, including the author's name, publication year, countries, age, sex, clinical features, epidemiological findings, laboratory and imageological examination, treatment options, pathological studies, etc. After data extraction, we summarized and reported the findings in tables and figures according to the objectives of the study. Two researchers (Y.Q.M and W.L who were specialist physicians) reviewed each of these articles in detail. Each researcher identified every article that concerned clinical characteristics or pathologic studies of COVID-19 infection. These search results are submitted to third parties (J.W.P who was a professionally trained physician), who review discrepancies and make decisions in the event of disagreement.\n\nCategorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were described using a range, median and interquartile ranges (IQR) values, Mean and standard deviation (SD).

Three of the articles were related to pathology [41] [42] [43] . The characteristics of 34 studies are shown in Table 2 . Articles on the characteristics of COVID-19 mainly came from China, as well as from countries with a small number of current case reports, such as the United States, Germany, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Nepal and South Korea.\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 3 . In COVID-19, we found 3.9% were health workers, and 51.7 % were male (male: female=1.07:1). The most common clinical manifestation of COVID-19 were Fever (86.0%), Cough (63.9%), Malaise/Fatigue/Confusion (34.7%), Sputum production (28.9%), Shortness of breath (19.7%) and Myalgia (18.8%), whereas diarrhea (5.7%) and\n\nNausea/vomiting (6.1%) were rare. 26.7% of patients in COVID-19 had at least one underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, etc). Table 3 shows the laboratory and Imaging findings In COVID-19. In these review we found the most common, patterns on chest imaging findings were ground-glass opacity (60.9%) and pulmonary consolidation or exudation (37.0%), 19.5% were unilateral pneumonia and 68.8% were bilateral pneumonia. 64.2%, 29.1% and 24.3% All rights reserved.

Table 3 shows the treatment and outcomes. In this review we found that in COVID-19, oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, the use of corticosteroids or immunoglobulin were in 56.1%, 51.2%, 62.9%, 22.0% and 16.8% of patients, respectively. Another 1.4% and 2.5% of people use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous renal-replacement therapy. The death toll and severe patients of COVID-19 were 18.4% and 2.5%.\n\nBefore the closes of Huanan seafood market on January 1, 2020. people contracted the disease mainly through contact with host animals carrying the virus [24] , Subsequently, infected people spread the virus to their families, communities through human-to-human transmission and contact transmission. Other countries are also seeing increasing numbers of travel-related imported cases and human-to-human transmission. \n\nAll rights reserved.

As more and more confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, we found that SARS and COVID-19 have great similarities in clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and chest imaging.\n\nCurrent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly related to wildlife trafficking It is currently believed that whether SARS or COVID-19, the main source of infection is people infected with coronavirus. in the early report of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 27 reported exposure to the Huanan seafood market [24] . But since the closure of the seafood market on Jan 1, 2020, more and more new cases have been reported to be associated with contact with confirmed patients which stress the importance of human-to-human transmission. However, it's worth noting that there were some people uninfected in close contacts with SARS or COVID-19 [12, 13, 16] .\n\nTherefore, whether genetic susceptibility exists or not needs further study.\n\nIn this study, we found COVID-19 were mainly transmitted by droplets and contact, showing human-to-human transmission, family aggregation spread and All rights reserved.

It is worth noting that COVID-19 has a more diverse mode of transmission that can manifest itself as asymptomatic infection [7] , something that has not previously been seen in SARS [47] . Because of the absence of symptoms, it is difficult to detect and isolate carriers in time, which makes it more difficult to control the spread of the disease [47, 48] . Recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the feces of patients, indicating that the possibility of fecal-oral transmission [4, 12] . There have been reports of infections in newborns [2] , but more studies are needed to confirm the presence of vertical transmission. A study of nine pregnant women [2] which tested the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs and breast milk of six patients for SARS-CoV, all of which were negative and did not support mother-to-child transmission. Human-to-human, asymptomatic infection and possible mother-to-child transmission and fecal-oral transmission are the causes of the widespread spread of the disease. So, the early recognition of COVID-19 in different countries can reduces transmission risk and increases understanding of SARS-CoV-2, to inform national and global response actions.\n\nThrough the summary analysis of the pneumonia, we found that COVID-19 had a general susceptibility, However, it should be noted that cases [2] of infection in pregnant women, newborns, infants and children have been reported successively. The reason was considered to be related to the special immune tolerance state of pregnant women during pregnancy [2] and the low immune function of children and infants [48] .\n\nElderly people with basic diseases are at high risk of infection with COVID-19\uff0c due to All rights reserved.

However, the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were not obvious. COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are easy to be overlooked, so it is necessary to take active and effective isolation measures for suspected patients or close contacts as early as possible. Furthermore, laboratory tests showed that patients with COVID-19 may had lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, along with elevated levels of liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase.\n\nOn imaging, COVID-19 was mainly manifested as multiple ground-glass shadows. A CT scan of 29 patients with COVID-19 revealed a single or multiple patchy frosted glass shadow with septum thickening in typical case of COVID-19.As the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and frosted glass shadows coexist with solid or striated shadows [29] . An imaging study of 81 people found that abnormal chest imaging could occur even in asymptomatic patients and progressed rapidly from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral within 1-3 weeks [26] . Since the early imaging changes of COVID-19 were not obvious, high resolution chest CT examination should be performed as soon as possible for suspected patients to clarify.\n\nAt present, the treatment of COVID-19 is lack of specific drugs and mainly focuses on support treatment.
