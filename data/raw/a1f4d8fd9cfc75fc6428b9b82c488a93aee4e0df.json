Analysis was performed on an LC-MS/MS system consisted of a binary LC-30AD delivery pump, a DUG-20A5R vacuum degasser, a CTO-20A column oven, a SIL-30AC auto-sampler, a CBM-20A system controller (Shimadzu, Japan) and an LCMS-8060 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The mobile phase was composed of solvent A (water containing 0.2 % formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate) and solvent B (acetonitrile contiaining 5% water, 0.2% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate ). The chromatographic separation was performed on a CAPCELL PAK C8 column (3 \u00b5m, 50 mm \u00d7 2.0mm, Shiseido, Japan) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for 4.5 min kept at 40 \u2103, using a gradient method of solvent B from 45% to 55% over 1.5 min, from 55% to 100% over 0.25 min and held for 0.25 min, and back to the initial condition over 2 min to equilibrate the colume. The auto-sampler temperature was maintained at 6 \u00b0C, and the injection volume was set to 5 \u00b5L. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ion (ESI) source working in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode of the transition m/z 969.60\u2192 129.15 for IIQ. The parameters including nebulizing gas flow, heating gas flow, drying gas flow, interface temperature, desolventizer (DL) temperature, heat block temperature, collision energy, Q1 and Q3 voltage were set at 3.0 L/min, 10 L/min, 10 L/min, 300 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C, -54 eV, -24 V and -14 V, respectively.\n\nBy use of a simple protein precipitation method, the test compound was extracted from rat plasma. A stock solution of IIQ was prepared in solvent of 50/50 acetonitrile/ 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and diluted to working solutions at serial concentraion ranging from 1 to 500 \u00b5g/ mL with the same solvent. Plasma samples for standard curves were prepared by spiking 100 \u00b5L of rat plasma with 10 \u00b5L of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, 10 \u00b5L of various working solutions and 120 \u00b5L of acetonitrile (containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 1% ammonium hydroxide). The mixture was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min, the supernatant was transferred to auto-sampler vials, and injected into the LC/MS/MS system. Calibration curve for IIQ in plasma were linear in the concentration range of 0.1-100 \u00b5g/mL, with correlation coefficients of > 0.990. To each tested plasma sample (100 \u00b5L), all the preparation steps were the same as above, except that 10 \u00b5L of various working solutions was substituted by 10 \u00b5L blank solvent.\n\nIn vivo animal test. Three male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 210 \u00b1 10 g) were purchased from Animal Center of Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology. Each rat was dosed with IIQ at 5 mg/kg by i.v. administration. Blood samples were collected into heparin tubes at 0, 0.033, 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after administration, and were immediately centrifuged to separate the plasma fractions. The plasma samples obtained were stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis. Concentration-versus-time profiles were obtained for IIQ, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS version 3.2.8. Data were averaged and reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\n\nSolubility was measured by using an HPLC-UV method. IIQ peptide (~2 mg) was added to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and double-distilled H 2 O (ddH 2 O) (100 \u00b5L) was added for dissolution with shaking for 24 h at 25 \u00b0C, followed by centrifugation of the mixture at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The saturated supernatant solution was filtered through a 0.45\u00b5m filter membrane and then transferred to other vials for analysis by HPLC with UV detection. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. For quantification, analytical RP-HPLC was used with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 mm \u00d7 150 mm, 5 \u00b5m). Solvent A: 0.1% TFA in H 2 O; Solvent B: 0.1% TFA in 70% CH 3 CN/H 2 O; flow rate: 1 mL/min; gradient: 5-100% solvent B in solvent A over 25 min. The aqueous concentration was determined by comparison of the S7 peak area of the saturated solution with a standard curve plotted for the peak area versus known concentrations, which was prepared by solutions of test compound in PBS or ddH 2 O at 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 0.5, and 0 .05 mg/mL.\n\nCell-cell fusion assays were performed as described earlier. 1 HL2/3 cells, which stably express HIV Gag, Env, Tat, Rev and Nef proteins, and TZM-bl cells, which stably express large amounts of CD4 and CCR5, were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reference and Reagent Program (contributed by Drs. Barbara Felber and George Pavlakis or Drs. John C. Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu, respectively). TZM-bl cells (2.5 \u00d7 10 4 /well) and HL2/3 cells (7.5 \u00d7 10 4 /well) were coincubated in 96well plates (Corning Costar) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitors. After incubation for 6-8 h, the medium was aspirated, the cells were washed and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) on a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\nLentivirus-based pseudotyped Sudan Ebola virus was produced as described previously. 2 The Sudan ebola virus pseudovirus and serial dilutions of each peptide were premixed and incubated for 30 min before the mixture was added to the target Huh-7 cells (10 4 per well in 96-well plates). 12 h post-infection, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium. After an additional 72 h, the transduced Huh-7 cells were lysed for the detection of luciferase activity, according to the luciferase assay system manual (Promega, USA). The values of relative light units (RLU) were used to assess the inhibitory activity of peptides.\n\nFour times of the HA unit (HAU) of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (25 \u00b5L) in U-bottomed 96-well plate was prepared, and then an equal volume (25 \u00b5L) of IIQ strated from 100 \u00b5M concentration of 3-fold serial dilution in PBS was added into the plate. After 15 min incubation at room temperature, 50 \u00b5L of freshly prepared chicken erythrocytes (1% v/v in PBS) were added to each well with multichannel pipettes. Subsequently, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow for hemagglutination to occur.\n\nBriefly, the virus stock was diluted with PBS (final titer 10 7 Pfu/mL), and then 100 \u00b5L of virus dilution was mix with an equal volume of IIQ solution (20 \u00b5M) in a microcentrifuge tube. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, 200 \u00b5L of 2% chicken erythrocytes prewarmed at 37 \u00b0C was added, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. 100 \u00b5L of sodium acetate (pH 4.6-5.2) was added to above mixture to trigger hemolysis, and then incubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Prior to measure the absorbance of released hemoglobin, the cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 8 min to separate the nonlysed cells. The absorbance of supernatant at OD 535nm was measured by SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices, USA)."}
