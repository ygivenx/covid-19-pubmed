After washing 267 three times with TBST for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated with 268 secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed another three times, and 269 then visualized by an Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, USA).\n\nThe band densities were quantified by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA). All the results are presented as the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and were 289 analyzed using SPSS 23.0 software. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 290 Dunnett's t-test were used to evaluate the significant differences among the groups, 291 and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\nTo determine the appropriate timepoint for the virus infection, we exposed 303 VK2/E6E7 cells to HSV-2 for different duration intervals (6-48 h). The western blot 304 results showed that, compared with that of the control group, the expression of 305 endogenous LC3B-II in the HSV-2-infected cells was increased significantly at each \n\nThe microtubule-associated protein 1 LC3B is synthesized in the form of the 318 LC3B precursor (pro-LC3B), which is proteolytically processed into the cytosolic 319 LC3B-I isoform. When autophagy is induced, LC3B-I is modified into the Baf+HSV-2-treated group (Fig. 4) , which indicated that JZ-1 induced autophagic flux.\n\nThe above conclusions were confirmed by an increase in Atg5 in the western blot 382 analysis ( Fig. 4A and C) . Altogether, these data demonstrated that JZ-1 has an 383 anti-HSV-2 effect, which may be related to its induction of autophagic flux. Therefore, Rapa also decreased the release of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6, but treatment with 3-MA 413 dramatically increased the secretion levels of these cytokines (Fig. 6A) . The kinase mTOR is a complex of two mTOR components, mTORC1 and 417 mTORC2, which have different protein components (Bhaskar and Hay, 2007) . 418 mTORC1 is a major negative regulator of autophagy, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is a major upstream major modulator of mTORC1 (Schmelzle and Hall, 2000) . To 420 investigate the mechanism by which JZ-1 induces autophagy, we assessed the changes 421 in the classic PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the VK2/E6E7 cells. The results from 422 qRT-PCR assays and western blot analyses showed that, compared with that of the 423 control, the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR (p-Akt 424 and p-mTOR) in the HSV-2-infected cells were significantly increased, and these 425 proteins all were decreased significantly in the JZ-1+HSV-2 group (Fig. 5B, Fig. 7C ). showed that, compared with that of the HSV-2 group, the expression levels of PI3K, 433 p-Akt and p-mTOR were significantly reduced in the LY + HSV-2 group, indicating 434 that it indeed inhibited the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway (Fig. 6C, Fig. 7D ). On this 435 basis, we measured the expression levels of LC3B and Atg5 and found that, in the 436 JZ-1 +HSV-2 +LY -treated group, the LC3B and Atg5 mRNA expression levels and 437 the LC3B-II and Atg5 protein expression levels were not different from those in the 438 LY+HSV-2 group (Fig. 6C, Fig. 7D ). As expected, LY pretreatment eliminated the \n\nThe present study demonstrated that JZ-1 is effective in combating HSV-2 611 infection, and the potential mechanism is associated with inducing autophagy through 612 inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our findings suggest that JZ-1 is a 613 promising anti-HSV-2 formula to be further researched and developed. Table 2 The "}
