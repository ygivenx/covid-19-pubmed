{"title": "Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19: A Hospital Staff Data", "body": "As clinic experiences increases, clinicians become conscious of cardiovascular comorbidities and manifestations of COVID-19. Two reports showed that patients with COVID-19 and hypertension or coronary artery disease had worse in-hospital outcomes [8, 9] . Cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) could be the initial presentation or appear throughout the whole course of COVID-19. Liu et al analyzed 137 cases with COVID-19 and found that patients who complains palpitation as initial symptom accounted for 7.3% [10] . The first report of 41 cases with COVID-19 admitted from December 1, 2019 to January 2, 2020, revealed acute cardiac injury occurred in 12% of patients [11] . Wang et al reported in a single-center case series involving 138 patients with COVID-19, also found that cardiovascular complications of were not rare, among which arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury accounted for 16.7% and 7.2%, respectively. The level of hypersensitive troponin I on admission was significantly higher in those who had been admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) than those who had not [12] . Further, a comparative study was applied to explain whether concomitant CVMs had effect on the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.\n\nAs a retrospective study and data analysis were performed anonymously, the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Ethics Committees of the Central Hospital of Wuhan approved this study.\n\nA group of staff of the Central Hospital of Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Pneumology Department of the Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 15 to January 24, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was obtained from patients. The Central Hospital of Wuhan located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of COVID-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals affiliated \n\nThe medical records of patients were collected into a database by the researcher of the Central Hospital of Wuhan from electronic medical records system.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment and outcomes data were first-hand obtained. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information recorded included demographic data, medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, nucleic acid detection of throat swab, treatment measures and in-hospital adverse events. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. Treatment included antiviral therapy, antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous human albumin or immunoglobulin, thymosin, traditional Chinese medicine, mesenchymal stem cell therapy and respiratory support. None received kidney replacement therapy, plasma exchange or artificial liver.\n\nRespiratory failure (RF) was diagnosed according to arterial blood gas analysis. hospital adverse events included RF or ARDS, transfer to ICU, invasive mechanic   ventilation, acute cardiac injury, AKI, acute hepatic injury, acute myocyte injury, shock, secondary infection and death. Cases with CVMs were defined by any one of these throughout the course of disease: 1, complain of palpitation or chest distress; 2, elevation of creatine kinase-MB or hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (above the 99th percentile upper reference limit); 3, new abnormalities on electrocardiography including sinus tachycardia.\n\nThroat swab samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 ribose nucleic acid (RNA) from patients with suspected or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (Miraclean Technology Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China). After collection, the throat swabs were placed into a collection tube with virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System, Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd, China). The suspension was used for real-time \n\nData statistics was applied using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA).\n\nStudent's t-tests were used to compare continuous variables, which conform to a .

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to control baseline confounders. Covariates for logistic regression were those variables with significant differences between the two groups in baseline. All P values were two sided with a significance level of 0.05. Tendency of significant difference was judged when 0.05<P<0.1.\n\nThe study population included 41 hospitalized staff with confirmed COVID-19.\n\nThe mean age was 39.1 (\u00b1 9.2) years, and 17 (41.5%) were men. The clinician and clinical nurse, who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, accounted for 46.3% and 34.1%, respectively. Cases from medical detection departments accounted for 12.2%, who also had contact with COVID-19 patients or their specimen. Only 3 (7.3%) cases were from administrative or logistics departments, who mostly had contacted with infected colleagues. Recalling epidemiological history, 97% of all could tell how they infected. Definite history of patient contact accounted for 73.2%, while suspected history of patient contact accounted for 14.6%. Only 2 cases (4.9%) told contact with infected family members, but they had also contacted with suspected COVID-19 patients, making the clue questioning. (Table 1 )\n\nAs a young and middle-aged population, mostly of them were generally healthy, presented as less comorbidities (29.3%) than general community population previously reported [11, 12] . The comorbidities with high incidence in the elderly like diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and malignant tumor were all lower than 5.0%.\n\nThe three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed in this study were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%), and cough (41.5%). Furthermore, other symptoms during course of disease included sputum .

(Table 1) The mean white blood cell (WBC) count was 4.89 (\u00b1 1.83) \u00d710\u2079/L. Cases with WBC count below 4.0\u00d710\u2079/L accounted for 36.6%. The mean lymphocyte count was 1.22 (\u00b1 0.58) \u00d710\u2079/L. Cases with lymphocyte count below 1.0\u00d710\u2079/L accounted for 34.1%.\n\nCases with procalcitonin below 0.2 ng/mL accounted for 97.6%. (Table 2) There were 26 of the 41 enrolled patients (63.4%) who showed bilateral involvement of chest computed tomography (CT) scan at the first time since onset.\n\nAnd cases with bilateral involvement of chest CT scan during admission accounted for 80.5%, lower than the percentage previously reported [11, 12] (Table 2, Figure 1 ).\n\nAll 41 cases received at least twice nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission. Only those with normal temperature for more than 3 days, improved respiratory symptoms, obvious absorption of pulmonary inflammation on radiography, as well as twice negative nucleic acid detection of throat swab with interval more than 24 hours, can be released from quarantine and discharged, according to the Diagnosis Table 2 )\n\nThere were 40 cases (97.6%) received at least one kind of antiviral drugs empirically including oseltamivir, ribavirin, arbidol or lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which were accessible clinically in China. Antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs were applied in 95.1% cases regarding to confirmed secondary infection or preventing secondary infection in relatively severe cases. Corticosteroid was used in 78.0% cases to control immune overreaction. Human albumin was applied when serum albumin decreased below 30g/L. Immunoglobulin was also applied empirically, as well as .

Cases who received Chinese traditional medicine accounted for 19.5%, including patent medicine and prescription. There were 4 cases as of March 3 received mesenchymal stem cell therapy after informed consent. One of them firstly consented this empirical therapy on day 35 after symptom onset as pulmonary inflammation poorly absorbed on CT scan (Figure 1 ). There were 23 cases (56.1%) underwent respiratory support, including oxygen therapy through only common nasal catheter, face mask, both common nasal catheter and face mask simultaneously, high flow nasal cannula and mechanic ventilation. Only one case suffered from irreformable hypoxemia, received noninvasive ventilator support, and later transferred to ICU for tracheal intubation. (Table 3) There was none in-hospital death, and none suffered from acute cardiac injury or AKI during admission as to March 3,2020. Two cases were diagnosed as RF or ARDS (Table 4 )\n\nAmong 41 cases analyzed, patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 \u00b1 0.43 and 1.55 \u00b1 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more .

(Table 5 )\n\nThe analyzed population is characterized as younger age, less comorbidities than common community patients [11, 12] , and mostly featured non-severe course of There is no specific antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection up to now. Expectation mainly comes from evidences that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro, while their cytotoxicity remains in control [22] . It was reported that remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug, in previously clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, exhibited broad-spectrum .
