{"title": "SURVEY AND SUMMARY RAN translation and frameshifting as translational challenges at simple repeats of human neurodegenerative disorders", "body": "A particular group of human neurological disorders is associated with expansions of simple repetitive elements within specific genes. This class comprises more than 20 diseases, which have been categorized into coding and noncoding repeat expansion disorders depending on the genetic location of their causative mutations (1) (2) (3) . The toxicity of the coding repeats located within ATG-initiated open reading frames (ORFs) is typically governed via a protein gainof-function mechanism. This mode of repeat toxicity is found in numerous disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), in which the expression of exonic CAG repeat expansions gives rise to polyglutamine (polyGln)-rich proteins that adversely affect various cellular functions (3) . However, the toxicity of coding CAG repeats can also be exerted on the transcript level via an RNA gain-of-function mechanism that was initially described for the noncoding repeat expansion disorder myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Also Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), SCA31, SCA10, SCA8 and, most recently, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS/FTD) have been shown to exhibit toxicity via a mutant transcript gain-of-function mechanism. In these diseases, the expression of transcripts harboring expansions of particular repeats leads to the formation of nuclear RNA foci that sequester specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in a loss of their normal function (9) (10) (11) .\n\nOver the past several years, these traditional paradigms of repeat toxicity have been reevaluated, as bidirectional transcription through repeat regions of genes associated with numerous human neurological disorders has been described (12, 13) along with non-AUG translation initiation at expanded CAG, CGG and GGGGCC (G 4 C 2 ) repeats (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . The discovery of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, which indicates that noncoding diseases could involve unexplored yet toxic proteins and that coding diseases are likely to produce unexpected proteins in other frames, has proven how inscrutable these diseases remain. Importantly, novel proteins have been found to accumulate in the relevant tissues of the diseases in both patients and model organisms, suggesting that homopolymeric or dipeptide repeat repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation products might play a role in microsatellite expansion disorders. Nevertheless, their precise contribution to the process of pathogenesis of SCA8, DM1, FXTAS and C9ALS/FTD remains to be determined.\n\nSeveral mechanisms of translation initiation are possible; however, none seems to explain RAN translation. The cap-dependent scanning mechanism and cap-independent internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mechanisms are the best known types of translation initiation (23, 24) ; however, other initiation mechanisms such as leaky scanning, ribosome shunting or reinitiation are also known (25) . The fact that microsatellite expansions do not follow the canonical rules of translation initiation and generate series of homopolymeric or dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) in multiple frames indicates the involvement of a novel yet unrecognized process or the altered utilization of known processes. RNA structures formed by the repeats must be considered when deciphering mechanisms of RAN translation because their formation and stability have been shown to affect the abundance of RAN translation products (14) . Could such structures be used to trigger an IRES type of mechanism? Could IRES translation-associated factors (ITAFs) that normally help to stabilize RNA structures be more abundant at repeat-formed structures, allowing translation initiation without an AUG start codon? Could alternative start codons occurring within or in close proximity to these repeats permit the noncanonical initiation of protein production? These questions and many others arise when dissecting the novel ambiguity of expanded repeats.\n\nMicrosatellite repeat expansions have also been demonstrated to affect the maintenance of a reading frame by challenging the translation elongation machinery. Frameshifting by one nucleotide downstream or one nucleotide upstream during translation across elongated CAG repeats of ATXN3 and HTT transcripts results in the generation of new proteins containing polyAla (SCA3 and HD) and pol-ySer (HD) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . Such ribosome slippage occurs probably at random positions along the expanded CAG repeats in tissues and cells, and what initiates the process remains unknown. Nonetheless, the frequency of frameshifting increases with the number of CAG repeats and seems to depend on the formation of hairpin structures by the repeats. The resulting chimeric mutant proteins accumulate in intranuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates that are toxic on the cellular level, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA3 and HD (26, 28, 30) .\n\nThe occurrence of RAN translation and frameshifting challenge the common dogmas that the expansions of CAG, CGG and G 4 C 2 repeats located in non-coding sequences do not encode any proteins and that CAG repeat mutations located in polyGln ORFs express proteins only in one frame. These findings raise the possibility that the new proteins resulting from RAN translation and frameshifting can be ubiquitous and contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurological disorders.\n\nIn this review, we describe numerous features of the RAN translation of expanded CAG, CGG and G 4 C 2 repeats in SCA8, DM1, FXTAS and C9ALS/FTD and present known facts regarding the frameshifting that occurs at expanded CAG repeats in SCA3 and HD. We discuss putative mechanisms of RAN translation initiation and frameshifting during translation elongation and share our thoughts regarding the prevalence and biomedical importance of these repeat-associated phenomena.\n\nIn deciphering an ambiguous pathomechanism of SCA8, the Ranum group has found that microsatellite expansions of CAG repeats can express homopolymeric proteins in all three reading frames in the absence of an AUG initiation codon (14) . This discovery, called Repeat-Associated Non-AUG translation or RAN translation, instigated a series of further findings from other laboratories that have proven that atypical protein production can be found in the presence of CGG repeats of FXTAS (16) as well as of G 4 C 2 and C 4 G 2 repeats of ALS/FTD (15, (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) 31, 32) .\n\nRAN translation, which occurs across long hairpinforming CAG repeats of ATXN8 and DMPK transcripts, was consistently found in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells and in murine neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1 ) and was also demonstrated using CAG transcripts in vivo in SCA8 and DM1 human and mouse tissues (Supplementary Table S2 ). This non-AUG translation leads to the expression of atypical homopolymeric proteins in all three reading frames, producing polyGln in the CAG frame, polyserine (polySer) in the AGC frame and polyalanine (polyAla) in the GCA repeat frame. Furthermore, expanded CUG repeats are likely to be RAN translated in three possible frames (the CUG, UGC and GCU frames), coding, respectively, polyleucine (polyLeu), polycysteine (polyCys) and polyAla (14) .\n\nRAN translation was shown to depend on the repeat length, and the abundance of nascent proteins tends to increase with the repeat number. In SCA8, polyAla was the most expressed, followed by polyGln and polySer, and the repeat lengths at which robust levels of these proteins were detected by western blot in HEK293T cells were 73, 42 and 58, respectively (Supplementary Table S1 ). These three proteins can be co-expressed in a single cell; however, their levels varied significantly among cells, as shown by immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, the intracellular localization of the RAN translation products varies, and polyAla proteins are dispersed in the cytoplasm but may form aggregates in the nucleus. PolyGln forms nuclear aggregates, and the least abundant polySer forms both cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates (14) .\n\nTwo years after the first report on RAN translation, Todd et al. showed that this noncanonical protein synthesis also occurs at CGG repeats in FXTAS (16) . Non-AUG-initiated proteins were found in transfected mammalian cells (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1 ), in patients' brain tissues and in different FXTAS model organisms, including transgenic mice and flies (Supplementary Table S2 ). Homoaminoacid RAN translation proteins were expressed in two of three possible reading frames: polyglycine (polyGly) from the GGC repeat frame and polyAla from the GCG frame, while no polyarginine (polyArg) was detected from the reading frame with CGG repeats. Different abundances of these proteins, i.e. predominance of polyGly and an inability to detect polyArg, may reflect a large difference in the initiation frequency in different frames, preferential dropoff of nascent polyArg peptide or alternatively, large differences in cellular stability of polypeptides that were synthesized in different frames.\n\nWhen tested in transfected cells, RAN translation has been observed either from expanded (55 and 88-160) or normal (30-50) CGG repeat lengths, with a higher abundance of proteins being expressed from short (\u223c30 CGG) rather than from longer (\u223c88 CGG) repeats as determined by western blot (Supplementary Table S1 ). These results may be a consequence of the decreased efficiency of RAN translation from expanded repeats but may also be caused by the limitations of the methods that were used to detect its products, as concluded by Todd et al. (16) .\n\nThe latest findings from various groups indicate that RAN translation can also be initiated from expanded hexanucleotide repeats associated with C9ALS/FTD (15, (17) (18) (19) 22) . The C9ORF72 locus of ALS/FTD was shown to be bidirectionally transcribed, and both the sense and the antisense C9 transcripts with hexanucleotide repeats can express DPRs in all possible reading frames (15, 17, 19) . The DPRs expressed from sense transcripts are polyGlyAla, polyGlyPro and polyGlyArg (18) , whereas the DPRs expressed from antisense transcripts are polyProArg, polyGlyPro and polyProAla (15) . Furthermore, additional polyProArg and polyGlyPro proteins were expressed from short ORFs of the antisense transcripts due to the presence of AUG codons preceding the C 4 G 2 repeats in these reading frames (15) .\n\nDPRs of sense and antisense transcripts have been detected in experimental models of C9ALS/FTD, in human postmortem brain tissues (15, 18) and in human iPSCderived neurons (20, 21) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) . These non-AUG-initiated DPRs form intracellular inclusions, and when found in neuronal cells, they co-aggregate (22) . The efficiency of the C9 RAN translation is lengthdependent with respect to the hexanucleotide repeats, being more efficient for longer repeats (15, 17, 22, 32) . Mori et al. has demonstrated the expression of sense strand-derived DPRs in HEK293T cells, and polyGlyAla was expressed from constructs harboring \u223c38 G 4 C 2 repeats. PolyGlyPro was found when the repeat length was extended to 145, whereas no polyGlyArg DPRs were detected from constructs with 11 to 145 G 4 C 2 repeats (Supplementary Figure  S1 ) (19) . The Ranum group reported that all three DPRs are detectable in HEK293T cells transfected with constructs of only 30 G 4 C 2 repeats; however, their expression becomes more abundant with 60 and 120 repeats (15) .\n\nDespite the great interest in RAN translation, it is still a matter of debate whether the non-AUG-initiated proteins are toxic and can be linked to the pathology of SCA8, DM1, FXTAS and C9ALS/FTD. RAN-translated proteins related to the four disorders are found either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus as aggregated or diffused deposits, and they may be expressed simultaneously in the cells and co-aggregate into single inclusions. These inclusions can co-exist with nuclear repeat RNA foci but are also found in diseased cells that are void of foci of mutant transcripts (16, 17, 33) . The non-AUG-initiated proteins have been found in cultured cells (Supplementary Table S1 ), in experimental models of the diseases and in patient tissues (Supplementary Table S2 ), and they are not detected in healthy controls (14, 15, (17) (18) (19) 34, 35) .\n\nCellular inclusions containing RAN-translation products are present in tissues that are affected in SCA8, DM1, FXTAS and ALS/FTD. In SCA8, the most abundant polyAla was found to form inclusions in the remaining Purkinje cells in human autopsy samples, whereas in the mouse disease model, the inclusions were found throughout the cerebellum in dendrites and in Purkinje cells, as detected by immunostaining with antibodies to the putative SCA8-polyAla protein (14) . In DM1, inclusions of RANtranslation products formed nuclear polyGln aggregates that are detected in patients' blood at higher frequency than in myoblasts and skeletal muscle; in DM1 transgenic mice, such inclusions are more abundant in leukocytes than in cardiac myocytes (14) . In FXTAS patients, RAN-translated products were found to form Gly-positive inclusions that accumulate in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex, whereas in a mouse model of the disease, polyGly aggregated in the hypothalamus, cortex and brainstem (16) . Interestingly, in FXTAS, these inclusions were ubiquitinpositive. Although in SCA8 and DM1, only the most expressed RAN-translation products were found to aggregate, in C9ALS/FTD, all possible DRPs from either sense or antisense transcripts have been detected in inclusions that exhibit dot-like and star-like shapes (Supplementary Table  S2 ). DPRs were present in the patient tissues and in cells of C9ALS/FTD experimental models and were restricted to neurons, being highly abundant in neocortical regions, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, more variable in the striatum and substantia nigra and rare or absent in the medulla and spinal cord (15, (17) (18) (19) 22, (31) (32) (33) 36, 37) . These aggregates colocalize with inclusions that are positive for p62 and negative for phospho-TDP-43, a classical molecular feature of C9ORF72 mutation carriers (19, 22, 32) .\n\nThe discovery of RAN translation may challenge the common dogma that the toxicity of noncoding repeat disorders is exclusively caused by mutant transcripts. What are the arguments indicating that RAN-translated products are relevant or irrelevant to neurodegeneration? The majority of data against the toxicity of RAN proteins originate from work on C9ALS/FTD. First, no correlation between the neuroanatomical distribution of DPR inclusions and the degree of degeneration in different regions of the central nervous system in C9ALS/FTD was reported (32) , and tissues containing DPRs showed no signs of cell loss or other apparent symptoms of neurodegeneration (31) . Second, RAN translation-related pathology was less frequently detected or absent in lower motor neurons in the spinal cord, the area affected in ALS (15, 22, 32) . However, as suggested, this result may be a consequence of increased cell death and atrophy in this region, resulting in a reduced number of cells available for analysis. Additionally, the levels of RAN-translated proteins and their capacity to form aggregates may be lower in the spinal cord (15), or even not observed in iPSC-derived motor neurons (38) . Third, despite the outstay of RAN-translated proteins, the toxic phenotype of human C9ORF72 iPSC-derived neurons was rescued upon antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment (20) . As reported by Donnelly et al., treatment of these cells with ASO efficiently abrogated known pathogenic features of C9ALS/FTD, such as intranuclear G 4 C 2 repeat RNA foci formation, ADARB2 protein sequestration, deregulated gene expression and susceptibility to glutamate toxicity; however, this treatment did not affect the level of the polyGlyPro dipeptide.\n\nThe arguments in favor of RAN-translation product toxicity derive primarily from work describing signs of cell death in the presence of non-AUG-originated proteins (14, 16) . Ranum et al. reported that cultured murine neuroblastoma cells transfected with SCA8 expanded CAG repeat constructs expressing polyGln, polyAla and polySer proteins triggered apoptosis, as shown by increased annexin-V staining (14) . Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the colocalization of caspase-8, an early indicator of apoptosis, with polyGln aggregates in the skeletal muscles of DM1 patients and in leukocytes from DM1 mice. Enhanced cell death was also observed in mammalian HEK293T cells transfected with G 4 C 2 constructs expressing polyProArg and polyGlyPro proteins (14) and in COS7 cells transfected with FXTAS CGG repeat plasmids expressing the polyGly protein (16) . Additionally, in a Drosophila model of FX-TAS, the presence of the RAN-translated polyGly protein was accompanied by rough-eye phenotype, which is a manifestation of toxicity in flies (16) .\n\nA very recent study demonstrated that synthetic (GlyArg) 20 and (ProArg) 20 dipeptides encoded by sense and antisense C9ORF72 repeats, respectively, are toxic to cells. These dipeptides have ability to enter cells, migrate to nucleus, bind to nucleoli and induce cell death. The ProArg dipeptide toxicity manifests in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing similar to that observed in ALS patients, and in alteration of ribosomal RNA biogenesis (39) .\n\nIt is also known from HD studies that toxicity of polyQexpanded Htt depends on its subcellular localization, and the cell nucleus is the primary site of pathogenesis (40, 41) . The RAN-translated proteins accumulate in the cell nucleus and the question may be asked whether they may trigger similar mechanisms of pathogenesis by recruiting essential nuclear proteins and compromising their functions?\n\nThe occurrence of RAN translation across relatively short repeats raises questions about their involvement in the pathogenesis of SCA8, DM1, FXTAS and C9ALS/FTD and may indicate a normal physiological function. According to the hypothesis that protein inclusions may protect cells from toxic misfolded proteins (42, 43) , it has been postulated that aggregates formed by RAN-translated proteins might not be the primary toxic agents per se but that soluble precursors of these proteins might be the causative pathogenic species (15, 32) . However, determination of the physiological function of RAN-translation products awaits further investigation.\n\nThe translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs is initiated via the cap-dependent scanning mechanism, which employs the 43S pre-initiation complex loaded with several protein factors. The complex proceeds in a 3 direction until it encounters the first AUG codon in a Kozak consensus sequence (24) . These canonical rules seem not to apply to RAN translation, and it currently remains unclear what forces the synthesis of homoproteins by ribosome and exactly where the process starts. One hypothesized trigger is an RNA structure formed by the repeats that, in fact, features in all RANtranslated sequences reported thus far ( Figure 1 ). As described, the hairpin structure-forming CAG repeats are efficiently RAN translated, in contrast to CAA repeats that do not form hairpins (14) . CGG repeats of the FMR1 transcript are also RAN translated; these repeats form hairpins (44) that are able to fold into G-quadruplex structures under specific conditions (45, 46) . The sense G 4 C 2 repeats of C9ALS/FTD also fold into G-quadruplexes that are not detected at the antisense C 4 G 2 repeats of the C9, which, however, may fold into hairpins (47) . As these structures show different stability, and because hairpins are less stable than G-quadruplexes, this phenomenon may affect the expression levels of RAN-translation products and their variety from repeat-harboring transcripts (15, 17, 19) .\n\nBecause the precise involvement of RNA structures in RAN translation needs further investigation, the question has arisen whether these repeat sequences act as IRES to initiate RAN translation via a cap-independent mechanism. Such a scenario was suggested because hairpin-and G-quadruplex-forming repeats might mimic IRES structures, and the 5 region preceding the CGG repeats of the FMR1 transcript had previously been identified to function as an IRES and a site of ribosome pausing (48) . Based on such factors as dependence on canonical eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), the proposed secondary structure, start codon localization and ability of the IRES to function in a cell-free system with or without supplementa-Nucleic Acids Research, 2014, Vol. 42, No. 19 11853 tion, known viral IRES were divided into four groups. Initiation on types I and II typically requires most canonical initiation factors including eIF3, eIF4A and the Cterminal domain of eIF4G in addition to the eIF2-Met-tRNA i Met -GTP ternary complex. In contrast, type III IRES directly attach the 43S complex to the initiation codon independently of eIF4F, eIF4B, eIF1 and eIF1, whereas type IV IRES initiate without eIFs or Met-tRNA i Met (49, 50) . Of the four known IRES-initiated translation mechanisms used by viruses, only type IV is both cap-independent and AUG-independent and thus could explain certain features of RAN translation initiation. The three other types of viral IRES mechanisms require an AUG codon and thus fail to explain why RAN translation produces proteins in multiple frames. With all these uncertainties, it seems that an alternative, as yet unknown mechanism may govern translation initiation at expanded RNA repeats.\n\nThe exact sites of RAN translation initiation at expansions of CAG, CGG, G 4 C 2 and C 4 G 2 repeats are unknown and may differ among repeats and reading frames. For CAG repeats in SCA8, RAN translation in the polyGln frame initiates at or near the start of the repeats, independently of an upstream AUG codon, whereas in the GCA frame encoding polyAla, it initiates at various sites throughout the length of the repeats (14) . For CGG repeats in FXTAS, this atypical translation was shown to start between the 21st and 12th nucleotide 5 of the repeats for the polyGly reading frame, was sensitive to stop codons when placed just proximal to the repeats and required an upstream AUG-like codon such as GUG. By contrast, polyAla formation arose independently of AUG-like codons and was insensitive to stop codon insertion 5 of the repeats (16) . For G 4 C 2 hexanucleotides in C9ALS/FTD, the exact start of RAN translation is also unknown, but its termination does not necessarily occur on the repeats. As it has been demonstrated for polyGlyAla and polyGlyArg frames, at least a fraction of RAN translation products are extended beyond the repeats into the 3 region (22) . Consequently, the length of some RAN-translated proteins may depend on the position of the stop codon in a particular frame.\n\nThe sequences adjacent to repeats may affect the RAN translation ability or efficiency, as demonstrated by Ranum et al., who used HEK293T cells transfected with constructs containing 20 bp of the 5 endogenous flanking sequence upstream of the CAG repeats at the HD, HDL2, DM1 and SCA3 loci (14) . In this system, the products of RAN translation in the polyGln frame, which were abundant in the SCA8 context, were expressed at lower levels in the HD, HDL2, SCA3 and DM1 sequence contexts. In addition, the process of RAN translation of these constructs appeared to be less prevalent when studied in the cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, indicating specific protein requirements. When tested in a noncellular environment, RAN translation was also shown to be sensitive to the presence of alternative start codons (14) . Together, these results suggest the importance of particular RNA structures, AUGlike codons and specific cellular proteins for RAN translation, whose efficiency varies for repeats occurring in different gene contexts and cellular habitats.\n\nThe generation of homopolymeric or dipeptide repeat RAN-translated proteins has thus far been observed at repeats located in noncoding regions of a few genes, including ATXN8 and 3'UTR of DMPK and 5 UTRs of FMR1 and C9ORF72. Is this repeat location preferred for RAN translation? Might repeats genetic location influence RAN initiation, and could this process also occur in repeats located in ORFs?\n\nThe RNA structures formed by the repeats are recognized as potential triggers when trying to decode the mechanism of RAN translation initiation. Their formation and stability affect the abundance of RAN-translated products. For longer repeats that have a more stable RNA structure, increased RAN-translated protein levels were detected (14, 51) . It is known that repeats that undergo RAN translation can form hairpin or G-quadruplex structures, which have different molecular architecture and stability ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2 ). Our previous in vitro analysis of RNA structures formed by different triplet motifs revealed the following order of hairpin stability: CGG > CAG > CUG > CCG (52) . The crystallographic structures of CNG repeat duplexes (N = A,U,G,C) showed distortions of their double-stranded helices caused by noncanonical N-N base pairs, implying both similarities and differences in protein binding by repeat hairpins (53) (54) (55) . In addition, we have demonstrated that in certain repeat containing transcripts, e.g. HTT/HD, AR/SBMA and CACNA1/SCA6, the repeat flanking sequences may contribute to hairpin stability (56) . Additionally, the presence of interruptions in repeat tracts strongly influences the stability of the hairpin structure they adopt (57) . Could such properties determine RAN translation process intensity in different disease models? The available data show differences in RAN translation efficiency between the C9ORF72 antisense and sense transcripts, in which C 4 G 2 repeats adopt hairpin structures, whereas G 4 C 2 repeats may also fold into more stable G-quadruplex structures (47) . The intramolecular G-quadruplexes are adopted by RNA motifs having the following consensuses sequence G 3+ N 1\u22127 G 3+ N 1\u22127 G 3+ N 1\u22127 G 3+ (N represent any nucleotide, 3+ means 3 and more and 1\u22127 means number ranging from 1 to 7). The stability of these structures depends on several factors including the presence of potassium ions, number of consecutive guanines and separating nucleotides between G-tracts (58, 59) . Thus RAN translation from the latter transcript adopting G-quadruplex structure seems to be more robust (15, 17, 22) . For this same reason, normal CGG repeats of sense FMR1 transcripts might undergo the noncanonical translation that typically occurs on expanded repeats. Interestingly, the presence of a G-quadruplex in the 5 UTRs was demonstrated to impair cap-dependent translation, promoting cap-independent translation, as G-quadruplexes were revealed to be structural components of some human IRES sequences (60) .\n\nNucleic Acids Research, 2014, Vol. 42, No. 19 11855 Could any other features of transcripts undergoing RAN translation be considered to explain the process of noncanonical protein synthesis? Our in silico structure prediction of expanded repeats along with their flanking regions (Figure 1 ) revealed the presence of modifying factors that may potentially stimulate or inhibit RAN translation. The stimulatory factors may include additional hairpin stabilization by repeat flanking sequences (e.g. additional extension of (CGG)n hairpin by S-FMR1 flanking sequences (Figure 1b) ), AUG START codons and various AUG-like codons (CUG, GUG, UUG, AUA, ACG and AUU which differ from AUG by a single base only (61)). Whereas inhibitory factors may comprise STOP codons (UAG, UAA, UGA) in different reading frames. How significant is the presence of alternative START codons for RAN translation initiation, and do STOP codons that may abolish the influence of AUG-like codons in the same frame play a role? These sequences were found to occur with different frequencies in the analyzed transcripts, and their relation to RAN translation efficiency should be carefully examined. At first glance, in the sense C9 transcript, an alternative START codon upstream of the G 4 C 2 repeats that is not followed by STOP in the polyGlyAla frame ( Figure 1c) does not affect the abundance of RAN proteins in this frame (15) . Similarly, a STOP codon located directly before the G 4 C 2 repeats in the polyGlyPro frame does not seem to disturb protein expression in this frame. In the antisense C9 transcript, we found only one AUG-like codon in close proximity to the hexanucleotide repeats (Figure 1d ), but two additional start codons are present >100 nt upstream of the repeats (15) . Despite these differences in the frequency of potential stimulatory and inhibitory factors of RAN translation, both sense and antisense C9 transcripts undergo RAN translation; however, the intensity of this phenomenon is higher for the sense transcript (15, 17, 22) .\n\nSimilarly, in a few other transcripts with expanded repeats associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, we observe various representations of modifying factors that may potentially stimulate or inhibit RAN translation (Supplementary Figures S2a-w) regardless of whether the repeats are located in noncoding or coding portions of the diseases-causing genes. Structure prediction and sequence analysis reveal some extra stabilization of repeat hairpins by the flanking sequences but do not show substantial differences in the abundance of AUG-like codons in the analyzed transcripts when compared with transcripts proven to be RAN translated (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure  S2) . Interestingly, we have observed a general tendency for a higher abundance of AUG-like codons in the antisense transcripts than in their sense counterparts. These results suggest that other transcripts with expanded and structureforming repeats may also be subject to RAN translation.\n\nCanonical translation initiation is a complex process requiring more than ten initiation factors ( Figure 2) (23,24) . However, under certain cellular conditions such as viral infection, protein synthesis might be switched to another mode and proceed with minimal involvement of the translation machinery (62) . Depending on the mode of RAN translation initiation, different sets of protein factors may be involved (Figure 2 ). In a cap-dependent scanning mechanism, the utilization of a full set of initiation machinery might be perturbed when the scanning ribosome stalls at a highly structured obstacle of expanded repeats with bound proteins (Figure 2a) . Because this stalling could force the scanning ribosome to pause, various proteins attached to structured RNA and proteins of the scanning complex might be rearranged, triggering noncanonical translation initiation at non-AUG codons. It is plausible that such perturbation could involve the eIF1 initiation factors, including eIF1A, which plays a critical role in the fidelity of start codon selection (23, 24) . Another candidate to consider is eIF2, whose function is to deliver Met-tRNA i Met to the ribosome. There is evidence of eIF2-independent translation under stress conditions (63) (64) (65) (66) (67) . As reported, RAN translation does not require an AUG codon, which implies that tRNAs charged with amino acids other than methionine are involved in translation initiation (14) . Moreover, one of the translation initiation factors, eIF2D, can direct tRNA Phe to the P-site of the ribosome to initiate translation (65) . A distinct set of proteins may be considered in the context of direct recruitment of the ribosome to structures formed by the expanded repeats (Figure 2b ). One possible scenario is that the structured expanded repeats bind the small ribosomal subunit in the absence of initiation factors, but RAN translation still requires eIF3 and eIF2-GTP for initiation, as shown for viral IRES type III (49, 50) . Another scenario involves the steps and factors described for viral IRES type IV (49, 50) , in which RAN protein synthesis is initiated with minimal involvement of the translation machinery, assuming that the structures formed by expanded repeats are tightly folded and structurally mimic the missing initiation factors. In contrast to viral IRES, their cellular counterparts are less understood, more diverse in their structure and less stable (67) . Taken together, the available data remain insufficient to answer the question of whether IRES mechanisms are indeed involved in RAN translation.\n\nSimilarly, it should be established whether repeat binding proteins, such as MBNL, which are known to localize in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (68) (69) (70) , play a role in RAN translation. The question of whether these proteins participate directly in the initiation event or facilitate recruitment of key initiation factors to the expanded repeats still needs to be answered.\n\nCould global translation attenuation and cellular stress conditions permit RAN translation? (71) (72) (73) (74) . It is known that IRES-dependent translation occurs preferentially under cellular stress conditions such as growth, mitosis, apoptosis or viral infection, in which global cap-dependent translation is compromised (62) and is accompanied by the proteolysis of eIF4G and changes in the phosphorylation levels of eIF4E-binding proteins and eIF2A (24, 75) . Furthermore, stress might trigger post-translational modifications There are at least two translation initiation mechanisms: a canonical cap-dependent mechanism described in Eukaryotes and a cap-independent type IV IRES-dependent mechanism described in Dicistroviridae viruses. In the cap-dependent mechanism of translation initiation, the initiator tRNA is delivered to the ribosome as a ternary complex with eIF2 and GTP, and then, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5 and eIF3 initiation factors promote binding to form a 43S pre-initiation complex. This complex binds to the mRNA through its interaction with the capbinding complex, which consists of eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A and eIF4B factors, and begins scanning for the start codon. In cap-independent/IRES-dependent translation initiation, highly structured type IV IRES, which does not require initiation factors, operates essentially as an all RNA-based ribosome recruitment apparatus; the IRES position of pseudoknot I mimics the initiator tRNA codon/anti-codon interaction that results in an initiation at the non-AUG codon. This type of translation initiation requires the interaction between IRES and ribosomal proteins RPS25 and RPS5. RAN translation is initiated by repeat-forming RNA structures. These structures could bind various proteins, including specific repeat binding proteins, translation initiation factors and other regulatory proteins. The riboprotein complex may resemble a translation initiation unit and trigger translation initiation in the absence of an AUG start codon. Thus, RAN translation might occur via a cap-dependent scanning mechanism (a) and/or as a result of IRES-like ribosome recruitment (b). In (a), the scanning ribosome approaches a repeat hairpin that results in the stalling of the pre-initiation complex. This forces an unspecific interaction between hairpin proteins and the pre-initiation complex and/or dissociation of some translation initiation factors that may result in noncanonical translation initiation at non-AUG codons . In (b) , a direct recruitment of the ribosome to hairpin-associated protein complex results in unspecific translation initiation, similar to what is proposed in (a), with the use of codons other than AUG.\n\nof ITAFs, affecting both their subcellular localization and IRES-binding affinity, thus modulating their activity (67) .\n\nIt has been reported that the expression of transcripts harboring expanded CUG, CCUG, CAG and G 4 C 2 repeats can cause cellular stress conditions mediated through the inhibition of protein translation, as demonstrated in DM1 and DM2 (71, 72) , and by triggering nucleolar stress, as shown in SCA3, HD and C9ALS/FTD (76) (77) (78) . Such stress conditions could affect the post-translational modification of proteins involved in translation initiation, leading to faulty functioning, which is then reflected in altered RNA-binding affinity that can trigger RAN protein synthesis.\n\nA decade before RAN translation was discovered, Rouleau et al. proposed that frameshifting within expanded CAG repeats of the ATXN3 gene resulted in the production of a polyAla-containing protein, which forms intranuclear inclusions contributing to toxicity (27) . Six years later Davies and Rubinsztein demonstrated that this phenomenon is not restricted to SCA3 and occurs also in translation of the HTT gene, which is responsible for HD (29) . Frameshifting one nucleotide downstream ((\u22121) frame) or one nucleotide upstream ((+1) frame) during translation results in the generation of a new protein, and in addition to the polyGln encoded by the (0) CAG frame, the polyAla and polySer proteins can be produced from the (\u22121) GCA frame and the (+1) AGC frame, respectively. Do they add novel toxic elements to the established toxicity of the expanded polyGln proteins, thus participating in polyGln disorder pathogenesis? What is the role of CAG repeats in the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting? These and other emerging questions are addressed in this chapter.\n\nTranslational frameshifting within the ATXN3 and HTT transcripts occurs both in vitro and in vivo. Frameshifted species containing polyAla tracts have been detected in the brain and lymphoblastoid cells of SCA3 patients as well as in transgenic Drosophila models and in various mammalian cells that have been transfected either with full-length or truncated ATXN3 sequence with expanded CAG repeats (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure S3 ) (26) (27) (28) . In the case of HD, frameshift products that contain polyAla or polySer tracts were observed in postmortem brains of HD patients and in transgenic HD mice (HD-N171-N82Q) (29) . Only polyAla-containing proteins were observed in other studies where two different cell lines, neuroblastoma N2a and epithelial HeLa cells, were transfected with the CAG repeat of Htt exon 1 (Supplementary Table S3 ) (30) . Immunodetection with specific C-terminal antibodies accompanied by Western blotting was mostly used to detect abnormal SCA3 proteins. In the case of HD, valuable information concerning the mechanism of frameshifting was also obtained with the use of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) (30) . Frameshifting occurred with an equal stochastic probability at any CAG codon within the expanded CAG repeat, giving rise to proteins with various hybrid polyGln/polyAla stretches (30) . As shown by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, frameshifted proteins formed in N2a cells expressing Htt51Q contained Gln:Ala ratios ranging from Gln1:Ala49 to Gln48:Ala2 in their repeat tract. This finding indicates that a (\u22121) frameshift can occur at any CAG codon within the CAG stretch, and its frequency is modulated by the number of CAG codons to be translated (30) .\n\nThe frequency of frameshifting along the expanded CAG tract of ATXN3 and HTT is dependent on repeat length, and the formation of intranuclear inclusions containing frameshifted proteins increases with the number of repeats (26, 27, 30) . In SCA3 patients, protein aggregates were observed with \u226575 CAGs, whereas in transfected COS7 cells, they were abundant after protein expression from a construct containing 82 CAGs and rare from a construct containing at 37 CAGs. In the case of the shortest constructs, with 14 CAGs, whether frameshifting products were observed depended on the detection method (Supplementary  Table S3 and Figure S3 ) (27) . Interestingly, not all polyGlnpositive cells contained frameshifted proteins; however, the frequency of such cells increased dramatically as the CAG repeat length increased (26) . Flanking sequences do not influence frameshifting within the mutant ATXN3 transcript (27) .\n\nFrameshifting frequency also depends on the experimental model, with higher frequencies in transfected cells compared with in vivo models. Frameshifted products were observed in intranuclear aggregates within the caudate/putamen of brains from HD patients and in the cortex of HD transgenic mice (29) . However, frameshiftpositive aggregates represented a mere 4% of the total huntingtin-positive inclusions, as demonstrated in the mouse cortex via double immunofluorescence. As a result of occurrence at low level, no frameshift products were detected on western blots of murine brains. Frameshifted huntingtin was also not detected in stable, inducible PC12 cells even after expression of an Htt exon 1 Q74 fragment for 1 month, when the vast majority of cells contained Htt-Gln aggregates as detected by immunocytochemistry (Supplementary Table S3 ). This result suggests that huntingtin frameshifting is time-dependent and occurs at low levels. When N2a cells stably expressing Htt exon 1 with Q65 fragments were additionally transfected with constructs containing 51 CAG repeats, the frequency of frameshifting was >60% (30) .\n\nIt was demonstrated that (\u22121) frameshifting does not occur within long glutamine coding CAA repeats unlike the case for long CAG repeats. Therefore, no alterations in nuclear morphology were observed upon expression of long CAA repeats, while COS 1 cells transfected with the (CAG)78 repeat displayed an altered morphology and exhibited vacuolization that was preferentially associated with cytoplasmic protein accumulation (26) . Consistent with these data, Stochmanski et al. determined that in a Drosophila model of SCA3, replacing the CAG92 repeat tract with CAA96 eliminated overt phenotypic anomalies that were characterized by disruption of morphology and pigmentation of the eyes (28) . Both CAG and CAA repeats encode glutamine and differ only in their ability to form hairpin structures, which may suggest that this factor is required for frameshifting.\n\nIn contrast to RAN translation, there are more premises that polyAla-containing proteins produced during frameshifting are cytotoxic. In both SCA3 and HD, frameshifted proteins are present in cells harboring polyQ aggregates and contribute to cell toxicity by changing cell morphology and inducing cell death. They accumulate in intranuclear inclusions and can also be found as perinuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates that colocalize with ubiquitin, a well-known component of protein inclusions in polyGln disorders (73) .\n\nFrameshifted polyAla proteins apparently add to polyGln toxicity in cells with expanded CAG repeats. In contrast to the slow, progressive accumulation that has been detected for CAG/Gln constructs, transfection with GCA/Ala constructs results in an early and rapid accumulation of Ala-containing products and a more severe phenotype. The presence of a transgene expressing the polyAla tract without the context of the ataxin-3 protein is sufficient for aggregate formation, which produces a toxic phenotype. It has been shown that (\u22121) frameshifting events and the concomitant production of polyAla-containing ataxin-3 are key factors that contribute to toxic eye phenotype development, as observed in the Drosophila model of SCA3. The in vivo expression of the polyGln-containing ataxin-3 alone was not sufficient to cause a degenerative phenotype in the fly (28) .\n\nFrameshifted (\u22121) Htt products containing polyGln/polyAla tracts interacted with nonframeshifted HttGln proteins and caused marked changes in their aggregation with expanded polyGln both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect depended strongly on the Gln:Ala ratio (30) . In vitro-formed inclusions (in N2a and HeLa cells) were either ring-shaped and surrounded the core huntingtin (Htt103Gln) aggregates or were dense and punctate, which appeared in the vicinity of the ring inclusions but did not fuse with them. Both types of inclusions contained frameshifted species and were frequently located in the vicinity of cytoplasmic or nuclear membranes. Certain perinuclear aggregates formed local hollows in the nuclear membrane, altering its structure (30) .\n\nWhat is the role of the frameshifted species generated in SCA3 and HD, and are they relevant to the pathogenesis of these diseases? Previously, both polySer-and polyAlacontaining proteins were shown to be modifiers of mutant huntingtin toxicity (79) . It was also proposed that translational frameshifting within expanded CAG stretches may contribute to the observed variations in HD course and onset, leading to cell-selective neurotoxicity on both the cellular and organismal levels. This phenomenon could at least partially account for the degeneration of selective neuronal populations in patients, although the disease-related polyQ proteins are widely expressed. Furthermore, tissue-specific variations in polyQ length may contribute to cell-selective pathogenesis because the CAG stretch is several repeats longer in the brain than in other tissues even within a single individual (80, 81) , and the frequency of frameshifting increases with repeat length. Taken together, frameshifted proteins are important factors that contribute to polyGln aggregate toxicity.\n\nSince the discovery of CAG repeat frameshifting, important questions regarding its frequency, mechanism and role in pathogenesis have arisen. These questions include the following: What triggers the frameshifting? Does it depend on the length of the CAG repeat encoding the polyQ stretch? Is it cell-type specific? Is frameshifting limited only to SCA3 and HD? How do the frameshifted species modulate the aggregation of the remaining pool of proteins with expanded polyQ tracts? What is the precise effect of the frameshifted proteins on the well-acknowledged toxicity of polyGlnbearing proteins?\n\nProgrammed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a common mechanism that increases the protein-coding capacity of small genomes such as viruses and mitochondria. Frameshifting events were also observed in the case of some mammalian genes (82, 83) . Three elements within mRNA have been shown to be required for the efficient induction of (\u22121) PRF: a 7-nt slippery sequence (84), a short 5-12 nt spacer and a stimulatory structure that can be a pseudoknot, hairpin structure, G-quadruplex (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) or mRNA duplex formed with the antisense oligonucleotide (90) . The nature of the slippery sequence facilitates slippage of the tRNAs within the P and A sites on the mRNA, whereas the stimulatory structure provides an energetic barrier that causes an elongating ribosome to pause on the slippery sequence. Several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of (\u22121) PRF (91) (92) (93) (94) , and it seems that structural elements of mRNA play an important role in this process, e.g. the stability of the first 3 or 4 bp at the base of the hairpin stem was shown to be critical for shifting the ribosome by these structures (87, 95) . Jacks et al. proposed 'the two tRNA simultaneous slippage model,' in which the shift occurs after delivery of the aa-tRNA to the A site but before peptidyl transfer (91) . A downstream stimulatory motif inhibits the EF2-driven movement of the ribosome. The resulting tension is relieved by unpairing of the aa-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNAs from the mRNA, slipping of the mRNA by one base and re-pairing of the tRNAs in the (\u22121) frame (91, 92, 96) . A second model proposed by Weiss et al. assumes that (\u22121) PRF occurs during the translocation step (85, 97) . Briefly, after peptide bond formation, the deacetylated-tRNA and the peptidyl-tRNAs occupy, respectively, the P/E and A/P sites. They can unpair from the mRNA due to the physical barrier formed by the stimulatory structure, move, and re-pair in the new reading frame. In the third model, the (\u22121) PRF is triggered by incomplete translocation and depends on the interactions of tRNAs with the A, P and E sites on the ribosome (93) .\n\nIt remains to be established whether frameshifting on CAG repeats results from an incomplete 2-base translo-Nucleic Acids Research, 2014, Vol. 42, No. 19 11859 cation event ((+2) frameshifting) or ribosome slippage by one base in the 5 direction ((\u22121) frameshifting). Both these processes generate the same GCA frame encoding alanine; however, different nomenclature used by the authors may be confusing. Because frameshifting has been shown to occur in both SCA3 and HD, the most straightforward explanation is that the CAG repeat sequences of, respectively, ATXN3 and HTT are particularly susceptible to such repositions of reading frames, as experimental evidence demonstrated a higher frequency of frameshifting on longer repeats of both transcripts (26, (28) (29) (30) . However, as the structural requirements of RNA that induce frameshifting are not sufficiently known, it seems plausible that the hairpin structures formed by elongated CAG repeats of ATXN3 and HTT (Figure 3 ) (98-100) may serve as frameshifting stimulatory sequences, leading to ribosome pausing ( Figure 4 ). Pseudoknots are a common type of stimulatory motif, but hairpin structures are also used by some viruses, e.g. HIV-1 (101, 102) . During translation elongation on expanded CAG repeat tracts, multiple hairpin structures may fold and unfold by moving the ribosomal complex. In investigating mechanisms of ribosomal frameshifting within repeated sequences, it would be interesting to determine whether the influence of CAA interruptions which are known to alter structure of CAG repeat hairpins (57) affects the frameshifting frequency.\n\nAnother explanation of frameshifting might rely on ribosomal slippage and the occurrence of slippery sequences within ATXN3 and HTT transcripts ( Figure 3 ) (103) . However, as frameshifting occurs stochastically at any CAG codon within the repeat stretch, as demonstrated in HD (30) , it seems unlikely that slippery sequences proceeding a repeat tract play a mechanistic role as a trigger of changes in reading frames. Is it possible that CAG repeats themselves act as unusual slippery sequences? Viral slippery sequences composed of the heptameric motif N NNW WWH (IUPAC) enable repairing of the nonwobble bases of both the aa-tRNAs and peptidyl-tRNAs with the (\u22121) codons (104) . In light of this fact, it remains a mystery what factors would help to maintain interactions between the frameshifted 5 GCA3 codon and the 5 CUG3 anticodon, where no Watson-Crick pairs would be possible (Figure 4 ) (103) .\n\nRecently, new experimental evidence on the mechanism of frameshifting at expanded CAG repeats has been published (30) . The formation of various transframe-encoded species generated via frameshifting at long CAG repeats in HD is proposed to be a consequence of a depletion of the charged glutaminyl-transfer RNA tRNAGln-CUG that pairs exclusively with the CAG codons. It has been shown that the amount of tRNAGln decreases with increasing length of the encoded CAG sequences (hungry codons), and in N2A cells expressing 65 or 103 CAG repeats, a significant increase in the frequency of frameshifting was observed from, respectively, 60 to 80%. Moreover, the frameshifting frequency varies among different cell lines. In N2a cells and HeLa cells, which differ in their intrinsic concentration of tRNAGln-CUG, the higher frameshifting frequency occurs in the N2a cells, which have a lower amount of tRNAGln-CUG than the HeLa cell line (Supplementary Table S3 ). Interestingly, the concentration of tRNAGln-CUG also differs among different brain areas, and as shown in HD mice, the tRNAGln-CUG concentration is lower in the striatal and hippocampal tissues than in the cortical and cerebellar regions (30) . This fact raises the interesting question of whether tRNAGln-CUG levels also vary among different brain tissues in HD patients, thus contributing to the cellselective pathology of the disease. Because the most prominent early effects in HD have been observed in the striatum, even though striatal neurons do not selectively express higher levels of HTT mRNA (105) , this possibility could provide a mechanistic explanation of the selective pathology and importantly disclose a new therapeutic target. However, this issue remains to be examined. The mechanism of frameshifting in SCA3 and HD seems to be more similar to viral \u22121 PRF since mostly polyAlacontaining proteins are generated. However, we cannot exclude +1 PRF events, as observed in Escherichia coli and yeasts (106) (107) (108) , because polySer-containing proteins were detected in HD (29) . The +1 PRF is also enhanced by the presence of 'hungry codons' in the A site (109, 110) . This information would support the idea suggesting that depletion of cognate charged tRNAGln-CUG is a cause of frameshifting within Htt transcript, however polySer proteins resulting from +1 frameshifting were much rarely detected in this study (30) .\n\nWhether elongated CAG repeats act as slippery or stimulatory sequences or both remains to be determined. Nonetheless, the information gathered thus far seems to confirm the role of CAG repeats in generating frameshifted proteins because the frequency of frameshifted events increases with the length of the CAG tract; long CAA repeats that do not form hairpins do not give rise to frameshifted proteins; frameshifting events can occur at every position within the CAG tract; frameshifting is cell-and tissue-type dependent and (v) frameshifted proteins are toxic to cells and affect polyQ aggregation kinetics. It is possible that frameshifting is a more widespread phenomenon and also occurs on the expanded CAG repeats involved in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, DRPLA and SBMA. Experiments with the use of dedicated antibodies (allowing the detection of Ala ((\u22121) frame) and Ser ((+1) frame)-containing proteins) could clarify this matter.\n\nAs discussed in this review, mounting evidence demonstrates that simple repeat expansions causing several human neurological diseases trigger noncanonical translation initiation and elongation, and two unusual processes, RAN translation and frameshifting, are recognized across the repeats. Protein products of RAN translation and frameshifting were detected in patient tissues and in mouse and Drosophila models of the disorders in addition to numerous human cell lines after transfection with specific constructs. However, the methods used to study these processes and detect their products have limitations that give raise to concerns and further questions. For example, it cannot be excluded that some antibodies used to detect specific RAN translation or frameshifting products may recognize both entities. Thus, the results obtained with commonly used immunological methods need to be confirmed by other methods such as MS. Strong promoters used in genetic constructs may explain the higher frequency of frameshifting observed in cellular models compared with patient tissues as well as detection of RAN translation and frameshifting products in disease models expressing nonpathological numbers of repeats.\n\nAlthough RAN translation and frameshifting are linked to distinct translation steps, they demonstrate several common features. The most evident is the requirement for structured repeat tracts, dependence on the repeated sequence length, production of proteins in various frames and formation of intracellular inclusions. Among their distinctive feature is the fact that RAN translation has been demonstrated only at sequences that were considered previously to be noncoding, whereas evidence for frameshifting on expanded repeats has been described for coding sequences. In spite of the fact that some features regarding RAN translation and frameshifting have been already revealed, their exact mechanism remains elusive.\n\nAnother unresolved issue is whether RAN translation and frameshifting products are toxic to cells. In the absence of more direct evidence, the inclusion bodies harboring RAN and frameshifted proteins detected in patient tissues, in addition to the decreased viability of cells transfected with constructs expressing RAN-translated and frameshifted proteins, is only suggestive of their toxicity.\n\nFinally, it is yet to be determined whether RAN translation is a unique phenomenon or noncanonical translation that gives rise to novel polypeptides and short proteins is more frequent in cells. Recent studies demonstrate that the human proteome contains a multitude of short ORFencoded peptides (SEPs), which share certain similarities with RAN-translated proteins (111, 112) . Certain SEPs have a regulatory function and affect protein expression by controlling translation re-initiation at downstream initiation codons and by activating the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (113) . On the other hand, various cryptic peptides, products of alternative translation initiation, act as alternative sources of antigens for major histocompatibility complex class I components (114, 115) . Whether such functions could be performed by RAN translation and frameshifting products is another issue to be addressed.\n\nSupplementary data are available at NAR Online. "}
