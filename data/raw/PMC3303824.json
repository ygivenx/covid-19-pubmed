{"title": "Both TLR2 and TRIF Contribute to Interferon-\u03b2 Production during Listeria Infection", "body": "Detection of microbial pathogens by pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers innate immune responses as a first line of defense against infections [1]\u2013[3]. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial cell walls and their structural components induce a vast variety of biological effects in host organisms. The innate response against infection with intracellular pathogens includes the synthesis of type I IFNs (IFN-I). Whereas this cytokine family generally protects against viruses, its impact on bacterial infections can be either detrimental or advantageous for the host organism [4].\n\n\nListeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) respond to cytosolic bacterial products and contribute to the induction of the innate immune response [5], [6]. Previous studies in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and epithelial cells show that in these cell types the synthesis of IFN-I in response to infection with L. monocytogenes is independent of TLRs and their adapters, relying exclusively on signals originating from cytosolic sensors [5]\u2013[8]. DNA as well as cyclic dinucleotides released from lysed bacteria were suggested to function as the relevant L. monocytogenes PAMPs [9]\u2013[11]. Several cytosolic proteins with the ability to sense pathogen-derived nucleic acids have recently been described [11]\u2013[19]. Cytosolic recognition of L. monocytogenes causes the activation of the serine/threonine kinase TBK1 and the phosphorylation of its substrate transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 [7], [8]. Both IRF3 and IRF7 participate in the formation of an enhanceosome at the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [20].\n\nDuring uptake by host cells L. monocytogenes is exposed to plasma membrane and endosomal TLRs. Among these, TLR2 which recognizes lipotechoic acids and lipopeptides, contributes to the innate response against infection [21]\u2013[23]. Reportedly, TLR2 signals through the interacting adapter proteins Mal/TIRAP and MyD88 and does not contribute to the synthesis of type I IFN in Listeria-infected BMM [7]\u2013[9]. Signaling through TRIF, an adapter protein known to connect TLRs 3 and 4 with the IFN-I genes was similarly ruled out for Listeria-infected BMM [7].\n\nIn order to establish a successful infection, pathogens must survive host defense systems or else mitigate the activities of PRRs. Consequently, they have evolved to modify the structural components which normally trigger PRR responses. Bacterial PGN is a hetero-polymer consisting of alternating residues of \u03b2-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid to which a peptide chain is attached [24]. Interestingly, L. monocytogenes modifies its PGN, with fifty per cent of the muropeptide composition being N-deacetylated [25]. We previously reported that a PGN N-deacetylase gene, pgdA, is responsible for this modification [25]. PGN deacetylation confers resistance to the action of lysozyme, one of the most important and widespread antimicrobial agents of the innate defense system, thus preventing degradation and release of immunostimulants. A strain of L. monocytogenes mutated in its ability to alter its PGN, \u0394pgdA, is sensitive to lysozyme and induces an enhanced IFN-\u03b2 response in macrophages compared to the isogenic parental strain [25].\n\nThe aim of the present study was to decipher the signaling pathways involved in this response to \u0394pgdA infection. We reveal that IFN-\u03b2 production in peritoneal macrophages requires TLR2 signaling and the TRIF adapter protein.\n\nA L. monocytogenes pgdA mutant induced a much higher IFN-\u03b2 response than the parental strain [25]. To definitively establish a role for the peptidoglycan deacetylase PgdA in the down-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 production, we complemented our original pgdA mutant with the wild-type gene and we measured IFN-\u03b2 secretion of peptone elicited peritoneal macrophages (PEM) infected with wild-type EGDe, \u0394pgdA and a complemented \u0394pgdA strain (Fig. 1). Inactivation of pgdA led to a strong induction of IFN-\u03b2 secretion in wild-type macrophages. In contrast, the complemented strain did not induce any massive IFN-\u03b2 secretion, similar to wild-type EGDe. Thus, PgdA directly contributes to down-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 production.\n\nConsistent with our previous report measuring secretion of IFN-\u03b2 protein in PEM, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis induced by L. monocytogenes infection of PEM required TLR2 (Fig. 2A), while TLR2-deficient BMM showed no impairment in their synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA (Fig. 2B). Moreover, IFN-\u03b2 secretion was strongly reduced in tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212 PEM infected with both the \u0394pgdA mutant (Fig. 2C) and the complemented \u0394pgdA strain (Fig. 2D), definitively establishing the TLR2 dependence of IFN-\u03b2 production.\n\nWe next analyzed the pathways by which Listeria induces IFN-\u03b2. Our previous study and the above results strongly suggested the critical involvement of TLR2 [25]. TLR2 signaling depends on Mal/TIRAP and MyD88 adaptor proteins. We had previously shown that MyD88 contributed to full IFN-\u03b2 induction by Listeria\n[25]. We then compared IFN-\u03b2 production by wild-type and mal/tirap\n\u2212/\u2212 macrophages infected with EGDe or \u0394pgdA (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, production of IFN-\u03b2 was not decreased in infected macrophages deficient in Mal/TIRAP, indicating that the normal TLR2 adaptor Mal/TIRAP was not required for Listeria-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2.\n\nThe adapter TRIF is employed by TLRs 3 and 4 to signal through the TBK1-IRF3/7-IFN-\u03b2 pathway. There is no previous evidence of an association or functional interaction between TRIF and TLR2. In spite of this, the link between TRIF and the IRF pathway on the one hand, and the unusual employment of TLR2 for signaling to the IFN-\u03b2 gene in PEM on the other suggested the possibility of a role for TRIF. To test this hypothesis we compared induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression in wild-type and trif\n\u2212/\u2212 PEM or BMM infected with EGDe or \u0394pgdA strains. IFN-\u03b2 induction strongly decreased in TRIF-deficient macrophages infected with any of the two Listeria strains compared to wild-type PEM, showing the requirement for TRIF (Fig. 3B). In contrast, BMM showed a TRIF-independent IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. S1).\n\nThe PEM used in our studies are recruited to the peritoneal cavity by injection of the sterile irritant proteose peptone. Hence they differ from BMM not only regarding their anatomical location, but also their partially inflammatory character. To distinguish which of these differences was responsible for the TLR2 and TRIF signaling pathways, we examined IFN-\u03b2 production by resident PEM. Figure 3C demonstrates a requirement for TLR2 and TRIF by the resident macrophage population. Thus, location to the peritoneal cavity rather than inflammatory character determines the difference in signaling to the IFN-\u03b2 gene between BMM and PEM.\n\nTo examine the role of TLR3, which uses TRIF to trigger IFN-\u03b2 synthesis, we compared induction of IFN-\u03b2 in wild-type and tlr3\u2212/\u2212 PEM infected with EGDe or \u0394pgdA strains. IFN-\u03b2 production was decreased in TLR3-deficient PEM infected with EGDe or \u0394pgdA (Fig. 4A). We also compared induction of IFN-\u03b2 in wild-type and tlr4\u2212/\u2212 PEM infected with EGDe or \u0394pgdA strains, as TLR4 can mediate TRIF-dependent synthesis of IFN-\u03b2. In contrast to TLR3-deficient PEM, TLR4-deficient PEM did not show a decrease in IFN-\u03b2 response to EGDe or \u0394pgdA (Fig. 4B). Thus, IFN-\u03b2 induction in response to Listeria infection relies in part on TLR3 and does not require TLR4.\n\nInduction of IFN-\u03b2 via TLR2 is no longer an exception. It has recently been shown that vaccinia virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production was dependent on TLR2 signaling and it was reported that this was occuring from late endosomes [26]. To investigate if an intracellular localization was also required in the case of Listeria, we pretreated cells with cytochalasin D to prevent internalization and measured IFN-\u03b2 secretion by macrophages infected with EGDe or the \u0394pgdA mutant (Fig. 5A). In both cases, IFN-\u03b2 induction was strongly reduced. Thus, internalization is critical for Listeria-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production. We also used dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor and chloroquine, which inhibits endosome acidification, and measured IFN-\u03b2 induction in macrophages infected with EGDe or the \u0394pgdA mutant (Fig. 5B\u2013C). IFN-\u03b2 synthesis was strongly diminished by both dynasore and chloroquine treatments. Together, these results suggest that the TLR2-dependent IFN-\u03b2 induction is triggered intracellularly.\n\nIn BMM rapid synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 is entirely dependent on IRF3, but not on IRF7, whereas in bone marrow-derived myeloid DC IFN-\u03b2 synthesis requires both IRF3 and IRF7 [27]. We investigated the role of IRF3 and IRF7 in the production of IFN-\u03b2 by PEM. To this end we infected irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 and irf7\n\u2212/\u2212 macrophages with EGDe or the \u0394pgdA strains. Inactivation of IRF3 totally abrogated IFN-\u03b2 mRNA induction in response to both strains (Fig. 6). IFN-\u03b2 induction in IRF7-deficient macrophages was also strongly affected highlighting the important role of both transcription factors in response to Listeria infection (Fig. 6). PEM thus resemble bone marrow-derived myeloid DC, not BMM, in relation to their IRF requirement for Listeria-mediated IFN-\u03b2 synthesis.\n\nIn addition to IRF3/7, NF\u03baB contributes to the formation of the IFN-\u03b2 enhanceosome [20], [28]. We therefore examined the involvement of the NF\u03baB pathway by measuring induced synthesis of an NF\u03baB-dependent mRNA. I\u03baB is an NF\u03baB-dependent gene and thus a read-out for NF\u03baB activation in response to Listeria infection. We measured the induction of I\u03baB expression in PEM infected with EGDe or the \u0394pgdA mutant. Both strains induced I\u03baB expression and this required internalization as treatment with dynasore reduced the level of I\u03baB induction (Fig. 7A). Degradation of the I\u03baB protein was examined in PEM infected with EGDe by immunoblot using anti-I\u03baB antibodies. I\u03baB level was reduced rapidly after infection of wild-type PEM (Fig. S2A). In contrast, I\u03baB degradation was not observed in tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212 PEM infected with Listeria (Fig. S2B). Infection of wild-type, tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212and trif\n\u2212/\u2212 macrophages with EGDe or \u0394pgdA showed that both TLR2 and the adaptor were required for full induction of I\u03baB mRNA in response to EGDe and \u0394pgdA strains (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that TLR2 and TRIF contribute to NF\u03baB activation. The comparison between EGDe and \u0394pgdA strains showed that both caused similar magnitudes of I\u03baB mRNA synthesis. Thus, the activation of NF\u03baB by Listeria is independent of PgdA, suggesting that the increased IFN-\u03b2 production after infection with \u0394pgdA relies on activation of other transcription factors such as IRFs.\n\nTLR2 or TRIF deficiency strongly reduced, but did not completely shut off IFN-\u03b2 synthesis. This suggested a potential contribution of intracellular, nucleic acid-dependent pathways to IFN-\u03b2 synthesis, particularly after infection with \u0394pgdA. We therefore examined whether these pathways are able to signal in PEM.\n\nSince inactivation of PgdA increases Listeria sensitivity to peptidoglycan-targeting antimicrobials such as lysozyme, and thus induces bacterial degradation, we measured the DNA and RNA released by EGDe and \u0394pgdA strains following lysozyme exposure. As expected, \u0394pgdA released significantly higher amounts of DNA and RNA than wild-type and complemented \u0394pgdA strains, raising the possibility that both DNA and RNA could be involved in IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 8A). We thus measured IFN-\u03b2 induction in THP1 macrophages transfected with Listeria DNA, either undigested or treated with DNase. Intact but not DNase-treated DNA significantly induced IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 8B). Macrophages were then transfected with lysozyme-digested EGDe or \u0394pgdA, either untreated or digested with DNase. Treatment with DNase significantly reduced IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these results show that Listeria DNA can induce IFN-\u03b2, strongly indicating that destruction of \u0394pgdA bacteria intracellularly activates DNA sensors.\n\nWe had recently reported that a PGN modification involving a N-deacetylase gene, pgdA, was playing a key role in L. monocytogenes virulence [25]. A \u0394pgdA strain of L. monocytogenes which is unable to modify its PGN, was shown to be extremely sensitive to the bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme, normally found within macrophage vacuoles and its virulence was strongly attenuated [25]. Furthermore, this mutant induced a much higher TLR2-dependent IFN-\u03b2 response than the parental strain [25]. We hypothesised that this unconventional IFN-\u03b2 response induced by the pgdA mutant was due to an enhanced accessibility of bacterial cell wall components to TLR2. Here we have shown that IFN-\u03b2 production requires bacterial internalization and is triggered by Mal/TIRAP-independent pathways which involve TLR2, TRIF, IRF3 and IRF7.\n\nIt was surprising to see a role for TLR2, as, based on results in BMM and epithelial cells, type I IFNs production is usually not known to result from TLR2 signaling [5]\u2013[8]. Classical TLR2 signaling leads to NF-\u03baB-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines [21]. However, in support of an unconventional role for TLR2, recent studies reported roles for TLR2-dependent induction of IFN-\u03b2 in response to vaccinia virus or synthetic ligands [26], [29]. In the vaccinia virus study, a specific inflammatory monocyte population -Ly6Chi- was shown to be the source of IFN-\u03b2 [26]. In the present study we show that TLR2-dependent IFN-\u03b2 synthesis is a property of both resident and recruited inflammatory PEM. Furthermore, the two previous studies documented that TLR2 activation of type I IFN responses to TLR ligands occurs within intracellular compartments, and that TLR2 signals from the phagosome in response to viral infection or synthetic TLR2 ligands [26], [29]. These results challenged the view that TLR2 signals solely from the plasma membrane. In our experiments, pre-treatment of PEM with either cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization and thus internalization, dynasore, an inhibitor of the endocytic effector dynamin, or chloroquine, which inhibits endosome acidification [30], [31], significantly impaired the induction of IFN-\u03b2 following Listeria infection, strongly suggesting that phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes and intracellular location of TLR2 trigger this response. These observations also correlate with our early hypothesis that the inflammatory response induced by \u0394pgdA is due to an enhanced release or accessibility of bacterial cell wall components to TLR2.\n\nInduction of the IFN-\u03b2 gene was independent of the TLR adapter Mal/TIRAP, but, unexpectedly required the TLR3/4 adapter TRIF. Francisella tularensis has recently been shown to signal through TLR2 from the phagosome in a Mal/TIRAP independent manner [32], and it was shown that Mal/TIRAP is dispensable in TLR2 signaling at high concentrations of ligands [33]. Thus our study reinforces the view that TLR2 can act independently from Mal/TIRAP. In addition our report suggests a synergy between a TLR2 pathway and TRIF, an adapter previously known to trigger the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs upon engagement of TLR3 and TLR4. TLR3 is known to bind viral dsRNA to induce secretion of type I IFN and lead to control of viral infections [3], [34], [35]. To our knowledge Chlamydia muridarum is the only bacterium reported to induce a TLR3-dependent IFN-\u03b2 response specifically in murine oviduct epithelial cells [36]. We tested whether the dual requirement for TLR2 and TRIF resulted from a functional or physical interaction between TLR2 and TLR3. In fact, IFN-\u03b2 production was reduced in TLR3-deficient macrophages, but significantly less so than in trif\u2212/\u2212 PEM. Therefore, there is no evidence for a putative TLR2/TLR3 interaction. Another possibility to incorporate TRIF into the pathway stimulated in PEM by Listeria would be a cooperation of TLR2 and TLR4. This was ruled out by showing that Listeria-infected tlr4\u2212/\u2212 PEM produced a similar amount of IFN-\u03b2 as their wild-type counterparts. TRIF could possibly orchestrate an additional pathway. Along these lines, TRIF has recently been shown to be required for IFN-\u03b2 synthesis by dendritic cells upon activation of the cytosolic receptor complex DDX1/DDX21/DDX36 by viral RNA [19].\n\nEngagement of TLRs by various microbe-associated molecular patterns induces activation and translocation to the nucleus of NF-\u03baB, IRF3, IRF7 and/or activator protein-1 (AP-1), which collaborate to induce transcription of type I IFNs [37]. We addressed the role of these transcriptional activators in the IFN-\u03b2 response to wild-type Listeria and \u0394pgdA, and revealed that inactivation of IRF3 totally abrogated this response to both strains while IFN-\u03b2 induction was significantly but not totally impaired in IRF7-deficient macrophages, indicating that both of these transcription factors are required for induction of IFN-\u03b2 following infection with L. monocytogenes. We also assessed the involvement of NF-\u03baB in this response using induction of the I\u03baB gene as a readout. We observed an induction of I\u03baB expression in macrophages which was similar after infection with EGDe or \u0394pgdA. Thus, activation of NF-\u03baB by Listeria is independent of PgdA, strongly suggesting that the elevated IFN-\u03b2 production by the \u0394pgdA mutant mostly relies on IRF3.\n\nThe increased IFN-\u03b2 response to the \u0394pgdA strain probably results from the fact that within the phagosome, its lysozyme-sensitive cell wall is degraded, releasing PAMPs able to interact with TLR2 and other PRRs, including cytoplasmic ones. As recent studies have highlighted novel DNA-sensing pathways in the induction of type I IFNs [9], [14]\u2013[17], [38], we thus also investigated the involvement of bacterial nucleic acids in the IFN-\u03b2 induction, Firstly, we showed that inactivation of PgdA, which confers a higher susceptibility to lysozyme, leads to increased release of DNA. We then showed that DNA from L. monocytogenes can induce IFN-\u03b2 expression in PEM, suggesting that this macrophage population employs cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing similar to macrophages or macrophage lines derived from different anatomical locations [9], [38]. Which -if any- of the recently described nucleic acid sensors are used by PEM for the recognition of Listeria DNA remains subject to future investigation. Nevertheless, other bacterial components could participate in IFN-\u03b2 production upon infection with the \u0394pgdA mutant. For example, the second messenger molecule cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), was shown to be secreted by Listeria multidrug efflux pumps triggering type I IFN response [10] and could be involved in the process.\n\nIn conclusion, this study describes a novel mechanism leading to induction of type I IFNs in which intracellular sensing plays an important role, ultimately showing how these different recognition pathways can synergise to induce innate immune responses which are required to control infection. In this regard cooperation between TLR2 and TRIF may reflect the need for convergence of the NF-\u03baB and IRF pathways at the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, with TLR2 being responsible mainly for NF-\u03baB activation and TRIF being instrumental for activation of IRF3 and IRF7. By employing the strategy of PGN modification, L. monocytogenes can avoid immune detection by TLR and evade the innate immune response, thus enabling the infectious process to occur. It is important to recall that pgdA orthologs are found in other pathogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis and Helicobacter pylori, strongly suggesting that PGN N-deacetylation is a general mechanism evolved by microbes to escape from pattern recognition receptor-mediated immune recognition [39]\u2013[42].\n\n\nL. monocytogenes EGDe (BUG1600, ATCC BAA-679), L. monocytogenes isogenic mutant \u0394pgdA (BUG2288, [25]) and L. monocytogenes \u0394pgdA complemented strain (BUG2382) were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI, Oxoid), aerobically at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm.\n\nA DNA fragment containing the pgdA gene (lmo0415) and its promoter was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides lmo0415-1 (5\u2032-AAGGATCCCACAATATGTTAGTTTTCAGGGG-3\u2032) and lmo0415-2 (5\u2032-AAGGATCCTTATTTCACCATTCTTGAATCTG-3\u2032). The fragment was integrated into pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the construct was verified by sequencing. After digestion of the construct by BamHI, the fragment was purified on agarose gel and cloned into the integrative vector pPL2 [43], previously digested by BamHI, constructing pOD98. The pOD98 was electroporated into \u0394pgdA at 2,500 V, 200 \u03a9 and 25 \u00b5F. Transformants were selected at 37\u00b0C on BHI agar containing chloramphenicol (7 \u00b5g/mL). The presence of the pgdA gene in the complemented strain was confirmed by PCR using oligonucleotides lmo0415-1 and lmo0415-2.\n\nMice were used for obtaining peptone-elicited peritoneal macrophages, resident peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Institut Pasteur (permit #03-49) and following Austrian law in accordance with protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna (#GZ680 205/67-BrGt/2003).\n\nPEM were isolated from 7 to 10 week-old C57BL/6J and genetically-matched tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212, tlr3\n\u2212/\u2212, tlr4\n\u2212/\u2212, mal/tirap\n\u2212/\u2212, trif\n\u2212/\u2212, irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 and irf7\n\u2212/\u2212 mice as previously described [44]. The percentage of macrophages was determined by flow cytometry using CD11b (1\u2236100, eBiosciences) and F4/80 (1\u2236100, eBiosciences) antibodies. More than 90% of the cells were macrophages. PEM were seeded onto 6-well plates at a concentration of 2\u00d7106 cells per well in DMEM (PAA) supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% L929 conditioned medium (LCM) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin or RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\n\nResident macrophages were isolated from 6 to 8 week-old C57BL/6J and genetically-matched tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212, trif\n\u2212/\u2212 mice by washing the peritoneum twice with 10 mL DMEM (PAA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% LCM and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Harvested cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes and resuspended in complete medium. The percentage of macrophages was determined by flow cytometry analysis as above. Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (Nunc) at a concentration of 2\u00d7106 cells per well.\n\nTibia and femur from 6 to 8 week-old C57BL/6J and genetically-matched tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212, trif\n\u2212/\u2212 mice were collected in ice cold PBS. Bones were sterilized with 70% ethanol and flushed with a 25-G needle using cold DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% LCM and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (Nunc) at a concentration of 106 cells per well and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. After 4 days, complete medium was added and cells were split at a ratio of 1\u22362. After 8 days, macrophages were fully differentiated.\n\nHuman acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB202) were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate at a concentration of 4\u00d7105 cells per well in antibiotic-free media supplemented with 12.5 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Differentiation was determined to be successful upon formation of a confluent adherent monolayer. HEK-blue type I IFN cells (Invivogen) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 5.6\u00d7104 cells per well onto a 96-well plate.\n\nFor cytokine analysis, macrophages were infected with Listeria strains at MOI 10\u22361, centrifuged at 300 g for 2 min and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Following phagocytosis, monolayers were washed twice followed by incubation in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and gentamicin (20 \u00b5g/mL). Supernatants were collected at various time points, for detection of IFN-\u03b2 by ELISA. For transcript analysis, macrophages were infected with Listeria strains at MOI 20\u22361 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to allow phagocytosis. Monolayers were washed and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and gentamicin (5 \u00b5g/mL). After 2 h, medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and gentamicin (1 \u00b5g/mL). Cells were lysed at various time points and RNA collected for qPCR analysis.\n\nFor inhibition of bacterial internalization, cell monolayers were pretreated either for 2 h with 100 \u00b5M cytochalasin-D (Sigma-Aldrich), or 30 min with 80 \u00b5M dynasore (Sigma-Aldrich) or 30 min with 100 \u00b5M chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to infection assays.\n\n\nListeria were grown overnight in BHI at 37\u00b0C and cultures were centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 75 \u00b5g/mL lysozyme and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. DNA was then extracted using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) and quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop). For transfection assays, THP-1 macrophages were transfected with 200 ng/mL DNA with 2% lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated for 24 h. Following incubation, supernatants were collected for IFN-\u03b2 analysis. For pretreatment of DNA with DNase, DNase was added at final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL for 45 min at 37\u00b0C.\n\nBacterial cultures were treated with 10 \u00b5g/mL lysozyme, a concentration leading to lysis of \u0394pgdA but not EGDe, and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm for 1 h. Following lysozyme treatment, lysed bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm during 10 min. Two types of experiments were performed on supernatants. First, nucleic acid release was quantified. DNA was purified using the Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit omitting lysis steps and quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop). RNA was purified using Qiagen RNeasy kit and quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop). Data shown are representatives of at least three independent experiments. Second, 100 \u00b5L of each supernatants were treated by DNase during 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Enzymes were inactivated and treated- or untreated-supernatants were transfected in PEM. 8 h after transfection, supernatants of cells were recovered and the IFN\u03b2 was quantified.\n\nMurine IFN-\u03b2 production was detected in macrophage supernatants by ELISA according to the manufacturer's procedure (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). For the HEK-blue type I IFN assay, supernatant from THP-1 macrophage assays was collected and 20 \u00b5L added onto HEK-blue type I IFN cells plated in 96-well plates, which were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Supernatant from HEK-blue cells was collected and 40 \u00b5L added to 160 \u00b5L of Quanti-blue reagent (Invivogen) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. The colorimetric reaction was measured at 625 nm on a plate reader. Data was normalised against absorbance for the untreated cells and plotted as relative fold increases. Data shown are representatives of at least three independent experiments.\n\nPEM from WT or tlr2\n\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6J mice were infected with EGDe. Cells were lysed 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 h post-infection. I\u03baB and tubulin were detected in lysates by immunoblotting using anti-I\u03baB (Santa Cruz, 1\u2236100) and anti-\u03b1-tubulin (Sigma, 1\u22365000) antibodies.\n\nRNA preparation was performed using NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Mastercycler EP realplex S (Eppendorf). Primers for HPRT (housekeeping gene control), IFN\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA expression were as follows: HPRT forward GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG, HPRT reverse GAGGGTAGGCTGGCCTATTGGCT, IFN\u03b2 forward 5\u2032-TCAGAATGAGTGGTGGTTGC-3\u2032, IFN\u03b2 reverse 5\u2032-GACCTTTCAAATGCAGTAGATTCA-3\u2032; I\u03baB\u03b1 forward 5\u2032-GCAATTTCTGGCTGGTGGG-3\u2032, I\u03baB\u03b1 reverse 5\u2032GATCCGCCAGGTGAAGGG-3\u2032. Data shown are representatives of at least three independent experiments.\n\nResults are expressed as means of at least three values, with error bars representing standard deviations. Student's t tests were performed to determine statistical significance where * indicates P<0.05, ** indicates P<0.01 and *** indicates P<0.0001."}
