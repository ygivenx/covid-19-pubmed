Covid-19 pandemic and the skin -What should dermatologists know?", "body": "In December 2019, a pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China. It was later disclosed that the new (novel) type of corona virus causes respiratory disease spreading from person-to-person. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, and on February 11, the World Health Association defined the new coronavirus disease as COVID-19 (1). Since then, the pandemic has spread to all continents except Antarctica. By mid-March 2020, there have been more than 200,000 cases reported worldwide. Whereas the time for reaching the first 100,000 cases took 12 weeks, only 12 days were needed to reach the next 100000 (1). In the United States, more than 10,000 cases and a total of 150 deaths from COVID-19 infection had been reported until March 21, 2020 (2).\n\nWith the current global pandemic, dermatologists, like all physicians, should be aware of COVID-19 infection and any skin manifestations.\n\nThe tropism of the virus for the structures of the bronchial mucosa and the immune system cells with typical histopathologic pattern has been demonstrated by using autopsy specimens from the lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, thyroid, and skin (3) . Although the infection also involves changes of the heart, vasculature, liver, and kidney, the typical skin pattern was not initially described. Subsequently, mucosal membranes have been J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 closed doors. In addition, the scientific communication between dermatologists has been hindered with the cancellation of scientific meetings and academic sessions.\n\nA recent paper underlines the importance of patient triage at the entrance of a dermatology clinic and even the private office in order to regulate the clear vs. dirty flow (7) . Where possible, it may prove prudent to conduct outpatient visits with teledermatology or postpone such consultations for non-emergency patients and those with less skin ailments. Where appropriate, wearing a N95 mask (a PPE used to protect the face from airborne particles and liquids with very small dimensions of 0.3 micron) and hand hygiene are recommended during a patient visit (6) .\n\nThe skin and COVID-19 interactions, as well as the consequences to the skin and mucous "}
