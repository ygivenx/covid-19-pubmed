{"title": "Autophagy Negatively Regulates Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Replication", "body": "Upon infection, the betacoronavirus MHV uses components of the cellular autophagic pathway to form DMVs in order to complete viral replication18. To determine whether TGEV infection regulates the cellular autophagy process by inducing the formation of DMVs, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the formation of autophagosome-like vesicles in TGEV-infected ST and PK15 cells. We observed that the number of double- and single-membrane vesicles increased near the perinuclear region of TGEV-infected ST cells, and that such structures were rare in the mock-treated samples (Fig. 1a). These autophagosome-like vesicles were morphologically identical to the MHV-infected Hela cells6. Similar results were obtained using PK15 cells (Fig. 1b). The number of autophagosome-like vesicles was greater in the cytoplasm of TGEV-infected cells than in the cytoplasm of mock-treated cells (Fig. 1c).\n\nWhen autophagy is induced, a series of conjugation reactions lead to the conversion of cytosolic microtubule-associated LC3 (LC3-I) to the lipidated form LC3 (LC3-II), and the amount of LC3-II is correlated with the number of autophagosomes2122. Therefore, we examined LC3 conversion by western blot assay using an anti-LC3 antibody that recognizes both forms of LC3 during TGEV infection. At the same time, mAb 3D7, which specifically recognizes TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein, was used to estimate the infection progress. The results showed that the expression levels of LC3-II were upregulated in TGEV-infected ST cells relative to mock-treated cells (Fig. 2a). Because the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I is regarded as an accurate indicator of autophagic activity23, we further assessed the densitometric ratios of LC3-II to LC3-I. As shown in Fig. 2b, the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio significantly increased from 24 to 30 h post infection (hpi) in TGEV-infected cells relative to controls; in addition, TGEV N protein was detected at 6 hpi and increased sharply between 24\u201330 hpi, which was consistent with the increase of LC3-II. By contrast, no obvious changes of the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio were observed in mock-treated cells (Fig. 2a,b). TGEV infection-induced autophagy was also assessed using PK15 cells. As was the case with ST cells, the relative amount of LC3-II significantly increased as TGEV infection of PK15 cells progressed over time, although the rate of increase in TGEV infection were slower in PK15 cells than in ST cells (Fig. 2c,d). Taken together, these data suggest that autophagosomes accumulated in TGEV-infected cells.\n\nThe activation of autophagic activity by TGEV infection could be caused either by incoming virons or by viral replication products. To determine whether TGEV replication is required for the induction of autophagy, we challenged cells with either replication-competent or UV-inactivated virus and measured the effect on autophagy by monitoring the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Before conducting the formal experiments, we used immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to verify that the UV-inactivated virus was replication defective (Fig. 3a). By using western blot, we found that the levels of both LC3-I and LC3-II were similar in ST cells inoculated with UV-inactivated TGEV at MOI of 10 and in mock-treated ST cells at 24 h post inoculation; in addition, no N protein synthesis was detected in ST cells inoculated with UV-inactivated TGEV. In contrast, ST cells infected with replication-competent TGEV apparently underwent the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 3b,c). Similar results were obtained with PK15 cells (Fig. 3b,c), suggesting that TGEV replication is required for the formation of autophagosomes.\n\nTo determine whether autophagosome accumulation is due to autophagy induction or to a block in the maturation of autophagosome into autolysosomes2425, we performed autophagic flux assays, which can distinguish between these two possibilities26. Because p62/SQSTM1 serves as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, and because inhibition of autophagy leads to an increase in the levels of p62, p62 degradation is considered an indicator of autophagic flux2227. Therefore, we used a western blot assay to measure the changes in p62 protein levels upon virus infection. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, TGEV infection increased degradation of p62 in ST cells over time. There was no significant alteration of p62 between 0 h and 36 h in the mock-treated control. These data indicate that the accumulation of autophagosomes induced by TGEV infection is due to autophagic activation rather than to a block in autophagosome maturation.\n\nTo further monitor the autophagic flux upon viral infection, we evaluated the autophagosome maturation process by transfecting cells with a tandem reporter construct GFP-RFP-tagged LC3 (GFP-RFP-LC3). The fusion protein GFP-LC3 is relatively stable, but the low pH in the autolysosome quenches the GFP fluorescent signal. RFP-LC3, in contrast, exhibits more stable fluorescence in acidic compartments, which makes the GFP-RFP-LC3 tandem construct useful for assessing autophagosome dynamics2829. Therefore, ST cells were transfected with GFP-RFP-LC3 plasmid and then were infected with TGEV before live cell imaging was used to examine the dynamics of autophagosome maturation. In TGEV-infected cells, the GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3 puncta formed a yellow autophagosome by the 10-h frame (Fig. 5a). Subsequently, the yellow puncta turned red, most likely as a result of the quenching of GFP-LC3 fluorescence in the acidic amphisomes or autolysosomes (Fig. 5a & movie, data not shown); this change in color indicated the maturation of autophagosomes. In mock-treated cells, in contrast, the few yellow or red LC3 puncta represent the baseline range of autophagic flux. To confirm that the autophagic puncta are not derived from apoptotic blebs, we performed apoptosis staining during the infection. As shown in Fig. 5b, there was no increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells at 10, 12, and 18 hpi in infected cells relative to mock-treated cells; at 30 hpi, some virus-infected cells began to be apoptosis positive. Collectively, the results demonstrate that TGEV infection leads to the degradation of p62 protein via the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, suggesting that virus infection significantly increases autophagic flux.\n\nGiven that autophagy is induced by TGEV infection, we then determined whether cellular autophagy regulates TGEV replication. To accomplish this, we exposed the cells to wortmannin or LY294002, both of which can inhibit autophagy at an early stage by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway30. As shown in Fig. 6a,d, wortmannin and LY294002 pretreatment reduced the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in TGEV-infected ST cells, indicating that the virus-induced autophagy is inhibited by these two compounds. As indicated by IFA, treatment of cells with either wortmannin (Fig. 6b) or LY294002 (Fig. 6e) increased the percentage of infected cells by 3- or 2-fold, respectively, relative to untreated cells. An increase in the titers of progeny virus in the cells treated with wortmannin or LY294002 was confirmed by measuring the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) (Fig. 6c,f). These data indicate that virus-induced autophagy may protect cells from TGEV infection.\n\nIn additional experiments with pharmalogical regulators, we used siRNA duplexes that target three highly conserved genes required for mammalian autophagy (LC3, ATG5, and ATG7)313233. These three genes were examined to confirm that the effects observed were due to the autophagy pathway rather than to the non-target effects of the siRNA. To deplete the proteins, we treated ST cells with siRNA duplexes for 24 h and then challenged the cells with TGEV. When cells were separately treated with each of the three siRNA duplexes, the levels of LC3, ATG5, and ATG7 mRNA were decreased in each case relative to levels in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7a, 8a and 9a). Western blot analysis of detergent lysates collected from cells revealed that levels of endogenous LC3, ATG5, or ATG7 protein were significantly lower in cells treated with the siRNA duplexes than in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7b, 8b and 9b). Because the data indicated that knockdown efficiency was greatest with LC3-specific siRNA duplexes 3#, ATG5-specific siRNA duplexes 1#, and ATG7-specific siRNA duplexes 2#, these specific siRNA duplexes were used in the following experiments. Following the knockdown of each autophagy-related gene with these gene-specific siRNA duplexes, we observed an increase in the percentage of TGEV-infected cells in comparison to the nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7c, 8c and 9c). We also found that autophagic protein depletion led to increased viral titers (Figs 7d, 8d and 9d). Together, the data demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy promotes TGEV replication.\n\nTo confirm that autophagy inhibits TGEV infection, we treated ST cells with rapamycin, which induces autophagy by blocking the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway3435. As shown in Fig. 10a, rapamycin treatment increased the amounts of LC3-II in TGEV-infected ST cells, indicating that autophagy is upregulated by rapamycin in virus-infected cells. Using IFA, we observed that the percentage of TGEV-infected cells was lower in the rapamycin-treated cells than in nontreated cells (Fig. 10b). Viral yields were also lower in rapamycin-treated cells than in nontreated cells (Fig. 10c). These observations suggest that autophagy restricts TGEV replication and reduces viral yields, which is consistent with the results of our autophagy inhibition assays.\n\nTo confirm that the results we obtained with rapamycin reflected autophagy induction rather than other processes, we determined whether depletion of endogenous acetyltransferase p300 by siRNA also affects TGEV infection. Previous research demonstrated that acetyltransferase p300 can degrade LC3, ATG5, and ATG7 by post-translational modifications in Hela cells, and that knockdown of p300 can accelerate autophagy36. We treated ST cells with p300 siRNA duplexes for 24 h and then infected them with TGEV. As shown in Fig. 11a, p300 siRNA-transfected ST cells had decreased levels of the endogenous acetyltransferase p300 protein and increased levels of LC3-II, ATG5, and ATG7 proteins, suggesting that p300 negatively regulates autophagy in ST cells. In addition, knockdown efficiency was greater for p300 siRNA duplexes 2# than for the other duplexes, and p300 siRNA duplexes 2# was therefore used for further study. Using IFA, we found that the percentage of TGEV-positive cells was lower in cells treated with the p300 siRNA duplexes 2# than in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Fig. 11b). The reduction in viral replication determined by IFA was verified by measuring the TCID50 (Fig. 11c). Overall, these results demonstrate that autophagy plays an antiviral role during TGEV infection.\n\nBy contributing to self-degradation, autophagy helps maintain cellular homeostasis and increases cell survival. Studies of cellular autophagy have then increased greatly over the past two decades37. Subsequently, studies about relationship between autophagy and viral infection have rapidly emerged38. To date, more than 50 virus species have been investigated, and the results indicate that autophagy inhibits the replication of some viruses but promotes the replication of others3940. However, the relationship between TGEV infection and autophagy had not been investigated before the current research. In the present work, we investigated the interaction between the cellular autophagy pathway and TGEV infection. We report for the first time that TGEV infection induces autophagy and that autophagy limits TGEV replication.\n\nTGEV, which is the representative member of alphacoronavirus, infects the enteric and respiratory tissues of newborn piglets, resulting in nearly 100% mortality4142. Although this virus was identified 30 years ago43, the interactions between TGEV replication and host cell responses are incompletely understood. Previous studies revealed that infection by several other coronaviruses, including MHV, SARS-CoV, IBV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, induced the formation of DMVs61844454647. In the present study, TEM revealed that the formation of DMVs, which is a hallmark of coronavirus replication, was greatly induced in both ST and PK15 cells during TGEV infection. The presence of DMVs suggested that this virus might induce the accumulation of autophagic vesicles in TGEV-infected cells. Using immunoblotting to evaluate LC3 modification, we then confirmed that the induction of DMVs by TGEV infection was related to the autophagic process. Additionally, we found that viral replication is required in TGEV-induced autophagy. Although DMVs exist in the TGEV-infected cells, we did not know whether this alphacoronavirus species, like betacoronavirus species, hijacks the autophagosome machinery to facilitate virus replication46. Further work is needed to conclusively answer this question. Nevertheless, our findings clearly demonstrate that TGEV infection induces the accumulation of autophagosomes in target cells, and that the TGEV replication process is required for the induction of autophagic activity.\n\nThe cellular autophagic process has been investigated for several viruses48. Previous reports showed that the induction of autophagy by viruses can be due to the formation of autophagosomes or to the inhibition of phagosome maturation2425. Another way to verify the cellular state of autophagy is to monitor autophagic flux, which can be measured by detecting the levels of p62 and the transportation of LC32227. Our immunoblotting results showed that TGEV infection decreases the expression level of p62 protein, indicating that TGEV infection enhances the autophagic flux in target cells. Moreover, by using a GFP-RFP-LC3 tandem construct to morphologically trace autophagic flux, we assessed the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysomes; the results indicated that the accumulation of autophagosomes is due to their de novo formation and not to the inhibition of their maturation. These data demonstrate that there is a potential relationship between the autophagic process and TGEV infection.\n\nThe autophagy pathway has been reported to be a critical component in development, survival, and the immune response49. The antiviral potential of autophagy has recently been studied141650. The first-identified mammalian autophagy protein, Beclin 1, protects the host against infection by Sindbis virus (a positive-stranded RNA virus) by reducing viral titres51. A similar antiviral role for autophagy has been described in response to infection by \u03b1-herpesvirus-1, which is a double-stranded DNA virus5253. An antiviral function of autophagy has also been found in another RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)54. In the present study, we pharmacologically inhibited the formation of autophagosomes and consequently increased virus replication; this finding was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of three highly conserved endogenous genes required for autophagy. These results are consistent with the role of autophagy in cell-autonomous defense against microbial invasion85556. Accordingly, we found that inhibition of autophagy increases TGEV replication.\n\nRecent studies show that several members of the Coronaviridae family, including IBV, MHV, and SARS-CoV, can induce autophagy but do not require autophagy for replication in host cells465758. However, Prentice et al. reported that MHV utilizes the cell\u2019s autophagic machinery to facilitate virus replication18. These observations suggest that replication mechanisms may differ among viruses of the same family and even of the same species; these differences may be related to differences in cell-type specificity or in mechanisms of infection. Therefore, to determine whether the induction of autophagy is an anti-TGEV response, we examined the effect of controlled autophagosomal activation on virus replication. Our data showed that rapamycin treatment induced autophagy, which then inhibited virus replication, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of autophagy might be a useful way to restrict TGEV replication.\n\nTo further evaluate the effect of autophagy modulation on virus replication, we attempted to genetically adjust autophagy. Lee and Finkel found that acetyltransferase p300 is involved in the acetylation of several known components of the autophagy machinery, including ATG5, ATG7, ATG8 (LC3), and ATG12; acetyltransferase p300 degrades these autophagy-dependent proteins and inhibits autophagosome formation under starved conditions36. In addition, Huang et al. reported that TGEV infection downregulates acetyltransferase p300 expression and increases cell apoptosis59, suggesting that acetyltransferase p300 is regulated upon TGEV infection. When we knocked down the endogenous p300 in ST cells with specific siRNA duplexes, autophagy was induced, which is consistent with previous findings36, and TGEV replication was reduced. These data indicate that induction of autophagy restricts viral replication. Based on these results, we conclude that autophagy has an antiviral rather than a proviral role in TGEV infection, although the detailed interplay between the autophagic machinery and TGEV and other viruses remains incompletely understood.\n\nIn summary, autophagy has been shown to be essential for defense against a variety of pathogens in cell culture. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TGEV infection triggers the formation of autophagosomes. Down-regulation of the autophagy signal pathway increases viral replication, and up-regulation of the autophagic process reduces viral replication. In addition, the involvement of acetyltransferase p300 in the regulation of TGEV replication is reported for the first time. The antiviral pathway identified in this study may play a role in the control of other infectious agents. Finally, pharmacological modulation of the autophagic pathway should be explored as a means to inhibit viral replication.\n\nST and PK15 cells from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, 11995) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone Laboratories Inc.). TGEV strain H165 was propagated in ST cells cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS60. To obtain replication-incompetent TGEV, 10 ml of virus suspension was dispensed to form a layer of fluid in an open, cell culture dish and was irradiated with UV light for 5 h by gentle shaking at intervals. The absence of virus infectivity after UV treatment was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay.\n\nRapamycin (R0395), wortmannin (W1628) and LY294002 (L9908), rabbit anti-LC3 (L7543), and rabbit anti-p62/SQSTM1 (P0067) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (115-096-146) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Goat anti-ATG5 polyclonal antibody (N-18 sc-8666), goat anti-ATG7 polyclonal antibody (N-20, sc-8668), rabbit anti-p300 (N-15, sc-585) and anti-\u03b2-actin polyclonal antibodies (sc-47778) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. IRDye 800CW donkey anti-goat IgG (926-32214), IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (926-32211) and IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse IgG (926-68070) were purchased from Li-Cor. The mAb 3D7 against TGEV N protein was prepared in our laboratory. siRNA duplexes from Sigma-Aldrich, specifically to knock down the associated gene expression including LC3, ATG5, ATG7, p300 and unrelated gene, were listed in Table 1.\n\nST and PK15 cells were infected with TGEV at MOI of 1 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Unattached viruses were removed and the cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then cultured in complete medium for various time points until samples had been harvested. For the autophagy induction and inhibition experiments, ST cells were pretreated with wortmannin (3 \u03bcM), LY294002 (25 \u03bcM), rapamycin (100 nM), or equal volume of DMSO (carrier control) for 4 h prior to viral infection. Virus incubation was carried out at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After three times washing with PBS, the cells were reinoculated with fresh media containing wortmannin, LY294002, rapamycin, or DMSO during treatments. At 24 h post infection, cells were collected for subsequent analysis.\n\nFor our conventional ultrastructural analysis, ST and PK15 cells were either mock-treated or infected with TGEV at MOI of 1 for 24 h. The cells were then fixed and processed for section preparation as described previously61. Images of the ultrathin sections were viewed on an H-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). Autophagosome-like vesicles were defined as double- or single-membrane vesicles measuring 0.3 to 2.0 \u03bcm in diameter with clearly recognizable cytoplasmic contents. The number of autophagosome-like vesicles was calculated in ST and PK15 cells post infection.\n\nCells were detergent-lysed and performed as previously described62. Typically, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, A7906) in PBS for 60 min and then incubated with a primary antibody for 60 min. After three times washing with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) diluted in washing buffer for 60 min. Membranes were washed as described above, and subjected to scanning on an Odyssey instrument (Odyssey infrared imaging system, Li-Cor Biosciences).\n\nIFA was performed as previously described63. Cells were subjected to infection with TGEV after treatments as indicated, followed by fixation in 33.3% acetone for 30 min at room temperature and drying. Fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-TGEV N protein mAb 3D7 and then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Finally, the cells were visualized under an Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a camera following by counterstaining with 5 \u03bcg/ml 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The percentage of virus-positive cells was calculated.\n\nAt 24 h post transfection of siRNA duplexes, total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen) to generate cDNA with oligo (dT) primers using Superscript\u00ae II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR reactions were set up in triplicate using SYBR premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and 10 \u03bcM specific primers (Table 2), with the following cycling program: 15 s at 94 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of 5 s at 94 \u00b0C, 20 s at 55 \u00b0C and 25 s at 72 \u00b0C. Relative quantification was performed by the cycle threshold (\u2206\u2206CT) method63. Briefly, CT values were normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA (\u03b2-actin, internal standard), as \u2206CT, which was determined by the formula \u2206CT = CT (target gene) \u2212CT (\u03b2-actin). Fold changes was determined by 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT, where \u2206\u2206CT = \u2206CT (siRNA1-3#) \u2212\u2206CT (Control siRNA).\n\nST cells were transfected with the GFP-RFP-LC3 plasmid for 24 h prior to TGEV infection at MOI of 1. Subsequently the cells were recorded under the Ultra View Vox 3D live cell imaging system (PerkinElmer). By using this confocal imaging, three-dimensional data can be captured by collecting two-dimensional images in the XY plane at a range of Z-plane settings. Due to low levels of light the three-dimensional data can be captured in real time without damaging the cells, so that autophagic processes can be recorded as they happen. When the images have been captured, we can use the Volocity analysis tool (Ultra View Vox, PerkinElmer) to extract data and quantify cellular processes. Images and data can then be transferred to video program for display.\n\nST cells were treated with mock or TGEV at MOI of 1. At indicated time points cells were stained with FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences, USA) and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nVariables are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using student\u2019s t test and analyzed using Excel. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nHow to cite this article: Guo, L. et al.
