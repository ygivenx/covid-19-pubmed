{"title": "Genomic organization and adaptive evolution of IGHC genes in marine mammals", "body": "Immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoprotein molecules that function as antibodies and are only expressed in jawed vertebrates (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) . Typically, Igs compose two identical heavy (IgH) and two identical light chains (IgL). Both heavy and light chains can be divided into two regions, i.e., the constant region and the variable region, based on the variability of amino acid sequences. In general, the variable region recognizes antigens, whereas the constant region specifies critical effector or signaling functions, such as phagocytosis, binding Fc (fragment crystallizable) receptors and activation of complement (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010) . The classification of Igs is based on their heavy chain constant (IGHC) genes (Bengt\u00e9n et al., 2000) . To date, several IgH isotypes, including IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA, have been identified in multiple vertebrates, and they are encoded by the IGHM, IGHD, IGHG, IGHE and IGHA genes respectively (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010) . Both IgM and IgD have been reported to be the most ancient IgH isotypes among jawed vertebrates, with IgM very conserved but IgD showing a high degree of structural and (presumably) functional diversity and even being lost in some species over evolutionary time (Sun et al., 2011; Ohta and Flajnik, 2006) . IgG and IgE are both exclusively present in mammals (Bengt\u00e9n et al., 2000; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) , the former being the predominant serum antibody and binding receptors on phagocytic cells and the latter predominantly functioning in immunity against parasites (Maizels, 2005) . Additionally, IgA was found in reptiles first, with similar functions in all animals (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010) . Participating in mucosal immunity, IgA coats pathogens to prevent proliferation and defend against local infection (Macpherson et al., 2008) .\n\nExtant marine mammals descended from terrestrial ancestors that re-entered in the aquatic environment at different times (Uhen, 2010) . There are five main groups of extant marine mammals: Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises and whales), Sirenia (manatees, dugongs), Pinnipedia (walruses, sea lions and seals), polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris) (Uhen, 2007) . Cetacea and Sirenia are the only known completely aquatic mammals, and they appeared to return to the aquatic environment at approximately the same time, i.e. \u223c50 Mya (million years ago) (Uhen, 2010; Thewissen et al., 2007) . In contrast, semi-aquatic pinnipeds, with a close relationship to Musteloidea, later transferred to water environment at \u223c28 Mya (Uhen, 2010; Flynn et al., 2005) . Despite the independent evolutionary origins of these marine mammals groups, they have developed a series of specializations for aquatic lifestyles, such as loss of hair, thickened blubber, derivation of echolocation, and so on (Uhen, 2007) .\n\nDuring their transition from terrestrial environment to the sea, marine mammals must have faced dramatic changes in pathogens. Recent studies have shown that cetacean TLR4 and MHC were subjected to adaptive evolution, particularly in the lineages with dramatic habitat transition (e.g. the lineage leading to hippo + whale representing the early stage of aquatic adaptation) or rapid radiation lineages such as extant dolphins (Shen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016) . However, the evolution of Ig in the aquatic adaptation of marine mammals remains poorly explored, except for a few reports about the cloning and sequencing of IGHC genes in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (Mancia et al., 2006 (Mancia et al., , 2007 Lundqvist et al., 2002) and the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) (Breaux et al., 2017) and the identification of IgM, IgG and IgA and lineage-specific IGHG gene duplication in some cetaceans (Mancia et al., 2006) , and so on. Therefore, in the present study, we first retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten representative marine mammals. The genomic organization of IGHC cluster was identified and positive selection on the marine mammals was detected to address whether they experienced adaptive evolution in response to aquatic environments.\n\nWe first downloaded the IGHC genes of 13 terrestrial mammals, including cow (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), horse (Equus caballus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), human (Homo sapiens), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), rat (Rattus norvegicus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensemble databases and the International ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT). The accession numbers of these sequences are compiled in Supplemental  Table 1 . Then we used IGHC sequences of these terrestrial relatives as a query to search for the orthologous genes from 10 marine mammal genomes with TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches, including bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), killer whale (Orcinus orca), Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocuena asiaeorientalis), baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), sperm whale (Physeter catodon), minke whale (Balaena acutorostrata), bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). In addition, IGHC genes were also scanned from the genomes of three additional terrestrial mammals, i.e., hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), European shrew (Sorex araneus), and elephant (Loxodonta africana). The detailed information about the genome assemblies used in this study is given in Table 1 . Finally, we checked whether the newly identified putative IGHC genes were their best hit by a blast search against the non-redundant database from GenBank. The newly identified IGHC genes were further separated into intact genes, partial genes and pseudogenes based on the amino acid alignment and blast results. The genomic coordinates of the newly identified IGHC genes are listed in Supplemental Table 2 .\n\nTo confirm that the regions of alignment had sufficient confidence to test for positive selection and determine phylogenetic relationships, the unaligned multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of IGHC genes translated to amino-acid sequences and further back-translated into the corresponding codon were submitted to GUIDANCE (Penn et al., 2010a, b) to obtain alignment confidence scores. GUIDANCE used a PRANK alignment program (version 140,110) and returned a colored MSA that allowed to delimit aligned regions ambiguously. Then the columns with confidence scores lower than the threshold were excluded from further analyses.\n\nPhylogenetic trees were reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) in MrBayes 3.2.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and Maximum likelihood (ML) in RAxML 8.0.26 (Stamatakis, 2006) . The best-fit evolutionary model for each dataset was chosen by MrModeltest 2.3 (Nylander, 2004) with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Bayesian inference analysis was run for 10 6 generations with one cold and three heated Markov chains to ensure the analysis remaining in global rather than local optima and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The first 1000 trees were discarded as the \"burn-in\". Because the samples from the beginning of the chain are unreliable. For ML analysis, the maximum likelihood tree was reconstructed with 1000 bootstrap replications.\n\nThe rate of nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) substitution (d N /d S or omega, \u03c9) measures the direction and intensity of natural selection, with \u03c9 = 1, \u03c9 > 1 and \u03c9 < 1 indicating neutral evolution, positive and purifying selection, respectively. To detect the impact of natural selection on IGHC genes, we performed a number of statistical tests based on calculating the \u03c9 values using the CODEML program implemented in PAML 4.7 package (Yang, 2007) . The selection analyses using the gene tree reconstructed by BI and ML methods generated nearly the same results as those from the well-supported species phylogeny (Perelman et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011a) ; thus, only the latter analysis is shown here.\n\nTo detect positively selected sites on IGHC genes, we first performed the site specific models, i.e., M8a (nearly neutral, beta distribution: 0 < \u03c9 0 < 1 and \u03c9 1 = 1) versus M8 (positive selection, beta distribution: 0 < \u03c9 0 < 1 and \u03c9 1 > 1), as implemented in CODEML program. In addition, positively selected sites were identified using Datamonkey, which incorporated the rate of synonymous substitution, whereas the d S was fixed in PAML. Three ML methods, i.e. the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effect likelihood (FEL), and random-effect likelihood (REL) implemented in the Datamonkey website (Pond and Frost, 2005a) , were used to infer the positively selected sites with default settings and significance levels of 0.1, 0.1, and 50, respectively. Although SLAC, a conservative method, is suitable for large data sets, it usually underestimates the substitution rate. FEL method seems to capture the pattern of rate variation better than SLAC and REL, but it tends to be less conservative than SLAC to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size. REL approach is more powerful than SLAC and FEL, but it has the higher rates of false positives for small data sets (Pond and Frost, 2005a,b) . These three predictions were conducted to estimating \u03c9 value of each site.\n\nTo further detect whether the possibility of positive selection was limited on specific lineages, we compared the free-ratio model, which estimated a separate \u03c9 ratio for each lineage, with the one-ratio model that estimated a same \u03c9 ratio for all lineages in the tree (Yang, 1998) . In addition, the branch-site model were conducted to detect evidence of positive selection on individual codon along a specific lineage (Zhang et al., 2005) . In branch-site model, we compared Ma (positive selection, 0 < \u03c9 0 < 1, \u03c9 1 = 1 and \u03c9 2 \u2265 1) with Ma0 (neutral selection, 0 < \u03c9 0 < 1, \u03c9 1 = 1 and \u03c9 2 = 1) to detect positive selection. The significance of the differences between two nested models was tested using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) statistic (-2[LogLikelihood1-LogLike-lihood2]) with a chi-square distribution. Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach implemented in the CODEML was used to test the posterior probabilities (PPs) of positively selected sites, where sites with PPs > 0.90 were considered as candidates undergoing positive selection. Finally, to support the PAML results, we employed a complementary protein-level approach implemented in TreeSAAP (Woolley et al., 2003) that detected the significant changes in amino acid physicochemical properties.\n\nIn the present study, we retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten marine mammals (including seven cetaceans, one manatee and two pinnipeds) and compared them with those of terrestrial relatives to provide insights into the evolution of IGHC genes in marine mammals. We found that the genomic regions containing an IGHC cluster are conservative with special flanking sequences, i.e., the TMEM121 and IGH diversity gene cluster (Eguchi-Ogawa et al., 2012) , which helped us obtain the complete IGHC genes in mammalian genomes. A total of 182 IGHC genes were identified in the 26 mammals in our study (Fig. 1) , including 79 sequences that were newly identified in 13 species. For the 10 marine mammals, a total of 59 sequences were identified in this study.\n\nTo define the orthologous relationships among IGHC genes, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees for each gene, as well as a phylogenetic tree incorporating all members of IGHC genes from 26 mammals using two different methods (BI and ML). Similar tree topologies were inferred (Fig. 2, Supplemental Figs. 1-11) . The phylogenetic relationship showed that the IGHC genes of marine mammals could be clustered well with those of their terrestrial relatives, suggesting that marine mammals possess the typical isotype repertoire as other eutherian mammals. Similar to other mammals, marine mammals were found to contain a single IGHM, IGHD, IGHE, and IGHA genes, and several IGHG genes based on the phylogenetic reconstruction. The order of IGHC genes in the IgH locus of marine mammals was determined to be 5\u2032-IGHM-IGHD-IGHG-IGHE-IGHA-3\u2032, which is in agreement with their terrestrial relatives (Supplemental Fig. 12) . Furthermore, we found that the first domain (CH1) of IGHM and the CH1 of IGHD of cetaceans shared nearly identical sequences, as shown in artiodactylas (Zhao et al., 2002) (Supplemental Fig. 13 ). The genomic organization of marine mammal IGHC genes is similar to that of other species examined, which suggested a constraint acting on their genomic arrangement and the conserved genomic organization of the IGHC genes.\n\nThe expansion of the IgG subclass is primarily a feature of mammals (Hsu et al., 2006) . The IgG-like Igs of chicken and lizard showed no subclass diversification (Butler et al., 2011) . The gene duplication of IGHG genes is believed to have occurred most recently, and it belongs to a lineage-specific event (Wagner et al., 2002) . In the present study, we found that there are usually two or four IGHG genes in marine mammals (Fig. 1) . Like other mammals, the IGHG gene in marine mammals comprises three CH domains and a hinge segment. Furthermore, they have close sequence similarities to the IGHG genes in their terrestrial relatives. Based on the phylogenetic tree, it was found that IGHG genes within one species clustered together rather than with those of other species (Fig. 2) . However, the IGHG genes of five species grouped together with their true orthologues in closely related species, including bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, Yangtze finless porpoise, Weddell seal and Pacific walrus, likely due to the species of Delphinidae (e.g., dolphin, killer whale) rapidly diverging during a very narrow time frame of \u223c3 million years (Zhou et al., 2011b) from the last common ancestral IGHG genes. These observations provided evidence to support the view that species-specific duplication of IGHG genes occurred during the evolution of mammalian species (Wagner et al., 2002) . Overall, the presence of IgG subclasses and species-specific duplication of IGHG genes in marine mammals further confirmed the finding that IGHC genes of marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives.\n\nThe number of IGHC genes has been noted to vary among different mammals. For example, 2 IGHA genes were present in humans and platypuses (Mage et al., 2006) , whereas 13 IGHA genes were found in rabbits (Mccallum et al., 2004) . For IGHG genes, seven copies were found in horses (Wagner et al., 2004) , five in humans (Takahashi et al., 1982) , and only one in rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) and opossum . No IGHG gene was detected in the bowhead whale and little brown bat (Fig. 1) , which may due to the bad genomic assembly of both species considering that IgG subclasses have been identified in other whales (Mancia et al., 2006) and partial sequence encoding of IgG in little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) was recovered by PCR (Butler et al., 2011) . We also failed to retrieve IGHD genes from the genomes of sperm whale, hedgehog, European shrew, little brown bat, black flying fox and elephant despite considerable efforts (Fig. 1) . One possible explanation is the poor genome quality, and the an alternative explanation is that the IGHD gene might have really been lost in evolution, similar to the situation in opossums ) and rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) . Further investigations to recover IGHD transcript by PCR will be needed in the future. Despite necessary further verification of IGHC genes in some species(e.g. with transcript evidence), changes in the copy number of IGHC genes among different mammalian lineages might reflect the rapid evolution of Ig genes (Hsu et al., 2006) , corresponding to the marked variability found in the pathogens in different environments.\n\nTo detect the possible roles of positive selection during the evolution of IGHC genes in mammalian lineages, evolutionary analyses were conducted using a series of selection models implemented in the CODEML program and DataMonkey website. Because of the absence of intact IGHD genes in many mammals and the species-specific duplication of IGHG genes, only datasets of the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were used to test the selection. Site model analysis of all mammals revealed that the models incorporating positive selection (M8) fit the data significantly better than the neutral model (M8a) for both the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas no evidence of positive selection was identified at the IGHE genes (Table 2) . Specially, M8 model detected nine positively selective sites at the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas a total of 39 codons from the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were also found to be under positive selection using the FEL, REL, and SLAC methods implemented in Datamonkey. Eleven codons from three genes (5 in IGHM, 2 in IGHE, 4 in IGHA) were predicted to be robust sites under positive selection identified by at least two ML methods. Furthermore, TreeSAAP analysis showed that these 11 positively selected sites have undergone radical changes in their physicochemical properties (Table 3) , and this may be regarded as another evidence to support significant positive selection. Then, we marked the putatively selected sites in the alignment and found that 36.4% (4/11) of these sites were located in, or close to, the functionally important regions of IGHC genes (Supplemental Fig. 14) . This result suggested that positive selection on mammals may be the major driving force for the evolution of IGHC genes to adapt to environmental pathogens. Besides, for expanded subclasses, such as the 13 IGHA genes of rabbit and multiple copies of IGHG gene in mammals, we tested whether this species-specific expansion has been influenced by positive selection. The site model analysis (M8 vs. M8a, M1a vs. M2a implemented in PAML) showed that the IGHA genes of rabbits were under positive selection with similar positively selected sites (Supplemental Table 3 ). The branch-site model was used to examine whether some branches leading to gene duplication of IGHG genes (branch a-o) have been positively selected. The results showed that signals of positive selection were detected in branches a (Delphinoidea), c (Physeter catodon), e (Bos taurus), f (Sus scrofa), g (Equus caballus), and h (Macaca mulatta) (Supplemental Table 4 , Supplemental Fig. 15 ). Overall, pervasive positive selection was detected on IGHC genes of mammals.\n\nAs is well known, many physicochemical properties, such as temperature, pressure, illumination and osmotic pressure, are different between water and land environments, possibly causing the difference in the diversity and abundance of pathogens. To date, there has been no deterministic conclusion on whether the pathogenic microbes in marine environment or in terrestrial environment are more diverse. Some early studies have supported weaker pathogenic pressure in the water environment (Zhang et al., 2016; Trowsdale et al., 1989; Slade, 1992) , while several recent studies have examined the microbiome of marine mammals, suggesting that although the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in marine mammals is distinct from those of terrestrial mammals, its diversity is not lower than that of terrestrial mammals (Bik et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2015) .\n\nTo further test whether marine and terrestrial mammals were subjected to different pathogenic pressures during their evolution, we used the branch model in our study. The LRTs showed that the free-ratio model fits better than one-ratio model for IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes, indicating heterogeneous selective pressures on different lineages. The \u03c9 values greater than 1 are limited to some branches in marine and terrestrial mammals, including the terminal branch of minke whale, the last common ancestral (LCA) branch of baleen whales, the LCA branch of Glires, and the LCA branch of Euarchontoglires at IGHA gene; the terminal branch of bowhead whale, and the LCA branch of Eulipotyphla at IGHE genes; the LCA branch of Laurasiatheria at IGHM gene (Fig. 1) , suggesting similar selective pressures acting on IGHC genes in marine and terrestrial mammals. This result could provide evidence to support that the diversity and abundance of pathogens in water was comparable to that in land.\n\nWe also used more stringent branch-site model to predict positive selection acting on specific sites in each lineage. Almost all signs of positive selection were identified in terrestrial lineages (e.g., artiodactyla, perissodactyla, chiroptera, eulipotyphla, primates, Glires, Fig. 1 . Positive selection at IGHC genes across the mammal phylogeny and the presence/absence patterns of mammal IGHC genes. A widely accepted phylogeny of mammals was used for selective pressure analysis in the free ratio model and the branch-site model. The branches indicated by vertical lines or circles show evidence of undergoing positive selection. The red font indicates marine mammals; black font indicates terrestrial mammals. The IGHC genes of corresponding species were listed in the right part of Fig. 1 . Each circle represents a gene member; circles represent a complete gene sequence; semicircles indicate a partial gene sequence; red cross means no sequences found by TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches; black cross means the gene really lost; the species highlighted with a black line mean a pseudogene. Table 4 ). By contrast, for marine mammal lineages, only the terminal branch of Florida manatee was subjected to positive selection (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 4 ). This result supported that pathogenic pressure was weaker in aquatic environment than in terrestrial environment. Moreover, recent studies showed a very low number of variable genes that directly binds to antigens in marine mammals, which also supported this conclusion (Olivieri et al., 2014) . But further study on the variable region will be needed, providing insights to understand whether the difference in selective pressure between marine and terrestrial mammals existed and whether such a difference could respond to the different pathogenic pressure between aquatic and land environments.\n\nIn the present study, IGHC genes were determined to have undergone positive selection in Chiroptera, which is now known as notorious reservoir hosts for a number of pathogenic viruses, including Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) responsible for severe human and livestock disease outbreaks. However, they rarely display clinical symptoms (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang, 2009 ). The ability of bats to coexist with viruses presents an interesting immunological problem. Previous studies have founded that some immunoglobulin gene superfamilies underwent expansion in Brandt's bat (Seim et al., 2013) and that some positively selected genes were involved in the immune response (Zhang et al., 2013) . Thus, IGHC genes subject to positive selection in chiropterans may be related to the longterm coexistence of bats and viruses. Evidences for positive selection has also been detected in some domesticated mammals such as pig, horse and cattle. Approximately 10,000 years ago, the domestication of farm animals by selection for biological, agricultural and biomedical importance began, leading to animals that slowly adapted to local condition. Approximately 200 years ago, selection pressures on livestock increased with the rise of the concept of breeds (Taberlet et al., 2008) . It has been previously proposed that artificial selection indirectly drove for rapid adaptation of domestic animals and pathogen genes (Smith et al., 2012) . Therefore, we postulated that artificial selection resulted in the adaptive evolution observed in IGHC genes of domestic animals.\n\nThis study has provided the first characterization of IGHC genes in marine mammals and explored their potential molecular genetic basis in the secondary aquatic adaptation. Our analyses revealed that the IGHC genes in marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives. In addition, different levels of selection were detected between marine and terrestrial mammalian lineages with the branchsite model, suggesting a divergent adaptation to land and aquatic environments probably due to contrasting pathogenic pressures. Further investigation on the variable region of IgH genes is necessary to improve our understanding of the immune adaptation of marine mammals. \n\nNone. 0.990 0.0526114 P \u03b1 , P \u03b2 , P c , K\u00b0, pK', pH i , P r , \u03b1 c , \u03b1 n , R a , P 11 345 0.0287169 0.0361345 57.5523 P \u03b1 , N s , P r , p, \u03b1 c , R a , H t , P 8 a Radical changes in amino acid properties under categories 6-8 were detected in TreeSAAP.
