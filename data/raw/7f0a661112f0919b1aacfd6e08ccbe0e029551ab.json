This rhythm is endogenous, but can be entrained to a dierent cycle by the environment, e.g., changes in the light cycle (Johnson, 1992) .

The biochemical mechanism of the biological clock is of fundamental importance in the regulation of many cellular systems (Morse et al., 1990) . Although some progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of the biological clock, it is not yet completely understood.\n\nCircadian rhythm is exhibited by the secretory pathway in exocrine glands in the rat. Sreebny and Johnson (1969) were the \u00aerst to show that there is a diurnal variation in the secretion and storage of secretory proteins in the parotid gland of the rat. Rats are nocturnal animals that feed mostly during the night and rest during the daylight hours. The exocrine glands discharge the contents of secretory granules during feeding and there is a substantial decrease in the glandular stores of secretory proteins by the end of the night. The partial depletion of these proteins triggers an increase in the rate of synthesis. During the day, when the secretory protein content has been restored, the rate of synthesis decreases (Sreebny et al., 1971) . Morphological studies of acinar cells of rat parotid glands revealed time-dependent changes in the structures of acinar cells (Albegger et al., 1975 (Albegger et al., , 1977 . The maximum volume of the cells and the secretory granules occurs in the evening at the start of the eating cycle and the minimum volume is seen in the morning.\n\nIn the rat pancreas, secretory granules and other organelles involved in the secretory process are decreased in volume during the dark or feeding period and the volume of secretory granules is restored during the \u00aerst hours of the light period (Mu\u00c8 ller and Gerber, 1985) . Exocrine pancreatic secretion in rats also has a circadian rhythm, with secretory rates increasing in the dark period and decreasing during the light period (Maouyo et al., 1993) .\n\nvon Ebner's glands, also known as lingual serous glands, are exocrine glands in the oral cavity. They are minor salivary glands embedded in the muscle tissue of the tongue beneath the vallate papillae and foliate furrows (Hand, 1970; Hand et al., 1999) . These glands secrete two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and lingual amylase. Lingual lipase digests triacylglycerols at the acid pH of the stomach, producing diacyl-and monoacylglycerols and fatty acids. This preduodenal fat digestion is especially important when there is pancreatic insuciency, as in the premature and neonatal animal, or in disease states such as cystic \u00aebrosis (Field and Scow, 1983; Field and Hand, 1987; Field et al., 1989) . von Ebner's glands dier from other minor salivary glands in that they are not muco-or mucoserous glands but serous glands in most species (Hand et al., 1999; see Nalavade and Varute, 1972 for exceptions). In addition, regulation of protein secretion from these glands is similar to the pancreas and dierent from the parotid gland. Major protein secretion in von Ebner's glands (Field and Hand, 1987) and the pancreas (Peikin et al., 1979) is stimulated by cholinergic agonists, whereas in the parotid gland proteins are secreted after b-adrenergic stimulation (Johnson and Sreebny, 1973; Garrett and Thulin, 1975) . To our knowledge there have been no reports on circadian rhythm in von Ebner's glands.\n\nThe purpose of the current work is to investigate the eects of the 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and constant light on the morphology of, and the secretion and storage of two digestive enzymes in, von Ebner's gland.\n\nFor 1 week before the start of the experiment, male Sprague\u00b1Dawley rats, 7 weeks old, 284 2 5 g, were housed one animal per cage under controlled lighting conditions of either 12 h light/dark (lights on at 8 a.m. and o at 8 p.m.) or continuous light. The rats used in the light/dark cycle were from the breeding colony at the DVA Medical Center and were progeny of rats from Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC, certi-\u00aeed free of sialodacryodenitis and rat corona viruses. For the experiments with continuous light, virus-free rats were obtained from Harlan Sprague\u00b1Dawley Inc., Indianapolis, IN. For each experiment, three to six rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with sodium nembutal (50 mg/kg), killed by exsanguination at 8 a.m. or 3 p.m., and their tongues removed. The total number of rats on which enzyme assays were performed was 17 and 18 from the continuous and light/dark experiments, respectively. The entire von Ebner's gland was dissected (0.05\u00b10.10 g wet wt) from the tongue and each gland was frozen on dry ice. For morphological examination, portions of von Ebner's glands were separately dissected from near the circumvallate papilla and foliate furrows of 12 and 14 rats from the continuous and light/dark lighting groups, respectively, and placed in \u00aexative. The excision of von Ebner's gland from the tongue was done with the aid of a dissecting microscope at \u00c210 magni\u00aecation.\n\nThe rats were allowed access to a commercial pelleted diet and water ad libitum. Food was weighed at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the day before killing, and again at 8 a.m. on the day of death. Care was taken to include pieces of food that had fallen into the cages. The food consumed during the period from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. was considered to be the p.m. sample. The food consumed from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. was considered to be the a.m. sample. The data are expressed as grams of food eaten per hour per rat. The total weight (g) of food consumed and the total weight (g)/rat in each time period and light cycle are also presented. The percentage of the a.m. or p.m. samples of the total food eaten in 24 h/rat was calculated.\n\nThe samples were \u00aexed in 4.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.15 M sucrose, 0.001 M CaCl 2 , and 2.5% dimethylsulphoxide, pH 7.4, then post\u00aexed in osmium and embedded in EMbed 812, as previously described (Yu and Redman, 1990) . Semithin sections (approx. 0.1 mm) were cut, mounted on glass slides and stained with methylene blue and Azur II (Richardson et al., 1960) .\n\nHistometric analysis was as previously described (Yu and Redman, 1990) . In brief, one slide from each of two blocks from each gland area (vallate and foliate) of each animal was selected for analysis based on technical quality. Technical considerations in the selection of slides included the presence of a sucient number of acini in the section, clarity of staining, and the absence of artefactual scattering of the secretory granules due to proximity to razor cuts. These selected slides were randomized and coded by a laboratory technician in order to ensure that all measurements were made blind. Areas of entire acinar cells and portions of these cells occupied by secretory granules were measured and tallied using Jandel's software SigmaScan by tracing the camera lucida images on a digitizing pad. The digitizing pad was calibrated to mm 2 . Ten acinar cells were measured on each slide. Only cells that both bordered a lumen and contained a nucleus were used. The average of the 20 cells (two slides per animal per gland area) so measured was the value used for comparisons.\n\nEach frozen gland was homogenized in 3 ml glucose-free Tyrode's solution with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) for 30 s. The generator was washed with l ml glucose-free Tyrode's solution. The homogenate was centrifuged at 850 g for 15 min at 48C. The supernatant was divided into two tubes so that the sample was thawed only once before performing the lingual lipase and amylase assays. The samples were stored in a \u00c0708C freezer.\n\nThe sample was thawed and diluted 1:50 with saline. Activity was determined by the method of Field and Scow (1983) . A unit of lingual lipase activity is de\u00aened as a micromole of fatty acid produced per minute at 378C.\n\nThe sample was thawed and diluted 1:5 with pH 5.9 NaH 2 PO 4 /NaCl buer used in the assay. Activity was determined by the method of Bernfeld (1955) . A unit of amylase activity is de\u00aened as a milligram equivalent of maltose formed in 3 min at 308C.\n\nThe radioisotopes used in the lingual lipase assay, tri [9,10-3 H]oleoylglycerol and [9,10-3 H]oleic acid, were from Dupont NEN Research Products, MA. All other chemicals were reagent grade.\n\nThe Student t-test was performed using StatView for the data shown in Table 1 and in Fig. 2 . Comparisons were made between a.m. and p.m. for each light Table 2 were evaluated by the Student\u00b1 Newman\u00b1Keuls method using SigmaStat. Dierences were considered statistically signi\u00aecant when p < 0.05.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , there were signi\u00aecant dierences between the a.m. and p.m. rates of feeding under both lighting conditions and also between light/dark or continuous light for a.m. and p.m. measurements. The rats housed under the light/dark conditions consumed 711.9 g or 31.0 2 0.9 g/rat in the 15 h from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., or 88% of the food consumed in 24 h. However, after 7 days of continuous lighting, 299.9 g or 14.3 2 1.0 g/rat was consumed during these hours or 45% of the food. Under light/dark conditions, 96.3 g or 4.2 2 0.8 g/rat (12%) was consumed in the 9 h from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. compared to 392.6 g or 17.8 2 1.1 g/ rat (55%) under continuous lighting conditions. The total amount of food consumed/rat in 24 h was similar under either condition, 35.1 2 1.3 g for light/dark compared to 31.8 2 1.1 g for continuous light, p = 0.063.\n\nThe results of the histometric analysis of the areas of the cells and the secretory granules are shown in Table 2 . As there were no signi\u00aecant dierences between the vallate papillae and foliate furrows, the data were combined and comparisons were made on the average of area estimates of both gland areas for 40 cells for each rat. The dierences in both the areas of the cells and of the secretory granules between the a.m. and p.m. samples were signi\u00aecant under both lighting conditions. The dierences in the areas of cells and secretory granules for the a.m. samples between light/dark and continuous light also were signi\u00aecant. However, for the p.m. samples, there was no signi\u00aecant dierence between the two lighting conditions. These data re\u00afect the changes in the feeding pattern brought about by the light changes. For the light/dark samples, the p.m. areas were greater than the a.m. areas for both cells and secretory granules. In the continuous-light samples, this order was reversed. The areas of the p.m. samples of light/dark and continuous light were now close to each other.\n\nPhotomicrographs of sections of lingual serous glands are seen in Fig. 1 . As there were no signi\u00aecant dierences between the vallate papillae and foliate furrows for the areas of the acinar cells and their secretory granules, the origin of the tissues was not considered when selecting the illustrations. In Fig. 1 we see that circadian rhythm is maintained when the cycle is light/dark. After a night of eating in the dark, the cells are small and depleted of secretory granules (Fig. 1a) . During daylight non-eating hours, the area of secretory granules is increased, and the cells are enlarged (Fig. 1) . The reverse is seen under continuous lighting conditions. The a.m. sections (Fig. 1c) have larger cells with more secretory granules than in the p.m. sections (Fig. 1d) .\n\nActivities of lingual lipase and amylase remaining in the tissue at the time of death are shown in Fig. 2 . The a.m. and p.m. data were averaged and these averages added together to get a value for the total enzyme activity in the gland at two speci\u00aec times of the 24-h day. remaining was 58.3 2 4.5% in the a.m. and 41.7 2 3.3% in the p.m. samples, p = 0.01. The a.m. samples under light/dark were signi\u00aecantly dierent from continuous light for lingual lipase, p = 0.0007 and amylase, p = 0.0004. The p.m. samples under the dierent light conditions were signi\u00aecantly dierent, p = 0.0002 and 0.0062 for lingual lipase and amylase, respectively. These results revealed that, under light/ dark conditions, in the a.m. (after the dark period), enzyme activity in the gland has been depleted, however the p.m. enzyme activity has been replenished. Whereas, with continuous lighting, the reverse is seen, with more enzyme activity remaining in the a.m. than in the p.m.\n\nAlthough von Ebner's glands dier from other minor glands in most species in that they are pure serous glands (Hand, 1970; Hand et al., 1999) and they dier from the parotid, a major exocrine salivary gland, in the regulation of protein secretion (Field and Hand, 1987) , the results shown here indicate that they do resemble other exocrine glands with regard to light entrainment and circadian rhythm. These experiments show that changes in circadian (24-h periodicity) rhythm are entrained by light in rat von Ebner's gland. Continuous lighting aects the time of food consumption, and the discharge of the secretory granules con- taining enzyme activity of two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and amylase. These events were observed by assays of enzyme activity remaining in the gland at 8 a.m. or 3 p.m. and changes in the morphology of von Ebner's gland at these times, under exposure to either light/dark or continuous-light conditions. Under normal light conditions, rats eat in the dark and discharge their exocrine-gland secretory granules containing digestive enzymes during the eating period. The experiments described here con\u00aerm that this occurs in von Ebner's glands. These events have been seen in other exocrine glands such as the parotid (Sreebny and Johnson, 1969; Sreebny et al., 1971; Albegger et al., 1975 Albegger et al., , 1977 and the pancreas (Mu\u00c8 ller and Gerber, 1985; Maouyo et al., 1993) . When the light was on 12 h and o 12 h, the rats consumed most of their food during the dark hours (Table 1) . The acinar cells were smaller and the secretory granules occupied less space in the cells when the rats were killed at 8 a.m. than when they were killed at 3 p.m. At 3 p.m., the secretory granules have been restored due to protein synthesis and storage so that they will be ready to be released when needed during the dark feeding time.\n\nHowever, when the light was on constantly the usual circadian rhythm was not maintained. There was more daytime eating under the conditions of continuous light than light/dark. The total amount of food consumed/rat in 24 h was similar under either condition (cf. Rosenwasser et al., 1981) . Changes in morphology of the acinar cells and secretory granules and the enzyme activity of lingual lipase and amylase remaining in the glands were almost reversed, with large cells and more activity at 8 a.m. and less at 3 p.m. than was observed under light/dark conditions. These results correlate with the amount of food consumed from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. or from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe observed reversal in the rhythm of feeding and enzyme activity remaining in the gland and morphological changes after 7 days of constant light suggests that a 1.5 h/day shift in circadian rhythm occurred. However, we cannot determine from our experiments exactly what phase changes in circadian rhythm actually occurred in the 7 days of continuous illumination. Siegel (1961) observed that with a normal light/dark cycle and ad libitum food and water intake, the maximum feeding of rats was during the dark hours. Under continuous light, this pattern was gone in 6 days, with more feeding during the usual daylight hours and less during the normal nightime hours. They also observed a return to the original feeding pattern by day 6 when the lighting conditions were returned to light/dark. Mice raised in continuous light have a displaced circadian rhythm with periods between 25.0 and 25.6 h (Ascho, 1960) . In addition, Rosenwasser et al. (1979) , when measuring food consumption in rats under continuous illumination, found no dierence in the daily total amount of food consumed whether in light/dark or continuous light, but in continuous light the rhythm was attenuated from 24 h in light/dark to 24.25\u00b124.7 h. These \u00aendings are consistent with the observations described here.\n\nWe have shown that light entrainment aects the eating cycle of rats. However, we do not know whether light entrainment it aects enzyme synthesis and storage in von Ebner's gland per se or whether the morphological and enzyme changes we observed were a consequence of the changes in the eating cycle that was entrained by light. In a review article, Johnson (1992) has ennumerated many experiments that indicate that metabolic response to eating is not a response to circadian changes, but rather a response to feeding changes that are entrained by light. However, there has been some indication that some digestive enzyme secretion is independent of food consumption. In the rat exocrine pancreas, a minor cycle of secretion was found that was independent of food intake (Maouyo et al., 1993) . Further experiments are needed to determine whether signi\u00aecant changes in morphology and Recently, circadian rhythms have been studied from a genetic viewpoint to ascertain more about molecular control and entrainment (Dunlap, 1998) . Genes have been cloned that make protein components of the biochemical clock. Mutations in these genes have been shown to alter or even abolish circadian rhythms. Among these are per, tim and doubletime in Drosophila melanogaster (Young, 1998) , frq in Neurospora crassa, (Aronson et al., 1994) and Clock in mice (Vitaterna et al., 1994) . These studies will further clarify the genetic and biochemical factors that are involved in the pathway of light-entrained circadian rhythm."}
