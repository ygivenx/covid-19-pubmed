{"title": "", "body": "Microorganisms (or microbes) are organisms which can only be individually seen by microscopy. Many do not cause disease in humans and act as normal colonizers of human hosts. Complex interactions between pathogens, which are capable of causing diseases, the host and the environment lead to clinical infections. Pathogens fall into five main groups:\n\nWith the advent of new and broader spectrum antibiotics, improved environmental hygiene, and advances in microbiological techniques it was widely expected that the need for diagnosis of infectious agents in tissue would diminish in importance. This assumption underestimated the infinite capacity of infectious agents for genomic variation, enabling them to develop antimicrobial resistance and exploit new opportunities to spread infections which are created when host defenses become compromised. The following are currently the most important factors influencing the presentation of infectious diseases: \u2022 The increased mobility of the world's population through tourism, immigration and inter national commerce has distorted natural geographic boundaries to infection, exposing weaknesses in host defenses, and in knowledge. \u2022 Immunodeficiency states occurring either as part of an infection, e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or as an iatrogenic disease. As treatment becomes more aggressive, depression of the host's immunity occurs, enabling organisms of low virulence to become life-threatening, and may allow latent infections, accrued throughout life, to reactivate and spread. \u2022 Emerging, re-emerging and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as the tubercle bacillus and staphylococcus are a constant and growing threat. \u2022 Adaptive mutation occurring in microorganisms allows them to jump species barriers and exploit new physical environments. Such adaptation allows infections to evade host defenses and resist agents of treatment. \u2022 Bioterrorism has become an increasing concern.\n\nThe world's public health systems and primary healthcare providers must be prepared to address varied biological agents, including pathogens which are rarely seen in developed countries. High-priority agents include organisms which pose a risk to national security because they:\n\n\u2022 Can easily be disseminated or transmitted from person to person.\n\n\u2022 Cause high mortality, with potential for a major public health impact.\n\n\u2022 May cause public panic and social disruption, and require special action for public health preparedness. The following are listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States as high-risk biological agents:\n\nThese factors, acting singly or together, provide an ever-changing picture of infectious disease where clinical presentation may involve multiple pathological processes, unfamiliar organisms, and modification of the host response by a diminished immune status.\n\nThe term 'microorganism' has been interpreted liberally in this chapter. Space limitation precludes a comprehensive approach to the subject, and the reader is referred to additional texts e.g. von Lichtenberg (1991) and Mandell et al. (2014) for greater depth. The organisms in Table 16 .1 are discussed and techniques for their demonstration are described.\n\nMost infectious agents are rendered harmless by direct exposure to formal saline. Standard fixation procedures should be sufficient to kill microorganisms, one exception being material from those with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other prion diseases. It has been shown that well-fixed tissue, paraffin-processed blocks and stained slides from CJD cases remain infectious when introduced into susceptible animals. Treatment of fixed tissue or slides in 96% formic acid for 1 hour followed by copious washing inactivates this infectious agent without adversely affecting section quality (Brown et al., 1990) . Laboratory safety protocols should cover infection containment in all laboratory areas and the mortuary, or necropsy area, where handling unfixed material is unavoidable. When available, unfixed tissue samples should be sent for microbiological culture, as this offers the best chance of rapid and specific identification of etiological agents, even when heavy bacterial contamination may have occurred.\n\nThe diagnosis of illness from infectious diseases generally starts with clinical presentation of the patient, and in most cases a diagnosis is made without a tissue sample being taken. Cases which rely on tissue diagnosis range from autopsy specimens, where material maybe plentiful and sampling error presents little problem, through to cytology samples where cellular material is often scarce and lesions may be easily missed. A full clinical history is always important, especially details of the patient's ethnic origin, immune status, any recent history of foreign travel and current medication.\n\nThe macroscopic appearance of tissue may often give a clear diagnosis of infection. Those with frank pus, abscess formation, cavitation, hyperkeratosis, demyelination, pseudo-membrane formation, focal necrosis and granulomas can provide evidence of infection. These appearances are often non-specific but occasionally in hydatid cyst disease or some helminth infestations the appearances are diagnostic.\n\nThe microscopic appearance of routine stained sections at low-power magnification often reveals indirect evidence of the presence of infection, e.g. neutrophil or lymphocytic infiltrates, granuloma formation, micro-abscesses, eosinophilic aggregates, Charcot-Leyden crystals and caseous necrosis. Some of these appearances may be sufficiently reliable to provide an initial, or at least provisional diagnosis, and allow treatment to be started, even if the precise nature of the suspect organism is never identified, particularly in the case of tuberculosis. At the cellular level, the presence of giant cells e.g. Warthin-Finkeldy or Langhans' type may indicate measles or tuberculosis respectively. Other cellular changes which include intra-cytoplasmic edema of koilocytes, acantholysis, spongiform degeneration of the brain, margination of chromatin, syncytial nuclear appearance, 'ground-glass' changes in the nucleus or cytoplasm, or inclusion bodies, can indicate infectious etiology. At some stage in these processes, suspect organisms may be visualized.\n\nIt should be understood, a well-performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) method will stain many organisms. Papanicolaou stain and Romanowsky stains, e.g. Giemsa, will also stain organisms together with their cellular environment. Other infectious agents are poorly visualized by routine stains and require special techniques to demonstrate their presence. This may be due to the small size of the organism, as in the case of viruses, where electron microscopy is needed. Alternatively, the organism may be hydrophobic or weakly charged, as with mycobacteria, spirochetes and cryptococci, in which case the use of specific histochemical methods is required for their detection. When organisms are few in number, fluorochromes may be used to increase the microscopic sensitivity of a technique. Finally, the following two techniques offer the possibility of specific identification of microorganisms which extend to the appropriate strain level.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (see Chapter 19) is now a routine and invaluable procedure in the histopathology laboratory for the detection of many microorganisms. There are many commercially available antibodies for viral, bacterial and parasitic organisms. Most methods today utilize (strept) avidin-biotin technologies. These are based on the high affinity that (strept)avidin (Streptomyces avidinii) and avidin (chicken egg) have for biotin. Both possess four binding sites for biotin, but due to the molecular orientation of the binding sites fewer than four molecules of biotin will actually bind. The basic sequence of reagent application consists of primary antibody, biotinylated secondary antibody, followed by either the preformed (strept) avidin-biotin enzyme complex or the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique or by the enzyme-labeled streptavidin. Both conclude with the substrate solution. Horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatases are the most commonly used enzyme labels.\n\nThe application of molecular techniques for the detection of microorganisms has arguably revolutionized the diagnosis of infection. These methods represent a rapidly expanding and exciting field, particularly when considering novel and emerging infections. However, testing must be undertaken rationally and appropriately in order to produce meaningful results (Procop, 2007) . Conventional staining may lack sensitivity and specificity to detect and speciate microorganisms. Microbial culture is not viable from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. In comparison, molecular identification of pathogens is rapid with high sensitivity and specificity and can be applied to a variety of histological specimens (Rogers et al., 2009) .\n\nCommon molecular techniques used include direct hybridization and nucleic acid amplification (often referred to under the umbrella term of polymerase chain reaction -PCR) (Procop, 2007) . In situ hybridization (ISH) uses reporter synthetic DNA probes which hybridize and label specific RNA sequences in target microbes present in the sample. This technique is most useful when type or genus of the microorganism has been elucidated, e.g. to identify the exact species of staphylococcus or yeast. It has been used successfully to detect and accurately differentiate a range of morphologically related organisms such as Legionella spp., filamentous bacteria and fungi in tissue samples (Hayden et al., 2001 (Hayden et al., , 2003 Isotalo et al., 2009) .\n\nPCR relies on the detection of unique regions of microbial DNA or RNA following the extraction and amplification of genetic material from specimens, and can be used to diagnose microbial infections from autopsy tissues and surgical specimens. Whilst fresh/frozen tissues provide the best-quality nucleic acids for analysis, DNA and RNA extracted from FFPE samples can be used successfully for PCR testing. A number of specific PCRs have been developed and applied to detect a range of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites in histopathological specimens (Denison et al., 2011; Surat et al., 2014; Rickerts, 2016; Gebhardt et al., 2015) .\n\nSince formalin cross-links proteins and nucleic acids resulting in significant degradation, it is essential to begin processing of specimens as quickly as possible, ensuring that a 10% concentration of formalin is used for fixation, and making certain that fixation times are kept to less than 48 hours (von Ahlfen et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2008; Srinivasan et al., 2002.) . Individual PCRs are useful when a particular infecting organism is suspected; in contrast, micro-array and multiplex PCR has the ability to identify a variety of related and unrelated microorganisms simultaneously from a single sample (Fukumoto et al., 2015) . Broader still, although less sensitive, are pan-bacterial and pan-fungal 16S and 18S RNA PCR probes which will detect the presence of any bacterial or fungal RNA. Further analysis and sequencing of any relevant genetic material identified is used to characterize the species.\n\nA benefit of investigating samples using PCR analysis is the generation of quantitative data which indicate the microbial burden. This aids interpretation of results, as the presence of an organism does not necessarily mean infection. Indeed, PCR positivity may be misleading if the patient has been exposed to prior antimicrobial agents or where the microorganism persists despite clinical resolution, as is the case with many respiratory viral infections (Lehners et al., 2016) . Although relatively expensive, molecular methods of diagnosis are becoming increasingly routine and available with less restrictive costs.\n\nThese techniques have a unique role to play in the identification of novel infectious diseases from histological samples, particularly at autopsy, for example, pandemic influenza virus (Shieh et al., 2010) , and will continue to play a key role in the detection of emerging infections and bioterrorist attacks (Hajjeh et al., 2002) . In addition, as technology advances, it is now possible to obtain detailed genetic sequencing information which provides important information relating to microbial transmission, virulence and resistance mechanisms. This is increasingly important in an age of global communities and the advent of unprecedented antimicrobial resistance. However, further studies are still required to answer a more fundamental question, which is whether molecular testing improves patient outcomes, and this is an area for future work. In summary, molecular methods offer the ability to make a rapid and accurate diagnosis of infection of a broad range of potential pathogens. It is vital that these tests are used judiciously and interpreted with care.\n\nWhilst modern advances in technique are important, emphasis is also placed upon the ability of the microscopist to interpret suspicious signs from a good H&E stained section. The growing number of patients whose immune status is compromised, or those who can mount only a minimal or inappropriate response to infection, further complicates the picture. This justifies speculative use of special stains, such as those for mycobacteria and fungi on tissue from such patients. It should be remembered, that for a variety of reasons, negative results for the identification of an infectious agent do not exclude its presence. In particular, administration of antibiotics to the patient before a biopsy is often the reason for failure to detect a microorganism in tissue.\n\nWhen bacteria are present in large numbers, in an abscess or vegetation on a heart valve, they appear as blue-gray granular masses with an H&E stain. However, organisms are often poorly visible, and can be obscured by cellular debris. The reaction of pyogenic bacteria to the Gram stain, together with their morphological appearance (i.e. cocci or bacilli) provides the basis for a simple historical classification (Table 16 .2).\n\nThe use of known positive control sections with all special stain methods for demonstrating microorganisms is essential. Results are unsafe in the absence of positive controls, and should not be considered valid. The control section should be appropriate, where possible, for the suspected organism. For example, a pneumocystis-containing control should be used for demonstrating Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously called carinii). A Gram control should contain both Grampositive and Gram-negative organisms. Post-mortem tissues have previously been a good source of control material, although medico-legal issues have now limited this in some countries. Alternatively, a suspension of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms can be injected into the thigh muscle of a rat shortly before it is sacrificed for some other purpose. Grampositive and Gram-negative organisms can also be harvested from microbiological plates, suspended in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), centrifuged, and small amounts mixed with minced normal kidney, then chemically processed along with other tissue blocks (Swisher & Nicholson, 1989) .\n\nIn spite of more than a century since Gram described his technique in 1884, its chemical rationale remains obscure. Staining is due to a mixture of factors, the most important being cell wall thickness, chemical composition and the functional integrity of the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. When these bacteria die, they become Gram negative. The following procedure is only suitable for the demonstration of bacteria in smears of pus and sputum. It may be of value to the pathologist in the necropsy room where a quick technique such as this may enable rapid identification of the organism causing a lung abscess, wound infection, septicemic abscess or meningitis. Gram method for bacteria in smears (Gram, 1884) Method 1. Fix dry film by passing it three times through a flame or placing on a heat block. 2. Stain for 15 seconds in 1% crystal violet or methyl violet, and then pour off excess. 3. Flood for 30 seconds with Lugol's iodine, pour off excess. 4. Flood with acetone for no more than 2-5 seconds, wash with water immediately. 5. Alternatively decolorize with alcohol until no more stain comes out. Wash with water. 6. Counterstain for 20 seconds with dilute carbol fuchsin, or freshly filtered neutral red for 1-2 minutes. 7. Wash with water and carefully blot section until it is dry.\n\nGram-positive organisms blue/black Gram-negative organisms red (Churukian & Schenk, 1982) Sections Formalin-fixed, 4-5 \u03bcm, paraffin wax embedded sections.\n\nCrystal violet, 10% alcoholic 2 ml Distilled water 18 ml Ammonium oxalate, 1% 80 ml Mix and store; always filter before use.\n\nIodine 2 g Potassium iodide 4 g Distilled water 400 ml\n\nDissolve potassium iodide in a small amount of the distilled water, add iodine and dissolve; add remainder of distilled water.\n\nEthyl alcohol, absolute 50 ml Acetone 50 ml\n\nBasic fuchsin or pararosaniline 0.5 g Distilled water 100 ml\n\nDissolve with aid of heat and a magnetic stirrer.\n\nBasic fuchsin solution (stock) 10 ml Distilled water 40 ml\n\nPicric acid-acetone Picric acid 0.1 g Acetone 100 ml\n\nWith concerns over the explosiveness of dry picric acid in the lab, it is recommended that you purchase the picric acid-acetone solution pre-made. It is available through most histology suppliers.\n\nAcetone 50 ml Xylene 50 ml Method 1. Deparaffinize and rehydrate through graded alcohols to distilled water. 2. Stain with filtered crystal violet solution for 1 minute.\n\nRinse well in distilled water. 4. Place in iodine solution for 1 minute. 5. Rinse in distilled water, blot slide but NOT the tissue section. 6. Decolorize by dipping in alcohol-acetone solution until the blue color stops running. (One to two dips only!) 7. Counterstain in working basic fuchsin for 1 minute. Be sure to agitate the slides well in the basic fuchsin before starting the timer. 8. Rinse in distilled water and blot slide but not section. 9. Dip in acetone, one dip. 10. Dip in picric acid-acetone until the sections have a yellowish-pink color. 11. Dip several times in acetone-xylene solution.\n\nAt this point, check the control for proper differentiation. (Go back to picric acid-acetone if you need more differentiation.) 12. Clear in xylene and mount.\n\nGram-positive organisms, fibrin, some fungi, Paneth cell granules, kerato-hyalin, and keratin blue Gram-negative organisms red Nuclei red Other tissue elements yellow\n\nDo not allow the tissue sections to dry at any point in the staining process. If this occurs after treatment with iodine, decolorization will be difficult and uneven. (Twort, 1924; Ollett, 1947) \n\nFormalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded. \n\nThese organisms are difficult to demonstrate by the Gram technique as they possess a capsule containing a long-chain fatty acid (mycolic acid) which makes them hydrophobic. The fatty capsule influences the penetration and resistance to removal of the stain by acid and alcohol (acid-and alcoholfastness), and is variably robust between the various species which make up this group. Phenolic acid, and frequently heat, are used to reduce surface tension and increase porosity, thus forcing dyes to penetrate this capsule. The speed with which the primary dye is removed by differentiation with acid alcohol is proportional to the extent of the fatty coat. The avoidance of defatting agents or solvents, such as alcohol and xylene in methods for Mycobacterium leprae, is an attempt to conserve this fragile fatty capsule.\n\nMycobacteria are PAS positive due to the carbohydrate content of their cell walls. However, this positivity is evident only when large concentrations of the microorganisms are present. When these organisms die, they lose their fatty capsule and consequently their carbol fuchsin positivity. The carbohydrate can still be demonstrated by Grocott's methenamine silver reaction, which may prove useful when acid-fast procedures fail, particularly if the patient is already receiving therapy for tuberculosis.\n\nA possible source of acid-fast contamination may be found growing in viscous material sometimes lining water taps and any rubber tubing connected to them. These organisms are acid-and alcohol-fast but are usually easily identified as contaminants by their appearance as clumps, or floaters, above the microscopic focal plane of the section.\n\nTreat with Gram's iodine for 3 minutes. 5. Rinse in tap water, blot dry, and complete drying in a warm place. 6. Differentiate in preheated acetic alcohol until no more color washes out (2% acetic acid in absolute alcohol, preheated to 56\u00b0C). This may take 15-20 minutes; the section should be light brown or straw colored. 7. Rinse briefly in distilled water. 8. Stain in Twort's for 5 minutes. 9. Wash in distilled water. 10. Rinse in acetic alcohol until no more red runs out of the section; this only takes a few seconds. 11. Rinse in fresh absolute alcohol, clear, and mount.\n\nGram-positive organisms blue/black Gram-negative organisms pink/red Nuclei red Red blood cells and most cytoplasmic structures green Elastic fibers black\n\nFormalin or fixative other than Carnoy's, paraffin wax embedded.\n\nCarbol fuchsin commercially available, or Basic fuchsin 0.5 g Absolute alcohol 5 ml 5% aqueous phenol 100 ml\n\nMix well and filter before use.

Gimenez method for Helicobacter pylori (Gimenez, 1964; McMullen et al., 1987) Sections Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded. \n\nWash thoroughly in distilled water. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until section is blue-green to the naked eye. 7. Blot sections dry, and complete drying in air. 8. Clear and mount.\n\nred/magenta Background blue/green\n\nThe greatest problem with this method is overstaining or irregularity of staining with Malachite green. It is also valuable in demonstrating the Legionella bacillus in post-mortem lung smears.\n\nFormalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded.\n\nToluidine blue in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer Sorenson's phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 50 ml 1% aqueous toluidine blue 1 ml Method 1. Deparaffinize and rehydrate through graded alcohols to distilled water. 2. Stain in buffered toluidine blue for 20 minutes. 3. Wash well in distilled water. 4. Dehydrate, clear, and mount.\n\nWarthin-Starry method for spirochetes (Warthin & Starry, 1920) \n\nFormalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded.\n\nAcetate buffer, pH 3.6 Sodium acetate 4.1 g Acetic acid 6.25 ml Distilled water 500 ml\n\nSilver solution 1% silver nitrate in pH 3.6 acetate buffer\n\nDissolve 0.3 g of hydroquinone in 10 ml pH 3.6 acetate buffer, and mix 1 ml of this solution and 15 ml of warmed 5% Scotch glue or gelatin; keep at 40\u00b0C. Take 3 ml of 2% silver nitrate in pH 3.6 buffer solution and keep at 55\u00b0C. Mix these two solutions immediately before use.\n\nDeparaffinize and rehydrate through graded alcohols to distilled water. 2. Celloidinize in 0.5% celloidin, drain and harden in distilled water for 1 minute. 3. Impregnate in preheated 55-60\u00b0C silver solution for 90-105 minutes. 4. Prepare and preheat developer in a water bath. 5. Treat with developer for 3 1 / 2 minutes at 55\u00b0C.\n\nSections should be golden-brown at this point. 6. Remove from developer and rinse in tap water for several minutes at 55-60\u00b0C, then in buffer at room temperature. 7. Tone in 0.2% gold chloride. 8. Dehydrate, clear, and mount.\n\nIt is wise to take a few slides through at various incubation times to ensure optimum impregnation.\n\nImmunohistochemistry techniques for demonstrating Helicobacter species also exist. (Steiner & Steiner, 1944;  modified Swisher, 1987) Sections Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded. Refrigerate and discard after 1 month.\n\nGum mastic 2.5 g Absolute alcohol 100 ml Allow to dissolve for 24 hours, then filter until clear yellow before use. Refrigerate any unused portion.\n\nHydroquinone 1 g Distilled water 25 ml Make fresh solution for each use.\n\nMix 10 ml of 2.5% gum mastic, 25 ml of 2.0% hydroquinone and 5 ml absolute alcohol. Make just prior to use and filter with #4 filter paper; add 2.5 ml of 0.04% silver nitrate. Do not filter this solution.\n\nWhen the gum mastic is added, the solution will take on a milky appearance. \n\nBring all solutions to room temperature before using. All glassware making contact with silver nitrate should be chemically cleaned. Avoid the use of metal forceps in silver solutions. When doing a bacterial screen, Gram controls should be run along with diagnostic slides. As spirochetes take longer to develop, Gram controls should be used in addition to spirochete controls. When Gram controls have a yellow appearance, remove them to distilled water, and check under microscope for microorganisms. Return to silver solution if they are not ready, and repeat, realizing that spirochetes will take longer. Most solutions can be made in large quantities and kept in the refrigerator.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is an important and common bacterial pathogen which may be resistant to common antibiotic treatments. It usually causes skin and soft tissue infections such as boils, wound and burn infections, and can also lead to a cavitating pneumonia in children and adults. Septicemic states may occur and are associated with the formation of multiple deep foci of infection including endocarditis. Microscopically staphylococci appear as Gram-positive clusters. Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) is a common cause of meningitis, and may produce a fulminating septicemia (meningococcal sepsis). Organisms can be seen in histological sections of meningococcal meningitis, but are difficult to identify because they are usually within neutrophil cytoplasm.\n\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) is the cause of gonorrhea. Organisms may be seen within polymorphs in sections of cervix, endometrium or Fallopian tubes in cases of gonorrhea but, again, are difficult to find. Members of the Neisseria family are generally difficult to see in histological sections, although easily detectable in smears of fresh pus or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), characteristically in pairs. They are easier to detect using the Gram-Twort method.\n\nLactobacillus acidophilus (D\u00f6derlein's bacillus) is a normal inhabitant of the human vagina and is seen in cervical smears taken in the secretory phase of the cycle.\n\nCorynebacterium vaginale is a short Gramnegative bacillus which may cause cervicitis, and is present in about 6% of women of childbearing age. It may be seen in cervical smears where it accumulates as blue-stained masses on the surface of squamous cells stained by Papanicolaou's method, with these cells being known as 'clue cells'.\n\nHelicobacter pylori is frequently seen in gastric biopsies. This spiral Vibrio organism is implicated as the organism causing many cases of chronic gastritis. They are seen as small, weakly hematoxyphilic organisms (usually in clumps) in the lumina of gastric glands, often adherent to the luminal surface of the epithelial cells. With practice, these can be identified from an H&E stain. However, Warthin-Starry, Steiner, Gimenez, toluidine blue or cresyl violet acetate methods demonstrate them more clearly. A commercial specific antiserum has recently become available for their demonstration.\n\nClostridium difficile causes pseudomembranous colitis, an inflammation of the large bowel. This arises following the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; the balance of the normal anaerobic gut microflora is disturbed, allowing the organism to proliferate unchecked. C. difficile is difficult to stain but the 'volcano lesions' of purulent necrosis are a good indicator.\n\nListeria monocytogenes is the cause of a rare form of meningitis and may cause septicemia in humans. Focal necrosis with macrophages which contain tiny intracellular rods arranged in a 'Chinese letter' formation, and staining variably with the Gram stain, are the hallmarks of this disease.\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is the second leading cause of death from an infectious agent worldwide and remains a significant pathogen in developed countries. Disease results in the familiar caseating granulomatous lesion and its associated 1-2 \u03bcm, blunt-ended, acid-and alcohol-fast bacilli. In some regions such as Africa, tuberculosis is commonly associated with HIV infection, causing major morbidity and mortality.\n\nMycobacterium avium/intracellulare are representatives of a group of intracellular opportunistic mycobacteria which are frequently present in the later stages of immunosuppression, particularly associated with HIV/AIDS. They frequently persist in spite of treatment, and are often fatal. The lesions produced are non-caseating and consist of collections of vacuolated macrophages which often contain vast numbers of organisms. On occasion, there is little evidence of a cellular reaction on an H&Estained section, and the organism is detected only by routinely performing an acid-fast stain, such as the ZN, on all tissue from HIV/AIDS patients. This group also includes M. kansasii.\n\nMycobacterium leprae is an obligate intracellular, neurotrophic mycobacterium which attacks and destroys nerves, especially in the skin. The tissue reaction to leprosy depends on the immune status of the host. It can be minimal with a few macrophages packed with crescentic, pointed, intracytoplasmic bacilli (lepromatous leprosy), or may contain scanty organisms and show florid granulomatous response (tuberculoid leprosy). M. leprae is only acid-fast and is best demonstrated with the modifed Fite method (see page 261).\n\nLegionella pneumophila was first identified in 1977 as the cause of a sporadic type of pneumonia with high mortality. The small Gram-negative coccobacillus is generally spread in aerosols from stagnant water reservoirs, usually in air-conditioning units. The bacterium may be difficult to stain except with the Dieterle and modified Steiner silver stains, and specific antiserum.\n\nTreponema pallidum is the organism causing syphilis, and is infrequently seen in biopsy specimens when the primary lesion or 'chancre' is diagnosed clinically. The spirochete is quite obvious using dark-ground microscopy as an 8-13 \u03bcm corkscrew shaped microorganism which often kinks in the center (Fig. 16.2) . Dieterle, Warthin-Starry or modified Steiner methods may demonstrate the organism. In addition, a specific antiserum is also available.\n\nLeptospira interrogans is a spirochete organism causing leptospirosis or Weil's disease. The disease is spread in the urine of rats and dogs, causing fever, profound jaundice, and sometimes death. Spirochetes can be seen in the acute stages of the disease where they appear in Warthin-Starry and modified Steiner techniques as tightly wound 13 \u03bcm microorganisms with curled ends resembling a shepherd's crook.\n\nIntestinal spirochetosis appears as a massive infestation on the luminal border of the colon by the spirochete Brachyspira aalborgi (Tomkins et al., 1986) . It measures 2-6 \u03bcm long, is tightly coiled and arranged perpendicularly to the luminal surface of the gut, giving it a fuzzy hematoxyphilic coat in an H&E stain. There is no cellular response to the presence of this spirochete. It is seen well with the Warthin-Starry and the modified Steiner techniques.\n\nCat-scratch disease presents as a self-limiting, local, single lymphadenopathy appearing about 2 weeks after a cat scratch or bite. Histologically the node shows focal necrosis or micro-abscesses. Two Gram-negative bacteria, Afipia felis and Bartonella henselae have been implicated. It is difficult to demonstrate on paraffin sections because of the timing or maturation factor of the bacterium, but the modified Steiner and the Warthin-Starry methods are valuable techniques for demonstrating this organism.\n\nFungi are widespread in nature, and humans are regularly exposed to the spores from many species. The most commonly encountered fungal diseases are the superficial mycoses which affect the subcutaneous or horny layers of the skin or hair shafts, and cause conditions such as athlete's foot or ringworm. These dermatophytic fungi belong to the Microsporum, Trichophyton and Epidermophyton groups and may appear as yeasts or mycelial forms within the keratin. They are seen quite well in the H&E stain, but are demonstrated better with the Grocott and PAS stains. As with other infections, the increase in the number of patients with diminished or compromised immune systems has increased the incidence of systemic mycoses, representing opportunistic attacks by fungi, frequently of low virulence, but often fatal if untreated.\n\nWhen fungi grow in tissue they may display primitive asexual (imperfect) forms which appear as either spherical yeast or spore forms. Some may produce vegetative growth which appears as tubular hyphae which may be septate and branching. These features are important morphologically for identifying different types of fungi. A mass of interwoven hyphae is called a fungal mycelium. Only rarely, when the fungus reaches an open cavity, the body surface, or a luminal surface such as the bronchus, are the spore-forming fruiting bodies called sporangia or conidia, produced.\n\nSome fungi may elicit a range of host reac tions from exudative, necrotizing to granulomatous whereas other fungi produce little cellular response to indicate their presence. Fortunately, most fungi are relatively large, and their cell walls are rich in polysaccharides which can be converted by oxidation to dialdehydes and thus detected with Schiff's reagent or hexamine-silver stains. Fungi are often weakly hematoxyphilic and can be suspected on H&E stains. Some fungi, e.g. sporothrix, may be surrounded by a stellate, strongly eosinophilic, refractile Splendore-Hoeppli precipitate of host immunoglobulin and degraded eosinophils.\n\nFluorochrome-labeled specific antibodies to many fungi are available, and are in use in mycology laboratories for the identification of fungi on fresh and paraffin wax sections. These antibodies have not found widespread use on fixed tissue, where identification still relies primarily on traditional staining methods.\n\nAn H&E stain, a Grocott methenamine (hexamine)-silver (GMS), a mounted unstained section to look for pigmentation and a good color atlas (Chandler et al., 1980) when experience fails, permit most fungal infections to be identified sufficiently for diagnoses. However, there is no substitute for microbiological culture. (Gomori, 1946; Grocott, 1955; Swisher & Chandler, 1982) Sections Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded.

It can cause a chronic suppurative infection, actinomycosis, which is characterized by multiple abscesses drained by sinus tracts. Actinomycotic abscesses can be found in the liver, appendix, lung and neck. The individual organisms are Gram-positive, hematoxyphilic, non-acid-fast, branching filaments 1 \u03bcm in diameter. They become coated in 'clubs' of Splendore-Hoeppli protein when the organism is invasive. These clubs are eosinophilic, acid-fast, 1-15 \u03bcm wide and up to 100 \u03bcm long, and stain\n\nFungi, Pneumocystis, melanin black Hyphae and yeast-form cells sharply delineated in black of fungi Mucins and glycogen taupe to dark gray/ brown Background pale green Notes a. Incubation time is variable and depends on the type and duration of fixation, and organism being demonstrated. Impregnation is controlled microscopically until fungi are dark brown.\n\nBackground is colorless at this point. Over-incubation produces intense staining of elastin and fungi which may obscure fine internal detail of the hyphal septa. This detail is essential for critical identification, and is best seen on under-impregnated sections. To avoid excess glycogen impregnation in liver sections, section may be digested prior to incubation. A water bath may be used effectively to insure an even incubation temperature. b. Borax ensures an alkaline pH. c. Sodium bisulfite removes excess chromic acid. d. Some workers prefer a light H&E counterstain. This is especially useful when a consulting case is sent with only one slide, providing morphological detail for the pathologist. e. Solutions a and b need to be made and stored in chemically clean glassware (20% nitric acid), as does the working solution. This includes graduates and Coplin jars. Do not use metal forceps. f.

This arrangement of a clump of actinomyces or fungal-like hyphae, which measures 30-3000 \u03bcm, surrounded by eosinophilic protein, is called a 'sulfur' granule and is also an important identification marker for other fungal groups. These granules may be macroscopically visible and their yellow color is an important diagnostic aid. Nocardia asteroides is another actinomycete. It is filamentous and may be visible in an H&E stain, but it is Grocott-positive and variably acid-fast using the modified ZN for leprosy. However, it is difficult to demonstrate even with the acid-fast bacillus techniques. Its pathology is similar to that of actinomycosis, but its organisms are generally more disseminated and it tends to cause invasive infection in the immunocompromised.\n\nCandida albicans is a common yeast, but with immunosuppression may become systemic. It infects the mouth (thrush), the esophagus, the vagina (vaginal moniliasis), the skin and nails, and may be found in heart-valve vegetations. It is seen as both ovoid budding yeast-form cells of 3-4 \u03bcm, and more commonly as slender 3-5 \u03bcm, sparsely septate, non-branching hyphae and pseudo-hyphae. Whilst difficult to see on H&E, this organism is strongly Gram-positive, and is obvious with the Grocott and PAS techniques.\n\nAspergillus fumigatus is a soil saprophyte and a commensal in the bronchial tree. It may infect old lung cavities (Fig. 16. 3) or become systemic in immunosuppressed patients. The fungus has broad, 3-6 \u03bcm, parallel-sided, septate hyphae showing dichotomous (45 degree) branching. It may be associated with Splendore-Hoeppli protein and sometimes forms fungal balls within tissue. This fungus may be seen in an H&E stain and is demonstrated well with a PAS or Grocott. When it grows exposed to air, the conidophoric fruiting body may be seen as Aspergillus niger, a black species which can cause infection of the ear.\n\nZygomycosis is an infrequently seen disease caused by a group of hyphated fungi belonging mainly to the genera Mucor and Rhizopus. They have thin-walled hyphae (infrequently septate) with nonparallel sides, ranging from 3 to 25 \u03bcm in diameter, branch irregularly, and often show empty bulbous hyphal swelling. Grocott and PAS are the staining methods of choice (Figs. 16.4 and 16.5) .\n\nCryptococcus neoformans exists solely in yeastform cells, is variable in diameter, 2-20 \u03bcm, with ovoid, elliptical and crescentic forms frequently seen. There is an extensive mucopolysaccharide coat around the yeasts which is mostly dissolved during processing, but when present, appears as a halo around the organism and is visible with special stains such as Mayer's or Southgate's mucicarmine procedures. Yeasts may be free form or within the Fig. 16 .3 A strong hematoxylin (Ehrlich's) and eosin stain will show the fine detail of many infectious agents. The hyphal structure identifies this as Aspergillus fumigatus which was colonizing an old tuberculosis cavity in the lung. cytoplasm of giant cells, staining faintly with an H&E stain. The PAS and Grocott procedures demonstrate these cells well. Infection is found in the lungs and in the brain within the parenchyma or in the leptomeninges. Often, these patients are immunosuppressed.\n\nHistoplasma capsulatum is another soil-dwelling yeast which can cause a systemic infection in humans called histoplasmosis. It is especially common along the southern border of the United States, and where there are large bird populations. The organism is usually seen within the cytoplasm of macrophages which appear stuffed with small, regular, 2-5 \u03bcm yeast-form cells which have a thin halo around them in H&E and Giemsa stains. Langhans' giant cells, forming non-caseating granulomas may be present. PAS and Grocott stains demonstrate this fungus well ( Fig. 16.6) .\n\nPneumocystis jiroveci. There is still some debate over the taxonomy of this organism, although analysis of its ribosomal RNA has placed it nearer to a fungal than a protozoan classification (Edman et al., 1988) . It came to prominence as a pathogen following immunosuppressive therapies associated with renal transplants in the 1960s, and has become a life-threatening complication of HIV. It most frequently causes pneumonia, where the lung alveoli are progressively filled with amphophilic, foamy plugs of parasites and cellular debris. It is found rarely in other sites such as the intestines and lymph nodes. The cysts are invisible in an H&E stain, and can barely be seen in a Papanicolaou stain as they appear refractile when the microscope condenser is racked down. Specific immunohistochemistry is available to use, otherwise, Grocott methenamine-silver is recommended. Only electron microscopy or an H&E stain on a resin-embedded thin section will show their internal structure. The cysts are 4-6 \u03bcm in diameter and contain 5-8 dot-like intracystic bodies. The cysts rupture and collapse, liberating the trophozoites which can be seen as small hematoxyphilic dots in a good H&E and Giemsa stain; these attach to the alveolar epithelium by surface philopodia.\n\nRickettsial organisms, e.g. those causing Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever or typhus, rarely need to be demonstrated in tissue sections. They can sometimes be seen with a Giemsa stain, or by using the Macchiavello technique which also demonstrates some viral inclusion bodies (Fig. 16.7) . \n\nWhilst the cytopathic effects of viruses can often be seen in a good H&E stain, and may be characteristic of a single viral group, the individual viral particles are too small to be seen with the light microscope, and require an electron microscope to reveal their structure. This may allow a rapid and accurate diagnosis in viral infections. Some viruses aggregate within cells to produce viral inclusion bodies which may be intranuclear, intracytoplasmic or both. These inclusion bodies may be acidophilic and usually intranuclear, or can be basophilic and cytoplasmic. Most special staining methods are modified trichromes using contrasting acid and basic dyes to exploit these differences in charges on the inclusion body and the host cell. These methods include Mann's methyl blue-eosin stain for the Negri bodies of rabies, Macchiavello's method, and more recently the elegant Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine stain. Unfortunately, the need for optical differentiation in these methods increases the chance of technical error.\n\nThe introduction of commercially available monoclonal immunohistology to viruses, which are either class or species specific, has revolutionized the tissue detection of viruses. Hepatitis B virus is a good example of the diagnostic value of this technique where the surface antigen (also known as HBs or Australia antigen) and the core antigen (HBc) can be specifically detected immunohistochemically, providing clinically important information about the stage of the disease. More recently, nucleic acid hybridization probes and PCR testing have become available and can be used to detect genomically inserted viral nucleic acid in situ, in cells and tissues that are frozen or formalin fixed. It should be remembered, however, that the detection of microorganisms using nucleic acid probes, unlike specific biotinylated antiserum, does not necessarily mean active disease.

Viral hepatitis is caused by a number of viral infections. The hepatitis viruses (HV) A, B, C, D, and E show great biological diversity and are clinically the most common viruses which primarily affect the liver. The liver is the target organ and damage varies with the viral strain, ranging from massive acute necrosis to chronic 'piecemeal necrosis' of liver cells, leading to cirrhosis. An eosinophilic 'ground glass' appearance is seen in the cytoplasm of some hepatocytes due to dilated smooth endoplasmic reticulum which contains tubular HB surface antigen. It is this component which can be demonstrated using Shikata's orcein method, or by specific immunohistochemistry. \n\nbright red Red blood cells variably orange/red Nuclei blue/gray Background yellow\n\nAll tissue is stained red with phloxine, which is then differentiated by displacement with the counterstain tartrazine. The red color is first removed from muscle, then other connective tissues. Paneth cells, Russell bodies, and keratin can be almost as dye retentive as viral inclusions, and can occasionally be a source of confusion.\n\n(modified Shikata et al., 1974) \n\nFormalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded. \n\nand some mucins brown/black Background yellow\n\nThe success of this method largely depends on the particular batch of orcein used, and on freshly prepared solutions. This method relies on permanganate oxidizing of sulfur-containing proteins to sulfonate residues which react with orcein. Results compare well with those obtained using labeled antibodies, but the selectivity is inferior.\n\nHerpes viruses are usually acquired subclinically during early life and enter a latent phase, to be reactivated during times of immunological stress. These viruses cause blistering or ulceration of the skin and mucous membranes, but can cause systemic diseases, including encephalitis, in immunosuppressed or malnourished individuals. The cytopathic effects of the herpes virus are well seen in Tzanck smears of blister fluid, and include the margination of chromatin along nuclear membranes, Cowdry type A ('owl's eye') inclusion bodies, and syncytial ('grapelike') nuclei within giant cells.\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) causes congenital infections of newborns and can result in systemic disease in HIV and immunosuppressed patients. It is seen in the endothelial cells forming prominent intranuclear inclusions which spill into the cytoplasm where they form granular hematoxyphilic clusters. The CMV virus causes obvious cytomegaly in the cells it infects. All herpes viruses have an identical electron microscopic appearance of spherical, 120 nm, membrane-coated particles.\n\nPapilloma viruses are a family of about 50 wart viruses which cause raised verrucous or papillomatous skin warts, or flat condylomatous genital warts. Cytologically, evidence of hyperkeratosis may be present together with koilocytosis (irregular nuclear enlargement and cytoplasmic vacuolation forming perinuclear halos). Skin verrucas are associated with HPV 1-4 strains, genital condylomas with HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18, and cervical cancer with HPV 16 and 18. These uncoated viruses measure 55 nm, are mainly intranuclear, and can be detected using electron microscopy, or immunoperoxidase and gene probes on paraffin wax sections.\n\nJC (John Cunningham) virus is a polyomavirus (previously known as papovavirus) which causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease, in HIV and other immunosuppressed patients. Intranuclear hematoxyphilic inclusions may be seen within swollen oligodendrocytes.\n\nMolluscum virus produces a contagious wart in children and young adults called molluscum contagiosum. Large eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be seen in maturing keratinocytes on routine H&E sections, and are seen well with phloxine-tartrazine. The large 1 \u03bcm viral particles have a typical pox virus structure: brick-shaped with a superimposed figure-of-eight nucleic acid sequence. Rabies virus. This neurotrophic rhabdovirus forms intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions best seen in the axonal hillocks of hippocampal neurons of the brain. Macchiavello, phloxine-tartrazine, Mann's methyl blue-eosin or PAS stains are recommended. Note that given the pathogenicity of these agents, if suspected, the case should be passed to a relevant diagnostic center rather than a routine laboratory.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) consists of at least two retrovirus strains. The virus is best seen in cultured lymphocytes and is rarely seen in tissues from affected patients. It produces a distinctive neuro pathological lesion in HIV encephalitis consisting of microglial nodules, or stars, containing collections of giant cells, microglia and astrocytes. Synthetic nucleic acid probes have been prepared to identify HIV genomes.\n\nInfluenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (Fig. 16.8) . It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) every year in the United States, on average, 5-20% of the population suffers from the flu, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from flu complications, and about 36,000 people die from flu. More recently, concern about the influenza A H5N1 strain of bird flu has emerged. Some people, e.g. older people, young children and people with certain health conditions, are at high risk of serious flu complications.\n\nSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) can be severe respiratory illnesses caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) (Fig. 16.9) . SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. MERS-CoV is a novel coronavirus, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and the majority of cases emerging from the Arabian Peninsula. The risk of infection is linked to exposure to camels and subsequent outbreaks have occurred in healthcare facilities. The incidence and spread of MERS remains an ongoing matter of global public health importance.\n\nTo date, more than eight transmissible neurodegenerative diseases have been described affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The diseases caused by prions include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD), Germann-Straussler-Shienker disease, fatal familial insomnia and kuru in humans and in animals, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as 'mad cow disease'), scrapie (in goats and sheep), and chronic wasting disease (CWD) (in mule deer and elk). Prions are not microbes in the usual sense because they are not alive, but the illness they cause can be transmitted from one animal to another. All usually produce a characteristic spongiform change, neuronal death and astrocytosis in affected brains. The infectious agent is a prion, a small peptide, free of nucleic acid and part of a normal transmembrane glycoprotein which is not, strictly speaking, a virus. Antibodies have been prepared from prion protein which strongly mark accumulated abnormal protein in these diseases (Lantos, 1992) .\n\nThe CJD Surveillance Center in the USA is an invaluable source for monitoring and testing human prion disease in the United States. The Center is supported by the CDC and by the American Association of Neuropathologists. Visit their website (http://www. cjdsurveillance.com) for details on how to submit specimens for testing as they perform these tests at no charge for laboratories in the USA. In addition, both CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) also offer guidelines regarding the handling of suspected and known cases of prion disease. Visit http://www.cdc. gov and search for CJD for a fact sheet and other relevant information. WHO offers a manual in pdf form for downloading. It gives information about what to do should you find yourself with a suspected or known positive case in your laboratory: http://who.int/ bloodproducts/TSE-manual2003.pdf. Remember that these types of cases should never knowingly be handled in a routine histology laboratory. Contact your local health department for additional guidelines.\n\nThe identification of protozoa is most often made on morphological appearance using H&E and, particularly, Giemsa stains. The availability of antisera against organisms such as entamoeba, toxoplasma, and leishmania has made diagnosis much easier in difficult cases (Fig. 16.10a,b) . \n\nFixative is not critical, but B5 or Zenker's is preferred; thin, 3 \u03bcm paraffin wax sections (if Zenker's is not used, post-mordant in Zenker's in a 60\u00b0C oven for 1 hour before staining).\n\nGiemsa stock solution, commercially available or Giemsa stain powder 4 g Glycerol 250 ml Methanol 250 ml\n\nDissolve powder in glycerol at 60\u00b0C with regular shaking. Add methanol, shake the mixture.\n\nGiemsa stock 4 ml Acetate buffered distilled water, pH 6.8 96 ml detected in H&E-stained sections. The PAS, Grocott and ZN techniques are positive for these ova. Where the plane of section allows, the presence of a terminal spine to the ovum indicates S. haematobium, whereas S. mansoni and S. japonicum have lateral spines. Any good trichrome procedure will demonstrate worm development.\n\nEchinococcosis. Echinococcus granulosus is a tapeworm found in dogs, but humans and sheep may become intermediate hosts and develop hydatid cyst disease. These cysts form in many organs, particularly liver and lung. The walls of the daughter cysts are faintly eosinophilic, characteristically laminated, and produced by the worm, not by its host. The walls are PAS-positive and Congo redpositive, showing green birefringence. The scolicial hooklets survive inside old, burnt-out cysts, they have a diagnostic shape and stain brilliant yellow with picric acid."}
