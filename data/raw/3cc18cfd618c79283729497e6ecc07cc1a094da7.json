They normally exist as freeliving phagocytic soil amoebae (vegetative cells), but when bacterial prey become scarce, they aggregate to form a pseudoplasmodium (cf. true plasmodium of Eumycetozoida), that is capable of directed motion. The grex, or slug, migrates until stimulated by environmental conditions to form a fruiting body or sorocarp. The slug cells differentiate into elongated stalk cells and spores, where the cells are surrounded by a cellulose capsule. The spores are released from the sporangium at the tip of the stalk and, in favourable conditions, an amoeba emerges from the capsule, feeds, divides and so establishes a new population.

See actin binding proteins also centractin.\n\nactin binding proteins A diverse group of proteins that bind to actin and often link actin to other structures. Some bind to G-actin and prevent it from adding onto the linear F-actin filaments (e.g. profilin), or keep actin levels very low in the nuclear compartment (exportin-6) others act as nucleating centres for polymerization (e.g. hisactophilin and bacterial proteins such as ActA) or block the preferred assembly (barbed) end of filaments to stabilize their length (e.g. capZ). Some will cleave filaments (gelsolin), others link filaments to one another as isotropic gels (filamin) or bundles that may be parallel or antiparallel (e.g. villin), yet others attach bundles or individual filaments to membranes or membrane-embedded adhesion proteins. Microfilaments may have regulatory proteins associated with them that prevent the attachment of myosin unless calcium is present (tropomyosin); filaments may be linked to other cytoskeletal elements through various scaffolding proteins (IQGAPs) or to a membrane-skeleton (e.g. spectrin).

Similar to Actinophrys.\n\nactinotrichium One of the aligned collagen fibres (actinotrichia, ca 2 \u03bcm diameter) that provide a guidance cue for mesenchymal cells in the developing fin of teleost fish.\n\naction potential An electrical pulse that passes along the membranes of excitable cells, such as neurons, muscle cells, fertilized eggs and certain plant cells. The precise shape of action potentials varies, but action potentials always involve a large depolarization of the cell membrane, from its normal resting potential of 250 to 290 mV. In a neuron, action potentials can reach 130 mV, and last 1 ms. In muscles, action potentials can be much slower, lasting up to 1 s. action spectrum The relationship between the frequency (wavelength) of a form of radiation, and its effectiveness in inducing a specific chemical or biological effect. activated macrophage A macrophage (mononuclear phagocyte) that has been stimulated by cytokines or endotoxin and that has greatly enhanced cytotoxic and bactericidal potential. Classically activated (M1) macrophages are proinflammatory and kill pathogens, and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages produce anti-inflammatory factors. Brief overview: http://www.rndsystems.com/cb_ detail_objectname_SP04_MacrophageActivation.aspx. activation A very general term, but in the context of fertilization the changes in the egg brought about by contact with the spermatozoon. Activation is the first stage in development and occurs independently of nuclear fusion. The first observable change is usually the cortical reaction that may involve elevation of the fertilization membrane; the net result is a block to further fusion and thus to polyspermy. In addition to the morphological changes, there are rapid changes in metabolic rate and an increase in protein synthesis from maternal mRNA.\n\nactivation energy The energy required to bring a system from the ground state to the level at which a reaction will proceed. activation induced deaminase Enzyme (AID, cytidine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.5, 198aa) that acts on single-stranded DNA during replication and deaminates cytosine to uracil (the mismatch is then processed by base-excision or mismatch repair systems); a mechanism for generating diversity in B-cells for antibody production but strictly controlled in most cells. See ADAR.\n\nactivation loop A region on protein kinases of the AGC kinase class containing a conserved threonine residue (termed the activation loop site) phosphorylation of which is critical for their activity. In some cases autophosphorylation may occur. Analogous activation regions have been described in, for example, histone acetyltransferase. activation tagging A method used extensively in plant molecular biology; a T-DNA tagging vector containing four transcriptional enhancers derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus is used to randomly insert this T-DNA into the plant genome through Agrobacterium infection and leads to the over-expression of genes near to the inserted T-DNA. Activation-tagging vectors that confer resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin or the herbicide glufosinate have been developed and the method has allowed the generation of a wide range of gain-offunction mutants.\n\nactive immunity Immunity resulting from the normal response to antigen. Only really used to contrast with passive immunity in which antibodies or sensitised lymphocytes are transferred from the reactive animal to the passive recipient.\n\nactive site The region of a protein that binds to a substrate molecule(s) and facilitates a specific chemical conversion. Produced by juxtaposition of amino acid residues as a consequence of the protein's tertiary structure.\n\nactive transport Transport up a gradient of electrochemical potential or, more precisely, unidirectional or vectorial transport produced within a membrane-bound protein complex by coupling an energy-yielding process to a transport process. In primary active transport systems the transport step is normally coupled to ATP hydrolysis within a single protein complex. In secondary active transport the movement of one species is coupled to the movement of another species down an electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport.\n\nactive zone Site of transmitter release on the presynaptic terminal of a chemical synapse. At the neuromuscular junction active zones are located directly across the synaptic cleft from clusters of acetylcholine receptors. Evidence from conotoxin binding studies suggests that presynaptic calcium channels are exclusively localized at active zones.\n\nactivin Dimeric growth factors of the TGF\u03b2 family with growth and differentiation-promoting effects on a range of cell types in addition to its original role (FSH-releasing) in gonadal sites. Composed of two inhibin beta chains; since there are two isoforms, A (426aa) and B (407aa), there are three forms of activin, AA, BB and AB. The receptors are activin receptor-like kinases.\n\nactivin receptor-like kinases Receptors (ser/ thr protein kinases) for activin. Ligand binding stimulates the formation of a receptor complex consisting of two type II and two type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors which autophosphorylate, then bind and activate SMAD transcriptional regulators. Activin receptor 1 (ALK1, ACVRL1, EC 2.7.11.30, 503aa) is mutated in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. ALK2 (509aa) is defective in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. ALK3 (CD292, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A, 532aa) is a receptor for BMP-2 and BMP-4: defects cause a subset of juvenile polyposis syndrome cases. A number of other activin receptor-like kinases are known with variable specificty for TGF\u03b2-family ligands.\n\nactivin response factor ARF A multiprotein complex induced in early Xenopus blastomeres by activin, Vg-1 and TGF\u03b2, binds to activin-response element in the mix-2 homeobox gene. The ARF complex contains XMAD2, a Xenopus homologue of the Drosophila Mad gene product, and FAST-1, a winged-helix transcription factor. actobindin A G-actin binding protein (88aa with two beta-thymosin repeats, binds two actin molecules) from Acanthamoeba castellani that blocks actin polymerization. A very similar protein is found in Dictyostelium and homologous proteins in Drosophila and C. elegans have three beta-thymosin repeats.\n\nactolinkin Monomeric protein (20 kDa) from echinoderm eggs that was reported to link actin filaments by their barbed ends to the inner surface of the egg plasma membrane. Sole report:http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/pubmed?term5actolinkin\n\nactomere Site of actin filament nucleation in sperm of some echinoderms in which the acrosomal process is protruded by rapid assembly of a parallel microfilament bundle.\n\nactomyosin Generally: a motor system that is thought to be based on actin and myosin. The essence of the motor system is that myosin makes transient contact with the actin filaments and undergoes a conformational change before releasing contact. The hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to movement, through the requirement for ATP to restore the configuration of myosin prior to repeating the cycle. More specifically: a viscous solution formed when actin and myosin solutions are mixed at high salt concentrations. The viscosity diminishes if ATP is supplied and rises as the ATP is hydrolyzed. Extruded threads of actomyosin will contract in response to ATP.\n\nactophorin An actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) (138aa in Acanthamoeba castellanii) that will sever actin filaments (longer filaments being more rapidly severed) and sequester G actin. A member of the ADF/cofilin family. Binds ADP-G-actin with higher affinity than ATP-actin and binding is very sensitive to the divalent cation present on the actin. Has high sequence homology with vertebrate cofilin and destrin, echinoderm depactin and some plant ADFs but lacks the nuclear localization sequence found in the vertebrate ADFs.\n\nacumentin Protein that was named because it was thought to cap the pointed end of microfilaments, now known to be L-plastin (see plastins).\n\nacuminate Describing a structure that is slenderly tapered with an included angle of less than 45 .\n\nacute (1) Sharp or pointed.\n\n(2) Of diseases: coming rapidly to a crisis \u00c0 not persistent (chronic).\n\nacute inflammation Response of vertebrate body to insult or infection; characterized by redness (rubor), heat (calor), swelling (tumor), pain (dolor), and sometimes loss of function. Changes occur in local blood flow, and leucocytes (particularly neutrophils in the early stages) adhere to the walls of postcapillary venules (margination) and then move through the endothelium (diapedesis) towards the damaged tissue. Although acute inflammation is usually short-term and transient there are situations in which acute-type inflammation persists. acute phase proteins Plasma proteins that increase in concentration during acute inflammation, particularly C-reactive protein, orosomucoid and serum amyloid A protein. Other proteins also increase in level, including mannose-binding protein, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin, \u03b1-2-macroglobulin, blood clotting factors (Factors I-XII), complement components, ferritin, ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin. The levels of negative acute phase proteins decrease. acute phase reaction Response to acute inflammation involving the increased synthesis of various plasma proteins (acute phase proteins).\n\nacute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS A severe inflammatory reaction in the lung that can lead to fluid accumulation and effectively drowning. There may also be multiple organ failure. ARDS was formerly known as adult respiratory distress syndrome to differentiate it from infant respiratory distress syndrome which is caused by a deficiency of lung surfactant. See septic shock.\n\nacutely transforming virus Retrovirus that rapidly transforms cells, by virtue of possessing one or more oncogenes. Archetype: Rous sarcoma virus.\n\nACV (1) Aciclovir.\n\n(2) Alpha-aminoadipylcysteinylvaline, precursor for isopenicillin synthesis.\n\nACV synthase Enzyme (alpha-aminoadipylcysteinyl-valine synthase, EC 6.3.2.26, 3770aa in Emericella nidulans) responsible for an early step in cephalosporin synthesis. ACV is acted upon by isopenicillin N synthase to produce isopenicillin N. ACY1 A cytosolic, homodimeric, zinc-binding enzyme (aminoacylase 1, EC 3.5.14, 408aa) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acylated L-amino acids to L-amino acids. Function may be the salvage of acylated amino acids. Expression of the gene is reportedly reduced or undetectable in small cell lung carcinoma lines and tumours.\n\nacyclovir See aciclovir.\n\nacyl An organic radical or functional group derived from an organic acid by the removal of the carboxylic hydroxyl group. The general formula is -COR (or RCO-), where R is an organic group and there is a double bond between the carbon and oxygen. Common examples are formyl (from formic acid), acetyl (from acetic acid), benzoyl (from benzoic acid) amongst others.\n\nacyl homoserine lactone AHL An autoinducer involved in quorum sensing in some Gram-negative bacteria. AHL reaches a high concentration within the cell, and will trigger transcription, only if there are many cells nearby creating a high extracellular concentration of the autoinducer that will diffuse into the cell. First discovered as a regulatory mechanism for light emission by bioluminescent bacteria. Among Gram-positive bacteria, short peptides function as autoinducers.\n\nacylation Introduction of an acyl (RCO-) group into a molecule: for example the formation of an ester between glycerol and fatty acid to form mono-, di-, or tri-acylglycerol, or the formation of an aminoacyl-tRNA during protein synthesis. Acylenzyme intermediates are transiently formed during covalent catalysis.\n\nacyltransferase Enzymes of the class EC 2.3.1 that catalyse the transfer of acyl groups from a carrier such as acetylCoA to a reactant.\n\nADA See adenosine deaminase.\n\nADAM family A disintegrin and metalloprotease family of membrane-anchored peptidases that regulate cell behaviour by proteolytically modifying the cell surface and ECM. In some cases they are responsible for the proteolytic release of membranebound growth factors. Have both cell adhesion and protease activities. Members of the family include C. elegans MIG-17, alpha-secretase, TACE. A similar and related family are the ADAM metallopeptidases with thrombospondin Type 1 motif, ADAMTS.\n\nADAMTS ADAM metallopeptidases with a thrombospondin Type 1 motif, peptidases that are anchored to extracellular matrix through the binding of the thrombospondin motif to aggrecan. ADAMTS1 (967aa) cleaves aggrecan and may be involved in its turnover. Many others are known, all with generally similar properties but different substrate preferences.\n\nadaptation A change in sensory or excitable cells upon repeated stimulation, that reduces their sensitivity to continued stimulation. Those cells that show rapid adaptation are known as phasic; those that adapt slowly are known as tonic. Can also be used in a more general sense for any system that changes responsiveness with time \u00c0 for example by downregulation of receptors (tachyphylaxis) or through internal modulation of the signalling system, as in bacterial chemotaxis.\n\nadaptins See adaptor proteins, adaptor protein complex 3 and clathrin-associated adaptor complexes.\n\nadaptor protein complex 3 An adaptor complex (AP-3) that has a similar heterotetrameric structure to the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2, but is not clathrin associated and has different adaptin subunits (delta subunit AP3D1, 1153aa, beta subunit AP4B1, 1094aa or AP3B2, 1082aa; a medium adaptin, mu-type, AP3M1, 418aa or AP3M2, 418aa and a small adaptin sigma-type AP3S1, 193aa or AP3S2, 193aa). AP-3 may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. See BLOCS.\n\nadaptor proteins A general term for proteins that link multi-molecular protein arrays. See adaptor protein complex 3, clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes, low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1, signal-transducing adaptor proteins, transmembrane adaptor proteins (TRAPS).\n\nADAR Small family of adenosine deaminases (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA, EC 3.5.4.-, ADAR1\u00c03, editases) that edit adenosine residues to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Although this editing recodes and alters functions of several mammalian genes, its most common targets are noncoding repeat sequences, indicating the involvement of this editing system in currently unknown functions. ADAR1 (1226aa) is associated with the RNA surveillance protein HUPF1 (RENT1) in the supraspliceosome, ADAR2 (ADARB1, 741aa) is widely expressed in brain and other tissues and knock-out mice die young. Mice can be rescued by exonicallyedited AMPA receptor suggesting that mRNA for this receptor is major substrate for the enzyme. ADAR3 (739aa) may have a regulatory function. See ADAT1.\n\nADATs Human enzymes (adenosine deaminase, tRNA-specific; ADAT-1, 502aa; ADAT-2, 191aa; ADAT-3, 351aa) of the mammalian RNA-specific adenosine deaminase family (ADARs) that is involved in pre-mRNA editing of nuclear transcripts; ADAT1 deaminates adenosine-37 to inosine in eukaryotic tRNA(ala) and probably represents the human counterpart of the yeast protein Tad1p. ADAT-2 probably does the same to several tRNAs; ADAT-3 may be regulatory.\n\nadaxial The surface of a plant organ such as a leaf or petal that during early development faced towards the axis. In the case of leaves the upper surface is usually adaxial. Cf. abaxial.\n\nADCC See antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\nADDA An unusual hydrophobic amino acid (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-deca-4,6-dienoic acid) found in microcystins and nodularins and essential for their toxicity.

Characterized by extreme weakness, wasting, low blood-pressure and pigmentation of the skin. See polyendocrine syndrome. Not to be confused with Addison's anaemia (megaloblastic anaemia). See leukodystrophy, which can have similar effects.\n\nadditive effect An effect that is simply the sum of the effects of separate exposures to two (or more) agents under the same conditions and there is no synergistic effect. Proving synergy requires demonstrating that the agents together produce an effect that is greater than the maximum either can produce alone.\n\naddressins See selectins.\n\nadducin Calmodulin-binding protein associated with the membrane skeleton of erythrocytes.

The APC gene encodes a multidomain tumour suppressor (2843aa) that antagonises the wnt signalling pathway; mutations are associated with various tumours including gastric carcinomata. Cf. hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (see GTBP).\n\nadenomyoma See endometrioma.\n\nadenosine The nucleoside (9-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyladenine) formed by linking adenine to ribose. adenosine deaminase An enzyme (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4, 363aa) which deaminates adenosine and 2deoxyadenosine to inosine or 2 0 -deoxyinosine respectively. A rare autosomal recessive genetic defect in this enzyme is responsible for 20\u00c030% of cases of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) and was the first candidate disease for gene replacement therapy. ADA deficiency causes an increase of dATP, which inhibits S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, causing an increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine; both are particularly toxic to lymphocytes. See adenosine deaminase complexing protein.\n\nadenosine deaminase complexing protein A protein (ADCP2, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, EC 3.4.14.5, conversion factor, T-cell activation antigen CD26, 766aa) that forms a complex with adenosine deaminase and generates the tissuespecific forms. It is a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N terminus of polypeptides. It is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein involved in the costimulatory signal essential for T-cell receptor-mediated T-cell activation. ADCP1 is known but there is some doubt whether it is actually involved in ADA-complexes.\n\nadenosine receptors Various adenosine receptors (purinergic receptors) have been identified, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. All are seven membrane-spanning G-protein coupled receptors. There is considerable difference in properties of receptors from different species. A1 receptors (ADORA1, 326aa) and A3 (318aa) inhibit adenylyl cyclase whereas the A2A (412aa) and A2B (332aa) receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Do not confuse with adrenoreceptors (adrenergic receptors).\n\nadenosine triphosphate See ATP.\n\nadenosquamous Description of a benign tumour of epithelial origin (adenoma) in which cells have flattened morphology, as opposed to being cuboidal or columnar. adenoviral vector Vector used for gene transfer, usually replication defective due to a deletion in the E1 region (early genes). Many vectors also have deletions in E3 or E4. To produce infectious particles, plasmids containing the defective adenovirus genome and the gene to be expressed are introduced into cells constitutively expressing the E1A genes, such as human 293 cells. Have been used clinically for gene therapy (for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) but with untoward side effects in some cases and a fatality in one.\n\nAdenoviridae Large group of viruses first isolated from cultures of adenoids. The capsid is an icosahedron of 240 hexons and 12 pentons and is in the form of a base and a fibre with a terminal swelling; the genome consists of a single, linear molecule of double-stranded DNA. They cause various respiratory infections in humans. Some of the avian, bovine, human and simian adenoviruses cause tumours in newborn rodents, generally hamsters. They can be classified into highly, weakly and nononcogenic viruses from their ability to induce tumours in vivo though all of these groups will transform cultured cells. The viruses are named after their host species and sub-divided into many serological types e.g. Human Adenovirus type 3. See adenoviral vector.\n\nadenylate cyclase Enzyme (adenylyl cyclase, EC 4.6.1.1) that produces cAMP (cyclic AMP) from ATP and acts as a signal-transducer coupling hormone binding to change of cytoplasmic cAMP levels. The name strictly refers to the catalytic moiety, but it is usually applied to the complex system that includes the hormone receptor and the GTPbinding modulator protein (see GTP-binding proteins). There are multiple tissue-restricted isoforms.\n\nADF (1) In chicken, the term actin depolymerizing factor has been applied to both gelsolin and destrin; cofilin is similar in function to destrin but the product of a different gene. Gelsolin (brevin, homogenin, 778aa) is a calcium-regulated, actin-modulating protein that binds to the barbed ends of actin monomers or filaments, preventing monomer exchange (endblocking or capping). It can nucleate the assembly of monomers into filaments and sever pre-existing filaments at higher cvalcium concentrations. Destrin (165aa) severs actin filaments and binds to actin monomers. In Arabidopsis there are a number of ADFs (e.g. ADF-1, 139aa; ADF-10, 140aa). Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1). In humans there are seven ADH isozymes: three in class-I (alpha, beta, and gamma, all 375aa), one in class-II (ADH4, pi, 380aa), one in class-III (ADH5, chi, 374aa), one in class-IV (ADH7, 386aa) and one in class-V (ADH6, 368aa). They form homo or heterodimers and bind zinc. They catalyse the conversion of an alcohol to an aldehyde or ketone. They are not restricted to animals and a number are known from plants (e.g. in Arabidopsis, ADH Class III, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, 379aa, important for formaldehyde detoxification), archaea and bacteria. adherens junction Specialized cell-cell junction into which are inserted microfilaments (in which case also known as zonula adherens), or intermediate filaments (macula adherens or spot desmosomes).\n\nadhesins General term for molecules involved in adhesion, but applied more specifically in bacteriology to various surface components that generally seem to behave as lectins, binding to surface carbohydrates.

All are seven membrane spanning G-protein coupled receptors linked variously either to adenylate cyclase or phosphoinositide second messenger pathways. Three subgroups are usually recognized, the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors linked to G s , the \u03b11 linked to G i , and the \u03b12 linked to G q . The \u03b2-adrenergic receptor gene is unusual in having no introns.\n\nadrenocorticotropin A peptide hormone (ACTH, adrenocorticotrophin, 39aa) produced by the pituitary gland in response to stress (mediated by corticotrophin releasing factor, a 41aa peptide, from the hypothalamus). Stimulates the release of adrenal cortical hormones, mostly glucocorticoids. Derived from a larger precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin, by the action of an endopeptidase, that also releases \u03b2-lipotropin. Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH, melanotropin-alpha) consists of the N-terminal 13aa of ACTH. See also Table H2. adrenoleucodystrophy Demyelinating disease (X-linked Schilder's disease) with childhood onset, due to a mutation in the ABCD1 gene with the result that there is an apparent defect in peroxisomal beta oxidation and the accumulation of saturated very long chain fatty acids in all tissues of the body.\n\nadrenomedullin A vasodilator peptide (ADM, 52aa) related to calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). In addition to vasodilatory effects it has been reported that adrenomedullin protects a variety of cells against oxidative stress induced by stressors such as hypoxia, ischemia/reperfusion, and hydrogen peroxide through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway. Adrenomedullin-2 (intermedin, 148aa) may regulate gastrointestinal and cardiovascular activities through a cAMP-dependent pathway. The protective effects of adrenomedullin are in association with adrenomedullin binding protein-1 (AMBP-1, complement factor H, 1231aa). The receptors are RAMPs (receptor activity-modifying proteins adseverin An actin regulating protein (715aa) found in the adrenal medulla.

AEBP1 (aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein, 1158aa) has DNA-binding regions and may be a transcriptional repressor but probably does not have carboxypeptidase activity. It may positively regulate MAP-kinase activity in adipocytes, leading to enhanced adipocyte proliferation and reduced differentiation; also may enhance macrophage pro-inflammatory activity. AEBP2 (517aa) is a zinc-finger DNA-binding transcriptional repressor and a component of the PRC2/EED-EZH1 complex.\n\nAedes Genus of mosquitos, several of which transmit diseases of man. A. aegypti is the vector of the yellow fever virus.\n\nAequorea victoria Hydrozoan jellyfish (a coelenterate) from which green fluorescent protein (GFP) was isolated.

The deduced product of alpZ shares homology with \u03b3-butyrolactone autoregulator receptors.\n\nalpha blockers Class of vasodilatory drugs (\u03b1-adrenoceptor blockers) that block the effect of noradrenaline, which is a vasoconstrictor, on peripheral blood vessels.\n\nalpha complementation Complementation of assembly-incompetent mutants of E. coli \u03b2-galactosidase by a small (26aa) amino-terminal fragment of the lacZ product (the so-called alpha polypeptide) allows assembly of a functional tetramer that will convert X-gal to a blue product. By putting a polycloning site within the alpha-polypeptide gene fragment carried by a cloning vector, successful insertion of a sequence that is being cloned prevents complementation and restores the inactivity of \u03b2-gal.\n\nColonies with inserts are therefore white and can be selected. This strategy requires E. coli host strains, such as DH5a, with mutations that are subject to alpha-complementation, but has the advantage that the vector is small, allowing correspondingly large inserts.\n\nalpha factor Oligopeptide (WHWLQLKPGQPMY) mating pheromone of S. cerevisiae; exposure to this pheromone arrests yeast in G1 of the cell cycle and induces the shmoo phenotype. Binds to receptor coded by STE2. alpha-1-antitrypsin A serine peptidase inhibitor (\u03b1-1-antiprotease, serpinA1, 418aa) present in plasma and an important inhibitor of neutrophil elastase; also inhibits plasmin and thrombin.

Present in free form and in a complex with IgA; involved in regulation of the inflammatory process.\n\nalpha-2-macroglobulin Large (1474aa) plasma antipeptidase with very broad spectrum of inhibitory activity against all classes of proteases. Apparently works by trapping the peptidase within a cage that closes when the peptidase-sensitive bait sequence is cleaved. The peptidase is still active against small substrates that can diffuse into the cage, and the conformational change that closes the trap alters the properties of the \u03b1-2-macroglobulin molecule so that it is rapidly removed from circulation. Plasminogen activator is one of the few peptidases against which \u03b1-2-macroglobulin is ineffective.\n\nalpha-actinin A homodimer of antiparallel subunits (\u03b1-actinin-1, 892aa) that can link actin filaments end-to-end with opposite polarity. Originally described in the Z-disc, now known to occur in stress-fibres and at focal adhesions. The nonmuscle isoform (\u03b1-actinin-4, 911aa) contains EFhand motifs. Alpha-actinin-2 (894aa) is found in all skeletal muscle fibres, whereas \u03b1-actinin-3 (901aa) expression is limited to a subset of type 2 (fast) fibres and the absence of expression is common in endurance atheletes and rare in elite sprinters. An actinin-like actin-binding domain has been found in the N-terminal region of many different actin-binding proteins (e.g. beta chain of spectrin (or fodrin), dystrophin, ABP-120, filamin and fimbrin.). See calponin homology domain.\n\nA bifunctional mitochondrial enzyme (LKR/SDH, 926aa) involved in degradation of lysine.

In humans, lysosomal \u03b1-glucosidase (acid maltase, 952aa) is deficient in glycogen storage disease type 2. Neutral \u03b1-glucosidase AB (EC 3.2.1.84, \u03b1-glucosidase 2) is a heterodimer with a catalytic alpha subunit (GANAB, 944aa) and a beta subunit (glucosidase 2 subunit beta, PRKCSH, protein kinase C substrate 60.1 kDa protein heavy chain, 528aa) that has a regulatory function and is defective in polycystic liver disease. The enzyme is important in glycoprotein biosynthesis and cleaves sequentially the 2 innermost \u03b1-1,3-linked glucose residues from the high mannose oligosaccharide precursor of immature glycoproteins. There is also a neutral \u03b1-glucosidase C (EC 3.2.1.20, 914aa) . In E. coli \u03b1-glucosidase (maltodextrin glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.20, 605aa) may regulate the intracellular level of maltotriose.\n\nalpha-helix A particular helical folding of the polypeptide backbone in protein molecules (both fibrous and globular), in which the carbonyl oxygens are all hydrogen-bonded to amide nitrogen atoms three residues along the chain. The translation of amino acid residues along the long axis is 0.15 nm, and the rotation per residue, 100, so that there are 3.6 residues per turn.\n\nalpha-neurotoxins Postsynaptic neurotoxins, many varieties of which are found in snake venoms. Two subclasses, short (four disulphides, 60\u00c062aa) and long (five disulphides and 66\u00c074aa). Examples include alpha-bungarotoxin, alpha-cobratoxin, erabutotoxins.

Sequence motif searches within alsin predict the presence of Vps9, DH, and PH domains, implying that alsin may function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5 and a member of the Rho GTPase family. It seems to control survival and growth of spinal motoneurons ALT See alanine aminotransferase.\n\naltenusin An antifungal penicillide isolated from Alternaria sp. Non-competitive, specific neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) and strong pp60c-Src inhibitor.

Also reported to inhibit trypanothione reductase from Trypanosoma cruzi. alternative oxidase pathway Pathway of mitochondrial electron transport in higher plants, particularly in fruits and seeds, that does not involve cytochrome oxidase and thus is resistant to cyanide.\n\nalternative pathway See complement.\n\nalternative splicing The process whereby different exons are combined to form variants of a protein. This occurs before transcribed mRNA leaves the nucleus and as a result a single gene can encode several different mRNA transcripts, usually in a cell-or tissue-specific fashion. It is estimated that B80% of human genes are alternatively spliced: the commonest form is exon skipping, in which one or more exons are missing. Trans-splicing is the splicing of an identical short leader sequence, the spliced leader (SL), to the 5 0 ends of multiple mRNAs. Alternative Splicing Analysis Tool: http://www.altanalyze.org/ Alternative Splicing Database Project: http://www. ebi.ac.uk/asd/ altronate The base of altronic acid, a six-carbon dicarboxylic acid that is a product of uronic acid metabolism in E. coli a pathway in which glucuronic and galacturonic acid are isomerized to form their corresponding keto-analogues, fructuronic and tagaturonic acid, respectively. In the presence of reduced NAD, fructuronic acid is reduced to D-mannonic acid whereas tagaturonic acid yields n-altronic acid. Altronate dehydratase (altronate hydrolase, EC 4.2.1.7, 495aa) converts D-altronate to 2-dehydro-3deoxy-D-gluconate; altronate oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.58, tagaturonate dehydrogenase, 483aa) converts D-altronate to D-tagaturonate.

Term usually applied to neurons that release noradrenaline, dopamine or serotonin.\n\nCf. adrenergic, cholinergic.\n\namino acid permease A widely distributed group of large integral membrane proteins, required for the entry of amino acids into cells. In Arabidopsis, for example, amino acid permease one (amino acid transporter AAP1, neutral amino acid transporter II, 485aa) is an amino acid-proton symporter with a broad specificity for histidine, glutamate and neutral amino acids.\n\namino acid receptors Ligand-gated ion channels with specific receptors for amino acid neurotransmitters. An extended protein superfamily that also includes subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.\n\namino acid transmitters Amino acids released as neurotransmitter substances from nerve terminals and acting on postsynaptic receptors e.g. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine that are fast inhibitory transmitters in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamate and aspartate mediate fast excitatory transmission.

An intermediate step is the formation of an activated amino acid complex with AMP; the AMP is released following attachment to the tRNA. One example among many is glycyl-tRNA synthetase (glycine-tRNA ligase, EC 6.1.1.14, 739aa).\n\naminoacylase Enzymes involved in hydrolysis of most N-acylated or N-acetylated amino acids.

Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1, aspartate aminotransferase), which catalyses the transfer from glutamate to oxaloacetic acid (producing aspartic acid and a-ketoglutarate), exists in both mitochondrial (430aa) and cytosolic (413aa) forms. Branched chain aminotransferases (EC 2.6.1.42, BCAT1, 393aa; BCAT2, 392aa) act on amino acids with non-linear aliphatic sidechains (leucine, isoleucine and valine). Defects in branched-chain amino acid transamination can lead to hypervalinaemia and hyperleucine-isoleucinaemia.\n\namitosis An unusual form of nuclear division, in which the nucleus simply constricts, rather like a cell, without chromosome condensation or spindle formation. Partitioning of daughter chromosomes is haphazard. Observed in some Protozoa. amniocentesis Sampling of the fluid in the amniotic sac. In humans this is carried out, between the 12th and 16th week of pregnancy, by inserting a needle through the abdominal wall into the uterus. By karyotyping the cells and determining the proteins present, it is possible to determine the sex of the foetus and whether it is suffering from certain congenital diseases such as Down's syndrome or spina bifida.\n\namniocyte Cell type found floating freely in the amnion sac; following amniocentesis, amniocytes can be subcultured and used for prenatal genetic diagnosis.\n\namnion The inner layer of the fluid-filled sac in which the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates develop.

Only acts on membranes containing sterols (preferentially ergosterol, hence selectivity for fungi). See also filipin.\n\namphoterin In rat, a heparin-binding protein (high mobility group protein 1, 215aa) that enhances nerve growth cone migration and neurite outgrowth in the developing brain. It is also a DNA binding protein that binds preferentially single-stranded DNA and is involved in V(D)J recombination by acting as a cofactor of the RAG complex. In humans high mobility group protein 1 (215aa) is similar and is also involved in V(D)J recombination. In humans, amphoterin-induced protein 1 (AMIGO-1, alivin-2, 493aa) promotes growth and fasciculation of neurites from cultured hippocampal neurons.

Amyloid of immune origin (AIO) can be derived from immunoglobulin light chain produced by a single clone of plasma cells or the N-terminal part of lambda or kappa L-chain). Amyloid of unknown origin (AUO) is derived from serum amyloid A (SAA), one of the acute phase proteins that increases many-fold in inflammation. The polypeptides are organized as a beta pleated sheet making the material rather inert and insoluble. Minor protein components are also found. Should be distinguished from \u03b2-amyloid deposited in the brain and that is derived from amyloid precursor protein.\n\namyloid precursor protein A single-pass membrane protein (amyloidogenic glycoprotein, APP, 770aa) from which beta amyloid peptides (42\u00c043aa), the principal component of amyloid fibrils, are derived (as well as a number of other cleavage products). There are multiple alternativelyspliced isoforms, some of which may be associated with predisposition to formation of senile plaques, characterisitic of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The specific role of amyloid protein is unclear but it is thought that amyloid deposits may cause neurons to degenerate. Amyloid deposits also occur in brains of older Down's Syndrome patients. APP itself functions as a cell surface receptor and performs physiological functions on the surface of neurons relevant to neurite growth, neuronal adhesion and axonogenesis.\n\namyloidogenic glycoprotein See amyloid precursor protein.\n\namyloidosis Deposition of amyloid.

Activated APC ubiquitinates securin, targeting it for degradation by the 26S proteasome and thereby relieving the inhibition of separin. The largest subunit, Apc1, serves as a scaffold that associates independently with two separable subcomplexes, one that contains Apc2 (cullin), Apc11 (RING), and Doc1/Apc10, and another that contains the three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR motif)-containing subunits (Cdc27, Cdc16, and Cdc23). In S-phase the APC is inactivated by binding of cyclin A.\n\nanaphylatoxin Originally used of an antigen that reacted with an IgE antibody thus precipitating reactions of anaphylaxis.

Anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a are secondary amines that bind and irreversibly activate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; anatoxin-a(s) is the only natural organophosphate known and inactivates acetylcholine esterase in a similar fashion to synthetic organophosphate pesticides such as parathion and malathion. All cause muscle exhaustion by overstimulation and death through respiratory failure. Structure: http://www-cyanosite.bio.purdue.edu/cyanotox/toxins/anatoxin.html ANCA Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies seen in patients with a variety of inflammatory disorders including IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), Wegeners granulomatosis and hepatobiliary disorders. Two forms are recognized, peripheral ANCA (p-ANCA) where the antigen seems to reside at the periphery of the nucleus and cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) where the antigen is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the neutrophil.\n\nanchorage Attachment, not necessarily adhesive in character; the term ought to be more widely used since it avoids assumptions about mechanism.\n\nanchorage dependence The necessity for attachment (and spreading) in order that a cell will grow and divide in culture. Loss of anchorage dependence seems to be associated with greater independence from external growth control and is probably one of the best correlates of tumorigenic events in vivo. Anchorage independence is usually detected by cloning cells in soft agarose; only anchorage-independent cells will grow and divide (as they will in suspension).\n\nanchored PCR Variety of polymerase chain reaction in which only enough information is known to make a single primer. A known sequence is therefore added to the end of the DNA, perhaps by enzymic addition of a polynucleotide stretch or by ligation of a known piece of DNA. The PCR can then be performed with the gene-specific primer and the anchor primer.\n\nancovenin An inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme isolated from the culture broth of a Streptomyces species; a 16aa lantibiotic containing unusual amino acids such as threo-beta-methyllanthionine, meso-lanthionine, and dehydroalanine.

Some, however, block voltage-regulated potassium channels (e.g. Potassium channel toxin ShK 35aa from Stoichactis helianthus).\n\nanergy Adj anergic. Generally, a lack of energy. In Immunology, failure of lymphocytes that have been primed to respond to second exposure to the antigen. Consequence is a depression or lack of normal immunological function.\n\naneugenic Agents that induce changes in chromosome numbers, aneuploidy or polyploidy, rather than mutation. A range of chemicals and treatments (e.g. X irradiation) have been shown to be aneugenic although there are no universally accepted standard test methods as yet.\n\naneuploid Having a chromosome complement that is not an exact multiple of the haploid number. Chromosomes may be present in multiple copies (e.g. trisomy) or one of a homologous pair may be missing in a diploid cell.\n\nANF See atrial natriuretic peptide.\n\nthere is severe mental retardation and ataxic movement associated with absence of maternal 15q11q13, and the absence of the \u03b23 subunit of GABA receptor-A or in some cases with defects in genomic imprinting. Absence of the paternally-derived region leads to clinically disting Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\nangio-associated migratory cell protein A protein (AAMP, 434aa) that has a role in angiogenesis and cell migration. May act through the rhoA pathway.\n\nangioedema A condition (formerly angioneurotic edema) in which large edomatous welts develop in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Can be caused in some cases by mutation in genes encoding complement C1 inhibitor or coagulation factor XII.\n\nangiogenesis The process of vascularization of a tissue involving the development of new capillary blood vessels.\n\nangiogenin Polypeptide (ribonuclease 5, EC 3.1.27.-, 147aa) that induces the proliferation of endothelial cells; one of the components of tumour angiogenesis factor. It has ribonucleolytic activity, although the biological relevance of this is unclear. It has also been suggested that angiogenin binds to an actin-like molecule present on the surface of endothelial cells. angiomotin A protein (1094aa) that is important for maintainence of tight junctions (see nadrin), stimulates motility in endothelial cells and is found in tissues where angiogenesis is occurring. May be antagonised by angiostatin.\n\nangiomyolipoma Rare, slow-growing benign lesions of kidney, composed of varying amounts of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and fat. A few cases are associated with tuberous sclerosis.\n\nangioneurotic oedema See angioedema.\n\nangiopathy Any disease of blood vessels.\n\nMicroangiopathy affects small blood vessels and is, for example, a complication of diabetes, particularly in the vasculature of the retina. Macroangiopathy affects large blood vessels leading to coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms and muscle cramps (HANAC) is caused by missense mutations in the collagen 4A1 gene.\n\nangiopoietin Angiopoietin-1 (498aa) is the ligand for Tie2; angiopoietin-2 (496aa) is a natural antagonist. Angiopoietin-1, but not Ang-2, is chemotactic for endothelial cells: neither have effects on proliferation. Angiopoietin-3 (angiopoietin-related protein 1, 491aa) is one of a number of angiopoietin-related proteins, that have different tissue distributions.\n\nangiopoietins Growth factors of the VEGF family that have their effect on blood vessels. Angiopoietin-1 (498aa) is the ligand for the endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2; angiopoietin-2 (496aa) is a natural antagonist. Angiopoietin-3 (angiopoietin-related protein 1, 491aa) is secreted by various tissues. Angiopoietin-related protein-4 (406aa) is induced in endothelial cells by hypoxia and may have a protective function. It inhibits proliferation, migration, and tubule formation by endothelial cells and reduces vascular leakage and is involved in regulating glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Various angiopoietin-like proteins are also known with miscellaneous tissue-specific functions. Not all are mitogenic for endothelial cells \u00c0 for example angiopoietin-like seven (angiopoietin-like factor thee, cornea-derived transcript six protein, 346aa) reduces tumour growth and aberrant blood vessel formation in a mouse xenograft model and is a target gene of the WNT/catenin signalling pathway. angiosperms The largest and most diverse group of land plants, differing from the gymnosperms in having flowers that produce seed. A defining characteristic of angiosperms is that the seed are enclosed within an ovule, in contrast to the naked-seeded gymnosperms.\n\nangiostatin Potent angiogenesis inhibitor, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen containing the first three or four kringle domains (K1-4). Mode of action unclear but it reportedly binds to angiomotin. angiotensin A peptide hormone derived from angiotensinogen (485aa) that is released from the liver and cleaved in the circulation by renin to form the biologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin-1. This is in turn cleaved to form active angiotensin-2 (angiotensin 1-8) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin-2 causes contraction of vascular smooth muscle, and thus raises blood pressure, and stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal glands. Angiotensin-3 stimulates aldosterone release. Receptors for angiotensin are G-protein coupled: Type 1 (359aa) mediates the cardiovascular effects which may be counteracted by signalling through Type 2 (363aa). Angiotensin is finally broken down by angiotensinases such as prolylcarboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.16.2, 496aa) .\n\nEnzymes that will convert angiotensin-1 into the active angiotensin-2: ACE1 (EC 3.4.15.1, 1306aa) is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that removes the terminal His-Leu from angiotensin-1. ACE2 (EC 3.4.17.23, 805aa) will generate a nonapeptide (angiotensin 1\u00c09) of unknown function and a heptapeptide (angiotensin 1-7, angiotensin-3) that has vasodilatory actions and is a ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor mas1. Genetic variations in ACE may be a cause of susceptibility to ischemic stroke and predisposition to microvascular complications of diabetes; mutations can cause renal tubular dysgenesis.\n\nangiotensin II receptor antagonists Group of drugs that work by blocking binding of angiotensin II to its receptor and thus have effects similar to those of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; used to treat hypertension. Examples are candesartan, irbesartan, losartan and valsartan.\n\nACE inhibitors Drugs that inhibit the enzymatic conversion of inactive angiotensin-1 to the active form (angiotensin-2); used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril and Enalapril are common examples.\n\nangiotensinase See angiotensin.\n\nangiotensinogen See angiotensin.\n\nAngstrom unit Small unit of measurement (10 210 m) named after Swedish physicist and astronomer.

The opposite pole is the vegetal pole, with the animal-vegetal axis between the poles passing through the nucleus. During meiosis of the oocyte the polar bodies are expelled at the animal pole. In many eggs there is also a graded distribution of substances along this axis, with pigment granules often concentrated in the animal half and yolk, where present, largely in the vegetal half.\n\nanimalised cells Cells of the 8\u00c016 cell early blastula of sea urchins that have been shifted from vegetal to animal in their characteristics by manipulating the environmental conditions. See animal pole and vegetal pole.\n\nanion exchanger Family of integral membrane proteins that perform the exchange of chloride and bicarbonate across the plasma membrane. Best known is band III of the red blood cell.\n\nanionic detergents Detergents in which the hydrophilic funtion is fulfilled by an anionic grouping. Fatty acids are the best known natural products in this class, but it is doubtful if they have a specific detergent function in any biological system. The important synthetic species are aliphatic sulphate esters, e.g. sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS or SLS).\n\naniridia Rare congenital absence or partial absence of the iris and other tissues in the eye; caused either by an autosomal dominant mutation in PAX6 (oculorhombin), an identifiable chromosome deletion of the short arm of chromosome 11, including band p13, or in sporadic cases by mutations in WT (Wilms tumour gene) and AN2 (aniridia 2 gene) or only in AN2.\n\nanisogamy Mode of sexual reproduction in which the two gametes are of different sizes.\n\nanisotropic Not the same in all directions.\n\nANK repeat Motif found in diverse proteins including ankyrin (hence the name), the Notch product, transcriptional regulators, cell cycle regulatory proteins and a toxin produced by the black widow spider.

Synthesized as a large precursor with a short signal sequence followed by the prepro hormone that forms homodimers. Prior to secretion, the mature hormone undergoes glycosylation and dimerization. High levels of AMH are produced by Sertoli cells during fetal and postnatal testicular development and suppress the development of M\u00fcllerian ducts that differentiate into the uterus and fallopian tubes in females.\n\nIn the human female, AMH is produced by ovarian granulosa cells from 36 week of gestation to the menopause. The receptors are serine/threonine kinases.\n\nanti-muscarinic drugs A subgroup of anticholinergic drugs that block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

Cf. periclinal.\n\nanticoagulant Substance that inhibits the clotting of blood. The most commonly used are EDTA and citrate (both of which work by chelating calcium) and heparin (that interferes with thrombin, probably by potentiating antithrombins).

They are used for motion sickness and for the side-effects of chemotherapy and some gastrointestinal disorders. Examples include hyoscine, antihistamines, phenothiazines, metoclopramide, and ondantseron.\n\nantigen A substance that induces an immune response. Normally antigens have molecular weights greater than about 1 kDa. The antigenic determinant group is termed an epitope and the association of this with a carrier molecule (that may be part of the same molecule) makes it active as an antigen. Thus dinitrophenol-modified human serum albumin is antigenic to humans, dinitrophenol being the hapten. Usually antigens are foreign to the animal in which they produce immune reactions.\n\nantigen presentation See antigen presenting cell.\n\nantigen presenting cell A cell that carries on its surface antigen bound to MHC Class I or Class II molecules, and presents the antigen in this 'context' to T-cells.

Usually seen in microorganisms where the change may allow escape from immune recognition. Antigenic drift is a more gradual change. See antigenic variation.\n\nantigen-antibody complex The product of the reaction of antigen and immunoglobulin, an immune complex.

Antizyme (228aa) is a polyamine-inducible protein involved in feedback regulation of cellular polyamine levels. The N terminus of antizyme is not required for the interaction with ODC but is necessary to induce its degradation. Antizyme can be induced by IL-1 and it is inhibited by antizyme inhibitor 1 (448aa). The elaborate regulation of ODC activity in mammals still lacks a defined developmental role but an antizyme-like gene in Drosophila, gutfeeling (guf), is required for proper development of the embryonic peripheral nervous system.\n\nantolefinin The human homologue of lin-37, a component (246aa) of the DREAM complex.\n\nAntp See antennapedia.\n\nantral Relating to an antrum.\n\nantral mucosa Mucosa (pyloric mucosa) found in the gastric antrum which has coiled and branching antral glands that are lined by mucus cells interspersed with endocrine cells (chiefly G and D types), and a few parietal (oxyntic) cells.\n\nantrum (1) A cavity or chamber, especially in bone.\n\n(2) The lower third of the stomach (pyloric antrum) that lies between the body of the stomach and the pyloric canal (3) In the ovary, the fluid-filled space within the follicle.\n\nanucleate Having no nucleus.\n\nanucleolate Literally, having no nucleoli.

APETALA1 (AP1, agamous-like MADS-box protein AGL7, 256aa) promotes early floral meristem identity in synergy with LEAFY and is necessary for petal and sepal development. APETALA2 (AP2, 432aa) is a transcriptional activator involved in sepal and petal development, represses AGAMOUS and is important in seed development. APETALA3 (AP3, 232aa) forms a heterodimer with PISTILLATA (PI) that autoregulates AP1, AP3 and PI genes. See ABC model of flower development.\n\nAPH-1 A component (anterior pharynx defective, 265aa), along with nicastrin and PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer) of the presenilin-dependent gammasecretase complex.

The shoot apical meristem (SAM) can produce vegetative leaf buds or reproductive floral buds. The root apical meristem is covered by the root cap.\n\napical plasma membrane The cell membrane on the apical (inner or upper) surface of transporting epithelial cells. This region of the cell membrane is separated, in vertebrates, from the baso-lateral membrane by a ring of tight junctions that prevents free mixing of membrane proteins from these two domains.\n\nApicomplexa A large group of obligate parasitic protozoa (within the Alveolata) that are characterized by an apical complex of microtubules within the cell in the sporozoite and merozoite stages but lack flagella.

Instead (and perhaps sensibly) reference is made to non-motile male gametes as for example in red seaweed. Paper: http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690222/pdf/DKG4A 3GCGVWKFM4D_266_1879.pdf aplanospore A nonmotile spore, e.g those produced by fungi in the Zygomycotina and by certain algae (Chlorophyta and Chrysophyta).\n\naplasia Defective development of an organ or tissue so that it is totally or partially absent from the body.\n\naplastic anaemia Anaemia due to loss of most or all of the haematopoietic bone marrow.

By triggering Cto-U hypermutation in exogenous DNA cause its degradation. For example, can induce mutations in the first HIV DNA expressed as complementary DNA (cDNA) thereby destroying the coding and replicative capacity of the virus. However, HIV viral infectivity factor (Vif) interacts with APOBEC3G and triggers ubiquitination and degradation. APOBEC1 (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme 1, 236aa) is responsible for the postranscriptional editing of a CAA codon for Gln to a UAA codon for stop in the APOB mRNA.\n\napocarotenoids Compounds derived from carotenoids by oxidative cleavage (by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases).

Apo(a) is proteolytically cleaved to form mini-Lp(a) and Apo (a) apolipoprotein H A multifunctional apolipoprotein (beta-2 glycoprotein 1, 345aa) that will bind negatively charged substances (e.g. heparin) and may inhibit the intrinsic blood coagulation cascade by binding to phospholipids on the surface of damaged cells. The apoH-phospholipid complex appears to the the autoantigen in some cases of systemic lupus erythematosus and in antiphospholipid syndrome. apollo A 5 0 \u00c03 0 exonuclease (DNA cross-link repair protein 1B, 532aa) important for telomere maintenance and protection during S-phase. Binds to telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) and is one of the accessory proteins in the shelterin complex. Defects in apollo may be a cause of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, a multisystem disorder affecting males.\n\napomixis In plants, reproduction without gamete fusion, i.e. asexually, the equivalent of parthenogenesis in animals. Seeds may form without fertilization (agamospermy) and in some fungi meiosis and gamete formation do not occur even though an ascus containing identical diploid spores is formed. Vegetative propagation from cuttings is not classed as apomixis. In angiosperms two forms are distinguished, gametophytic apomixis in which the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg cell (parthenogenetically) and sporophytic apomixis (adventitious embryony) where the embryo is formed from nucellus (nucellar embryony) or integumental tissue. See apogamy.\n\napomorphic A term used in cladistics for derived or advanced characteristics that arose relatively late in members of a group and therefore differ among them. These are useful in assessing genealogical links among taxa; the more recent the common ancestor, the more apomorphic traits are shared. Apomorphic characters for the primates, like humans, include a large brain size and binocular vision. Plesiomorphic characteristics are ancient homologies (e.g. pentadactyl limbs), symplesiomorphic characteristics are recently derived. Synaptomorphic characters are shared between taxa.\n\napomorphine An alkaloid of the morphine series that is an an agonist at dopamine D1 and D2 receptors but does not bind the opioid receptors.\n\napopain Protease (caspase 3, Yama protein, EC 3.4.22.56) responsible for the cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase and necessary for apoptosis.

Will cleave and activate sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), caspases 6, 7 and 9, and huntingtin.\n\napoplast One of the two compartments that make up a plant. The apoplast is external to the plasma membrane and includes cell walls, xylem vessels etc., through which water and solutes pass freely. The other compartment, the symplast, comprises the total cytoplasmic compartment (the protoplasts of cells in a plant are all connected through plasmodesmata and can be considered as a connected whole).\n\napoprotein The protein portion of a complex between a polypeptide and a second moiety of nonpolypeptide nature. For example, ferritin lacking its ferric hydroxide core may be referred to as apoferritin.\n\napoptin A small proline-rich protein (121aa) derived from the chicken anaemia virus, induces apoptotic cell death selectively in cancer cells. Human apoptin-associating protein one (RING1 and YY1-binding protein, death effector domain-associated factor, 228aa) interacts with apoptin, DEDD, FADD, caspases eight and ten, the transcriptional repressor protein YY1 and GAPB1 (a transcription factor capable of interacting with purine rich repeats).\n\napoptosis The most common form of physiological (as opposed to pathological) cell death. Apoptosis is an active process requiring metabolic activity by the dying cell; often characterized by shrinkage of the cell, cleavage of the DNA into fragments that give a so-called 'laddering pattern' on gels and by condensation and margination of chromatin. Often called programmed cell death, though this is not strictly accurate. Cells that die by apoptosis do not usually elicit the inflammatory responses that are associated with necrosis, though the reasons are not clear. See also: apoptosis inducing factor, apoptosome, ced mutant, bcl-2.\n\napoptosis inducing factor AIF A group of proteins involved in the induction of apoptosis. AIF1 (programmed cell death protein 8, 613aa) is a mitochondrial oxidoreductase that is translocated to the nucleus when apoptosis is induced; interacts with DNA by virtue of positive charges clustered on the AIF surface (i.e. independently of sequence) and with XIAP. AIF2 (373aa) is similar. AIF-like protein (AIF3, 605aa) does not translocate to the nucleus and induces apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway.\n\napoptosome Complex of approximately 700 kDa (occasionally 1.4 MDa) assembled by rapid oligomerization of mitochondrial cytochrome c bound to Apaf-1 followed by a slower process of procaspase-9 recruitment and cleavage to form the p35/34 forms. XIAP binds to the caspase nine and inhibits further proteolytic activity.\n\napothecia The sexual fruiting bodies produced by various phyla of ascomycete fungi (discomycetes; Leotiomycetes and Pezizomycetes) of which Sclerotinia sclerotiurum is an example.\n\nApp(NH)p Non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP.\n\nappetite-regulating hormone Peptide (growth hormone secretagogue, growth hormone-releasing peptide, motilin-related peptide, 117aa) that is cleaved to produce ghrelin-27 (27aa), ghrelin-28 (ghrelin) and obestatin (23aa). Ghrelin is the ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptor type one (GHSR) and induces the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. Has an appetite-stimulating effect. Obestatin may be the ligand for GPR39 and may have the opposite (appetite-reducing) effect.\n\napplagin See disintegrin.\n\napple domain A consensus sequence (B90aa) with six cysteines, that forms a characteristic, vaguely apple-shaped, pattern via disulphide bridges.

The ASD1 domain mediates F-actin binding.\n\n(2) In Arabidopsis, Apx2 (cytosolic L-ascorbate peroxidase 2, EC 1.11.1.11, 251aa) has a key role in hydrogen peroxide removal.\n\n(3) In C. elegans, Apx1 (anterior pharynx in excess protein 1, 515aa) is a single-pass membrane protein that contributes to the establishment of the dorsalventral axis in the early embryo.\n\napyrase A multi-pass membrane protein (EC 3.6.1.5, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, B520aa) that catalyses breakdown of ATP to AMP. There are tissue-specific isoforms and it may regulate purinergic neurotransmission and platelet aggregation (by hydrolysing ADP). Mosquitos produce an apyrase in their salivary glands (562aa) that facilitates taking a blood meal by preventing platelet aggregation and blood clotting. The enzyme is also found in plants (415aa in Solanum tuberosum). Apyrase from Pisum sativum (nucleoside-triphosphatase, NTPase, EC 3.6.1.15, 455aa) may be involved in RNA export from nuclei.\n\naquaglyceroporin A subclass of aquaporins that also promotes glycerol permeability, e.g. aquaporin-10 (aquaglyceroporin-10, small intestine aquaporin, 301aa). In E. coli, aquaglyceroporin (glycerol uptake facilitator protein, 281aa) is a glycerol transporter that produces only limited permeability to water and small uncharged compounds such as polyols.\n\naquaporins Integral membrane proteins, members of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family, with two tandem repeats each containing three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop that greatly increases water permeability. They form homotetramers in the membrane. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1, CHIP28, 269aa) is found in various mammalian tissues but especially in kidney and erythrocytes. Aquaporin-2 is found in the renal collecting tubules. Many human aquaporins are known and some, for example aquaporin-9 (small solute channel 1, 295aa), form channels with broad specificity; the different aquaporins serve various physiological functions. Plant MIPs have been divided into five subfamilies; the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), the tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), the nodulin-26 like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), the small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and the GlpF-like intrinsic protein (GIPs). Prokaryotic examples are known, for example E. coli GLP, a glycerol-transporting channel protein which is paralogous to AQP3, AQP7 and AQP9.

Inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP (K i 5 38 nM). Details: http://hwmaint.jbc. org/cgi/content/abstract/278/46/45937 ara operon Operon involved in arabinose metabolism, especially the araBAD operon of E. coli. AraA encodes arabinose isomerase, which converts arabinose to ribulose; AraB encodes ribulokinase, which phosphorylates ribulose; AraD encodes ribulose-5phosphate epimerase, which converts ribulose-5phosphate to xylulose-5-phosphate which is then metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway. Regulation of the operon is by the AraC gene product that binds to the operator, AraI, site and another AroO site, forming a loop in the DNA which represses transcription of the operon. In the presence of arabinose, AraC adopts an altered conformation which when bound at the AraI site helps to activate expression of the operon.\n\nara6 (1) A small GTPase (202aa) of the rab family, an endosomal marker in Arabidopsis. Ara7 is similar.\n\n(2) A chloroplast enzyme (ARA6, 349aa) involved in thiazole biosynthesis and may also have a role in DNA damage tolerance.\n\narabidiol A plant secondary metabolite (a triterpene) involved in plant defense, produced by the action of PEN1 on 2,3-oxidosqualene.\n\nArabidopsis thaliana Mouse-ear cress (Thale cress, wall cress), one of the Brassicaceae.

Website: www.Arabidopsis.org arabinofuranosidases Glycosidases (\u03b1-arabinofuranosidases) that will break down polymers such as arabinan, arabinoxylan, and other polysaccharides, that are major components of plant cell wall hemicelluloses. Many microorganisms use these enzymes to generate soluble carbohydrates that can be used as carbon or energy sources.\n\narabinogalactans Plant cell-wall polysaccharides containing predominantly arabinose and galactose. Two main types are recognized: arabinogalactan 1, found in the pectin portion of angiosperms and containing \u03b1-1,4 linked galactan and \u03b1-arabinose sidechains; arabinogalactan II, a highly branched polymer containing \u03b2-1,3 and \u03b2-1,6 linked galactose and peripheral \u03b1-arabinose residues. Arabinogalactan II is found in large amounts on some gymnosperms, especially larches, and is related to AGP. arachidonic acid An essential dietary component for mammals. The free acid (5,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid) is the precursor for biosynthesis of the signalling molecules prostaglandins, thromboxanes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid derivatives including leukotrienes and is thus of great biological significance. Within cells the acid is found in the esterified form as a major acyl component of membrane phospholipids (especially phosphatidyl inositol) and its release from phospholipids is thought to be the limiting step in the formation of its active metabolites.\n\narachnoid layer See meninges.\n\narboviruses Diverse group of single-stranded RNA viruses that have an envelope surrounding the capsid. Arthropod borne, hence the name, and multiply in both invertebrate and vertebrate host, causing e.g. yellow fever and encephalitis.

Arp2/3 caps the pointed end of actin filaments and nucleates actin polymerization with low efficiency. The GTPase Cdc42 acts in concert with WASP family proteins to activate the Arp2/3 complex. See also ActA, IcsA.\n\narrestins Family of inhibitory proteins that bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors, thereby blocking their interaction with G-proteins and effectively terminating the signalling. Arrestin (S antigen, 405aa) from retinal rods, competes with transducin for light-activated rhodopsin, thus inhibiting the response to light (adaptation). Arrestin-C (cone arrestin, 388aa) is similar. Immune responses to arrestin lead to autoimmune uveitis. Beta-arrestins (e.g. \u03b2-arrestin-1, 418aa; \u03b2-arrestin-2, 409aa) regulate agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling by binding to the phosphorylated receptor and blocking its interaction with the relevant G-protein. See Ark1 #2.\n\nArrhenius plot A plot of the logarithm of reaction rate against the reciprocal of absolute temperature. For a single stage reaction this gives a straight line from which the activation energy and the frequency factor can be determined. Often applied to data from complex biological systems when the form observed is frequently a series of linear portions with sudden changes of slope. Great caution must be observed in interpreting such slopes in terms of activation energies for single processes.\n\narrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy ARVD/ARVC A range of disorders in which there is arrhythmia of the right ventricle of the heart and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue.
