{"title": "Identification of a Small RNA Containing the Trypanosome Spliced Leader: A Donor of Shared 5' Sequences of Trypanosomatid mRNAs?", "body": "Many mRNAs of Trypanosoma brucei contain the same 5'terminal 35 nucleotide leader sequence (Parsons et al., 1984a; DeLange et al., 1984a) . This untranslated leader was first identified (Boothroyd and Cross, 1982; Van der Ploeg et al., 1982) as a sequence shared among mRNAs encoding the antigenically distinct variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs), which are sequentially-expressed during antigenic variation in the mammalian host (for review see Vickerman, 1978; Parsons et al., 1984b) . The leader sequence is not encoded by the DNA immediately flanking VSG structural genes and has therefore been termed the spliced leader (SL), to indicate that it is transcribed from another region of the genome .\n\nIn the genome of Trypanosoma brucei, sequences encoding the SL are reiterated approximately 200 times and, for the most part, are organized in a large tandem array(s) of directly repeated 1.4 kb units, which each containing a single SL exon DeLange et al., 1983) . A few of these units, however, are orphons (Childs et al., 1981) -that is, they are dispersed from the tandem array Parsons et al., 1984c) . Given the occurrence of the SL on all VSG transcripts and the observation that sequences flanking the 5' side of the SL exon in the 1.4 kb repeat unit resemble eucaryotic polymerase II promoters, it has been proposed that the tandem array defines the 5' boundary of a unique VSG gene expression locus and serves as a multiple promoter, allowing high levels of VSG gene transcription (DeLange et al., 1983) . The presence of the SL on VSG transcripts, however, is but one example of its larger and more fundamental role in trypanosomatid gene expression. First, sequences homologous to the T. brucei SL are highly reiterated not only in the genomes of other species of Trypanosoma, for example the intracellular New World parasite T. cruzi, but also in other genera of the family Trypanosomatidae, notably the evolutionarily primitive insect parasite, Leptomonas collosoma DeLange et al., 198413) . Neither T. cruzi nor L. collosoma undergo antigenic variation, yet Northern analysis of RNA from these organisms reveals that their SL-like sequences are transcribed and are present on RNAs of diverse size (R. G. N. and M. S., unpublished data). In addition, the SL is heavily transcribed in T. brucei procyclic culture form cells (analogous to the insect midgut stage of the trypanosome life cycle) where VSG transcripts and VSGs are undetectable (De-Lange et al., 1983; Parsons et al., 1984c) . Second, we have isolated and characterized many different T. brucei non-VSG cDNA clones that contain the SL (Parsons et al., 1984a) . Individual clones identify discrete SL-containing transcripts; some of these are abundant or rare, constitutive or regulated, and are transcribed from single or multicopy genes. As is the case with VSG genes, the SL sequence is not encoded contiguously with, or detectably linked to, these structural genes. Based on the frequency of SL cDNA clones in bloodstream and procyclic culture form libraries, it seems likely that many, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs share this 35 nucleotide leader sequence. Thus the SL sequence is unique neither to African trypanosomes nor to VSG gene expression.\n\nThe hypothesis that explains the presence of the SL on VSG mRNA by intramolecular splicing of a very large primary transcript seems untenable, simply because more SL-utilizing genes have already been identified than there are possible SL-encoding tandem arrays and orphons. We favor the hypothesis that the SL is added to these numerous transcripts by an intermolecular process, i.e., in trans. The two simplest mechanisms for such a process are primed transcription and post-transcriptional splicing/ligation In the first case, an SL transcript initiated in the SL reiteration unit would serve as a primer for the initiation of transcription from SL-utilizing genes. The second mechanism suggests that a similar SL transcript might serve as a substrate for intermolecular ligation to appropriate structural gene transcripts. Both models predict that a discrete SL-containing RNA is transcribed not only from the SL reiteration units of T. brucei, but from those of other trypanosomatid species as well.\n\nIn this report we demonstrate the presence of small SL RNAs that are transcribed from the SL reiteration units of T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. collosoma. These RNAs contain an SL sequence at their 5' ends and extend 3' an additional 100, 70, and 60 nucleotides, respectively. With :the exception of the SL itself, the sequences of these small RNAs are not well conserved. However, a consensus mRNA donor splice site is present in each small RNA immediately 3' to the SL sequence. Similarly, a consensus mRNA acceptor splice site is present in SL-utilizing genes at a position corresponding to the location of the 3' end of the SL in the mature SL mRNA. These and other observations suggest that the small SL RNAs serve as donors of the SL sequence found on trypanosomatid mRNAs.\n\nThe SL Reiteration Unit Encodes a Small SL RNA Total RNA, extracted from T. brucei, L. collosoma, and Crithidia fasciculata and LiC12 fractionated RNA from T. cruzi, were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gels. Ethidium bromide staining ( Figure 1A ) revealed a distinct pattern of small RNA species ranging in size from 100 to 250 nucleotides. Each of these trypanosomatid organisms has a similar profile of abundant small RNAs although individual RNA sizes vary. These small RNA profiles are comparable to those of C. fasciculata (Gray, 1981) Leishmania tarantolae (Simpson and Simpson, 1978) and T. brucei (Cordingly and Turner, 1980) described previously. Two of these RNAs are analogous to the 5S (MacKay et al., 1980) and 5.8s (Schnare and Gray, 1982) ribosomal RNAs found in other eucaryotes.\n\nThe RNAs shown in Figure 1A were electroblotted to a Zeta-probe membrane and hybridized with a =P-labeled synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to 22 of the 35 nucleotide SL (22-mer/SL probe, see Figure 5 ). As shown in Figure lB , the probe hybridizes strongly with RNA species of approximately 133, 108, and 95 nucleotides in RNA from T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. collosoma, respectively. In T. brucei, higher molecular weight small RNAs often hybridize with the SL probe (lanes 2 and 3, Figure 1 B); these have not been further characterized. The RNA from T. brucei bloodstream forms (Figure 1 B, lane 2) and from procyclic culture forms (lane 3) shows identical patterns of hybridization. C. fasciculata genomic DNA does not contain sequences with significant homology to the 22-mer however, see DeLange et al., 1984b) and, as expected, RNA from this trypanosomatid does not hybridize with the probe (lane 5).\n\nThe hybridization observed in the high molecular weight region of the Northern blot ( Figure 16 , lanes 2 and 3) is due to T. brucei mRNA transcripts that contain the SL, LiCI, precipitation of total RNA separates small RNA species, including those containing the SL, from the rest of the larger RNA (data not shown). Therefore, there is no hybridization of the 22-mer to mRNA in T. cruzi samples prepared by LiC12 fractionation (Figure IB, lane 6). In this experiment hybridization of the 22-mer prode to L. collosoma mRNA was not detected; the reasons for this are unclear, however the 22-mer does hybridize to larger molecular weight RNA under less stringent hybridization conditions.\n\nAn SL-like sequence is shared by most trypanosomatids and in each organism the SL is a small part of a larger reiteration unit . In T. cruzi and L. were hybridized with \"P-labeled probes prepared by Klenow synthesis of Ml3 (sense strand) SL retieration unit clcnes from T. brucei. mpTb-I .4M(l); T. cruzi, mpTc-0.65(l); and L. wtlosoma, mpLc-O.GT(l) as described in Experimental Procedures. Lanes l-6 as in (A) and (B), hybridized with T. brucei probe. Lanes 7 and 6 T. brucei and L. colloscma RNA, respectively. hybridized with L. collosoma probe. Lanes 9 and 10, T. brucei and T. cruzi, respectively, hybridized to T. cruzi probe. collosoma, the unit sizes are approximately 0.6 kb as compared to 1.4 kb in T. brucei. The SL reiteration units are directly and tandemly repeated in the genomes of each of these trypanosomatids and homology among units is limited to the SL sequence itself. The remainder of the 600-1400 bp is essentially nonhomologous and speciesspecific unpublished data; DeLange et al., 1984) .\n\nIn order to determine whether these small SL RNAs are transcribed from the reiteration unit, the RNA blot shown in Figure IB was hybridized with probes prepared from the cloned reiteration units of each organism under con-ditions in which the SL alone does not hybridize ( Figure  1C ). The T. brucei SL reiteration unit hybridized with the 133 bp SL RNA but did not hybridize with the small SL RNAs from heterologous species Similarly, the T. cruzi and L. collosoma reiteration unit probes hybridized only with the small SL RNA from the homologous organism ( Figure 1C ). These experiments demonstrate that the SL and additional sequences specific to each respective reiteration unit are transcribed to yield a discrete class of small SL RNA molecules in each of these organisms,\n\nThe SL Is Located at the 5' Termini of Small SL RNAs\n\nIn order to determine the location of the SL within the small SL-RNA the synthetic 22 nucleotide oligomer was hybridized to size-selected RNA fractions enriched for the small SL RNA and primer-extended with reverse transcriptase. The 22-mer is complementary to nucleotides 10 to 31 of both the T. brucei and the T. cruzi 35 nucleotide SL sequences (see Figure 5 ). If the SL is located at the 5' end of the small SL RNAs of these organisms, one would expect the primer to be extended by 9 nucleotides in both cases. Small SL RNA-containing fractions were prepared by elution from polyacrylamide-urea gels and annealed with unlabeled 22-mer. The primer was extended with reverse transcriptase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, one of which was 32P-labeled deoxycytidine triphosphate. Analysis of the reaction products is shown in Figure 2 . The major extension product obtained from the enriched small SL RNA fractions of T. brucei and T. cruzi indicated that the SL is located at the 5' end of the small SL RNAs of these organisms. The T. brucei small SL RNA extension reveals one major product of 31 nucleotides, the size expected for a 5'terminal location of the SL. Other less abundant extension products were also detected; these either represent size heterogeneity within the small SL RNA fraction or artifacts produced in vitro. Primer extension of the T. cruzi small SL RNA fraction also revealed one major extension product, indicating that the SL is located precisely at the 5' terminus of the small SL RNA (see Figure 26 ). Minor extension products were again detected, suggesting the existence of small SL RNA species that start either 5 nucleotides within the SL sequence or contain additional nucleotides 5' to the SL.\n\nIn the 37 nucleotide L. collosoma SL-like sequence a region of 17 contiguous nucleotides is complementary to the 22-mer, but both the 3' and 5' 22-mer termini are mismatched. Therefore a 23 nucleotide oligomer complementary to positions 15-37 of the L. collosoma SL (see Figure 5 ) was synthesized (P. Barr, Chiron Corporation) for use as a primer. The 23-mer was 32P 5'-end-labeled, annealed with the L. collosoma small SL RNA fraction, and extended with reverse transcriptase in the presence of unlabeled deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. Two major extension products of 37 and 41 nucleotides were observed ( Figure 2C ). The former product is consistent with a 5'.terminal location of the SL, while the latter suggests The small SL RNA fractions from T. brucei, L. colfosoma, and T. cruzi were isolated by elution from separate preparative polyacrylamide gels. Lanes 1 and 2 are experiments with T. brucei and lanes 5 and 6 are with T. cruzi small SL RNA fractions, respectively. Each fraction (-10 ng) was incubated without (lanes 1 and 5) and with (lanes 2 and 6) unlabeled 22.mer (200 ng) and extended with AMV reverse transcriptase as described in Experimental Procedures. Lanes 3 and 4 represent primed extension of L. collosoma small RNA fraction using the 23 nucleotide oligomer specific for the L. collosoma SL sequence (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 5 ). In this case the 23.mer was 32P-labeled at its 5' end, hybridized, and extended in the absence (lane 3) and presence (lane 4) of L. collosoma small RNA. Following denaturation the samples were sized on 10% polyacrylamideurea sequencing gels using combined Ml3 sequencing reactions, M, as ladders to determine the extenston sizes. Arrows indicate the major extensron product observed for each small SL RNA. Extension products seen in both experimentill and control lanes apparently represent self-primed extensions from the sRNA fractions.\n\nthat a substantial fraction of the L. collosoma small SL RNA population contains four additional nucleotides 5' to the SL.\n\nThe sequences encoding the small SL RNAs were examined for the presence of introns by Sl nuclease protection experiments. The reiteration unit sense strand from each organism was cloned into the Ml3 bacteriophage vector mp8 . The complementary strand was synthesized by Klenow extension from the annealed Ml3 sequencing primer in the presence of one =P-labeled nucleotide triphosphate. These probes were then hybridized with total RNA and treated with Sl nuclease to degrade single-stranded DNA. The labeled DNA fragments protected by RNA from Sl nuclease digestion were sized by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. If each small SL RNA is transcribed from continuous DNA sequence, a fragment equivalent in size to the small SL RNA (as determined by Northern analysis) should be protected. As shown in Figure 3 , T. brucei total RNA protected labeled fragments ranging between 130 and 135 nucleotides from Sl degradation.\n\nIn addition to this major class, several small labeled fragments were also protected; most of these were also present in the control lane (no RNA) and presumably result from annealing of probe to the unlabeled complementary Ml 3 strand (Figure 4, lanes 1 and 3) . However, the appearance of the two sets of fragments centered at 115 and 100 nucleotides was RNA-dependent. It is unclear whether the latter fragments are protected by small RNA species that exist in vivo or whether they are artifacts of the Si analysis. However, in Northern blots, an RNA species of about 100 nucleotides is sometimes observed to hybridize with the T. brucei reiteration unit probe but not the 22.mer probe (data not shown). This RNA species may A \"P-labeled probe complementary to Ml 3 sense strand SL reiteration unit clone mpTb-1.4M(l) was synthesized as described in Experimental Procedures. This probe was hybridized in the absence (lane 1) and presence (lane 2) of 20 pg of T. brucei total RNA, Sl nuclease-treated, denatured, and electrophoresed on an 8% poiyacrylamide-urea gel as described in Experimental Procedures. Markers, lane M, were 3'.end-labeled DNA fragments of an Hpa 2 digestion of pSR 322, which were denatured prior to electrophoresis.\n\nLanes 3 and 4 show an Sl nuclease analysis of T. brucei total RNA with a T 3'.end-labeled Rsa I fragment from the reiteration unit. The labeled Rsa site is within the SL sequence and the fragment extends beyond the poly(T) stretch observed in the T. brucei sequence (see Figure  5 ). The labeled fragment was hybridized without (lane 3) and with (lane 4) T. brucei total RNA. Hybridization and Sl nuclease treatment were as described in Experimental Procedures. The arrow indites the major protected fragments. be derived from the 100 nucleotides 3' to the SL sequence in the small SL RNAs.\n\nSince the primer-extension analysis suggested that the 5' termini of the vast majority of T. brucei small SL RNAs was precisely at the beginning of the SL, we hypothesized that the variability in length seen in the Sl protection experiments was localized to the 3' end. This was confirmed by further Sl nuclease analysis using a fragment of the reiteration unit that extends from the Rsa I site within the SL (between nucleotides 26 and 27) through the Mbo I site at position 182 (see Figure 5 ) into the flanking vector sequence. The fragment was labeled at its 3' end, hybridized with total RNA, and treated with Sl nuclease. Fragments protected from degradation ranged from 103 to 109 nucleotides in length (Figure 3 , lanes 3 and 4) which is consistent with the predicted fragment sizes based on the position of the Rsa I site and the distribution of sizes observed for small SL RNA. Size heterogeneity thus occurs at the 3' end of the small SL RNA transcript.\n\nSl analyses using uniformly labeled reiteration unit probes from T. cruzi and L. collosoma indicated that RNA preparations from these organisms protected fragments whose sizes were consistent with those of the small SL RNAs determined in figure 1. The major protected fragments were somewhat heterogeneous in size, ranging from 90 to 94 nucleotides for L. collosoma, and 101 to 105 nucleotides for T. cruzi (Figure 4) . For the most part the heterogeneity is localized to the 3' termini of these small SL RNAs as determined by Sl analysis using endlabeled probes as described above (data not shown).\n\nThe combined data demonstrate that the predominant small SL RNA from each organism starts at or near the 5' terminus of an SL-like sequence, extends 3' without interruption, and ends in a region spanning several nucleotides.\n\nThe DNA sequences surrounding the SL in the reiteration units of T. brucei, L. collosoma, and T. cruzi are shown in Figure 5 ; the complete sequence of these units will be reported in detail elsewhere. In general, the sequences that encode the small SL RNAs are not well conserved. However, the sequences that are conserved are centered around the SL sequence itself and the region just downstream from the 3' end of the small SL RNAs. Within each of the SL sequences, there is a region of 14 contiguous nucleotides, the position and sequence of which are maintained in each of these organisms. The remaining nucleotides of the SL sequences are also conserved to various degrees: the SL sequence from T. cruzi differs from that of T. brucei by only three base residues, while the L. collosoma SL has 29 nucleotides in common with the T. brucei SL. Hybridization experiments performed with the 22 nucleotide T. brucei SL probe at reduced stringency indicate that most other genera of the Trypanosomatidae also contain repeated genomic sequences with homology to the SL and unpublished data) . It is clear from these experiments however, that in each case sequence conservation in the SL region spanned by the 22-mer is less than that observed between the T. brucei and L. collosoma sequences.\n\nSmall regions of sequence flanking both sides of the SL, and both sides of the small SL RNA sequence, are also shared among these three trypanosomatids. The nine nucleotides 5' to the SL are identical in T. brucei and T. cruzi while L. collosoma shares seven of these nucelotides. On its 3' side, the SL sequence is immediately followed by a GT nucleotide pair in each of these organisms. This dinucleotide is identical with the invariant dinucleotide present in the concensus sequence of intron 5' splice sites (Lerner et al., 1980; Rogers and Wall, 1980) and, as discussed below, appears to be a functional donor splice junction. Putative transcription initiation and termination regions for each small SL RNA are also shown in Figure  5 . Approximately 30 bp 5' to the SL in T. brucei, an ATrich region has been noted as a possible RNA polymerase II concensus promoter (DeLange et al., 1983; Campbell et al., 1984a Campbell et al., , 1984b Dorfman and Donelson, 1984) . This concensus is not maintained in either of the other reiteration units, although an AT-rich region at -30 to -40 bp is found in each sequence. Immediately following the 3' end of the small SL RNAs in all three cases is a sequence very rich in thymidine residues. The role of this punctuated poly(T) tract is unknown but its conserved features and location suggest that it is a functional sequence element.\n\nThe SL was first identified as a 5'terminal sequence shared by VSG transcripts (Boothroyd and Cross, 1982; Van der Ploeg et al., 1982) but it is now clear that many, if not all, T. brucei mRNAs contain this 35 nucleotide leader (Parsons et al., 1984a; DeLange et al., 1984a) . Several structural genes corresponding to SL mRNAs have been examined and in each of the cases studied, no linkage relationship has been demonstrated between the SL and the structural genes DeLange et al., 1983; Parsons et al., 1984a; Myler et al., 1984) . Although there are approximately 200 SL exons in the genome (Delange et al., 1983 ) their organization in one or at most a few large tandem array(s) and three to four orphons precludes the possibility that each of the many SL-utilizing genes is located in c/s to an SL exon. We have therefore hypothesized that SL and structural gene transcripts are joined by a mechanism that operates in trans Parsons et al., 1984a) .\n\nHow Is the SL Added to mRNAs? Eight T. brucei genes encoding mRNAs that employ the SL have been sequenced, five VSG (Boothroyd and Cross, 1982; Murphy et al., 1984; Michiels et al., 1983; Bernards et al., 1984 , Van der Ploeg et al., 1982 and three non-VSG genes (S. Sather and K. Watkins, unpublished data). Each of these genes contains a consensus mRNA 3' intron splice site precisely at the point of divergence between the structural gene and mRNA sequence, i.e., at the position where the SL is found in the mature transcript. Given the conservation (and apparent utilization) of an acceptor splice site in all eight genes, it appears that conventional mRNA splicing is involved in the process by which the SL is added to target mRNAs, either in the intermolecular reaction itself or during subsequent intramolecular RNA maturation.\n\nIn this report we have demonstrated the presence of small RNAs that contain the SL, or SL-like sequences, at or near their 5' ends in each of three trypanosomatid organisms, With the exception of conserved features centered around the SL sequence itself, these small SL RNAs are quite divergent and appear to be the only transcripts derived from their respective SL reiteration units. The conservation of a 5' mRNA intron splice site immediately flanking the 3' end of the SL in each of these three Small SL RNAs suggests that these molecules serve as SL donors in an intermolecular RNA joining reaction.\n\nWe propose two simple models for the addition of the SL to target mRNAs in trans ( Figures 6A and 6B) . First, the small SL RNA ( Figure 6A , left) or a cleavage product containing the intact SL and 5' splice site ( Figure 6A , right) might be used to prime transcription of SL-utilizing genes. Alternatively, the small SL RNA and target mRNAs may be independently transcribed from their own promoters and subsequently joined by either end-to-end ligation ( Figure  6B , right) or an intermolecular version of conventional RNA splicing ( Figure 6B , left). In several of these alternatives the initial intermolecular joining event produces a precursor SL mRNA containing an intervening sequence. Provided both the SL donor and target mRNA acceptor splice sites are retained in the precursor, it could be processed normally.\n\nIn the priming model, sequence complementarity between the SL, or remainder of the small SL RNA, and a region 5' to target genes could direct the primer to a site from which transcription of downstream mRNA sequences is initiated by extension from the 3' end of the SL primer. However, any such sequence homology must be quite limited as neither SL nor reiteration unit probes hybridize to genomic clones of SL target genes, even though these clones contain large amounts of 5'-flanking sequences (Parsons et al., 1984a) . A small region of homology to the SL is shared among the 5'-flanking regions of the three (non-VSG) target genes recently sequenced in our laboratory (S. Sather and K. Watkins, unpublished data). Blocks of 5, 6, and 10 contiguous nucleotides, complementary to all or part of the SL sequence pACAGTTTCTG, occur on the template strands just 5' to the acceptor splice sites of these three genes. It is not clear if this observation is pertinent to priming since the sites of transcription initiation have not been determined. Clearly if these or other SL target genes are initially transcribed as precursors containing excess 5' sequence, and preliminary evidence suggests this may be the case for one of the above mentioned genes (Parsons et al., 1984a) as well as for one VSG gene (Van der Ploeg et al., 1982) the putative primer recognition sequence should be located upstream from the 5' end of the primary transcript, not adjacent to the structural gene as in the above cases.\n\nSequence complementarity is not a mandatory requirement of the priming model since a protein, e.g., RNA polymerase, associated with either the SL primer or the target gene could also serve to align the two sequences for transcription initiation. Both corollaries of the priming model raise the same question: if transcription of all SL mRNAs requires priming, how is the small SL RNA itself transcribed? The simplest answer is that these genes are mRNAs Derived from the Small RNA? Figure 6 . Models of SL Addition to Target mRNAs in Trans (A) primed transcription and (6) intermolecular splicing/ligation. The symbols used are as follows: solid line (-), small SL RNA gene (Le., the reiteration unit); solid box 0, the 35 nucleotide SL; GU, the 5' splice site immediately following the SL in the small SL RNA; dashed line (---), the remainder of the small SL RNA beginning immediately 3' to the GU pair; vertical hatched box (E), SL target gene; open box (Q, putative 5' precursor RNA transcribed from the target gene; AG 3' splice site present in target gene nucleotides and hypothesized to be present on a target gene mRNA precursor prior to maturation; angled hatched box (@, mature SL mRNA. Each model presents two pathways of SL RNA maturation from several alternatives. The pathways illustrated favor utilization of the \"apparent\" intron/exon splice junctions present on these RNAs. In all cases intermediates and by-products are shown primarily to aid in visualization of each step; these intermediates may or may not be detectable.\n\ntranscribed by different polymerases, one of which requires the product of the other, i.e., the small SL RNA, as a cofactor, Alternatively, a single polymerase might first transcribe the small SL RNA and, with this primer bound, alter its promoter recognition properties to transcribe SL mRNAs. Campbell et al. (1984a Campbell et al. ( , 1984b have suggested a related discontinuous transcription model for VSG gene expression.\n\nThe second model for the addition of the SL to target mRNAs involves an intermolecular interaction between a small RNA and a separately transcribed mRNA precursor. Phrased in this manner, this statement might also describe models proposed for the function of the small Ul (Lerner et al., 1980; Rogers and Wall, 1980) and U4 (Berget, 1984) RNAs in mRNA splicing and polyadenylation, respectively. However, unlike U RNAs the small SL RNA would function as a substrate consumed during the course of the reaction. The small SL RNA and precursor mRNA could be ligated end-to-end to produce a precursor containing a hybrid intron. This precursor could then be processed normally by splicing at the SL donor and target mRNA acceptor splice sites. On the other hand, the 3' end of the small SL RNA and the 5' end of the precursor mRNA may be thought of as parts of a discontinuous intron, which, if aligned properly, could undergo intermolecular splicing by conventional intramolecular mechanisms. Both variations of the splicing model require that the target mRNA is transcribed as a precursor containing at the least two additional 5' nucleotides (AG/) that comprise the acceptor splice site ( Figure 6B ). As noted above, DNA sequences 5' to each of eight SL-utilizing structural genes contain the AG at the appropriate splice junction.\n\nThere are no compelling precedents that favor either of these models; both mechanisms have been invoked in the past to explain related phenomena. Transcription of the influenza (Krug et al., 1979) and coronavirus (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1984) RNA genomes, and production of defective interfering particles (Lazzirini et al., 1981) of negative-strand RNA viruses have been explained by RNA priming of transcription reinitiation (and other variations of a jumping polymerase model). In the case of influenza virus, small 5' capped oligonucleotides derived from hostcell mRNAs are used by a viral polymerase complex to prime viral transcription; no sequence homology between primer and template is involved in this process (Plotch et al., 1981) . Intermolecular RNA recombination (i.e., splicing/ ligation) occurring post-transcriptionally has been hypothesized in the putative origin and evolution of viroid RNAs from plant cell introns (Zimmern, 1982) .\n\nBoth models suggest that the small SL RNA resides in the nucleus, most likely as an RNP complex. In general, the priming model predicts that the SL (or small SL RNA) sequence is present on nascent target mRNA transcripts, whereas in the splicing/ligation model the SL is added post-transcriptionally.\n\nSplicing intermediates are for the most part different, depending on the function of the SL in either priming or post-transcriptional ligation. It may be possible to characterize some of the excised sequences (perhaps the 100 bp fragment, Figure 3 ) to resolve between alternative models. Our efforts to reconstitute these activities in vitro, patterned on recent developments in mammalian systems (Krainer et al., 1984; Grabowski et al., 1984) if successful, should define the mechanism of SL addition to trypanosomatid mRNAs.\n\nCeil Culture and RNA Methods\n\nProcedures for cell culture and RNA isolation from E. coli, T. brucei, L. collosoma, and Crithidia fasciculata were as previously described (Milhausen et al., 1983; Parsons et al., 1963) . High-salt-fractionated T. cruzi RNA was kindly provided by Drs. P. Lizardi and N. Nogueira. RNA was electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gel in the presence of TEE (60 mM Tris-CL, pH 6.3. 60 mM Na borate, and 2.5 mM NaEDTA). RNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide. RNA gels were electroblotted to a Zeta-probe membrane (BioRad Laboratories) in 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 20 mM NaAcetate, and 2 mM NaEDTA for 1 hr at 0.3 V/cm and 1 hr at 0.7 V/cm, baked at 80\u00b0C for 2 hr under vacuum, and then hybridized (sea below). The small SL RNA fractions from T. brucei, L. collosoma, and T. cruzi were isolated by elution from separate preparative polyacrylamide gels. Strips of polyacrylamide from the small SL RNA-containing regions of each gel were sliced and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 16 hr and 65\u00b0C for 2 hr in TBE. The buffer was decanted, extracted with iso-amyl alcohol, and ethanolprecipitated.\n\nto RNA Blots A synthetic 22 nucleotide oligcmer complementary to the SL (22.men see Figure 5 ) was T S'end-labeled as described previously . Conditions for hybridization of this probe to RNA blots were; 18 hr at 34\u00b0C in 5x SSPE (0.9 M NaCI, 0.05 M NaH&'O,, 0.005 M N&EDTA, pH 7.4) 0.25% sarkosyl, 200 fig/ml denatured salmon testis DNA and with 5 x 16 cpm of probe (specific activity ca. 5 X lb cpm/pmole) per ml of hybridization solution. After hybridization the blot was washed twice at 2O'C and twice at 34OC in the fresh hybridization solution.\n\nMl3 (sense strand) SL-reiteration unit clones from T. brucei, mpTb-1.4M(l); T. cruzi, mpTc-O&S(l); and L. collosoma, mplc-O.GT(l) were previously described . \"P-labeled probes were prepared by Klenow synthesis using the sequencing primer in the presence of =P-dCTP and dATP, dGTP, dTTP. Hybridization to RNA blots was for 18 hr at 42\u00b0C in 5X SSPE, 0.1% sarkosyl, 200 Hg/ml salmon testis DNA, 50% formamide, 25 mM sodium phosphate, and with 4 x lb cpm of probe per ml of hybridization solution. After hybridization the blots were washed three times at 20\u00b0C in 1 X SSPE, 0.1% sarkosyl, and once at 50\u00b0C in 0.3~ SSPE, 0.1% sarkosyf.\n\nSmall RNA fractions (-10 ng) obtained by elution as described above were incubated with unlabeled 22.mer (200 ng) in a final volume of 5 ~1. All samples were heated for 15 min at 65'C, then 45 min at 37'C for T. brucei and 25OC for T. cruzi small RNA. The following were then added to the samples; 1 ~1 of 10x buffer (506 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 500 mM KCI, 80 mM MgCl, and 400 mM DTT). 1 ~1 of IO mM dATP, IO mM dGTP. and 10 mM lTP and 10 &i of u-?-dCTP (400 Ci/mmole, New England Nuclear). Extension reactions, in a final volume of IO pl, were initiated by the addition of 14 U AMV reverse transcriptase.\n\nFollowing incubation at 42oC for 30 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of SB buffer (90% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and the samples boiled and loaded onto a 10% polyacryfamrde urea sequencing gel. Primer extension of the L. collosoma small RNA fraction was as above for T. brucei with the following exceptions: the 23 nucleotide =P 5'end-labeled olgomer (see Figure 5 ) was used and 1 pl of 10 mM dCTP was substituted for the radioactive dCTP.\n\nBl Nuclease Analysis ~-labeled probes complementary to the Ml3 sense strand reiteration unit clones of T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. collosoma were synthesized as described above. Each probe was hybridized in the absence (lane 1) and presence (lane 2) of 20 rg of total RNA. The probe and RNA-probe samples were boiled for 10 min and then incubated at 50\u00b0C for 3 hr. Hybrtdization conditions in 30 pl were; 80% formamide, 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mM NaEDTA, and 406 mM NaCI. The samples were diluted by the addition of 300 PI of 0.28 NaCl, 0.048 M NaAcetate. 4.5 mM ZnSO,, 20 WI/ml singlestranded salmon testis DNA, and 14 U/ml Sl nuclease (PL Biochemicals). Following a 30 min incubation at 37\u00b0C the samples were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 25 pg of carrier tRNA. The redissolved pellets were electrophoresed on 8% polyacryfamide-urea gels, 3' Sl nuclease analysis of T. brucei total RNA was with a =P 3'-endlabeled Rsa I fragment from the reiteration unit. The labeled Rsa site is with the SL sequence and the fragment extends beyond the poly(T) stretch observed in the T. brucei sequence (see Figure 5 ). Hybridization and Sl nuclease treatment were as described above.\n\nThe reiteration units from T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. colloscma were cloned in Ml3 phages and sequenced as previously described (Parsons et al.. 1984a) ."}
