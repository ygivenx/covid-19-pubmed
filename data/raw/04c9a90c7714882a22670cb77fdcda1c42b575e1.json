This was irrespective of the stage of infection. As previously reported by Sawicki and Sawicki (1986) , this transcription differential dependence was not observed for MHV. The UV transcription mapping data showed that the Third, the overall MHV transcription was significantly EAV sg RNAs were not produced by processing of a more dependent on de novo protein synthesis than that genome-length precursor RNA. However, unlike the case of EAV and SIN. Even during the late phase of the MHV of the SIN sg RNA, their UV target sizes were larger than infection cycle, when all infected cells were fused into expected on the basis of their physical sizes, even when one large syncytium, both genomic and sg RNA synthesis sg RNA synthesis had reached its maximum.

In that case, the transcription of e.g., the measured by metabolic labeling. RNAs were isolated and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) .

It is clear that the relative RNA sizes and relative UV sensitivities (Table 1 ) On the basis of these experiments a number of conclusions could be drawn. First, ongoing protein synthesis do not support the conclusion that the transcription of the EAV genomic and sg RNAs are fully independent. was most important during the early phase of infection. Second, compared to genomic RNA synthesis, EAV sg A similar analysis of our MHV data (Table 1 ) also revealed that the transcription of the sg RNAs of coronavi-RNA synthesis was more dependent on protein synthe- ruses is not fully independent from that of genomic RNA.\n\nbeen published by Jacobs et al. (1981) and Yokomori et al. (1992) . Both groups reported differences between the As for EAV, there are clear differences in UV sensitivity between larger and smaller RNAs, but the quantitative UV target sizes of the various MHV RNAs which are in the same range as our observations. For example, the MHV analysis shows differences between relative physical sizes and relative UV sensitivities. Our results are in UV target size of MHV RNA 7 calculated by Jacobs et al. (1981) is only about eight times smaller than that of geno-general agreement with those which have previously mic RNA, whereas the physical size ratio is about 1:18. Due to the fact that at that time the length of the MHV genome was assumed to be only 16 kb, instead of the currently known 31 kb, Jacobs et al. (1981) concluded that their data supported fully independent transcription of MHV genomic and sg RNAs. Yokomori et al. (1992) , who recently repeated the MHV UV transcription mapping experiments, did not describe a detailed quantitative analysis of the data they obtained late in infection, but concluded that UV sensitivities roughly paralleled mRNA sizes. However, a calculation using the graphs published by Yokomori et al. (1992) revealed only a sevenfold difference between the genomic RNA and RNA 7. Similar observations were made when we reevaluated the data obtained with another coronavirus, infectious bronchitis FIG. 5 . The synthesis of sg RNAs 2, 6, and 7, relative to that of the genomic RNA, during different time intervals throughout infection. Data virus (Stern and Sefton, 1982) . sulted in an almost perfect correlation between physical RNA sizes and UV target sizes ( Fig. 2; Table 1 ). These results demonstrate that the experimental approach was models have been put forward, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive (Jeong and Makino, 1994; Sawicki and appropriate and that our observations for EAV cannot be explained by technical imperfections. Apparently, the Sawicki, 1990; van der Most et al., 1994) . Leader-primed transcription could, for example, generate a first genera-intrinsic properties of coronavirus-like RNA transcription are different from those of alphaviruses.\n\ntion of sg mRNAs, which could subsequently function as templates for sg minus-strand production. These could Although cis-splicing events cannot be ruled out as an early-stage mechanism to produce sg RNAs, another in turn be used to transcribe a second generation of positive-strand sg mRNAs. The recent analysis of the transcription mechanism must be operating in EAV-infected cells and is most likely similar to that of coronavi-transcriptional activity of a number of MHV ts-mutants indicates that sg minus strands are likely to be used ruses. The so-called leader-primed transcription model has been proposed to explain the synthesis of coronavi-as transcription templates late in infection (Schaad and Baric, 1994) . Like the UV transcription mapping results rus sg RNAs (Baric et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1983 ) and a substantial amount of data in its favor has been re-described for MHV (Yokomori et al., 1992) , our data on EAV indicate that different mechanisms of sg RNA tran-ported (for a review: Spaan et al., 1988; Lai, 1990) . According to this model, sg RNAs are synthesized either scription might be operating simultaneously. The differences in UV sensitivity of sg RNA synthesis early and by an intrinsic ability of the viral leader/polymerase complex to dissociate from its template and subsequently late in infection (Fig. 3) can be interpreted to reflect the levels at which each of these mechanisms participate in resume synthesis at a more distal position or by priming by free leader transcripts at subgenomic promoter se-transcription, at a given stage in infection.\n\nWe have considered the possibility that replicase syn-quences (the complements of the so-called intergenic sequences on the positive strand). The conserved thesis was affected by UV irradiation and that genomic and sg RNA synthesis were inhibited as a result. Differen-leader-body junction sequences in EAV sg RNAs (de Vries et al., 1990; den Boon et al., manuscript in prepara- tial effects of translation inhibition early vs late in infection (Fig. 4 ) may be based on the properties as well as tion) possibly represent such complementary promoter sequences. Similar sequence elements have been de-the absolute amount of the replicase. Our results and previously published data from Sawicki and Sawicki scribed for other arteriviruses (Godeny et al., 1993; Conzelmann et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1993; Meulenberg et (1986) on MHV RNA transcription indicated that ongoing protein synthesis is an absolute requirement during the al., 1993b; Zeng et al., 1995) . A single genome-length minus-strand RNA could be the template used for the early stages of infection and that both MHV genomic and sg RNA synthesis at later stages were still significantly synthesis of genomic as well as sg mRNAs. Nevertheless, anti-leader-containing subgenomic minus strands reduced when translation was blocked. In contrast, the EAV data indicated that the synthesis of sg RNAs was in coronavirus-infected cells have been demonstrated (Hofmann et al., 1990; Sethna et al., 1989 Sethna et al., , 1991 . Their more impaired by inhibition of translation than was the case for the production of genomic RNA. In addition, the presence in double-stranded replicative intermediates suggests that these might function in mRNA transcription data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 revealed that sg RNA synthesis is down-regulated relative to the synthesis of (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990 ). On the basis of these and other observations several coronavirus transcription genomic RNA late in infection (Fig. 5) ."}
