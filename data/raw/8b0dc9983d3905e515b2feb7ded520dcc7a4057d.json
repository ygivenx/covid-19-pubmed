{"title": "Beta-cyclodextrin derivatives as carriers to enhance the antiviral activity of an antisense oligonucleotide directed toward a coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence", "body": "The use of antisense oligonucleotides is an interesting approach to study cellular and viral gene function and to block gene expression [2, 3, 60] . Oligonucleotides have been considered as ideal agents for inhibiting viral replication due in part to their high speci\u00aecity for viral DNA and RNA sequences. These agents have been successfully employed to block the replication and cellular expression of several viruses, including herpes simplex virus [20] , cytomegalovirus [43] and especially human immunode\u00aeciency virus [33] . However, the vulnerability of oligonuleotides to nucleases' attack, combined with their intracellular distribution and uptake properties, have limited their therapeutic potential. To avoid the problem of nucleases' digestion and to improve the cellular uptake of oligonucleotides, either chemical modi\u00aecations of the internucleoside phosphodiester linkages [35] or of the ribose sugar [25] and various oligonucleotide conjugates have been tested. One chemical analog that is widely employed for enhanced stability is the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. But, although this analog has increased resistance to degradation in vivo and in vitro [1, 46, 59] it has exhibited sequence-speci\u00aec and non sequence-speci\u00aec activities [11, 54, 55] . The oligonucleotide conjugates include oligonucleotide adsorbed onto poly (isobutylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles [40] , encapsulated in liposomes [23] or conjugated to the cholesterol [18, 26] . These strategies have resulted in an increase of the cellular uptake of oligonucleotide and / or stability against nucleases. However, the inherent properties of the cholesterol, liposomes or nanoparticles carriers led to increase the immunogenicity of the oligonucleotide complex and the tendency of the complex to be phagocytosed by the reticuloendothelial system [44] .\n\nInvestigations in cyclodextrin chemistry \u00aeeld have been increased since several decades. Cyclodextrins are molecular hosts acting as carriers. It frameworks describes a group of cyclic polysaccharides containing 6 to 8 glucose units in a- (1, 4) linkage (a-CD, b-CD and g-CD have respectively 6, 7 or 8 glucose units). They possess an hydrophobic internal cavity which can include various small molecules and a peripheral structure containing a large number of hydroxyl groups making the molecule water soluble. The cyclodextrins form complexes with numerous compounds and b-cyclodextrin is the most employed for numerous applications. A wide variety of cyclodextrins and derivatives has been studied to enhance the solubility and the availability of various water-soluble and water-insoluble pharmacological agents [6, 9, 21, 38, 64] . This approach using cyclodextrin derivatives has been recently studied to increase the cellular uptake of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides [65] . In this work, we have investigated the ability of native b-and gcyclodextrins and b-cyclodextrin derivatives as carriers to enhance the antiviral activity of a phosphodiester oligonucleotide directed toward the initiation region of the mRNA coding for the spike protein and containing the intergenic consensus sequence of an enteric coronavirus.\n\nThe native cyclodextrins were purchased from Roquette-fre \u00c1res (Dijon, France) for bcyclodextrin (b-CD) and from Wacker-chemie GmbH, (Lyon, France) for g-cyclodextrin (g-CD). The chemically modi\u00aeed cyclodextrins were synthetised in our laboratory according to [17] for 6-deoxy-6-S-b-D-galactopyranosyl-6-thio-cyclomaltoheptaose (S-Gal-b-CD) and heptakis (6-deoxy-6-S-b-D-galactopyranosyl)-6-thio-cyclomaltoheptaose (7(S-Gal)-b-CD) or to [39] for heptakis [6-deoxy-6-(1-2-amino) ethylamino]-cyclomaltoheptaose (7(ethane-diamino)-b-CD). All the derivatives were soluble in distilled water and sterilized by \u00aeltration through a 0.22 mm membrane (Millipore, France) before use. Their chemical structures are presented in Fig. 1 .\n\nOligonucleotides were purchased from Appligene (Strasbourg, France). An antisense sequence (3 H TGGTATTAGATTTGTACA 5 H ), synthetized as natural phosphodiester (O \u00c0 oligo) and phosphorothioate analog (S \u00c0 oligo), a sense sequence (5 H ACCATAATC-TAAACATGT 3 H ), synthetized as phosphorothioate analog (S oligo) and a random sequence (5 H GAATTGTGATATTTCATG 3 H ), synthetized as phosphorothioate analog (S r oligo) have been tested. All these oligonucleotides were puri\u00aeed by HPLC, lyophilized and the powder was dissolved in distilled water.\n\nThe F15 strain of Bovine Enteric Coronavirus (BECV) was obtained from Laporte (INRA, Jouy-en-Josas, France) and propagated in the human rectal adenocarcinoma tumor cell line (HRT-18) grown in RPMI 1640 medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA, USA) supplemented with 2% foetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Eragny, France), 10 mg/ ml o\u00afoxacin as antibiotic (Roussel Uclaf, Romainville, France) and incubated at 37 C for 3 or 4 days in a humidi\u00aeed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 [30, 31] .\n\nThe complexes were prepared taking in account the b-and -cyclodextrins solubility data according to Higuchi and Connors [19] . Cyclodextrins are regular cyclic oligosaccharidyl molecules exhibiting a tronconic ring which are for simplicity represented by a truncated cone with the wider side formed by the secondary 2-and 3-hydroxyl groups and the narrower side by the primary 6-hydroxyl A volume of 7.5 mM phosphodiester oligonucleotide (O \u00c0 oligo) was added to 75 mM b-CD, 75 mM g-CD, 7.5 to 750 mM S-Gal-b-CD, 75 mM 7(S-Gal)-b-CD or 75 mM 7(ethanediamino)-b-CD in a 0.5 ml total volume of RPMI 1640 medium. The solutions were mixed overnight at 25 C by vortexing at 200 rpm with a Rotatest 74 401 apparatus (Bioblock-Scienti\u00aec, Illkirch, France) and the resulting complexes were immediately tested [51] . Complex formation has been controlled by circular dichro\u00f5 \u00c8sm measurement and observation of oligonucleotide absorbance intensity at 260 nm (data not shown).\n\nThe cellular viability was evaluated by the modi\u00aeed MTT assay as previously described [4] . HRT-18 cells were grown at con\u00afuence in 96-well\u00afat bottom culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4\u00c210 4 cells per well and treated with varying concentrations of oligonucleotides (1 to 100 mM) or native cyclodextrins (1 to 8 mM) or CD derivatives (0.1 to 1 mM) for 16 h at 37 C. At the end of the incubation period, the cytotoxic effect of the drug was evaluated by determination of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using the MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium Bromide (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA). The absorbance of the solubilized material was determined using a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340 MK II apparatus (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). A cytotoxic effect corresponds to a decrease in purple formazan production. Results shown are the average from three experiments.\n\nHRT-18 cells were exposed for 1 h at 37 C to various concentrations of free oligonucleotides or oligonucleotides complexed with cyclodextrins and, at the same time, were inoculated with a BECV suspension at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.1, 1 or 10 PFU / cell (Plaque Forming Units / cell). At 16 h post-infection, the virus titration was performed by the plaque forming assay using crystal violet for visualization, as previously described [30, 31, 61] . In interpreting viral titers, con\u00aedence intervals were determined and were taken into consideration [7] .\n\nIntracellular RNAs were extracted from infected HRT-18 cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method [12] using a commercial``Message systems''kit (Bioprobe Systems, Montreuil-sous-Bois, France). The RNA pellets were dissolved in nuclease free water and adjusted to 2.2 M formaldehyde \u00b1 50% formamide in MOPS (morpholinepropane sulfonic acid) buffer (20 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA). Samples were denatured at 65 C for 10 min and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1 % agarose gel and 2.2 M formaldehyde \u00b1 MOPS buffer as previously described [37] . After electrophoresis, the gel was treated with 50 mM NaOH for 20 min, soaked in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water, then in 20 \u00c2 SSPE (1 \u00c2 SSPE is 3.6 M NaCl, 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH 7.7, 0.02 M EDTA) for 45 min. RNAs were transfered overnight on a hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) in 20 \u00c2 SSPE, then baked at 80 C for 2 h. Nylon membrane was prehybridized for 2 h at 42 C in plastic bags containing a solution of 50% formamide \u00b1 5 \u00c2 Denhardt's solution (1 \u00c2 is 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidine, 0.02% bovine serum albumine) \u00b1 0.5% SDS \u00b1 5 \u00c2 SSPE and 200 mg/ml of sonicated calf thymus DNA. Hybridization was done overnight in the same solution at 42 C using a [ 32 P] DNA probe prepared by random-primed labelling of gel puri\u00aeed BECV 3 H end speci\u00aec cDNA fragment (1.8 Kb) as previously described [13, 47] . The membrane was washed twice at room temperature for 10 min in 2 \u00c2 SSPE, 0.1% SDS then once at 65 C for 15 min in 1 \u00c2 SSPE, 0.1% SDS and then once at 65 C for 10 min in 0.1 SSPE, 0.1% SDS. The membrane was air-dried and autoradiographed on X-ray \u00aelm (Kodak X Omat AR-5, N.Y, USA).\n\nIn\u00afuence of oligonucleotides on the cell viability These effects were evaluated by the MTT assay after 16 h of treatment of the HRT-18 cells with increasing concentrations (1 to 100 mM) of each oligonucleotide. Figure 2 shows that S r , S \u00c0 and O \u00c0 oligonucleotides exhibited no inhibitory effect on the viability of the cells at any concentration tested.\n\nThe antiviral activities of the antisense phosphodiester (O \u00c0 oligo) and its phosphorothioate analog (S \u00c0 oligo) were evaluated as described in Materials and methods. HRT-18 cells were exposed to various oligonucleotide concentrations (2.5 mM to 25 mM) and, at the same time, were infected by a BECV suspension at a MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37 C. At 16 h postinfection the virus titers of the treated infected cells were determined comparatively to those obtained with control infected cells. We observed In\u00afuence of oligonucleotides on cell viability. Cells grown to con\u00afuence (4.10 4 cells/well) were treated for 16 h with S r (1), S \u00c0 (2) and O \u00c0 (3) oligonucleotides at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mM. Cell viability was evaluated by their dehydrogenase activity (MTT assay). Each point is the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate and error bars represent standard error of mean ( Fig. 3 ) about 88 to 66% of viral production when cells were treated with 7.5 to 25 mM of O \u00c0 oligo. In contrast the S \u00c0 oligo signi\u00aecantly reduced the ability of BECV to form plaques on HRT-18 cells. When cells were treated with 7.5 to 25 mM of the S \u00c0 oligo, from 44 to 10% of viral growth were observed comparatively to control infected cells. These results con\u00aerm that the inhibition is dose-dependent and that the phosphorothioate analogue exhibited a more pronounced antiviral activity than the phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide.\n\nIn\u00afuence of the viral multiplicity of infection The antiviral activity of 25 mM of S \u00c0 oligo in presence of various viral MOI (0.1, 1 or 10 PFU/cell) was also evaluated. The results are presented on Fig. 4 . Respectively 10% or 34% of virus production were observed in cultures infected with 0.1 or 1 PFU/cell. In contrast in presence of an MOI of 10 PFU/ cell, the use of 25 mM of S \u00c0 oligo inhibit weakly the virus infectivity, we obtained 66% of viral growth.\n\nSequence speci\u00aec effect of the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide on the viral growth In order to study the speci\u00aecity of the antiviral activity of the phosphorothioate analogue, sense (S oligo), antisense (S \u00c0 oligo), and random (S r oligo) oligonucleotides were comparatively tested. Using oligonucleotide concentrations of 15 or 25 mM and a MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell we showed (Fig. 5 ) that in presence of S r oligo and S oligo, no signi\u00aecant antiviral effect was observed, whereas 25 mM S \u00c0 oligo allowed only 10% of viral production. These results con\u00aerm the antisense sequence speci\u00aecity of the S \u00c0 oligo antiviral activity. (MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell) or mock-infected (medium containing 2% FCS) were exposed to a 25 mM either S \u00c0 oligo, S r oligo or S oligo. Each oligonucleotide and the viral suspension were added together at the same time of infection. After 7 h post-infection intracellular RNA extracts were separated by electrophoresis, transfered to a membrane and hybridized to a cDNA probe representing the 3 H end of the BECV genome (including almost all the N and a part of the M gene) [13] Autoradiograms (Fig. 6) showed that in infected cells, 7 RNA species could be detected at 7 h post-infection. These mRNAs were transcribed in nonequimolar amounts. They were named mRNA 2 to 7 (2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) according to decreasing order of size coding for viral proteins ns2, HE, S, ns3, ns4, M and N respectively, as already described [24] . Although the oligonucleotide had a sequence complementary to mRNA3, the synthesis of all mRNAs was signi\u00aecantly reduced when cells were treated with S \u00c0 oligo. In the same conditions, mRNA pro\u00aeles or production were not affected when cells were treated with sense oligo (S oligo) and random oligo (S r oligo) comparatively to untreated infected cells.\n\nIn\u00afuence of cyclodextrins on the cell viability The effect of native CD and cyclodextrin derivatives on cell viability have been tested. Native b-CD and g-CD (Fig. 7) did not inhibit the cellular viability at concentrations varying from 1 to 8 mM. On the contrary, the b-CD stimulated the cell dehydrogenase activity, we obtained an increase of cell viability with concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 mM. Concerning the CD derivatives, it can be observed from Fig. 8 that S-Gal-b-CD and 7(S-Gal)-b-CD exhibited no Fig. 6 . Northern blot analysis of subgenomic RNAs. Intracellular RNAs were extracted at 7 h post-infection, separated by formaldehyde-1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transfered to a nylon membrane. The probe was prepared by random primed [ 32 P] labelling of enteric coronavirus-speci\u00aec cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3 H end of genomic RNA. Autoradiograms were exposed overnight at \u00c080 C with an intensifying screen. Infected cells (MOI 0.1 PFU/cell) (1), infected cells treated with S r oligo (2) or S oligo (3) or S \u00c0 oligo (4). Each oligonucleotide was used at a concentration of 25 mM Table 1 ) that with O \u00c0 oligo the viral production was 75% which was similar to previously obtained (88%). After complexation with cyclodextrins, the inhibition was improved, 50% of viral production was obtained with [O \u00c0 oligo-\n\nIn\u00afuence of the molar ratio between oligonucleotide and S-Gal-b-CD on the improvement of the antiviral activity We have evaluated the in\u00afuence of the molar ratio between the O \u00c0 oligo and the S-Gal-b-CD on the antiviral activity of the phosphodiester oligonucleotide. O \u00c0 oligo was used at a concentration of 7.5 mM and S-Gal-b-CD at concentrations ranging from 7.5 mM to 750 mM. We showed (Fig. 9 ) that at molar ratio \n\nThe effect of the S-Gal-b-CD on the viral multiplication was evaluated. The results ( Table 2) showed that no inhibitory effect in viral production was HRT-18 cells were inoculated with viral suspension (MOI 0.1 PFU/cell) in presence of S-Gal-b-cyclodextrin at various concentrations. After 16 h post-infection the virus titers were determined by the plaque forming assay. L 1 Lower 95% limit of con\u00aedence interval, L u upper 95% limit of con\u00aedence interval b-cyclodextrin derivatives observed. Nevertheless with 750 mM, there was a signi\u00aecant stimulation of about 180% in viral growth.\n\nCoronaviruses which have an original replication procedure can be candidates for antisense strategy. These viruses cause acute and / or persistent infections and might be etiological agents for autoimmune diseases [16, 41, 45] . They are enveloped viruses which contain a single-stranded, positive-sensed polyadenylated genome. They possess three or four major structural proteins. All coronaviruses have spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and some have a haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. In addition, there are at least four genes that encode nonstructural proteins (ns1 to 4) [29, 58] . During the replication in infected cells, genomic RNA is transcribed into genomesized, negative-stranded RNA which serves as template for the synthesis of a 3 Hcoterminal nested set of 7 to 8 subgenomic mRNAs [52, 56] and only the 5 Hproximal region which is not present in the next smaller RNA of the set is used for translation [48] . Another unique feature of coronavirus mRNAs is that the 5 H ends of genomic RNA and of all mRNAs contain a 72\u00b177 nucleotide-long leader sequence [27, 28] . Studies made on the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis [10, 50] have shown that the 3 H end of the leader sequence contains a repeated UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence included in the unique UCUAAAC consensus sequence (or similar sequence) observed in all intergenic regions of genomic RNA. Thus the mRNA transcriptional start is the result of the interaction between the leader sequence of the positive-stranded RNA and the complementary antileader sequence of the negative-stranded RNA [49, 50] .\n\nThis intergenic consensus sequence, common to the transcription initiation sites of mRNAs could be an interesting target for an antisense oligonucleotide. We have targeted it by a 18-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the initiation region of mRNA coding for S protein and which contains the unique UCUAAAC intergenic consensus sequence which is the promoter of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs transcription [36] .\n\nWe have shown that 25 mM phosphorothioate antisense (S \u00c0 oligo) oligonucleotide is able to inhibit 90% of enteric coronavirus growth in HRT-18 cells at a MOI of 0.1. The intensity of the inhibitory effect of S \u00c0 oligo is a function of its concentration and of the multiplicity of viral infection. In previous studies, ef\u00aecient inhibition of gene expression by antisense sequence in cells requiring oligonucleotide concentrations in the range of 1 to 100 mM have been reported. The great varieties in the biological models investigated render comparisons dif\u00aecult [3, 8, 20, 32, 33, 43, 57] .\n\nIn the same experimental conditions, only 34% of the viral production is inhibited by the unmodi\u00aeed phosphodiester antisense (O \u00c0 oligo) oligonucleotide. The absence of a more signi\u00aecant inhibitory effect of this oligonucleotide may be related to its rapid degradation by nucleases and to its reduced cellular uptake. Our observations about the cellular uptake of\u00afuorescein-conjugated oligonucleotides have revealed (data not shown) that only 1 mM of S \u00c0 oligo is quickly (`1 h) internalized by HRT-18 cells and that\u00afuorescence is present both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of cells. In contrast, intracellular localization of even 20 mM of O \u00c0 oligo can not be noticed. Studies have shown [8, 22, 62] that the uptake of oligonucleotides is a complex process which depends on many factors including cell type, structure and chemical modi\u00aecations of oligonucleotides, temperature and time of incubation. This uptake is a saturable process that probably occurs through an 80 kD protein but the true role of this protein is still unknown [5, 34] . The stronger inhibitory effect observed with S \u00c0 oligo could be related to an increase in stability and in lipophilicity resulting from the replacement of the oxygen atom by sulfur [15] . It has thus been reported that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are more strongly associated with cell membranes than the corresponding phosphodiester [8] .\n\nAs previously observed [3, 20, 32, 33, 43] the antiviral activity of S \u00c0 oligo is not due to an oligonucleotide induced cytotoxicity. Assays to measure host-cell viability reveal that the oligonucleotides tested do not affect the level of cellular metabolism even at high concentration (100 mM) which is 4-fold in excess of inhibitory concentration (25 mM) .\n\nIt is noteworthy that non-sequence-speci\u00aec oligonucleotides can inhibit HIV replication especially at high concentrations [53\u00b155]. So, a random unrelated phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (S r oligo) with the same base composition as S \u00c0 oligo but without homology with any known sequence in genomic RNA shows no activity. Therefore, the inhibition of virus growth does not seem to be due to a non-sequence-speci\u00aec effect. In addition a sense oligonucleotide (S oligo) at any concentration employed does not inhibit virus growth showing that the antiviral mechanism of action of S \u00c0 oligo is antisense. These results are con\u00aermed by northern blotting analysis in which all transcripts are signi\u00aecantly reduced in infected cells when 25 mM of S \u00c0 oligo is used. In contrast RNAs levels are unaffected by non-speci\u00aec control (S r oligo) or by sense (S oligo) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. In addition, northern blotting shows that the antisense phosphorothioate S \u00c0 oligo acts through a transcription inhibition mechanism in which the duplex made by hybridization of positive-stranded genomic RNA and S \u00c0 oligo stops the synthesis of the full length negative stranded-RNA preventing so a subgenomic and genomic RNA synthesis. The non-inhibitory effect of the sense oligonucleotide could be explained by considering the viral replication mechanism. The transcription of the mRNA is initiated after the hybridization between the leader and anti-leader sequences. The anti-leader sequence contains the anti-consensus sequence which is the target of the sense oligonucleotide. Consequently, we assume that a competition occurs between the leader sequence and the sense oligonucleotide for hybridization to their target. This competition might be in favour of the leader sequence mainly due to its total complementarity to its target and due also to a highest af\u00aenity. Our results provide evidence that the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence of the positive-stranded genomic RNA is a good target for an antisense oligonucleotide antiviral action. The inhibiting effect on virus growth is mediated by the ability of the oligonucleotide to interfere with mRNA transcription.\n\nHowever, some potential disadvantages may be inherent to the use of phosphorothioate analogs. There is no assurance that substitution of a phosphorothioate for a phosphodiester in an oligonucleotide would preserve its ability to bind with similar high af\u00aenity to its target. In addition studies have shown [14] that the sulfur on phosphorothioate may provide a novel reactive center on a DNA molecule for drug interactions and this interaction may affect the ef\u00aecacy of the antisense compound. It may also act by viral polymerase inhibition or by interference with viral adsorption or penetration or by inhibition of cellular enzymes or growth factors [55] . Moreover commercially phosphorothioates tend to be more expensive than the phosphodiester oligonucleotides. To avoid these problems, we attempted to improve the properties of the phosphodiester oligonucleotide by complexation with cyclodextrin supermolecules. We compared the biological activity of the phosphodiester antisense oligonucleotide (O \u00c0 oligo) either free or complexed with native b-CD and -CD or b-cyclodextrin derivatives. When the O \u00c0 oligo is complexed either with native b-, g-CD, or with a 7(ethane-diamino)-b-CD derivative, 50% decrease in viral multiplication is observed. The inhibition is higher (75%) after its complexation with S-Gal-b-CD or 7(S-Gal)-b-CD. Moreover, the antiviral activity of O \u00c0 oligo complexed with S-Gal-b-CD is improved to 90% if the complexation is performed in the [O \u00c0 oligo-CD] molar ratio of [1:100; 7.5 mM: 750 mM]. The same level of inhibition is obtained in presence of 25 mM of S \u00c0 oligo, a concentration three fold up to that used in the complex.\n\nIt has been demonstrated in the last year that substituted cyclodextrins were no longer biological amorphous compounds, but could exhibit biological activities such as antiviral activity [42, 63] . We checked that the chemical modi\u00aecation of b-CD does not induce any cyclodextrin antiviral nor anticellular effect. S-Gal-b-CD induces no inhibitory effect on the viral multiplication at the concentrations used for the preparation of the complexes. Moreover, assays to measure cell viability show no cytotoxic action of the cyclodextrins. These observations exclude the possibility that the antiviral activity obtained with the [O \u00c0 oligo-S-Gal-b-CD] complexes is due to an effect of the S-Gal-b-CD itself.\n\nFrom these results it might be concluded that the complexation of the oligonucleotide with the cyclodextrins protect the O \u00c0 oligo from its degradation by the nucleases perhaps by protecting the phosphodiester group. Cellular uptake studies recently reported that the\u00afuorescent intensity of (FITC)conjugated phosphorothioate oligonucleotides was greatly increased when the oligonucleotide was complexed with cyclodextrin derivatives, indicating that complexation increases cellular uptake [65] . In our case it might be expected that the chemical modi\u00aecation of the native b-CD by substitution of the hydroxyl of the primary alcohol of one glucose unit on the ring with a thiogalactose residue improves the cellular uptake of the O \u00c0 oligo by a ligand-carbohydrate cell receptors interaction. As the surface of numerous normal and malignant eukaryotic cells are covered with galactose-speci\u00aec lectins, galactose-substituted b-CD might be used as drug carriers for targeting oligonucleotides in vivo. Another possibility which may also contribute to the enhancement of the antiviral activity of O \u00c0 oligo complexed to cyclodextrin is that the complexation could modify the intracellular distribution of the antisense oligonucleotide. Probably oligonucleotide-cyclodextrin complexes enter the cells by a process different from endocytosis pathway in which the oligonucleotides may be trapped within endosomal or lysosomal vesicles. Further studies have to be achieved to study the intracellular distribution of oligonucleotide after treatment with [oligonucleotide-cyclodextrin] complexes and to elucidate the mechanism of the interaction between the oligodeoxynucleotide and cyclodextrin."}
