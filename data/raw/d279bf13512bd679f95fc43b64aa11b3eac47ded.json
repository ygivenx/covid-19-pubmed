{"title": "Mental Well-Being of International Migrants to Japan: a Systematic 2", "body": "Results Fifty-five studies (23 published in English), surveying a total of 8649 migrants, 40 were identified. The most commonly studied migrant nationalities were Brazilian (36%), 41 followed by Chinese (27%) and Filipino (8%). Thematic analysis of barriers to mental well-42 being among migrants chiefly identified \"language difficulties\", \"being female\" and \"lack 43 of social support\", whereas the primary facilitators were \"social networks\" followed by Global migration has increased markedly in recent decades and international migrants now 65 constitute 3.4% of the global population. [1] International migrants are considered to be Article Summary Strengths and limitations of this study \uf0b7 Our study is the first to comprehensively screen and synthesizes available research, published both in Japanese and English, on the mental well-being of international migrants to Japan. \uf0b7 Our study describes contemporary migrant health and social support networks were found to be the key facilitator of mental well-being. \uf0b7 The cross-sectional nature of the included studies limits the value in supporting causal effects and generalizability. \uf0b7 While English and Japanese databases were surveyed, grey literature was not comprehensively searched for relevant titles. institutional health research that includes non-citizens, [11] in Japan, only exploratory 89 research has been conducted on the health of migrants. 90 Facing such a demographic reality, the Japanese government has begun to publicly 91 acknowledge the need for more foreign workers; however, structural issues continue to 92 perturb the humanistic integration of international migrants. For example, a comprehensive 93 2017 survey showed that 30% of foreign residents had experienced discrimination in Japan, 94 with 40% having been rebuffed when seeking housing and 25% had been denied a job due Thematic analysis 235 Many more barriers than facilitators to mental well-being were cited among the included 236 studies and multiple themes were often described in a single study. Among the included studies, the most common barrier was trouble communicating in 240 Japanese as 10 studies described such difficulty as negatively impacting mental health.\n\nThese studies cited language barriers creating stress of managing daily life or trouble 242 making describing symptoms in a medical environment. The next most common barrier 243 was a lack of support, either from teachers,[31] employers, [46, 55] family, [60] or Several included studies found that living in Japan for short periods was a barrier to 296 mental well-being while longer stays were facilitators. For example, Brazilians living in 297 Japan for limited periods for work were found to have a higher prevalence of mental life. [17] Similarly, a study by Tsuda and colleagues showed that Brazilians living in Japan 303 for more than 5 years had fewer mental disorders.\n\n[78] Visa status or stability were not 304 mentioned as a significant factor in mental well-being even among studies including 305 subjects on a variety of visas although broader comparative studies may be warranted. Japanese culture does not accept them causing mental harm. [32, 33] Interestingly, Asakura 323 and colleagues reasoned that Brazilians workers found better Japanese language skills to be 324 associated with experiences of discrimination because workers with language skills could 325 understand their status as an outsider more clearly.\n\n[46] Examination of discrimination 326 among skilled workers versus unskilled workers in Japan has also shown similar 327 findings.\n\n[20] 328 The female gender and religiosity were found to be a barrier and facilitators of 329 mental well-being, respectively. There were 10 studies that found being female to be a however, is support for a comprehensive medical interpretation system for healthcare 345 institutions. [24] 346 A more novel suggestion raised by fewer publications was the importance of 347 transcultural education about diversity or appreciation of different cultural backgrounds. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Studies included (n = 55) 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Give the working title of the review, for example the one used for obtaining funding. Ideally the title should state succinctly the interventions or exposures being reviewed and the associated health or social problems.\n\nWhere appropriate, the title should use the PI(E)COS structure to contain information on the Participants, Intervention (or Exposure) and Comparison groups, the Outcomes to be measured and Study designs to be included.\n\nMental Well-being of International Migrants to Japan: a Systematic Review\n\nFor reviews in languages other than English, this field should be used to enter the title in the language of the review. This will be displayed together with the English language title.\n\n3. * Anticipated or actual start date.\n\nGive the date when the systematic review commenced, or is expected to commence. Indicate the stage of progress of the review by ticking the relevant Started and Completed boxes. Additional information may be added in the free text box provided. Please note: Reviews that have progressed beyond the point of completing data extraction at the time of initial registration are not eligible for inclusion in PROSPERO. Should evidence of incorrect status and/or completion date being supplied at the time of submission come to light, the content of the PROSPERO record will be removed leaving only the title and named contact details and a statement that inaccuracies in the stage of the review date had been identified. This field should be updated when any amendments are made to a published record and on completion and publication of the review. If this field was pre-populated from the initial screening questions then you are not able to edit it until the record is published.\n\nThe review has not yet started: Provide any other relevant information about the stage of the review here (e.g. Funded proposal, protocol not yet finalised).\n\nJournal Submission 6. * Named contact.\n\nThe named contact acts as the guarantor for the accuracy of the information presented in the register record.\n\nEmail salutation (e.g. \"Dr Smith\" or \"Joanne\") for correspondence:\n\nMr. Miller 7. * Named contact email.\n\nGive the electronic mail address of the named contact.\n\nrmiller01@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\nGive the full postal address for the named contact.\n\n113-0034 Tokyo, Bunkyo Yushima 3-12-8, Wellcasa Bunkyo Yushima #1001 9.

List any conditions that could lead to actual or perceived undue influence on judgements concerning the main topic investigated in the review.\n\nGive the name and affiliation of any individuals or organisations who are working on the review but who are not listed as review team members.\n\nState the question(s) to be addressed by the review, clearly and precisely. Review questions may be specific or broad. It may be appropriate to break very broad questions down into a series of related more specific questions. Questions may be framed or refined using PI(E)COS where relevant.\n\nWhat are the mental health issues faced by migrants in Japan? Objective 1: What are the determinants (barriers and facilitators) of mental well-being for migrants in a Japanese context?\n\nObjective 2: Are there any specific differences in mental well-being among migrant status (e.g. low-skilled migrants, highly-skilled immigrants, international students, asylum seekers) or nationality?\n\nObjective 3: Are there areas of improvement that can be addressed by Japanese society?\n\n16. * Searches.\n\nGive details of the sources to be searched, search dates (from and to), and any restrictions (e.g. language or publication period). The full search strategy is not required, but may be supplied as a link or attachment.\n\nA systematic review of the literature, including published reviews, will be undertaken. Studies published between Jan 1st, 2000 and September 30th, 2018 will be identified by searching online databases\n\nPubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science without language restrictions. Japanese databases J-STAGE, Ichushi, UTokyo Resource Explorer (TREE) will also be searched. The reference lists of articles selected for analysis will be hand-searched. Studies of mental health among migrants residing in Japan will be selected for data extraction and \n\nInternational prospective register of systematic reviews conclusions described in these articles will be synthesized into a general analysis. This search will identify studies of migrant populations and including terms related to migrant health in Japan within the title, article or abstract.\n\nThree central concepts (in English and Japanese) will be used in combination to guide this search with relevant search terms:\n\n1) Mental Health Status: \"mental health\" OR \"psychology\" OR \"mental well-being\".\n\n2) Migrants: \"migrant\" OR \"immigrant\" OR \"expatriate\" OR \"foreigner\" OR \"refugee\" OR \"foreign national\" OR \"international student\".\n\n3) Location: \"Japan\".\n\nAdditional search strategy information can be found in the attached PDF document (link provided below).\n\nGive a link to a published pdf/word document detailing either the search strategy or an example of a search strategy for a specific database if available (including the keywords that will be used in the search strategies), or upload your search strategy.Do NOT provide links to your search results.\n\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPEROFILES/108421_STRATEGY_20181002.pdf Alternatively, upload your search strategy to CRD in pdf format. Please note that by doing so you are consenting to the file being made publicly accessible.\n\nYes I give permission for this file to be made publicly available 18. * Condition or domain being studied.\n\nGive a short description of the disease, condition or healthcare domain being studied. This could include health and wellbeing outcomes.\n\nPre-and post-migratory barriers or facilitators of mental well-being for migrants residing in Japan.\n\nThe migrant community in Japan is an ethnically diverse group but, as a whole, represents the largest minority in the country. Since the turn of the century more and more studies have examined the health of these migrants as a unique case for cross-cultural study. Disparate research has focused on the mental health of specific migrant sub-populations. Regrettably, this body of literature is currently not very rich, underscoring the value of a systematic review synthesize the literature into a more comprehensive representation of migrant mental health and well-being in Japan.\n\nHere we discuss the determinants of mental well-being, defined as the barriers to and facilitators of mental health well-being, that are at work both before and after migration among this unique population.\n\nAdditionally, we will examine challenges for the preservation of mental well-being of foreign nationals residing in Japan and how they could be addressed. This review of migrant mental well-being may serve as a barometer of Japan's preparedness for proper integration of this increasingly vital and populous cohort.\n\nThis systematic review represents a timely addition to the growing Global Health discipline of migrant health. Give summary criteria for the participants or populations being studied by the review. The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nMigrants defined as: persons of non-Japanese nationality residing in Japan for more than three months (eligible for National Health Insurance scheme).\n\n20. * Intervention(s), exposure(s).\n\nGive full and clear descriptions or definitions of the nature of the interventions or the exposures to be reviewed.\n\nExposure: residence in Japan.\n\nObservation: assessment of mental health status.\n\n21. * Comparator(s)/control.\n\nWhere relevant, give details of the alternatives against which the main subject/topic of the review will be compared (e.g. another intervention or a non-exposed control group). The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n22. * Types of study to be included.\n\nGive details of the types of study (study designs) eligible for inclusion in the review. If there are no restrictions on the types of study design eligible for inclusion, or certain study types are excluded, this should be stated. The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nOriginal research in English and Japanese of all study designs will be included such as randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, observational studies, cross-sectional studies, systematic reviews and other comparative studies as well as multiple cases studies and evaluation reports. Conference abstracts or papers will not be included.\n\nGive summary details of the setting and other relevant characteristics which help define the inclusion or exclusion criteria.\n\nGlobal migration has been increasing remarkably for the past two decades and international migrants now \n\nGive the pre-specified main (most important) outcomes of the review, including details of how the outcome is defined and measured and when these measurement are made, if these are part of the review inclusion criteria.\n\nPre-migration determinants of mental health and well-being.\n\nPost-migration determinants of mental health and well-being.\n\nPre-and post-migration.\n\nList the pre-specified additional outcomes of the review, with a similar level of detail to that required for main outcomes. Where there are no additional outcomes please state 'None' or 'Not applicable' as appropriate to the review None.\n\nTiming and effect measures 26. * Data extraction (selection and coding).\n\nGive the procedure for selecting studies for the review and extracting data, including the number of researchers involved and how discrepancies will be resolved. List the data to be extracted.\n\nMS Excel will be used for recording search results and the Mendeley referencing platform will be used to manage retrieved articles. MS Excel will again be used for extracted data charting in order to categorize and analyze individual studies. The charting step will involve the documentation of key characteristics and information of the articles being reviewed. Data to be extracted: citation (author, publication year), study location, study design, study population characteristics, sample size, study tools, comparative population, pre-migration barriers or facilitators of mental well-being, post-migration barriers or facilitators of mental well-being, and recommendations based on outcomes.\n\n27. * Risk of bias (quality) assessment.\n\nState whether and how risk of bias will be assessed (including the number of researchers involved and how discrepancies will be resolved), how the quality of individual studies will be assessed, and whether and how this will influence the planned synthesis.\n\nA quality assessment checklist will be created to evaluate the appropriateness of included studies for assessment of mental well-being. The Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies (Wells et al., 2000) will be used as a guide to develop a modified quality assessment tool. \n\nWith our own quality measurement, we will able to see how well the selected studies are equipped to answer our study question, while simultaneously assessing the scope of the literature for any gaps. The quality assessment tool will assess five criteria:\n\n1. Were pre-migration determinants of mental health considered (e.g., medical history, country of origin, socio-economic status, ethnicity, social support)?\n\n2. Were post-migration determinants of mental health considered (e.g., acculturation ability, length of residence, language fluency, cultural fluency, income, social support)?\n\n3. Was there a non-migrant comparison group?\n\n4. Were determinants measured in a valid, standardized manner (survey, psychometric tool or structured interview)?\n\n5. Was the sample size appropriate to measure to address the mental issue being studied?\n\n28. * Strategy for data synthesis.\n\nGive the planned general approach to synthesis, e.g. whether aggregate or individual participant data will be used and whether a quantitative or narrative (descriptive) synthesis is planned. It is acceptable to state that a quantitative synthesis will be used if the included studies are sufficiently homogenous.\n\nThe PRIMSA checklist will be followed for appropriate data synthesis. A PRISMA flowchart will be constructed to reflect the search strategy results at each stage of review.\n\nOur charted data about health outcomes and determinants will be heterogeneous and so will form the basis for analysis using the 'descriptive-analytical method' from the narrative tradition (Arksey and O'Malley, 2005), which involves collecting standard information from each research report and applying a common analytic framework to all included studies. We will not pre-define the way in which the relationships among concepts will be evaluated and we will accept measures of the outcomes based on the study's assessment using either qualitative or quantitative methods.\n\n29. * Analysis of subgroups or subsets.\n\nGive details of any plans for the separate presentation, exploration or analysis of different types of participants (e.g. by age, disease status, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, presence or absence or comorbidities); different types of intervention (e.g. drug dose, presence or absence of particular components of intervention); different settings (e.g. country, acute or primary care sector, professional or family care); or different types of study (e.g. randomised or non-randomised).\n\nSubgroup analysis will be conducted for pre-and post-migration determinants of mental well-being.\n\nSelect the type of review and the review method from the lists below. Select the health area(s) of interest for your review.\n\nType of review Give the name of any organisation where the systematic review title or protocol is registered (such as with The Campbell Collaboration, or The Joanna Briggs Institute) together with any unique identification number assigned. (N.B. Registration details for Cochrane protocols will be automatically entered). If extracted data will be stored and made available through a repository such as the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR), details and a link should be included here. If none, leave blank.\n\n34. Reference and/or URL for published protocol.\n\nGive the citation and link for the published protocol, if there is one\n\nGive the link to the published protocol.\n\nAlternatively, upload your published protocol to CRD in pdf format. Please note that by doing so you are consenting to the file being made publicly accessible.\n\nNo I do not make this file publicly available until the review is complete Please note that the information required in the PROSPERO registration form must be completed in full even if access to a protocol is given.\n\nGive brief details of plans for communicating essential messages from the review to the appropriate audiences.\n\nThe review will be published in an international peer-reviewed journal, yet to be decided.\n\nDo you intend to publish the review on completion? Reporting checklist for systematic review and metaanalysis.\n\nBased on the PRISMA guidelines.\n\nComplete this checklist by entering the page numbers from your manuscript where readers will find each of the items listed below.\n\nYour article may not currently address all the items on the checklist.

If you are certain that an item does not apply, please write \"n/a\" and provide a short explanation.\n\nUpload your completed checklist as an extra file when you submit to a journal.\n\nIn your methods section, say that you used the PRISMA reporting guidelines, and cite them as: Background Migration is a stressful process of resettlement and acculturation that can 25 often negatively impact the mental health of migrants. In Japan, international migration is 26 growing steadily amid an aging domestic population experiencing severe labor shortages.\n\nObjectives To identify the contemporary barriers to, and facilitators of, mental well-being 28 among the migrant population in Japan. being among migrants chiefly identified \"language difficulties\", \"being female\" and \"lack 43 of social support\", whereas the primary facilitators were \"social networks\" followed by \"cultural identity\". Policy recommendations for authorities included more migrant support 45 services and transcultural awareness among the Japanese public.\n\nConclusion Access to social support networks of various types appears to be an influential 47 factor affecting the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan. More research is 48 necessary on how to promote such connections to foster a more inclusive and multicultural 49 Japanese society amid rapid demographic change.

studies) in the search and date last searched. 7 Search 8 Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.\n\nStudy selection 9 State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).\n\n8 Data collection process 10 Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.\n\nData items 11 List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.\n\nRisk of bias in individual studies 12 Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.\n\nSummary measures 13 State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).\n\nSynthesis of results 14 Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I 2 ) for each meta-analysis. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35
