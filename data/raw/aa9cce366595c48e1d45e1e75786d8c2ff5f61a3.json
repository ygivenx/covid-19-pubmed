{"title": "The Role of Viral Respiratory Infections in Asthma and Asthma Exacerbations What are the concerns with viral respiratory infections and asthma?", "body": "Viral respiratory tract infections can have profound effects on important aspects of asthma1 ( Figure 1 ). In early life, many children have wheezing episodes associated with respiratory infections. The infections associated with these wheezing events are multiple and include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and other viruses. For most infants, wheezing episodes with respiratory infections diminish as the child ages, but for some individuals, early-life wheezing episodes may mark the beginning of asthma.\n\nIn contrast to studies linking early life infections with subsequent respiratory morbidity, the hygiene hypothesis proposed that infections, including respiratory infections in early life, were protective towards the eventual development of allergic diseases and possibly asthma. 2 , 3 These associations are supported by observations showing a lower prevalence of allergies and asthma in children in daycare or those with older siblings.2 , 3 It was proposed that the protective effect in these environments related to more frequent infections, including those caused by respiratory viruses, and a subsequent stimulation of protective, i.e. Th1, immunity. More recent studies suggest that exposure to nonpathogenic microbes may be more important in directing healthy immune development and reducing the risk of allergic diseases.4\n\nRespiratory viral infections can also have a significant influence on those patients with established asthma, where viral respiratory infections are found in association with asthma exacerbations in nearly 80% of these episodes. 5 -9 The association between viral respiratory infections and asthma exacerbations is seen both in children and adults. In contrast, it is less clearly determined whether respiratory infections determine disease progression or its eventual severity. 10 From these observations, it is apparent that viral respiratory infections may have profound effects on many aspects of asthma. The following review will focus on the role of viral respiratory infections on the expression of asthma in early life as well as their contributions to exacerbations.\n\nWheezing illnesses are closely associated with viral respiratory infections in patients of all ages. 5 -7 , 11 , 12 The association of wheezing episodes with respiratory infections in early life has also provided an opportunity to determine the potential relationship of these events to the eventual development of asthma. This association has been best studied with RSV and HRV respiratory infections.\n\nIn infants, RSV bronchiolitis has many similarities to acute asthma: wheezing, rapid breathing, small airway inflammation, and, in some children, respiratory compromise.11 About a third of children with an initial wheezing episode with bronchiolitis will experience recurrent episodes of wheezing.12 This association has prompted speculation that severe episodes of RSV bronchiolitis in infancy initiate the development of asthma.\n\nTo illustrate, Sigurs and colleagues13 explored whether a relationship existed between an RSV infection sufficient to cause hospitalization and a possible linkage to the eventual development of asthma. Beginning in 1989, these investigators identified 52 infants who were hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis and followed them to age 13 years. The hospitalized children were matched with 93 subjects of similar birth date and sex who had not been hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis. When the children were 7 \u00bd years old, those with both a family history of asthma and bronchiolitis had high rates of asthma (38%) compared with those with only one of these two variables, i.e., family history of allergy/ asthma or RSV bronchiolitis alone. The data of Sigurs et al.13 suggest that severe RSV infections together with a family history of asthma increase the likelihood of asthma developing.\n\nThese findings fit well with the concept that a gene (family history of asthma)-byenvironment (RSV bronchiolitis) interaction is necessary for the expression of disease and are supported by a more recent study of a large epidemiologic study conducted in Tennessee.14 The investigators found infants who were born approximately 120 days before the peak of RSV season had the highest rate of hospitalization for wheezing illnesses. Additional follow-up revealed that the timing of birth date with respect to the peak of the winter bronchiolitis season was also related to the risk of developing asthma. These findings suggest that infants who are at highest risk for severe viral bronchiolitis are also most likely to go on to develop asthma. Moreover, these findings suggest that several viral wheezing illnesses in infancy contribute to subsequent asthma. Finally, at least two prospective birth cohort studies have also documented the association of early life wheezing illnesses due to RSV and the subsequent expression of persistent wheezing and asthma as the children enter school. 15 , 16 The positive relationship of RSV infections to asthma has not, however, been seen in all investigations. For example, longitudinal data from Tucson Children's Respiratory Study reported RSV lower respiratory tract infections before three years of age were associated with subsequent wheezing and asthma in early childhood, but not beyond age 11 years.17 Furthermore, Thomsen and colleagues evaluated the relationship between RSV hospitalization and asthma using a large twin registry in Denmark. 18 This analysis led to the conclusion that severe RSV infections did not cause asthma, but instead, a common genetic predisposition to both RSV bronchiolitis and asthma exists. In considering these conflicting findings, a resolution of this debate will likely require a randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study to prevent RSV infection during infancy to more fully address this question.\n\nHRV are the cause of the common cold and the most frequent viral pathogens found in respiratory tract infections, but may not be limited to the upper airway. Recent observations in a number of countries have also implicated HRV infections as the cause of bronchiolitis that results in respiratory compromise severe enough to warrant hospitalization. 19 , 20 Possibly because this respiratory virus can infect the lower airway, its role and contribution of HRV to asthma is assuming a far more important role.21\n\nMany other factors have led to an expanded appreciation of HRV in asthma. First, molecular techniques are now available to detect HRV in respiratory secretions.22 , 23 This technique is highly sensitive and specific as well as having the capacity to use secretions obtained with noninvasive techniques, such as a \"nose blow\" into a plastic bag.24 Second, PCR methods are capable of detecting small amounts of virus which may not be accounted for by culture. Third, when HRV, or other viruses, are detected, the viral load can be quantitated. Finally, it has now become possible to differentiate the multiple HRV stains and, as will be discussed later, this has led to the discovery of a new species of HRV, which might have considerable relevance to wheezing illnesses and asthma. 24 -26 To more precisely study and identify the role of respiratory viruses in the development of asthma, Lemanske et al. established a birth cohort of children who are at high risk for asthma.27 These children had at least one parent with asthma or allergic disease. The COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma) study was formed in 1998, with 289 children enrolled between 1998 and 2000. Nasal washes were obtained at well child visits as well as with respiratory infections over the first year of life ( Figure 2 ). For the next five years, nasal lavage specimens were collected with symptomatic respiratory illnesses. At three years of age, the investigators evaluated the frequency of persistent wheezing.28 Then at six years of age, the 259 children remaining in the study were evaluated for asthma.15 From this study design, the investigators have been able to determine associations of respiratory illnesses with early life wheezing and the eventual development of asthma.\n\nThe diagnosis of asthma in the COAST study was determined independently by four clinician investigators, in a blinded fashion and based upon fulfilling a number of prescribed clinical criteria: physician diagnosis of asthma; frequent albuterol or asthma-controller medication use; a step-up plan during illness; and/or oral prednisone use for an asthma exacerbation.15 Based upon these pre-study criteria, 28% (73/259) of these children were considered to have asthma at six years of age.\n\nIn the first three years of the COAST study, 454 wheezing respiratory illnesses were documented and nasal specimens were obtained during 97% of these episodes. In 90% of specimens obtained, a viral etiology was identified. HRV was found in 48% of the samples and RSV in 21% of the specimens. In the 73 children identified with asthma, there was a distribution of disease severity: 48% had intermittent asthma; 34% had mild persistent asthma; and 18% had moderate persistent asthma.\n\nWith information available on the detection of a respiratory virus with wheezing illnesses, Jackson, et al. 15 was able to determine the risk factors associated with HRV and RSV associated wheezing during the first three years of life to the eventual diagnosis of asthma. They have reported that the risk for the diagnosis of asthma at six years of life was significantly greater if wheezing with either HRV or RSV had been noted at three years of age compared to wheezing which had occurred only during the first year of life alone. Jackson et al.15 found a 2.6 (CI, 1.0, 6.3) odds ratio (OR) for asthma at age six years if the child wheezed with a RSV infection during the first three years of life. In contrast, when wheezing during this time frame occurred with HRV, the OR increased to 9.8 (CI, 4.3, 22.0). There was no additive risk when both HRV and RSV were found ( Figure 3 ).\n\nJackson et al. also evaluated the relationship between allergic sensitization, RV wheezing and development of asthma in the COAST population (Table 1) . 15 Aeroallergen sensitization without RV wheezing in the first year of life and RV wheezing without sensitization were each associated with increased risks for asthma at six years of age. Infants with both sensitization and RV wheezing had the highest incidence of asthma. There was no additive effect to RV wheezing in the first year of life by aeroallergen sensitization. When these comparisons were made in the third year of life, RV wheezing had the more dominant effect on asthma risk (OR 25.6 [CI, 8.2, 79.6]) compared to the still significant but relatively small influence of aeroallergen sensitization (OR 3.4 [CI, 7.7, 6.9]). Again, there was no evidence that aeroallergen sensitization at age 3 years modified the relationship between RV wheezing illnesses and asthma development at six years of age. Therefore, during the early years of life, HRV respiratory infections appear to be the dominant risk factor associated with the diagnosis of asthma at age six years.\n\nOther longitudinal studies find the same apparent independent yet complementary effects for allergic sensitization and viral respiratory infections in early childhood. 16 Kusel et al. 16 found the risk for asthma to be nearly doubled at six years of age when sensitization to common aeroallergens was found. In contrast, the risk for asthma was increased four-fold if greater than two respiratory infections with wheezing had occurred during this time period. Finally, when the Australian group evaluated the impact of both allergic sensitization and wheezing with a respiratory infection, the risk for asthma was increased approximately ninefold. Therefore, although wheezing episodes with a respiratory infection and allergic sensitization are independent risk factors for asthma, the combined effect was synergistic in this study.\n\nCollectively, these studies implicate viral wheezing respiratory tract illnesses in the initial clinical expression of persistent wheezing and ultimately many cases of childhood asthma. The virus that has been confirmed to contribute most to these developments is HRV. This raises the obvious question: do HRV cause asthma? Since HRV infections are so common in the general population, this seems unlikely. These observations suggest several hypotheses relating more severe HRV illnesses to recurrent wheezing and asthma. First, it is conceivable that asthma is fundamentally associated with dysfunctional antiviral immune responses, such as deficient production of interferons.29 , 30 Second, there may be environmental factors (e.g. tobacco smoke exposure) that promote more severe HRV illnesses, recurrent wheezing, and ultimately asthma. Finally, certain viral strains could be more pathogenic or \"asthmagenic\" in affected individuals. These explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive and will be discussed subsequently.\n\nThe other factor in the development of asthma that is of obvious and critical interest is the genetic influence on this relationship.31 At present, there are limited data, especially as to the relationship of HRV and the eventual development of asthma.32 -35 This area of research is an essential next step to more comprehensively understand why some individuals develop recurrent wheezing or asthma following viral respiratory infections, and what factors regulate these interactions. The ultimate interaction and balance between host risk factors, respiratory viruses, and allergen sensitization is an area of intense research.\n\nAsthma exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity for patients of all ages. Over the past 25 years, there have been major advances in this area as well, which are leading to a greater understanding of many aspects of asthma exacerbations; a more precise identification of the associated infectious etiologies the frequency of viral respiratory infections with exacerbations, host-dependent risk factors, and an appreciation of the synergistic role of respiratory viruses and the atopic state.\n\nFor decades, there was a suspicion that respiratory infections were the major cause of asthma exacerbations. Although early efforts had considered bacterial infections as a cause of these asthma attacks, there was little evidence to support a role for bacteria in this relationship. Prior to the development of PCR technology, the etiology of respiratory infections associated with exacerbations was established by cultures, which are difficult to perform and often did not support HRV growth. Despite studies suggesting that HRVs were the primary respiratory infection provoking asthma, the associations of exacerbations to a respiratory infection, including HRV, were less than 50% of the cases.36\n\nWith the development of PCR technology, the detection of an expanded number of respiratory viruses was possible, and the methods had a high degree of sensitivity and specificity but were not necessarily quantitative. In 1995, Johnston and his colleagues5 recruited 108 children who were 9 to 11 years of age and had asthma. They were followed closely over a 13 month period and evaluated at the onset of a respiratory tract infection or with asthma worsening. Respiratory tract samples were obtained and evaluated using PCRbased viral diagnostics. In this group of children, viral respiratory tract infections were detected in association with 85% of the asthma exacerbations. Nearly two-thirds of the detected infections were related to HRV. Similar associations between asthma exacerbations and viral respiratory tract infections, particularly HRV, have also been found in adults. 8 , 9 Thus, with the development and application of PCR assessment, a more precise identification of respiratory viruses found in association with asthma exacerbation has followed and focused research primarily on the role and contribution of HRV. This striking association was pivotal in bringing HRV to the center stage of research in asthma.\n\nA major remaining, and still unresolved question, is a determination of how, and under what conditions, a respiratory infection may provoke asthma. The interaction between the host and the infectious agent is complex and influenced by many factors (Figure 4) including the infectious agent (the seed) and the host (the soil), which represent components of the geneby-environment interactions in these processes.\n\nMore pathogenic strains of several respiratory viruses, including influenza and RSV, have been identified, and it seems likely that more pathogenic strains of HRV will also be identified. This will be more of a challenge, given the large number of HRV strains. There are 99 serotypes of HRV based on growth in tissue culture and inhibition by specific antisera, and these are classified into \"A\" and \"B\" groups based on genetic analysis and responses to certain antiviral medications. In addition, studies using molecular diagnostics have demonstrated up to 50 additional strains of HRV.26 , 37 -45 Most, but not all, of these newly identified HRV belong to the newly discovered HRV-C group.25 Like a number of other \"new\" respiratory viruses, HRV-C does not grow readily in standard tissue culture, and was discovered only after the application of molecular diagnostics. Analysis of a limited number of full-length genomes suggests that HRV-C probably binds to unique cellular receptors.25 More definitive information awaits the development of tissue culture systems for HRV-C.\n\nThe clinical significance of the new HRV-C strains is also the subject of intense study. These viruses are often detected in wheezing children, including hospitalized patients,26 and there is one report of a systemic infection with HRV-C.46 HRV epidemiology in this relationship is complex as around 20 strains of HRV circulate through a community during a single season. Furthermore, the prevailing HRV strains change almost completely each season. Given these complex epidemiology patterns and the large number of HRV strains, long-term population-based studies will be required to define the relative virulence of HRV-C. If there are more virulent strains of HRV, this could open the door to focused preventive efforts such as vaccination for children with asthma and other at-risk populations.\n\nSusceptibility to infection-There is little evidence that asthma patients have more colds than normal individuals.47 , 48 However, in a prospective study of cold transmission, couples were identified where one partner had asthma and the other did not. 49 The investigators found colds caused a greater duration of illness and severity of lower respiratory symptoms in asthma subjects. These findings suggest that the response, but perhaps not the frequency, to a cold may be different in some asthma patients. Extending on these observations, Olenec, et al.24 sampled nasal secretions on a weekly basis from a group of children with asthma and found that the relationship between infection and resulting illness varied with the presence of allergic sensitization. Infection caused upper and lower respiratory symptoms that were of greater duration and severity in children with allergic asthma vs. nonallergic asthma. Furthermore, viral infections were more likely to cause a loss of asthma control in children with allergic asthma. Finally, children with nonallergic asthma had twice the rate of asymptomatic infection. These findings provide evidence that both allergy and asthma are associated with greater illness upon infection with respiratory viruses.\n\nThe possibility that abnormalities in anti-viral activity in asthma exist has been evaluated by a number of investigators by measuring virus-induced cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For example, HRV-induced interferon-\u03b3 responses were found to be inversely related to viral shedding.50 Interestingly, there is evidence that mononuclear cell production of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 may be impaired in asthma,51 and HRV-induced IFN-\u03b3 responses in subjects with asthma are positively associated with measures of pulmonary function.52 Furthermore, in airway sputum cells, a more dominant Th-1 response (ratio of interferon-\u03b3/IL-5 mRNA), was associated with milder colds and a more rapid clearance of the virus.53\n\nIn addition to these differences in mononuclear cell and sputum cell interferon responses, there is evidence that epithelial cell interferon responses may also be diminished in asthma. In the first series of experiments, Wark et al.29 used bronchoscopy to obtain bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) for culture from normal and asthmatic subjects. The use of BEC is highly relevant as these cells are the primary site for a HRV infection in the lower airway. Using this model, Wark et al.29 found HRV-16 replication was increased and interferon-\u03b2 responses to this virus were diminished in BEC from asthmatic patients ( Figure 5 ). The addition of interferon-\u03b2 to the HRV BEC cultures from asthmatic subjects reduced virus replication. Paralleling these observations with interferon-\u03b2, Contoli et al. 30 found decreased interferon-\u03bb responses in bronchoalveolar airway cells from the same asthmatic subjects. In addition, after experimental inoculation with HRV-16, the fall in lung function, i.e. forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), was inversely proportional to interferon-\u03bb generation previously noted ( Figure 6 ). These data suggest that airway cells in some asthma patients have defective anti-viral responses as reflected by a reduced generation of interferons to HRV-16.\n\nNot all investigations support this conclusion, and two recent studies were unable to confirm that epithelial cell interferon responses were deficient in asthma.54 , 55 Moreover, to date studies of experimentally inoculated volunteers have found no significant differences in HRV shedding related to asthma.56 -58 Many factors can contribute to these differences in observations, particularly the severity of asthma under study. Consequently, additional studies of patients with asthma and naturally acquired colds will be needed to resolve these differences.\n\nThe mechanisms that contribute to and lead to changes in lower airway inflammation and altered pulmonary physiology with respiratory infections also remain poorly understood. To begin to address these questions, Message et al.58 evaluated these responses to an experimental HRV infection in asthmatic and normal subjects. HRV infection induced similar colds in both groups, but significantly greater lower respiratory symptoms and lung function impairment as well as increases in bronchial hyperreactivity and eosinophilic lower airway inflammation occurred in asthmatic compared with normal subjects. In asthmatic, but not normal, subjects, the virus load was significantly related to lower respiratory symptoms, bronchial hyperreactivity, and reductions in blood total and CD8(+) lymphocytes; lung function impairment was significantly related to neutrophilic and eosinophilic lower airway inflammation. The same virologic and clinical outcomes were strongly related to deficient IFN-gamma and IL-10 responses and to augmented IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 responses. The augmented generation of the Th2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, suggests a possible link, or risk factor, between allergic sensitization and susceptibility to HRV infection.\n\nInteractions between Allergy and Viral Respiratory Infection-One of the most consistent findings in clinical studies of asthma is that allergy and viral infections synergistically increase the risk for acute exacerbations. For example, Heymann and co-workers7 evaluated the presence of viral respiratory tract infections among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and the relationship of the patient's atopic status to the asthma admission. In children 3 to 18 years of age, there was a distinct seasonal pattern with a greater percentage of children admitted between September and November. For the children three years and older, HRV was the predominant respiratory virus detected in those hospitalized for wheezing (61% vs. 21% in control subjects). In addition, the wheezing children had substantially and significantly higher serum IgE values compared to control subjects (geometric means, 386 IU/ml vs. 38 IU/ml), and 84% of the children with wheezing were sensitized to at least one aeroallergen in their test panel. These data suggest that allergic sensitization, at least of children, is an important risk factor for wheezing with a HRV infection, and IgE-dependent responses may also contribute to the development of wheezing with a cold. Additional studies in children and adults indicate that allergic individuals who are exposed to allergens have the highest risk for virus-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. 59 , 60 In addition, Johnston and Sears61 , 62 have been instrumental in recognizing and describing the September epidemics of asthma which occur with regularity in the Northern Hemisphere and how these events may provide novel insights into both host and environmental factors which lead to asthma exacerbations. In Canada, the sharp increases in emergency department visits for acute asthma and hospitalizations for childhood asthma have been predictable year-to-year As these investigators point out, aeroallergens, air pollution, and interactions with climate can affect asthma exacerbations. To test the hypothesis that the return to school and subsequent asthma exacerbations were related to viral respiratory infections, children presenting to an emergency department (ED) in Canada during three weeks in September along with community-recruited children with equally severe asthma who did not require acute care were evaluated.61 For 62% of the ED cases with asthma, a respiratory virus was identified by PCR detection methods compared to 42% of the asthma controls. Detection of respiratory viruses this frequently during September likely reflects the commonness of this virus at this time of the year; however, only a portion of those with the virus went on to wheeze. As the authors note, the beginning of the school term is often associated with higher stress levels and increased concentrations of aeroallergens in the environment. They go on to conclude, \"Although a viral infection may be the immediate trigger for an asthma exacerbation, it is likely that these factors act together to bring about the September epidemic.\"\n\nThese clinical observations have led to a number of theories to explain how respiratory viruses interact with allergic inflammation to cause wheezing illnesses. Both viral infections and allergic inflammation can damage airway epithelium, and this could lead to synergistic effects. On one hand, viral infections compromise the barrier function of the airway epithelium, and could lead to enhanced absorption of allergens and/or irritants across the airway wall and increased allergic inflammation.63 Alternatively, HRV replication in vitro is greater in damaged epithelium, and this implies that allergen-induced damages to airway epithelium could promote greater viral replication and more severe clinical illness. 64 , 65 This concept could also apply to pollutants, and explain why exposure to toxic agents (e.g. tobacco smoke, NO2) also increases the risk of viral wheeze.66 , 67 In addition,, airway epithelium in asthma has distinct features, including increased numbers of mucus-secreting goblet cells; interestingly, there is laboratory evidence that HRV replication is enhanced in these cells.68\n\nRecent mechanistic studies have provided evidence of antagonistic relationships between allergic inflammation and antiviral immunity. For example, allergic inflammation can inhibit innate immune interferon responses under some conditions. 69 Gill and colleagues70 suggest that cross linking or engagement of IgE receptors on peripheral blood dendritic cells, a major contributor to innate immune host defense pathways, leads to inhibition of virus-induced interferon-\u03b1 secretion.70 Dendritic cells can also play a key role in allergic sensitization, by directing the development of na\u00efve T cells into T-helper (Th)1 vs. Th2 cells; the latter secrete cytokines that lead to IgE production (IL-4, IL-13) and eosinophilic inflammation (IL-5). Notably, both HRV infection and allergic inflammation induce epithelial cells to secrete thymic stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP), a cytokine that can act on dendritic cells and others to promote Th2 differentiation thereby enhancing allergic inflammation.71 Finally, animal models suggest that biased innate immune responses to respiratory viruses in early life may establish overproduction of key cytokines such as IL-13, leading to suboptimal antiviral responses, increased risk for respiratory allergies, and changes in airway structure to promote asthma.72\n\nFinally, in an elaborate set of studies, Subrata and coworkers in Australia73 evaluated the hypothesis, that underlying interactions between immunoinflammatory pathways related to aeroallergen exposure and respiratory viruses are involved in determining, and defining, severe asthma exacerbations in children. To accomplish this goal, 67 children were recruited at the time of emergency treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation. Postnasal aspirates were obtained along with blood samples for microarray assays of cells during the acute and convalescent period and analyses of leukocyte phenotypic features by flow cytometry was performed. Eighty-percent of the children had a respiratory virus detected with HRV accounting for 95% of the infections. Circulating lymphocytes were decreased whereas monocyte/dendritic cell populations displayed an up-regulated CCR2 expression and enhanced potential to provoke inflammation when recruited to the lung. These cells also had an up-regulated expression of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 with a concomitant gene expression signature that is representative of the IL-4/IL-13-dependent \"alternatively activated\" phenotype. Together with studies conducted in a rodent model of respiratory virus infection,72 these findings implicate specific components of the innate antiviral response including dendritic cells, alternatively-activated macrophages, and NK T cells, in the pathogenesis of virus-induced wheeze and asthma. Thus, underlying allergic disease appears to be either a risk factor for wheezing with a cold or may \"lay the ground work\" for the respiratory virus to interact with airway epithelium and set into motion the processes leading to an asthma exacerbation. Determining these interactive events promises to provide insight not only to mechanisms of respiratory virus provoked asthma, but also clues to more effective treatment.\n\nThere is strong, reproducible data that respiratory viruses, particularly HRV, are associated and likely important in the development and exacerbation of asthma. What has also emerged over the past two decades is a greater understanding and appreciation of the complexity of this relationship in terms of altered anti-viral responses in asthma and the possibility that newly recognized HRV groups are important to this process. Many questions remain including the patterns of inflammation that arise from respiratory viruses, the mechanisms of airway dysfunction, and the multiple genes, or gene products, that regulate these processes. Answering these questions will be an important step forward towards a greater understanding of asthma pathogenesis and more effective treatments.\n\nInfections in early life can be \"inducers\" of wheezing or \"protectors\" against the development of allergic disease. The \"hygiene\" hypothesis has proposed that, for some infants, frequent, early life infections may protect against asthma. For at risk infants, i.e. offspring of parents with asthma or allergy, viral respiratory infections can provoke wheezing in early life which may \"induce,\" or be associated with the later development of asthma. In this march to asthma, allergic sensitization occurs in the toddler age and become an additional risk factor for asthma. In asthma, viral respiratory infections also contribute significantly to exacerbations. The role of infection in the development of persistence of disease or severity has yet to be established. What factors determine if a respiratory infection provokes asthma? Two major factors, the \"seed\" and the \"soil\" contribute to the patient's susceptibility to an infection and subsequent wheezing. The \"seed\" risks relate to the infectious agent. The \"soil\" represents the multiple patient risk factors including the underlying inflammation and their immune response. It is proposed that it is the collective interaction between the \"seed\" and the \"soil\" which determines the outcome with infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells were obtained from normal (\u25a1) and asthma subjects (\u25a0). The generation of interferon-\u03bb in response to RV-16 was determined. Following the determination of interferon generation, the subjects were experimentally inoculated with RV-16 and changes in lung function, FEV 1 , were made during the respiratory infections.
