{"title": "", "body": "HeLa-Vector or -IFITM3 cells stably transduced with RAB7-red fluorescence protein (RFP, red) were incubated with a mixture of both yellow (pH-sensitive, green) and blue (pH-insensitive, blue) dye-labeled dextrans with or without pretreatment with AmphoB.\n\nValues represent the average ratios of pH-sensitive dextran signal to pH-insensitive dextran signal in the RAB7 compartment for three independent experiments +/-SD. pQCXIP-IFITM3 for transducing A549 and HeLa cells were described previously (Feeley et al., 2011) . The IFITM3 alanine scan (AS) mutants, 109AS, 115AS, and 121AS, spanning IM2 each contain six sequential residues changed to alanine and were expressed using the pQCXIP vector as previously described (John et al., 2013) ; however, we note that 115AS was previously reported by us to be unable to be expressed (John et al., 2013) , however a more concerted effort in this current work was able to produce a cell line stably expressing the 115AS protein. Human RAB7 was cloned in frame with RFP and expressed from the lentiviral vector pLVX-puromycin Pseudoparticles were produced using the noted envelopes as previously described (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011) Small "}
