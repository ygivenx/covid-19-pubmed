{"title": "2\u2032-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members", "body": "WNV-WT and WNV-E218A were propagated in BHK21 cells as described 8. VACV-WT and VACV-J3-K175R 22 (gift of R. Condit) and EMCV (strain K) were propagated in HeLa and L929 cells, respectively. Generation of MHV-WT (strain A59) and MHV-D130A recombinant coronaviruses has been described 25.\n\nC57BL/6 wild type and immunodeficient (IFN\u03b1\u03b2R-/-, IFIT-1-/-, IRF-3-/-, IRF-7-/-, IRF-3-/- \u00d7 IRF-7-/-, and IPS-1-/-) mice were bred at Washington University. Infection experiments were performed with approval of the Washington University and Saint Louis University Animal Studies Committees. Viral titers in blood and organs were quantified as previously described 11.\n\nBone marrow derived M\u03d5 and MEF were generated as described 11. 3T3 fibroblasts expressing GFP or ISG were previously described 18. Cells were infected with WNV, VACV, MHV, or EMCV at MOI of 0.01, 1, 1, and 0.001, respectively. Lysates or supernatants were titered by plaque assay on BHK21-15 cells for WNV and EMCV, BSC-1 cells for VACV, and L929 cells for MHV.\n\nIFN-\u03b1\u03b2R-/- MEF were infected at an MOI of 10 with WNV-WT or WNV-E218A. Total RNA was isolated, treated with DNAse (Qiagen), and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA were amplified by qRT-PCR as described previously 11.\n\nIPS-1-/- MEF were pre-treated with increasing doses of mouse IFN-\u03b2 (PBL Laboratories) for 24 h and then infected with WNV or MHV at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants were harvested at 48 or 12 h post infection, respectively, and titered by plaque assay.\n\nQuantitation of positive and negative strand WNV RNA was performed using a T7-tagged primer strategy 26. Fibroblasts expressing GFP or mouse IFIT-2 were infected with WNV-WT or WNV-E218A at an MOI of 1 and total RNA was harvested at indicated time points."}
