{"title": "Dynamics of a novel nonlinear SIR model with double epidemic hypothesis and impulsive effects", "body": "In real world, there are two epidemics, one epidemic caused by virus A and another epidemic caused by virus B. The most likely origin of virus A is a mutation or recombination event from virus B [1] . Also, it has been observed by scientists about possibilities where viruses A and B are of different origins but would cause an overlapping immune response of the host. Both epidemics spread in parallel, and the epidemic caused by virus B, which is rather innocuous, protects against epidemic A. The SIR infections disease model is an important biologic model and has been studied by many authors [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . It is well known that one of the strategies to control infectious diseases is vaccination. Then a number of epidemic models in ecology can be formulated as dynamical systems of differential equations with vaccination [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Systems with sudden perturbations lead to impulsive differential equations, which have been studied intensively and systematically in [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . It is very important that one investigates under what conditions a given agent can invade partially vaccinated population, i.e., how large a fraction of the population do we have to keep vaccinated in order to prevent the agent from establishing.\n\nPulse vaccination seems more reasonable than traditional continuous constant vaccination in real world. Pulse vaccination strategy (PVS) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] consists of periodical repetitions of impulsive vaccinations in a population, on all the age cohorts, which is different from the traditional constant vaccination.\n\nA model for the spread of an infectious disease (involving only susceptibles and infective individuals) transmitted by a vector (e.g., mosquitoes) after an incubation time was proposed by Cooke [24] . This is called the phenomena of \"time delay.\" Many authors have directly incorporated time delays in modeling equations, and, as a result, the models take the form of delay differential equations [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .\n\nIn recent years, the research on delay SIR epidemic models with impulsive perturbations is a relevant, but not totally developed, subject in mathematical biology. See [10, 30] and the references therein. However, this is an interesting problem in mathematical biology. Since an adopted incidence form like the \u03b2e \u2212\u03bc\u03c9 S q (t)I (t \u2212 \u03c9) term with time delay in this paper is different from the incidence forms in [10, 30] by use of new computational techniques for impulsive differential equations with delay such as inequality techniques, the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov function, and the classification analysis method on the discussion of permanence of system, which is very different from [10, 30 ].\n\nCooke [24] formulated an SIR model with time delay effect by assuming that the force of infection at time t is given by\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the average number of contacts per infective per day, and \u03c9 > 0 is a fixed time during which the infectious agents develop in the vector and it is only after that time that the infected vector can infect a susceptible human. Recently, Beretta, Takeuchi and Ma [2] [3] [4] [5] \n\nwhich represents an SIR model with epidemics spread via a vector with an incubation time \u03c9. Here, \u03bc is birth and death rate, and r is a daily recovery rate. Of course, \u03b2, \u03bc, r \u2208 R + .\n\nLevin et al. have adopted a nonlinear incidence rate form like\n\nwhich depends on different infective diseases and environments [31, 32] . Of course, p, q \u2208 R + . In this paper, we consider the case where p = 1 and q \u2208 N is positive integer, i.e., \n\n\u2212\u03bcS(t),\n\nis positive integer, and \u03b4 (0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 1) is the proportion of those vaccinated successfully to all of the susceptible. The \u03b2 i e \u2212\u03bc\u03c9 i S q i (t)I (t \u2212 \u03c9 i ) (i = 1, 2) term exhibits more clearly the death of the exposed population within finite incubation times (with \u03c9 i ) than the \u03b2 i S q i (t)I (t \u2212 \u03c9 i ) (i = 1, 2) term. For both systems (2.1) and (2.3), the total population size N(t) =\n\ncan be regarded as a model with constant total population. Hence it is sufficient to consider the first three equations in (2.3) with respect to \u03a9 = {(S,\n\nThe initial condition of (2.3) is given as\n\nFor a biological meaning, we further assume that \u03c6 i (0) > 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that the variable R does not appear in the first three equations of system (2.3); hence we only need to consider the following subsystem of (2.3):\n\nBefore starting our theorem, we give the following lemma.\n\nLemma 2.1 (See [33] ) Consider the following impulse differential inequalities:\n\nwhere p(t), q(t) \u2208 C[R + , R], and d k \u2265 0 and b k are constants. Assume that:\n\nwith lim t\u2192\u221e t k = \u221e; (A 1 ) w \u2208 P C [R + , R], and w(t) is left continuous at t k , k \u2208 N .\n\nThen\n\nLemma 2.2 (Kuang [34] ) Consider the delay differential equation\n\nwhere a, b, \u03c9 are all positive constants, and x(t) > 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c9, 0]: 3 + , and N be the set of nonnegative integers. Denote by f = (f 1 , f 2 , f 3 ) T the map defined by the right-hand side of the anterior three equations of system (2.4). Let V :\n\nt= n\u03c4,\n\nbe the maximal (minimal) solution of the scalar impulsive differential equation\n\nDefinition 3.1 System (2.4) is said to be permanent if there exists a compact region \u03a9 \u2282 intR 3 + such that every solution of system (2.4) with initial conditions \u03c6 eventually enters and remains in region \u03a9.\n\nWe begin the analysis of (2.4) by first demonstrating the existence of an infection-free solution in which infectious individuals are entirely absent from the population permanently, i.e.,\n\nAssuming (3.1), we know that the growth of the susceptible in the time interval n\u03c4 < t \u2264 (n + 1)\u03c4 and give some basic properties of the subsystem of (2.4)\n\nSolving (3.2) between pulses and using the discrete dynamical system determined by a fixed-point theory in Poincar\u00e9 map yields\n\nwhich is a unique globally asymptotically stable positive periodic solution of system (3.2) .\n\nSince the solution of (3.2) is\n\nwe have the following Lemma 3.1. \n\nThen we can choose an \u03b5 > 0 small enough such that\n\nThen we consider the impulse differential inequalities\n\nUsing Lemma 2.1, we have\n\nThus,\n\nThen S(t) \u2264 S(n 1 \u03c4 )e n 1 \u03c4 \u03bc e \u2212\u03bct + 1 \u2212 \u03b4 e \u03bc\u03c4 \u2212 1 + \u03b4 ,\n\nso, there exist a positive integer n 1 and an arbitrarily small positive constant \u03b5 such that for all t \u2265 n 1 \u03c4 ,\n\nFrom (3.7) and from the second and third equations of (2.4), we get that\n\n(3.8)\n\nConsider the following comparison equation: \n\nThen we have z 1 (t) \u2264 S(t), where z 1 (t) is the solution of the following system (3.10) with initial value z 1 (0 + ) = S(0 + ), and z 1 (t) is the unique positive periodic solution of\n\n(3.10) From (3.10) we have that, for n\u03c4 < t \u2264 (n + 1)\u03c4 ,\n\nHence, for any \u03b5 3 > 0, there exists an integer n 2 > n 1 such that\n\nOn the other hand, from the first equation of (2.4) it follows that S (t) \u2264 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bcS(t). By Lemma 2.3, we have S(t) \u2264 S(t). Then, for any above \u03b5 3 > 0, there exists an integer n 3 > n 2 such that\n\nLet \u03b5 1 \u2192 0 and \u03b5 2 \u2192 0. Then from (3.11) and (3.12) it follows that\n\nfor t large enough, which implies that S(t) \u2192 S(t) as t \u2192 \u221e. The proof is completed. (ii) If \u03b2 i e \u2212\u03bc\u03c9 i > r i + \u03bc (i = 1, 2) and \u03b4 > \u03b4 * , or \u03c4 < \u03c4 * , or \u03c9 > \u03c9 * , or q > q * , then the infectionfree periodic solution ( S(t), 0, 0) is globally attractive, where the critical values \u03b4 * , \u03c4 * , \u03c9 * , and q * are listed as follows: 1 ,\n\nFrom the proof of this section, we can easily obtain the following Corollary 3.2.\n\n(i) If R 1 < 1 and R 2 > 1, then the epidemic I A dies out, and the epidemic I B is permanent. (ii) If R 1 > 1 and R 2 < 1, then the epidemic I A is permanent, and the epidemic I B dies out.\n\nDenote\n\nProof Suppose that (S(t), I A (t), I B (t)) is any positive solution of system (2.4). Since R 2 = min{R 3 , R 4 } > 1, we have m * 1 > 0 and m * 2 > 0. In the following, we claim that for any \u03b3 i : 0 < \u03b3 i < 1, i = 1, 2, we have I A (t) > \u03b3 1 m * 1 and I B (t) > \u03b3 2 m * 2 for t large enough. For convenience, we will show this in the following two steps.\n\nStep I. We claim that there exist t 1 , t 2 \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that I A (t 1 ) \u2265 \u03b3 1 m * 1 > 0 and I B (t 2 ) \u2265 \u03b3 2 m * 2 > 0. Otherwise, there will be three cases:\n\nfor all t > 0. We first consider case (i). According to the above assumption, we get\n\n(3.13)\n\nSince R 1 > 1, it is clear that\n\n(3.14)\n\nUsing Lemma 2.2 along with (3.13) and (3.14), we have I A (t) \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, which is a contradiction. Similarly, we can prove that I B (t) \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e in case (ii), which also is a contradiction.\n\nLast, we consider case (iii). For t \u2265 0, we define the differentiable function V (t) by\n\nThen, the derivative of V (t) satisfie\u1e61\n\nThen there exist two positive constants \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 small enough such that\n\nUnder the assumption of case (iii), from the first and fourth equations of system (2.4) we have\n\nUsing Lemma 2.1, we know that there exists T 1 \u2265 t 0 + \u03c9 such that, for t \u2265 T 1 ,\n\nTherefore, for t \u2265 T 1 , inserting (3.17) and (3.18) into (3.15), we hav\u0117\n\nWe show that I A (t) \u2265 I l A and I B (t) \u2265 I l B for all t \u2265 T 1 . Otherwise, there exists a nonnegative constant T 2 such that I A (t) \u2265 I l A and I B (t) \u2265 I l B for t \u2208 [T 1 , T 1 + \u03c9 + T 2 ], I A (T 1 + \u03c9 + T 2 ) = I l A , and I B (T 1 + \u03c9 + T 2 ) = I l B ,\u0130 A (T 1 + \u03c9 + T 2 ) \u2264 0 or\u0130 B (T 1 + \u03c9 + T 2 ) \u2264 0. Thus, inserting (3.18) into the second equation of (2.4), we hav\u0117\n\nwhich is a contradiction to\u0130 A (T 1 + \u03c9 + T 2 ) \u2264 0. Similarly, we can obtain that it also is a contradiction\n\n2 ) q 2 for t large enough. Hence, the claim is proved.\n\nFrom the above three cases we conclude that there exist t 1 , t 2 such that I A (t 1 ) \u2265 \u03b3 1 m * 1 > 0 and I B (t 2 ) \u2265 \u03b3 2 m * 2 > 0.\n\nStep II. In the rest, we are left to consider two cases:\n\n(i) I A (t) \u2265 \u03b3 1 m * 1 and I B (t) \u2265 \u03b3 2 m * 2 for all t large enough; (ii) I A (t) oscillates about \u03b3 1 m * 1 , or I B (t) oscillates about \u03b3 2 m * 2 for all large t. Case (i). Our aim is obtained. Clearly, we only need to consider Case (ii).\n\nCase (ii). If I A (t) oscillates about \u03b3 1 m * 1 , then we will show that I A (t) \u2265 m 1 for all large t, where\n\nThere exist two positive constantst, \u03c8 such that\n\nand I A (t) < \u03b3 1 m * 1 fort < t <t + \u03c8.\n\nSince I A (t) is continuous and ultimately bounded and is not affected by impulses, we conclude that I A (t) is uniformly continuous. Hence there exists a constant T 3 (with 0 < T 3 < \u03c9 1 ) independent of the choice oft such that I A (t) > m * 1 2 for allt \u2264 t \u2264t + T 3 . If \u03c8 \u2264 T 3 , our aim is obtained. If T 3 < \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c9 1 , from the second equation of (2.4) we have that\u0130 A (t) \u2265 \u2212(r 1 + \u03bc)I A (t) fort < t \u2264t + \u03c8. Then we have\n\nIf \u03c8 > \u03c9 1 , then we have that I A (t) \u2265 \u03b3 1 m * 1 e \u2212(r 1 +\u03bc)\u03c9 1 fort < t \u2264t + \u03c9 1 . Then, proceeding exactly as in the proof of the above claim, we can show that I A (t) \u2265 \u03b3 1 m * 1 e \u2212(r 1 +\u03bc)\u03c9 1 fort + \u03c9 1 \u2264 t \u2264t + \u03c8. In fact, if not, there exists T 4 > 0 such that\n\nWhent is large enough, the inequality S(t) > S \u0394 1 holds fort < t <t + \u03c8 . On the other hand, we have from the second equation of (2.4) tha\u1e6b\n\nThis is a contradiction to\u0130 A (t + \u03c9 1 + T 4 ) \u2264 0. Therefore, I A (t) \u2265 m 1 for t \u2208 [t,t + \u03c8]. Since this kind of interval [t,t + \u03c8] is arbitrarily chosen, we get that I A (t) \u2265 m 1 for t large enough in Case (ii). In view of our arguments above, the choice of m 1 is independent of the positive solution of (2.4), which satisfies that I A (t) \u2265 m 1 for sufficiently large t. Similarly, if I B (t) oscillates about \u03b3 2 m * 2 , then we can prove that I B (t) \u2265 m 2 for all large t, where\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.\n\nProof Suppose that (S(t), I A (t), I B (t)) is any positive solution of system (2.4) . From the first and fourth equations of system (2.4) it is easy to see that\n\nwhere \u03b5 is a sufficiently small positive constant. Similarly, using Lemma 2.1 along with (3.19), we have S(t) > m for t large enough. Set\n\nThen \u03a9 is a bounded compact region which has positive distance from coordinate planes. By Theorem 3.2, one obtains that every solution of system (2.4) with initial condition \u03c6 eventually enters and remains in the region \u03a9. This completes the proof.\n\nIf \u03b4 < \u03b4 * , or \u03c4 > \u03c4 * , or r < r * , or q < q * , then system (2.4) is permanent, that is, the disease can generate an endemic, where the critical values \u03b4 * , \u03c4 * , \u03c9 * , and q * are listed as follows: \n\nNote that R 1 \u2192 0 < 1 and R 2 \u2192 0 < 1 as q \u2192 \u221e, which implies that the epidemic disease will die out eventually when nonlinear incidence q is gradually increasing. This is very interesting since nonlinear incidence has a significant effect on the dynamics of epidemic model.\n\nAs an example, let \u03b4 = 0 and I B = 0: then (2.3) becomes the following system without pulse:\n\n(4.1)\n\nAccording to Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, we can deduce the same results for system (4.1) as Ma and Song in [5, 6] .\n\nIn this paper, we introduce time delay (with \u03c9 i , i = 1, 2), pulse vaccination (with \u03b4 and \u03c4 ), and nonlinear incidence (with q i , i = 1, 2) into SIR model and obtain that the latent period of disease, pulse vaccination, and nonlinear incidence can bring effects on infectioneradication and the permanence of epidemic disease. The main results show that a short period of pulsing (with \u03c4 < \u03c4 * ), or a large pulse vaccination rate (with \u03b4 > \u03b4 * ), or a long latent period of the disease (with \u03c9 > \u03c9 * ), or a large nonlinear incidence (with q > q * ) is a sufficient condition for the global attractivity of infection-eradication periodic solution ( S(t), 0, 0); if not, the system becomes permanent. Therefore, we can choose the vaccination period (with \u03c4 ) and increase the proportion (with \u03b4) of those vaccinated successfully to all of the susceptible such that R 1 < 1 in order to prevent the epidemic disease from generating endemic.\n\nWe find that infection caused by viruses A and B can be controlled when R 1 < 1 and R 2 < 1. Since I B competes I A , the milder infection caused by virus B acts like a vaccine against the virus A. Hence, with the help of this study, there is a possibility in the future to develop a vaccination strategy to fight the epidemic I A .\n\nNote that R 1 > R 2 , and we obtain the results for R 1 < 1 or R 2 > 1. However, for the closed interval [R 2 , R 1 ], the dynamical behavior of model (2.4) has not been studied, and the threshold parameter for the reproducing number (or the pulse vaccination rate) between the extinction of the disease and the permanence of the disease has not been obtained. It is worthwhile for us to study the case for R 1 > 1 and R 2 < 1 in the future work. Finding the threshold value R = R 1 = R 2 is left for our future consideration."}
