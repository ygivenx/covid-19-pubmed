However, other coronaviruses do cause agglutination of red cells from several species, including rat, chicken, hamster and mouse, but some, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) must tirst be purified in sucrose gradients [6, 8, 1, 5] . Previous t)relinfinary work in this laboratory had shown that untreated extracts from mouse livers containing MHV3 gave inconsistant llacmagglutination an(I thus, in the present study, partially purified preparations of the virus were tested for haemagglutinating properties. !). P. WAI,KEI~ AND G. M. CLEATOB.\n\nMIIVa (obtained from Dr .I.S. Porterlleld, Sir Williams Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, l:ngland) was propagated by th-intraperitoneal inoculation of 21-~lay old Manchester strain mice. Livers were removed 72 h after infection. macerated in I ml of l)ulb:~eco lal phosphate buffered saline ,, A ,, (PBS-A) per liver, and centrifugated at 1,500 .q for 10 rain. Supernatant fluids (3 ml) were overlaid onto 20 to 60 % (v/v) m~crose gradients (55 ml) prepared in distilled water and centrifuged at 70,000 .q for 48 h. The gradients were fractionated in 3-ml aliqnots which were diluted four fold in PBS-A and centrifuged for 2 h at 30,000 g. Sedimented material from each fraction was resuspended in PBS-A ((1.5 nil}, and screened for infectivity in mice. Control preparations of uninfected mouse livers were processed as above.\n\nErvthrocvtes were collected into Alsever's solution, washed in PBS-A and resusp'ended'to 8 \"i, (v/v) by haematocrit.\n\nHaemagglutination tests were carried out as described by Clarke and Cassals 12], except that each well (WHO plates) contained 0.2 ml of virus dilution and 0.2 ml of a 0.2 % (v/v) erythrocytc suspension. Fractions containing infectious virus were pooled and tested at 4, 20 and 37 \u00b0 C, using pH values 5.75, 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 6.8 and 7.2.\n\nCoronavirus-like particles and ,;mall amounts of amorphous material were seen by electron microscopy in pooled materials recovered from virus-containing fractions detectc(! towards the middle of the sucrose gradients. Haemagglutination was detected only in those fractions which contained infectious virus (titre of pooled material 10 s.s LDs0/ml in mice).\n\nOptimal haemagglutination titres using mouse and ferret erythrocytes were obtained at pH values between 5.75 and 6.4, and erythrocytes from all species were thence tested at pH 6.2 (table I). Haemagglutination was not observed with erythrocytes from the following species: sheep, rabbit, rhesus monkey, rat, gerbil, pigeon, cat and guinea-pig. Haemagglutination was not detected in control material from fractions of sucrose gradients used to ,, partially purify )) uninfected liver material.\n\nIn common with other coronaviruses, MHV3 agglutinates erythrocytes from several species and, as with IBV, it is necessary to partially purify the preparations of virus to obtain consistent results. Haemagglutination was observed at 4, 20 and 37 \u00b0 C except with mouse erythrocytes, which did not agglutinate at 20 and 37 \u00b0 C. Erythrocytes did not elute from agglutinated preparations left for several h at 37 \u00b0 C.\n\nThe l)reliminary studies reported here indicate that MHV.~ may be included among those coronaviruses causing haemagglutination. Haemagglutination inhibition studies and infectivity assays are now being undertaken to confirm the above results and establish a ral)id method of measuring antibody levels to MHV.\n\nPartially purilie(I preparations of mouse het)atitis virus type 3 (MHV.0 agglutinated fowl, day-old chick, ferret, hamster and htmmn 0 erythrocytes at 4, 20 and 37 \u00b0 C and mouse erythrocytes at 4 \u00b0 C.
