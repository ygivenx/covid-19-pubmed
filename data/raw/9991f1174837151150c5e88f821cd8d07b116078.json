{"title": "", "body": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious, viral disease characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and mortality of up to 100% in pigs less than 2 weeks old. Pigs over 5 weeks of age often have milder clinical signs and mortality is usually less than lO-20% depending on the age at infection and the degree of passive immunity (Garwes, 1988; Bohl, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1991) . Control of clinical disease is difficult because there is no effective practical treatment and commercial modified-live and killed vaccines are of limited effectiveness in TGE-naive swine (Saif and Wesley, 1991) .\n\nClinical episodes of TGE occur more frequently during colder months (Pritchard, 1982; Bohl, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1991) . This seasonal occurrence has been attributed to increased survival of the virus at colder temperatures (Siegel et al., 199 1) and the tendency for pigs to develop diarrhea because of low or fluctuating temperatures. Pigs with diarrhea probably shed greater amounts of TGE virus than subclinically infected animals (Shimuzu and Shimuzu, 1978) , and hence, challenge doses are probably greater also during winter months.\n\nTwo forms of TGE occur. Epizootic TGE generally develops when the virus is first introduced into a susceptible herd but is usually of short duration and no longer clinically evident after herd immunity develops. On the other hand, enzootic TGE occurs when virus persists in a partially immune herd into which susceptible swine are introduced (Bohl, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1991) . Recrudescence of clinical TGE often occurs in enzootically infected herds about 9 months after the first outbreak as offspring of susceptible sows are exposed to the virus. TGE recrudescence has been associated with breeding herd sizes of over 100 sows, the presence of finishing pigs in large herds, and the introduction of purchased gilts (Pritchard, 1987) . Parity (parity 3 on farm 1, parity 1 on farm 2), the use of purchased versus homebred gilts, and the use of multiple boar matings increased the risk of TGE on two Illinois farms (Siegel et al., 1991) , but to our knowledge there are no previous largescale population-based studies that have quantified the risk associated with herd-level management factors.\n\nThe National Swine Survey was conceived and implemented by veterinarians in the United States Department of Agriculture: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: Veterinary Services (USDA:APHIS:VS), in collaboration with universities and producer groups, to estimate health and productivity parameters for swine in the United States. The objective of the present study was to use data from the National Swine Survey (NSS) collected between November 1989 and February 1991 to identify herd-level management and demographic risk factors for TGE seropositivity and quantify the magnitude of these risks.\n\nThe sampling design used to collect data for the National Swine Survey involved multiple frames (areas and lists) and was multistaged (herds, farrowing buildings within herd, and rooms within buildings) with selection of monitored farrowing units with known probability. The scheme is described in detail elsewhere (USDA:APHIS: VS, 1992; Tubbs et al.. 1993 ).\n\nEighteen states were selected for monitoring of sows and litters: 13 (Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin) because they were already actively involved in the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) program; four (Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania) because they were representativeof other states with large swine populations; and one (Indiana) because of its large swine population and the expressed interest of its veterinarians. The selected states accounted for 62% of swine operations and 81% of hogs in the United States.\n\nIn each state, lists of farms were grouped by herd size (calculated as total inventory) in accordance with the size characteristics of the swine industry in the state. In states with large swine populations, herds were sampled approximately in proportion to the number of hogs. The targeted number of herds for sampling ranged from a minimum of 48 in states with few swine such as California and Oregon to 216 in Iowa. The primary outcome that influenced the number of herds to be sampled (and hence the number of litters to be monitored) was preweaning mortality. In states with large swine populations, herds were generally ineligible to participate if they expected less than ten litters to farrow during the following 3 month monitoring period. In states with relatively small numbers of swine herds, this restriction was not imposed. For herds with over 100 expected farrowings in the 3 month period, a random subsampling procedure (USDA:APHIS:VS, 1992) was used to select buildings and rooms for monitoring.\n\nThe National Swine Survey was conducted in two phases and involved four questionnaires that were administered to the owner or manager of each herd in a consistent way (Fig. 1 ),\n\nwere designed by NAHMS national staff in consultation with university swine specialists and epidemiologists.\n\nIn phase I, 3 184 producers in the 18 participating states were randomly selected from a list of about 70 000 producers that was used for the USDA quarterly hog estimates (January 1989). These producers were contacted by National Agricultural Statistics Service enumerators and asked to participate in the study. Enumerators gave producers an overview of the survey, emphasizing confidentiality, the benefits of the program, and responsibilities of the participants. They obtained written informed consent in order to release the producer's name to USDA:APHIS:VS.\n\nEnumerators also completed the first questionnaire, the General Swine Farm Report (GSFR), for 1661 (52%) self-selected herds. This report included questions on management, inventory, sales and other descriptive information about each production phase. In addition, farrowing units for large herds were described so that NAHMS national staff could determine which farrowing facilities were to be monitored. In Phase II, producers were enrolled on a quarterly basis by state and federal Veterinary Medical Officers (VMOs) into the 3 month monitoring of sows and litters. Of 1661 producers that completed the GSFR, 7 12 (42.9%) agreed to participate and completed all remaining questionnaires (Fig. 1) . The questionnaires included questions about herd demographics, swine health events on the farm in the preceding year including any history of TGE, vaccination and other disease control practices, biosecurity measures including pig movement and quarantine procedures, and access of possible animal reservoirs to the facilities. In addition to the required surveys, owners of monitored farms were requested to record treatments, and morbidity and mortality data for sows and piglets occurring during the 3 month follow-up. Diary cards used for data recording are shown in Tubbs et al. ( 1993) .\n\nAt the second visit, VMOs asked producers to take part in serologic testing for TGE, swine influenza, and encephalomyocarditis.\n\nOf the original 712 cohort herds, 392 (55%) agreed to participate. On each farm, blood samples (25 ml) were collected at a single sampling from the anterior vena cava or jugular vein of up to ten sows in the monitored farrowing buildings. At an assumed prevalence of at least 30% for the infectious agents of interest, sampling of five to ten breeding females provided at least 80% confidence of detecting at least one positive female given a perfect test (DiGiacomo and Koepsell, 1986) .\n\nBlood was shipped on ice, on the day of collection, to the USDA:APHIS:VS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames, IA, for testing for antibodies to TGE virus. Blood sampling was done over a year with 42 herds ( 10.7%) collected from December 1989 to February 1990, 119 (30.4%) from March to May 1990, 103 (26.3%) from June to August 1990, and 128 (32.6%) from September to November 1990. Because agreement was not reached about participation of VMOs in blood collection in Georgia, herds were not tested in that state.\n\nSera were diluted 1:4 with modified Eagle's minimum essential medium containing gentamicin (25 pg ml-') and amphotericin B (1 pg ml-'). Diluted sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and further diluted with the same medium ( 1:8 through 1:5 12 in 0.025 ml volumes) in 96-well tissue culture microtiter plates. An equal volume of Purdue strain TGEV, diluted to contain 300-500 TCIDSO, was added to seven wells containing the diluted sera ( 1:8-l :5 12). The eighth well was a serum control. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Swine testicle cells (0.15 ml) at a concentration of about 2 X 16 cells ml-' were added to all wells. Plates were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C in a CO* incubator. Serum neutralization (SN) titers were expressed as the highest dilution of serum that completely neutralized viral cytopathic effect. Sows with TGE titers of at least 1:8 were considered positive.\n\nSerologic results were expressed as the percentage of TGE positive sows per herd. For evaluation of risk factors, those farms that had less than five samples tested (n = 38) were excluded from further analysis since the sample size was considered too small to have a Frequency of sighting wild starlings: > 4 times month-', 1 time month -I, l-2 times year-', never reasonable chance of detecting infection. Herds with one seropositive sow (n = 16) were also excluded from the initial analysis because this group was considered to be the one where the true herd serostatus was most likely to be misclassified. The primary definition for a positive herd (n = 160) was at least 20% seropositive (equivalent to at least two seropositive sows in the sample of five to ten) and for a negative herd (n = 178) was 0% seropositive.\n\nBecause published data were not available on the individual sensitivity and specificity of the SN test, the optimal cut-off value (% positive samples) for aggregate interpretation could not be readily assessed. Consequently, we did several sensitivity analyses with different cut-off points (positive herds: at least lo%, at least 20%, or at least 50% positive samples; negative herds, 0% or less than 20% positive samples) to determine the robustness of the findings. We also included lack of history of TGE in the previous 12 months as an additional factor for designation of a negative herd.\n\nData were entered into a commercial database (R:Base for DOS, version 2.11, Microrim, Inc., Redmond, WA, 1987) . Specialized data entry screens, reports, and data checking routines were designed by NAHMS national staff to minimize errors at all stages of data collection and handling, and to ensure that the data were as complete as possible. Detailed descriptions of data management techniques are reported elsewhere (USDA:APHIS: VS, 1992; Tubbs et al., 1993) .\n\nDemographic and management variables that were hypothesized to be risk factors for TGE (Table 1 ) on the basis of published studies or speculation were extracted from various files in the database, merged into a single file with the TGE serologic results, and analyzed with BMDP (BMDP Statistical Software Inc., Los Angeles, CA, 1990) .\n\nFrequencies of five variables (type of operation, female breeding herd size, whether the farm manager/owner considered the herd free from TGE, previous history of TGE, and TGE vaccination history) that may have influenced a producer's decision to participate in serologic testing were compared between sampled and nonsampled herds by x2 test.\n\nFor participating herds, crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CZ) were used to measure the strength of association between each risk factor of interest and the herdlevel TGE serostatus (positive or negative). Factors with significant (P < 0.05) ORs in bivariable analysis were further evaluated by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression (Kleinbaum et al., 1982) . However, based on evidence from previous studies, three variables that were potential confounders (season of sample collection (SEASON), TGE vaccination status of breeding females (VACCN), and number of females tested (NO-TEST) ) were included in all models regardless of their significance. Other variables were allowed to enter models using a forwards-selection procedure (P-to-enter = 0.15 and P-to-remove = 0.10). Two-way interactions were tested hierarchically after determining the main-effects model. Adjusted ORs and 95% were calculated for factors included in final models.\n\nHerds that participated in the serologic testing for TGE were more likely to have reported a history of TGE in the previous 12 months and were less likely to have used TGE vaccines or claim freedom from TGE than nonparticipants. Participation, however, seemed to be independent of breeding herd size or operation type (Table 2) .\n\nForty-five ( 11.5%) of the 392 blood-sampling participants reported a history of TGE in the year prior to the study. For 41145 herds, a diagnosis was made by either the herd veterinarian and/or a laboratory, although the specific methods used to establish a diagnosis were not determined. Fifty-four ( 13.8%) owners or managers considered their herds free of TGE.\n\nAlthough 4101 females from 415 farms were listed for testing for TGE antibodies, usable results were obtained only for 3365 females on 392 farms that had completed all questionnaires (Fig. 1) . Of the 3365 samples (mean 8.7 per farm, median lo), 1177 (35%) tested positive with titers of 1:8 (n=82), 1:16 (n= 123), 1:32 (n= 157), 164 (n=216), 1:128 (n= 183), and 1:256 or over (n=416). \"P-value calculated by x' test. 'Respondents were asked if their farm hid been tested or examined such that they considered their herd free of TGE.\n\nOn a herd basis, 101 (25.8%) herds had seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10% and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) herds had 0% seroprevalence (Fig. 2) . Seropositive herds were detected in all states except Colorado, .and four states (Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, and Ohio) had more than 60% positive herds (Fig. 3) .\n\nUsing the primary definition of positive and negative herds, significant crude ORs were obtained for five factors: female breeding herd size (SOWS), the number of swine farms within 3 miles of the farm (NRSWNIN3), the number of swine purchased in the last 3 months from herds that were not specific-pathogen-free (PRDNSPF) , the number of times a truck was hired for trucking swine (NRTRKHIR) , and the number of on-farm deliveries in the past 3 months (NRDLVON) ( Table 3) . Variables related to other biosecurity measures, potential reservoirs and carriers, and most pig and people movement variables were not significantly (P> 0.05) associated with herd TGE serostatus (data not shown) although we acknowledge that the frequency of some factors was low.\n\nIn the logistic regression analysis, significant adjusted ORs were obtained for SOWS and PRDNSPF after adjustment for each other and for SEASON, VACCN, and NO-TEST (Table 3) . The variable NRSWNIN3, although not statistically significant (P= 0.08), remained in the final model using a P-to-remove of 0.10. The variables NRDLVON, NRTRKHIR failed to enter or remain in models that included SOWS primarily because of their positive association with the latter variable, and especially the category with at least , 1989-1990 . Seventy-eight herds with less than five sows tested or large herds identified on a regional basis only were not included. A herd was considered seropositive for TGE if at least 20% of sows were positive (titers 1:8 or more). Hatching indicates the percentage of seropositive herds in the state: dots, O-30%; single hatching, over 30 to 60%; cross hatching, over 60%. Herds were designated as positive (n = 160) if 3 20% sows were seropositive and negative (n = 178 ) , if 0% of sows were seropositive. Herds with less than five samples tested were excluded from analysis. Hosmer-Lemeshow ,y2 goodness-of-fit = 5.49.8 d.f., P = 0.70 for the model used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Nl, variable did not enter or remain in model. Odds ratio for NO-TEST is for a 1 unit increase in the number tested in the interval 5-10. 500 sows. In general, the adjusted ORs of variables tended to be smaller than crude ORs, but there were small increases in adjusted ORs for breeding herd size of at least 500 sows (4.34.9) and for purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-SPF herds (3.7-3.9). All twoway interactions among independent variables were not significant in the final model.\n\nOf the variables of interest, SOWS had the strongest association with TGE seropositivity with herds with at least 500 sows at about 4.9 times higher odds of seropositivity than herds with 100-199 sows (the category with the median number of sows). There was some evidence of a positive dose-response relationship between the number of sows and the odds of seropositivity (but the 95% CZs for other herd size categories included 1) . Of the potential confounders, VACCN had the strongest association (OR = 21.3) with seropositivity. Blood sampling during summer was associated with a reduced odds (OR = 0.45) of seropositivity, but the number of samples tested (range 5-10) did not influence (OR= 1.02) herd seropositivity.\n\nRe-analysis of the data with different aggregate cut-off values of seroprevalence for classification of herds as positive or negative, and inclusion of TGE history did not markedly influence the variables selected in logistic regression models. Parameter estimates were mostly within + 15% of the estimates obtained with the primary definition (data available on request from authors).\n\nWe identified two factors-female breeding herd size of at least 500 sows and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-SPF herds in the last 3 months-that were associated with TGE herd seropositivity in logistic models. Because the duration of seropositivity on a farm was not known, we could not speculate whether the factors might have been associated with the risk of introduction of TGE, its persistence, or both outcomes.\n\nLarge herd size (at least 500 sows) significantly increased the odds of positive TGE serostatus compared with herds of 100-199 sows. This finding is consistent with another study (Pritchard, 1987 ) that also found a positive association between herd size and TGE recrudescence with the greatest risk in herds with more than 300 sows. Using data from Pritchard's study, we calculated that English herds with 101-300 and more than 300 sows were at 4.7 and 14.2 times higher odds, respectively, of TGE recrudescence than those with 100 sows or more. Herds of over 50 breeding pigs in Spain also had a higher prevalence of TGE than smaller herds (Cuber0 et al., 1993)) but breeding herd sizes are typically smaller in Spain than in the United States or England. Demonstration of a herd size association is also consistent with the clinical impression of many swine producers and veterinarians in the United States that chronic TGE seems to occur more often in herds of more than about 200-500 sows. In large breeding herds, some susceptible females may not be exposed to infection during a primary outbreak of TGE (Pritchard, 1987) . These females fail to transfer adequate colostral antibodies to suckling piglets which are often at the greatest risk of infection (Pritchard, 1982) . A greater odds of TGE seropositivity might also occur in large herds because the absolute number of replacement females increases usually as herd size increases. Theoretically, a larger pool of susceptible females will facilitate circulation of the virus and hence the persistence of infection in the herd.\n\nOther herd-size related management factors might also have influenced exposure to virus (Gardner et al., 1993) . In large herds, there are frequently more contacts with potential sources of infection such as feed and pig transport trucks entering the premises. Indeed, the frequency of hiring a truck (NRTRKHIR) and the number of feed deliveries on farm (NRDLVON), were positively associated with large herd size when taken individually, but they failed to enter or remain in models after controlling for other variables. Uncleaned trucks or boots and other clothing used by truckers might be sources of virus for previously noninfected herds. Other unmeasured but important management factors that might occur more frequently in large herds, such as manure or fecal feedback, might also partially explain the herd size association. Pritchard (1987) also attributed part of the herd size association with TGE recrudescence to continuous farrowings and early weaning of piglets.\n\nMost variables related to people and pig movement, except purchase of more than 25 non-SPF pigs, were nonsignificant after adjusting for other factors; but many of these management policies probably change with time in response to herd expansion plans, changing prices, and disease events. Herds that purchased more than 25 non-SPF pigs were about 3.9 times more likely to be seropositive to TGE than those that bought fewer non-SPF pigs. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that non-SPF herds are more likely to be infected with TGE than SPF herds, and therefore, pigs purchased from the former herds are more likely to be carriers of virus. Previous studies (Morin et al., 1974; Underdahl et al., 1976) have shown that TGE virus can be recovered from the intestine or lungs of feeder pigs for up to 4 months after infection. The TGE status of herds supplying pigs to the study herds was not known, but owners who in this study described themselves primarily as producers of breeding stock (SPF or non-SPF status was not specified) sometimes (5 / 14) had seropositive herds.\n\nOur analysis failed to associate lack of quarantine procedures and health tests for purchased breeding pigs with TGE seropositivity. Less than 50% of producers who introduced breeding pigs 'health tested' new additions prior to entry into the herd. The type of health tests was not described in the database so we were unable to specifically determine whether introduced pigs were tested for TGE. When breeding pigs were quarantined on introduction, the duration was typically less than 40 days (USDA:APHIS:VS, 1992) which would be insufficient to prevent entry of TGE virus with untested carrier pigs. Another potential explanation for the lack of association was that most seropositive herds were probably chronically rather than recently infected. Pritchard (1987) concluded that TGE recrudescence and presumably a high level of seropositivity resulted from the introduction of susceptible pigs into an enzootically infected herd rather than the introduction of a carrier pig into an previously noninfected herd.\n\nWe found some evidence of an increased odds of seropositivity when there were more than two swine farms within a 3 mile radius of the sampled herd (NRSWNIN3).\n\nWhen farm density is high, there may be more movement of animals and people among farms in proximity, and manure and waste disposal practices may increase the risk of TGE spread. Swine herd density was also reported to be a risk factor for county prevalence of pseudorabies virus in Illinois (Austin and Weigel, 1992) . Similar factors may be important in the transmission of both diseases although no evidence exists for long-distance airborne-transmission of TGE virus among swine herds as has been described for pseudorabies (Chris-tensen et al., 1990) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection (Henningsen et al., 1988) .\n\nThe lack of statistical significance of structural biosecurity measures such as a perimeter fence and footbaths in production units, as well as boots, shower and coverall requirements, indicates that people probably are less important than carrier pigs in TGE seropositivity. Although recorded as occurring in some herds, these biosecurity requirements may not have been implemented consistently, and hence, these exposures also might have been misclassified. Because some factors such as footbath and showering requirements were infrequent (less than lo%), the power to detect significant differences in the ORs for some biosecurity variables was low. Although dogs, cats and starlings are possible intermediate hosts or reservoirs for TGE virus (Bohl, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1991) , we found no association between their access to facilities and herd serostatus.\n\nAs expected, herds that vaccinated against TGE were at significantly (2 1.3 times) higher odds of TGE seropositivity than nonvaccinating herds but reasons for vaccination were not recorded. A herd may have vaccinated because of a previous history of TGE or as insurance against severe clinical disease following introduction of TGE. Some evidence for the latter hypothesis is that 56 producers, who claimed freedom from TGE and reported no history of disease in the last 12 months, reported using TGE vaccine. Seropositivity in TGE vaccinated sows may have been caused by vaccination alone or by a combination of vaccination and field infection. Serum neutralization titers following vaccination are usually lower than postinfection titers and seldom exceed 1: 16 in the absence of natural exposure (Hill, 1988) . Because there was no unequivocal way to differentiate titers from vaccination from those due to natural exposure, vaccination status was included in logistic models. Also, the potential influence of vaccination on TGE seropositivity could have been better evaluated if the farm's TGE history over a longer period (3-5 years) were known and if the type of vaccine (killed or modified-live) had been recorded.\n\nThe use of the SN test for TGE serodiagnosis had some limitations. Serum neutralization titers tend to decrease rapidly even in previously infected sows. A TGE-infected sow can have a 1:32 titer that will decrease to less than 1:8 by her second farrowing (Hill, 1988) ) but in herds where TGE virus persists, at least some sows would probably have been recently exposed to virus and have higher titers. A more important limitation of the SN test was its potential inability to distinguish PRCV from TGE virus in some pigs and herds. Unlike enteropathogenic TGEV, PRCV infects the respiratory rather than the intestinal tract Van Nieuwstadt and Boonstra, 1992) . Infection with PRCV induces antibodies that also neutralize TGE in vitro and, hence, the SN test may have failed to differentiate between TGE and PRCV infections. Other more specific tests, such as the blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Callebaut et al., 1989; Van Nieuwstadt and Boonstra, 1992) ) may assist serologic differentiation of PRCV from TGEV. The blocking ELISA is more expensive, however, and for cost reasons could not be used for a national survey involving many samples.\n\nMisclassification of herd TGE serostatus was not considered a major bias in the present study. Although estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the SN test were not available, the distribution of serologic results (Fig. 2) was such that most herds (313/392) had 0% or at least 80% seropositive sows. Aggregate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value calculations (Martin et al., 1992; Donald et al., 1994) indicated that misclassification of herd TGE serostatus was probably not very great at the selected cutoffs (0% for negative herds, at least 20% for positive herds). These calculations (data not shown) were done assuming that the individual sensitivity and specificity of the SN test were both 0.9, that sensitivity and specificity correlations were 0, the mean prevalence in infected herds was 0.5, the intraherd correlation coefficient ranged from 0 to 0.9, that 50% of herds were infected, and that either five or ten pigs were sampled. Furthermore, by varying the aggregate cut-off value and including an additional criterion (lack of TGE history) in our negative group, conclusions did not change.\n\nIn some herds it is possible that TGE serostatus changed between data collection and blood sampling. Blood samples were usually collected at the second VMO visit, a month after the Swine Health Report was administered. The time lapse from survey to serologic sampling might have been sufficient time for TGE virus to be introduced into the herd, for recrudescence to have occurred, or for titers of some sows to have decreased below the positive cut-off value of 1:8.\n\nPotentially, results of the study might be extrapolated to the entire population of US swine using sample weights as previously described for estimation of disease prevalence and the frequency of management factors (USDA: APHIS:VS, 1992) . In the present analysis, however, participating and nonparticipating farms were shown to be different with respect to three TGE-related variables (history in the last 12 months, vaccination use, and freedom from TGE) . Because of this selection bias and the lack of sampling in Georgia, population odds ratios were not calculated and inferences about risk factors were restricted to study herds.\n\nAlthough the National Swine Survey database provided a good opportunity to evaluate many herd-level management and demographic risk factors that were associated with TGE seropositivity in the United States, some data that we needed were not available nor was it possible because of confidentiality to obtain the missing data retrospectively. The crosssectional study design and lack of detailed questions on TGE history prevented us from determining how long herds had been infected, the reasons if any for TGE vaccination, and whether sows were vaccinated with live or killed vaccines. In addition, seropositivity in some herds may have been attributable to PRCV rather than TGE infection. Despite these limitations, the findings of the study support current knowledge of risk factors for TGE seropositivity. Large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows) and the source and number of purchased pigs were found to be significantly associated with TGE seropositivity. The association with large herd size remained after many management variables were controlled for in the analysis."}
