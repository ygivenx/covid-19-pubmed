{"title": "", "body": "What if rather than maintaining the quixotic dream that global health not be political, we trained global-health prac titioners to be savvy of international aff airs to leverage mechanisms to advantage global health? What if we activ ely trained global-health partisans-health professionals trained specifi cally for the rigours of international politics-to smooth the way, work the backrooms, and strategically manoeuvre so that international public-health professionals can do what they do best: public health? What if these practitioners possessed in-depth understanding of foreign policy, international jurisprudence, and global security and were masterful enough to work health to the top of international aff airs agendas not just during health crises, but every day?\n\nWhat I am suggesting goes far beyond the usual advocacy that international public-health professionals are already quite good at. I suggest we develop the clout and expertise to infl uence the course of international aff airs. We live in halcyon days of global public health, buoyed by the Gates-Buff ett eff ect, 1 but there are some health outcomes that money will not be able to buy, because powerful nations actively pursue foreign-policy agendas detrimental to health. This new approach would be prevention of the highest order. Imagine infl uencing trade agreements at their inception so that the food security of millions is assured and shortages averted. Imagine knowing enough about world fi nance to change the international fi nancial institutions' conditions for loans that create health inequities. Imagine health as a human right with legal teeth, replacing the current mechanisms that require nation states to provide protections for their citizens, even when that same state is a perpetrator. Business as usual in these non-health settings has serious international public-health ramifi cations. 2 The business of high politics has not traditionally fallen within remit of what is understood as global health. 3, 4 But it should.\n\nPublic-health experts regularly champion cooperation as an endpoint toward which we should all be working. Cooperation is inarguably a powerful tool for the 6 Delivering for women and children management of global health, as the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome proved. 5 But cooperation as a lone strategy for meeting all global-health objectives is naive when competition between states informs the dominant paradigm, realism, that has shaped relations from Whitehall to Washington for the past century. Realism in international aff airs is not about seeing things as they really are, but rather refers to a philosophical doctrine that every international-relations undergraduate learns during their fi rst semester: states are the primary agents in international aff airs, states selfi shly pursue their national interests, and sovereign states use laws and institutions to pursue these interests. 6 In such a framework, health is expendable when other interests, such as national security, are perceived to be at risk. Contrast the tenets of realism with today's globalhealth realities: porous national borders; weak and impoverished states struggling to provide health care; the \"unruly m\u00e9lange\" of bilateral, multilateral, and non-governmental organisations 7 standing in for states; foreign debt undermining health fi nancing in poor nations; and multinational corporations that successfully defend patent protections for essential medicines. Global-health realities are at odds with the prevailing paradigm. International public-health professionals compound this problem if they have too little understanding of the mindsets (of which realism is only one), histories, and concomitant power structures behind foreign policy and international aff airs. International public-health professionals too commonly assume that the value of good population health-to individual societies and to the global community-is self-evident and that they should not really have to work too hard to compete with other agendas.\n\nToday's global-health gap is political. We currently do not have enough people knowledgeable and experienced in the everyday politics of international aff airs working for advantages that support global-health progress. Global health needs advocates who embrace and understand international realpolitik, of which global health is but a part. 8 My argument is simple: cultivate foreign policy that helps rather than hinders improved global-health outcomes. This is distinguishable from the promotion of global-health policy, 9 which is also necessary. Some global-health victories will depend on how well international politics are played.\n\nFaculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada, BC V5A 1S6 slerikson@sfu.ca I declare that I have no confl ict of interest.\n\nThe Countdown to 2015 reports in today's Lancet show that the progress being made on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 is in line with projections but continues to be far too slow, especially for MDG 5. The report presents the results only up to 2006, and the increase in fi nancial resources being allocated to these neglected areas is encouraging. Nevertheless, there is no question that more is required from all parties to reach these important goals.\n\nThe number of children who die of measles each year has now been reduced by half a million since 1999.\n\nRoutine immunisation coverage is above 80% for the fi rst time in history, thanks to the eff orts of the GAVI Alliance and its partners, among others. However, we need to make further progress by rapidly introducing vaccines against other major killers, such as rotavirus (which causes half a million deaths a year) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (which kills 800 000 children every year). This will be a key challenge for the GAVI Alliance, along with making immunisation services more widely available. In 2002, the UN adopted the target of providing life-saving vaccines to 90% of all children by 2010. 1"}
