{"title": "Peptide presentation by bat MHC class I provides new insight into the antiviral immunity of bats", "body": "In recent years, emerging and re-emerging viral diseases with high mortality have continuously posed serious threats to human health [1\u20133]. In etiologic studies with convincing evidence, a series of such fatal diseases in humans have been confirmed or hypothesized to be caused by bat-borne viruses such as Hendra virus (HeV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus, and coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4\u201310]. Similarly, fetal diseases in livestock have also been associated with emerging viruses of bat origin, such as the fatal disease outbreak of pigs in China, which was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), from bats [11,12]. Furthermore, it was shown that influenza-like viruses, termed H17N10 and H18N11 circulating among bats in Central America, may act as an ancient influenza reservoir [13,14]. It is well accepted now that bats harbor an exceptionally high proportion of zoonotic viruses with interspecies transmission potential [15] that have the potential to become virulent pathogens for humans. However, studies from wild or experimental bats indicate that most of these lethal viruses in humans and other mammals cause only asymptomatic infection in bats, suggesting a potentially special immune system in bats that is different from most other mammals [16,17].\n\nStudies of comparative genomics and transcriptomics confirm that the critical components of the innate and adaptive immune system are conserved and functional in bats [18,19]. However, a large number of bat-unique characteristics related to immunity and antiviral responses have recently been identified. The most notable immune features involve the absence of key natural killer (NK) cell receptors and dampened cell signaling of type I interferons (IFNs) [18\u201320]. Meanwhile, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways, has a substitution in bats, compared with other mammals, that leads to decreased IFN activation [21]. Meanwhile, bats also possess special features to maintain an effective immune state. The genome analysis of Rousettus aegyptiacus revealed a dramatic difference from their functional gene counterparts in other mammals [19]. Indeed, bat IFNs and some IFN-stimulated genes are constitutively transcribed or maintain detectable expression levels in the absence of stimulation [22\u201324]. These characteristics may allow bats to fine-tune innate defense responses against insults by viral, bacterial, or host cytosolic DNA while avoiding excessive inflammation. However, the adaptive immune system in bats is less well studied.\n\nMajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (MHC I) present antigen peptides to the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to active T cells through interaction with T-cell receptors (TCRs), which play pivotal roles in antiviral defense [25,26]. Epitopes or peptides are accommodated in the six pockets (A\u2013F) of peptides/MHC I complexes, which were initially defined in humans [27]. Pocket A anchors the amine group of the amino terminal residue of the bound peptide, pocket B binds the side chain of peptide residue two, and pocket F accommodates the side chain of the carboxyl terminal residue [28]. In bats, the partial map of the Pteropus alecto MHC I region shows that MHC I genes are highly condensed and present within only one of the three highly conserved class I duplication blocks [29]. Genomic analyses of R. aegyptiacus demonstrate an expanded and diversified set of MHC I genes, with MHC I genes found outside the canonical region [19]. Sequences analyses, based on bat MHC I genes identified thus far, show that many of these bat MHC I molecules have a 3\u2013 or 5\u2013amino acid (aa) insertion in the \u03b11 domain compared with other mammals [20,29]. In the R. aegyptiacus genome, it is shown that 11 of the 12 MHC class I loci identified display the 3-aa insertion and only one locus without the insertion. Interestingly, one of the 11 MHC class I loci with 3-aa insertion is located in the canonical MHC alpha loci, indicating that both the MHC class I molecules with and without insertion can present the canonical binding surface [19]. Furthermore, the binding peptide motif of MHC I Ptal-N*01:01 derived from P. alecto has been identified. It displays a preference for peptides with Pro at their C terminus, which has never been seen in MHC I proteins of any other vertebrates [30]. However, the molecular basis for the peptide binding and presentation by bat MHC I remains unclear.\n\nIn this study, we screened bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides from different bat-borne viruses (HeV, EBOV, MERS-CoV, and H17N10) and determined the structures of bat MHC class I complexed with these viral peptides. Unusual peptide presentation by bat MHC I with was demonstrated, which may help to understand the greater capacity of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses, from the perspective of adaptive immunity.\n\nPrevious work identified 56 bat MHC I genes from more than seven different species of bats on different continents. Each of these bat MHC I genes has the typical MHC I domains as in other mammals. However, examination of the retrieved set of bat MHC I sequences from GenBank revealed several unusual features. First, bat MHC I genes contain a 3- or 5-aa insertion within their peptide binding groove (PBG) compared with those from a variety of other mammals (i.e., between Trp51 and Ile52 of human HLA-A*0201) (Fig 1A and 1B). Within the bat MHC I genes, 30.36% possess a 3-aa insertion and 57.14% have the 5-aa insertion (Fig 1A, S1 Fig and S1 Table). The 5-aa insertion is unique to bat sequences, while the 3-aa insertion is present in both bats and some marsupials (82.61% of the opossum MHC I, 50% of the koala MHC I, and 100% of both tammar wallaby and Tasmanian devil MHC I contain the 3-aa insertion). All of the higher mammals, such as humans, nonhuman primates (NHPs), mouse, and horse, lack any insertion at this site (Fig 1A and S2A Fig).\n\nAnother feature of bat MHC I is the higher prevalence of a negatively charged residue at position 59 and a positively charged residue at position 65, as well as their pairing (according to the Ptal-N*01:01 residue code) (Fig 1B and S2A Fig). For the MHC I molecules of the higher mammals, the residue at the position corresponding to 59 (position 56 of human, NHP, mouse, and horse MHC I) is a highly conserved Gly. However, 71.43% of bat MHC Is have an Asp59 or Glu59 (59D/E) at this position (Fig 1C). The pairing of Asp59 and Arg65 (D59+R65) also occurs at a high fraction (35.71%) in bat MHC I compared with the MHC I of humans (0%), NHP (0%), mouse (0%), and horse (0%). Actually, the pairing of the charged residues at these two positions include different types: the negatively charged residues Asp/Glu at 59 paired with positively charged residues Arg/Lys at 65, and even positively charged residue Arg/Lys at 59 paired with Asp/Glu at 65 (as gene EPQ18390.1 in Myotis brandtii). Also, the pairing of the charged residues, termed as charge matching at the two positions (+/\u2212), occurs at an even higher fraction for bat MHC I (39.29%). Interestingly, these features of bat MHC I are also prevalent in marsupials (Fig 1C).\n\nTo determine whether the insertion has any correlation with the unusual substitutions at positions 59/65, we analyzed the fractions of 59D/E, D59+R65, and the +/\u2212 charge matching in the bat MHC I genes with the 3-aa insertion. We found a significantly higher fraction of 59D/E (100%), D59+R65 (64.71%), and the +/\u2212 charge matching (70.59%) in the bat MHC I genes with the 3-aa insertion compared with the corresponding fractions of other bat MHC I genes (no insertion and 5-aa insertion) (59% for 59D/E, 23.08% for D59+R65, and 28.21% for the +/\u2212 charge matching) (Fig 1D). Collectively, these distinct features suggested an unusual PBG of bat MHC I, which may affect peptide binding and presentation.\n\nTo verify the peptide binding motif of Ptal-N*01:01 and to screen the potential bat MHC I T-cell epitopes from recently emerging and re-emerging viruses with bats as their potential reservoir, we predicted Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides from EBOV, MERS-CoV, and H17N10/H18N11 (S2 Table). The previously determined Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides derived from HeV were also included as a positive control [30]. The binding capacity of these peptides were evaluated by their ability to facilitate the in vitro renaturation of Ptal-N*01:01. Generally, the peptides with higher binding capability to MHCs would have a higher production of the heterotrimer MHC complexes but lower production of \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m). Seven peptides from MERS-CoV, five from EBOV, one from H17N10, and the two HeV-derived peptides helped Ptal-N*01:01 naturally refold (Fig 2). The lengths of the Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides cover a range from octamers to tridecamer. These peptides possess an Asp at the P1 position (with Gln in one peptide: MERS-CoV-S4), an aromatic aa (Phe or Tyr) at the P2 position, and a Pro or Leu at the P\u03a9 position (C terminus of the peptide) (S2 Table).\n\nThe binding peptide motif of bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01, with the negative-charged Asp at the P1 position and a Pro at the P\u03a9 position, is indeed extremely rare in class I binding peptide repertoires of humans and other mammals. To verify the uncommon peptide presentation features of bat MHC I, we determined the crystal structures of Ptal-N*01:01 in complex with the two HeV-derived peptides, HeV1 (DFANTFLP) and HeV2 (DYINTNVLP), two EBOV-derived peptides, EBOV-NP1 (DFQESADSFL) and EBOV-NP2 (DFQESADSFLL), one H17N10-derived peptide, H17N10-NP (DFEKEGYSL), and one MERS-CoV-derived peptide, MERS-CoV-S3 (DFTCSQISP) (Table 1).\n\nThe overall structures of Ptal-N*01:01 display the common characteristics of classical MHC I molecules in other mammals, with the extracellular region of the heavy chain folding into three different domains. The \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains construct a typical PBG that contains two \u03b11-helices and eight \u03b2-sheets, and the \u03b13 domain and \u03b22m display typical immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and underpin the peptide binding domain (Fig 3A). The all-atoms superimposition of Ptal-N*01:01/HeV1 onto the other five structures demonstrates a similar overall conformation, with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.344\u20130.517 \u00c5 (Fig 3B). The superimposition of Ptal-N*01:01/HeV1 onto human MHC I HLA-A2 and mouse MHC I H-2Kd generated RMSDs of 1.198 and 1.119 \u00c5, respectively (Fig 3C). The most distinct differences between Ptal-N*01:01 and the MHC I from other vertebrates are located in the N terminus of the PBG, with an extension of the \u03b11-helix in Ptal-N*01:01 (Fig 3D).\n\nTo elucidate whether the peptide-presenting features of a bat MHC I molecule can be influenced by binding to human \u03b22m, we solved the structure of the Ptal-N*01:01 heavy chain complexed with human \u03b22m (Ptal-N*01:01-h) at a resolution of 1.6 \u00c5 (Table 1). Comparing HeV1/Ptal-N*01:01 renatured with bat \u03b22m and human \u03b22m, the structural conformations of both HeV1 peptides in the two structures are also similar, with an RMSD of 0.228 \u00c5 in the two binding grooves (Fig 3E). In addition, the overall structures are quite similar, with the RMSD of 0.564 \u00c5 of all atoms (Fig 3F). And the key residues binding to \u03b11\u03b12 domains and \u03b13 domain of the Ptal-N*01:01 heavy chain are highly conserved in human and bat \u03b22m (S2B Fig). Further analysis shows Trp60 in bat \u03b22m binds to Gln99 and Asp125 in Ptal-N*01:01 when forming a complex, which is also conserved in human \u03b22m when binding to Ptal-N*01:01 (Fig 3G). It indicates that the structure of the peptide loaded in the groove of Ptal-N*01:01 was not affected by the substitution of the \u03b22m subunit. We also determined the structure of monomer bat \u03b22m without MHC I (Table 1). The structure alignment of bat \u03b22m monomer with \u03b22m subunit in MHC complexes indicates a minor conformational shift of the loop resides Ser55 to Tyr63 in bat \u03b22m after forming a complex (Fig 3H).\n\nAlthough having different lengths, the 8-mer peptide HeV1, 9-mers HeV2 and H17N10-NP, 10-mer EBOV-NP1, and 11-mer EBOV-NP2 in the PBG of Ptal-N*01:01 all display an M-shaped conformation, with P2 and P\u03a9 residues as the primary anchors and the P5 or P6 residue as the secondary middle anchors (Fig 4A\u20134F and S3A\u2013S3E Fig). The P1 Asp of all of the peptides adopts a rigid conformation upward to the \u03b11-helix of the heavy chain. In the structure of the Ptal-N*01:01/MERS-CoV-S3 complex, the conformation of the P3\u2013P8 residues of the peptide could not be determined due to their poor electron densities (S3F Fig), revealing a flexible conformation in the middle region of this MERS-CoV-S3 peptide. However, the other three residues (P1-Asp, P2-Phe, and P\u03a9-Pro) with electron densities available adopt similar conformations as in the other five structurally determined peptides. As a 9-mer peptide, MERS-CoV-S3 possesses a Glu at P6, corresponding to the P6-Asn in 9-mer HeV2, which is the secondary anchor residue. The larger Glu may not be able to locate in the PBG, which leads to a flexible conformation of the MERS-CoV-S3.\n\nTo further validate the role of the unusual binding peptide motif of bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01, Ala mutations at residues P1, P2, P\u03a9, and the middle (P5 or P6) positions of peptides HeV1 and HeV2 were evaluated by refolding assays (Fig 4G and 4I). The thermal stability of the resulting heterotrimers was monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig 4H and 4J, S3 Table). Substitution of Ala at P1 (HeV2-D1A), P2 (HeV2-Y2A), and P9 (HeV2-P9A) of peptide HeV2 led to nearly no refolding for Ptal-N*01:01, whereas Ala at P1 (HeV1-D1A), P2 (HeV1-F2A), and P8 (HeV1-P8A) of peptide HeV1 still supported refolding but with significantly lower stability than the original peptide. In contrast, substitution of Ala at P5 of HeV1 (HeV1-T5A) and at P6 of HeV2 (HeV1-N6A) led to similar yield of refolded heterotrimers, indicating a similar stability compared with the original peptides. Thus, through these analyses, the P1 anchor of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides seems to be as significant as the P2 and P\u03a9 anchors.\n\nBat Ptal-N*01:01 possesses the Met-Asp-Leu insertion within the N terminus of its \u03b11-helix (between residues 51 and 52 of HLA-A*0201). Compared with the structures available for the MHC I of other mammals, such as humans and mouse, the Ptal-N*01:01 structure displays an extension of the \u03b11-helix of the PBG (Fig 5A). The 3-aa insertion pushes residue Asp59 closer to the N terminus of the binding peptide, which leads to the extension of the negatively charged side chain of Asp59 into the PBG (Fig 5B). The bat MHC I residue Asp59 participates in the formation of the A pocket (S4 Fig). Detailed analysis indicated that Asp59, Arg65, and the P1-Asp of the peptides in all six structures of Ptal-N*01:01 form a triangular network of hydrogen bonds (Fig 5C and S5 Fig).\n\nTo further investigate the role of the 3-aa insertion in the peptide binding and presentation of Ptal-N*01:01, we constructed the Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa) mutant, which deleted the 3-aa insertion (Fig 5G). The structure of Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa)/HeV1 displayed a shortened \u03b11-helix that is similar to the human HLA-A*0201 (Fig 5D). Meanwhile, although the salt bridge was still observed between Arg65 of Ptal-N*01:01 and the P1-Asp, both the Arg65 and P1-Asp displayed a conformational shift (Fig 5E). The triangular network of the hydrogen bonds between Asp59 (Residue Asp56 in the mutant), Arg65 (Residue Arg62 in the mutant), and the P1-Asp of HeV1 within the structure of the wild-type Ptal-N*01:01 was broken (Fig 5F). One of the hydrogen bonds between the two residues Arg65 (Residue Arg62 in the mutant) and the P1-Asp of HeV1 was lost, and the remaining two hydrogen bonds extended from 2.97 to 3.23 \u00c5 and 2.67 to 2.72 \u00c5, respectively.\n\nWe also investigated whether the 3-aa deletion of Ptal-N*01:01 influenced binding ability to the peptides. Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa) was still renatured in the presence of peptide HeV1 but with a much lower yield of the heterotrimer complex (Fig 5H). CD spectroscopy also indicated a weaker binding of Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa) with the peptide (Fig 5I). To further verify the unusual peptide presentation and preference for peptides with a P1-Asp in bat Ptal-N*01:01, we constructed the HLA-A2M mutant, which has a 3-aa insertion and the charge matching residues at positions 59/65 based on HLA-A*02:01(Fig 5J). Both the refolding assay and CD spectroscopy indicated a stronger binding of DL9 (G1D mutant at P1 of peptide GL9) with the HLA-A2M compared with HLA-A*02:01, and the HLA-A*02:01 has a higher binding capacity to GL9 than DL9 (Fig 5K and 5L).\n\nAlthough Ptal-N*01:01 can bind peptides with Leu as the P\u03a9 anchor, the binding peptides can also possess Pro at this position. This is uncommon in the peptides bound by MHC I molecules from other mammals. The structures of Ptal-N*01:01 with the 9-mer peptides HeV2 (DYINTNVLP) and H17N10-NP (DFEKEGYSL) showed that both of the peptides adopt similar overall conformations as the HLA-A*0201\u2013presented 9-mer peptide GL9 (GILGFVFTL) with a Leu at the P\u03a9 site (Fig 6A). However, to the best of our knowledge, no peptide motif with a Pro at the P\u03a9 position has been reported for HLA-A*0201. Detailed comparative analysis of the F pockets of Ptal-N*01:01 and HLA-A*0201 revealed that the F pocket of Ptal-N*01:01 is shallow but with a wide opening (Fig 6B\u20136E). Corresponding to Asp77 and Tyr116 of HLA-A*0201, Ptal-N*01:01 possesses smaller residues Gly80 and Leu119, respectively. The Ptal-N*01:01\u2013specific Gly80 in Ptal-N*01:01 is small, which provides more space to accommodate the pyrrolidine ring of P\u03a9-Pro. In addition, although both HLA-A*0201 and Ptal-N*01:01 have a similar Lys residue in their corresponding positions (146 for HLA-A*0201 and 149 for Ptal-N*01:01), the conformation of the Lys149 of Ptal-N*01:01 is shifted to the C terminus of the PBG, which leaves more space for the open mouth of the F pocket in Ptal-N*01:01.\n\nTo verify the allele-specific preference of Ptal-N*01:01 for peptides with Pro at the P\u03a9 site, we examined the binding ability of HLA-A*0201 to a mutated GL9 peptide, GL9-L9P, with a Pro at P9 (Fig 6F and 6G). We found GL9-L9P has a weaker capacity to help the HLA-A*0201 refold, and the generated heterotrimer complex has lower midpoint transition temperature (Tm) (38.1\u00b0C) compared with the wild-type peptide GL9 (55.8\u00b0C) with a Leu at P\u03a9. Thus, although Pro at P\u03a9 may also act as a suboptimal anchor for HLA-A*0201, Ptal-N*01:01 uses Pro as one of its optimal P\u03a9 anchors.\n\nThe analysis of the 20 different component amino acids for the proteins from the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV indicated that Pro possesses a relatively low mutation rate compared with the other amino acids (Fig 6H). The mutation rate of Pro is only higher than Trp and Gly, which are the largest and smallest residues, respectively. It indicates that, as special residues Trp and Gly, the residue Pro may also keep the natural conformation and function of viral proteins. In other words, structural constraints favoring conservation of Pro in certain positions of proteins may operate to preserve viral protein conformation and function. Thus, its mutation rate is restricted. The selection of Pro as the anchor residue of bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01\u2013presented peptides may restrict the viral mutation pushed by T-cell immunity and accelerate virus clearance.\n\nThe P2 positions of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides are predominantly aromatic amino acids such as Tyr and Phe as the anchor, which is common in human HLA-A*2402 or mouse H-2Kd. However, when we superimposed the structures of Ptal-N*01:01 onto the previously determined structures of HLA-A*2402 and H-2Kd, we found that the P2 anchors of Ptal-N*01:01 protrude in a different direction (Fig 7A). The HLA-A*2402\u2013 and H-2Kd\u2013presented peptides have a Tyr or Phe pointing to the C terminus of the PBG, while the Tyr or Phe of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides swing toward the N terminus of the PBG (Fig 7C and 7D). Comparison of the amino acids lining the B pockets of these MHC I molecules from different mammals demonstrated that Ptal-N*01:01 possesses a Tyr9 (compared with the small residues Ser9 in HLA-A*2401 or Val9 in H-2Kd), which takes up space and can push a P2-Tyr or -Phe to the other direction (Fig 7B). Furthermore, compared with the residues Met45 in HLA-A*2402 or Phe45 in H-2Kd, the Ptal-N*01:01\u2013specific Ala45 leaves a large space to accommodate the P2-Tyr or -Phe. Indeed, detailed analyses showed that the P2-Tyr of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the \u03b2-sheet on the floor of the PBG. In contrast, the P2-Tyr of HLA-A*2402\u2013restricted peptides bind to the side chain of His70 on the \u03b11-helix (Fig 7B). Sequence superimposition of the bat MHC I with other mammal MHC Is indicated that Ala45 is prevalent (41%) among bat MHC I molecules but is never seen in human and mouse MHC I (S2A Fig).\n\nPreviously, it was indicated that Ptal-N*01:01 has a special preference for the binding of long peptides, together with the common 8\u201310-mer peptides in other mammal MHC I molecules. To further elucidate whether the 3-aa insertion of Ptal-N*01:01 has an impact on the preference for long peptides through an N-terminal extension manner, we synthesized 20 long peptides (11-mer to 15-mer) that were previously eluted from Ptal-N*01:01\u2013expressing cells (S4 Table) [30]. None of these peptides could facilitate Ptal-N*01:01 refolding in vitro (S6A Fig). Considering that these 20 peptides may not have the typical motif of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides, we also synthesized naturally N-terminally extended peptides based on the Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides from HeV1, MERS-CoV-S7, and EBOV-NP1 (S5 Table). Although these three peptides have a typical motif of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides, the N-terminal extension led to a failure in peptide binding (S6B Fig and S5 Table). These data indicate that the 3-aa insertion into Ptal-N*01:01 leads to a more restrictive binding peptide selection for Ptal-N*01:01 but not an extension to longer peptides via the N terminus.\n\nThe identification of bats as natural reservoirs of several highly pathogenic viruses that impact human and animal health and the fact that these viruses are harmless to bats have resulted in an increasing interest in the investigation of the specificities of the bat immune system. Herein, we screened and identified a series of bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides derived from four different bat-borne viruses: HeV, EBOV, MERS-CoV, and H17N10. The subsequent determination of the structures of Ptal-N*01:01 complexed with peptides from these viruses revealed unusual peptide presentation features of bat MHC I. Interestingly, this uncommon feature of pocket A of bat MHC I may be shared by the MHC Is from different marsupials. In addition, as the traditional primary anchoring positions for peptides, the B and F pockets of Ptal-N*01:01 also display unconventional conformations that contribute to the distinct peptide presentation and special peptide motif compared with other higher mammals.\n\nThe sequence combination of the 3-aa insertion at the N terminus of the \u03b11-helix and the charge matching residues at positions 59/65 enable an unusually tight anchoring of the P1-Asp in pocket A of Ptal-N*01:01. But more significantly, this insertion site is located at a position called 310 helix (residues 49\u201353); newly synthesized MHC I molecules complexed with \u03b22m are poised in the endoplasmic reticulum in a peptide-receptive (PR) form, ready to bind and be stabilized in the mature peptide-loaded (PL) form by peptides destined for display at the cell surface. The movement of a hinged unit containing a conserved 310 helix promotes the PR transition state to a PL mature molecule [31]. Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity peptides onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. TAP binding protein (TAPBPR; related) remodels the peptide-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity peptide [32]. In the absence of TAPBPR, Y84 (Y87 in Ptal-N*01:01) plays a role in closing of the \u03b12-1-helix \u201clatch\u201d by associating with the C terminus of bound peptides in the F pocket, the release of nonoptimal peptides induced by TAPBPR [33]. However, the hydrogen bond network of the A pocket could stabilize peptides with P1-Asp during peptide processing and exchange and high-affinity peptides are guided by initial contacts spanning both the A- and F pockets to form a prolonged interaction within the groove, resulting in a closure of the \u03b12\u20131 helix latch, which triggers TAPBPR release from the peptide/MHC I complex.\n\nBeing highly polymorphic, subtle substitutions or insertions in the PBGs of MHC I molecules may dramatically affect the binding peptide pool and also the peptide presentation to T cells [34,35]. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that a series of bat MHC I molecules have an insertion in the N terminus of the PBG compared with other higher mammals [29]. Herein, our structural study visually shows that the 3-aa insertion in the bat MHC I leads to an extension of the \u03b11-helix. This conformational change causes the protrusion of the bat-specific residue Asp59 into the A pocket of the PBG, which forms a hydrogen bond network with the Arg65 and the peptide P1-Asp. Study of the peptide repertoire of key human and mouse MHC I alleles demonstrates that anchor Asp is disfavored at the P1 position of the peptides [36]. In contrast, recently reported data on the peptide elution from bat MHC I molecules [30], together with viral peptide screening results in this study, demonstrate that bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01 prefers peptides with a P1-Asp. Either depletion of the three inserted residues (Met52Asp53Leu54) or substitution of the P1-Asp with Ala impaired the MHC/peptide binding. Indeed, the electrostatic nature of the contacts between Asp59, Arg65, and P1-Asp and the fact that it is involved in solvent-exposed elements in pocket A of the MHC complex suggest that the P1-Asp acts as a \u201csurface anchor residue.\u201d This surface anchor residue was also previously defined in a phosphopeptide-MHC complex [37] in which the solvent-exposed P4 phosphate moiety can enhance the stability of the peptide-MHC association. The additional surface anchor residue for the bat MHC I binding peptides may have at least two advantages for antiviral T-cell immunity. First, the peptides tightly bind to Ptal-N*01:01 and present a special peptide-MHC landscape at the N terminus of the peptides for the T-cell recognition. Second, negatively charged residues such as Asp/Glu in the peptides may also act as key residues in the original viral proteins for virus replication, which will have lower mutation rates to escape T-cell recognition. In addition, the insertion of Met52Asp53Leu54 also leads to a special exposed landscape of the \u03b11-helix of Ptal-N*01:01. Thus, heterozygous bats with MHC I alleles of both 3-aa insertion and no insertion may possess a T-cell repertoire with broader diversity, which need more work to investigate.\n\nBats are one of the most ancient extant lineages of eutherian mammals, believed to be located in distinct mammalian lineages different from marsupials and other higher eutherians [29]. The evolution of the MHC I gene family is closely tied to the evolution of the vertebrates genome [38]. However, the 3-aa insertion and the charge-matching residues at positions 59/65 of MHC Is are also prevalent among different marsupials: opossum, koala, tammar wallaby, and Tasmanian devil. This may be a phenomenon of convergent evolution under the pressure of related pathogens. To comparatively investigate the peptide presentation of MHC I from marsupials, we have synthesized a marsupial MHC I gene (Trvu-UB*01), which has similar characteristics to 3-aa insertion and charge-matching residues at positions 59/65 to Ptal-N*01:01, and also the small residue G at position 80 (S7A Fig). However, the preference of the Trvu-UB*01 protein for peptides may not be similar to that of Ptal-N*01:01 (S7B Fig). This result indicates that although some alleles of MHC I from the marsupials possess the same key residues in the PBG of Ptal-N*01:01, the preferred peptide motifs are only partially similar between them (Pro as P\u03a9), which may reflect the contribution of some other adjacent residues. Thus, the detailed peptide motifs and the presentation features of MHC Is from these lower mammals still require further laboratory investigation. Meanwhile, whether the 5-aa insertion in the bat MHC I impacts the peptide presentation in the same manner as 3-aa insertion or with a new molecular mechanism needs more structural studies. In this context, it is also worth mentioning that we also tried two additional online MHC-peptide binding predicting servers, NetMHCpan and Rosetta FlexPepDock, to verify the peptide-binding experiments in the study. However, neither prediction server was able to match the experimental results. This may indicate that current MHC binding peptide predictions were not suitable for non-mouse and nonhuman mammals such as bats, which may have a different manner of peptide binding.\n\nLike the human and murine MHC I [2,39], Ptal-N*01:01 has B and F pockets in the PBG to accommodate the primary anchors of the binding peptides, but uncommon conformational features of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013loaded B and F pockets were identified through our structural investigations. The B pocket of Ptal-N*01:01, featuring the bat-specific residue Ala45, has a novel position in the PBG for the P2 anchor. In this position, the P2-Tyr of the peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the \u03b2-sheet on the floor of the PBG of Ptal-N*01:01, which leads to a stable anchoring of the P2-Tyr. Meanwhile, Ptal-N*01:01, with a relatively unique Gly at position 80, has an unusually shallow F pocket with a wide entrance, like a large bowl, which can accommodate the uncommon P\u03a9-Pro anchor. To the best of our knowledge, although the P\u03a9-Pro anchor is not observed in the previously reported peptides from mammalian MHC I, the precedents for the P2-Pro anchor have been reported in the context of murine H-2Ld and human B*3501 and B*5301 [40\u201342]. Requirements for Pro in the P3 position as an anchor residue are also observed in the murine H-2Dd- and macaque Mamu-A*01\u2013restricted epitopes [43,44]. A previous study indicates that the antiviral effect of T cells is sufficiently strong to force the virus to adopt a relatively unfavorable mutation, which reduces viral replication [45]. The proline anchor may be a result of special antigen processing in bats. For humans, most products of ornithine decarboxylase degraded in vitro by the 26 S ATP-dependent proteasome, which contained one or two Pro residues, implied that the Pro residue has a role in the escape from random cleavage by proteasomes [46]. In addition, Pro residue(s) within epitopic sequences presumably contribute to efficient production of MHC class I ligands through prevention of their random cleavage by proteasomes [47]. Thus, the peptides with proline as a C terminus are still seldom in human and other common mammals. However, the current research on the proteasome of bats is still blank. Our data also showed that among the 20 different component amino acids for the proteins from the bat-related viruses, the residue Pro possesses a relatively low mutation rate compared with the other amino acids (Fig 6H). Pro, with a unique conformation, may act as a key residue for the structure and function of viral proteins, and thus its mutation rate is low. Therefore, the usage of Pro as the P\u03a9 anchor of the T-cell epitopes in Ptal-N*01:01\u2013carrying bats may also restrict the formation of escape mutations. However, based on the currently limited amount of bat MHC I sequences available, Gly80 in the F pocket does not seem prevalent in bat MHC I. More sequencing of bat genomes and especially MHC I genes are needed to verify whether the accommodation of P\u03a9-Pro as a peptide anchor is common in bat MHC I or a specific feature of Ptal-N*01:01.\n\nIn conclusion, through a series of structural and functional investigation, we demonstrated several novel features of bat MHC class I molecules presenting virus-derived peptides. Our results provide new insight into the adaptive immune system of bats, which may contribute to the unique virus\u2013host interactions in these important mammals. Due to the high containment nature of the viruses and the difficulty in conducting live bat infection studies, our current study lacks in vivo functional characterization, which we hope to conduct in the future with international collaborations.\n\nThe sequences of 56 MHC class I genes (including predicted genes) from bats were retrieved from the NCBI database (S1 Table). Higher mammal MHC I heavy chain sequences were retrieved from the Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) (www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc) and the UniProt database (www.uniprot.org). Previously deposited marsupial (opossum, tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil) and platypus MHC I transcripts were included in these analyses (S1 Table). Sequence alignments were generated with ClustalX [48] and ESPript [49]. Similarities were calculated using DNAMAN (https://www.lynnon.com/).\n\nThe proteomes of 1,000 MERS-CoV genomes and 1,000 SARS-CoV genomes were retrieved from GenBank, respectively. After sequence alignment with MAFFT, the dominant amino acid for each site was elected as a reference sequence. The mutation frequency = the number of overall mutations for each amino acid/(the number of occurrences of the amino acid in the reference sequence\u00d7total number of sequences).\n\nTo screen potential peptides for binding to Ptal-N*01:01, the proteomes of the bat-related viruses EBOV (NP: GenBank no. AF054908.1; GP: GenBank no. AKG65250.1), MERS-CoV (GenBank no. AXN92228.1), H17N10 influenza-like virus (A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/060/2010(H17N10)), and H18N11 influenza-like virus (A/flat-faced bat/Peru/033/2010(H18N11)) were utilized to predict the candidate peptides. The candidate peptides were predicted and selected according to the recently reported motif, by which the two Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides, HeV1 and HeV2, derived from HeV were also synthesized (S2 Table) [30]. The potential binding scores of the selected peptides were also predicted through the online NetMHCpan 4.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan/) [50] and Rosetta FlexPepDock, which is based on structure modeling [51,52], so that we prefer choose peptides that conform to the motif of Ptal-N*01:01 [30]. The peptide purity was determined to be >95% by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry. The peptides were stored at \u221280\u00b0C as freeze-dried powders and were dissolved in DMSO before use.\n\nThe cDNAs for the heavy chain of P. alecto MHC I Ptal-N*01:01 (GenBank no. KT987929) [30] and bat \u03b22m (GenBank no. XP_006920478.1) were synthesized (Genewiz, Beijing, China). Ptal-N*01:01 sequence was deposited to GenBank by Wynne and colleagues, and Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides HeV1 and HeV2 were identified in their study [30]. Although Ng and colleagues reported the first Ptal-N*01:01 [29], the sequence is not available online. To investigate the function of Met52Asp53Leu54 in Ptal-N*01:01, a mutant termed Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa) with a deletion of these three amino acids was constructed. The amplified products expressing the extracellular domain (residues 1\u2013277) of Ptal-N*01:01 and bat \u03b22m (residues 1\u201398) were cloned into a pET28a vector (Novagen). The expression plasmid for human \u03b22m (residues 1\u201399) was previously constructed in our laboratory [53].\n\nRenaturation and purification of Ptal-N*01:01 assembled with peptides were performed as previously described [54,55]. Generally, bat MHC I Ptal-N*01:01 heavy chain and bat \u03b22m were overexpressed as inclusion bodies in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli, and the purified inclusion bodies of the proteins were solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl buffer with a concentration of 30 mg/mL. Then, injection and dilution of MHC heavy chain, \u03b22m, and peptide occurred at a molar ratio of 1:1:3 in refolding buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 2 mM EDTA, 400 mM L-Arg, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, and 5 mM reduced glutathione) [34]. After 24 hours for protein refolding, the Ptal-N*01:01 complexes were concentrated and exchanged into a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 50 mM NaCl and then purified using a Superdex 200 16/60 HiLoad (GE Healthcare, Beijing, China) size-exclusion column.\n\nCrystallization was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. The Ptal-N*01:01/peptide complexes were screened through Crystal Screen kit I/II, Index Screen kit, PEGIon kit I/II, and the PEGRx kit (Hampton Research). Plates were incubated at 291 K and 277 K and assessed for crystal growth after 1\u20132 weeks. Ptal-N*01:01/HeV1 crystals were observed in 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350 at a concentration of 7.5 mg/mL. Ptal-N*01:01/HeV1(human \u03b22m) crystals were observed in 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.0, 2% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350. Monomer bat \u03b22m were grown in 0.1 M BIS-TRIS, pH 6.5, 8% w/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5,000. Single crystals of Ptal-N*01:01/HeV2 were grown in 0.075 M HEPES (pH 7.5), 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, and 25% (v/v) glycerol at a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. Single crystals of Ptal-N*01:01/EBOV-NP1 were grown in 0.1 M succinic acid (pH 7.0) and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350. Single crystals of Ptal-N*01:01/EBOV-NP2 were grown in 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), and 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000. Single crystals of Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa)/HeV1 were grown in 0.2 M sodium formate and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350. Single crystals of Ptal-N*01:01/H17N10-NP were grown in 0.075 M HEPES (pH 7.5), 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, and 25% (v/v) glycerol. Single crystals of Ptal-N*01:01/MERS-CoV-S3 were grown in 0.2 M sodium acetate trihydrate and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to reservoir solutions containing 20% glycerol and then flash-cooled in a stream of gaseous nitrogen at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline BL19U of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data collection statistics are shown in Table 1.\n\nThe collected intensities were subsequently processed and scaled using the Denzo program and the HKL2000 software package (HKL Research). The structures were determined using molecular replacement with the program Phaser MR in CCP4 [56]. The model used was the structure coordinates with Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 5F1I [35], and restrained refinement was performed using REFMAC5 from CCP4. Extensive model building was performed by hand using COOT [57]. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with the program REFINE in Phenix or CCP4 (Table 1). Structure-related figures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/) and COOT.\n\nThe thermostabilities of Ptal-N*01:01 with two group key peptides were tested by CD spectroscopy. All complexes were refolded, purified, and measured at 0.2 mg/mL in a solution of 20 mM Tris (pH 8) and 50 mM NaCl. CD spectra at 218 nm were measured on a Chirascan spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) using a thermostatically controlled cuvette at temperature intervals of 0.2\u00b0C at an ascending rate of 1\u00b0C/minute between 20 and 90\u00b0C. The unfolded fraction (%) is expressed as (\u03b8\u2212\u03b8a)/(\u03b8a\u2212\u03b8b), where \u03b8a and \u03b8b are the mean residue ellipticity values in the fully folded and fully unfolded states, respectively. The denaturation curves were generated by nonlinear fitting with OriginPro 8.0 (OriginLab) [58]. The Tm was calculated by fitting data to the denaturation curves and using inflection-determining derivatives."}
