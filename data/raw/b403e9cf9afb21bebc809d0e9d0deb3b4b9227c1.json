{"title": "Multiplex Molecular Detection of Respiratory Pathogens in Children With Asthma Exacerbation", "body": "3 years with a defi nitive diagnosis of asthma because it may be diffi cult to differentiate acute bronchiolitis from asthma in the younger children. 16 Patients who received antimicrobial agents (eg, neuraminidase inhibitors, ribavirin, and macrolides) within 2 weeks before study were also excluded. The severity of asthma exacerbation was classifi ed according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. 17 Infection was defi ned as the detection of respiratory pathogens by our nested multiplex PCR assays. Our primary outcome was the difference in detection rate for any respiratory pathogen between children with asthma with acute exacerbation and controls (ie, stable asthma). Secondary outcomes consisted of differences in the clinical severity of asthma exacerbation, lung function parameters, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO) in relation to patients with different respiratory pathogens. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our university approved this study. Following informed written consent, subjects had clinical assessment followed by FeNO and spirometric measurements.\n\nSubjects 6 years of age and older underwent online FeNO measurement using a chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers; Boulder, CO) according to international guidelines. 18 The mean FeNO of three NO plateau values was recorded. FeNO was measured within 48 h of hospitalization for children with acute asthma and at the clinic visit for stable patients. The former group was allowed to commence systemic corticosteroids as clinically indicated prior to FeNO because it would be unethical to withhold such treatment until this study. Following FeNO, they performed spirometry (Compact II; Vitalograph; Buckingham, UK ) to measure FEV 1 , FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC.\n\nIn accordance with local Infection Control policy, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected in negative-pressure isolation rooms. Deep nasal swabs were obtained as an alternative in situation where an isolation facility was unavailable. 19 These specimens were put immediately in viral transport medium and kept at 4\u00b0C during transportation. Both viral RNA and DNA were extracted on the same day of collection by PureLink Viral RNA/ DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). RNA extracted was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen). All DNA and cDNA were used immediately for nested multiplex PCR for 20 respiratory pathogens as described previously. 20 Tables 1a and 1b in the online supplement summarize sequences and amplicon sizes of the outer and inner sets of PCR primers. Briefl y, each nested multiplex PCR assay detected four pathogens. Group 1 comprised infl uenza A and B group-specifi c and subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H5N1specifi c primers; group 2 comprised parainfl uenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4a, and PIV-4b); group 3 comprised RSV A and B, HRV, and enterovirus; group 4 comprised HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HMPV; and group 5 comprised M pneumoniae , C pneumoniae , HBoV, and adenovirus. Both the fi rst and second rounds of PCR were conducted in 20-m l reaction mixtures using fast thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). Two microliters of cDNA was used as the template for the fi rst round of PCR for groups 1 to 4, whereas 8 m L of the extracted preparation was used for group 5. In the second round of PCR, a 0.2-m L aliquot of the fi rst-round PCR product was used as a template. Table 1c in the online supplement summarizes the PCR conditions of fi ve multiplex nested PCR assays. The PCR products were stained by SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) and visualized by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels. Four corresponding positive controls and one negative control (sterile water) sample were Respiratory viruses, such as human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), are common causes of upper RTI, [6] [7] [8] but their relation to asthma exacerbation remains u nclear. Allander et al 9 developed a system for largescale molecular virus screening of clinical samples based on host DNA depletion, random polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifi cation, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. A more recently described parvovirus called human bocavirus (HBoV) was identifi ed in children with lower RTIs, 9 but its relation to asthma exacerbation is uncertain at present.\n\nAsthma exacerbation may also be caused by atypical bacteria. Chlamydophila pneumoniae , an obligate intracellular respiratory pathogen, was linked to asthma exacerbation in children. 10 Among children hospitalized for wheezing, Johnston 11 detected respiratory viruses in 18% of patients aged less than 3 months and 58% in those aged more than 5 years. Asthma-related symptoms resolved or signifi cantly improved in half of adult patients with asthma seropositive for C pneumoniae who were treated with macrolides or doxycycline. 12 Mycoplasma pneumoniae is detected by PCR in more than 50% of patients with asthma, 13 but it was also found in 11% of upper airway secretions from patients with stable asthma. 14 It is important to understand the roles different respiratory pathogens play in precipitating asthmatic attacks in order to determine ways to reduce the health-care burden associated with asthma-related hospitalization. The objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the importance of different respiratory patho gens in childhood asthma exacerbation, and (2) to delineate the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens causing asthma exacerbation in Hong Kong children.\n\nThis study recruited children with asthma aged 3-18 years with disease exacerbation who received treatments either in pediatric wards or outpatient clinics of a university teaching hospital between January 2007 and February 2008. Inpatients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation were assessed within 48 h of hospitalization. Age-and sex-matched children with asthma who were free from RTIs for 4 weeks or longer and were seen in our allergy clinic within the same week as the above children with acute asthma were recruited as controls.\n\nAsthma diagnosis was made according to British Thoracic Society criteria. 15 Briefl y, older patients were either hyperresponsive to methacholine or showed reversible airfl ow limitation, whereas young children with asthma had three or more episodes of cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing during the 12 months before the study. These young patients also showed good response to bronchodilator. This study selected only children older than included for each group simultaneously. In order to prevent PCR contamination, reagent preparation, sample processing, and nested PCR assays were performed in separate rooms away from where amplifi ed products were analyzed. Aerosol-resistant pipette tips were used throughout the experiments.\n\nAs RTIs are age-dependent, we tried to match one control per patient with respect to their age and sex. However, we failed to recruit this target number of controls because many children with stable asthma had RTI symptoms during winter. The detection rates for respiratory pathogens between cases and controls were analyzed by x 2 or Fisher exact test. The severity of asthma exacerbation, FeNO, and spirometric parameters were analyzed between subgroups with different pathogens by x 2 or Student t test. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify respiratory pathogens associated with asthma exacerbation, adjusted for age, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment, and domestic tobacco smoke exposure as covariates. All analyses were performed twotailed using SPSS v.14 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL), with the level of signifi cance set at .05.\n\nTwo hundred nine children with asthma exacerbation, including 203 patients hospitalized in our pediatric wards and six who attended our outpatient clinics, and 77 controls with stable asthma were recruited. Table 1 shows the characteristics of these patients. Children with asthma exacerbation were younger than the controls, mainly because of our inability to recruit one age-matched control for each child with asthma exacerbation. Similar proportions of patients in the two groups received regular ICS treatment.\n\nSuffi cient respiratory samples were collected from 206 (98.6%) cases and all controls; these consisted of 236 NPA samples and 47 nasal swabs. Respiratory pathogens were detected in 105 (51.0%) subjects. Table 2 summarizes the distributions of respiratory pathogens in two groups of patients. The presence of any virus with or without atypical bacteria was associated with asthma exacerbation ( P , .001 for both). Specifi cally, HRV infection was more common among children with asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09-5.32; P 5 .018). On logistic regression, asthma exacerbation was associated with the detection of HRV (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.11-5.00; P 5 .025), any respiratory virus (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17-4.08; P 5 .014), or any respiratory pathogen (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.16-4.00; P 5 .015). None of the respiratory pathogens or their coinfection was associated with the severity of asthma exacerbation ( P . .15 for all). Age, gender, and ICS treatment did not affect the detection of respiratory pathogens in patients with asthma exacerbation ( P . .1 for all). Table 3 summarizes the clinical features of patients with asthma exacerbation in relation to HRV infections. 21 Respiratory pathogens were detected in 47% of these patients, and HRV peaked in winter and early spring. These multiplex nested PCR assays were specifi c and 100-to 1,000-fold more sensitive than conventional methods in detecting the viruses. Our assays detected \u0545 10 nucleic acid copies for all viruses (except enteroviruses), which were comparable to those reported in widely quoted highthroughput multiplex PCR assays. 21 Specifi cally, our nested PCR was able to detect one cDNA copy of HRV. The present study used the same method, except for Legionella pneumophila being replaced by HBoV, to investigate the infective causes of asthma exacerbation in Hong Kong children. HRV infections also peaked in winter of 2007/2008 in children with asthma exacerbation ( Fig 1 ) . Our detection rate (51%) was similar to previous local studies 20,22 but lower than those published in white populations. 23 It is uncertain whether our low HRV detection rate was due to limitations of the PCR technique, which is less likely in view of our previously noted in vitro results, or a genuinely low incidence of HRV infection in Hong Kong children. Further studies in other Asian populations are needed to confi rm our fi ndings.\n\nHRV infection was associated with asthma exacerbation in the children, which is consistent with FeNO was the only parameter that differed between patients with and without HRV, being signifi cantly lower in the former group ( P 5 .018). Ten controls were HRV positive, and mean (SD) FeNO of those with and without HRV were 38.6 (17.9) ppb and 82.2 (61.3) ppb, respectively ( P , .001). Table 4 summarizes the relationship between age and different respiratory pathogens in patients with asthma exacerbation. Patients with asthma exacerbation caused by respiratory viruses were younger than those without identifi able viral infections ( P , .05). This fi nding was attributed mainly to RSV ( P , .005) and infl uenza A and HMPV infections ( P , .05 for both). Age did not differ between the case and control groups with infections by other organisms, including HRV, or with coinfections. Figure 1 illustrates the seasonal pattern of HRV, which was found in patients throughout the study period ( \u0546 10%) and peaked in winter (November-December) of 2007 to 2008. Similarly, 28.6% of controls had HRV in autumn-winter (September-October), but none of them were HRV positive in spring-summer (March-August). The low positive rates for other respiratory pathogens in our subjects preclude our analysis of their seasonality patterns. B. On the other hand, HRV infection was detected in 13% of our subjects with stable asthma who did not experience any symptom or sign of disease exacerbation. In a longitudinal study of healthy children, 20.6% of all HRV infections were asymptomatic. 29 Future studies should delineate the pathogenic linkage between HRV and worsened asthma.\n\nDuring the past few years, there has been impressive advance in our understanding of the interactions between HRV and host immunity. 30 HRV infects human cells via ligation with its major group receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Infected respiratory epithelial cells, and possibly macrophages, produce a variety of proinfl ammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukotrienes. These mediators in turn attract different infl ammatory cells to the airway, resulting in worsened immunopathology and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness observed in patients with asthma. In addition, airway epithelium from patients with asthma is defi cient in mounting adequate antiviral responses to HRV. 31, 32 HBoV was detected in 5.0% of 1,906 local children hospitalized for acute RTIs, 33 and seasonal distribution was noted from September to February. Despite this, the detection of HBoV in 2.4% of cases and 2.6% of controls was not associated with asthma exacerbation in the present study. This fi nding might be explained by our exclusion of infants and young children, who were at increased risk of HBoV infection. 9, 33 Three-fi fths of adults with asthma exacerbation had M pneumoniae and/or C pneumoniae , 34 and telithromycin was shown to be a useful treatment in these patients. M pneumoniae was detected in more than half of patients with asthma, 11 and also in upper airway secretions from 11% of patients with chronic stable asthma. 14 Hahn 12 claimed oral macrolides to be effi cacious for patients with acute asthma. On the other hand, Cunningham et al 10 failed to show any relation between M pneumoniae and childhood asthma exacerbation. M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were detected only in 2.4% of our children with asthma exacerbations, which was similar to that observed in patients with stable asthma. Our fi ndings do not support atypical bacteria to be important pathogens for asthma exacerbations in children or the usefulness of macrolides in treating these patients.\n\nThe major limitation of this project relates to its study power. The number of controls was much lower than that of our recruited cases, mainly because casecontrol matching within 1 week was not possible on many occasions when stable and especially younger patients also complained of nonspecifi c upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, blocked nose, sore throat) during change of weather. Our sample size had a power of 97% for detecting any difference in the detection of any virus between cases and controls, published data about the importance of HRV in white populations. In the Childhood Origins of Asthma birth cohort, a total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age. 24 HRV-associated wheezing in years 1 and 3 were the strongest predictor for asthma diagnosis at the age of 6 years. Nearly 90% of children who wheezed with HRV in year 3 subsequently developed asthma. Two other studies found HRV to be the most important microbiological risk factors for asthma diagnosis and disease exacerbation. [25] [26] [27] More recently, Miller et al 28 reported that childhood asthma exacerbations were associated with the novel group C of HRV rather than the two previously known phylogenetic groups A and Results expressed in mean (SD) and only included data for pathogens that were detected in fi ve or more patients. a P , .05 for between-group comparisons. b P , .005 for between-group comparisons. c P , .01 for between-group comparisons.

Thus, larger studies are needed to delineate the possible association between asthma exacerbation and RTIs by these organisms. The lack of standardization on the methodology of HRV detection would also pose a problem. A recent study revealed that HRVs consist of . 100 distinct serotypes. 35 In view of this degree of phylogenetic heterogeneity, the PCR primers designed for our multiplex assays were not able to detect all HRVs. Despite the use of sensitive multiplex assays as discussed previously, our molecular approach for detecting viruses would miss some HRVs that were not covered by our PCR primers. Future studies need to adopt multiple PCR primers that specifi cally target as many HRV serotypes as possible. Another weakness is that NPA samples were collected from 236 (83.4%) subjects, whereas nasal swabs were collected from the remaining subjects. As we previously reported, the overall sensitivity of detecting infl uenza, parainfl uenza, RSV, and adenovirus in NPA was higher than that obtained by nasal swabs in local children. 36 On the other hand, we did not have relevant data for HRV. Although more than 80% of subjects had NPA samples, it is possible that we might have missed some organisms in those with only nasal swabs. We also observed that only 30% of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation had successfully performed FeNO measurement according to guideline (Table 1) . 18 As patients with severe bronchospasm were probably too breathless for the procedure, only patients with milder attacks would contribute to FeNO readings in this group. In addition, a substantial proportion of these patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids prior to FeNO. These reasons explain the lower FeNO in these patients when compared with patients with stable asthma.\n\nIn conclusion, respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria are detected in more than half of Hong Kong children with asthma exacerbation. HRV infection is the most important risk factor for asthma exacerbation in these patients. Nonetheless, none of these pathogens is associated with severity of asthma exacerbation."}
