{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents Discovery and Development of Safe-in-man Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Agents", "body": "Viruses are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world (DALYs and Collaborators, 2018; Disease et al., 2018; Howard and Fletcher, 2012; WHO, to market as compared with developing new virus-specific drugs and vaccines, and a significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability Pizzorno et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018) .\n\nHere, we detail the steps of BSAA repurposing, from discovery of novel antiviral activities in cell culture to post-market studies. Moreover, we summarized currently available information on BSAAs in freely available database, focusing on those antivirals, which have been already tested in human as antivirals, antibacterials, antiprotozoals, anthelmintics, etc. Finally, we discuss future perspectives of using safe-in-man BSAAs for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as viral and bacterial co-infections.\n\nThe discovery of novel activities of BSAAs starts with exposing cells to the candidate antiviral agent at different concentrations and infecting the cells with a virus or mock. Immortalized cancerous cell cultures and co-cultures, which express appropriate viral receptors, are most commonly used in this first step. The halfmaximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) for a compound is calculated based on their dose-response curves obtained on mock-infected cells. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) are calculated based on the analysis of curves obtained on infected cells. Statistical analyses can help to determine if the differences between CC50 and EC50 are significant, given the inherent variability of the experiment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Meneghini and Hamasaki, 1967) . A relative effectiveness of a drug is defined as selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50).\n\nCell viability assays and cell death assays are commonly used to assess the cytotoxicity and efficacy of BSAAs ( Figure 2A ). Cell viability assays include MTT, MTS, resazurin or similar assays, mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dyes-based assays, esterase cleaved dye-based assays, ATP-ADP assays, and assays that measure glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption. Other cell death assays include LDH enzyme leakage assays, membrane impermeable dye-based assays, and apoptosis assays, such as Annexin V, TUNEL, and caspase assays (Shen et al., 2019) . For example, the Cell Titer Glo (CTG) assay quantifies ATP, an indicator of metabolically active living cells, whereas Cell Tox Green assay uses fluorescent asymmetric cyanine dye that stains the DNA of dead cells (Bosl et al., 2019; Bulanova et al., 2017; Ianevski et al., 2018; Muller et al., 2014) . Viral strains or cell lines expressing reporter proteins are also used to assess the efficacy of BSAAs in infected cells. For example, TZM-bl cells expressing firefly luciferase under control of HIV-1 LTR promoter allowed quantitation of BSAA action on HIV-1 infection (tat-protein expression by integrated HIV-1 provirus) using firefly luciferase assay (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2016) . RFPexpressing RVFV, nanoLuc-expressing CHIKV and RRV, as well as GFP-expressing FLUAV, HCV and HMPV also allowed identification of novel activities of several BSAAs (Andersen et al., 2019b; Bosl et al., 2019; de Graaf et al., 2007; Habjan et al., 2008; Ianevski et al., 2018; Jupille et al., 2011; Kittel et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2017; Utt et J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f al., 2016). In addition, qPCR/RT-qPCR, RNA/DNA sequencing, RNA/DNA hybridization, immuno-and plaque assays as well as CRISPR-CAS9 systems could be used for detection of inhibitory effects of BSAAs (Boonham et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2017; Konig et al., 2019; Laamiri et al., 2018; Landry, 1990; Perez et al., 2013; Sashital, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018) . Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas9, siRNA and shRNA approaches were used for identification of BSAA targets (Deans et al., 2016; Puschnik et al., 2017) .\n\nNovel anti-HSV-2 and anti-EV1 activities of emetine were discovered recently using CTG/plaque assays in human non-malignant RPE cells. Moreover, novel antiviral activities of the drug were identified using RFP-expressing RVFV, and GFP-expressing HMPV or FLUAV strains in RPE cells (Andersen et al., 2019a) .\n\nGiven that emetine also inhibits ZIKV, EBOV, RABV, CMV, HCoV-OC43 and HIV-1 infections (Chaves Valadao et al., 2015; MacGibeny et al., 2018; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2018) , and that it is an FDA-approved antiprotozoal drug, it may represent a promising safe-in-man BSAA candidate.\n\nImmortalized cell cultures/co-cultures and reporter viral strains represent excellent model systems for the discovery of novel activities of safe-in-man BSAAs.\n\nHowever, these genetically modified systems have certain limitations (attenuated or incomplete virus replication cycle, accumulation of mutations during repeated cell and virus passaging, defective innate immune responses and viral counter-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f responses, etc.) (Carter and Shieh, 2015) . Thereby, novel antiviral activities of BSAAs should be further validated in primary human cells using different viral strains (including wild-type viruses), different viral loads, different times of compound addition, different endpoint measurements and compound concentration range.\n\nPrimary cell cultures give more accurate images of drug responses (Alves et al., 2018; Denisova et al., 2012; Koban et al., 2018; Postnikova et al., 2018) . They have a low population doubling level and therefore more closely recapitulate the physiological conditions observed in vivo.\n\nPrimary cells are cells isolated directly from tissues or blood using enzymatic or mechanical methods. The cells are characterized by their high degrees of specialization, are often fully differentiated and thus require defined culture conditions (serum-free media) in order to preserve their original phenotype.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC), placental, amniotic and fetal primary cultures as well as vaginal/cervical epithelial and male germ cells have been used intensively to validate BSAA activity (Barrows et al., 2016; Denisova et al., 2012; Fink et al., 2018; Rausch et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2018) Establishing human airway, gut, skin, cerebral, liver, kidney, breast, retina and brain organoids allowed researchers to study toxicity and efficacy of several safe-in-man BSAAs against coronaviruses, influenza, enteroviruses, rotaviruses and flaviviruses (Li et al., 2017; Sacramento et al., 2017; Watanabe et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017) . However, iPSCs, ESCs and iPSCs/ESCs-derived organoids, have the same disadvantages as human primary cells (genetic differences, line-to-line and organoid batch-to-batch variability). On the other hand, these models allow researchers to predict the behavior of viruses in vivo and, therefore, to reduce animal use and in cases where animal models are unavailable to initiate clinical trials.\n\nFor example, novel anti-ZIKV activities of enoxacin, amodiaquine and niclosamide were discovered recently using human neural progenitor cells, human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neural progenitor cells, and human induced neural stem cells, respectively (Cairns et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2017) .\n\nEnoxacin is an oral broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, which also possesses anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1 activities in immortalized cell cultures (Kashiwase et al., 1999; Young et al., 2010) . Amodiaquine is an anti-malaria drug, which also possesses antiviral activities against DENV, HCV, RRV, SINV, WNV, EFV, EBOV, LASV, RABV, VZV, and HSV-1 in immortalized cell cultures (Boonyasuppayakorn et al., 2014; Hulseberg et al., 2019; Mazzon et al., 2019) . Niclosamide is an orally bioavailable anthelmintic drug, which inhibits the broadest range of viruses in vitro and, in some cases, in vivo (Cairns et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017; Hulseberg et al., 2019; Jurgeit et al., 2012; Kao et al., 2018; Mazzon et al., 2019; Stachulski et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2004) . These safe-in-man BSAAs represent promising drug candidates.\n\nIn vitro and ex vivo models do not fully reflect the complexity and physiology of living organisms. Therefore, several in vivo models have been developed to test novel antiviral activities of BSAAs. These include immunocompetent and genetically or chemically immunocompromised mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, pigs, macaques and other animals ( Figure Often animals require higher concentration of an experimental antiviral as compared to effective in vitro concentrations. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to achieve micromolar EC50 in vivo. For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics, kasugamycin and neomycin were successfully tested against ZIKV, FLUAV, and HSV-2 infections in mice (Gopinath et al., 2018) . Polyether antibiotic salinomycin also showed anti-FLUAV effect in mice (Jang et al., 2018) . In addition, investigational anticancer agent, flavopiridol, was effective against FLUAV in mice . These findings support further development of these and other BSAA.\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\n\nClinical trials are the most critical and time-consuming step of a drug candidates' journey to being approved ( Figure 2C ). However, safe-in-man BSAAs make this journey relatively short, because they have been already at phase 0, I and, sometime, at IIa of clinical trials as antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anticancer, etc. agent; i.e. they have been administered at sub-therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers to ensure the drugs are not harmful to the participants. Thus, safe-in-man BSAAs enter phase II and III, which assess the efficacy, effectiveness, safety and side effects of the drugs in clinic. It is important, however, to differentiate acute and chronic viral infections when repurposing BSAAs, given that drug concentrations and duration of the treatment could be different, and therefore, drug safety issues should be considered. \n\nWe have developed a database for safe-in-man BSAAs, which is available at https://drugvirus.info/ (Figure 3) . The drug annotations were obtained from PubChem, DrugBank, DrugCentral, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov databases ( Thus, safe-in-man BSAAs may represent drug candidates for prophylaxis and treatment of 2019-nCoV coronavirus infections.\n\nBSAAs could be combined with other antiviral agents to obtain synergistic or additive effects against certain viruses Zheng et al., 2018 (Fu et al., 2016; Kuivanen et al., 2017) .\n\nBy contrast to individual drugs, combinations of 2-3 BSAAs could be used to target even broader range of viruses (Foucquier and Guedj, 2015; Zheng et al., 2018) .\n\nSuch combinations could serve as front line therapeutics against poorly characterized emerging viruses or re-emerging drug-resistant viral strains. For example, a cocktail of nitazoxanide, favipiravir, and niclosamide could be developed for the treatment of viruses belonging to 11 families.\n\nFifty BSAAs possess not only antiviral but also antibacterial activity ( Figure 4 ; Table S1 ) (Schor and Einav, 2018) . Moreover, 13 of the 50 agents are approved as antibiotics (2 withdrawn \n\nIn addition, BSAAs showed activity against a wide range of other medically important human pathogens, including fungi, protozoa and parasites (Table S1 ) (Montoya and Krysan, 2018) , pointing out that some pathogens utilize common mechanisms to infect hosts. Moreover, structure-activity relationship analysis of BSAAs suggest that some agents, such as doxycycline, artesunate, omeprazole, nitazoxanide, suramin, azithromycin, minocycline and chloroquine, could have novel antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antifungal or anthelmintic activities (Figure 4 ). If confirmed, this could lead to development of broad-spectrum anti-infective drugs.\n\nBSAAs could also serve as treatment of other co-morbidities, therefore, simplifying the therapy and lowering its cost (Table S1 ). For example, the concomitant actions of ezetimibe and statins could be beneficial for treatment of both hypertension and several viral infections in patients with these co-morbidities (NCT00908011, NCT00099684, NCT00843661, NCT03490097, NCT00994773, NCT00441493).\n\nHere we reviewed a process of BSAA development and summarized information on 120 safe-in-man agents in freely available database. We hope that further pre-clinical and clinical studies on BSAAs will be harmonized, and data collection will be standardized. Furthermore, the follow-up studies as well as the results of on-going, finalized or terminated clinical trials will be made publicly available to allow prioritization and translation of emerging and existing BSAAs into clinical practice.\n\nThis would allow BSAAs to play a pivotal role in the battle against emerging and reemerging viral diseases. that the antiviral activity has not been either studied or reported."}
