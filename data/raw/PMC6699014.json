{"title": "Fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation of a proximal urethral stricture\ncaused by a urethral membrane in a female cat", "body": "Feline urethral strictures are uncommon, usually occurring secondary to\ncatheter-induced or pelvic trauma and most commonly within the mid\u2013distal or distal\nurethra. Although rare, urethral strictures of presumed congenital origin have also\nbeen described in young cats.1 Diagnosis, management and confirmation of the aetiology of non-trauma-induced\nurethral strictures can be challenging owing to the sparseness of the current\nliterature describing affected cases and a lack of histopathology due to tissue size\nand difficulty in sampling.2\u20137 Several surgical options have\nbeen described for the treatment of urethral strictures. These are invasive\nprocedures with significant complications and variable outcomes.3,8\u201311 This report describes the\nsuccessful management of a suspected congenital proximal urethral stricture in a\nfemale cat using minimally invasive fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation. To our\nknowledge, this treatment modality has not been previously reported in cats.\n\nA 2-year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented with a 5-week\nhistory of stranguria, pollakiuria and urinary incontinence. On initial presentation\nto the primary veterinarian the cat was reported to be excessively licking her\nvulva. This progressed to urinary incontinence when laying down and stranguria when\nurinating. Symptomatic treatment with cefovecin (8 mg/kg SC [Convenia; Zoetis]),\nmeloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q24h [Metacam; Boehringer Ingelheim]), clomipramine (5 mg\nPO q24h [Clomicalm; Elanco]) and urinary diet did not lead to improvement;\ntherefore, phenylpropanolamine (1.2 mg/kg PO q24h [Propalin; Vetoquinol]) was\nsubsequently trialled. Owing to ongoing clinical signs, an exploratory coeliotomy\nwas performed 3 weeks later. The primary veterinarian identified a thickened but\ngrossly normal bladder. Ovariohysterectomy and bladder wall biopsy were performed.\nHistopathology revealed no abnormalities.\n\nPhysical examination at the referral institution was unremarkable aside from the\nbladder being medium sized but firm on abdominal palpation. The cat demonstrated\nurinary incontinence in the consultation.\n\nBiochemistry and haematology, urinalysis and culture were performed. These were\nunremarkable apart from a mild elevation of urea (12.1 mmol/l[reference interval\n2.7\u20139.2 mmol/l]). Feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus and\ncoronavirus testing were negative.\n\nAbdominal radiographs performed under sedation (ketamine 2.5 mg/kg [Ketavet; Zoetis]\nand midazolam 0.2 mg/kg [Hypnovel; Roche], IM) showed a markedly distended bladder\ncausing dorsal displacement of the descending colon. Abdominal ultrasonography\nshowed a focal thickening of the mid dorsal bladder wall. Mild right renal pelvic\ndilation and diverticuli were noted without ureteral dilation. Based on the clinical\nhistory, these findings were suspected to be due to a partial urethral obstruction\ncausing chronic bladder distension. Urethral catheterisation using a 3.5 Fr urinary\ncatheter (KatKath; Vigon Vet) was attempted but not possible. Therefore, cystoscopy\nwas performed under general anaesthesia. This revealed a markedly dilated urethra\nwith an abrupt narrowing near the bladder neck. The cystoscope was unable to\ntraverse this narrowing, precluding visual assessment of the bladder lumen. A\nretrograde urethrogram was performed, which confirmed the presence of caudal\nurethral dilation with a sharp reduction in the proximal urethral diameter near the\nbladder neck (Figure 1). The\nurethral wall appeared smooth and regular. Based on the urethroscopic and\nurethrography findings, a diagnosis of urethral stricture was made.\n\nThe cat was discharged with meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q24h) while interventional\ntreatment options were being considered. The owner reported improvement of clinical\nsigns and initially elected to continue monitoring. The cat re-presented 8 weeks\nlater with ongoing dysuria and a distended, firm bladder. Repeat biochemistry was\nunremarkable. Repeated abdominal ultrasonography showed the development of bilateral\nrenal pelvic and ureteral dilation. Owing to worsened clinical signs and progression\nof urinary tract obstruction on ultrasonography, the cat was admitted for\nfluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation of the urethral stricture.\n\nThe cat was anaesthetised. While in dorsal recumbency, a 9.5 Fr cystoscope (67030 BA;\nKarl Storz-Endoskope) was introduced into the distal urethra. The stricture was\nidentified as a membranous structure arising from the urethral mucosa, with a very\nnarrow lumen leading to the bladder neck (Figure 2). A 0.014-inch guidewire was\nintroduced into the bladder across the urethral stricture, followed by placement of\na 4 Fr micro-introducer to minimally dilate the stricture. This allowed passage of a\n5 mm percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon dilation catheter (Sterling PTA\nBalloon; Boston Scientific). The positioning of the balloon was confirmed and\nmonitored by fluoroscopy. The stricture was dilated with 5 ml of sterile saline\nintroduced for 15 s into the balloon dilation catheter. Cystoscopic evaluation\npost-dilation revealed successful dilation of the stricture (Figure 3). The bladder lumen was evaluated\nwith no abnormalities identified.\n\nThe cat recovered uneventfully and was hospitalised for 48 h to monitor urination.\nMild pollakiuria and dysuria were noted but resolved within 48 h. No urinary\nincontinence was noted. The cat was discharged with meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO\nq24h).\n\nOn re-evaluation 6 weeks post-stricture dilation, complete resolution of all clinical\nsigns was reported. Serum biochemistry results were unremarkable. Abdominal\nultrasonography showed resolution of the bilateral ureteral dilation with mild\npersistence of bilateral renal pelvic dilation. A retrograde urethrogram showed a\nmarked improvement in the diameter of the proximal urethra at the site of the\nprevious stricture (Figure\n4). Subsequent follow-up was performed by telephone communication with both\nthe referring veterinarian and owner. Twelve months after the procedure, the cat\nremained without clinical signs or complications.\n\nUrethral obstruction is a common condition in cats.12 It can occur as a result of the presence of urethral plugs, urolithiasis,\nneoplasia, granuloma formation, bladder displacement or herniation, urethral\nstricture or idiopathic causes.1,13,14 Strictures are defined as a\nreduction in the diameter of the lumen of a hollow structure. This occurs owing to\nthe presence of cicatricial tissue as a result of inflammation and has been reported\nin hollow organs, such as the oesophagus, the rectum, the trachea, ureters and the\nurethra.15,16 In the present case, the lesion was considered a stricture, as\nits location did not correlate with a natural narrowing point of the urethra.\nFurthermore, it was located proximally at it widest point. To our knowledge, the\nproximal nature of the stricture is thought to be a novel clinical finding, as\nprevious literature only describes the presence of distal or mid urethral strictures\nin cats.1\n\nUrethral strictures are usually sequelae of malignancy, pelvic trauma, severe\ninflammation or surgical intervention.9,11,14 From the case history,\nstricture formation was considered congenital in origin based on signalment and the\nlack of trauma, urethral catheterisation or surgical intervention prior to\npresentation. In addition, the presence of the membranous structure separating both\ncavities suggests a congenital origin. Despite the lack of histopathology, it was\nconsidered to be a membrane based on the correlation of its clinical appearance and\nthe definition of a membrane as a \u2018thin layer of tissue separating two cavities\u2019.15 It was hypothesised that the membrane originated from the urethral mucosa. A\nsimilar finding has been reported in a dog with partial urethral obstruction, which\nwas also suspected to be congenital in origin.7\n\nUrethral strictures typically present with clinical signs of dysuria and pollakiuria\nowing to partial or complete lower urinary tract obstruction.17\u201319 In this case, the cat\npresented with similar dysuria, stranguria and incontinence. The mild uraemia noted\non biochemistry analysis was considered either postprandial in nature or subclinical\ndehydration. The cat\u2019s hydration status appeared clinically correct; however,\nsubclinical dehydration can present with a marginal elevation of urea.20\n\nAbdominal ultrasound and contrast radiography are common diagnostic tools when\ninvestigating urinary tract disorders.21,22 In the present case, the\nabdominal ultrasound showed focal thickening of the dorsal bladder wall. This was\nsuspected to represent the area previously biopsied by the referring veterinarian.\nThe presence and location of the stricture was confirmed via retrograde positive\ncontrast radiography, an imaging modality commonly used to diagnose urethral\nstrictures.2,9,12,18,19\nCystourethroscopy can also be used when investigating persistent lower urinary tract\nsigns, providing a magnified internal image of the urinary tract. In this case, it\nidentified the nature of the urethral obstruction, precluding placement of a urinary\ncatheter. Cystourethroscopy also aids in performing interventional\ntreatments.23,24 Although considered a minimally invasive procedure,\ncomplications associated with cystoscopy include trauma to the urethral wall,\nurethritis, urethral and/or bladder rupture.23\n\nVarious surgical procedures (perineal, prepubic and subpubic urethrostomy) have been\ndescribed for the treatment of proximal and distal urethral obstructions, mostly in\nmale cats. Such procedures are rarely performed as they are associated with a high\ncomplication rate, including stricture formation, urinary leakage, recurrent urinary\ntract infections, dehiscence, skin necrosis and urinary incontinence.8,25,26 In the present case, surgical\ntreatment was not considered a valid option due to the proximal location of the\nstricture near to the bladder neck.\n\nBougienage, either digital or with specific instrumentation, has been described as a\nmanagement method for oesophageal and rectal strictures in dogs.27,28 A single case\nreport of a urethral stricture as a consequence of perineal urethrostomy surgery in\na cat was managed via bougienage with a successful outcome.5 Although bou-gienage could be considered a management option for urethral\nstricture in cats, in the present case report the very narrow lumen of the\nmembranous stricture was considered too small to be amenable for this technique.\n\nUrethral balloon dilation is a common treatment modality for urethral strictures in\nhumans, with similar outcomes to transurethral urethrotomy. The main complication is\nrecurrence of the stricture in up to 25% of patients within the first 3 years.29 Urethroplasty offers the greatest chance for cure in humans and remains the\ngold standard in management of urethral strictures.6,30 In veterinary medicine,\nlimited cases of non-malignant urethral strictures have been reported in\ndogs2,7,31,32 and cats.5,17\u201319 To our knowledge, no other\nfeline cases managed by balloon dilation have been reported. Only two of the canine\ncases reported were managed by fluoroscopy- and cystoscopy-guided balloon\ndilation,2,31 with no associated complications or signs of re-obstruction\nnoted 22 months post treatment. In the current case, follow-up retrograde\nurethrography showed persistent mild narrowing of the previous stricture site;\nhowever, there was normal flow of contrast into the bladder and resolution of\nclinical signs. This was considered a good outcome and repeat dilation was not\nnecessary.\n\nThe placement of stents, self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) and balloon-expandable\nmetallic stents have been reported as treatment for urethral strictures and\nmalignant urethral obstructions in both dogs and cats. Ureteral obstruction is the\nmain concern with placement of SEMS for proximal urethral obstructions in cats,\nowing to a more caudal entrance of the ureters in the area of the trigone;17,18 therefore,\nballoon dilation was the preferred treatment choice in this case.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a young cat with a suspected congenital\nproximal urethral obstruction that was successfully managed by fluoroscopy-guided\nballoon dilation. Based on the promising results of this case report,\nfluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation should be considered a technique for management\nof urethral stricture in cats; although further studies with a larger caseload are\nrequired to fully endorse this technique in cats."}
