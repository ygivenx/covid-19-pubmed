{"title": "A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 2 admitted hospital patients", "body": "showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial 45 onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 46 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the 47 contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after 48 initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the 49 suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. 50 Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. 51 .
