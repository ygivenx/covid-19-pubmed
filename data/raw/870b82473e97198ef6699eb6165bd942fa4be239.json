{"title": "The Role of the Proteasome-Ubiquitin Pathway in Regulation of the IFN-\u03b3 Mediated Anti-VSV Response in Neurons 1", "body": "IFN-\u03b3 is a critical antiviral mediator in eliminating viruses from the CNS (Komatsu et al, 1996) . IFN-\u03b3 upregulates NOS-1 expression posttranscriptionally and increases NO production, which is essential in the clearance of VSV infection by neurons (Bi and Reiss, 1995; Komatsu, et al, 1996; Chesler et al, 2004) . VSV is not unique; other neurotropic viruses whose replication is inhibited by NO include CMV (Cosugi, et al, 2002) , HIV (Hori et al, 1999) , HSV-1 (Kodukula, et al, 1999) , MHV (Lane, et al, 1997) , Poliovirus (Komatsu, et al, 1996) , and Reovirus (Goody, et al, 2005) . But how this antiviral process is regulated largely remains unknown.\n\nWe propose that IFN-\u03b3 enhanced antiviral activity in neurons through alteration of the proteasome degradation of host proteins to induce NOS-1 expression and activity which can inhibit VSV protein synthesis (Bi and Reiss, 1995) . Protein Inhibitor of NOS-1 (PIN) is a protein which complexes with NOS-1, preventing functional homodimer formation (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1997; Fan, et al, 1998) . Previous studies indicated that treatment of neurons with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), an inhibitor of NOS-1 activity, induces PIN expression in neurons. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 in vitro and in mice enhances NOS-1 activity, down-regulates PIN expression, and enhances clearance of virus and survival (Chen and Reiss, 2002) .\n\nThe proteasome is an intracellular complex that degrades polyubiquitin-conjugated proteins (Ciechanover, 1994) . Previous studies showed that ubiquitination of NOS-1 occurs and that irreversible inactivators of NOS enhance the proteolytic turnover of the enzyme by a mechanism involving the proteasome (Noguchi, et al, 2000) . IFN treatment may regulate the expression or activity of E3 Ub-ligases or de-Ubiquitinases, thus altering the functional half-life of the target proteins. The proteasome-ubiquitin pathway might be involved in IFN-\u03b3 mediated regulation of NOS-1 in neurons.\n\nMHC-encoded IFN-\u03b3-inducible low molecular weight proteins (LMP2, LMP7 and LMP10) replace the \u03b2 -subunits of the proteasome complex in antigen presenting cells (Groettrup, et al, 1996) , altering its substrate specificity ( Van den Eynde, et al, 2001) . Immunoproteasomes containing the IFN-\u03b3-inducible \u03b2 -subunits produce class I-binding peptides more efficiently than those containing only constitutive subunits. However, neurons do not participate in antigen processing and presentation, and are generally incapable of expressing MHC molecules (Gogate et al, 1996; Joly and Oldstone, 1992) .\n\nThe immunoproteasome has been observed in neurons in three human neurodegenerative diseases: Huntington's Disease (Diaz-Hernandez et al, 2003) , Amylotropic Lateral Sclerosis (Cheroni et al, 2005) , and Alzheimer's Disease (Mishto et al, 2006) . This induction of the LMPs in neurons may be secondary to local secretion of inflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 by T cells and NK cells during inflammatory diseases.\n\nIn this study, we examined ubiquitination of PIN, NOS-1 and VSV proteins and the generation of the immunoproteasome in neurons following IFN-\u03b3 treatment. The results demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neurons increases PIN ubiquitination and degradation. NOS-1 levels and production of NO increases. Ubiquitin-modification and protein degradation does not contribute to the suppression of VSV protein accumulation in IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells. The immunoproteasome is generated by treatment of neuronal cells with IFN-\u03b3.\n\nIn order to determine if the proteasome degradative pathway contributed to the inhibition of accumulation of VSV proteins in IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells (Komatsu et al, 1996; Chesler et al, 2004) , we examined the effect of two proteasome inhibitors Lactacystin (LC) and Geldanamycin (GA) on VSV infection in neurons. LC inhibits proteasome directly by modifying the proteasome's catalytic \u03b2 -subunits (Craiu et al, 1997) . GA reduces proteasomemediated antigen presention through inhibition of Hsp90 (Imai et al, 2003) . In order to determine the optimal concentration of inhibitors to be used in our studies, neuronal cells were treated with a range of doses of inhibitors. The MTS assay was used to measure mitochondrial activity as a surrogate for cell viability following LC or GA treatment ( Fig 1A) . The suppression of proteasome activity by the two inhibitors was confirmed by an assay of proteasome cleavage of Z-GGL-pNA ( Fig 1B) . Treatment of cells with LC or GA alone results in inhibition of VSV replication in NB41A3 cells (Figure 2A ). When we combined the two drugs, viral replication was almost totally eliminated. In IFN-\u03b3-treated NB41A3 cells, treated with LC or GA, the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b3 was enhanced.\n\nNO is an important cellular inhibitor of viral replication. The NOS-1 product, NO, can spontaneously combine with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which readily degrades to NO 2 \u2212 (Love, 1999) . To investigate the regulation of NOS-1 activity by the proteasome, we measured NO 2 \u2212 production by IFN-\u03b3 or LC treated neuronal cells. We treated NB41A3 neuroblatoma cells for 48 hours with IFN-\u03b3 to allow accumulation of NO 2 \u2212 in the media. Figure 2B shows NO 2 \u2212 production is increased by IFN-\u03b3 or LC treatment, consistent with the NOS-1 expression. This correlates well with the inhibition of VSV replication ( Figure  2A ).\n\nUbiquitination and proteasome degradation of NOS-1 has been observed in transfected HEK cells . To determine if this were also true in mouse neuronal cells which constitutively express NOS-1, NB41A3 cells were treated for IFN-\u03b3 and/or LC for 24 hours; the expression of NOS-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and the protein by Western blot. In all related experiments, double treatment of IFN-\u03b3 and LC provide us the information of how IFN-\u03b3 effects the cell when proteasome activity was blocked. As expected, the mRNA level of NOS-1 is unaltered by IFN-\u03b3 or LC treatment ( Figure 3A ). Similar results were observed at earlier time points (3h, 12h; data not shown). While NOS-1 protein levels increased four-to six-fold with IFN-\u03b3 or LC treatment ( Figure 3B ; Komatsu, et al, 1996; Chesler, et al, 2004) . The induction of NOS-1 protein in the presence of LC treatment was also observed in primary neuron cultures ( Figure 3C ). This indicates both treatments of neuronal cells led to an accumulation of NOS-1 at the post-transcriptional level.\n\nThe level of ubiquitination and degradation of NOS-1 following IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neurons was examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) and by pulse-chase experiments. Cells treated with LC served as a control for accumulation of NOS-1. Tubulin III was used as housekeeping and loading control for the IP experiment. As shown in Figure 3D , unchanged levels of ubiquitinated NOS-1, molecular mass ~25KD higher than the NOS-1 monomer, were observed in both IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons and the untreated cells. When the proteasome was inhibited, more Ub-NOS was observed in LC treated samples, but this was not affected by IFN-\u03b3 treatment.\n\nPulse-chase was performed to measure the degradation of NOS-1 in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b3 or LC. As previously observed (Chesler DA, et al, 2004) , the half-life of NOS-1 increased 33%, from ~18 hours to ~24 hours in IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells ( Figure 3E ). NOS-1 accumulation in IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells is secondary to slower degradation. We do not know at present whether activity of an E3 ligase is suppressed or whether a deubiquitinase specific for NOS-1 is upregulated in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons. Work is in progress to examine gene expression in these cells under differing conditions to elucidate this question.\n\nTo determine if loss of PIN were involved in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation of NOS-1, we examined the expression of PIN following IFN-\u03b3 treatment in neuronal cells. RT-PCR indicated that the ratio of PIN mRNA to \u03b2 -tubulin mRNA was unchanged by IFN-\u03b3 treatment ( Figure 4A) , while the protein level was significantly reduced in the IFN-\u03b3-treated group ( Figure 4B ). Earlier time points (3h to12h, data not shown) were also examined with consistent results. Thus IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neuronal cells down-regulates PIN accumulation at the posttranscriptional level.\n\nTo further investigate the mechanism of post-transcriptional down-regulation of PIN by IFN\u03b3, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment to detect ubiquitination of PIN in both control and IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells. We precipitated ubiquitin-conjugated proteins using anti-ubiquitin pAb and blotted with anti-PIN mAb. As shown in Figure 4C , PIN migrated at a molecular mass band of ~34kD; we interpret this to mean three ubiquitin units. Four-fold more ubiquitinated PIN was found in IFN-\u03b3 treated neuronal cells.\n\nTo measure the degradation of PIN, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. Based on preliminary results, the kinetics of PIN in cells was distinct from that of NOS-1 In comparison with control, PIN was degraded more rapidly in IFN-\u03b3 treated neurons ( Figure 4D ). The halflife of PIN was reduced 40%, from ~5 hours to ~3 hours. As a control, LC treatment prolonged its half-life 50%, to ~7.5 hours. We interpret these data to be consistent with IFN-\u03b3 induction of a Ub-ligase which modifies PIN and results in its degradation by the proteasome. The loss of PIN increases the active fraction of NOS-1.\n\nIFN-\u03b3 treatment of neurons inhibits the production of VSV proteins ~75% and the release of infectious VSV by 30-to 1000-fold (Komatsu, et al, 1996; Chesler, et al, 2003) . The inhibition of VSV protein synthesis is not associated with the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR which can suppress protein translation by phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Chesler et al, 2003) . Viral proteins can be degraded more rapidly when they are Ub-modified (Aviel, et al, 2000) .\n\nNB41A3 cells were treated with IFN-\u03b3 and infected with VSV. Whole cell lysates were obtained at 5 hours p.i. and a direct immunoblotting was performed to estimate total amount of VSV proteins in IFN-\u03b3-treated as well as control cells ( Figure 5A ). As previously observed (Komatsu et al, 1996; Chesler et al, 2003) , IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neuronal cells resulted in inhibition of accumulation of VSV proteins (G, N, P, M), indicating that either viral protein synthesis is inhibited by IFN-\u03b3 treatment or viral proteins are rapidly degraded in IFN-\u03b3 treated neuronal cells. To determine if VSV proteins were targeted to the proteasomal pathway, we performed immunoprecipitations of ubiquitinated proteins and of viral proteins. Ubiquitinated VSV proteins were detected following immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin by Western blot using anti-VSV pAb. As indicated in Figure 5B , only M protein was found to be Ubiquitin modified in neuronal cells, which is consistent with the observation in BHK-21 cells of Harty and coworkers (2001) . In IFN-\u03b3-treated group, less Ub-M was detected, which correlated with decreased level of VSV proteins observed in NB41A3 cells following IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Ub-M was not over-represented.\n\nSimilar results were observed in a reciprocal IP in which anti-VSV pAb was used for precipitation and anti-ubiquitin mAb used for Western blotting( Fig 5B) . Thus IFN-\u03b3 treatment did not alter the ubiquitination of VSV M protein and proteasomal degradation cannot account for the IFN-\u03b3-mediated inhibition in VSV protein accumulation.\n\nA pulse-chase study was performed on VSV proteins in media and IFN-\u03b3-treated cells to determine if the half-life of the viral proteins were shorter than in untreated neurons. If it were, this might indicate a proteolytic mechanism distinct from the ubiquitination-to-proteasome pathway, possibly autophagy, were active in the neurons. The result indicates that the degradation of VSV proteins is unchanged by IFN-\u03b3 treatment. As shown in Figure 5C , the half-lives of VSV M, G, and NP proteins vary from 2 to 5 hours, and there are no significant differences in between the control and IFN-\u03b3-treated groups.\n\nThe IFN-\u03b3-induced immunoproteasome plays a major role in generating MHC I presenting peptides in antigen presenting cells. We investigated whether IFN-\u03b3 treatment resulted in the induction of the immunosubunits of the proteasome in murine neurons in vitro. Figure 5A shows the induction of LMP2 mRNA expression and LMP7 protein by IFN-\u03b3 in NB41A3 cells. Similar results were observed in all three immunosubunits LMP2, LMP7 and LMP10. Untreated cells show no or extremely low levels of LMP expression while IFN-\u03b3 induced their expression at both mRNA and protein levels significantly. The mRNA induction was rapid and can be observed within 3 hours of IFN-\u03b3 treatment (data not shown). All three components display maximumal induction of expression at about 24 hours treatment. To confirm the immunosubunits are incorporated into the immunoproteasome, we isolated and immunoprecipitated the proteasome/immunoproteasome 20S complex from IFN-\u03b3treated and untreated NB41A3 cells and used Western blot to detect the incorporation of the three immunosubunits. Figure 5B indicates that immunosubunits are found as components of the proteasomes isolated from IFN-\u03b3-treated samples. The constitutive subunit \u03b1 5 was consistent in all samples. Similar observations were made using primary cultured neurons (not shown).\n\nOur results demonstrate that the immunoproteasome is generated in murine neurons by in vitro IFN-\u03b3 treatment.\n\nIn this study, the contribution of proteasome-ubiquitin pathway in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated anti-VSV response in neuronal cells was examined. We found that PIN is polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by proteasome in neurons ( Figure 4 ). IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neuronal cells leads to increased synthesis and slower degradation of NOS-1 (Figure 3 ), resulting in production of NO and inhibition of viral replication ( Figure 2 ). Ub-modification and degradation of VSV proteins was unchanged in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons ( Figure 5 ). Immunoproteasome components LMP-2, -7, and -10 are induced rapidly and incorporated into the proteasome in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons ( Figure 6 ).\n\nAmong VSV proteins, only M was polyubiquitinated, but its ubiquitination profile is unchanged by IFN-\u03b3 treatment ( Figure 5 ). Among the three isoforms of NOS, NOS-1 is the only type expressed in neurons. The mechanisms by which the viral replication is inhibited NO remain to be clarified. Peroxynitrite, ONOO(\u2212), the product of superoxide and NO, may attack tyrosines, serines and cysteines of proteins and results in NO 2 Y, NO 2 S, and NO 2 C (Gu, et al, 2002; Radi, 2004) . Such modifications may alter viral polymerase activity, protein interactions, or morphogenesis (Simon, et al, 1996; Saura, et al, 1999) . NO 2 \u2212 modified proteins may not be optimal substrates for Ub-modification, as well.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells, one of the primary pathways for the degradation of proteins in the cytosol and nucleus is via the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway (Zwickl, et al, 1999) . IFN-\u03b3 treatment altered the ubiquitination of PIN, likely through up-regulation of Ub-ligases and/or dampening of specific deUBases. It was reported 4 or more Ub units may be required for degradation of proteins by the proteasome (Hicke et al, 2001; Lederkremer et al, 2005) . We found that inhibition of proteasome prolonged half-life of PIN. However, co-IP experiment only identified triply-Ub-modified PIN, this could due to the rapid degradation of poly-ubiquitin chain and/ or the affinity of the commercial antibodies used. Identifying the specific enzymes critical for this pathway will help elucidate some of the mechanisms of IFN-mediated anti-viral responses.\n\nUbiquitination of viral proteins have been found in several virus infections (Hu, et al, 1999; Eom, et al, 2004) . The ubiquitination of VSV M protein is involved in regulation of viral budding (Harty, et al, 2001) and has been shown to be critical for morphogenesis of other viruses (Khor, 2003) . Our examination of ubiquitinated VSV proteins in neurons showed only M protein is significantly ubiquitinated and the amount of Ub-M was unchanged by IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Thus ubiquitin does not appear to contribute to the more rapid degradation of VSV proteins in IFN-\u03b3-treated infected neurons. However, degradation of VSV by proteasome/immunoproteasome is still possible. Ubiquitin conjugation may not be required for the degradation of oxidized proteins by proteasome (Shringapure, et al, 2003) . VSV infection induces oxidative stress in neurons (Komatsu, et al, 1999) .\n\nA major function of the immunoproteasome is to produce antigenic peptides presented to CD8 + T cells (Kloetzel and Ossendorp, 2004) . However, little has been studied about the substrate specificity of the immunoproteasome. The immunoproteasome has been observed in three human neurodegenerative diseases: ALS, AD and HD (Diaz-Hernandez et al, 2003; Cheroni et al, 2005; Mishto et al, 2006) . It is unclear what the effect of substitution of constitutive subunits with immunoproteasome LMPs has on the neuron's physiology in these diseases or in our studies. This alteration is likely to be secondary to infiltration of IFN-\u03b3secreting inflammatory cells from circulation in response to parenchymally-produced chemoattractants. Clearly, however, this is not necessary for processing and presentation of immunogenic short peptides to be presented on class I MHC molecules, as the vast majority of neurons are not able to express MHC and even when artificially induced to express MHC class I, incapable of presenting to T cells (Joly and Oldstone, 1992) .\n\nAlthough the impact of the immunoproteasome on inhibition of VSV replication remains unknown, it may be involved in degradation of VSV proteins through ubiquitin-independent pathways. A number of related ubiquitin-like proteins, including SUMO, Nedd8 and ISG15 have been identified that can modify to proteins and modulate proteins at the posttranslational level (Hochstrasser, 2000) . ISG15 is the best defined Ub-like protein that is induced by IFN and microbial challenge, including virus infection. Upon induction, ISG15 conjugates with a variety of proteins, and may prevent the ligation of ubiquitin (Liu, et al, 2003) . The gain of function modulation of Jak-1, STAT-1 proteins by ISG15 has been observed (Malakhova, et al, 2003) implying a role of ISG15 in cytokine induced cellular alterations. Work is in progress on the contribution of these homologues in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons on the inhibition of VSV replication.\n\nAnother degradative pathway is autophagy (Suhy et al, 2000; Schmid and Munz 2005; Levine and Yuan, 2005) , in which cytoplasmic domains are engulfed and fuse with the lysosome for destruction and recycling of proteins. Although we initially chose to focus on the proteasome, work is in progress to determine the contribution of autophagy in cytokine-treated neurons.\n\nOur study indicated that, in addition to its key role in cellular protein degradation, the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway is involved in many aspects of IFN-\u03b3 regulated antiviral responses in murine neurons in vitro. We also report generation of immunoproteasome in the murine neurons in culture. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like-proteins, with their roles in modulation of IFN-\u03b3 signaling components may be critical mediators in the IFN-\u03b3-regulated anti-viral responses. IFN-\u03b3 treatment results in increased translation and longer half-life of NOS-1. At the same time, there is depletion of a NOS-1 regulatory protein, PIN by the ubiquitinproteasomal pathway. Viral proteins accumulate more slowly in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons, but this is apparently not due to Ub-modification and degradation.\n\nNB41A3 cells, RAW 264.7 cells and L929 cells were purchased from ATCC. NB41A3 cells were maintained in F-12K medium containing 15% horse serum (Summit Biotech), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C/5% CO 2 .\n\nRAW 264.7 cells were grown in DMEM low glucose media with 10%FBS and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin at 37\u00b0C/5% CO 2 . L929 cells were maintained in DMEM low glucose media containing 10%FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, HEPES buffer and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C /5% CO 2 . Unless otherwise stated, all tissue culture reagents were obtained from Mediatech. VSV, Indiana serotype, San Juan strain, originally obtained from Alice S. Huang (The Childrens' Hospital, Boston) was used in all viral studies. Recombinant murine IFN-\u03b3 and IFN\u03b2 were purchased from R&D Systems and used at a concentration of 20ng/ml and 100units/ml in all experiments. Lactacystin (LC, EMD Biosciences) and Geldanamycin (GA, Sigma) were used at concentration of 5\u03bcM unless otherwise stated.\n\nNewborn TgNSE-D b mice (the gift of Michael B.A. Oldstone, The Scripps Research Institute; reference Joly and Oldstone, 1992) that constitutively express H-2D b driven by the neural specific enolase promoter in neurons were used as a source of neurons for primary culture. They were positively selected by panning using Mouse anti-H-2D b mAb (hybridoma cell lines HB36 and HB19 purchased from ATCC). Poly-D-lysine-coated 24 well plates (BD) were precoated with 100\u03bcl goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:50, Vector) at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours. The plates were then coated with 200\u03bcl anti-H-2D b monoclonal antibody (3mg/ml) at 37\u00b0C overnight and rinsed twice with HBSS prior to use. Otherwise primary cultures were prepared as previously described (Chesler et al 2003) . Olfactory bulbs were dissected from P0 (<24 h old) TgNSE-D b mice, dissociated by enzymatic digestion (porcine trypsin 2.5%; Life Technologies, NY), and manual trituration using flame polished Pasteur pipettes. Cultures were plated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50\u03bcg/ ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, NY), 10 mM KCl, 10 \u03bcM L-glutamine, and 10 \u03bc M AraC (Sigma) for 1h at 37\u00b0C/5% CO 2 . Remove the media with floating cells after 1 hour and add same media with AraC. After 24h, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies, NY) with 1% N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, 25\u03bcM L-glutamic acid, 10 mM KCl, 50\u03bcg/ml gentamicin, and 10\u03bcM AraC. All experiments were performed on day 6 of culture.\n\nCell viability was determined by the MTS (Promega, Madison, WI) colorimetric assay following LC or GA treatment. The assay is based on soluble formazan production by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. Cells were cultured with 100ul media in 96 well plates and samples were seeded in three wells per time point at 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 cells per well. 100ul of freshly mixed MTS reagent was added into each well and incubated for 1 hour. Absorbance was determined at 490 nm using a micro-plate reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad) and the results expressed as the mean absorbance of triplicate experiments \u00b1 SE.\n\nCell lysates containing active 20S proteasome were prepared from NB41A3 cells by 20S lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris\u00d7Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaN 3 . The assay is based on the proteasome-catalyzed cleavage of p-nitroaniline from N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Leup-nitroanilide (Z-GGL-pNA; Sigma) (Current protocols in protein science, 21.6). 200\u03bc g of cell lysate was diluted in 240ul 0.05 M Tris\u00d7Cl ( pH 7.5), mixed with 10 \u03bcl of 10 mM Z-GGL-pNA and incubated in 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.25 ml of 10% TCA. Samples were centrifuged at and 0.25 ml clear supernatant was mixed with 0.25 ml of 0.1% NaNO 2 , incubating at room temperature for 3 min. 0.25 ml of 0.5% ammonium sulfamate was added and mixed for 2 min. Then 0.5 ml of 0.05% NNEDA was added to the sample following by vigorous vortex. Liberated p-nitroaniline was converted to a red-violet colored product and the absorbance of the chromogen was read in a microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad) at 540 nm against the blank. A standard curve (10 to100 nmol p-nitroaniline) was established.\n\nViral titers were determined in triplicates using serially diluted culture culernatants on monolayers of L929 cells as previously described (Komatsu, et al, 1996) . Data are presented as Geometric Mean Titer +/\u2212SEM, log (pfu).\n\nmRNA levels were determined by multiplex RT-PCR using the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit. Total RNA (100ng) was used in each reaction. The following program was used to carry out the reaction: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 32 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 58\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, then 72\u00b0C for 10 min, and 4\u00b0C hold. The primers were used in these reactions are listed in Table 1 . Products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained using the SybrGold dye (Molecular Probes), and visualized using a UV transilluminator. Results were digitally photographed using a Kodak DC290 camera controlled by the Kodak 1D analytic software (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). DNA band densities were determined using the UN-SCAN-IT software.\n\nThe concentration of NO 2 \u2212 in culture supernatants was determined by assaying the stable end product of NO (Hewett, 1999) . Briefly, equal volumes (100 ul) of experimental sample and Griess reagent (1 part 0.1% sulfanilamide in 60% acetic acid, 1 part 0.1% napthylenediamine dihydrochloride [Sigma] in distilled H 2 O) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction produces a pink color, which was quantified at 540 nm by microplate reader. Each sample was read in triplicate. A standard curve was made from sodium nitrite dissolved in Griess reagent.\n\nNB41A3 cells or primary neurons were cultured and treated with IFN-\u03b3 or LC for indicated period of time. Cells were lysed and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay, and 2mg/ml solutions were prepared and boiled for 5 min in dissociation buffer. Samples were resolved by 7.5%, 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to Transblot membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed for 1 h at ambient temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C simultaneously with primary antibodies, and then probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1h at ambient temperature. Membranes were visualized with Pierce PicoWest Enhanced TM Chemiluminescent Reagents. Film exposure was on Kodak BioMax film for 30 sec to 2 min. Protein band densities were quantitated by UN-SCAN-IT software.\n\nMouse anti-mouse NOS-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (1:2000) and mouse anti-mouse PIN (1:100 for Western blot, 1:30 for IP)) mAb were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Rat antimouse PIN mAb (1:1000 for Western blot, 1:100 for IP) were purchased from Alexis. Mouse anti-mouse class III \u03b2 -tubulin (1:10,000) mAb was obtained from RDI Diagnostics; rabbit anti-\u03b2 -tubulin III pAb (1:600) was purchased from Covence. Rabbit anti-mouse LMP2 (1:300), anti-LMP7 (1:1000), anti-LMP10 (1:1000), anti-proteasome 20S (1:100) pAb and mouse antimouse \u03b1 5 mAb were purchased from Biomol. Anti-\u03b2 -actin pAb (1:2000) was purchased from Abcam. Mouse anti-mouse \u03b2 -actin (1:100,000) was obtained from Sigma. Mouse anti-mouse ubiquitin mAb (1:1000) and rabbit anti-mouse ubiquitin (1:300) pAb were purchased from AB Reagent and Dako, respectively. Sheep anti-VSV pAb was a generous gift from Dr. Alice S.\n\nHuang (when at The Children's Hospital, Boston). HRP conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000) was purchased from Vector, Donkey anti-sheep (1:4000) and Donkey antirabbit (1:40,000) secondary antibodies, both HRP conjugated, were purchased from Jackson. \u03b2 -actin and / or class III \u03b2 -tubulin were used as loading controls since both of them have been used in related approaches (Habelhah et al, 2004; Golde et al, 2003) and neither was reported to interact with the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway .\n\nNB41A3 cells were plated and treated with IFN-\u03b3 and/or Lactacystin for 24 hours. Whole cell lysates were extracted and 400 \u03bc g protein from each sample was used. Immunoprecipitations of NOS-1 and \u03b2 -tubulin from whole cell lysates with rabbit anti-NOS-1 pAb(1:40) and rabbit anti-\u03b2 -tubulin III pAb were performed at 4\u00b0C overnight. Then, 20\u03bc l protein A/G beads (Pierce) were added and rotated at 4\u00b0C for minimum 3 hours. Beads were collected and washed with lysis buffer for 3 times, prior to boiling with dissociation buffer for 5 mins. The precipitate was detected by Western blot using mouse anti-Ubiquitin mAb and mouse \u03b2 -tubulin mAb. Quantitation of the Ubi-NOS1:\u03b2 -tubulin ratio was performed using UN-SCAN-IT software. At the same time, IP of Ubiquitin and \u03b2 -tubulin from whole cell lysate using anti-ubiquitin pAb and anti-\u03b2 -tubulin pAb. The precipitate was detected in Western blots with anti-NOS-1 mAb, anti-Ubiquitin mAb and anti-\u03b2 -tubulin mAb. The Ubi-NOS1: \u03b2 -tubulin ratio was determined. Three independent experiments, with each sample in duplicate, were performed to achieve statistical significance.\n\nCo-IP of PIN and ubiquitin was performed in the same manner, excepted for using anti-PIN antibody instead of anti-NOS-1 antibody. For the VSV-ubiquitin co-immunoprecipitation, NB41A3 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 and/or Lactacystin was infected with VSV at MOI=0.1 and lysed at 5 hours pi. 200 \u03bc g of whole cell lysate was used in each reaction. Anti-Ubi pAb and anti-Tubulin \u03b2 III pAb were used for IP. Anti-VSV pAb and anti-Tubulin III mAb were used in the immunoblotting. Ubi-VSV: \u03b2 -tubulin ratio was quantitated.\n\nNB41A3 cells were cultured in 6-well plates (2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) and incubated with 1.0 ml of Met/Cys free DMEM medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS for 30 min, and then pulsed with Met/Cys-free DMEM medium containing100 \u03bcCi of [ 35 S]Met[ 35 S]Cys mix. Following the 1 or 2 hours labeling period, the medium was changed to chasing medium (starvation medium with 2mM Met/Cys added back). At appropriate time intervals, cell pellets were collected, freezed and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\nCells were lysed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. Equal amounts of radioactive lysates were precleared with 50\u03bcl protein A/G beads (pierce) at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. Antibodies against NOS-1, PIN or VSV were added and incubated under agitation 4\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, 25 \u03bcl of protein A/G beads were added to the radioactive material and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. Then beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, denatured in SDS-containing sample buffer and loaded on a 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried at 60\u00b0C for 1.5 hour and exposed at \u221280\u00b0C for 1-7 days. The radioactivity was quantified by UN-SCAN-IT software.\n\nStudent's t test was used in all statistical analyses. Unless otherwise stated, all data were presented in mean +/\u2212 SEM. S]cysteine mix for 2 hours and chased for the indicated times. Same treatment (IFN-\u03b3 or LC) was present throughout the experiment. The cells were lysed and PIN was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-PIN antibody and SDS-PAGE. The gel was exposed and the radioactivity was quantified. The values are the mean \u00b1 S.E. of three independent experiments.\n\nNB41A3 cells were pretreated with media (control), IFN-\u03b3 or LC, or both for 24 hours prior to infection with VSV (MOI=0.1) and the 2 LC treated groups will be continuously treated with LC post infection. At 5 hours pi, whole cell lysates were extracted. A, The total amount of VSV proteins were determined by Western blot on duplicate samples with anti-VSV pAb, GAPDH was used as loading control. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. B, Ubiquitin pAb and \u03b2 -tubulin III pAb were used for immunoprecipitation prior to SDS-PAGE; samples were blotted with anti-VSV pAb and anti-\u03b2 -tubulin III mAb, and visualized with Pierce ECL kit. For the same samples, we also did IP with anti-VSV pAb, blotted with anti-Ubiquitin mAb and similar results were observed. The relative densities of the gel bands Treatment of neurons with IFN-\u03b3 induces LMP2 mRNA level. Total RNA was isolated from NB41A3 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 0, 12, 24 or 36 hours. RT-PCR was performed. Product sizes are as follows: LMP2-237bp; \u03b2 -actin-540bp. Each sample was amplified in duplicate. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. (*p<0.01); IFN-\u03b3 induces LMP7 in NB41A3 cells. NB41A3 Cells were treated with IFN-\u03b3 20ng/ml for 24 hours, 48hours and 72 hours. LMP 7 levels were tested by Western blot. Raw 264.7 cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 24 hours serve as positive control for anti-LMP7 antibody (not shown). Data are representative of three experiments with consistent trends. B Immunoproteasome is generated in neurons with IFN-\u03b3 treatment. NB41A3 cells were treated with media (control), IFN-\u03b3 (12hours and 24hours) and IFN-\u03b2 (24hours). Whole lysates were extracted from each treatment. Proteasome 20S complex were purified from each lysate (200\u03bcg) by IP using anti-proteasome 20S pAb. The purified proteasome complex was boiled with dissociation sample buffer and the presence of the constitutive subunit \u03b1 5 and the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2, 7, 10 were detected by Western blot. Anti-GAPDH pAb was used in both IP and immunoblotting as assay control.\n\nTo eliminate the heavy and light IgG chains in the immunoblotting, Rabbit Trueblot TM beads and secondary antibody set was used whenever a rabbit anti-mouse primary antibody was used for blot. IFN-\u03b2 treatment is used as positive control. Same results were observed in 3 independent experiments.
