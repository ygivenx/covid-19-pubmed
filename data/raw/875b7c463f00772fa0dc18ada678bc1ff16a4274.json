COVID-19 has contributed to an enormous adverse impact globally. Hitherto, there have been 79,331 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,595 deaths globally as of February 25 th , 2020 [2] .\n\nThe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are, according to the latest reports [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , largely heterogeneous. On admission, 20-51% of patients reported as having at least one comorbidity, with diabetes (10-20%), hypertension (10-15%) and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (7-40%) being most common [3, 4, 6] . Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of any comorbidity has been associated with a 3.4-fold increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with H7N9 infection [9] . Similar with influenza [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , Severe Acute .

Nonetheless, previous studies have been certain limitations in study design including the relatively small sample sizes and single center observations. Studies that address these limitations is needed to explore for the factors underlying the adverse impact of COVID-19.\n\nOur objective was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by stratification according to the presence and category of comorbidity, thus unraveling the subpopulations with poorer prognosis.\n\nThis was a retrospective cohort study that collected data from patients with COVID-19 throughout China, under the coordination of the National Health Commission which mandated the reporting of clinical information from individual designated hospitals which admitted patients with COVID-19.\n\nAfter careful medical chart review, we compiled the clinical data of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases from 575 hospitals between November 21 st , 2019 and January 31 st , 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the World Health Organization interim guidance [25] .\n\nConfirmed cases denoted the patients whose high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay findings for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were positive [3] .

Manifestations on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) was summarized by integrating the documentation or description in medical charts and, if available, a further review by our medical staff. Major disagreement of the radiologic manifestations between the two reviewers was resolved by consultation with another independent reviewer. Because disease severity reportedly predicted poorer clinical outcomes of avian influenza [9], patients were classified as having severe or non-severe COVID-19 based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia because of its global acceptance [26] .\n\nComorbidities were determined based on patient's self-report on admission. Comorbidities were initially treated as a categorical variable (Yes vs. No) , and subsequently classified based on the number (Single vs. Multiple). Furthermore, comorbidities were sorted according to the organ systems (i.e. respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine). Comorbidities that were classified into the same organ system (i.e. coronary heart disease, hypertension) would be merged into a single category.\n\nThe primary endpoint of our study was a composite measure which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. This composite measure was adopted because all individual components were serious outcomes of H7N9 infections [9] . Secondary endpoints mainly included the mortality rate, and the time from symptom onset to reaching to the composite endpoints.\n\n.

The most common symptom was fever on or after hospitalization (88.0%), followed by dry cough (70.2%). Fatigue (42.8%) and productive cough (36.0%) were less common. At least one abnormal chest CT manifestation (including ground-glass opacities, pulmonary infiltrates and interstitial disorders) was identified in more than 70% of patients.\n\nSevere cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints during the study ( Table 1) .\n\nOf the 1,590 cases, 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. \n\nWe have further identified 130 (8.2%) patients who reported having two or more comorbidities.

As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities (Figure 2 ).\n\nOur study is the first nationwide investigation that systematically evaluates the impact of comorbidities on the clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with COVID-19 in China.\n\nCirculatory and endocrine comorbidities were common among patients with COVID-19. Patients with at least one comorbidity, or more even so, were associated with poor clinical outcomes. These findings have provided further objective evidence, with a large sample size and extensive coverage of the geographic regions across China, to take into account baseline comorbid diseases in the comprehensive risk assessment of prognosis among patients with COVID-19 on hospital admission.\n\nOverall, our findings have echoed the recently published studies in terms of the commonness of comorbidities in patients with .

There has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted. For instance, diabetes [29] and COPD [30] frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases. Therefore, patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being. Importantly, we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity. Our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with COVID-19.\n\nOur findings suggested that patients with comorbidities had greater disease severity compared with those without. A greater number of comorbidities correlated with greater disease severity of COVID-19. The public health implication of our study was that proper triage of patients should be implemented in out-patient clinics or on hospital admission by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes during the progression of COVID-19. A multidisciplinary team with specialists would be needed to manage the comorbid conditions in a timely fashion. Moreover, patients with COIVD-19\n\n.

However, significant underreporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission. Moreover, the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing. More studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted. As with other observational studies, our findings did not provide direct inference about the causation or reverse causation of comorbidities and the poor clinical outcomes.\n\nComorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes. A thorough assessment of comorbidities may help establish risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 upon hospital admission.\n\nWe thank the hospital staff (see Supplementary Appendix for the full list) for .
