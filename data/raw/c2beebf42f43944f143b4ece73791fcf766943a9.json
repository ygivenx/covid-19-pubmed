{"title": "Synthesis, antiviral, cytotoxic and cytostatic evaluation of N 1 -(phosphonoalkyl)uracil derivatives", "body": "Acyclic nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been used in clinical practice for almost 50 years and have become cornerstones in the treatment of patients with viral infections [1] [2] [3] . Nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir as well as acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), namely adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir, belong to the most widely used antiviral drugs ( Fig. 1 ) [4] [5] [6] . The ribose moiety in natural nucleosides/ nucleotides was replaced by linear or branched aliphatic units to obtain analogues with specific activity following activation by viral and/or cellular kinases. The antiviral activity of these compounds relies on enzyme inhibition or on incorporation as active metabolites into the viral nucleic acids resulting in inhibition of viral genome replication.\n\nIn the last decade, several new drugs, including nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, have been approved for the treatment of viral infections and in cancer chemotherapy. Many nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and their derivatives are currently under preclinical and clinical trials [7] which demonstrates how rapidly this area of research grows. However, some of these analogues have poor oral bioavailability and are associated with toxicity, limiting their application for treatment of cancer and viral infections. Moreover, a long-term treatment with antiviral drugs may result in lower sensitivity of the viruses to chemotherapeutics (drug resistance) [8, 9] . For this reason, a search for new compounds with higher antiviral and antitumor activities, good bioavailability, better solubility, and proper balance between efficacy and long-term toxicity still continues.\n\nThe known synthetic strategies to ANPs commonly apply alkylation of heterocyclic bases [10] while the construction of nucleobase skeletons from the appropriate terminal primary amines has been less frequently used [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Herein, we report on the efficient synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of acyclic nucleotide analogues by application of the latter approach (Scheme 1).\n\nx-Aminoalkylphosphonates can be prepared by several methods. Arbuzov reaction [16] of N-(x-bromoalkyl)phthalimides with trialkyl phosphites seems to be most frequently applied. Alternatively, x-aminoalkylphosphonates can be synthesized from nitriles [17] or from xazidophosphonates employing hydrogenolysis [18] .\n\nDiethyl aminoalkylphosphonates 2a-2d (aminomethyl-, 2-aminoethyl-, 3-aminopropyl-, and 4-aminobutylphosphonates), used in this study, are known and have already been described in the literature [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Thus, diethyl aminomethylphosphonate (2a) was prepared in total 90 % yield from N-(bromomethyl)phthalimide followed by the treatment with hydrazine [19] [20] [21] whereas x-aminoalkylphosphonates 2b-2d were synthesized from the corresponding x-azidoalkylphosphonates 1b-1d [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] by catalytic hydrogenation [23, 26] . However, several literature reports [33, 34] noticed the formation of significant amounts of symmetrical secondary amines as by-products during hydrogenolysis of azides depending on the azide concentration and the azide to catalyst ratio. When xazidophosphonates 1b-1d were subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of 10 % Pd-C, symmetrical secondary amines 3b-3d contaminated (11-33 %) the major phosphonates 2b-2d as judged from the 31 P NMR spectra (Scheme 2). The mixtures of x-aminoalkylphosphonates 2b-2d containing various amounts of symmetrical secondary amines 3b-3d were separated on silica gel columns.\n\nAlkylation of nucleobases with substituted alkylphosphonates is generally recognized as a capricious process since dealkylation of phosphonate esters accompany the formation of a carbon-nucleobase bond and this was the primary reason to replace O,O-dimethyl and O,O-diethyl esters with O,O-diisopropyl phosphonates [35, 36] . Based on this experience and that of other groups, we concluded that the alternative approach to independently construct the pyrimidine ring through functionalization of xaminoalkylphosphonates is more feasible than the alkylation.\n\nThe N 1 -(phosphonoalkyl)uracils 5a-5d were synthesized from x-aminoalkylphosphonates 2b-2d in a two-step procedure which involved reaction with (E)-3-ethoxyacryloyl isocyanate [37] in situ generated from (E)-3ethoxyacryloyl chloride [38] [39] [40] and silver cyanate followed by the uracil ring closure in the presence of 2 M H 2 SO 4 (Scheme 3) [18, 39, 40] .\n\nThe conversion of uracil phosphonates 5a-5d into 5-chlorouracils 6a-6d and 5-bromouracils 8a-8d was achieved by treatment with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) [41] and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) [41] respectively, \n\nReagents and conditions: a. H 2 , 10% Pd-C, EtOH, r.t. 20 h whereas 5-iodouracils 9a-9d were synthesized using iodine and cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) [42] (Scheme 4). Although iodination and bromination of uracils 5a-5d proceeded regioselectively at C5, chlorination of uracil phosphonates 5c, 5d under the applied conditions provided mixtures of C5 and C6 regioisomers 7c, 7d in an approximately 8:2 ratio.\n\nMoreover, based on the literature report [43] and on our previous observations regarding the effect of the benzoyl substituent at N-3 of a nucleobase on the antiviral activity [29, 44] , the N 3 -benzoyluracil analogues 10a-10d were synthesized from phosphonates 5a-5d as shown on Scheme 4.\n\nStructures and purity of all synthesized compounds were established by 1 H, 31 P and 13 C NMR and IR techniques as well as by elemental analysis.\n\nAll the synthesized compounds 5a-5d, 6a-6d, and 8a-10d were evaluated for their antiviral activities against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses, using the following cell- Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), dextran sulfate (molecular weight 5000, DS-5000), ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and rimantadine were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus-plaque formation (VZV) or virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50 % (other viruses). It was found that the acyclic phosphonate analogues 10a and 10d containing the N 3benzoyluracil group as a modified nucleobase exhibited noticeable activity. Thus, compound 10a showed activity against cytomegalovirus (AD-169 strain) in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells (EC 50 = 45 lM), whereas compound 10d proved to be active against VZV (TK ? strain OKA and TKstrain 07-1) with EC 50 = 43 and 53 lM, respectively. The antiviral activity of compound 10d against VZV TKstrain 07-1 appeared to be slightly better than the activity of acyclovir and brivudin used as reference compounds (EC 50 = 160 and 103 lM, respectively). To rationalize the observed activity of the N 3benzoyl derivatives 10a and 10d one can refer to their easier transport through cell membranes in comparison to the precursors 5a and 5d which appeared inactive. After entering into the cell debenzoylation would provide nucleoside analogues capable of Watson-Crick bas pairing. Our previous results [44] support this conclusion.\n\nThe cytotoxicity of the test compounds toward uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), causing a 50 % decrease in cell viability was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay system. None of the tested compounds affected cell morphology of HEL, HeLa, Vero, MDCK, and CRFK cells (MCC or CC 50 ) at compound concentrations up to 100 lM.\n\nThe cytostatic activity of the tested compounds was defined as the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), or compound concentration causing a 50 % decrease in cell proliferation. IC 50 values were determined against murine leukemia L1210 cells, human lymphocyte CEM cells and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Several synthesized compounds showed marginal inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells at concentrations lower than 200 lM (Table 1) .\n\nA series of N 1 -(phosphonoalkyl)uracils 5a-5d has been efficiently obtained from x-aminoalkylphosphonates 2a-2d in a two-step process which involved a reaction with (E)-3ethoxyacryloyl isocyanate followed by the uracil ring closure. The uracil phosphonates 5a-5d were successfully transformed into 5-chloro-, 5-bromo-, and 5-iodouracils as well as N 3 -benzoyluracils. All synthesized compounds were tested in vitro for their antiviral activities against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses and compound 10a was slightly active against human cytomegalovirus in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 = 45 lM) while 10d showed activity against both TK ? and TK-VZV strains with EC 50 values of 43 lM (Oka strain) and of 53 lM (07-1 strain), which was two to threefold better than the potency of acyclovir and brivudin against 07-1 (EC 50 = 160 and 103 lM, respectively).\n\nAmong them, several compounds exhibited a very poor inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) at a concentration lower than 200 lM. In contrast, none of the compounds affected the proliferation of CEM cells and L1210 cells up to a concentration of 250 lM.

The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h (murine leukemia L1210 cells) or 72 h (human lymphocytic CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO 2 -controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter.
