Nevertheless, the condition is relatively common with a significantly higher ageadjusted annual incidence in African-Americans (35.5 cases per 100,000) versus Caucasian-Americans (10.9 cases per 100,000). An estimated one million people in the U. S. have this disease. Based on the current U.S. population of 315,556,000, there will be approximately 38,605 new cases of sarcoidosis this year and just over 1000 (2.6%) will die of the illness. 1, 2 The fundamental pathologic abnormality in the disease is the formation of non-caseating epitheliod granulomas, which usually confine poorly soluble foreign material that simply cannot be removed by a single phagocytic cell. The key feature in sarcoidosis is activated CD4+ T cells which differentiate into type 1 helper T cells (Th1), secreting interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3, augmenting macrophage TNF-\u03b1, and amplifying the local cellular immune response. 3, 4 This granulomatous inflammation interferes with local tissue homeostasis leading to organ impairment.\n\nSince sarcoidosis primarily involves the lungs, eyes and skin, attention has focused on airborne environmental antigens that might trigger this presumed hypersensitivity response with its T cell-mediated cellular immune response. 3 Similar granulomatous responses can be seen from a variety of infectious agents including mycobacteria, parasites (schistosoma), and fungi (coccidiomycosis). Early studies reported associations with non-infective agents including beryllium, zirconium, aluminum, wood-burning stoves, tree pollen, clay soil, talc, insecticides, inorganic particles, and moldy environments, but none of these theoretical causes has endured. 3, 5, 6 There is also a several-fold increased incidence of sarcoidosis occurring in siblings and parents, as well as a consistent strong association with specific gene products such as class I and class II HLA antigens, which may add to the familial connection.\n\nAlthough no infectious agent has been cultured directly from sarcoidosis tissues, clinical and immunologic characteristics of the disorder provide the strongest support for a microbial etiology, at least in some patients. [5] [6] [7] To explore a possible infectious cause in patients seen at the Moffitt Cancer Center, we correlated the clinical presentation and long-term follow-up of sarcoidosis patients with the presence of bacterial DNA in archived, surgically-resected mediastinal lymph nodes. Results from sarcoidosis nodes were compared to control lymph nodes resected at the time of lung surgery in node-negative, Stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients.\n\nTissue and clinical data in this case-control study was obtained after approval by the Moffitt Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee Protocol MCC #16131 and the University of South Florida IRB Protocol #108656.\n\nBy searching the Moffitt Cancer Center surgical pathology database between January 1, 2000 and April 1, 2010, we retrospectively identified 30 randomly-chosen patients who were diagnosed with sarcoidosis based on the typical radiographic and clinical presentation, and the histologic finding of non-caseating epitheliod granulomata in lymph nodes obtained sterilely only by mediastinoscopy, to avoid possible microorganism contamination by endoscopic biopsies. Special stains for microorganisms were negative on the specimens.

All histopathologic specimens were reviewed by one of us (P.S.) to reconfirm the diagnosis made originally by departmental pathologists at Moffitt.\n\nTo insure sterile collection, all control specimens were taken from lymph nodes removed at open thoracotomy by one of us (L.R.) in 30 (1:1 match with cases) randomly-chosen patients with Stage IA non-small lung cancer. Lymph nodes were selected only from patients with small peripheral tumors, no obstructive atalectasis, and no evidence of active infection. One of us (P.S) reviewed all control lymph node histology to verify there were no metastases, acute inflammation, or granulomata.\n\nClinical data on the patient demographics, initial presenting symptoms and objective findings were extracted from the electronic medical record on all sarcoidosis patients by one of us (L.R.). Patients were staged using the modified Scadding radiographic staging system: stage 0 normal chest x-ray; stage 1 hilar and mediastinal adenopathy alone; stage 2 adenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates; stage 3 pulmonary infiltrates alone; and stage 4 pulmonary fibrosis. 4 Longterm follow-up clinical status and subsequent treatment regimens for all sarcoidosis patients were \n\nDe-identified, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of lymph nodes from sarcoidosis and control patients were sent to the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Microbiology at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA), where investigators were blinded as to the identity of the specimens. The DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded blocks was performed after paraffin was removed by incubation in xylene. 8 \n\nThe 16S gene fragment was amplified as previously described. 8 The hsp65 gene was amplified using TB11 and TB12 primers, and the RNA polymerase subunit gene (rpoB) was amplified using MF and MR primers. 9 The amplified products were then sequenced using the Big Dye Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the vendor's recommended protocol. The sequences of two strands were assembled into doubled-stranded contig using Sequencher software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). The final sequences were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health) database using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to identify the amplified DNA. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The primary variable to be compared between the sarcoidosis and controls patients is the number of patients in each group with bacterial DNA found in lymph nodes. The N-1 Two Proportion test for comparing independent proportions for small sample sizes is used to compare the results between the two groups. 10 All numerical data is expressed as the mean + standard deviation.\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the 30 sarcoidosis study patients are found in Table 1 . \n\nAt the time of initial presentation, 19 of 30 patients (63.3%) were symptomatic, usually with multiple symptoms. Of these 19 patients, the duration of symptoms before diagnosis was a mean 22.1 + 30.0 months (median 12 months, range 1-120 months). The most common symptoms were night sweats 9 (30.0%); dyspnea 8 (26.7%); chest pain 7 (23.3%); chest tightness 5 (16.7); fevers 3 (10.0%); fatigue 3 (10%); skin rash 2 (6.7%); and stomach ulcer 2 (6.7%). Other symptoms present in at least one patient include: dyspepsia, dysphagia, diarrhea, 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   constipation, kidney stones, joint and muscle pains, orthopnea, nose and mouth skin lesions, intermittent bronchospasm, malaise, and weight loss.\n\nCo-morbidities: asthma 2 (6.7%); coronary artery disease 2 (6.7%); diabetes mellitus 4 (13.3%); hypertension 5 (16.6) , and one each of gout, hypothyroidism, eczema, fibromyalgia, and Crohn's disease. Malignancies were extremely common with over half (53.3%) having a current or prior tumor. The malignancies prior to or at the time of presentation are: breast 3, melanoma 3, uterine 2, sarcomas 3, tonsil 1, ovary 1, adrenal 1, colon 1, and Hodgkin's lymphoma 1.\n\nChest Figure 2 for typical example), and glucose avidity was seen in the abnormal abdominal nodes in the 4 patients with radiographic adenopathy below the diaphragm.\n\nTwelve of 30 patients had lymph node tissue sent at the time of mediastinoscopy for aerobic, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. All cultures showed no growth after six weeks incubation. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y nodes is a real finding in our study (and in over 35 prior published studies) and they are not just processing contaminants, therefore pointing to microorganisms as potential contributors to the genesis of this disease. In addition, Propionibacterium acnes DNA was found in only 1 of 30 (3.3%) control lymph nodes in our study, in stark contrast to Ishige and associates in Japan who reported this microorganism is an ubiquitous pulmonary lymph node commensal found in 8 of 11\n\n(72.7%) non-sarcoid patients in their study. 16 Such a very high positive result in their study is likely due to either geographical/ethic/racial differences or potential contamination in processing.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing findings came from correlation of the PCR findings with the clinical information. All patients with lymph nodes containing bacteria DNA on presentation were also highly symptomatic and 75% of them had the poorer-prognosis radiographic stage II findings. Moreover, after a median 4 years follow-up, all bacterial DNA-positive patients were still highly symptomatic. This striking correlation strongly suggests that demonstration of bacterial DNA by PCR in lymph nodes on initial presentation is an adverse prognostic factor and makes it unlikely that these patients will have a spontaneous remission. \n\nMany pathogenic microorganisms such as Tropheryma whippelii (Whipple's disease) or coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome) cannot be grown directly in culture or they are very slow growing or fastidious such as Mycobacterium leprae (leprosy). 5 In these instances, detection and identification rely on molecular mechanisms such PCR used in this study.\n\nNevertheless, the molecular approach has distinct limitations including possible false-positive results secondary to contaminated PCR reagents, the paraffin imbedding process, or postembedding handling and processing of the paraffin block. However in our study, thirty control lymph nodes were processed in an identical manner and bacterial DNA was detected in only 2/30 (6.6%), significantly less than the sarcoidosis nodes (36.7%, p = 0.00516), suggesting that contamination is unlikely to account for the findings.\n\nAdditionally, the number of lymph nodes positive for bacterial DNA may be significantly underestimated because of the tendency of the formalin-fixation and paraffin embedding process to breakdown prokaryotic DNA. Also, over time other investigators have found degradation of the prokaryotic bacteria DNA (especially mycobacteria) with aging of the paraffin-embedded specimens. 14 Of note, the only 3 sarcoidosis lymph nodes positive for mycobacteria in our study were less than 3 years old when evaluated by PCR. Had we used fresh lymph node tissue like Drake and associates 14 who found 60% PCR positive for mycobacteria species, there may have been a much higher rate of positive bacterial DNA results (particularly mycobacteria) in our study. \n\nSarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease primarily involving the lungs, lymph nodes and other organs that appears to be the result of an exuberant T cell and macrophage immunologic response to the continued presentation of a poorly degradable antigen. Numerous non-infective agents have been implicated based on epidemiologic basis but none have stood up to scrutiny. 1, 3, 5 The focus over the last two decades has been on infective agents that might trigger sarcoidosis, with the strongest suspects found in the mycobacteria family and the common commensal Propionibacterium acnes. And like classical tuberculosis where up to 90% of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain in remission without treatment, 17 sarcoidosis also has a 65-80% spontaneous remission rate without treatment. 1 One may speculate that similar to tuberculosis, the immune system, after its initial response to a triggering microorganism, is successful in eradicating the agent and the immune response subsides. Then in the 20% or so with persistent and progressive sarcoidosis, the organism remains viable and perpetuates the destructive immune response.\n\nSymptomatic sarcoidosis is usually treated with various anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, methotrexate and TNF-inhibitors (biologics). 18 The similarities in immunologic abnormalities and treatment to another debilitating granulomatous disease, Crohn's disease, are striking. 19 Granulomatous ileitis (Crohn's) has been suspected by many investigators to be the result of a chronic infection with the obligate intracellular microorganism Mycobacterium avian subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), that is known to cause a granulomatous ileitis in cattle and other ruminants called Johne's disease. 20 Although the classical treatment of Crohn's disease has been with immunosuppressive agents just like sarcoidosis, many recent studies suggest a much more effective treatment with less side [21] [22] [23] In fact, many in the field suspect that this intracellular organism (MAP) that resides in the macrophage impairs the normal autophagy that would usually eradicate the organism. 21 Agents that enhance autophagy such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandersterone, 24, 25 currently in human trials, may prove effective along with antibiotics in Crohn's disease. 21 Can some antibacterial/anti-mycobacterial regimen such as that used in Crohn's disease alter the natural history of sarcoidosis in chronically symptomatic patients? Sixty years ago a number of small trials using classical anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazide, streptomycin, or cortisone) were published with discouraging results. 26 However, atypical mycobacteria (rather than M. tuberculosis) that are more likely to be one of the etiologic agents in sarcoidosis, are almost all resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis agents such as isoniazid. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] And if other organisms such as Proprionibacterium acnes or perhaps cell-wall deficient (L-forms) bacteria trigger and perpetuate sarcoidosis in some individuals, then the standard anti-tuberculous drugs would also be ineffective.\n\nThe tetracycline derivatives (minocycline and doxycycline), as well as the anti-malarial drug chloroquine have been shown to be quite effective in treating cutaneous sarcoidosis. 33 Minocycline can produce complete responses in up two-thirds of cases, although it is debated whether this is an anti-microbial effect or an immunomodulating effect.\n\nOver the last three decades or more, numerous studies have examined every aspect of sarcoidosis including its dysfunctional immune response. The primary therapy is immune \n\nAuthor contributorship: Dr. Robinson had full access to all of the data in the study and takes full responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Also the mere physical presence of the bacterial DNA in the lymph nodes does not prove that the disease is caused by the microorganism.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, the number of lymph nodes positive for bacterial DNA may be significantly underestimated because of the tendency of the formalin-fixation and paraffin embedding process to breakdown prokaryotic DNA. The fundamental pathologic abnormality in the disease is the formation of non-caseating epitheliod granulomas, which usually confine poorly soluble foreign material that simply cannot be removed by a single phagocytic cell. The key feature in sarcoidosis is activated CD4+ T cells which differentiate into type 1 helper T cells (Th1), secreting interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3, augmenting macrophage TNF-\u03b1, and amplifying the local cellular immune response. 3, 4 This granulomatous inflammation interferes with local tissue homeostasis leading to organ impairment.\n\nSince sarcoidosis primarily involves the lungs, eyes and skin, attention has focused on airborne environmental antigens that might trigger this presumed hypersensitivity response with its T cell-mediated cellular immune response. 3 Similar granulomatous responses can be seen from a variety of infectious agents including mycobacteria, parasites (schistosoma), and fungi (coccidiomycosis).

This percentage of bacterial DNA-positive specimens falls in the range found in numerous prior published studies from the last two decades (using various methodologies), which range from 26%-80% positive (Table 3 5 ,7,14-17 ).\n\nFurthermore, atypical mycobacteria and Proprionibacterium acnes represented almost all DNA identified, also consistent with the findings of the multiple prior studies (Table 3) . Additionally identified were one skin and mucous membrane organism (Corynebacterium propinquum), and one aerobic Gram negative bacillus (Duganella zoogloeoides) that is usually found in aqueous environments. Interestingly, the latter patient (no. 13) with Duganella zoogloeoides was an asbestos technician originally from tropical Haiti. As a disclaimer, just the finding of DNA from a microorganism in lymph nodes does not tell us whether the viable organism is present or whether it caused the granulomatous reaction.\n\nSimilar to prior published studies summarized in Table 3 , significantly less (only 2 of 30 or 6.7%, p = 0.00516) of control lymph nodes resected at the time of lung cancer surgery showed nodes is a real finding in our study (and in over 35 prior published studies) and they are not just processing contaminants, therefore pointing to microorganisms as potential contributors to the genesis of this disease.

This striking correlation strongly suggests that demonstration of bacterial DNA by PCR in lymph nodes on initial presentation is an adverse prognostic factor and makes it unlikely that these patients will have a spontaneous remission. \n\nMany pathogenic microorganisms such as Mycobacterium leprae (leprosy) or coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome) cannot be grown directly in culture or they are very slow growing or difficult to culture such asTropheryma whippelii (Whipple's disease) . 5, 19 In these instances, detection and identification rely on molecular mechanisms such PCR used in this study. Nevertheless, the molecular approach has distinct limitations including possible falsepositive results secondary to contaminated PCR reagents, the paraffin imbedding process, or post-embedding handling and processing of the paraffin block. However in our study, thirty control lymph nodes were processed in an identical manner and bacterial DNA was detected in only 2/30 (6.6%), significantly less than the sarcoidosis nodes (36.7%, p = 0.00516), suggesting that contamination is unlikely to account for the findings. 16 Of note, the only 3 sarcoidosis lymph nodes positive for mycobacteria in our study were less than 3 years old when evaluated by PCR. Had we used fresh lymph node tissue like Drake and associates 16 who found 60% PCR positive for mycobacteria species, there may have been a much higher rate of positive bacterial DNA results (particularly mycobacteria) in our study.\n\nSarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease primarily involving the lungs, lymph nodes and other organs that appears to be the result of an exuberant T cell and macrophage immunologic response to the continued presentation of a poorly degradable antigen. Numerous non-infective agents have been implicated based on epidemiologic basis but none have stood up to scrutiny. 1, 3, 5 The focus over the last two decades has been on infective agents that might trigger sarcoidosis, with the strongest suspects found in the mycobacteria family and the common commensal Propionibacterium acnes. And like classical tuberculosis where up to 90% of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain in remission without treatment, 20 sarcoidosis also has a 65-80% spontaneous remission rate without treatment. 1 One may speculate that similar to tuberculosis, the immune system, after its initial response to a triggering microorganism, is successful in eradicating the agent and the immune response subsides. Then in the 20% or so with persistent and progressive sarcoidosis, the organism remains viable and perpetuates the destructive immune response.\n\nSymptomatic sarcoidosis is usually treated with various anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, methotrexate and TNF-inhibitors 21 The similarities in immunologic abnormalities and treatment to another debilitating granulomatous disease, Crohn's disease, are striking. 22 Granulomatous ileitis (Crohn's) has been suspected by many investigators to be the result of a chronic infection with the obligate intracellular microorganism Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), that is known to cause a granulomatous ileitis in cattle and other ruminants called Johne's disease. 23 Although the classical treatment of Crohn's disease has been with immunosuppressive agents just like with sarcoidosis, many recent studies suggest a much more effective treatment with less side effects may be a triple antibiotic regimen geared toward the putative triggering agent MAP. [24] [25] [26] In fact, many in the field suspect that this intracellular organism (MAP) that resides in the macrophage impairs the normal autophagy that would usually eradicate the organism. 24 Agents that enhance autophagy such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandersterone, 27, 28 currently in human trials, may prove effective along with antibiotics in Crohn's disease. 24 Can some antibacterial/anti-mycobacterial regimen such as that used in Crohn's disease alter the natural history of sarcoidosis in chronically symptomatic patients? Sixty years ago a number of small trials using classical anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazide, streptomycin, or cortisone) were published with discouraging results. 29 However, atypical mycobacteria (rather than M. tuberculosis) that are more likely to be one of the etiologic agents in sarcoidosis, are almost all resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis agents such as isoniazid. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] And if other organisms such as Proprionibacterium acnes or perhaps cell-wall deficient (L-forms) bacteria trigger and perpetuate sarcoidosis in some individuals, then the standard anti-tuberculous drugs would also be ineffective.\n\nThe tetracycline derivatives (minocycline and doxycycline), as well as the anti-malarial drug chloroquine have been shown to be quite effective in treating cutaneous sarcoidosis. 36 \n\nOver the last three decades or more, numerous studies have examined every aspect of sarcoidosis including its dysfunctional immune response. The primary therapy is immune suppression in various forms but this treats only symptoms and does not seem to alter the natural Proprionibacterium acnes, and more of these molecular studies is not likely warranted.\n\nPerhaps we should follow the lead of the Crohn's disease gastroenterologists 24 Dr. SenGupta: Contributed to the data acquisition, analysis and interpretation; and revision of the article prior to publication.\n\nContributed to the data acquisition, analysis and interpretation.\n\nDr. Sandin: Contributed to the conception, hypothesis delineation, and design of the study; and revision of the article prior to publication.\n\nThere is no additional data available.\n\nThe authors report that no potential conflicts of interest exist with any companies/organizations whose products or services may be discussed in this article.\n\nThe material is the result of work supported with resources and use of facilities at the \u2022 Sarcoidosis is a common yet incurable, chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology treated with non-specific anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive drugs.\n\n\u2022 Persistently symptomatic patients worsen despite treatment with a disabling, potentially fatal clinical course.\n\n\u2022 We propose that sarcoidosis results from a chronic granulomatous infection from a treatable pathogen in certain susceptible individuals, much like granulomatous ileitis (Crohn's disease) which shows an encouraging response to multi-drug antimicrobial therapy.\n\n\u2022 This case-control, retrospective study correlated clinical outcomes with the presence of detectable bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis lymph nodes versus control lymph nodes.\n\n\u2022 The entire group of sarcoidosis patients had significantly more detectable bacterial DNA than control patient lymph nodes. \u2022 Nevertheless, the molecular approach to bacterial detection has distinct limitations including possible false-positive results secondary to contaminated PCR reagents, the paraffin imbedding process, or post-embedding handling and processing of the paraffin block. Also the mere physical presence of the bacterial DNA in the lymph nodes does not prove that the disease is caused by the microorganism.\n\n\u2022 Additionally, the number of lymph nodes positive for bacterial DNA may be significantly underestimated because of the tendency of the formalin-fixation and paraffin embedding process to breakdown prokaryotic DNA.\n\nFor peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The fundamental pathologic abnormality in the disease is the formation of non-caseating epitheliod granulomas, which usually confine poorly soluble foreign material that simply cannot be removed by a single phagocytic cell. The key feature in sarcoidosis is activated CD4+ T cells which differentiate into type 1 helper T cells (Th1), secreting interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3, augmenting macrophage TNF-\u03b1, and amplifying the local cellular immune response. 3, 4 This granulomatous inflammation interferes with local tissue homeostasis leading to organ impairment.\n\nSince sarcoidosis primarily involves the lungs, eyes and skin, attention has focused on airborne environmental antigens that might trigger this presumed hypersensitivity response with its T cell-mediated cellular immune response. 3 Similar granulomatous responses can be seen from a variety of infectious agents including mycobacteria, parasites (schistosoma), and fungi (coccidiomycosis). Early studies reported associations with non-infective agents including beryllium, zirconium, aluminum, wood-burning stoves, tree pollen, clay soil, talc, insecticides, inorganic particles, and moldy environments, but none of these theoretical causes has endured. 3, 5, 6 There is also a several-fold increased incidence of sarcoidosis occurring in siblings 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y and parents, as well as a consistent strong association with specific gene products such as class I and class II HLA antigens, which may add to the familial connection.\n\nAlthough no infectious agent has been cultured directly from sarcoidosis tissues, clinical and immunologic characteristics of the disorder provide the strongest support for a microbial etiology, at least in some patients. [5] [6] [7] To explore a possible infectious cause in patients seen at the Moffitt Cancer Center, we correlated the clinical presentation and long-term follow-up of sarcoidosis patients with the presence of bacterial DNA in archived, surgically-resected mediastinal lymph nodes. Results from sarcoidosis nodes were compared to control lymph nodes resected at the time of lung surgery in node-negative, Stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients.\n\nTissue and clinical data in this case-control study was obtained after approval by the Moffitt Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee Protocol MCC #16131 and the University of South Florida IRB Protocol #108656.\n\nBy searching the Moffitt Cancer Center surgical pathology database between January 1, 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Inhibition was ruled out by checking the ability of exogenously added target DNA to be amplified in the same PCR mix that contained DNA extracted from clinical specimen. The 16S gene fragment was amplified as previously described. 8 The hsp65 gene was amplified using TB11 and TB12 primers, and the RNA polymerase subunit gene (rpoB) was amplified using MF and MR primers. 9 The amplified products were then sequenced using the \n\nThe primary variable to be compared between the sarcoidosis and controls patients is the number of patients in each group with bacterial DNA found in lymph nodes. The N-1 Two\n\nProportion test for comparing independent proportions for small sample sizes is used to compare the results between the two groups. 10 Additionally, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. 11 All numerical data is expressed as the mean + standard deviation. Co-morbidities: asthma 2 (6.7%); coronary artery disease 2 (6.7%); diabetes mellitus 4 (13.3%); hypertension 5 (16.6), and one each of gout, hypothyroidism, eczema, fibromyalgia, and Crohn's disease. Malignancies were extremely common with over half (53.3%) having a current or prior tumor, a finding noted previously by others. 12 The malignancies prior to or at the time of presentation are: breast 3, melanoma 3, uterine 2, sarcomas 3, tonsil 1, ovary 1, adrenal 1, colon 1, and Hodgkin's lymphoma 1.\n\nChest \n\nLong \n\nThe objectives of this case-control study were two-fold: a) evaluate sterilely-resected lymph nodes in documented sarcoidosis patients for the presence of bacterial DNA by molecular methods and b) correlate the results with clinical characteristics of the patients.\n\nAs expected, our molecular testing using PCR demonstrated that over one-third of sarcoidosis patients (36.7%) had evidence of bacterial DNA in the nodes, indicating either past or current involvement with these microorganisms. This percentage of bacterial DNA-positive specimens falls in the range found in numerous prior published studies from the last two decades (using various methodologies), which range from 26%-80% positive (Table 3 5 ,7,14-17 ).\n\nFurthermore, atypical mycobacteria and Proprionibacterium acnes represented almost all DNA identified, also consistent with the findings of the multiple prior studies (Table 3) . Additionally identified were one skin and mucous membrane organism (Corynebacterium propinquum), and one aerobic Gram negative bacillus (Duganella zoogloeoides) that is usually found in aqueous environments. Interestingly, the latter patient (no. 13) with Duganella zoogloeoides was an asbestos technician originally from tropical Haiti. As a disclaimer, just the finding of DNA from a microorganism in lymph nodes does not tell us whether the viable organism is present nor whether it caused the granulomatous reaction.\n\nSimilar to prior published studies summarized in Table 3 This difference strongly suggests that the demonstration of bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis lymph 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y nodes is a real finding in our study (and in over 35 prior published studies) and they are not just processing contaminants, therefore pointing to microorganisms as potential contributors to the genesis of this disease. In addition, Propionibacterium acnes DNA was found in only 1 of 30 (3.3%) control lymph nodes in our study, in stark contrast to Ishige and associates in Japan who reported this microorganism is an ubiquitous pulmonary lymph node commensal found in 8 of 11\n\n(72.7%) non-sarcoid patients in their study. 18 Such a very high positive result in their study is likely due to either geographical/ethic/racial differences or potential contamination in processing.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing findings came from correlation of the PCR findings with the clinical information. All patients with lymph nodes containing bacteria DNA on presentation were also highly symptomatic and 75% of them had the poorer-prognosis radiographic stage II findings. Moreover, after a median 4 years follow-up, all bacterial DNA-positive patients were still highly symptomatic. This striking correlation strongly suggests that demonstration of bacterial DNA by PCR in lymph nodes on initial presentation is an adverse prognostic factor and makes it unlikely that these patients will have a spontaneous remission. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 specimens. 16 Of note, the only 3 sarcoidosis lymph nodes positive for mycobacteria in our study were less than 3 years old when evaluated by PCR.
