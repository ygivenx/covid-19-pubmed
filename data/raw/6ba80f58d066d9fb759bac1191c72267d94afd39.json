Since the beginning of the 76 outbreak, the efficiency of nucleic acid testing has been dependent on several 77 rate-limiting factors, including availability and quantity of the testing kits in the 78 affected area. More importantly, the quality, stability and reproducibility of the 79 detection kits are questionable. The impact of methodology, disease stages, 80 specimen collection methods, nucleic acid extraction methods, and the 81 amplification system are all determinant factors for the accuracy of test results. 82 Conservative estimates of the detection rate of nucleic acid are low (between 83 30-50%) [7, 8, 9] , and tests need to be repeated several times in many cases 84 before they can be confirmed.\n\nRadiological imaging is also a major diagnostic tool for COVID-19. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is There are a number of features for identifying viral pathogens on the basis 104 of imaging patterns, which are associated with their specific pathogenesis [16] .\n\nThe hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and 106 ground glass opacity in early stages\u3002 As the disease progresses, multiple 107 ground glass and infiltrates in both lungs will appear [3] . the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023028 doi: medRxiv preprint 7\n\nRetrospective collection of datasets. 121 We retrospectively collected CT images from 259 patients, in which the the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023028 doi: medRxiv preprint 8 training cohort (n=320 from Center 1), one internal validation cohort (n=455 142 from Center 1) and one external validation cohort (n=290 from Center 2 and 3).\n\nFor a ROI, it is sized approximately from 395*223 to 636*533 pixels.\n\nOverview of the proposed architecture 145 Our systematic pipeline for the prediction architecture is depicted in Figure   146 1.

Therefore, further 349 optimizing and testing this system is warranted.
