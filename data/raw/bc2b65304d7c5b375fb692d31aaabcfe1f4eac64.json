{"title": "Deficiency of Melanoma Differentiation-associated Protein 5 Results in Exacerbated Chronic Postviral Lung Inflammation", "body": "Methods: MDA5-deficient or control mice were infected with Sendai virus. The acute inflammatory response was evaluated by profiling chemokine and cytokine expression and by characterizing the composition of the cellular infiltrate. The impact of MDA5 on chronic lung pathology and function was evaluated through histological studies, degree of oxygen saturation, and responsiveness to carbachol.\n\nMeasurements and Main Results: MDA5 deficiency resulted in normal virus replication and in a distinct profile of chemokines and cytokines that associated with acute lung neutropenia and enhanced accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages. Diminished expression of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines was also observed in cells infected with influenza virus, suggesting a key role of MDA5 in driving the early accumulation of neutrophils at the infection site. The biased acute inflammatory response of MDA5-deficient mice led to an enhanced chronic lung inflammation, epithelial cell hyperplasia, airway hyperreactivity, and diminished blood oxygen saturation.\n\nConclusions: MDA5 modulates the development of chronic lung inflammation by regulating the early inflammatory response in the lung. Keywords: respiratory virus; chronic lung disease; innate immunity; paramyxovirus\n\nScientific Knowledge on the Subject: Hospitalizations due to chronic postviral lung inflammatory diseases remain a major health burden, and better understanding of the innate immune mechanisms driving these diseases is required for the development of suitable therapies. Cellular proteins specialized in recognizing the infecting pathogens play a critical role in establishing and directing the quality of the host immune response to infection. Little is known of the impact of these early immune elements on the development of chronic lung disease.\n\nWhat This Study Adds to the Field: This work demonstrates that signaling by the viral sensor molecule melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) is critical for protection from the development of severe chronic postviral lung disease. MDA5 modulates the quality of the inflammatory infiltrate, independently of the control of virus replication. MDA5 promotes the acute recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and regulates the accumulation of pathogenic alternatively activated macrophages that promote chronic lung disease.\n\nInfection with respiratory syncytial virus or other common paramyxoviruses leads to the development and exacerbation of chronic lung conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and fibrosis, in susceptible individuals (1) (2) (3) . Hospitalizations due to severe manifestations of these lung conditions after virus infections remain a major health burden. Better understanding of the mechanisms driving these diseases is required for the development of suitable therapies.\n\nRecent evidence indicates that virusinduced chronic lung disorders are mostly driven by mechanisms of the innate immune system (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . For example, in mice, development of chronic airway disease after infection with Sendai virus (SeV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome virus is mediated by alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) (7, 9) , and associations between the presence of AAMs and the incidence of COPD and asthma have been reported in humans (7, 10) .\n\nGermline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the first line of defense against infections. Among PRRs, the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) detect molecular motifs present in viral oligonucleotides. RIG-I and MDA5 signal through a common pathway mediated by the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) that culminates in the expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory genes, including chemokines and cytokines, that recruit and activate leukocytes (11) . According to current paradigms, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize distinct virus molecular motifs present in different families of viruses. However, accumulating evidence indicates that a number of viruses can be recognized by both intracellular sensors (12) . For example, MDA5 is involved in sensing SeV (13, 14) , a paramyxovirus that bears a negative sense RNA genome and was originally classified as a RIG-I trigger (15, 16) . Whether RIG-I and MDA5 have unique nonredundant activities and whether any of these activities affects the development of chronic lung disease after viral infection is unknown.\n\nSeV causes bronchiolitis and persistent airway hyperreactivity in mice, providing the best available experimental model for virus-induced chronic lung disease (7, 17) . Here we show that MDA5 deficiency leads to an altered inflammatory environment in the lung and to a striking shift in the expression of neutrophil-and monocyte/ lymphocyte-attracting chemokines. These alterations result in enhanced accumulation of AAMs, whereas viral clearance and type I IFN responses are unchanged. MDA5 knockout (KO) mice exhibited a significant chronic increase in mucus-producing goblet cells and in bronchial smooth muscle cell hyperplasia that associated with enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness and with an impaired ability to maintain blood oxygen saturation. Overall, this study shows that signaling by MDA5 modulates the accumulation of pathogenic AAMs in the lung and protects from the development of \n\nSeV strains 52 and Cantell and influenza virus PR8 were propagated and titrated in our laboratory as we have described (19, 20) . A detailed description of this procedure can be found in the online supplement. Cells were infected with the indicated doses of median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/cell. Mice were infected intranasally with 10 ID 50 of SeV strain 52 (10,000 TCID 50 /mouse) after anesthesia.\n\nBone marrow-derived dendritic cells were prepared according to a standard protocol (21) . The cells were used after 4 days of culture.\n\nLungs were flushed using media containing 2 mM L-glutamine ( Lungs were lavaged with 1 ml of sterile saline as previously described (22) . Total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was measured from the cell-free fraction by Bradford assay (Thermo Scientific).\n\nTotal RNA was purified from lungs using TRIzol (Life Technologies). RNA was reversed transcribed using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems; Life Technologies) and amplified with specific primers in the presence of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mixture (Applied Biosystems; Life Technologies). Normalization was conducted based on levels of Tuba1b and Rps11. Primer sequences are shown in Table 1 .\n\nSingle-lung-cell suspensions were stained with the following antibodies: CD11b (M1/ 70), CD11c (N418), Ly6G (1A8), Ly6C (HK1.4), and F4/80 (BM8) (BD Biosciences); CD206 (MR5D3; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC); and CD45 (104; eBioscience). A detailed description of this procedure can be found in the online supplement.\n\nParaffin sections (5 mm) of fixed lung tissue were stained as previously described (9). A detailed description of this procedure can be found in the online supplement.\n\nAfter lavage, the left lobe of the lung was inflated and fixed with 0.5 ml of 10% \n\nDeparaffinized sections from fixed lungs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Lung inflammation was scored by a pathologist (M.D.S.). A detailed description of this procedure can be found in the online supplement. Goblet cells and mucus production were evaluated on slides stained with periodic acid-Schiff.\n\nThe MouseOx Pulse-oxymeter (Starr Life Sciences, Holliston, MA) was used to measure blood saturation of peripheral oxygen (Sp O 2 ) in SeV-infected mice. A detailed description of this procedure can be found in the online supplement. Pa O 2 was estimated from Sp O 2 using the Ventworld interactive oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve tool, assuming a normal blood pH and arterial PCO 2 (23) .\n\nSeV-infected mice were killed on Day 49 after infection for preparation of precision-cut lung slices containing an intrapulmonary small airway as previously described (24) . A more extensive description of this procedure can be found in the online supplement.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed as indicated in each figure. GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for analysis.\n\nTo determine whether MDA5 has a protective role in the lung independent of controlling virus replication, we infected wild-type (WT) and MDA5 KO mice with 10 ID 50 of SeV strain 52 (10 4 TCID 50 ), the minimal dose of virus to achieve 100% infection. Virus titers in the respiratory tract of WT and MDA5 KO mice were comparable on Days 3 and 6 after infection, and the virus was cleared by Day 10 ( Figure 1A ). However, MDA5 KO mice lost more weight and showed delayed recovery compared with WT mice ( Figure 1B ). To assess the integrity of the lung epithelial cell barrier, protein concentration and cell numbers were determined in the BAL fluid of infected mice. At 10 days after infection, infected MDA5 KO mice had significantly higher protein concentration ( Figure 1C ) and total cell numbers ( Figure 1D ) in the BAL compared with infected WT mice, suggesting increased damage and disruption of the epithelial cell barrier. These results demonstrate that MDA5 protects the lung from acute damage during SeV infection by a mechanism that is not dependent on the control of virus replication.\n\nWe next profiled the expression of antiviral molecules, chemokines, and cytokines in whole lung homogenates from WT and MDA5 KO mice during the course of infection with SeV. Expression of Ifnb mRNA as well as expression of a number of molecules with antiviral activity, including Ifna2, Ifit2/Isg54, and Rsad2/viperin, were comparable in WT and MDA5 KO mice (Figure 2A ), suggesting that expression of these genes is primarily controlled by other PRRs. However, we observed striking temporal differences on the expression of chemokines and cytokines in the lungs of infected mice. On Day 3 after infection, MDA5 KO mice showed severely reduced expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 and of the proinflammatory cytokines II1b, Tnfa, and Il6 ( Figure 2B ), but on Day 6 after infection, MDA5 KO mice exhibited drastically enhanced expression of the monocyte/ lymphocyte-attracting chemokines Ccl3 and Ccl5 but not of Ccl2. In addition, MDA5-deficient mice had increased expression of the regulatory cytokines Il10, Il13, and Il27 ( Figure 2C ). MDA5 did not regulate the expression of Il33, Tslp/Thymic stromal lymphopoietin, Areg/Amphiregulin, or Il22, which have been associated with lung tissue repair during respiratory virus infection (25, 26) , and transcripts for the granulopoietic cytokine Cfs3/Gscf were not different in WT and MDA5 KO mice on Day 3 after infection but were up-regulated in MDA5KO mice on Days 6 and 10 after infection (see Figure E1 in the online supplement).\n\nTo determine whether the lung hematopoietic and/or nonhematopoietic cellular compartments were influenced by MDA5 signaling, we evaluated Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 expression in lung cells isolated 3 days after infection and enriched based on the expression of the hematopoietic marker CD45. Enrichment resulted in 80 to 90% purity of the CD45 1 and CD45 2 cells. Gating of the enriched cell preparations can be seen in Figure E2 . Although most of the SeV Np transcripts were found on CD45 2 cells on WT and MDA5 KO mice ( Figure 3A ), CD45 1 cells also expressed SeV Np. As expected, Ifng was expressed only in hematopoietic cells (CD45 1 ) ( Figure 3B ). Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 were predominantly expressed in a MDA5dependent manner by hematopoietic (CD45 1 ) and nonhematopoietic cells (CD45 2 ) ( Figures 3C and 3D ), indicating that MDA5 regulates the expression of proinflammatory genes by both cell populations in the lung.\n\nTo more directly assess the role of MDA5 in chemokine expression, we infected WT and MDA5 KO bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with SeV, influenza A virus (IAV) PR8, or IAV PR8 delNS1 as a control for a RIG-I-dependent virus (15) . IAV delNS1 lacks the virus-encoded immune antagonistic protein NS1, allowing the development of a stronger host response to infection (27) . After 6 hours, total RNA was extracted from infected cells and analyzed by RT-qPCR. As expected, Ifih1/Mda5 transcripts were only observed in WT cells, whereas WT and MDA5 KO cells induced comparable levels of Ddx58/Rig-I mRNA ( Figure 4A ). During infection with SeV, MDA5 KO cells showed normal expression of viral Np mRNA and of Ifnb mRNA but a significantly reduced expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine Cxcl1 mRNA ( Figure 4B ), demonstrating that MDA5 regulates the expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine Cxcl1 by DCs, whereas other PRRs are responsible for the expression of Ifnb mRNA during infection with SeV. Unexpectedly, we observed significantly reduced expression of Ifnb and Cxcl1 transcripts in MDA5 KO cells infected with IAV delNS1 accompanied with an increased expression of IAV Np mRNA compared with WT cells ( Figure 4C ). However, infection with IAV PR8 did not show up-regulation of Ifnb and Cxcl1 transcripts due to the activity of NS1. These results indicate that MDA5 also contributes to the expression of Cxcl1 and Ifnb during infection with IAV delNS1.\n\nTo determine whether the RIG-I-like receptors adaptor protein MAVS was required for Cxcl1 expression in response to SeV or IAV delNS1, we infected WT and MAVS KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) ( Figure 5A ). Although SeV Np mRNA was expressed at high levels in the absence of MAVS and its expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5B ), expression of Ifnb and Cxcl1 was completely dependent on the presence of MAVS at all tested doses ( Figures 5C and  5D) . Similarly, expression of IAV Np mRNA was higher in MAVS KO MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Figure 5E ), and expression of Ifnb and Cxcl1 transcripts was dependent on MAVS in response to IAV delNS1 ( Figures 5F and 5G) . These data suggest that MDA5/MAVS-mediated signaling is required for the expression of Cxcl1 in response to SeV or IAV infection.\n\nBased on the differential profile of chemokine expression in infected WT and MDA5 KO mice, we hypothesized that MDA5 deficiency results in an altered composition of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the infected lung. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the cells present in the BAL of WT and MDA5 KO mice 6 days after infection. The gating strategy used for analysis of cell populations is shown in Figure E3 . Corresponding with the profile of chemokine expression (Figure 2 ), significantly fewer neutrophils infiltrated the lungs of MDA5 KO mice on Day 6 after infection ( Figure 6A ), associated with a lower percentage of Ly6G high granulocytic cells and a higher percentage of Ly6C high monocytic cells in the lung infiltrate of MDA5 KO mice compared with WT controls (Figures 6B  and 6C ). In addition, BAL of MDA5 KO mice had a higher percentage of CD3 1 T cells at this time point. Although we did not directly address in this study whether these T cells were predominantly of a Th2 type, we did observe an increase in the content of CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells in the lung of MDA5-deficient mice (not shown), suggesting and overall enhancement on the T-cell response at this time point. In WT and MDA5 KO mice, resident alveolar macrophages characterized as CD11b int/low F4/ 80 1 CD11c 1 CD206 1 cells ( Figure E4 ) disappeared by Day 6 after infection ( Figure 6D ) and were replaced by CD11b hi -expressing cells. By Day 21 after infection, infected MDA5 KO mice showed a higher percentage of cells expressing markers of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs: CD11b high F4/80 1 CD11c 1 CD206 1 ). Based on the shift in the proinflammatory profile of the lung toward the expression of Il10 and Il13 and on reports demonstrating a critical role for AAMs in the development of chronic lung diseases in response to SeV (7), we hypothesized that MDA5 deficiency resulted in the excessive accumulation of pathogenic AAMs, leading to the exacerbation of chronic lung disease. Supporting this hypothesis, MDA5 KO mice exhibited a significantly higher ratio of Arg1/Nos2 (28) mRNA expression than WT mice at 10 and 21 days after infection ( Figure 6E ) and expressed more transcripts for Mmp12, Relma/Fizz1, and Chi3l3/4/Ym1/2, although the difference did not always reach statistical significance at these time points. To confirm the bias toward AAMs in MDA5 KO mice, lungs from mice infected for 49 days were stained for FIZZ1, YM1, and F4/80 proteins, the standard markers of AAMs. Both proteins were expressed at much higher levels in MDA5 KO than in infected WT lungs, corresponding with the expression of F480 (Figure 7) and demonstrating a persistent AAM bias in the absence of MDA5. These data strongly suggest that MDA5 signaling determines the acute composition of the lung cellular infiltrate and regulates the persistent accumulation of AAMs during SeV infection.\n\nTo determine the impact of MDA5 on chronic postviral inflammation, we analyzed hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung tissue sections on Days 21 and 49 after infection. MDA5-deficient mice showed exacerbated alveolar congestion and peribronchial inflammation compared with WT mice. Histopathologic scoring (described in the legend of Figure 8 ) revealed enhanced total histopathology and mildly enhanced bronchial smooth muscle hyperplasia in infected MDA5-deficient mice compared with infected WT mice ( Figures 8A  and 8B ). Augmented Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production were also observed in MDA5 KO mice lungs ( Figure 8C ). These results suggest that MDA5-deficient mice are susceptible to exacerbated virus-induced lung injury and that MDA5 protects from the development of chronic airway inflammation.\n\nTo determine the chronic impact of MDA5 deficiency on pulmonary function, we measured Sp O 2 in mock-and SeVinfected mice on Day 49 after infection. Mean Sp O 2 values in mock-infected WT and MDA5 KO mice were 94.9% (range, 89.7-98.8%) and 96.3% (range, 92.5-99.1%), respectively. Both groups showed a significant decrease in arterial oxygen saturation after 49 days of infection ( Figure 8D ). Conversion of Sp O 2 to Pa O 2 from the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve revealed a significant decrease in Pa O 2 in infected MDA5-deficient mice, whereas the decrease in Pa O 2 did not reach statistical significance in WT mice ( Figure 8E ). These data suggest that the decreased pulmonary function observed chronically after SeV infection is worse in the absence of MDA5, corresponding with the observed enhanced inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia.\n\nAirway hyperreactivity is a common manifestation of chronic postviral lung disease in susceptible individuals. To assess the impact of MDA5 on airway hyperreactivity, we measured contractility of the airways in response to increasing doses of carbachol (10 28 to 10 24 M). Using precision-cut lung slices, enhanced constriction was observed in the lung from infected WT and KO groups on Day 21 after infection ( Figure 8F Figure 8I ) and area under the curve ( Figure 8H ) in response to carbachol. These data demonstrate that MDA5 deficiency leads to chronic airway hyperreactivity after SeV infection.\n\nIn this study we describe a novel immunomodulatory function of the intracellular helicase MDA5 in response to paramyxovirus infection. MDA5 deficiency results in altered expression of chemokines and cytokines in the infected lung and in differential composition of the lung inflammatory infiltrate, leading to exacerbated chronic lung pathology. MDA5 KO mice exhibited pulmonary neutropenia associated with reduced expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 and increased accumulation of AAMs. This cellular composition correlated with enhanced expression of the monocyte/ lymphocyte-attracting chemokines Ccl3 and Ccl5 and of the immunoregulatory cytokines Il10, Il13, and Il27 as well as with exacerbated postviral chronic airway inflammation.\n\nNeutrophils are typically the first cells recruited to the lung during viral or bacterial infections (29) and produce immune mediators, such as TNF-a and IL-1b, that enhance the inflammatory response (30, 31) . Phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by tissue macrophages promotes resolution of inflammation after infection (32, 33) .\n\nUsing G-CSF KO mice, we previously reported that neutrophil deficiency led to the enhanced expression of Ccl3 and Ccl5 during SeV infection (34) . MDA5 KO mice showed lung neutropenia and accumulation of CD11b high F4/80 1 CD11c 1 CD206 1 cells; enhanced expression of the immunomodulatory cytokines Il10, Il13, and Il27; a higher ratio of Arg1/Nos2; and higher expression of Mmp12, Fizz1, and Ym1/2 compared with WT controls, all indicative of the accumulation of AAMs. Chronic lung inflammation upon SeV infection is mediated by the accumulation of AAMs (7), suggesting that their enhanced accumulation in MDA5-deficient mice is responsible for increased pathology. Resident alveolar macrophages (CD11b low F4/80 1 CD11c 1 CD206 1 ) that disappear from the lung immediately after infection were replenished more efficiently in WT than in MDA5 KO mice, agreeing with physiological and histologic data demonstrating delayed recovery from infection in MDA5 KO mice.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms regulating the accumulation and function of macrophages are not well understood, but it is likely that reduced numbers of apoptotic neutrophils affect the differentiation and activation of lung macrophages (32, 33) .\n\nApoptotic neutrophils up-regulate the CCL3/CCL5 receptor CCR5, and increased CCR5 on neutrophils thereby sequesters the chemokine CCL3 and CCL5, resulting in the resolution of inflammation (35) . Thus, it is possible that reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lung in MDA5 KO mice leads to excessive levels of CCL3 and CCL5 and to enhanced activity of AAMs (36, 37) . Alternatively, and not exclusively, lipid mediators produced upon uptake of apoptotic neutrophils may affect the differentiation and function of macrophages, as it has been shown in a murine peritonitis model (38) .\n\nWe showed that MDA5 deficiency did not affect the expression of an important subset of type I IFNs or of type I IFN-responsive genes and that SeV replication and clearance occurred normally in the absence of MDA5. These data suggest that other PRRs are primarily responsible for the control of virus replication during low-dose SeV infection, in contrast to a previous study that uses a higher SeV inoculum. In striking contrast, expression of Cxcl1 is largely dependent on MDA5 during infection with SeV, influenza PR8 virus, or influenza delNS1 virus, suggesting that, contrary to current paradigms, MDA5 and RIG-I have distinct nonredundant roles during the response to these viruses.\n\nSeV-infected MDA5 KO mice showed a statistically significant reduction in arterial Pa O 2 compared with infected WT mice. An acute fall in Pa O 2 or a Sp O 2 of less than 85 to 88% indicate a significant loss of oxygen homeostasis and loss of biological oxygenation reserve. The increased inability of MDA5 KO mice to maintain blood oxygenation, together with pathophysiological alterations, demonstrate that MDA5 deficiency promotes chronic pulmonary dysfunction. In addition, MDA5 deficiency leads to sustained airway hyperreactivity, corresponding with enhanced bronchial smooth muscle hyperplasia, a characteristic of asthmatic airways. Because airway hyperreactivity is a common manifestation of chronic disease in individuals infected with paramyxoviruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus (39) (40) (41) , it would be interesting to determine whether polymorphisms in the MDA5 molecule correlate with enhanced susceptibility to chronic postviral lung diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that MDA5 modulates the lung inflammatory response induced by SeV infection and protects from the development of severe chronic lung pathology. MDA5-associated signaling and downstream events may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention in individuals susceptible to the development of postviral chronic lung inflammation. n Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org."}
