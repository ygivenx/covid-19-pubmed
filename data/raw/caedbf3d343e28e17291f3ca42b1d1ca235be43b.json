{"title": "Vaccines for preventing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections in farm animals", "body": "Research conducted in animal and human health laboratories around the world from 1960-1980 established the rationale for vaccines to control enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections in neonatal farm animals. Comprehensive reviews of that research are available I 12. The research confirmed the long-held hypothesis that certain strains of E. coli caused a diarrhoeal disease (colibacillosis) which occurred commonly among neonatal calves, pigs, and lambs13 16. It establishes the concepts that:\n\n\u2022 the pathogenesis of diarrhoea caused by ETEC is similar to human cholera (bacteria adhere to small intestinal epithelium and stimulate local secretion of electrolytes and water)\n\n\u2022 E. coli enterotoxins and specific types of fimbriae (pili) are required virulence attributes of ETEC which act, respectively, as intestinal secretagogues and adhesins (colonization factors) \u2022 host species specificity of ETEC depends largely on the ligand receptor fit among various types offimbriae and receptors on the intestinal epithelial cells of the host \u2022 more than 90% of the ETEC associated with disease in animals belong to a small family of fimbriae and enterotoxin types \u2022 most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal or suckling period \u2022 neonates suckling dams vaccinated with ETEC fimbriae are protected against challenge by ETEC bearing fimbrial antigens homologous to the vaccine strain.\n\nGeneral acceptance of these concepts led to the commercial development of fimbriae based vaccines to control ETEC infections in farm animals. Most of the vaccines are designed for parenteral administration to pregnant dams to increase the content of fimbrial antibody in colostrum and milk. Suckling establishes and maintains a level of fimbrial antibody in the small intestine to prevent intensive colonization by ETEC during the highly susceptible neonatal period. \n\nThe first fimbriae-based ETEC vaccine (bacterin) for commercial use in US livestock was licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1980. Such vaccines (bacterins) have now been in routine use in the US for about ten years. We describe here some aspects of the use of ETEC vaccines in the US. We will also attempt to assess what impact, if any, this decade of routine use of fimbriae based vaccines has had on the disease in the US.\n\nData on USDA licensed biologicals produced for the prevention of E. coli infections in livestock during 1990 and 1991 are summarized in Table 1 . In 1991, 32 distinct commercial vaccines (bacterins) were produced for the parenteral vaccination of pregnant cattle, sheep, and swine. The vaccines for use in cattle all included fimbrial antigen F5 (K99), while those for swine all included F4 (K88), F5 and F6 (987P). Twenty-one of the vaccines also included F41, and at least one included the F1 (type 1 pili) fimbrial antigen. In addition to fimbrial antigens, one of the swine products (vaccines) includes a label claim for the heat labile enterotoxin based on the B subunit (LT~) of the toxin used as antigen. Four of the vaccines were produced from E. coli strains containing plasmids constructed via recombinant DNA technology. Many of the products were designed to protect against other diseases in addition to ETEC infection. Therefore, in addition 1o ETEC fimbrial antigens, two-thirds of the vaccines produced also contained antigens from other pathogens (Pasteurella sp., Bordetella sp., Clostridium sp., rotavirus, and coronavirus). Most of the products were designed for parenteral vaccination with two doses during the first pregnancy and a single booster during each succeeding pregnancy. Most (63%) of the 26.8 million doses produced during 1991 were for use in swine, with 37% produced for cattle and minor use in sheep. The estimated inventories of livestock on US farms during 1990 91 were 7.7 million female breeding swine and 43.7 million breeding cows ( 10.1 million dairy and 33.6 million beef) 17. Most breeding female swine farrow about twice a year and remain in the breeding herd for about 2 years. Most cows calve once a year and remain in the breeding herd for five years or longer. Thus, saturation use of the vaccines in the US swine and cattle breeding herds would probably require an annual production of about 19 and 50 million doses, respectively. Assuming that most of the vaccine produced in the US is used domestically (some is exported, but the amount is not known) and that the number of doses produced/year approximates the number of doses used/year, then the US animal inventory data combined with the vaccine production data in Table 1 indicates that the vaccines are used much more intensively in swine than in cattle. Intensive use in pregnant swine is confirmed by a recent survey in which 47% of US swine producers reported routine use of E. coli vaccines ~s. The prevalence and severity of clinical ETEC infections is greatest under intensive management systems (close confinement of large numbers of animals). Most beef cows in the US are managed extensively, while intensive management systems are common in dairy and swine production. Thus, we think that the vaccines are probably used in a greater proportion of dairy than beef cows. It has been recommended that the vaccines be used strategically rather than universally in cattle 1. A cost : benefit ratio of 5.9 was achieved in a study of the economic aspects of such strategic use 1.\n\nIn addition to the vaccines, nearly 8 million doses of E. coli antiserum were produced during 1991 (Table 1) . These products are designed for oral or parenteral administration to newborn calves, lambs, piglets, or foals. Some of these products are designed to protect against E. coli bacteraemia and septicaemia in hypogammaglobulinaemic neonates. Hypogammaglobulinaemia is common because there is normally no passive Ig transfer in utero, and transfer under farm or ranch conditions is frequently inadequate. Several of the orally administered products contain antibody against fimbriae and are designed to prevent ETEC infections. This approach is rational because a high proportion of fatal ETEC infections occur during the first few days after birth. This is particularly so in calves because nearly all calf ETEC produce F5 fimbriae, and calves are only susceptible to colonization by F5 + ETEC during the first one or two days after birth 1.15. Thus, a few hours of local protection delivered to the intestine by a single oral dose of F5 monoclonal antibody can provide effective protection 19\n\nThe efficacy of vaccinating dams with fimbriae to protect suckling neonates against ETEC infection, via passive lacteal immunity, was first convincingly demonstrated by Rutter and Jones, using F4 fimbriae in swine 2\u00b0. Subsequent work confirmed the efficacy of the approach and generalized the concept by extending it to other ETEC fimbriae and other animal species 21 25 . It also demonstrated that ETEC fimbriae apparently do not have cross-protective epitopes and, therefore, vaccines are most useful if they contain the fimbrial antigens prevalent in the target host species 22. Most of the vaccines in current use probably achieve this by including F5 in vaccines for cattle or by combining F4, F5 and F6 in those for pregnant swine.\n\nAlthough F1 and F41 fimbriae are prevalent among animal ETEC, their efficacy as protective antigens in vaccines for cattle and swine is less well defined than is that for F4, F5 and F625 28. Most animal ETEC which produce F1 or F41 also produce F4, F5 or F6. Vaccination of dams with F5 protects calves and pigs against ETEC strains bearing both F5 and F41 (F5+F41 +)28,29. In a series of experiments utilizing a challenge strain (ETEC strain 431 ) which produces three fimbriae (FI +, F5 + and Vaccines against F41 +), it was found that the strain produced F5 and F41, but not FI, in the small intestine of pigs during disease 22'29\"3\u00b0. Vaccination with F5 protected against challenge with the strain, but vaccination with either F1 or F41 did not 2z'29'3\u00b0 However, vaccination with F41 did protect piglets against challenge with an F5-F41 + ETEC strain, and F41 vaccines are apparently more effective than F5 vaccines in protecting mice against F5 + F41 + ETEC 29,31. The controversy as to the role, if any, of F I fimbriae in the pathogenesis of ETEC infections and their efficacy as protective antigens in vaccines to prevent the disease has been discussed 28'3\u00b0'32 '33. There is convincing evidence that vaccination of pregnant swine with antigens directed against the heat labile enterotoxin (procholeragenoid or LTH) protects piglets (born to and suckling the vaccinates) against challenge with LT + ETEC 34 36. The principal barrier to more general development of antitoxic vaccines is the fact that many porcine ETEC strains produce one or both of the heat stable E. coli enterotoxins (STa and STb) in addition to or instead of LT. Most bovine ETEC produce STa only. In contrast to LT, neither STb nor STa are antigenic and both are rapidly excreted from the bacterial cell, rather than concentrated near the bacterial surface (periplasmic space) like LT. Furthermore, STa has not been an effective protective antigen when used as a hapten in vaccines which stimulated the production of STa neutralizing antitoxin 37\"38. Most porcine ETEC which produce LT also produce STb 39. Vaccination with procholeragenoid or LTn protects against such LT + STb + ETEC 34'36. The mechanism of such LT induced protection against the antigenically unrelated STb enterotoxin has not been defined. It could reside in the apparent antibacterial or anticolonizing effect of such LT vaccines 36.\n\nSome vaccines include polysaccharide O (cell wall) and K (capsular) antigens representing some of those most common among porcine or bovine ETEC. There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of O antigen based vaccines 1. In one series of experiments, O antigens were not effective, but a true capsular polysaccharide K antigen of the A (mucoid, heat stable) variety did appear to be effective 4\u00b0. Regardless of their efficacy, the practical value of O or polysaccharide K antigens is limited by the multiplicity of O and K antigens that commonly occur among ETEC, i.e. vaccines of reasonably limited valency would not be expected to provide broad efficacy. Furthermore, many ETEC lack true polysaccharide (A variety) capsules.\n\nThe USDA licensure policy recognizes the proprietary nature of efficacy data on specific commercial products. Publication of eff\u00c9cacy data related to vaccines licensed in the US is not required. Field trials indicating efficacy of a fimbriae based vaccine in swine, and lack of efficacy of a combined F5, rotavirus, and coronavirus vaccine in dairy cattle, have been published 25'41. Field trial data demonstrating the efficacy of most of the products in commercial use in the US are not available. The USDA does receive and investigate consumer reports concerning the safety or efficacy of licensed vaccines in commercial use. A total of 32 such reports were received by the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Biologics Field Operations, for all products of the type listed in Table 1 during the period from October 1983 to January 1992. Five of the 32 reports concerned efficacy. We assume that most complaints are directed to the enterotoxigenic E. coli infections: H.W. Moon and T.O. Bunn manufacturers rather than to the USDA, and that the total number of complaints received is much higher than those reported to the USDA. Nevertheless, the low number of reports received by the USDA during more than eight years of use is consistent with the anecdotal reports, as well as the prevailing opinion of animal health professionals and livestock producers, that the vaccines are effective in commercial use.\n\nData to indicate if the incidence of morbidity or mortality due to ETEC infections has changed since the introduction of commercial vaccines are not available. The national survey of US swine health found that 15 % (1.5 pigs/litter) of the piglets born alive during the period from December 1989 to January 1991 died before they reached one month of age TM. Diarrhoea was reported as the most common illness observed, and nearly 11% of all deaths during the first month after birth were attributed to diarrhoea ( Table 2) . Forty-seven per cent of the producers in the survey reported routine vaccination of dams to prevent ETEC infection of the piglets (Table 3) . It was not determined if the percentage of illnesses or deaths attributed to diarrhoea in herds reporting routine vaccination was different from that in National survey data on cattle health in the US are not yet available. However, results from veterinary diagnostic laboratories also indicate that ETEC infections were a common cause of calf diarrhoea in the US during 1991 (Table 5) 42. Thus ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem among calves and piglets in the US in spite of extensive vaccination. The proportion of the problem that occurs in the offspring of properly vaccinated dams is not known. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective in the field and that the disease occurs principally among non-vaccinated or inadequately vaccinated animals. Some veterinarians also have the perception that in some swine herds vaccination moves the peak prevalence of clinical disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, thereby significantly reducing mortality but not morbidity (J. McKean, personal communication).\n\nIt should be possible to extend passive protection beyond the first week into the later suckling period, through the use of oral vaccines or by using combined oral and parenteral vaccination 43.\n\nIt is rational to hypothesize that extensive use of fimbrial based vaccines will select against the prevailing fimbrial antigen types as reflected in the vaccines and for the emergence of new or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigens. Fimbriae antigenically distinct from F1, F4, F5, F6 and F41 occur among animal ETEC 2s'44. These other antigen types are apparently less prevalent than those currently used in commercial vaccines. The role of these other fimbriae in pathogenesis is less well defined than that of F4, F5 and F6. F-variants of F4 + and F5 + ETEC frequently emerge during the course of ETEC infections in animals, apparently as the result of selection pressure exerted by antibody against F4 or F5 fimbriae45 48. It has been suggested that extensive F4 vaccination may have caused the emergence of F5 + ETEC and the ad variant of F4 among swine in Europe 49'5\u00b0. An argument against the hypothesis of vaccine induced selection pressure as the reason for the emergence of F5 + and F4ad + ETEC in European swine has been presented 28.\n\nWilson and Francis found that 91% of 223 ETEC collected from US piglets between 1980 and 1982 were accounted for by F4 (48%), F5 (13%) and F6 (30%)27.This is probably an accurate reflection of the prevalence of these three fimbrial antigens among porcine ETEC in the US prior to extensive use of the commercial vaccines. These three fimbrial antigens continue to be commonly associated with ETEC infections among US piglets. For example, the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation at the University of Minnesota diagnosed 918 swine accessions (one or several pigs examined/accession) as ETEC infection during a period from 1988 to 199151 53. They reported 1108 positive immuno-fluorescence tests for these three fimbrial antigens among those accessions. Eighty-five per cent of the positive tests were F4, 6% were F5 and 9% were F6.\n\nThe ratio of F4/F5 plus F6 in the Wilson and Francis report is 1.1/1, compared to 5.7/1 in the Minnesota reports. We speculate that this apparent shift to F4 + ETEC is somehow a reflection of vaccination. It suggests that since the advent of vaccination, F5 + and F6 + ETEC infections are controlled more effectively than those due to F4 + ETEC. It may reflect a shift of peak disease prevalence from the first to the second, third and fourth weeks after birth. F4 + ETEC cause disease through that age span, while F5 + and F6 + ETEC infections are confined principally to the first few days of age, when vaccine induced milk (colostral) antibody titres are highest and vaccines would be expected to be most effective. This age shift would be consistent with the perception of some US veterinarians cited earlier and with the effects of extensive use of F4 + vaccines in Europe, reported by S6derlind et al., a decade ago 5\u00b0. There are no data to indicate whether the apparent shift in prevalence is due to a decreased incidence of disease during the first week after birth, to an increased incidence of disease during the second and later weeks, or both.\n\nThe high prevalence of F4 + ETEC infections could also reflect the emergence of antigenic variants of F4 as was suggested to occur in Europe 49. We are not aware of recent data on the prevalence of porcine ETEC which do not produce F4, F5, F6 or F41 (4F-ETEC). We would expect vaccine induced selection pressure to increase the prevalence of 4F-ETEC above the 8% reported by Wilson and Francis 2v.\n\nMost ETEC vaccine development in animals has focused on the problem that occurs during the early neonatal period (first week after birth). However, in swine a high incidence of ETEC infection also occurs immediately after weaning. In the US, piglets are usually weaned at 3 4 weeks of age. The trend is toward weaning at < 3 weeks of age. Mortality rates among affected pigs are lower for the postweaning disease than for the neonatal disease. The pathogenesis of the postweaning disease is similar to the neonatal disease in that fimbriae and enterotoxin are required virulence attributes of the associated ETEC. However, the postweaning disease appears to be more complex in that multiple factors predispose to, or cause, clinical disease. Some of these apparent predisposing causes are social and physical stress, diet, increased gastric pH, concurrent rotavirus infection, and cessation of the local protection provided by the antibody ingested with milk at each suckling. Cost-effective control of the disease centres around hygiene and management to minimize predisposing causes. Antimicrobial drugs are commonly used prophylactically and therapeutically. It is logical to extend the concept of fimbrial vaccines to include postweaning ETEC infections. Commercial vaccines prepared as killed F4 + strains of ETEC isolated from the postweaning disease are available in the US. One of the products is designed for parenteral administration to piglets prior to weaning and the other is designed to be fed for several weeks during the suckling and immediate postweaning periods. Data to support the rationale and efficacy of such vaccines are limited 54 sT. Parenteral vaccines tend to stimulate the systemic rather than the mucosal immune system. Inadequate delivery of systemically produced IgG from blood to the intestinal lumen limits the efficacy of parental vaccines for ETEC because these agents remain in the lumen of the intestine, on the epithelial surface. Oral vaccines stimulate the mucosal immune system to produce secretory antibodies that are efficiently transported into the intestinal lumen. Live ETEC are effective oral fimbrial vaccines but killed ETEC have generally been less effective 43\"ss 59. Recent efforts have focused on development of live oral fimbrial based vaccines to prevent postweaning ETEC infections in swine 6\u00b0 62. Such a vaccine would ideally:\n\n\u2022 temporarily colonize the small intestine of the suckling pig in spite of the antifimbrial antibody ingested with milk \u2022 not produce enterotoxin or other substances that would adversely affect the health and productivity of the colonized piglet \u2022 stimulate the mucosal immune system of the < 3-weekold pig to secrete protective levels of antifimbrial IgA into the small intestine \u2022 reflect the fimbrial antigens prevalent among ETEC associated with postweaning diarrhoea.\n\nThe fimbriai antigens of ETEC associated with postweaning diarrhoea of swine differ somewhat from those associated with the disease in neonates 63 67. Most pigs are physiologically resistant to colonization by F5 + or F6 + ETEC by about a week of age 68 ~1. Thus, these strains are not commonly associated with the postweaning disease 26'65. Age resistance to F5 + ETEC appears to be due, at least in part, to decreased availability (with age) of receptors for F5 on epithelial cells 68. On the other hand, resistance to F6 correlates with an increased availability of receptors in mucus 69. Receptors in mucus apparently prevent contact of F6 + ETEC with receptors on the epithelial surface 7\u00b0. Receptivity of swine intestinal mucus for F4 also increases with age v2. However, this increase is not adequate to protect genetically susceptible pigs from colonization, and F4 + ETEC are associated with disease in both the neonatal and postweaning periods. The fimbrial antigens (other than F4) associated with postweaning ETEC infections have not been well defined. It seems likely that additional, as yet unrecognized, fimbrial antigen types are prevalent at this age 73'74. There is suggestive evidence that during the first three weeks after birth, swine intestine becomes progressively more receptive to adhesion and colonization by ETEC of these unrecognized fimbrial antigen types 75.\n\nThe pattern emerging is that variations in the availability of receptors for fimbriae affect ETEC infections in several different ways. Inheritance of the trait for expression ofF4 fimbrial receptors on intestinal epithelial cells is an autosomal dominant character 76'77. Swine of the homozygous recessive genotype lack the required specific F4 receptors and are resistant to F4 + ETEC both as neonates and during the postweaning period 78'79. Variations in F4 receptor phenotype exist and correlate with antigenic variations among F4 fimbriae 8\u00b0. It has been suggested that selection pressure exerted by variation in receptor availability may be an alternative to that exerted by antibody, in the evolution of antigenic variants of F4 fimbriae 81. Genetic control of receptor expression may also influence resistance to E. coli of other as yet unrecognized fimbrial antigen types associated with postweaning disease in swine 82 84. On the other hand, changes with age in the availability and distribution of receptors apparently determines susceptibility and resistance to some ETEC. For example, the availability on epithelial cells of receptors for F5 decreases with age, while the availability of those for some postweaning ETEC increases 68 ' F5 and F6 ). The vaccines are given to pregnant females to produce antifimbrial antibody in colostrum and milk. Such lacteal antibodies will passively protect the intestine of the suckling neonate against colonization by ETEC during the highly susceptible early neonatal period. Data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines during the decade of routine use are not available. They continue to be generally regarded as effective. However, ETEC infections continue to be a common problem among neonatal calves and pigs in the US. Data to indicate whether the problem occurs principally among animals suckling vaccinated or non-vaccinated dams are not available. There are unpublished anecdotal reports that in some swine herds vaccination has moved the peak incidence of morbidity from the first to the second or third week after birth. The high ratio of F4 +, as compared to F5 + and F6 +, ETEC infections, among swine submitted to a diagnostic laboratory, is consistent with such anecdotal reports, because piglets are physiologically susceptible to F5 and F6 ETEC only during the first week after birth.\n\nThere is no evidence that ETEC with novel colonization mechanisms or new fimbrial antigens have emerged under the selection pressure of vaccination. Nor is there evidence that previously 'low prevalence' fimbrial antigen type ETEC, not represented in the vaccines, have emerged as 'common pathogens' filling an ecological niche left by the fimbrial antigen types targeted by the vaccines. Admittedly there is apparently no active direct surveillance for such events, and such events could explain the continued common occurrence of neonatal ETEC infections among swine in the face of intensive vaccination. It seems unlikely, however, that such events could account for a high incidence of disease and go unrecognized, because fimbrial antigen testing for F4, F5 and F6 is routinely used in the laboratory confirmation of ETEC infections. A high incidence of disease caused by 3F ETEC would be likely to be recognized and reported.\n\nThe knowledge and technology for the general development of fimbrial vaccines to control postweaning ETEC infections in swine is not yet available. The fimbrial antigens of the ETEC prevalent at this age have not been well defined. Immunological approaches to establishing and maintaining protective levels ofantifimbrial antibody in the small intestine of the pig during the first 1-2 weeks after weaning have not been developed.\n\nFrom the comparative medical perspective, the experimental studies in farm animals demonstrate that fimbrial vaccines can protect against ETEC infections. Practical or cost-effective use in animals has been possible because animals are most susceptible to the disease during the first few days after birth, when the intestine of the suckling animal can be protected with colostrum and milk antibody produced by vaccinating the dam. Strategies for general (commercial) extension of the concept beyond passive lacteal immunity for the early neonatal period in animals have not yet been developed. The task of extending the concept to humans, where protection is needed not only during the nursing period but also after weaning and throughout childhood, is clearly a much greater, but rational, challenge."}
