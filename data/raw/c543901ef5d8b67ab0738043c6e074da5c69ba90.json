{"title": "Natural/random protein classification models based on star network topological indices", "body": "One of the widely used methods for the predicting of the protein properties is quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) (Devillers and Balaban, 1999) . Graph theory can be used to obtain macromolecular descriptors named topological indices (TIs). The branch of mathematical chemistry dedicated to encode the DNA/protein information in graph representations by the use of the TIs has become an intense research area with interesting works of Liao (Liao and Wang, 2004a, b; Liao and Ding, 2005; Liao et al., 2006) , Randic, Nandy, Balaban, Basak, and Vracko (Randic, 2000; Randic et al., 2000; Randic and Basak, 2001; Randic and Balaban, 2003) , Bielinska-Waz team (Bielinska-Waz et al., 2007) or our group (Perez et al., 2004; Aguero-Chapin et al., 2006) . Using graphic approaches to study biological systems can provide useful insights, as indicated by many previous studies on a series of important biological topics, such as enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Andraos, 2008; Chou, 1989; Forsen, 1980, 1981; Chou and Liu, 1981; Chou et al., 1979; King and Altman, 1956; Kuzmic et al., 1992; Myers and Palmer, 1985; Zhou and Deng, 1984) , protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990) , inhibition kinetics of processive nucleic acid polymerases and nucleases (Althaus et al., 1993a (Althaus et al., , b, c, 1994a (Althaus et al., , b, 1996 Chou et al., 1994) , analysis of codon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Chou, 1993, 1994) , base frequencies in the anti-sense strands , and analysis of DNA sequence (Qi et al., 2007) . Moreover, graphical methods have been introduced for QSAR study Prado-Prado et al., 2008) as well as utilized to deal with complicated network systems (Diao et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2007a . Recently, the ''cellular automaton image'' (Wolfram, 1984 (Wolfram, , 2002 has also been applied to study hepatitis B viral infections (Xiao et al., 2006a) , HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b) , and visual analysis of SARS-CoV (Gao et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005) , as well as representing complicated biological sequences (Xiao et al., 2005a) and helping to identify protein attributes (Xiao and Chou, 2007; Xiao et al., 2006b) .\n\nThe actual work presents for the first time a natural/random protein classification using only the chain sequence and amino acid connectivity protein structural data. The data are transformed into sequence and connectivity Star Graph's TIs, which are then used as input for a statistical linear method in the construction of a simple classification model.\n\nTwo sets of proteins are compared in the new classification model: a set (Nat) of 1046 natural protein chains as defined in the pre-compiled CulledPDB list from PISCES Dunbrack's Web Lab (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003) and a second (Rnd) with the same size formed by random amino acid sequences generated with Python scripts (Rossum, 2006) . The natural set is characterized by a homology of 20%, a structure resolution of 1.6 \u00c5 and R-factor lower than 25%. The random set is composed by the same standard amino acid types and the average length of the chains is the same as that of the natural set. Python scripts are used to download PDB files from the PDB data bank (Berman et al., 2000) and to create the correspondent DSSP file with the DSSP application (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) . The chain sequences were extracted with a Python script from these DSSP files and were filtered with our Prot-2S Web Tool (http://www.requimte. pt:8080/Prot-2S/) by removing the chains that contain nonstandard amino acid (usually labelled X).\n\nEach protein can be considered as a real network where the amino acids are the vertices (nodes), connected in a specific sequence by the peptide bonds. The graph is the abstract representation of the network and is a collection of N vertices and the connections between them. The star graph is a special case of trees with N vertices where one has got N\u00c01 degrees of freedom and the remaining N\u00c01 vertices have got one single degree of freedom (Harary, 1969) . In addition, as a general property, there is a unique path between any pair of vertices. For proteins, each of the 20 possible branches (''rays'') of the star contains the same amino acid type and the star centre is a nonamino acid vertex.\n\nThe same protein can be represented by different forms which are associated to distinct distance matrices (Randic et al., 2007) . If the vertices do not carry a label, the sequence information will be lost; for that reason, the best method is to construct a standard star graph where each amino acid/vertex holds the position in the original sequence and the branches are labelled by alphabetical order of the three-letter amino acid code (Randic et al., 2007) .\n\nIn the present study we are using the alphabetical order of oneletter amino acid code. The standard star graph for a random virtual decapeptide (ACADCEFDGH) is illustrated in Fig. 1 .\n\nIf the initial connectivity in the protein chain is included, the graph is embedded (Fig. 2) . In order to compare the graphs, it is necessary to transform the graphical representation in connectivity matrix, distance matrix and degree matrix. In the case of the embedded graph, the matrices of the connectivity in the sequence and in the star graph are combined. These matrices and the normalized ones are the base for the TIs calculation. \n\nThe protein chain sequences are transformed into Star Graph representations and then characterized by several TIs using our new Sequence to Star Networks (S2SNet) application. S2SNet is a wxPython (Noel Rappin, 2006) GUI application with Graphviz (Koutsofios, 1993 ) as a graphics back-end. The user of this interactive tool is able to choose the level of calculations, such as: embedded graph, additional weights for each amino acid, Markov normalization, power of the matrix connectivity, the input files (files with sequences, groups and weights), the output files, the level of details (files for summary and detailed results) and the type of graph visualization (dot, neato, fdp, twopi, circo). In particular, the calculations presented in this work are characterized by embedded and non-embedded TIs, no weights, Markov normalization and power of matrices/indices (n) up to 5. The summary file contains the following TIs (Todeschini and Consonni, 2002) :\n\nShannon entropy of the n powered Markov matrices (Sh n ):\n\nwhere p i are the n i elements of the p vector, resulted from the matrix multiplication of the powered Markov normalized matrix (n i \u00c2 n i ) and a vector (n i \u00c2 1) with each element equal to 1/n i ;\n\nThe trace of the n connectivity matrices (Tr n ):\n\nwhere\n\nHarary number (H):\n\nwhere d ij are the elements of the distance matrix, m ij are the elements of the M connectivity matrix, w j are the weight elements and nw is a switch to select (1) or not select (0) weights calculations;\n\nWiener index (W): -500 Case Number Gutman topological index (S 6 ):\n\nwhere deg i are the elements of the degree matrix;\n\nSchultz topological index (non-trivial part) (S):\n\nMoreau-Broto, autocorrelation of topological structure (ATS n , n \u00bc 1\u00c0power limit), only with weights included:\n\nwhere dp ij n are the elements of the pair distance matrix when the distance is n;\n\nBalaban distance connectivity index (J):\n\nwhere nodes+1 \u00bc AA numbers/node number in the Star Graph+origin, P k d ik is the node distance degree;\n\nKier-Hall connectivity indices ( n X): \n\nRandic connectivity index ( 1 X):\n\nAll these TIs will be used to construct a natural/random classification model by statistical methods.\n\nGeneral discriminant analysis (GDA) (Kowalski and Wold, 1982; Van Waterbeemd, 1995) (StatSoft.Inc., 2002) has been chosen as the simplest and fastest method. In order to decide if a protein chain is classified as natural (if exists in the PDB database) or random, we added an extra dummy variable named Nat/Rnd (binary values of 0/1) and a cross-validation variable (CV). There are three often used crossvalidation methods to examine a predictor for its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test (Chou and Zhang, 1995) . Through a crystal-clear analysis, Shen (2007, 2008) have shown that only the jackknife test has the least arbitrariness. Therefore, the jackknife test has been increasingly used by investigators to examine the accuracy of various predictors (Chen and Li, 2007a, b; Diao et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2008; Lin, 2008; Lin et al., 2008; Niu et al., 2006 Niu et al., , 2008 Wang et al., 2008; Xiao and Chou, 2007; Zhou et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) . In the actual work, the independent data test is used by splitting the data at random in a training series (train, 75%) used for model construction and a prediction one (val, 25%) for model validation (the CV column is filled by repeating 3 train and 1 val). All independent variables are standardized prior to model construction.\n\nUsing S2SNet methodology, as defined previously we can attempt to develop a simple linear QSAR, with the general formula\n\nwhere Nat/Rnd-score is the continue score value for the Nat/Rnd classification, T i \u00bc TIs described above, C 1 \u00c0C n \u00bc TIs coefficients, n is the number for the indices and c 0 is the independent term. GDA models quality was determined by examining Wilk's U statistics, Fisher ratio (F), p-level (p), and canonical regression coefficient (R C ). We also inspected the percentage of good classification, cases/variables ratios, and number of variables to be explored in order to avoid over-fitting or chance correlation. The forward, backward and best subset model types are tested for the embedded, non-embedded and both data.\n\nEight variable selection methods were applied in order to find the best GDA equation which is able to discriminate between natural and random chain proteins. Eight models were constructed using embedded/non-embedded Star Graph TIs obtained with S2SNet application and forward, backward and best subset model types. The values obtained for the training/predicting accuracies are presented in Table 1 .\n\nThe forward stepwise selection variable method conjugated with the nE and E TIs provides the best results for our data set with values of correctly classified compounds of 91.01%, 90.06% and 90.77% for the training, cross-validation and full sets, respectively, and using a minimum number of 12 parameters (Eq. (15)). The embedded TIs have the name of the non-embedded ones plus ''e'' as suffix:\n\nNat=Rnd \u00c0 score \u00bc 0:1 \u00fe 4:8Sh0 \u00fe 254:9H \u00fe 1860:2W \u00c0 1931:0S \u00fe 39:4J \u00c0 139:2X0 \u00c0 73:0X3 \u00fe 146:7X4 \u00c0 159:3X5 \u00c0 6:6Tr4e \u00fe 7:1X2e, where N is the number of studied protein sequences (Nat+Rnd), R c is the canonical regression coefficient, U is the Wilk's statistics, F is the Fisher's statistics and p is the p-level (probability of error).\n\nThe present R c value shows a high level of correlation between the input variables and the classification of proteins. Wilk's U is used to measure the statistical significance of the discriminatory power of the model and has values from 1.0 (no discriminatory power) to 0.0 (perfect discriminatory power). The F value shows the statistical significance in the discrimination between groups, a measure of the extent to which a variable makes a unique contribution to a prediction of group membership. The values of the p-level of Fisher's test for the GDA is less than 0.05 and show that the hypothesis of group overlapping with a 5% error can be rejected (Hua and Sun, 2001 considered as excellent in the literature for LDA-QSAR models (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2004; Marrero-Ponce et al., 2004 .\n\nThe parametrical assumptions such as normality, homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variances) and non-colinearity have the same importance in the application of multivariate statistic techniques to QSPR (Bisquerra Alzina, 1989; Stewart, 1998) as the correct specification of the mathematical form has. The validity and statistical significance of any model is conditioned by the above-mentioned factors.\n\nIn our study, a simple linear mathematical form of the model has been chosen in the absence of prior information. Figs. 3 and 4 show that the training cases against the residuals did not present any characteristic pattern (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984) . The protein nos. 632 and 864 are the only two cases not shown in Fig. 4 because the corresponding raw residuals are clear distinct from the whole set, ca -7. They correspond to 1QWN, chain A (1014 AAs) and 1JZ8, chain A (1011 AAs). One possible reason for the apparent different statistical behaviour could be the limitation of the model when the length of the chains is greater than 1000 amino acids. It is possible that the star net TIs for large proteins become similar to the TIs of the random proteins. A different and better threshold for the a priori classification probability can be estimated by means of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (James and Hanley, 1982) . As the Fig. 5 clearly shows, one can see that the model is not a random, but a truly statistically significant classifier, since the area under the ROC curve (for both training \u00bc 0.98 and validation \u00bc 0.96) is significantly higher than the area under the random classifier curve random \u00bc 0.5 \u00bc diagonal line (Morales Helguera et al., 2007) .\n\nThe validity of the GDA models depends on the normal distribution of the sample used as well as the homogeneity of their variances. Thus, we carried out two significant tests for normality, chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and we have found significant statistical differences (po0.01) on the respective values (chi-square, d). These results allow us to reject the hypothesis of normal distribution of the sample under study (Fig. 6) (Stewart, 1998) .\n\nThe heteroscedasticity of a large set can be detected with the simple graphical method based on the examination of the residuals of the variable included in the model. Fig. 7(a and b) shows that the Nat/Rnd GDA model variables against the residuals plots do not present any pattern, which indicates that homoscedasticity assumption is fulfilled (Stewart, 1998) .\n\nDue to the robustness of the GDA multivariate statistical techniques, the predictive ability and interference reached by using the proposed model should not be affected (see Fig. 8 ).\n\nThis study extends for the first time the classical TIs to protein Star Network TIs by proposing a model that can predict if a chain protein is natural or random. The results prove for the first time the excellent predictive ability (90.77%) of the simple and fast Star Network TIs and GDA statistics linear models in the case of natural/random protein model. This classification can help the study of the protein function by changing some fragments with random amino acid sequences or can detect the fake amino acid sequences or the errors in proteins. The S2SNet application can be very useful to calculate the protein Star Network TIs, which can be the base of a model for any other protein property. S2SNet can also be used for mass spectroscopy, clinical proteomics and imaging or DNA/RNA structure analysis. "}
