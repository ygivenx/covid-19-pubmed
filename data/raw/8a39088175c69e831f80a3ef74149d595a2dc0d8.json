{"title": "Unipolar ion emission enhances respiratory protection against \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne particles", "body": "The outbreaks of emerging diseases (e.g., SARS) and the threat of bioterrorism have triggered an urgent demand for adequate respiratory protection against bioaerosol agents, including airborne viruses and bacteria. Particular interest has been directed towards increasing the e ciency of existing respiratory protection devices.\n\nThe \u00ffltering-facepiece masks, including Type N95 respirators, are frequently used in indoor air environments to prevent or considerably reduce inhalation of droplet nuclei that can potentially carry viable microorganisms. Millions of workers, including health-care personnel, routinely use respirators in their workplaces (United States Department of Labor, 1995) . In case of bioterrorist attack in a major urban area, there may be a need in millions readily available respiratory protection devices. The existing respirators have been extensively evaluated against \u00ffne particles (e.g., Brosseau, Evans, Ellenbecker, & Feldstein, 1989; Chen, Ruuskanen, Pilacinski, & Willeke, 1990; Chen & Willeke, 1992; Huang, Willeke, Qian, Grinshpun, & Ulevicius, 1998; Johnston, Myers, Colton, Birkner, & Campbell, 2001; Qian, Willeke, Grinshpun, Donnelly, & Co ey, 1998; Halvorsen, 1998) and microorganisms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994; Lee, Slavcev, & Nicas, 2004a; Qian, Willeke, Grinshpun, & Donnelly, 1997; Qian et al., 1998; Reponen, Wang, Willeke, & Grinshpun, 1999; Willeke, Qian, Donnelly, Grinshpun, & Ulevicius, 1996) . At the same time, the protection e ciency of existing facepiece respirators have not been well characterized with respect to ultra\u00ffne particles, i.e. those below 0:1 m (Hinds, 1999) .\n\nThe respirators di er from one another by their \u00ffltration e ciency, which is dependent on the \u00fflter properties and the particle size. For example, a Type N95 respirator may allow up to 5% penetration in \"a worst case scenario,\" when most-penetrating sodium chloride particles of 0:3 m mass median aerodynamic diameter are drawn through the \u00fflter at a ow rate of 85 l min \u22121 (Federal Register, 1995) . The penetration e ciency of larger Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria (Mtb, 0:8 m) through a face-sealed N95 respirator at strenuous workload is as low as about 0.5% . The face-sealed \u00fflter of a conventional health-care mask, which ensures relatively low pressure drop and consequently good comfort level, allows approximately 15% of airborne Mtb surrogate bacteria to penetrate, thus providing 85% protection against these bacteria (Willeke et al., 1996) .\n\nIf the bacterial concentration in the air is 1000 m \u22123 , an unprotected individual breathing at 30 l min \u22121 inhales 1800 microorganisms per hour, whereas the one wearing a perfectly \u00fft N95 respirator inhales up to 90 microorganisms per hour. If the infectious dose of a bioaerosol agent of interest is less than 90, the N95 respirator may not provide an adequate respiratory protection once the exposure time exceeds one hour. The use of an improperly \u00fft-tested tight-\u00fftting respirator may further decrease the respiratory protection level because of the additional particle penetration that occurs through the face-seal leaks (Chen et al., 1990; Chen & Willeke, 1992; Oestenstad, Dillion, & Perkins, 1990a; Oestenstad, Perkins, & Rose, 1990b) . Based on the above considerations, it seems very useful if the \u00ffltration e ciency of existing respirators can be increased while the comfort level provided by these devices would remain the same.\n\nWith respect to the respiratory exposure and protection, the particle aerodynamic diameter range of d a \u223c 0:04-2 m is of special public interest because of its health relevance. Many bioaerosol agents, including viruses and bacteria that cause emerging diseases as well as those that can be used for biological warfare or in the event of bioterrorism, belong to this size range. For example, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the dimension of the coronavirus virion (the etiological agent of the SARS) are (60-120) \u00d7 (160-200) nm, which corresponds to d a \u223c 0:1 m. For Bacillus anthracis (bacteria causing anthrax), d a \u223c 1 m. As the above range is broad and includes both the \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne particle fractions (Baron & Willeke, 2001; Hinds, 1999) , the particle penetration e ciency through the \u00fflter media can be a ected by several mechanisms and is generally characterized by the particle aerodynamic size. This allows testing the performance of respirator \u00fflters against pathogenic agents using non-pathogenic aerosol surrogates that simulate the aerodynamic characteristics of the particles of interest.\n\nIn this study, we developed and evaluated a novel concept that drastically enhances the performance of conventional \u00ffltering-facepiece respirators against \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne aerosol particles. The concept is based on the continuous emission of unipolar ions into the air in the vicinity of the respirator. The aerosol particles are unipolarly charged by air ions primarily due to the di usion charging mechanism (Adachi, Kousaka, & Okuyama, 1985; Frank, Cederfelt, & Martinsson, 2004; Hernandez-Sierra, Alguacil, & Alonso, 2003; Wiedensohler et al., 1994) . The ion-\u00fflter interaction and the deposition of unipolarly charged particles on the external surface of the \u00fflter impose signi\u00ffcant unipolar charge on the \u00fflter. This creates a shield for the incoming particles (as they carry charges of the same polarity), which decreases the penetration e ciency through the \u00fflter.\n\nThe new concept was experimentally evaluated in a non-occupied, unventilated indoor test chamber (L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H = 3:78 m \u00d7 2:44 m \u00d7 2:64 m = 24:3 m 3 ). This facility, developed in the Center for Health-Related Aerosol Studies at the University of Cincinnati, has been used in our previous studies (Choe et al., 2000; Grinshpun et al., 2002 Grinshpun et al., , 2004 .\n\nThe experimental setup is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . A breathing manikin with a face-sealed respiratory mask was exposed to the airborne polydisperse surrogate aerosols that simulated viral and bacterial particles with respect to their aerodynamic size. The leakage tests were conducted between the mask and the face of the manikin with a bubble-producing liquid (Trubble Bubble, New Jersey Meter Co., Paterson, NJ, USA). The manikin operated at a breathing ow rate, 30 l min \u22121 , representing human breathing during light workloads (Mineral Resources, 1994; Johnson, Weiss, & Grove, 1992) .\n\nThe electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI, TSI Inc./Dekati Ltd., St. Paul, MN, USA) was used to determine the concentration and aerodynamic particle size distribution in real-time. This instrument utilizes the cascade impaction principle and-in addition-has a direct-reading capability. The aerosol particles are charged by the corona charger downstream of the ELPI inlet and subsequently detected by the electrometers inside the cascade impactor.\n\nThe particles were collected by the ELPI inside and outside the respirator using identical sampling lines. For these measurements, a 10-mCi Kr 85 charge equilibrator (3M Company, St. Paul, MN, USA) was installed upstream of the ELPI inlet to neutralize the particles to Boltzmann charge equilibrium. This allowed us to avoid the in uence of high electric charges, imparted by the particles as a result of their interaction with air ions, on the ELPI performance. The time resolution of the instrument was adjusted to 10 s. The data were recorded in 12 ELPI channels (each channel = impaction stage), from 0.04 to 8:4 m. The latter sizes represent the midpoint diameters of the \u00ffrst and the 12th impaction stages (the midpoint = the geometric mean of the stage's boundaries). The natural aerosol concentration in the indoor test chamber was not su cient, particularly for the measurement inside the mask, because the \u00fflter removed considerable number of ambient airborne particles. To increase the initial background aerosol concentration, we used a smoke generator. The smoke particles covered primarily the submicrometer aerodynamic size range (Cheng, Bechtold, Yu, & Hung, 1995) with a sharp decrease in the particle number at d a \u00bf 1:5-2 m. Thus, the data recorded in the \u00ffrst 8 measurement channels of the ELPI (d a = 0:04-1:3 m) were used for the analysis.\n\nThe measured aerosol concentrations inside (C IN ) and outside (C OUT ) the mask were incorporated into the equation for the respirator penetration e ciency, E p :\n\nwhich was determined as a function of the particle aerodynamic diameter. E P is actually the inversed protection factor that is frequently used as a respirator performance index. Initially, the background tests were conducted by measuring the penetration e ciency of the mask with no ion emission. Then, a unipolar ion emitter was turned on at a distance of 20 cm from the mask, and E p (d a ) was determined in 3-min time intervals during 12 min. The continuous air ion emission in the chamber decreased C OUT as the particles, charged by ions to the same polarity, repelled and subsequently migrated toward the chamber's walls and deposited on these walls (Grinshpun et al., 2004) . The change in the C OUT -value that occurred during each 3-min time interval due to ionic air puri\u00ffcation in the chamber was taken into account through the linear interpolation of C OUT (t).\n\nIn this study, we used a negative ion emitter (VI-2500, Wein, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA) producing an air ion concentration of N i \u223c 1:3 \u00d7 10 6 elementary charges per cm 3 as determined at a distance of 1 m from the source. The ion concentration was measured by the Air Ion Counter (AlphaLab Inc., Salt Lake city, UT, USA) that operates within the range of 10 -2\u00d710 6 ions per cm 3 .\n\nTwo types of \u00ffltering-facepiece respiratory masks commercially available from a major manufacturer were tested in this study. One was the NIOSH (US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) certi\u00ffed N95 respirator and the other one was a conventional disposable surgical mask. The N95 respirator consists of inner and outer cover webs made of rayon. Its \u00fflter made of polyester and polypropylene with the electrostatically charged micro\u00ffbers providing relatively high \u00ffltering e ciency. In the surgical mask, the polypropylene \u00fflter is sandwiched between inner and outer webs made of rayon. The \u00fflter of a surgical mask has lower \u00ffltration e ciency as compared to the one of an N95 respirator. Thus, the e ect of ion emission on the respirator \u00fflter e ciency was tested for the masks having two distinctly di erent original performance characteristics.\n\nThe average values and the standard deviations of the penetration e ciency were calculated for each set of conditions as a result of at least three replicates. The data were statistically analyzed using the Microsoft Excel software package (Microsoft Co., Redmond, WA, USA). Fig. 2 shows the normalized initial aerosol concentration measured outside the respirator mask. Each data point represents an average of six replicates. It is seen that the aerosol particles were primarily within a range of d a \u2248 0:04-0:5 m (the concentration N= log d a was between \u00bf 10 4 and \u00bf 10 5 cm \u22123 ), while fewer micron-size particles were detected ( N= log d a \u223c 10 3 cm \u22123 ). For each measured particle size, the initial aerosol concentration was reproducible with the variability (the coe cient of variation) not exceeding about 50% for six replicates. Fig. 3 presents the data obtained with two types of face-sealed respirators: N95 respirator and a surgical mask. When no air ion emission was introduced, the E p -value, averaged over the test range of d a , was about 1.8% for the N95 respirator. The particle size did not considerably a ect the penetration through the N95 respirator \u00fflter, although some decrease of E p with increasing d a was observed for d a \u2248 0:04-0:5 m. Once the negative ion emission began, the penetration decreased to 0.27% during the \u00ffrst 3 min. At t = 12 min, it further decreased to about 0.11%, enhancing the N95 respirator \u00fflter performance approximately by a factor of 17 (Fig. 3a) . For the surgical mask, the initial penetration e ciency ranged from 18.7% (d a = 0:04 m) to 11.1% (d a = 1:3 m). Resulting from the emission of negative ions, the average penetration e ciency through the surgical mask dropped from 15.4% (t = 0) to 0.19% (t = 12 min), demonstrating a 80-fold enhancement (Fig. 3b) . The data in Fig. 3 show that the most pronounced e ect occurred within the \u00ffrst 3-min interval. \n\nIt was surprising to observe that the initial penetration e ciency (t=0) of ultra\u00ffne particles through both masks slightly increased with decreasing particle size. In contrast, the available \u00ffltration models predict that the peak penetration is reached at d a between 0.1 and 0:3 m, and the particles below 0:1 m should be collected more e ciently as their size decreases (di usion regime) (Halvorsen, 1998; Hinds, 1999; Lee & Mukund, 2001) . The following considerations explain the results of our baseline test for the ultra\u00ffne particles. These models (and the laboratory-generated experimental data that support them) characterize the particle penetration through a homogeneous perfectly sealed \u00ffbrous \u00fflter material but not through a respirator mask. The design of a \u00ffltering-facepiece respirator does not assure a perfect peripheral connection of the assembly, so micro-leaks may be present between the core \u00fflter material and the elastic peripheral support. These leaks can contribute to the penetration of the ultra\u00ffne particles. In addition, although the mask was \"glued\" on the manikin, some very small, micrometer-or submicrometer-size leaks may still remain. Most of soap-bubble-based air leak detection methods are capable to identify micro-leaks greater than 1 m. If d a is much lower than the characteristic size of the micro-leaks (1 m), the particles may penetrate through these remaining submicrometer micro-leaks, thus a ecting the overall aerosol penetration e ciency through the \u00ffltering mask. One more possible factor is associated with the spatial variations in \u00ffber diameter, orientation, packing density, as well as initial \u00ffber electrostatic charge level (for those masks utilizing electret \u00fflter media). These variations have been shown to signi\u00ffcantly a ect the respirator performance increasing the penetration e ciency of particles of \u223c 0:1 m (Huang et al., 1998) .\n\nThe enhancement of the respirator performance, observed almost immediately after the ion emitter started operating, can be attributed to the electrostatic e ect. The emitted negative ions as well as the particles charged by these ions in the air, impose signi\u00ffcant negative charge on the respirator \u00fflter. This forms the \"electrostatic shield\" against the particles moving toward the mask. The repelling forces decrease the number of particles that can approach the \u00fflter. The above-described e ect works outside of the respirator, as opposite to the aerosol \u00ffltration by di usion, impaction, interception, and electrostatic deposition (Lee & Mukund, 2001 ) that takes place inside the \u00fflter. Therefore, the ion-induced decrease in the particle penetration e ciency does not cause the pressure drop increase through the \u00fflter providing the enhanced performance with the same comfort level.\n\nTo quantitatively characterize the e ect, we calculated the velocity of particle migration induced by the electrostatic interaction in the vicinity of the \u00fflter. It was then compared to the velocity of the air ow through the \u00fflter caused by inhalation. In this calculation, we used information about the airborne particle electric charges and the air ion density, obtained by the ELPI and the Air Ion Counter, respectively. The particle size of d a = 0:1 m was chosen, as it represents the dominant size range used in our experiments. Furthermore, this value is at the boarder line between the \u00ffne and ultra\u00ffne particle size ranges. In addition, many viral particles have an aerodynamic diameter of \u223c 0:1 m. Two main assumptions were made. First, the aerosol particles and air ions that interacted with the respirator were assumed to give all their electric charges to the respirator \u00fflter. Second, the charged \u00fflter was assumed to act as a point-charge located at the center of the respirator's surface. At the ion emission level produced in our experiment, a 0:1 m particle carries, on average, 10 elementary charges (Lee, Yermakov, & Grinshpun, 2004b) . The calculation showed that the total electric charge acquired by the respirator \u00fflter, as a result of a 3-min continued emission from the VI-2500 ion source, is about 1:5 \u00d7 10 13 elementary charges, if the breathing ow rate is 30 l min \u22121 . The ion concentration at the center of the respirator was determined to be approximately 1:6 \u00d7 10 8 cm \u22123 (this point located 20 cm from the ion emission source). Thus, the particle migration velocity was found to exceed the air ow velocity, created by the inhalation in the breathing zone, approximately by a factor of 75. This suggests that the e ect of the repelling force between the unipolarly charged particles and \u00fflter surface is much stronger than the aerodynamic force. Therefore, although our assumptions may not be su ciently conservative, the above assessment demonstrates that the enhancement of the respirator performance by the unipolar ion emission is governed by the electrostatic \"shield\" mechanism.\n\nThe drastic decrease of the particle penetration through the respirator \u00fflter due to continuous unipolar ion emission may be critical in providing additional respiratory protection by existing masks against viral and bacterial particles. For example, an individual exposed to the in uenza virus concentration of 10; 000 m \u22123 inhales approximately 4500\u00d70:18=810 viruses during 15 min when breathing through a conventional surgical mask at 30 l min \u22121 in the absence of ion emission (E p \u2248 18% for 0:1 m particles). The continuous emission of negative air ions (N i \u223c 10 6 e \u2212 cm \u22123 ) in a 25-m 3 room would reduce the indoor viral concentration by a factor of 9 during that 15-min interval (Lee et al., 2004a, b) . In addition, it would enhance the surgical mask protection reducing E p from 18% to at least 0.19%. Thus, only about (4500=9) \u00d7 0:0019 = 0:95 \u2248 1 virus would be inhaled in 15 min. Given that the infectious dose of in uenza A2 is 790 viruses (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), the ion emission e ect would make an important di erence with respect to the health risk.\n\nWhile this study is limited to the negative ion emission, we anticipate that the respirator performance enhancement e ect can be achieved also by generating positive air ions, as long as the ion concentration in the vicinity of the mask (breathing zone) is su ciently high. Future studies will address the e ects of polarity and the ion emission rate on the particle penetration e ciency through respirator \u00fflters.\n\nGenerally, the mask protection factor depends not only on its \u00fflter penetration e ciency but also on its face \u00fft (in practice, the facepiece mask is not sealed to the human face allowing the particles to penetrate through the leak). This pathway may become especially apparent when the \u00fflter material is highly e cient. Therefore, future tests involving human subjects, di erent \u00fft factors, and other experimental conditions ( ow rates and di erent masks) are needed to better characterize the enhancement e ect, discovered in this study, and link it to the exposure."}
