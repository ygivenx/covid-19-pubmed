{"title": "", "body": "Starting from Hubei province in China, the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) has been spreading all over the world, after two months of outbreak in China. Facing uncertainty and irresolution in A lot of efforts have been made in estimating the basic reproduction number R0 and predict the future trajectory of the coronavirus (COVID-2019) outbreak in the first quarter of 2020. In this paper, we focus on using phenomenological models without detailed microscopic foundations, but which have the advantage of allowing simple calibrations to the empirical reported data and providing transparent interpretations. This simple and top-down method can provide straightforward insights regarding the status of the epidemics and future scenarios of the outbreak.\n\nUsually, an epidemic follows an exponential growth at an early stage (following the law of proportional growth), peaks and then the growth rate decays as countermeasures to hinder the transmission of the virus are introduced.\n\nThere have been quite an extensive literature reporting statistical analysis and future scenarios based on phenomenological models. Most of previous work use simple exponential growth models and focus on the early growing process [1] [2] [3] [4] . On the other hand, there are also many works arguing that the number of infected people follows a trajectory different from a simple exponential growth [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .\n\nIn this paper, we employ the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model, which have been successfully applied to describe previous epidemics [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . All these models have some limitations and are only applicable in some stages of the outbreak, or when enough data points are available. Thus, we first calibrate different models to the reported number of infected cases in the COVID-19 epidemics from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China and 29 provinces in mainland China, and then draw some lessons useful to interpret the results of a similar modeling exercise performed on the four countries that are undergoing major outbreaks of this virus: Japan, South Korea, Iran, and Italy. Our analysis dissects the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. Borrowing from the experience of China, we made projections on the development of the outbreak in the four key countries and the whole Europe, based on different scenarios provided by the results from different models. Our study employs simple models to quantitatively document the effects of the Chinese containment measures against the COVID-19, and provide informative implications for the coming pandemic.\n\nConfirmed cases: In this report, we focus on the daily data of confirmed cases in provinces in mainland China.

For the provinces other than Hubei, the data is consistent except for one special event on Feb 20 concerning the data coming from several prisons. The data source is the national and provincial heath commission. For international data, the source is WHO. Note that the cases of the Diamond Princess cruise are excluded from Japan, following the WHO standard.\n\nData adjustment: On Feb 20, for the first time, infected cases in the Chinese prison system were reported, including 271 cases from Hubei, 207 cases from Shandong, 34 cases from Zhejiang.\n\nThese cases were concealed before because the prison system was not within the coverage of each provincial health commission system. Given that the prison system is relatively independent and the cases are limited, We remove these cases in our data for the modelling analysis to ensure consistency.\n\nMigration data: the population travels from Hubei and Wuhan to other provinces from Jan 1 st to Jan 23 rd are retrieved from the Baidu Migration Map (http://qianxi.baidu.com).\n\nWe use the generalized Richards model (GRM), which is an extension of the original Richards growth model [21] . With three free parameters, the Richards growth model has been fitted to a range of logistic-type epidemic curves [16] . The generalized Richards model is defined by the differential equation:\n\n.

The exponent \u03b1 measures the deviation from the symmetric s-shaped dynamics of the simple logistic curve. The model recovers the original Richards model for = 1, and reduces to the generalized logistic model [17] for \u03b1 = 1 and =\n\nFor the calibration, we use the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to solve the non-linear least square optimization. For the GRM, the initial point C(0) \u2254 C 0 is fixed at the empirical value, and there are 4 remaining parameters ( , , , ) to be determined. For the fitting of the standard logistic growth function ( = 1 and \u03b1 = 1), we free the initial point C 0 and allow it being one of the 3 parameters to be optimized, as the early stage growth does not follow a logistic growth.\n\nTo estimate the uncertainty of our model estimates, we use a bootstrap approach with a negative binomial error structure NB( , 2 ), where and 2 are the mean and variance of the distribution, estimated from the empirical data.\n\nAs of March 10 th , 2020, there are in total 13172 infected cases reported in the 30 provinces in mainland China outside Hubei. The initially impressive rising statistics has given place to a tapering associated with the limited capacity for transmission, exogenous control measure, and so on.

The green line is the fitted linear regression line (of the logarithm of the growth rate as a function of time) for the data from Jan-25 to Feb 14, 2020, yielding an exponential decay parameter equal to -0.157 per day (95% CI: (-0.164, -0.150)). This indicates that, after the lockdown of Wuhan city on Jan 23 and the top-level health emergency activated in most provinces on Jan 25, the transmission in provinces outside Hubei has been contained with a relatively fast exponential decay of the growth rate from a value starting at more than 100% to around 2% on \n\n.

The dispersion among these 500 scenarios provides a measure of stability of the fits and their range of values gives an estimation of the confidence intervals. The first conclusion is the non-surprising large range of scenarios obtained when using data before the maximum, which however encompass the realized data. We observe a tendency for early scenarios to predict a much faster and larger number of new cases than observed, which could be expected in the absence of strong containment control. With more data, the scenarios become more accurate, especially when using realized data after the peak, and probably account now well for the impact of the containment measures that modified the dynamics of the epidemic spreading.\n\n.

The data mainly reflects the situation before Jan 20, when no measures were implemented, or they were of limited scope. On Jan 19, Guangdong became the first province to declare a confirmed case outside Hubei in mainland China [22] . On Jan 20, with the speech of President Xi, all provinces started to react. As of Jan 24, 28 provinces reported confirmed cases with daily growth rates of confirmed cases ranging from 50% to more than 100%. to deploy the forces for the battle against the virus outbreak. In this phase, the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases in all provinces are declining from 50% to 10%+, with an exponentially decay rate of 0.157 for the aggregated data. At the provincial level, some provinces failed to see a continuous decrease of the growth rate and witnessed the incidence grow at a constant rate for a few days, implying exponential growth of the confirmed cases. These provinces include Jiangxi (~40% until Jan 30), Heilongjiang (~25% until Feb 5), Beijing (~15% until Feb 3), Shanghai (~20% until Jan 30), Yunnan (~75% until Jan 27), Hainan (~10% until Feb 5), Guizhou (~25% until Feb 1), Jilin (~30% until Feb 3). Some other provinces managed to decrease the growth rate exponentially during this period. As of Feb 1 st , 15 provinces had reached the peak of the incidence .

The growth rate of the number of confirmed cases declined exponentially with similar rates as in Phase II, pushing down the growth rate from 10% to 1%. In phase III, all provinces have passed the peak of the incidence curve, which allows us to obtain precise scenarios for the dynamics of the end of the outbreak from the model fits ( \n\nOn Jan 19, Guangdong was the first province to report a confirmed infected patient outside Hubei.\n\nOn Jan 20, 14 provinces reported their own first case. During Jan 21-23, another 14 provinces reported their first cases. If we determine the peak of the outbreak from the 5 days moving average of the incidence curve, then there are 15 provinces taking 7-11 days from their first case to their peak, 9 provinces taking 12-15 days, and 6 provinces taking more than 15 days.

For the six provinces that have the longest duration from the start of their outbreak to the peak (more than 15 days), it took 8-13 days for them to see the end of the outbreak (Figure 3 ). This means that these 6 provinces were able to control the local transmissions of the imported cases quite well, so that the secondary transmissions were limited. In contrast, 20 provinces took 28-31 days from the start to the end of the outbreak. Thus, those provinces that seem to have responded sluggishly during the early phase of the epidemics seem to have ramped up aggressively their countermeasures to achieve good results. . Inverse relationship found across the 29 Chinse provinces between the number of days from peak to the end and the duration from start to the peak of the epidemics.

The logistic growth provides a better quality of fit after Feb 1 st in general, as we can see from the lower right panel in the figure for each province (see supplementary material).\n\nThe 10 most infected provinces (Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Sichuan) have done quite well in controlling the transmission, as indicated by the fact that their daily growth rates follow well-defined exponential decays, with a 2 larger than 90%. This exponential decay continued for all ten cities until the situation was completely under control during Feb 15-18, when the daily incidence was at near zero or a single-digit number.\n\nEight out of these ten provinces have a decreasing parameter of the exponential decay of the growth rate ranging from 0.142 to 0.173, similar to what is observed at the national average level (0.157).\n\nNote that this exponential decay can be inferred from the generalized Richards model, as we noted in section 4.1.\n\nZhejiang and Henan are the 2 nd and 3 rd most infected provinces but have the fastest decaying speed of the incidence growth rate (decay parameter for Zhejiang: 0.223, Hunan: 0.186) among the most infected provinces. This is consistent with the fast and strong control measures enforced by both provincial governments, which have been praised a lot on Chinese social network [23, 24] . As one .

These provinces benefited from experience obtained in the fight against the 2003 SARS outbreak or enjoy richer local medical resources [7] .\n\nThis enabled the government to identify as many infected/suspected cases as possible in order to contain continuously the local transmissions.

However, this does not necessarily indicate ineffective measures for these provinces. The large and small \u03b1 in Guangdong and Zhejiang are likely to be mainly due to high population densities and highly mobile populations in mega-cities, which are factors known to largely contribute to the fast transmission of viruses. Jiangxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan and Gansu all had a fast growth phase before Feb 1 st , but were successful in controlling the subsequent development of the epidemics. The fast growth phase in Heilongjiang lasted a bit longer than the abovementioned provinces, due to the occurrence of more numerous local transmissions.\n\nHeilongjiang has been criticized a lot for its high infected cases and death rate (2.7%), given that it is far from Hubei and does not have a large number of migrating people from Hubei.\n\n.

One can observe a clear positive correlation between the estimated C 0 and the migration index. The lower panel of figure 4 shows an even stronger correlation between the total number of cases recorded on March 6 st and the travel index, expressing that a strong start of the epidemics predicts a larger number of cases, which is augmented by infections resulting from migrations out of the epidemic epicenter.\n\nAlthough it is clear that the virus in China has been successfully controlled up to the time of finalizing this paper, it has spread to 117 territories in the world as of March 10, with Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran as the four major hotspots. The highly connected European continent is at the beginning phase of the outbreak. In this section, we will analyze the situation in the four countries that have recently reported increasing numbers, and provide forecasts based on several models.\n\nMost of the countries analyzed here are still at an early stage of the outbreak, i.e., the cumulative number of cases is not yet reaching the inflection point. In this regime, the generalized Richards model, which has an additional parameter \u03b1 describing the asymmetry between growth and decay of the incidence curve, is not sufficiently constrained by the limited available data. Therefore, we consider the following three simpler models with fewer parameters: -Logistic growing model:\n\n.

It thus serves as a rough upper limit, obtained by assuming that the outbreak continues to grow following the same process as in the past. The generalized Logistic model (5) and Logistic growth model (4) both assume a logistic decay of the growth rate as the total number of confirmed cases increases. Note that they are nested in the generalized Richards model (1), by fixing respectively = 1 and = 1; p = 1 .\n\nBoth Logistic type models tend to under-estimate the total size of the infected population at the early stage, so they should provide lower bounds. The generalized Logistic model allows for an early sub-exponential growth and can better describe the possible asymmetry between growth and decay dynamics. We now calibrate these three models to the data of each of the four countries:\n\nItaly, South Korea, Japan, and Iran.

However, the situations are very different, as reflected from the statistics of these two Asian countries. Japan has reacted quite fast after the confirmation of the human-to-human Coronavirus Response Headquarters\" and has been actively developing countermeasures against the virus outbreak. As of March 10, Japan has been reporting new cases consecutively since Feb 11, with a total of 567 confirmed cases, and a relatively stable daily growth rate at 11.8% (standard deviation 6.3%). Thanks to the early response of the Japanese government, there is no large-scale community transmission in Japan, and this growth rate is not high compared to the initial outbreak stages in China and many other countries.\n\nHowever, as showed in Figure 5 , we do not observe any decay of this growth rate, in contrast to what occurred in phase III in mainland China beyond the inflection point of the cumulative number of cases with a continuous exponential decrease of the growth rate from 10% to 1%.

As of March 10, Italy has the largest number of confirmed cases (9172) and deaths (463) among all the countries except China. The outbreak in Italy was mainly due to a few outbreak clusters, such as Lombardy and Veneto. Similar to Japan, the growth rate of the confirmed cases at Italy has been fluctuating between 20% and 30% for a week, which is still far from the inflection point. The generalized logistic model provides the best scenario, i.e. predicting that the inflection point will be reached in 10 days. This scenario will already lead to a total cumulative number of infected Figure 9 shows the number of confirmed cases per million people in the four hotspot countries, in comparison with mainland China excluding Hubei, the epicenter Hubei province, Europe, .

Although Hubei has the highest infection ratio above 0.1%, South Korea and Italy have become the most infected country in the world. The high statistics in South Korea is likely as mentioned above due to the largest number of performed tests. We should indeed stress that the actual cumulative number of infected cases is probably misleading as it is likely that the incidence is an increasing function of testing.\n\nSince it is delicate to interpret the absolute number of infected cases, we propose to rather focus on the dynamics, which is more informative as we have presented above. For South Korea, we have shown that it is approaching the ceiling in the total number of infected cases and we do not expect this number to grow significantly in the coming future. If we assume a generalized logistic model for the behavior of Italy, the estimated final fraction of population infected will be 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]), which will be much higher than Hubei. reporting more than 1000 confirmed cases. The statistical analysis shows that the epidemic in Europe is in the early exponential regime and this may continue for a while. At the time of writing, the estimates for the tapering away from a pure exponential growth and the transition to an inflection point and a decay, as obtained from both generalized logistic model and logistic model, are not reliable. There are huge uncertainties simply stemming from the fact that the growth is very close to being pure exponential and does not reveal much additional information.\n\nNevertheless, the estimates from the generalized growth model and the generalized logistic model can provide a negative and positive scenario respectively. The generalized growth model assumes that the future growth will continue following the same path as the past weeks, which could be .

Our analysis dissects the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We documented four phases: I-early stage outbreak (Jan 19 -Jan 24, 6 days), II-fast growth phase approaching the peak of the incidence curve (Jan 25 -Feb 1, 8 days), III-slow growth phase approaching the end of the outbreak (Feb 2 -Feb 14, 13 days) and IV-the end of the outbreak (Feb 15 -8 March).\n\nWe quantified the initial reactions and ramping up of control measures on the dynamics of the epidemics and unearth an inverse relationship between the number of days from peak to the quasiend and the duration from start to the peak of the epidemic among the 29 analyzed Chinese provinces. We identified the dynamic signatures of the exemplary developments in Zhejiang and Henan provinces and the heterogeneity of the development of the epidemic and responses across various other provinces. We found a strong correlation between the initial and total confirmed numbers of infected cases and travel index quantifying the mobility between provinces.\n\nFor countries that are in the middle of the outbreak, we used some useful experience from China to interpret the calibration results from different models, and made future scenario projections. For Japan, the situation is found similar to phase II-III in mainland China and the estimated total number of cases as of March 25 will be1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340] ) by the end of May. However, it took China two weeks to reduce the growth rate from 10% to 1% under extreme containment measures and Japan is still far from achieving this result.\n\nWithout stronger and fast measures introduced in Japan, we foresee a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. For South Korea, we found that it is approaching the ceiling in the total number of infected cases. Both the generalized Logistic model .

For Italy, our estimated final fraction of population infected is found equal to 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]), which will be higher than Hubei, the epicenter in China of the epidemic. Our statistical analysis showed that the epidemic in Europe is in the early exponential regime and this is likely to continue for a while. This negative but probable scenario will provide 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, corresponding to 0.015% European population. The generalized logistic model provides a lower (optimistic) bound, leading to a prediction of a total cumulative number of 164219 people infected, corresponding to 0.02% (95% CI: [0.005%, 0.044%]) of the European population.\n\nHowever, for this forecast to come true, all European countries need to coordinate and fight together to avoid another major outbreak like in Italy. The situation in the United States is also at the very beginning stage, and may pose significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.\n\n.
