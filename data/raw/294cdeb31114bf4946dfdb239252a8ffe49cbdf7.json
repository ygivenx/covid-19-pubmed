{"title": "Journal Pre-proof A conceptual model for the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China with individual reaction and governmental action", "body": "At early stage of the outbreak, most cases were scattered, and some linked to the Huanan Seafood 23 Wholesale Market [3] . The Chinese government has adopted extreme measures to mitigate outbreak. 24 On 23 January 2020, the local government of Wuhan suspended all public traffics within the city, and 25 closed all inbound and outbound transportation. Other cities in Hubei province announced similar 26 traffic control measures following Wuhan shortly, see Figure 1 . The resumption date in Wuhan remains 27 unclear as of the submission date of this study on 25 February 2020. 28 The public panic in face of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak reminds us the history of the 1918 29 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom. Furthermore, its characteristics of mild symptoms 30 in most cases and short serial interval (i.e., 4-5 days) [4, 5] are similar to pandemic influenza, rather 31 than other two coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). In 1918, a significant proportion of 32 the deaths were from pneumonia followed influenza infection. Thus, it might be reasonable to revisit 33 the modelling framework of 1918 influenza pandemic, and in particular, to capture the effects of the 34 individual reaction (to the risk of infection) and government action. In [6], we proposed a model 35 incorporating individual reaction, holiday effects as well as weather conditions (temperature in London, 36 United Kingdom) which successfully captured the multiple-wave feature in the influenza-associated 37 mortality in London.\n\nIn this study, we followed the form of individual reaction and governmental action effects in [6], ex-39 cept for the effects of weather condition due to limited knowledge on weather effects on the transmission 40 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of coronaviruses. We note that the governmental action, in both 1918 and current time, summarized all measures including holiday extension, city lock-down, hospitalisation and quarantine of patients. We 42 presume it will last for the next few months for the moment, and will update later if things change. The 43 parameter values may be improved when more information is available. We argue that all prevention 44 and control measures may be categorised into two large groups, which are described by either a step 45 function or a response function, respectively. We also consider zoonotic transmission period of one 46 month and a huge emigration from Wuhan (35.7% of the population). Nevertheless, our model is a preliminary conceptual model, intending to lay a foundation for further modelling studies, but we can 48 easily tune our model so that the outcomes of our model are in line with the observation and previous 49 studies [3, 7] . cases (both reported and not reported). Let S, E, and I represent the susceptible, exposed and infec-55 tious populations and R represent the removed population (i.e., recovered or dead). In a recent study 56 [8], Wu and McGoogan found that 81% of cases were of mild symptom (without pneumonia or only 57 mild pneumonia), 14% were severe case with difficulty breathing, and 5% were critical with respiratory 58 failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. 59 We adopt the transmission rate function from [6]. We rename the school term effect as the gov-60 ernmental action effect, since the former belongs to the latter. We also assume a period of zoonotic 61 transmission during December 2019. We model the zoonotic transmission (denoted as F ) as a stepwise 62 function, which takes zero after the shutdown of Huanan seafood market (presumably). We then only 63 model the sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after this date, along with the emi-64 model is formulated as follows:\n\nwhere\n\n(2)\n\nThe efficient transmission rate, \u03b2(t) in Equation (2) such that the model outcomes (increments in cases) largely match the observed, with a reporting ratio.\n\nNamely only a proportion of the model generated cases will be reported in reality. Many evidences and 82 studies, e.g., [14, 15, 16] , suggest the reporting ratio is time-varying. We summarise our parameters in 83 Table 1 . 84 3 Data analyses 85 We summarise the officially reported data from Wuhan, China in Figure 2 . There is an increasing 86 trend of daily new confirmations and deaths. We argue that these data were heavily impacted by 87 availability of medical supplies and health care workers.\n\nThe official data report was not available before January 15, 2020. We fill the missing data before [24] . Thus, we assume a proportion of daily cases (reporting rate) will be reported 94 after 14 days since their infectiousness onset (which is generally no later than their symptom onset). 95 4 Model simulation 96 We show our simulations in Figure 4 . Under the naive scenario, we assume governmental action 97 strength \u03b1 = 0 and intensity of individual reaction \u03ba = 0, which is unlikely. The second scenario is when 98 we only consider \"individual reaction\", both the peak value and the number of cumulative cases are 99 substantially reduced. The third scenario is considering both \"individual reaction\" and \"governmental 100 action\", and the reduction becomes even further. We highlight the third scenario, as we know the Figure 2 : The daily number of (a) cases or (b) deaths, cumulative number of (c) cases or (d) deaths, and the percentage of (e) cases or (f) deaths, of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In panel (f), the 100% represents the count of deaths or cured cases.\n\n\u2022 Due to adjustment of the reporting policy, i.e., an effort to report all clinical cases accumulated in 115 the past few days/weeks, there are a few days where the number of reported cases are artificially 116 high than simulated cases. The reason is that the reported cases in these few days included clinical 117 cases but not laboratory confirmed that are accumulated in the past few days, also weeks.\n\nThe main purpose of this work is to propose a conceptual model to address the individual reaction 119 (controlled by \u03ba) and governmental action (controlled by \u03b1), as well as time-varying reporting rate. We 120 perform a simple sensitive analyses on \u03b1 and \u03ba in Figure 4 , where we can see that both \u03b1 and \u03ba are 121 needed to capture the observed pattern. In particular, when \u03b1 is around 0.9 and \u03ba is greater than 1100, 122 the simulated largely match the observed. q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q studies.\n\nIn this work, we focused on the transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Our conceptual 147 framework can be applied to other cities/countries, or be built into one (multiple-patched) model for 148 multiple cities/countries. Our model can be fitted to daily data when more information (e.g., daily 149 number of tests) is available. "}
