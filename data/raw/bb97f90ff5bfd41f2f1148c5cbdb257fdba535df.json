In total, we generated 56,565,928 sequence 92 reads that were de novo assembled and screened for potential aetiologic agents. Of the 93 384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit 8 , the longest (30,474 nucleotides [nt]) had high 94 abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate -bat-SL-CoVZC45 95 (GenBank Accession MG772933) -previously sampled in China, with a nt identity of 89.1% 96 (Table S1 and S2). The genome sequence of this novel virus, as well as its termini, were 97 determined and confirmed by RT-PCR 9 and 5'/3' RACE kits (TaKaRa), respectively. This 98 new virus was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has also been referred 99 to as '2019-nCoV') and its whole genome sequence (29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank 100 accession number MN908947. Remapping the RNA-seq data against the complete genome of 101 WHCV resulted in an assembly of 123,613 reads, providing 99.99% genome coverage at a 102 mean depth of 6.04X (range: 0.01X -78.84X) ( Figure S2 ). The viral load in the BALF sample 103 was estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to be 3.95\u00d710 8 copies/mL ( Figure S3 ). 104 The viral genome organization of WHCV was characterized by sequence alignment 105 against two representative members of the genus Betacoronavirus: a human-origin 106 coronavirus (SARS-CoV Tor2, AY274119) and a bat-origin coronavirus 107 MG772933) (Figure 2 ). The un-translational regions (UTR) and open reading frame (ORF) of 108 WHCV were mapped based on this sequence alignment and ORF prediction. The WHCV 109 viral genome was similar to these two coronaviruses (Figure 2 and Table S3) , with a gene to SARS-CoV in that it carries a predicted ORF8 gene (366 nt in length) located between the 119 M and N ORF genes. The functions of WHCV ORFs were predicted based on those of known 120 coronaviruses and given in Table S5 . In a manner similar to SARS CoV Tor2, a leader 121 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and nine putative body TRSs could be readily 122 identified upstream of the 5' end of ORF, with the putative conserved TRS core sequence 123 appeared in two forms -the ACGAAC or CUAAAC (Table S6) .\n\nTo determine the evolutionary relationships between WHCV and previously identified 125 coronaviruses, we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the 126 whole genome sequence, non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b, and the main structural The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.919183 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 82.3% amino acid (aa) identity (and ~77.2% aa identity to SARS CoV; Table S3 ), while in the 135 ORF1b phylogeny WHCV fell in a basal position within the subgenus Sarbecovirus ( Figure   136 3). This topological division was also observed in the phylogenetic trees estimated for 137 conserved domains in the replicase polyprotein pp1ab ( Figure S5 ).\n\nTo better understand the potential of WHCV to infect humans, the receptor-binding 139 domain (RBD) of its spike protein was compared to those in SARS-CoVs and bat SARS-like 140 CoVs. The RBD sequences of WHCV were more closely related to those of SARS-CoVs 141 (73.8%-74.9% aa identity) and SARS-like CoVs including strains Rs4874, Rs7327 and 142 Rs4231 (75.9%-76.9% aa identity) that are able to use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry 143 (Table S7) 10 . In addition, the WHCV RBD was only one amino acid longer than the SARS- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.919183 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 (HKU1 and OC43) ( Figure S6 ) that can bind to sialic acid 13 . In sum, the high similarities of 157 amino acid sequences and predicted protein structure between WHCV and SARS-CoV RBD 158 domains suggest that WHCV may efficiently use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, 159 perhaps facilitating human-to-human transmission 10, 14-15 .

To identify possible aetiologic agents present in the sequence data, the 346 abundance of the assembled contigs was first evaluated as the expected counts using the 347 RSEM program 28 implemented in Trinity. Non-human reads (23,712,657 reads), generated by 348 filtering host reads using the human genome (human release 32, GRCh38.p13, downloaded 349 from Gencode) by Bowtie2 29 , were used for the RSEM abundance assessment.\n\nAs the longest contigs generated by Megahit (30,474 nt) and Trinity (11,760 nt) both 351 had high similarity to the bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and were at 352 high abundance (Table S1 and S2), the longer one (30,474 nt) that covered almost the whole 353 virus genome was used for primer design for PCR confirmation and genome termini 354 determination.
