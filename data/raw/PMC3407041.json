{"title": "Structural Basis of Evasion of Cellular Adaptive Immunity by HIV-1 Nef", "body": "The C-terminal domain of the mouse \u03bc1 subunit (158\u2013423) of AP1 (a gift from Juan Bonifacino, NIH, Bethesda) was cloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS) 1 of the pCDFDuet vector (Novagen). A SARS CoV Mpro protease cleavage site 44,45 was introduced in between the N-terminal 6xHis tag and \u03bc1(158\u2013423). The MHC-I CD-Nef fusion was created as described earlier 10. The fusion gene was cloned into the MCS2 of the pCDFDuet vector. The pCDFDuet plasmid encoding both \u03bc1(158\u2013423) and CD-Nef genes was expressed in Rosetta cells in Terrific Broth. Cells were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at OD600 of 0.6 and grown at 16\u00b0C overnight. Proteins were first purified by Ni-NTA resin using the gravity-flow batch method. A subsequent purification step through a HiTrap Q anion exchange column produced the CD-Nef/\u03bc1 complex in good purity. The 6xHistag on \u03bc1 (158\u2013423) was then cleaved off using the SARS-CoV Mpro protease 44,45. A final gel filtration purification using a Sephadex 200 column yielded homogeneous monomeric CD-Nef/\u03bc1 complex. Selenomethionine-derivatized (Se-Met) proteins were expressed from the same vector using the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method 46. Purification of the Se-Met derivative of the protein complex was accomplished in the same way as described above for the native proteins.\n\nFor glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments, the C-terminal domain of the \u03bc1 subunit (158\u2013423) was cloned into a pMAT9s expression vector 47 containing a N-terminal 6xHistag followed by maltose binding protein (MBP) and a SARS-CoV Mpro cleavage site. The C-terminal domain of the mouse \u03bc2 subunit (159\u2013435) of AP2 was cloned into the pMAT9s expression vector in a similar fashion. The pMAT9s-\u03bc1 plasmid was co-expressed with the pGro7 vector (Takara Bio.), which encodes the groES and groEL chaperone proteins, in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in Terrific Broth. L-(+)-Arabinose was added to 2mg/ml to induce chaperone expression. Expression of MBP-\u03bc1 was later induced by 0.1 mM IPTG at OD600 of 0.6 and continued at 16\u00b0C overnight. The protein was purified to homogeneity by using Ni-NTA gravity flow, HiTrap SP cation exchange column, and Sephadex 200 gel filtration column. All MBP-\u03bc1 mutants (and the GST-CD-Nef mutants below) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method. The mutants of MBP-\u03bc1(158\u2013423) and wt MBP-\u03bc2 (159\u2013435) were expressed and purified similarly as for the wt MBP-\u03bc1.\n\nThe expression vector for the GST-tagged CD-Nef (pGEX-4T-1-CD-Nef) was created previously 10. GST-CD-Nef was expressed in Rosetta cells using conditions similar to that described above for the CD-Nef/\u03bc1 complex. GST-CD-Nef and its mutants are purified the same way. The protein was first bound to a GSTrap column, washed and eluted with buffer containing 10 mM glutathione. A final anion-exchange chromatography step (HiTrap Q column) yielded homogeneous protein.\n\nCrystallization of the protein complex was carried out using the microbatch under-oil method 48. Equal volumes (1.5 ul each) of the protein solution (3.5 mg/ml in 25 mM Tris, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP) and the precipitant solution (0.1M HEPES, pH 6.5, 3% PEG8000) were mixed. The drop was sealed using a mixture of paraffin and silicon oil at a 2:1 ratio. Crystals formed within 24 hours at room temperature and grew to full size in 5\u20136 days. Se-Met crystals were obtained similarly except that streak seeding was performed to obtain good-sized crystals.\n\nCrystals were cryo-protected using the precipitant solution containing 20% glycerol and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the NE-CAT beamline 24ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, and beamline X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Two forms of the native crystals were obtained in P21 and P212121 space groups and diffract to a resolution of 3.3 \u00c5 and 2.6 \u00c5, respectively. The Se-Met crystals are in P212121 space group and diffract to a resolution of 2.9 \u00c5. The statistics are summarized in Table 1.\n\nInitial phases for the Se-Met derivative data were obtained by using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method. Thirteen selenium sites were found using the program Shelx\n49 and subsequent SAD phasing was performed in SOLVE\n50. A 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) was identified using the Se sites. The phases were improved by a 2-fold NCS averaging using RESOLVE\n50. Two copies of both \u03bc1 (model PDB 1W63) 22 and Nef (model PDB 1EFN) 15 are located in the electron density map by the real space molecular replacement method using the CCP4 program Molrep\n51,52. Multi-domain multi-crystal averaging were carried out between the nonisomorphous native and the SeMet crystals using the program DMMulti\n53, which greatly improved the phases. Iterative rounds of model building in COOT\n54 and refinement with Refmac5\n55 and PHENIX\n56 were performed. Strong NCS restraint was applied initially and released gradually at the final stages of refinement. The final model has an Rwork/Rfree of 0.208/0.258. Ramachandran plot showed that 96.1% of the residues are in the favored region and the remaining 3.9% in the allowed region. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe purified proteins, GST-CD-Nef (0.16 mg) and MBP-\u03bc1(158\u2013423) (0.25 mg), or their mutants were mixed in a final volume of 100 ul and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1.5 hrs. The protein solution was then loaded onto a small gravity flow column containing 0.2 ml GST resin. Flow through was collected and the resin was extensively washed with 5 \u00d7 0.9 ml GST binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP). The bound proteins were eluted with 5 \u00d7 0.1 ml GST elution buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS PAGE stained with Coomassie blue.\n\nThe human T cell lines were either SupT1, which expresses HLA-A2 endogenously; or the stably transfected CEM derivative lines CEM 4B, which expresses Nef from a replication-defective provirus, or 4BNS, which is similar to 4B except that the provirus is nef-negative 57. Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I A2 (or related mutants) was measured by flow cytometric analysis of CD4-positive T cells of the CEM line, which express MHC-A1, either constitutively expressing Nef or not, transfected with a plasmid encoding the \u03b1-chain of MHC-I A2. For the transient expression experiments, 4\u00d7106 CEM cells/sample were transfected using Amaxa program X-001; or 3\u00d7106 SupT1 cells/sample were transfected using program O-017. All cellular samples were washed in medium without antibiotics, then resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of Amaxa Kit V Nucleofection reagent (Lonza, Germany). For the SupT1 cells, the plasmid DNA was 2 \u00b5g pCG-GFP (a gift from Jacek Skowronski, Case Western Reserve University, Ohio) plus 20 \u00b5g of pCI-Neo (Promega) encoding Nef or the indicated Nef-mutants. For the CEM 4B and 4BNS cells, the plasmid DNA was 2 \u00b5g pCG-GFP plus 20\u00b5g pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) encoding HLA-A2 (a gift from Olivier Schwartz, Pasteur Institute, Paris) or the indicated HLA-A2 mutants. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 16 hours, the cells were surface-stained while alive for HLA-A2, and the cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using a sheep antiserum to HIV-1 Nef (a gift from Celsa Spina, University of California, San Diego). For the flow cytometry, each sample was resuspended in 100\u00b5l PBS and stained using 10 \u00b5g/ml MA2.1 (a murine monoclonal antibody to HLA-A2, a gift from David Camerini, University of California, Irvine) for 30 minutes on ice, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to allophycocyanin, before fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde and two-color analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACS Canto flow cytometer.\n\nThe Nef/MHC-I CD/\u03bc1 complex adopts a clamp-like structure with the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail (residues 314\u2013332) held tightly in a long, narrow groove at the Nef and \u03bc1 interface (Fig. 1). The membrane-proximal end of MHC-I CD forms an extended strand that augments the \u03bc1 \u03b2-sheets at the side of the cargo recognition site, with Tyr320 of the MHC-I CD in the tyrosine-binding pocket of \u03bc1. The binding is secured by the proline-rich strand (PxxP repeats) of Nef that runs along the MHC-I CD to form the other arm of the clamp. Nef is further affixed to \u03bc1 by extensive contacts at the core domain and by crucial electrostatic interactions involving its acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65). The C-terminus of Nef, together with a region of \u03bc1 disordered in the previous structure 22, forms a snug pocket at one end of the binding groove to cradle a tight turn of the MHC-I CD (residues 327\u2013332) (Fig. 1c). The two membrane anchoring points, the N-termini of the MHC-I CD and Nef, are located on the same side of the complex, consistent with their membrane attachment roles in vivo.\n\nBoth Nef and \u03bc1 exhibit differences from their previously reported structures 15,22. The C-terminal domain of \u03bc1 (residues 158\u2013423) remains as a banana-shaped structure of mostly \u03b2-strands 22, with a slight twist (~10\u00b0) along its long axis upon complex formation (Supplementary Fig. 1). An unstructured region of \u03bc1 (residues 218\u2013231) becomes ordered to interact with both Nef and the MHC-I CD. The core domain of Nef has the same structure as seen previously, while the functionally important acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65) and the PxxP repeats (68\u201378) swing to a different trajectory to interact with \u03bc1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The N-terminal helix of Nef is observed for the first time to be attached to the protein\u2019s core, on the side opposite the MHC-I binding site (Fig. 1). Much of the Nef N- and C-terminal loops (27\u201356 and 162\u2013174) are disordered and not seen in the structure. In addition, the connecting region of the MHC-I CD/Nef fusion protein, including the last nine residues of MHC-I, a two-residue linker (TS), and the first four residues of Nef, is also disordered. This flexible region of 15 residues can span up to 55 \u00c5 in distance, while its two ends observed in the structure are only 28 \u00c5 apart, suggesting that the fusion linker is unlikely to cause any distortion of the structure.\n\nThe three-protein binding is cooperative in nature. A calculation of the buried interface areas predicts weak or no binding between any two components 23. The largest binary interface, 1058 \u00c52, occurs between Nef and \u03bc1 and falls into the category of weak, transient binding 24. The MHC-I/\u03bc1 and MHC-I/Nef interfaces bury 771 \u00c52 and 437 \u00c52, respectively, predicting that no binary complexes would form with MHC-I. In contrast, all three components together generate a total of 2266 \u00c52 buried area in a strong three-protein complex. This analysis also points to a possible sequence of the binding events. The association between Nef and AP1 may take place first as their buried surface area predicts the only likely binary binding event. The binding groove is then created at the Nef-\u03bc1 interface to sequester the MHC-I CD. Consistent with this scenario, we are able to show that the Nef-\u03bc1 binary complex can form at high protein concentrations (~30 \u03bcM) (Supplementary Fig. 2), although this interaction is not strong enough to be detected by in vitro pulldown 10. This is corroborated by the weak, binary interaction between Nef and \u03bc1 previously reported 6,25. Moreover, the binding of Nef to \u03bc1 is enhanced by the presence of the MHC-I CD 7,10, which further supports the cooperative nature of the three-protein interaction.\n\nThe tyrosine-containing sequence of MHC-I (YSQA) binds to the canonical Yxx\u03d5 recognition site on \u03bc1 (Fig. 2) with Tyr320 of MHC-I fitting snugly into the tyrosine-binding pocket 6,8\u201310. The binding geometry closely resembles that of the Yxx\u03d5 peptide binding to \u03bc2 of AP2 (Fig. 2a) 14. However, the lack of a bulky hydrophobic side chain at the Y+3 position (Fig. 2b) in the MHC-I CD (320-YSQA-323) results in an empty hydrophobic pocket on \u03bc1 (Fig. 2c), which explains why MHC-I is not recognized by AP1 in the absence of Nef. Nef therefore functions to compensate for this intrinsically defective binding and forces a tight association of the MHC-I CD with AP1.\n\nThe structure reveals that the Nef PxxP repeats lock the MHC-I CD onto \u03bc1 by forming a sidewall of the binding groove and by shaping a unique binding path between Nef and \u03bc1 (Fig. 2d). The crucial role of the Nef proline-rich region in modulating MHC-I is well documented 8,10,19,20,26. The last two PxxP repeats (72-PQVPLRP-78) form the major component of the sidewall of the MHC-I CD binding groove. This region of Nef likely plays a confinement role to prevent the MHC-I CD from diffusing away, as only weak van der Waals interactions occur between these two proteins along the groove, with all interatomic distances over 3.5 \u00c5. The Nef chain makes a 90-degree turn immediately upstream of the binding groove. This sharp turn is pivoted at the first PxxP repeat (69-PVTP-72) and is stabilized by stacking interactions with \u03bc1 (Fig. 2d). The turn changes Nef\u2019s binding trajectory on \u03bc1 and leads to an important electrostatic interaction involving the Nef 62-EEEE-65 residues (described below).\n\nThe Nef/MHC-I CD/\u03bc1 interaction has strong electrostatic characteristics, highlighted in two large, complementarily charged surface areas at the binding interface (Fig. 3a). Two prominent positively charged patches exist on \u03bc1 and are matched by two negatively charged patches on Nef and the MHC-I CD. Concentrated in these regions are numerous residues that are known to be important for Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation, although their mechanisms were previously unclear. The structure establishes a framework for understanding the precise functions of these residues and also reveals their previously unidentified interaction partners.\n\nA key electrostatic interaction occurs at the Nef acidic cluster, 62-EEEE-65, which is attracted to a basic patch on \u03bc1 (Fig. 3b). The functional importance of this acidic cluster has been well established 19,26,27. The interaction is long-range, where Glu65 is the only residue within hydrogen-bonding distance of \u03bc1 (Arg303). This long-range electrostatic interaction is supported by the previous finding that mutation of the Glu residues to uncharged residues abolished the Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I, while Asp substitutions had no effect 28. A quadruple mutation of \u03bc1 (K274E/K298E/K302E/R303D) that reverses the positive charge at the interface abolished binding to the MHC I-CD-Nef fusion protein in our in vitro pulldown assay (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, the interaction with the mutant \u03bc1 was completely restored by a complementary mutation that reverses the negative charge in the acidic cluster in Nef (EEEE->KKKK) (Fig. 3c), validating the role of this positively charged patch on \u03bc1.\n\nThe second major charged interface (Fig. 3a and 3d) involves a crucial three-way electrostatic network. This interaction involves residues Asp327 of MHC-I, Asp123 of Nef, and an elongated basic patch on \u03bc1 (Arg225, Arg393, Lys396, Arg211, and Arg246). These interactions shape one end of the binding groove and provide a second anchoring point at Asp327, in addition to Tyr320, for the MHC-I CD to latch into the groove. Mutation of either D327A in MHC-I or D123G in HIV-1 Nef abolishes the downregulation of MHC-I 9,26,29. However, unlike the previously proposed role of Asp123 in Nef dimerization 29, the crystal structure shows that this residue is essential because of the three-way electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the R225A/R393A double mutation in \u03bc1 abolished binding with the MHC I-CD-Nef fusion protein in vitro (Fig. 3c), as predicted from the structure.\n\nThe key roles of the two anchoring residues of the MHC-I CD, Tyr320 and Asp327, are reflected by the selective downregulation of MHC-I subtypes by Nef 30,31, where their presence is correlated with susceptibility to Nef (Supplementary Fig. 3). Residues Tyr320 and Asp327 are present in HLA-A and \u2013B, but are both missing in HLA-C, accounting for the selective downregulation of HLA-A and \u2013B, but not HLA-C, by Nef 6. The presence of Asn327 in HLA-C particularly supports that the interactions involving Asp327 in HLA-A and -B are electrostatic rather than hydrogen bonding.\n\nThe Nef C-terminus serves an indispensable role in establishing the three-way interaction network by stabilizing a structural change in \u03bc1 to complete the MHC-I CD binding groove (Fig. 3e). Residues 215\u2013233 of \u03bc1 rearrange from a disordered loop in the crystal structure of the AP1 core into a helix-turn motif when in complex with the MHC-I CD and Nef. The Nef C-terminus and the helix-turn motif of \u03bc1 constitute one end of the MHC-I CD binding groove, which cradles the tight turn of MHC-I residues 327\u2013332 (Fig. 1c and 3e). The stabilization of the helix-turn motif also places Arg225 of \u03bc1 in position to participate in the important three-way electrostatic interaction described above.\n\nThe essential function of the Nef C-terminus was verified in biochemical and functional assays (Fig. 3c,f). A double mutation (Y202A/F203A) or a five-residue C-terminal truncation (202\u2013206) of Nef abolished complex formation in vitro. These mutations also abolished the downregulation of cell-surface MHC-I detected by flow cytometry when Nef was expressed in human T lymphocytes, the primary host cells of HIV-1 in vivo. Single mutations of either Y202A or F203A also dramatically disrupted complex formation in vitro.\n\nThe structure also suggests a novel role for the Nef N-terminal helix9,20,26 (residues 6\u201323): positioning the Nef core at an optimal distance from the lipid membrane for efficient interaction with the MHC-I CD and AP1 (Fig. 4a). This helix, as part of the flexible N-terminus of Nef, was previously predicted to be detached from the core 32. It is nonetheless important, as deletion of part of it, or mutation of Met20 within the helix, abolishes the Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I 9,20,26. Our structure shows instead that the helix is anchored via two hydrophobic residues, Trp13 and Met20, to the surface of the Nef core opposite the MHC-I binding site. Rather than directly participating in intermolecular binding, the N-terminal helix-core association is predicted to bring the Nef core close to the membrane, facilitating interaction with the MHC-I CD and the AP1 complex. Consistent with an important helix-core anchoring interaction, either W13A or M20A mutation in Nef abolished the downregulation of MHC-I in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 4b). Mutations of the two residues also inhibited complex formation in our in vitro pulldown assays (Fig. 4c). The identification of two adjacent mutations with the same phenotype supports the role of the anchoring interaction in Nef function.\n\nSpecific interaction between \u03bc1 and Nef may also determine Nef\u2019s selective utilization of AP1 rather than AP2 for MHC-I downregulation (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The sequences of \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 differ significantly in the regions that enable \u03bc1 to interact with Nef. In the region corresponding to the Nef-induced \u03bc1 helix-turn structure, a much longer loop exists in \u03bc2, which is unlikely to adopt the same conformation (Supplementary Fig. 4). \u03bc2 also lacks the important Tyr residue (Tyr374 in \u03bc1) that stacks onto Nef Pro72 to stabilize the sharp Nef turn (Fig. 2 and 5). Furthermore, \u03bc2 does not have the essential basic patch that attracts the Nef acidic cluster to secure the complex formation. Indeed, the Nef-MHC-I CD construct does not interact with \u03bc2 in our in vitro pulldown experiments (Fig. 5c). These differences highlight an important distinction between the two otherwise highly homologous \u03bc subunits in AP1 and AP2, which may contribute to different interactions with distinct cellular sorting proteins and cargos. The lack of interaction between Nef and \u03bc2 also suggests an explanation for why Nef uses a distinct mode of interaction -its acidic dileucine motif and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2- to downregulate CD4 33,34.\n\nA picture of the Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I emerges when our structure is overlaid with the crystal structure of the \u201copen\u201d form of the AP2 core by superposition of the \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 C-terminal domains (Fig. 6) 35. A striking co-planar arrangement is revealed for the Nef N-terminal myristoylation site, the MHC-I CD membrane-proximal end, and multiple phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding sites on AP2 35, consistent with the formation of the complex along the lipid bilayer in vivo. The co-planar arrangement of all of the membrane attachment sites underlines the accuracy of this model. Through myristoylation and the anchoring of its N-terminal helix to the core, Nef is positioned at an optimal distance from the lipid membrane to bind the AP1 complex, an event that likely occurs after the recruitment of AP1 to the membrane by the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) 36,37. The Nef-\u03bc1 interaction may also contribute to induce the active, open conformation of AP1, through electrostatic attractions resembling those involving the PIP2-containing membranes 35. This interaction likely further stabilizes the membrane-association of AP1, as we have reported before 38. The association of Nef and AP1 then creates a snug binding groove for the recruitment of the MHC-I CD and ultimately leads to packaging of MHC-I into the clathrin-coated vesicle.\n\nNef uses a wide range of structural features throughout its entire length to hijack the AP-1 complex and modulate the cell surface expression of MHC-I. Perhaps due to its highly cooperative nature, the interaction is very delicate: mutation of any of its key elements disrupts the complex and causes the loss of Nef activity. This provides a clear explanation for the observation that virtually every domain in Nef required for the modulation of MHC-I is also required for the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins from human cells 26. Moreover, our model explains why the dileucine motif in the C-terminus of native Nef is not active during the downregulation of MHC-I, yet it is functional as a trafficking signal when Nef is fused to the CD of MHC-I 39. Our structure shows the cooperative Nef/MHC-I CD/\u00b51 ternary interaction is key to the recruitment of MHC-I to AP1. This conformation, however, precludes the involvement of Nef's dileucine motif as the binding site for [ED]xxxL[LI] motifs on the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits of AP1 40 is too distant (Fig. 6). In contrast, when MHC-I is covalently linked to Nef, the critical MHC-I recruitment step is bypassed, and any trafficking signal in Nef, including the dileucine motif, can contribute to the trafficking of the MHC-I-Nef fusion protein. Nevertheless, the principle of cooperative binding likely also applies to the mechanism by which Nef modulates CD4 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and AP2 41, even though that interaction involves the dileucine motif of Nef and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2 rather than \u00b52.\n\nOur structure supports the notion of Nef as a virally encoded clathrin associated sorting protein (CLASP), which alters the breadth and specificity of cargo recognition by AP complexes 12. The cooperative binding mechanism by which Nef enables an AP complex to recognize a suboptimal sorting sequence could be utilized by cellular CLASPs. For example, in murine MHC-I, the tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr320 is required for the \"cross-presentation\" of exogenous antigens by dendritic cells, an event required for the priming of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes 42. This observation, together with the role of Tyr320 in the Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I via AP1, led us and others to speculate that cross-presentation might involve AP-1 and a cellular CLASP that is reminiscent of HIV-1 Nef 8,9. Moreover, the positively charged clusters on \u03bc1 that contribute to the interaction between Nef and the MHC-I CD may function as binding sites for the acidic trafficking motifs of cellular proteins. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor contains acidic clusters that include glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phospho-serine residues, and these sequences contribute to the interaction with AP1 43.\n\nFinally, the narrow binding groove for MHC-I formed by Nef and \u03bc1 is an attractive target for a small molecule that would inhibit the Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation pathway. Inhibition of this Nef activity would sensitize infected cells to killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and potentially facilitate control of the infection by the host."}
