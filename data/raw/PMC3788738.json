{"title": "Use of a Safe, Reproducible, and Rapid Aerosol Delivery Method to Study Infection by Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei in Mice", "body": "\nBurkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium found in water and wet soils of endemic areas bordering the equator, particularly Southeast Asia and Northern Australia [1-10]. The organism infects most mammals and causes the disease melioidosis in humans [1-10]. Clinical manifestations vary greatly and may present as flu-like symptoms, benign pneumonitis, acute/chronic pneumonia, or fulminating septicemia. Infection generally occurs via inhalation of aerosols or through skin abrasions, and the risk of contracting the disease is proportional to the concentration of B. pseudomallei in soil and water. In endemic areas, heavy rainfalls result in a shift from percutaneous inoculation to inhalation as the primary mode of infection, which also leads to a more severe illness. Melioidosis commonly affects the lungs and is characterized by the spread and seeding of bacteria to the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. The incubation period is not clearly defined, but may range from 2 days to many years. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, thalassemia, and chronic lung disease. Most infected patients become bacteremic and the mortality rates remain high (19-51%) despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy. Burkholderia pseudomallei is refractory to most antibiotics and resistance mechanisms include efflux pumps and \u03b2-lactamases [1-10]. The recommended treatment for melioidosis entails the use of ceftazidime and meropenem (intensive phase) and TMP-SMX and co-amoxiclav (eradication phase) for several months [11]. Response to treatment is slow and eradication of B. pseudomallei is difficult to achieve, resulting in recrudescence [1-10]. Though considered exotic to the US and most European countries, B. pseudomallei is a leading cause of sepsis and bacteremic pneumonia in endemic areas, and melioidosis is recognized as an emerging infectious disease in many tropical regions of the world [12-14].\n\n\nBurkholderia mallei is a non-motile, host-adapted clone of B. pseudomallei that does not persist outside of its equine reservoir and is endemic to parts of Asia, Africa, the middle East, and South America [8,9,15-21]. Burkholderia mallei causes the highly contagious zoonotic disease glanders, which primarily affects horses, mules, and donkeys. In humans, infection generally occurs by contact with infected animals via the cutaneous or respiratory route. Disease progression and pathology in humans and horses are similar, though the clinical presentation of any 2 cases in the same species, even if related by direct transmission, may vary. The clinical manifestations include febrile pneumonia with necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, or pustular skin lesions and development of multiple abscesses (AKA farcy). Most patients become bacteremic and B. mallei disseminates to the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes where it rapidly causes necrosis. The course of disease may range from acute and rapidly fatal to very slow and protracted with alternating remissions and exacerbations. Even with antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate for human glanders is 50%. Like B. pseudomallei, B. mallei is resistant to most antibiotics [8,9,15-24].\n\nThere is concern that B. mallei and B. pseudomallei may be used as agents of biological warfare, especially since B. mallei has already been utilized in this manner [19,25-30]. Burkholderia pseudomallei was studied by the US and Russia as a potential bioweapon, but was never used in this capacity [25,31,32]. However, the ease of acquiring B. pseudomallei from the environment coupled with its resistance to antibiotics, severity of illness upon aerosol inoculation, difficulties in diagnosis, and persistence in the host make this possibility a serious concern. If the organism was cultured, concentrated, and delivered as an aerosol, significant casualties would ensue. For these reasons, the US Federal Select Agent Program classifies B. pseudomallei and B. mallei as Tier 1 agents, and the development of countermeasures is a priority. Protection against the pulmonary form of glanders and melioidosis is of particular interest as the lung is the most likely portal of entry for the organisms during a biologic attack.\n\nThe most commonly used surrogate to study B. mallei and B. pseudomallei is the mouse, and intranasal inoculation has generally been utilized to model the aerosol route of infection [8,33-40]. The method is quick, cost-effective, and relies on the mouse breathing in the agent, hence mimicking the natural route of aerosol infection for human disease. The availability of transgenic strains and the wealth of murine immunological tools provide a powerful platform to study and understand pathogenesis by the organisms and develop anti-infective approaches. However, unlike humans, mice are obligate nasal breathers and possess a greater surface area in their upper respiratory tract in addition to enhanced olfactory senses [41,42]. Consequently, intranasal inoculation results in a significant proportion of the inoculum remaining in the nasal passages (and not reaching the lungs) [43,44], and leads to high rates of infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system (via olfactory tissues), which are not common in humans [37,45,46]. Moreover, intranasal inoculation entails inhalation of a liquid suspension, not small-aerosolized particles. Whole-body and nose-only aerosol exposure models have been utilized to study B. mallei and B. pseudomallei [47-52]. Though these platforms deliver small aerosol particles, they too depend on the normal the mouse breathing in the agent through the nasal passageways and favor the aforementioned alternative portals of entry into the body. Furthermore, whole-body and nose-only exposure models require specialized equipment and dedicated BSL3 laboratory space, which can be cost-prohibitive and not practical at most research facilities.\n\nThe aim of this study was to develop a non-invasive, rapid, reproducible, practical, and safe aerosol delivery method to study the pulmonary form of glanders and melioidosis in BALB/c mice, without the potentially misleading effect of infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system. This model could then be used to investigate the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei and aid in the development of relevant countermeasures for these highly pathogenic organisms.\n\n\nEscherichia coli was cultured using Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Fisher BioReagents) supplemented with 15 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol. Burkholderia pseudomallei strain 1026b [53] was grown on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA; BD Difco\u2122) for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C prior to infection. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavages, and tissue homogenates from mice infected with B. pseudomallei 1026b were plated on TSA containing 100 \u00b5g/mL polymyxin B and agar plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours in order to count colonies and calculate bacterial loads in tissues. Burkholderia mallei strain ATCC23344 [54] was routinely cultured on Brucella broth Agar supplemented with 4% (vol/vol) Glycerol (BAG, BD-BBL\u2122). To prepare the inoculum for infection, B. mallei ATCC23344 was grown on BAG for 42 hours at 37\u00b0C. Homogenized tissues, lavage fluids, and blood from infected mice were spread onto BAG supplemented with 8 \u00b5g/mL polymixin B and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours to determine the number of viable B. mallei bacteria in tissues. All experiments with live B. pseudomallei and B. mallei were performed inside a Class II Biosafety Cabinet in a BSL3 laboratory and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nFemale BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks of age) were purchased from Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. Before inoculation, mice were anesthetized by injecting 2, 2, 2 Tribromoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae) intraperitoneally at a dose of 250 mg/kg. Once anesthetized, mice were placed on their back in a specially designed workstand inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0 (Hallowell EMC). This workstand is outfitted with a nylon wire, to suspend animals by their upper teeth, and lateral barriers to minimize movement during inoculation. Next, a fiber optic arm equipped with a light source (Fisher Scientific) was placed over the front of the throat of suspended animals in order to visualize the tracheal opening. The mouth of the mouse was opened and the tongue was moved to the side with forceps. A modified pediatric otoscope (Braintree Scientific, Inc) was then used to guide the blunt needle portion of a MicroSprayer\u00ae model I-1C (PennCentury\u2122) inside the tracheal opening and between the vocal cords. A total of 50 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension was subsequently delivered into the lungs using the gas-tight, high-pressure syringe component of the MicroSprayer\u00ae device.\n\n\nBurkholderia pseudomallei and B. mallei bacteria used to inoculate mice were cultured on agar plates and suspended in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to an optical density of 250 Klett units using a Klett\u2122 Colorimeter (Scienceware\u00ae), which corresponds to ~1X109 colony forming units (CFU) per mL. The bacterial suspensions were serially diluted and 100 \u00b5L aliquots were immediately spread onto agar plates to determine the number of CFU present in the inoculum. This back-titration of the inoculum was performed for all challenge experiments. Infected mice were monitored twice daily for clinical signs of illness over a period of up to 30 days. At the indicated experimental end points, animals were anesthetized and euthanized. Tissues (blood, lungs, spleen) were aseptically collected, homogenized with disposable tissue grinders (Fisherbrand\u00ae), serially diluted, and plated on agar medium to calculate bacterial loads. Survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. LD50 values were calculated according to Reed and Muench [55].\n\nInfected animals were monitored twice daily. Humane end-points were strictly observed. Mice exhibiting signs of moderate to severe discomfort were euthanized. This was accomplished by anesthetizing the animals with 2, 2, 2 Tribromoethanol followed by cervical dislocation. This procedure is in accordance with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. The following grading system was used to determine if euthanasia was appropriate: WEIGHT LOSS >20% = 3 points; BODY CONDITION (rough coat) and EMACIATION (evident segmentation of vertebral column and/or dorsal pelvic bones readily palpable) = 1 point; MODERATE DYSPNEA (based on thoracic movement and respiratory rate) = 1 point; HUNCH BACK = 1 point; FAILURE TO RESPOND TO STIMULI = 3 points; CONJUNCTIVITIS (eyes swelling shut, no apparent ophthalmic discharge) = 1 point. Any animal with a point score \u22653 was humanely euthanized. Pain and suffering of the animals were minimized by performing all procedures under anesthesia and by observing the aforementioned humane end-points. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Analgesics were not used as they may have affected the experimental outcomes of the studies.\n\nTo investigate pathologic changes induced by the organisms in the lung, bronchoalveolar lavage cells were collected and inspected by microscopy. Under anesthesia, the trachea of mice was exposed and an incision was made through the midline. The blunt end of a 23-gauge needle was next inserted through the tracheal incision. Using a 1-cc syringe, sterile 0.9% saline was infused into the lungs and fluids (~ 1-ml) were recovered by gentle suction. These bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were processed within 1-2 hr of collection to insure cell morphology was maintained. Specifically, 0.3-mL aliquots were placed into wells of duplicate disposable sample concentrators, each of which containing a slide. The BALF were then centrifuged at 1,000-rpm for 5-min using a StatSpin\u00ae Cytofuge (Iris\u00ae Sample Processing). The slides were removed from the cell concentrators, air-dried for 10-min, fixed by immersing in 100% anhydrous methanol, and stained with modified Wright-Giemsa using an automated Aerospray\u00ae Hematology Slide Stainer (Wescor\u00ae Biomedical Systems). All samples were examined by a board-eligible veterinary clinical pathologist. Cytologic evaluations were performed by microscopy using an Olympus Bx51 microscope (Olympus Corporation). Images were captured using an Olympus DP71 camera and software (Olympus Corporation).\n\nStandard molecular biology techniques were performed as described elsewhere [56,57]. Genomic DNA was obtained from plate-grown bacteria using the Easy-DNA\u2122 kit (Invitrogen\u2122 Life Technologies\u2122). Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase was used in cloning experiments per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Invitrogen\u2122 Life Technologies\u2122). A 2.2-kb amplicon encompassing amino acids (aa) 25-750 of the B. pseudomallei 1026b BoaA protein (GenBank accession number EF423807) was generated with primers P1 (5\u2019- CGC CAC\nGTG AAT GGG ACC GTC AAC TCG -3\u2019; PmlI site underlined) and P2 (5\u2019- GGT\nTAA\nTTA\nAAG ATT AGT GAT CTT CAC GGG -3\u2019; PacI site underlined). This DNA fragment was excised from an agarose gel, purified with the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Applied Science), restricted with the endonucleases PmlI and PacI (New England Biolabs\u00ae Inc.), and ligated into the PmlI and PacI sites of the vector pETcoco-1 (specifies N-terminal His-tag, EMD Millipore), yielding plasmid pELHisBoaA. This plasmid was sequenced to verify that no mutations were introduced during PCR and to confirm that the protein expressed from pELHisBoaA corresponds to residue 25-750 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BoaA joined to six N-terminal histidine residues. Plasmid DNA used as template in sequencing reactions was obtained with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). A similar approach was used to obtain the plasmid pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027 (expresses residues 392-1068 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BPSL1631-BMA1027 ORF), and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 (specifies residues 25-690 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BPSS0908-BMAA1324 ORF). The PCR products cloned into pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027, and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 were amplified with primers P3 (5\u2019- CCC AAG\nCTT CAG CTT TAC ACG CTC CAG -3\u2019; HindIII site underlined) and P4 (5\u2019- GGT\nTAAT\nTAA AGC AAC TGG CCG ACG TTG AC -3\u2019; PacI site underlined), and P5 (5\u2019- CCC AAG\nCTT GGC GAG AAC GCC TAT GCC GGC -3\u2019; HindIII site underlined) and P6 (5\u2019- GGT\nTAA\nTTA\nAAG GAC CTT CTG ATC CGT GTA CTG -3\u2019; PacI site underlined), respectively. Genomic DNA was used as the template in all PCR-based cloning experiments. The designation BPSxxxxx-BMAxxxxx refers to the locus tag numbers of the ORF under study in the annotated genomic sequence of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 [58] and B. mallei ATCC23344 [54], respectively, which are readily available through NCBI.\n\nPlasmids were sequenced at the University of Michigan sequencing core (http://seqcore.brcf.med.umich.edu/). Chromatograms were analyzed and assembled with the Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation). Sequence analysis was performed using Vector NTI (Invitrogen\u2122 Life Technologies\u2122).\n\nHis-tagged recombinant proteins were obtained as previously outlined by our laboratory [59,60]. Briefly, the plasmids pELHisBoaA, pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027, and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 were introduced in the E. coli strain TUNER\u2122 (EMD Millipore) for the purpose of overexpressing and purifying recombinant proteins. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, final concentration of 1 mM) to broth cultures and incubating for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C with agitation (200-rpm). Bacteria were pelleted, followed by treatment with the BugBuster\u00ae HT protein extraction reagent (EMD Millipore) supplemented with rLysozyme\u2122 (EMD Millipore) under the recommended conditions. Recombinant proteins were then purified using the His Bind Resin\u00ae System (EMD Millipore) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Donald E. Woods at the University of Calgary kindly provided capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and oligosaccharide chain of LPS (OPS). The molecules were purified from the B. pseudomallei strains SR1015 (CPS- mutant of B. pseudomallei 1026b [61], used to purify OPS) and MB100 (LPS- mutant of B. pseudomallei 1026b [62], used to purify CPS).\n\nDuplicate wells of Immulon\u2122 2HB plates (Thermo Scientific Nunc) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with ~1 \u00b5g of antigen. Excess unbound antigen was removed by washing the wells with PBS+0.05% Tween 20, and the wells were then filled with PBS+0.05% Tween 20 containing 3% (wt/vol) dry milk and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with PBS+0.05% Tween 20, the wells were probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS+0.05% Tween 20 + 3% dry milk. After this incubation, the wells were washed with PBS+0.05% Tween 20, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (SouthernBiotech) and diluted in PBS+0.05% Tween 20+3% dry milk. After washing off the excess secondary antibodies with PBS+0.05% Tween 20, 100 \u00b5L of the SureBlue\u2122 TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL) was added to wells. Color development, indicative of antibody binding to antigen, was measured by determining the absorbance of well contents at a wavelength of 650 nm using a \u03bcQuant\u2122 Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek\u00ae).\n\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of Georgia\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as well as by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).\n\n\nBurkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei infections generally occur via percutaneous inoculation or inhaling aerosols. The respiratory route of infection, and ensuing pulmonary disease, are also of particular concern with respect to the use of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei as agents of biological warfare. Hence, we developed a mouse model of aerosol inoculation to study the organisms. Our model entails the use of a MicroSprayer\u00ae (PennCentury\u2122) to deliver bacteria directly into the lungs. The device generates aerosols from the tip of a bent needle attached to a high-pressure stainless steel syringe that contains the agent. A modified pediatric otoscope is used to introduce the needle part of the MicroSprayer\u00ae into the trachea of anesthetized mice, and 50 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension is aerosolized into the airway. To our knowledge, this inoculation method has not been reported for B. pseudomallei or B. mallei.\n\nThe MicroSprayer\u00ae produces a mist of particles with a mean mass aerodynamic diameter of 8 \u00b5M [63]. Because the aerosol is generated by pushing fluid through an atomizer (sapphire) located at the tip of the needle part of the device, we tested whether this procedure affects the viability of B. pseudomallei and/or B. mallei. Bacterial suspensions containing 105 organisms per mL were loaded into the high-pressure syringe component of the MicroSprayer\u00ae and a 50 \u00b5L dose was sprayed into 1 mL of PBS, serially diluted, and plated onto agar medium to calculate the number of viable bacteria. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 1A and demonstrate that the use of the MicroSprayer\u00ae does not adversely impact viability of the agents. Experiments were also performed to verify that the number of viable organisms delivered into the lungs of mice is consistent with the number of bacteria in the inoculum. To accomplish this, plate-grown Burkholderia were suspended in PBS to concentrations of 1X106, 1X105 and 1X104 cells per mL, serially-diluted, and plated onto agar medium to calculate the number of viable organisms in the inoculum prior to infection. The MicroSprayer\u00ae was then used to deliver the agents in the murine lungs. Thirty minutes post-inoculation, mice were euthanized (n=3 mice per dose) and their lungs were collected, homogenized, diluted, and plated on agar medium to determine bacterial loads. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 1B and indicate that the number of organisms deposited into the lungs is equivalent to the inoculum.\n\nNext, we determined the median lethal dose of B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344 according to the method of Reed and Muench [55]. Cohorts of mice were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the organisms using the MicroSprayer\u00ae and monitored for clinical signs of illness and morbidity for a period of up to 30 days. Based on the data shown in Figure 2, the calculated LD50 for the agents are 5,100 \u00b1 820 (B. pseudomallei 1026b) and 818 \u00b1 173 CFU (B. mallei ATCC23344). The value for strain ATCC23344 is consistent with published reports utilizing alternative aerosol delivery methods. Using the intranasal route of inoculation, the LD50 has been reported to be 820 CFU [39]. The use of whole body aerosol exposure chamber produced values of 1X103-1.8X103 organisms [47,50,64]. The LD50 of B. pseudomallei 1026b in our model is higher than that reported for the intranasal route of inoculation and whole body exposure chamber, which were calculated to be 1 X 103 and 10 CFU, respectively [39,50]. Factors such as the age and weight of mice, and how bacteria were cultured prior to infection (i.e. broth versus plate-grown), may account for this difference. The intranasal route of inoculation and the use of the whole body exposure chamber entail mice breathing in the agent through the nasal passages and can cause infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system (in addition to pulmonary disease), which could have contributed to the lower LD50 in these models. Intratracheal inoculation with the MicroSprayer\u00ae circumvents the mouse nasal passageways and may have reduced the potentially confounding complications due to infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system, resulting in a higher LD50 value for B. pseudomallei 1026b.\n\nThe clinical progression of disease was found to be very similar for both organisms and can be divided in the 3 stages depicted in Figure 3. Mice in Stage 2 develop chronic infection (characterized by lung granulomas and spleen abscesses, data not shown) or progress to Stage 3, which is characterized by conjunctivitis, significantly reduced mobility, considerable weight loss, and difficulty breathing. Animals that progress to Stage 3 invariably succumbed to infection within 48 hours. All animals infected with the MicroSprayer\u00ae developed disease, even with inoculating doses as low as 9 (B. pseudomallei 1026b, Figure 2A) and 22 (B. mallei ATCC23344, Figure 2D) organisms. Taken together, these data indicate that we have developed a highly reproducible, sensitive, consistent, and accurate aerosol inoculation method to study B. mallei and B. pseudomallei infection.\n\nTo examine the kinetics of replication and dissemination, mice were challenged with 102, 103 and 104 bacteria, which correspond to roughly 0.1, 1 and 10 LD50. Animals were then sacrificed at four different time points post-challenge (24, 48, 72 and 96-hr), and bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen and blood were determined. Additionally, lungs were collected 30-min after inoculation to calculate the number of viable organisms administered.\n\nThe organ most heavily infected by B. pseudomallei and B. mallei was the lung (Figure 4A and 4B). Between 30-min and 48-hr post-infection, the number of viable B. mallei bacteria increased by 2 orders of magnitude, regardless of the dose used to inoculate animals (Figure 4B). Thereafter, bacterial numbers continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate, to reach a maximum of 108 (dose 1, 10 LD50), 107 (dose 2, 1 LD50), and 105 (dose 3, 0.1 LD50) CFU at 96-hr. Burkholderia pseudomallei replicated at a faster rate than B. mallei during the first 48-hr of infection, as bacterial numbers increased 1000-fold for all 3 inoculating doses (Figure 4A). In mice infected with 10 LD50, B. pseudomallei loads reached ~ 5X107 CFU by 72-hr, and all animals succumbed to infection before the 96-hr time point. In mice challenged with 1 LD50, the bacterial numbers rose from ~2X106 to nearly 108 organisms between 48 and 96-hr post-infection. In contrast, a 100-fold reduction in CFU was measured during the same time period in mice inoculated with the equivalent of 0.1 LD50 of B. pseudomallei.\n\nBoth agents were first detected in the spleen at 24-hr post-challenge (Figure 4C and 4D). Burkholderia pseudomallei disseminated to the organ in greater numbers than B. mallei, especially at the challenge doses of 10 and 1 LD50. Between 24 and 72-hr, the number of viable B. mallei bacteria increased by 4 orders of magnitude for all 3 inocula (Figure 4D). Thereafter, bacterial loads in animals infected with 0.1 and 1 LD50 reached a plateau of 105 and 104 CFU, respectively, whereas the number of B. mallei cells in the spleen of mice challenged with 10 LD50 continued to increase up to 106 organisms at 96-hr. Twenty-four hours after infection, the spleen of mice inoculated with 10 LD50 of B. pseudomallei were heavily colonized and the agent continued to proliferate, nearly reaching 108 bacteria at 72-hr. Between 24 and 48-hr post-challenge, the bacterial loads in the spleen of animals inoculated with 1 and 0.1 LD50 increased 50-fold. From that point forward, the bacterial counts remained constant in mice infected with 1 LD50, but steadily declined to undetectable levels by 96-hr in animals challenged with 0.1 LD50.\n\n\nBurkholderia pseudomallei was first cultured from the bloodstream 24-hr post-infection and the bacterial counts were proportional to the number of organisms delivered in the lungs with the MicroSprayer\u00ae (Figure 4E). The presence of the agent in peripheral blood at 24-hr, and colonization of the spleen with commensurate bacterial numbers at the same time point (Figure 4C), suggest dissemination via the bloodstream. In mice infected with 1 and 10 LD50, the numbers of viable bacteria in blood continue to rise and reached 105 CFU/ml at the experimental end-points (Figure 4E). Though B. pseudomallei was cultured from the bloodstream of animals infected with 0.1 LD50 during the first 48-hr post-challenge, the bacterial loads peaked at 101 CFU/ml at 48-hr and no bacteria were cultured from peripheral blood thereafter. Burkholderia mallei was not recovered from the blood at 24-hr post-infection, regardless of the dose used to inoculate animals (Figure 4F). The organism was first detected 48-hr post-infection in mice challenged with 10 LD50, and only at the 72 and 96-hr time points in animals inoculated with 1 and 0.1 LD50, respectively. The early, rapid replication of B. mallei in the lungs, the colonization of the spleen at 24 and 48-hr (Figure 4D), and the absence of bacteria in the bloodstream at those specific time points (Figure 4F), especially in mice infected with 1 and 0.1 LD50, suggest that B. mallei was phagocytized by alveolar macrophages and disseminated primarily via the lymphatic system. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of phagocytosed bacilli in macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavages (see below). More definitive experiments are needed to determine the precise mechanism(s) by which the bacteria disseminate from the site of infection to peripheral sites.\n\nAltogether, these experiments demonstrate that B. pseudomallei and B. mallei rapidly replicate to large numbers in the lungs and disseminate to colonize the spleen within 24-hr post-infection. At the lower challenge dose of 102 organisms, replication of B. pseudomallei 1026b was controlled in the lungs, spleen and blood during the first 96-hr post infection, which correlated with mice developing chronic infection. This was not observed in animals infected with B. mallei ATCC23344, even though most mice infected with 102 bacteria also developed chronic infection.\n\nTo investigate pathologic changes induced by the organisms, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were collected from mice 72-hr post-challenge and examined by microscopy. Portions of these fluids (and lung homogenates) were also diluted and plated onto agar medium to determine bacterial loads (Figure 5). The animals were infected with 102, 103 and 104 bacteria, while control mice were inoculated with 50 \u00b5L of sterile PBS using the MicroSprayer\u00ae.\n\nThe bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from control mice appeared normal, consisting of occasional clusters of ciliated columnar (respiratory) epithelial cells and rare alveolar macrophages (Figure 6A). No inflammatory infiltrates were observed in these animals. In contrast, BALF from mice infected with B. mallei ATCC23344 or B. pseudomallei 1026b were inflamed, consisting primarily of degenerate neutrophils (neutrophils that have lost ability to control water homeostasis and have swollen, eosinophilic nuclei) and activated macrophages with few, if any, respiratory epithelial cells. Degenerate neutrophils form in the presence of bacterial endotoxins like LPS, which are known to perforate their nuclear and cellular membranes. For this reason, the presence of degenerate neutrophils in cytologic preparations, even in the absence of bacteria, suggests bacterial infection [65,66]. Neutrophils ingest bacteria by receptor-mediated phagocytosis, a process which internalizes bacteria within a vacuole (e.g. phagosome) with the ultimate goal of fusing that vacuole with a lysosome, where bacteria are digested [67,68]. While the presence of extracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils suggests infection, the presence of intracellular bacteria, specifically bacteria contained within intracytoplasmic vacuoles, is indicative of bacterial infection [65,66]. Several neutrophils and macrophages were found to contain phagocytosed bacteria, confirming active infection. The BALF from infected mice also contained cellular debris and free nuclei, which along with the presence of degenerate neutrophils, indicate on-going cell necrosis, presumably due to bacterial endotoxins like LPS. Some lavage samples appeared hemorrhagic, as they possessed low to moderate numbers of erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) and/or macrophages with intracellular RBCs and hemosiderin pigment (hemoglobin breakdown product from RBCs). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mice infected with 104 organisms possessed the greatest bacterial burden and marked pyogranulomatous inflammation (Figure 6B), while animals inoculated with 102 CFU displayed moderate bacterial numbers and degree of inflammation (data not shown). The BALF from mice infected with 103 organisms demonstrated intermediate inflammation and bacterial burden (Figure 6C and 6D). Overall, no cytologic differences were observed between BALF from mice infected with B. mallei ATCC23344 and B. pseudomallei 1026b in terms of the type or magnitude of inflammation (when comparing equivalent inoculating doses). Additionally, the presence of hemorrhage and intracellular bacilli in BALF suggests that both organisms may disseminate by both lymphatic and hematogenous routes via infected macrophages or as extracellular bacilli, which is consistent with the results depicted in Figure 4 at the 72-hr time point.\n\nTo gain insight into the immune response to the organisms, we tested survivor sera for the presence of antibodies against a panel of surface-associated Burkholderia antigens. Figure 7 shows that infected mice produced antibodies against capsular polysaccharides (CPS, panel A), the oligosaccharide chain of LPS (OPS, panel B), the adhesin BoaA (panel C), and the predicted autotransporter proteins BPSL1631-BMA1027 (panel D) and BPSS0908-BMAA1324 (panel E).\n\nCPS and OPS are the most abundant and immunogenic molecules on the surface of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei and play critical roles in pathogenesis, as mutants lacking the polysaccharides are severely impaired in virulence [61,69-71]. Both structures are highly conserved throughout these Burkholderia species [61,69,72-78] and have been shown to elicit the production of antibodies in human cases of melioidosis and glanders [79-82].\n\nBoaA (ORF BPSS0796-BMAA0649 in the published genomic sequence of B. pseudomallei K96243 [58] and B. mallei ATCC23344 [54], respectively) is an oligomeric autotransporter adhesin characterized by our laboratory [56] and has been shown to stimulate a strong antibody response during experimental equine glanders [83]. The horse is the natural host and reservoir for B. mallei and arguably the most relevant surrogate to study glanders. Sera from horses with experimental glanders were also shown to contain high antibody titers against the predicted autotransporter proteins BPSL1631-BMA1027 and BPSS0908-BMAA1324 [83]. Interestingly, the latter also elicits a robust antibody response in human melioidosis patients [84]. The biological functions of BPSL1631-BMA1027 and BPSS0908-BMAA1324, and their contribution to virulence, have yet to be determined.\n\nTaken together, our data demonstrate that mice infected via the aerosol route with B. mallei and B. pseudomallei produce antibodies against antigens known to be major targets of the immune response in humans and horses (i.e. natural hosts) during infection. These immunological parallels underscore the usefulness and relevance of our model to study disease by these highly pathogenic organisms and develop countermeasures.\n\nThe use of the MicroSprayer\u00ae to inoculate animal species intratracheally and study pulmonary infection has been reported for several agents including Aspergillus fumigatus (rats [85]), monkeypox (non-human primates [86]), coronavirus (rats [87]), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mice [88]), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (mice [89]). This study is the first report describing the use of the device to study B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. Our results demonstrate that this aerosol delivery method produces the hallmarks of melioidosis and glanders (low infectious and lethal doses, rapid replication of agents in the lung and dissemination to spleen, bacteremia) and is consistent with other published models of aerosol infection for the organisms (intranasal, whole-body and nose-only aerosol exposure).\n\nThe use of the MicroSprayer\u00ae delivery platform offers many advantages. The device uses small volumes and accurately delivers a known number of bacteria directly into the lungs (Figures 1 and 2). The inoculation procedure is also rapid. We routinely infect 80 mice in less than 3 hours, and this time period encompasses anesthesia, inoculation and recovery from anesthesia. Furthermore, the model is safe. All manipulations are performed inside a Biosafety Cabinet, do not involve surgical procedures, and do not require extensive or expensive specialized equipment. These considerations are particularly relevant when studying highly pathogenic organisms under BSL3 containment.\n\nWhile preparing this manuscript, Revelli and colleagues published a report in which they used a similar intratracheal inoculation approach to study pulmonary melioidosis [90]. These investigators used whole body imaging and histopathology to demonstrate that mice inoculated with B. pseudomallei develop the primary focus of infection in the lungs, not the nasal passages. The key difference between their method and our delivery platform is the MicroSprayer\u00ae, which produces small aerosol particles. Revelli et al used 22s-gauge needles attached to gastight syringes and infused bacterial liquid suspensions into the trachea [90]. Both intratracheal inoculation approaches provide a route of aerosol infection that circumvents the mouse nasal passageways, reduces the potentially confounding complications due to infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system, and thus represent valuable surrogates to study pulmonary disease caused by B. pseudomallei and B. mallei."}
