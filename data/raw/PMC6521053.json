{"title": "Canine Respiratory Coronavirus, Bovine Coronavirus, and Human Coronavirus OC43: Receptors and Attachment Factors", "body": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that cluster within the family Coronaviridae (order Nidovirales). They infect a wide variety of species, including humans, livestock, and companion animals. In humans, they usually cause mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, although more severe cases occur mostly in individuals with impaired immune responses [1]. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in China in the winter of 2002, and of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in September 2012, reminds us that coronaviruses pose a significant threat, and that zoonotic transmission is common [2,3,4,5,6].\n\nThe Coronaviridae family is divided into two subfamilies, Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae, and the latter one is further divided into four genera\u2014alpha, beta, gamma, and delta\u2014based on the degree of nucleotide similarity. The current phylogeny of the family is presented in Figure 1.\n\nBetacoronaviruses are highly variable and use a number of different attachment and entry receptors. Generally, it is believed that viruses from this genus attach to the glycan layer on the cell surface, (e.g., sialic acids (SAs) or heparan sulfate (HS)) [9,10,11,12,13,14]. The second step during the infection is interaction with the entry receptor. Several molecules were proposed to serve as such, including carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM1) for murine hepatitis virus (MHV), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV. Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) was suggested to serve as entry receptor for HCoV-OC43 [15,16] and HCoV-HKU1 [17], but these discoveries were not confirmed in subsequent studies. Interestingly, SAs were also reported to serve as entry receptors, but some speculate that they play a negligible role in cell entry [15,16,17].\n\nHCoV-OC43 was first isolated in 1967. It is (next to HCoV-NL63) the most common coronavirus in humans. Incidence of infection is the highest in winter and early spring [18,19,20]. It is thought that the virus emerged in the human population at the end of the 19th century, but the most recent common ancestor has not been identified. Of interest, a number of betacoronaviruses (e.g., bovine coronavirus (BCoV), canine coronavirus (CRCoV), and dromedary camel coronaviruses) are closely related to this human pathogen; it was suggested that these species recombine and new subspecies emerge [19,21,22,23].\n\nHere, we focused on three closely related betacoronaviruses; they are almost identical from a genetic perspective but cause disease in different hosts. HCoV-OC43 causes a common cold in humans, BCoV causes gastrointestinal and respiratory tract disease in cattle [24,25,26], and CRCoV is linked to kennel cough in dogs. Surprisingly high resemblance of their spike proteins (97.3% nucleotide identity for CRCoV and BCoV and 96.9% for CRCoV and HCoV-OC43 [27]) not common among betacoronaviruses [23], as well as cross-reactivity of BCoV antigen with canine antibodies [27] and infectivity of BCoV to pups [22,28] led us to ask whether these three viruses share receptor specificity. We found that both SAs and HS serve as attachment factors for all three viruses, albeit to different extent. However, SAs are not essential for CRCoV and BCoV infection and serve as entry receptors only for clinical strain of HCoV-OC43, whereas CRCoV and BCoV employ HLA-I.\n\nHRT-18G (ATCC CRL-11663) cells, derivative of HRT-18 (ATCC CCL-244, ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland) supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), and ciprofloxacin (5 \u03bcg/mL). Cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2.\n\nTo generate human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures, primary cells isolated from patients\u2019 tissue were cultured on plastic in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Media (BEGM) medium for 1\u20132 weeks. Next, passage 2 cells were seeded on permeable Transwell insert supports (12 mm) and after the confluence was reached, apical medium was removed, and cells were grown for another 5\u20138 weeks on air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) in ALI medium. After this time, cells were fully differentiated, forming pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium.\n\nHCoV-OC43, CRCoV, and BCoV stocks were prepared by infecting HRT-18G cells. HCoV-OC43 (ATCC: VR-1558) was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) at 32 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. BCoV Mebus strain (NR-445, BEI Resources) was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL) streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) and trypsin (1 \u00b5g/mL) at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. CRCoV strain 4182 was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. Stocks were collected at 5th day post infection (p.i.) by two freeze-thaw cycles. Mock-infected cells were used as a control. Virus\u2019 yield was estimated by titration according to the Reed and Muench formula [29]. Obtained aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nHCoV-NL63 stock (isolate Amsterdam 1) was generated by infecting LLC-MK2 cells cultured in MEM with Hanks\u2019 and Earle\u2019s salts (two parts Hanks\u2019 MEM and one part Earle\u2019s MEM) supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) at 32 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. Stocks were collected at day 5 p.i. by two freeze-thaw cycles. Mock-infected cells were used as a control.\n\nInfluenza A virus Kilbourne F108: A/Aichi/2/1968 (HA, NA) x A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H3N2), Reassortant X-31 was generated by infecting MDCK cells cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (Life Technologies, Warsaw, Poland) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL) streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) and trypsin (1 \u00b5g/mL) at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. Stocks were collected at day 2 p.i. by two freeze-thaw cycles. Mock-infected cells were used as a control. HCoV-OC43 isolate 0500 was propagated on fully differentiated HAE cultures. Prior to the infection, the apical surfaces of HAE were washed thrice with PBS and inoculated with 100 \u03bcL of 1000\u00d7 diluted viral stock [30]. After 3 h incubation at 32 \u00b0C, the unbound viral particles were removed by 3 washes with 500 \u03bcL of PBS for 5 min at 32 \u00b0C. HAE cultures were further maintained at 32 \u00b0C for 2\u20135 days. The new viral stock was obtained by washing of the apical surface with PBS.\n\nVirus-containing medium was concentrated using Amicon Ultra, 10 kDa cut-off (Merck, Warsaw, Poland) and subsequently overlaid on 15% iodixanol solution in PBS (OptiPrep medium; Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) and centrifuged at 45,000\u00d7 g for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. Following centrifugation virus-containing fraction was overlaid on 10\u201320% iodixanol gradient and centrifuged at 45,000\u00d7 g for 18 h at 4 \u00b0C. Fractions collected from gradient were analyzed by Western blotting to detect the CRCoV nucleocapsid protein. The virus-enriched fractions were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nCRCoV nucleocapsid gene was codon optimized, synthetized, and cloned into pETDuet vector via BamHI and AatII sites. Plasmid identity was confirmed by sequencing. N protein was expressed in E. coli Origami cells following induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20 \u00b0C for 16 h. Protein was purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (IMAC Sepharose 6 Fast Flow).\n\nMouse polyclonal antibodies specific to CRCoV N protein were developed according to the standard protocol [31]. Six-week-old Balb/C mice purchased from The Mossakowski Medical Research Centre, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 \u00b5g of purified recombinant protein diluted in PBS and mixed 1:1 with Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland). Subsequent animal immunizations were performed weekly with 50 \u00b5g of antigen mixed with Incomplete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland). As soon as the anti-N serum titer reached 1:1,000,000 in ELISA, animals were euthanized and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Antibodies were purified from serum by affinity chromatography on Capture Select LC-kappa (mur) Affinity Matrix according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland) and then dialyzed into sterile PBS.\n\nCell lysates were mixed with sample buffer (0.5 M Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50 mg/mL dithiothreitol [DTT]) and boiled for 5 min. Afterwards, they were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis alongside PageRuler prestained protein size markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland) and electrotransferred onto activated PVDF membrane. The membranes were then blocked overnight (4 \u00b0C) with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20. An anti-CRCoV N protein antibodies (1:200, 2 h) followed by horseradish peroxidase labeled rabbit antimouse secondary antibodies (1:20,000, 1 h, Dako, Swarzewo, Poland) were used for detection of virus. The signal was developed using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Warsaw, Poland).\n\nHemagglutination assay was performed in V-shaped 96-well plates. Mouse erythrocyte suspension was prepared by three washes of twelve-week-old mouse blood with PBS. The obtained 3% mouse erythrocyte suspension was mixed with viral stocks and incubated at room temperature for 1 h until developed. As controls served influenza A H3N2 reported to hemagglutinate erythrocytes [32] and HCoV-NL63 which does not bind to SAs and therefore does not trigger such effect [33]. Pictures were acquired using CANON EOS 40D camera. All viral stocks (except for influenza A) were used at TCID50 = 500,000. Influenza A virus was applied at TCID50 = 30,000, which was the highest possible titer to be obtained.\n\nTo determine which cell surface molecules are responsible for virus\u2019 attachment, competition experiments were designed, or SAs residues were enzymatically removed from the surface of cells. Cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h, washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C with type II neuraminidase (NA, 100\u2013200 mU/mL) from Vibrio cholerae (N6514, Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland), N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac 40\u201380 mM, A0812 Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland), heparan sulfate (HS, 10\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), d-(+)-galactose (Gal, 50 mM), d-(+)-glucose (Glu, 50 mM), d-(+)-mannose (Man, 50 mM), or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAc, 50 mM) in PBS. Following incubation, cells were cooled, washed thrice with ice-cold PBS and overlaid with viral stocks. In case of Neu5Ac virus was additionally preincubated with the compound for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C before adsorption. Sugar moieties, Neu5Ac and HS but not NA were present during adsorption. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Analysis was carried out with flow cytometry or confocal microscopy.\n\nFixed cells were permeabilized using 0.5% Tween-20 (RT, 10 min, Bioshop) and unspecific binding sites were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (4 \u00b0C, overnight) prior to staining. For visualization of viruses, anticoronavirus antibody OC43 strain (1 \u00b5g/mL, 2 h, RT, Merck, Warsaw, Poland) coupled with goat antimouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (5 \u00b5g/mL, 1 h, RT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland) were used. After incubation with antibodies, cells were washed thrice with 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.1 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland). Stained coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Prolong Diamond medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland). Fluorescent images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Poznan, Poland).\n\nFor flow cytometry analysis, cells were permeabilized (0.5% Tween-20 in PBS, 20 min RT) and blocked (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 2 h RT) prior to staining. Viruses were visualized using anticoronavirus antibody OC43 strain (1 \u00b5g/mL, 2 h, RT, Merck, Warsaw, Poland) coupled with goat antimouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (5 \u00b5g/mL, 1 h, RT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland). Stained cells were scratched off the glass in PBS prior to analysis. A minimum of 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed. Cells were gated as shown in Figure S1.\n\nTo determine whether certain proteins or sugar moieties may serve as entry receptors, cell monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated with one of the following compounds: NA (200 mU/mL), HS (100\u2013600 \u00b5g/mL), Neu5Ac (5\u201380 mM), Gal (100 mM), Glu (100 mM), Man (100 mM), NAc (100 mM), polyclonal rabbit anti-HLA A/B/C antibodies (0.25\u20134 \u00b5g/mL, sc-30204, Santa Cruz) for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. After three washes (with exception to HS treated cells), cells were infected with the viruses at TCID50 of 400 per milliliter (M.O.I. = 0.0007) in the presence of tested agent or control media. NA treatment was repeated every 24 h until the day of sample collection. After 2 h, unbound virions were washed off and the cells were further cultured in the presence of compounds at conditions appropriate for each virus (see Viral stocks section for details). Antibody specificity was confirmed with isotype control antibodies used at the same concentrations.\n\nAt day 5 p.i., supernatants were collected and total RNA was isolated using Viral DNA/RNA Kit (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland). This time point was selected based on replication curves for all three viruses (Figure S2). Reverse transcription was carried out with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Serial dilutions of quantified DNA fragment corresponding to the viral N gene cloned with InsTAclone PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland) into pTZ57R/T plasmid were used as standards. Concentration of the linearized form of the plasmid was assessed using a spectrophotometer and its purity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis.\n\nSubsequently, PCR was performed with using KAPA PROBE FAST qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystem). Rox was used as a reference dye. The amplification program, specific probes and primers for each virus are listed in Table 1.\n\nTo test whether recovery of the SAs after neuraminidase-mediated desialylation affects the virus attachment, appropriate experiments were designed. Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C with 500 mU/mL NA. Subsequently cell cultures were washed with PBS and treated with 1 mM cytidine-5\u2032-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac, C8271 Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) and either \u03b1-2,3-sialyltransferase (\u03b12,3-ST) from Pasteurella multocida (S1951, Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) or \u03b1-2,6-sialyltransferase (\u03b12,6-ST) from Photobacterium damsel (S2076, Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) at varying concentrations for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Following treatment, cells were washed thrice with ice-cold PBS and infected with iodixanol concentrated CRCoV, BCoV orHCoV-OC43. After 2 h at 4 \u00b0C, unbound virions were washed off with PBS and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Activity of neuraminidase and sialyltransferases was verified with \u03b1-2,6-SAs specific fluorescein labeled Maackia Amurensis lectin I (Vector Labs) and \u03b1-2,3-SAs specific Cy3 labeled Sambucus Nigra lectin (Vector Labs)\n\nAll experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate. All graphs presented in this work were created using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Distribution of values was tested using Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test and equality of group variances was examined with Browne\u2013Forsythe test. Depending on the results of these tests, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test or unpaired t test with Welch\u2019s correction were used. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. One asterisk (*) identifies adjusted p values between 0.01 and 0.05, two asterisks (**) identify adjusted p values between 0.01 and 0.001, three asterisks (***) identify adjusted p values between 0.001 and 0.0001, four asterisks (****) identify adjusted p values below 0.0001. Images obtained from the confocal microscope were deconvolved using AutoQuant X3 software and processed in ImageJ Fiji [34]. Data obtained from FACS analysis were collected using BD Cell Quest Pro software and analyzed using FlowJo V10.\n\nThe HRT-18G cell line and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) strain 4182 were provided by Judy A. Mitchell. BCoV, Mebus, NR-445 was obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID. Influenza virus Kilbourne F108: A/Aichi/2/1968 (HA, NA) x A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H3N2), Reassortant X-31 (Derived from Mouse-adapted X-31b), NR-3483 was obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID. Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) VR-1558 and MDCK cell line (ATCC CCL-34) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). LLC-MK2 cells were kindly provided by Lia van der Hoek. HCoV-NL63 (isolate Amsterdam 1) was obtained as described [35]. The authors are grateful to Volker Thiel for providing HCoV-OC43 isolate 0500.\n\nHAE cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients of Silesian Center for Heart Diseases. Following written informed consent of all subjects to participate in this study, the procedure of acquisition was carried out according to the protocol approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no: KNW/0022/KB1/17/10 dated on 16 February 2010).\n\nAll animal procedures were in agreement with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the whole study was approved by 2nd Local IACUC in Krak\u00f3w (Institute of Pharmacology Polish Academy of Sciences). Further, all animal procedures complied with the Act on the Protection of Animals used for scientific or educational purposes dated on 15th of January 2015 (D20150266L), which implements the Directive of the European Parliament and the Council (2010/63/EU) dated on 22nd of September 2010.\n\nA number of betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-OC43 and BCoV, are thought to use SAs as entry receptors [9,10,11]. Our previous observations suggest that the role(s) of these molecules may be different from that reported in the literature; therefore, we performed a series of experiments to examine receptor usage. First, we performed a hemagglutination assay to verify whether these two viruses, and closely related CRCoV interact with these moieties. As shown in Figure 2, all three viruses agglutinated mouse erythrocytes, which are rich in SAs. Next, to determine the importance of SAs for CRCoV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43 VR-1558 attachment, we treated cells with neuraminidase (NA) (to remove SA residues) prior to infection and then examined viral attachment. Removing SAs reduced attachment of all three viruses, with the strongest effect observed for CRCoV and HCoV-OC43 VR-1558 (59.4 \u00b1 14.0% and 48.9 \u00b1 6.5 decrease, respectively; Figure 3).\n\nTo determine the role of SAs during CRCoV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43 entry, we treated cells with neuraminidase (NA) prior to infection and then examined viral replication. Removal of SAs with NA had no effect on viral replication (Figure 4).\n\nTo ensure that obtained results are valid and that reconstitution of the SAs on cell surface or incomplete scission of the SAs by NA does not affect the outcome, the infection was carried out in the presence of soluble SAs (Neu5Ac) prior to infection. The role of SAs during virus attachment and lack of effect on replication was confirmed for all three viruses (Figure 5).\n\nTo confirm that the observed effect was SA-specific, we stripped and then restored SAs to the cell surface. First, HRT-18G cells were treated with NA to remove SAs. Then, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with \u03b1-2,3-sialyltransferase (\u03b12,3-ST) or \u03b1-2,6-sialyltransferase (\u03b12,6-ST) in the presence of 1 mM of cytidine-5\u2032-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt (CMP-Neu5Ac). Compounds\u2019 activity was verified using \u03b1-2,3-SAs and \u03b1-2,6-SAs specific lectins (Figure 6).\n\nWe then examined virus attachment to control cells, to cells stripped of SA, and to cells on which the SA shield was restored. Restoration of the SAs rescued cell surface binding by all viruses (Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9). CRCoV showed a clear preference for \u03b12,3-SA moieties (Figure 7), while HCoV-OC43 bound preferentially to \u03b12,6-linked moieties (Figure 8). Similar to HCoV-OC43 VR-1558, BCoV bound preferentially to \u03b12,6-SA, but to much lower extent (Figure 9).\n\nThese results confirm that all three viruses require SAs for attachment: CRCoV shows a preference for \u03b12,3-SA, BCoV for \u03b12,6-SA, and HCoV-OC43 VR-1558 for \u03b12,6-SA as previously reported for MDCK I cell line [37].\n\nAs we discovered that SAs do not serve as entry receptors, we examined some other candidates. One protein reported to facilitate entry of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 is the HLA molecule. Therefore, we blocked the interaction between the virus and HLA-I molecules using polyclonal antibodies. This had no effect on replication of HCoV-OC43 VR-1558. However, it did block infection by CRCoV and BCoV, suggesting that HLA-I serves as an entry receptor for these viruses (Figure 10).\n\nEven though removal of SAs from the cell surface resulted in potent inhibition of viral attachment to the cell surface, the effect was not complete. Therefore, we examined the role(s) of HS and other sugar moieties (d-(+)-galactose, d-(+)-glucose, d-(+)-mannose, or N-acetyl-d-glucosamine) on virus attachment and entry. Only HS had a marked effect on CRCoV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43. Inhibition was most pronounced for BCoV (49.8 \u00b1 20.1%; 30 \u00b5g/mL HS) and HCoV-OC43 (44.4 \u00b1 16.0%; 30 \u00b5g/mL HS), and to the lesser extent for CRCoV (25.7 \u00b1 16.5%; 100 \u00b5g/mL HS) (Figure 11A). There was no significant effect on replication of any of the viruses (Figure 11B). Among the sugars tested, NAc alone showed a slight inhibitory effect on HCoV-OC43 VR-1558 attachment but had no effect on that of CRCoV or BCoV (data not shown [38]).\n\nTo test the possibility that the observed specificity of HCoV-OC43 resulted from adaptation during cell culture, we examined differences in cell attachment and entry for laboratory and clinical strains of HCoV-OC43. It is worth remembering that the laboratory strain has lost the ability to infect human airway epithelium [39], while the clinical strain does not replicate in cell lines. We performed a series of experiments in which HCoV-OC43 0500 (the clinical strain) was used to infect HAE cultures. Neither HS competition, nor specific blockade of HLA-I or sugar binding moieties affected viral replication, suggesting that these molecules do not play a role in cell entry by HCoV-OC43 0500. However, supplementation with soluble SAs resulted in dose-dependent reduction in replication, implying SAs role in entry process also for the clinical strain (Figure 12A).\n\nFurthermore we found that only SAs but not HS had effect on HCoV-OC43 0500 adhesion to HAE cultures (Figure 12B,C).\n\nTo date, studies on betacoronavirus entry show high variability in terms of receptors used for cell attachment and entry [9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17]. To make an example, SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a type I integral transmembrane protein as entry receptor [40,41], but it may also utilize c-type lectin receptor expressed by dendritic cells (DC-SIGN), a DC-SIGN-related molecule (L-SIGN), and vimentin [42,43,44,45,46,47]. On the other hand, MERS-CoV, which also infects human respiratory tract epithelium, employs dipeptidyl peptidase 4 to enter the cell [48]. Other, nonhuman betacoronaviruses exploit diverse molecules, such as CEACAM1 (MHV), neural cell adhesion molecule (porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus) [49], or SAs (HCoV-OC43) [37].\n\nHCoV-OC43 is believed to use SAs as attachment and entry receptors, but it was also reported to employ HLA-I to enter the cell [15,16]. The BCoV has been extensively studied in the context of SAs usage. Models based on chicken, mouse, and rat erythrocytes (hemagglutination) and MDCK I, CaCo-2, and LLC-PK1 cell lines (entry and replication) confirmed the role of SAs in attachment of BCoV, but no information on the role of these moieties for the cell entry has been available [9,10,11,12,37,50]. CRCoV receptors remain unknown.\n\nHere, we checked whether HCoV-OC43, CRCoV, and BCoV interact with SAs. First, the hemagglutination assay yielded positive results in all the cases; we made an effort to establish the exact role of these moieties during virus\u2013cell interaction. In all three cases, depletion of SAs from target cells as well as blockade of virus and SAs interaction using soluble neuraminic acid had a strong effect on virus binding, proving that these moieties serve as attachment receptors. Reconstitution of the SAs on cell surface after enzymatic removal revealed that CRCoV binds preferentially to \u03b1-2,3-linked SAs but not to \u03b1-2,6-linked SAs. By contrast, HCoV-OC43 VR-1558 used \u03b1-2,6-SAs rather than \u03b1-2,3-SAs, consistently with the published literature [37]. Although the preference of BCoV was similar to that of HCoV-OC43, it was less pronounced, suggesting a possible role of other molecules in the virus attachment to HRT-18G cells.\n\nApart from N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is also present on most mammalian cells surface [27,51,52,53]. Neu5Gc is a derivative of Neu5Ac as a consequence of the activity of citidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH). Due to deletion in CMAH gene, human cells are deprived of Neu5Gc [53]. Although it is commonly believed that Neu5Gc prevails in nonhuman animal cells, currently available literature shows that dog ocular mucins and erythrocytes of most western breeds are rich in Neu5Ac rather than Neu5Gc [52,54,55]. Besides it is also known that bovines express both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc in their tissues [51,53].\n\nAs \u03b1-2,6-SAs dominate in human respiratory tract [56,57], the HCoV-OC43 preference for them is not surprising. It is worth stressing that \u03b1-2,3-SAs are abundant on ciliated epithelial cells [56,57], which is in line with CRCoV role in CIRD development, as disruption of ciliary clearance is one of the early hallmarks of the disease [27]. Of interest, Bakkers et al. [58] recently reported loss of hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) mediated SAs binding for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 during adaptation to human tissue, which suggests that the observed attachment is mediated by the spike protein.\n\nThe role of SAs in adhesion of these three betacoronaviruses is unquestionable, but we made an effort to check whether other moieties may also serve as attachment receptors for the viruses, as blockade of virus\u2013SAs interaction in some cases inhibited virus attachment pronouncedly, but incompletely. Of the tested ones, soluble HS hampered attachment of all three betacoronaviruses but did not severely affect their replication. The most pronounced effect was noted for HCoV-OC43 and the weakest for CRCoV. Affinity for HS has been previously described to emerge during adaptation to cell culture [59,60]; therefore, one may assume that the observed effect would not be valid for a wild-type virus. As we had a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis on HCoV-OC43 0500 virus (which does not replicate in vitro), we used fully differentiated HAE cultures and a standard cell line to show that attachment of the clinical strain does not depend markedly on HS, and that the ability to bind to HS most likely is related to the cell culture adaptation [61]. HRT-18G cells constitute the only existing model for the CRCoV infection in vitro and we decided to study CRCoV and BCoV in vitro on these cells [62]. Consequently, one cannot rule out the possibility that attachment receptor specificity may also be altered due to the cell culture adaptation. While SAs appeared to be important for virus binding to the cell surface, they are not essential for entry of HCoV-OC43 VR-1558, CRCoV, and BCoV. Importantly, the clinical strain of HCoV-OC43 0500 appear to employ this molecule as an adhesion and entry receptor, as soluble SAs block the attachment and entry of the virus to the human airway epithelium. Depletion of SAs with neuraminidase only mildly affected virus attachment and entry, but we believe that this is due to incomplete removal of SAs, the ability of cells to reconstitute SAs on the surface and the experimental settings.\n\nBecause the results showed that SAs do not serve as entry receptors for HCoV-OC43 VR-1558, CRCoV, or BCoV, we aimed to identify the molecules that facilitate cell entry by these viruses. Studies conducted in the mid-1990s showed that HLA served as an HCoV-OC43 entry receptor on RD and HCN-lA cells [15,16,63]; more recent studies show that it also acts as an entry receptor for HCoV-HKU1 [17]. These findings, however, have not been confirmed by other research groups until now [64]. Here, we examined the role of HLA-I as a receptor for all three betacoronaviruses and found out that it does not play a role in cell entry by the laboratory and clinical strains of HCoV-OC43. However, replication of BCoV and CRCoV was hampered in the presence of HLA-specific antibodies, showing that these viruses employ HLA-I as entry receptors. HLA class I molecules structurally consist of three \u03b1 chains linked with a \u03b22-microglobulin molecule. The membrane proximal end is formed by the \u03b13 and \u03b22M domains, which adopt a standard immunoglobulin-like fold [65]. Consequently, they belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Interestingly, this superfamily also includes CAECAM1, which serves as a receptor for MHV [16,17]. It will not be too farfetched a presumption to assume that cousins of MHV\u2014CRCoV and BCoV\u2014use structurally similar molecules as their entry receptors.\n\nDespite similarities between betacoronaviruses on the level of protein sequence and the range of surface molecules recognized by them, the prevailing opinion is that they form separate genera characterized by very narrow host ranges [59]. However, a recent report regarding HCoV-OC43 outbreak among wild chimpanzees suggests that betacoronaviruses may undergo recurrent interspecies transmissions [66]. Considering previous reports, one may conclude that these three betacoronaviruses frequently cross species boundaries, leading to recombination and emergence of intermediate forms [27,67,68,69]. As all three viruses can replicate in human cells, this scenario is realistic; however, epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis. One may also speculate that separation of BCoV and OC43 has not really occurred, and that some lineages belonging to a single species are able to infect a number of different hosts. On the other hand, it is also possible that HLA-I specificity is related to the cell culture adaptation.\n\nTo summarize, we show here that three closely related betacoronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 VR-1558, BCoV, and CRCoV) utilize SAs and HS to attach to the cell surface of target cells. However, they show different preferences for these moieties, and the importance of these interactions is debatable. HLA-I molecules serve as entry receptors for CRCoV and BCoV, but not for HCoV-OC43 0500 for which SAs carry both roles."}
