{"title": "Oxadiazole-Based Cell Permeable Macrocyclic Transition State Inhibitors of Norovirus 3CL Protease Graphical abstract HHS Public Access", "body": "Human noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus in the family Caliciviridae. 1 They are the primary cause of sporadic and epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. [2] [3] [4] [5] Norovirus infection is associated with high morbidity among the elderly and young, as well as immunocompromised patients. 6 The mortality rate among children in developing countries is estimated to exceed 200 000 annually. 7 Of the six norovirus genogroups (GI-VI), GI and GII are associated with human infections, with the GII.4 cluster accounting for 70-80% of norovirus outbreaks worldwide. 8 Devising prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions for norovirus infection presents a challenge due to the high transmissibility, genetic diversity, environmental stability, and prolonged virus shedding displayed by noroviruses. 9,10 Furthermore, human noroviruses do not robustly grow in cell culture and only low levels of human norovirus are reported to grow in human B cells. 11 Lastly, there is currently no optimal animal model of the disease; consequently, many aspects of norovirus biology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. 12 The norovirus RNA genome (7.4-7.7 kb) is a positive-sense single stranded genome comprising three open reading frames (ORF1-3) of which ORF1 encodes a 200 kDa polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved to generate at least six nonstructural proteins: p48, RNA helicase/NTPase, p22, VPg, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). 1, 13 ORF2 and ORF3 encode the norovirus capsid (VP2) and a small basic protein (VP1), respectively. Processing of the polyprotein is effected by the norovirus 3CLpro, a cysteine protease having a chymotrypsin-like fold, an extended binding cleft, and a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad. [14] [15] [16] The preferred substrate recognition sequence for 3CLpro is -F/Y-X-L-Q-G/A-corresponding to -P 4 -P 3 -P 2 -P 1 -P 1 \u2032 -, 17 where the P 1 Gln residue determines the primary substrate specificity of the enzyme and X is H, Q, or E. [18] [19] [20] The S 3 subsite displays a degree of plasticity and, therefore, can accommodate a P 3 Gln, His, or Glu. Because processing of the polyprotein by 3CLpro is essential for viral replication, inhibition of 3CLpro is envisaged to be a fruitful avenue of investigation for the discovery of norovirus-specific antivirals, an approach that has been successfully used in the discovery of therapeutics for other viral diseases. 21, 22 We have recently described an array of inhibitors of 3CLpro, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] including the demonstration of in vivo efficacy by a dipeptidyl inhibitor using a murine norovirus model. 28 We report herein the results of structural, biochemical, and antiviral studies of a novel series of oxadiazole-based cell permeable macrocyclic inhibitors (I) (Figure 1 ) of norovirus 3CLpro.\n\nThere are several disadvantages associated with peptide-derived drugs, including high conformational flexibility, susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, poor membrane permeability, and low oral bioavail-ability. 29, 30 These shortcomings are frequently mitigated through depeptitization. An effective way of depeptitizing a linear peptide is through macrocyclization. [31] [32] [33] [34] The preorganization and structural rigidity that characterize macrocyclic inhibitors frequently enhance pharmacological activity by reducing the entropic penalty associated with binding and, furthermore, increase proteolytic stability. 34 The effect of macrocyclization on cellular permeability and oral bioavailability is less predictable; however, these parameters are expected to be augmented when a macrocycle can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 35, 36 On the basis of these considerations, we hypothesized that tethering of the P 1 Gln residue, the preferred primary substrate specificity residue of norovirus 3CLpro, with the P 3 residue side chain in an appropriate linear peptide using a 1,3,4-oxadiazole linker would yield a macrocyclic scaffold (I) (Figure 1 ) potentially capable of participating in intramolecular hydrogen bonding via the ring oxygen or nitrogen atoms, depending on the orientation assumed by the heterocyclic ring. Additional design considerations included ensuring that the ring size of the macrocycle would be optimal in terms of allowing the macrocycle to assume a \u03b2-strand conformation, a structural motif recognized by proteases. 37, 38 This is of paramount importance, since a \u03b2-strand conformation would allow proper docking/positioning of the inhibitor to the active site which, in turn, would orient correctly the side chains of the P 1 and P 2 residues, thereby maximizing hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic binding interactions. Lastly, the length of the linker and the position of the heterocyclic ring were also anticipated to influence permeability and potency by impacting the conformation of the macrocycle (vide infra).\n\nA convergent approach was used in the synthesis of inhibitors 15-22 (Table 1) . Thus, fragments 4a-f and 6 were first assembled as illustrated in Scheme 1. Fragments 4a-f were synthesized by coupling an appropriate Z-protected carboxylic acid with tert-butyl carbazate using EDCI to yield the Boc-protected hydrazides 1a-e. The Boc protective group was removed via treatment with dry HCl/dioxane, and the resulting hydrazine was coupled to (L)-Boc-glutamic acid \u03b1-methyl ester using EDCI/HOBt/DIEA/DMF to yield hydrazides 2a-f. Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride/DIEA in dry CH 3 CN yielded 1,3,4-removal of the Boc-group to yield 5, which was then coupled to (L)-Boc-Leu using EDCI/ HOBt/DIEA/DMF to form fragment 6. Coupling of fragments 4a-f and 6 generated leucinesubstituted intermediates 7a-c and 7e (Scheme 2). The corresponding cyclohexylalaninesubstituted compounds 7d and 7f-h were prepared by coupling compounds 4a-f to (L)cyclohexylalanine methyl ester to give esters 13a-d which were hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acids 14a-d (Scheme 3). Coupling of the acids with (L)-Glu(OBzl) methyl ester yielded compounds 7d and 7f-h. Treatment of compounds 7a-h with H 2 /Pd-C furnished acyclic precursors 8a-h. Subsequent macrolactamization 40 yielded compounds 9a-h which, upon reduction with lithium borohydride, generated the corresponding alcohols 10a-h. Oxidation to aldehydes 15-22 was accomplished using Dess-Martin periodinane, and the synthesized compounds are listed in Table 1 .\n\nThe inhibitory activity of compounds 15-22 toward NV 3CLpro, as well as their antinorovirus activity in the NV replicon harboring cells established in Huh-7 cells, was determined as previously described, 26, 28, 41 and the results are tabulated in Table 1 . A graphical dose-dependent inhibition of NV RNA replication by compound 21 is shown in Figure 2 . The screening results shown in Table 1 indicate that (a) in a comparison of compounds 15, 16, and 22 versus compounds 17-21, it is clearly evident that ring size has a profound impact on inhibitory activity and cellular permeability in this series of compounds; (b) with the exception of compound 22, the rest of the inhibitors were relatively wellpermeable to cells and several inhibitors displayed single digit 50% inhibitory concentration (EC 50 ) values in cell based assays (both NV and murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1)); and (c) in contrast to acyclic dipeptidyl transition state inhibitors where the substitution of a P2 Leu residue by a P2 Cha residue results in significant improvement in both IC 50 and EC 50 values, 28 the presence of Cha at P2 did not markedly change potency (compounds 17 and 18; compounds 19 and 20), suggesting that a fruitful strategy for further optimization of potency may necessitate structural modifications in the \"cap\". In addition, the EC 50 values against NV and MNV-1 in cell culture were well correlated (Table 1) , suggesting the potency (and permeability) of each compound was consistent against multiple noroviruses.\n\nIn order to establish the precise mechanism of action of inhibitor (I), illuminate the conformation of (I) and the orientation of the linker, as well as obtain structural information that can be used to guide the optimization of pharmacological activity, high resolution X-ray crystal structures of inhibitors 21 and 22 with NV 3CLpro were determined. Examination of the active site revealed the presence of prominent electron density in subunit A consistent with inhibitors 21 and 22 covalently bound to Cys 139 and the cyclohexyl alanine side chain nestled into the hydrophobic S 2 subsite 17 ( Figure 3 ). However, for inhibitor 21, the majority of the macrocycle was disordered and could not be modeled. This disorder was consistently observed from approximately 10 X-ray diffraction data sets obtained for this complex. A surface representation of NV 3CLpro, colored by residue type, with inhibitor 22 is shown in Figure 4 .\n\nThe hydrogen-bonding interactions between NV 3CLpro and inhibitors 21 and 22 are shown in Figure 5 and include multiple hydrogen bonds between Ala160, Gln 110, and Ala158 and the inhibitor backbone which serve to correctly position the inhibitor in the active site cleft. Critical hydrogen bonds involving the P1 Gln side chain and the His157 and Thr134 residues are also clearly evident for inhibitor 22. However, hydrogen bonding to Thr134 was not observed for the complex with inhibitor 21 due to disorder of the residues between Leu132 and Gly137. These binding interactions, as well as the flexible backbone of the T123-G133 loop, are postulated to play a critical role in enzyme recognition. 42 The lack of cellular permeability of inhibitor 22 is supported by the absence of any intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the oxadiazole ring; however, permeability involves the interplay of many factors besides intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Notably, interactions between inhibitor 21 and Thr134 were not observed, since the loop of NV 3CLpro spanning Gly133-Pro136 was consistently disordered. Thus, it seems that the macrocycle ring size may play a role in forming optimal hydrogen bond interactions with NV 3CLpro. Surprisingly, decreasing the macrocycle ring from 21 atoms (inhibitor 22) to 20 atoms (inhibitor 21) results in more disorder of the inhibitor and nearby residues of NV 3CLpro. In order to gain insight and understanding into the structural determinants that impact potency and cellular permeability, herculean efforts were expended in obtaining high resolution X-ray crystal structures of permeable inhibitors 18-20, albeit without success. Although crystals were obtained for NV 3CLpro cocrystallized with inhibitors 18-20, these samples only yielded weak X-ray diffraction properties even after optimization of the crystallization conditions. Finally, the crystallographic data indicate that the oxadiazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors weaken all H-bonding prospects for this pharmacophore element.\n\nIn an effort to correlate the crystal structures with the data provided in Table 1 , the structures of NV 3CLpro were superimposed using secondary structure matching with GESAMT. 43 Not surprising, the overall structures of the NV 3CLpro were very similar to an rmsd of 0.54 \u00c5 between C\u03b1 atoms (158 residues). In order to conduct a more direct analysis of the inhibitors, the disordered portion of the macrocycle for inhibitor 21 was modeled in an idealized position and compared with inhibitor 22 ( Figure 6 ). Notably, the shorter ring size of inhibitor 21 appears to move the inhibitor slightly away from the loop containing Thr134 which precludes formation of a hydrogen bond and disorder of residues Gly133-Pro136 in the nearby loop. However, inhibitor 22 is able to stabilize this loop region by formation of a hydrogen bond with Thr134 due to the larger ring size. This perhaps explains the observed difference in the IC 50 values (Table 1 ), as inhibitor 22 is able to form an extra hydrogen bond relative to the other inhibitors. Further shortening of the macrocycle ring size (inhibitors 15-20) would likely move the inhibitor further away from Thr134 and prevent formation of hydrogen bonds with the loop and result in disorder of these residues. This may also explain why the crystals obtained with inhibitors 18-20 produced poor diffraction, as the dynamic conformations of the nearby loop could potentially prevent formation of wellordered crystals. Conversely, the shorter macrocycle ring size appears to be more conducive to permeability, although binding to the NV 3CLpro target is slightly weakened.\n\nThere is currently a dire need for the development of norovirus-specific therapeutics and prophylactics for the management of norovirus infections. The studies described herein disclose the structure-based design of the first series of oxadiazole-based permeable macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CL protease. Insights gained from these studies have laid a solid foundation for conducting further preclinical studies focused on the optimization of potency and pharmacokinetics.\n\nReagents and dry solvents were purchased from various chemical suppliers (Aldrich, Acros Organics, Chem-Impex, TCI America, Oakwood Chemicals, Bachem, and Fisher) and were used as obtained.
