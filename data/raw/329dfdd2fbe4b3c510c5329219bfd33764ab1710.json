{"title": "Domestication reprogrammed the budding yeast life cycle", "body": "Humans have domesticated plant and animal species over at least 12000 years to improve agricultural traits. Domestication greatly contributed to human population expansion and development by releasing labour from food production, but also profoundly altered the domesticated species. Controlled breeding and artificial selection on the segregating genetic diversity created plant and animal crops that now differ drastically from those of their ancestors and wild relatives 1 . Selected traits recur across domesticated species 2 and, due to pleiotropy and linkage, often come with specific, non-desired side-effects. Human-created niches may also impose quasi-domestication and unintentionally favour some traits and genetic variants with side-effects linked to them 3 . Both domestication and quasidomestication therefore results in suites of co-evolving traits, known as domestication syndromes 4, 5 .\n\nDomestication of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dates back over 9000 years, with the earliest use in rice, honey and fruit fermentation 6 . Subsequent domestication for industrial or semi-industrial beer, dairy, rice, cocoa, coffee 7 , bread, palm sap and agave fermentation 8 transformed wild yeast lineages into specialized domesticated breeds [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Lab domestication and the subsequent use of budding yeast as a model organism resulted from efforts to breed pure, industrial beer strains 16 . Modern lab strains are genetic mosaics with genomes composed of DNA from diverse domesticated origins 17 . The continued existence of wild yeast not spoiled by extensive gene flow from feral domesticated yeast became accepted only recently 18, 19 . Wild strains are more diverse in terms of single nucleotide variation; domesticated lineages are instead distinguished by genome content variation in form of aneuploidies, polyploidies and the copy number of individual genes and chromosome segments [20] [21] [22] [23] . These structural and copy number variants in domesticated lineages may explain the high phenotypic variation among domesticated lineages and the unexpectedly large intraspecies phenotypic diversity in the species 9, 20, 21, 24 .\n\nWhile the impact of domestication on the yeast genome is well described, its effect on the yeast biology is poorly understood. The life cycle of an organism represents the very core of its organismal properties, directly defining its fitness. Life cycle changes are therefore dramatic evolutionary events with far-reaching consequences. Budding yeast reproduces asexually under nutrient abundance, expanding its population size. Growing cells first privatize and use the most easily catabolized carbon and nitrogen by repressing mitochondrial respiration and the uptake and use of non-preferred sources 25 . When the preferred sources are consumed, the repression is relaxed and yeast switches to nonpreferred sources, including by respiring the produced ethanol. When an essential nutrient becomes scarce, cell growth and the asexual population expansion ceases. Diploid cells then either pass through meiosis and enter a haploid spore state 26 , shift from unicellular to multicellular filamentous organization 27 or enter into a quiescent G0 stage 28 . These transitions favour survival by repressing metabolism, reproduction and translation, mobilizing nutrients intracellularly by autophagocytosis, and protecting against external challenges [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .\n\nWhen the nutrient status switches back to favourable, cells re-activate translation, rebuild growth-required cell functions, revert to single, vegetative cell status and re-initiate the asexual cell cycle 34 .\n\nWe tracked asexual reproduction, entry into spore state and survival as quiescent cells across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced S. cerevisiae strains 20 and 3 found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. We found that domestication shifted yeast from respiratory to fermentative asexual reproduction and decreased resistance to stresses other than those associated with domestication environments. Concomitantly, domestication abolished or severely impaired the sexual life cycle and the capacity to enter into the protective haploid spore state. We traced genetic change driving this extraordinary yeast domestication syndrome to lineage-specific combinations of aneuploidies and loss-of-function mutations.\n\nWe first revisited published growth yields for 971 wild and domesticated budding yeast strains that reproduced asexually in 36 stress environments 20 We next measured doubling times and yields of these yeasts while using common carbon and nitrogen sources 19, 37 (Fig. 1, Supplementary data S1) . Domesticated yeasts were better adapted to maltose, sucrose and higher concentrations of glucose (>0.5%), fructose (>0.5%) and xylose (>2%); all carbon sources that characterize human-made fermenting niches 38 . Domesticated yeasts also better used isoleucine and valine, as well as threonine, which can be catabolized into isoleucine. Isoleucine and valine are degraded in the fermentation induced 39 Ehrlich pathway by Bat1 and Bat2, while threonine is also anaerobically catabolized to propionate during fermentation. Wild yeasts were better adapted to most respiratory carbon sources (ethanol, glycerol) as well as to lower concentrations (up to 1%) of sugars; lower sugar concentrations promote respiration by relieving the glucose repression of respiratory genes 40 . Wild yeasts were also better at using citrulline, serine and alanine. The metabolism of these compounds produces fumarate or pyruvate (and through the latter: oxaloacetate), which are Krebs cycle intermediates intrinsically linked to respiration. In addition, since the replenishment of a cyclic pathway can be achieved by any anaplerotic reactions, the net result of the production of any of the Krebs cycle intermediates would entail a larger availability of precursors for other paths (such as the gluconeogenesis or the mitochondrial production of ATP) 41 . Wild yeasts also better catabolized glycine and phenylalanine.\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The vast majority (96%, n=815) of these was private to either doubling time (d) or yield (y), consistent with the very low correlation (r 2 mean=0.16) of these fitness components across strains. We therefore conclude that the efficiency and rate of nutrient use likely evolved independently in budding yeast, and are independently regulated.\n\nWe recovered known causes of domestication effects, e.g. SUC2 gain (sucrose use, d),\n\nMAL gene amplification (maltose use, d), DAL5 gain (citrulline use, d). We also disclosed many unknown effects, many of which were highly pleiotropic. Thus, yields in sugarrestricted niches often associated to the mitochondrial DNA polymerase MIP1 or the cytochrome C peroxidase CCP1, whereas the corresponding doubling times often associated to either SEC11 or COG2 dependent intracellular transport. We conclude that variation in yeast use of carbon and nitrogen are in line with domestication selecting for fermentative over respiratory growth.\n\nYeast sporulation is known to be most efficiently induced by nitrogen starvation combined with respiratory growth 42,43 . We found wild yeasts (n=54) to sporulate rapidly in these conditions, while domesticated yeasts (n=503) were much slower (Fig. 2a) . In particular, the domesticated French Dairy, African beer and Sake clades sporulated very poorly, while the Wine/European S. boulardii subclade completely failed to sporulate (Supplementary fig. 2a and b). Yeast in clades of unassigned type (n=293) sporulated as domesticated yeasts.\n\nAmong unassigned yeasts, French Guiana strains that colonize human bodies were virtually unable to sporulate (Supplementary fig. 2a ). We also determined how long the produced spores survives, by monitoring the spore lifespan of a wild (North American -AKN) and a well-sporulating domesticated (Wine/European -BTN) yeast. We found spore survival to remain amazingly high (>90%) without any detectable gamete mortality during the entire 8 weeks test period (Fig. 2b) .\n\nWe next investigated the ability of wild yeasts to sporulate under the most extreme starvation, i.e. in water. We developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay based on cell size and granularity (see methods and Fig. 2c ) to detect single (monad) and double (dyad) spores, as the former are not easily distinguished from unsporulated cells by microscopy.\n\nWe found 88% of wild yeast to sporulate in complete absence of nutrients. Only 0.6% of the domesticated isolates did so, and when sporulating they produced fewer asci (Fig. 2d) .\n\nNeither wild nor domesticated yeasts capable of sporulating produced complete tetrads in water, forming only monads and dyads. This is consistent with spore numbers being controlled by carbon source availability 44 . To validate that domestication indeed abolished or impaired sporulation, we tracked sporulation in water across the never domesticated sister-species S. paradoxus (n=12 strains from 4 clades) and found it to be similar to that of wild S. cerevisiae (n=23) and much superior to that of domesticated S. cerevisiae (n=49) (Supplementary fig. 2c ).\n\nThe capacity of wild yeast strains to sporulate and survive as spores in complete absence of external nutrients is important, as extreme starvation undoubtedly is a common challenge in natural habitats. We conclude that natural selection has maintained a remarkable capacity of wild yeasts to enter and survive in a haploid spore state, while domestication abolished or impaired this core organismal property. Because the domesticated clades have exchanged little or no genetic material, this abolishment of sporulation must have occurred independently multiple times during the yeast history.\n\nBecause sporulation variation was overwhelmingly due to additive genetic effects (Fig. 3a, narrow sense heritability, h 2 =0.89 and 0.88, respectively at 24 and 72 h), we next probed the underlying genetic architecture and first focused on macroscopic genomic changes.\n\nGenome homozygosity has been reported to promote meiosis and sporulation 45 , but disregarding the wild yeasts, which are all completely homozygous, we found no correlation to sporulation (Fig. 3b) . In fact, some populations (Sake, French Guiana, Wine/European S. boulardii subclade) had lost their sporulation capacity, despite high homozygosity. Because domesticated strains often carried ploidy variations, we next probed whether poly-or aneuploidy impaired sporulation. Tetraploid and triploid yeasts sporulated as often as diploid, and produced only marginally fewer asci at later time point (Fig. 3c) . In contrast, aneuploidy accounted for some of the early and late sporulation variation (Fig. 3c) . Multiple aneuploidies were worse than a single aneuploidy (Fig. 3c) , and chromosome gain were as bad as chromosome loss. We propose that the presence of extensive chromosomal aneuploidies explains the poor sporulation of the domesticated Ale and African beer clades, as sporulation genes in these strains appeared to be free of loss-of-function nucleotide variants (see below).\n\nWe next probed species-wide sporulation effects from common (MAF>5%) SNPs, indels and gains and losses of genes by GWAS and identified 384 sporulation variation markers (Fig.   3d ). These were enriched (\u03c72, p=3.9e-05) in known sporulation genes (11%). The master regulator of meiosis, IME1, emerged as the primary sporulation determinant, with six previously unknown variants 46 associating to this trait (Supplementary fig. 3a ). Two promoter (A-325C, C-181T) and three coding (N311Y, E316V and E316G) new variants all associated with impaired sporulation (Supplementary fig. 3b ), and predominantly occurred in domesticated lineages. A common (27%), derived H78R variant associated with enhanced sporulation in some domesticated yeasts (Supplementary fig. 3c ).\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Meiotic genes often carried loss-of-function variants in domesticated lineages, but rarely in wild yeasts (Fig. 3e) \n\nAn alternative life cycle strategy for yeasts encountering nutrient scarcity is to enter a quiescent G0 state 28 , which is also a complex trait that vary across genetic backgrounds 51 .\n\nWe therefore probed whether domesticated isolates compensated for sporulation loss by evolving a superior quiescence life span. Encountering extreme starvation (water), wild yeasts all pursued the sporulation strategy, whereas domesticated and unclassified isolates (n=734) near uniformly entered quiescence. Quiescence survival (chronological life span; CLS) varied massively (0.5% to 96.8% survival after 20 days), but were on average much shorter than survival in the spore state. It is thus clearly an inferior survival strategy during nutrient scarcity. French Guiana and African Cocoa yeasts survived remarkably long in quiescence, while French dairy and African beer strains died rapidly. Aneu-and polyploidy .

A single aneuploidy was as bad as multiple and chromosome gains were as bad as losses. Euploid polyploids died faster than diploids (36% vs. 62% median survival after 20 days; Fig. 4a ).\n\nWe next compared the quiescence survival of wild and domesticated yeasts (n=572, all euploid diploid), in carbon exhausted synthetic media in which not even wild yeast sporulates. We allowed cells to reach quiescence by exhausting sugars either using rich synthetic complete medium (SDC) or a calorie restricted such medium. After 7, 21, and 35 days we found nearly equal quiescence survival for wild and domesticated yeasts, with a small but significant advantage for domesticated yeasts in the richest environment (SDC, at days 21 and 35) that best resemble domestication niches (Fig. 4 panel B) . Rather than by domestication, survival variation under quiescence was explained by population stratification and therefore either by drift or local adaptation. Thus, wild Taiwanese and domesticated French Dairy yeasts died rapidly (<30% survivors after 7 days), while French Guiana, Mexican agave and West African Cocoa yeasts were the longest living (>60% survivors after 21 days) (Supplementary fig. 4 ). French Dairy carried loss-of-function mutations in SIC1, which is required for entry into quiescence 53 Given the high trait heritability (Fig. 4c , h 2 = from 0.77 to 0.90), we next probed alleles controlling survival under quiescence by GWAS. We identified 292 variants which were mostly (n=177) time and environment specific. Loss function mutations in the cell cycle regulator WHI2 was associated to shortened quiescence lifespan in all environments.\n\nFurthermore, 14 common (MAF>16%) variants in the minor succinate dehydrogenase (SDH1b), assisting mitochondrial electron transfer, were associated to shortened quiescence life span under all but extreme starvation. The succinate dehydrogenase complex probably controls yeast viability through its involvement in the TCA cycle and in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which must be operational to promote survival upon nutrient exhaustion [56] [57] [58] .\n\nCalorie restriction extended the quiescence lifespan for all clades, except for in the extremely long lived West African Cocoa yeasts (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939314 doi: bioRxiv preprint finding suggest that such mode of regulation may be common through yeast populations given that intragenic repeat numbers evolve rapidly 60,61 .\n\nDomestication impairing yeast sporulation represents a truly seismic change to the biology of the organism. Firstly, loss of capacity to enter the yeast spore state, which offers long term survival when nutrients are scarce 30, 31 , leaves domesticated cells instead dependent on entering the G0 quiescence stage. Entry into quiescence also slows ageing and intrinsic death 62 , but much less so than sporulation (Fig. 2d) . Moreover, domesticated yeasts only marginally compensated for the sporulation loss by evolving extended quiescence life spans (Fig. 4b) . Domestication therefore caused a massive net drop in capacity to survive nutrient scarcity. This is likely to be detrimental in wild microhabitats, where nutrient scarcity is the rule rather than the exception for yeasts that lack motility and are unable to relocate when local nutrients are consumed. Secondly, sporulation entails transitioning from a higher to a lower ploidy state. Domesticated yeasts will have no or a much reduced capacity to achieve this shift. Because a lower ploidy state confer faster asexual reproduction in many environments 63 , this is likely to translate into a fitness cost. Third, loss of sporulation means loss of the capacity to form gametes and meiotic recombination. Recombination also occurs under yeast mitosis but at vastly lower rates 64, 65 . Thus, domestication near abolished or impaired the yeast capacity to combine beneficial variants into one genotype, to cleanse otherwise healthy genomes from deleterious mutations 66, 67 , to prevent their catastrophic accumulation through a ratchet mechanism 68 and to generate a sufficiently broad diversity of genotypes to fully exploit and adapt to multi-faceted wild niches 69 . Sexual recombination accelerates yeast adaptation 70 and the loss of sexual recombination is likely to be particularly costly in constantly changing wild niches where fast adaptation is key. Rare subclades of domesticated clades, in particular of the Wine/European lineage, are known to sometimes escape from their domestication niches and to survive as feral isolates in the wild. This is likely thanks to these strains retaining, or having re-acquired, a life cycle closer to that of wild yeast. Indeed, sporulation of feral subclades in the Wine/European clade is notably more efficient than that of other sub-clades (Supplementary fig. 2b ). Whereas purifying selection retains a functional sporulation machinery in all wild isolates, there is little doubt that non-feral domesticated strains with their impaired sporulation capacity, are strongly selected against in the wild.\n\nBecause the yeast domestication syndrome is shared across genetically distinct, independently domesticated clades, it is unlikely to reflect the retention of ancestral trait that have been lost in wild lineages 71 . Instead, it likely represents convergent evolution where the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939314 doi: bioRxiv preprint convergence was driven by domestication. Such a convergence could have both adaptive and neutral explanations. First, the domestication syndrome re-oriented both carbon and nitrogen metabolism from better respiratory to better fermentative growth. This can easily be rationalized as adaptation. Domestication niches, such as grape must with a 20% glucose/fructose content, are often rich in easily fermented sugars. Ethanol production, which is the principle trait selected for in most domestication environments, depends on efficient fermentation of these sugars. Respiration of the sugar, or of the produced ethanol, is both counterproductive to high ethanol content and discouraged by high sugar and, later, low oxygen. The better beer yeast fermentation of malt sugars to ethanol 23 , is widely held to reflect domestication driven adaptation. In contrast, concentrated sugar is relative rare in wild niches and competition for it is fierce, with concentrations unlikely to often exceed the 0.5% threshold at which sugar fermentation kicks in. In contrast to in large industrial tanks where the oxygen is rapidly depleted, oxygen is also often freely available in natural yeast niches, allowing respiration. Second, we found sporulation genes to associate to clade specific loss-of-function variants in genes private to sporulation and meiosis. This is consistent with a neutral drift model, where asexual proliferation in domestication niches relaxes selection on superfluous sporulation and meiosis genes, leaving them free to accumulate mutations. Many of these variants affected the key meiosis specific transcription factors IME1 and NDT80 that are absolutely required for sporulation 72 , underscoring that there is little selective pressure to retain sporulation intact in domesticated isolates.\n\nSporulation requires respiration 73, 74 . Relaxed selection on sporulation may therefore indirectly lower the selection also for respiration, and this could partially account for the worse respiratory growth in domesticated lineages. Niche specific loss of superfluous genes, leading to pseudogenization and ultimately genome reduction, has been suggested to be the predominant driver of natural yeast evolution 21, 75, 76 . Domestication may simply be seen as directing and accelerating this pseudogenization process. A notable direct side-effect of relaxed selection on the sexual life cycle is that correct pairing and segregation of chromosomes during meiosis becomes irrelevant. This reduces selection against chromosomal rearrangements, aneuploidies and odd polyploidies that disturb these processes, allowing their accumulation in domesticated strains 20, 77 . This creates a knock-on effect, as their accumulation in domesticated strains reinforces the loss of the sexual cycle.\n\nBesides domestication, two events stand out in S. cerevisiae evolution since the S. paradoxus split. First, the out-of-China dispersal separated East Asian wild isolates from other yeast clades, driving the earliest and most profound genetic differentiations 20, 78, 79 .\n\nSecond, hybridization of some S. cerevisiae strains to wild S. paradoxus, followed by repeated backcrossing to the S. cerevisiae parental lineage, later created S. cerevisiae genomes, such as the Alpechin clade, with massive (up to 5%) amounts of introgressed S. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939314 doi: bioRxiv preprint paradoxus DNA 20 . Both events affect asexual growth. However, we found neither to have altered the yeast life cycle, the core organism-level property of the species. Domestication therefore stands out as the most dramatic event in yeast evolution, being unique in having reprogrammed a central aspect of its organismal biology. Fundamental consequences of domestication on life cycles are not unique to yeast: domestication made banana (Musa sp.) seedless and parthenocarpic 80 and abolished seed and flower production in garlic (Allium sativum) 81 . In contrast to these species, however, yeast is not only industrially important but serves as one of our most widely used model species. Because our understanding of yeast biology is near entirely based on studies of domesticated, or predominantly domesticated, Isolates were pre-cultivated in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD; 2% dextrose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% agar) before being diluted 1:50 into 10 mL of pre-sporulation media (YPA; 2% potassium acetate, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) and grown 48 hours at 30\u00b0C \n\nThe VCF file available for the sequenced strains 20 was converted and filtered using plink \n\nAll measured phenotypes, sporulation GWAS hits, chronological life span GWAS hits, yield GWAS hits, doubling time GWAS hits.\n\nVariant matrix for GWAS generated by Plink in .bed, .bim and .fam formats.
