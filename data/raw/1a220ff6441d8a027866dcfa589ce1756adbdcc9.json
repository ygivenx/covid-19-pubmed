{"title": "THREE-GENERATION TOXICITY STUDY OF RATS INGESTING BROWN HT IN THE DIET", "body": "The water-soluble azo dye Brown HT (CI (1971) No. 20285) is principally composed of the disodium salt of 4,4'-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-1,3-phenylenebisazo)di(naphthalene-l-sulphonic acid). It is used for colouring a variety of food and drink products.\n\nIt is permitted for use in the UK under the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations 1973 (Statutory Instrument 1973 , no. 1340 , and under the Treaty of Accession to the EEC, the UK may continue to authorize its use under national legislation, pending a review of its toxicological status by the EEC authorities (1978) .\n\nAcute toxicity studies in rats and mice showed that the oral LDs0 exceeded 2g/kg in both species, whereas the intraperitoneal LDs0 values for these species were estimated to be in the range 220-375 mg/kg (Hall et al. 1966) .\n\nTwo short-term feeding studies in the rat (Chambers et al. 1966; Hall et al. 1966) established no-effect levels of 0.5 and 0.6\u00b0/'0 of the diet (approximately 250-350mg Brown HT/kg/day), respectively. At higher dose levels (up to 2.0% of the diet), mild anaemia and slightly reduced body-weight gains were findings that may have been associated with treatment in both studies. Brown coloration of the Kupffer cells of the liver, the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney and the lymph nodes was also observed at dose levels above 0.5%. Hall et al. (1966) reported a mild degree of renal dysfunction and significant increases in the relative weights of several organs, mainly at the 2\u00b0/'0 level, but these changes were not observed by Chambers et al. (1966) . In a short-term feeding study in the pig, there were no adverse findings with doses up to 100mg Brown HT/kg body weight/day (Hendy et al. 1978) .\n\nLong-term feeding studies in rats (Carpanini et al. 1978 ) and mice (Drake et al. 1978) failed to reveal any carcinogenic effect of Brown HT at dose levels up to 500 and 700mg/kg/day, respectively. The nountoward-effect levels in these studies were 1.0%o of the diet (c. 500 mg/kg/day) in the rat, and 0.1% (c. 140 mg/kg/day) in the mouse. In the latter study, the findings at the highest dietary level (0.5%) were a slightly reduced body-weight gain and a lower heart weight in males, reduced total leucocyte count and packed cell volume in females, and brown coloration of the lymph nodes and intestine in both sexes and of the ovaries and uterus.\n\nIn vitro genotoxicity assays have shown that Brown HT does not induce point or frameshift mutations in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium (Bonin & Baker, 1980; Haveland-Smith & Combes, 1980) , and does not produce detectable DNA damage in repairdeficient strains of Escherichia coli (Haveland-Smith & Combes, 1980 ). An early metabolic study (Fore et al. 1967) showed that Brown HT was decolorized, and a number of other azo dyes (Walker, 1970) undergo azo-reductive fission, when incubated with rat-liver homogenates. Recently Phillips et al. (1987) have reported the presence of both Brown HT and its azo-reduced metabolite, naphthionic acid, in the faeces of rats, mice and guinea-pigs, whereas naphthionic acid was the only major metabolite detected in urine. Studies by Mallett et al. (1982) demonstrated that the metabolites of Brown HT incubated in a continuous culture of rat hind-gut microflora were virtually identical to those isolated from rat faeces by thin-layer chromatography. The major metabolite was again naphthionic acid.\n\nThe present investigation was carried out on behalf of the UK Colours Steering Group to provide the data requested by the EEC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF, 1975) (JECFA, 1978) .\n\nThe data contained within this paper were reviewed by the SCF in July 1983 and an ADI was established at 0.3 mg/kg body weight, with no request for further data. Similarly these data were reviewed in March 1984 by JECFA and an ADI of 0--1.5 mg/kg body weight was established.\n\nTest material. Brown HT was supplied by Williams (Hounsiow) Ltd, Hounslow, Middlesex. Analysis carded out by the suppliers showed that the material contained: dye, 70.4%; subsidiary dyes, < 15%; volatile matter, 2.1%; water-insoluble matter, 0.06%; sodium chloride, 31.3%; arsenic, <lppm; lead, < 5 ppm; iron, 30 ppm; copper, < 1 ppm; chromium, < 1 ppm; zinc, 1 ppm; cadmium, < 1 ppm; mercury, 0.8 ppm; free aromatic amines (as aniline), < 10 ppm; ether extractable material, 0.1%; naphthionic acid, 0.7%. (Figures for impurities have been prorated to correspond to 100% dye content.)\n\nAnimal maintenance. Weanling rats of a Wistarderived outbred strain were outlined as litters from a specified-pathogen-free breeding colony (University of Nottingham, Joint Animal Breeding Unit, Loughborough, Leicester). Groups of six of the same sex and treatment were housed in polypropylene cages with open-mesh stainless-steel wire tops and floors (North Kent Plastic Cages Ltd, Dartford, Kent), suspended on racks over high-wet-strength paper for collection of excreta. Pregnant females were housed in similar cages with solid floors and sawdust bedding. Throughout the study the animals were maintained in air-conditioned rooms with an ambient air temperature of approximately 20\u00b0C, relative humidity in the range 40-60%, and an automatic 14/10-hr light/dark cycle. The weanling rats were allowed to acclimatize to the environmental conditions for 2 wk before receiving the test diets.\n\nDiets. The animals were allowed free access to food and tap-water during all phases of the study. Control rats received a basic powdered diet, Spratt's Laboratory Animal Diet No. 2 (Spratt's Patent Ltd, Barking, Essex) . Test diets contained concentrations of Brown HT calculated on the basis of food intake and body weight measurements to provide, as accurately as possible, a constant intake of 0 (control), 50, 250 or 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight/day throughout the experiment. When rats of more than one age shared the same cage the dietary concentration was calculated on the basis of the youngest animal's food intake and body weight. A sample of each diet was analysed for Brown HT content prior to use.\n\nThe scheme of the study is shown in Fig. 1 . Weanling F0 rats were randomized into four groups for each sex and fed diets containing sufficient Brown HT to provide daily intakes of 0 (control), 50, 250 or 500mg/kg body weight. The six test groups each contained 36 rats and the untreated control groups 60 rats each. Mating of the F0 animals, to provide F~ litters, commenced after 60 days on the test diet. Pairs were selected from within each group by random techniques, with changes where necessary to avoid sibling matings. The first 24 females from the control group and 12 females from each of the three treatment groups to conceive were time-mated so that the date of coition was known (day of mating was designated day 0). These females were killed on day 20 of gestation for a gross autopsy and a detailed examination of the uterus and its contents. The foetuses were examined for external and visceral defects, weighed and preserved for examination of skeletal development. A gross post-mortem examination was performed on the males used for the timed matings, The remaining males and females were housed in pairs for 12 days (approximately three oestrous cycles) to allow mating. The males were then removed and the pregnant females were individually housed in solid-floored cages and allowed to deliver and rear their young. Survival, growth and development of the offspring were monitored over the first 21 days of life. After weaning, young males and females were randomly selected from the litters, either to constitute the next generation (F1) or for autopsy. Where possible, at least one male and one female were selected from each litter to provide equal numbers for the FI generation as were used for the F 0 generation. Distribution was such that the F~ mean weights were similar for each group. At the same time, where possible, one male and one female were chosen from each litter and killed at 33 + 2 days after birth and a full autopsy was carried out. A gross autopsy was performed on the remaining young rats. The F0 adult animals (random-mated) were killed and subjected to a full post-mortem examination.\n\nThe procedure described for the F0 generation was followed with the F~ rats to provide the F2a litters. However, because of low litter survival, the F~ adults were mated a second time using the same pairs to provide the F2b litters. After weaning, the F2a and F2b young were selected either to continue treatment or for autopsy as described for the F~ generation. The group sizes of the F2a generation were: control, 36 per sex; test, 24 per sex. These animals continued on treatment for 42 days, after which they were killed and given a full post-mortem examination. The group sizes of the F2b generation were the same as those used for the F 0 and F 1 generations. The procedure described for the F 0 generation was repeated with the F2b rats to provide the F3 litters. After weaning, up to three males and three females were selected at random from each litter for a full post-mortem examination, performed on day 70 _ 2 post partum. The remaining F 3 young were killed for a gross autopsy. A histological examination was carried out on the tissues taken from the F 3 control rats and those given 500 mg Brown HT/kg/day. Throughout the study mating was permitted only between males and females from the same generation and treatment group, and offspring received from weaning the same test or control diet as their parents.\n\nObservations. In each generation (F0, F 1 and F2b ) individual body weights were recorded at weekly intervals and measurements of food and water intake were made at twice-weekly intervals for a period of approximately 60 days prior to mating. In the Fza and F 3 generations these parameters were monitored for 42 and 49 days, respectively. From these measure- \n\nments the average daily food and water consumption and colouring intake per rat were calculated. All animals at all stages of the study were observed daily, and any considered unfit to continue were killed and a full autopsy was performed. Righting response: to test the mid-air righting reflex, each animal was dropped from a supine position at a height of 30cm onto a padded surface. A stable landing on all four legs was considered a positive response. Startle response: each animal was isolated and subjected to a single metallic 'click' generated at a distance of 20cm. Any sudden movement was considered a positive response. Clinging ability: each animal was supported on the palm of the hand and allowed to touch a thin wire suspended 30 cm above a bench surface. Grasping usually ensued, immediately followed by attempts to flex the forelimbs and support the body with the hindlimbs. Grasping the wire with one or both hindlimbs was regarded as a positive response.\n\nFor each litter, the day of appearance of a particular developmental milestone was taken as the number of days after birth when a positive observation or response was obtained for all pups in the litter.\n\nPost-mortem examination. Animals subjected to a full post-mortem examination (see experimental design) were weighed following an overnight fast (with free access to water) and then killed by exsanguination whilst anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbitone. During the autopsy, the adrenal glands, brain, caecum (with and without its contents) gonads, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, stomach and thyroid gland were removed and weighed (the thyroid gland was not weighed during autopsy of the F2b and F3 generations). These organs, together with samples of the aorta, colon, eye, Harderian gland, lungs, lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric), mammary tissue, oesophagus, pancreas, rectum, salivary glands, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, thymus, trachea, urinary bladder, vena cava, seminal vesicles and epididymis or uterus and vagina, and any other tissues that appeared to be abnormal, were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin.\n\nAnimals subjected to a gross autopsy (see experimental design) were allowed free access to food and water until they were killed. Young rats were killed by inhalation of either diethyl ether or carbon dioxide. Older animals were killed by exsanguination under barbiturate anaesthesia. A general examination of all tissues listed above was carried out. Any tissues that were considered to be abnormal were preserved in 10% buffered formalin.\n\nHistopathology. Paraffin wax sections of the tissues taken at autopsy from the F 3 generation control rats and rats given 500mg Brown HT/kg body weight were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for examination by light microscopy.\n\nHistopathological findings @3 generation) were analysed by the Fisher's exact probability test (Armitage, 1980) . Full or gross post-mortem observations and the number of dams that produced litters/number of dams mated were analysed for a positive or negative dose-related trend by the method of Peto et al. (1980) . Organ weights were analysed using an analysis of variance and Student's t test.\n\nFor the analysis of observations recorded during the examination of alizarin-stained foetuses (F 3 generation) the litter was considered to be the basic experimental unit. For each skeletal element, the proportion of foetuses within each litter exhibiting the normal feature (the observation that occurred most frequently in all foetuses from the control group) was determined. The proportions were subjected to arcsin transformation (Snedecor & Cochran, 1968 ) followed by one-way analysis of variance.\n\nOther observations were analysed by analysis of variance and a least significant difference test (Snedecor & Cochran, 1968) . The level of significance chosen in all cases was P < 0.05.\n\nAlthough the health of the animals was generally good throughout the study several deaths occurred. These were confined to females at the time of parturition, mainly in F l generation animals (Table 1 ). In addition a number of females from both F~ and F2b generations failed to nurse their litters, resulting in pup deaths. The occurrence of these changes was not related to treatment. The loss of litters following the first mating of the F 1 generation was so great that insufficient pups survived for a full continuation of the study. The F1 animals that survived were remated and despite the recurrence of the signs of ill-health in a number of pregnant females, a sufficient number of young and range of litters survived to allow the study to be continued.\n\nThere were occasional differences between treated and control groups, but overall there were no adverse treatment-related trends in either food or water consumption or in body-weight gain. Calculation of Brown HT intake, based upon body weight and food-intake data, indicated that the dose received by the treated groups was within 10% of that intended.\n\nThe proportion of paired females that became pregnant (fertility rate) was similar in the control and treated groups (Table 2) , and the number of nonviable litters did not increase with treatment. The total numbers of litters lost through parental neglect or death of the female during the reproductive phase of the F0, FI and F2b generations are shown in Table 1 . The summary table shows that the litter losses occurred in all groups and that they were not related to treatment with Brown HT.\n\nAlthough litter survival was reduced in all groups during the first few days of life, there were no statistically significant differences between the control and treated groups in average litter size, or growth and development of the young (Table 2 ) or in the sex ratios. Apart from a few young that failed to gain weight at a rate comparable with their litter mates, the general condition of the viable litters was good throughout lactation and weaning.\n\nThe autopsy findings of the uterine contents of the time-mated females killed on day 20 of gestation are summarized in Table 3 . In the F0 generation there were significantly fewer corpora lutea in the highdose group than in the control, and the average numbers of implantations and live foetuses were also slightly below control values in this group. Conversely, mean foetal weight was significantly higher in this group and in the low-dose group than in the control. Other autopsy findings of the F 0 generation were of similar incidence in the control and treated females. Apart from a lower ratio of postimplantation losses to implantations in the 50-mg/kg group compared with the control in the F2b generation, there were no significant differences in any of the variables studied as indicators of uterine development in the Fl and F2b generations.\n\nThere were no external, visceral or skeletal abnormalities in the foetuses (F 3 generation) and only minor variations in the degree of skeletal ossification. A statistical analysis of the findings in the alizarinstained preparations revealed some slight evidence of retarded ossification of the third sternebrae with treatment.\n\nIn both sexes there were a number of statistically significant differences between the treated and control groups in the weights of the various organs taken at autopsy of adult (Table 4 ) and young (Table 5) rats. In many instances these differences were no longer statistically significant when the organ weights were expressed relative to body weight. The few organweight differences that were statistically significant were isolated and showed no dose-related trend.\n\nThe only finding that was consistently associated with treatment at the adult stage of each generation was a statistically significant increase in kidney weight. This was apparent at the 500-mg/kg dose level of male rats in all generations; in the male and female rats at the 250-mg/kg level in the F0 generation, in female rats at the 50-mg/kg level in the F2b generation, and in the female top-dose group in the F 1 and F 2 generations. These differences remained statistically significant when the kidney weight was expressed relative to body weight in all cases except for the 50-mg/kg group in the F:b generation and the female top-dose group in the F 1 generation. There was a statistically significant increase in relative kidney weight in young top-dose level rats of both sexes Table 3 .

Values marked with an asterisk differ from those for controls (P < 0.05) by a least significant difference test subsequent to a significant result from an analysis of variance over all treatments. Table 4 . Summary of statistically significant differences in organ weights between control and Brown HT-treated groups of adult rats of generations F 0, F~,\n\nGenerations with organ weights less than those of the controlt Caecum weights of adult treated females of the F0 and F1 generations were often greater than those of the controls. Males showed no such differences but young females showed a similar trend in the final generation. Remaining differences in organ weights were isolated and showed no dose relationship.\n\nMacroscopic findings at autopsy were similar for all groups, but the mesenteric lymph nodes of treated animals were frequently reported to be brown, with the greatest coloration at the highest dose. Additionally, brown coloration of the caecum and molars was recorded for some of the highest-dose animals.\n\nMicroscopic examination of tissues from F3 rats revealed no changes that were consistently associated with treatment.\n\nIt is possible that the deaths of F 1 females at parturition and other signs of ill-health were due to rat corona virus, as characteristic lesions were identified in the lungs and Harderian glands of FI females at autopsy. Serological analysis failed to confirm this diagnosis and a positive identification of the causative agent was not possible. It is considered likely that the stress of littering may have aggravated an otherwise mild, subclinical infection.\n\nThe lack of effect of treatment on body weight and food or water intakes are in agreement with the results of Carpanini et al. (1978) .\n\nWhile brown coloration of the gastro-intestinal tract and mesenteric lymph nodes has been reported in many earlier studies (Chambers et al. 1966; Drake et al. 1978; Grant & Gaunt, 1987; Hall et al. 1966; Hendy et al. 1978) there is no evidence that this has any adverse effect on animals. In a recent metabolic study using 14C-labelled Brown HT (Phillips et al. 1987) , it was shown that small amounts of the compound and/or its metabolites accumulate in most tissues of the rat during repeated daily administration, but the accumulation was only tissue-specific in the mesenteric lymph nodes and kidney. An increase in the accumulation of colouring with prolonged treatment is also suggested in the study reported here. The incidence of coloration of the tissues was greatest in the adult animals exposed to the highest dose of Brown HT, and most infrequent in the young killed shortly after weaning.\n\nThe slight caecal enlargement seen on several occasions in treated females may represent a mild effect of treatment. A similar time-related enlargement of the caecum has been observed in rats fed diets containing other food colourings including Sunset Yellow FCF (Gaunt et al. 1967) , Ponceau 4R (Brantom et al. 1987) and Green S (Moorhouse et al. 1987) , and there is some evidence that the effect may be more pronounced in females (Moorhouse et al. 1987) . The aetiology of caecal enlargement is uncertain, but it can be induced by the administration of a wide variety of compounds (Leegwater et aL 1974) . It is generally considered to be a process of physiological adaptation and of no toxicological significance (Butterworth et al. 1975; Leegwater et aL 1974) .\n\nThe kidney weights of rats given the highest dose of Brown HT were consistently higher than those of the controls. An association with treatment is reinforced by the observation that these increases occurred only after a period of feeding and not in animals killed soon after weaning. In short-term feeding studies, Chambers et al. (1966) and Hall et al. (1966) found no significant change in the kidney weights of rats given approximately 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight for 13 wk, but the latter group did find evidence of mild renal dysfunction (increased urinary glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity) in both sexes at this dose level, and both studies reported significant increases in kidney weight at the highest dose level used (approximately 1000mg Brown HT/kg body weight). Carpanini et al. (1978) also reported an increase in the relative kidney weights of male rats fed approximately 500mg Brown HT/kg body weight for 2 yr. In a recent metabolic study (Phillips et al. 1987) it was shown that up to 20% of the radioactivity associated with a single, oral dose of 14C-labelled Brown HT was excreted in the urine, mainly (80%) in the form of naphthionic acid, and that most (70%) of this renal clearance was effected within 24 hr of dosing. From these findings, it is reasonable to assume that in feeding studies, where treatment is continuous, there is a continuous excretory load on the kidney. The slight increase in kidney weight may be simply an adaptive response to this increased excretory load, or may indicate a toxic effect of treatment. From our findings it was not possible to determine the relative contribution of these factors to the changes seen. The fact that no renal damage was detected on histological examination is strong evidence against nephrotoxicity. However, as Kluwe (1981) has pointed out, the absence of histological changes does not necessarily preclude injury. Brown HT and/or its metabolites have been shown to accumulate in the kidney (Chambers et al. 1966; Hall et al. 1966; Phillips et al. 1987 ) and, although rapidly cleared upon cessation of treatment (Phillips et al. 1987) , may exert a mild toxic effect while present.\n\nIn the study reported here there was no evidence of an effect on the kidney at the intermediate dose level (250 mg Brown HT/kg body weight), and even at the highest treatment level the increases in kidney weight were slight and not always statistically significant in both sexes in each generation.\n\nThere was no evidence that Brown HT had any adverse effects on male fertility, on ovulation (as indicated by the number of corpora lutea), on the number of ova that implanted or on the number of implantations that gave rise to viable foetuses. These findings confirm and extend work by Grant & Gaunt (1987) , which showed that there were no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects following the administration of Brown HT to female rats throughout pregnancy. The smaller number of corpora lutea, and slightly lower implantation rate in the F 0 high-dose females, suggested a possible effect on ovulation. However, as these changes were not encountered at the three later matings, it is considered unlikely that they were the result of treatment.\n\nAlthough no major changes in skeletal development were encountered in this study, the finding of a slight dose-related reduction in ossification of the third sternebrae is at variance with the observations of Grant & Gaunt (1987) . They concluded that both the sternum and forelimbs of foetuses taken from females given 1000 mg Brown HT/kg body weight throughout pregnancy were at a slightly more advanced stage of development than those of the control. However, minor differences in the degree of skeletal ossification, such as those encountered in our study and in the previous teratology study (Grant & Gaunt, 1987) , are often seen in 20-day rat foetuses (Aliverti et al. 1979) , and in the absence of clear signs of embryotoxicity or retarded foetal development are considered acceptable variations of normal (Kimmel & Wilson, 1973) .\n\nThe increased incidence of post-partum deaths during the first few days of the F 2 and F 3 generations was due to a lack of maternal care by unhealthy dams rather than to treatment. This view is based on the fact that in the generations in which females showed signs of ill-health at parturition, complete litter losses (i.e. litters in which all the young died within a few days of birth) were similar in control and treated groups. In addition, the litter survival rate to weaning was the same in the control and treated groups at all phases of the study.\n\nIn summary, the only findings in the study that could be related to treatment were caecal enlargement, brown coloration of the lymph nodes and some areas of the gastro-intestinal tract, and indications of nephrotoxicity in the form of increased kidney weight. There was no evidence that any of these findings had any adverse effects on the animals. However, on the basis of the changes in kidney weight, it is concluded that the no-untoward-effect level in this study is 250 mg Brown HT/kg/day."}
