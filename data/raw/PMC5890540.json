{"title": "Addressing the selectivity and toxicity of antiviral nucleosides", "body": "As most nucleoside/tides analogs need to be transformed into 5\u2019-TP to exert on-target and off-target effects, their TP forms are necessary for elucidating these mechanisms (Table 1). The typical initial enzymatic assay for polymerases is a radioactivity-based polymerization assay, in which the inhibition by nucleotides is measured as an IC50 value. The inhibition IC50 assays can be easily adapted to a 96-well filter binding assay, and multiple compounds can be accessed simultaneously. However, based on inhibition studies alone, one cannot establish whether the nucleotide was actually incorporated. Therefore, a single nucleotide incorporation (SNI) assay can be particularly useful to determine if a NTP analog actually served as a substrate for the polymerases. Under a high concentration of NTP analogs (e.g. 500 \u00b5M ribose nucleotide TP (rNTP) or 50\u2013100 \u00b5M 2\u2032-deoxyribose nucleotide TP (dNTP)), the relative rate of incorporation of an analog can be compared to that of its natural NTP counterpart. For further mechanistic insight, a pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the NTP incorporation offers detailed kinetic parameters such as pre-steady state polymerization rate constant kpol and NTP dissociation constant Kd. In these studies, incorporation rates are studied using multiple time points and nucleotide concentrations, often using quench-flow techniques, making these studies reagent- and time-consuming. Finally, the mechanism of a nucleotide analog-derived enzyme inhibition can be revealed by an elongation assay, in which a stable elongation complex is formed, and the incorporation of the next few natural NTPs is measured. Normally, an NTP analog can be characterized into one of the three groups: chain-terminators, delayed chain-terminators, or stably incorporated analogs. Stably incorporated NTP analogs are difficult to study for toxicity as they could lead to little or no quantitative changes in DNA, RNA, or protein expression.36\n\nThe quality of the above-mentioned biochemical assays relies heavily on the availability of high quality TP active forms, which can be time- and resource-consuming to synthesize, and the TP salts are subject to degradation overtime. At times, certain inorganic contaminants could lead to apparent inhibition of polymerases.\n\nDue to their mechanism of action, nucleoside analogs are generally evaluated for 5\u20138 days in both replicating laboratory-adapted cell lines and non-replicating primary cells.18 A standard readout is the effect of compound on the ATP level within the cells. We found that among 20+ laboratory-adapted cells we tested, prostate cancer-derived PC-3 cells and T-cell leukemia-derived MT4 cells are generally the most sensitive to toxins, and are significantly more sensitive than HepG2 cells, a widely used cell line for in vitro toxicity studies. In addition, we found that laboratory-adapted cells are as useful for detecting potential toxicity liabilities as primary cells.\n\nIn certain cases, testing in a specific cell assay is warranted. For example, a number of the first-generation HIV nucleoside analogs showed myelosuppressive effects. As a result, the FDA recommended evaluating this toxicity on the growth of human bone marrow progenitor cells in colony formation assays.37\n\nA nucleoside/tide analog\u2019s cytotoxicity is often directly related to its cellular level of the active TP metabolite. BMS-986094 and IDX184 are both 2\u2032CMe guanosine nucleotide prodrugs, but the former formed >37-fold higher TP, and this correlated with its significantly higher toxicity.18 Some nucleoside analogs are poorly phosphorylated in cells, such as balapiravir. Even though it is a specific inhibitor of POLRMT, balapiravir showed little or no toxicity in a large panel of cell lines and primary cells tested, but development of this compound was stopped at Phase II due to toxicity.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, we employed three mitochondria-focused cell-based assays to evaluate potential mitochondrial toxicity. The mitochondrial DNA content assay has been widely used to study 2\u2032-deoxy nucleoside analogs, but it does not assess the effect of ribose nucleoside/tide analogs on mitochrondrial RNA synthesis.20,29 ddC serves as a good positive control and HepG2 cells seem to be an ideal cell line for this assay.\n\nThe mitochondrial protein synthesis assay has been useful to evaluate ribonucleoside/tide analogs. In this assay, the levels of two proteins are measured simultaneously: the mitochondrial DNA-encoded protein cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COX-1) and a nuclear DNA-encoded protein succinate dehydrogenase A (SDH-A).32 For data analysis, we found that comparing the individual levels of the COX-1 and SDH-A proteins to the untreated DMSO control yielded more reproducible data than using the ratio of COX-1:SDH-A. Chloramphenicol, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis, is used as the positive control.\n\nSince the 1950s, mitochondrial respiration has been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the measurement of mitochondrial function.38 It has been used extensively to study mitochondrial toxins that directly impair the electron transport chain but has not been used to study the nucleoside/tide analogs until recently.39\u201342 This assay provides a sensitive functional readout and does not require knowledge of the mechanism of action.20 A complete loss of mitochondrial respiration capacity can be detected before any change in the cellular ATP level, and this phenomenon has been observed for inhibitors with diverse molecular targets including ddC (inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA synthesis), 4\u2032-azido cytidine (inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA synthesis), and chloramphenicol (inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis). For compounds that show both mitochondrial and general toxicity (such as BMS-986094), this method makes it possible to identify whether mitochondria toxicity occurs at a lower drug concentration.20 For both mitochondrial protein and respiration assays, we found that PC-3 cells offer higher sensitivity and reproducibility than HepG2 cells.20\n\nWhen faced with mitochondria damage, cells are known to switch to glycolysis to generate ATP; therefore the glucose\u2013galactose CC50 assay has been widely used to detect mitochondria toxicity.43 In the absence of glucose, the galactose-adapted cells are forced to rely heavily on mitochondrial OXPHOS and thus would show a \u22653-fold decrease in CC50.44 However, the predictivity of this assay was challenged by Hyne\u2019s 2013 report showing that this assay only detected 2\u20135% of the 200 potential mitochondrial toxins tested.44,45 Even though no nucleoside/tide analogs were included in Hyne\u2019s study, it is consistent with our finding from testing >30 clinically relevant nucleoside/tide analogs. None of the known mitochondrial toxins such as ddC, FIAU, or 4\u2032-azido C showed enhanced cytotoxicity in galactose-adapted cells.\n\nResearch and development of a significant number of nucleoside/tide analogs were terminated in the pre-clinical stage due to toxicity in the animal models; though only a few were reported24,46,47 and mitochondrial toxicity was indicated or suspected. To date, due to a number of factors outlined above, mitochondrial toxicity has been difficult to detect in animal species and correlation to humans is at best tenuous.48 Potentially, animal models with genetic mitochondrial abnormalities or humanized animals may be more sensitive to nucleoside/tide toxicity. For example, mice models with genetic mitochondrial abnormalities such as heterozygous superoxide dismutase 2 knockout (Sod+/\u2212) mice were more susceptible to mitochondria toxins than the wild-type animals.49 Recently, Xu et al. reported FIAU-induced liver toxicity in chimeric TK-NOG mice grafted with humanized livers.50 Animal models like these may improve our ability to detect nucleoside toxicity.\n\nAs viral diseases vary greatly in duration and severity, the safety threshold of an antiviral nucleoside/tide needs to be considered in the context of its efficacy and treatment duration. For example, compounds to treat acute and deadly viral infections such as Ebola would likely have different safety criteria than drugs used to control chronic infections such as HIV-1 and HBV. Existing nucleoside/tides are routinely screened against emerging viruses, and it is possible that a compound that failed to achieve an adequate therapeutic window against one virus may be suitable for treating other viral infections.\n\nAnti-viral nucleoside/tide analogs target the viral DNA and RNA replication machinery, and this mechanism makes them potential inhibitors of host DNA and RNA synthesis as well, especially mitochondrial DNA and RNA synthesis. Mitochondrial toxicity manifests in multiple forms in vivo and underlies many clinical-stage failures and has been difficult to detect in animal studies. Over the past 30 years, a battery of in vitro tests for mitochondrial toxicity has evolved and continues to expand, allowing for improved early detection of mitochondrial liability. As for any drug molecule, the actual toxicity liability cannot be assessed fully until tested in animal toxicity studies and eventually in human clinical trials. Nevertheless, we believe that employing the proper biochemical and cellular assays early on will have a meaningful impact on reducing pre-clinical and clinical toxicity liability for this class of compounds."}
