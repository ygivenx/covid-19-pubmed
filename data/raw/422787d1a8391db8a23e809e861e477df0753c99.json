{"title": "Assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 in Brazil: Mobility, Morbidity and the burden on the Health Care System", "body": "As of 21 March 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has reached 184 countries with 266,073 confirmed cases and 11,184 deaths, globally [1] . The first imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Brazil on February 26, 2020, in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo [2] , only two months after the alert on COVID-19 went off in China. 5 All twenty seven federative units currently have suspect cases of COVID-19 infection, while 16 states and the Federal District have already confirmed a total of 428 cases (11,278 under investigation) [3] .\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states identified virus community transmission on March 13, 2020 [4, 5, 6]. Just four days later, 240 cases were confirmed in 10 S\u00e3o Paulo, 4 deaths were registered, and 5,334 individuals remain under investigation [3] . In Rio de Janeiro, 45 have been confirmed and 1,254 individuals are under investigation, according to the Ministry of Health [3] . The corresponding capitals -which are also called S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -are the most populous metropolitan areas of Brazil, with millions of people living 15 in precarious conditions. These two states are also the country's main local and international hubs, with millions of people moving from place to place. Other pathogens such as Influenza A H1N1, in 2009, and various strains of the dengue virus, are known to have been introduced in the country through these hubs [7] .\n\nAll countries that were strongly affected by COVID-19 have so far reported 20 that the huge numbers of infected patients who require intensive care or who need to be admitted to a hospital have led the health care system into total collapse. Thus, knowing which regions in the country should be expected to be 2 .

In our analysis, we considered a scenario in which there are no mobility restrictions and as such configures the worst case scenario. Even though implementation of mobility restrictions and social distance are starting to be adopted by the country, it is 30 still not clear whether the population will fully adhere to such restrictions, so that the current effect of these measures are not known yet.\n\nBrazil presents strong spatial heterogeneity in terms of demography, age distribution, access to public health, and poverty indexes. Because of these inequalities, the COVID-19 epidemic should impact these populations differ-35 ently, if factors such as transmissibility, lethality and vulnerability are taken into account.\n\nIn this article we provide quantitative metrics to help identify the regions in the country that are most vulnerable to the COVID-19. To identify these regions, we considered three main criteria: national mobility patterns, sociode-40 mographic and economic characteristics of each region, and the health care infrastructure in terms of local hospitals capacity to handle the high demand that is expected for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAll analyses were done at the micro-regional administrative level. Brazil is divided into 558 micro-regional administrative units, whose sizes vary between 13 million people in the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo to 2, 703 in Fernando de Noronha island, in Pernambuco.\n\nTo measure the mobility between micro-regions, we used daily air travel 50 statistics from the Official Airline Guide (OAG) [8] for long-range mobility, and shorter distance pendular travels from the 2010 national census (IBGE) [9] .\n\n3 .

Infrastructure for COVID-19 hospitalization per micro-region was obtained from DataSUS [10] . We calculated the number of standard hospital beds and 65 complementary beds (Intensive Care Unit and Intermediate Unit) available for each micro-region [10] , from the public (SUS) and private (non-SUS) sectors, per 10, 000 inhabitants.\n\nTo assess the probability of COVID-19 spreading within the Brazilian ter-70 ritory in the absence of mobility restrictions, we calculated the effective distance (E f (i, j)) between micro-regions using air travel data. The value of E f (i, j) is a measure of proximity between two micro-regions i and j created by the flow of people, which is known to strongly correlate with the time it takes to import infectious diseases into new territories from a well-defined ori-75 gin [11, 12] , particularly for diseases with direct transmission. To facilitate comparison between different scenarios, we also calculated a relative effective distance index (e f ), dividing E f by the distance to the nearest destination:\n\nWe computed E f from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro separately in order to assess the potential contribution of each one.\n\nThis information was mapped into micro-region origin-destination pairs by summing over the corresponding airports serving each micro-region based on its 4 .

The parameter R 0 is the basic reproduction number [14] . For the purpose of the results shown, we set R 0 = 2.5, which is compatible with previous studies [15, 16, 17, 18] .\n\nWe computed the outbreak probability per micro-region using two scenarios: The number of travelers per day between micro-regions was computed by adding the air travel data (used to calculate effective distance) and pendular mobility for work and study extracted from the 2010 Census [9] . The inclusion of pendular mobility is important to assess the spreading process between geo-105 graphically close micro-regions, while still preserving data-driven flow estimates.\n\nSecond generation of outbreaks. In this scenario, we assumed that all microregions with p epi \u2265 0.5 in the first scenario actually had outbreaks. In each of the outbreaks, the prevalence is set to the same level stated before for Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo micro-regions. Then we computed p epi again, to identify 110 5 .

These should not be confused with the infection serial interval.\n\nIt should be noted that this is a baseline scenario, which does not take into account the ongoing interventions affecting mobility, nor demographic and environmental effects that may play a role on the magnitude of R 0 . Our estimates 115 describe the expected initial momentum of the spread in Brazil.\n\nSocial vulnerability. Social vulnerability is expected to affect the effectiveness of mitigation strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Partitioning cluster analysis (k-medoid) was performed to identify regions with similar social vulnerability. This method is a more robust variation of the standard k-means. The S\u00e3o Paulo shows a more central role than Rio de Janeiro, evidenced by the larger 6 .

(Table   S1 ). \n\nWe identified five classes of social vulnerability, tentatively ordered from A Knowing in advance which regions can potentially suffer the biggest hit may allow authorities to opt for preemptive differential investments to the public health care system (SUS) in these regions.

Although analyses were carried on with Brazilian data alone, the approach presented here can be adapted for application in other countries as well. \n\nWe declare no conflict of interest\n\nThe study was not funded by any source.
