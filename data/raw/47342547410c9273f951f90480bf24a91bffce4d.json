{"title": "", "body": "Altered pathogenicity in the liver induced by a mouse hepatitis virus type 3 thermosensitive mutant Intraperitoneal inoculation into sensitive BALBic mice of D85. a thermosensitive (ts) mutant, provokes acute hepatitis followed by recovery of the mice, The ts mutant wes able to replicate in the liver. However. the maxmal viral titre was ohtained 2 days later than was the case with the wild-type (wt) MHV 3 infection; the viral antigens remained localized within small foci and no invasion of the entire liver was observed. The hepatocytes infected with D85 showed strong steatosis similatto that induced by wt virus. but the other lesions induced by MHV 3 (closing of endothelial cell ftflestrae and hepatocytolysis) were not seen. An important feature noticed with the D85 mutant concerned the establishmant, in the surviving animals, of persistent infection: this phenomenon was demonstrated by the decrease of viral title 10 the liver. virai RNA detection, and the fact that viral antigens gradually decreased until the 3rd month post-infection.\n\nMouse hepatitis vtntses (MHV) are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded positive RNA genome. The viral RNA encodes three structttral polypeptides: the phosphonucleoprotein N (@I kDa), the matrix glycoprotein M (21 kDa) and the glycoprotein of the perlomer S (180-90 kDa) responsible for attachment to receptors on permissive cells and for cell fusion. MHV produces a wide spect.um of diseases dependent on the particular viral strain as well as on host factors such es genetic background, age. route of infection and immune status (l-3). The MHV 3 strain causes acute hepatitis in most sensitive inbred mice including BALB/c mice (4). In this case. the infection of the Kupffer celk and endothelial cells is a prerequisite to the infection of the parenchymal cells in MHV 3 induced hepatitis (S-7). In vitro. all liver cells (Kupffer ce::~, endothelial cells (8) and hepatocytes (9)). are highly susceptible to MHV 3 which rapidly induces large syncvtia in them. In the csie of susceptible mice, infection by MHV 3 leads to the appearance ot procoagdant activity induced by monocytesimacrophages and contmlled by i lymphocytes resulting in ahnortnalities of microcirculation and the formation of sinusoidal micrnthrombi (10-13). We have recently isolated a panel of MHV 3 thermosensitive (is) ct!tants to Irudy tbc viral factors in valved in the hepatitir induced in sensitive BALBlc mice (14). This paper describes the pathogenicity of one mutant: D&5. The replication of this mutant is rsduced only at a temperature above 38 \"C. At 37 \"C, D85 is able to replicate in DBT cells. Biochemical studies showed that it was an RNA positive nx~tsnt. No difference was observed in the size of the viral intracellular RNA species or in the molecular weight 31 viral proteins.\n\nMouse L 2 cells and DET cells were grown separarely in a mimmum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum The wild-rype (at) MF!V 3 strain and the tl TEM: Mouse livers were fixed by perfusion with 1.5% glutaraldehyde buffered with 75 mM cacodylate at pH 7.4 through the portal vein according to the method of Wisse (16). Small blocks were post-fixed in phosphate-buffered 1% 050, for 1 h end dehydrated with ethanol. Epo\" was used as a\" embedding medium and thin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lcad citrate were observed under a Philips EM 410 electron microscope (Eindhoven, The Netherlands).\n\nTo determine the extent and localization of the lesions. 1 pm semi-thin sections from the same samples used for TEM were stained with tomidine blue and obsewed under a light microscope.\n\nThe perfused livers, cot into very small blocks, were fixed for 30 min more with 2% gbttaraldehyde either in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) or in a 0 1 M cacodylste buffer containing 1 mM M&I,. 1 mM CoCI, and 4.5% socrose (pH 7.3). They were the\" washed and glycerinated in 30% glycerol in the corresponding buffer for at least 4 hat 4 \"C. Each block, placed inside a suitable copper specime\" holder (Balzers), was frozen in subcooled nitrogen (close to -210 'C). The frozen specimens were then fractured either immediately or after a period of storage under liquid nitrogen in a Reichert-Jung 190 cryofract freeze-fracture device at -150 'C (Cambridge Instruments, Vilkpinte, France). The fracture planes were replicated with platinum at 45\" and coated with carbon. The replicas were cleaned in sodium hypochloride, washed in three changes of distilled water and picked up on hexagonal 7W mesh gold grids. They were examined in a Philips EM 410 electron microscope. Morphometry was performed on electron micrographs with a Kontro\" semiautomatic MOP Videoplan analyzer (EchinglMunich, F.R.G.). About 4OC0 pm2 of endothelial cell membranes from untreated liver or from mice liver inoculated with MHV 3 were examined.\n\nAfter the same fixation and dehydration processes used for TEEM, the liver samples were dried in a critical point dryer, coated with gold and observed under a Philips SEM 501 electron microscope.\n\nmmsm \"red m thus study have been previously described (14).\n\nTen week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) wnh 1.10' PFU of wt virus or Is mmant. Mice were killed at various times part infection (p.i.) and blood and bvcrs were collected. The livers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \"C: blood was allowed to clot for 1 h at 37 \"C and the serum was col. lected and stnrcd at -20 'C prior to assay.\n\nChilled pieces of liver were homogenized twice for 15 s in PBS buffer (5 ml/g of liver) with a Politron homogenizer. The virus titre was determined by plaque assays on L 2 cells, as previously described (i4).\n\nRNA was isolated from 0.3 g of liver from uninfected, MHV 3 infected, and Dg5 infected mice \"1 different times \"sing the guanidine isothiocyanate method (IS). For blot analysis. RNA in NTB (0.01 M Tris-HCI (pH 7.4). 0.1 M N&I. 1 mM EDT-A) was applied to nitrocellulose filters. Prehybridizatio\" was pcrformed in 10x SSC (lx SSC is 0.15 M NaCI. 0.015 M sodium citrate), 10% formaldehyde, 5x Denhardt's solution (50x Denhaidt's solution is 1% bovine serum albumine. 1% Ficoll and 1% polwinvlpyrrohdune)\n\nat 60 \"C. Hydridization was per&ed~in the same solution with the addition of 1.106 cpmlml of [\"P]cDNA from the purified denatured genamic RNA of MHV 3. Filters were washed four times at room temperature in 2X SSC and 0.2% SDS, twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 \"C and exposed to Curix film (Agfa Gevaert) at -80 'C.\n\nFrozen sections (1 r(m) of liver were cut on a cryostat before being used for indirect immunofluorescent or histological studies. The sections were fixed for 10 min with acetone ad washed twice for 5 min in PBS. Anti-MHV 3 antibody (IM~Uscction) was absorbed for 30 min at room temperature.\n\nSections were then washed three times in PBS. Fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse immu\"ogl\"bi\" G (LOO rl/section) (Institut Pasteur Production1 was added for 30 min at r&m temperature.\n\nEach slide was washed three times in PBS overlaid with glycerol (PBS/glycerol, 9:!) and examined under a Leitz fluorescent microscope. Anti-MHV 3 a\";ib\"dy was produced in the resistant Ail mice strain by two i.p. injections of 1.10\" PFUimouee; for most experimenrs the annbody was used at a final dilution of 1:100.\n\nAt 37 \"C. the wt virus and the ts mutant D85 replicate equally well in DBT cells (Fig. 1A) . However, at the per-missive temperature, the maximum titre obtamed with the ts mutant was approx. IO-times lower than that of the wt vitus. At 39.5 \"C, the replication of D8j was completely inhibited (Fig. 1B) .\n\nTo compare the pathogenicity of D85 to vn MHV 3, groups of twenty mice were inoculated i.p. with 1.10' PFUlmouse. This route was chosen because it had been demonstrated to result in earlier death of sensitive animals. Whilst wt MHV 3 killed 103% of the mice at 5 days p.i., D85 only killed 15% of the mice during the same period (Fig. ZA) . Although the LDm of wt MHV 3 WOE less than 1 PNlmouse. inoculation of as much as 5, IO1 PFUi mouse of D85 only ki!!rd 35% of the mice. Z>aily inspection showed that bath groups of mice erh?:,tted general lethargy. This symptom initially appeared 1.5 to 2 days pi. in the case of the wt virus and 3 days pi. in that of the mutant, and persisted until death or recovery. The bar': temperature of the mice remained at the same level throughout the infection (data not shown) indicating that survival following infection with this mutant was not a result of an increase in body temperature.\n\nViral replicadon in the liver Vim1 titres. Maximal virus titre in liver homogenates was the same with both viruses (Fig. 2B) . However, the maximal titre for the D85 mutant ofcured 1 to 2 days later than the equivalent point fat the wt virus; this coincides with the maximum intensity of the clmical symptoms. During the recovery of D85 infected mice, the viral titre decreased rapidly and was undetectable after day 7. Virus isolated from the livers of D85 infected mice was st~!l thermosensitive. Vim1 RNA defecdon. RNA extracted from liven of two Infected mice at difterent timer p-t_ was hybridized with a specific probe from genomic viral RNA, The dot blot analysis showed that the presence of MHV 3 RNA in Ihe hmng wal w11Ic1im11cs interrupted.\n\nIn addition, SEM examination rcvcalcd that when endotheiial cells were present in the sinusoids invaded with red blood cells (Fig. 58) . they displayed only a few fensstrae (msert Fig. 5B ) compared to umnfected liver endothehal cells (insert Fig. 4B ). After freeze-fracture, TEM examination confirmed thts wrpriwtg decrease in the number of rndothelial cell fe-nc~trac (Fig. SC) which did not involve wy other apoarent cellular membrane lesions. In this figure only 46 fenestrae were counted for a surface of 32.5#m2. In order to quantify this phenomenon a morphometric study was rifttied out or 41200 wt2 of endothelial cell membranes of both contx,: and infected mice livers and these tesolls ate summarized in Tabic 1. A Z-fold decrease in the mmtber of fenestrae per unit surface was found after 3 days of infection with MHV 3.\n\nIn addition to these sinusoidal lesions. an itoportant he.\n\npatocytolysis was obsuvrd 72 h p.i. (Fig. SA) . Only a few parenchymal cells were still recognizable. They displayed aa &cutniii&on of lipid droplets (Fig. 5A ). a dilatation of the RER ctstetnae and picootic nuclei (not shown). Viral panicles wete sometimes encountered near the large RER but were most frequently observed at the hcpatocyte-sinunotd border (not shown), or in sinusoids associated with fibrin deposits (Fig. SA, insert) .\n\nAfter mfection with Dg5. we were able to observe stmilx necrotic lesions in the sinusoid and to the hepalocytcs. But these lesions wete found only in a few areas. The only nottceable change in the hepatocytes, apatt from glycogen depletion, consisted o. a widespread steatosis observed both under TEM (Fig. 6A ) ztd SEM (Fig. 68) . The majority of sinusoidal cells .uere intact and the endothelial cells exhibited as many fenestrae (Ftg. 68) as those obcetved in uninfected cells (Fig. 4B and insert) .\n\nliver was maximal at 3 days p.i.; with DS5 detectton of YI-IBI RNA increased until 5 days p.i. and then decreased (Fig. ZC) . The RNA could still be detected 20 days p.i.. but from 45 days p.i. no RNA reacted with the probe. The probe did not bind to RNA isolated from uninfected mice livers. Viral onripens. In frozen sections of liver, viral anogens could be detected by indirect immonofluorescence 24 h after inlraperitoneal infection of wl virus. Anltgens were prominent in the periportal areas and in sinusoidal cells.\n\nAfter 48 h. large amounts of viral antigens were localized in the hepatic parenchymal cells. The aotount of antigen increased steadily until the death of the animals (Fig. 3A  and B) . In mice infected with mtttant D85. viral antigens .._ E__i ____:__ could bc detcc:;: P: 3: :, p.i.; hj_i-ii, UIC ..,~a a.,...u,=d of limited sire for 5 days following infectioo (Fig. 3D ) and then decreased until the l&h day (Fig. 3E) . For up to 3 months p.i., antigens could s!ill be detected in a very few individual cells (Fig. 3F ). This suggests that liter acute hepatitis, Dg5 induced a pe;;ial;;at ir&ctioir\n\nIn control mice livers, hepatocytes presented round nudei and the cytoplasm, rich in glycogen, mntained few lipid droplets (Fig. 3G ). From48 h p.i. with wt virus, tnassive steatosis and nomemos necrotic foci: picnotic nuclei and cytoplasmic lesions with accumulation of momtclear inflammatory cells were generally observed in the vicinity of the portal vein (Fig. 3H) . With the DR5 strain, necrotic areas were neither as nunemus nor as extensive compared to those induced by the WI vim% The majority of the hepatocytes did not appear damaged apart from the areas of extensive steatosis (not shown).\n\nIn the liver of control mice, observed ttt TEM level, the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes displayed a normal appearance: glycogen and mitochondria were numeroos and few lipid droplets were visible. The sinuroid, devoid of ted blood cells was lined by endothelial cells, in its lumen Kopffer cells were present (Fig. 4A) . At the SEM level endothelial cells displayed tutmemos fenestrae arranged in sieve plates ( Fig. 4B and insert) . These were also viw ble on the E and P faces of the fracture of endothelial cell membranes (Fig. 4C) . Three hundred and twenty-one fenestrae were counted in this figure for a surface of 37.5 pm* of endothelinl cell membrane. After wt virus infcction, sinusoidal lesions were cvideot at the TEM level (Fig. SA) . Sinusoids were invaded with ted blood cells. plasma, cellular debris and fibrin deposits often associated with ntonemos viral particles (Fig. 5A. insert) .\n\nInoculation of wi MHV 3 into BALBlc mice produces a fulminating hepatitis which leads to the death Of the animals in 3 or 4 days. This study reports the biolugical activities of a 1s mutant and an attempt lo correlate the severity of tbc disease witb histological and ultrastructural observmions. The ts mutant D85 was chosen since it is able lo repticaw in vitro at mo)use body temperature (37.5 'C). D85 was clearly an attenuated virus strain since only about 15% of the mice died after i.p. inoculation of IWO PFU. Histological observations of liver injury after wt virus infcctian was nearly identical to that previously reported with MHV 3 by Levy et al. (6). They also noticed the damage of the sinusoidal barrier, the presence of inflammatory foe; ;nd necrotic areas, and extensive inlravacularcoagulatior..\n\nThe only differences we observed in hepalocyte lesions were the si&nificanl modifications of the peroxysomes (17) and the accumulation of lipids in the liver, which seems specific to our virus strain. The origin of lipid accumulation in the liver is unknown, but biachemical determinations in the whole liver have shown an increase in the level of triglyceride* and rhnte*teml (onpublished data).\n\nElectron microscope observations confirmed that, after wt MHV 3 infection, the first lesions appeared in the hepatic sinusoid where the destruction of Kupffer cells and endothelial cells preceded the appearance of the hepatocyte lesions (7). We also observed a Z-fold decrease in the number of feneslrae in endolhelial cells. For a morphometric study we used the freeze-fracture technique (the best method to study membranes). after the 7th day p.i., the virus titrc was no longer detectable in the liver but the RNA could be detected 20 days p.i. and a very small number of hepalocytes with viral antigens could be observed after 1.5 months. The differences between non-infectlou particle production, viral RNA, and protein detection could be explained by various factors: (i) differences in the sensibility of the three detection le;hniques; (ii) blockage of translation, since viral mRNAs seemed to be intact; (iii) selective degradation of viral mRNAs by host enzymes, while allowing remaining mRNAs to continue coding for proteins; and (iv) inhibition of viral maturation, either due to genomic mutations or to modification of glycosylation of S and M pro- "}
