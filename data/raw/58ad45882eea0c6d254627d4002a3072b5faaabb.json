{"title": "", "body": "The density feature (arrowed), attributed to a partially resolved RNA in the peripentonal channels of the density map of 4.1-\u00c5 resolution (left) [3] , is also visible at nearly the same location of the density map of 3.8-\u00c5 (right). The atomic models (ribbon) superimposed on the density maps are two conformers of capsid shell protein VP1A (red) and VP1B (green). density features attributable to RNA can be observed at the channel outside.\n\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of\n\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of transcription reaction mixtures either containning different concentrations of GTP or incubated for different lengths of time. Lane 2, 3, and 6: these transcription reaction mixtures consisting of 70 mM Tris-Ac (pH 8), 10 mM MgAc2, 100 mM NaAc, 4 mM ATP, 2 mM CTP, 2 mM GTP, 2 mM UTP, 20 \u03bcCi [\u03b1-32 P] UTP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mM), 1 mM SAM, 1 U/\u03bcL RNase inhibitor and purified CPV suspension were incubated RNase inhibitor and purified CPV suspension were incubated at 31 \u2103 for 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h, respectively. Lane 1, 5, and 7: transcription reaction mixtures in which the concentration of GTP was decreased to 0.04 mM were incubated at 31\u00b0C for 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h, respectively. Lane 4: transcription reaction mixture in the absence of GTP. Movie S1 Atomic model of the turret formed by five VP3 monomers in red, purple, green, yellow, and blue, respectively. The two VP3 monomers in red and purple were for an inside view of the turret. The color scheme in the movie is the same as that in Fig. 3A . The first enzymatic domain that the nascent RNA reaches is the GTase domain of monomer C (green). A channel (denoted as channel-1), which is formed by a bridge domain and a brace domain of monomer A ( ), y g (yellow), and a brace domain of monomer B (blue), guides the RNA to the active site of 7-N-MTase of monomer A (yellow). Then, the RNA withdraws from the 7-N-MTase domain of monomer A (yellow) through channel-1 and approaches the active site of the adjacent 2'-O-MTase domain of monomer B (blue) through the channel-2, which is formed by bridge domain of the monomer A (yellow), GTase domain and 2'-O-MTase domain of the monomer B (blue)."}
