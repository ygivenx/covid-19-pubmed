{"title": "Artesunate interacts with Vitamin D receptor to reverse mouse model of sepsis-induced immunosuppression via enhancing autophagy Short running title: Artesunate reverses sepsis induced immunosuppression", "body": "Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide (Angus & van der Poll, 2013) ; it arises when hosts response to pathogen infections such as bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infection and then injury their own tissues and organs (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013b) . At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a newly recognized viruse, has spread rapidly throughout Wuhan (Hubei province) to other provinces in China and around the world, and has infected closed to 80,000 people in China and killed more than 2,000 untill Feb 26, 2020 because of no specific and effective drug.\n\nIn the course of sepsis, both innate and acquired immune systems are involved in its development, in which the mononuclear phagocyte system plays a crucial role. Although the timeline of immunological alterations in sepsis is not well understood, the suggestive evidence demonstrated that the development of sepsis involves two distinct stages, an initial cytokine storm (hyper-inflammation) and subsequent immunosuppression (hypo-inflammation), which exist concomitantly and dominate in different stage (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Hutchins, Unsinger, Hotchkiss & Ayala, 2014) . The uncontrolled cytokine storm is responsible for deaths occurring within the first few days, whereas immunosuppression predominantly causes mortality during the later stage of sepsis. In fact, more than 70% of patients die after the first three days of sepsis, which might due to the increased susceptibility to weakly virulent pathogens or opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), indicating a failure of the host to eradicate invading pathogens (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Skrupky, Kerby & Hotchkiss, 2011) . For patients in immunosuppression stage, only less than 5% of monocytes/macrophages produce cytokines, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Although contradictory findings have been reported (Ho et al., 2016) , accumulating evidence suggest that autophagy plays a key role in sepsis, and has been considered a potential target for sepsis-induced immunosuppression (Ren, Zhang, Wu & Yao, 2017) . It is promising to focus on autophagy axis to unveil the mechanism of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and discover the novel immunoregulating therapies for sepsis. Artesunate (AS) is an effective and reliable anti-malarial drug with low toxicity (Burrows, Chibale & Wells, 2011; Clark, White, S, Gaunt, Winstanley & Ward, 2004) , which possesses several interesting effects such as anti-inflammation and other effects (Efferth, Dunstan, Sauerbrey, Miyachi & Chitambar, 2001; Li et al., 2008; Miranda et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017) . Previously, we showed that AS protects septic animals by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release in cytokine storm stage (Li et al., 2008) , suggesting that AS could exhibit anti-inflammatory activity during the cytokine storm phase of sepsis.

METHODS\n\nBALB/c mice (sex: half male and half female; weight: 18 -22 g; age: 6 -8 weeks) were obtained from Beijing HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China) and housed in a pathogen-free facility with a 12-h artificial light-dark cycle in the Third Military Medical University. All the mice were provided with food and purified water ad libitum. There were no more than 5 mice in each cage. All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted were approved by Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University (AMUWEC2020015). Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guideline (Kilkenny, Browne, Cuthill, Emerson, Altman & Group, 2010) and with the recommendations made by the British Journal of Pharmacology.\n\nThe murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 cells and Human monocyte THP-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% low-LPS fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (regular medium) in a 37\u00b0C humid atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) regular medium in suspension. THP-1 derived macrophages were obtained by differentiating THP-1 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) treatment at 100 nM for 24 h according to the previous study .\n\n.

Each mouse was intraperitoneal injected with 3 mL of 3% thioglycolate (Sigma-Aldrich) on day 1 and sacrificed using isoflurane on Day 3. After intraperitoneal injection of 5 mL DMEM regular medium, the peritoneal cells were collected into cell culture dishes. Two hours later, the floating cells were removed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The attached cells were considered to be PMs (purity is about 90%) and were subjected to further experiments. The primary mouse macrophages or cell lines were maintained in regular medium at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. All the reagents and utensils used in the experiment were LPS-free.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) clinical insolate was kindly provided by Prof. Peiyuan Xia (Southwestern Hospital, Chongqing, China). Single colony was picked from viable, growing Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate. Then, it was transferred to 5 ml of liquid MH medium and cultivated aerobically at 37 \u2103 in orbital shaking incubator for 4 h. The cultures were transferred to 100 ml of fresh MH medium for another 12 h. At an OD600 of 0.6 -0.8, when the bacterial culture was within the logarithmic phase of growth measured by SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), the suspension was centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min to harvest the pellet. After washing twice, the pellet was re-suspended by sterile normal saline. The bacteria were diluted in sterile normal saline to achieve the terminal concentration [(colony-formation units (CFU)/mL], which was calculated according to the bacterial growth curve determined by our lab (Concentration = (9.7544 \u00d7 OD -1.4965) \u00d7 10 8 .

CLP immunosuppression mice (CLP mice) with second bacterial infection model was established in our lab and described (Deng et al., 2017) . Briefly, CLP mice were established by ligating the distal 1.0 cm of the cecum and puncturing once with a No. 16 steel needle, and then were intravenously injected with PA (with 2.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/kg) at 24 h after CLP surgery ( Figure 1a ) .\n\nNational Medicine Standard H10930195) was added into the attached 5% sodium bicarbonate injection, shaking for 2 minutes until completely dissolved, then diluted in sterile normal saline to achieve the terminal concentration. AS (10 mg/kg) was intramuscularly injected at 22, 26, 48, and 72 h following the CLP surgery. The survival rate of the mice was observed for 7 days. CLP mice were sacrificed at 4 h after PA injection. The blood, lungs, and spleen tissues were collected for CFU count assays and ELISA.\n\nLPS tolerance is extensively used to simulate the sepsis-induced immunosuppression phase in vitro (Li et al., 2013) . Herein, a cell model of LPS tolerance was established in mouse PMs) and RAW264.7 cells. Briefly, cells were cultured with LPS (0111: B4, Sigma-Aldrich, 5 .

Then the culture supernatant was replaced followed by the addition of LPS (100 ng/mL) to establish the LPS-tolerance cells model.\n\nFor AS treatment, AS (5, 10, and 20 \u00b5g/mL) was added with LPS (5 ng/mL) and LPS (100 ng/mL) simultaneously. For autophagy inhibitors treatment, 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich), bafilomycin A1(Baf, 10 ng/mL) (MedChemExpress, NJ, USA) and LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 \u03bcM) was added 2 h before the first LPS (5 ng/mL), and also with AS treatment simultaneously.

After three days of renewed culture in regular DMEM, the cells were subjected to further treatment.\n\nThe lentivirus VDR-KD and NC-KD was diluted to a total volume of 200 \u03bcl containing 4 \u00d7 10 7 TU. BALB/c mice were transfected through tail intravenous injection as reported (Morizono et al., 2005) . One week later, mice were sacrificed and spleen tissues were collect to detect the infection efficiency. Further CLP modeling and AS treatment were employed in transfected mice, and their tissues were collected for the cytokines and western bolting assays.\n\nInteracting molecular prediction for AS was performed against 5,311 proteins using the weighted ensemble similarity (WES) algorithm (Zheng et al., 2015) assembled in the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP)\n\n.

WES was developed to determine a drug's affiliation for a target by evaluation of the overall similarity (ensemble) rather than a single ligand judgment, which allowed us to discovery scaffold hopping ligands. The ligand structural and physicochemical features of AS were calculated using Chemical Development Kit (CDK) (Steinbeck, Han, Kuhn, Horlacher, Luttmann & Willighagen, 2003) and Dragon software and then used to evaluate the ensemble similarity between AS and ligands of candidate targets. Finally, the standardized ensemble similarities of CDK and Dragon were integrated using a Bayesian network to rank the predicted targets.\n\nRAW264.7 cells were treated as indicated above and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4\u2103 overnight and post fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h at room temperature.

After overnight culturing, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a series concentration of LPS or certain treatment for 4 or 24 h. Subsequently, 20 \u03bcl of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to the medium in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . Then, the supernatant was removed, and 150 \u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the produced formazan crystals. The extinction was measured at 490 nm using SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nFor the mouse tissue samples, at the indicated time points after PA injection, the blood, lungs, and spleen were collected.

The cell lysate containing the total proteins, including the VDR protein, were added into the plates. After incubating at 37 \uf0b0C for 2 h, the VDR protein was captured by anti-VDR antibody coated on the plates. Subsequently, the plates were washed three times and V D3 (Selleck, Houston, TX, USA) was added. After incubating at 37 \uf0b0C for 2 h, the plates were washed three times and fluorophore-conjugated AS (designed and synthesized by Chongqing Canbipharma Technology, Chongqing, China) was added. After incubating at 37 \uf0b0C for 2 h, the plates were washed three times and the fluorescence intensity was observed using a Spectra Max i3x Multifunctional enzyme marker (Molecular Devices, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm.

Results\n\nThe results from CLP mice showed that AS treatment decreased the mortality of CLP mice challenged with PA from 85% to 50% (Figure 1b) , suggesting that AS could protect CLP-induced immunosuppression in mice. In CLP mice unchallenged with PA, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were extremely low in the serum, spleen, and lungs. However, their levels increased significantly in AS-treated CLP mice (Figure 1c) . Furthermore, the cytokines levels in CLP mice challenged with PA were also much lower in contrast with sham mice challenged with PA, demonstrating that bacterial challenge could not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines release in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice. Importantly, AS treatment significantly augmented the cytokine levels (Figure 1d ), indicating that AS could increase cytokine levels in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice. Subsequently, the results showed that the bacterial loads obviously increased in the tissues of CLP mice challenged with PA compared with those in the sham mice, demonstrating that the CLP mice had a lower bacterial clearance ability. However, AS significantly decreased the bacterial load ( Figure 1e) , suggesting AS could protect sepsis-induced immunosuppression by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and decreasing the bacterial load.\n\nBased on the concentration-effect relationship between LPS and cytokine production ( Figure   . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.966143 doi: bioRxiv preprint 24 2a), 5 ng/mL LPS of four-hour incubation followed by 100 ng/mL LPS was determined to induce LPS tolerance phenotype (tolerance cells) (Figure 2b ). Compared with cells treated with only 100 ng/mL LPS treatment (LPS cells), tolerance cells pretreated with 5 ng/mL LPS and followed by 100 ng/mL LPS released much less TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 ( Figure 2c ). However, AS exhibited a dose-dependent enhancement of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 release in tolerance cells ( Figure 2d) . The results showed the bacterial loads in LPS tolerance cells increased relative to LPS cells at 2 h after PA challenge. Significantly, AS decreased the bacteria load in tolerance cells ( Figure 2e ). Noteworthily, since the concentrations of LPS (2.5 -200 ng/mL) and AS(0.625 -40 \u03bcg/ml) used in the experiment had no effect on cell viability, the above effect was not related to the toxicity of LPS and AS on cell activity ( Figure S1a ) (Li et al., 2008) . Subsequent, the human monocyte cell line THP-1 and THP-1 derived macrophages were employed to confirm whether there is a similar effect in human cells. The identical results in the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and bacterial clearance in THP-1 cells and THP-1 derived macrophages were obtained (Figure 2f, g) . These results were consistent with the findings in vivo, demonstrating that AS might reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression through enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance by macrophages.\n\nTo further investigate the molecular mechanism of AS, interacted candidates of AS were predicted. Firstly, the top 20 candidates (Figure 3a) were preliminarily screened using RT-PCR. Among them, the most significant and stable change was observed in the mRNA .

A VDR siRNA and a lentiviral vector harboring an RNAi sequence against VDR were transfected into RAW264.7 cells to knock down VDR expression (VDR-KD cells) ( Figure S2a) . The results showed that knock-down of VDR would lead to a loss of LPS tolerance phenotype, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 3d) . A lentiviral vector harboring the VDR gene was transfected into RAW264.7 cells to overexpress the VDR (VDR-OE cells) ( Figure S2b ). The results showed that AS-promoting TNF-\u03b1 level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpressing VDR (Figure 3e ). These findings indicated VDR might be an essential and key molecule in LPS tolerance formation and could be further considered as an interacted candidate of AS.\n\nThirdly, to further verify the interaction between AS and VDR, an indirect competitive binding assay using AS labeled with fluorophore was carried out (Figure 3f1) . The results showed pre-incubation of V D3 decreased the AS-related fluorescence intensity significantly ( Figure 3f2 ), suggesting that V D3 firstly occupied the receptor and then decreased the interaction between AS and VDR.\n\nLastly, based on V D3 is a natural agonist of VDR and there are a very high affinity between them (Haussler, Jurutka, Mizwicki & Norman, 2011) , the effect of AS on TNF-\u03b1 level was investigated in presence and in absence of V D3 to validate the above findings. The results showed, in the absence of V D3 , TNF-\u03b1 level decreased and AS-promoting TNF-\u03b1 release in LPS tolerance cells. However, when pro-incubated with V D3 , the effect that .

These results strongly indicate that AS may bind to the same receptor or even similar sites as V D3 .\n\nTaken together, all the aforementioned findings demonstrated that AS might interacted with VDR, subsequently inhibiting its biological function of VDR. Therefore, we considered that AS might interact with VDR as an antagonist and then reversed LPS tolerance state.\n\nVDR is a nuclear receptor that mediates most biological functions of V D3 ; it can translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of downstream target genes such as ATG16L1 via binding to their promotors , and then regulating the V D3 -mediated regulation of autophagy and antibacterial effects (Sun, 2016) . Therefore, nuclear translocation of VDR and its subsequent effect on target gene ATG16L1 was investigated firstly. The immunoblotting and immunostaining results showed that VDR protein level dramatically increased in the nucleus of LPS tolerance cells compared with LPS cells, which could be reversed by AS (Figure 4a, b) . Secondly, a ChIP assay results showed that AS induced binding of VDR to the promoter of ATG16L1 as analyzed by semiquantitative PCR and RT-PCR in LPS tolerance cells (Figure 4c, d) . Together, these data showed that AS's effect is closely related to the transcriptional regulation of VDR on ATG16L1. Thirdly, the immunoblotting results indicated that the protein level of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells obviously decreased compared with LPS cells, but AS increased its .

Additionally, our results demonstrated that the protein level of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells markedly increased in VDR-KD group compared with Ctrl-KD group, and the effect of AS was diminished (Figure 4f ). However, AS-increasing ATG16L1 level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpression of VDR ( Figure 4g ). All the aforementioned findings indicated AS inhibits the function of VDR via preventing the nuclear translocation of VDR, thus influences the transcription of its target genes ATG16L1.\n\nAutophagy is an important self-protection mechanism required for bacterial clearance and inflammation (Gutierrez, Master, Singh, Taylor, Colombo & Deretic, 2004; Levine, Mizushima & Virgin, 2011) .

Firstly, to confirm the function of ATG16L1, cells were treated with ATG16L1 siRNA ( Figure S3a ). The results showed that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in LPS cells decreased and AS promoting TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in LPS tolerance cells were eliminated in ATG16L1 siRNA infected group relative to negative control (Figure 5a, S2a) . It suggests that ATG16L1 is associated with inflammatory cytokine release in LPS tolerance cells and AS's effects.\n\nSecondly, three autophagy inhibitors: 3-methyladenine (3-MA) targeting Vps34; bafilomycin A1 (Baf) blocking autophagosome and lysosome fusion; and LY294002 targeting Vps34 (also known as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3) were .

The results showed that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in LPS cells decreased and AS-promoting TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in LPS tolerance cells were significantly eliminated when pro-incubated with Baf ( Figure 5b ) and 3-MA (Figure 5c) . Furthermore, our results demonstrated that AS markedly declined the bacteria loads in LPS tolerance cells challenged with PA and this effect could be abrogated when pro-incubated with 3-MA, LY294002 or Baf (Figure 5d) . These results indicated a potential correlation between autophagy and AS's effect.\n\nThe above results showed that autophagy contributes to AS's effect. Thirdly, the influence of AS on autophagy-related molecules was further investigated herein. The markers such as the conversion of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B-I) (18 kDa) to LC3B-II (16 kDa) and the accumulation of ATG5 were selected to evaluated autophagy activity (Schaaf, Keulers, Vooijs & Rouschop, 2016) . The results showed that LPS treatment increased LC3B-II and ATG5 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5e1) , consistent with the results that LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines release in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2a ). This further indicated that LPS-induced cytokine release is autophagy involved.\n\nImmunoblotting showed that accumulation LC3B-II and ATG5 levels changed with time in LPS tolerance cells and peaked at 1 h ( Figure 5e2) . Therefore, 1 h was selected as the best time point to observe LPS-induced autophagic activities.\n\nFourthly, immunofluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and\n\nimmunoblotting results revealed that autophagy activities remarkably decreased in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which could be reversed by AS treatment (Figure S3b, 5f and 5g) at 1 h after the last LPS treatment. These results indicated that autophagy decline is . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 tightly involved in LPS tolerance phenotype and AS treatment potentiated autophagic activities.\n\nLastly, in LPS tolerance cells, LC3B-II and ATG5 level markedly increased when knocking down VDR compared with negative control, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 5h ). AS-promoting LC3B-II and ATG5 level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpressing VDR (Figure 5i ). All the aforementioned findings indicated that AS's effect is autophagy-dependent through VDR in vitro.\n\nNF-\u03baB is an important nuclear transcription factor, and regulates many pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription, both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, are its target genes (Bonizzi & Karin, 2004) .\n\nVDR physically interacts with NF-\u03baB p65 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and intestinal cells (Sun et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010) , but it remains unclear that the functional relevance of this VDR/NF-\u03baB p65 interaction in LPS tolerance macrophages. Herein, co-IP and fluorescent co-localization experiments were performed. The results showed that the associated NF-\u03baB p65 level in cytoplasm protein had no significant change in the medium cells, LPS cells and LPS tolerance cells when an equal amount of VDR was used as a control (pull-down by VDR), but significantly decreased by AS treatment (Figure 6a1 ). However, AS had no effect on the nucleus protein of the associated NF-\u03baB p65 in each treatment when an equal amount of VDR was used as a control (pull-down by VDR) (Figure 6a2 ). These results suggested that AS might bind VDR to interrupt the interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in cytoplasm, further implied that AS might affect the activity of NF-\u03baB p65.\n\n.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 Subsequently, immunostaining was used to determine whether AS affected their intracellular co-localization and distribution of VDR and NF-\u03baB p65. The results revealed an obvious co-localization of VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in LPS tolerance cells, but AS significantly inhibited their co-localization (Figure 6b1, b2) . Moreover, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 markedly declined in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which was reversed by AS treatment (Figure 61, b3) . These results indicated that high level of VDR intensively interacted with NF-\u03baB p65, preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Noteworthily, AS inhibited the physical interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65, accelerating the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. To confirm it, the nuclear protein level of NF-\u03baB p65 was investigated using ELISA and immunoblotting. The results showed NF-\u03baB p65 level in nucleus obviously reduced in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which was reversed by AS (Figure 6c1, c2) . In LPS tolerance cells, the nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 level increased in VDR-KD group compared with negative control, leading to the loss of tolerance phenotype ( Figure 6d1 ). In VDR-OE cells, the NF-\u03baB p65 nucleoprotein level remarkably suppressed compared to negative control, and AS treatment made no difference in LPS tolerance cells ( Figure 6d2 ). To determine whether AS-promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines releases in LPS tolerance cells is related to its influence on NF-\u03baB p65 activity, NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RAW264.7 was modified ( Figure S4a, b) . The results showed that knock-down of NF-\u03baB p65 would lead to the decline in pro-inflammatory cytokines release, and loss of AS's effect ( Figure 6e1) . Simultaneously, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 would lead to loss of LPS tolerance phenotype, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 6e2 ). All the aforementioned findings indicated AS inhibited physically interacts between VDR and . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The results showed that the levels of VDR mRNA and protein expression significantly increased in PMs of CLP mice, but were markedly inhibited by AS (Figure 7a) , which was consistent with in vitro results. In VDR-KD CLP mice which VDR expression was knocked down using a lentiviral vector harboring a VDR RNAi sequence (VDR-KD) ( Figure S5a, b) , the level of TNF-\u03b1 in spleen and lungs was significantly increased compare with negative control, and AS administration made no difference (Figure 7b ). It suggested that VDR overexpression is involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression formulation, and knocking down of VDR would lead to loss of immunosuppressing phenotype. Additionally, immunoblotting results showed that autophagy-associated proteins in the spleen of CLP mice were increased compare with negative control, and AS made no difference (Figure 7c ). Taken together, both the in vivo and in vitro results indicate that the VDR plays an important role in sepsis-induced immunosuppression and AS's effect.\n\n.

Together with our previous results (Kuang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2008) , AS is discovered to not only inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine release during hyper-inflammation stage but also enhance pro-inflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance by macrophages to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating that AS exhibits an immunoregulating effect for sepsis treatment, which is not reported previously.\n\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (Singer et al., 2016) . In the last decade, reversing sepsis-induced immunosuppression becomes the focus of sepsis research instead of targeting cytokine storm (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Kox, Volk, Kox & Volk, 2000; Prucha, Zazula & Russwurm, 2017) . However, drugs in current clinical trials, such as IL-7, anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, probably only for the immunosuppression stage of sepsis (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Prucha, Zazula & Russwurm, 2017) , and its clinical efficacy is yet to be proven.\n\nClinical investigations have consistently shown a close correlation between Vitamin D deficiency in serum and excess mortality and morbidity, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is tightly related to sepsis (Dickerson et al., 2016) . There are conflicting results from various studies on whether Vitamin D supplementation improves the outcome of patients with sepsis (Kearns, Alvarez, Seidel & Tangpricha, 2015; Putzu et al., 2017) . Clinical investigation on the outcome of sepsis patients accepted with Vitamin D supplementation is required in the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 future. Considering the extensive biological effects of Vitamin D, as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis in organisms, it is necessary to maintain the physiological concentration of Vitamin D. Based on our results, we consider that low level of Vitamin D might lead to the insufficiency of anti-inflammation response in human body, but excessive Vitamin D might induce the high level of VDR expression; however, the excessive overexpression of VDR might lead to a decreased immune function. Thus, Vitamin D supplementation is necessary in the diet but excessive intake of Vitamin D might be no benefit. Therefore, we consider that an ideal immunotherapy for sepsis is not only to exert an anti-inflammatory effect during the cytokine storm stage, but also increase the resistance to infection during the immunosuppression stage. The therapeutic effects of AS on cytokine storm stage of sepsis and its mechanism has been proved in our previous studies (Kuang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008) . Herein, we revealed that AS possessed therapeutic effects in sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro, too.\n\nVDR belongs to a nuclear family receptor. Active VDR binds preferentially as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to hexameric repeats on vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in the promoter regions of target genes (Haussler et al., 1998; Orlov, Rochel, Moras & Klaholz, 2012) . As with other nuclear receptors, the nuclear translocation of RXR/VDR heterodimer functions to recruit additional cofactors that play an essential role in transcription (Haussler et al., 1998) . Herein, VDR was firstly predicted to be an interacted molecule candidate of AS by TCMSP, and then identified using PCR and WB. Moreover, we found that VDR was highly expressed and the nuclear translocation of VDR strikingly increased in LPS tolerance cells (mimic immunosuppression stage of sepsis) compared with .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 LPS cells (mimic cytokines storm stage), while AS treatment could markedly inhibit the high expression and the nuclear translocation of VDR. Furthermore, the interaction between AS and VDR was confirmed in the binding assay established in our lab. These results demonstrated that AS might interact with VDR to affect its activation, leading to a decline of VDR nuclear translocation. Thus, the effects of AS were investigated in presence and in absence of V D3 , which is the natural ligand of VDR. Our results showed AS's effect was eliminated when pro-incubated with V D3 , indicating that there is antagonism between V D3 and AS. These results strikingly suggest that AS might bind to the same receptor or even similar sites as V D3 .\n\nAlthough the anti-inflammation or immunosuppressive effect of V D3 is reported to be tightly related to the function of VDR (Alroy, Towers & Freedman, 1995; Joshi et al., 2011; Lemire, Adams, Kermani-Arab, Bakke, Sakai & Jordan, 1985) , few studies have directly addressed the role of VDR in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Based on our results, we speculated that the excessive high level of VDR during the immunosuppression stage of sepsis might be related to the decreased inflammatory response. While AS could increase the survival rate of sepsis animals via its inhibition on high expression of VDR.\n\nAutophagy is a fundamental cellular process involved in defensive against infection by eliminating intracellular pathogens and regulating inflammation (Casanova, 2017) , and autophagy has been considered a new target in sepsis treatment (Ren, Zhang, Wu & Yao, 2017) . Herein, combined with our previous study (Kuang et al., 2018) , we considered that autophagy was enhanced in the early sepsis stage (cytokine storm stage), but suppressed in the later sepsis stage (immunosuppression stage). Our results also showed AS could enhance . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

VDR transcriptionally regulates ATG16L1, which is a target gene and an important autophagy-related protein molecule. If VDR is reduced, ATG16L1 is also reduced associated with abnormal Paneth cells for development of chronic states of mucosal inflammation (Sun, 2016) . However, our findings showed that high binding between VDR and ATG16L1 promotor lead to a low protein level of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells, demonstrating VDR negatively regulated the transcription of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells.\n\nBased on that our results showed AS could inhibit VDR expression to up-regulate the transcription of ATG16L1 and increase autophagy activity, we considered that the discrepancy for the transcriptional regulation between VDR and ATG16L1 might be due to the differences in the inflammation and immune status. However, the mechanism needs further investigation in the future.\n\nNF-\u03baB is a vital transcription factor, and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway links pathogenic signals and cellular danger signals, thus organizing cellular resistance to invading pathogens, which is a network hub responsible for complex biological signaling (Albensi & Mattson, 2000; Kaltschmidt & Kaltschmidt, 2009 ). NF-\u03baB p65 was reported to physically interact with VDR in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and intestinal cells (Sun et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010) . Our previous studies have shown that AS could significantly inhibit LPS-induced . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Herein, we focused on its function in sepsis immunosuppression stage, and discovered that NF-\u03baB p65 was negatively regulated by VDR due to the physical interaction between them in macrophages. Importantly, AS prevented the interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in LPS-tolerance cells, leading to a marked increase in nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 translocation and expressions of downstream target genes such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Furthermore, we found that AS decreased the binding between VDR and the promoter region of ATG16L1, leading to a decline in nuclear translocation of VDR and decreasing the negative transcription of ATG16L1, and lastly AS enhanced autophagy activities through binding VDR. Furthermore, knocking down VDR expression reversed the autophagy related proteins levels in immunosuppression stage, and over expressing VDR resulting in a failure of AS-promoting the autophagy related proteins levels. Thus, we concluded that AS interacted with VDR to reverse immunosuppression stage was autophagy involved. Taken together, we think AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR and also inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65, enhancing autophagy and activating the transcription of NF-\u03baB p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nAs we know, VDR is the receptor to recognize and bind V D3 . Will V D3 control VDR to achieve anti-sepsis effect? Although clinical investigation have shown a close correlation between Vitamin D deficiency in serum and excess morbidity and mortality of sepsis, suggesting vitamin D deficiency is closely related to sepsis (Dickerson et al., 2016) , it .

Considering the extensive biological effects of Vitamin D, as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis in organisms, it is necessary and important to maintain the physiological concentration of Vitamin D. Noteworthy, excessive vitamin D supplementation may be harmful rather than beneficial based on our results that excessive Vitamin D might induce the high level of VDR expression, which might lead to decreased immune function.\n\nTill now, the outcome of therapeutic regime only aiming at a single stage of sepsis is disappointing and even worse. It might due to that the treatment time window is important for the therapeutic regimen of sepsis, but difficult to grasp. Giving anti-inflammatory drugs in hypo-inflammatory stage or pro-inflammatory therapy in hyper-inflammatory stage lead to failures even increasing mortalities in clinic (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Rudick, Cornell & Agrawal, 2017) . Therefore, we considered that an immunoregulator might be an ideal drug for sepsis without limitation of treatment time window. Our results demonstrated that AS might be an immunoregulator for both hyper-and hypo-inflammatory stage of sepsis based on previous and current results.\n\nMechanically, AS exerts its \"pro-inflammatory\" effect in immunosuppression stage in contrast to its \"anti-inflammatory\" effect in cytokines storm stage. Our present results outline the mechanism of AS's effect through two ways (presented in Figure 8 ): AS interacted with VDR to prevent the nuclear translocation of VDR and then decreases its negative regulation of autophagy related target genes such as ATG16L1, and then increases autophagy activity.\n\nAdditionally, AS interacted with VDR to prevent the interaction between VDR and NF-\u03baB .

Above two ways lead to an increase in the bacteria clearance and the pro-inflammatory cytokine releases of macrophages.\n\nAlthough monocytes/macrophages system plays a vital role in sepsis, the acquired immune system is equally important, and the effect of AS on T and B cells function remains to be investigated in the future. However, given the therapeutic effect of AS on CLP animal models, we firmly believe that AS will improve the function of T and B cells. VDR is an interaction molecule of AS, whether VDR is a drug target of AS remains to be further studied in the future. Overall, our findings provide an evidence that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-\u03baB dependent way, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of AS in the future.\n\n.
