{"title": "An ultralong CDRH2 in HCV neutralizing antibody demonstrates structural plasticity of antibodies against E2 glycoprotein", "body": "HCV infections are on the rise in the United States, reflecting increasing rates of opioid addiction (Zibbell et al., 2018) . An HCV vaccine is urgently needed to control the epidemic, but vaccine development is challenging due to the enormous genetic diversity of the HCV envelope proteins (Yusim et al., 2010) . The HCV genome encodes two structural proteins, E1 and E2, that associate to form a noncovalent heterodimer, E1E2 (Freedman et al., 2016) . Potent bNAbs isolated from HCVinfected individuals predominantly target conserved epitopes in the front layer of the E2 glycoprotein. The majority of bNAbs that bind to the front layer are derived from VH1-69 genes , which are also associated with bNAbs that target conserved epitopes on influenza virus and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Chen et al., 2019) .\n\nWe recently described crystal structures of two VH1-69 bNAbs, HEPC3 and HEPC74, isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared HCV infection (Flyak et al., 2018) . Both bNAbs utilized a disulfide motif in their CDRH3 regions to recognize a conserved epitope in the front layer of E2. While the HEPC3 and HEPC74 CDRH3 loops adopted a straight \u00df-hairpin conformation, the VH1-69-encoded AR3A and AR3C bNAbs that were isolated from an individual with a chronic HCV infection included bent CDRH3 loops that contained an analogous disulfide motif (Kong et al., 2013) . Since the two bNAbs with straight CDRH3s were isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared HCV infection and the two bNAbs with bent CDRH3s were isolated from a single chronically-infected individual, we wondered if some individuals are naturally predisposed to make antibodies with straight or bent CDRH3s and/or whether the straight CDRH3 conformation was related to the ability to clear HCV infection. Among bNAbs isolated from a chronically-infected individual (Law et al., 2008) , we found AR3X, a VH1-69-encoded antibody that included a CDRH3 with a disulfide motif and an unusually long 14-amino acid-long insertion in CDRH2 ( Figure 1A) . AR3X provided an opportunity to explore the structural plasticity of VH1-69-derived anti-HCV bNAbs with a disulfide-containing CDRH3 and to determine the impact of a long CDRH2 insertion on the recognition of the conserved epitope in E2 front layer.\n\nThe most likely scenario resulting in the insertion into the CDRH2 of AR3X involves a duplication event, as the CDRH2 insertion has 69% identity with the N-terminal sequence preceding the CDRH2 ( Figure 1B ). Similar to other front layer-specific bNAbs with the CDRH3 disulfide motif ( Figure 1E ), the cysteines in the AR3X CDRH3 region are encoded by the human D gene segment 15 (IGHD2-15) ( Figure 1C ). The C-terminal portion of the AR3X CDRH3 is likely encoded by human J-gene segment 3*02 (J3*02). Not including the 14-amino acid insertion in CDRH2, AR3X shares 91% nucleotide Figure 1 . AR3X includes a 14-residue insertion in CDRH2. (a) Sequence alignment of a portion of the heavy chain variable region gene sequences of AR3X and the AR3X germline precursor (AR3Xrua) (uppercase letters) and the VH1-69 gene segment (lowercase letters). The CDRH2 insertion is indicated by a dark gray box with the position of the potential duplication site indicated by a light gray box.

(d) Amino acid sequence alignment of the heavy chain variable region sequences of AR3X, AR3X DINS (AR3X without insertion), AR3Xrua (germline precursor of AR3X), and AR3Xrua + INS (germline precursor of AR3X with insertion). CDR loops were defined based on Kabat nomenclature and colored purple (CDRH1), orange (CDRH2), and blue (CDRH3), with the CDRH2 insertion highlighted in bold. Dots indicate identical amino acids and dashes indicate gaps. (e) Alignment of AR3X, AR3A, AR3C, HEPC3, and HEPC74 CDRH3 sequences. The AR3X sequence is highlighted in red and the two cysteines in each CDRH3 are underscored. identity with the V H 1-69 gene segment and includes 17 somatic mutations ( Figure 1D ). To investigate the importance of the CDRH2 insertion and the effects of somatic mutations on AR3X binding and neutralization, we generated a panel of AR3X variants: AR3X DINS (AR3X without the CDRH2 insertion), AR3Xrua (germline precursor of AR3X, which lacks the CDRH2 insertion and somatic mutations), and AR3Xrua + INS (germline precursor of AR3X with the CDRH2 insertion) ( Figure 1D) .\n\nWe evaluated the binding of AR3X and AR3X variants to a panel of E2 ectodomain (E2ecto) proteins representing the E2 envelopes from 19 HCV genotype 1 strains. We also tested the binding of AR3X and AR3X variants to E2ecto proteins from genotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 strains. AR3X recognized all 19 E2 envelopes from genotype 1 including the 1a116 strain, which was not recognized by other front layer-specific bNAbs that include the CDRH3 disulfide motif ( Flyak et al., 2018) . AR3X also recognized E2 envelopes from genotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 ( Figure 2A) . In contrast to mature AR3X, the AR3X DINS protein that lacks the CDRH2 insertion bound only 4 of the 25 variants, indicating that the CDRH2 insertion mediates the breath of binding. While AR3Xrua failed to bind any E2ecto proteins, AR3Xrua + INS recognized 1 of the 25 variants, further highlighting the importance of the CDRH2 insertion in initial recognition of the E2 antigen by na\u00efve B cells. The fact that AR3Xrua + INS only bound to one HCV strain, whereas mature AR3X recognized all strains, indicated that somatic mutations, in addition to the CDRH2 insertion, are required for breath of binding and optimal E2 recognition. Consistent with our previous studies in which the strain 1a157 E2ecto envelope was recognized by HEPC3, HEPC74, AR3C and their germline precursors (Flyak et al., 2018) , AR3X and two AR3X variants (AR3X DINS, AR3Xrua + INS) also bound to 1a157, suggesting that immunogens based on the genotype 1 1a157 ectodomain sequence could be used to stimulate the development of potent front layer-specific bNAbs ( Figure 2A , Figure 2-figure supplement 1) .\n\nTo evaluate the neutralization breadth of AR3X variants, we evaluated antibodies in an in vitro neutralization assay using a panel of 19 genotype 1 HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) that represents 94% of the amino acid polymorphisms present at >5% frequency in a reference panel of 643 genotype 1 HCV isolates from GenBank (Munshaw et al., 2012) . Only mature AR3X exhibited neutralization activity, neutralizing 17 of 19 HCV strains ( Figure 2B, Figure 2-figure supplement 2) . The neutralization breadth of AR3X (89%) was slightly lower than the breath of AR3C bNAb (100%) (Flyak et al., 2018) , which was isolated from the same HCV-infected individual (Law et al., 2008) . AR3X variants failed to neutralize HCV isolates, suggesting that both the CDRH2 insertion and somatic mutations are required for the broad neutralization activity of AR3X.\n\nWe and others described two classes of VH1-69 bNAbs with a CDRH3 disulfide motif: bNAbs with a straight CDRH3 (HEPC3 and HEPC74) and bNAbs with a kinked CDRH3 (AR3A and AR3C) (Flyak et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2019; Figure 3) . To determine to which class AR3X belongs, we determined the crystal structure of AR3X in complex with E2ecto from the 1b09 HCV strain (Figure 4, Figure 4 -figure supplement 1). The 2.2 \u00c5 AR3X-E2ecto structure demonstrated that, similar to previously-characterized HCV bNAbs that recognize the neutralizing face of E2 (Flyak et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2019) , AR3X binds to the conserved epitope in the E2 front layer ( Figure 4A ). The AR3X CDRH3 loop contains two cysteines that form a disulfide bond, as seen in multiple other E2 front layer-binding bNAbs, and the AR3X CDRH3 adopts the straight conformation we previously described in the HEPC3 and HEPC74 bNAbs that were isolated from an individual who cleared HCV infection (Flyak et al., 2018 ; Figure 3 ). By contrast, the CDRH3s of AR3A and AR3C, which were isolated from the same HCV-infected individual as AR3X (Law et al., 2008) , are bent (Kong et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2019) . The tip of the AR3X CDRH3 loop interacts with the same conserved residues in the front layer of E2 as the CDRH3 tips in the other HCV bNAbs (Figure 4e, Figure 4-figure supplement 2) .\n\nOverall, AR3X has a similar binding footprint to the footprints of HEPC3, HEPC74, AR3C, and AR3A, sharing multiple contact residues in the front layer and CD81 receptor-binding loop (Figure 4-figure supplement 2) . As also found for these other front layer-specific bNAbs, AR3X's contacts with E2ecto almost exclusively involved V H domain residues, burying 1,250 \u00c5 2 (98% of the total Fab buried surface area; BSA) ( Figure 4B) , with the CDRH3 accounting for 44.5% (556 \u00c5 2 ) of the total BSA on the V H domain ( Figure 4B, Figure 4-figure supplement 2) . However, in contrast to other front layer-specific bNAbs in which the CDRH3 plays a dominant role in the interactions with E2 envelope (Flyak et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2019) , the main contributor to the AR3X-E2ecto binding interface was CDRH2, which accounted for 48.2% (602 \u00c5 2 ) of the total BSA of the V H domain, with the majority of the binding footprint provided by the CDRH2 insertion (45.4% or 567 \u00c5 2 of total BSA of the V H domain) ( Figure 4C) .\n\nWe next investigated the frequency of antibodies with 14-residue CDRH2 insertions. While the size of an insertion or deletion in human antibody genes ranges from 3 to 33 nucleotides (Kanyavuz et al., 2019) , AR3X has a unusually long 42-nucleotide insertion, which results in a 31-residue CDRH2 (Kabat definition: [Kabat and National Institutes of Health (U.S.) . Office of the Director, 1991] ). According to the abYsis database (Swindells et al., 2017) , a typical human CDRH2 is 17 residues (relative frequency 67%) ( Figure 4D) , and CDRH2s longer than 20 residues are rare (relative frequency <1%). To our knowledge, AR3X with its 31-residue CDRH2 represents the longest CDRH2 among antibody structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\nAlthough the CDH3s of AR3X, AR3A, AR3C, HEPC3, and HEPC74 CDRH3s make similar binding footprints on the E2 surface ( Figure 5) , the difference in Fab approach angles and the presence of the long insertion in the AR3X CDRH2 result in different footprints on E2 for the V H 1-69-encoded CDRH2 loops of the bNAbs: AR3X CDRH2 contacts the C-terminus of the E2 a1-helix, the portion of the E2 front layer between the a-helix, variable region 2 (residues 446-448), and the back layer of E2 (residues 444, 445) ( Figure 4F and Figure 4-figure supplement 2) . In contrast, the AR3A and AR3C CDRH2 contacts are reduced to hydrophobic residues in a1-helix (Kong et al., 2013) , whereas the HEPC3 and HEPC74 CDRH2s contact the E2 a1-helix and the portion of the E2 front layer between the a1-helix and variable region 2 (residues 446-448) (Flyak et al., 2018) .\n\nA feature of VH1-69-derived antibodies is the presence of two hydrophobic residues at the tip of the CDRH2 loop that facilitate interactions with hydrophobic epitopes. The CDRH2s of AR3A and AR3C contain an Ile/Val-Pro-Met/Leu-Phe motif in which hydrophobic residues interact with the E2 front layer and CD81 binding loop (Chen et al., 2019) . The CDRH2s of HEPC3 and HEPC74 are less hydrophobic and contain a Thr/Ser-Pro-Ile-Phe/Ser motif (Chen et al., 2019) . In addition to hydrophobic interactions with the E2 front layer, the HEPC3 CDRH2 also makes a single hydrogen bond with E2 (Flyak et al., 2018) . By contrast, AR3X is a not a typical VH1-69 antibody in which hydrophobic residues in CDRH2 mediate the binding to hydrophobic residues in E2 (Chen et al., 2019) . Instead, the AR3X CDRH2 forms eight hydrogen bonds with the E2 glycoprotein, four of which are mediated by AR3X residue Arg52g (AR3X-E2ecto: Pro52c-His445, Pro52e-Thr444, Arg52g-Ala440, Arg52g-Phe442, Arg52g-Tyr443, Arg52g-Pro612, Asn52n-Tyr443, Trp52i-Tyr613) ( Figure 4F, Figure 4-figure supplement 2) . Notably, these differences in binding interactions have functional implications, as these mAbs differ in potency of neutralization of individual HCV strains in the HCVpp panel. For example, the AR3X neutralization IC 50 for strain 1b21 is~17 fold lower than the IC 50 of HEPC3 (1.2 vs. 20.5 mg/mL). In contrast, the AR3X neutralization IC 50 for strain 1a142 is~9 fold higher than the IC 50 of HEPC3 (16.2 vs. 1.9 mg/mL) (Figure 2 ; Flyak et al., 2018) .\n\nA signature feature of the AR3A/AR3C and HEPC3/HEPC74 types of HCV bNAbs is the long CDRH3 that forms multiple main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds with E2 front layer residues (Flyak et al., 2018; Tzarum et al., 2019) . Similar to other front layer-specific bNAbs with a CDRH3 disulfide motif, the first cysteine residue of the AR3X CDRH3 (Cys100a) hydrogen bonds with E2 residue Cys429 ( Figure 4G loop residue (Glu531), further stabilize the interaction of AR3X with E2. The AR3X-E2ecto crystal structure also shows contacts between the AR3X CDRH3 and N-glycans attached to E2 residues Asn423 and Asn430 ( Figure 4G ).\n\nWe and others previously described HCV bNAbs that utilize the VH1-69 gene segment and a germline-encoded disulfide motif in CDRH3 to recognize the conserved epitope in E2 front layer (Flyak et al., 2018; Keck et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2019) . Here we structurally characterized a front layer-specific HCV bNAb that is encoded by the VH1-69 gene that includes an ultralong insertion in CDRH2 as well as the disulfide motif in CDRH3. We found that AR3X, isolated from the same chronically-infected patient as AR3A or AR3C (Law et al., 2008) , surprisingly exhibits the straight CDRH3 conformation found in the HEPC3 or HEPC74 bNAbs isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared HCV infection (Figure 3) . This indicates that a single individual can produce potent HCV-specific bNAbs using the common VH1-69 and D2-15 genes that bind to the conserved region of E2 in at least three different configurations (straight CDRH3 with CDRH2 insertion, straight CDRH3 without CDRH2 insertion, or bent CDRH3 without CDRH2 insertion), highlighting the intrinsic plasticity of the VH1-69-encoded CDRH1 and CDRH2 loops that accommodate different antibody approach angles ( Figure 5 ). It's likely that the CDRH3s of these bNAbs dictate the preferential mode of engagement of bNAb germline precursors with the conserved epitope in the E2 front layer. Overall, these data demonstrate that B cells using VH1-69 and D2-15 genes can follow multiple pathways of affinity maturation to achieve broad neutralizing activity.\n\nIn the four bNAbs that were previously characterized structurally (Flyak et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2019) , the first cysteine residue of the CDRH3 hydrogen bonds with E2 residue Cys429 ( Figure 4G, Figure 4-figure supplement 2) . We hypothesize that after the initial recognition of the front layer by CDRH3, the VH1-69-encoded CDRH1 and CDRH2 further stabilize the interaction while subsequent somatic mutations increase the bNAb affinity and breadth. Other antibodies that utilize a CDRH3 stabilized by a disulfide bond have been also described in the literature (Sui et al., 2009; Thomson et al., 2008; Ying et al., 2015) . For example, M336, a potent human antibody that neutralizes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Ying et al., 2014) , is encoded by the VH1-69 gene segment and includes a germline-encoded disulfide bond in its CDRH3 (Ying et al., 2015) .\n\nNucleotide insertions and deletions play an important role in diversification of the antibody repertoire (de Wildt et al., 1999; Reason and Zhou, 2006; Wilson et al., 1998) . Insertions are produced by sequence duplications; while the average size of insertion varies from 3 to 33 nucleotides, the majority of antibodies contain short insertions (Kanyavuz et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 1998) . AR3X with its 42-nucleotide insertion in CDRH2 represents an interesting case of an antibody that utilizes an ultralong CDRH2 to bind its epitope (Figure 4) . The insertion was required for recognition of E2 glycoproteins across multiple HCV strains, as evidenced by the poor binding activity of AR3X variants lacking the CDRH2 insertion ( Figure 2) . While several neutralizing antibodies with insertions have been described (Kepler et al., 2014; Krause et al., 2011) , AR3X is unique for its exceptionally long CDRH2 insertion, which makes extensive contacts with E2, but does not change the preconfigured mode of AR3X interaction with E2 based on its straight CDRH3 containing a disulfide motif. Thus the conserved epitope in the HCV E2 front layer, which is recognized by multiple human bNAbs containing a disulfide motif in their CDRH3s (Figure 5) , remains a promising target for lineage-based immunogen design. \n\nGenes encoding the V H and V L domains of the AR3X bNAb called antibody 'A' in Supplemental Table 1 in Law et al. (2008) were synthesized as gBlocks gene fragments (IDT) and cloned into pTT5-based expression vectors (NRC Biotechnology Research Institute). Reverted unmutated ancestor (rua) variants of AR3X and the location of the insertion were inferred with IMGT/V-QUEST using complete sequences of heavy and light chain variable domains. IgGs were produced in Expi293F cells (National Research Council of Canada) by co-transfecting appropriate heavy and light chain plasmids. HiTrap Protein A HP column (GE Healthcare) was used to isolate IgGs from filtered culture supernatants followed by purification by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).\n\nFor ELISA experiments, His-tagged E2ecto proteins (residues 384-643) were expressed by transiently transfecting Expi293F cells (National Research Council of Canada) and purified from clarified supernatants using a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) to separate monomeric E2ecto proteins from oligomeric species. For structural studies, the His-tag was removed from an expression vector encoding a strain 1b09 E2 ectodomain.\n\nExpression and purification of an E2-Fab complex AR3X Fab-1b09 E2ecto complexes for structural studies were produced in HEK293-6E or Expi293F cells (National Research Council of Canada) in the presence of 5 mM kifunensine (Sigma) by co-transfecting expression vectors encoding His-tagged Fab and untagged E2ecto to allow isolation of stable Fab-E2 complexes (Flyak et al., 2018) . AR3X-E2 complex was purified from supernatants using Ni-NTA chromatography on HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) followed by SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).\n\nCommercially-available screens (Hampton Research and Molecular Dimensions) were used to screen initial crystallization conditions by vapor diffusion in sitting drops. AR2X-E2ecto crystals were grown using 0.2 mL of protein complex in TBS and 0.2 mL of mother liquor (0.25 M ammonium tartrate dibasic pH 7.0, 20% PEG 3,350) and cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 20% (w/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data from cryopreserved crystals were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 12-2 using a PILATUS 6M detector. Images were processed and scaled using iMosflm (Battye et al., 2011) and Aimless as implemented in the CCP4 software suite (Evans and Murshudov, 2013) . The AR3X-E2 complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the AR3C (PDB 4MWF) and 1b09 HCV E2ecto (PDB 6MEI) structures as search models. The models were refined and validated using Phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010) . Iterative manual model building and corrections were performed using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) . Glycans were initially interpreted and modeled using F o -F c maps calculated with model phases contoured at 2s, followed by 2F o -F c simulated annealing composite omit maps generated in Phenix in which modeled glycans were omitted to remove model bias (Adams et al., 2010) . The quality of the final models was examined using MolProbity . Models were superimposed and figures rendered using the PyMOL molecular visualization system (Version 1.7, Schr\u00f6 dinger, LLC). Buried surface areas (BSAs) were determined using the PDBePISA web-based interactive tool (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) . Potential hydrogen bonds were assigned using criteria of a distance of <4.0 \u00c5 and an A-D-H angle of >90\u02da, and the maximum distance allowed for a van der Waals interaction was 4.0 \u00c5 . Rmsd calculations were done in PyMOL following pairwise Ca alignments without excluding outliers. AR3X residues were numbered according to the Kabat numbering scheme, and Kabat definitions of CDRs were used throughout the paper (Kabat and National Institutes of Health (U.S.). Office of the Director, 1991) . Values to show the length distribution of CDRH2 in humans were extracted from the online abYsis system (http://www. bioinf.org.uk/abysis/) using the Kabat numbering scheme.\n\nSoluble forms of full-length E2 ectodomains were coated overnight onto 96-well plates (Corning) at 1 mg/mL. Plates were blocked with 1% goat serum and 1% powdered milk in TBST buffer (TBS with 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 hr. Purified IgGs were assayed in duplicate at 4-fold serial dilutions, starting at 10 mg/mL. IgGs-E2ecto complexes were detected using goat anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Southern Biotech, 1:4000 dilution) and 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reading the optical density read at 450 nm after stopping the reaction with 1M HCl. A non-linear regression analysis was performed on the resulting curves using Prism version 5 (GraphPad) to calculate EC 50 values.\n\nHCVpp were produced by lipofectamine-mediated transfection of HCV E1E2 and pNL4-3.Luc.R-Eplasmids into HEK293T cells as described (Hsu et al., 2003; Logvinoff et al., 2004) . A panel of 19 heterologous genotype 1 HCVpp has been described previously (Bailey et al., 2015; Osburn et al., 2014) . Neutralization assays were performed as described (Dowd et al., 2009) . Briefly, IgGs were serially diluted five-fold, starting at a concentration at 100 mg/ml and incubated with HCVpp for one hour prior to addition to Hep3B hepatoma cells. Luciferase activity was measured after three days and compared to that of HCVpp in media alone."}
