{"title": "A recombinant nucleocapsid protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay to detect antibodies against porcine deltacoronavirus", "body": "Antibody: Antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), swine\ntransmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine group A rotavirus (pGARV), classical\nswine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV),\nand porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were kindly provided by the\nDivision of Swine Infectious Diseases, National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology,\nHarbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.\nMonoclonal antibodies against histidine (His) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags were\nobtained from Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).\n\nSynthesis and expression of the PDCoV N gene: The nucleotide sequence of\nthe entire N gene of PDCoV was obtained from the GenBank database at the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information website (accession no. JQ065043). The nucleotide sequence of the\nPDCoV N gene containing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 BamHI and XhoI\nrestriction sites, respectively, was synthesized based on the codon usage bias of\nEscherichia coli. The synthesized PDCoV N gene was cloned into the\nprokaryotic expression vectors pET-32a and pGEX-6P-1 so that it was tagged with His and GST,\nrespectively. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)\ncells, and then, N gene expression was induced using 1.0 mM/l isopropyl\n\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside at 37\u00b0C for 4 hr. Protein expression was analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Moreover, recombinant N proteins were\npurified according to the method described by Zhu et al. [24]. The recombinant N proteins of PDCoV were named\nrPDCoV-N.\n\nWestern blotting of the rPDCoV-N protein: Purified rPDCoV-N proteins with\nHis or GST-tags were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC)\nmembrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). The NC\nmembrane was blocked using 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at\n37\u00b0C for 1 hr and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the His-tag\n(1:1,000 dilution in PBS) or a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the GST-tag (1:1,000\ndilution in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After washing three times with PBS, the membrane was\nincubated in PBS containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG\n(1:5,000 dilution) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05%\nTween 20 (PBST), the membrane was incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence detection\nreagents (Biotopped, Beijing, China) at room temperature for 3 min, and peroxidase-mediated\nluminescence was digitally captured using the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ System\n(Bio-Rad) and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).\n\nScreening of PDCoV-positive and PDCoV-negative sera: To collect\nPDCoV-negative and PDCoV-positive serum samples, the reverse transcription polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect PDCoV in pig farms in Heilongjiang province. Briefly,\nrectal swab samples were collected from sows and piglets in diarrhea-affected and\nnon-affected pig farms in Heilongjiang province from September 2014 to December 2014. Viral\nRNA in each sample was extracted using the TIANamp Virus RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co.,\nLtd.). The cDNA was synthesized by (RNase H-) Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse\ntranscriptase (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. The PCR amplifications were conducted using primers specific for the PDCoV M\ngene (67F, 5\u2032-ATCCTCCAAGGAGGCTATGC-3\u2032 and 560R, 5\u2032-GCGAATTCTGGATCGTTGTT-3\u2032) according to the\nprotocol described by Wang et al. [20]. Moreover, the serum samples, which were collected from PDCoV-positive and\nPDCoV-negative farms, were tested by western blot using rPDCoV-N proteins with His-tag and\nGST-tag, respectively. Briefly, purified rPDCoV-N proteins with a His-tag and GST-tag were\nsubjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, respectively, and then transferred to an NC membrane. After\nblocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, the NC membrane was incubated with pig serum\nsamples (1:200 dilution in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After washing three times with PBS, the\nmembrane was incubated in PBS containing HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-pig IgG (1:5,000\ndilution) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. The peroxidase-mediated luminescence was digitally captured\nusing the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad) and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).\nThe serum sample, which was collected from a PDCoV-positive and diarrhea-affected farm and\ncan recognize purified rPDCoV-N proteins with either a His-tag and GST-tag, was used as a\npositive control in the ELISAs. In addition, a total of 56 serum samples, which were\ncollected from piglets before eating colostra in a PDCoV-negative and diarrhea-unaffected\npig farm and can not recognize purified rPDCoV-N proteins with either a His-tag and GST-tag,\nwere used as negative sera in ELISAs.\n\nrPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures: The conditions of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, including\nthe concentrations of coated antigen, blocking solution, sera and HRP-conjugated rabbit\nanti-pig IgG, as well as their incubation times, were optimized according to the P/N value\n(the OD450 value of the PDCoV-positive serum/the OD450 value of the\nPDCoV-negative serum). The best reaction conditions for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA were as follows.\nELISA plate (Costar, Corning, NY, U.S.A.) wells were coated with 1\n\u00b5g/ml of purified His-tagged rPDCoV-N in 0.05\nmol/l carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4\u00b0C for 12 hr and blocked with 5%\nskimmed milk at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr. After washing four times with PBST, 100 \u00b5l\nof the test antisera, diluted 1:200, was added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr.\nThe plates were washed four times and incubated with 100 \u00b5l of\nHRP-conjugated rabbit anti-pig IgG diluted 1:5,000 in PBST at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After adding\n100 \u00b5l of a 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution and\nincubating at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50\n\u00b5l of 2 M H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was\nmeasured.\n\nDetermination of the cut-off value for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: The 56\nPDCoV-negative serum samples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The reaction conditions\nwere the same as those described for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. Each sample was tested\nthree times, and the mean OD450 value was used for analysis. The result for each\nsample was converted into a percent reactivity (PR) value based on the formula: PR\nvalue=[(the |OD450 value of the tested sample\u2212the OD450 value of the\nnegative control)|/(the OD450 value of the positive control\u2212the OD450\nvalue of the negative control)] \u00d7 100%. The PR cut-off value was determined as the mean PR\nvalue of the 56 PDCoV-negative sera + 2 \u00d7 the standard deviation.\n\nSpecificity test: To evaluate the specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA,\nantisera against PEDV, TGEV, PRoV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV were tested using the\nrPDCoV-N-ELISA. The reaction conditions were the same as those used for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA\nprocedures. The PR value of the test samples was calculated. Each sample was tested three\ntimes, and the mean PR value was used to determine whether the sample was positive or\nnegative.\n\nValidation of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: To evaluate the feasibility of the\nrPDCoV-N-ELISA method, a total of 62 serum samples were randomly selected from six pig farms\nin Heilongjiang Province; 30 serum samples were collected from three diarrhea-free pig\nfarms, and 32 serum samples were collected from three diarrhea-affected farms. These serum\nsamples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. Each sample was tested three times, and the\nmean PR value was used to determine whether samples were positive or negative. Meanwhile, 62\nserum samples were subjected to western blotting using purified, GST-tagged rPDCoV-N. The\nwestern blotting procedure was the same as described above. To evaluate the cut-off value,\nsensitivity and specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, the receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve was generated using the results of the western blotting as the standard for\nnegative and positive determination. The statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS\nsoftware (Version 11.5 for windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.).\n\nDetection of PDCoV in field samples by the PDCoV-N-ELISA: A total of 319\nserum samples were collected from sows in 15 farms in Heilongjiang province from January\n2014 to June 2015, of which 210 serum samples were collected from 9 farms without occurrence\nof diarrhea, and 109 serum samples were collected from 6 farms with occurrence of diarrhea.\nAll serum samples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The reaction conditions were the\nsame as those used for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. In the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, each sample was\ntested three times, and the mean PR value was used to determine whether a sample was\npositive or negative.\n\nExpression, purification and identification of rPDCoV-N: Prokaryotic\nexpression of the synthesized N gene of PDCoV was conducted in the E. coli\nBL21 (DE3) strain using the vectors pET-32a (with a His-tag) and pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag.\nThe results indicated that the recombinant N protein of PDCoV (rPDCoV-N) was successfully\nexpressed in the vectors pET-32a with a His-tag (~56 kDa) (Fig. 1A) and pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag (~64 kDa) (Fig.\n1B). Furthermore, the rPDCoV-N protein was verified using anti-His-tag and anti-GST\nmAbs by western blotting (Fig. 1C).\n\nScreening for PDCoV-positive and PDCoV-negative sera: Screening of\nPDCoV-positive sera was conducted by western blotting using the rPDCoV-N protein with a\nHis-tag and GST-tag as an antigen. The results revealed that one serum sample, named\npZD-166, which was collected from one sow in a PDCoV-positive and diarrhea-affected farm in\nHeilongjiang province, exhibited a specific reaction with His-tagged and GST-tagged rPDCoV-N\nproteins (Fig. 2). The pZD-166 serum sample was used as a positive control when establishing the\nrPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. Moreover, a total of 56 serum samples were collected from\npiglets, prior to eating colostra, in one diarrhea-unaffected farm in the Daqing area of\nHeilongjiang province, which was determined to be PDCoV-negative by RT-PCR (data not shown).\nAll 56 serum samples were used to determine the cut-off value of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, and the\nnSJZ-15 sample was used as a negative control when establishing the rPDCoV-N-ELISA\nprocedures.\n\nCut-off value of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: The 56 PDCoV-negative serum samples\nwere tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA according to previously established ELISA procedures.\nAll test results were converted into the PR value according to the formula described\npreviously (Fig. 3). The PR cut-off value of 48.5 (mean + 2\u00d7 SD, 20.9+27.6) was used as the positive\nstandard in the rPDCoV-N-ELISA.\n\nSpecificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: In specific experiments, antisera\nagainst PEDV, TGEV, pGARV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV were used to test the specificity of\nthe rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The results showed that the rPDCoV-N-ELISA did not cross-react with\nthese antisera (PR value <48.5) (Fig. 4).\n\nValidation of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: To validate the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, a total\nof 62 serum samples were tested by western blotting using purified, GST-tagged rPDCoV-N and\nthe rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The ROC curve indicated that sensitivity and specificity of the\nrPDCoV-N-ELISA were 100% and 90.4%, respectively, when the optimized PR cut-off value was\n48.9; the optimized PR cut-off value generated from the ROC curve was nearly in line with\nthe PR cut-off value of 48.5 determined by negative sera (Fig. 5). Meanwhile, the area under ROC curve (ROC AUC) was 0.962, which further supported\nthe effectiveness of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA (Table\n1).\n\nDetection of PDCoV in field samples using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: A total of\n319 serum samples from 15 pig farms were tested by the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The results indicated\nthat 11.59% of samples (37/319) were positive for antibodies against PDCoV; for the farms\nwithout diarrhea, 3.33% of samples (7/210) were positive for antibodies against PDCoV; for\nthe farms with diarrhea, 27.52% of samples (30/109) were positive for antibodies against\nPDCoV (Table 2).\n\nIn the current study, an indirect ELISA, rPDCoV-N-ELISA, which used recombinant N protein\nthat was expressed from E. coli, was developed to detect antibodies against\nPDCoV. The PDCoV N protein shared 22.2%, 28.2% and 18.4% amino acid identities with PEDV\n(strain CV777, accession no. DQ355221), TGEV (strain H, accession no. EU074218) and porcine\nrespiratory coronavirus (PRCV) N proteins (strain ISU-1, accession no. DQ811787),\nrespectively. Therefore, a cross-reaction between the N protein of the PDCoV and the N\nproteins from TGEV, PEDV and PRCV is unlikely. As expected, the PDCoV N protein did not\ncross-react with TGEV, PEDV, PRCV, PRoV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV in the specificity\nassay. Our results are in line with those of an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on the\nputative S1 portion of the S protein, as described by Thachil et al. [17]. In addition, the N protein exhibited a high degree\nof conservation, 98.8\u2013100% identities, among different PDCoV strains. Ant\u00f3n et\nal. reported that high levels of TGEV-specific antibodies could be induced by a\ncombination of S-rosettes and the N protein [2]. These\nproperties made the N protein suitable as a diagnostic antigen of PDCoV in an indirect\nELISA, which was supported by other coronavirus studies [1, 7, 10, 16].\n\nPorcine deltacoronavirus is an emerging coronavirus; thus, a positive standard serum\nagainst PDCoV was not available in our study. However, positive serum against PDCoV is a key\nfactor needed for the establishment of a rPDCoV-N-ELISA. In our study, to screen for\nPDCoV-positive serum, the PDCoV N gene was expressed using two prokaryotic expression\nvectors with different fusion tags: pGEX-6P-1 with a GST-tag and pET-32a with a His-tag. The\nPDCoV-positive sera from farms were validated when the samples showed a specific reaction\nwith purified His-tagged and GST-tagged rPDCoV-N proteins, thereby eliminating all\nfalse-positive serum samples. Additionally, the PDCoV-negative serum samples were also\nstrictly identified using a combination of the RT-PCR and western blotting using GST-tagged\nrPDCoV-N as an antigen. Moreover, the PR cut-off value of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA was determined\nby using PDCoV-negative serum samples. In our study, the introduction of the PR value to the\nrPDCoV-N-ELISA reduced errors that resulted from different operation conditions, as was\nreported in a similar study [6].\n\nGenerally, a novel ELISA diagnostic method requires validation via a comparison with the\nsame, or a similar, commercial ELISA kit. Although an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on\nthe putative S1 portion of the spike protein has recently been reported by Thachil\net al. [17], no ELISA kit was\navailable for evaluation of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA that was established in our study. To\nevaluate the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, comparison with the western blotting using GST-tagged rPDCoV-N\nas an antigen was carried by analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nCompared with the western blotting, the rPDCoV-N-ELISA exhibited a relative specificity of\n90.4% and a relative sensitivity of 100%. Accumulating reports indicate that the S protein\nhas a high degree of variability in the members of coronaviruses [4, 18]. Therefore, compared with S\nprotein-based ELISAs, the rPDCoV-N-ELISA still has potential application value as a\ndiagnostic antigen, because of the highly conserved nature. The rPDCoV-N-ELISA results of\nfield samples indicated that 11.59% of samples were positive for antibodies against PDCoV.\nIn our study, positive rate of the PDCoV antibodies in samples is similar to that reported\nby Thachil et al. [17]. It is\nsuggested that an extensive serological investigation of the epidemiology of PDCoV in China\nshould be performed in a future study.\n\nIn conclusion, the rPDCoV-N-ELISA has potential use for investigations of the epidemiology\nof PDCoV. Porcine deltacoronavirus has shown a low prevalence in limited serological\ninvestigations in Heilongjiang province, northeast China, and in the future, these results\nwill need to be confirmed through more extensive serological investigation of PDCoV\nepidemiology."}
