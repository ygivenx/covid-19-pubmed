{"title": "", "body": "When offered a choice, mosquitoes preferred to take bloodmeals from membrane feeders filled with human red blood cells combined with the supernatant from cultured trophozoite and gametocyte-stage parasites over blood cells alone. Amazingly, they found that they could get a similar increase in the level of attraction to red blood cells when the cells were spiked with HMBPP alone. When the volatiles produced by red blood cells alone, in combination with the supernatant from gametocyte-infected cells, or combined with HMBPP, were measured, Emami et al. observed an increase in CO 2 emissions, aldehydes, and monoterpenes. When these volatiles were combined with CO 2 they were able to reproduce the attraction response. These results indicate that the HMBPP produced by the parasite during blood-stage infection in the vertebrate may increase the attraction of mosquitoes to infectious hosts.\n\nOnce mosquitoes reached the feeders, further effects on mosquito feeding and engorgement were observed. A female approaching an HMBPP-spiked bloodmeal was more likely to engorge compared with females approaching feeders containing only red blood cells. This increase in engorgement rates was similar to those found in females offered bloodmeals containing blood-stage malaria parasites. Convincingly, the proportion of females engorging could be manipulated by altering either the concentration of gametocyte-stage parasites in the blood meal or the concentration of HMBPP alone. Females feeding on HMBPP feeders took larger bloodmeals and were more likely to be successfully infected with a higher titer of malaria parasites at both the oocyst and sporozoite stages. These changes in susceptibility to parasites may be related to changes in the transcription of several immune factors measured in these females.\n\nWhile these changes in attraction preference and blood-feeding behaviour would greatly benefit the parasites by getting mosquitoes to feed on infectious hosts, their effects on the mosquito seemed to be neutral. While only a single clutch of eggs was measured, there was no effect of HMBPP on the number of eggs laid by females or their subsequent survival.\n\nThis study is the first to implicate a specific parasite factor responsible for causing increased attraction to infectious hosts. Many of the assays executed in this study were made possible by using an artificial membrane system. It will be important going forward to confirm that HMBPP has similar effects when circulating in entire hosts. Encouragingly, the membrane system used here did replicate some aspects of work with living hosts. For example, work in mice [1] has shown that the increased attraction to infected mice was also correlated with periods of infection with higher gametocyte intensity. The effect of these changes in bloodmeal preference feeding behaviour in mosquitoes needs to be further investigated. While fecundity and survival were not affected, these related parameters were measured in separate individuals. Utilizing more complete measures of mosquito fitness may clarify the effects of altered feeding and immune gene expression on females [8] . As always is the case with laboratory-based studies, it will be important to confirm that these results are true in field-derived strains under natural conditions. Despite these remaining questions, this study contributes an important piece of the puzzle of how malaria may maintain transmission against seemingly unlikely odds. While recent work on how parasites may alter mosquito feeding behaviour after infection has cast the parasite in a more passive role, this study indicates that when it comes to infecting mosquitoes in the first place, malaria parasites are playing an active role. Do stress hormones, such as corticosterone, enhance bird susceptibility to mosquitoes in ways that enhance rates of co-infection? Does this then enhance pathogen emergence?\n\nInteractions between pathogens are often mediated by the immune system of the host [1] . Two recent experimental papers suggest that interactions between the immune system and corticosterone are important in mediating synergistic interactions between pathogens that enhance rates of co-infection [7, 8] , the effect of corticosterone on parasitemia had already been tested experimentally by Applegate, 45 years ago! While attempting to understand what drives the spring increase in P. relictum infection intensity in house sparrows with a chronic infection, Applegate [6] treated the birds with corticosterone; this resulted in an increase in Plasmodium parasitemia: a higher proportion of blood films had demonstrable parasites, and a higher proportion of erythrocytes was infected than in the control group. In a follow-up experiment, Applegate and Beaudoin [6] demonstrated that corticosterone and not gonadotropin caused the spring relapse in avian malaria.\n\nIn Figure 1 , we summarize these findings by linking the observation that Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection causes an increase in corticosterone level ( Figure 1A ) making the bird more atractive to mosquitoes ( Figure 1B) , and increasing Plasmodium parasitemia directly ( Figure 1C ) and indirectly ( Figure 1D ). Infection with M. gallisepticum causes an increase in corticosterone level (A) [2] , making the bird more attractive to mosquitoes (B) [3] , and causing an increase in Plasmodium parasitemia directly (C) [5, 6] and indirectly (D) [4] . The question mark represents the hypothesis that Plasmodium infection in a bird increases the disease severity caused by M. gallisepticum, which would result in a positive feedback loop.\n\ntwo pathogens may reduce the immunopathological effects of an overworked immune system and this may allow each pathogen to persist for longer in co-infected [ 8 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] hosts. This could enhance either the transmission success of one or both pathogens or the colonization of a new host species by a novel pathogen.\n\nPrior infection with one pathogen (the malaria parasite Plasmodium) may facilitate later infection with, and transmission of, another completely unrelated pathogen, the bacterium M. gallisepticum. A similar situation is the example of Babesia microti (a malaria-like parasite that infects red blood cells and is the cause of babesiosis) and Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease [11] . Diuk-Wasser and colleagues showed how Babesia only successfully establishes in populations in which Lyme disease is already present. More subtly, these examples suggest that prior infections, such as malaria, or parasitic helminths, help facilitate the emergence of pathogens, such as Ebola, Nipah, Hendra, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, or Zika virus. They also underline the previously underexplored potential role that co-infection interacting with host endocrine stress might have in mediating the emergence of novel pathogens. For example, pregnant mothers who are often immunologically stressed and have major upheavals in their endocrine system are more susceptible to mosquito bites [12] . Was this a significant factor in the emergence of Zika virus? To date, the role of endocrine and nutritional processes in the within-host dynamics of pathogens has been essentially ignored. However, it may prove to be an important missing link in many future studies of the emergence and subsequent coevolutionary dynamics of many host-parasite systems.\n\nR01GM085232, all part of the Ecology and Evolution One key to this clinical and geographic range is the biological diversity of Leishmania. Clinically important parasites are found in two cladesthe new world subgenus Viannia and the subgenus Leishmania found in both the new and old worlds ( Figure 1 ); the parasites largely responsible for VL are in Leishmania, while both groups contain parasites causing CL. The Viannia and Leishmania groups contain all the best known species, but only around 20 out of approximately 53 recognised species of Leishmania [1] are known to infect humans, and of these probably only 10 are of major public health importance.\n\nOther Leishmania species are much less well known: a basal group of Leishmania species known as Paraleishmania and a species called Leishmania enrietti infect wild mammals in South America. An unusual group (subgenus Sauroleishmania)"}
