{"title": "In vitro mitogen responses and !ymphoc e subpopulations in cheetahs", "body": "Viral diseases are a significant problem in both domestic cat and captive exotic cat populations. Clinical feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Briggs and Ott, 1986) , feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) (Pfeifer et al., 1983) , and feline herpesvirus (FHV-1 ) (Scherba et al., 1988 ) infections have been reported in cheetahs. During 1982 During -1983 , an epizootic of FIPV infection in a colony ofcaptive-raised cheetahs resulted in over 90% morbidity and 19 deaths (54% mortality) (O'Brien et al., 1985; Evermann et al., 1986 Evermann et al., , 1988 . While coronavirus infection is common in domestic cats, mortality caused by feline ir~fectious peritonitis is low. The apparent susceptibility of cheetahs stimulated speculation that this species' immune system was not competent to defend against specific viral infections, and led to investigations which demonstrated extreme monomo~hism at red blood cell and leukocyte isoenzyme loci, as well ~.s major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci (assessed by allogeneic skin graft survival) (O'Brien eta!,, 1983 (O'Brien eta!,, , 1985 . Since self-restricted, virus-specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity plays an important role in the host's immune response to viral infection, it has been suggested that reduced MHC polymorphism may alter the host's ability to respond to infection and could result in a uniform susceptibility among individuals of a species (Toolan, 1978; McGuire et al., 1985; Watkins et al., 1988) . This hypothesis has been suggested as an explanation for the outcome of the FIPV epizootic in cheetahs (O'Brien et al., 1985 ) . However, assays designed to assess the cheetah's general immune function have not been performed. In stimulated proliferation) and phenotype of cheetah PBM to determine whether this species exhibited a unitbrmly poor immune response that may account for its unique susceptibility to certain pathogens. In addition, these studies lay a foundation for further investigations of virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses, and for possible differences between felids.\n\nAdult cheetahs were maintained at the San Di~go Wild Animal Park (Escondido, CA), Wildlife Safari (Winston, OR) and Columbus Zoo (Columbus, OH). Blood was'drawn from animals under ketamine anesthesia. For comparison, blood samples were obtained from apparently healthy domestic cats, also under ketamine anesthesia, at a local animal shelter in San Diego county. All cats were feline leukemia virus negative as determined by ELISA (Tech America Diagnostics, Elwood, KS ).\n\nSerum-containing medium (SCM) consisted of RPMI 1640 (Cell Culture Facility-UCSD, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100/~g/ml streptomycin, 25 mM HEPES buffer, and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT). Fetal calf serum was heat-inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min prior to its addition to SCM. Medium was filtersterilized using a 0.2/~m millipore filter.\n\nConditioned medium from a gibbon T cell line, ML 144, was used as the exogenous source of interleuldn-2 (IL-2). These culture supernatants have been shown to contain an active factor indistinguishable from human IL-2 and free of other lympholdnes and cytokines; i.e. IL-1, IL-3, interferon, B cell growth factor, macrophage-inhibiting factor, macrophage-activating factor, colony-stimulating factor and epidermal growth factor. MLA 144 supernarant was produced in SCM as previously described (Rabin et al., 1981 ) .\n\nMitogens were prepared as stock solutions of 1 mg/ml from lyophilized samples, filter-sterilized, and diluted in SCM before use. Concanavalin A (Con A) (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (Weftcome Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC), soybean agglutinin (SBA), wheat germ agg!~lutinin (WGA), and peanut agglutinin (PNA) (all from Vector Laboratories, Buriingame, CA) were included in the panel of mitogens tested.\n\nFluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated F (ab') 2 rabbit anti-cat IgG pel Laboratories (Cooper Biomedical Inc., Malvern, PA). A monoclonal antibody, FT2, that identifies feline cytotoxic T cells (Tc) (Klotz and Cooper, 1986 )~ was kindly provided by Dr. Max Cooper (University of Alabama).\n\nPeripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture and collected in acid citricdextrose (ACD) vacutainers (Beckton-Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ). Whole blood was diluted 1:2 with calcium-free and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and layered on FicoU-Paque (Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, NJ). After centrifugation for 40 min at 800\u00d7g, cells at the interface were removed, washed, and resuspended in SCM. Cells were enumerated and viability judged by 0.2% trypan blue dye exclusion.\n\nPBM were diluted to 1X 10 6 cells/ml in SCM and 100/~1 samples added to 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Mitogens were diluted to the appropriate concentration in SCM and 100/~1 added to quadruplicate sets ofwells. In experiments testing the effect of IL-2, MLA 144 supernatant was added at a final concentration of 25% (v/v) with the mitogen.\n\nCultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air for 3 days. Cells received 1/tCi/well 3H-thymidine (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) during the last 18 h of incubation. Plates were frozen at -20 \u00b0 C, and thawed just prior to harvesting onto glass fiber filter paper using a multiple automated sample harvester (MASH). Samples were dried, then counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Data are represented as the mean 3H-thymidine incorporation observed in quadruplicate cultures and expressed as counts per minute (cpm) +_ standard deviation.\n\nAliquots of 1-2 \u00d7 106 cells were stained for identification of PBM phenotypes by FACS analysis. Cells were washed with cold PBS +0.02% NaNa. Pellets were resuspended in 100 .ul of PBS + NaNa (controls) or 1 : 10 dilution of FT2. After incubation on ice for 45 rain, cells were washed and resuspended in 100/d of PBS + NaNa (unstained control ), or 1 : 10 dilution of FITC-affinity purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Tubes were placed on ice for an additional 45 min incubation, washed and fixed with 0.5 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde. Foil-covered tubes were stored at 4 \u00b0C until FACS analysis was performed. Surface immunoglobulin was detected using direct immunofluorescence staining with a 1 : 50 dilution of FITC-F (ab') 2 rabbit anti-cat IgG. Cells were handled as described above.\n\nCells were analyzed using a Becton-Dickinson FACS IV (Mountain View, CA) equipped with 2 W argon laser. The fluorescently labeled cells, with a flow rate between 300 and 1000 cells/s, were excited at 488 nm at 400 mW. Fluorescence was detected on a Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) at 650 V after passing through a 530/30 nm pass filter.\n\nLow angle (forward scattered) light was detected with a photodiode. Orthogonal (90 \u00b0 ) scattered light was detected with a PMT at 300 V after passing through a 488/10 nm band pass filter. Two-three \u00d7 104cells were analyzed and data were collected in list mode and processed using the Electric Desk (Becton-Dickinson).\n\nFor all the experiments, the operating parameters of the FACS IV were standardized using fluorescent microspheres and the \"Calibryte\" program.\n\nSingle comparisons were made using the one4aiied Student's t-test.\n\nOptimal conditions for stimulation were determined by incubating 1 X 10 s cheetah PBM with varying doses of mitogens (Con A, PWM, PHA ) and harvesting daily over a 7-day interval. Maximal 3H-thymidine incorporation occurred on Day 3 or 4 (data not shown), as reported for domestic eats (Cockerell et al., 1975) . Therefore, all further mitogen assays were harvested on Day 3.\n\nSeveral mitogens previously shown to stimulate lymphocytes were chosen to assess in vitro proliferation. In preliminary experiments, stimulation occurred over a wide range ofconcentrations. Doses chosen to compare optimal responses by individual animals were as follows: 50 #g/ml Con A, 2/Ag/ml PWM, 1% PHA, l0/~g/ml PNA, l0/~g/ml SBA and l0/~g/ml WGA. A wide range of responses was observed to each of the mitogens tested, although some mitogens (Con A, PHA, PNA) induced higher levels ofprolif-\u00a2ration. Proliferation of PBM from domestic cats occurred within the same range as that of the cheetahs and individual responses were evenly distributed throughout this range. However, as a group, domestic cats did not respond as well to PNA (group means: cheetahs, 12, I 17 cpm; domestic cats, 3191 cpm: significantly different at P< 0.05 ).\n\nIndividual variation within species was also evident. Responses of cheetah PBM were as variable as those observed with domestic cat PBM. Cells from animals that were high responde.rs (Cheetahs 8, l 0, I l ) to one mitogen usually responded well to the rest of the mitogen panel. However, PWM, SBA and WGA were not as potent mitogens as Con A, PHA and PNA. Certain individuals within the population (Cheetahs 12, 13, 17 ) generally responded less to mitogen stimulation. Previous experiments demonstrated that high (Cheetah 8 ) and low (Cheetahs 12 and 13 ) responders to Con A were consistent over time. \n\nreceptors. Although individual responses varied, most responses were significantly enhanced in the presence of IL-2 (except Cheetah 6; not significant at P< 0.05 ). These results indicate that IL-2 responsiveness by cheetah PBM is acquired with mitogenic stimulation and may serve an important role in T cell expansion, similar to other species (Paetkau et al., 1980; Ruscetti and Gallo, 1981 ) . In addition, the lack of responsiveness to IL-2 cannot be considered a likely mechanism for poor responses by cheetah PBM to specific mitogens because exogenous IL-2 augmented responses in the majority of individuals.\n\nProliferative responses to B and T lymphocyte mitogens suggested the presence of both populations in cheetah PBM. Altered ratios or the absence of some populations might account for the poor responses in some individuals. In order to characterize the distribution of these populations, fresh PBM were stained with anti-cat IgG and FT2, and FACS analysis performed. Figure 4 shows the typical staining pattern of domestic cat and cheetah PBM with FT2. A summary of results is presented in Table 1 . The distribution of sIg+ ( 31.2% ) and FT2 + (28.7%) cells in domestic cats was similar to values previously reported (Klotz and Cooper, 1986; Kuramochi et al., 1987) . The number of positively stained cheetah PBM was less than domestic cat. The decreased value may be due to a lower affinity of FT2 antibody for cheetah PBM or fewer cells expressing the surface marker. However, the range of FT2 + cells was similar in both species.\n\nSince FT2+ cells represent the T cytotoxic subpopulation (Klotz and set. Therefore, if the relative numbers of non-T cells remain constant, as T helper cell numbers increase, an increase in proliferation should occur. In order to assess the helper cell subpopulation crudely, the relationship between percentage of FT2 + cells and proliferation to PHA was examined. Figure 5 demonstrates a significant negative correlation (r=-0.68, P<0.05), supporting the hypothesis that proliferation can be used as an indirect method of assessing numbers of functional T helper cells. Alternatively, an increase in FT2 + cells may represent an increase in the T suppressor cell population. As previously observed, individuals varied widely in the levels of Tc/Th cells present.\n\nIn these studies, mitogen-stimulated proliferative responses of cheetah and domestic cat PBM were found to be similar. However, the values tended to be lower than those observed in other species (Larsson, 198 l; Smith et al., 198 l; Wu et al., 1982) . Wide individual variation occurred in both species. Among cheetahs from which serial samples were taken, individuals could be classified as consistently high or low responders. Possible mechanisms accounting for these differences were investigated by examining the response of mitogen-stimulated cells to exogenous IL-2 and phenotypic analysis of the PBM population. The ability of IL-2 supplementation to augment proliferation ofboth high and low responders indicated that cheetah PBM can be stimulated to express IL-2 receptors, and that both groups have IL-2 responsive cells in their repertoire. Therefore, lack of IL-2 responsiveness probably does IIUL \u00a31[qk, l.~UUllL IUI tll~ UIII~Iq~;IIUU~ OO~g~;l V\u2022U, Studies in other species have demonstrated a correlation between level of proliferation and IL-2 production (Lopez-Botet et al., 1982; Miller-Edge and Splitter, 1986; Tompkins et al., 1988 ) . In the light of enhanced responses to exogenous IL-2, insufficient IL-2 production may be an underlying defect in low responding cheetahs. Similar investigations using bovine and porcine PBM have shown that supplemental IL-2 can reconstitute suboptimal responses to maximal levels (Miller-Edge and Splitter, 1986; Stott et al., 1986 ) . Assays to quantitate IL-2 production in cheetah PBM cultures are currently underway.\n\nDifferences between animals may be due to variable numbers of IL-2 producing 2nd/or responding cells in an individual's PBM population. Phenotypic comparisons showed slightly higher numbers of SIg + (B) and FT2 + (Tc) cells in domestic cat PBM versus cheetah PBM. However, the increase may be an artefact of greater affinity for the species to which the antibody was developed (domestic cat). Therefore, the similar phenotypic distribution between species is consistent with the observed similarities in proliferative responses. Interestingly, when examining the relationship between prolifera-tion and phenotype in individual cheetahs, a significant correlation was observed. For example, Cheetah 12, a low responder in the mitogen studies, had increased numbers of FT2 + cells. The decrease in proliferation with increased numbers of FT2 + cells could be explained by postulating a concomittant decrease in T helper cells or an increase in T suppressor (Ts) cells, as has been demonstrated in humans (Chudwin et a!.~ 1983) . Since cytotoxic and suppressor T cells share phenotypic markers in other species, this may be an alternative explanation for the lower response. Some cheetahs may have greater numbers of suppressor cells (possibly FT2 + ) that upset the immune system's delicate balance. Further studies which examine T cell subpopulation functions such as suppressor assays are necessary to test this hypothesis.\n\nAlthough cheetahs appear to be more susceptible than domestic cats to coronavirus infections (O'Brien et al., 1985 ) , evidence for species-specific defects in cell-mediated immune function could not be demonstrated using nonspecific in vitro assays. However, if mitogen stimulation is used as a tool for evaluation of CMI, those individuals with low responses may have increased susceptibility to pathogens (Effros and Walford, 1983 ) . Recent studies of immunologic parameters in FeLV-infected domestic cats have linked abrogation of T cell mitogen responsiveness and decreased IL-2 production in vitro with clinical in vivo immunosuppression . These cats commonly succumb to secondary infections.\n\nThe inability to mount an adequate protective response may be virus-specific or may be associated with an inability to recognize foreign antigens because of reduced MHC polymorphism. In order to assess selective deficits in the immune repertoire antigen-specific lymphocyte assays are required.\n\nThr. increasing ,,,\u00b0;t\u00b0r,m,,, of eo~;.,,_..,..,.;e, ....... ,..~..a characterization of the feline MHC will allow further investigation of immunologic mechanisms m these species. The current studies rule out general immunocom-promi~e in cheetahs as the underlying cause of the species' increased susceptibility to certain viral infections. However, individual animals may exhibit poor responses and be at higher risk. This could be due to insufficient IL-2 production, since supplemental IL-2 enhanced responses. In addition, culture conditions and ranges of expected responses are established for examining antigen-specific T cell function.\n\nWe thank the veterinary medical staff at the San Diego Wild Ammai t'atlc (Drs.
