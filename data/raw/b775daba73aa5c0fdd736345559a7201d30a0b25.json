{"title": "Beclin orthologs: integrative hubs of cell signaling, membrane trafficking, and physiology HHS Public Access", "body": "Similar to its role in yeast, mammalian Beclin 1 is part of distinct Vps34 (also known as PI3KC3)-containing complexes (PI3KC3-C1 and PI3KC3-C2) that function differentially in autophagy and endocytic trafficking, respectively ( Figure 1 ) [22] [23] [24] [25] . The precise subunits of each complex vary somewhat in different reports but, in general, there is consensus that mammalian Atg14 [also known as Atg14L or Barkor (Beclin 1 interacting autophagy related key regulator)] functions similarly to yeast Atg14 as an autophagy-specific component that targets Beclin 1-Vps34 to the sites of initiation of phagophore biogenesis, whereas mammalian UVRAG functions similarly to yeast Vps38 as a subunit involved in endocytic maturation [22] [23] [24] [25] . In addition to its function in early autophagosomal biogenesis, Atg14 appears on mature autophagosomes where it interacts with autophagic SNAREs [soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) receptors], syntaxin-17 and SNAP29 to promote autophagosome-lysosome tethering and fusion [26] . NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2), the mammalian counterpart of Atg38, also bridges the interaction between Vps34-Vps15 and Beclin 1-Atg14 [27, 28] . UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated gene) positively regulates Vps34 activity on endosomes and lysosomes [22] , and another protein, Rubicon, that lacks an obvious yeast counterpart, counteracts this function of UVRAG [24, 25, 29, 30] . The UVRAG-containing Beclin 1/Vps34 complex is currently believed to function in both endocytic trafficking and autophagosomal maturation, although it is still a mater of debate whether UVRAG functions in autophagosome maturation directly or indirectly through its endocytic functions. In addition to autophagy and endocytic trafficking, mammalian Beclin 1 and its binding partners in the class III PI3K complex also participate in a process termed 'LC3-associated phagocytosis' (named from microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) [7] , which involves the maturation of phagosomes containing intracellular pathogens, apoptotic cells, or entotic cells ( Figure 2 ).\n\nThe central mechanism by which Atg6/Beclin 1 functions in autophagy and probably in endocytic maturation seems to be via the allosteric regulation of organelle-specific lipid kinase activity of the catalytic subunit of Vps34. Atg6/Beclin 1 is a peripheral membrane protein containing an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region [31] , a BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3) domain [32] , a coiled-coil domain [33] , and a C-terminal BARA (\u03b2-\u03b1 repeated, autophagy-specific) domain [34, 35] . It is generally believed that the Vps34-Vps15-Atg6/ Beclin 1 complex is recruited to autophagic or endocytic membranes through interaction between the coiled-coil domain of Beclin 1 with either Atg14 or Vps38/UVRAG, thereby specifying the organellar site of Vps34 lipid kinase activity. Atg14 directly interacts with membrane via the hydrophobic surface of an ALPS (amphipathic lipid-packing sensor) motif within its BATS (Barkor/Atg14 autophagosome targeting sequence) domain [36] , and UVRAG likely interacts with membrane through its phospholipid-binding C2 domain, or indirectly through its interaction with Bif-1/endophilin B1 that contains an N-terminal N-BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain and a C-terminal SH3 (Src-homology 3) domain, which display membrane binding and bending activities [37, 38] . Beclin 1 may also bridge the membrane interaction of the PI3KC3 complex through aromatic amino acids at the tip of a surface loop in its BARA domain [34] .\n\nRecently, the structure of the PI3KC3-C1 complex was determined by single-particle electron microscopy of ordered regions of the Beclin 1, Atg14, Vps15, and Vps34 subunits, and its dynamics were analyzed by hydrogen exchange [39] . While higher-resolution structures that include the full-length proteins of each of these subunits as well as of NRBF2 will be helpful for a more complete understanding, these studies reveal an architectural and dynamic model that is consistent with a growing body of evidence that modifications in the N-terminus of Beclin 1 are crucial for regulating the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC3-C1. According to the model proposed by Baskaran et al. , the complex has a V-shaped architecture; Vps15 forms a bridge between Vps34 and an Atg14-Beclin 1 subcomplex; dynamic transitions occur during which the lipid kinase domain of Vps34 is ejected from the complex and Vps15 pivots at the base of the V; and the N-terminal disordered region of Beclin 1 is predicted to reside near the pivot point, thereby allosterically regulating the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC3-C1.\n\nAs discussed below and shown in Figure 3 , the N-terminal region of Beclin 1 contains many residues that are targets of autophagy regulatory kinases [e.g., ULK1, MAP kinase activated protein kinases 2/3 (MAPKAPK2/MAPKAPK3 -MK2/MK3), AMPK, DAPK, ROCK1, and MST1], as well the BH3 domain which mediates its interactions with a crucial family of negative regulators of autophagy, Bcl-2, and its related cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins. Most autophagy stimulatory phosphorylation events enhance Beclin 1-associated Vps34 lipid kinase activity, whereas most autophagy inhibitory phosphorylation events as well as Bcl-2 binding inhibit Beclin 1-associated Vps34 lipid kinase activity. Furthermore, Bcl-2 binding, which stabilizes Beclin 1 homodimers, blocks N-terminal autophagy stimulatory phosphorylation (e.g., MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation [40] ) whereas Atg14-Beclin 1 heterodimerization enhances N-terminal autophagy stimulatory phosphorylation (e.g., ULK1-dependent Beclin 1 S14 phosphorylation [41] , AMPKdependent Beclin 1 S93 and S96 phosphorylation [42] ). Thus, both structural and biochemical data point to a crucial role of regulatory signaling input into Beclin 1 as a key mechanism for regulating Vps34 lipid kinase activity at membranes involved in autophagosomal biogenesis and endocytic maturation. The stimulation of Vps34 lipid kinase activity and resulting phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) production then allows downstream effectors to complete the processes of membrane extension, cargo recruitment, and autophagosome maturation [43] . Of note (and an important experimental limitation for autophagy detection by Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/LC3-II western blots), Atg6 and Beclin 1 are essential for the recruitment of lipidated Atg8 and LC3, respectively, to the autophagosome, but Atg6 is not essential in yeast [44, 45] and Beclin 1 is not essential in mouse embryonic stem cells [46] for the Atg8/LC3 lipidation process itself.\n\nGiven the complexity of mammals, it is not surprising that mammalian Beclin 1 undergoes multiple layers of regulation in addition to its interactions with other core subunits of the PI3KC3 complexes. Diverse cellular stimuli communicate with the PI3KC3 complexes to modulate autophagy and endocytic trafficking via post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 (e.g., phosphorylation, ubiquitination), sequestration of Beclin 1 in other subcellular locations (e.g., cytoskeleton, Golgi apparatus), or via protein-protein interactions that alter its interactions with other core components of PI3KC3 complexes or directly affect Beclin 1-associated Vps34 lipid kinase activity ( Figure 3 ). The wide and continuously growing spectrum of bona fide Beclin 1-interacting partners ( Table 2 ) that contribute to such regulation underlines the importance of crosstalk with Beclin 1 and autophagy in growth signaling, metabolism, mitophagy, innate immune signaling, and microbial pathogenesis. At present, it is unclear, given the multitude of post-translational modifications and proteinprotein interactions that regulate the function of Beclin 1, what the precise temporal, spatial, and hierarchical relationships are between different modes of Beclin 1 regulation, and how such relationships may be altered in different cell types and physiological/ pathophysiological contexts. In the sections below we highlight a few key mechanisms underlying the regulation of Beclin 1 activity that relate to metabolism and cancer, including binding of Bcl-2 family members and phosphorylation by oncogenic and candidate tumorsuppressor kinases. For a more complete review of the Beclin 1 interactome ( Table 2 ) and regulation of Beclin 1 by ubiquitination (summarized in Figure 3 ) we refer readers to other excellent recent reviews on this topic [47, 48] .\n\nBeclin 1 was originally identified by virtue of its interaction with Bcl-2 [16] , and several Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , and virus-encoded Bcl-2 proteins, inhibit autophagy through a direct interaction with the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 [49] . Unlike other BH3-only proteins, Beclin 1 has no direct effects on the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 or on apoptosis [50] , whereas, in contrast, the apoptotic machinery may negatively regulate autophagy through caspase cleavage of Beclin 1 [51] or Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death)-mediated sequestration of Beclin 1 to microtubules [52] . The favored hypothesis is that Bcl-2 family members interact with the dimerized form of Beclin 1 in unstressed cells, and upon exposure to stress stimuli the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex, as well as Beclin 1 homodimerization, is disrupted, leading to heterodimerization with Atg14 or UVRAG and enhanced Vps34 lipid kinase activity on distinct membrane structures to activate autophagy or endocytosis [23, 24, 30, [53] [54] [55] . Recent evidence also indicates that the binding of Bcl-2 to Beclin 1 blocks a newly defined signaling event both in vitro and in mouse tissues that is essential for initiation of amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, namely, MK2/MK3mediated Beclin 1 S90 serine phosphorylation [40] . Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Bcl-2, but not mitochondrion-localized Bcl-2, inhibits autophagy [56] , and this is consistent with a crucial role of ER-associated PI3KC3 activity in autophagosome initiation [57, 58] .\n\nThe dissociation of Bcl-2/Beclin 1 represents a central switch that turns autophagy on in response to diverse stress signals, including amino acid starvation [59, 60] , exercise [60] , death signaling molecules (e.g., DAPK) [61] , toll-like receptor adaptor signaling molecules (e.g., MyD88 and Trif) [62] and the host restriction molecule, TRIM5\u03b1 (tripartite motifcontaining protein 5\u03b1) [63] . Several different mechanisms regulate the interaction between Bcl-2 and the BH3 domain of Beclin 1, including competitive disruption by BH3-only proteins [64] , phosphorylation events within the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 that either promote (e.g., MST1) or inhibit (e.g., DAPK, ROCK1) its binding to Bcl-2 [61, 65, 66] , or by multisite phosphorylation of the non-structured loop of Bcl-2, which prevents its binding to Beclin 1 [59] . During starvation conditions, this is mediated by the stress-signaling molecule, JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1) [59] , whereas the kinase that leads to Bcl-2 phosphorylation and disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex during exercise is not yet known [60] .\n\nThe physiological relevance of Bcl-2 multisite phosphorylation in regulating stimulusinduced autophagy has been demonstrated in vivo using knock-in mice containing nonphosphorylatable mutations in Bcl-2 (T69A, S70A and S84A; Bcl-2 AAA ) [60] . These mice have normal basal levels of autophagy but are severely deficient in starvation-and exerciseinduced autophagy. This deficiency in exercise-induced autophagy in mice with normal basal levels of autophagy and normal tissue development led to the discovery of a novel role of Beclin 1 and autophagy in metabolism. Unlike wild type mice, acute exercise in Bcl-2 AAA mice fails to result in increased insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, as measured by glucose uptake, plasma membrane localization of the glucose transporter Glut4, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Similar results were also observed in mice with allelic loss of the Beclin 1 gene Becn1 or a hypomorphic allele of another autophagy gene, Atg16L1, suggesting that these phenotypes are indeed likely due to deficient autophagy rather than being an unknown effect of the Bcl-2 AAA mutation. Moreover, chronic exercise has beneficial effects in wild type mice but not in Bcl-2 AAA mice against high-fat diet-induced diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities. These findings raise the possibility that autophagy may act not only downstream of AMPK signaling but also upstream of AMPK signaling. Such a feed-forward mechanism of autophagy on AMPK activation may help to explain the biochemical mechanisms underlying the more broad observations of beneficial effects of autophagy not only on metabolism but also on tumor-suppression and lifespan extension.\n\nThe discovery of Akt (protein kinase B)-mediated and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of Beclin 1 provides insights into the biochemical mechanisms connecting cell growth control with autophagy regulation, and also allows dissection of the role of oncogenic signaling mediated inhibition of autophagy in different stages of tumorigenesis. Many oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases and growth signaling molecules in the class I PI3K signaling pathway have been long known to suppress autophagy [67] ; however, because these signals activate mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), which not only inhibits autophagy but also stimulates translation and other processes involved in anabolic growth, the relevance of oncogenic signaling suppression of autophagy per se in tumorigenesis has been unclear.\n\nThe oncoprotein Akt is activated in the majority of human epithelial tumors, and such activation results in Beclin 1 phosphorylation on serines S234 and S295, the binding of Beclin 1 to 14-3-3 and intermediate filament proteins, its sequestration in the cytoskeleton, and mTOR-independent autophagy inhibition [68] . Importantly, the ability of Akt to transform fibroblasts and the ability of Akt-transformed fibroblasts to form fibrosarcomas when implanted into immunodeficient mice is severely impaired in cells expressing mutant forms of Beclin 1 that are resistant to Akt-mediated phosphorylation and autophagy suppression [68] . This suggests that the suppression of autophagy by oncogenic signaling may directly contribute to oncogenic transformation.\n\nThe oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase, EGFR, is amplified in many solid tumors, and constitutive active mutations in its tyrosine kinase domain are driver mutations in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) that occur in non-smokers [69] . Activated EGFR phosphorylates three Beclin 1 tyrosine residues, Y229, Y233, and Y352, which promotes Beclin 1 homodimerization and Rubicon binding, leading to decreased formation of the autophagy-active Beclin 1-containing PI3KC3-C1 complex [55] . These biochemical data are consistent with predictions from the crystal structure of the Beclin 1 coiled-coil domain, which suggest that it forms a metastable antiparallel dimer that can be disrupted by Atg14 or UVRAG to form heterodimers [33] . The two Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Y229 and Y233, are at the interface of the Beclin 1 coiled-coil domain and stabilize the homodimers [70] . Constitutive activation of Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation functions as a dominant negative mutant by promoting Beclin 1 homodimerization, and the expression of such a mutant in NSCLC xenografts leads to autophagy suppression, enhanced tumor growth, increased cell proliferation, and tumor dedifferentiation from an adenocarcinoma to a more aggressive adenosquamous phenotype [55] . In addition, the inducible expression of a Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphomimetic mutant in established NSCLC xenografts results in partial chemoresistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy [55] . Thus, Beclin 1 not only acts as a suppressor of tumor initiation, but, at least in the setting of NSCLC driven by an active EGFR mutation, also can prevent the progression of established tumors and help to mediate chemotherapeutic responses.\n\nIn contrast to active EGFR, which inhibits autophagy through Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation, inactive EGFR may function in basal and starvation-induced autophagy [71] . Inactive EGFR forms an endosomal-localized complex with LAPTM4B (lysosomal protein transmembrane 4b) and Sec5 (also known as EXOC2, exocyst complex component 2), which promotes EGFR association with Rubicon, leading to Beclin 1 dissociation from Rubicon and autophagy initiation. This function of inactive EGFR is postulated to promote tumor cell survival upon serum starvation or metabolic stress; however, this concept has not yet been tested in tumorigenesis in vivo. The opposing regulation of Beclin 1 by inactive EGFR versus active EGFR raises the broader question of whether oncogenic signals may function more generally as 'on/off' switches that tightly coordinate autophagic responses with cell growth control.\n\nWhereas there is emerging evidence that oncogenic signaling molecules may converge on Beclin 1 to suppress autophagy, there is also emerging evidence that tumor-suppressor signaling molecules converge on Beclin 1 to stimulate autophagy. The death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that induces different types of cell death (including autophagic cell death), functions as a tumor-suppressor, and is deleted in many cancer types [72] ; this kinase induces autophagy by Beclin 1 threonine T119 phosphorylation, which disrupts its binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L [61] . The liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMPK signaling pathway is an important tumor-suppressor signaling pathway that has multiple downstream targets including p53 and inhibition of mTOR [73] . AMPK has also been shown to promote autophagy by phosphorylating components of the autophagy machinery, including the upstream kinase, ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) [74, 75] , and, during glucose starvation, Beclin 1 serines S93 and S96 [42] . The stressrelated kinase, MK3, was originally discovered by virtue of its frequent deletions in small cell lung carcinomas, is lost in a variety of other tumors, and is postulated to have tumor suppressor function [76] . This kinase, as well as its close relative, MK2, is required for amino acid starvation-induced autophagy via direct phosphorylation of Beclin 1 S90 [40] . Furthermore, mutation of Beclin 1 S90 blocks the ability of Beclin 1 to rescue starvationinduced autophagy in Beclin 1-deficient cells and blocks the tumor-suppressor activity of Beclin 1 in MCF7 human breast carcinoma xenografts [40] . While further studies are warranted to determine the precise role of Beclin 1 activation/phosphorylation by tumorsuppressor signaling molecules in mediating their tumor-suppressor function, it is notable that environmental stress signals -such as glucose and/or amino acid starvation -may dually activate autophagy and inhibit tumorigenesis. The overlapping requirement of specific post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 for its autophagy and tumor-suppressor activity may suggest a mechanistic link between these two functions, although more general effects on regulation of Vps34 activity in other trafficking events cannot be ruled out.\n\nAnother layer of complexity in higher eukaryotic organisms, beyond the diversity of signaling inputs to Beclin 1, has emerged from the identification of mammalian specific autophagy proteins such as AMBRA1 (autophagy/Beclin-1 regulator 1) that activate the Beclin 1-containing PI3KC3-C1 complex (reviewed in [77] ) and the recent identification of a mammalian-specific Beclin 1 homolog, Beclin 2 [9] . Beclin 2 shares ~57% sequence identity with Beclin 1 and, similarly to Beclin 2, contains a predicted BH3 domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal BARA domain [9] . Beclin 2 interacts with Atg14, Vps34, UVRAG, and AMBRA1, but not Rubicon, and is required for autophagy [9] . The distinct tissue expression pattern of Beclin 2 versus Beclin 1 [9] may reflect distinct roles of different Beclin family members in different tissues; however, it is unclear why these proteins are not functionally redundant in autophagy in cells that express both proteins given their similarity in the coiled-coil and BARA domains.\n\nThe most notable sequence divergence between Beclin 1 and Beclin 2 is in their N-terminal regions. The N-terminus of Beclin 2, but not Beclin 1, interacts with GASP1 (G-proteincoupled receptor-associated sorting protein 1), and Beclin 2, but not Beclin 1, is required for the endolysosomal trafficking and degradation of GASP1-dependent G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the \u03b4-opioid receptor, the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), and the non-recycling mutant \u03b2-adrenergic receptor [9] . This function of Beclin 2 in lysosomal degradation of particular GPCRs is not shared by other members of the autophagic PI3KC3 complex such as Atg14, Beclin 1, and Vps34. Thus, GPCR endolysosomal trafficking represents the first Vps34 kinase-independent trafficking function described for members of the Atg6/Beclin family. This dual use of a mammalian-specific protein in an autophagy PI3KC3 complex and in autophagy-independent, PI3KC3independent, endolysosomal degradation of an important class of cell surface receptors may reflect a need for mammalian cells to integrate diverse lysosomal degradation pathways to optimally fine-tune cellular responses to complex environmental signals.\n\nAtg6/Beclin 1 null mutations in lower eukaryotes result in several important developmental and disease phenotypes (Table 1) , likely reflecting its diverse functions in autophagy, vacuolar protein sorting, and endocytic maturation. Many of these phenotypes, such as defective sporulation in yeasts [10] , proper entry into G 0 /G 1 quiescence during nitrogen starvation in yeasts [78] , defective fruiting body formation in Dictyostelium [79] , uncontrolled cell death during the plant hypersensitive response [80] , and defective dauer development and longevity phenotypes in C. elegans [81, 82] , are identical to those observed with mutation of other core autophagy genes. However, some phenotypes such as defective pollen germination in plants [18] , impaired cell polarity in Drosophila [83] , and defects in retrograde transportation from endosomes to Golgi in C. elegans [20] are not shared by other autophagy gene mutant organisms.\n\nIn mice, biallelic loss of Becn1 results in early embryonic lethality [84, 85] . Monoallelic deletion of Becn1 results in increased incidence of spontaneous malignancies including lung carcinomas, lymphomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and breast carcinomas that have basal like features [84] [85] [86] . This latter phenotype is consistent with recent data showing that decreased BECN1 mRNA expression in patients is strongly associated with increased risk of the more aggressive basal-like subtypes of sporadic breast cancer and with worse patient survival [87] . In addition, allelic loss of Becn1 in mice results in increased susceptibility to Alzheimer's-like disease, increased severity of Desmin-related cardiomyopathy, increased renal fibrosis following ureteral obstruction, increased lung pathology during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, reduced exercise endurance, and impaired exercise-induced insulin sensitivity, among other phenotypes (Table 1 ) [5] .\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain whether most of these phenotypes are due to defects in autophagy or other trafficking functions of Beclin 1 because comparable disease models have rarely been studied in mutant animals with partial loss of function of other autophagy genes. However, tissue-specific deletion of other autophagy genes in mice generally confirms an important role for autophagy in tumor suppression and in protection against neurodegenerative, infectious, cardiac, muscular, and metabolic diseases [1, 2] . Nonetheless, a recent report describes a role for Beclin 1 in Rab5 (Ras-related in brain 5) GTPaseassociated endosome formation and endosome maturation in vivo in mouse neurons [21] . Thus, the spectrum of phenotypes of Beclin 1-deficient mice most likely reflects its diverse roles in autophagy, endocytic trafficking, and LC3-associated phagocytosis. Although Beclin 1-dependent LC3-associated phagocytosis is thought to be essential for apoptotic corpse clearance [7] , the requirement for cell autonomous ATP-production that requires both Beclin 1 and the autophagy protein, ATG5, in apoptotic clearance in mammalian embryonic body cavitation suggests that the autophagy process itself is important in this aspect of early development [88] .\n\nInterestingly, mice with allelic loss of Becn2 have a metabolic phenotype not shared by mice with allelic loss of Becn1, even though Becn1 +/\u2212 mice are more deficient in autophagy [9] . Becn2 heterozygous-deficient mice have increased brain levels of CB1R [9] and, consistent with the known effects of excessive CB1R signaling [89] , have increased food intake, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin sensitivity [9] . These findings suggest that Beclin 2-mediated lysosomal degradation of CB1R, and potentially other GPCRs, may be important in vivo in preventing diseases caused by excessive GPCR signaling. Indeed, the genetic locus that contains human Beclin 2, chromosome 1q43, has been linked to obesity and diabetes in multiple ethnic populations [9] , warranting further investigation of a possible role for Beclin 2 as a regulator of body weight and glucose homeostasis in humans.\n\nGiven the broad involvement of autophagy in defense against infection, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, and aging, agents that specifically induce autophagy may have wide therapeutic applications [5] . Proof-of-principle for the concept that enhanced Beclin 1 activity may be therapeutically beneficial is provided by rodent Becn1 gene therapy studies that have shown a protective effect in different neurodegenerative diseases (\u03b1-synuclein models of Parkinson's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 disease), cystic fibrosis, K-rasdriven lung tumors, and collagen VI muscular dystrophies [5] . Moreover, the central role of Beclin 1 as a rate-limiting protein in autophagy initiation that is tightly regulated by proteinprotein interactions and post-translational modifications provides a unique opportunity to translate knowledge gained from mechanistic studies of its regulation into new therapeutic approaches. Several drugs already in clinical use may activate autophagy at the level of Beclin 1 through disrupting Bcl-2/Beclin 1 interactions, inhibiting Akt, inhibiting EGFR and HER2 (human EGFR2), or activating AMPK, and with recent advances in understanding the precise molecular of Beclin 1 regulation it should be possible to design even more specific activators in the future.\n\nAnother therapeutic strategy for increasing autophagy by increasing Beclin 1 function has emerged from the identification of a cell permeable peptide, Tat-Beclin 1, composed of 18 amino acids from the BARA domain of Beclin 1, that likely induces autophagy by competitively disrupting the binding of endogenous Beclin 1, and a newly identified negative regulator, the Golgi-associated plant pathogenesis-related protein 1 (GAPR-1, also known as GLIPR2) [90] . Tat-Beclin 1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens (including HIV-1) in vitro, and reduces the mortality of mice infected with chikungunya virus or West Nile virus. Thus, this autophagy-inducing peptide (or derivatives thereof) may have potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.\n\nSignificant recent progress has been made in understanding the architecture of Beclin 1/ PI3KC3 complexes, the functional diversity of Beclin 1 and Beclin 2 in different membrane trafficking events, and the stress-induced signaling events that alter the conformation and function of Beclin 1/PI3KC3 complexes. An emerging principle is that different upstream trafficking events, including endocytic maturation, phagosomal maturation, autophagosomal biogenesis, and endolysosomal GPCR protein sorting, which converge at the stage of lysosomal degradation, may all involve protein complexes that contain either Beclin 1 (and associated subunits in the PI3KC3 complex) or Beclin 2. The complex integration of cell signaling molecules that regulate these complexes and their functional outputs is likely to be essential for a wide range of physiological processes. trafficking is inhibited by Rubicon, which also preferentially binds to Beclin 1 dimers, not shown here (right). The complete structure of these complexes has not been solved, and therefore the precise spatial arrangement of proteins in these complexes is not yet known.
