This 120 protein is then cleaved into the 4 individual nsP1-4 that together form a functional replication 121 complex. The processing occurs auto-catalytically through the protease that is part of nsP2 122 [43] . Mutations interfering with protease activity result in defective CHIKV replication [44] . 123\n\nSimilarly, mutations interfering with the hydrolase activity, which is part of nsP3, abolish 124 replication [9] . However, in contrast to nsP2, the biological function of the nsP3 macrodomain 125 remains elusive. 126 127\n\nHere we identified the interferon inducible mono-ARTDs, ARTD10 and ARTD12, as host factors 128 restricting CHIKV replication. ARTD10 and ARTD12, dependent on their catalytic activity, 129 prevent polyprotein processing. Similarly, the lack of a hydrolytically active macrodomain 130 results in defective polyprotein processing. We identified nsP2 as substrate for MARylation in 131 vitro and in cells. MARylation of nsP2 by ARTD10 inhibits its proteolytic activity, which 132 supports our observation of defective polyprotein processing. We demonstrate that the MAR 133 hydrolase activity associated with nsP3 removes the modification from nsP2, thereby 134 reactivating its proteolytic activity. Together, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for 135 the role of the CHIKV MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3 for viral replication and offers one 136 mechanism of how MARylation functions in host-virus conflicts. 137 138 139 140 .

This suggests that the capability 143 to reverse MARylation is essential for proper virus replication and that mono-ARTDs function 144 as antiviral host factors. To identify mono-ARTDs that potentially affect CHIKV replication we 145 performed knockdown experiments (Fig. 1a) . HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA oligo 146 pools targeting IFNa-inducible mono-ARTDs (Supplementary Fig. 1a and [6] ), such as ARTD10, 147 ARTD12, ARTD8, or ARTD7, prior to transfection with CHIKV replicon RNA. This replicon 148 encodes the four non-structural proteins but lacks the open reading frame of the structural 149 proteins. Instead, the subgenomic promotor of the replicon controls the expression of Gaussia 150 luciferase, which we analyzed as surrogate for virus replication (Fig. 1b) [46] . Replication was 151 analyzed at 9, 24 and 30 hours post transfection (hpt) (Fig. 1a) . At the early time point ARTD10 152 and ARTD12 knockdowns showed a significant increase in replication, while the effect 153 decreased at later time points. Knockdowns of ARTD8 or ARTD7 only allowed for minor 154 increases in replication compared to control (Fig. 1a) . Based on these findings we decided to 155 focus on ARTD10 and ARTD12 and their role in CHIKV replication. We employed HEK293 cells 156 stably expressing TAP-tagged ARTD10 or ARTD12, either wildtype (wt) or catalytically inactive 157 mutants (Supplementary Fig 1b, c and [14] ), to test whether overexpression of these proteins 158 interferes with CHIKV replication (Fig. 1c-g) . Protein expression was induced by doxycycline 159 (Dox) treatment prior to transfection with replicon RNA. Doxycycline treatment itself had little 160 effect on CHIKV replication ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), still control cells were always treated with 161 doxycycline as well. ARTD10 and ARTD12 reduced replication two-fold, while the respective 162 catalytically inactive variants, ARTD10-G888W(GW) or ARTD12-H564Y(HY), showed little 163 effect (Fig. 1c,d) , suggesting that the MARylation activity of these enzymes is required to 164 .

These differences are not attributed to variations in protein 165 levels, as the mutants were expressed more efficiently compared to the wt proteins (Fig. 1e, 166 Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Similarly, HEK293 cells transiently expressing ARTD10 or ARTD12 167 showed reduced replicon replication, whereas no influence of the PARylating ARTD1 or 168 ARTD14 enzymes, which do not respond to IFNa, was observed ( Supplementary Fig. 1e,f) . 169\n\nFurther analysis revealed that ARTD10 and ARTD12 had additive repressing effects on 170 replication when analyzed 30 hpt (Fig. 1f) . 171\n\nTo expand on these findings, we determined the effects of ARTD10 and ARTD12 on the 173 replication cycle of infectious CHIKV, which expresses EGFP from an additional subgenomic 174 promoter ( Fig. 1g) [47]. Overexpression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a significant 175 decrease of EGFP expressing cells as measured by flow cytometry 24 and 48 hpi ( Fig. 1g and 176 Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In this set-up, the catalytically inactive mutant of ARTD12 restricted 177 replication to the same extend as the wt protein, indicating that ARTD12 may have more than 178 one mode of action. In contrast, ARTD10-GW enhanced viral replication, hinting at a dominant 179 negative effect and thereby demonstrating dependency on catalytic activity of ARTD10 as a 180 CHIKV restriction factor. Of note is also that the inhibitory effects of ARTD10 and ARTD12 are 181 more pronounced at early time points (24 hpi) compared to later time points (48 hpi To gain insight into a possible mechanism of how MARylation by ARTD10 and ARTD12 might 187\n\ninterfere with viral replication, we determined the abundance of auto-proteolytically 188 .

Therefore, we made use of EGFP-encoding variants of the replicon ( 2 EGFP 189 and 3 EGFP, in which EGFP is integrated after amino acids 466 or 383 in nsP2 or nsP3, 190 respectively Fig. 1b and [48] ), enabling us to visualize processed nsP2 or nsP3 proteins using a 191 GFP-specific antibody (Fig. 2) . HEK293 cells stably expressing ARTD10 or ARTD10-GW were 192 employed. These cells were then transfected with or without ARTD12 expressing constructs 193 and induced for ARTD10 expression prior to transfection with 3 EGFP replicon RNA. The 194 analysis of whole cell lysates showed a reduction in processed nsP3 in presence of either the 195 enzymatically active ARTD12 or ARTD10. NsP3 was further reduced when both enzymes were 196 expressed (Fig. 2a) . These findings led us hypothesize that MARylation hampers polyprotein 197 processing. Proper polyprotein processing is a prerequisite for RNA replication [43], consistent 198 with impaired replication of a mutant replicon with an inactive protease (nsP2-C478A/S482A, 199 referred to as CASA) (Fig. 2b,c) [44]. Similarly, a functionally active macrodomain is needed for 200 replication as substitution of key amino acids in the macrodomain (D10A, V33E, for details 201 concerning the replicon construct see Fig. 1b ) interfered with replication ( Fig. 2b ,c) [6, 9] . To 202 analyze how the lack of a functional macrodomain compromised replication, we determined 203 the abundance of proteolytically processed nsP2 (Fig. 2d , for the specificity of the antibody 204 see Supplementary Fig. 3a ,b). As expected, nsP2 was detectable after transfection of the 205 wildtype (wt) but not the CASA mutant replicon (Fig. 2d) . Similarly, nsP2 was not detectable, 206 when expressed from hydrolase deficient replicons (Fig. 2d) , implying a defect in nsP2-207 mediated polyprotein processing in the absence of MAR hydrolase activity. This observation 208 was corroborated with the 3 EGFP and 2 EGFP replicons and mutants thereof ( Fig. 2e-g) . 209\n\nAlthough replication of the EGFP-encoding variants was reduced compared to the wt replicon, 210 it remained dependent on functional protease and MAR hydrolase activities (Fig. 2e,f) . As for 211 nsP2, GFP-tagged processed nsP3 was not properly generated from the hydrolase deficient 212 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.07.896977 doi: bioRxiv preprint Then we examined whether replication could also be rescued by co-expression of plasmid-237 encoded nsP2 or nsP3 and the respective replicon mutant RNA (CASA or V33E) 238 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Co-expression of the nsP2-459-798 protease domain partially rescued 239 replication of the CASA mutant suggesting that indeed polyprotein synthesis takes place 240 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a-c) . In contrast, co-expression of nsP3 or the isolated nsP3 241 macrodomain was not sufficient to rescue replication of a hydrolase deficient replicon mutant 242 (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f ). To overcome possible differences in the subcellular localization of 243 replication hubs and plasmid-expressed nsP3 macrodomain, we fused the macrodomain to an 244 anti-GFP-nanobody to enhance targeting to sites of replication of the EGFP encoding 245 replicons. We transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids coding for a GFP-nanobody-nsP3-246 macrodomain fusion protein prior to transfection with the 3 EGFP-replicon RNA. We analyzed 247 GFP by flow cytometry (Fig. 3i -k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Whereas the overall amount of GFP-248 positive cells when transfected with the V33E mutant was low compared to the wildtype and 249 stayed unaffected by co-expression of GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain (Fig. 3i) , we 250 observed an increase in GFP intensity dependent on hydrolytic activity of the GFP-nanobody 251 fusion protein (Fig. 3j, k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In line with this replication in presence of the 252 wildtype GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain was slightly but significantly increased (Fig. 3l) . 253\n\nFurther, the analysis of nsP3 revealed an increase in its processed form (Fig. 3m,n) , indicating 254 that the co-expression of the GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain at least to some extend was 255 able to rescue the CHIKV replicon lacking hydrolase activity. 256 257 Taken together, these data suggest strongly that polyprotein synthesis of the different 258 mutated replicons occurs and further support the hypothesis that MARylation affects 259 polyprotein processing. 260 .

Our previous studies indicated 262 that ARTD10-dependent MARylation impairs the catalytic activity of the kinase GSK3b, which 263 is antagonized by cellular MAR hydrolases [37, 49] . Furthermore, MARylation is reported to 264 affect protein-protein interactions, mRNA stability and translation [1]. Following our 265 hypothesis, we determined the consequences of MARylation on the protease activity of nsP2, 266 which is responsible for polyprotein processing [43] . Therefore, we tested whether nsP2 267 serves as substrate for mono-ARTDs. His6-tagged fusion proteins of CHIKV nsP2 or nsP2-459- We obtained similar results with nsP2 MARylated by full length ARTD10, while no MARylation 282 was obtained with ARTD10-GW (Fig. 4c ). In addition, nsP2 was reversibly MARylated by full 283 length ARTD12 (Fig. 4d ). To complement these in vitro findings, we measured MARylation of 284 .

The 285 immunoprecipitated nsP2-2 EGFP stained positively with a MAR binding reagent. In support, 286 this staining was reduced upon incubation with the recombinant nsP3 macrodomain, 287 providing evidence that this protein is MARylated in cells (Fig. 4e) . Similarly, upon co-288 transfection of a plasmid expressing GFP-nsP2 and the V33E replicon, nsP2 stained positively 289 for MAR (Fig. 4f) . Taken together, we identified CHIKV nsP2 as a new substrate for MARylation 290 in vitro and in cells in context of a viral infection. 291 292\n\nHaving identified nsP2 as a new substrate for MARylation, we aimed at determining the 294 consequences of this modification on proteolytic activity. Therefore, we established a 295 protease assay using an nsP3/nsP4 junctional peptide (DELRLDRAGG|YIFSS) fused to GST and 296 EGFP ( Fig. 5a ) [50] [51] [52] . Accessibility between the two globular tags was achieved by including 297 a polylinker C-terminally of the cleavage site. This artificial substrate was cleaved by the 298 recombinant nsP2 protease with up to 90% processing observed after 120 min, but not by the 299 CASA proteolytically inactive mutant (Fig. 5b ). Of note is that neither the C-terminal EGFP 300 fragment (fragment 1) nor the N-terminal GST fragment (fragment 2) were further cleaved, 301 supporting the specificity of the protease activity. Both, the substrate and the two nsP2 302 variants were stable when analyzed individually over 120 min (Fig. 5b) . 303\n\nTo assess the role of MARylation, the nsP2 protease domain was modified by ARTD10cat. This 305 prevented cleavage of the substrate, while ARTD10cat-GW had no effect (Fig. 5c ). Successful 306\n\nMARylation of nsP2-459-798 is indicated by its mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5c ). The 307 inhibition of the protease function by ARTD10cat was dose dependent (Fig. 5d ). To interrogate 308 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

MARylation, which was evident in the presence of hydrolase either by the reduced mobility 311 shift or by staining with the MAR reagent, reactivated protease activity (Fig. 5e ). The 312 processing efficiency was quantified by measuring the intensity of unprocessed substrate and 313 the two fragments by immunoblotting and densitometric analysis. This documented that 314\n\nMARylation by ARTD10cat efficiently repressed nsP2-459-798 protease activity, which was 315 antagonized by nsP3 or the isolated macrodomain (Fig. 5e,f) . Thus, these findings demonstrate 316 that the nsP2 protease domain is reversibly inhibited by MARylation and support our initial 317 hypothesis that MARylation inhibits polyprotein processing. We provide a mechanism how 318 MARylation antagonizes and consequently how the nsP3 macrodomain contributes to CHIKV 319 replication. 320 321 Discussion 322\n\nTaken together, we established that ARTD10 and ARTD12 interfere with CHIKV RNA 323 replication and identified CHIKV nsP2 as target for MARylation by IFN-inducible mono-ARTDs. 324\n\nMechanistically, our results provide evidence for inhibition of the nsP2 protease function, 325 which is essential for viral replication, by ARTD10-dependent MARylation. This results in a 326 defect in CHIKV polyprotein processing and consequently in reduced replication. This 327\n\nMARylation-dependent inhibition of the protease activity is antagonized by the macrodomain 328 of nsP3. Accordingly, the lack of MAR hydrolase activity prevents polyprotein processing. Thus, 329 our findings elucidate a mechanism for the importance of a functional macrodomain for CHIKV 330 replication. 331 332 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In this context the 333 best studied ARTD family member is ARTD13 (ZAP, Zinc-finger antiviral protein), which is able 334 to bind viral RNA, promoting its decay or interfering with its translation [53] . Further, ARTD13, 335 which is catalytically inactive, contributes to the establishment of an antiviral immune 336 response by crosstalk with the miRNA pathway, thereby stimulating expression of antiviral 337 proteins, and by amplifying RIG-I signaling [53] . Antiviral activities have also been assigned to 338 ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14. Overexpression of these ARTDs was shown to interfere with 339 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication [7] . Additionally, ARTD12 was 340 described to restrict Sindbis Virus (SINV) and CHIKV replication amongst other RNA viruses [7] . 341\n\nFurther ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 downregulate cellular translation in cells infected with 342 VEEV, which in the case of ARTD12 depends on catalytic activity [8] . ARTD12 has also been 343 identified to restrict Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, which is mediated by depletion of the ZIKV 344 non-structural proteins NS1 and NS3 [26] . Dependent on its catalytic activity, ARTD12 seems 345 to promote poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of these two viral proteins. PAR chains in turn 346 are argued to serve as scaffold to recruit E3 Ubiquitin-ligases that modify NS1 and NS3 by K48-347 linked polyubiquitination and thereby enable their proteasomal degradation [26] . Indeed, this 348 concept has already been established for PARylation mediated by ARTD5 and 6 (tankyrase 1 349 and 2, respectively) [1]. More than 70 substrates have been identified to be regulated through 350 PAR-mediated poly-ubiquitination [54] . The proposed mechanism is that ARTD12, as it is 351 limited to MARylation, modifies NS1 and NS3, which serves as a seeding event for polymer 352 forming ARTDs, possibly ARTD5 or 6 [26] . However, the effect of MARylation on CHIKV 353 replication seems to be different as demonstrated by experiments with inhibitors of 354 proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in this study (Fig. 3a,b) . In addition to the ZIKV proteins, 355 the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus (CoV) was recently suggested to be ADP-ribosylated 356 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

It will be interesting to identify the enzyme that catalyzes this 357 modification and moreover to define the molecular consequences, for example on capsid 358 formation. 359\n\nIn summary, these different reports suggest that ADP-ribosylation may interfere with multiple 361 viral functions. This is consistent with the observation that at least four of the 12 catalytically 362 active mono-ARTDs are induced by type I IFNs (Supplementary Fig. 1a) [1, 6, 11 ].

Gileadi (Oxford) by gateway cloning. Constructs 506 for expression of eukaryotic fusion proteins of nsP2, nsP2-459-798, nsP3 and nsP3-macro 507 were cloned into pcDNA3-Flag, pHA, pEGFP-C1 or pcDNA5/FRT/TO-N-TAP with gateway 508 cloning using the SP6-CHIKV-replicon-SG-GLuc as a template. Mutants (except for replicon 509 mutants, see above) were generated using standard mutagenesis procedures (e.g. Q5 510 mutagenesis kit (NEB)) and confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3-HA-ARTD1 was a kind gift from 511 M.

Samples were 594 fractionated by SDS-PAGE and gels subsequently stained with Coomassie blue or subjected to 595 immunoblotting to visualize the proteins. 596 597\n\nHEK293 cells were seeded in 10 cm plates and 48 h after seeding transfected with plasmid 599 DNA coding for GFP-nsP2 using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique or not treated. \n\nImmunoblots were quantified using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, USA). The 636 significance was analyzed using a nonparametric, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test with the 637 GraphPad Prism software, since the number of values was too low to reliably test for Gaussian 638 distribution of the data. 639 640 641 .
