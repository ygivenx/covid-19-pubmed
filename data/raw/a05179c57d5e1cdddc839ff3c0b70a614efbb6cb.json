{"title": "Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm", "body": "coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.\n\nThe recently outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China has brought the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Currently there is urgent need to identify the hosts potentially infected by the 2019-nCoV viruses.\n\nLarge amounts of infectious viruses can be obtained from domesticated animals, birds, vector animals and environments. These viruses may pose a great threat to human since lots of viruses that are safe in animals may potentially infect human. In addition, owing to high mutation rate in viruses, there are also non-human-infectious viruses that are originally spread in animals, but mutate to infect human later (5) . Besides, any unexpected hosts of novel viruses are also concerning.\n\nTo detect the potential host and pathogenicity of new viruses, the conventional way is based on their sequence similarity to known viruses, by either building phylogenetic tree or blast. However, this method seems to be rudimentary with several limitations. In fact, owing to the intrinsic heterogeneity within genome, different sequence fragments of the novel virus may be assigned to quite different known viruses with identical similarity by local alignment, which consequently leads to the ambiguous predictions of the hosts of novel viruses. In addition, the routine method, phylogenetic tree analysis, always utilizes the whole genomes assembled by shotgun reads, which is . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Moreover, when the potential hosts of novel viruses were predicted from a phylogenetic perspective, people usually accepted the assumption that the viruses with closer phylogenetic relationships have common hosts, pathogenicity and infection behavior. However, this assumption has proved unsustainable, because the abilities of infecting human are varied even within genus and most viruses are harmless to human. For example, Betacoronavirus, a genus in Coronavirinae, containing both viruses that can infect human, such as SARS, and viruses that are not reported to infect human, such as Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9. Table 1, and Table S2 ). Besides, most of the reported human-infective Coronaviruses (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) are assigned the lowest p-values predicted by the VHP method (Table S1 ).\n\nThe similar probabilities of 2019-nCoV and other human Coronaviruses illustrates the high risk of 2019-nCoV. Part of the p-value results is shown in Table 1 , which is ranked by the decreasing order of the p-value for a virus to infect human.\n\nThe prediction results warn us that the 2019-nCoV have strong potential of infecting human similar to SARS, Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and MERS. While SARS was assigned slightly lower p-value on \"Human\", Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses were given closer p-value to 2019-nCoVs, which indicates that 2019-nCoV is probable to be less infectious within human than SARS but as infectious as Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses. Furthermore, we explore the reservoir of 2019-nCoVs with its infectivity pattern. As is shown in Table S3 , compared with the p-values of other host types, .

Besides, compared with the two Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses, 2019-nCoVs have 4, ~130, ~220 nonsynonymous SNPs on the three core genes respectively, which shows the differences among 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-like Coronaviruses.\n\nExcept for 2019-nCoVs, our predictions for all coronaviruses indicate that Night-heron coronavirus HKU19, which is reported to infect a vertebrate, Night-heron, also has the strong potential to infect human. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which usually circulate among animals which will cause fatal diseases, once they mutate and evolve to be able to infect human.

In order to develop a method expert in predicting the potential host types of novel viruses, the viral sequences data released before 2018 were used to build the training set, while those released after 2018 were utilized for testing. We integrated the hosts of viruses into five types, including plant, germ, invertebrate, vertebrate and human. The host subtypes contained in these five types are listed in Table 2 Medical College for genome sequencing sharing. We also acknowledge GISAID . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
