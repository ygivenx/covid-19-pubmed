{"title": "Molecular and clinical characterization of human adenovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children", "body": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) is considered as an important causative agent of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in children [1, 2] , and accounts for at least 5 to 10% of pediatric ARTI [3] . HAdV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Mastadenovirus genus (Adenoviridae family). There are currently seven different HAdV species (A to G), including 103 HAdV types (HAdV types up to type number 51 were defined as serotypes and higher type numbers were defined as genotypes) (http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/). HAdV-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14 and the re-emergent type HAdV-55 are known to cause ARTI [4] [5] [6] . Although HAdV is associated with mild to moderate disease in most cases, types 3 and 7 were increasingly reported [7, 8] associated with severe, and even life-threatening infections and outbreaks. Therefore, investigating the epidemiological and clinical manifestations of different types of HAdV infections is helpful to the prevention and control of HAdV circulating.\n\nPrevious studies have reported the adenoviral epidemiology in Beijing and Guangzhou, China [9, 10] . However, information on HAdV among hospitalized children with ARTI is limited in Hebei, China. To perfect molecular epidemiological and clinical information of HAdV infections, we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018.\n\nHospitalized children (< 18 years) with ARTI from Children's Hospital of Hebei Province from May 2017 to April 2018, were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Children with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection (such as fever, coughing, nasal obstruction, sneeze), or lower respiratory infection signs (tachypnea, dyspnea, or wheezing/rales upon auscultation etc.) were defined as ARTI. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was diagnosed by radiographic evidence (consolidation, other infiltrate or pleural effusion). Severe CAP was defined as an CAP that presented with one of the following clinical presentations: oxygen saturation < 92%, cyanosis; respiratory rate > 70 (infants) or 50 (older children) breaths/min; significant tachycardia for level of fever; prolonged central capillary refill time > 2 s; difficulty in breathing; intermittent apnoea (infants), grunting; not feeding (infants); chronic conditions (eg, congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease of prematurity, chronic respiratory conditions leading to infection such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, immune deficiency). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Children's Hospital of Hebei Province, affiliated to Hebei Medical University. Data records and collected clinical specimens were deidentified and completely anonymous so informed consent was waived.\n\nDemographic and clinical data were obtained from the hospital's database. The nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from each patient were extracted total nucleic acids using EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirteen common respiratory pathogens and subtypes (Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B), Influenza A H1N1 pdm09 (09H1), influenza H3N2 (H3), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), HAdV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronavirus (HCoV), Chlamydia (Ch) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp)) were detected by using a GeXP-based multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay [11] . HAdV-positive samples were molecularly typed by nested PCR amplification and sequencing that targeted hypervariable regions 1-6 of the hexon gene, as described previously [12] .\n\nMeanwhile, bronchial alveolar lavage fluids (if available), blood, and pleural effusion (if available) from HAdV-positive patients during the entire hospital admission were used to identify any bacteria or fungi.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical data were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. Categorical variables were evaluated by Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared by a Mann-Whitney test. All tests were two-tailed and the value of P < 0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant difference.\n\nA total of 8906 hospitalized children with ARTI at the Children's Hospital of Hebei Province, affiliated to Hebei Medical University were enrolled, and all children survived. Among those children, 5458 (61.28%) were males and 3448 (38.72%) were females (Table1). The age range was from 1 month to 18 years of age with a median age of 1.5 years. From them, 6955 (78.09%) patients were younger than 3 years old (Table 1) .\n\nAmong the 8906 children, 330 (3.71%) HAdV-positive cases were detected. And most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 3 years old. No significant differences were observed in males 209 (63.33%) and females 121 (36.67%) in the rate of HAdVpositive (P = 0.436). Children at age groups > 1 to \u2264 2 years had higher HAdV-positive rates than other age groups (P < 0.001) ( Table 1) . Low HAdV-positive rates were detected in October 2017 (2.28%) and January 2018 (2.39 %), while a peak positive rate occurred during March-April 2018 ( Fig.1 ).\n\nWe identified 11 HAdV types in 330 samples. HAdV-2 [33.33% (110/330)] was the most prevalent type, followed by HAdV-3 [21.52% (70/330)] and HAdV-7 [13.94% (46/330)] (Table 2) . Beside, 2 cases with multiple HAdV types (HAdV-2 and HAdV-3) were identified. HAdV-1 and 2 positive cases were more detected during February to Apirl, 2018; HAdV-3 was more prevalent during July to August, 2017 and November to December, 2017; HAdV-5 was more frequent in March, 2018 and HAdV-7 in November 2017. In contrast, HAdV-4, 6, 31, 41, 55 and 57 were sporadic detected during the study period (Fig. 1 ).\n\nOf the 330 HAdV-positive cases, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens including 163 (65.99%, 163/247) with one other pathogens, 74 (29.96%, 74/247) with two other pathogens, and 10 (4.05%, 10/247) with three other pathogens. The most frequently identified mixed infection was HRV (58.7%, 145/247), as shown in Table 3 . The median age of children with co-detection was 1.25 years and younger than children with single-detection (median age was 1.75 years, P = 0.032). Compared with HAdV-B positive cases, the mixed detection rate of HAdV-C was significantly higher (P = 0.001). Detailed co-detection distribution of different types was shown in Table 2 .\n\nAfter excluding 247 cases with co-detection, 2 cases with multiple types, 1 case diagnosed with bronchial foreign body and 1 case diagnosed with herpangina, demographic and clinical data of 79 cases were collected and shown in supplementary material S1. Fever, cough, and sore throat were the most common clinical features among different types. CAP was the most common diagnoses of the patients. 2 patients with HAdV-2 positive were admitted to PICU, 2 patients (1 with HAdV-1 positive and 1 with HAdV-3 positive) required respiratory support with mechanical ventilation, and 5 patients (2 with HAdV-2 positive, 1 with HAdV-3 positive and 2 with HAdV-7 positive) underwent immunoglobulin therapy. All HAdV-positive patients recovered fully from respiratory infections.\n\nBecause HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the most predominant types among patients with HAdV positive, the age and gender distribution, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings of patients with single HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 positive were further compared to exclude the possible effect of other respiratory pathogens infection. The HAdV-7 positive patients had a longer median duration of fever, followed the HAdV-3 positive patients and the HAdV-2 positive patients were shortest (P = 0.006). Runny nose was observed in 33.33% of HAdV-2 positive patients, 22.73% of HAdV-3 positive patients and only 5.56% of HAdV-7 positive patients (P = 0.008). HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 positive patients were more likely to experience sore throat (P = 0.015) and had higher leukocyte count (P = 0.048) than HAdV-2 positive patients. Underlying respiratory diseases were more frequently observed with the HAdV-3 positive patients (27.27%) and the HAdV-7 positive patients (11.11%) compared to HAdV-2 positive patients (0%) (P = 0.044). No significant differences were found in the age and gender distribution, complications and clinical outcomes when compared among the three HAdV types.\n\nHAdV is a common pathogen associated with ARTI in hospitalized children. Among our studied cohort, 3.71% of paediatric patients with ARTI exhibited HAdV positive, which is lower than the finding (5.64%) in Beijing [9] during the same period. Such discrepant HAdV detection rates were easy to be explained by different regions. Previous studies from Beijing and Guangzhou [9, 10] revealed that HAdV infections occurred throughout the year with the highest prevalence in the summer. However, a peak positive rate occurred during March-April in the present study, which is consistent with another study that has reported seasonal peak for HAdV infections in spring in Northern China [13] . We found that HAdV-positives cases detected predominantly (88.48%) in children under 3 years of age, with a peaking in children aged 1-2 years (P < 0.001), demonstrating that most children become infected by HAdV at an early age. A recent repeated cross sectional study [14] drew similar findings that the HAdV positive rate of children at the age of < 3 years was 63.51% and the rate of HAdV infection peaking in children aged l-3 years in Northern China (P = 0.021).\n\nHAdV -2, -3 and -7 are the most prevalent species in China [15, 16] , but the type distribution of HAdV varies for different regions and periods of studies. HAdV-7 was the most prevalent types from 2007 to 2012 in Beijing [17] , HAdV-3 dominated from 2017 to 2018 in Beijing [9] and from 2012 to 2013 in Guangzhou [8] . While throughout the present study period, HAdV-2 was the most prevalent type, followed by HAdV-3 and -7.\n\nHAdV-55 is a recombinant virus which has a genomic backbone of type 14 and a neutralization epitope of type 11, and once caused an outbreak of respiratory tract infection in Shanxi Province, China, in 2006 [18] . In the present study, a hexon sequence identical to type 55 was detected from a boy aged eight months. This boy diagnosed with CAP and presented with a ten-days of fever (Maximum temperature = 40\u00b0C), cough and sore throat, but no PICU admission, mechanical ventilation and immunoglobulin therapy required during the hospitalization period. Although this hexon sequence is also almost identical to type 11 which is not closely related to respiratory infections, it was thought as type 55 according to clinical feature of this boy. This is the first report of mono-detection of HAdV-55 in children with ARTI in Hebei Province, though HAdV-55 infection has been reported in other provinces in China [17, 19] .\n\nAnother notable finding of this study was the identifying of HAdV-57 in 4 respiratory samples. HAdV-57 was first isolated from the feces of a healthy child as part of an acute flaccid paralysis surveillance program. The detection of HAdV-57 in respiratory samples collected from pediatric patients with ARTI was first reported by a study from 2007 to 2012 in Beijing [17] . However, all the three HAdV-57-infected cases were co-infected with other respiratory viruses in their study. In this present study, HAdV-57 alone was identified in a previously healthy 10months girl who diagnosed with bronchitis requiring hospitalization. The girl not only presented with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection, including fever (Maximum temperature = 37.5\u00b0C), cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat and dyspnea, but also accompanied by vomiting. Unfortunately, the further HAdV detection on her stool sample was not performed.\n\nSimilar to the report from Beijing (69.6%), Nouthern China [17] , results here showed that 74.85% of HAdV were co-detected with one or more other respiratory tract pathogens and that coinfections were more frequently observed in younger children. Moreover, co-detection rates of different HAdV types varied, especially the co-detection rate of HAdV-C was significant higher than those of HAdV-B (P = 0.001). Nested PCR with a low limit of detection was used for typing of HAdV in the present study. Thus low level HAdV DNA shedding of latent HAdV infections could be detected, which may be explain the high rate of co-detection of HAdV-C with other pathogens.\n\nIn a recent study in Taiwan [15] , clinical features of HAdV-2, -3, and -7 mono-infections in children were investigated in an outbreak, and drawn a conclusion that childhood HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infections may exhibit different clinical manifestations and HAdV-7 caused more severe disease characteristics and outcomes. Similarly, through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates, a study in Chongqing [20] shown that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. Our results revealed that patients with HAdV-7 positive experienced longer durations of fever than HAdV-2 or HAdV-3 positive patients, which was consistent with the results reported by Taiwan [15] . However, although patients with HAdV-7 positive had a higher rate of severe CAP and tended to require longer hospital stays in our study, no significant difference was found. Meanwhile, no patients with HAdV-7 positive needed PICU admission and mechanical ventilation in our study. These results may not support the conclusion from previous investigations [15, 20] that HAdV-7 positive patients may have more severe clinical consequence.\n\nOne potential weakness of our data is that there was small sample size, since we have excluded the possible interference by any other coinfected respiratory pathogens. So, a larger sample size of case-control study is needed to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. Another limitation of this study is that typing of HAdV was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope. However, some genotypes share their neutralization epitope with one of the (sero-)types. Thus we cannot exclude completely that the hexon sequence though as type 55 was truly type 11 in this study.\n\nOur study reported the molecular epidemiology and clinical characterization of among the HAdV-positive pediatric hospitalized patients with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China in 2017-2018, providing reliable scientific basis for diagnosis, prevention and control for the future of HAdV infection in Hebei region.\n\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Table 3 Co-detection of HAdV with other respiratory pathogens."}
