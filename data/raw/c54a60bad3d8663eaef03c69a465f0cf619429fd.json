Probability of further disease spread is evaluated based on the threshold value to 3.9) using serial intervals for 424 patients in Wuhan, China 4 . Recalculation with 2033 cases based on the refined estimate from China. However, this is falling short in predicting the spread of the pandemic and expansion within individual locations, suggesting that R is not likely to be 109 constant and likely to be dynamic for each outbreak location that results in underestimates of 110 the spread rate. This limitation is hindering epidemic dynamics as previously noted due to the 111 parameter is context specific and dynamic 1,2 . Hence, there is a need to rapidly estimate country 112 specific R values during the epidemic. This will provide global comparisons of expansion at 113 each location.\n\nThe Wallinga and Teunis method for R estimation requires input of outbreak incidences and 115 the serial interval (i.e. the period between the manifestation of symptoms in the primary case 116 and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases) 6 . This approach was implemented in a web 117 resource to estimate R during epidemics 7 . A key advantage of the approach is the ease of 118 production of credible intervals compared to other maximum likelihood estimation approaches.\n\nYet to be done is integration of viral genetic variation with R estimates but one study found that 120 there was no obvious relationship between R, severity of the epidemic and COVID-19 genome 121 diversity 20 .\n\nCOVID-19 has reached global spread in all continents except Antarctica and was defined to produces new dynamics during the outbreak 13,14 . Rapidly evolving pathogens undergo genome 142 sequence mutation, selection pressure, random drift and stochastic events between infected 143 individuals 11 . Even small changes in the genome enable transmission that is determined by 144 accounting for the mutations between isolate sequences. It is recognized that the COVID-19 145 genome is changing over the outbreak but there is controversy about the impact and specifics of 146 the exact mutations. In this study, we used incidence data to derive R and compared country 147 specific COVID-19 infection dynamics with viral population genome diversity. By incorporating 148 R, epidemic curve timing, and viral genome diversity we created a systematic framework that 149 deduced how viral genome diversity can be used to describe epidemiological features of an 150 outbreak before new cases were observed. This was done by creating a genome diversity 151 metric that was directly and systematic integrated to provide context and allowed quantification 152 of the infection dynamics globally that are divergent from the early estimates with genomic 153 evidence. We call this approach pathogen genome identity (GENI) scoring system. Using GENI 154 differentiated each stage of the outbreak. It also indicated cryptic local transmission from 155 .

This a defining advantage of using sequences as previous cryptic 156 transmission can be inferred in the genomic sequences.\n\n(Baltimore, MD, USA) that was accessed on March 1, 2020 15 . We constructed epidemic curves 162 or epicurves from the incidence data and classified country status accordingly. We defined four 163 groups that characterize increasing expansion with a decline phase.\n\nThe extracted time series case data served as the input for determining instantaneous 165 reproductive number on a daily basis to effectively capture dynamic changes due to new 166 detected cases and reduction of cases due to social distancing and nonpharmaceutical 167 interventions. The prior value for R was selected at 2 and prior standard deviation of 5 to allow 168 fluctuations in reporting of cases in the exponential phase. As there is limited access to 169 epidemiological data of case, parametric with uncertainty (offset gamma) distributional estimate 170 of serial interval was used. A mean of 2 and 7 days, with standard deviation of 1 was used to 171 capture short and standard serial interval assumptions using 50 samplings of serial interval 172 distribution. The Wallinga and Teunis method, as implemented by Ferguson 7 is a likelihood-173 based estimation procedure that captures the temporal pattern of effective reproduction 174 numbers from an observed epidemic curve. R was calculated using the web application 175 EpiEstim App (https://shiny.dide.imperial.ac.uk/epiestim/) 7 . The descriptive statistics were used 176 to compute mean and confidence intervals of the instantaneous reproductive number.\n\nGENI score was anchored on the principle of rapid pathogen evolution between 178 transmission events. This requires defining a suitable reference sequence of the outbreak, 179 which is on the early stages the sequence nearest to the timepoint of the index case. For the 180 case of COVID-19, the reference sequence is Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate 181 Wuhan-Hu-1 NC_045512.2 16 .

We calculated the average nucleotide 185 change per month to be 1.7 (95% CI 1.4-2.0), which was within boundaries of another estimate 186 with the substitution rate of 0.9 \u00d7 10 -3 (95% CI 0.5-1.4 \u00d7 10 -3 ) substitutions per site per year 20 .\n\nWe derived a transformed value of this rate before integrating it with epidemiological 188 information. The output from the variant calling step was then used to determine GENI score by 189 calculating the nucleotide difference. The basis for GENI score cutoffs to estimate transmission 190 dates are derived from accepted evolutionary inference of mutation rates of COVID-19.\n\nWe defined four epidemic curve (epicurves) stages to provide a clear method to define 192 increases in the outbreak. The 'index stage' is characterized by the first report (index case) or 193 limited local transmission indicated by intermittent zero incidence creating undulating epicurve. Secondly, which is distinctly different from stage 1, is the 'takeoff stage' in which the troughs are in part but other factors may contribute to this observation (Figure 3b ). This significantly 235 increased the instantaneous R estimates versus other methods of estimation but allows a more 236 obvious depiction of the surge of cases allows differentiation of the takeoff stage from 237 exponential stage.\n\nWe further examined the value of computing country-specific instantaneous R by 239 comparing different temperature range (tropical versus temperate) and population density.\n\nPopulation density of key cities (Table 2) \n\nWe determined the relationship of epicurve stage with viral genetic variation using a 253 metric that merges absolute genome variation with the rate of genome change to create the 254 GENI metric that anchored population genome diversity with the rate of evolution for the SARS-255 Cov-2. To examine how the viral genome diversity was associated with the epicurve stages we 256 first examined the index stage (Singapore) and the exponential (South Korea). Integration of 257 GENI scores successfully distinguished the index from exponential stage (Figure 4 ). An 258 increase in GENI scores was associated with exponential stage with a median score of 4, 259 suggesting that the viral diversity and rate of mutation played was directly proportional to case 260 .

The 289 instantaneous R estimation with a serial interval of 2 was extremely sensitive to shifts in the 290 epicurve during the index phase (Fig 2-3) . Singapore is an excellent example of effectively 291 controlling and containing the COVID-19 outbreak. They previously designated a response 292 system called Dorscon (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) 22 providing a 293 systematic approach to control so that they have not moved past the index phase. In contrast, 294 most other countries in this phase are poised to move into the takeoff phase (Fig 3) . The 295 transition into the takeoff phase signified a transition from a 2-day serial interval to a 7-day serial 296 interval that was more sensitive to shifts in the epicurve.\n\nWhile estimates of R alone is insightful in retrospect, gaps in epidemiological surveillance 298 due to several factors creates blind spots that hindered the ability to determine interventions. To 299 overcome this limitation, we merged GENI estimates based on whole genome sequence 300 variation and mutation rate with the epicurve and R and provided a predictive triad of 301 measurement that resulted in insight that accurately refined case expansion (Fig. 4) .
