{"title": "CRISPR-based surveillance for COVID-19 using genomically-comprehensive machine learning design", "body": "A novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (family: Coronaviridae ), is the virus behind a severe outbreak originating in China [1] . SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to slowing widespread transmission. In January 2020, we quickly made available a capture enrichment panel [2] using CATCH [3] that is aimed at enhancing sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Capture has also been important for ongoing SARS-like coronavirus surveillance [4] , and the panel's inclusion of SARS-like bat and pangolin coronaviruses can aid surveillance efforts.\n\nThere are several challenges associated with surveillance during the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. First, high case counts overwhelm diagnostic testing capacity, underscoring the need for a rapid pipeline for sample processing [5, 6] . Second, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus subspecies and species, so detection assays can yield false positives if they are not exquisitely specific to SARS-CoV-2. Third, suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or have co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses [7] . Therefore, it is important to characterize these other pathogens, for both patient diagnostics and outbreak response.\n\nHere, we help address the challenge of identifying SARS-CoV-2 and the numerous other respiratory viral pathogens by reporting a set of comprehensive design options for 67 species and subspecies for CRISPR-based detection assays. We have not yet experimentally tested most of these designs, instead focusing our efforts so far on extensively testing a point-of-care assay for SARS-CoV-2 using the Cas13-based SHERLOCK technology [6, 8, 9] . Using this assay, we demonstrate sensitive detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 10 copies per microliter.\n\nWe have been developing algorithms and machine learning models for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays, linked in a system called ADAPT (manuscript in preparation). The designs satisfy several constraints, including on: \u2022 Comprehensiveness : Assays account for a high fraction of known sequence diversity in their species or subspecies (>97% for most assays), and are meant to be effective against variable targets. \u2022 Predicted sensitivity : Assays are predicted by our machine learning model to have high detection activity against the full scope of targeted genomic diversity (here, based on Lwa Cas13a activity only). \u2022 Predicted specificity : Assays have high predicted specificity to their species or subspecies, factoring in the full extent of known strain diversity, allowing them to be grouped into panels that are accurate in differentiating between related taxa.\n\nComprehensiveness and-to some extent-specificity of the designs can be verified in silico .\n\nUsing ADAPT we designed 67 assays, satisfying the above constraints, to identify: the SARS-related coronavirus species; SARS-CoV-2; two other subspecies in that species with high similarity to SARS-CoV-2; all other known Coronaviridae species, including 4 other species that commonly cause human illness; and other common respiratory viral species and subspecies ( Table 1 ) . Each assay targets a single species or subspecies and can be used individually (e.g., point-of-care detection); additionally, owing to how they are designed, multiple assays can be grouped together to test for multiple targets and distinguish them with high specificity.\n\nSequences for single assays and multiplex panels are available at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/ . Table 1 . A summary of the species and subspecies constituting the 67 designs at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/ . SARS-CoV-2 is designed to exclude detection of the highly similar RaTG13 sequence, and other similar bat and pangolin SARS-like coronaviruses; the SARS-like subspecies includes most bat and pangolin SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\nWe initially screened a set of 4 designs for SHERLOCK [6, 8, 9] assays, output by ADAPT to detect SARS-CoV-2. We identified an assay, which was the best-performing and also our highest ranked design a priori . We extensively tested this assay using a synthetic RNA target and determined the limit of detection to be 10 copies/\u00b5l using both fluorescent and lateral flow detection ( Figure 1 ). This assay performs well in comparison to the recently disclosed DETECTR [10] assay (sensitivity: 70-300 cp/\u00b5l) [11] and SHERLOCK assay (10-100 cp/\u00b5l) [12] for SARS-CoV-2. A protocol for performing this assay is provided in the Methods section and can be used for testing any of the other designs we have provided. \n\nOngoing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing is key to developing and monitoring diagnostics and similar surveillance tools. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, genomes have been generated and shared at a remarkable pace, and we thank those who have contributed their data through GISAID [13]. We and others, relying on this data [14] , have shown that it is possible to rapidly design CRISPR-based tools for detection and surveillance during an outbreak.\n\nAmong other goals for this work, we plan to evaluate: (1) sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 assay against clinical isolates and patient samples-including sputum, throat, and nasal swabs-some of which may be challenging sample types to test; (2) specificity at both the species and subspecies levels against highly related viruses. For the latter, we intend to use a mixture of synthetic targets reflecting different viral sequences, and patient samples or viral seedstocks when available. We hope that the comprehensiveness and high predicted sensitivity and specificity of our designs will enable many groups to proceed rapidly and successfully from assay testing through deployment.
