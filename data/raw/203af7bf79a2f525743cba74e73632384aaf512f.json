{"title": "A human coronavirus OC43 variant harboring persistence-associated mutations in the S glycoprotein differentially induces the unfolded protein response in human neurons as compared to wild-type virus", "body": "Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses and known respiratory pathogens (Talbot et al., 2008) with neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties (Arbour et al., 2000; Bonavia et al., 1997) . Indeed, we reported that the OC43 strain (HCoV-OC43) could infect and persist in human neural cell lines (Arbour et al., 1999) , and infect primary human and murine central nervous system (CNS) cultures (Bonavia et al., 1997; Jacomy et al., 2006) . Moreover, neurons were the main target of infection in the murine CNS , as well as in human co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes (M. Desforges and P.J. Talbot, unpublished data) . Furthermore, HCoV-OC43 induced a chronic encephalitis in susceptible mice , HCoV RNA was detected in human brains (Arbour et al., 2000) and HCoV-OC43 was associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Yeh et al., 2004) . Considering that murine hepatitis virus, MHV, the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43, causes neurological disease in mice (Buchmeier et al., 1987) , we hypothesized that HCoV-OC43 might be associated with some human neurological diseases.\n\nIn several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Imaizumi et al., 2001) and Parkinson's disease (PD) (Imai et al., 2000) , neuronal death has been linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Defects in neuronal ER function can lead to accumulation of misfolded proteins and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), usually leading to the recovery of ER homeostasis (Ron and Walter, 2007) . On the other hand, impaired UPR activation was recently associated with human neurological diseases (Antony et al., 2007; Lindholm et al., 2006; Paschen, 2003) .\n\nSo far, three pathways have been identified to play a role in the UPR, namely ATF6, PERK/eIF2-alpha and IRE1/XBP1 (Ron and Walter, 2007) . These pathways are activated when the UPR regulatory protein, GRP78, is delocalized from its inhibitory sites on the ERstress-sensor proteins, ATF6, PERK and IRE1 (Ron and Walter, 2007) .\n\nATF6 is a major transcriptional factor that leads to upregulation of chaperones involved in the recovery of ER protein folding capacity (Ron and Walter, 2007) . PERK is activated following homodimerization and plays a major role in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2-alpha (Shi et al., 1998) . IRE1 is an endoribonuclease and kinase which undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation, leading to its activation following UPR induction (Tirasophon et al., 1998; Tirasophon et al., 2000; Yoshida et al., 2001) . IRE1 is responsible for the unconventional splicing of Xbp1(u) mRNA by excising an 26-nucleotide intron, yielding the Xbp1(s) mRNA form (Yoshida et al., 2001) . Xbp1(s) is translated into a transcription factor, XBP1, which translocates to the nucleus (Yoshida et al., 2001) . XBP1 induces the expression of genes related to proteasomal degradation of proteins (Yamamoto et al., 2004) . XBP1 may also promote the expression of the genes Grp94, an ER chaperone (Yamamoto et al., 2004) , and Chop (Lee et al., 2003) . XBP1 is also Virology 395 (2009) [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] [266] [267] known to solely induce the expression of P58-ipk, an inhibitor of PERK kinase activity (Lee et al., 2003) , preventing its ability to phosphorylate eIF2-alpha.\n\nThe UPR has been shown to be induced by a number of viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (Isler et al., 2005) , herpes simplex virus (Cheng et al., 2005) , hepatitis C virus (Tardif et al., 2002) , Japanese encephalitis virus (Yu et al., 2006) , Borna disease virus (Williams and Lipkin, 2006) , Dengue virus (Umareddy et al., 2007) , SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006) and MHV (Bechill et al., 2008) . Various viruses have evolved different strategies to modulate its activation and/or benefit from it. Interestingly, the S proteins of the coronaviruses MHV (Versteeg et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006) were shown to induce UPR within cells. Even though the involvement of the coronavirus S protein in neurovirulence (Phillips et al., 1999) and the UPR in neurological diseases (Lindholm et al., 2006) have been suggested, no studies have, to our knowledge, been performed to identify specific amino acid residues within the S protein which would differ between coronavirus variants and correlate with an increased neurovirulence and UPR activation.\n\nConsequently, UPR activation within human neurons following infection by HCoV-OC43 was examined in the human neuronal models, the NT2-N (Pleasure and Lee, 1993) and the LA-N-5 (Hill and Robertson, 1998) , in order to study pathways that might ultimately be involved in coronavirus-induced neurological diseases. Two HCoV-OC43 point mutations that reproducibly appeared upon persistent infection of human neural cell lines (H183R and Y241H) were introduced into an infectious cDNA clone (St-Jean et al., 2006) and generated an HCoV-OC43 variant which induced an increased UPR within infected human neurons, an interesting fact as this variant showed enhanced neurovirulence in mice (H. Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication).\n\nHuman differentiated neuronal cell lines were susceptible to a productive HCoV-OC43 infection\n\nAs we have previously shown that neurons are the main target of HCoV-OC43 infection in the mouse CNS (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) and in NT2-N/human primary astrocytes co-cultures (M. Desforges and P. J. Talbot, unpublished data), we sought to study the early cellular events occurring in human neurons after HCoV-OC43 infection. First, we evaluated the susceptibility of the two wellcharacterized differentiated human neuronal cell lines NT2-N (Pleasure and Lee, 1993) and LA-N-5 (Hill and Robertson, 1998) to HCoV-OC43 (ATCC strain) infection. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the neuronal nature of the cells, as revealed by the detection of specific neuronal markers, NFM for LA-N-5 and \u03b2-tubIII for NT2-N (Fig. 1A , panels a and b), and their susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection was demonstrated by the detection of viral antigens (Fig. 1A , panels c and d). Furthermore, the infection was shown to be productive, as demonstrated by the increase in infectious HCoV-OC43 progeny virions in cell culture medium over a period of 72 h postinfection (Fig. 1B) .\n\nIn order to study the early cellular events occurring in human neurons following HCoV-OC43 infection, we investigated the transcriptomic profile of neurons at 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection, as compared to mock-infected cells. Total RNA of NT2-N cells was extracted and linearly amplified mRNAs were hybridized on microarray chips representing 22,000 human transcripts. Considering that Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP do not incorporate at the same rate during the amplification stage, we performed duplicate microarray experiments in dye-swap to prevent label-bias in analysis (Tseng et al., 2001) . Results of internal chip controls showed a correlation of more than 95% compared to their expected modulation, confirming the reliability of our modulation results (data not shown). We identified a total of 275 genes, the expression of which was significantly modulated at 24, 48 and/or 72 h post-infection, in at least two independent infections, with a maximum p-value of 0.05. The transcriptomic profile showed a diversity in the modulation of expression of genes that we grouped into nine major cellular functional groups (Fig. 2) .\n\nInfection of both NT2-N and LA-N-5 human neurons by HCoV-OC43 led to the modulation of expression of a subset of genes related to the unfolded protein response Analysis of the transcriptomic profile revealed a modulation of expression of several genes in the Biosynthesis and Degradation functional group (Fig. 2) that are related to the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can be activated by different types of stress, including viral infection. The UPR occurring in human neurons is also associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (Imaizumi et al., 2001) and Parkinson's disease (Imai et al., 2000) . Moreover, some studies also indicated that ER stress induced in neurons might underlie the neuropathological mechanisms leading to neuronal injury (Paschen, 2001) . Therefore, we sought to analyze the activation of the three UPR pathways, namely ATF6, PERK/eIF2-alpha and IRE1/XBP1. First, the modulation of expression of genes related to the UPR revealed by our microarray experiments, was confirmed by quantitative PCR in both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells. Total RNA was reversetranscribed before performing real-time quantitative PCR, using primers specific to each gene of interest (Supplementary data 1). Our results showed a high correlation between the NT2-N and LA-N-5 neuronal models in the modulation of expression of UPR-related genes following HCoV-OC43 infection ( Table 1 ). The degree of induction (fold-induction) in the expression of the Atf4, Erdj3, Erdj4, Gadd34, Grp78 and Grp94 genes clearly indicated a significant similarity between the response of both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells, establishing a relevant consistency between the two models (Table 1) . Moreover, even though there were some differences in the degree of induction of gene expression in the two cell lines for the Chop, Edem, Herp, P58-ipk and Xbp1 genes, an upregulation was always observed over the time-course of HCoV-OC43 infection (Table 1) . Indeed, the trend in the modulation of expression of these genes followed the same pattern in both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells, which again revealed a consistency in the state of activation of the underlying pathways.\n\nA recombinant HCoV-OC43 used to study the impact of the S glycoprotein on UPR activation showed increased viral replication within infected neurons but no difference in the kinetics of replication in cell culture, as compared to HCoV-OC43 wild-type Previous studies have reported that the S protein of coronaviruses can alone induce the UPR within cells (Chan et al., 2006; Versteeg et al., 2007) . Consequently, we sought to determine whether a HCoV-OC43 variant harboring mutations within the S protein related to enhanced neurovirulence in mice (H. Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication), could differentially induce the UPR in human neurons, compared to the so-called HCoV-OC43 wild-type, which we obtained several years ago from the ATCC. Two point mutations (H183R and Y241H) identified in the S protein of a HCoV-OC43 variant obtained from persistently infected human neural cell lines were introduced into the HCoV-OC43 genome using our fulllength cDNA clone pBAC-OC43 FL (St-Jean et al., 2006) , yielding a recombinant virus which we designated HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Before analyzing the effects of these mutations on UPR activation, we sought to determine whether both viruses showed similar kinetics of replication and dissemination in cell culture. The production of extraand intra-cellular infectious viral particles was evaluated at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection. No differences in extra-cellular infectious titers were observed between HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 3A, left panel) . However, a significant increase in the production of intra-cellular infectious viral particles was noted for HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 as compared to HCoV-OC43 wild-type (Fig. 3A , right panel). Moreover, cells infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 produced more viral S proteins, as shown by flow cytometry at 24 h post-infection ( Fig. 3C ) and by immunofluorescence revealed by microscopic observation (Fig. 3B ). We then assessed the percentage of infected cells at 4, 16 and 24 h post-infection by flow cytometry and found that there were no differences between the two viruses in their spread in the neuronal cultures, as the percentage of infected cells was not significantly different (Fig. 3D ). Globally, our data indicate that the two viruses have the same capacity to release infectious particles in the cell medium and that their kinetics of dissemination within neuronal cultures were comparable. However, we did observe a significant increase in the amount of viral proteins and infectious viral particles within cells infected by the variant HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 .\n\nThe ATF6 pathway in human neurons is functional and was activated by thapsigargin but not by infection with HCoV-OC43 wild-type and the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant In order to decipher which branches of the UPR were activated after infection, the ATF6 pathway was first examined as it is involved in the expression of ER chaperones, leading to an increase of protein folding capacity of the cell. During the course of UPR, ATF6 is cleaved within the Golgi, leading to the appearance of ATF6 transcriptional factors, which are translocated to the nucleus where they mainly bind cis-acting ER stress-response element (ERSE) (Okada et al., 2002) . As the Grp78 gene is a major target of ATF6 and a central effector of the UPR, its expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR to determine the degree of activation of the ATF6 pathway. Infection of neurons with HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not result in any significant modulation of the expression of Grp78 (Fig. 4A ). On the other hand, infection with HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 did result in a 3-fold transient increase of Grp78 expression (Fig. 4A ). The level of expression of the corresponding GRP78 protein was examined by Western blotting but no significant difference in the expression of the GRP78 protein between mock-infected cells and infected cells by either HCOV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 was detected (Fig. 4B ) . Thapsigargin-treated cells were used a positive control and did demonstrate the capacity of the neuronal cells to express GRP78 following activation of the UPR (Fig. 4B ). As Grp78 is the major gene modulated by the ATF6 pathway of the UPR, our data indicate that the ATF6 pathway is functional in the LA-N-5 cells but that it did not play a significant role in the UPR induced by infection with either virus.\n\nInfection of human neurons with the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant led to a stronger protein synthesis attenuation compared to infection with HCoV-OC43 wild-type\n\nAnother UPR pathway potentially activated following ER stress is PERK/eIF2-alpha. The ER sensor PERK induces the phosphorylation of the eIF2-alpha translation initiation factor in order to reduce total protein synthesis. As other coronaviruses are known to induce eIF2alpha phosphorylation and attenuation of protein synthesis (Bechill et al., 2008) , we investigated whether HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 could do the same. Western blot analysis showed that eIF2-alpha was only transiently phosphorylated at 24 h postinfection by both viruses and that the phosphorylation state of eIF2alpha then returned to its basal level within 48 h post-infection, as compared to mock-infected cells (Fig. 5A ). The use of thapsigargintreated cells indicated that eIF2-alpha could indeed be phosphorylated in neurons during the activation of the UPR (Fig. 5A ).\n\nThe total neuronal translational activity was determined by [ 35 S] cystein/methionine incorporation into proteins to determine whether the transient phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha could lead to an attenuation of mRNA translation. Strikingly, no significant decrease in protein translation was observed following infection by both viruses at 24 h post-infection, as compared to mock-infected cells, as revealed by autoradiographic gel and quantified after TCA precipitation ( Fig. 5B and 5C). The three intense bands present only in infected-cells, which likely correspond to the viral S, N and M proteins, showed a stronger expression in cells infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 at 24 h post-infection, which correlates with our observations of intra-cellular infectious viral titers (Fig. 3A) , immunofluorescence ( Fig. 3B ) and flow cytometry (Figs. 3C and D). Thapsigargin-treated cells served as a positive control of protein synthesis inhibition, demonstrating that repression of mRNA translation could indeed occur in neurons. Staining of the gel with Coomassie blue was used as a loading control (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that translational repression observed after 24 h post-infection was not a consequence Fig. 4 . The ATF6 pathway was not activated following infection of human neurons with HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant. LA-N-5 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant for 24, 48 or 72 h, or incubated in presence of 2 \u03bcM of thapsigargin for 6, 12, 18 or 24 h. (A) Grp78 gene expression analysis. Total RNA extracted was reverse-transcribed and mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR compared to mock-infected cells. Gapdh expression was used for normalization. Statistical significance: \u204ep b 0.05; \u204e\u204ep b 0.01; \u204e\u204e\u204ep b 0.0001. (B) GRP78 protein expression analysis. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibody directed against GRP78. GAPDH served as a loading control. Thapsigargin-treated samples served as a positive control. 5 . Infection of human neurons with the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant led to a stronger protein translation attenuation, as compared to HCoV-OC43 wild-type. The LA-N-5 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 for 24, 48 or 72 h, or incubated in the presence of 2 \u03bcM of thapsigargin for 2 h. (A) eIF2-alpha phosphorylation-state analysis. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibody directed against Ser52-phosphorylated eIF2alpha. Total eIF2-alpha served as a loading control. Thapsigargin-treated samples served as a positive control. (B and C) Protein synthesis analysis. Cell cultures were starved for cysteine and methionine for 30 min, then incubated with 35 S-radiolabeled cysteine/methionine for 15 min and harvested. Whole cell lysates were assayed for cpm (C) counts and resolved on a 4-12% polyacrylamide gel (B). Thapsigargin-treated cells served as a translational shutoff control. (D) Cell viability assay. Cell cultures were incubated with the MTS/PMS solution and absorbance was read at 492 nm. Cell viability is expressed as a relative percentage compared to mock-infected cells. Statistical significance:\n\nof an activated PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway. Moreover, translation attenuation started only at 72 h post-infection for HCoV-OC43 wildtype, in comparison to 48 h post-infection for HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . These results demonstrate that only two point mutations in the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can result in a different kinetics of total protein synthesis attenuation following infection.\n\nIn order to confirm that the observed protein synthesis attenuation was not a consequence of cell death, cell viability was assessed. Data at 48 and 72 h post-infection showed that this attenuation preceded the loss of cell viability (Figs. 5C and D), suggesting that the reduction of protein synthesis preceded cell death and therefore was not only its consequence.\n\nInfection of human neurons with the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant led to a stronger activation of the expression of genes Chop and Gadd34, compared to infection with HCoV OC43 wild-type\n\nConsidering the transient phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha (Fig. 5A) , the activation of related UPR factors was examined. Atf4 mRNA is known to be preferentially translated into a transcription factor when eIF2-alpha is phosphorylated . Considering that the ATF4 protein regulates the expression of the Gadd34 and Chop genes, respectively involved in the dephosphorylation of eIF2-alpha (Novoa et al., 2001) and in the induction of apoptosis (Matsumoto et al., 1996; Zinszner et al., 1998) , the potential modulation of expression of these genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Our results revealed clear differences in the kinetics of induction of the Chop gene expression after infection with HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 6A) . Chop was strongly induced at 48 h post-infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 and its expression decreased at 72 h post-infection. On the other hand, infection with HCoV-OC43 wild-type led to a constantly increasing level of the Chop gene up to 72 h post-infection, but to a lower level than for HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Even though Gadd34 expression is also considered to be regulated by ATF4, its expression followed a different kinetics. Both HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced the upregulation of Gadd34, which expression gradually increased up to 72 h postinfection (Fig. 6A) , with a more pronounced induction after infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Even though there was no significant level of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig.  5A) , the level of expression of the ATF4 protein was evaluated to determine whether the expression of the Chop and Gadd34 genes could be linked to this protein. We were not able to detect any expression of the ATF4 protein following infection by both viruses (Fig. 6B) . The level of expression of the CHOP and GADD34 proteins was then assessed to verify whether the observed increase in expression of the corresponding gene led to an increase in the amount of the corresponding protein. Strikingly, no increase in the CHOP protein was observed even though we observed a 50-fold increase in gene expression at 48 h post-infection by HCoV OC43 rOC/ U S183-241 , compared to mock-infected cells. On the other hand, a slight increase in the amount of GADD34 protein could be detected at 72 h after infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . Thapsigargin-treated cells were used as a positive control to demonstrate that neurons could indeed be induced to up-regulate expression of these proteins.\n\nOur results indicate again that two mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43 led to a different kinetics of induction of the UPR.\n\nThe IRE1/XBP1 pathway was differentially activated following infection of human neurons by the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant, as compared to infection with HCoV-OC43 wild type\n\nThe IRE1/XBP1 pathway was then studied to complete the portrait of the UPR induced in human neurons after infection with HCoV-OC43. Following its activation by ER stress, IRE1 induces an unconventional splicing of Xbp1(u) mRNA, producing the Xbp1(s) form lacking 26 nucleotides (Yoshida et al., 2001) , which leads to translation of the transcriptional factor XBP1, that binds to ERSE, ERSE-II and UPR element (UPRE) (Yamamoto et al., 2004) within the Fig. 8 . Infection of human neurons by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 led to a strong activation of caspase-3 and nuclear fragmentation following strong UPR activation. Detection of activation of caspase-3 and nuclear fragmentation within neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 . (A) Immunofluorescence of LA-N-5 differentiated into human neurons infected with HCoV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 showing HCoV-OC43 S protein (red), caspase-3 activation (green), their colocalization in merged image (yellow) and nuclear fragmentation by DAPI (blue). Arrows indicate example of infected cells with activated caspase-3. Arrowheads show example of cells with intense fragmented nucleus. Staurosporine-treated samples served as a positive control. (B) Quantification of cells showing nuclear fragmentation. Data are presented as a percentage of cells with nuclear fragmentation compared to total cells in the field. Each quantification represents the mean of 5 fields containing at least 100 cells. Statistical significance: \u204ep b 0.001.\n\npromoter of a series of specific genes. Consequently, XBP1 is involved in the expression of ERAD-related genes, such as Edem and Herp (Kim et al., 2008; Olivari et al., 2006) , chaperones such as Grp94 (Lee et al., 2003) , and P58 ipk (Lee et al., 2003; van Huizen et al., 2003) , an inhibitor of eIF2-alpha phosphorylation.\n\nAs our microarray results revealed a modulation of these four genes that are under the control of XBP1, the potential modulation of their expression was confirmed by quantitative PCR following infection by HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 7A ). Our results also showed clear differences in the kinetics of induction of these genes by the two viruses. Expression of the Edem, Herp, Grp94 and P58-ipk genes was induced within 24 h postinfection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241, and decreased at 72 h postinfection. On the other hand, HCoV-OC43 wild-type infection led to a continuous but lower increase over the course of infection, at least up to 72 h post-infection. This led us to assess the increase of Xbp1(s) mRNA by quantitative PCR, with primers spanning the 26-nucleotide intron (Hirota et al., 2006) , and measure the increase of the Xbp1(s) mRNA concurrently to the decrease of the Xbp1(u) form by RT-PCR, with primers flanking the 26-nucleotide intron (Hirota et al., 2006) (Figs. 7A and B). Our results clearly showed a strong increase in the Xbp1(s) form at 24 and 48 h after infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 , followed by a subsequent decrease. On the other hand, infection by HCoV-OC43 wild-type resulted in a constant but slower increase in the amount of Xbp1(s) form over the course of the infection, at least up to 72 h post-infection. The kinetics of Xbp1(u) cleavage correlated with the upregulation of expression of the four XBP1-controlled genes that we analyzed after infection by both viruses (Fig. 7A) , and indicated an unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway.\n\nMoreover, Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of the Grp94 gene, which can be under the control of XBP1, led to a significant increase in the amount of its corresponding protein within neurons following infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 7B) . Thapsigargin-treated cells were used as a positive control to confirm that the LA-N-5 neurons could indeed be induced to express this protein. Altogether, our data demonstrate again that only two mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can lead to a different kinetics and amplitude of UPR activation.\n\nInfections of human neurons by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 led to a strong activation of caspase-3 and nuclear fragmentation following a stronger UPR activation Following the deciphering of the UPR induced by HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 , we investigated whether the latter could lead to increased neuronal death by apoptosis following a stronger UPR activation. Caspase-3 and nuclear fragmentation are hallmarks of apoptosis and were shown to be induced following virus-induced UPR (Medigeshi et al., 2007) . We assayed the activation of caspase-3 by immunofluorescence at 48 h post-infection, a time where we observed the most significant differences in UPR activation and protein synthesis rate between the two viruses ( Fig. 8) .\n\nAt 48 h post-infection, neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not exhibit significant differences in caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation compared to mock-infected cells. In contrast, most of the neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 showed intense activation of caspase-3, as well as nuclear fragmentation. Indeed, quantification of apoptotic cells support our conclusion that neurons Fig. 9 . Model depicting the activation of the normal UPR and possible modulation of the different pathways by the HCoV-OC43 S protein in human neuronal cells. The IRE1/XBP1 pathway is strongly and rapidly activated by the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 mutant while its activation is less intense and slower by HCoV-OC43 ATCC. Target genes of XBP1, e.g. Grp94, P58-ipk and Edem, are expressed following the appearance of the Xbp1 S spliced form. The ATF6 pathway is thought to play a minor role, if any, in the UPR activated by both viruses. Indeed, its well known major target gene, Grp78, is merely expressed and no expression upregulation of the GRP78 protein is observed in both infection. The PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway is only transiently activated by both viruses in the first 24 h post-infection although HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced a strong translational protein shutoff starting at 48 h post-infection. However, no ATF4 protein was found during the course of infections by both viruses, even though Chop and Gadd34 gene were expressed. This could be explained by the expression of ATF3, also known to regulate their expression. Acronyms. IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PERK: PKR-like ER kinase; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; Xbp1 U : X-box binding protein mRNA unspliced form; Xbp1 S : X-box binding protein mRNA spliced form; ATF4: activating transcription factor 4; ATF3: activating transcription factor 3; eIF2\u03b1: \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2. infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 exhibited more nuclear fragmentation than mock-infected or HCoV-OC43-infected cells (Fig.  8B ). Cells treated for 24 h with staurosporine, a common apoptosis inducer, served as a positive control. Moreover, cells experiencing intense activation of caspase-3 following HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 infection were also positive for viral antigens and nuclear fragmentation. Altogether, our results showed that HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation, two common apoptosis markers, as early as 48 h p.i., whereas HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not show any significant activation of either compared to mock-infected cells.\n\nThe complete transcriptomic profile of human neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 revealed the modulation of expression of 275 genes among which many are known to be related to the activation of the UPR. Making use of a mutant virus harboring persistence-associated mutations in the S glycoprotein, we sought to evaluate the role of the HCoV-OC43 S protein on the UPR and neuronal viability. Altogether, our results demonstrate that only two point mutations in the S protein influence the activation of the UPR by HCoV-OC43 and shed light on the importance of discrete molecular determinants in the genome of HCoV-OC43 in the activation of the UPR in human neurons and induction of neuronal death.\n\nOur results establish the relevance of two human neuronal models, NT2 and LA-N-5, to study early events occurring in human neurons following infection by HCoV-OC43. These cells are of particular interest since primary human neurons are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantity and quality for in vitro studies. Moreover, as coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV, have been associated with neurological diseases in mice (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003; Netland et al., 2008) and potentially in humans (Arbour et al., 2000; Gu et al., 2005) , these two neuronal models are useful to study the neuronal response to infection in the context of potential human neuropathologies.\n\nOverall, our microarray results provide an overview of gene diversity associated with different molecular pathways that could be modulated in human neurons infected by a human coronavirus. Among the global transcriptomic modulation, several genes are associated with the translation machinery, neurotransmission, immunity and cytoskeleton factors. One important group of genes that attracted our attention was related to the biosynthesis and degradation functional group (Fig. 2) and more precisely associated with the process of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has already been shown to be induced by other coronaviruses, such as MHV (Bechill et al., 2008) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006; Sung et al., 2009) . Considering the numerous studies suggesting an association of neurological diseases with the activation of ER stress (Lindholm et al., 2006; Paschen, 2003) , it is of importance to study the induction of the UPR in a human neuronal model by a virus which has been associated with neurological diseases (Arbour et al., 2000; Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) .\n\nThe use of the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant is of high interest because the S protein of coronaviruses have been shown to induce the UPR (Chan et al., 2006; Versteeg et al., 2007) and especially since this variant has been shown to be more neurovirulent in mice (H. Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication). As clearly shown in Fig. 3 , the comparison of infectious viral particles production between HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 showed that both viruses bear the same capacity to produce extracellular infectious particles and that they disseminated in neuronal culture at the same rate. However, HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 showed a more rapid and intense production of viral proteins and intracellular infectious viral particles. This suggests that discrete molecular viral S determinants could play a role in virus-cell interactions, leading to an increased capacity to produce viral proteins and infectious viral particles. More importantly, the resulting increase in viral proteins present in the ER suggest that the cells might experience a more intense UPR activation in order to cope with an increased ER stress caused by the burden of viral proteins. Therefore, mutations in the S protein of HCoV-OC43, which lead to an increased neurovirulence in mice, induce a different kinetics of UPR activation. Considering that an uncontrolled UPR appears to be associated with neurological diseases (Lindholm et al., 2006; Paschen, 2003) , we studied its level of activation following infection by HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 in human neurons, which are the main target of infection and determined whether these mutations could lead to increased neuronal death (Fig. 9) .\n\nWe characterized the splicing of XBP1 as a standard analysis to identify the activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway (Fig. 7B) and found that HCoV-OC43 promoted the splicing of XBP1 and the expression of genes partially or solely under the control of this transcriptional factor (Fig. 7A) . Indeed, we showed that HCoV-OC43 infection induced the upregulation of expression of a negative regulator of PERK and PKR activity, P58-ipk, and of a central gene in the ERAD complex, Edem, both solely under the control of XBP1 following activation of the UPR (Lee et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2004) . Altogether, these results indicate an unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway following HCoV-OC43 infection. Indeed, the increase of Xbp1 splicing (Figs. 7A and B) directly correlated with the increased expression of these genes, thus reinforcing our hypothesis of activation of the IRE1/ XBP1 pathway. Moreover, HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 induced a more rapid and stronger splicing of Xbp1 mRNA, indicating an increased activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway by this virus variant compared to wild-type virus.\n\nOn the other hand, we only found a transient level of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5A) , suggesting that the main effector of the PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway, ATF4, might not be efficiently translated following HCoV-OC43 infection, thus suggesting an ATF4-independent induction of the UPR. Moreover, we hypothesize that the increased expression of the cellular inhibitor of PERK P58-ipk, starting at 48 h post-infection, may help explain the absence of phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig.  7A) . However, even if we were not able to detect any ATF4 protein (Fig. 6B ), we observed a significant upregulation of expression of the Gadd34 and Chop genes (Fig. 6A) , which are largely considered to be under the control of ATF4. However, although ATF4 plays a major role in the expression of these genes, other factors are known to regulate their expression. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor that has been shown to regulate Gadd34 and Chop gene expression (Haneda et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2004) . Given that our microarray results showed an upregulation of the expression of ATF3 (data not shown), we hypothesize that Gadd34 and Chop might be induced by this transcriptional factor instead of ATF4. Furthermore, the expression of the Chop gene was also shown to be under the control of XBP1 (Lee et al., 2003) , which correlates with our results (Figs. 6A, 7A and B) . Considering our results showing upregulation of the Edem and P58ipk genes, solely under XBP1 control (Lee et al., 2003) , this adds to the possible involvement of XBP1 in the expression of Chop. The absence of expression of the CHOP protein is striking considering the strong upregulation of Chop mRNA by HCoV OC43 rOC/U S183-241 (Fig. 6A) . However, this may suggest a post-transcriptional regulation of the Chop gene in coronavirus infection, as it has already been shown for INF-beta by MHV (Roth-Cross et al., 2007) . Altogether, our results indicate that the PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway does not play a significant role in the infection of neuronal cells by HCoV-OC43.\n\nAlthough the level of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha was only transient, we did observe a translational shutoff after infection, particularly important for HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 within 48 h of infection (Fig. 5B) . It is of interest to consider that such attenuation of translation can occur concurrently with increased protein degradation by the ERAD complex. The strong upregulation of Edem (Olivari et al., 2006) and Herp (Kim et al., 2008) gene expression (Fig. 6A) , especially after HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 infection might in part explain this phenomenon, as these proteins are associated with protein degradation during the UPR (Figs. 5B and C). Moreover, translational shutoff is a common hallmark preceding cell death, which was also already very strong at 48 h post-infection by the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant, as shown by a viability assay (Fig. 5D) and evaluation of apoptosis induction by caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation (Figs. 8A  and B) . Thus, considering the strong upregulation of gene expression of Edem and Herp known for their role in protein degradation, the significant activation of caspase-3 and the induction of nuclear fragmentation, we hypothesize that the strong decrease in protein synthesis detected following HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 infection might be the result of an increased protein degradation by the ERAD complex concurrently with initial activation steps of apoptosis.\n\nWhile deciphering the UPR following a viral infection, one should bear in mind that redundancy between activated and non-activated pathways and compensating mechanisms for transcriptional gene control, may also lie elsewhere than within the three well-known UPR pathways. Indeed, such complex cross-talk between the UPR pathways using knock-out of XBP1 and ATF6 was reported (Lee et al., 2003) . This would account for the expression of Grp94, which is under the control of both XBP1 and ATF6, following infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 at both mRNA and protein levels (Figs. 7A and B). Our results indicate that the expression of the Grp78 gene is slightly upregulated, but not to a significant level, as revealed by the absence of the corresponding protein in Western blot analysis (Figs. 4A and B) . Interestingly, the knock-out of ATF6 or XBP1 alone was shown to induce a very weak loss of Grp78 expression, showing redundancy between these pathways (Lee et al., 2003) . In contrast, other groups showed that XBP1 knock-out only slightly impaired Grp78 expression and that ATF6 is the major inductor of Grp78 (Yamamoto et al., 2004) . However, further studies need to be performed in order to decipher the cross-talk between ATF6 and XBP1 pathways. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that the low level of expression of Grp78 mRNA could account for the XBP1 activity, as it weakly induces the ERSE promoter (Yamamoto et al., 2004) , and that a full activation of the ATF6 pathway would have led to a strong GRP78 protein expression, as revealed by thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 4A) . Therefore, we hypothesize that the ATF6 pathway plays a minor role, if any, in the UPR activated by HCoV-OC43, leading to the absence of upregulation of GRP78 protein and that consequently GRP94 protein expression is likely to account for XBP1 activity.\n\nOur results showed that the HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 variant harboring point mutations within its S protein can lead to an increased production of viral proteins and intracellular infectious viral particles and we speculate that these events could give rise to an increased ER stress leading to a stronger activation of the UPR (Fig. 9) . Indeed, others have already shown that the S protein of MHV (Versteeg et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006) or the 8ab protein of SARS-CoV (Sung et al., 2009) can alone induce the UPR and that only the presence or accumulation of the protein is thought to be responsible for the ER stress (Versteeg et al., 2007) . Our study clearly reveals that mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can differentially induce the UPR and lead to a stronger neuronal death by apoptosis, as shown by intense caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation (Figs. 8A and B) . Interestingly, IRE1 was linked to the JNK pathway that is involved in apoptosis following the UPR (Urano et al., 2000) and JNK activation can be modulated by other virus, such as HCMV, to cope with cell death (Xuan et al., 2009) . One might speculate that the JNK pathway could play a role in the strong neuronal apoptosis induced by HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 , as we observed a strong and unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Studies are currently underway to decipher the possible implication of the JNK pathway in our model.\n\nIn summary (Fig. 9) , the present study demonstrates that only two point mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43, which are acquired upon persistence in human neural cells and lead to increased neurovirulence in mice (H. Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication), also lead to: (1) an increase in production of viral proteins and intracellular infectious viral particles; (2) a stronger and faster induction of the UPR (Fig. 9) ; (3) an increased attenuation of translation with only transient phosphorylation level of eIF2-alpha; and (4) an increased neuronal cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, it suggests that mutations of RNA viruses acquired during persistence in the central nervous system could modulate neuropathogenesis in the context of virus-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. Such studies are on-going in our animal model of human coronavirus neuropathogenesis.\n\nThe cell lines N-Tera2 (a gift from Dr. Glenn Rall, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and LA-N-5 (a gift from Dr. Stephan Ladisch, George Washington University School of Medicine) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and RPMI supplemented with 15% (v/v) FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 100 \u03bcM non-essential amino acids (Gibco-Invitrogen), respectively. The N-Tera2 cells were differentiated into human neurons (NT2-N), as previously described (Pleasure and Lee, 1993) . Briefly, 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells were seeded in a 75 cm 2 flask in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. The next day, and every 3 days for 4 weeks, medium was replaced by the same medium also containing 10 \u03bcM all-trans retinoic-acid (Sigma). Cells were then trypsinized and plated into Petri dishes (1 \u00d7 10 7 cells) or 24-well (2 \u00d7 10 5 ) plates coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, P-1149) and matrigel (BD Biosciences) and cultured for 2 weeks with DMEM medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 1 \u03bcM AraC, 10 \u03bcM FudR and 10 \u03bcM UriD (Sigma), with medium replaced every 3 days. The LA-N-5 cells were differentiated into human neurons as previously described (Hill and Robertson, 1998) . Briefly, cells were seeded in Cell+Petri dishes (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells), 6-well (4 \u00d7 10 4 cells), 24-well (5 \u00d7 10 3 cells) or 96-well (1.8 \u00d7 10 3 cells) plates (Sarstedt), in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 100 \u03bcM non-essential amino acids. The next day, and every 2 days for 6 days, medium was replaced with the same medium also containing 10 \u03bcM all-trans retinoic-acid.\n\nHCoV-OC43 was obtained several years ago from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC VR-759) and propagated on the HRT-18 cell line as previously described (Mounir and Talbot, 1992) . A recombinant HCoV-OC43 variant containing two point mutations within the S protein (H183R and Y241H), named HCoV-OC43 rOC/ U S183-241 , was generated using the full-length cDNA clone pBAC-OC43 FL , as previously described (St-Jean et al., 2006) . The genome of HCoV-OC43 rOC/U S183-241 was completely sequenced to confirm that the only differences with the HCoV-OC43 ATCC VR-759 strain were the two inserted mutations in the S glycoprotein. Cells were infected at a MOI of 0.2 or mock-infected, then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, washed with PBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C with fresh medium. Cells and supernatants were harvested at the indicated times post-infection. Cells were treated with 2 \u03bcM thapsigargin, or 2 \u03bcM staurosporine or mock-treated and harvested at the indicated times.\n\nCells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with methanol at \u221220\u00b0C for 5 min, incubated with primary mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against \u03b2-tub isoform III (1/1000, Chemicon) and rabbit antiserum specific to BCoV, serologically related to HCoV-OC43 (undiluted) (gift from the late Dr. Serge Dea, INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier), or incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody NFM (1/100, Chemicon) or with rabbit polyclonal antibody to activated Caspase-3 (1/50, R and D Systems) and culture supernatant of mouse hybridoma containing mAb 1-10C.3 directed against the S protein of HCoV-OC43 (undiluted), or incubated only with mAb 1-10C.3 (1/100) for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times with PBS. Cells incubated with \u03b2-tub isoform III antibody and antiserum specific to BCoV were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with two secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen): anti-rabbit AlexaFluor568 (1/1000) and anti-mouse AlexaFluor488 (1/1500). Cells incubated with NFM antibody or activated Caspase-3 antibody and mAb 1-10C.3 were then incubated with the anti-mouse AlexaFluor568 (1/1000) and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488 (1/1500) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells incubated with only mAb 1-10C.3 were then incubated with the anti-mouse AlexaFluor568 (1/1000) for 1 h at room temperature. All cells were then incubated with DAPI for 5 min and then washed three times with PBS prior to imaging. ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc Tukey's analysis were performed to determine the statistical significance of the differences in number of cells showing fragmented nuclei between samples, using SPSS software version 16.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted at 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection using the Agilent RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, quantified using a ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop) and RNA integrity assessed by microfluidic electrophoresis using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Microarray experiments were performed using the Low RNA Input linear amplification kit (Agilent) (Zhu et al., 2006) , according to the manufacturer's protocol, where CTP-Cy3 (Perkin-Elmer) and CTP-Cy5 (Perkin-Elmer) were incorporated into cRNA. Equimolar solution of cRNA from infected and mock-infected cells were hybridized for 17 h at 65\u00b0C on the Agilent 60-mer Oligo Microarray Human 1A v2, 22K chip, which represents 22,000 human transcripts. Microarray fluorescence was revealed using a ProScanArray HT scanner (Perkin-Elmer) at a 5 \u03bcm resolution and colorimetric intensity quantified using the ProScanArray Express software (Perkin-Elmer). Statistics were performed with the open-source software Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) from the TM4 microarray software suite (Saeed et al., 2003) , using combined threshold for a significant gene modulation of p b 0.05 and a minimum of 2-fold modulation of expression in two independent viral infections. Transcriptomics time-point analysis was made from two independent infections, where each of the time-point was performed in dye-swap quadruplicate. cDNAs for quantitative real-time PCR were obtained from total RNA extracts reversetranscribed using the SuperscriptII first-strand kit with oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Realtime quantitative PCR was performed using the DyNAmo SYBR green qPCR kit (NEB) with the Rotor-gene 3000 (Corbett Life Science) with 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. Modulation of gene expression from quantitative real-time PCR was analyzed using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) and normalized to Gapdh expression. ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc Tahame's analysis were performed to determine the statistical significance of the differences in gene expression between samples, using SPSS software version 16.0. Primers used are presented in supplementary data.\n\nTotal protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with the Protease cocktail inhibitor (Sigma) and the Halt-Phosphatase inhibitor (Pierce). Harvested cells were vortexed for 1 min into RIPA buffer, incubated on ice for 20 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 4\u00b0C at 17,000\u00d7g and supernatants were stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until further analyzed. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein assay kit (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 10% or 4-12% gradient gel Novex NuPage (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) with the Bio-Rad Semi-dry transblot apparatus. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with TBS buffer containing 1% (v/v) Tween (TBS-T) and 5% (w/v) non-fat milk, then incubated with rabbit anti-ATF4 antibody (1/200, SantaCruz), mouse anti-CHOP antibody (1/200, SantaCruz), rabbit anti-total eIF2-alpha antibody (1/ 1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phosphorylated Ser52-eIF2-alpha antibody (1/1000, BioSource), rabbit anti-GADD34 antibody (1/250, SantaCruz), mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (1/5000, Chemicon), mouse anti-GRP78 antibody (1/1000, BD Biosciences) or rabbit anti-GRP94 antibody (1/1000, Stressgen) for 1 h at room temperature. After TBS-T washes, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, coupled to horseradish peroxidase (GE Life Sciences) and detection made by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (GE Life Sciences) using Kodak-XOmat L-S film (Kodak).\n\nCell cultures were starved in cystein-and methionine-free medium for 30 min, incubated with 70 \u03bcCi of 35 S-radiolabeled cystein/ methionine using the EXPRE 35 S 35 S protein labeling mix (Perkin-Elmer) for 15 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer and harvested. Proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer, as described above. Equal volumes of whole cell extracts were precipitated in triplicate using the trichloroacetic acid technique and assayed for cpm counts using a Beckman LS1701 scintillation counter, or subjected to SDS PAGE using 4-12% gradient gel Novex NuPage (Invitrogen), fixed with 30% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 10% (v/v) methanol solution for 30 min, incubated in Kodak Enlighning Rapid Autoradiography Enhancer (Perkin-Elmer) for 30 min and exposed at \u2212 80\u00b0C using Kodak-XOmat L-S film. ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc Tahame's analysis were performed to determine the statistical significance of the differences in cpm counts between samples, using SPSS software version 16.0.\n\nViability was assayed by the reduction of 3-[4,5,dimethylthiazol-2yl]-5-[3-carboxyme thoxy-phenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) in the presence of phenazine methosulfate (PMS), as previously described (Cory et al., 1991) . Briefly, infected, mock-infected, thapsigargin-treated and mock-treated cells, cultured in 96-well plates, were incubated in the presence of 0.6 mM MTS (Promega) and 14 \u03bcM PMS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 24, 48 or 72 h postinfection and absorbance was read at 492 nm every 20 min for 3 h. Viability was determined by slope regression analysis for each sample and is expressed as a relative percentage compared to mock-infected cells slope. Student's t test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the differences in slope between samples, using SPSS software version 16.0.\n\nCells were harvested at 4, 16 and 24 h post-infection and 4 \u00d7 10 6 cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol at \u2212 20\u00b0C for 5 min. After 2 washes with PBS, cells were incubated with 100 \u03bcl (5 \u03bcg) of culture supernatant of mouse hybridoma containing mAb 1-10C.3 directed against the S protein of HCoV-OC43, or with 100 \u03bcl (5 \u03bcg) culture supernatant of mouse hybridoma containing mAb 5-11 H.6 directed against the S protein of HCoV-229E as an isotype control, or with 100 \u03bcl of PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse AlexaFluor488 (1/500) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times and analyzed using a FACS calibur cytofluorometer. Data analysis was performed using Cell Quest Pro (BD Bioscience). ANOVA tests followed by posthoc Tahame's analysis were performed to determine the statistical significance of the differences in the percentage of infected cells between samples, using SPSS software version 16.0.\n\nWhole transcriptomics data issued from microarray experiments are deposited and available in the public database GEO at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/."}
