For instance most of results of table one could be expressed with a few stacked bar charts. The viral co-infection could be summarized with network charts. And specifically to figure #1, given that probably most of the readers don't know the locality of those cities, this figure could be expressed over a map of Brazil. It could be done by simply placing in each locality the corresponding pie chart with the size of each chart proportional to the amount of patients screened in each site, and the internal division of the chart indicating the proportion of inclusion. This map should contain the equatorial and tropical lines, as the relative position of these cities along the latitudinal gradient are relevant for this study.\n\nAs suggested in the opening this review, this study should explore further how comorbidities, age, site, sex, use of antiviral, vaccination, etc contribute to the clinical outcomes.\n\nThis should not only be performed for influenza, but for each one of other viruses (although, for those ones, vaccination and flu antiviral should, of course, not expect to have any effect).\n\nThe authors state that \"Results show variations between Northeast (Fortaleza) and South (Curitiba) Brazil in relation to the peak time of influenza infections, which essentially followed the rain season of each region.\" In the case of Curitiba, the rainy season happens to coincide with the coldest moths, with in a subtropical and temperate regions of the world is much more relevant [4] .

In your title you talk about immunization schedule so this needs to be worked into your objectives and conclusion of the abstract.\n\nIn the Objective you highlight \"effect of climate\" yet you don't elaborate to a large degree within the manuscript about how climate is specifically impacting infections other than to say your results seem to coincide with what's already in the literature.

The authors state that \"Seasonal influenza epidemics peak during the winter in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In contrast, tropical countries may experience two annual peaks, with shorter and less intense epidemics\". They should add the clarification \"temperate latitudes of\" after \"winter in\". And, it would be important to mention that influenza activity is frequently out of phase with the hemispheric winter in many tropical regions (and even temperate ones [1] ), with the consequence that optimal timing for routine influenza vaccination recommendations does not necessarily correspond to the one expected for their hemisphere in many countries (for a bibliographic review, and a suggestion of the hemispheric vaccine per country, see [1] ) R: We agree with the reviewer. The information was added to clarify and the references were included at Introduction section, as follow:\n\n\"Seasonal influenza epidemics peak during the winter in temperate latitudes of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In contrast, tropical countries may experience two annual peaks, with shorter and less intense epidemics. [3, 4] Moreover, previous studies showed that influenza activity has been frequently out of phase with the hemispheric winter in many tropical regions, and even temperate ones, with the consequence that optimal timing for routine influenza vaccination recommendations does not necessarily correspond to the one expected for their hemisphere. [Alonso, WJ et al., 2015] . In Brazil, which presents temperate and tropical regions, it has been showed an important regional heterogeneity in influenza peak (Alonso et al., 2007; Mello et al. 2009 ).\"\n\nQ3. Given the focus declared of this study, the authors need to explain the earlier studies that measured the seasonality of influenza in Brazil and addressed the timing of the hemispheric influenza vaccine (namely that the Northern Hemispheric vaccination should be given to the equatorial parts of Brazil [2] [3] ). Later in the discussion section it would be important that they examine how this new data confirms or refutes those earlier findings.\n\nR: We agree with the reviewer, and the references suggested were included at Introduction section (See answer above). At Discussion section the results were compared with previous reported data (P. 14, from 2nd. to 4th. paragraphs).\n\nQ4. Also after the statement that \"Besides climate and environmental conditions, host factors such as immune function and body levels of vitamin D have been associated with seasonal variations of this infection, as well as the severity of influenza epidemics.\" the authors cite two papers (Shaman & Kohn 2009 and Lowen et al 2007) which actually did not address nor supported such hypothesis. They can find a review of these theoriesincluding the ones regarding the drivers of seasonality in the tropics, which are of special importance to this study -in [4] R: We agree with the reviewer. The paragraph was rewritten and new references were included as follow:\n\n\"Besides climate and environmental conditions, which have shown an association between seasonal influenza epidemics with \"cold-dry\" and \"humid-rainy\" (Temerius et al., 2013), host factors such as age, preexisting immunity, genetic polymorphisms, and presence of comorbidities have been associated with seasonal variations of this infection, vaccine responsiveness, as well as the severity of influenza epidemics. [Castrucci, 2017] .\" Methods Q5. The authors state that \"We compared the parameters associated with influenza and ORV infections\" but do not describe which parameters are those.\n\nR: The sentence was reworded as follow: \"Epidemiological and clinical data comparing patients infected with influenza and those infected with ORV were assessed; only monoinfected cases were included in this analysis.\"\n\nThe data compared were: age, time of onset symptoms, length of stay in hospital, presence of polypneia, ICU admission, need of mechanical ventilation, and presence of preexisting diseases Q6. If \"Data from Rio de Janeiro were not evaluated owing to the small number of patients included in the study\" justify in which way the data from this site contributes to the topic expressed in the study title of \"Seasonality and implications for immunization schedule\" R: During the result analyzes the authors also evaluated if Rio de Janeiro data should be included. We decide to maintain this center because all cases were investigated to detect other respiratory viruses. As previous commented by the reviewer (Query 1) we also think that information about ORV is relevant. At this moment, we believe that with the changes carried out in the manuscript (title and discussion), these data are not out of context and should be kept. R: We agree with the reviewer, and a new figure was added. As the flowchart presents some different information, we decided to keep both figures. Please, verify Figure 1 and Figure 2 .\n\nRegarding the Table 1 , we had to maintain the data as presented because of limitations of graphic/tables number (up to five figures and tables)\n\nQ9. As suggested in the opening this review, this study should explore further how comorbidities, age, site, sex, use of antiviral, vaccination, etc contribute to the clinical outcomes. This should not only be performed for influenza, but for each one of other viruses (although, for those ones, vaccination and flu antiviral should, of course, not expect to have any effect).\n\nR: Our group has studied the associations of clinical-epidemiological findings and disease severity in patients infected by respiratory viruses, and some results have been previously reported. In this study we decided to keep focus on influenza cases, since the data were collected considering in the screening patients with Flu-like disease. Patients hospitalized for less than 30 days were excluded from the analysis, so immunosuppressed individuals or those with other comorbidities (in which ORVs have a greater impact) were excluded. In addition, the association of these factors with ORVs should be discussed separately for each virus, which would make this manuscript very extensive. Below are some references from our group's publications on this topic. Q10. The authors state that \"Results show variations between Northeast (Fortaleza) and South (Curitiba) Brazil in relation to the peak time of influenza infections, which essentially followed the rain season of each region.\" In the case of Curitiba, the rainy season happens to coincide with the coldest moths, with in a subtropical and temperate regions of the world is much more relevant [4] . In fact, the prevalent theory points that low absolute humidity is the driver of influenza in temperate regions, so the Curitiba data is a interesting challenge to this hypothesis (as probably absolute humidity is not low if precipitation is high in the winter seasonsomething worth checking with local meteorological data).\n\nIn the southern region of Brazil the humid subtropical climate predominates. The annual rainfall in the southern region is around 1,200 mm (~ 2,000 on the coast). In our region during the winter, on contrary to that observed in southeastern of Brazil, the absolute and relative humidity are generally high. However, in this study we report only the index of precipitation during the period, since we did not receive the information on atmospheric humidity of the other regions. However, we have data about respiratory virus circulation in the city of Curitiba for many years, and we are evaluating the circulation of respiratory viruses and climatic data, seeking to compare our data with the publications on this issue. Only with this analysis we can confirm this findings. R: This is not only valid for the Y axis, but especially important for the X ones (i.e. the months should be aligned, expliciting in this way the period of data available for each site). Q13. The minimum value of the temperature in the Y axis should not be set at zero (which, as opposed to the zero value in precipitation, is an arbitrary value anyway). For clear visualization of the temperature change through the year, its range should be brought to something close to the one found in those series , i.e. between ~13 and ~30).\n\nR: The values of the primary Y axis refer to the numbers of detected cases of influenza and also the values of temperature, thus it is necessary to maintain the zero value.\n\nQ14. The manuscript discusses a study of influenza surveillance in 3 locations within Brazil and link surveillance to vaccination schedule and climate (seasonality). The authors do a good job is their description of influenza surveillance in the 3 locales though there is not much elaboration on the impact of climate specifically which is highlighted in their \"Objectives\" and how that is directly informing conclusions in their study. Minor revisions suggested below:\n\nR: We appreciated all contributions made by the reviewer and add the suggestions seeking to improve the manuscript. In fact, information on climate conditions from distinct regions of the country was limited, as the monitoring of weather conditions is performed by institutes linked to the states of each region of the country. So we decided to include only the similar data that were made available by these institutes. For this reason, we performed changes in title and in the focus of the manuscript. This limitation was included in the Discussion Section.\n\nQ15. Abstract -revise your Objectives and Conclusion. It appears the main take away, which is a valuable one, is that vaccination schedule is important. Since you were seeing infections peak with the rainy season and the rainy season appears predictable for the two regions analyzed, perhaps an earlier vaccination schedule to ensure you catch infections before they happen. In your title you talk about immunization schedule so this needs to be worked into your objectives and conclusion of the abstract.\n\nR: The objectives were rewritten as follow: \"Objectives To describe epidemiological and clinical features of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses, to report influenza seasonality in distinct regions of the country, and to correlate the findings of influenza circulation and time of immunization in Brazil.\"\n\nQ16. In the Objective you highlight \"effect of climate\" yet you don't elaborate to a large degree within the manuscript about how climate is specifically impacting infections other than to say your results seem to coincide with what's already in the literature. It's fine to keep this in, but you were also looking at immunization schedules and influenza infections -so include that and downplay climate impact unless you are going to elaborate beyond what has been found in the literature.\n\nInfluenza activity in the tropics is more temporally diffuse than the peaks shown at higher latitudes, and epidemics display a diversity of seasonal patterns driven by factors not yet clearly understood. In fact, the timing of influenza circulation and vaccine delivery in Brazil is a critical issue that affects the effectiveness of the vaccine. Previous reports had shown the challenges of influenza vaccine recommendations when applied to the tropics. In Brazil, which has collected viral surveillance data regularly over the last decades, data from the northern and northeastern regions are still scarce, since they are extensive regions, the population has access difficulties to health care, and there is a delay to referral clinical samples, among others. Unfortunately, this is the similarly valid for other tropical regions. In this way, we believe that more than discussing the possibility of changing the influenza vaccination calendar for the northern areas of the country, it is necessary to discuss the immunological benefits to the target population of the adoption of a specific vaccine whose composition is based on viral circulation identified in the northern and southern hemispheres, which present distinct climatic characteristics of these tropical regions. Moreover, because it is a region with so many low-income countries and due to the possible risk of viral recombination in this region, with the consequent risk of pandemic variant emergence, perhaps all other countries should consider priority to the implementation of molecular surveillance centers In these regions, including adopting, as a result of the monitoring data, a vaccine with specific composition for this region, as well as a more adequate schedule for viral seasonality.\n\nR: A paragraph about immunization schedules and influenza infections was included at Discussion section, as follow: \"To know the dynamics of dispersion of influenza viruses in tropical regions have been considered of crucial importance, since several studies have suggested that in these regions the influenza activity is more temporally diffuse and may contain the foci for the emergence of new variants. [Mello et al, 2009; Allonso et al., 2007; Russel et al, 2008] In addition to the need for a different influenza immunization schedule in Brazil, the composition of this vaccine should also be evaluated, since its antigenic composition for this region may be different from that recommended for the temperate region (Mello et al., 2009 ). However, information on strains circulating in tropics is still scarce, since most of the countries in this region have low income and the health surveillance is not completely employed. Besides that, the logistical challenges to implementing a national immunization program with different calendars and distinct antigenic compositions in Brazil meet the need for investments that provide self-sufficiency in its production (Mello, 2009 ).\"\n\nQ17. Page 2, Line 14 -no reason to use '03' -none of your other single numbers in the manuscript are preceded by a zero, so you can change this to '3'.\n\nR: The sentence was corrected.\n\nQ18. Page 2, Line39 -ORV needs to be spelled out in the abstract before usage as an acronym.\n\nR: The sentence was corrected.\n\nQ19. Page 9, Line 30 - Table 2 also shows antiviral use in Fortaleza and it was used for longer median number of days. You talk about the seasonality of influenza infections in two regions (Curitiba and Fortaleza) relative to temperature and precipitation. Can you say anything regarding antiviral use/vaccination. Both Fortaleza and Curitiba used antivirals, Curitiba had a higher vaccination % (31%) -or are the numbers too low to say anything meaningful? Despite not having the 'numbers' to say anything statistical about Rio -was there anything qualitative you could say given impressions from the data and as compared to what you were seeing in Curitiba and Fortaleza? R: In 2009, the overall mortality rate due to pandemic influenza A virus in Brazil was within the average observed in other countries of the Americas (0.85/100,000 inhabitants). However, in a different epidemic scenario, the mortality rate in southern regions increased by more than 2-fold (Raboni et al., 2011). The impact of the pandemic in this region has led to a greater concern of health professionals and of the population with regard to influenza infection, for this reason annually it has been observed a higher vaccination coverage rates, as well as a greater use of neuraminidase inhibitors in this region, when compared to the rest of the country. Antiviral drug (oseltamivir) was used in only 2% (n = 10) of children from Fortaleza. In some cases, it was observed that drug was used for a long time of days, as the data were collected from the medical record review, there was no description of the reason for the extension of treatment time over 5 days, which is usually recommended. No RJ patient used antiviral drugs.\n\nRegarding vaccination, comparing all sites it is possible to observe that there is a higher percentage of patients from Curitiba vaccinated. However, the low percentage observed in the 3 sites is worrisome, since it should be emphasized that the majority of the patients included in the study are pediatric patients (Curitiba and Fortaleza) and over 60 years old (Rio Janeiro). Both age groups are considered to be at highest risk of severe disease outcomes and are included in the protocols for recommending immunization for influenza in Brazil. Q20. Page 10, Line 41 -reword to \"\u2026, which essentially coincided with the peak of the rainy season of each region.\"\n\nThe sentence was reworded. The Authors state that data from Rio de Janeiro was not evaluated, please add a justification or rationale for including this data in the publication/study. What does it add? Why include it?\n\nI am still not convinced of how climate may play a role in their study cities for the determinants of seasonality. As this is stated as an objective it needs to be clarified/addressed in greater detail in the manuscript. Can they draw parallels between their study sites (climate/determinants of influenza seasonality) and study sites in previous publications that looked at climate impact on influenza seasonality/infections? Do they see similar trends? Different trends and if so, hypothesize/explain why?"}
