{"title": "", "body": "EMERGING TECHNOLOGY: IONIC LIQUIDS N ame an active organic solvent that has an extremely low vapor pressure (i.e., is not a volatile organic compound), is not flammable, is a liquid from below 0 8C to above 300 8C, and has sufficiently little environmental impact that it can be classified as ''green''. Now, demand that this is an entire class of solvents that can be customized to specific needs and delivered in kiloton quantities. What do you have? Ionic liquids -called ''ILs'' meet these requirements. One example is methylimidazolium chloride. This is an IL with a melting point of 75 8C. The IL is used in a purification process by BASF for scavenging acid from a diethoxyphenylphosphine production line. The IL is recycled by treating it with caustic, and regenerating methylimidazole.\n\nILs have moved from laboratory research to industrial application much more quickly than supercritical carbon dioxide made this transition. As such, many properties, particularly those properties of interest to the environmental health and safety community have not been studied. As use of ILs becomes more common, the lack of toxicological data in particular may be a problem.\n\nCurrently you can find organic chemists working on synthesizing new candidate IL molecules for consideration by the chemical engineers. In the chemical engineering laboratories you will find lab-scale activity that is then scaled-up to pilot plant levels. Some of these studies will prove sufficiently valuable to put into full production. Each of these steps have the potential for EH&S-related problems. At all levels, the undefined toxicological properties could result in over-exposures, even with strict engineering controls in place. The lack of physical property data -a heat of reaction -for example, could contribute to a run-away reaction during scale-up. Releases to the environment could have unforeseen consequences.\n\nThese possibilities should serve to guide the EH&S approach to supervising work with ILs. They certainly should not prevent the research and development. ILs have a real potential to ameliorate significant EH&S problems with classic solvents. We do need to proceed with awareness and caution.\n\nThe semiconductor industry uses very aggressive chemistry during wafer fabrication. Cleaning quartz tubes has always proved to be a high hazard task, using a variety of aggressive chemicals, such as hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid. Air Liquide has recently introduced a technol-ogy based on fluorine gas -dubbed ''Flora''. This technology is operating at a Tokyo Electron, Ltd. Plant, using 40 liters per hour of F 2 . This technology must be operated with care to avoid uncontrolled gas releases.\n\nPerstorp Compounds AB of Sweden has developed a molding compound that can be mixed with a variety of resins that imparts antimicrobial and antivirial properties to the finished part. Light switches, hand rails, phones and toilet seats can now be made that are inherently hygienic. According to Perstorp one brand of inherently antivirial plastic, called ''Polygiene'' kills the SARS Corona virus on contact.\n\nThis leads to the frequently asked question as to how the introduction of such inherently antimicrobial materials into the ecosphere will affect the drug resistance of microorganisms. This certainly has been a question raised with TricolsanJ, the antimicrobial widely used in soaps, detergents, and cleaning agents. 1,2 Triclocarban is a trivial name for 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dichlorphenyl)urea. Tricolsan is the ether analog of the urea compound. Triclosan and triclocarban have been used as effective antiseptics in soap since the 1960s. Triclosan has been incorporated into a wide range of consumer goods, including cosmetics, toothpaste, and plastics for children's toys and kitchen and table utensils.\n\nNeither substance is very soluble in water, but both are fat-soluble and easily cross cell membranes. Once inside the cell, Triclosan poisons a specific enzyme that many bacteria and funguses need for survival. Triclosan blocks the active site of an enzyme called enoyl-acyl carrier-protein reductase (ENR for short), preventing the bacteria from manufacturing fatty acids it needs for building cell membranes and other vital functions. Humans don't have this enzyme, so Triclosan does not pose a metabolic hazard to them. One molecule of Triclosan permanently disables an ENR molecule, which explains why Triclosan has powerful antibiotic action even at very low concentrations. Triclocarban's structural similiarity suggests a similiar mode of action.\n\nThe highly specific way that Triclosan kills has researchers concerned about its role in fostering antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Researchers have demonstrated that mutations in the bacterial gene that produces ENR can produce Triclosan-resistant bacteria. Because triclosan is now so widespread in the environment, it's possible that new antibiotics targeting ENR would be ineffective.\n\nPraxair has developed a technology for rinsing fruit and vegetables with an ozone-containing water spray that increases the shelf life of the produce some 30 to 100%. The Praxair technology generates ozone using an electrical discharge in dry oxygen and then mixes the gas with water to produce a dissolved ozone concentration of less than ten ppm. The system is called ''Nature Wash'' and has been shown to add 2-5 additional days of shelf life to watermelons. The system is currently capable to a 1500 pound per hour throughput. Excess ozone and ozone that is released from solution into the air around the produce during treatment is destroyed via a catalytic bed before the air is released to the atmosphere.\n\nMost EH&S professionals know of the Darwin Awards. These are ''given'' to people who prove to be ''bewilderingly unable to cope with obvious dangers in the modern world''. The awardees must significantly improve the human gene pool by removing themselves from the human race in an amazingly stupid manner. I was recently given two books, titled ''The Darwin Awards: Evolution in Action 3 '' and ''The Darwin Awards II 4 ''. They are written by Wendy Northcutt. After reading these wonderful stories, I have selected a few, with chemical safety relevance, to share with readers of this column. I trust that the author and publisher will appreciate the advertising. Note that Ms. Northcutt claims to have verified each story. Ms. Northcutt studied molecular biology at UC Berkeley, worked in a neuroscience research laboratory at Stanford, and later joined a biotech startup developing cancer and diabetes therapeutics. All this merely served as a prelude to her true calling as creator of the website www.DarwinAwards.com, and author of hundreds of Darwin Awards stories.\n\nSeven firefighters from a jurisdiction near Chattanooga, Tennessee decided to help a former firefighter regain his employment. The plan involved torching a house and then impressing their Chief by their prowess at putting out the fire. Unfortunately, this individual, Daniel, had his career snuffed when he became trapped in the target house while pouring gasoline. The vapors ignited and he died.\n\nVerified by AP news reports and KIRO radio.\n\nThe victim died when his aluminum rowboat was blown over the M-250 explosive device (equivalent to 1/4 stick of commercial dynamite) he had thrown in the lake, near his Illinois home. The explosive blew out the bottom of the boat and the victim drowned.\n\nVerified by the Associated Press and the San Francisco Examiner.\n\nThis victim lived -but the story is real. The high school student took some sodium from a container in the school chemistry lab. He wrapped the solid in a paper towel and placed it into his pants pocket. The moisture from his body was sufficient to ignite the metal, causing severe burns to his leg.\n\nVerified by a personal account observer.\n\nRobert -the Georgia wheel and tire mechanic died when trying to repair a truck wheel by heating the metal with a torch. In his haste, he opted not to deflate and remove the tire. When the four-foot diameter tire blew apart, the split rim of the wheel flew with ''great velocity'' and killed the victim. His employer, commenting on the OSHA citation, said, ''He was trained and he knew what he was doing, but he died anyway''.\n\nPublished in the Macon Telegraph.-Making the human race smarter -One fool at a time.\n\nThe CSB released preliminary findings of an investigation into a chlorine release at the DPC Enterprises facility in Glendale, Arizona. According to the CSB, the release occurred when plant operators were transferring chlorine from a railroad car into a tanker truck. During the transfer, an alarm on the caustic scrubber system sounded, alert-ing the operators that the caustic level in the scrubber was low. The plant's written procedures required that the transfer be stopped and the problem resolved. Plant operators, however, had gotten into a habit of obtaining a sample from the scrubber and analyzing it for caustic, without shutting down the chlorine transfer.\n\nOn the day of the incident, this practice resulted in the release of an estimated 3,500 pounds of chlorine. The Glendale Fire Department initiated an evacuation of an estimated 4,000 people, using a reverse-911 calling system. Fourteen people were injured, including 10 police officers. All of the injuries involved chlorine inhalation.\n\nThe CSB noted that the community emergency response was ''largely effective''.\n\nMany incidents involving chlorine releases occur each year. Every incident I have reviewed was preventable by using well documented procedures. Clearly more management oversight is needed."}
