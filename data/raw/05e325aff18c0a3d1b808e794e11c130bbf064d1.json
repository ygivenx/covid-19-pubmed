{"title": "Multicolor two-photon imaging of in vivo cellular pathophysiology upon influenza virus infection using the two-photon IMPRESS", "body": "In vivo two-photon imaging is an analytical approach that can be used to visualize cell dynamics and hemodynamics in organs or tissues of live animals. Information in real time obtained by using this approach, such as changes in cell behavior and morphology, tissue localization, and blood flow, has revealed highly sophisticated and dynamic systems of living organisms. During in vivo imaging, the blood circulation in the tissue being observed is maintained; therefore, this technique is also effective for analyzing the migration and invasion of immune cells in the inflammatory environment. Observations in physiological environments deepen our understanding of host response mechanisms under both steady-state and disease conditions. Computed tomography, X-ray, and IVIS Spectrum (an in vivo imaging system) imaging methods have been used as non-invasive approaches; however, these techniques have low spatiotemporal resolution and have been able to estimate only the site of inflammation in an organ 1, 2 . Therefore, it is impossible to observe cellular responses of the immune system using these approaches. By contrast, a two-photon excitation laser microscope, the light source of which is a near-infrared laser that produces low damage to cells but has long-reaching depth in tissue, enables us to capture the movement of cells in living animals at high resolution. Two-photon imaging has been in use in biological science since the 1990s; it has progressed at a remarkable rate, and observation methods for various organs, including brain, liver, and lymph nodes, have been reported 3, 4 . In this protocol, we describe how to use it to image virus-infected lungs. We have previously demonstrated that this protocol works by using mice infected with mouse-adapted seasonal influenza virus (H1N1) or highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) 5 .\n\nThe lung, which is a respiratory organ, has contact with the outside environment and is an important organ for research on immunity to infectious diseases. In the seventeenth century, Marcello Malpighi discovered pulmonary capillaries and alveoli in the frog lung by using optical microscopy 6 ; now fluorescent reporter mice facilitate the study of disease models in conjunction with two-photon excitation microscopy (Table 1) . However, a challenge encountered when imaging the lung is that it is constantly moving during respiration. The lung has been stabilized in several ways during in vivo observation by microscopy, including bronchus clamping, prolonged apnea, gluing, and suction 7, 8 ; however, it is difficult to reduce motion artifacts due to lung respiratory movement under physiological conditions and hence to obtain high-quality images. Bronchus clamping can suppress respiratory motion artifacts of the lung lobe 9, 10 ; however, it is not suitable for long-term observation because it causes severe hypoxia. Although prolonging apnea is less invasive [11] [12] [13] , it does not allow researchers sufficient time to observe the lung for image acquisition by two-photon excitation microscopy, and the quality of the images tends to deteriorate over time. Gluing addresses the above limitations 14, 15 ; however, it can induce shear force injury and inflammation, which affect the interpretation of results. A suction window, which is currently the most commonly used stabilizing system during lung imaging, achieves moderate immobilization of the lung and high-quality images [16] [17] [18] [19] ; however, the observation period is limited to \u226412 h. Ex vivo imaging of lungs and in vivo imaging of trachea have also been performed as complementary methods 8 . Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to select and optimize the method best suited to the goal of the experiments and disease model.\n\nIn vivo observation of lungs has been performed using various lung disease and experimental models, including bacterial infection, allergen inoculation, tumor metastasis, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis (Table 1) . However, for viral respiratory diseases, such as influenza, other than an observation in a methodology report 20 , only analyses of the trachea in vivo [21] [22] [23] and isolated lungs had been performed 24 , with no analysis of the lung in vivo, until our recent publication 5 (Table 1) . Unlike ex vivo methods, which involve isolated or sliced lungs, in vivo imaging using two-photon excitation microscopy of live animals enables researchers to observe hemodynamics, migration and extravasation of immune cells, as well as interactions among immune cells during influenza virus infection. However, it is technically demanding to perform two-photon excitation microscopy of live influenza virus-infected lung, which exhibits severe inflammation, requiring the development of highly sophisticated, less invasive instruments and surgical techniques. In addition, when observing animals infected with pathogenic viruses, specialized facilities and instruments are frequently required to avoid the spread of the virus. Furthermore, because many types of immune cells infiltrate the infected lung in an inflammatory environment, it is necessary to distinguish the target immune cells from the infected cells by using fluorescent labels in the infected microenvironment. To detect multiple fluorescent signals excited simultaneously by a two-photon excitation laser, fluorochromes with different spectra and equal brightness must be selected; however, there is currently no comprehensive database of fluorescent reagents, fluorescent reporter viruses, and reporter mouse lines available for lung in vivo imaging. We therefore also provide a database of fluorescent dyes, antibodies, and reporter mouse lines that can be used in combination with a reporter influenza virus (Color-flu) [25] [26] [27] for multicolor analysis under pathological conditions in this protocol.\n\nOur system uses suction-based lung stabilization 16, 28 to improve an existing in vivo two-photon imaging system for influenza virus-infected lung as a model of an acute inflammatory respiratory disease 5 . We have successfully used C57BL/6 mice and transgenic mice of the C57BL/6 background (6-to 10-week-old males and females). By using our method, described in detail here, it is possible to visualize and analyze the behavior of immune cells and their interactions with infected cells during an influenza virus infection, which creates an acute inflammatory environment.\n\nA limitation of two-photon excitation microscopy is that the observation depth that can be achieved is a maximum of~70 \u03bcm. Therefore, we cannot observe the bronchial region. This limitation is linked to the wavelength of the infrared laser and detector capability of the microscope. However, as laser technology develops, the observation depth achievable using this method will improve.\n\nIn this protocol, we describe the application of this methodology to influenza virus infection of the lungs because this is what we have used it for previously. This protocol could be applied not only to studies of the early stages of inflammation due to infection or other causes, but also to analyses of tissue regeneration mechanisms in lungs that are in the process of recovering from infection or other PROTOCOL NATURE PROTOCOLS injuries. The information provided will also be useful to those using two-photon imaging analysis for the evaluation of the effects of drugs and vaccines, as well as biological events in the lungs and other organs (e.g., liver, spleen) 5 . Moreover, with minor modifications, the approach could be applied to analyses of other respiratory diseases, including other infectious models (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), pulmonary fibrosis, and tumor metastasis. . DNA fingerprinting showed that this cell line has the same origin as one obtained from ATCC (cat. no. CCL-34, RRID:CVCL_0422) ! CAUTION All viruses and infected animals should be handled in accordance with your institution's biosafety regulations. All work on highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses must be performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) regulations. Accordingly, all our in vivo imaging studies were performed in the BSL3 facility at the University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan), which is approved for such use by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan c CRITICAL The cells should be regularly checked to ensure that they are not contaminated with mycoplasma. \u2022 Isoflurane (MSD Animal Health) !

CAUTION It should be noted that antibody staining may affect the target cell behavior; for example, at a high dose (~200 \u03bcg), antibodies may neutralize cell activities and/or cause antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity [35] [36] [37] . In our studies, we use 5 \u00b5g of antibody for brightness screening because inoculation of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-Ly-6G antibody at low doses (1-40 \u00b5g) into mice does not affect neutrophil recruitment 38 . The contribution of Ly-6G, which is expressed predominantly on murine neutrophils, to recruitment during inflammation remains a matter of debate. It has been reported that low-dose antibody treatment inhibited Ly-6G ligation and the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation 39 ; however, a more recent study indicated that Ly-6G knockout did not affect either neutrophil differentiation or recruitment to the site of inflammation in Catchup mice 32 . Therefore, a low dose of anti-Ly-6G antibody is used in our protocol.\n\nLaser path adjustment system An overview of the laser path adjustment system is shown in Fig. 1 . Our two-photon excitation laser (Chameleon Vision II) unit is placed on an anti-vibration table outside the BSL3 facility. The laser beam enters the BSL3 room, where the two-photon excitation scanning microscope is located, through a window (composed of a small glass window (WG12012-B) and a planar window (RS seal)) connecting the inside and the outside of the BSL3 facility (Fig. 1c,d) . The laser path connecting the laser source unit and the two-photon excitation microscope is adjusted by automated laser beam alignment and the Aligna 4D stabilization system is adjusted with two active mirrors. ! CAUTION This system adjusts the laser path passing from the outside to the inside of the BSL3 facility for maintenance purposes, so there is no need for this setup unless you are using pathogens that require BSL3 containment. Heat is generated when the laser source unit is running, so keep the temperature and humidity constant by using air conditioning equipment. ! CAUTION The system should be operated only by users trained to deal with unenclosed high-power invisible beams and should be placed in an appropriate enclosure with interlocking doors.\n\nTwo-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy system for in vivo imaging of virus-infected mouse lungs in a BSL3 facility A schematic of the arrangement of the in vivo lung imaging system for virus-infected mouse is shown in Fig. 2a, and layout examples are shown in Fig. 2b -g. This in vivo lung imaging system is based on the upright microscope LSM 780 NLO system, which is equipped with four different lasers (excitation at 405, 488, 543, and 633 nm) for confocal imaging and a two-photon excitation laser (excitation at 630-1,050 nm). To be able to perform the surgical procedure on the mouse, we replaced the sample stage with a large, flat one (microscope stage for in vivo experiment) as shown in Fig. 2b ,c. To efficiently excite multiple fluorescent proteins and fluorescent dyes simultaneously, the wavelength of the infrared laser should be set at 910 nm. All fluorescent spectra between the 410-and 695-nm wavelengths can be detected using a 20\u00d7 water immersion lens, and we record signals in lambda image stacks (0.13 frames per s, 1,024 \u00d7 1,024 pixels) and acquire z-stack images with z-depths of 5 \u03bcm (total of 10-\u03bcm z-depth). We perform spectral separation of the acquired lambda stacks by using the linear unmixing function of the ZEN software. Although the LSM 780 microscope system is controlled by a primary personal computer, we recommended adding >64 GB of RAM for appropriate imaging analysis.\n\nWe keep the mice on a heated stage on the sample stage and record their vital signs using a LabOx-1 pulse oximeter. To observe the lungs of the mice with a thoracotomy, we place the ventilator with an airway pressure monitor and anesthesia machine for rodents in appropriate positions on the stage. We installed high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in the exhalation duct of the ventilation system (Fig. 2b,d) , and the operator wore a positive pressure mask (Versaflo Faceshields) and a Tyvek suit (Fig. 2e-g) to avoid exposure to the viruses. ! CAUTION The wavelength and power of the excitation laser should be adjusted appropriately according to the experimental conditions. Increasing the laser power enhances target signals and enables detection of second-harmonic generation (SHG), in which structures with repeating patterns lead to the formation of a signal. SHG is a useful phenomenon for visualizing collagen fibers in the lung without staining; however, it should be noted that the autofluorescence of lung tissue is also enhanced under excessive excitation conditions ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). When using this protocol, we did not perform experiments under which SHG occurs, in order to minimize autofluorescence; it is better to adjust the laser power according to the experimental purpose. When the wavelength of the excitation laser is too short, the autofluorescence signal becomes very strong and it is difficult to observe properly. By contrast, when the laser wavelength is too long, it becomes difficult to obtain a signal because of the short excitation energy (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). ! CAUTION Although color separation of emission using a conventional optical band-pass filter is also available for this protocol, multispectral imaging is a useful approach for simultaneously analyzing multiple targets by eliminating tissue autofluorescence and identifying fluorescent labels with overlapping spectra 40, 41 . In vivo two-photon imaging is performed under conditions of single stimulation with a two-photon excitation laser; limitations exist regarding available fluorescent reagents/proteins for multiple labeling of target cells and lung architecture. Therefore, we recommend using a multispectral approach to produce crosstalk-free images of fluorescence with overlapping spectra that cannot be separated by using band-pass filters. Before starting experiments, it is necessary to collect spectral signatures of the emission signal of each fluorescent reagent and protein as reference spectra under the same excitation condition as will be used in the experiment.\n\nTo observe the mouse lung using an upright microscope, it is necessary to prepare a thoracic suction window to immobilize the lung. In the BSL3 facility, animal experiments must be performed while wearing two or three layers of latex gloves; therefore, the thoracic suction window was designed for easy handling, even in the BSL3 facility, and to be minimally invasive for the infected animals (Fig. 3a-c and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). To position a cover glass for each observation, flatten the upper surface of the thoracic suction window so that a commercially available cover glass will fit. This device is also designed to reduce concavity and convexity as much as possible so that blood containing virus cannot accumulate. Connect the thoracic suction window to an aspirator through a waste tank and a suction regulator. To prevent the spread of virus-containing aerosols, install HEPA filters between the waste tank and the suction regulator as shown in Fig. 3d . Starting up the imaging system equipment \u2022 Timing 20-30 min 2 On the day of analysis, turn on the two-photon excitation laser and the Aligna 4D control unit placed outside the BSL3 facility, and verify that they are working. c CRITICAL The Aligna 4D control unit needs to be kept ON. 3 Wearing a Tyvek suit, positive pressure mask, and gloves according to the guidelines for the BSL3 facility, enter the BSL3 facility where the imaging system is housed. ? TROUBLESHOOTING 4 Turn on the microscope controllers, confocal lasers, and the computer for the two-photon excitation microscope and the Aligna 4D system. 5 Launch the microscope control software ZEN and turn on the lasers, including the two-photon excitation laser. 6 Launch the Aligna 4D control software Kangoo and adjust the laser path connecting the laser source unit and the microscope (Supplementary Fig. 4) . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 7 Wrap the hot plate with aluminum foil, turn it on, and keep it at 35\u00b0C. Sterilize the surgical area and tools with 70% ethanol and place all instruments within easy reach.\n\nAnimal anesthesia \u2022 Timing 2-3 min 8 Turn on the gas anesthesia vaporizer and supply 5% isoflurane to a mouse anesthesia induction chamber. 9 Anesthetize the influenza virus-infected mouse with 5% isoflurane in a mouse anesthesia induction chamber. Subsequently, transfer the mouse to the hot plate while supplying 2% isoflurane via an anesthetic mask.\n\n? TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n10 Inject the chosen fluorescent dyes and antibodies via the retro-orbital plexus (as shown in Supplementary Video 1) using an insulin syringe. Tables 4 and 5 show the brightness levels of antibodies and fluorescence of dyes, respectively, in vivo. ! CAUTION When working with viruses in a BSL3 containment, it is not safe to use needles, so we avoid them as much as possible, which is a standard precaution in high-containment laboratories. In addition, in the BSL3 facility, animal experiments must be performed wearing two or three layers of latex gloves. Tail-vein administration is a common method; however, it is not easy to perform these procedures with so many layers of gloves. Use tweezers to hold down the mouse to make the administration route. When an infected animal is not used, an administration route can be created via the tail vein or the jugular vein. ? TROUBLESHOOTING Surgical procedure \u2022 Timing 10-15 min c CRITICAL Before experimenting with infected animals, practice the surgical procedures with euthanized animals. 11 Place the mouse on its back and tape the anterior limbs with adhesive tape (Fig. 4a) . 12 Using straight scissors, cut the skin beneath the chin in the middle and expose the trachea (Fig. 4b) .\n\nInsert a tracheal cannula and intubate the mouse to facilitate mechanical ventilation with a ventilator (Fig. 4c) . Turn on the ventilator, ventilate the mouse at a respiratory rate of 120 breaths per min, and apply positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP;~6 cm H 2 O) and a tidal volume of 0.5 mL. Deliver isoflurane continuously at 2% to maintain anesthesia. ! CAUTION Perform the surgery with care so as not to cut the blood vessels. If bleeding occurs, stop the bleeding with fine bulldog forceps for microsurgery. 13 Place the mouse in the right lateral decubitus position and re-fix its anterior limbs with the tape (Fig. 4d) . Make an incision in the skin at the left axilla using straight scissors, straight iris scissors, and hooked forceps (Fig. 4e) . ! CAUTION Carefully change the mouse's position in order to avoid cannula drop off. 14 Expose the left lung lobe by surgical intercostal incision between ribs 3 and 4, and keep it exposed by using retractors (Fig. 4f) . The brightness of each fluorescent protein during in vivo lung imaging was scored as relative fluorescence intensity compared with FluoSpheres fluorescent microspheres as an internal standard. For relative intensities of 0-0.2, 0.2-0.6, 0.6-0.9, and >0.9, the brightness scores are represented as +, ++, +++, and ++++, respectively. The brightness of each fluorochrome during in vivo lung imaging was scored as relative fluorescence intensity compared with FluoSpheres fluorescent microspheres as an internal standard. For relative intensities of 0-0.2, 0.2-0.6, 0.6-0.9, and >0.9, the brightness scores are represented as +, ++, +++, and ++++, respectively. AF, Alexa Fluor; ND, not detected. ! CAUTION Perform the surgery with care so as not to cut the blood vessels. If bleeding occurs, stop the bleeding with fine bulldog forceps for microsurgery. c CRITICAL Because lungs infected with viruses often shrink, secure a large field of surgical view so that the suction window can reach it. 15 Place the mouse beneath the objective lens and connect a device to monitor the heart rate of the mouse (we use a LabOx-1 pulse oximeter).\n\nStarting up the thoracic vacuum window system \u2022 Timing 2-3 min 16 Turn on the aspirator connected to the thoracic suction window. 17 Fix the thoracic suction window to the holding block at a 90\u00b0angle and put a round cover glass on the tip of the suction device.\n\n? TROUBLESHOOTING 18 Turn on the suction pressure regulator and adjust the suction pressure to 25-30 mmHg.\n\n19 Lower the thoracic suction window gently to immobilize the mouse lungs (Fig. 4g,h) . The thoracic suction window should cause the lung to stick to the cover glass because of negative pressure. ! CAUTION Carefully move the suction window so as not to scratch the objective. 20 Position the objective lens above the thoracic window. 21 Put water drops on the cover glass by using a pasteur pipette and lower the objective lens to the thoracic suction window (Fig. 4i) . Unmixing of spectrum data and analyzing the images \u2022 Timing 1-2 h per sample 24 To unmix the spectrum data, prepare a reference image of each spectrum in advance. To make a reference image, acquire each fluorescent dye or protein separately without any co-staining and analyze the single fluorescent spectrum. We use the linear unmixing module of the ZEN software for separating spectrum data; however, other commercial or open-source software is available (Table 6 ). 25 Subject unmixed time-series stacks to image registration to correct for tissue drifts and respiratory artifacts. This step is critical to certain analyses, such as long-term tracking of individual cells or subcellular structures. In some cases, a reference channel is required for determining the shift and distortion of the objects. In our studies, we use time-series stacks of blood vessels or collagens for such use, because their localizations are constant over time without substantial changes in shape or structure during the observation. ! CAUTION Some image registration algorithms may cause spatial distortion. Choose algorithms that generate corrected data suitable for your subsequent analyses, especially when examination of the shape and structure of cells and tissues is required. 26 Analyze the movies as required for your experiment.\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 7 .\n\nStep 1, infection: 10-20 min Anticipated results\n\nThe imaging system described in this protocol enables the observation of the behavior of virusinfected cells and immune cells in infected lungs in real time. Typical images of influenza virus-infected lung are shown in Fig. 5a and Supplementary Video 2. When observing while using a multicolor fluorescent label, it is easier to analyze the detected images if the brightness level of each fluorophore is adjusted to make them similar. It is better to choose fluorescent dyes or proteins that possess high fluorescence stability for long-term observations (Tables 2, 4 and 5). We have found that use of MA-Cerulean-viruses or MA-Venus-viruses for infection produces influenza virus-infected cells with sufficient brightness (Table 3) . For labeling immune cells and alveolar cells, we have achieved good results by using the fluorochrome phycoerythrin (PE) for antibody staining and Rosa-tdTomato 42 or -mTFP1 33 mice that were crossed with cell-specific Cre-expressing mice. If using reporter mice expressing a fluorescent protein such as GFP, which is regulated by an endogenous promoter, the expression level of the fluorescent protein should be confirmed. To visualize the lung structure, we use Texas-Red dextran or Qtracker 655 Vascular Labels for the red to far-infrared channel. Mice die during anesthesia The level of anesthesia is too high Decrease the concentration of anesthesia as soon as the mouse shows loss of righting reflex 10\n\nMice regain consciousness during anesthesia\n\nThe level of anesthesia is too low Confirm the concentration of anesthesia; administer the reagents again after a brief pause 15 No heart rate is measured The monitoring probe is mispositioned Make sure that the monitoring probe is in the appropriate place 17\n\nThe cover glass falls off The cover glass does not hold on the suction device Put water droplets on the tip of the suction device and then place the cover glass on it Influenza virus-infected lungs are infiltrated by numerous immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes [43] [44] [45] . An immune cell-specific reporter mouse line can be used to visualize cells infiltrating the alveoli and cells in blood vessels, whereas it is preferable to label intravascular cells by intravenous administration of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies 5, 46, 47 . Consistent with previous reports, intravenously injected antibodies will label only the cells in contact with the blood flow and not those in extravascular regions under our experimental conditions 5 . By administering a fluorescently labeled antibody against neutrophils into neutrophil reporter mice, we can observe the behavior of both the neutrophils infiltrating the influenza-infected lungs and the neutrophils in blood vessels separately (Fig. 5b) . To observe the interaction between different kinds of infiltrating immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, double-reporter mice expressing fluorescent proteins with different spectra but similar brightness have a major advantage (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Video 3) .\n\nCo-infection of the host with different strains of influenza virus can lead to the emergence of reassortant viruses. By infecting mice with Color-flu viruses that produce different fluorescence spectra, we detected alveolar epithelial cells that simultaneously expressed two fluorescent proteins in vivo (Fig. 6) . Visualization of co-infected cells might enable us to better understand the reassortment process of influenza viruses in vivo.\n\nIn summary, the use of this in vivo imaging system for infected animal and multicolor imaging enables us to analyze pathology and immune cell dynamics at the cellular level, which would not be possible by using conventional histopathology methods. This imaging system thus provides a novel and useful approach for investigating viral pathogenicity.\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nThe data that support this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nThe MATLAB scripts are available at https://github.com/KawaokaLab/Ueki_PNAS_2018. \n\nFor all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.\n\nThe exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly\n\nThe statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one-or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.\n\nA description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)\n\nFor null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted\n\nGive P values as exact values whenever suitable.\n\nFor hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.\n\nPolicy information about availability of computer code\n\nTo efficiently excite multiple fluorescent proteins and fluorescent dyes simultaneously, the wavelength of the infrared laser was set at 910 nm. All fluorescent spectra between 410 and 695 nm wavelengths were detected using a 20x water immersion lens (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) and the signals were recorded in lambda image stacks.\n\nWe use the linear unmixing module of ZEN software for separating spectrum data. Unmixed time-series stacks are subjected to image registration to correct for tissue drifts and respiratory artefacts. A reference channel is required for determining the shift and distortion of the objects. In our studies, we employ time-series stacks of blood vessels or collagens for such use, as their localizations are constant over time without significant changes in shapes or structures during the observation.\n\nFor manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors/reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Research guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.\n\nPolicy information about availability of data All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable:\n\n-Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets -A list of figures that have associated raw data -A description of any restrictions on data availability\n\nThe data that support this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nOctober 2018\n\nField-specific reporting Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.\n\nFor a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf\n\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n\nOnly one sample was shown as a representative example that can be obtained by using the imaging protocol.\n\nData exclusions No data was excluded since one representative image was shown.\n\nNo repeated measurements were performed in this paper since one image has been shown as a representative image by using the imaging protocol."}
