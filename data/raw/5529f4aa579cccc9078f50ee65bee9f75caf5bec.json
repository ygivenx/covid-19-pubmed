{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Herbal medicine and pattern identification for treating COVID-19: a rapid review of guidelines Herbal medicine and pattern identification for treating COVID-19: a rapid review of guidelines", "body": "Coronavirus disease 2019 is a newly identified strain of coronavirus that causes illness ranging from effects similar to the common cold to fatal diseases in people across the world. 1 This disease was first identified in early December 2019, and by the middle of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) assessed COVID-19 as a pandemic. 2 As of March 2020, there have been more than 178,700 confirmed cases in at least 140 countries.\n\nThe majority of cases were reported in mainland China, followed by Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea. 3 The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, pneumonia may occur and ultimately lead to organ failure and even death. 4 Currently, there are no available vaccines or specific medicines for the treatment of COVID- 19 . In light of the outbreak, various treatment modalities have been considered, including traditional medicine, which has been widely used during the past epidemic outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza. 5 To date, 2 countries, China and South Korea, have issued traditional medicine treatment guidelines on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Up to March 2020, there have been 7 versions of diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China 6 and 2 versions of guidelines issued in South Korea. 7 A recent systematic review suggested that \"Based on historical records and evidence of SARS and H1NI influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for the prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk populations\" 5 and it focused on prevention method but not treatment methods. Therefore, we aimed to systematically analyze \n\nThe following data sources were searched on February 25, 2020 for eligible traditional medicine guidelines and searched up to March 6 to retrieve the updated version of the guidelines provided:\n\n\u2022 Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) 8\n\n\u2022 \"Chinese guidelines on Novel Coronavirus\" resources 9 by Evidence Aid \n\nThis study focused on the recommended treatment modalities related to traditional medicine for COVID-19. All guidelines that provide traditional medicine treatment measures were included regardless of language, and publication types and years. Guidelines that only provide preventive measures without treatment measures were excluded.\n\nHerbal formulae related to folk medicine were excluded only and other herbal formulae in these guidelines were included. As the guidelines were outlined based on regional characteristics, regional folk medicines, such as Tibetan medicine in Tibet, Mongolian Page 6 of 24 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f medicine in Inner Mongolia, and Miao medicine in Guizhou province, were integrated into their guidelines.\n\nThe data from each included guideline were extracted using a predefined data extraction table.\n\nThe content of the data extraction tables comprised the stages of the disease, pattern identification, clinical symptoms, therapeutic principle, name and composition of herbal formulae, amount of herbs, and country or province of the provided guideline. The pattern identification and herbal formulae were analyzed according to the severity of the disease (mild, moderate, severe and recovered stages). The frequency of herbs recommended in the herbal formulae for each stage of disease was also computed and analyzed.\n\nThe terminology of pattern identification were standardized based on the clinical manifestation provided in the guidelines and Clinic Terminology of Traditional Chinese Medical Diagnosis and Treatment-Syndromes. 13 The herbal formulae with missing names were also renamed by comparing the compositions of these herbal formulae with other named herbal formulae and double-checked them with the Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula 14 . All the terminologies were also standardized based on the WHO international standard terminologies for traditional medicine. 15 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\n\nA total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19\n\nwere found. Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2\n\nKorean medicine-professional associations-issued Korean guidelines. The Japanese government did not officially issue any traditional medicine guidelines on COVID-19, but they adopted a translated version of the national guideline issued by the National Health Commission of China. There were no official traditional medicine guidelines issued in Hong Kong or Taiwan.\n\nIn mainland China, there are currently 7 versions of national diagnosis and treatment guidelines, and traditional medicine content has been included since the third version. 6 Using the government-issued national guidelines as a reference, 17 provinces, 4 municipalities and 4 autonomous regions in mainland China officially issued traditional medicine-related guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. All the guidelines were devised by local health authorities according to regional characteristics and local prevalence of COVID-19 and have been continuously updated since the first issuance. 5\n\nIn Korea, the Association of Korean Medicine and the Korean Association of Traditional Pulmonary Medicine each issued the first version of traditional medicine guidelines on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 at the end of February 2020. 7 Both guidelines were drafted by clinical experts who were also regularly updated by both associations to provide clinical guidance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in South Korea.\n\nIn the frequency analysis of the herbs used in the herbal formulae for treating patients with COVID-19 according to the patients' disease stages and PIs (Tables 1-5), the results showed that there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage (Table 1) ; 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage ( Table 2) ; 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage (Table 3) ; and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage (Table 4) in the Chinese guidelines. The Korean guidelines suggested 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 3 PIs and 3 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 2 PIs and 2 herbal formulae for the recovery stage (Table 5) .\n\nAmong the Chinese guidelines, we also found that most of the herbal formulae were On the other hand, the herbal formula of Qingfei Paidu Tang, which is a combination of 4 different herbal formulae with 21 herbs (Tables 1-4), was recommended by the Chinese national diagnosis and treatment guidelines in the treatment of COVID-19 regardless of disease stage or regional status. This herbal formula was also recommended for the treatment of severe stage in the Korean guidelines (Table 5 ).\n\nIn addition, the frequency of the herbs used in the herbal formulae recommended by the Chinese guidelines for every stage and in total were computed ( Figure 1 ). The results showed that these formulae contain 12 herbs with a frequency of use 30 or more times in the treatment formulae in all stages. Both Armeniacae Semen Amarum and Ephedrae Herba were found to be the top 10 herbs with the highest frequency of use in the mild, moderate and severe stages. The Gypsum Fibrosum and Lepidii seu Descurainiae Semen were also the top 10 most common herbs used in the moderate and severe stages. In addition, Agastachis Herba, Forsythiae Fructus, Atractylodis Rhizoma, and Scutellariae Radix were also highly used in both the mild and moderate stages. Notably, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was found in the top 10 herbs with the highest usage frequency in all four stages. It was also the herb with the highest frequency of usage in total.\n\nIn this review, we systematically summarized and analyzed all the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines according to their pattern identification and herbal compositions. The Chinese medicine herbs used for the prevention of COVID-19 based on 23 provincial guidelines issued in mainland China were reviewed and analyzed in a recent publication. 5 With reference to it, but in contrast, our review focused on the traditional medicine treatment measures recommended by all available guidelines. We extended our search of guidelines to nearby countries and reviewed guidelines issued by mainland China (25 provincial guidelines and 1 national guideline) and South Korea to conduct a more comprehensive review.\n\nFor the frequency analysis of herbs used in every Chinese guideline for COVID-19, each stage has several herbs that were not shown in the list of top 10 frequently used herbs for other stages. For instance, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex and Platycodonis Radix could only be seen for the mild stage. Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex is often prescribed for the treatment of various gastrointestinal problems, such as fullness in the stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea from dampness. Platycodonis Radix is usually prescribed for coughs with excessive phlegm and sore throat due to exogenous pathogens. 16 It could be inferred that gastrointestinal symptoms due to dampness and sore throat as well as coughing with sputum are the primary clinical manifestation in the mild stage of COVID-19. The active components contained in these 2 herbs also showed anti-inflammatory benefits in the in vivo studies of the acute lung injury model. 17, 18 In the severe stage, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma were identified to be frequently used but not in other stages. This could be due to the extreme PIs Praeparata is known to treat heart failure and has anti-asthmatic and anti-epileptic properties. 19, 20 The combination of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma is also highly compatible, and this combination is often used in various herbal formulae. As these herbs have a certain degree of toxicity, they have to be used in caution and preferably are reserved for extreme cases. Moreover, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma also has an anti-inflammatory quality which is suitable for the treatment of inflammatory lung condition in The herbal formula Qingfei Paidu Tang was recommended by both Chinese and Korean guidelines. In the Chinese guidelines, this formula is recommended for all stages. According to a recent publication 26 , this herbal formula increases immunology and reduces inflammation by targeting the lung and spleen, which are the disease pathways of COVID-19. However, the herb Farfarae Flos was removed in the Korean guidelines due to its safety and toxicity. 27 This review has several limitations. First, the results of this review were obtained after standardizing the terms of the PIs and herbal formulae. Therefore, there might be a difference in the terms used in the provided guidelines. Second, this review does not include any direct evidence on the efficacy of traditional medicine in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. The results provided by this review are a summary of the traditional medicine guidelines, which can only be considered as guidance, and clinical verification is still required. Third, although this review summarized the most recent version of the national and provincial guidelines available up to March 6, 2020, the guidelines issued on COVID-19 by the Chinese government are constantly and frequently updated.
