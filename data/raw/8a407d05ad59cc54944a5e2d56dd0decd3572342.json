{"title": "Air Pollution Reduction and Mortality Benefit during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China 1", "body": "To control the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, China undertook stringent 15 traffic restrictions and self-quarantine measures, first in Wuhan and neighboring cities beginning 16 on January 23, 2020, and two days later, in all provinces in China ( Figure 1A) . The countrywide 17 ban on traffic mobility greatly limited transportation emissions, whereas emissions from 18 residential heating and industry remained steady or slightly declined. 1 We herein examine the 19 change in air pollution levels and the potentially avoided cause-specific mortality during this 20 massive population quarantine episode. 21\n\nAs of March 14, 2020, new confirmed COVID-19 cases in China reported by the National 22\n\nHealth Commission (NHC) dropped to 20 (4 from Wuhan) ( Figure 1A ). Most Chinese provinces 23 have lowered the level of emergency responses. We thus defined the \"during quarantine\" period 24 as February 10 to March 14 and the \"before quarantine\" period as January 5 to 20. We excluded 25 the Chinese New Year holidays to avoid non-quarantine related air pollution reductions, based 26 on evidence from previous years ( Figure 1B) . We obtained daily concentrations of nitrogen 27 dioxide (NO 2 ) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in 367 Chinese cities. We then applied a 28 difference-in-difference approach to quantify air pollution changes due to the quarantine. 29\n\nSpecifically, we calculated changes in air quality during vs. before the quarantine period in 2020, 30 and compared these with corresponding changes in the same lunar calendar periods in 2016-31 2019. Details of the material, methods, and numeric results are provided in the Supplementary 32\n\nAppendix. 33\n\nWe found that, due to the quarantine, NO 2 dropped by 22.8 \u00b5g/m 3 and 12.9 \u00b5g/m 3 in Wuhan and 34\n\nChina, respectively. PM 2.5 dropped by 1.4 \u00b5g/m 3 in Wuhan but decreased by 18.9 \u00b5g/m 3 across 35 367 cities. The dramatic decline in NO 2 across China during the quarantine period was also 36 detected by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite using the NO 2 tropospheric column density 37 ( Figure 1C) . 38\n\nWe then calculated the avoided cause-specific mortality attributable to these decreases in CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039842 doi: medRxiv preprint deaths, 65% of which were from cardiovascular diseases (hypertensive disease, coronary heart 44 disease, and stroke) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ( Figure 1D ). Further, 45 we estimate that PM 2.5 reductions during the quarantine period avoided a total of 3214 (95% CI: 46 2340, 4087) PM 2.5 -related deaths in China, 73% of which were from cardiovascular diseases and 47 COPD. These numbers should be interpreted with caution due to the potential overlap between 48 PM 2.5 -and NO 2 -related mortality and the disrupted healthcare systems during quarantine to 49 conduct a timely treatment for patients with chronic diseases. 50\n\nWe conclude that interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak led to air quality 51 improvements that brought health benefits which outnumbered the confirmed deaths due to 52 CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039842 doi: medRxiv preprint"}
