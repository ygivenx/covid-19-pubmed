{"title": "Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of (2-oxaadamant-1- yl)amines", "body": "1-Adamantylamine (amantadine) and its 3,5-dimethyl analogue, memantine, are NMDA receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. 1 Amantadine also has prophylactic and therapeutic activities in influenza A virus infections 2 , and related adamantane derivatives show antiviral activity. 3 Moreover, amantadine, memantine, and related polycyclic amines possess trypanocidal properties. 4 It is well known in medicinal chemistry that substitution of a methylene unit in a bioactive compound for an oxygen atom usually leads to analogues showing similar activity to the parent compound. 5 Indeed, NGP1-01, a brain-permeable, oxa-polycyclic cage amine, is a dual action uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist and blocker of L-type calciumchannels. In addition, several experiments have shown that NGP1-01 has neuroprotective activity ( Fig. 1) . 6 intracellular calcium that was challenged with cumulative additions of the compounds to be tested. The data presented in Table 1 indicate that the presence of a substituent in C-3 in the 2-oxaadamantane nucleus is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Thus, primary amine 7 and all its N-alkylated and N-dialkylated derivatives (2a,b, 3a,b, 4, and 8) are inactive as it is the case of the methyl derivatives 10a and 11a. Phenyl derivative 10c is only a weak NMDA receptor antagonist while more lipophilic amines 10b and 10d show a similar potency than amantadine. Further enhancement in potency was achieved by alkylation of 10b, the most active derivative being 12, a tertiary amine that is seven times more potent than amantadine, but still ten times less potent than memantine. Contrary to our expectations, all the benzyl derivatives were found to be inactive. This is in striking contrast with NGP1-01 that features a benzyl group essential for NMDA receptor antagonism, and with previous work by our groups that found that benzylated ring-contracted analogues of amantadine showed NMDA receptor antagonism. 12\n\nPrimary amines 7, 10c, and 10d and secondary amines 2a, 4, and 15 were tested for antiviral activity. None of the tested compounds displayed activity against the enveloped DNA viruses herpes simplex virus (type 1 or type 2) or vaccinia virus; the enveloped RNA viruses feline coronavirus, parainfluenza-3 virus, respiratory syncytial virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, or Punta Toro virus; or the non-enveloped RNA viruses Coxsackie-virus B4 and Reovirus-1. Also none of the compounds was found to be active against influenza virus A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B.\n\nProtozoan parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei species complex are the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis, a disease that is invariably fatal unless treated. However, current drugs are characterized by toxicity, the need for administration under medical supervision, and in many cases, a lack of efficacy. New drugs to combat this important disease are urgently needed. A range of adamantylamine compounds have trypanocidal activity. 4 We therefore investigated whether this property also extended to (2-oxaadamant-1-yl)amine derivatives.\n\nAll the new derivatives described in this paper were tested for potency against cultured bloodstream form T. brucei. As was the case with the NMDA receptor antagonism, the presence of a substitution at the C-3 position in the 2-oxadamantane nucleus was found to be essential for trypanocidal activity. Of these compounds, the tertiary amines 11a,b were found to be the most active. Amine 11b had an IC 50 = 10.92 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM and an IC 90 = 15.54 \u00b1 1.14 \u03bcM, while the trimethyl derivative 11a had an IC 50 = 3.97 \u00b1 0.75 \u03bcM and an IC 90 = 6.82 \u00b1 0.84 \u03bcM. Amine 11a was the most potent compound tested, being approximately twice as active as rimantadine (IC 50 = 7.04 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcM; IC 90 = 13.97 \u00b1 1.68 \u03bcM), and at least 30 times more active than amantadine (IC 50 > 130 \u03bcM). Amines 2a,b, 3a,b, 4, 7, and 8, which lack the C3 substitution, had no activity at concentrations up to 5 mg mL \u22121 . The primary and secondary amines 10a-d, 13, and 15 also displayed no significant trypanocidal properties, even though they do carry a substitution at this position.\n\nSeveral adamantane derivatives have previously been shown to have trypanocidal properties; however the oxanalogues reported here are the first heteroadamantanes to show significant activity against bloodstream form T. brucei. 4\n\nIn summary, we have synthesized and fully characterized several (2-oxaadamant-1yl)amines. The presence of a substitution at the C-3 position is essential for NMDA receptor antagonism. Although 11b, 12, and 15 were more potent than amantadine against NMDAinduced calcium increase in cerebellar granule neurons, they were less potent than memantine. In contrast with the model compound NGP1-01, all our benzyl derivatives were devoid of NMDA receptor antagonism activity. None of the tested compounds showed antiviral activity. Two tertiary amines, 11a and 11b, displayed a significant level of trypanocidal activity; 11a was twice as active as rimantadine. The mechanism by which adamantylamine derivatives kill trypanosomes is unknown, but it has been hypothesized by analogy with the known properties of this class of compound that it may involve channel blocking activity. 4 The data obtained with the trimethyl amine 11a now provides a basis for exploring if related derivatives have enhanced activity.\n\nThe synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of more polycyclic cage amines are in progress.\n\nwere determined in open capillary tubes.

Cells were loaded with 6 \u03bcM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Afterwards, the coverslip was mounted on a quartz cuvette containing a Locke-Hepes buffer using a special holder.

Analysis from each sample was recorded real-time during 1200 s.

In the case of untreated cultures (volume 4 mL), cell densities increased from 0.5 \u00d7 10 4 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells mL \u22121 over this period. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell densities at each drug concentration were determined using a hemocytometer (Weber Scientific International Ltd), and drug sensitivity was expressed as a percentage of growth of control cells. Amantadine, memantine, and NGP1-01 structures. "}
