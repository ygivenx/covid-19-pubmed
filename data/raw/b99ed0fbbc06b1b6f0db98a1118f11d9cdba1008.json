{"title": "Synthesis of enantiomerically pure D-and L-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleosides and their antiviral evaluation", "body": "In the 25 years since the initial discovery that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the disease has grown into a global infectious disease. 1 HIV is a pathogenic retrovirus and requires reverse transcriptase (RT) to copy its single-stranded RNA genome into a doublestranded DNA copy for integration in the host cell. 2 Therefore, RT of AIDS virus has been the most important candidate for the treatment of AIDS. In the search for an effective chemotherapeutic agent of HIV infections for targeting RT, initial attempts were focused on the development of 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxynucleosides (ddNs) and 2 0 ,3 0 -didehydro-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxynucleosides (d4Ns). 3,4 Among them, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) 5 such as 3 0 -azido-3 0 -deoxythymidine (AZT), 6 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxyinosine (ddI), 7 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxycytidine (ddC), 8 L-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy-3 0 -thiacytidine (3TC) 9 and 2 0 ,3 0 -didehydro-2 0 ,3 0dideoxythymidine (d4T) 10 have been widely used to treat AIDS patients (Fig. 1) .\n\nParticularly, an important structural characteristic of d4T is the presence of a 2 0 ,3 0 -double bond, which renders the pseudosugar ring to be nearly planar and highly rigid. Other potent NRTIs, such as abacavir (ABC), 11 and 2 0 ,3 0 -didehydro-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy-2 0 -fluorocytidine (d4FC), 12 have also a double bond on their sugar ring. In this respect, the 2 0 ,3 0 -double bond is considered to be crucial for plays in enhancing anti-HIV activity (Fig. 2) .\n\nHowever, oxanucleosides belonging to ddNs and d4Ns, have intrinsic weakness that their glycosidic bond is unstable to acidic conditions involving a gastric environment and to enzymes such as pyrimidine and purine phosphorylases. 13 In spite of the defect, ddNs and d4Ns derivatives have been the most promising candidates for AIDS treatment. To overcome easy cleavage of the glycosidic bond of oxanucleosides, carbocyclic nucleosides, 14 which have a methylene group instead of the ring oxygen atom of tetrahydrofuran in oxanucleosides, have been synthesized with an anticipation of searching for better antiviral profile and lower cytotoxicity with improved stability.\n\nConformationally rigid methanocarba (MC) nucleosides built on a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template have a south (S, 3 E) 15 or north (N, 2 E) 16 conformation in the pseudorotational cycle, 17 which is a conformation normal nucleosides take for the most time (Fig. 3) . When nucleosides bind to the active site of enzymes, each conformer exhibits different affinity. Therefore, rigid MC nucleosides have been used to investigate the conformational preferences of 0968 was synthesized in two steps according to the procedure reported by Tsuji and co-workers. 24, 25 Reaction of (R)-epichlorohydrin with diethyl malonate and sodium metal gave cyclopropane-fused c-lactone 6 via tandem alkylation followed by lactonization. The lactone moiety of 6 might be more susceptible to hydrolysis than the ester, maybe due to the structural constraint caused by a fused cyclopropane ring. Treatment of 6 with 1 equiv of sodium hydroxide in EtOH afforded monocarboxylate sodium salt 6a, the ester of which was selectively reduced by sodium borohydride under reflux and then recyclized back to c-lactone 7 under acidic conditions. Protection of hydroxyl group of 7 with tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride produced silyl ether 8, which was reduced with Dibal-H at \u00c078\u00b0C to afford the corresponding lactol 9 in 97% yield. Wittig reaction of lactol 9 with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide afforded hydroxy olefin 10 in 88% yield after quenching with saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl solution. However, when the reaction mixture was partitioned between EtOAc and water without quenching with saturated NH 4 Cl aqueous solution after the Wittig reaction, a new byproduct appeared at a higher R f value than that of the desired compound 10 in 10-20% yield. It turned out to be an acetylated compound 10a by 1 H, 13 C, COSY (Correlation spectroscopy) and HMBC (Heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) NMR experiments. The acetyl group might be derived from ethyl acetate used for extraction due to basic reaction conditions. Swern oxidation of 10 with oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide at \u00c078\u00b0C smoothly proceeded to produce aldehyde 11, which was subjected to a Grignard reaction with vinylmagnesium bromide to afford allylic alcohols 12 (48%) and 13 (39%), easily separated by normal silica gel column chromatography. The stereochemistry of 12 and 13 was not determined until the corresponding bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenol scaffold was formed via a RCM (ring-closure metathesis) reaction in the next step. RCM reaction 26 of dienes 12 and 13 with a second generation Grubbs catalyst produced the bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-en-2-ol analogs, (2R)-14 and (2S)-14, respectively. The stereochemistry of them was confirmed by comparing their 1 H NMR spectra with that of the authentic enantio-counterpart, an enantiomer of (2S)-14, prepared from a chiral bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template, 27 indicating that the RCM product (2S)-14 derived from compound 13 has the desired (2S)-stereochemistry for a Mitsunobu reaction with nucleobases to yield various conformationally locked nucleo-sides. (2R)-14 can be also potential starting material for a palladium-mediated coupling reaction with nucleobases to produce the desired b-anomer.\n\nSynthesis of uracil and thymine L-nucleoside derivatives, L-1 and L-2 is shown in Scheme 2. Condensation of the glycosyl donor, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenol (2S)-14 with N 3 -benzoyluracil and N 3 -benzoylthymine under Mitsunobu conditions 28 smoothly proceeded to give protected N 3 -benzoyluracil nucleoside 15 and protected N 3 -benzoylthymine nucleoside 16, respectively, in 21% and 40% yield. Finally, deprotection of N 3 -benzoyl group of compounds 15 and 16 with ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution in methanol followed by desilylation with TBAF (n-tetrabutylammonium fluoride) gave the desired uracil and thymine L-nucleosides, L-1 and L-2, respectively, in 85% and 91% yield. On the other hand, the corresponding cytosine analog L-3 was synthesized starting from the uracil nucleoside analog L-1, via acetylation of the free hydroxyl group followed by successive three conventional reactions ((i) 1,2,4-triazole, phosphorus oxychloride, pyridine; (ii) ammonium hydroxide, 1,4-dioxane; (iii) methanolic ammonia), 29 in overall 42% yield (Scheme 3).\n\nSynthesis of adenine L-nucleoside L-4 is depicted in Scheme 4. Under Mitsunobu conditions, coupling of (2S)-14 with 6-chloropurine generated protected 6-chloropurine nucleoside 18 in 21% yield. Amination with methanolic ammonia at 80\u00b0C to adenine nucleoside followed by desilylation of TBDPS group with TBAF gave the final adenine L-nucleoside L-4 in 44% yield from 18. For the synthesis of guanine nucleoside L-5, condensation of (2S)-14 with 2-amino-6-chloropurine under Mitsunobu conditions afforded protected 2-amino-6-chloropurine nucleoside 19 (Scheme 4), which was subjected to desilylation with 1 M TBAF and conversion of 2-amino-6-chloropurine nucleobase into guanine with 2mercaptoethanol and 1 N NaOMe under reflux to produce guanine L-nucleoside L-5. The yields of each Mitsunobu condensation are generally low, probably because the fixed conformation induced by the fused cyclopropyl group and the double bond causes the backside attack of nucleobases to be disfavorable. In case of the locked conformation, increased steric hindrance between a methinyl hydrogen or a 4 0 -methylene group and nucleobase is expected. Antiviral activities with the final conformation-locked D-and Lcarbanucleosides were evaluated against HIV-1 (IIIB) and -2 (ROD), coxsackie B1 and B3 viruses, and HSV-1 and -2. First, when tested in MT-4 (HTLV-1 and -2-infected human T lymphocyte) cells, among the final nucleosides thymine nucleoside analogs D-2 and L-2 showed the most potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activity and their IC 50 values against HIV-1 and -2 were 0.033 and 0.112 lg/mL for D-2, and 1.175 and 2.270 lg/mL for L-2, respectively ( Table 1 ).\n\nThe bigger difference in the two strains (IIIB and ROD) in the activity of D-2 than in that of L-2 reflects that L-nucleosides might fit almost equally at both the active sites of the two strains, whereas D-nucleosides might fit better at the active site for IIIB strain than that for ROD strain. Comparison of IC 50 values of D-2 and L-2 against HIV-1 and -2 with those (2.31 and 2.76 lg/mL) of ddI, which is clinically used for the treatment of AIDS patients indicates that both thymine nucleosides D-2 and L-2 exhibit more potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities than ddI used as a positive control. Although anti-HIV activity of D-2 exceeds that of L-2, L-2 (CC 50 >100 lg mL \u00c01 ) is less cytotoxic than D-2 (CC 50 = 8.558 lg mL \u00c01 ), which corresponds to the fact that L-nucleosides have been generally known to be less toxic than D-counterpart. Selective indexes (CC 50 /EC 50 ) toward HIV-1 and -2 showed 263 and 76, respectively, for D-2 and more than 85.09 and more than 44.05, respectively, for 18 dro-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxynucleosides whereas coxsakie viruses and poliovirus belong to RNA viruses. This point might result in lack of antiviral activities against coxsakie viruses and poliovirus. Antiviral evaluation against HSV-1 and -2 was conducted and only L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 showed weak anti-HSV-2 activity (IC 50 = 59.23 lg mL \u00c01 ) without discernible cytotoxicity. Antiviral inhibition of L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 was also performed against FluA (influenza virus type A) (H1N1) strain Taiwan, FluA (H3N2) strain Johannesburg, FluB (influenza virus type B) strain Panama, FCV (feline coronavirus) strain WSU, and FIP (feline infectious peritonitis virus) strain WSU, but it neither showed antiviral activity nor cytotoxicity up to 100 lg mL \u00c01 (not shown), maybe because both influenza and corona viruses are viruses with a RNA genome.\n\nAll L-nucleosides did not show any cytotoxicity up to 100 lg mL \u00c01 in all cell lines tested.\n\nAccording to the obtained antiviral and cytotoxic results, D-and L-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleosides synthesized exerts their antiviral activity for DNA virus such as HSV-2 and AIDS virus requiring a RNA-dependent DNA polymerization process during its life-cycle and L-nucleoside is less cytotoxic than D-nucleoside (e.g., L-2 vs D-2 and L-4 vs D-4).\n\nIn order to search for new anti-HIV agents with high potency and less cytotoxicity, D-and L-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenyl carbanucleoside derivatives were designed and synthesized by a novel synthetic strategy starting from (S)-and (R)-epichlorohydrin, respectively. A tandem alkylation, c-lactonization, a chemoselective reduction of ester in the presence of c-lactone functional group, a Grignard reaction, a RCM reaction, and a Mitsunobu coupling reaction were used as key reactions to achieve the synthesis of north conformation-locked D-and L-carbanucleoside analogs. The synthesized bicyclic carbanucleosides were characterized by 1 H, 13 C, HMBC, HSQC and COSY NMR, mass and UV spectra, melting point and optical rotation. D-Thymine nucleoside, D-2 and L-thymine nucleoside, L-2 were found to show more potent anti-HIV-1 and -2 activities than ddI in MT-4 cells. Whereas D-2 exhibited cytotoxicity (CC 50 = 8.558 lg mL \u00c01 ), L-2 did not show any discernible cytotoxicity, suggesting that L-2 may be a better candidate for the development of novel anti-AIDS drug than D-2. L-2 was also found to exhibit weak anti-HSV-2 activity without cytotoxicity. In addition, antiviral activities against RNA viruses such as coxsakie viruses, and poliovirus were tested, but all compounds did not show any significant antiviral activities, maybe due to a 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy structure of the compounds. L-2 was also evaluated against other RNA viruses such as influenza and corona viruses, but showed neither antiviral activity nor cytotoxicity. It is interesting to note that all L-nucleosides did not show cytotoxicity up to 100 lg mL \u00c01 in all cells tested. Probably, the low cytotoxicity of L-nucleosides may be closely associated with a L-type, an unnatural type. Potent antiviral activities of D-and L-thymine carbanucleosides, D-2 and L-2 indicate that a nucleoside belonging to a class of D4Ns can be an excellent candidate for anti-AIDS drug and anti-DNA virus agents. This research strongly supports L-nucleosides of a class of D4Ns to be a very promising candidate for antiviral agents due to its low cytotoxicity.\n\nAll chemical reagents were commercially available.

To harvest HIV-1, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing infectious HIV-1 was aliquoted and stored at \u00c070\u00b0C in a refrigerator (deep freezer; ULT-1685, REVOC).\n\nThe MT-4 cells 30 (1.0 \u00c2 10 5 cells/mL) were exposed to cell-free HIV-1 HTLV-IIIB or HIV-2 ROD at a dose of 100 TCID 50 /mL (50% tissue culture infectious dose) and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. The compounds were tested and compared to ddI and ddC obtained from Sigma for cytotoxicity and for their ability to inhibit HIV replication. The compounds were first dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted with RPMI-1640/10% FBS just before use. The maximum final concentration of DMSO added to the cell cultures was 0.5% at the highest concentration of the compound. We have determined that at that concentration DMSO does not interfere with cell growth. The HIV-1-induced cytopathic effects were monitored by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay. In the microplate tests (96 wells), 50 lL of each compound diluted or phosphate-buffered 0.85% (w/v) sodium chloride (PBS) alone was distributed in triplicate. The cells were adjusted to 1.0 \u00c2 10 5 cells/mL and then were plated in each well at the rate of 200 lL per well. A virus suspension (200 lL) was added to the cells with or without drugs and cultured for 6 days.\n\n4.1.22. Cytotoxicity by MTT assay 31, 32 Infected cultures were carried out in parallel to determine the cytotoxicity of the compound. Briefly, 100 lL of a cell suspension was collected and mixed with 10 lL of a solution of MTT at 7.5 mg/mL in PBS. After 1.5 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, most of the supernatant was removed, and the formazan precipitate was dissolved in 100 lL of 0.04 N HCl in 2-propanol. The absorbance at 540 and 690 nm was measured on a multiwall scanning spectrophotometer (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader; ERA-400, SLT). The percentage of toxicity was defined with uninfected and untreated control cells. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was defined as the concentration required to reduce the viability of uninfected cells at 5 days of incubation in the presence of the compounds. The concentration achieving 50% protection or the concentration required to inhibit HIV-induced destruction of MT-4 cells by 50% was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ).\n\nHIV-infected or uninfected MT-4 cells (1.0 \u00c2 10 5 cells/mL) as target cells were suspended with various concentrations of the samples and cultured for 5 days in a CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. The anti-AIDS activities of the samples were evaluated after 5 days of HIV infection."}
