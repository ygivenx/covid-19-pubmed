{"title": "Influenza A non-H1N1 associated with acute respiratory failure and\nacute renal failure in a previously vaccinated cystic fibrosis\npatient", "body": "Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an acute, contagious respiratory disease\ncaused by influenza A or B viruses. It is estimated that 10% of the world population\nhas at least one annual influenza episode. Patients with chronic disease, especially\nchronic lung disease, are more susceptible to serious complications caused by\ninfluenza.(1)\n\nIn December 2014, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that\ninfluenza activity in the northern hemisphere from November 2014 to early 2015 was\nmainly caused by the influenza A H3N2 virus. In addition, it was evidenced during\nthis period that the effectiveness of the 2014 - 2015 vaccine for the northern\nhemisphere was very low, which was attributed to the fact that the circulating H3N2\nvirus was genetically different from the A H3N2 virus component of the vaccine, a\nfact attributed to a drift of the H3N2 virus after vaccine\ndevelopment.(2) A similar phenomenon occurred with the 2015 vaccine\nfor the southern hemisphere, leading to the low effectiveness of vaccine\nprotection.(3)\n\n\nRecent evidence shows that, in cystic fibrosis (CF), respiratory viruses play an\nimportant role in this pathophysiological process, causing pulmonary exacerbations\nand leading to lung disease progression with increased bacterial\nadhesion.(4) In particular, influenza virus is associated with\nmore severe exacerbations, leading to prolonged hospitalizations, predisposing to\nbacterial infections and causing disease progression and marked loss in lung\nfunction.(5)\n\n\nThis study aimed to report a case of seasonal influenza A non-H1N1 that occurred in\nJune 2015 in a patient with CF who received the trivalent influenza vaccine in April\n2015 and developed acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure without\nrhabdomyolysis after infection.\n\nA male, 39-year-old Caucasian, diagnosed with CF since age 9 years old, homozygous\nfor the F508del mutation, had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, CF-related\ndiabetes mellitus, obstructive azoospermia, chronic lung\ndisease, bronchiectasis and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa\ninfection. Prior spirometry, with severe airflow limitation and reduction of forced\nvital capacity, is presented in table 1.\n\nIn June 2015, he was admitted to the emergency room of the Hospital de\nCl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre, with continuous fever for 2 days (>\n38.5\u00baC), severe cough, increased volume and purulence of expectoration, prostration,\nheadache and progressive dyspnea. He denied myalgia. He reported that his wife, son\nand two other family members previously had respiratory symptoms, high fever and\nmyalgias in the last week. He had regularly taken the flu vaccine and had received\nthe trivalent vaccine in April 2015.\n\nAt the physical examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 70/45mmHg, a heart\nrate of 105bpm, a respiratory rate of 30rpm, was cyanotic with accessory breathing\nmuscle and prolonged expiratory time and had a peripheral oxygen saturation\n(SpO2) of 57% in ambient air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular\ntwo-beat rhythm; lung auscultation indicated vesicular murmur present in both lung\nfields, with diffuse fine and coarse rales; the patient's abdomen was without\nchanges, and his extremities were well perfused.\n\nInitial laboratory tests showed a 34% hematocrit, 10.2g/dL hemoglobin, 22,660\nleukocytes/mm3, 2% band-shaped, 86% segmented, 6% monocytes, 5%\nmonocytes, 1% metamyelocyte, 95mg/dL urea, 2.37mg/dL creatinine (prior it was\n0.79mg/dL), 6.6mEq/L potassium, 3.2mmol/L lactate, 145mg/dL C-reactive protein and\n189U/L creatine phosphokinase (normal up to 190U/L). Common urine test results\nrevealed citrine yellow urine, 26 leukocytes/\u00b5L, 13 red blood cells/\u00b5L\nand negative hemoglobin. An arterial blood gas test revealed 5 L/min oxygen per\nexternal nasal catheter, with a pH of 7.21, a partial carbon dioxide pressure\n(PaCO2) of 56.1mmHg, 24.4mEq/L bicarbonate, a\npartial oxygen pressure (PaO2) of 68.4mmHg and an oxygen\nsaturation of 97%. The patient's chest X-ray is shown in figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe received volume replacement with saline, correcting the systemic arterial\npressure. Antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam and intravenous\ntobramycin was initiated based on the sensitivity test of the last bacteriological\nexamination of the sputum. Still within the first 24 hours of admission, noninvasive\nventilation (NIV) and antiviral coverage with oseltamivir were initiated. After 48\nhours of hospitalization, he evolved with respiratory failure and was transferred to\nthe intensive care unit (ICU), requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical\nventilation. Initially, the patient was ventilated with controlled pressure, an\ninspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 0.40, a positive end-expiratory\npressure (PEEP) of 8cmH2O, a pressure over PEEP of 14cmH2O, a\nrespiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, a tidal volume of 340mL and a\nPaO2/FiO2 of\n198mmHg, fulfilling the criteria for acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome.(6)\n\n\nThere was also worsening renal function with an increase of creatinine to 5.87mg/dL\nand oliguria. Dialysis treatment was initiated with continuous hemodialysis. The\nantibiotic scheme was modified to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, maintaining\npiperacillin/tazobactam.\n\nOn the fifth day of hospitalization, a viral investigation was performed via\npolymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal secretion sample, collected at the\ntime of admission. The test was positive for influenza A non-H1N1 (an investigation\nof a universal gene of influenza A strains was positive, but the swine lines by gene\namplification of H1 hemagglutinin and virus nucleoprotein were negative). The use of\noseltamivir was maintained for 5 days.\n\nThere was favorable evolution and, 7 days after hospital admission, the patient could\nbe extubated and was placed on NIV again. He was then on intermittent dialysis and\nwas discharged from the ICU. In the ward, 1 week after discharge from the ICU, he\nexperienced sudden worsening and was returned to the ICU but was managed with NIV,\nwith a 2-day stay. Angiotomography of the thorax excluded the possibility of\npulmonary embolism. The antibiotic scheme was modified to meropenem and polymyxin B\n(a new sputum culture evidenced multi-resistant P. aeruginosa). He\nexperienced progressive clinical improvement of his respiratory condition and\nresolution of acute renal failure. Hospital discharge occurred 39 days after\nadmission.\n\nOn discharge, he received standard treatment for CF and continuous home oxygen\ntherapy and was referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Since the event, he\nhas not required a new hospital stay. The patient's last spirometry is presented in\ntable 1. In December 2016 (18 months\nafter the event), the patient was in pulmonary rehabilitation with oxygen therapy\nfor exercise and at night, and he had been referred for lung transplantation (but\nnot yet active on the list due to clinical stability).\n\nWith recent advances in CF treatment and intensive medicine, patients with advanced\nlung disease are living longer.(7) The present case report shows the evolution of\nan adult patient with previous severe lung disease, but stable, with acute\nrespiratory failure, sepsis and acute renal failure, triggered by influenza, with a\ngood clinical outcome after intensive support and documentation of clinical\nstability after 18 months of evolution.\n\nEpidemiological data on influenza 2014 - 2015 show that the vaccine was effective in\npreventing 19% of influenza visits in all age groups; specifically, 18% for\ninfluenza A H3N2 and 45% for influenza B. Despite the low effectiveness of the\ninfluenza vaccine, influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged\n\u2265 6 months.(2)\n\nAntiviral medications, especially oseltamivir, are used as adjunctive measures to\nvaccination in the control of influenza.(1) The physician should consider that\ninfluenza activity is widespread; this diagnosis should always be considered in all\ncases of severe acute respiratory syndrome.(8-10) In the present case, the identification of the\ninfluenza A virus was made via molecular biology testing of the nasopharynx\naspirate, emphasizing that our laboratory identified the presence of influenza A,\nexcluding the presence of influenza virus H1N1. However, subtyping of the H3N2 virus\nwas not performed. According to epidemiological data from the Department of Health\nof Rio Grande do Sul(11) and the Ministry of Health of\nBrazil,(12) the virus with the largest circulation in 2015 was\ninfluenza A H2N3. Thus, the viral identification of the reported case most likely\ncorresponds to influenza A H3N2, which explains the disease despite adequate patient\nvaccination coverage.\n\nEvidence for treating severe influenza is limited; therefore, recommendations on\nroute of administration, dosage and time of use follow the general guidelines. The\nadministration of oseltamivir via the nasogastric or nasoenteric route seems to\nguarantee adequate systemic absorption in the majority of cases of severe influenza.\nThe standard oseltamivir regimen at a dose of 75mg every 12 hours is recommended.\nHowever, although there is no definitive evidence, there are recommendations, in\nwhich, depending on clinical judgment, treatment time may be prolonged in severe\ncases and doses may also be doubled (150mg every 12 hours). In the present case, the\ntreatment was initiated early orally at admission and was subsequently maintained by\nnasoenteric route, but at usual doses and time.(8)\n\nRenal involvement in individuals infected with influenza A is uncommon. Acute renal\nfailure has been most commonly reported in critically ill patients with\nH1N1.(13) Reports of renal failure in cases of influenza A\nnon-H1N1 are rare. The pathogenic mechanisms for the development of renal injury in\ninfluenza A virus infection are not fully understood. Potential causes are\nrhabdomyolysis, direct renal damage by virus, sepsis-related renal hypoperfusion and\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. Among them, rhabdomyolysis has been\nthe most frequently reported cause.(14) In the reported case, there was no evidence of\nrhabdomyolysis (absence of myalgias, urine was not dark, there was no hematuria on\nthe reactant tape and creatine phosphokinase was normal). The most likely mechanism\nfor renal injury was sepsis and renal hypoperfusion.\n\nAfter 18 months of follow-up, the evolution of the presented case of cystic fibrosis\nwith advanced lung disease, complicated by infection by influenza A non-H1N1 with\nrespiratory sepsis, acute respiratory failure and acute renal failure was\nfavorable."}
