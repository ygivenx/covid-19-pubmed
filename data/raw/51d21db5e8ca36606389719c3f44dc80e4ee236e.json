{"title": "Novel Viruses, Zoonotic Infections, and Travel Health Q1 Q4", "body": "o you know what a zoonosis is? It is a microorganism that is pathogenic, but one that is carried by an animal and transferred to humans. A zoonotic disease may be a virus, parasite, fungus, or bacteria. Most viruses transferred in this way are manifested by a mild respiratory infection similar to the common cold. However, occasionally a zoonosis or zoonotic disease can be fatal or even cause a pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 60% of known infectious diseases originated in animals but now can be transferred from human to human (CDC, 2017) . Zoonotic diseases are not new. Historically, the great pandemic of Spanish flu is theorized to have originated in bats (Oxford et al., 2005) . More recently, swine flu and avian (bird) flu have been characterized as zoonotic conditions (Richard, DeGraaf, & Herfst, 2014) . Ebola virus is hypothesized to have originated among bats or nonhuman primates (CDC, 2019).\n\nAs I write this (in late January), the current news is replete with frenzied stories of infections that are likely to be zoonotic in nature. An article by McAlester, Cesario, and Kirkland (2020) in this issue of Nursing for Women's Health is particularly timely because of the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. At Q2 this time, the virus is said to be a zoonosis of unknown etiology but a contagion of potential major virulence. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this latest zoonotic infection. Currently, quarantines are being implemented in areas of greater incidence.

However, one cause Q3 of angst today is the risk of unknown or emerging contagious diseases to which a person can be exposed when traveling. Based on the information in the article by McAlester et al. (2020) , it is wise for all health care providers to stay abreast of updates on the latest coronavirus and to provide accurate health education to clients while acknowledging that data and guidelines are apt to change. Helping women identify and use credible sources like those from the CDC is critical.\n\nIn general, good preplanning and the ability to change travel plans as needed should be emphasized to women and families. Based on knowledge about zoonosis, areas of open markets selling live exotic animals should likely be avoided, as well as regions infested with mosquitoes should one not have an effective repellent. On the other hand, petting your poodle or cat is likely to be therapeutic to both of you. Common sense doesn't mean eliminating the joys of travel or of animal/ human interaction but, rather, just making them safer for all. NWH"}
