{"title": "", "body": "abnormal sensation and behaviors; ictus usually lasts from seconds to minutes. D. The postictal phase is characterized by abnormal behavior, disorientation, weakness, blindness, and sensory or motor dysfunction that can last from minutes to 48 hours. E. The interictal period is the time between seizures, during which the animal is clinically and neurologically normal. F. Status epilepticus is a seizure lasting >5 minutes or repeated seizures without a return to consciousness between them (Thomas, 2003) . G. Cluster seizures are defi ned as \u22652 seizures within 24 hours. VIII. Epilepsy is defi ned as recurrent seizure activity caused by a chronic brain disorder (Berendt and Gram, 1999) . A. Strictly defi ned, epilepsy does not imply an underlying cause of recurrent seizures. B. Epilepsy is commonly applied to situations in which an underlying cause is not defi ned and there may be a possible inheritance of the seizures. 1. There is a familial predisposition for idiopathic epilepsy in certain breeds of dogs. 2. In dogs, the age at onset is 1 to 5 years. 3. Often the seizures are generalized, but they can be partial. 4. Seizures occur spontaneously, often during rest or sleep. 5. Seizure frequency initially is every 4 to 6 weeks. 6. There is a tendency for frequency to increase if left untreated. C. Refractory epilepsy is frequent or severe seizure activity despite appropriate therapy.\n\nI. Epilepsy can be classifi ed based on the underlying etiology (Table 22 -1). II. Symptomatic epileptic seizures are caused by structural brain disorders. III. Reactive epileptic seizures arise from disturbances in systemic metabolism or from toxicoses (no structural brain abnormalities). IV. Cryptogenic epileptic seizures may occur from metabolic or structural brain disorders that are undetectable.\n\nSeizures and Sleep Disorders | Fredrik Gruenenfelder V. Idiopathic epileptic seizures have no recognized underlying metabolic or structural cause, and may be genetic in origin.\n\nPathophysiology I. A seizure develops from transient, paroxysmal, uncontrolled, synchronized electrical discharge of neurons (Gandini et al., 2005) . II. The activity disperses to different areas of the brain over thalamocortical pathways, intrahemispheric association or commissural pathways (Podell, 2004) . III. The cause of the excessive electrical discharge may be an increased excitability of neurons (Gandini et al., 2005) . IV. A common mechanism may involve changes in equilibrium between the main inhibitory neurotransmitter (gamma aminobutyric acid [GABA]), and the main ex-citatory neurotransmitter (glutamate), with greater concentrations of glutamate (Fenner and Hass, 1989) . V. If the epileptic focus activates a critical number of areas, a generalized seizure occurs (March, 1998) . VI. Theoretically, the more new seizure foci that are recruited, the more diffi cult the seizures are to control medically (Podell, 2004) . VII. The end of the seizure is normally caused by active inhibition (Gandini et al., 2005) . VIII. Seizures can result in various secondary intracranial consequences.\n\nA. Accumulation of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate) can lead to neurotoxicity and neuronal cell death (Fujikawa, 2005) . B. The disruption of neuronal function and integrity can lead to cerebral edema with increased intracranial Hemorrhagic or ischemic infarction Feline ischemic encephalopathy from intracranial Cuterebra spp. larval migration pressure and generalized, reduced perfusion of the brain (Podell, 2004 ., 2002) . a. Dosage is the same as in the dog.\n\nb. The half-life is 10 days, with steady-state serum concentrations being reached in 50 days (Boothe et al., 2002) . c. KBr is avoided in cats because it may increase the risk of asthma. d. Discontinued if respiratory signs or radiographic changes develop. C. Sodium bromide (NaBr; 3%) can be given IV.\n\n1. It is dissolved in sterile water (0.375 mEq Br/mL + 1.3 mEq Na/mL) 2. An IV loading dose is calculated using the following formula:\n\nSteady-state concentration (Css) \u03bc Vd = total dose administered by constant rate infusion (CRI) in a central vein A. Serum levels can be checked at any time during the day after steady state has been reached. B. If used as monotherapy, therapeutic levels in dogs are 2 to 3 mg/mL. C. If used in combination with phenobarbital, therapeutic levels in dogs are 1 to 2 mg/mL (March et al., 2002) . D. KBr can be adjusted using the following formula (Podell, 2004) : \n\nI. Narcolepsy is an abnormality in the sleep-wake cycle that manifests as excessive sleepiness and uncontrollable episodes of sleep. II. Cataplexy is a short episode of complete loss of muscle tone, usually provoked by excitement and emotion. A. Loss of muscle tone is caused by central-mediated inhibition of a-motor neurons. B. Episodes are reversible. C. Consciousness is not altered in pure cataplexy. D. Cataplexy occurs often together with narcolepsy.\n\nI. In dogs, narcolepsy can be caused by an inherited, autosomal, recessive defect of the hypocretin-receptor-2 gene (Lin et al., 1999) . II. Affected breeds include the Doberman pinscher, Labrador retriever, dachshund, and poodle. III. Narcolepsy can also result from a decreased level of hypocretin-1 protein.\n\nA. Although the cause remains unknown, an autoimmune process is suspected. B. Affected breeds include the Airedale terrier, Afghan hound, Irish setter, malamute, St. Bernard, rottweiler, English springer spaniel, Weimaraner, Welsh corgi, and giant schnauzer. IV. Infl ammatory, neoplastic, or vascular lesions involving the hypothalamus may also be causes. V. Narcolepsy is rare in cats.\n\nI. Hypocretin-1 protein and the hypocretin-receptor-2 play important roles in the sleep-wake cycle and in control of a-motor neurons in the spinal cord (Yamuy et al., 2004) . II. Neurons containing hypocretin-1 are located predominantly in the posterior hypothalamus. III. Fibers from these neurons are distributed to the locus coeruleus, nucleus raphe, and cerebral cortex. A. Binding of hypocretin-1 to the hypocretin-receptor-2 has a rousing effect and increases motor activity.\n\nB. Defi ciency in the numbers of functional hypocretinreceptor-2 leads to decreased effects of hypocretin-1 protein. C. Similarly, a defi ciency in the amount of hypocretin-1 protein also leads to diminished effects. D. The result is an abnormal sleep-wake cycle regulation, leading to excessive sleepiness and episodes of sleep. E. A loss of hypothalamic hypocretinergic control of amotor neuron leads to loss of muscle tone and cataplexy.\n\nI. Affected animals are typically <6 months; however, onset can occur in young adult animals. II. Episodes are often provoked by excitement (e.g., feeding, drinking, playing). III. Episodes consist of immediate onset of active sleep with rapid eye movement followed by a sudden return to a normal awake state (narcolepsy). IV. Generalized muscle atonia (cataplexy) may also occur. V. Affected animals often have prolonged sleep periods, as well as marked drowsiness during the day. VI. Onset and termination of the episodes are abrupt. VII. Duration of episodes ranges from seconds to 30 minutes. VIII. External stimuli can often interrupt the episode."}
