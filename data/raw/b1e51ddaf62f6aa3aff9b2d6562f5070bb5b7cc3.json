{"title": "CpG-ODNs induced changes in cytokine/chemokines genes expression associated with suppression of infectious bronchitis virus replication in chicken lungs", "body": "The nature of innate and cellular immune responses [T-helper (Th) I or Th 2] activated as a result of virus interaction with host cells play a crucial role in the outcome of a viral infection. These interactions lead to the induction of different cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial substances which regulate the process of virus replication in host cells (Estcourt et al., 1998; He et al., 2012) . It is noteworthy, that cytokines/chemokines induced by viruses may leads to activation of disproportionate inflammatory responses damaging to the host tissue and may compromise physiological functions of affected tissues. For instance, the death of infected and non-infected cells at the site of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice is attributed to an increased influx of pro-inflammatory cells and excessive induction of interleukin (IL)-6 mediated through activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathways (Banerjee et al., 2002; Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . In contrast, amplified expression of IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCLI2) cytokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-(CoV) infected cells, triggers functional modification of macrophages and dendritic cells steering to the strengthening of host innate immune responses against SARS-CoV infection (Sims et al., 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2009) . Similarly, protection in mice presensitized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein is mediated through activation of CD8 T cells leading to increased production of interferon (IFN)-\u2425 and IL-2 cytokines. In contrast, mice vaccinated with RSV G protein exhibit pulmonary eosinophilia and aggravated disease symptoms associated with enhanced IL-4 and IL-5 expression in lungs (Andrews et al., 2010; Estcourt et al., 1998; Hogan et al., 1998) . Interestingly, the RSV induced lung pathology due to production of Th-2 cytokines and accumulation of eosinophils in lungs may be suppressed with administration of recombinant IL-12 and increased IFN-\u2425 production mediated through activated CD 8 T cells (Hogan et al., 1998) . Likewise, elevated expression of IL-12 and other Th-1cytokines in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been linked with the clearance of virus from the body (Cavanaugh et al., 1997; Rossol et al., 1997) . These findings suggest that understanding of the molecular basis of immune modulation by viruses and innate immune modulators may be helpful in development of more effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against infectious diseases in humans and animals (Fearon, 2000) .\n\nCoronaviruses cause serious diseases including SARS in humans, transmissible porcine gastroenteritis in pigs, calf scour in bovine, feline infectious peritonitis in cats, mouse hepatitis in mice, and avian infectious bronchitis in birds (Tanaka et al., 2013) . Avian infectious bronchitis caused by IBV is a highly contagious respiratory disease of commercial chickens. IBV infection causes huge economic losses in terms of high morbidity (100%) and mortality (>50% with some viral strains), low egg quality and production losses in broilers, layers and breeder chickens (Banat et al., 2013) . In addition, rapid emergence of new strains, lack of cross protection amongst different serotypes and non-availability of vaccines against different variants of IBV is a matter of serious concern for the poultry industry (Jackwood et al., 2010; Lee and Jackwood, 2000) . Therefore, developments of strategies potentially effective across multiple serotypes are needed for the control of IBV and other coronavirus infections in animals and humans.\n\nIn this regard, we have recently demonstrated that in ovo administration of un-methylated deoxycytidyl-deoxyguanosine (CpG) dinucleotides (relatively common in bacterial and viral DNA) triggers the immune modulatory events that inhibit IBV replication in chicken lungs, trachea, spleen and kidney tissues (Dar et al., 2009a,b) . Data in these studies have shown the importance and clinical potential of CpG ODNs as a vaccine adjuvant or therapeutic agent against coronavirus infections in chickens. However, in these studies only N gene expression of IBV was analysed in above described organs. The aim of the present study was to investigate mechanistic details of innate immune responses activated in lungs after in ovo CpG ODN treatment followed by IBV infection in chickens. It is expected that understanding the basis of innate immune modulation of target tissues by viruses and CpG ODN will be helpful in identification of valuable targets for development of novel, safe, effective and economical control strategies against IBV infection in chickens. Moreover, CpG ODN may serve as a universal prophylactic reagent until virus specific vaccines are developed for the control of IBV infection in chickens. Additionally, the lessons learned from these studies may be instructive for the development of vaccines against coronavirus infections in humans and other animals.\n\nFor all animal experiments, specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs and synthetic CpG ODN 2007 (TCGTCGTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT) with phosphorothioate backbone (Merial Ltd. Athens, GA) were used. In ovo safety and innate immune activation potential of CpG ODN 2007 has previously been reported by us and other researchers (Dar et al., 2009b; Gomis et al., 2004 Gomis et al., , 2007 . On the 18th embryonic day (ED), the eggs were randomly divided into three equal groups (A-C). The embryos in group A were injected with 50 l CpG ODN solution in sterile PBS (1 g ODN/l) via chorioallontoic route. Embryos in group B and C were given 50 l sterile PBS (PBS, pH 7.2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) via the chorioallontoic route. In addition, in the first experiment an additional group (D) was added. Embryos in this group (groups D) were given 50 l CpG ODN solution in sterile PBS (1 g ODN/l) via the chorioallontoic route. On the 19th ED, the embryos in group A and B were infected (via chorioallontoic route) with 150 l of IBV (Ark99) solution containing 100 embryo infectious dose (EID) 50 . Embryos in group C and D were not infected with IBV. The lungs tissue samples were collected from infected and non-infected embryos and chicks at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, post infection (PI). Similarly, lungs tissues samples from group D were collected at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, post CpG inoculation. IBV replication was evaluated by a time dependent increase in IBV nucleocapsid (N) gene expression in cellular RNA extracted from infected tissues. Tissue samples were collected in TRIzol \u00ae (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), the RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted RNA was quantified and checked for quality by using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip \u00ae kit (5065-4476; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Prior to cDNA synthesis, all RNA samples were treated with DNase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C.\n\nPrimers used in these studies are shown in Table 1 , whereas, parameters for reverse transcription and realtime PCR assay were followed as previously described (Dar et al., 2009b) . Briefly, 5 g DNase treated RNA isolated from lung tissue was used as template for synthesis of cDNA. Table 1 List of primers used in these studies.\n\nSequence\n\nRandom hexamer primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used for reverse transcription of RNA. The differential mRNA expression was evaluated by using ICycler iQ and iQ SYBR \u00ae Green supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The \u2424-actin and the target genes from each sample were run in parallel on the same plate. Normalized CT value (CT value = cycle number at which the fluorescence due to amplification of target DNA reaches significantly above the background) of target genes were used to assess the change in mRNA expression. For the first normalization ( CT), the CT value of \u2424-actin gene was subtracted from the CT values of the target gene. A second normalization ( CT) was done by subtracting the mean CT value of non-infected PBS-treated tissue cells from the CT value of IBV infected tissue cells. The increase or decrease in target gene mRNA level in infected tissue cells compared with PBS treated non infected tissue cells was calculated as-fold change increase = 2 \u2212 CT (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . In each of the four experiments (experiment repeated four times), tissue samples from three embryos for each treatment at each time point were pooled to generate one sample. Each sample was run in triplicate on qPCR plate. For each target mRNA along with \u2424-actin mRNA, the DNase-treated RNA samples without conversion of RNA to cDNA and no template PCR controls were run in triplicate on the same plate. For each experiment, the mean CT value of three wells was taken as the final CT value. The data were analysed using Excel \u00ae (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and GraphPad PRISM TM 6 software (Graph-Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Final data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM of-fold changes observed in all experiments. The data were normalized by log transformation. The differences in-fold change of mRNA expression were calculated using a one way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison post tests. The results were assumed statistically significant at p < 0.05. \n\nIn order to evaluate the status of virus replication in CpG ODN pre-treated and PBS treated embryos, we analysed the expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene in embryonic lungs at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, post IBV infection. Our data showed significantly lower levels of viral N gene expression in group of embryos treated with CpG ODN prior to infection (Fig. 1) .\n\nOur data showed equal levels of IFN-\u2423 and IL-12 (P40) genes up-regulation (\u223c4 fold increase in expression at 24 h, post infection) in CpG pre-treated and non-CpG treated infected groups (group A and B). In contrast, IFN-\u2425 gene expression in embryonic lung tissue treated with CpG ODN prior to IBV infection was significantly higher (>100 fold) compared with non-CpG treated infected group at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, post infection (Fig. 2) .\n\nIL-1\u2424 and IL-18 gene expression showed no significant differences between CpG ODN treated (group A) or PBS treated (group B) IBV infected embryos ( Fig. 3A and B) . Surprisingly, IL-6 gene expression was significantly upregulated in non CpG treated infected embryos (group B) at 72 h, PI. The IL-8 gene showed significantly higher expression in group of embryos pre-treated with CpG ODN (group A) compared with PBS treated (group B) embryos at 48 h, post IBV challenge ( Fig. 3A and B) .\n\nWe analysed expression of two chemotactic cytokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u2424 and MIP-3\u2423. Out of both chemokines, the MIP-1\u2424 gene showed significantly higher expression in CpG ODN pre-treated infected embryos compared with PBS pre-treated infected embryos at 48 h, PI. However, there was no difference in MIP-3\u2423 gene expression in both (A and B) groups (Fig. 4) .\n\nIn our experiments, there was non-significant difference in OASA gene expression in CpG ODN pre-treated and PBS pre-treated infected embryos (groups A and B, respectively) for first 48 h, PI. However, at 72 h, PI, OASA gene expression in embryonic lungs from the CpG ODN pre-treated group was significantly lower than in the lungs from PBS treated embryos (Fig. 5) .\n\nThe analysis of lungs tissue collected from group D at 24 h, post CpG ODN administration showed substantial up-regulation (35 fold) of IFN-\u2425 gene expression While, moderate level of increase in IL-1(2.8 fold), IL-8 (5 fold), MIP-1\u2424 (2.8 fold) and OASA (5 fold) genes expression was observed. It is noteworthy, that 24 h, post CpG ODN administration time point is the time point when embryos in group A and B were challenged with IBV (Table 2) .\n\nThe initial interaction between viral surface proteins and the cellular receptors leads to the first wave of cytokine production (Mogensen and Paludan, 2001) whereby, cytokines exhibit their activity through formation of antiviral proteins and shaping of adaptive immunity (Samuel, 2001; Spiegel and Weber, 2006) . Alternatively, viruses have evolved various mechanisms to alter the host defence in favour of virus propagation. Interestingly, this immune evasion process is facilitated through modulation of cytokines/chemokines induction processes in host cells (Cheung et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2005; Reghunathan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004) .\n\nAmongst the cytokines, interferons are a large family of secreted proteins which are involved in innate antiviral activity, regulation of cell growth and adaptive immune response activation (Hooks et al., 2003) . Type I interferons (IFN \u2423/\u2424) are the cytokines which are produced by the majority of body cells in response to viral infections. As expected from a B class CpG ODN, the administration of CpG ODN 2007 in chicken embryos on ED18 has induced very low level of IFN \u2423 gene expression in lungs (Table 2) . However, approximately a 4 fold upregulation of IFN-\u2423 gene expression in CpG ODN treated and non CpG ODN treated embryos (groups A and B) infected with IBV was seen in our studies, suggesting that increased expression of IFN-\u2423 gene may be associated with IBV infection. These data also imply that up-regulation of IFN-\u2423 gene expression may have no implications for IBV replication in vivo (in chicken lungs). Alternatively, it may also be assumed that 4 fold up-regulation in IFN-\u2423 gene expression in vivo may not be sufficient to effect IBV replication in lung cells. It is noteworthy, that similar to our findings, non-significant up-regulation of interferon \u2423/\u2424 genes in SARS-CoV infected individuals and experimentally infected mice have been observed by other researchers (Glass et al., 2004; Reghunathan et al., 2005) . However, in vitro inhibitory effects of type I interferons on SARS-CoV replication have been reported by some researchers (Yoshikawa et al., 2010) . These findings indicate that coronavirus have evolved strategies to evade this important innate host defence in vivo. Moreover, it has been recently found that N and M proteins of SARS and other coronaviruses have an antagonistic effect on activation of IRF-3-TRAF3-STAT-IFN type I related pathways (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Narayanan et al., 2008; Spiegel et al., 2005; Tohya et al., 2009) .\n\nIFN-\u2425 is a key immune-regulatory type II interferon. IFN-\u2425 is mainly synthesized by immune cells including natural killer cells, CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in response to mitogenic and antigenic stimuli (Young and Bream, 2007; Young and Ghosh, 1997) . IFN-\u2425 mediates its antiviral activity through its multi-level cellular interactions. Binding of IFN-\u2425 to its receptors (IFN-\u2425R\u2423 and IFN-\u2425R\u2424) leads to The change in mRNA expression was compared between CpG ODN pre-treated and PBS pre-treated groups and is shown as mean \u00b1 SEM fold change in gene expression. The difference in mRNA expression was considered significant at p < 0.05 and indicated with different superscript alphabets (a and b) on the bars. (B) IL-8 (CXCLI2)and IL-18 mRNA stimulation in lungs tissue. Cytokines IL-8 (CXCLI2) and IL-18 mRNAs expression in lungs tissue following CpG ODN 2007 or PBS administration in 18 day old chicken embryos via chorioallontoic route. Embryos were infected with IBV via chorioallontoic route on embryonic day 19. The change in mRNA expression was compared between CpG ODN pre-treated and PBS pre-treated groups and is shown as mean \u00b1 SEM fold change in gene expression. The difference in mRNA expression was considered significant at p < 0.05 and indicated with different superscript alphabets (a and b) on the bars. activation of signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) and two members of Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAK-1 and JAK-2). While, activation of JAK-STAT signalling pathway is primarily involved in signal transduction and activation of immune response genes including IRF-1, IRF-9, iNOS-2 genes (Hurgin et al., 2007) . IFN-\u2425 also activates T cells, monocytes and resident cells leading to enhancement of T cells cytoxicity through granzyme B and MHC I and II induction. Various researchers have shown highly increased susceptibility to mouse hepatitis (Schijns et al., 1996) . Likewise, down regulation of cellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1 gene expression mediated through activation of IFN-\u2425 gene expression has led to increased resistance against rhinovirus infection in mice (Bianco et al., 2000; Sethi et al., 1997) . In chickens, IFN-\u2425 induction or incorporation of IFN-\u2425 as a vaccine adjuvant has shown significant antiviral activity mediated through enhanced MHC genes expression on antigen presenting cells, stimulation of antibody production, promotion of antibody isotype switching and rapid development of cytotoxic T cells (Hackney et al., 2003; Lowenthal et al., 1998a,b) . In harmony with these findings, inhibition of IBV replication and significant up-regulation of IFN-\u2425 gene expression in CpG ODN pre-treated IBV infected group in our studies suggest that CpG ODN may be considered as a potential adjuvant candidate in non-invasive vaccines against IBV infection. It is well known that severity of the SARS-CoV infection is augmented with elevated expression of inflammatory mediators including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, interferon inducible protein (IP) 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1genes (Huang et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2005; Reghunathan et al., 2005; Tseng et al., 2005; Yoshikawa et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2004) . Similar to SARS-CoV, IBV infects multiple tissue systems including lungs, kidneys and the GI tract (Cavanagh, 2003; . Major clinical signs in severe respiratory infection of IBV include mucosal thickening and accumulation of thick mucus. It is believed that similar to other respiratory viruses the induction of cytokines including IL-1\u2424, IL-6 and IL-8 in IBV infected epithelial cells contributes towards excessive mucus production (Hendley, 1998) . Based on these findings, the suppression of IL-6 gene expression in group A in our experiments may suggest an anti-inflamatory role of CpG ODN 2007 in IBV infection. However, further investigations are needed in this regards. Similarly, it is well known that IL-8 is a chemo-attractant for heterophils which are abundantly found in nasal exudates of IBV infected birds . Increased expression of IL-8 associated with inhibition of IBV replication in lungs of CpG ODN treated group is in agreement with enhanced IL-8 expression in SARS-CoV infected cells leading to functional modification of macrophages and dendritic cells and strengthening of host innate immune responses (Sims et al., 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2009) . Guo et al. (2008) and Kimura et al. (2013) have shown activation of MIP-1\u2424 and IFN signalling pathways being critical in bridging innate and adaptive immunity and induction of antiviral state in IBV and other respiratory viruses infections (Guo et al., 2008; Kimura et al., 2013) . Significant induction of MIP-1\u2424 and IFN-\u2425 genes in CpG ODN treated IBV infected group in our experiment may suggest similar antiviral role of both cytokines.\n\nActivation of 2 -5 OAS and ribonuclease (RNase) L is part of an important host antiviral pathway. Activation of RNase L is a well know function of OAS. Activated RNase L inhibits viral replication through degradation of single stranded viral or cellular RNA and blocking of protein synthesis (Silverman, 2007; Zhao et al., 2012) . High levels of OASA gene expression in CpG treated and non-CpG treated infected lungs in the first 48 h, PI suggests that activation of OAS in IBV infected cells has no effect on virus replication. It may be assumed that similar to many other viruses, IBV has evolved strategies to block OASA antiviral pathway downstream to the activation of OAS. For instance, Zhao et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2013) have reported that ns2 protein of mouse hepatitis virus (a coronavirus) has the ability to prevent RNase L activation through cleavage of 2-5 OAS proteins (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012) . Similarly, a RNA structure present in open reading frame (ORF) of viral protease gene (3C Pro ) in polio virus infection acts as a potent RNase L inhibitor and prevents viral RNA degradation by RNase L (Han et al., 2007) . Viruses including HIV-1 and encephlomyocarditis virus inhibit RNase L activity through activation of a RNase L inhibitor (RLI) protein (Martinand et al., 1998 (Martinand et al., , 1999 . Additionally, significantly reduced OASA gene expression in CpG ODN treated lungs compared to the PBS treated group at 72 h, PI may be due to lack of virus replication in CpG treated cells, whereas significantly higher expression of OASA gene in non-CpG treated infected lungs may be associated with continued IBV replication.\n\nIn conclusion, our data demonstrate a significant role of differential up-regulation of IFN-\u2425, IL-8 and MIP-1\u2424 genes and suppression of IL-6 gene expression in inhibition of IBV replication in chicken lungs. Further characterization of these marker gens will be helpful in improvement of theraputic and prophylactic reagents for the control of coronavirus infection."}
