ABC also helps in reducing dose to other 3 organs at risk, including lungs and liver 2 . However, in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are 4 concerns regarding the safety of using such devices with risks of transmission amongst multiple 5 patients, especially since the virus has a relatively high transmission rate and increased risk for 6 fatality for elderly patients 3 . This issue is particularly poignant to cancer patients who may be 7\n\nimmunocompromised and are at increased risk of invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or death (39% 8 vs 8%) with COVID-19 4 . In addition, alternatives to ABC, such as prone positioning, may provide 9 comparable benefits to ABC without placing LBC patients in situations at risk for direct exposure 10 from shared respiratory devices. 11\n\nAt our institution, we utilize Active Breathing Coordinator\u2122 (Elekta; Stockholm, Sweden) for our LBC 12\n\npatients. We previously published the results from a prospective trial using this device in which we 13 demonstrated a median reduction in mean heart dose (MHD) of 1.7 Gy with a 8-year locoregional 14 relapse rate of 7 percent 5 . Additionally, a systematic review of ten studies showed similar results with 15 DIBH, including a reduction of MHD up to 3.4 Gy, translating to a 13.6 percent decrease in risk of 16 heart disease 6 . This includes reduction of dose to the left anterior descending artery, with mean dose 17 reduced by nearly half and coronary events at 10 years down to 2.55 percent from 4.03 percent 7 . 18\n\nRespiratory droplets are one of the main methods of transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus 8 . These can 19\n\nbe generated through coughing, sneezing, mouth and nose breathing, and talking. The size and the 20 number of droplets can vary based on the expiratory activity, the region of origin in the respiratory 21 tract, and the type of pathogen 9 . SARS-CoV-2 particles have had reported diameters ranging from 22\n\n0.06 to 0.14 microns 10 . SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosols can remain viable for up to 3 hours 23\n\nand up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel surfaces 11 . Aerosol models in healthy humans have 24 measured droplets from coughing as small as 0.1 microns, with the vast majority (97 percent) of 25 droplets as submicron in size 12 . Viral aerosols, such as those generated by influenza, tend to skew 26 towards this submicron size distribution 13 . 27\n\nThe Active Breathing Coordinator\u2122 utilizes a mouthpiece and filter kit which are designed for single 28 patient use. The ViroMax\u00ae viral/bacterial filter is constructed of a Styrene-Acrylonitrile Copolymer 29\n\nwhich supports the filter media constructed from a blend of modacrylic and polypropylene fibers. 30\n\nThis has been tested and certified to >99.99% viral and >99.999% bacterial efficiency (FDA GMP, 31\n\nISO 13485:2016, FDA 510(k) clearance K063526). The filter has been tested to 0.1 micron size 32 particles which should technically provide adequate protection from transmission. Since the SARS-33\n\nCoV-2 virus may be as small as 0.06 microns, however, we have elected in our clinic to decide 34 whether or not to use ABC on a case-by-case basis due to these concerns. 35\n\nAs an extra precaution during this time of the pandemic, providers can consider alternatives to ABC. patients, however, including for those needing regional nodal irradiation, very medial or lateral 43 lumpectomy cavities, and for situations where anterior displacement of the heart towards the chest 44 wall may not lead to effective cardiac sparing 17 . Therefore, one can consider simulating patients in 45\n\nboth prone and supine positions and selecting a treatment plan that is most suitable for the patient. 46 1 field and IMRT 18 . 2\n\nIn summary, the COVID-19 pandemic gives radiation oncologists an opportunity to evaluate our 3 standard practices and create institutional guidelines taking into account: 1) the size of SARS-CoV-2 4 virus and 2) the type of device used for respiratory gating, in order to determine the risk-benefit ratio 5 acceptable for our patients during this time. Alternatives to ABC, including voluntary DIBH, prone 6 positioning, and optimizing treatment planning should also be considered to mitigate risk between 7\n\npatients. 8\n\nto the heart and preserves local control in patients with left breast cancer: Report of a prospective trial "}
