{"title": "Irreversible inactivation of ISG15 by a viral leader protease enables alternative infection detection strategies", "body": "We used ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like model substrates (17) to characterize Lbpro DUB activity in vitro (Fig. S1A) and surprisingly found that while the enzyme lacked robust DUB activity, it targeted ISG15 with high activity and specificity (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin cleavage required 1,000-fold higher enzyme concentration (Fig. S1B). Kinetic analysis revealed deISGylase activity comparable with previously studied viral (18, 19) and human enzymes (20) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1C). However, a number of standard measurements for deISGylation activity were negative. ISG15-derived suicide probes that covalently modify ISG15-reactive Cys proteases (21, 22) were unable to modify Lbpro (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1D). Hydrolysis of ISG15 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) by deISGylases, such as the viral ovarian tumor (vOTU) domain of CCHFV, leads to fluorescence, yet Lbpro did not generate a fluorescent signal in this assay (Fig. S1 E and F). In contrast, slightly extended precursor forms of full-length proISG15 (amino acids 1\u2013165; featuring an additional eight residues at the C terminus) or proISG15CTD (amino acids 79\u2013165) were rapidly hydrolyzed by Lbpro (Fig. 1D). Strikingly, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of Lbpro-treated mature ISG15CTD (amino acids 79\u2013157) revealed a truncated ISG15 molecule; Lbpro had cleaved ISG15 between Arg155 and the C-terminal Gly156\u2013Gly157 sequence (Fig. 1 E and F).\n\nThis surprising result was corroborated in additional experiments. We compared the cleavage rates of pro-, mature-, and substrate-bound forms of ISG15 by intact MS analysis, revealing similar activity of Lbpro against pro- and mature ISG15 and slightly higher activity toward ISG15 linked to 5-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled Lys-Gly dipeptide via an isopeptide bond (Fig. S1G). This showed that Lbpro can process all forms of ISG15 present in cells.\n\nThe cleavage site of Lbpro contrasts all known deISGylases, which cleave ISG15 from substrates, such that both proteins are recycled to the same state as they were before modification (18, 19). In hindsight, these findings explain the inability of Lbpro to react with the ISG15 suicide probe (in which the reactive warhead would extend beyond the active site) or generate a signal in the ISG15-AMC assay. AMC only fluoresces in the unmodified form, whereas Lbpro cleavage produces a nonfluorescent GlyGly-modified AMC reagent (Fig. S2A).\n\nAt higher enzyme concentrations, ubiquitin and NEDD8 were also cleaved at an identical site between Arg74 and the C-terminal GlyGly motif, whereas SUMO1 was not cleaved (Fig. S2 B\u2013D). Hence, Lbpro removes ISG15 (as well as ubiquitin and NEDD8) in a manner that leaves a GlyGly remnant attached to a substrate Lys residue and renders the ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like protein incompetent toward additional rounds of conjugation.\n\nTo decipher the mechanism of this unprecedented activity, we designed an ISG15 suicide probe specific for Lbpro. As mentioned, the WT ISG15 suicide probe modified several viral proteases but was too long to modify Lbpro (Fig. S2E). Removing the GlyGly motif from ISG15CTD and replacing Arg155 with a Gly-like C-terminal propargyl warhead (Fig. 2A) generated an ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe that efficiently modified Lbpro (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2E). This enabled purification, crystallization, and structure determination of a covalent Lbpro\u223cISG15CTD-\u0394C complex at 1.5-\u00c5 resolution (Fig. 2 C and D, Fig. S3, and Table S1). As anticipated, the ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe had covalently modified the catalytic Cys51 of Lbpro (Fig. S3). Individually, the Lbpro protease and ISG15 domains were similar to previously determined structures (18, 23) (C\u03b1 rmsds of 0.609 and 0.274 \u00c5, respectively).\n\nThe structure revealed how proteolytic cleavage of ISG15 is achieved (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3). Key interactions are formed via the ISG15 C terminus and also, via a hydrophobic surface centered on ISG15 Trp123 (Fig. S3). The positively charged residues of the ISG15 C terminus, Arg153 and Arg155 (the latter mutated to Gly in the ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe), are cradled by an acidic groove that consists of Asp49, Glu96, and Glu147 on Lbpro (Fig. S3G). Furthermore, ISG15 Leu154 occupies a hydrophobic pocket commonly found in papain-like enzymes. Mutation of either Leu154 or Arg155 to Ala in proISG15 strongly reduced cleavage by Lbpro (Fig. S3H). However, these C-terminal mutations do not prevent ISG15 binding, since the ISG15CTD-\u2206C suicide probe that lacks Arg155 was able to modify Lbpro (Fig. 2 B and C). The importance of the C terminus explains, at least in part, the observed weak cross-reactivity with ubiquitin and NEDD8, which feature identical or similar C-terminal sequences, respectively, and also, the inability of Lbpro to target other modifiers, such as SUMO1, which feature more divergent C-terminal sequences (24) (Fig. S3F). The observed interactions closely mimic those seen in the previously determined structure of Lbpro carrying out self-processing of its own C terminus (23) (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3F).\n\nAnother interaction site between ISG15 and Lbpro centers on the conserved Trp123 of ISG15 (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4A), the main hydrophobic ISG15 surface used in other deISGylases (Fig. S4B) (18, 19, 22, 25). Lbpro utilizes a corresponding hydrophobic ISG15 binding surface formed by Leu92, Pro99 in the \u03b13/\u03b14 loop, and residues, including Leu102 on the \u03b14 helix to shape the overall structure of the binding site (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C); mutations in these residues decrease Lbpro activity toward ISG15 (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4C). Importantly, this loop is not involved in interactions used during self-processing (Fig. 2E), and consequently and consistently, mutants in the ISG15 binding site are neither affected in their ability to self-process nor affected in their ability to cleave eIF4G (Fig. S5). Hence, substrate and ISG15 binding sites are spatially separated.\n\nIn ISG15, mutation of Trp123 to Ala leads to a significant reduction of cleavage by Lbpro (Fig. 3C). Trp123 is also a major difference between ISG15 and ubiquitin, where the structurally equivalent residue is Arg42 (Fig. 3D). Mutation of ubiquitin Arg42 to Trp in the context of an Met1-linked ubiquitin chain significantly reduced cleavage of this chain type by the Met1 linkage-specific DUB OTULIN (26) (Fig. S4D) but enhanced ubiquitin chain cleavage by Lbpro (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4E). This reveals one component of how Lbpro distinguishes modifiers.\n\nGiven the high level of Lbpro activity against ISG15 in vitro (Fig. 1 A and B), we were curious whether this activity and noncanonical cleavage were detectable in a biological context. Transfection of FLAG-tagged ISG15 and the ISG15 assembly machinery (UBE1L, UBE2L6, and HERC5) led to robust ISGylation in HeLa cells. Treatment of these cell lysates with Lbpro collapsed the ISGylated proteins, while free ISG15 remained seemingly unchanged (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6C). Serendipitously, we observed that ISG15 cross-reacted with a polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody (Fig. S6 A and B). Treatment with Lbpro specifically removed this cross-reaction, indicating that a fraction of the polyclonal antibody detects an epitope spanning the identical C terminus of both modifiers (Fig. S6 A and B). Antibody cross-reactivity provided us with a tool to monitor ISG15 cleavage by Lbpro in cell extracts. Indeed, when transfection cell lysates were probed with the polyclonal antiubiquitin antibody, the ISG15 cross-reactive band was no longer detected after Lbpro treatment, indicating that Lbpro had hydrolyzed the ISG15 C terminus (Fig. 4A, red box). The antiubiquitin blot also showed that ubiquitin modifications in Lbpro-treated samples were only partially processed, confirming ISG15 preference in complex samples (Fig. 4A). This was in stark contrast to the CCHFV vOTU domain, which cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 similarly (18, 19) and collapsed both types of signals to the same extent (Fig. 4A).\n\nTo further visualize Lbpro activity, we exploited a previously developed antibody that recognizes GlyGly-modified Lys residues (27, 28). This anti-GlyGly antibody has so far only been used to enrich ubiquitinated tryptic peptides in MS applications (27, 28). Rewardingly, probing these same reactions with the anti-GlyGly antibody produced a smear of strong signals across a wide range of molecular weights in the Lbpro-treated sample (Fig. 4A). These signals correspond to the Lbpro-produced GlyGly-modified proteome.\n\nTo assess the impact of Lbpro activity during viral infection, we first exploited a chimera viral infection model (29). A mengovirus (a strain of encephalomyocarditis, a picornavirus that is closely related to FMDV) system was engineered, in which the Leader protein was inactivated by mutations and functionally replaced by WT Lbpro or catalytically inactive Lbpro Cys51Ala as a leader protease. We monitored Lbpro activity in a time course with anti-ISG15, antiubiquitin, and anti-GlyGly antibodies (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6D). With inactive Lbpro, ISG15 modifications were visibly increased 6\u20138 h postinfection, whereas no visible changes to total ubiquitin and no signal in the anti-GlyGly Western blot were apparent. In contrast, mengovirus with active Lbpro resulted in a decrease in ISG15 signals, a slight decrease in ubiquitin signals, and importantly, the appearance of GlyGly-modified proteins at 6 and especially, 8 h postinfection (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6D). This indicates that, indeed, production of active Lbpro by the virus leads to incomplete hydrolysis of ISG15 and ubiquitin from substrates, which can be visualized using available ubiquitin proteomics antibodies.\n\nImportantly, Lbpro activity can also be visualized during FMDV infection [e.g., using baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ISG15 and the ISG15 conjugation system]. Before infection, transfection leads to robust FLAG signals, whereas anti-GlyGly signals are absent. FMDV infection induces collapsing of FLAG signals coinciding with the appearance of GlyGly-modified proteins. Within 4 h of FMDV infection, the anti-GlyGly antibody labels hundreds of proteins across a broad molecular weight range (Fig. 4C). We are not aware of a similar host cell-derived viral-induced epitope that is detectable with such relative ease. Importantly, this epitope originates from host proteins and cannot acquire mutations due to viral evolution.\n\nLbpro is a prime example of a viral protein that contributes to successful viral replication through multifunctional roles. In addition to previously known crucial activities during replication (4, 6), we now show how it also hinders antiviral signaling through removal of ISG15 and to a lesser extent, ubiquitin from proteins (Fig. 5). Importantly, its mechanism of incomplete cleavage irreversibly damages the modifiers, which can no longer be attached to proteins. This mechanism is conceptually similar to the activity of RavZ, a Legionella effector that hydrolyzes the C terminus of Atg8 ubiquitin-like modifiers involved in autophagy (30). Moreover, on the substrate side, Lbpro activity precludes remodification of Lys residues, and their small GlyGly modification(s) may not alter protein function significantly (Fig. 5). The slight cross-reactivity with ubiquitin is likely important, since ubiquitin modifications are much more abundant, and it is hence difficult to delineate the origin of the observed GlyGly signatures. Nonetheless, these multifaceted traits highlight the importance of Lbpro as a potent virulence factor (31). It is possible that other viruses and pathogens may use this elegant antiinflammatory strategy. While the leader proteases of other picornaviridae are highly divergent on the sequence level, the highly related apthovirus equine rhinitis A virus may also encode an enzyme that generates GlyGly epitopes, which could be tested using GlyGly epitope detection in infected samples.\n\nThe here identified virus-induced GlyGly remnants on substrate proteins may lead to improvements in the detection of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Vaccination is critical to the control FMD outbreaks; however, it is difficult to distinguish vaccinated from infected animals. Current strategies rely on ELISA-based methods to detect antibodies against nonstructural virus proteins in serum. Our findings suggest that GlyGly-modified proteins could also be used in ELISAs to detect antibodies against this epitope. Detection of antibodies against GlyGly modifications signifies enzymatic activity of Lbpro that would only be observed after viral infection and hence, distinguish infected from vaccinated animals. This utility of detecting FMDV infection may ease the economic burden imposed by FMD, particularly in developing countries, by providing a previously unrecognized biomarker for its detection.\n\nISG15 and Met1 diubiquitin were cloned into an His-tagged expression vector (32). The Lbpro vector (23) was expressed and purified according to ref. 33. For the ISG15CTD-\u2206C probe, ISG15 (amino acids 79\u2013154) was cloned in frame into the intein/chitin binding domain pTXB1 vector. ISG15-intein was expressed and purified according to refs. 17 and 34. SI Methods has expression and purifications procedures for His-tagged ISG15 and Met1 diubiquitin.\n\nISG15-AMC assays were performed as described previously (18). Ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like TAMRA assays were performed according to ref. 35. ISG15-TAMRA reagent was used to determine Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics (additional details are in SI Methods). Cleavage assays of pro-ISG15CTD and mature ISG15CTD were performed under the same conditions as the TAMRA assays. ISG15 probe assays were also performed under these conditions. SI Methods has condition details. MS analysis was performed according to ref. 36.\n\nThe Lbpro\u223cISG15CTD-\u0394C complex was purified by anion chromatography (Resource Q) and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol. After dialysis, the complex was concentrated to 4 mg/mL and set up at a 1:1 protein:precipitant ratio in a sitting drop vapor diffusion format. Crystals grew in 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Na citrate, pH 5.6, and 0.2 M K/Na tartrate and were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol. Crystallographic data were collected at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron (Table S1).\n\nAdditional descriptions of the methods are listed in SI Methods."}
