{"title": "Cell Surface Human Airway Trypsin-Like Protease Is Lost During Squamous Cell Carcinogenesis HHS Public Access", "body": "During the last two decades, cell surface proteases belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, have emerged as enzymes with important functions in epithelial biology and pathology, including cancer (Hobson et al., 2004; Bugge, 2008, 2011; Bugge et al., 2009; List, 2009; Antalis et al., 2010) .\n\nThe human TTSP family encompasses 17 known members in humans that all contain an Nterminal transmembrane domain, a C-terminal extracellular serine protease domain and a \"stem region\" that contain various types, combinations, and numbers of conserved domains. Human Airway Trypsin-like protease (HAT) has the simplest domain configuration, where the stem region contains a single sea urchin sperm protein, enteropeptidase, agrin (SEA) domain . HAT belongs to the HAT/DESC subfamily of TTSPs that comprises HAT (encoded by TMPRSS11D), DESC1 (encoded by TMPRSS11E), HAT-like 4 (encoded by TMPRSS11F), HAT-like 5 (encoded by TMPRSS11B), and TMPRSS11A (encoded by TMPRSS11A) . Human HAT protein was first isolated in 1997 from the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases and cloned the following year from human trachea cDNA (Yasuoka et al., 1997; Yamaoka et al., 1998) . HAT is highly expressed in respiratory epithelium, where the protein localizes to the suprabasal layer of bronchial epithelium, as well as the basal region of their associated cilia. It has been proposed that HAT plays a role in mucus production (Takahashi et al., 2001; Chokki et al., 2004) . In addition, it has been demonstrated that HAT supports proteolytic activation of influenza A and B viruses and the SARS coronavirus in vitro. Therefore, HAT may play a role in activation and spread of different respiratory viruses in the human airways (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2010 Nygaard et al., 2011; Bertram et al., 2011; Baron et al., 2012) . The expression of HAT transcript has been identified in several additional tissues including tongue, skin, esophagus, and cervix (Sales et al., 2011) . While there has been an extensive body of literature documenting causal roles of TTSP members in carcinogenesis, including hepsin, and matriptase (List, 2009; Antalis et al., 2010; Szabo and Bugge, 2011) , HAT is one of the few family members that remains uncharacterized in cancer.\n\nIn this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of HAT in cervical and esophageal tissues, and found that HAT was mainly localized on the surface of differentiated epithelial cells in healthy stratified squamous epithelia. In contrast, expression of the cellsurface protease is significantly diminished, and in many cases, undetectable in late stages of squamous cell carcinoma carcinogenesis.\n\nThe Oncomine microarray database (http://www.oncomine.org) (Rhodes et al., 2004) was used to perform a meta-analysis of the expression of human TMPRSS11d (gene encoding\n\nThe use of human tissue paraffin arrays was approved according to the institutional guidelines by the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board Administration (#2013-43).\n\nHuman embryonic kidney cells, HEK293T, and human cervical carcinoma cells, HeLa (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA). Full-length human HAT cDNA in pCAGGS was generously provided by Dr. Eva Friebertshaeuser, Philipps University Marburg. The generation of human full-length HATL-5 cDNA in pcDNA 3.1/V5-His TOPO \u00ae TA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in frame with a C-terminal HIS-tag and V-5 epitope has previously been described (Miller et al., 2014) . A control vector, pcDNA 3.1-GFP, was used to assess transfection efficiency and as a negative control for western blotting. Transfection of cells was performed using Lipofectamine LTX according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Transfections were performed with 2.5 \u03bcg plasmid DNA.\n\nCells were lysed using RIPA buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/ HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000g at 4\u00b0C. For collection of conditioned media cells were serum starved overnight. Protein concentrations in whole cell lysates were determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% Tris-glycine gels under non-reducing or reducing conditions, transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) and analyzed using rabbit anti human TMPRSS11d (HAT Ab1) (ab127031, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti human TMPRSS11d (HAT Ab2) (HPA052834 Sigma) or mouse anti V5 antibody (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). For detection, secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used in combination with ECL Western Blotting Substrate or Super-Signal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL).\n\nCervical (CR802) and esophageal (ES482) tissue arrays including cancer and normal tissues as well as a universal normal tissue array (UNC241) were obtained from US Biomax, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Tissue arrays were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated with graded ethanol solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer, reduced pH, and endogenous peroxidases were quenched by incubating slides in 3% H 2 O 2 . The arrays were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 2 \u03bcg/ml rabbit anti human TMPRSS11d (HAT Ab1) (ab127031, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or rabbit anti human TMPRSS11d (HAT Ab2) (HPA052834, Sigma) in a humidity chamber. All washing steps were performed using PBS. As a negative control, non-immune rabbit IgG (2 \u03bcg/ml) (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) was used. Bound antibodies were visualized using biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) secondary antibodies, and a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or HRP conjugated Polymer Anti-Rabbit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the substrate (Sigma) and arrays were counterstained with hematoxylin. All microscopic images were acquired on a Zeiss Scope A.1 using digital imaging.\n\nAssessment of staining intensities of esophageal and cervical tissue samples was performed by manual assessment. Scores were assigned on the basis of the intensity and extent of epithelial staining in 20\u00d7 microscopic fields using an arbitrary scale from 0 to 4 where: 0 = no epithelial cells stained; 1 = many epithelial cells stained weakly OR a few stained moderately with the majority unstained; 2 = the majority of epithelial cells stained weakly OR many epithelial cells stained moderately OR few epithelial cells stained strongly with the majority stained weakly or not at all; 3 = many epithelial cells stained strongly OR the majority stained moderately; and 4 = the majority of epithelial cells stained strongly. Statistical significance of the difference in HAT staining intensity between groups was determined by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test.\n\nTo minimize the risk of non-specific staining in immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of tissue sections, we used two independent antibodies raised against different domains of the HAT protein. As illustrated in Figure 1A , the Ab1 antibody was raised against the serine protease (SP) domain, whereas the Ab2 antibody was raised against the stem region containing the SEA domain. The specificity of the two antibodies was tested in HEK293T and HeLa cells transfected with full-length human HAT cDNA. Western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed a single band at the predicted molecular weight (46 kDa) (Yamaoka et al., 1998) TTSP's are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are activated by cleavage at a conserved activation site motif (predicted to be between Arg 186 -Ile 187 in HAT, indicated with an arrow in Fig. 1A ). Upon activation, the catalytic domain remains tethered via a disulfide bond to the stem region of the protease. Therefore, the cleaved, active SP-domain can be visualized by SDS-PAGE and western blotting under reducing conditions using Ab1. As displayed in Figure 1C , the full-length form of HAT was detected in addition to a ~27 kDa form corresponding to the HAT SP-domain (Yasuoka et al., 1997) which was visible in both HEK293T and HeLa cells (left panels). Again, no cross-reactivity with HATL5 was detected. The V5 antibody readily detected HATL5 protein as expected (right panel). In conditioned media from HeLa cells (Fig. 1D ) and HEK293T cells (not shown), HAT was only detected as the 27 kDa form indicating that the majority of shed HAT is present in its active form.\n\nThe TTSPs matriptase and TMPRSS13 play critical roles in terminal differentiation of squamous epithelia leading to the establishment of a functional barrier in the epidermis and oral cavity (List et al., 2002 (List et al., , 2003 Madsen et al., 2014) . Interestingly, HAT mRNA is also expressed in several tissues containing squamous epithelia including skin, oral cavity, cervix, and esophagus (Sales et al., 2011) . This prompted us to examine the distribution and cellular localization of HAT protein in squamous epithelia by IHC. The two independent anti-HAT rabbit antibodies raised against different HAT peptide antigens (Ab1 and Ab2) verified above were used to minimize the risk of non-specific staining. Using serial sections, slides were probed with primary antibodies or used as negative controls where the primary antibody was substituted with non-immune rabbit IgG (Fig. 2D , G and data not shown). Representative sections of normal esophageal and cervical mucosa are shown in Figure 2 . Careful inspection of staining patterns on serial sections revealed that the two anti-HAT antibodies displayed very similar staining pattern of the tissues examined ( Fig. 2A, B, E, F) . In both the cervix and the esophagus, a strong epithelial staining was detected in the apical squamous cells with no significant staining in the submucosal or mesenchymal compartments. HAT protein is primarily localized on the cell surface of the larger squamous cells (Fig. 2C ) and no nuclear staining was observed. This cell surface localization is in agreement with the expected distribution of the predicted membrane anchored topology of HAT. No significant staining was detected in the basal layer. The basal layers harbor the highly mitotic cells in in squamous epithelia (Huang et al., 2005; Looi et al., 2008) . Sections from liver (Fig. 2H , I), thyroid (Fig. 2J ) and brain (Fig. 2K ), which have previously been shown to express no detectable HAT message by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Yamaoka et al., 1998; Sales et al., 2011) , were included as negative controls. The insert in Fig. 2K demonstrates HAT staining in bronchial epithelium as previously reported (Bertram et al., 2011) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that endogenous HAT protein displays a pericellular localization in differentiating epithelial cells in stratified squamous epithelia.\n\nPrior research has demonstrated the important roles of cell surface serine proteases in carcinogenesis. We first explored potential differential expression of HAT in normal and carcinomatous tissue by in silico data mining, using the Oncomine \u2122 microarray database. Data analysis revealed a significant decrease in the overall level of HAT transcript in a metaanalysis of gene expression arrays studies of carcinomas from the cervix and esophagus as compared to corresponding normal tissues (Fig. 3A , B, Table S1 ). In order to gather a better understanding of the extent and localization of HAT protein expression in normal and cancerous tissue, we performed IHC using human tissue arrays composed of samples that varied in degree of pathogenicity from normal to poorly differentiated (Grade III) squamous cell carcinoma. Characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma progression include the presence of small and abnormally shaped cells with a loss of squamous appearance and a distinguishable basal membrane. Normal esophageal and cervical HAT protein expression was compared to squamous cell carcinoma of increasing grades using IHC analysis.\n\nCervical tissue arrays containing 21 normal cervical squamous epithelia samples and 28 cervical carcinoma samples with grades ranging from I to III (Grade I; n = 4, Grade II; n = 16, Grade III; n = 19) were incubated with the two different rabbit anti-HAT antibodies (Fig.  3C-F) , and non-immune rabbit IgG as a negative control (not shown). Staining intensity was scored on a scale from 0 to 4 (Fig. 4A ). Low-grade carcinomas (Grade I) showed moderate HAT membrane staining and weak cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3C, D, L) , whereas mediumgrade carcinomas (Grade II), showed dispersed cytoplasmic expression with little or no cell surface staining (Fig. 3E, M) . In poorly differentiated cervical carcinoma (Grade III), expression of HAT protease was largely absent, demonstrated by exceedingly weak or altogether absent cellular membrane and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3F) . None of the samples displayed nuclear staining. In control samples where HAT antibody was replaced with non-immune rabbit IgG, staining could not be detected. Statistical analysis and comparison revealed a significant decrease in staining intensity in each of the two groups of cancer tissues Grade I-II (P <0.003), and Grade III (0.00001), respectively, when compared to normal tissue (Fig. 4A ).\n\nEvaluation of differential expression of HAT in esophageal carcinoma was completed using normal and cancerous tissue samples with grades ranging from I to III (normal; n = 6, Grade I; n = 6, Grade II; n = 13, Grade III; n = 6). The esophageal tissue arrays were incubated with two different anti-HAT rabbit antibodies as described above (Fig. 3G , I, J, K and data not shown) and non-immune rabbit IgG as a negative control (Fig. 3H) . In terms of HAT expression, well-differentiated, low-grade carcinomas (Grade I) showed moderately intense and dispersed cytoplasmic staining, while moderately differentiated carcinoma (Grade II) showed weak cytoplasmic dispersed expression with no visible cell surface staining. Three grade II tumors displayed no visible staining. In poorly differentiated carcinoma (Grade III), HAT expression was absent in two of the six samples, whereas the rest displayed faint to moderate HAT expression (Fig. 4B) . Esophageal tissue arrays, incubated with non-immune rabbit IgG instead of HAT rabbit antibody, displayed no observable staining on the cell membranes, cytoplasm, or nucleus (Fig. 3M) . Statistical analysis and comparison showed a significant decrease in staining intensity in Grade I (P <0.02), Grade II (P <0.02), and Grade III (P <0.01) carcinomas in comparison to normal tissue (Fig. 4B ).\n\nAs part of an ongoing effort to determine the expression and function of the TTSP family in cancer, we performed expression analysis of HAT in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia and in corresponding epithelia during squamous cell carcinogenesis. The specificity of the two HAT antibodies used in this study was verified by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression in human tissue arrays showed that the protease was consistently expressed in the suprabasal and apical layers harboring the most differentiated epithelial cells in healthy epithelia. The staining pattern in normal esophagus was consistent with that observed by Uhl\u00e9n et al. (2015) . Furthermore, HAT was mostly confined to the surface membrane of epithelial cells, consistent with the predicted localization of the type II transmembrane serine protease. Importantly, in squamous cell carcinomas of the same tissues, a significantly decreased expression and, in many cases, a complete loss of HAT was observed in advanced cancer. The localization of HAT protein in normal stratified squamous epithelia and the subsequent loss of the protease during carcinogenesis provide valuable information regarding the function of the protease in normal epithelial biology and carcinogenesis. In stratified squamous epithelia, a balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and death must be carefully regulated in order to maintain their function. The stratified squamous epithelium acts as an effective barrier between the outside environments contaminants, including toxins and pathogens. The cells of these epithelia replicate frequently to replace damaged or dead cells. The proliferating epithelial cells reside in the basal layer and cells continuously pass through a complex differentiation program to generate basolateral and apical cells that are finally sloughed off (desquamation) at the surface of the epithelium. It has been demonstrated that extracellular proteases are involved in the acquisition of functional stratified squamous epithelia. Thus, the TTSPs, matriptase and TMPRSS13, are critical for terminal differentiation and proper function in the epidermis and oral epithelium (List et al., 2002 (List et al., , 2003 Madsen et al., 2014) . Considering the finding that HAT is expressed in the non-proliferating suprabasal/apical layers combined with the observation that HAT is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells in high grade tumors, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis, an interesting question to explore further is whether the observed link between loss of HAT protein and squamous cell carcinoma progression is correlational or causal. A recent study demonstrated that HAT deficient mice did not display any overt phenotypes in the absence of external challenges or additional genetic deficits (Sales et al., 2011) . However, it remains to be experimentally tested whether these mice have an altered susceptibility if subjected to e.g. chemical genotoxic stress or transgenic oncogene expression. Currently, the candidate endogenous mammalian proteolytic substrates identified for HAT include the urokinase receptor (uPAR), and the protease activated receptor (PAR) 2 (Iwakiri et al., 2004; Chokki et al., 2005; Matsushima et al., 2006; Beaufort et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013) . In addition, HAT has fibrinolytic activity and it has been hypothesized that HAT may participate in fibrinolysis within the airway mucous membranes, by cleaving fibrinogen transported from the blood stream (Yoshinaga et al., 1998) . Interestingly, two other HAT/ DESC subfamily members, DESC1 and HATL5 display similar expression patterns in normal stratified squamous epithelium and a gradual loss during carcinogenesis. Thus, DESC1 expression correlates with normal keratinocyte differentiation and inversely with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression (Lang and Schuller, 2001; Sedghizadeh et al., 2006) . We have previously shown that HATL5 is significantly decreased in cervical, esophageal, and head and neck carcinomas as compared to normal tissue (Miller et al., 2014 ). An important finding in this connection is that cellular HAT is present in both its zymogen form and in its cleaved and active form and that shed HAT is present mainly in its active form upon transfection of full-length HAT cDNA in mammalian cells. Interestingly, the active forms of DESC1 or HATL5 were not detected in similar experiments (Hobson et al., 2004 , Miller et al., 2014 . Therefore it can be speculated that HAT acts as an activator and initiator of a proteolytic cascade during terminal differentiation of squamous epithelia similar to the proteolytic cascade of tissue kallikreins in the stratum corneum of the epidermis (Brattsand et al., 2005) .\n\nIn summary, our current study represents a comprehensive expression characterization of HAT in healthy and cancerous tissues, and is a first step towards deciphering the potential functions of this protease in squamous cell carcinoma progression.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
