Therefore, the dissociation constants for these two binding pairs were determined as \uff1e400 \u03bcM based on the kinetic data. Figure S3 . A side-by-side comparison of the HKU4-and MERS-RBD structure, Related to Figure 1 . The secondary-structure elements are labeled. In comparison to MERS-RBD (magenta for the core subdomain and green for the external subdomain), HKU4-RBD (orange for the core subdomain and cyan for the external subdomain) lacks an \u03b1-helix (\u03b11) and two small strands (\u03b22 and \u03b211) in the core subdomain, and is devoid of a 3 10 helix (\u03b74) in the external subdomain. In addition, the helix preceding strand \u03b23 exhibits characteristics of a 3 10 helix (\u03b7') in HKU4-RBD, rather than being \u03b1-helical (\u03b13) as in MERS-RBD. These elements are highlighted by marking with arrows. from the data and the model, respectively. R free is the R factor for a subset (5%) of reflections that was selected prior to refinement calculations and was not included in the refinement. d Ramachandran plots were generated by using the program PROCHECK. The van der Waal (vdw) contacts and H-bond interactions at the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 interface were characterized. The HKU4-RBD residues locating within a 4.5-\u00c5 distance from the receptor were selected and listed in column 1. The number of inter-molecule contacts contributed by, the side-chain and/or main-chain H-bonds observed for and the location of each interface residues were listed in columns 2-4, respectively. \"-\" indicates that no H-bond was observed, and the number of H-bonds contributed by the indicated residues were presented in parentheses. Residues K506 and E541, which afford both side-chain H-bond interactions and multi-vdw contacts, are highlighted.\n\nThe constructs used for protein expression and purification were individually cloned by insertion of the coding sequences for HKU4-RBD (S residues E372-Y611, \n\nThe proteins used for crystallization and SPR experiments were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac \n\nThe monomer of HKU4-RBD was mixed with hCD26 at a 1:1 stoichiometry, and crystallization trials were performed by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 4\u00baC .\n\nDiffractable crystals of the complex were finally obtained in a condition consisting of 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.5 and 15% PEG 6000 with a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. Crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) BL17U and processed with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) .\n\nThe complex structure was solved by the molecular replacement module of PHASER (Read, 2001) from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) , with the previously reported complex structure of MERS-RBD/hCD26 (PDB code: 4KR0) as the search model. Restrained rigid-body refinement with REFMAC5 (CCP4 suite) and manual model building with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) were then performed. Further rounds of refinement were then done with Phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010) . During model building and refinement, the program of PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) was used to monitor the stereochemistry of the structure. The data collection and structure refinement statistics were summarized in Table 1 . The structural figures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).\n\nThe secondary structure elements were determined using the ESPript (Gouet et al., 1999) algorithm.\n\nThe BiAcore\uf0d2 experiments were carried out at 25\u00baC using a BIAcore\uf0d2 3000 machine with CM5 chips (GE Healthcare). All proteins used in the experiment were exchanged \n\nHuman hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7 was used for the binding test. Huh7 cells were suspended in PBS and incubated with individual mouse Fc-fusion proteins or a goat anti-hCD26 antibody (R&D system) at 37\u00ba C for 30 min. The cells were then washed and further incubated at 37\u00ba C for 30 min with an anti-mIgG/PE or an anti-goat IgG/TRITC (R&D system) antibody. After washing, the cells were analyzed using BD FACSCalibur.\n\nFor the binding-blocking assay, Huh7 cells were incubated with an anti-hCD26 or an anti-Flag antibody (Sigma) at 20 \u03bcg/ml or with 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl of purified hCD26 or hACE2 ecto-domain protein at 37\u00ba C for 30 min before the addition of HKU4-RBD-mFc.\n\nFor the BHK cell-staining, the cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1-CD26 or a control plasmid pEGFP-C1, harvested 48 h post-transfection, and stained with individual mouse Fc-fusion proteins as described above. The cells incubated only with the anti-mIgG/PE antibody were used as the negative controls.\n\nHEK 293T cells were used to package the pseudovirus particles. pCAGGS-HKU4-S or pCAGGS-MERS-S was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding an Env-defective, For the antibody blocking assay, Huh7 cells were first incubated with the anti-hCD26 antibody at the indicated concentrations. The cells were then infected with BatCoV HKU4 pseudoviruses treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin, incubated and tested for the luciferase activity as described above."}
