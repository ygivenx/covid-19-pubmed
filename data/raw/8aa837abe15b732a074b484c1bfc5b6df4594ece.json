{"title": "7 Safe handling of mammalian cells on an industrial scale", "body": "A.J. Beale\n\nThe industrial use of mammalian cells is a recent innovation compared with the long traditional use of microorganisms. There are three main industrial uses for these cells: the manufacture of viral vaccines, therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies. The health hazards which must be considered here are to the production staff and to the public at large. Details of methods for coping with hazards to users of products are outside the scope of this chapter.\n\nMammalian cells have been used extensively in cell or tissue cultures for research purposes from the early years of this century. It was not until Enders et al. (1949) showed that polio viruses could be grown in cell culture, and Salk et al. (1953) developed a poliomyelitis vaccine from virus grown in bulk that mammalian cells were used for manufacture of viral vaccines.\n\nFrom the outset, it was recognized that the large scale use of mammalian cells presented a number of safety problems. These were of three kinds: (1) danger of microbial contamination -the use of mammalian cells was made possible only by the advent of antibiotics and although antibiotics controlled bacteria, other potentially hazardous contaminants were soon revealed; (2) the potential hazard of growing viral pathogens, and later therapeutic proteins; (3) the potential hazard of working with cell lines of indefinite life span and which may be tumorigenic. This type of cell is essential for the production of therapeutic proteins using genetic modification techniques, and for the production of monoclonal antibodies.\n\nThe sources of contamination of cell cultures are the culture media components, especially derived from animals, the environment, and the cells themselves.\n\nContamination of culture medium is readily controlled by standard sterilization techniques supplemented by terminal filtration into the bulk culture vessels.\n\nThis presents a more difficult problem. Serum may be a source of a variety of microorganisms, but mycoplasmas, and viruses (including bacteriophages) are especially important. Much can be done to limit the bioburden of serum by careful collection of blood from animals known to be free from specific viral infections. Unfortunately, such a source is not always practical when large amounts of serum are required, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic proteins. The problem is exacerbated if the cells will grow only in medium containing fetal serum, which is frequently contaminated with bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus. This can be controlled by heating the serum or exposing it to gamma radiation. The presence of BVD virus may jeopardize production, but it does not offer a hazard to staff or the environment. A more serious problem is that posed recently by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (Report, 1989 ). This appears to be due to the agent which causes scrapie in sheep and it passed to cattle in recycled animal feed. It is not certain if this poses a threat to human health: there is no evidence that scrapie offers an occupational health hazard to those who work with sheep or sheep products. Since the virus has only recently crossed the species barrier into cattle, it is too early to judge whether it poses a threat to humans. The official committee set up to review the potential hazard considered that the risk is very remote (Report, 1989) . There is no evidence as to whether BSE or scrapie will replicate in animal cells in culture, but experiments to test this are underway.\n\nOn the basis of experiments with scrapie, information has become available about the 'infectivity' of different tissues and the relative dangers of various routes of infection. Thus, tissue from the central nervous system (CNS) is the most abundant source of the agent and the injection of the agent into CNS is the most successful route of infection. By contrast, serum contains many orders of magnitude less of the agent and seems to be an unlikely hazard within a properly engineered plant operating to good manufacturing practice standards. Little is known about aerosol transmission of the agent, but control of aerosols (Chapter 11 ) is an important part of plant design and operation for other reasons. The best solution is to obtain serum from areas of the world where BSE and scrapie do not occur, i.e. New Zealand and Australia. Risks to the staff and public are remote.\n\nEnvironmental contamination of culture vessels and other process equipment is also controlled by standard design and engineering practice. For example, the avoidance of areas where culture medium or condensate may collect away from the functional parts of the plant where homogeneous culture is achieved. It is also essential that all inlet and sampling ports are guarded (see Chapters 9 and 10).\n\nPrimary cells were the first mammalian cells to be used for large-scale vaccine production. The cells were obtained from monkey kidneys although it was realized that herpes virus simiae (B virus) was a dangerous human pathogen, there were several fatalities in manufacturing laboratories that were set up to produce polio vaccines (Hull, 1973) . There were also fatalities due to another virus, the Marburg agent, derived from monkeys (Simpson, 1977) . In addition, Hull et al. (1958) found that monkey kidney cultures were contaminated with a wide range of viruses although none of them were proved to be pathogens for humans. The simian virus (SV40), however, is tumorigenic in animals.\n\nPartial solutions have been found to the problem of viral contamination of mammalian cells. These are:\n\n(1) Using only primary cells from colonies of animals bred in isolation and regularly monitored (usually serologically) to ensure freedom of infection pathogens in a specific list ('specific pathogen-free (SPF) stock').\n\n(2) Using cells that can be maintained for long periods in culture and established as cell banks (see also section 6). The cell bank may then be extensively characterized and tested for extraneous viruses. The cells are generally of two kinds: cell strains, and cell lines typified by human diploid cell strains (HDCS). Continuous cell lines are usually heteroploid and have an unlimited life span in the laboratory. Examples are Vero cells, derived from monkey kidney, and CHO cells derived from Chinese hamster ovary. CHO cells are commonly used for the production of therapeutic proteins after insertion of the appropriate gene by genetic manipulation. Cells secreting monoclonal antibodies may also be established as a cell bank.\n\nCells that can be maintained in culture for long periods escape most of the problems of viral contamination once they have been established and characterized. There remains the problem of latent viruses with complete or partial integration of the viral nucleic acid into the host gene. Thus C type particles are frequently visualized in cell lines by electron microscopy and it is becoming practical to identify the specific sequences by DNA probes and to amplify them for study by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is no evidence of hazard from the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus or C type particles that have been found in such cell banks. The viruses appear to be defective and are not produced in a highly infectious form in cultures of the cell (Onions and Jarrett, 1987). Moreover, the processing of the products -vaccines, therapeutic proteins or antibodies -is designed to free them from extraneous protein and nucleic acids. Tests for residual virus or viral nucleic acids (NA) in the purified product should be developed. Low levels of cellular DNA (of the order of 10 pg per mg of product) may be present in the final product: if the viral NA is integrated into the cellular DNA, e.g. for herpes or retroviruses then a highly sensitive PCR test may reveal it. This may indicate a false positive result because it is infectious virus that is the potential hazard rather than DNA sequences. Tests for residual infectious virus or viral NA are therefore to be preferred using permissive culture conditions. The hazard from transformed cells is hypothetical. Attempts to transfer tumorigenicity from cell lines to animals using subcellular fractions have not been successful. The cells themselves may cause tumours in susceptible hosts including man after large numbers of them have been injected into an immunologically privileged site or into immunosuppressed animals, but even under the most favourable experimental conditions non-viral subcellular components have not been found to induce tumours. A laboratory worker developed a local tumour after accidental needle stick injury with a human tumour cell line (Gugel and Sanders, 1986) . It would appear, therefore, that there can be no danger from the mass culture of cells in a well-designed and well-operated plant where aerosols and spillages to the environment are kept to a minimum. This opinion is supported after extensive consideration in a WHO group (Report, 1987) and addressed by a Working Party of the European Federation of Biotechnology (Kuenzi et a/., 1987; Frommer et al, 1989 Frommer et al, , 1991 .\n\nPathogenic viruses that are deliberately cultured for vaccine production are either attenuated or virulent. Even when attenuated organisms are grown in large amounts it is common sense to treat them as potential pathogens, because they may be present, e.g. in aerosol form, in very large doses. When virulent viruses, e.g. polio virus, rabies, foot and mouth and Newcastle disease viruses are grown for the production of vaccines, safety is ensured by using well-designed and well-operated plant and the treatment of effluent by filtration and/or disinfection at the appropriate containment level, i.e. see Chapters 9 and 10; OECD, 1986; Frommer et \u03b1/., 1989).\n\nThe aim is to produce these by high yield and large volume methods and in a functional state in mammalian cells. The hazards, if any, can be assessed only on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the physiological function or pharmacological effects of the particular product, and whether it is active by any natural route. The agents that have so far been produced have not proved hazardous, nor is any hazard likely as the requirements of the basic cell culture process demand that it be contained and that aerosol formation is reduced to a minimum.\n\nThe key method of controlling hazards caused by viral infection is the establishment of a cell bank. This is essential to ensure that cells with the correct characteristics are used for production and that where a particular foreign gene has been inserted it is the right one with the desired orientation and copy numbers. When a cell bank has been established it is extensively tested by culture, electron microscopy and DNA probing for a list of viruses. Such lists are shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.\n\nIt is an axiom that when one works with biological systems one has to be on guard for the unexpected. In the development of vaccines and immunization procedures there have been a series of disasters, and these have been well reviewed by Wilson (1967) . The corrective action taken has provided a solid basis for confidence so that despite new problems and the revolution in genetic modification, biotechnology will remain safe. The emergence of BSE as a new and unsuspected hazard illustrates the type of problem \n\nMammalian non-haematogenous cells, e.g. fibroblasts and epithelial cells High\n\nBlood and marrow cells derived from human or non-human primates, caprine and ovine cells, hybridomas if one or more fusion partners is of human or non-human primate origin (From Frommer et ai, 1991) been extensively characterized. Classification of cells according to the likely hazard is shown in Table 7 .3. This is based on their likelihood of contamination with extraneous agents or carriage of viruses. When viruses are grown in cell cultures the containment level should be that appropriate to the hazard class of the virus."}
