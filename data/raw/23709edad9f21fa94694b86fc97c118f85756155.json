{"title": "Induction of lactogenic immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine using an attenuated coronavirus mutant able to survive in the physicochemical environment of the digestive tract", "body": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine is a highly contagious enteric viral disease of pigs under 2 weeks of age. It is well established that sows which have recovered from TGE are able to transmit protective immunity to their suckling pigs (Hooper and Halterman, 1966; Bohl et al., 1972) . Neutralization of TGE virus (TGEV) in the lumen of the gut of the newborn by antibodies continuously supplied by colostrum and milk of immune sows is believed to provide passive protection to suckling piglets. Numerous TGEV vaccines have been evaluated but their efficacy is questioned (Henning and Thomas, 1981; Bohl et al., 1982; Bohl, 1982; Moxley and Olson, 1989) . These attenuated TGEV live vaccines fail to initiate the gut and mammary gland immune response essential for providing optimal immunity (Salmon, 1987 ) . The low stability of cell culture adapted TGEV strains in gastric and gut juices (Laude et al., 1981; Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984) , which may destroy the virus during transit through the gut, is probably responsible for failures of oral vaccination. Using a survivor selection process in gastric juice, we have selected an attenuated mutant of TGEV which survives in the physico-chemical environment of the digestive tract of adult pigs (Aynaud et al., 1985) . Preliminary experiments carried out with a limited number of sows had indicated that this new TGEV mutant was capable of inducing a protective lactogenic immunity and that could be considered as a candidate for an oral TGEV vaccine (Aynaud et al., 1985) . The purpose in the present work was to study the lactogenic immunity afforded to suckling piglets on 40 sows immunized with this new mutant using oral, intramuscular and conjunctival routes. Passive protection was assayed by exposure of piglets to a standard challenge dose of fully virulent TGEV and antibody response was evaluated by titration of neutralizing activity in serum and milk collected from immunized sows at the time of challenge exposure.\n\nRP.D is a pig kidney cell line previously described (Laude et al., 1981 ) . The McClurkin swine testis ST cell line was supplied by E.H. Bohl (Wooster, Ohio, USA) . Minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was used for cell growth. The 188oSG strain of TGEV is an attenuated mutant obtained previously in our Laboratory from the virulent Gep-II strain by 188 serial cycles of survivor selection in gastric juices of adult pigs. The properties of this new TGEV strain were described previously (Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984; Aynaud et al., 1985; Bernard et al., 1986; Ngu-yen et al., 1987abc) . Attenuation has been verified by five serial back passages in fully susceptible neonatal pigs.\n\nThe high passaged Purdue-115 strain of TGEV was used for seroneutralization tests in cell culture. 188-SG and Purdue-115 were produced in RP.D cells, and virus infectivity titration was performed in ST cells using a plaque assay previously described (Aynaud et al., 1985) . The fully virulent Gep-II strain isolated in an acute outbreak in France was described elsewhere (Aynaud and Bottreau, 1984; Aynaud et al., 1985; Bernard et al., 1986) and was used for challenge of suckling piglets. Virulence of Gep-II strain was titrated in 4-day-old piglets.\n\nThe 59 sows used in this study were Large-White or Meishan bred. Fiftyfive were obtained from two TGEV free herds and were seronegative for TGEV. Four seropositive sows were obtained from a previously infected herd. Sows were housed in an isolation unit before and after farrowing, including the post challenge period.\n\n188-SG strain: the supernatant of RP.D culture (5 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/ml) was used for the vaccination. Oral vaccination was performed in fasting sows with 15 ml of virus diluted in 300 ml of McIlvaine's buffer (0.025 M, pH 4). For other immunization routes, 15 m of viral suspension (infected cell supernarant) was used for intramuscular vaccination, and 1 ml was administered to each eye for conjunctival vaccination. Gep-II strain: 5 ml of the fully virulent Gep-II strain ( 106 LD50/ml was diluted in 300 ml of McIlvaine's buffer. Protocole of immunization: a first virus dose was administered 42-49 days before parturition in some groups, a second virus dose (booster) was administered 7-15 days before farrowing.\n\nPassive protection of piglets against TGEV virulent challenge. 549 suckling piglets nursed by their own mother ( 59 sows) were challenged with 1000 LD50 of the virulent Gep-II strain by the oral route ( 1 ml) some days after birth. Clinical signs and mortality rate were scored during the following 15 days. A litter was considered protected if more than 70% of the challenged piglets survive.\n\nNeutralizing antibody response in serum and milk of sows. Serum and milk samples were collected at different periods (vaccination, booster, challenge, 10 days after challenge) and were examined for the presence of NT antibody using a microneutralization test in ST cells previously described (Toma and Benet, 1976) . In tables, only antibody titers evaluated at challenge time and 10 days later are shown. Immunochemical analysis of antibody classes in serum and milk samples of some sows was published previously Shira'i et al., 1988) .\n\nTotal mortality rates of the sow/vaccine groups were taken into account instead of protection rate per litter due to the need to incorporate all the data without further assumption in the mortality rate to class the sows in non protected and protected groups. Comparison between routes of immunization were made by,~2 and in the case of differences, comparison between two groups were done.\n\nNo clinical response was observed in sows following vaccination. Following virulent infection with Gep II strain, sows exhibited clinical reactions.\n\nLitters from control sows.\n\nSeronegative susceptible (SS) sows (Table 1 ). All piglets nursing at 9 (SS) sows exhibited acute clinical signs (vomitting, diarrhea, dehydration ) by 24 h after challenge exposure. Death occurred in 3 to 8 days. Sixty-five out of 70 control piglets died. The mortality rate of this group was 93%. Using, ELISA, TGEV could be shown in the diarrheic faeces (Bernard et al., 1986 ) . (Table 1) . Studies were conducted on 4 sows from a herd which had been naturally infected with TGE 17 months ago. After challenge exposure of 41 suckling piglets morbidity was mild and delayed. The mortality rate was 15% and 3 litters out of 4 were considered to be protected. (Table 2) . Immunization with Gep-II virulent strain was carried out twice by the oral route in six pregnant sows. Following the first oral inoculation, all sows exhibited clinical signs such as no appetite, depression and diarrhea. After challenge exposure of piglets only two litters out of six were observed slightly sick during 4 to 7 days post exposure. Only one piglet out of 59 died, resulting in a mortality rate of 1.6% and all the litters were protected. \n\nOral priming without booster (Table 3) . Seven sows were vaccinated. Challenge exposure of 54 piglets induced intense morbidity among all piglets. Mortality rate was 81% and no litter was protected.\n\nOral priming and oral booster (OR~OR) ( Table 3 ). After challenge exposure of 95 suckling piglets ( 10 litters), delayed clinical reactions of varied intensity were observed but diarrhea occurred generally in most litters (except 542 and Oral priming and oral booster with killed virus (Table 3) . A sow ( 1099 ) was primed and boosted by the oral route with a vaccine dose composed of 8. l07 PFU inactivated by ultraviolet treatment just before administration. After challenge exposure all piglets of the litter died after typical signs of TGE. \n\nand mortality was 57%. Two litters out of 7 were protected. cinated twice by the conjunctival route. After challenge exposure of 76 piglets, morbidity was intense in all litters an the mortality rate was high (62%). Only 1 litter ( 173 ) out of 7 was protected. Statistical analysis (chi-square) shows that the oral/oral and intramuscular/intramuscular routes were more potent than the oral/intramuscular or conjunctival/conjunctival routes. Comparing separately the conjunctival/conjunctival and non immunized sows, it appears that this route is effective (Z2= 10.45, P=0.001 ). On the other hand, comparison between oral/oral and intramuscular/intramuscular by Chi-square reveals that oral/oral is more potent than intramuscular/intramuscular (Z 2 = 5.22, P< 0.05 ).\n\nWhatever the conditions of immunization, all sows showed a seroconversion demonstrated by a significant NT antibody increase after vaccination (Tables 1-4 ). Antibody titers observed at the time of challenge in serum and milk of sows are similar except for sows primed and boosted by the intramuscular route where high antibody titers were seen in serum but low titers in milk. Comparing antibody levels at challenge exposure of piglets, 6 NI or EI sows out of 7 showed milk antibody titers which were equal or higher than those in serum. Conversely, whatever the immunization procedure, only 2 (5215, 155) out of 39 vaccinated sows showed a comparable situation of serum and milk. After challenge exposure antibody titers increased exclusively in vaccinated sows. Thus, only 1 sow (no. 155) out of 39 vaccinated sows did not exhibit an significant anamnestic antibody response (Table 4 ) .\n\nAfter oral priming and oral boostering (sow 1099, Table 3 ) with ultraviolet inactivated vaccine, NT antibody was not detectable in serum and milk at the time of challenge suggesting that multiplication of TGEV is needed for induction of a detectable humoral immune response. A slight antibody increase was observed in serum of sow 1099 and also in serum and milk of control SS sows after challenge exposure of suckling piglets (Table 1 ) suggesting a primary antibody response against the virulent TGEV excreted by diarrheic piglets.\n\nEvaluation of the passive protection against TGE is largely dependant on the virulence of TGEV strain used for challenge. The virulent Miller strain used previously by several authors (Bohl et al., 1972; Bohl et al., 1975; Henning and Thomas, 1981; Bohl and Saif, 1975; Moxley and Olson, 1989) was not retained in this study because of its moderate pathogenicity observed in our experimental conditions. In our experiments the mortality rate observed with Miller strain never exceeded 68% (data not shown). In contrast, with an isolate from an acute outbreak in France (Gep-II strain) a high mor-tality rate was regularly obtained. In the negative control experiment presented in this report, a mortality rate of 100% was obtained in 8 out of 9 susceptible litters. With the Miller strain, the age of piglets at challenge was noted by Moxley and Olson (1989) as a factor influencing the mortality rate. In our experimental conditions, a statistical analysis carried out on the 59 litters challenged with the highly virulent Gep-II strain, demonstrated no significant relationship between age of piglets at challenge and mortality rate (correlation coefficient r2= 0.005, P> 20%).\n\nWe compared the ability of the 188-SG strain given by different routes, to induce lactogenic protection. There is considerable variation among groups of vaccinated sows in regard to the mortality rate of piglets, 81% (oral route ) to 24% (oral/oral route). It is evident that booster immunization is essential to induce high protection. The oral route for priming and for boostering also influenced the induction of a high protection rate (76%) against mortality similar to that observed among naturally infected sows (75%). This observation indicated that repeated oral administration of vaccine influences the development of TGEV protective immunity. Absence of detectable humoral immune response after oral vaccination with ultraviolet treated virus suggests also that repeated antigenic stimulations of the gut with an appropriate replicating antigen is needed for optimal induction of passive protection. The heterogeneous immune response among the eight sows vaccinated and boosted by the intramuscular route (four litters well protected and four fully susceptible ) was similar to the observations reported by Bohl and Saif ( 1975 ) after intramuscular injection of pregnant sows with virulent TGEV. As postulated by these authors, passive protection is strongly dependent on whether the sow gut was infected by a haematogenous spread of virus. The possibility that infected macrophages (Laude et al., 1984) spread the vaccinal virus to the gut or mammary gland after intramuscular administration has been suggested. Arguing the concept of a common mucosal immune system, we postulated that conjunctival route (Montgomery et al., 1983) , which has been used successfully against various pathogens (Fensterbank et al., 1985; Tannock et al., 1985; Kramer et al., 1987) , would be an alternative approach to oral immunization. Unfortunately it was inefficient in our experiments in terms of protection although all vaccinated sows exhibited serum and milk neutralizing antibodies after conjunctival vaccination. The reason of this lack of success is unknown but it probably suggests that the conjunctival route is not able to induce local antigenic stimulation of gut.\n\nAll vaccinated sows developed significant antibody titers in serum and milk whatever the degree of protection transmitted to suckling piglets. Our results confirmed the lack of correlation between degree of passive protection of piglets and level of neutralizing antibodies in sow serum (r=0.06) and milk (r= 0.06 ) at time of challenge observed by previous authors (Bohl et al., 1972; Bohl and Sail 1975; Moxley and Olson, 1989) . However, after challenge exposure 95% of vaccinated sows showed an anamnestic antibody response, generally higher when the degree of protection of the litter was low. In contrast, all naturally or experimentally infected sows failed to show such anamnestic response. We suggest that the lack of anamnestic response observed in sows after challenge exposure of piglets could be considered as an a posteriori index of protective lactogenic immunity. These present results confirmed our previous preliminary observations (Aynaud et al., 1985; Shira'i et al., 1988) . Furthermore, when sensitive immunochemical approaches (ELISA, immunoadsorbent) were used, IgA antibody was detected at time of challenge in the milk of experimentally infected sows and also in milk of orally vaccinated and boostered sows . But in contrast to infected sows, the IgA antibody level was never predominant in the milk of vaccinated sows, suggesting that mechanisms involved in TGE lactogenic immunity induced by attenuated 188-SG strain could be different from those for virulent TGEV strain (Bohl et al., 1972) .\n\n188-SG strain did not induce a complete protective lactogenic immunity compared with natural or experimental virulent infection; morbidity was frequently observed in surviving litters. Nevertheless these results suggest that oral immunization of the pregnant sow with this new strain is successful in comparison with previous attenuated TGE vaccines which were of limited effectiveness (Henning and Thomas, 1981; Bohl et al., 1982; Bohl, 1982; Moxley and Olson, 1989) .\n\nThe protective immunity induced by vaccination with the 188-SG strain could be partly explained by (1) higher stability of the 188-SG strain in the physico-chemical environment of the digestive tract in the sow, allowing the virus to reach the susceptible sites in gut (2) high content of structural antigens compared with Purdue-115 (Bernard et al., 1986; Nguyen et al., 1987a) and Ambico strain (data not shown), allowing the virus to survive inactivation by digestive proteases. The exact mechanism leading to induction of protective immunity following immunization with the 188-SG strain is still unknown. 188-SG strain is characterized by different in vitro properties (resistance to acidity and proteases, higher content of structural antigens, delay in viral multiplication) (Aynaud et al., 1985; Nguyen et al., 1987a) which can have possible repercussions on conditions of virus multiplication and also presentation of viral antigens at the surface of infected enterocytes. The amount of appropriate antigen produced by gut epithelial cells and processed by antigen presenting cells would perhaps be a crucial factor mainly involved in induction of optimal local immune response and the development of TGEV lactogenic immunity. Better knowledge in this field and analysis of milk immune factors connected with protection is without doubt the key of any improvement in TGEV immunization, whatever the type of vaccine."}
