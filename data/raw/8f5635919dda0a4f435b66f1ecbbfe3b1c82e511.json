For a more detailed discussion of reaction mechanisms the reader is also referred to Rao et al. [12] , Ward et al. [20] , and Fujinami and Fujisawa [3] . The principal enzyme types are exoproteases, which act at or near the ends of the peptide chains, delineated as aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases to indicate their action is at the N-or C-terminals of the peptide substrates. These enzymes may be further differentiated depending on the size of the moiety that is cleaved off, be it, for example, an amino acid, a dipeptide, or a tripeptide. Industrial organisms known to produce aminopeptidases include Aspergillus oryzae, Bacillus licheniformis, B. stearothermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Carboxypeptidases, which are produced by species such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Saccharomyces species, are differentiated further into three groups based on the presence of certain amino acid substituents at their active sites, namely the serine carboxyproteases, the metallocarboxyproteases, and the cysteine carboxyproteases. Endoproteases, which attack internal peptide bonds in the peptide chain remote from the C-or N-terminal, are further differentiated into the following subgroups based on their specific mechanism of action:\n\n1. Serine endoproteases, having a serine residue at their active sites which participates in the catalytic reaction, have broad specificities and indeed these enzymes catalyze hydrolytic reactions involving esters and amides as well as peptides. Important well-known enzymes of this subgroup include the chymotrypsins and the subtilisins. Many serine proteases have high pH optima in the range 7-12, with those in the pH range 9-10 being known as serine alkaline proteases or the first generation of detergent proteases and those with pH optima of 11-12 being known as the high alkaline proteases, the second generation of detergent proteases. The subtilisins are an important family of serine proteases produced by Bacillus species. These enzymes were also the starting material for development of a third generation of detergent enzymes, resistant to oxidation by bleach and related detergent oxidants, which involved substitution of an oxidation-sensitive amino acid near the enzyme's active site with an oxidation-resistant amino acid. These enzymes are further discussed under commercial Bacillus proteases below.\n\n2. Aspartic endoproteases, have low pH optima (3) (4) and contain a pair of aspartic acid residues at their active sites, and are sorted into two groups: pepsins and pepsin-like enzymes (e.g., produced by Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Rhizopus species) and rennet and rennet-like enzymes (e.g., produced by Mucor pusillus, M. Miehei, and Endothia species).\n\n3. Cysteine/thiol endoproteases contain a cysteine-histidine dyad at their catalytic sites and generally require reducing agents for retention of catalytic activity and are denatured or inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. Subgroups include papain and papain-like enzymes (including clostripain and streptopain from Clostridium histolyticum and Streptomyces species, respectively).\n\n4. Metalloendoproteases. Biocatalysis requires the presence of a bound divalent cation. These enzymes are inhibited by ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid but not by sulfhydryl reagents or diisopropylfluorophosphate. The highly thermostable neutral zinc protease produced by B. stearothermophilus, thermolysin, is a well-known member of this subgroup. Protein stability is enhanced by four calcium atoms. Other group members include the metalloprotease collagenases (microbial example from C.histolyticum), the neutral metalloprotease elastase (microbial example from P. aeruginosa), and the alkaline cell wall lytic protease I from Myxobacter sp.\n\n5. Glutamic acid and threonine endoproteases represent recently characterized new enzyme families having reaction mechan isms that involve specific participation of active-site glutamic acid and threonine, respectively.\n\nAn important link dealing with protease classification and mechanisms of protease action includes MEROPS: the peptidase database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/).\n\nEnzymes have been extracted from animal sources since ancient times where milk being carried in calf stomachs was observed to clot (due to the activity of calf rennet or chymosin). The best source of the enzyme is the fourth stomach of unweaved calves, where it is present together with pepsin, but the ratio of pepsin to rennet is low. In Denmark, Christian Hansen started commercial production of chymosin by extracting calf stomach with saline. Similar approaches were used to produce bovine pepsin. Typically, the enzyme-containing tissues are preserved at the slaughterhouse by salting, freezing, or drying. Salted stomachs may be washed and dried prior to rennet extraction. The dried calf stomach may be sliced, blended or ground, and extracted with water containing 5-10% NaCl to produce what is known as single-strength rennet. Concentration of the single-strength liquid product using ultrafiltration is used to produce double-or triple-strength rennet.\n\nPlant proteolytic enzymes, such as papain from Carica papaya and bromelain from the pineapple family Bromeliaceae, have also been produced commercially. In the case of bromelain, the stem component of the pineapple plant after harvesting of the fruit is peeled, crushed, and pressed to recover a juice extract containing the soluble bromelain enzyme. Papain is obtained from the green fruit. The latex is released by making incisions in the fruit, which is laden with liquid in the early morning. The latex tends to congeal on the surface of the fruit from which it may be collected. The collected gel-like latex may be dried on trays at temperatures up to 55 \u00b0C using forced air or alternatively it may be liquefied, filtered, and spray dried to produce the crude enzyme. Further purification may involve water extraction and solvent precipitation. Carbohydrate/plant gum-depolymerizing enzymes may be added to remove cloud and viscous plant polysaccharides from crude aqueous extracts. During processing, or when the final product is in the form of a liquid, the labile active site sulfhydryl groups are protected by addition of sodium bisulfite.\n\nInitial commercial production of enzymes by fermentation evolved from traditional koji solid substrate oriental food fermenta tions, which utilized media containing starchy-protein constituents such as wheat, bran, soy beans, and others. These methods were used up to the mid-1950s in the United States and are still applied in Japan. Following the development of the penicillin-submerged culture fermentation at the US Northern Regional Research Laboratories, submerged fermentations, including the production of proteases, were developed for enzyme production, initially in the United States and Europe, initially for applications in food and beverage processing. These deep-stirred and aerated production fermentors typically have working volumes of 50-200 m 3 and are designed to withstand 'autoclaving' conditions, namely >15 psi and >121 \u00b0C for sterilization. It is worth mentioning in passing that it is well established that the overall mix of enzymes produced in solid substrate fermentations tends to be more complex than the corresponding enzyme profile produced by the same strain in submerged culture, likely reflecting the more complex nature of the substrate components used in solid substrate fermentations. Interestingly, when chymosin yields produced by a recombinant Aspergillus strain in solid substrate and submerged cultures were compared, much higher yields were observed in the solid-state culture.\n\nThe market for industrial enzymes expanded substantially during the 1960s when alkaline proteases were first commercialized for use in detergents. The most important microbial strains used in protease production are Bacillus species, used to produce the alkaline serine proteases with applications in detergents and in food processing, and the neutral proteases that are used in brewing and related cereal-mashing applications as well as in general food processing. Fungal proteases are also produced commercially for food applications, with Aspergillus species as dominant producers. Bacillus and Aspergillus species are attractive hosts for production of food proteases as many species of these genera have long been known to be participating in traditional food fermentations and some of the strains (B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, A. niger, and A. oryzae) are on the GRAS list of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnNavigation.cfm?rpt=grasListing), meaning these organisms and their products are 'generally regarded as safe'.\n\nAll of the predominant industrial microbial proteases are secreted as extracellular enzymes into the culture medium. Bacillus and Aspergillus species exhibit high growth rates, and this contributes to short fermentation durations. Biotechnology aspects of these species have been discussed by Schallmey et al. [13] and Ward et al. [19] . The bacterial and fungal enzyme final production fermentation processes have typical durations of 2-4 and 3-5 days, respectively. Extracellular enzyme concentrations of up to 30 g l \u22121 may be achieved. Following the fermentation, the biomass is separated by centrifugation (for bacteria) or filtration (filamentous fungi) and the clarified supernatant/filtrate is usually concentrated as a liquid to the desired final product strength for commercial use. Where alkaline proteases are to be added to detergent powders, the enzymes in liquid concentrates are dried into powder form and subsequently prepared as the characteristic wax-containing granules present in enzyme detergents, which protects the user from undesirable inhalation of protease dusts.\n\n'Wild-type' Bacillus alkaline proteases have been characterized into two generations of enzymes based on their source organisms and pH optima. A third generation of alkaline proteases enzymes has been artificially engineered by amino acid substitutions to improve their properties. This is discussed in more detail in the detergent enzyme section. Commercial neutral proteases produced by Bacillus species are typically zinc metalloproteases with pH optima at or near 7.0, with applications in brewing for production of amino nitrogen to support yeast growth, for optimization of cereal extract recovery during mashing, for chill-proof haze removal from beverages such as beer, and for modification of soy, milk, or other commercial protein preparations.\n\nOne of the most important industrial proteases produced by Aspergillus species is the pepsin-like acid protease, produced by A. saitoi, which is widely used for hydrolysis of soybean protein in the manufacture of soy sauce. The principal commercial acid protease produced by A. oryzae is an endoacting enzyme, which consequently only produced a small amount of free amino acids, with a pH optimum of 4-4.5. This enzyme needs to be combined with a protease having high carboxypeptidase activity, for use in soy sauce manufacture, as it is the high concentration of free amino acids in soy sauce that contribute to the characteristic flavor. Various Aspergillus species produce Aspergillopeptidase A, which has a low pH optimum, which renders it suitable for use as a human digestive aid.\n\nAmong the Gram-positive bacteria, priority was given to characterizing the genome of B. subtilis and its complete sequence was published in Kunst et al. [7] . The identification of genes associated with the major secretory pathway in Bacillus species, encoding five type I and a type II signal peptidase were perceived as important to the capacity of these species to secrete large amounts of extracellular enzymes. The whole genome of B. halodurans [15] has also been sequenced which is especially important given this strain's capacity to produce extracellular enzymes including protease having high alkaline activity and stability. Early recombinant research strategies with B. subtilis, involving introduction of engineered plasmids were problematical because recombination processes over many generations caused plasmid sequence deletions, a problem which was somewhat resolved by development of mutant strains lacking certain recombinant enzymes. A few instances have been cited regarding the development of high-level expression of B. subtilis genes, which involved the use of native alpha-amylase native high enzyme-producing promoter. More stable clones were achieved by strategies that involved direct insertion of recombinant DNA into the chromosome and strategies for amplification of gene copy number were also successful.\n\nMolecular and genetic studies were concentrated on a number of industrially important Aspergillus species, including A. nidulans, and the naturally occurring enzyme production hosts, A. niger and A. oryzae. Genomes of these organisms have been sequenced. Websites providing molecular and genetic information on these Aspergillus species are summarized in Ward et al. [19] . In addition, the latter review also discusses causes of low levels of production of heterologous proteins by Aspergillus species, including limitations at the sites of transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels and strategies to improve heterologous gene expression through gene fusion, protease-deficient mutants and other approaches.\n\nThe first recombinant heterologous product to gain approval from the US FDA was calf chymosin, for use in cheese making, produced by an Aspergillus species. The precursor, preprochymosin is first synthesized after which the 16-amino-acid presequence is cleaved off during the secretion process. A 42-amino-acid prosequence is subsequently removed during further processing of the protein at a low pH. Improved yields of chymosin were achieved using a combination of strategies including gene fusion, classical mutation/selection, and through use of aspergillopepsin-minus mutants. On the other hand, Kluyveromyces lactis is the microbial host used by DSM for production of their recombinant chymosin product, Maxiren.\n\nRao et al. [12] have provided extensive tables on the cloning, sequencing, and expression of protease genes from microbial sources, including bacteria (including Bacillus, Lactococcus, Streptomyces, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Vibrio species, and E. coli), fungi (including Aspergillus, Fusarium, Rhizopus, and Mucor species), yeasts (including Saccharomyces, Candida, and Kluyveromyces species), animal viruses (including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, retroviruses, and picornaviruses), and plant mosaic viruses.\n\nThe most characterized subtilisins are subtilisin Carlsberg (produced by B. licheniformis, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis), and subtilisin  BPN (produced by B. amyloliquefaciens, B. stearothermophilus, and B.subtilis) . Subtilisin Carlsberg, with pH optimum values of pH 9-10, produced by neutralophilic Bacillus species, represents the first generation of alkaline proteases commercialized for use in detergents (e.g., Alcalase (Novozymes) and Nagarase (Nagase, www.nagase.com/technology/enzymes.asp)).\n\nA second generation of detergent proteases, the high-alkaline proteases, produced in alkalophilic Bacillus species, such as B. clausii and B. halodurans, exhibited higher optimal pH values (pH 11-12) and greater thermostability (up to 60 \u00b0C, without calcium) are also serine proteases, albeit with some unique amino acid residue features thought to contribute to alkaline-and thermostability, which have also been observed in alkaline cellulase [3] . Examples of commercial high alkaline detergent proteases are M-protease (Kao Corporation: www.kao.com/jp/en/corp_rd/development_02_01.html) and Savinase (Novozymes). For exam ple, the amino acids Arg19, Glu271, Thr274, and Arg275 of the commercialized second-generation detergent proteases, M-protease, appear to form a pattern of stabilizing hydrogen bond networks, which also link both C-and N-terminals. These patterns appear to be conserved among second-generation proteases, whereas they are not observed in the subtilisin Carlsberg-type alkaline proteases.\n\nAlthough the above first and second generations of proteases originate from wild-type organisms, genetic and protein engineer ing methods have been used to artificially enhance proteases with respect to different desirable catalytic and/or stability properties. Subtilisin was used as the starting enzyme for development of a third generation of detergent proteases, whereby a methionine residue near the serine residue at the active site, which is undesirably oxidized by detergent additives such as bleach, is replaced with a nonoxidizable amino acid moiety (serine, alanine, or leucine) through site-directed mutagenesis to produce oxidant-resistant proteases. This kind of strategy has been used in oxidant-resistant commercial third-generation proteases such as Purafect OxP (Genencor) and Durazyme (Novozymes). In another example, a number of detergent proteases were engineered which exhibit relatively high activity at low temperatures, which are effective in cold-water washes at 10-20 \u00b0C. Novozymes' detergent alkaline protease, Kannase, is an example of such an enzyme.\n\nProteases are used in the mashing stage of brewing and general cereal processing where it functions to increase the volume of filterable extract and enhances the amount of alpha-amino nitrogen in wort. The generally accepted amount of alpha-amino nitrogen requirement for yeast growth in a normal fermentation is 140-180 mg l \u22121 . In an all malt mash, the malt proteases typically produce the requisite amount of amino nitrogen from the principal proteins of barley, hordein and glutelin, both during the malting process and during mashing. As the proportion of malt is decreased or eliminated through use of unmalted cereals there is a requirement to replace the malt protease with industrial proteases, especially neutral proteases from Bacillus and also from Aspergillus species. Bacillus alkaline protease is not effective for this application. These enzymes may also be used for production of cereal extract concentrates, where filterable extract yield is the priority rather than amino nitrogen and, in this case, papain may also be used to promote proteolysis. It should also be noted that the temperature-time holds during mashing are designed to meet the activity requirements of the mashing enzymes including protease, amylases, and glucanases. In mashing with malt enzymes, the lowest temperature hold is around 50 \u00b0C, called the 'proteolytic' stand as malt proteases have temperature optima around this setting and quickly get denatured as the temperature is increased. Some of the microbial proteases and papain have higher temperature optima at 55-65 \u00b0C, enabling the mashing process to be implemented at high temperatures that are more optimal for starch gelatinization and hydrolysis of starch and betaglucans.\n\nProteases have a second application in brewing for removal of chill haze. After final beer filtration when beer is stored at low temperatures there is a tendency for a haze to develop due to low solubility of residual proteoglycans in finished beer. Papain is particularly effective at hydrolyzing these polymers, thereby removing the haze. These applications are further discussed in Ward [17, 18] .\n\nAcidic aspartic proteases are used as milk-clotting enzymes in cheese making because of their characteristic ability to coagulate milk proteins to form curds with associated release of whey. There are now three types of commercial milk-coagulating enzymes: animal rennets, microbial rennets, and genetically engineered calf rennet (chymosin), the latter two being developed due to a world shortage of calf rennet as a result of the substantial increases over the years in cheese production. The uniqueness of rennet as a protease is its extremely high substrate specificity, in that it hydrolyzes a single-specific peptide bond (Phe105-Met106) in the k-casein fraction of milk, to produce para-k-casein and a macropeptide, without attacking other caseins. As k-casein serves to maintain the milk micelles in suspension, whereas neither the para-k-casein nor a macropeptide serves this function, cleavage of this bond by rennet results in destabilization of the milk micelles and cheese coagulation.\n\nThe initial stages of the cheese-making process typically involve the use of lactic acid producing starter cultures to reduce the pH of the milk (or cream) to about pH 4.6, where the predominant casein proteins approach their isoelectric pHs, rendering them more amenable to coagulation. At this point, rennet is added to effect coagulation. Thus, a unique property of rennet is its very high ratio of milk clotting to general proteolytic activity and the challenge in searching for microbial rennets was to find enzymes that approached this characteristic activity ratio. Many of the candidates tended to have higher proteolytic activity that manifested itself in the production of weaker curds or in softening of the cheese over time in storage.\n\nThe most important native microbial cheese-making enzyme commercialized as a result of these searches was the enzyme produced by Rhizomucor miehei. Recombinant chymosin was introduced in the late 1980s.\n\nWhey, the byproduct of cheese making is rich in proteins, some of which may be rendered insoluble by heat denaturation. Both the insoluble and soluble proteins of whey may be hydrolyzed into peptides and amino acids, mediated by trypsin and microbial proteases with pH optima reflecting the pH properties of the whey.\n\nProteases are used in baking to modify gluten, a protein in wheat with viscoelastic properties that has the ability to expand as bread dough rises during the baking process. The dough-making process can be accelerated by addition of proteases to partially hydrolyze the gluten. For example, weak gluten flour is needed for biscuit making but is difficult to source. This problem may be resolved by protease-catalyzed degradation of gluten in more readily obtainable high gluten-containing flour. Typically, heat-labile fungal proteases are used for gluten hydrolysis in baking, such that the enzyme denatures as temperature rises in the early stages of baking. A second application of proteases in baking relates to the modifications linked to flavor and nutritional development. Bacterial neutral proteases may be used for this purpose, for example, in production of biscuits, cookies, and crackers.\n\nProtein hydrolysates are widely used as food and feed additives, where they have a variety of protein property altering characteristics. Many types of proteins, including soy protein, gelatin, caseins, and whey proteins may be modified using proteases. Fish and meat hydrolysates are prepared using proteases, and proteases may also be used for meat tenderization. Indeed, natural meat tenderization mediated by endogenous proteases in the muscle after animal slaughter is known to occur. Proteases may be used to recover proteins from bones during animal rendering, which in turn may be incorporated into canned soups, sauces, and meats, especially cured meats and sausages. Microbial proteases, especially the Bacillus alkaline serine proteases have long been used for preparation of protein hydrolysates. However, neutral proteases, for example, from B. licheniformis are also used for this application. Where protein hydrolysis is implemented under more acidic conditions, proteases from fungi such as A. oryzae and Rhizopus niveus, and related strains are more frequently applied. Protein hydrolysates, after enzyme hydrolysis, may be used in human food formulations, including in infant formula and in animal feeds, or the protease may be added to the protein-containing food or feed, enabling proteolysis to take place during further processing of the food or feed. Protein hydrolysates have useful functional properties for fortifying fruit juices and other beverages. Protein hydrolysates are known to have important blood-pressure-regulating properties and may be used as therapeutic dietary agents.\n\nMany applications of proteases in food processing and protein hydrolysates relate to flavor production. Manipulation of hydrolytic conditions for hydrolysis of soy protein by Bacillus alkaline protease can result in the development of contrasting functional and flavor properties. A well-recognized problem in the protease-mediated production of protein hydrolysates is the associated development of a characteristic bitter taste, which is attributed to the presence of hydrophobic amino acids as well as proline within the peptides generated by proteolysis. The bitterness is often attributed to terminal hydrophobic amino acids of the peptides produced, but nonterminal hydrophobic amino acids in small to medium-sized oligopeptides may also exhibit a bitter taste, whereas larger peptides appear nonbitter. Bitter tastes have been observed in some cheese-making processes and were attributed to a protease derived from Pseudomonas R098. Hence, the importance of controlling the hydrolysis process to minimize these bitter tastes.\n\nThere are four principal steps in leather processing: soaking, dehairing, bating, and tanning. Soaking generally involves addition of alkali solutions that are applied to swell the hide. Application of high alkali concentrations combined with a hydrogen sulfide treatment step for protein hair root solubilization contributes to conventional chemical removal of hair and/or wool from hides. As occurs in other industries, there is a strong move away from use of harsh chemicals in processing because of the associated safety risks to workers handling these materials. Also, these methods add significant high costs to effluent treatment and waste disposal and increase risks of spills and pollution. Therefore, more environmentally friendly approaches are desirable and proteases can fill this niche. Protease application in leather processing, thus, reduces the safety, higher handling, and disposal costs associated with chemical treatments. Furthermore, the potential to apply proteases to selectively attack noncollagenous protein constituents offers the opportunity to enhance leather quality over and above what is achievable through chemical treatment.\n\nProteases may be applied to processes for silk manufacture. The silk protein sericin imparts a rough texture to raw silk fibers and expensive processes involving starch application in shrink proofing and twist setting have been used to remove sericin from the core silk fiber proteins. A number of processes that use proteases for silk degumming prior to implementation of key dyeing processes have been described in the patent literature.\n\nProteases have also found more specialized applications in processes for purification of nonprotein products from animal or plant extracts including extraction of carbohydrate gums and mucopolysaccharides. Proteases may be used for solubilization of keratin materials to convert waste materials such as feathers to protein concentrates for use as animal feeds. An alkaline protease from Streptomyces species also has strong keratinolytic activity. The plant proteases, papain and bromelain are effective as meat tenderization enzymes, as is the B. subtilis neutral protease. Other industrial applications of proteases include their use in silver recovery from conventional gelatin-containing photographic film including X-ray film, and in the liquefaction of industrial and household organic waste. Proteases may also be consumed by humans and animals as digestive aids.\n\nAlthough traditionally proteases have been applied for hydrolysis of peptide bonds, it has been known for a long time that proteases can catalyze the reverse reaction, namely enabling synthesis of peptide bonds, where the reaction mixture contains high concentra tions of amino acids or peptides that drive the equilibrium of the reaction toward synthesis. More recently, hydrolytic enzymes have been applied for catalysis of reactions involving water as reactant or product, whereby the water concentration in the reaction medium is partially or wholly replaced by another solvent, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium in favor of synthesis. As water molecules may also participate in maintaining the requisite conformational structure of proteins for biocatalysis, much research has been directed to understanding the impact of water, and indeed water concentration on enzyme activity and stability and the associated impact of implementing enzyme reactions in nonconventional organic media or biphasic aqueous-organic systems. In addition, enzymes have been identified or engineered to be more stable in organic solvents. For example, a microbial protease from Thermus strain Rt4A2 is very stable in organic solvents. Subtilisin has been rendered more stable in organic solvents by covalent modification of the enzyme using selected polymers or by application of covalent or noncovalent methods to bind the enzyme to supports. The research of Chen and Arnold (reviewed by Kuchner and Arnold [5] ) applied the tools and concepts of directed evolution to developing subtilisin proteases that were active in the presence of organic solvents and, hence, applicable to using proteases catalyze synthesis of peptides and related bonds. Protease PST-01 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which exhibits a high level of homology to thermolysin, also contains a disulfide bond (one of two), which contributes substantially to its solvent stability. Another approach to replacing water in the reaction medium is to use supercritical fluids as the reaction solvent. These topics are discussed in detail in two excellent texts edited by Patel [10, 11] . The following are some examples of the applications of proteases in bioorganic synthesis:\n\n1. The capacity of proteases to synthesize di-and oligopeptides by coupling of peptide esters to N-protected amino acids was exploited by Toya Soda Company Japan for aspartame (L-phe-L-asp-methyl ester) synthesis, mediated by thermolysin from B. thermoproteolyticus. The immobilized thermolysin catalyzes formation of aspartame through reaction of L-aspartyl-methyl ester with L-phenylalanine containing an amino group blocking agent, after which the blocking agent may be removed chemically.\n\n2. Prolyl-endopeptidase from Flavobacterium meningoseptum, a thermostable protease from C. Thermohydrosulfuricum, and pronase from Streptomyces griseus have been used for synthesis of various peptides.\n\n3. Proteases, such as subtilisin and clostripain have been used in glycoconjugate synthesis. Strategies included participation of the enzyme directly in acylation of the carbohydrate or in formation of a peptide bond between a glycopeptide and a peptide.\n\n4. The ability of proteases to mediate a variety of other reactions in addition to peptide bond cleavage, namely reactions involving esters and amides of carboxylic acids, renders them interesting and effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers in racemic mixtures through enantioselective bond cleavage or formation. Example enzymes that have been applied for this purpose include subtilisin, A. oryzae protease, and serine alkaline protease from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris. The leucine aminopeptidase from P. putida ATCC 12633 has been cloned into E. coli K-12 and has been commercialized for production of several optically pure L-and D-amino acids using resolution strategies. Subtilisin, thermolysin, chymotrypsin, and papain have been applied in preparative synthesis of Leu-and Met-enkephalin."}
