{"title": "Tracing DAY-ZERO and Forecasting the Fade out of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A Compartmental Modelling and Numerical Optimization Approach", "body": "The butterfly effect in chaos theory underscores the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, highlighting the importance of even a small change in the state of a nonlinear system. The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that caused a viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, 5 China in early December 2019 has evolved into the COVID-19 acute respiratory disease pandemic due to its alarming levels of spread and severity, with a total of 298,393 confirmed infected cases, 91,540 recovered and 12,755 deaths in 167 countries as of March 21, 2020 ([1] ). The seemingly far from the epicenter, old continent became the second-most impacted region after Asia Pacific to date, on February 21 was the first secondary infection case (\"patient 1\"). \"Patient 0\" was never identified by tracing the first Italian citizen's movements and 20 contacts. In less than a week, the explosive increase in the number of cases in several bordering regions and autonomous provinces of northern Italy placed enormous strain on the decentralized health system. Following an a dramatic spike in deaths from COVID-19, Italy transformed into a \"red zone\", and the movement restrictions were expanded to the entire country on the 8th of March. 25 All public gatherings were cancelled and school and university closures were extended through at least the next month.\n\nIn an attempt to assess the dynamics of the outbreak for forecasting purposes as well as to estimate epidemiological parameters that cannot be computed directly based on clinical data, such as the transmission rate of the disease and 30 the basic reproduction number R 0 , defined as the expected number of exposed cases generated by one infected case in a population where all individuals are susceptible, many mathematical modelling studies have already appeared since the first confirmed COVID-19 case. The first models mainly focused on the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 using dynamic mechanistic 35 mathematical models ( [3, 4, 5, 6] ), but also simple exponential growth models (see e.g. [7, 8] ). Compartmental epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, SEIR and SEIRD have been proposed to estimate other important epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission rate and for forecasting purposes (see e.g. [6, 9] ). Other studies have used metapopulation models, which include data 40 of human mobility between cities and/or regions to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in other regions/countries far from the original epicenter in China [3, 10, 11, 5] , including the modelling of the influence of travel restrictions and other control measures in reducing the spread ( [12] .\n\nAmong the perplexing problems that mathematical models face when they the common cold or the flu (see e.g. [13] ), and (b) the uncertainty regarding 50 the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak, the knowledge of which is crucial to assess the stage and dynamics of the epidemic, especially during the first growth period.\n\nTo cope with the above problems, we herein propose a novel SEIRD with two compartments, one modelling the total infected cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The proposed modelling approach is 55 applied to Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, to estimate the scale of under-reporting of the number of actual cases in the total population, the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak and for forecasting purposes. The above tasks were accomplished by the numerical solution of a mixed-integer optimization problem using the publicly available data of cumulative cases for the period 60 February 21-March 8, the day of lockdown of all of Italy.\n\nWe address a compartmental SEIRD model that includes two categories of infected cases, namely the confirmed/reported and the unreported (unknown) cases in the total population. Based on observations and studies, our modelling hypothesis is that the confirmed cases of infected are only a (small) subset of the actual number of infected cases in the total population [5, 13, 6] . Regarding the confirmed cases of infected as of February 11, a study conducted by the Chinese CDC which was based on a total of 72,314 cases in China, about 80.9% of the 70 cases were mild and could recover at home, 13.8% severe and 4.7% critical [14] .\n\nOn the basis of the above findings, in our modelling approach, the unreported cases were considered either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that recover from the disease relatively soon and without medical care, while the confirmed cases include all the above types, but on average their recovery lasts 75 longer than the non-confirmed, they may also be hospitalized and die from the disease.\n\n.

For our analysis, and for such a short period, we assume that the total number of the population remains constant. Based on demographic data, the total population of Lombardy is N = 10m; its surface area is 23,863.09 kmq and the population density is sim422 (Inhabitants/Kmq).\n\nThe rate at which a susceptible (S) becomes exposed (E) to the virus is proportional to the density of infectious persons I in the total population, excluding the number of dead persons D. Our main assumption here is that upon confirmation, the infected persons I c go into quarantine, and, thus, they don't transmit further the disease. The proportionality constant is the \"effective\" 95 disease transmission rate, say \u03b2 =cp, wherec is the average number of con-6 .

However, the incubation period does not 125 generally coincide with the time from exposure to the time that someone starts to be infectious. Regarding COVID-19, it has been suggested that an exposed person can be infectious well before the development of symptoms [15] . With respect to the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, a study in China [16] suggests that it may range from 2-14 days, with a median of 5.2 days. Another study 130 in China, using data from 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities suggested that the median incubation period is 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). In our model, as explained above, 1 \u03c3 represents the period from exposure to the onset of the contagious period. Thus, based on the above clinical studies, for 135 our simulations, we have set 1 \u03c3 = 3. Regarding the recovery period, the WHO-China Joint Mission in a study that is based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases has reported a median time of 2 weeks from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases, and 3-6 weeks for severe or critical cases [17] . Based on the above and on the fact that within the subset 140 of confirmed cases the mild cases are the 81% [14] , we have set the recovery period for the confirmed cases' compartment to be \u03b4 c = 1/21 in order to balance the recovery period with the corresponding characterization of the cases (mild, severe/critical). The average recovery period of the unreported/non-confirmed 8 .

Thus, for each one of the above values of , the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak, the per-day \"effective\" transmission rate \u03b2 and the \"effective\" per-day mortality rate \u03b3, were computed by the numerical solution of a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms to fit the reported data of confirmed 165 cumulative cases from February 21 to March 8, the day of the lockdown of Lombardy.\n\nHere, for our computations, we have used the genetic algorithm \"ga\" provided by the Global Optimization Toolbox of Matlab [4] to minimize the following objective function:\n\nCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 17.20037689 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nwhere\n\nwhere, \u2206X SEIRD (t), (X = I, R, D) are the cumulative cases resulting from the SEIRD simulator at time t; w 1 , w 2 , w 3 correspond to scalars serving in the general case as weights to the relevant functions.\n\nIn order to get the 90% confidence intervals for \u03b2 and \u03b3 (as these are not provided by the genetic algorithm), we fixed the DAY-ZERO for the simulations 175 and run the Levenberg-Marquard around the optimal solution as implemented by the \"lsqnonlin\" function of matlab [19] .\n\nFor the optimization procedure, we set as initial guesses (the intervals within which the optimal estimates were sought are also given in parentheses): for the DAY-ZERO (t 0 ) the 16th of January (1st January-15th of February), \u03b2=0.5\n\nThus, for each one of the five values of epsilon, we have repeated the above numerical optimization procedure fifty times and we kept the best fitting outcome.\n\nAt this point we should note that the above optimization problem may in 185 principle have more than one near-optimal solutions, which may be attributed to the fact that the tuning of both DAY-ZERO and the transmission rate may in essence result in nearby values of the objective function. As a consequence, starting from different sets of optimal values for DAY-ZERO and the transmission rate (the closer DAY-ZERO is to the day of the initial report of the data, 190 10 .

On the basis of this assumption, we (4) , and that at the very first days of the epidemic S \u2248 N and D \u2248 0, the Jacobian of the system as evaluated at the disease-free state reads:\n\nThe eigenvalues (that is the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix) dictate if the disease-free equilibrium is stable or not, that is 205 if an emerging infectious disease can spread in the population. In particular, the disease-free state is stable, meaning that an infectious disease will not result in an outbreak, if and only if all the norms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian J of the discrete time system are bounded by one. Jury's stability criterion [20] (the analogue of Routh-Hurwitz criterion for discrete-time systems) can be used 210 to determine the stability of the linearized discrete time system by analysis of 11 .

Based on this percentage, the vice-president of 250 Lombardy asked the government to assume even stringer mobility restrictions.\n\nA further reduction may be attributed to behavioral changes. For example, it has been shown that social distancing and cautiousness reduce the disease transmission rate by about 20% [23] . On March 20, the government announced the implementation of even stricter measures that include the closing of all parks, 255 walking only around the residency and not even in pairs, and the prohibition of mobility to second houses [26] . Extra measures were announced on March 21, including the closure of all public and private offices, and the prohibition of any pedestrian activity, even individually [27] .\n\nThus, based on the above, it is reasonable to consider an 80% (60% contri- For the computed \"effective\" per-day transmission and mortality rates, we also report the corresponding 90% confidence intervals instead of the more standard 95% CI because of the small size of the data. Under this scenario, the DAY-ZERO for the outbreak in Lombardy was found to be the 21st of January.\n\nThe \"effective\" per-day transmission rate was found to be \u03b2 = 0.779 (90% CI: 285 0.777-0.781) and the \"effective\" per-day mortality rate for the confirmed cases was found to be \u03b3 = 0.0174 (90% CI: 0.0154-0.0193). Based on the derived value of the \"effective\" per-day disease transmission rate, the basic reproduction number was found to be R 0 = 4.04 (90% CI: 4.03-4.05).\n\nThus, based on the computed expression for R 0 , the \"effective\" per-day \n\n.

Obviously, the environmental factors and social behavior of the population in Lombardy are different from the ones, for example, prevailing in Hubei.\n\nWe hope that the results of our analysis help to mitigate some of the severe 385 consequences of the currently uncontrolled pandemic.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nWe did not receive any specific funding for this study.
