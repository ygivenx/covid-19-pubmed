{"title": "Utility of DNA Microarrays for Detection of Viruses in Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Children", "body": "A cute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common illnesses in humans and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In children, viruses are responsible for the majority of RTIs, with bacteria and other pathogens thought to be responsible for fewer than 15% of cases. 1 However, even with the best methods for viral detection currently available, a specific pathogen cannot be identified in 20% to 50% of RTIs. [1] [2] [3] [4] Existing viral diagnostic methods are limited in sensitivity and scope. Virus isolation by culture takes days to weeks, and many viruses remain fastidious or unculturable. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing has a turnaround time of 2 hours, but may suffer from low sensitivity and is available for only a limited number of viruses. 5 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is rapid and highly sensitive, and has supplanted culture as the new gold standard for detecting respiratory viruses in research settings. 3, 4 However, most PCR tests target only 1 virus at a time, making these assays cumbersome in routine clinical practice. For simultaneous detection of up to 20 viruses, a number of multiplex PCR assays have been proposed. 3, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Recently, DNA microarray testing has emerged as a promising new technology for broad-spectrum virus detection. [11] [12] [13] We previously designed an in-house microarray platform to detect all known viruses, as well as novel viruses related to known viral families (Virochip; University of California San Francisco [UCSF] ). 13 \u03f322 000 oligonucleotide probes representing all \u03f31800 fully or partially sequenced viruses in GenBank as of Fall 2004. The performance of the Virochip in respiratory virus detection has been tested previously using virally infected tissue culture cells 13 and in selected patient cohorts. 15 To date, the Virochip has not been compared directly with standard diagnostic tests for viruses in a clinical setting; thus, in the present study, we sought to compare the Virochip with conventional clinical DFA-and PCR-based testing in the detection of respiratory viruses associated with RTIs in children.\n\nThis study is a prospective case series of all consecutive samples sent for viral DFA testing from pediatric patients seen at UCSF between December 2003 and June 2004. All patient samples were collected according to protocols approved by UCSF's Institutional Review Board.\n\nConsecutive nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples sent to the UCSF clinical laboratory for DFA were analyzed with the Light Diagnostics Respiratory DFA Viral Screening and Identification Kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). This kit detects 7 common respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); influenza A and B (FluA and FluB); human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV-1, 2, and 3); and adenovirus (AdV). Remaining sample material was transferred into a sterile 14-mL conical tube, frozen, and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C.\n\nFor blinded Virochip analysis, frozen NPA samples were thawed, and 200-L aliquots were used to extract RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, California) according to the manufacturer's protocol, including on-column DNase digestion. Microarrays used in this study were identical to those described previously (National Center for Biotechnology Information GEO platform GPL3429). 16 RNA samples were amplified and labeled using a round A/B random PCR method and hybridized to the Virochip as reported previously. 13 Microarrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B scanner and analyzed using Axon GenePix 6 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, California). All microarray data have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information GEO database (accession number GSE10294).\n\nVirochip data analysis was carried out in 2 stages. First, all microarrays were analyzed with the E-Predict algorithm, 17 using a significance value of P \u03fd .01 to identify microarrays with statistically significant viral hybridization patterns (176 of 278). To generate an optimized set of oligonucleotide intensity weights for the third-generation Virochip platform, we took the remaining 102 presumably negative microarrays and manually fit a set of functions with the general equation\n\nwhere w is a weight (value from 0 to 1) for a given oligonucleotide, i is the median of sum-normalized intensities of that oligonucleotide across the 102 negative microarrays, and lower boundary a is the median of medians of the sumnormalized intensities of all oligonucleotides. The upper boundary condition b was expressed as b \u03ed a \u03e9 c , where c is a constant and is the standard deviation of sum-normalized intensities of the oligonucleotide across the 102 negative microarrays. A total of 40 weight sets with c and p as fitting measurements were evaluated using E-Predict profile separation statistics on 6 rhinovirus (RV)-positive, 6 RSV-positive, 4 HPIV-3-positive, and 2 FluA-positive microarrays. The optimal performance was achieved with weights corresponding to c \u03ed 0.15 and p \u03ed 1.5. These weights were used to generate negative null distributions based on the set of 102 negative microarrays mentioned above, and final microarray virus determinations were made by E-Predict. A microarray was considered E-predict-positive for a given virus if the corresponding energy profile attained a significance value of P \u03fd .05.\n\nBlinded reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays for RSV, FluA, RV, and enterovirus (EV) were performed on RNA extracted from the frozen NPA samples at the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory, California Department of Health Services. For detection of RSV, an RT-PCR assay for RSV targeting the fusion (F) gene was performed using the 1-step Access RT-PCR system as described previously. 2 For detection of FluA, primers and fluorescent probes targeting the highly conserved matrix (M) gene of FluA were used with the Roche LightCycler Real-Time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) as described previously. 18 For detection of RV/EV, we first ran an in-house RT-PCR multiplex assay on randomly primed template cDNA using primers targeting the highly conserved 5= untranslated region of RV 15 and EV. 19 Positive samples were identified by the presence of amplified PCR bands of the expected size on agarose gel electrophoresis. Follow-up real-time PCR assays for RV/EV detection on discrepant samples between the Virochip and the in-house multiplex RT-PCR were then carried out using the Roche LightCycler Real-Time PCR System as described previously. 20\n\nConfirmation of 2 Virochip-positive/PCR-negative samples was done by PCR using alternative primers based on high-intensity microarray oligonucleotides and direct se-quencing. The sequence from 1 case of RSV was 97% identical to a 155-bp fragment from the matrix (M) gene for RSV subgroup B strain 9320, and the sequence from 1 case of RV was 96% identical to a 302-bp fragment from the VP4/VP2 region for RV strain QPID03-0003. Another Virochip-positive/PCR-negative case (an EV) was confirmed by a repeat run of the real-time PCR assay. 20\n\nAfter assay results for the NPA samples were obtained, subjects were identified, and a retrospective review of the medical record was performed. Data were systematically collected using a standard form that documented the following information: age, sex, date and location of sample collection, clinical presentation, presence of immunocompromised state, presence of acute respiratory failure, and DFA result. Location of sample collection was classified as outpatient (clinic or emergency department) or hospital admission. Presenting illness was defined as an upper RTI (ie, cough and/or congestion with or without fever or a clinician's diagnosis), lower RTI (ie, clinician's diagnosis of asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, croup, or pneumonia), or no respiratory illness (eg, febrile illness, seizures, or DFA collected on a routine basis, such as before transplantation surgery). Immunocompromised patients were defined as children with solid organ or bone marrow transplants, congenital or acquired immune deficiencies (including those on chemotherapy), or human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with respiratory failure were defined as children who developed acute respiratory decompensation ne-cessitating mechanical ventilation as a result of their respiratory illness. For patients with more than 1 sample, a first-time sample was defined as the earliest sample collected during a single hospitalization or illness.\n\nWe analyzed a total of 278 NPA samples collected from 222 children for the presence of viruses using DFA and Virochip. Demographic and clinical data for the 222 patients are given in Table I . Most patients (73%) were hospitalized. Approximately 71% of the enrolled patients (n \u03ed 157) had an acute RTI, and the remaining patients (n \u03ed 65) had DFA sent for other reasons, most often a nonrespiratory febrile illness (n \u03ed 46). Eighteen percent of the patients (n \u03ed 39) were immunocompromised, and 8% (n \u03ed 17) developed respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation as a result of their illness. Most of the subjects with RSV were younger (mean age, 1.5 years) and required hospitalization (76%), whereas subjects with influenza tended to be older (mean age, 4.1 years) and were treated mainly as outpatients (64%). All cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus (CoV), and AdV were in hospitalized patients. The majority of viral infections in immunocompromised subjects (60%) were due to picornaviruses. Figure 1 shows the spectrum and frequency of detection of different viruses by the 2 methods. In patients with RTI, Table II ; available at www.jpeds.com), and \"other\" corresponds to viruses that are not typically considered respiratory pathogens (see text \n\nThe Virochip detected 13 cases of simultaneous infection by 2 viruses (9% of Virochip-positive samples, 5% of all samples; Table II ; available at www.jpeds.com). In contrast, DFA detected no cases of double infection. The Virochip also detected a viral pathogen in 12 of 17 critically ill patients who developed respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation, whereas a virus was detected by DFA in only 5 such patients. Two double infections (1 case of FluA/AdV and 1 case of RSV/RV) were identified among these life-threatening cases.\n\nTo assess Virochip results that were discordant with DFA and overall sensitivity and specificity, we carried out RT-PCR assays for RSV, FluA, and RV/EV, the 3 major groups of viruses detected by the Virochip (Figure 2 ). For detection of RSV and FluA, the overall sensitivity of the Virochip (86%) relative to PCR was significantly better than that of DFA (71%; P \u03fd .05 by 2 analysis). The corresponding specificities were \u0546 99%. There was also a greater overlap in positives between Virochip and PCR than between DFA and PCR for these 2 viruses; 16 of of 18 (89%) of Virochip-positive/DFA-negative RSV and FluA samples were confirmed to be true positives by PCR (Figure 2; Venn diagram) .\n\nFor detection of RV/EV, we first used an in-house RT-PCR multiplex assay based on methods reported previously. 15, 19 Using this assay, 31 NPA samples were positive by both Virochip and PCR, 18 NPA samples were Virochippositive/PCR-negative, and 5 NPA samples were Virochipnegative/PCR-positive. Because these results were inconsistent with the rates of detection using clinically validated PCR assays for the other viruses (RSV and FluA), we further analyzed the 23 discrepant samples in a blinded fashion using a more sensitive clinically validated real-time PCR assay for RV/EV. 20 Results obtained by combining these 2 assays show that the Virochip had overall high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (99%) for detection of RV/EV ( Figure 2C ).\n\nSix cases (3 picornavirus, 2 RSV, and 1 FluA) detected by the Virochip tested negative in the corresponding PCR assays (Figure 2 ). We hypothesized that most of these cases were viral strains that had failed detection with standard PCR primers. To investigate this possibility, we recovered viral sequences from 2 Virochip-positive/PCR-negative cases (1 RV and 1 RSV) and separately confirmed a case of EV that was Virochip-positive and previously PCR-negative by repeating the real-time PCR assay. Similar attempts to confirm the remaining 3 Virochip-positive/PCR-negative cases with the limited amount of sample available were unsuccessful. Thus, at least 3 of the 6 Virochip-positive/PCR-negative represent PCR false-negatives, and, consequently, the reported sensitivity of the Virochip may be underestimated.\n\nThis study of pediatric RTIs used a DNA microarray that aims to detect all known viral species simultaneously. The most common viral pathogens identified were RSV (19%), picornaviruses (16%), and FluA/B (11%). Notably, most viruses detected in the respiratory tracts of the patients with nonrespiratory illnesses and in the immunocompromised patients were picornaviruses. These findings are consistent with the observation that asymptomatic RV infections can be seen in 4% to 12% of healthy individuals and suggest that immunocompromised hosts may be more susceptible to colonization or overt respiratory illness by picornaviruses. 23 Our frequency of detection of 16% for picornaviruses is consistent with that of a previously published report (18% RVs, 2.9% EVs) that also used consecutive NPA samples. 24 Our comparison of the Virochip with DFA demonstrates that the former has superior sensitivity for respiratory virus detection. Importantly, about 50% of the overall increase in detection rate corresponds to samples with inconclusive DFA results due to low cellular content. Unlike DFA, nucleic acid detection methods, such as microarray and PCR, are capable of detecting free viral particles in addition to virusinfected cells. Another significant advantage of a panviral Figure 2 . Comparison of the performance of DFA and Virochip relative to PCR. DFA and Virochip were compared with specific PCR using 2 \u03eb 2 contingency tables and Venn diagram analysis for detection of RSV (A) and FluA (B). In addition, Virochip was compared with specific PCR using a 2 \u03eb 2 contingency table for detection of RV and EV, 2 picornaviruses not tested for by DFA (C). Because the specific PCR assays for RV/EV used here do not adequately distinguish RV from EV, results are reported as the total number of RV/EV-positive cases. microarray over DFA is the ability to screen for all known viruses simultaneously. DFA panels in current clinical use do not test for RV/EV, HMPV, or CoV, which in our study composed more than 1/3 of the detected viruses in the patients with RTIs.\n\nThe 17 patients presenting with illness severe enough to require mechanical ventilation included 3 cases of critical RV infection, including 1 immunocompromised individual. RV infection is thought to comprise a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening childhood pneumonia. 25 Our findings of cases of critical respiratory tract illness associated with RV infection is consistent with growing evidence linking RV with hospitalizations in young children. 26 The Virochip was also superior to DFA for detecting double-virus infections. Two cases of double infection, in which both viruses could be detected by DFA in principle, were characterized as single-virus infections by DFA. Previous studies have suggested that double-virus infections are associated with greater severity of RTI. 27 Higher efficiency of the microarray in detecting critical as well as double-virus infections is an important advantage of the method; timely detection of such infections may allow clinicians to avoid unnecessary antibiotics and invasive procedures and begin appropriate antiviral treatment, if available.\n\nBesides being a highly parallel methodology that uses thousands of oligonucleotide probes for simultaneous detection, DNA microarray platforms like the Virochip are expandable and adaptable. The automated oligonucleotide design allows straightforward addition of new probes for better detection of known viruses, as well as expanded coverage of novel or evolving viral species. 16, 28, 29 DNA microarrays also can be used for detection of nonviral pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. 30 Interestingly, in this study, the Virochip detected Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophages in a sample from a patient with aspiration pneumonia who also had a positive sputum culture for Streptococcus pyogenes. This result suggests a possible strategy of using phage sequences as an indirect means of detecting bacterial pathogens.\n\nDespite its panviral scope, the Virochip detected a virus in only 64% of RTI cases overall. Although comparable with findings from other detection methods, [1] [2] [3] [4] 8, 9 this result is likely an underestimation of the true number of positives arising from several factors. First, some samples may have been missed by the Virochip due to low virus titers at the detection limits of PCR. Second, the use of RNA (rather than DNA) as the source material in this study may have given rise to lower-than-expected rates of detection of DNA viruses such as AdVs, herpesviruses, and parvoviruses. The Virochip may not have detected any cases of human bocavirus, a recently described parvovirus, 31 because this virus shares low sequence identity to parvovirus sequences currently represented on the Virochip. Finally, 32% of patients with RTIs in this study were diagnosed with pneumonia, 35% of which were hospital-associated. Many of these cases of pneumonia may be nonviral in origin, as suggested by previous epidemiologic studies of pneumonia in hospitalized children. 32, 33 Using custom PCR primers, we confirmed at least 3 of the 6 microarray-positive/PCR-negative cases (1 RSV, 1 RV, and 1 EV) as true positive tests for viruses. Detection of such cases by microarray is not unexpected, because the Virochip uses multiple probes that are derived from different sites in the viral genome and have a higher tolerance for sequence mismatches than the primers used in specific PCR. This results in improved detection of divergent viruses. 14, 34 We suspect that the microarray-positive/PCR-negative cases of virus infection were missed by clinical PCR likely due to mismatches between primer and target sequences, 35 although limited specimen availability affected our ability to show this definitively.\n\nAlthough the prospect of comprehensive viral detection with a single microarray assay is appealing, several challenges must be addressed before the use of this technology can become practical in clinical diagnosis. First, setting up the technology entails significant initial startup costs, including the cost of the microarray printer and viral oligonucleotides, as well as ongoing material and labor costs. Second, the turnaround time for the assay is currently \u03f324 hours; it may be possible to decrease the processing duration by using ultra-rapid polymerases for amplification or controlled agitation techniques during hybridization. Third, reproducibility and consistent array quality are of concern. In our study, none of the microarray assays had to be repeated, and the inherent probe redundancy built into the method makes the assay robust for the purpose of virus detection. For example, of the 300 oligonucleotide probes on the Virochip designed to hybridize to rhinoviruses, as few as 4 high-intensity oligonucleotides are sufficient to make a successful virus identification. Statistical methods for interpreting the microarray data, as exemplified by E-Predict, can be completely automated, allowing ease of use and freedom from operator bias. Smaller microarrays aimed at detecting targeted virus sets (eg, respiratory viruses only) would reduce costs and simplify issues of reproducibility, quality control, and data analysis.\n\nLooking to the future, we can envision 2 possible approaches to using viral detection microarrays in clinical practice. One approach would be to use the platform for direct diagnosis of respiratory infections, as reported here. An alternative approach could be to deploy a viral microarray as an instrument of discovery rather than of routine detection, with the goal of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses that elude diagnosis using conventional methods. Once a new candidate pathogen was identified, a specific PCR-based or DFA-based assay could then be developed to detect the virus with a high degree of sensitivity in clinical samples. In this scenario, the microarray assay would complement rather than replace existing diagnostic techniques such as PCR. "}
