{"title": "Electrochemical virus detections with nanobiosensors", "body": "In addition to a template DNA, primers, Taq polymerase, nucleotides, and a thermocycler are necessary for PCR process [13] . PCR is a significant technique for not only measuring viral nucleic acids but also for medical diagnosis, plant industry, environmental studies, and gene therapy [13] . PCR is one of the most commonly used methods for the detection of viral nucleic acids. Using PCR, we can determine the identity and/or quantity of viral genomes of virions and infected cells [12, 14] . PCR, as a sensitive method, allows searching multiple possible viruses in samples and recognizing virus groups through common sequences [14] . Despite all those advantages, it is really hard to prevent patient samples which will be used for diagnostic PCR analysis from contamination and that can be considered a setback [14] . PCR analysis, also known as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), can also be used to identify viral RNA by adding an initial step in which RNA is converted to DNA [15] . Reverse transcription is carried out by using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase [16] . This conversion step is important because it provides obtaining a DNA more stable than RNA and not easily denatured like RNA for PCR process [16] .\n\nImmunoblotting: Immunoblotting, also known as Western blotting, is used for identifying proteins and protein on a membrane, and protein concentration changes in samples with antibodies [17] . The immunoblotting technique determines specific viral proteins insulated from a cell, tissue, organ, or body fluid. With immunoblotting method the infection stage of patient can be determined depending on which antibody is developed against which antigen [12] . Although the difficulty and cost of interpreting the results of immunoblotting results in a decrease in the overall use of this technique, immunoblots are still widely used for diagnostic and research purposes [12, 18] .\n\nImmunoprecipitation (IP): IP is the method of precipitating a protein antigen out of solution using an antibody that specifically binds to that specific protein. This technique can be used to isolate and concentrate a particular protein from a sample containing thousands of different proteins [19] . It is a helpful method because it provides purification of viruses which cannot be purified with standard methods, and it also allows quick purification of intact virions from small tissues for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis [20] . Nevertheless, virus-specific antibodies are essential for IP and that can be considered a disadvantage [20] .\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): Immunoassays, the most popular type of which is ELISA, provide quantification and identification of various antigens [21] . ELISAs involve simple enzyme assays with specificity of antibodies using antigens or antibodies linked to an easily assayed enzyme. The basic principle of ELISA technique is radioimmunoassay process that involves a tagged antibody in order to detect antigens [14, 21] . An enzyme bound with a substrate, a fluorescent molecule, or a radioactive isotope can be described as the tag [14] . ELISA has been used in various fields such as environmental studies in order to detect pollutants, food industry in order to detect toxins or allergens, and medical studies in order to detect pharmaceuticals, disease markers [22] . When we approach ELISA in terms of viruses, it can provide the detection of a virus or an antibody from a sample of a patient infected by viruses [14] . The quantity of viruses from a cell culture/sample or a specific antibody to a specific viral pathogen can be detected using ELISA [14] . Those studies are very crucial for diagnostics [22] . ELISA is a much faster method than immunoblotting to detect a specific viral protein. These are considered highly sensitive methods that can detect very low amounts of protein. On the other hand, ELISA tests can sometimes be quite expensive due to the cost of reagents being used [23] . Direct ELISA, indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA, and competitive ELISA are the different types of ELISA tests which are used for different scientific fields [14, 21, 22] .\n\nHemagglutination assay (HA): Basically, hemagglutination can be described as the aggregation of red blood cells (RBCs) due to the presence of hemagglutinating agents such as viruses [24] . Some viruses, such as influenza virus, rabies virus, rubella virus, mumps virus, and measles virus, have hemagglutinin surface proteins that attach to surface glycoproteins of RBCs [25] . HA is a method which relies on the fact that many viruses contain proteins that can bind and agglutinate RBCs. The principle of this assay is simple; however, sample preparation is considered laborious and presents some drawbacks [26] . HA is one of the most widely used techniques in order to detect the presence and quantity of viruses in various samples [24, 25] . However, it cannot give information about the level or measure of viral infectivity [24] . HA is also used for detecting the antibody levels against specific viruses in patient samples. The presence of specific antibodies will prevent the hemagglutination of RBCs by binding the viruses [25] . The results of HAs are given as hemagglutination unit (HAU) [27] . In an assay, in various samples, the amount of viruses in the one that can agglutinate all RBCs is described as 1 HAU [27] .\n\nFlow cytometry (FCM): FCM is a commonly used technique in biology, microbiology, virology, and immunology [28] . FCM technique involves investigating cells, cell populations, and antigens from human samples such as several body fluids [28, 29] . Nowadays, with current technological improvements, FCM method provides the determination of particles that have sizes ranging from 100 to 1000 nm such as viruses/viral particles [28] . FCM has become an important device in virology, due to its applications in viral replication and viral\u00c0cell interactions, as well as its capacity to quantify proteins [30, 31] . FCM is used for the diagnosis of viral diseases [29] .\n\nTransmission electron microscopy: TEM which is a significant method for diagnostic area can be described as a microscopy technique in which electrons pass through various samples and compose an image of the sample [32] . It allows showing very small materials and due to that, it is used in medical sciences, virology, physical sciences, etc. [32, 33] . Viruses are very small, and most of them can only be viewed by TEM. Therefore TEM has made significant contributions to virology such as the discovery of many viruses, diagnosis of various viral infections, and basic research of virus\u00c0host cell interactions [34] . Despite being a relatively quicker method and providing qualitative and quantitative information about virions, as a disadvantage, this method has a high detection limit and can only be applied to high virus concentrations ($10 7 particles/mL) [33] .\n\nMicroscopy in cell culture: Cell culture means growing living cells outside of living organisms in controlled conditions [25] . In order to produce a cell culture the most significant thing is doing all the work under sterile conditions [14] . First step of producing a cell culture is removing and mincing the required tissue. After that, different enzymes such as collagenase are applied to the tissue for degradation of extracellular matrix and releasing cells. Then centrifugation step is applied. Later, cells and growth media are combined with culture dishes and contained in an incubator with humidity, 37 C temperature and 5% CO 2 . Lastly, cells grow and divide by linking to the dish [14] . Cell culture-based virus isolation has been accepted as a \"gold standard\" in the detection and identification of viruses and is the technique by which all other test methods have been compared [35] .\n\nImmunofluorescence assay (IFA): IFA is a diagnostic technique that uses the interaction between viruses and specific antibodies [14, 25] . IFA can be considered a relatively quick method, and it is easy to apply without special technicians, it provides the certain identification of the virus [25] . It is one of the commonly used techniques for the rapid detection of virus infections by identifying virus antigens. IFA staining usually gives very rapid, sensitive, and specific virus identification in about 1\u00c02 hours. Unfortunately, the IFA technique may not be able to verify the identity of all virus strains and may be quite expensive due to the cost of the antibodies used [36] . Before the availability of ELISA tests, IFA was used for diagnostics, but now it is only used for research studies [27] .\n\nViral plaque assay: Viral plaque analysis is one of the most commonly used methods in virology to determine viral titer, and this technique is thought to be effective only for viruses that can infect single-celled cells and replicate cells. With this method, it is possible to determine infectious dose; in other words, the quantitative amount of infectious virus particles [27, 37] . The results are expressed as plaque forming units (PFU) [27] . This method usually requires 4\u00c010 days depending on the virus being analyzed and is considered time-consuming [38] . Viral plaque assay results can change depending on the assay conditions and the PFU results that were found may not always show the certain amount of infectious viral particles [37] .\n\nQuantal assays-TCID 50 , LD 50 , EID 50 : Procedures, such as TCID50, LD50, and EID50 assays, are used to determine the infectious titer of virus types that can cause cytopathic effects in tissue culture over a period of 5\u00c020 days.\n\nImmunofluorescence foci assay: The immunofluorescence foci assay is a quick method of virus titration that allows the measurement of virus in cell lines, which does not promote plaque occurrence or do not exhibit detectable cytopathic effect (CPE) [39] .\n\nThe purpose of this review is to discuss the methods used to detect viruses and to summarize the studies on electrochemical nanobiosensors. Rapid assessment of pathogenicity and virulence is the key to taking appropriate health measures in outbreaks. The most important precondition for the fight against viruses is the early isolation and detection of the presence of viral nucleic acid. In conventional methods for detecting viruses, equipment and personnel are required, and furthermore, the diagnosis of infection takes longer. Given these challenges, it is important to find rapid methods for detecting the virus in an easy, inexpensive, sensitive, and selective way in the environment, body fluids, and tissues.\n\nThe use of nanoparticles (NPs) in combination with electrochemical detection is promising in detecting viruses. The biosensor is an analytical device used for the detection of analytes that combine a biological component with a physicochemical detector [40] . A biosensor may be defined as an analytical device comprising a transducer portion and a biological element [41\u00c043] . Compared to conventional techniques, electrochemical nanobiosensors are faster, practical, precise, selective, and economical. The NP-based biosensor has high specificity and can easily be used, having low cost and precision required for rapid and reproducible detection of pathogenic microorganisms in clinical specimens [44\u00c046].\n\nViral diseases continue to be one of the most important causes of morbidity and premature death in the human population worldwide. In addition, there is a constant threat of the emergence of new viruses that affect us [47, 48] . Viruses that cause major diseases in humans are as follows: Herpesvirus: Herpesviruses are one of the most well-known viruses among all because they can cause infections for a wide variety of animals from birds to humans [49, 50] . The virions of herpesviruses are enveloped, spherical and have double-stranded DNA [51] .

Moreover, they are also related with human cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphoma (Epstein\u00c0Barr virus; a species of Herpesvirus) [50] . Those are the types of Herpesviruses that cause infections in humans: Rhadinovirus also known as Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus that infects B lymphocytes and epithelial cells and causes lymphoma and sarcoma; Simplex virus also known as Herpes simplex virus that infects epithelial cells and causes genital and oral herpes; Varicellovirus also known as Varicella-zoster virus that infects epithelial cells and causes chickenpox; Cytomegalovirus that infects epithelial cells, monocytes, endothelial cells and causes congenital defects; Lymphocryptovirus also known as Epstein\u00c0Barr virus that infects B lymphocytes and epithelial cells and causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas [49, 52] .\n\nParamyxovirus: Paramyxovirus virions are enveloped, spherical with viral RNA [53] . They are responsible for wide variety of diseases in human beings ranging from mumps and measles to aseptic meningitis [54, 55] . In addition to this, Canine morbillivirus that is a member of Paramyxoviridae causes canine distemper disease in some animals [54] . Primary viruses from Paramyxoviridae that infects humans are given next: mumps virus is responsible for mumps disease that is characterized by parotitis and can be very serious in the adulthood. Newcastle disease virus is the cause of virulent Newcastle disease which affects avian species but also it can transmit to humans [53] . Measles virus is an extremely contagious virus which is responsible for measles disease that affects skin, respiratory, and immune systems [56] . The virus infects immune and epithelial cells and measles symptoms are often confused with common cold [56] . Nowadays, there are vaccines available against most of the Paramyxoviruses such as measles, mumps, canine distemper, and Newcastle disease [54] .\n\nParvovirus: Parvoviruses are one of the smallest viruses of all with an enveloped and icosahedral virion that has single-stranded DNA [57, 58] . They can affect a wide variety of creatures ranging from humans to mice and mosquitoes [57] . Adeno-associated virus is considered the prototype of parvoviruses, and it infects humans but does not cause any diseases, only mild infections [57] . In other respects, Adeno-associated virus is used as therapeutic gene delivery vector [58] . B19 virus is a parvovirus which is the cause of erythema infectiosum that infects erythrocytes in children [57] . Minute virus of mice infects T lymphocytes of mice and causes very infectious disease especially in laboratory mice [59, 60] . Canine parvovirus is the reason of gastroenteritis which is a fatal disease for dogs [57] . Human bocavirus is a parvovirus that infects humans and causes respiratory infections with mild symptoms, especially in summertime. It was first isolated both in bovine and canine [57] .\n\nRetrovirus: Retrovirus virions are enveloped with RNA that plays a role as a template for synthesis of doublestranded DNA and that is the origin of \"retro\" name of virus [61] . Retroviruses are related with transmissible cancers, for example, HIV [61] . Avian leucosis virus uses chickens as hosts, and this infection can result with tumors in lymphoid [62] . Nowadays, it still is a serious threat for poultry industry, in addition to this, researches about the interaction between avian leucosis virus and immune system are really promising for the prevention and treatment of human retroviral diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [63] . HIV is the cause of AIDS which was first notified in 1981, and it is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer [62, 64] . With current vaccination and antiviral drug therapy, it is possible to protect from infection and prevent the progress of disease [62] . Human T-cell leukemia virus which is a RNA virus infects mainly T-cells and causes an endemic disease. It is also related with T-cell tumors [61] .\n\nAdenovirus: Adenovirus is an icosahedral, nonenveloped tumor virus with a double-stranded DNA [65, 66] . Adenovirus was first isolated from adenoid tissue of a human [65] . Human adenovirus with its subgroups of A, C, and E causes infections with mild symptoms such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis in humans [65, 66] . In addition to these, adenoviruses cause tumor in rodents but not in humans because when an adenovirus infects a human, the virus can complete its full life cycle in order to create a new virus [66] . But in rodents, such as mice, the virus cannot complete its life cycle at the late phase and that results with cell transformation [66] .\n\nTogavirus: Togaviruses are small, icosahedral, enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome [57, 67] . Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus from Togaviruses which can infect birds and rodents are not serious pathogens for humans, but they are significant veterinary pathogens. Among all togaviruses, only Rubella virus causes an important infection in humans, which is German measles [57, 67] . Transmission of togaviruses occurs with mosquitoes [57, 67] . Chikungunya virus is a novel virus that uses primates and mosquitoes as hosts and causes fever, arthritis, and rash in humans [57] . Its geographical distribution involves Africa, India, and Southeast Asia [67] . Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a zoonotic virus whose hosts are birds, horses, mosquitoes, and humans [57, 67] . VEEV causes fever and encephalitis in humans, and its transmission cycle consists of mosquito\u00c0horse\u00c0mosquito and spreads throughout humans [57, 67] .\n\nAstrovirus: Astroviruses from Astroviridae family have nonenveloped, icosahedral, single-stranded RNA virions [68] . First observation of Astroviruses goes back to 1975; they were found in the feces of infants with diarrhea [68, 69] . After that, with the improvement in the identification methods for viruses such as immunoassays and PCR, they have been described as the most common viral gastroenteritis (community or hospital acquired) agent in children younger than 2 years of age after rotavirus and calicivirus [68\u00c070]. Astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal\u00c0oral route, and their infections are not common in adults [69] . Astroviruses-related gastroenteritis causes only mild symptoms, and it can be treated with hydration and electrolyte replacement without further medical treatment [70] .\n\nCalicivirus: Caliciviruses from family of Caliciviridae are small, icosahedral, nonenveloped, and single-stranded RNA viruses, which were first identified using immunoelectron microscopy in 1972 [71] . Nowadays, caliciviruses are considered the primal causing agent of gastroenteritis with astroviruses and rotaviruses [71] . They can affect both adults and younger children and cause severe childhood diarrhea [71] .\n\nRotavirus: Rotaviruses are large, icosahedral, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses, and they are members of Reoviridae family [57] . First observation and identification of rotavirus was in young children with gastroenteritis in 1973 by electron microscopy [72] . They are the leading agent of gastroenteritis that especially occurs in winter in the children under 5 years of age worldwide [57] . Rotavirus infections cause vomiting and diarrhea which result with dehydration, if not treated carefully, it can prove fatal for children [57] . Currently, Rotarix and RotaTeq are available rotavirus vaccines; nonetheless, there are no therapeutic antiviral drugs against rotavirus infection [72] .\n\nPapillomavirus: Papillomaviruses are small, nonenveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA viruses from Papillomaviridae family [73, 74] . Their first identification goes back to the 1930s [75] . They can affect a wide variety of creatures from humans to monkeys and rabbits [73] . In humans, they infect genital tract causing cervical and vaginal cancers, respiratory tract, eye, mouth, and skin causing skin warts and skin cancer [75] . Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a carcinogenic virus that can be mucosal or cutaneous [73] . Gardasil and Cervarix are available HPV vaccines for prophylaxis [73] . For the clinical diagnosis of HPV infections, Pap smear procedure is used, which examines HPVrelated changes and malignancies in cells. Routine screening is really important for early diagnosis and treatment [75] .\n\nPicornavirus: Picornavirus is a small, nonenveloped, icosahedral RNA virus, which belongs to Picornaviridae family [76] . They can affect both animals and humans, picornavirus infections may be related with gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, muscles, and neuronal tissues [77] . Foot and mouth disease virus infects livestock such as cows, goats, sheep, etc. and causes foot and mouth disease by affecting epithelial cells [77] . Encephalomyocarditis is a disease which is caused by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). EMCV infects heart and central nervous system in humans [77] . Poliovirus is one of the first human viruses, the structure of which was examined by X-ray crystallography [76] . It is the causing agent of poliomyelitis in humans which is a paralytic disease resulting from the destruction of neurons in the spinal cord [77] . Rhinovirus infects upper and lower airway tract in humans and causes colds and respiratory diseases [76, 77] . Hepatitis A virus was first identified as the agent of hepatitis A in 1973 [76] . It infects parenchymal cells of liver in humans [76] .\n\nOrthomyxovirus: Orthomyxoviruses are spherical, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. Influenza viruses A, B, C, and D are the most significant types of orthomyxoviruses, and they cause infections in a wide variety of creatures from humans to birds. While influenza B virus can only infect humans, influenza A virus can infect not only humans but also pigs, horses, whales, seals, etc. In order to make a further categorization, subtypes can be formed based on the hosts of viruses. RT-PCR is the current detection method for the identification of influenza viruses. Influenza virus related influenza symptoms are described as sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, sore throat, myalgia, and nonproductive cough. However, as a common diagnostic mistake, all respiratory illnesses might be considered as flu. For sensitive and accurate diagnosis of influenza, RT-PCR is used. Influenza viruses affect epithelial cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and this infection is extremely contiguous due to quick spread potential by coughing and sneezing of infected people. There are two types of available therapeutic antiviral drugs: neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and drugs related with the interference of the function of viral envelope (amantadine and rimantadine). There are also prophylactic live attenuated vaccines such as LAIV4 and FluMist [78, 79] .\n\nCoronavirus: Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, spherical, single-stranded RNA viruses. Majority of coronaviruses are the causing agents of acute/chronic, lethal, zoonotic diseases of respiratory or enteric tracts such as otitis media, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) by infecting epithelial cells. Transmission of SARS and MERS occurs with close contact. RT-PCR is used for diagnostic analysis of coronaviruses [80\u00c082] .\n\nRhabdovirus: Rhabdoviruses are long, enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses from Mononegavirales [83] . Rabies virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are most important rhabdoviruses [83, 84] . Even though VSV, which is the causing agent of vesicular stomatitis, a zoonotic disease, is not considered an important pathogen for humans, it has gained significance due to its newly discovered oncolytic activity and possible use for cancer therapy [84] . Rabies virus was first studied by Louis Pasteur in 1885 even before the detailed studies on viruses have started and he developed a postexposure vaccine [85] . Rabies virus is the only significant human pathogen of rhabdoviruses [83, 85] . It infects the central nervous system of humans and animals and causes fatal disease, rabies, leading to fatal encephalomyelitis [83] . At the onset of the rabies the symptoms are mild and flu-like, but in the later phases of disease, symptoms get more severe such as paralysis, anxiety, insomnia, and hydrophobia; at this stage the recovery is almost impossible [83] . There are currently available postexposure vaccines for humans, domestic, and wildlife animals [84] .\n\nHepadnavirus: Hepadnaviruses are small, spherical, enveloped DNA viruses from Hepadnaviridae family [86] . HBV, as the smallest human DNA virus and the causing agent of acute viral hepatitis with chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, is the most important hepadnavirus [86\u00c088]. Transmission route of HBV is through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, and vaginal fluids [87] . Recombinant vaccines for hepatitis B prophylaxis is first injected after birth and then during childhood [87] . Vaccines provide high ratio of protection and immunity against HBV, and they decrease the transmission and prevalence of HBV worldwide [87] .\n\nFlavivirus: Flaviviruses are enveloped, icosahedral, single-stranded RNA viruses which include Dengue virus (DENV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [89, 90] . Important flaviviruses that cause infections in humans are listed next: mosquitoes are the transmission agent of yellow fever virus (YFV) to humans [90] . YFV causes hemorrhagic fever with accompanying symptoms, such as vomiting, back pain, and photophobia, and patients to look yellow [89\u00c091]. DENV is classified into four types, and the transmission of all these to humans takes place through mosquitoes [90] . DENV infection results with hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [90] . With early diagnosis and accurate treatment, fatality rate can be decreased [90] . Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is also transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, such as YFV and DENV, and it is the main cause of encephalitis in Asia [89, 90] . Vaccines against JEV are available in Asia and Australia [90] . HCV, which causes acute/chronic hepatitis and liver cancer resulting immunosuppression, was first discovered in 1989 [89] . Ribavirin, sofosbuvir, alpha interferon, and boceprevir are the currently used antiviral drugs for HCV; nonetheless, there is no available preventive vaccine [89] . Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947, but the first ZIKV outbreak took place in 2007. After that, by the end of 2016, ZIKV cases have started to spread rapidly and WHO declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern. General symptoms of ZIKV infections are vomiting, edema, myalgia, headache, and fever. Researches on the development of vaccines against ZIKV are still an ongoing process [90] .\n\nBiosensor-related research has received high attention over the last three decades. Biosensors have some advantages, such as affordable, fast responsive, and easy to operate analytical-friendly techniques. Therefore they present a wide area of detection and diagnosis suited for health-care analysis. Biosensors are commonly defined as analytical devices composed of a biological recognition system [92] and a physicochemical transducer [93] . Biosensors have highly selective properties due to possiblity of tailoring the specific interaction of compounds by immobilizing biological recognition elements on the sensor [94] . Typically biosensors comprises three components: a bioreceptor or biological identification component, a signal transducer, and an amplifier [94] (Fig. 18.1) .\n\nA biosensor is an analytical device, which converts biological response into a quantifiable and processable signal [96] . Immobilizing a biologically sensitive material on the surface of a biosensor is a new approach in biosensor technology. Bioreceptor elements are generally considered as biomarker, enzymes, microorganism, nucleic acids, tissues, virus, bacteria, and antigens [97] . The most common traditional techniques, such as electrochemical [cyclic voltammetry (CV), amperometric, impedance spectroscopy, potentiometric], optical, and various field-effect transistor-based methods, are described [96, 98] . Nanomaterials (NMs) bring new possibilities for the development of electrochemical biosensors. Incorporation of NMs with promising novel approaches in biosensor design provides construction of biosensors and development of novel electrochemical assays [99, 100] . In addition, the advanced nanoscale biosensor can be utilized to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity of biological sensing for analytical purposes in various fields of research and technology [92, 95] . NMs have great potential due to its promoting electron transfer reactions, high surface area and electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and mechanical robustness [101] . Moreover, they can be used to enhance electrochemical reaction and promote signal of biorecognition system [100] (Figs. 18.2 and 18.3) . Various NMs, such as magnetic NPs (iron oxide NPs), metal NPs (gold and silver NPs), carbon-based nanotubes and carbon allotropes, nanowire, and quantum dots with different biological recognition elements (enzymes, nucleic acids, antibodies, antigens, peptide), provide many opportunities for enhancing the performance of nanobiosensor [104, 105] .\n\nThe electrochemical nanobiosensors were used in versatile areas of cancer diagnostics and detection of infectious microorganisms, virus, etc. [100] . \n\nIn sensing substrates, molecular recognition processes play a central role in biosensors. Substrates of biosensors enhance the performance of the biosensors. Moreover, the sensing substrates improve the biosensing sensitivity, specificity, stability, and response dynamics [106] . There are three main engineering techniques to construct highly efficient sensing substrates: nanostructured sensing substrates, molecule-mediated interface, and DNA nanostructure\u00c0functionalized sensing interface [106] . Nanostructured sensing substrates are generally used for ultrasensitive detection of nucleic acids and proteins. Molecule-mediated interface is especially applied for small molecules.\n\nThe biosensors have a wide range of analytes from small molecules to proteins, such as enzymes, antibodies, or oligonucleotides. Biological materials can be immobilized on nanostructured electrodes surface. For example, oligonucleotides are interacted with electron surface for designing biosensors genomic analysis [107] .\n\nImmunosensors are based on a working principle-the specific antigen\u00c0antibody interaction connected with different transducers. Most of the immunosensors are based on a direct and indirect format and labeled methods. The specific antigens are first immobilized on the electrode surface, and then the analyte (antibody) is added on antigen linked electrode surface. Therefore the specific antigen selectively recognizes and binds the antibody, and the specific anti-gen\u00c0antibody complex can be evaluated using secondary antibody labeled with an enzyme [108] .\n\nElectrochemical design of nucleic acids biosensor is closely related to DNA sequencing methods based on genomics [109] . The application of nucleic acids as a bioreceptor manages analysis of RNA/DNA-based biosensors. Moreover, nucleic acid bioreceptors are also employed for detection of pathogens regards to complementary base pairs [110] .\n\nBiosensors are advantageous in relation to other PCR product-analysis techniques because they can add speed and precision to the molecular assay and can also perform simultaneous analysis of multiple analytes [111] .\n\nBiosensors can be mainly classified as optical, electrochemical, and mass spectrometric. Among biosensors, electrochemical biosensors with a volumetric transducer displayed a great potential in the detection of biomolecules [112] . Electrochemical biosensors are widely used for the detection of various analytes because of their rapid response, great sensitivity, simplicity, cost-effective, miniaturization, and portable.\n\nFabrication of biosensors using the techniques of square wave voltammetry (SWV), CV, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) allows rapid biosensing for different types of analytes.\n\nEIS has enlighten at surface area and interaction modification agents and the electrode surface [113] . Because of occurrence of an electrochemical reaction at the electrode surface upon interaction with target molecule, impedance biosensors have been widely used for the environmental monitoring of disrupting chemicals and drugs, interaction between antibody and antigen, and DNA strains [114] . The EIS measurement studies the dielectric parameters of a biological system in wide frequencies. The EIS provides information about surface adsorption, ion exchange, diffusion, and charge transfer [114] .\n\nIn another electrochemical technique, quantitative analysis using SWV is one of the most promising mechanisms in the fabrication of biosensors due to their ability to perform more sensitive answer for rapid biosensing when compared to differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques.\n\nIn pulse methods the procedures are based on the application of pulse changes of potential, and the current response is measured at a suitable time relative to the time of the pulse [115] .\n\nAll pulse techniques are based on the difference in the rate of the decay of the charging and the faradaic currents related a potential step or pulse.\n\nThe working electrode (WE) represents the fundamental component in electrochemical studies. The most commonly used WE materials are metal electrodes (Pt, Au, Hg, etc.) and carbon electrodes. It can be worked in more negative potential area by using carbon electrodes as well as good anodic potential windows. The most common form of carbon electrode is glassy carbon electrode. Moreover, carbon paste electrodes are also useful in many applications [116] .\n\nSiuzdak et al. worked on pathogen-detection methods. The nanocrystalline boron-doped diamond-based electrode (B:NCD) was used as platform of biosensor. The modified material is a highly promising material for the thirdgeneration biosensor due to its chemical inertness, wide potential window, low background current, biocompatibility, and high stability [117] .\n\nH5N1, Avian influenza virus, is determined by different methods such as the immunochromatography, the reversetranscription PCR (RT-PCR), ELISA, serological methods [9] , quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence. However, the electrochemical detection method received high attention because of providing low cost, small sample volume without amplification step, and user-friendly interface and portability [118] . Lee et al. reported the H5N1 detection with 1 pM of limit of detection (LOD). CV was applied to confirm the HA protein binding to multifunctional DNA structure on pAuNPs-modified electrode.\n\nHepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) immunosensor was developed using electrochemical techniques. Cocatalysis of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and nanoporous gold are used as modifier agents. The developed immunosensor gives a good linear relation between peak current and concentration of HBeAg (1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL as well as 0.064 pg/mL of LOD).\n\nThe electrochemical DNA biosensing device becomes effective tool because of the properties such as rapid response time, high specificity, sensitivity, and user friendly. Electrochemical paper analytical device (ePADs) makes a great contribution on the sensor, because of paper being an inexpensive substrate. Singhal et al. describe their study about the fabrication of ePADs, by diagnosing the target DNA of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [119] .\n\nElectrical and optical methods were used in the study by Oliveira et al. [120] . Genomic DNA is detected in blood plasma of patients with hepatitis B without PCR amplification. The linear range of HBV-genomic DNA concentration was found as 1.55\u00c06.68 ng/\u03bcL with LOD of 0.15 ng/\u03bcL. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) immunosensor was developed by Alizadeh et al. Hemin/G-quadruplex/ Fe 3 O 4 \u00c0AuNPs and H-amino-rGO\u00c0Au were used as modifier agents [121] . The HBsAg immunosensor was also applied in spiked human serum sample.\n\nSmart electrochemical platform was formed by Wiang et al. An ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical biosensor using graphene quantum dots for detecting HBV DNA was made. The proposed sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a detection limit of 1 nM, and the linear detection range is from 10 to 500 nM [122] .\n\nEIS detection is one of the main concepts in label-free biosensing which are nucleotides (DNA/RNA), enzymes, aptamers, and antibodies detection. Moreover, EIS measurement is a nondestructive and relatively facile system. Shariati et al. developed a biosensor of HPV DNA. Impedimetric HPV DNA biosensor by AuNTs-polycarbonate electrode was fabricated. Biosensor in label-free detection showed the good linear ranges of 0.01\u00c01 mM [114] .\n\nNanocelluloses could be used to immobilize antibodies, enzymes, and noble metal NPs, all of which could enhance electrochemical immunosensor performance. Surprisingly, very little work has been reported on the application of nanocelluloses in electrochemical immunoassays. Liu et al. aim to develop a sensitive novel sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the measurement of Avian leukosis virus subgroup J [123] .\n\nIn this chapter, we tried to collect and describe all reported biosensors for viruses by electrochemical methods. Generally, measurements depend on the affinity interaction between antibody and antigen. The most used methods were observed as amperometry, voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy methods. The developed biosensors with viruses can be used with integrated substrates (metallic-or carbon-based electrodes) for clinical, environmental, and industrial applications. Some selected applications were summarized and listed in Table 18 .1."}
