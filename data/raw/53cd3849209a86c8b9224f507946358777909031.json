The infectious process in athymic rats inoculated with JHM virus*", "body": "of mononuclear cells into the neuropile (Figs 1 (a) and (b) ). Lesions noted in rats inoculated when 15 days of age or older were smaller and more circumscribed (Fig.  1 ). In rats with latent periods of 7-l 2 weeks until onset of symptoms, the only histological indications of CNS infection were prominent mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile (Figs 2(a)-(c) ). Demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord, of the type observed in paralysed LE and mu/+ rats, were not found in rnu/rnu rats. Demyelination was, however, apparent in the cerebellum and myelencephalon, as illustrated in Figs 3 and 4. Large cell syncytia, as seen in Fig. 4(a) , have been associated with coronavirus infections in vivo and in vitro. The cellular infiltrates noted in the myelencephalon, cerebellum and spinal cord were usually quite small (Figs 2 and 3(a) ), although more extensive deposits were occasionally observed, as shown in Fig. 5 . However, in the meninges ( Fig. 6(a) and (b)) and in the ventricles of the brain (Fig. 6(c) ) of some nude rats very massive cell deposits could be observed. whereas in athymic rats, regardless of the interval between inoculation and manifestation of disease, both grey and white matter lesions were formed. Dissemination of JHMV throughout the CNS of rnu/rnu and mu/+ rats was ascertained using tissue samples from specified regions of brain and spinal cord, as previously described.' When total RNA was extracted, dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with a JHMV-specific cDNA it was evident that viral RNA was spread throughout the CNS, of paralysed nude rats, even in individual animals inoculated as late as 3-4 weeks of age and killed 46-72 days later (Fig. 7(a) ). In the spinal cord RNA was usually either absent or much less in amount. Tissue from three paralysed nude rats, infected when about 6 weeks old and one paralysed rat, infected at 9-10 weeks of age, also contained viral RNA in the telencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, myelencephalon and occassionally in the cervical spinal cord (Figs 7(b)  and (c) ). Low levels of JHMV RNA were detectable in restricted CNS regions of a nude rat inoculated when 10 weeks old, which had remained asymptomatic for 173 days and in a heterozygous rat challenged with virus at the time of weaning, which had remained without disease symptoms until it was sacrificed 163 days later (Fig.  7(d) ). Thus correlative evidence was obtained from dot-blots and histopathological studies, indicating that the infectious process can be initiated in nude rats beyond the Fig. 8(a) . Less extensive JHMV RNA labeling was noted in the myelencephalon where silver grains sometimes overlay cells of neuronal morphology, as well as cells which may not be neurons ( Fig. 8(b) . The RNA was also detected in the white matter of the cerebellum (data not shown well as tissue damage in the grey and white matter, may be suppressed by activity of the cellular immune system. Thus age-related resistance to the JHMV-induced demyelinating disease, which develops in euthymic animals before weaning, is abrogated in athymic nude rats. CsA which suppresses T-helper and enhances Tsuppressor functions,gp'O was also able to nullify to a limited extent the age-related resistance of WL rats. However, the immunosuppressant drug cyclophosphamide, "}
