{"title": "History of Coronary Heart Disease Increases the Mortality Rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Nested Case- Control Study Based on Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases in Mainland China", "body": "Since the first report of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the novel virus infection has rapidly spread to other cities in China, and has now been detected in 186 countries and locations internationally [1] . On March 11 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and has called for aggressive actions from all countries to fight the disease. Current research has indicated that COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the genetic sequence [2] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that initially reported cases in China had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market [3] [4] . With the escalated spread of the infection, there has been clear evidence of human to human transmission [5] [6] . The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue [5] [6] [7] [8] , with presence of asymptomatic, yet contagious cases [9] .\n\nAccording to the COVID-19 situation reports of WHO, as of March 23 rd , 2020, the infection has caused 81,498 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 3,267 deaths.\n\nInternationally, a total of 288,275 confirmed cases have been reported from 186 countries outside of, including 9,517 deaths. Considering the global public health threat posed by COVID- 19 , unraveling the prognostic factors for patients, especially the risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19, has important implications for clinical practice and is urgently warranted.\n\nStudies have indicated that severe cases tend to be older in age [6] [8] and are more likely to have had pre-existing medical conditions, including but not limited to hypertension [3] [6] [8] , diabetes [6] [8] , cardiovascular diseases [3] [6] [8] , cerebrovascular diseases [6] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3] [8], cancer [10] , and digestive diseases [11] , in comparison to non-severe cases [ [12] . the death risk of COVID-19, where the number of event-free people exceeds those who experienced events [29] .\n\nThis study used a nested case-control (NCC) design to assess the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the hazard of COVID-19 in mainland China. NCC, also called incidence density sampling or risk set sampling, is popular in rare-event epidemiological studies to reduce the cost of analyzing the large number of event-free observations [17] . In the NCC study design, all the events in the study cohort were included as \"cases,\" while for each case, a certain number of \"controls\" were randomly sampled from people \"at risk\" when the case event was observed.\n\nIn this study, we routinely searched for daily news and public health reports on confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China, and collected corresponding demographic and clinical data on national/provincial/municipal health commission websites, the official COVID-19 data reporting websites in mainland China. The study cohort was defined as all the publicly reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who had trackable survival dates and complete information on comorbidity history during the study period.\n\nThe data collection procedure began December 18 th , when the first laboratory-confirmed case was announced, and ended March 8 th , 2020. Follow-up time was defined as the duration from the date of disease onset till the end of observation on March 8 th or when the participant died, whichever came first. For each eligible patient, we followed local reports to update their survial status until the end of follow-up time.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1 , the inclusion criteria includes: (i) any publicly reported COVID-To minimize the impact of dropping patients with missing follow-up time, we used dynamic tracking to largely fill in the missing dates. For example, the No. 261 patient was collected in the following 3 steps:\n\nStep 1. Search on Baidu (Chinese version of Google) using keywords \"confirmed COVID-19 cases report\" and \"pre-existing comorbidities.\" We found on the website of We recorded age, gender, region and comorbidity-free for this patient.\n\nStep 2. We then determined the onset date of this patient from another announcement on the same website. In this announcement titled \"Possible exposure locations and times of the 15 th confirmed case,\" it says, \"the patient was symptomatic on February 14 th .\"\n\nStep 3. Finally, we confirmed the event status of this patient as discharged on March 3 rd , by following the updates on this website.\n\nAnalyses were performed in R 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Baseline clinical characteristics and symptoms were shown as mean (SD), median (range), or number (%), with comparison of characteristics in subjects stratified by survival status via t test for continuous variables and chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for binary ones.\n\nIn order to utilize the time-to-event information under a retrospective nested case-control design, inverse probability weighting Cox proportional hazard regression model was employed [31] . The matching between cases and controls and relevant weights were simultaneously obtained via KMprob function in multipleNCC R package [30] , by specifying the Kaplan-Meier type weights with additional matching on gender and age \u00b1 3 years old. Only survivors were assigned weights, since all cases (deaths) were included as designed with a weight of one. Those survivors with sampling probabilities of zero was considered as \"fail to match\" and excluded from the study. All rights reserved.

The total number of pre-existing comorbidities was defined as the total number of pre-existing among hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic bronchitis, lung disease and diabetes, ranging from zero to four.\n\nKaplan-Meier curve were plotted to check the proportional hazard assumption and Pearson correlation test was used to rule out the multicollinearity concern before fitting any model. Univariate weighted Cox models were performed for each of the comorbidity of interest. Multivariate weighted Cox model was used to determine if pre-existing comorbidity yielded prognostic hazard information. Other than the common risk factors (age, gender and history of surgery), the multivariate model also adjusted for location of diagnosis (in vs. outside of Hubei Province) and early period of pandemic (after vs. before January 11 th , 2020 when no-intervention was taken by the government) [20] . Although matching was based on age and gender, we adjusted for the matching covariates, since the matching was broken with inverse probability weighting [31] . A separate multivariate model was built by using the total number of pre-existing comorbidities as an ordinal predictor, adjusting for the same covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) from weighed Cox model were reported along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values.\n\nSensitivity analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression to provide estimated odds ratio (ORs), which includes the same covariates as the multivariate weighted Cox model.\n\nTo visually illustrate how well our sample represents the national patient distribution in China, we plotted the sample distribution in Appendix Figure A1 . Table 1 summarizes the patient demographics and pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nResults are presented for all patient in the study (n=321), as well as for survivors (n=175) and deaths (n=146), respectively. The mean age of the total samples was 62.1 years old (SD=16.2, range [24, 91] ), with an average of 56.5 years old in the survivor group and 68.9 years old in the death group. Median ages were similar to mean ages in both groups. We had a higher proportion of male sex (60.1%) in the sample, a half of whom survived, while around 60% of the female survived. Overall, 26.2% of patients were diagnosed in Hubei Province, among whom 71.4% died. In contrast, we have 151 survivors and 86 deaths from locations outside Hubei Province. In the sample, 60% of the total patients had COVID-19 onset after January 11 th , 2020, while 40%\n\nwere infected before that.\n\nAmong all five pre-existing comorbidities of interest, hypertension was the most common (36.4%), followed by diabetes (25.9%), CHD (14%), lung disease (8.1%) and chronic bronchitis (4.0%), with the same order in both survivor and death groups. The total number in each cumulative comorbidity's category decreased as the number increased: a total of 43.9% patients had no pre-existing comorbidities, while around 30% had one, 20.9% had two, and less than 5% had three or four. Similar patterns can be observed in stratified groups.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Figure 1 shows the estimated survival probability over 80 days for patients with and without CHD. For patients with pre-existing CHD, the estimated median survival time was 13 days (95% CI [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] days), while it was over 80 days for those without CHD (p<0.001).\n\nIn addition, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension or lung disease also had a significantly shorter median survival time, compared to those without. The estimated median survival time was 25 days (p<0.001) and 13 (p<0.001) days, respectively. \n\nThe result of Pearson correlation test and proportional hazard test (both not shown here)\n\nshowed that the comorbidities of interest were not correlated, and the assumption of proportional hazard was not violated.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Older age, male sex and patients diagnosed in Hubei Province were associated with significantly higher death risk with similar magnitude across models. In the adjusted Cox model, every 5-year increase in age was associated with an estimated 33% higher risk of death (p<0.001); male sex had an estimated 72% higher death risk than females; and patients diagnosed in Hubei Province were estimated to be 2.64 times more likely to die, compared to those in other locations.\n\nDiseases onset during early no-intervention period was associated with a higher risk of death, although no significant hazard ratio was found.

Moreover, every unit increase in comorbidity was associate with 29% risk increase in mortality.\n\nAll comorbidities of interest were associated with higher risk of COVID-19 mortality in the univariate model, of which CHD had the largest hazard ratio (HR) of 4.85 (p<0.001), followed by lung disease (HR=3.99, p<0.001), hypertension (HR=2.52, p<0.001) , diabetes (HR=1.45, p=0.12) and chronic bronchitis (HR=1.41, p=0.55). After adjusting for age, sex, in vs outside Hubei Province, early period and history of surgery, CHD was the only comorbidity that yielded a significant death risk. The result shows that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD had an estimated 92% higher death risk than those without CHD, adjusting for other confounders. In addition, hypertension had a marginally significant HR of 1.43 (p=0.09).\n\nIn this paper, we used survival analysis to estimate the fatal risk of pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 in mainland China, adjusting for the confounding effect of age, gender, history of surgery, locations in and outside of Hubei Province, and early period of pandemic when no-intervention was taken. We first showed that a history of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 29% increase of death risk (p=0.01). However, after adjusting for confounders, CHD was the only significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for confounders. Patients with CHD had 92% significantly higher risk of mortality in COVID-19, compared to patients without CHD (p=0.009). The estimated median survival times for those with CHD was 13 days (95% CI: 11-23 days), at lease 67 days shorter than those without CHD (p<0.001). Moreover, we estimated that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had 43% higher death risk, compared to those without hypertension (p=0.09). Although the p-value was marginally significant, it is worth noting since hypertension is a major risk factor of CHD [32] .\n\nTo our best knowledge, the present study is the first to provide substantial statistical evidence to show the risk effect of CHD in COVID-19 in mainland China, which reinforces the previous finding that the case-fatality rate tends to be higher among patients with cardiovascular disease [9] [12] . It is worth pointing out that the existing studies [9] [13] that investigate prognostic factors for death used chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression that does not All rights reserved.

In contrast, by conducting weighted Cox proportional hazard regression model, our study used time-to-event outcomes, which offers more information and more statistical power to detect risk factors [33] [34] . This can also explain the different statistical significance between the weighted Cox model (p=0.01) in the main analysis and the sensitivity analysis result using unweighted logistic regression (p=0.12) when evaluating the risk of total number of pre-existing comorbidities (Appendix Table A1 ).\n\nSubstantial studies have indicated that cardiovascular events following pneumonia may increase the risk of mortality [35] [ [36] [ [37] [ [38] [ [38] [ [40] [ [41] [ [41] , which explained our finding from the point view of pathophysiological mechanisms. One potential mechanism underlying the association between pneumonia and cardiovascular events is inflammation [38] .\n\nSpecifically, the inflammatory reaction following pneumonia can result in plague instability and damage in the blood vessels, where evidences of elevated local inflammation in the atherosclerotic coronary arteries following acute systemic infections have been shown in many studies [38] [40] . Thus, infections may result in heightened loading imposed on cardiomyocytes, and lead to sympathetic hyperactivity, ischemia, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia and heart failure in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD [37] .\n\nGiven the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more research is needed to investigate the mechanism by which pre-existing CHD may increase mortality risk among patients with COVID-19. From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to possibly decrease the mortality risk. we suggest monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patient with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had pre-existing heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention maybe needed [45] . controlling the patient number beneath the capacity limit.

Adjusting for others, every 5-year increase in age was associated with 33% increased risk of death, similarly to what was found in previous studies [8] [9] [13] . Unlike previous studies which did not find gender to be a significant factor predicting the risk of severe cases or mortality [3] [6] [7] [13], we found that male patients had 72% higher risk of death compared to females (p=0.01). More research is needed to investigate the mechanism underlying gender differences in risk of mortality associated with COVID-19.\n\nAlongside the evidence of prognostic risk in CHD, we suggest that extra care is needed for those with CHD, especially for elderly male patients.\n\nWe applied NCC design in our data collection and sampling inclusion procedure, which is an optimal choice given the restricted availability of public data. Due to the fact that provincial/municipal government were responsible to report all deaths with detailed information, we were able to include almost all the reported deaths that were eligible to our study. Therefore, NCC is favored in our situation where the risk factor data and event of interest can be identified opportunistically from publicly reported confirmed cases [29] .\n\nThe limitation of this analysis lies in the nature of publicly reported data. To evaluate the time-to-death risk of common comorbidities, we only included patients with clear history of comorbidity and trackable survival status at the end of follow-up. We applied dynamic tracking method to fill in the unclear/missing date, but those with missing information on comorbidity condition had to be excluded. Only those common pre-existing comorbidities were evaluated in this study, since publicly reported data may contain incomplete medical information, especially when patients had several medical conditions. A study of incubation period that also used publicly reported confirmed cases pointed out that this type of data usually over-represents severe cases [45] . In general, the over-representing of severe cases has little impact on our survival analysis result to predict death risk under NCC design, since the impact of symptom severity was not of interest in this study and cases were matched with corresponding controls."}
