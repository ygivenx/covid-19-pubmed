{"title": "Polymers in the Delivery of siRNA for the Treatment of Virus Infections", "body": "For centuries, infectious diseases were the major cause of human morbidity and mortality. Today, cardiovascular disease and cancer are the highest-rated killers. However, viral diseases such as lower respiratory tract infections, HIV/AIDS, measles, hepatitis viruses and diarrhoeal diseases still remain among the leading causes of death and disability, particularly in developing countries (http://www.who.int/topics/mortality/en/; Fig. 1). The combined mortality rates associated with viral infection total over three million deaths per year.\n\n\nAgainst a backdrop of established and persistent viral infections is the challenge of managing the threat of new epidemics from old and new infectious diseases (Fig. 2) [1]. Examples include recent outbreaks of new strains of the Ebola virus, which swept through Africa in 2014 and 2015, killing at least 11,000 people [2]; the swine flu epidemic of 2009, which spread around the world between April and December, resulting in an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 deaths [3]; and the emergence of a new, highly pathogenic strain of the Zika virus in South America, causing microcephaly in newborns, which has already spread to 67 countries, including the USA [4].\n\n\nOver the past century, we have also observed the emergence of numerous new zoonotic infections which have had significant impact on the global burden of disease (Fig. 2). In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza strains originating in poultry have contributed to a total of 856 laboratory-confirmed cases and 452 human deaths since 2003 [5]. Other examples of zoonotic spillover events include the emergence of new viruses originating in bats, such as the henipaviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6], all of which have caused outbreaks with high mortality rates and continue to threaten communities globally.\n\nViral infections in the agricultural industry are also of major concern, as infection of livestock can act as a reservoir for potential zoonotic pandemics. In addition, infectious outbreaks in crops and farming animals poses a significant threat to our economic and food security [7]. As we move into the future, an increasing socioeconomic burden of diseases is untenable. Thus there is a global need for intervention strategies to conserve and maintain human, plant and animal health and to secure our economic welfare [7, 8].\n\nThe development of therapeutics against nine of the highest-impact human diseases has progressed rapidly over the past 50 years, leading to the commercial translation of over 90 antiviral drugs (Fig. 3). A range of different targeting approaches have been utilised to block the infection cycle of several viruses including HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus and external anogenital warts caused by human papillomavirus [9]. To date, combinations of these treatment and prevention strategies have saved millions of lives, in addition to generating revenue predicted to reach $36.44 billion by 2019 for the global antiviral market.\n\n\nDespite fervent efforts in the field of antiviral research and development, many persistent or newly emerging viral diseases in humans and livestock animals still do not have low-cost, safe or readily mobilised treatments or vaccines. Global health will be left in an increasingly vulnerable position as a result of a combination of factors that include an increased number of emerging disease outbreaks, limited availability of effective drug and vaccine candidates, development of resistant strains of pathogens, disease vectors carrying viruses into previously uninfected areas, the ease of movement of infected hosts via air travel, and declining rates of vaccination (Fig. 2) [1]. Thus it is essential that we move swiftly towards establishing improved detection, vaccination and treatment strategies.\n\nNucleic acid therapy is being investigated as an alternative treatment solution for a wide range of infectious diseases, many of which are becoming resistant to standard drug interventions or which no longer respond reliably to traditional clinical management strategies. Three main approaches for nucleic acid therapies are currently under investigation.\nGene addition The host genome is supplemented with exogenous genetic material, resulting in the overexpression of naturally occurring immune factors to mount an improved immune defence against the pathogen [10].\nAntisense oligonucleotides (ASO) ASOs are short (13\u201325) single-stranded DNA molecules that hybridise to a unique target sequence within viral messenger (m)RNA expressed in the host cell, thus modulating gene expression [11].\nRNA interference (RNAi) This method is similar to ASO regulation; however, here gene expression is altered by small interfering (si)RNAs [12]. siRNAs are a class of double-stranded RNA, 20\u201325 base pairs in length, which use the microRNA pathway. By binding to complementary nucleotide sequences, they are able to direct the degradation of complementary mRNA, hence regulating the expression of the protein product.\n\n\nThe first gene addition therapy treatment was licensed in 2003 in China to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This treatment was an adenovirus-based medicine that delivered a functional copy of the p53 gene via recombinant adenovirus-p53 (Gendicine; Shenzhen SiBiono Gene Technologies) [13]. Since then, a further three gene addition therapeutics have been approved for market.\n\nGlybera was approved in the European Union in 2012 [14] for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency, with an adeno-associated viral vector engineered to express lipoprotein lipase in the muscle [15]. In 2015, a joint advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted to approve talimogene laherparepvec (T-Vec) with final approval granted by the FDA [16]. This attenuated, replication-competent oncolytic herpes simplex 1 virus was engineered to induce the expression of an immunostimulatory cytokine, granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor, for the treatment of melanoma [17]. Finally, GlaxoSmithKline are anticipating the imminent release of Strimvelis, a gamma retrovirus-mediated ex vivo gene therapy, in late 2016. Strimvelis is designed to treat the rare but severe combined immune deficiency disorder which arises from an adenosine deaminase deficiency [18]. Whilst the main focus of gene therapy to date has been on host genetic disorders, the benefits of this type of therapeutic strategy are not limited to mutations in human genes. As the field expands, this type of gene therapy may also be used to attenuate or inhibit the spread of the infectious pathogens, including viruses.\n\nThe FDA has also approved three ASO drugs. Fomivirsen, a phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide targeting the major immediate-early region proteins of human cytomegalovirus, was licensed by the FDA in August 1998 [11]. Intraocular administration of fomivirsen is used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. In 2013, FDA approval was granted for an ASO treatment, mipomersen, for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. This is a rare genetic disorder that leads to excessive levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and results in premature cardiovascular disease [19]. However, because of the side effects of this treatment, administration is reserved for severe cases of the disorder. Finally, Alicaforsen [20] is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease caused by ulcerative colitis. The FDA has designated the therapy as a fast-track candidate for unmet medical need in the orphan drug category.\n\nDespite the translational success of gene addition and ASO therapies, there are no siRNA-based therapeutics currently on the market, due to their limited success in clinical trials [21]. Factors contributing to the failure of these therapeutics include the instability of siRNA and rapid clearance from the body, inability to efficiently enter target cells and an inability to reach the cell cytoplasm. To overcome these delivery challenges, particular effort is being focussed on the development of suitable nanoparticle (NP) delivery vehicles, which protect and facilitate siRNA delivery to its target site of action. The history of the discovery and development of siRNA-based therapies and the success and obstacles associated with this strategy are reviewed in greater detail below.\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is believed to have emerged as an antiviral defence system in eukaryotes, whereby the invading viral RNA genome is recognised and degraded in order to inhibit virus replication [22, 23]. The process of RNAi was first observed with the inhibition of RNA transcripts expressed in virus-infected transgenic plants [24]. A model proposed by Waterhouse et al. [24] hypothesised that the observed post-transcriptional gene silencing was mediated by an RNA-dependent mechanism present in the cell cytoplasm, and required a double-stranded (ds)RNA template for sequence-specific recognition and degradation of the foreign mRNA transcript.\n\nAround the same time, other research groups were noting a similar mechanism in alternate eukaryotic systems (Fig. 4). In 1998, Fire and Mello [12, 25] published analogous findings in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Injection of the nematode with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting the unc22 gene eliminated expression of an endogenous mRNA transcript. The cause of transcript suppression was proven to be due to the hybridisation between the injected dsRNA and the complementary endogenous mRNA. The hybridisation event ultimately resulted in mRNA cleavage by a dsRNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibition of protein production. This work confirmed the molecular mechanism underpinning the phenotypic observations made by Waterhouse et al., and thus the term \u201cRNA interference\u201d was coined.\n\n\nAs a result of the rapid advances in gene technology that followed from this groundbreaking research, Fire and Mello were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006 (the shortest period ever from discovery to award). RNAi seized the world\u2019s attention because it offered a way to attenuate the production of any protein within a cell, including those associated with disease states. Since this revolutionary discovery, a staggering amount of research has been undertaken to harness this molecular pathway as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer, genetic disorders and viral infections.\n\nWe now know that RNA interference is a process that has been adapted over evolutionary time to contribute to the regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis. The RNAi pathway has been identified in all eukaryotes [23]. Similarly, all eukaryotes encode a variety of short RNA strands, typically referred to as microRNA (miRNA), that are not destined for translation but as a secondary level of transcriptional control [31, 32].\n\nmiRNAs can be transcribed in the nucleus either as primary (pri-)miRNAs containing \u223c70 nucleotide long stem\u2013loop structures or encoded within mRNA introns [33] (Fig. 5). Two proteins, the RNase III enzyme Drosha [34] and the dsRNA binding protein DGCR8, make up the microprocessor complex that cleaves the pri-miRNA to the precursor (pre-)miRNA [35]. Pre-miRNAs are then transported into the cytoplasm by a nucleocytoplasmic transport factor exportin-5 [36]. Mature miRNA production requires a final cleavage step to remove the loop structure and to produce the short dsRNA. This is performed by another RNase III enzyme, Dicer. The miRNA then associates with the multiprotein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which comprises Argonaute 2, Dicer, and the human immunodeficiency virus trans-activation response RNA-binding protein. The miRNA is unwound and the guide miRNA strand is integrated into the RISC complex. The remaining strand, the passenger strand, is degraded as a RISC complex substrate. The RISC-bound miRNA can then recognise and bind complementary mRNA, such as viral RNA, in the host cell cytoplasm. RISC then cleaves the target mRNA at the position facing nucleotides 10 and 11 of the siRNA, leading to degradation of the mRNA and inhibiting any subsequent protein production. For a comprehensive review of this process, see [37].\n\n\nFollowing the discovery of RNAi pathway in C. elegans [12], researchers found that the introduction of exogenous, synthetically synthesised siRNA molecules into cells could also enable specific and targeted mRNA transcript silencing [27]. In mammalian cells, siRNA is typically composed of synthetic dsRNA molecules 20\u201325 base pairs in length with 3\u2032 overhangs on each strand (Fig. 6a; Table 1) [27]. Plasmid or virus vector-based delivery of siRNA has also been explored (Fig. 6b\u2013d; Table 1), whereby the siRNA is produced as short hairpin (sh)RNA [38], shRNAmirs that mimic natural miRNA structures [39, 40] or multiple hairpins in the nucleus [41, 42]. These then enter the pathway using exportin-5 to exit the nucleus (Fig. 5). The ability of synthetic siRNAs to selectively target and degrade mRNA paves the way for a novel class of antiviral therapeutics capable of inhibiting protein viral production and suppressing viral infection.\n\n\n\nMultiple studies have shown that siRNAs can inhibit a wide range of viruses (Table 2). All viruses have an mRNA step in their replication cycle for production of viral proteins; therefore, even viruses with DNA-based genomes can be targeted (Fig. 7; Table 2). The attraction of siRNA as a unique antiviral therapeutic is because synthetic siRNAs can be rapidly developed against any virus, provided that the sequence of the viral RNA is known. Furthermore, conserved target sequences have been identified for several virus families, thus offering promise for the development of pan-family therapeutic strategies, which could provide protection against multiple viruses in one therapeutic [48, 49].\n\n\n\nAdvances in high-throughput sequencing technology allow the rapid adaptation of the targeting siRNA therapy to emerging or new viral strains and viruses conferring drug resistance [50\u201354]. This is of the utmost importance in outbreak response and management efforts, as the speed at which a therapeutic can be developed and produced in large quantities for treatment is often a major bottleneck to management strategies. Industry has also recognised this need and have now made the fast translation of large quantities of therapeutic product feasible [55, 56]. For instance, in the case of the recent Ebola outbreak, a newly designed siRNA targeting the emerged Ebola virus Makona strain was produced and incorporated into a lipid NP system within 8 weeks [57], and was deployed for compassionate use during the outbreak. This is remarkable compared to an average of 20 months that it takes to produce a new vaccine.\n\nHowever, despite the promise that siRNA-based therapy holds for the treatment of viral disease, limited success in clinical trials has restricted the production and marketing of siRNA therapeutics. Understanding and overcoming the limitations and barriers to siRNA delivery, therefore, is essential for maximising the potential of this novel therapeutic approach in modern medicine.\n\nMultiple factors contribute to the main obstacles to efficient siRNA delivery (Fig. 8). The key obstacles are listed below.\nsiRNA is highly unstable in bodily fluids due to RNAses present in serum and mucosal layers, which rapidly degrade the siRNA phosphate backbone. Thus, efficient protection from RNAses must be sought [79].Due to its small size (less than 5 nm), siRNA is rapidly cleared via renal filtration. Up to 40 times higher concentrations of siRNA have been observed in the kidneys and in excreted urine compared to other tissues 1 h following intravenous injection [80]. In another study, 10% of the siRNA dose was found in the kidneys after only 30 min [81].During viral infection, there is rarely an enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect in the infected tissue. This is in contrast to delivery models of cancer therapeutics, where a combination of poor lymphatic drainage and leaky vasculature allows accumulation of the therapeutic at the target site. Thus it is important to find ways to increase the circulation times of serum siRNA for successful delivery strategies.As with all nucleic acids, the phosphate backbone of the siRNA results in an overall negatively charged particle (Fig. 9). The outer leaflet of the cell membranes also carries a slight negative charge, therefore repelling the naked siRNA from binding and efficiently entering the cell. In order to overcome this problem, the negative charge of the siRNA should be shielded to allow for efficient transport across the cell membrane.\nTypically, siRNA therapeutics cross the cell membrane via the endocytic pathway and thus must escape the endosome before they can interact with the RISC complex in the cytoplasm. An effective delivery of siRNA must therefore be able to efficiently disrupt the endosome in order to deliver the siRNA to the cytoplasm prior to being transported to and degraded in a lysosome [82].\n\n\nTherefore, unless delivered directly to the site of treatment, naked siRNA is ineffective as a therapeutic.\n\nTo overcome the issue of serum degradation, chemical modification of siRNA nucleotides has been investigated [93\u201395]. The 2\u2032-OH of the ribonucleotide distinguishes RNA from DNA and is the catalytic target of RNases (Fig. 9a). Modification of the nucleotide at the 2\u2032-O-position of the sugar has been shown to increase siRNA stability against RNAses. Such adjustments include a phosphorothioate modification, where the non-bridging oxygen on the phosphate linkage is replaced with a sulfur atom; 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl (2\u2032-O-MOE) and 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032-F) substitutions that impede RNAse activation; and locked nucleic acids (LNA) that lock the 2\u2032 group to the carbon 4\u2032 group to inhibit RNAse degradation (Fig. 9b\u2013d) [79, 94, 96].\n\nThe most advanced antiviral siRNA clinical trials using modified siRNAs were conducted by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using 2\u2032-O-MOE-modified anti-RSV siRNA (Fig. 10) [97, 98]. The first trial was a safety and pharmacokinetic study analysing single doses up to 150 mg or multiple doses over 5 days. None of the 101 adults in the cohort showed any adverse reactions [97]. Alnylam followed on with human trials [99], where 85 healthy human subjects were infected and nasal washes were assayed for antiviral effects and clinical efficacy. The ALN-RSV01-treated groups saw a 38.1% reduction in the rate of infection, with a trend toward lower viral titres, demonstrating for the first time that a respiratory-delivered siRNA could significantly reduce RSV infection [99].\n\n\nTwo further trials, phase IIa and b, assessed the ability of ALN-RSV01 to inhibit bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome following RSV infection in lung transplant recipients [98, 100]. Both trials resulted in a significant reduction in the presentation of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome from RSV infection in lung transplant patients. These results have led Alnylam to discuss strategies for moving the drug forward with the FDA for registration. Alnylam has also conducted clinical trials with siRNAs directly conjugated with the asialoglycoprotein receptor ligand N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). A GalNac-conjugated transthyretin (TTR) siRNA has entered phase III trials, with >90 TTR knockdown in serum for treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis [119]. The second candidate is a treatment for haemophilia and related blood disorders, targeting anti-thrombin 3 (AT3). A recent press release from Alnylam indicated that >60 AT3 knockdown in serum was achieved in the phase I trial (http://www.alnylam.com/capella).\n\nCommercially available lipid-based transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine\u2122 and FuGENE\u00ae 6 have been used in in vitro studies on several occasions. These reagents have demonstrated successful delivery of siRNAs targeting influenza and protection from lethal challenge in animal models [72]. However, due to their toxicity, the translation of these agents into viable siRNA carriers for applications in humans has not been explored [88].\n\nNonetheless, a significant body of literature is available to demonstrate that other lipid-based systems may be suitable for therapeutic siRNA delivery in humans (Fig. 11). These studies have been comprehensively reviewed [21, 87, 89, 101]. During the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak, for example, clinical trials were conducted for an anti-Ebola siRNA-lipid-bound small interfering RNA (siRNA) known as TKM-130803 [102]. Administration of TKM-130803 at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg per day by intravenous infusion for 7 days to adult patients with severe Ebola virus disease did not improve survival when compared to historic controls. This was despite promising results in experimentally infected non-human primate models [57], and was attributed to the fact that the delivery occurred during an advanced disease stage, by which time the viral load and existing organ damage was overwhelming [102]. In addition to obstacles pertaining the timing of therapeutic administration, lipid nanocarriers often have a tendency to aggregate, and the active ingredient can be degraded during storage. This makes large-scale manufacturing and cold chain storage difficult, particularly in remote and arid settings.\n\n\nThe most commonly used viral vectors include adenovirus, lentivirus and retroviruses (Fig. 12). Retroviruses have the ability to integrate into the host genome, allowing continuous expression of the RNAi treatment, whilst adenoviruses do not. Viral vectors have given significant hope to the long-lasting treatment of HIV and hepatitis B and C [62, 89, 92]. Clinical trials of siRNA delivery using viral vectors have been conducted in HIV patients, in which participants underwent transplantation of lentiviral-transformed haematopoietic progenitor cells designed to express three anti-HIV siRNAs. This would theoretically reinforce the individuals\u2019 immune repertoire and control HIV viraemia [92, 103]. Clinical trials demonstrated that this approach was safe and transiently reduced viral load and increased CD4 immune cell count; however, this was not sufficient to produce a clinical benefit. Significantly more work is required to improve the transduction and expansion of the haematopoietic progenitor cells.\n\n\nSince the 1970s, the use of polymeric NP formulations has rapidly expanded [85]. Polymers offer greater stability, more control over structure and drug loading, increased opportunities for high-throughput synthesis compared to lipid-based systems and better quality control. Polymers have also been adapted for specific functions, to provide stimuli-responsive properties including responses to pH, redox, enzyme and light.\n\nCationic polymers show the greatest promise for the delivery of siRNA, as they can electrostatically bind and condense siRNA into NPs and improve cellular uptake [104]. However, with the use of cationic polymers there is a fine balance between membrane disruption that results in toxicity and membrane disruption that results in transfection. Both synthetic and natural polymers have been explored as candidates, and they must be non-toxic, non-immunogenic and non-carcinogenic, and should ultimately be degraded or cleared from the body via excretion. Multiple polymer compositions and architectures have been investigated for their suitability for siRNA delivery. Some examples include block co-polymers (di-blocks [105] and tri-blocks [71, 106]), polymeric micelles [107], dendrimers [108] and star polymers [109\u2013111] (Fig. 13). Subtle differences in architectures and the physicochemical properties of the NP complexes (i.e. size, stiffness, surface potential, morphology, hydrophobicity) [112, 113] can have significant effects on the in vitro and in vivo delivery efficiency [85]. Thus polymer composition should be carefully considered when designing such delivery vehicles.\n\n\nOnly 7 of the 60 clinical trials using siRNAs have involved a polymeric carrier system. The first targeted delivery of siRNA was accomplished in humans in 2008 using a complex cyclodextrin-based polymer with transferrin for targeting and polyethylene glycol (PEG) for stabilisation. Known as CALAA-01 from Calando Pharmaceuticals, this targeted NP was administered intravenously for the treatment of solid tumours [29]. However, the phase I trial had to be terminated, as 21% of the patients discontinued the study due to adverse side effects. Mild, dose-dependent elevations in some serum cytokines were also measured; all elevations were transient in nature, peaking at 4\u20136 h post-infusion and returning to baseline by 24 h [21, 114].\n\nAnother phase I clinical trial was conducted for siG12D-Local Drug EluteR (LODER), a biodegradable polymeric implant surgically placed in the tumour and designed for slow release of an siRNA therapeutic. The trial was for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with chemotherapy in order to target the mutated KRAS gene, which is the hallmark of pancreatic cancer [115, 116]. Patients in the study had median survival of 16 months, compared to a median survival of 10\u201313 months when treated with just chemotherapy. Successful completion of this trial has paved the way for a phase IIb trial scheduled to begin in February 2017 (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01676259).\n\nPolymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), and their co-polymers such as poly(lactide)-co-(glycolide) (PLGA), have been approved by the FDA. To date, however, no polymeric NP gene delivery system has been approved, given the unknown long-term toxicity and the low gene transfection efficiency of nanomaterials in vivo [117]. Only one antiviral polymeric carrier, a Dynamic PolyConjugate, has reached clinical trials [118]. Nevertheless, several in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated inhibition in viral challenge models. Some of the most promising candidates are outlined in Table 4.\n\n\nThe most clinically advanced example of a polymeric delivery vehicle used to treat viral infection comes from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals. Arrowhead have produced a series of Dynamic PolyConjugates (DPCs) [119] consisting of an amphipathic polymer shielded by PEG with a reversibly attached targeting ligand. One DPC (ARC-520) for combatting chronic HBV has reached phase II clinical trials. ARC-520 consists of two synthetic modified cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs (Fig. 14a) and is co-administered with a hepatocyte targeting peptide N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) that is conjugated to an amphipathic membrane active polymer, melittin-like peptide (NAG-MLP) (Fig. 14b). Both components are endocytosed by their respective receptors on hepatocytes (Fig. 14c). Once in the endosome the NAG component is released allowing MLP to interact with the endosomal membrane and facilitate siRNA release. At concentrations of 4.0 mg/kg administered to healthy volunteers by IV (or 3.0 mg/kg to patients with chronic HBV), ARC-520 appears to be well tolerated and also shows a statistically significant reduction in HBV antigen levels [118]. A November 2016 press release by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals announced that trials for ARC-520 would be discontinued in favor of their new proprietary subcutaneous and extra-hepatic delivery system (DPCsq\u2122). This was due to a decision by the regulatory committees to halt trials until primate deaths in non-clinical toxicology study were further investigated.\n\n\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) represents a significant problem for world health, as it can facilitate co-infections such as HIV, chlamydia and syphilis. Polymer NPs have been shown to be promising delivery agents for the in vivo inhibition of HSV. For example, Steinbach et al. developed PLGA-based polymer\u2013siRNA NPs formed using a double-emulsion solvent evaporation technique (Fig. 15). In the first step, siRNAs targeting UL28 (a protein from HSV required for the cleavage and packaging of viral DNA) and nectin-1 (which acts as an HSV receptor) were bound to cationic polyamines (spermidine) to form polyplexes [59], before mixing with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The initial emulsion was then added to 5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sonicated to create the second emulsion. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed spherical particles approximately 190 nm in diameter. A dose response was observed in in vivo studies, whereby mice inoculated with a lethal dose of HSV-2 and topically treated with PLGA NPs showed increased survival from ~9 days (in untreated mice) to >28 days (in PLGA NP-treated mice). This study provided promising proof-of-concept validation for the development of topical treatment strategies with siRNA NP formulations.\n\n\nA number of research groups have also begun to investigate the application of polymeric nanocarriers as delivery vehicles for the treatment or prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whilst exploring novel application strategies for HIV therapeutics in the female genital tract, Gu and co-workers developed a biodegradable film loaded with siRNA-complexed NPs (Fig. 16) [120]. The NP complexes were formed similarly to the HSV PLGA particles using double-emulsion solvent evaporation. Initially, polyplexes of polyethylenimine (PEI) and anti-SNAP-23 siRNA (a SNARE protein required for HIV particle production) were formed (Fig. 16a). A protective layer of PLGA\u2013polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added (Fig. 16b) and the surface of the NPs was further functionalised with anti-HLA-DR antibodies that target the membrane of HLA-DR+ immune cells in the vaginal mucosa (Fig. 16c). These were then embedded in the PVA, \u03bb-carrageenan, glycerine and PEG film (Fig. 16d). Upon application to an in vitro mucosal co-culture model, the film degraded, freeing the NPs to cross the mucosal layer and epithelial cells. Delivery of the siRNA-complexed polymers to the HLA-DR+ cells was successful and demonstrated significant knockdown of SNAP-23 expression (Fig. 16e). Systems such as this offer promising platforms for administration of siRNA therapeutics to mucosa-lined organs such as the female genital tract.\n\n\nIn addition, Eszterhas et al. harnessed commercially available cationic polymeric transfection agents (INTERFERin\u00ae) to deliver siRNA to human endometrial and cervical tissue explants [121]. In ex vivo tissue samples, attenuated expression of the cell receptors CD4 and CCR5 was observed, alongside protection from an HIV challenge 48 h after NP incubation. In in vivo trials, the delivery of murine CD4 siRNA reduced CD4 transcripts over several days. This demonstrates that attenuation of host cell proteins\u2014in this case receptors involved in viral entry\u2014can also aid in attenuating viral infectivity.\n\nSulfated polysaccharides such as chitosan have shown antiviral properties against a range of viruses, including HIV, by blocking viral entry and virus\u2013cell fusion [122]. Chitosan has also been used for the delivery of nucleic acids [123, 124]. Boyapalle et al. developed multifunctional chitosan\u2013lipid nanocomplexes by combining the antiviral activity of chitosan with delivery of a plasmid expressing four anti-HIV siRNAs in a lipid NP [61]. When applied as a cream vaginally to rhesus monkeys on days \u22126, \u22123 and 0 before infection, a significant decrease in viral load was detected up to day 42 of infection. However, in the control monkeys, the viral load peaked and plateaued from day 34. This formulation effectively delivered the plasmids encoding siRNA to provide significant protection against HIV in both in vitro and in vivo models, without adverse effects.\n\nIn 2004, Ge et al. reported the inhibition of influenza virus in a mouse model after intravenous delivery of PEI/siRNA polyplexes at a nitrogen: phosphate ratio of 5:1 [73]. Delivery of 120 \u00b5g of siRNA to mice 3 h prior to infection resulted in >1000-fold reduction in lung virus titres in some mice. Despite this encouraging result, a limited number of delivery applications using PEI have emerged, as it is known to be toxic and is not suitable for therapeutic delivery [125].\n\nWork performed by Hinton et al. [71, 106] used cationic tri-block polymers based on 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (synthesised via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer [RAFT] polymerisation), to deliver anti-influenza siRNA (siAnti-Flu) to inhibit virus replication in chicken embryos [71] (Fig. 17). Within 6 h, polymer had been clearly internalised by cells in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), the site of influenza replication. At higher magnification, it became evident that polymer was present in intracellular vesicles, whilst no toxicity was observed in the CAM. When the siAnti-Flu polymer complex was delivered, an average 2.5 and 1.5 log decrease in virus titre was observed compared to PBS- and control siRNA-treated embryos.\n\n\nOf interest, the polymer used in this study was also shown to induce an interferon response in the CAM cells when injected without siRNA into the allantoic fluid of eggs. In comparison, a lower level of IFN response was observed with polymer carrying the siRNAs. This effect was hypothesised to be a result of the cells\u2019 response to the charge of the polymer. Whilst this phenomenon is still under exploration, an induction of INF response in host cells based on polymer charge may be beneficially harnessed in the treatment of virus infection.\n\nThe characteristics of siRNA-loaded cationic polymer NPs must be carefully tuned to allow binding, cell entry and endosome escape whilst minimising toxicity. Considerations of immune stimulation are also important. As demonstrated in the CALAA-01 phase I clinical trial [21, 114], high doses of polymer NP treatment may result in transient increases of serum cytokines, potentially inducing a T helper (Th)2-mediated immune response [114]. Previous work with gold NPs and other engineered NP systems (ENPS) have also shown that these particles can activate the NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome pathways, a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) non-infectious immune response [126] (Fig. 18).\n\nActivation of NLRP3 stimulates a Th2 response, resulting in interferon (IFN) \u03b1 and \u03b3 expression, and is hypothesised to be dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials including NP size, shape and coating. The T helper response is important in antiviral immunity, as it secretes IFNs and other cytokines to attract lymphocytes and direct the immune response. A T helper response is also important for B cell activation, for a high level of antibody production, and for inducing cellular memory conferring long-term protective immunity [127, 128]. Immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells are largely responsible for this activation; however, other cells such as fibroblast and epithelial cells can also induce this response.\n\nInterestingly, common adjuvants including alum or aluminium salts appear to work through the same NLRP3 inflammasome pathway following disruption of the lysosomes after endocytosis [128, 132, 133]. Other lipid-based adjuvants such as lipopolysaccharides can induce the NLRP3 inflammasome by activation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which recognises foreign antigens through Toll-like receptor 4 residing on the cell membrane. Therefore, polymers that are able to induce a DAMP response similar to an adjuvant whilst delivering antiviral siRNAs may be beneficial in acute antiviral treatment [134, 135]. This approach is currently being investigated for polymer\u2013peptide-based vaccines and mRNA and pDNA vaccines against a range of viruses [136\u2013143].\n\nHowever, we must be mindful of these types of effects during the administration of long-term treatment strategies. Inducing a DAMP response could be problematic if frequently or extensively stimulated. High levels of antibodies produced against delivery vehicles could also lead to amplification of the immune response, which may lead to dangerous and off-target side effects. Over time, these responses may also contribute to reduced effectiveness of the therapeutic. For example, rapid clearance of liposomes from the bloodstream, known as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon, has been reported following repeated treatments [144, 145]. Therefore, a fine balance must be maintained between factors such as dose, composition of the delivery agent and frequency of administration in order to achieve maximum effectiveness of the siRNA therapeutic.\n\nAccurate quantification of the charge density of polymer NPs after siRNA complexation is very important. If too high, the complexes may be cytotoxic [149, 150], and if too low, they may have insufficient positive charge to bind to the cell membrane, hindering endocytosis [151, 152]. Zeta potential (ZP) is commonly used to estimate the surface charge of NPs. Dispersions of charged particles in an electrolyte solution form an electrical double layer (EDL) of charged ions around the particle (Fig. 18). When placed in an electric field, the charged particles move towards an oppositely charged electrode (electrophoresis). Light scattering is typically used to determine the velocity of the particles undergoing electrophoresis, which in turn can be related to the electrical potential at a plane within the EDL (the ZP) [153].\n\n\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) is a technique whereby a laser is passed through a suspension of NPs and the intensity of scattered light is measured. Brownian motion of the particles causes fluctuations in the detected intensities that can be used to estimate hydrodynamic radii (R\nh) of particles via the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation (Fig. 19a) [158].\n\n\nThe popularity of DLS as a particle sizing tool stems from the fact that quantitative results from large populations of NPs in solution can be obtained quickly and easily, and due to the short timescales required for data collection (1\u201310 min), time-resolved studies can be performed. Furthermore, combined DLS and ZP instruments allow a large proportion of physical NP characterisation to be performed on the same instrument.\n\nDLS has a number of limitations that should be carefully considered when performing particle size measurements. The intensity of the scattered light (I) is sensitive to the presence of adsorbing groups, fluorophores and the radius (r) of particles in solution (I \u221d r\n6). Thus coloured or fluorescent samples should be avoided, and the presence of large particles such as dust or other contaminants will cause R\nh to be overestimated. Samples must be very pure, homogenous and non-aggregated; thus time-consuming and potentially damaging preparation protocols (e.g. extensive sonication) are often required [153]. To prevent underestimation of particle size, it is important that each incident photon undergoes no more than one scattering event [159]. Thus, for polymer NPs targeting virus-challenged cells, maximum working concentrations for DLS are often lower than clinically relevant concentrations, and important inter-particle forces that may affect efficacy can be missed [160].\n\nNanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) combines laser scattering microscopy and NP tracking to determine their Rh (Fig. 19b). NTA does not rely on ensemble measurements or show increased sensitivity to larger particles, and is better suited for measuring polydisperse samples, can estimate particle concentration and has higher resolution than DLS [158]. This is particularly useful in the case of polymer NPs, which often show considerable variation in particle size due to molecular weight distribution.\n\nWhilst NTA provides a more accurate measurement of R\nh compared to DLS, it also has its own limitations. The NTA instrument is more difficult to operate and has less automated parameter optimisation, making NTA measurements time-consuming and labor-intensive [158]. The concentration range of NTA, like that of DLS, is limited [158]. However, because the majority of polymeric siRNA complexes are polydisperse, containing multiple populations of NPs with similar Rh, NTA should provide greater confidence in particle size measurements.\n\nDeviations from a spherical morphology seen in many polymer NPs has been shown to affect cell uptake [154, 161]. Microscopy techniques such as SEM, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) offer sub-nanometer resolution that can distinguish the shape and morphology of individual polymer complexes and provide a true (non-hydrodynamic) particle size (Fig. 20a, b) [162].\n\n\nLike all nanoscale analytical techniques, there are limitations, the most obvious being that for SEM, TEM and AFM, particles must be adsorbed to a solid substrate before imaging, which may affect the morphology. Additional coatings such as metallic thin films or heavy metal stains such as uranyl acetate are often required to enhance contrast in EM [163\u2013165], which may alter sample morphology and introduce imaging artefacts. Furthermore, electron microscopes typically operate in a vacuum, requiring dehydration of the NPs before imaging. Dehydration can be avoided using cryoSEM or cryoTEM; however, these techniques are expensive and complex, requiring considerable user expertise [165]. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) operates under a reduced vacuum, where water remains in a liquid phase, allowing the investigation of NPs in a more physiological environment, although the resolution of ESEM is typically lower than that of SEM [166].\n\nTapping mode AFM is well suited to polymer NP morphology characterisation (Fig. 20a, b), as it can operate with little sample preparation and in a fluid environment with relative ease. The scan speeds associated with typical AFM experiments (0.5\u20131 Hz) make this technique slow. However, the development of high-speed AFM units that operate at scan speeds of 30 Hz or higher may mean that the slow scan rates associated with AFM will soon be a thing of the past [167].\n\nNP stiffness has been shown both theoretically [113] and experimentally [168, 169] to have a large influence on cell uptake and potentially endosome escape [111]. Techniques that monitor the force exerted on a statically oscillating AFM tip by a substrate have been used for many years to determine the stiffness of materials, but their lack of spatial resolution makes it difficult to quantify individual NPs. Recent developments including quantitative nanomechanical atomic force microscopy (QNM-AFM) have enabled the mapping of the mechanical properties of a surface with nanoscale resolution, allowing the stiffness of individual NPs to be mapped [111]. This has the potential to revolutionise the physical characterisation of polymer NPs. The mode of operation differs slightly among manufacturers, but advances in software and hardware generally allow the measurement of the force on the AFM tip to be recorded for every pixel as the tip is rastered across a substrate. Stiffness moduli can be extracted from force vs. distance curves using numerical algorithms (e.g. Sneddon or Derjaguin\u2013M\u00fcller\u2013Toporov [DMT] analysis) to provide nanoscale maps of stiffness (Fig. 20c\u2013e) [170]. The ability to routinely measure the mechanical properties of individual NPs using QNM-AFM will enable a greater understanding of how stiffness (and other mechanical properties) affect cell uptake.\n\nIdeally, analysis of the physicochemical properties of targeted nanocarriers should harness a combination of the above techniques. Correlation of physical parameters such as particle size, stiffness or surface charge with biological phenomena such as cell uptake or gene silencing can then be used as a basis for the rational design of future generations of polymeric delivery vehicles (Fig. 21).\n\n\nDespite the initial interest in siRNA as an antiviral therapeutic, pharmaceutical companies have become increasingly hesitant to invest in new research in this space, given the limited success demonstrated in clinical trials. Despite these limitations, however, research around new polymer delivery vehicles and devices is a highly competitive field, with continual improvement and innovation. Furthermore, reports from recent clinical trials have suggested that siRNA therapies may also be effective when delivered as a prophylactic rather than in a post-exposure therapeutic regimen [102]. Along with the adjuvant-like effect of some NP carriers, new avenues of application are emerging for siRNA therapeutics. Whilst current research around siRNA delivery is directed towards cancer treatment regimes, it is highly likely that a successful clinical trial will rekindle interest in siRNA as an antiviral therapeutic. In such a dynamic and fast-paced global economy, siRNA delivery strategies still hold promise for combatting many of the world\u2019s persistent and emerging viral diseases."}
