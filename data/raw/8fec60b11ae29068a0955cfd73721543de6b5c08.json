{"title": "Integral membrane protein structure: transmembrane c -helices as autonomous folding domains", "body": "The way in which integral membrane proteins (IMPs) achieve their three-dimensional (3D) structure largely remains a matter of conjecture. There are a number of reasons for this, the most prominent of which are the extreme scarcity of high-resolution IMP structures and the great technical difficulties involved in obtaining direct structural information on the early steps of IMP folding. Because structurally well characterized IMPs are rare, it is both tempting and dangerous to try to extrapolate from these few data general rules which might help in understanding the structure and behaviour of other IMPs. One such attempt at generaliT~tion is the two-stage folding model [1, 2] . This model postulates that the transmembrane region of many IMPs results from the packing of preformed, hydrophobic helices, each of which represents a small autonomous folding domain (see below).\n\nThe two-stage folding hypothesis has many implications (see Fig. 1 ) and has proven to be a useful tool for interpreting a number of experimental observations relating to, for example, IMP biosynthesis and oligomerization [3,4-,5,6 \u00b0] and IMP evolution [6\u00b0] . It also raises numerous questions, in particular regarding its generality. Most IMPs whose sequences are known contain at least one stretch of amino acid residues with sufficient overall hydrophobicity to form a stable transmembrane helix. However, neither the number of these segments that do This review discusses recent results that have a bearing on these questions. Some support the concept of twostage folding, whereas others question its generality. The choice of articles has been guided mainly by the wish to illustrate the progress that has been made on various aspects of the problem. Space constraints mean this review cannot be exhaustive. For this reason, some relevant issues, such as model building and the formation of transmembrane channels by synthetic peptides or by toxins, have had to be largely, if not totally, omitted.\n\nIt is useful first to briefly recall the main arguments on which the concept of two-stage folding is founded\n\nAChR--acetylcholine receptor; BR~acteriorhodopsin; 3D--three-dimensional; F~ A, electron microscopy; IMP---integral membrane protein; PI.P--major proteolipid of central nervous system mye!in; RC--reaction centre.\n\nTransmembrane 0c-helices as autonomous folding domains Popot\n\nObservations on natural proteins \u2022 Table 1 .\n\nand which underlie the whole discussion (Table 1) . Hydrophobic environments induce polypeptides to take up periodic secondary structures, a process that is driven by the formation of main-chain hydrogen bonds [7] . For a short peptide (20-30 residues long) spanning the core of a lipid bilayer, this imposes the formation of an a-(or 3m-) helix. The few plasma membrane proteins whose transmembrane secondary structure is known with certainty are made up from bundles of cz-helices [6.]. Closed barrels, composed of [3-sheets rolled upon themselves, can also satisfy main-chain hydrogen bonding in the membrane interior. All bacterial porins whose 3D structures are known are folded into [8-barrels, the lumens of which form aqueous pores (reviewed in this issue, pp 501-507). Two-stage folding does not apply to j3-barrels. Insertion of isolated 13-strands (or pairs of [3-strands) into lipids would be energetically very costly, because of the large number of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds. In keeping with this expectation, it seems that porins fold before, or during, membrane insertion [6.,8].\n\nIn contrast, provided its surface is sufficiently hydrophobic, an isolated a-helix spanning the membrane can be expected to be stable by itself. Estimates of transfer free energy indicate that each individual transmembrane 0t-helix in known structures [bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and bacterial reaction centres (RCs)], would be more stable when spanning the membrane than in the aqueous phase. Indeed, BR fragments can be inserted into lipid vesicles, where they form transmembrane (z-helices, and can subsequently be reassembled into functional BR molecules (see below). This observation led to the proposal that the native structure of BR and similar proteins results from a two-stage folding process: in the first stage, hydrophobic segments insert into the membrane as ~,-helices; in the second stage, they pack without major rearrangement into an a-helix bundle [1, 2] . In such a model, individual co-helices are considered as autonomous folding domains, able to achieve a defined structure in the absence of the rest of the protein, even though they lack the structural complexity of the larger folding domains found in soluble proteins. The principal arguments in favour of the two-stage model are summarized in Table 1 , together with some caveats.\n\nNew structures are the touchstone of ideas about IMP folding. The past year has seen some very interesting progress along familiar lines, as well as unexpected results which may require a revision of our ideas about IMP folding. The porin/~-barrel family has two new members whose structures have been established at atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography [9\"']. Both have 16 transmembrane ~-strands. The family of proteins folded into a transmembrane ~x-helix bundle now includes the photosystem I RC and rhodopsin. New, very unexpected medium-resolution data on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) are discussed in a later section.\n\nA 3D electron-density map of photosystem I RC has been established by X-ray crystallography at 6A resolution [10-.] . Of the 28 expected transmembrane helices, 21 are resolved, as are most of the prosthetic groups involved in electron transfer and half of the 90-odd chlorophylls. Part of the structure shows approximate twofold symmetry and the arrangement of some of the chlorophylls is reminiscent of that in bacterial RCs, with which PSI is thought to share a distant ancestry (see this issue, pp 508-514).\n\nThe projection structure of rhodopsin has been established at 9A resolution by high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) [11-.] . It is compatible with the expected seven-helix topology. Four of the helices are nearly per-' Table 1 . Principal arguments in favour of the folding autonomy of hydrophobic transmembrane 0J-helices.\n\nLipid-facing segments in known structures strictly respect two constraints: a periodic secondary structure satisfying most main-chain hydrogen bonds; and the strongly hydrophobic character of lipid-facing surfaces.\n\nIndividual membrane-spanning helices are overall hydrophobic and predicted to partition more favourably into a lipid rather than an aqueous phase.\n\nOrganelle membranes contain many very short proteins (often 30-40 residues), predicted to each contain a single hydrophobic transmembrane m-helix.\n\nDespite occasional ambiguities, topologies deduced from genefusion experiments generally are consistent with the assumption that all transmernbrane segment are hydrophobic 0J-helices. The approach has been validated by the consistency of most of the observations with other sources of topological information, particularly in the case of the L subunit of Rhodobacter sphaeroides RC, where the actual topology is known from crystallographic studies.\n\nA host of experiments indicates that natural or synthetic fragments containing one or more putative transmembrane helices are able to insert into membranes and to recognize their partners within a protein or an oligomer.\n\nExtramembrane loops can often be dispensed with.\n\nKnown structures represent only a very small subset of IMP structures and functions.\n\nSimilar constraints apply to polypeptide segments buried within the transmembrane region of the protein, away from both lipids and water, but not to segments facing the aqueous phase inside hollow (pore-forming) proteins (e.g. the interior loop in porins). Sequence segments that are not by themselves hydrophobic, such as the strands making up a 13-barrel, must be inserted in a concerted way.\n\nA transmembrane position may be just one among several possible arrangements for the isolated segment; e.g. an isolated helix may distribute between juxta-and transmembrane positions. During biosynthesis, membrane insertion of two or more helices may be simultaneous (double-helical hairpin hypothesis).\n\nIn many cases, the transmembrane nature and even the existence of these proteins is still hypothetical.\n\nBy design, constructs in which the carboxy-terminal end of the protein under study is replaced with a reporter protein cannot detect some hypothetical structures, such as two successive transmembrane [~-strands. Such a structure would not affect the distribution of other extramembrane loops on each side of the membrane. The constitutive strands of a ~barrel would not be expected to form stable transmembrane ~-strands in the absence of their partners.\n\nOne of the strongest arguments in favour of the idea of transmembrane helices behaving as autonomous folding domains.\n\nThe existence of loops nevertheless stabilizes the folded structure, even if it does not direct folding. Weaker helix-helix interactions are sufficient to ensure specific association, which may be a factor favouring structural plasticity.\n\npendicular to the plane of the membrane and the remaining helices are tilted to form a diffuse arc. One end of the arc intercalates between two of the well defined helices, yielding an overall structure that is only remotely reminiscent of BR. An analysis based on residue variability in > 200 sequences of G-protein coupled receptors and on constraints on the minimal length of the interhelix loops has permitted the putative transmembrane segments to be assigned to helices in the electron-density map [12o] .\n\nAs in BK the order of the helices would be the same as in the sequence, but their 3D arrangement would be somewhat different, with the third helix slanted into the middle of the bundle. These observations should lead to major improvements in current 3D models of G-protein coupled receptors [13, 14] .\n\nAs regards crystallographic studies of other IMPs whose structures are known to near atomic resolution, further evidence has been obtained in favour of a change of con- , whose transmembrane topology is known.\n\nMapping transmembrane topologies by gene-fusion experiments has its limitations however. For instance, the most common method is to replace the carboxy-termihal part of the protein under study with the reporter protein. This approach cannot be expected to reveal the presence of 13-strands hairpins (such as have been proposed in models of voltage-gated channel proteins [23-25]) because such features would be unstable in the membrane in the absence of the strands completing the putative 13-barrel, as discussed above [20\"].\n\nAnother proposed deviation from the pure s-helix bundie besides 13-strands is the interrupted a-helix, which spans a single leaflet, looping back on itself in the middie of the bilayer. For similar reasons to those discussed above, such an arrangement is expected to be energetically very costly [26] . This consideration was the starting point for revising existing topological models for the major proteolipid of central nervous system myelin (PIP) [27] . The revised topology, which features four a-helices spanning the full thickness of the membrane, has received good support from an examination of the state of the cysteine residues in the proteolipid: the four cysteines predicted to lie outside the cell form disulphide bridges; the four intramembrane cysteines are reduced; and the six cytosolic cysteines are acytated [28-]. There are a number of other proteins for which the proposed topologies deviate from the standard bundle of hydrophobic a-helices, for example, the mitochondrial ADP/ATP exchanger [29], whose structural study might lead to interesting insights.\n\nTopological predictions often remain ambiguous, even if it is assumed that long stretches of hydrophobic residues must correspond to transmembrane a-helices, because there is no well defined threshold separating transmembrane from extramembrane hydrophobic seg- Recent results however have challenged this four-helix topology in two divergent and mutually incompatible ways. One series of experiments relied on electrophysiological measurements and the effect of sulphydrytblocking agents on AChR molecules in which residues in and around the M2 region had been substituted with cysteines. The results were consistent with M2 lining the channel, but were considered more suggestive of a 13-strand than an a-helix [38\"].\n\nThis conclusion is hard to reconcile with a recent EM study [39\"'] that yielded a 9A 3D map of the Torpedo AChR. The map showed five helices, presumably M2, surrounding the pore. Surprisingly, the 15 other expected helices were not apparent in the map --a fact for which the limited resolution of the map does not seem to be responsible. Instead, the author proposed that the five M2 helices are surrounded by a vast (unresolved) 13barrel to which each subunit contributes five or seven strands, yielding an overall structure similar to those of two (water-soluble) bacterial toxins [40, 41] .\n\nSpace limitations preclude a detailed discussion of this proposal. However, it has wide-ranging implications for the assembly of the ACb.R. For instance, individual subunits (which are synthesized independently) would be expected to have a different topology in the isolated state than when assembled in the complex. As already discussed, it is quite unlikely that unassembled 13-strands of a transmembrane 13-barrel could be forced to face the lipids. As segments M1, M3 and M4 are long and highly hydrophobic, it cannot be excluded that, in a truncated protein, they do insert as a-helices, which would explain the gene-fusion results [21-]. It is very difficult however to envisage how three of the four transmembrane w helices (were they to be present in the unassembled subunits) could subsequently rearrange into five to seven 13-strands upon oligomerization. Alternative possibilities, such as a transient co-existence (in isolated subunits) of a transmembrane helix (M2) with a seven-stranded [3-barrel (that would open to associate with those of other subunits), are almost too embarrassing to mention given the mechanistic problems they would create at the time of insertion and oligomerization. Further investigations into the topology of the AChR and its unassembled subunits, as well as the identification of hypothetical factors that may stabilize the transmembrane structure of unassembled subunits and/or facilitate structural rearrangements, will clearly have important implications for IMPs extending far beyond the AChR field.\n\nAs regards the practice of sequence interpretation, rough days are ahead of us if we are to determine whether a stretch of ,-, 25 hydrophobic residues represents a single transmembrane cx-helix or three closely spaced IS-strands with no intervening hydrophilic residues. Each putative transmembrane segment will have to be examined in more detail than before for tea-tale periodicities in amino acid composition and variability. Improved scales for discriminating protein-lipid from protein-protein interfaces may help in meeting this challenge (FA Samatey,\n\nFurther evidence that topology-determining information is dispersed throughout the sequence of IMPs has come from several experiments. For instance, alkaline phosphatase has been fused to fragments containing single/ac permease transmembrane segments. The most striking findings are that, even in isotropic organic media, these fragments form cz-helices over a length that corresponds closely to that in the native molecule, and, in addition, the conformation of most of the residues in the cz-helical section of each peptide is constrained. These observations have interesting implications both regarding the nature of the factors that determine helix length and for model building.\n\nAlthough the single membrane-spanning helix of bitopic proteins has long been considered a mere hydrophobic anchor, it is increasingly often found to play a role in oligomerization. These findings, and their implications for tmnsmembrane signalling, have been discussed in a number of recent reviews [4\",5,51]. In the case of the erythrocyte glycoprotein glycophorin A, for instance, it has been shown that the tmnsmembrane anchor, even taken out of its normal protein context, is sufficient to cause dimerization. SDS-resistant heterodimers have been obtained, in which an authentic molecule of glycophorin associates with a synthetic peptide mimicking its anchor pauses (of uncertain origin). These have been postulated to facilitate co-translational binding of prosthetic groups to freshly inserted helices, thereby protecting the incomplete protein against co-translational proteolytic degradation [58] .\n\nIt has been shown that deletion of several transmembrahe helices from BR or /ac permease molecules by biochemical or genetic means results in non-functional species. However, functional complementation is observed when two such molecules bearing different deletions are either reconstituted or expressed simultaneously, even though the complex thus formed has an excess of transmembrane segments [59,60\u00b0\u00b0] . The implication is that the two incomplete bundles are destabilized and hence can engage in intermolecular associations. They recruit missing helices from a complementary molecule, forming abnormal, but functional, heterodimers. Redundant helices in the complex presumably remain tmnsmembrane, but are expelled to the side of a native-like, hybrid bundle [6\u00b0]. An example of redundant helices being inserted within an unfragmented IMP has also been described [61] .\n\nElongation, shortening, fragmentation or fusion of transmerflbrane regions are likely to have been common events in the course of evolution [6\u00b0]. In the cytochrome c oxidase family, for instance, genes encoding proteins homologous to mitochondrial subunits I and III are fused into a single gene in one of the oxidases of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (M Lfibben et aL, personal communication). In several other bacteria, subunits I and III are separate, but two of the transmembrane helices appear to have transferred from one subunit to the other, compared with the mitochondrial subunits [62] . It has been suggested recently that BR and G-protein coupled receptors have evolved from a common ancestor by shuffling blocks of transmembrane helices [63] , but the statistical evidence presented is not entirely convincing.\n\nOver the past few years, it has become increasingly obvious that IMPs whose transmembrane region is made up of a bundle of hydrophobic a-helices behave as twotiered structures, with each helix exhibiting a large degree of structural autonomy. Application of this concept permits ration~liTation of some otherwise surprising observations in such areas as membrane integration during biosynthesis, oligomerization and evolution.\n\nAt the same time, it is still uncertain what proportion of IMPs belongs in the two-stage folding category. Determination of atomic structures has made it clear that membrane proteins strictly obey two expected constraints: firstly, potypeptide segments in contact with lipids adopt periodic secondary structures which satisfy internal hydrogen-bonding requirements; and secondly, they expose predominantly hydrophobic side chains at the lipid-protein interface. The diversity of folding schemes allowed to IMPs within these constraints remains one of the most interesting open questions.\n\nProgress is being made continuously in the development of high-resolution EM and in growing two-dimensional and 3D IMP crystals. Our database of atomic structures will inevitably increase, and, with a wider knowledge of structural diversity, the risks inherent in trying to identify general folding principles will diminish. These general rules will remain indispensable for interpreting data gathered on proteins whose high-resolution structure remains beyond our reach. \n\nThe crystal structures of two E co//porins, PhoE and OmpF, reveal interesting variations on the theme of the 16-strand transmembrane 15-barrel.\n\n10.

The authors have examined whether the rotational arrangement of ahelices in BR can be predicted once their sequences and the position of their axes is known. Information about side-chain conformations and helix rotational positions (but not the shape of the backbone) has been erased from the EM model of BK Models were generated by rotating helices (either in pairs or in triplets) around their axes and it was determined, for each model, which energy of interaction is associated with the most favourable combination of side-chain conformations. It is concluded that it is not possible, using this procedure, to identify uniquely how two given helices interact in BR, even though the correct arrangemerit always is among the best models; nevertheless, the rotational positions established by EM and neutron diffraction can be 'postdicted' to better than 20 \u00b0 once the multiple constraints inherent to packing more than two helices into a bundle are taken into account simultaneously. The composition of large (> 50 residues) extramembrane segments in bitopic and polytopic proteins is examined. Strongest deviations from randomness are found for alanine and arginine residues (inside) and for threonine and cysteine residues (outside). The origin of most the differences is not clear, but they are similar to differences observed between cylosolic and extracellular proteins. These data can probably help when topologies are difficult to sort out. . Two lipophilic labels are used to identify residues in the AChR that face the lipid phase. The most detailed results are obtained for segment M4, a strongly hydrophobic sequence segment located close to the carboxy terminus of each AChR subunit. The data confirm earlier conclusions that M4 is transmembrane and lies at the protein-lipid interface, and suggest that it is indeed an or-helix.\n\nAKABAS MH, STAUFFER DA, XU M, KARLIN A: Acetylcholine Re-.\n\nceptor Channel Structure Probed in Cysteine-Substitution Mutants. Sc/ence 1992, 258:307-310. The authors introduce cysteines at various positions in a nine-residue stretch in the M2 (putative channel-lining) segment of mouse muscle AChR ct-subunit. They express the mutant receptors in Xenopus oocytes and determine their sensitivity to small, charged, sulphydryl-blocking agents purported to enter the channel. They conclude that the pattern of blockade observed is more compatible with the nine-residue segment in M2 forming a [3-strand rather than a helix. Alternative interpretations are possible (see [ This paper describes an improved method for predicting the helical nature and orientations of putative transmembrane segment, based upon estimates of the probability of one type of residue being substituted by another on lipid-exposed helix faces. The approach has been tested by using the sequences of BR, halorhodopsin and sensory rhodopsin I and gives a fair prediction of helix orientations in BR.\n\nCAtAMIA J, MANOIt C: Membrane Protein Segments as Export Signals. J Mol Biol 1992, 224:539-543. The alkaline phosphatase (PboA) gene is fused to the 3' end of gene fragments encoding selected individual transmembrane segments of/ac permease and the extramembrane segment that precedes them in the sequence. All except one segment act as export signals, translocating alkaline phosphatase across the plasma membrane into the periplasm. The presence of a transmembrane arginine residue in segment IX reduces its export efficiency. It is suggested that, in the natural situation, insertion of segment IX may be coupled with that of segment X, with which it is thought to interact in mature/z~ permease. The M (previously El) protein of hepatitis virus is synthesized without a signal sequence. Its topology probably features three closely spaced transmembrane or-helices (a, b and c), with a short amino terminus facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and a large carboxy terminus facing the cytosol. All combinations of one-or twohelix deletions are generated. The mutant proteins am expressed in a cell-free system, and their topology is examined using glycosylation, protease sensitivity and the binding of antibodies as probes. All proteins insert as expected if the hydrophobic segment(s) adopt the same transmembrane orientation as in the intact protein. The mutam in which helix b has been deleted, which contains conflicting vectoriality signals, ends up with a scrambled orientation. Together with previous experiments of the sort (see also [43\"]), these experiments further demonstrate that topological information is distributed throughout polytopic proteins rather than being determined only by the orientation of the first transmembrane segment. The topologies of the mutant proteins, however, are difficult to explain simply on the basis of the 'positive inside\" rule and it is suggested that additional signals must be involved. In this NMR study, a larger proteolytic fragment (residues 163-231, which encompass BR helices F and G) is found to comprise two orhelical regions connected by a disordered segment. The helices correspond, within a few residues, to the transmembrane helices observed in native BIZ As in a similar study on helices A and B [50\u00b0], there is no evidence that the helices interact in solution, as they do in the native molecule. The effects on dimerization of 282 mutations in the anchoring segment of glycophorin A were examined. Amino acid substitutions which replaced one hydrophobic residue by another revealed the great sensitivity of dimer formation to minor sequence changes. Mutation-sensitive positions occurred with a periodicity of 3.9 residues, suggesting that the two 0t.helices in the dimer form a slightly right-handed supercoil. The region of contact between the two helices is mainly hydrophobic and contains no strongly polar residues, at variance with the postulated contact areas in several tyrosine.kinase receptors. Close packing probably plays an important role in the association of glycophorin A anchors.\n\nTREUTLEIN HR, LEMMON MA, ENGELMAN DM, BRONGER AT: The \u00b0, Glycophorin A Transmembrane Domain Dimer: Sequence-Specific Propensity for a Right-Handed Supercoil of Helices. Biochemistry 1992, 31:12726--12733. Modelling by simulated annealing is used to examine the way transmembrane anchors may pack in the glycophorin A dimer. Models with the lowest (most favourable) interaction energy tend to correspond to the left-and right-handed supercoil arrangements. The right-handed configuration gives a much better fit to the mutagenesis data of [54\u00b0\"]. It predicts that the axes of the two helices approach quite closely ( ~ 6.9A) near Gly79, a region of great sensitivity in the mutational analysis. The paper is of particular interest because it illustrates for a 'simple' case both the difficulties and promises of predicting, ab initio, the structure of transmembrane regions by packing preformed a-helices.

This reports a study, of the synthesis of MaIF and its stabilization against exogenous proteases in mutants affected in the synthesis of other subunits of the maltose transport complex. The observations strongly suggest that each of the two IMPs in the complex is inserted independently in the membrane, where it diffuses and associates stochastically with the complementary subunit. This situation is reminiscent of the mode of trimerization of influenza virus haemagglutinin in the endoplasmic reticulum."}
